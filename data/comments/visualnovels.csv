visualnovels,3e513u,Uninformedperson,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:05:00 2015 UTC,"not sure why we're spoiler-tagging amane's route in a amane route spoilers thread, but okay i guess sure    i've read too many survival-style novels, so the route just ended up coming off as a mediocre highschool girl version of yet another one to me (with tons of sex scenes).  (spoiler-tagging these similar books' names below to prevent spoilers of those books based on this route)  When thinking of the content of the 2nd half of the route, the two closest works that comes to mind are well-known English Novel and often recommended Visual Novel. The entire route is completely lackluster when compared to just those two alone. When reading it I was mostly mindlessly chugging through it since I already felt that i've read something better beforehand. I'm sure I would have liked it more if it was the first of it's type that I had read, but unfortunately that wasn't the case for me.  I also had problems thinking up a rating for the route after finishing it, since it really felt like it was a half-finished and would be continued in the untranslated sequels. I mean yea, , but the route just seemed incredibly open-ended aside from that.    And then you get to the problems with the route itself:       I know i'm forgetting something now, but it's been like a year+ since i've read the thing...    one of the few things I liked about the route was how it explained amane . It introduced a character trait, it explained the character trait, and it was okay.  overall route rating, ""it tried""/10"
visualnovels,3e513u,Breakneckgamer,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:40:04 2015 UTC,"I was tepid with Amane's route (IF YOU WANNA AVOID SPOILERS STOP READING), but it quickly turned into my favorite route by far with the flashback. I was completely enthralled with it, and even reread it recently because I enjoyed it so much!  I didn't enjoy the hentai much, so before the flashback Amane's route felt a bit too ""porn game"" but man, that flashback was amazing.  I have to admit though, I didn't notice in my first read but in my second read I was asking myself ""HOW DID THE girl eating her maggots from her head wound SURVIVE"", lol. Thought she'd have died to her infection or from an internal maggot infestation...since she was eating them!!!!!!!!!!!!  Anyways I think the reason they all kind of went insane is because they were probably told (or just gave up) that they were eating their friends. Also, they were eating someone that died from sickness...so their health probably took a turn for the worse."
visualnovels,3e513u,saccharind,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:42:03 2015 UTC,"Amane's route was easily my least favourite. The route consisted of sex, a flashback and a climax. In Amane's route there was no development for Yuuji or Amane as characters. The sex obviously wasn't written for the story but written to be in there so I couldn't care less for the long trek it was to get through them. During this time Amane didn't develop as a character at all, Yuuji, on the the other hand at least grew as a person gaining a significant other however that didn't stop me from dropping it for a while. When it finally hit the flashback things got interesting but that was all it was. It was certainly one of the most interesting flashbacks but once you come out of the flashback what do you have? Saki still had her problem after the flashback and so did Yukino  but Amane didn't she had already come to terms with it of course she was still afraid of going back there but she has accepted her past and is already trying to move on. Her only issue was being scared that Yuuji would leave her someday which by him hearing about her past ends that right then and there. This provides no dynamic between her and Yuuji for the latter half. To top it off we end it with a climax as you said wasn't built up, it kinda just happened. All in all I found the flash back to be a fun little read on its own I didn't need everything else and I would have enjoyed it."

visualnovels,3e42vh,TheOwnedBagel,7,Tue Jul 21 20:15:23 2015 UTC,"Nothing is as important as making the start of the novel hook me in. What I always remember is the latter parts, the more impactful scenes. But if a novel can't make me discover it, then all of that will be missed."
visualnovels,3e42vh,WellmadeIndochina,3,Tue Jul 21 20:38:26 2015 UTC,Do you prefer the hook to be due to the setting or the characters?
visualnovels,3e42vh,WellmadeIndochina,6,Tue Jul 21 20:52:28 2015 UTC,"I believe both are needed to create a strong atmosphere that keeps drawing me in. But in my experience, the setting can be very repetitive without it losing its effect (such as high school) while if the characters are too archetypical I quickly lose my interest.  A good setting will definitely make me return to see more of the world. But while I can stand a boring premise if the characters are good, I can't possibly go through a story if the characters are bland.  Overall, characters are more important - They allow for the story to have emotion, and to keep being interesting, while the setting is a more static element."
visualnovels,3e42vh,FinalNwo,5,Tue Jul 21 21:16:21 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, every start has its good points. Sometimes being thrown into an already fully developed universe through the protagonist's eyes might seem confusing at first, but I like that as much as I like discovering a ""new world"" by starting with the basics or getting to know important characters.  I personally like the start of Koihime Musou the most. At first, the protagonist has a normal day at school with people he already knows and interacts with, even though we know nothing about them. But all that didn't actually matter, because he gets soaked into a completely different world with different characters. VNs like Muv-Luv don't do that; original characters usually exist in the other universes too, just with either a different personality or having no memories of the protagonist.  As for routes, I'd like them to diverge from the common route, not being a part of it. Sharin no Kuni's system isn't my thing at all."
visualnovels,3e42vh,FinalNwo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:44:02 2015 UTC,"Do you like to discover the ""new world"" early on or have new discoveries as time goes on when it's convenient?"
visualnovels,3e42vh,FinalNwo,2,Tue Jul 21 20:57:06 2015 UTC,"That depends on the setting. If the protagonist can enter and leave the other world at free will, it doesn't matter much if I don't know a lot of it in the first couple of hours, because I ""learn by watching"". If he gets thrown into a new world without any current way to leave, I enjoy seeing the protagonist learning about the world alongside me. Things like politics or different states are important to know from the start, but little details that would only induce an infodump aren't necessary at the beginning and only produce a slow start."
visualnovels,3e42vh,Avebone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:00:29 2015 UTC,If the character already knows something or is a special case (take Sharin no Kuni for example) would you rather have an info dump or small details here and there as they come up to explain to the reader?
visualnovels,3e42vh,falafel_eater,2,Tue Jul 21 21:04:07 2015 UTC,"I personally think it's better to have the protagonist quickly mention small things alongside events, since the thought process usually does the same thing, we're just not conscious of it, I think. No real person just stops and has a monologue for an hour before doing something. That makes the character a bit more relatable and ""human"". In calm scenes where nothing happens, the protagonist can (can, not should) recollect things that happened or rules/systems/whatever is worth knowing and explain to the reader (just thinking to himself actually) in the first few hours of the VN. The thought process of a person should only cover the absolutely necessary things while stuff happens."
visualnovels,3e42vh,ctom42,5,Tue Jul 21 21:16:09 2015 UTC,"Truth be told, the start doesn't matter to me.  I mean obviously it should be entertaining, but I go in planning to read all of a VN.  I rarely ever drop anything.  Both long monologues and being put right into the story can work.  Same with choosing a character route or being forced into an order.  Doing what you feel is better for your story and what you feel works best naturally with it.  Forcing your story to conform to what you think other people find best is something I don't think as really the best approach."
visualnovels,3e42vh,Avebone,4,Tue Jul 21 21:22:57 2015 UTC,"I think that Little Busters! has my favorite opening of all the visual novels I'd read so far. It immediately starts with Masato shouting ""Kyousuke is back!"" and running, and there's this immediate sense of curiosity and fun. It doesn't rush to immediately present the profile and background of the main characters (even though all of the Little Busters are right there), but it shows enough to be intriguing. Similarly, it's not crammed full with anything mysterious or unusual or strange or even very funny (except for Rin vs. Masato, heh).    Muv-Luv Extra, opening with Sumika's diary, also gets an honorable mention."
visualnovels,3e42vh,Cornetto_Man,3,Tue Jul 21 23:33:35 2015 UTC,"Like any other work of fiction, there are a variety of acceptable ways to start a story. The important thing to do is to introduce the main cast and the main conflict(s) (if any) in a timely and natural manner. Introducing the conflicts is one area I feel many VNs fall short in. They have long common routes with little to no foreshadowing for the conflicts for the character routes. This leads to the common route being essentially narrative fluff in terms of the overall narrative and thematic structure of the story. Establishing characters does not need to take 10 hours and does not need to be done purely through SOL/Comedy. There should not be a sharp discord between the common route and the character routes. Obviously this is only an issue for VNs that follow the basic common route -> character route structure.  As for the actual opening of the story, I prefer things to be shown rather than told when possible. Most VNs are 1st person perspective so obviously the MC will be pointing things out, but this should be more to show his opinions on characters/events/the world, rather than to establish facts, whenever possible."
visualnovels,3e42vh,ctom42,3,Tue Jul 21 20:47:07 2015 UTC,I find it funny because I really like when there is a sharp discord between common route and character route.  I also can enjoy 10 hours of establishing characters through SOL/Comedy...  I do agree with you on your 2nd part though.  I think a lot of people prefer show rather then tell.  Of course you need to explain some things but do it too much and it comes off as unnatural.
visualnovels,3e42vh,OhLookAtMeImSpecial,2,Tue Jul 21 21:27:34 2015 UTC,Yeah some common routes are a bit overbearing like Grisaia no Kajitsu but I enjoyed the common route of Rewrite a lot even though it was lengthy  When you say fluff are you talking about random events that don't matter and jokes? Sometimes I feel like that helps with characterization a little
visualnovels,3e42vh,reynaden,4,Tue Jul 21 20:55:41 2015 UTC,There's also the fact that Rewrite's common route had a ton of foreshadowing for later events which gave you just enough to hook you in but still left enough for later in the story.
visualnovels,3e42vh,Timewinders,3,Tue Jul 21 21:00:09 2015 UTC,"Fluff is anything that adds no real value beyond entertainment. Of course the point of reading VNs is to be entertained, so there is nothing wrong with fluff, but too much of it stops being entertaining.   Not all jokes/gags/random happenings are fluff. If they show you a new side of a character then they are development. However, many VNs keep doing these types of scenes over and over, to the point where you are no longer learning anything new. There is nothing added to the characters, to the plot, or to the themes. The scene could still be enjoyable, but removing it has no real impact on the story. That is fluff."
visualnovels,3e42vh,PenguinRap,3,Tue Jul 21 20:59:06 2015 UTC,"I like VNs that give you time to get attached to the characters in the start before the plot gets darker (before shit goes down). But won't drop the pace once the real story get's going. You'll know it's a good VN when you tell yourself ""just 5 more minutes then I'll take a break"" then proceed to binge read for another 2 hours.  I like the SnK method, since you get to go through the characters ""actual"" route (romance aside). It gives you space to detach yourself from the other characters and focus on one at a time, making the time spent with the heroine more memorable."
visualnovels,3e42vh,gekiganwing,3,Tue Jul 21 22:51:01 2015 UTC,"I prefer when the monologue is mixed in with the story. For example, a Character is walking to school and meets a friend, the story stops and I get an explanation of who this friend is, then the journey to school and conversation continues. If a character has knowledge give it to me when it is applicable.   I prefer when I am given a choice on heroines, I am not really a fan of unlocking routes and unlocking the true end by plowing through the other routes. Just let me pick who I want to pick.  The only example I can think of where that makes sense is fate/stay since the knowledge they give you in previous routes is needed for the other routes. There are probably other games that do something similar though."
visualnovels,3e42vh,OavatosDK,3,Tue Jul 21 23:18:47 2015 UTC,"IMO a lot of visual novels have severe pacing problems and need a good editor, maybe because Japanese video game players look for longer games whether it makes sense or not - JRPGs have this problem too, but to a lesser extent since most games use gameplay to pad the length. So I prefer if VNs dive into the story as quickly as possible. Probably the worst I've seen was Tears to Tiara 2. While I liked the game overall, the beginning starts with action and then has a 6 hour flashback before the story gets to the interesting part again. That's just bad writing. Fate/Stay Night has the same problem.  I honestly don't know why so many VNs get away with wasting so much of players' time. People complain about the 2 hour openings of Kingdom Hearts 2 and Persona 4, but IMO those accomplish quite a bit and are much faster than many visual novel openings."
visualnovels,3e42vh,ctom42,3,Wed Jul 22 02:08:10 2015 UTC,"I like to be given a lot of mysteries at the start of a vn, like with Steins;Gate or Ever17. Then I just won't wanna stop playing until I find out what the hell is going on."
visualnovels,3e42vh,Youbiseiharukana,2,Wed Jul 22 02:16:54 2015 UTC,"Is the story interesting within the first fifteen minutes? If not, I will hesitate to continue reading. Also, if I don't care about the characters/story/world within the first hour, I will probably stop reading altogether.  My overall advice for TheOwnedBagel: Look for recommendations from people who have published books, comics, video games, and so on. Listen to what other people have to say. But above all else, write the story that you want to write."
visualnovels,3e42vh,vhapteR,2,Tue Jul 21 21:31:56 2015 UTC,"I want it to be engaging fairly early on without dropping the ball soon after. I think my favorite example of an opening hook is the monologue at the start of Rewrite, but when the next few hours were just Key slapstick I didn't open the game again for nearly a year. In my ideal world the ""common route"" is short or rapidly paced so as to not make me lose interest. I guess the best way of saying it is that there needs to be a solid hook which is delivered on in a timely manner. My allowance for the inevitable slow introductory period only increases so much for a visual novel compared to other stories."

That and actually using the common route to foreshadow the various conflicts of the character routes."
visualnovels,3e42vh,GregerMoek,2,Tue Jul 21 21:54:46 2015 UTC,"Any type of start can be a good start as long as you make it work for your vn. If it's a mystery/horror/suspense vn, I'd like it to start either by diving right in or by starting slow but foreshadowing something big, kind of like making me think something's going to pop up around the corner at any moment. If it's a lighthearted vn, like a romance or comedy, then I'd like it to start with a steady but not too slow pace, and basically set the tone for the rest of the vn. If it's a sad/bleak setting, I want that to be established from the start. Slower starts for these are more acceptable.  Basically, a vn's start should set the atmosphere and mood for the rest of the vn. It shows us what to expect.  As for routes... it's generally easier to focus on getting to know one character at a time, especially in romance vns or dating sims. Then we can move comfortably from one character to another. But it all depends on what kind of vn we're talking about. Different approaches are always welcome as long as you make them work for the type of vn you're making."

visualnovels,3e1od5,Aexis_Skyen,10,Tue Jul 21 18:09:20 2015 UTC,"What's most important is that the ending fits the story. This means that it's not an ass-pull happy ending, nor is it any other form of deus ex machina nor does it have an out of place tone. The ending should flow naturally out of the climax and the rest of the story.  I used to think it was important for endings to wrap everything up. However I no longer believe that is the case. Of course no plot points or character arcs should be forgotten, but some can intentionally be left open ended. I'm not talking about sequel hooks either, I'm talking about things that are not resolved because it makes sense that the characters were unable to resolve them.  Endings don't need to be epic twists, they don't need to be especially happy or especially sad. When these elements are forced it shows. If a happy ending is fitting then the ending should be happy, but by the same token if a bittersweet, sad, or even mundane ending is called for then they should be used. The ending should not cater to the audience's expectations, but instead simply do what it needs to do to bring everything to a proper close.  This is true for endings in all works of fiction, not just VNs. Endings are one of the most important parts of a work, they are the last words from the author to the reader, the last chance to present the story's message, and the last detail that will resonate in the readers heart and mind. For that reason it's important that the ending be in line with the message and tone of the story, because any mismatch will be picked up by the reader.  Endings I thought were really well done were the Umineko's end, Steins;Gate's true end, and the end of Shizuru's route in Rewrite. However the end of Rewrite's true route is one I thought was very poorly done, because spoilers"

Since I usually stay with light hearted slice of life stories.  Since Cornetto isn't here ill say it, I liked the Chiho ending in Princess Evangile. It ended happy after some drama and it set up an idea of what the future was for the characters, it was not ambiguous. Basically my perfect ending.  Fragments Note, A VN I played on android did little epilogues for all the routes, which was a nice touch."

visualnovels,3e1od5,Officer_Catbutt,6,Tue Jul 21 11:10:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think my favorite ending of any VN I've played so far has probably been the ending of Rewrite's True end. Its just something about it. So anything that's similar to that would definitely get higher scores in my book.  I also just finished playing Muv Luv Alternative, and while the entire VN is worth the praise, I did feel the final arc rushed things a little bit too much. That said, the ending left me feeling satisfied, and while maybe not as full of closure as I was hoping, was still executed well.  I also really liked the ending of MGQ. It was never a very imaginative storyline, rather full of cliche's, but it was done well, and didn't falter at the ending. It knew what type of story it was, and kept it up all the way to the end. The fact that it didn't try to experiment and try too many new things ended up in its favor I think."
visualnovels,3e1od5,AliceFateburn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:37:17 2015 UTC,"I think my favorite ending of any VN I've played so far has probably been the ending of Rewrite's True end   I listed this as an example of doing an ending wrong. It completely threw out all of the themes and messages of the rest of the novel at the very last second. If Terra had properly worked it's way up to that conclusion it could have worked really well, but it was just thrown in at the very last second and was incredibly forced. It is possibly the worst VN ending I have read."
visualnovels,3e1od5,ctom42,6,Tue Jul 21 14:03:59 2015 UTC,"Definitely ones that give a sense of closure. Not everything may have been resolved by the end but you shouldn't be left confused by what just happened. I would prefer a happy ending but as long as it's done well I don't really care what type of ending it is.  The best ending to a route has to be the Maou-hen of muramasa. There is really nothing that compares to the feeling you get when this song plays and the final battle plays itself out. Yes the story continues for few more hours after it in another chapter, but I don't think the actual ending was as powerful as the ending in maou-hen for me.  My personal favorite to an ending of VN is ruitomo's ending. Although the some of the plot weren't fully explained, the ending gave such a satisfactory ending that I honestly didn't care too much about it. It's one of the very few VNs I've seen where all the cast says what they thought of the ordeals they went through and talk about what they will do in the future in a serious manner. Of course the reaction everyone had at the ending of the credits/ED was priceless.  Some of my least favorite endings were MLA and aiyoku no eustia. I understand why they put in that particular ending for MLA, but it felt like the writer unnecessarily put in a ""happy"" ending just for the sake of having one. For eustia, the vn just ended. I liked the vn overall but I wish they showed what happened to the cast after the events of the story. The appendix story shows some clues as to what happened to everyone but I was still disappointed."
visualnovels,3e1od5,funwithgravity,4,Tue Jul 21 13:19:22 2015 UTC,"The others covered some good stuff already. What I'll add is that I prefer endings that does not feel like something magic just happened to solve all problems. Sure, we all like endings where something unexpected happens, but let it be unexpected within the boundaries already set by the world and the VN we're reading.   An example would be if a protagonist had to defend their land in a normal medieval setting and they're heavily outnumbered. Instead of coming up with some clever defense strategy(acceptable ending) they'd run around in despair for a few days and stumble upon a case filled with ""ancient magic"" that solved every problem in a world where magic hasn't been introduced yet(bad end). This is example was perhaps a bit extreme but it was just there to show you what I mean.  Other than that I prefer happy endings but I don't mind bad ones either if they fit the story. That ties up most loose ends unless they're going for a sequel etc."

visualnovels,3e1od5,GregerMoek,4,Tue Jul 21 15:38:01 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, a novel should come full-circle with its themes. I'm fine with underdeveloped characters or unlikely situations if a particularly strong character or message comes out of it.   I enjoy when an ending addresses a deeper topic, Poverty, fulfillment, obligation, human nature etc. I'm not looking for a correct answer or dogma to bandwagon but a situation that questions one's positions on these topics.   I prefer a somewhat bittersweet but hopeful ending to a ""everything is perfect"" ending because I see sadness as a good compliment to joy. I think it makes the conflicts, struggles and triumphs more meaningful, which usually results in a more wholesome feeling of hope at the end.    are there any endings that you didn't particularly like too well?   Ever17's didn't sit too well with me. Don't get me wrong, I loved the fantastic mystery execution. But I thought the end could've gone in a more meaningful direction.   Reversing that, are there any endings I liked particularly?  I loved Sekien no Inganock's conclusion. It felt like the answer to a question that was whispered throughout the game."

visualnovels,3e1od5,vhapteR,7,Wed Jul 22 01:01:14 2015 UTC,"I suppose the ending depends on the type of vn, but in general, I like an ending to give me a feeling of closure. If I feel as though I've been left hanging (and there's no sequel), then I feel dissatisfied. Also, and this might be for a vn as a whole as well, it should be paced such that it doesn't feel rushed, and they aren't trying to tie up all the loose ends all at once.  As for happy or sad endings, either is fine as long as it's well executed. It depends on the type of vn and what I'm hoping to achieve from it. For example, Sora's ending in Ever17 . On the other hand, if any of the KS good endings had been sad, I'd have rage quit the game, because that's not what I'm playing a game like KS for. On that note, Shizune's ending was quite meh, but probably because the route as a whole felt forced. Lilly's ending was way too cliche and happy-go-lucky, so I suppose I prefer endings that are more believable."

Now, if he were talking about a ""pick a girl to date"" game like Lovely Cation than I'd agree with him, but we're not. Why play games about cripples, personality problems, and hard lives if you want happy endings?    if any of the KS good endings had been sad, I'd have rage quit the game, because that's not what I'm playing a game like KS for"

For me the most important part about ending is reflecting what characters have learned and changed throughout a story.  Maybe characters will be all happy, maybe they will be all suffer, but at least readers can learn a thing or two from it.  For example, Komomo in Hoshizora no Memoria : Spoiler  Of course some endings might have no moral lesson at all, but if game makers don't make endings too unreasonable cruel or too far-fetched happy then I'm good with it."

For a total ending for a game or series though, I want it to feel concluded. I want thematic threads to be resolved and to feel like it said and did what it wanted to. I don't necessarily need to see how everyone lives happily ever after, but I want to feel like the conflict whatever it may be is resolved meaningfully enough for whatever portion of it we saw that impacted our characters."
visualnovels,3e1od5,OavatosDK,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:37:58 2015 UTC,"For me it only needs to ""conclude"" stuff, like finishing the argument if the focus of the VN is thematic, or some kind of ending reflection by the character(s) if the VN is character-driven, or to see all the engines from the plot coming together if it plot-driven, or if ends on a strong emotional note. And i like epilogues, even when they are useless, just to see a little aftermath.  Fate is a good example on how happy endings can be badly done, most of the endings relied on deus ex machinas that were too out of place, besides undermining the whole theme. I even prefer happy endings, but these in no way feels earned (like MLA per example)."

Further down in the comments:   Ethan: Looking back on this playtest, I was a little bit hard on the game.  It was my first Visual Novel playtest for the website. I've done more since this have a better feel for the genre and how it normally works now.   WEE's a three-part coming-of-age tale made by a doujin circle. But reviewers often seem to consider ep. 1 the entirety of WEE. As an economics major, Ethan had a good idea on how ep. 1 could've presented the material on the stock market better with more visuals.   People's first impressions of the protagonist are fairly correct. But showing how a self-centered, naive child grows up is a decent payoff. I think a lot of people got hung up on his immaturity without treating ep. 1 as a kind of prologue.   In my opinion, all three parts should be played together but parts 1 & 2 still give a good feel for how the protagonist matures."

If the future of the partnership is riding on a single title, Haruka seems like a pretty good bet given Mangagamer's current customer base.  In contrast, a low-resolution unvoiced title like Rance VI could be considered a gamble."
visualnovels,3e0wuh,herkz,3,Tue Jul 21 08:24:02 2015 UTC,"Oh, there's an audience for Haruka. It's just not the people who like Rance games, so it feels pretty disingenuous to market it like ""If you want to see official localizations of Rance games, please buy Haruka!"" Which they are doing. Or at least were. They should probably stop that, though."
visualnovels,3e0wuh,mud074,2,Tue Jul 21 16:15:18 2015 UTC,"It might be irritating, but it's not disingenuous.  The fate of the partnership likely does hinge on how this first title does.  Would I buy Haruka if I had no interest in the title itself?  Probably not!  But it's not like Mangagamer is trying to hold the Rance series hostage.  They're simply doing the best they can with the cards they've been dealt.  Rance fans can support Haruka for what it is, support it in hopes of seeing Rance games, or hold off and hope that Mangagamer picked a viable title that will do well without their support."

But the reason why won't matter if it all falls through and these Rance games that are nearly translated aren't released for a long time or ever.   hope that Mangagamer picked a viable title that will do well without their support.

The only comparable title I can spot is Evenicle, and that was probably off the table.  Haruka is a solid pick, and I don't see why Mangagamer would be unsatisfied with it.  The grumblings of the Rance VI translator who ended up working on Haruka shouldn't be misconstrued to represent the consensus of the company."
visualnovels,3e0wuh,haerts,5,Tue Jul 21 19:39:39 2015 UTC,"How does that make it not true? People are annoyed because they went from having a near certain chance of being able to play untranslated Rance games in the near future (around a year) to possibly never being able to play them at all simply because Mangagamer licensed a title that nobody really cared about by the same people. Even if everything goes perfectly and the Rance titles get licensed, it will still be years before they come out. Hell, there's a not too unlikely chance of the licensing of the Rance games never happening and the translations being stuck in limbo never to be released."

A fan translation project gives you one game in English (maybe, if the fan translators don't give up halfway through).  A partnership brings the promise of multiple games in English.  And a partnership with a big player like Alicesoft opens up new possibilities for gameplay eroge translation.  There's bigger things at stake than just the Rance series here.  If the visual novel community is to continue to grow and the pace of translation to continue increasing, we can't rely on fan translations forever.  By supporting Japanese companies who officially release titles in English, we take one step closer to a day when English releases within a couple years of the Japanese release are commonplace, and when our favorite companies aren't forced to close their doors or stop making games because Japanese sales weren't enough to keep them afloat (RIP Overflow)."

Kanon too, although I'm kind of bummed that I didn't nominate Air. I didn't think either of them would stand a chance, but here we are.  It made me think though. Since we have one row for newbie recommendations, why not have one for VNs that aren't AS recommended for newbies? Forest definitely belongs on that list, and Cross Channel too to a lesser degree. Grisaia may not be perfect as a starter VN either due to its length, same goes for Umineko. Saya no Uta is disturbing to say the least, and Hanachirasu might be a little too much to chew for a beginner. And why not just list the VNs in order of newbie friendliness at the same time (horizontally)? Thoughts?"
visualnovels,3dxllt,LeafCascade,7,Mon Jul 20 12:29:01 2015 UTC,"Horrors VN's are meant to be disturbing, i don't think anyone looking for a cute moe story about 2 people falling in love would pick Saya no Uta.  Saya no Uta is short and has very few choices, the writing is top notch and it has good graphics and all, so it's perfect for a beginner who's looking for horror stuff, the same goes for Hanachirasu.  What i mean is: not all the beginners are looking for romance or slice of life stories, if you want to read a horror story you're most likely prepared for gory and unsettling stuff. Different people have different tastes, some might get turned off by violence whilst some might not  TLDR: it's horror so it's completely normal that it's disturbing, if Hoshimemo were meant to be horror VN it'd be terrible, but it's romance oriented so it's fine.  Regarding Umineko, i heard that it's quite lenghty (100+ hours??) and to someone who's not used to reading it might feels like the VN is never ending. I also heard that there are much (so many they're basically uncountable) characters, a beginner may find it difficult to remember who they are and what they did, not sure if it'd actually suggest it to a newbie."
visualnovels,3dxllt,FrightFright,7,Mon Jul 20 15:34:24 2015 UTC,"With the old 4chan recommendation image Saya no Uta was simply listed as a starter, no other qualifications given. This (IMO) was not ok, and a I have spoken with people who were turned off from the medium in general because they started with it.   However since they are sorted by genre, as you say Saya no Uta may not be a bad starter for horror. Personally I think it's still a little intense, but I could see an argument for it.  Umineko is indeed long and has a large cast, but the characters are by no means uncountable. In fact I could list all of them by name except for an extremely small set of very unimportant side characters. That group aside every one of Umineko's characters are unique and important so most people don't have any trouble keeping track of them.   But yeah I would not list Umineko as a starter (though I do have a friend who has only read Umineko as far as VNs go)."
visualnovels,3dxllt,ctom42,3,Mon Jul 20 15:46:31 2015 UTC,I was thinking more about the fact that Saya is a loli and that there are plenty of sex scenes.

Of course before suggesting a VN you have to tell the one you're suggesting it to if it's going to be a moege, a dating sim or a sci-fi novel so they don't end up thinking "" what the hell am reading, i've never asked for any of this""  Obviously that's just my opinion (what i'd do), i don't know if am the exception and actually most people would instantly stop reading and never touch a VN again if their very first VN were to be something more ""unique"" like Saya no Uta, but aren't opinions wonderful exactly because everyone has their owns and none of them are wrong?"

I know several people who refuse to read VNs because of a bad experience with Saya no Uta. I also have a friend who thinks all VNs take forever because he started with Umineko.

However, there are plenty of people who have this type of thinking with video games, tabletop roleplaying, heck even books. People who only read books that were required for school often hate books because most of those books are pretty dry. Experiences like movies and TV shows are familiar to us so we don't make broad assumptions based on one experience.

So that's why I went for that. MLA is one of the greatests VNs IMO but the weaknesses it has(long buildup for example) can be challenging for a newbie to deal with I think. Steins;Gate also has a great glossary to make use of if someone isn't used to all words like 'tsundere' and terms like that. Sure it's easy to google but still.   The only thing I can think of that might be in Steins;Gate's problem for a newbie would be the choice mechanics and how hard it is to get to the true ending because of some of the obscure mail-choices. Muv-Luv should definitely be in the recommended list, but I don't think it fits as the newbie pick. That is all."

visualnovels,3dxllt,superange128,7,Mon Jul 20 12:04:52 2015 UTC,Hm so when deciding newbie ratings I'm thinking of taking the following into account:   how short it is how deep its themes are ease to get into for the genre compared to others if it has a (popular) anime adaptation how popular it is in general how much it costs (free vns will get a big newbie score upgrade) how complicated the route/choice structure is   How is everyone else going to vote for that?
visualnovels,3dxllt,OavatosDK,9,Mon Jul 20 14:51:46 2015 UTC,"I looked at it as sort of ""how anime is it"" in terms of weird anime tropey stuff that can be incredibly offputting to new people. Another general line of comparison was ""how long does it take to become actively engaging"" to most people who don't care for incredibly common dumb slapstick style comedy.   In other words, Katawa Shoujo and Ace Attorney got 10s for newbie ratings. Narcissu got a 9, F/sn got 7, Grisaia a 5, and Muv-Luv all the way down at 1. These examples sort of display my biases for rating that category.  Bullet 2 is something that bothers me a lot when people organize newbie recommendations (more common in various anime communities). Something being ""deep"" or ""complicated"" isn't a reason for someone to not engage with it. We're not recommending things to children who can't process unique ideas, and strong stories/characters shine through regardless of thematic depth, as shown by how NGE was a starter anime for almost a whole generation. Yet now people are like ""WHAT ANIME NOT TO RECOMMEND TO NEWBIES"" and people will go ""CAN'T DO NGE, 3DEEP5EVERYONE""."

With anime I am a firm believer that there is no such thing as a starter anime. There are some anime that are not for starters but that is mostly because of the tropes and weird shit.   However I do think that when making a list for VNs it's a bit different. VNs are a lot like books. You would not start someone on the Odyssey when they have not read any novels yet. A thing I've noticed is that a lot of people who are new to VNs are actually quite familiar with anime tropes, but are not big readers. The reason for this is one of the biggest ways VNs get exposure is through anime adaptations. So I would not put Umineko as a starter VN for a chart like this as it can be quite intimidating, but I would recommend it personally to people I know could handle it, regardless of whether they are new to the genre."

So I would not put Umineko as a starter VN for a chart like this as it can be quite intimidating, but I would recommend it personally to people I know could handle it, regardless of whether they are new to the genre.   I actually gave it one of the higher newbie ratings because to me the only detractor was the significant length, but if a new person is recommended to it as though it is a series of books rather than a giant singular volume that length issue goes away for the most part. Additionally it's appealing on multiple levels to nearly everyone regardless of their existing tolerance for ""anime-isms"" thanks in part to the very western setting and lack of slapstick. More than anything though I think something being good, likeable, and easy to get into for a wide variety of people is the most important thing for a ""newbie"" work. As much as I'd like to deny it, most VNs fail spectacularly at that third category (and Umineko succeeds spectacularly at all three of them)."

Did you read ctom42's reply? It's blind luck.  And most of all, it isn't a good representation of the genre in general, which mostly comprises simple choices.

Someone isn't going to be turned off because they have a great fucking 40~ hour read, find out ""oh shit that wasn't the perfect end"" and decide they don't want to read VNs anymore after they just look up a walkthrough for it. Look at all the people who have to look up how to get the best ending for Persona 4, they don't dislike the game for it (and it's a hell of a lot easier to get that one)."

But you can tolerate a different system better.  A new player's situation is different from more experienced ones. When I think of newbie-friendly, I think of something that's a good representation of the genre as a whole, which encourages him to explore more VNs, some with more intricacies and more unique game mechanics like the phone trigger system. In this manner, it can be thought of as exploring variations on a musical theme. No one ever starts out on a variation, at least, not in music. That's why a game like Katawa Shoujo or G-senjou is better, because they don't give the impression that VNs have complicated route choices (which, let me tell you, will overwhelm a lot of people if they're just getting started) nor will it encourage people to think that you need a guide just to play it.  But these are recommendations, after all.

In this manner, it can be thought of as exploring variations on a musical theme. No one ever starts out on a variation, at least, not in music.    It pretty clearly displays your attitude, that someone has to ""learn"" VNs. However, a person who is just listening to niche music isn't learning by starting on a variation, they're just listening to a song and thinking it sounds cool. They aren't then going to dismiss all other music for being too ""normal"" nor will they refuse to listen to any other song because they're too ""unusual"".   Stop assuming the average new reader is some uneducated lowest common denominator. Most people who read their first VN have probably read countless books, watched movies, and played god knows how many video games. More than anything new people would want something good to read that is engaging on an accessible level from early on. Something that makes them want to read more things. Katawa Shoujo and G-sen are both good choices for that same reason. Saying Steins;Gate isn't good for that because of a complicated choice system doesn't make sense.

But just on this tangential note, if you're going to, a person who is listening to some obscure artist almost certainly has listened to more popular ones. First impressions matter with a genre like VNs, and with something so ubiquitous as music, first impressions don't exist.   Who is assuming that the new reader is an uneducated toddler? No one. Because length isn't an issue here, and movies and regular video games have little relation to VNs anyway. No one is asserting that a new reader has no capacity to comprehend what's going on. The only difference between us and them is that they don't have any idea what a visual novel has to offer. It doesn't matter if they've read 20,000 books, caught up with all the popular TV shows, or have a degree in physics. They are as knowledgeable about VNs as the rural Indian kid without electricity.  You think that I think that VNs are something to be learned. Far from it. They're only something to get used to, which happens in any medium. Reading text on a screen. Minimal interaction. The whole purpose of this newbie friendly rating is to determine what is the easiest way for new players to get used to that. And the fact that you mentioned that people would be disappointed when most other VNs are less interactive is one of the reasons why I tend to shy away from Steins;Gate when recommending to beginners. Because it's not quite representative of the genre as a whole.   If anything that would be a positive for S;G specifically in the sense that people would be disappointed afterwards that most VN's are far less interactive in comparison.   It's extremely subjective. There will be people that will favor less interaction, like the story but say meh at the phone trigger (""It was confusing at first, but then I got used to it""), or get put off by the impression that you need a walkthrough to finish the true route.   People want to beat the game on their own, and even for someone that has been told that VNs aren't really games, they'll perceive the true route ending as a goal to get on their own. At least I do. There's nothing bad about the side routes or the phone trigger in reality. But that's not what is perceived by new readers.   Look at all the people who have to look up how to get the best ending for Persona 4, they don't dislike the game for it   It doesn't mean anything if it's not the first game in the genre they played. Of course we love Steins;Gate, even with the realization that we need a walkthrough. Yet if we're talking about popular/highly rated VNs, our opinions of the game don't mean much, though.   Basically, S;G is a far better choice than anything with a long grating school-life comedy slapstick common route.   Well I don't disagree with you there, since I wasn't saying that school-life slapstick was better. But as for me, Steins;Gate is pretty good as first choice, though not the best.

Even if somebody can see past the complicated system and appreciate the phenomenal story they will likely ruin their overall VN journey. Opening a walk-through 40 hours down the line to get the absolute best ending will make them never want to open something again.""  If hyperbolic, that's what you said amounts to. I guess we do have to agree to disagree, since I consider someone who is actually going to open the game someone open minded enough to not quit when they see a phone email prompting them to do stuff, and I consider that by the point they finally get to the ""normal"" end they'll not start hating everything because they had to look up how to get the best end. The most important thing for a newbie game is actually getting them to spend the 40 hours it would take. Oh well.  I suppose in the end we have a very different mindset. I want a person I'm introducing to VNs to have a great time and look forward to trying out other exciting stories and I assume they're decently willing to try out something new so I'm not gently force-feeding them like the ten hour tutorial in FFXIII. I don't have value in deliberately holding back a work because of arbitrary reasons like it being unique.   I'm not saying S;G is the best starter VN. I'm saying it's still a great option, probably the best of that whole Sci-Fi row anyway (since Planetarian's only selling point is that it is short).  Also I know what a variation is, I just translated the core idea over to a broader genre scale because it's more functionable as an example because your analogy was pretty much a strawman since something being different than other different yet similar works isn't the same as it being an altered version of the same work."

visualnovels,3dxllt,ctom42,2,Mon Jul 20 17:26:14 2015 UTC,"The description should generally be a hook to get readers interested in the plot. But we might have a few exceptions for gameplay heavy VNs, as you don't necessarily play those VNs for the plot."

visualnovels,3dxllt,vhapteR,3,Mon Jul 20 18:02:03 2015 UTC,"Umineko and F/SN recommended for newbies?   The entire chart is not for newbies. There is going to be a newbie rec for each genre. The chart is intended to be our version of the 4chan chart, which is just general recommendations.   Chaos;Head is there for some reason?   I'm as surprised as you are. I think the fact that not being able to vote against something is part of the reason. C;H received no vote from me, which is the same as everything I had not read, but I would have loved to be able to say ""This VN is terrible, -10"""
visualnovels,3dxllt,superange128,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:08:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I was disappointed to see True Remembrance didn't make it too. Unfortunately it was up against some other great VNs and as it's a bit of a mix of genres it didn't really shine through.   Umineko and F/SN recommended for newbies? These are by far the longest VNs I can think of.   The current newbie selections are random. We're running a poll now to determine which VN should be the newbie pick.
visualnovels,3dxllt,superange128,2,Mon Jul 20 18:25:50 2015 UTC,"I felt like Chaos;Head Noah was unexpectedly awesome, it's much much better than Chaos;Head since it adds some awesome side routes, which i liked even better than the true route.  Takumi is a very interesting protagonist, Sena is best girl and she has the best backstory, Nanami has the best route with some mind screwing turns, Ayase is an awesome chuuni girl (her route is batshit crazy), Yua is alright and there's a decent plot twist in her route (we all saw it coming i guess), Kozue is adorable and C;H Spoiler and Rimi is... alright (her route is quite good though).  However, it isn't a visual novel i'd recommend to a beginner, since it isn't for everyone (and Chaos;Head Noah isn't translated yet), many people might not be able to bear with Takumi's personality and would end up hating him (you have to put yourself into his shoes to understand or start to like him) so i agree with you there.  True remembrance is much shorter and way easier to get into than Chaos;Head is."
visualnovels,3dxllt,MotivatedRed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:53:42 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say F/SN is a bad pick for newbies. My first visual novel was Fortissimo (basically, a F/SN clone) and it got me totally hooked. It depends on what you like imo.  Once you get past the first 3 days, it's not hard to get into it. The setting is interesting, some of the characters are very likeable, all servants have cool moves, the status screen looks awesome with all those stats, etc.   The length seems like an issue at first, but is it really? All routes are pretty much a complete story with proper closure. For instance, you can easily take a break once you've finished your 30-hour journey through Fate. It doesn't make the whole journey any shorter, I won't deny that... but what I'm trying to say is, it's somewhat manageable.  Let's compare that to Ever17. I've seen a LP where the person took about 11 hours to finish the first route. Much less time right? But the sense of completeness is a little different. It's there to a certain extent, but you can't just stop right there. Ever17 only feels like it's truly over when you finish the last route.  Maybe I'm an exception though, so I dunno. :P  As for Chaos;Head, I have to agree with you. It has some pretty awesome ideas and concepts, but the visual novel itself wasn't quite as good."

Yumina's gameplay just isn't very fun, and the story in the second half takes a nosedive into some of the shallowest sci-fi drama I've encountered in an RPG--and that's coming from someone who's a fan of the Star Ocean series."
visualnovels,3dxllt,LeafCascade,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:27:29 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I wouldn't consider Aselia's gameplay to be that great either.  It's the sort of game that looks like there are lots of options, but in actuality almost all of them are absolutely awful decisions.  Giving it points for a better story, though, I won't argue with that.  I like Aselia more but I tend to feel like people in general would prefer Yumina.  I'd be fine with either of them on the list."
visualnovels,3dxllt,ieya404,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:27:07 2015 UTC,I'm completely disagree. I loved Yumina's gameplay and really liked the direction the story went. On the other hand I have a copy of Aselia installed and can't get into it at all due to its age. I think Yumina is a much better option for newbies.

Worth noting the CSS Tricks chap observed:   Not a lot of people who have extremely wide monitors have their browser window open that wide. I know I don't.   Guess we're both guilty of assuming everyone else does things similarly to how we personally do, though!  In terms of resolutions out there, possibly also worth considering the wider world beyond steam - looking at http://gs.statcounter.com/#resolution-ww-monthly-201406-201506 it looks like 1920x1080 represents a little under 12% of the general browser market, with no higher resolutions offering a significant share at all.

The space on the recommendation image for the content & technical tags is pretty tiny, so we're going to probably be a bit flexible about which tags go into which entries so as to try and fit stuff in. I expect the content tags will mostly be listing more specific subgenres the VN fits (such as ""superheroes"" for Fate/Stay night), and the technical tags will list whether a VN has sexual content and whether it has choices."

visualnovels,3dwkp3,cultureselect_ceo,13,Mon Jul 20 03:19:38 2015 UTC,"Which visual novel companies seem the most interested in the American market, which ones seem most apathetic, and do any seem openly hostile to it? How do Japanese fans respond to their favorite games getting releases overseas (do they even know about it?), and do any of the superfans resent things like kickstarter bonuses that only the American fans have access to?  Do you think that localized releases will ever become the standard for major Visual Novels, to the point where the translations for those projects is already underway before the Japanese release? Do you ever think that concurrent multinational releases will become an industry standard practice for the big names? Or do you think that localization will continue to only be possible for games that have already proven themselves in the Japanese market?"
visualnovels,3dwkp3,therationalpi,13,Mon Jul 20 06:15:37 2015 UTC,"Okay, last question for tonight then! (I might check briefly tomorrow night like Taedirk recommended, though.)  Like I stated earlier, I think Japanese visual novel companies are waking up to global releases.  I'd say the most major catalyst for that was the Japanese government offering a grant to companies that expand internationally.  Companies can apply with their global proposals or work or previous international releases and obtain funding for doing more of it.  The unfortunate side of this is that a lot of companies are just using the money to do events in nearby Singapore or Korea to qualify as international as opposed to really going beyond South East Asia.  That being said, the developers that do go with major releases in the private industry do announce it.  For example, recently I saw that the developers of SonoHanabira announced their partnership with MangaGamer on a NicoNicoDouga livecast. I think the Japanese fans are impressed by it, but not necessarily interested or intrigued, but it's different for everyone and their views on global society.  More speculation, but I think at best the Japanese fans see it as a way they could study English, at worst ""oh no more tourists in Akiba.""  Concurrent multinational releases are a major goal of mine.  Not just as a player in the visual novel industry - as a linguist and as a person - that would be my ultimate goal.  Not just Japanese and English either, if a game can come out and be ready in English, Japanese, Spanish, French, Russian, Chinese, Korean, Portuguese...right off the bat?  That's a service I'd love to provide to game developers.    Thank you everyone, this was really fun! - ☆☆☆John"

If the Wish Kickstarter were to not succeed, it would admit-tingly be a setback. Financially it'll slow down our progress.  Culture Select has been funded to date exclusively on the investment of myself and the directors, and we all have full time work in addition to what we're doing with out start-up.  Getting setup with all the different avenues for publishing is something we want available and to offer people.  One thing we're planning is to offer services to both developers and people that help differentiate ourselves from our competitors and are useful to everyone as a community.  We want to offer translation services as well, but keep it in the anime-doujin community.  Though we definitely are aiming for success on Wish!

I get the impression that Japanese eroge developers may not even realize that their competitors are releasing games in English.  Is that a false impression, or are Japanese companies actually that unaware of what's going on overseas?  How much of a barrier to overseas releases is the ""Not for sale outside Japan"" mentality among professional Japanese eroge developers?"

In college I took a lot of political science classes, and the setting to Sharin no Kuni woke me up the political theories around prison reform.  I don't want to post any spoilers, but the idea of their society accepting those rules, the public patches they wear, and the main character being a social worker to enforce all of that was simply amazing to me.    As a graduate of International Studies, I don't know if a system like that could work in all countries in the world, but I'd love to see a major one try something interesting.    2) Yup, that's a business we definitely want to be apart of!"

visualnovels,3dwkp3,Taedirk,15,Mon Jul 20 14:01:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting, Cultureselect_ceo. Four questions, for when you have time...   What do you think of visual novels as a way to tell a story? Think about what you like/dislike about other story telling formats, such as prose, comics, and interactive fiction. I know that it's easy to throw visual novels under the bus since many VNs are love polygon stories, and since many VNs are porn without plot. How have you dealt with this? What do you think about the risks and rewards of publishing on consoles? I ask this as a person who plans to purchase the translated Playstation Vita port of Hatoful Boyfriend in a few days. Likewise, I ask this as person who chose to import a translated console version of Steins;Gate. What do you think about the risks and rewards of publishing on iOS and Android devices?"
visualnovels,3dwkp3,HyruliEnt,15,Mon Jul 20 04:00:44 2015 UTC,"This is a topic I really love talking about.  1) Visual Novels in my opinion are the best medium for story-telling hands down.  I don't know what it is about human nature, but movies and animation don't immerse me the way a visual novel or even a normal book does.    I think in movies and television, everything is presented to you, so there isn't much to think about it.  It's fairly selfish on the part of the author - they get to decide how you feel about every scene.  In the same way - books are very selfish on part of the reader in fiction!  It gives you total control to perceive and you could easily miss the intentions of the author.  Even though the concept that a book can be perceived differently by every reader is the wonderful part about written word, I think using the tools we have today to tell stories is powerful - because we can append pictures, art, and music!  Visual Novels in my opinion are so much more immersive for story telling.  They can be very long and you can build a relationship with the characters, even make choices that effect their well-being.  I think that connection and the character sprites make visual novels especially good at character-driven stories. ""What is he going to do?"" ""How is she going to react?"" And at the most pivotal of moments in the story, you also get to choose the course of events in a lot of visual novels.  These kind of super doki-doki moments make it my favorite medium for story telling!  I think the author should have the right to play a bgm that sets the mood, or show how their characters are reacting, but the imagination of the story flow and perception of events come from the player.  I think the reason Fate/Stay Night is so successful is they do such a good job of executing this.  For example, the battle between Archer and Lancer at the start (even though you don't see fighting you're imagining it stronger with just some of the visual and audio cues than even a strong studio like UFO table could ever animate it.) The TV-static in Heaven's Feel with Shirou, disrupting the BGMs you've grown so attached to for 60+ hours? That was genius.   2) The same way everyone else has - show them a good example of a non-nukige and make a strong recommendation.  In terms of business, people who hate really visual novels just simply aren't our customers (at the moment), so we don't fret about it too much.  3) There's some risks in console publishing. I did release management for Playism, working with companies like Sony and Nintendo.  It's fairly difficult at first and console publishers have an outright legal-textbook level of regulations.  I can't talk about the details of this process (due to NDA) but in my experience it was challenging work.  I think there's a ton of risk of delays.  If you're going to buy something, really send thanks to the staff member who worked for months to push it through Sony.  It's tough.  I think the biggest reward you get as a console publisher is access to a much more general market and can bring newer fans, which might explain why so many companies (Sekai Project, Playism) seem to be moving in that direction from their public kickstarters and releases, respectively.  4) Mobile Publishing is much easier to setup, but because it's easier there's a lot more competition.  Having a successful mobile release is like winning the lottery.  I don't have the sales numbers, but I speculate even great games like Clannad did not-so-great on mobile."
visualnovels,3dwkp3,Taedirk,2,Mon Jul 20 04:40:36 2015 UTC,"Touching on question #3, there's a game called Eiyuu*Senki which seems to be getting a PS3 port release in the US by a company called Fruitbat Factory. And there are a lot of other VN-themed RPG games like Persona Arena, Tears to Tiara 2, XBlaze Code: Embryo that have recently been released in the US market and been met with a reasonable degree of success. I also noticed that even Rance series is being targeted as potential VNs to be released in the US. The question is: is Culture Select interested in releasing these types of RPG/VN games in the future? Or will they be staying rooted in the more pure VN type of games that doesn't delve too deep into the other genres?"

visualnovels,3dwkp3,BairaagiVN,23,Mon Jul 20 03:46:04 2015 UTC,"That's a lot of good questions Taedirk...  1) Okay, so, if I may make a couple Star Trek universe reference, I kinda see the the market like this...  MangaGamer I see as a powerful company like the Klingons.  The Klingons have their own honor code and are a warrior race.  I see MangaGamer's focus on 18+ works and how strongly their staff react to the community without a lot of finesse but with a lot of strength w  They're definitely a powerful powerhouse.    SekaiProject I sort've see as the Romulan race.  They are powerful, they have Warbirds, but their practices and dealings are shrouded in mystery.  Their methodology is extremely effective and secret.   You also have JAST, which is backed by J-List.  I almost see them like the Ferengi, they are powerful traders but they don't enter the fray too often.  When they do they have powerful titles.  Playism is almost like the Federation of the market - they publish hundreds of small doujin games and there is strength in that group.  At Culture Select, we're kind've like the Bajorans on Deep Space 9.  We only have one space station and as a start-up have to go with the flow of who is in power, and are open to trade with everyone.  Our goal is to expand localization, so we're an amplifier of sorts going out to the Spanish and French market.    I spent a really long time on just the first question, so let me answer some other ones and I'll get the next few.  For #5 though, it's too hard to think about, but on r/visualnovels/ - the WtK Mikan flair is the best flair w"
visualnovels,3dwkp3,vaendryl,20,Mon Jul 20 04:08:32 2015 UTC,"Alright - sorry about the wait Taedirk!  2) The current market condition in the West is a lot better then hardcore fans here might speculate.  I think that Japanese developers are starting to realize this after the Clannad Kickstarter.  My sincere desire is that Japanese developers visit the West more, and start to consider their foreign audience in development.  I think as companies, they are starting to realize that it is important they make the shift to the global market and keep that in mind.  Overdrive making Go! Go! Nippon is a great example of this shift, and I'm enjoying it.  I also think it's great that companies like MangaGamer are bringing R07 to multiple events in the West, so Ryukishi can see the differences.  I know Gen Urobuchi enjoyed his trip to Otakon a few years back as well.    I think visual novels are tough middle-man work that require a lot of good communication.  In the past, dealing with the reaction to romance visual novels on Steam, and the xenophobia of the developers, was extremely difficult and thankless work on both sides.  Now I see both developers and resellers like Valve are really warming up to the idea of publishing more visual novels.    For the record, I really hate censorship and the effect it has on developers and content-creators.  3) No comment.  I think the market has developed in the West really well in the last three years and the general customer is a lot more well-informed than they were pre-2010, ourselves included.  I'd rather overestimate you guys than overestimate my own experiences.  4) I actually talked with a few developers as to why they don't use engines like Ren'Py or Unity more often.  Here's some responses I've actually gotten while at Comiket:  Ren'py - The engine is amazing, but enough documentations and examples don't exist in Japanese.  Other visual novel engines have thousands of plugins and basically everything I need is available to me, and it's just a matter of looking it up.  Unity - Starting from scratch would take me years to learn, and I couldn't survive off the initial games I make/program.    So it usually just comes down to that if they do it as their hobby, they don't have enough time, and they do it is as their full-time work, they wouldn't make enough money to survive until next comiket.  I think this is why you see so many RPGMaker games and derivatives.  The stigma against that stuff isn't as strong in Japan as it is in the US.    5) :1 pout pout - that's a tough question! If you want to talk about a specific game I can tell you my favorite characters.  I suppose if I had to choose one, I'd choose Kohaku.  To your edit, Maybe, I decided to this today because it's a national holiday in Japan, 海の日"

visualnovels,3dtb8a,reallybigshrimp,14,Sun Jul 19 09:10:06 2015 UTC,"Nice post.  I’m on the side that enjoyed Yumiko’s route a lot even if I felt that her flashback scene dragged on and with the whole ridiculousness of that turkey scene.  My memory is a bit hazy about the route but I like how we come to find out that Yumiko’s father was treated the same way he treated Yumiko (being used as tool to further the family business). He was another lonely person who may have treated Yumiko differently if his father had shown him any kindness. It led me to sympathise with him and I couldn’t really do that with the antagonists from the other routes.   Just like how Yuuji showed Yumiko a kindness that allowed her to reveal her softer side, Yumiko showed her father a kindness by forgiving him and allowing him to reveal his softer side. We see this love and compassion breaking a viscous cycle of hate.   Just like you said about Yumiko and Yuuji, her father was able to regain a part of what it means to be human.  You’re really tempting me to reread Yumiko’s route with your post.  Good job."
visualnovels,3dtb8a,Shotgun_Diplomacy,12,Sun Jul 19 09:27:16 2015 UTC,"I think Yumiko's romance with Yuuji was the most natural one. With that said I don't think her route was the most interesting one, but it was the one that made most sense. What's good though is that we all have different opinions about it, discussions gets so much more fun then! Trying to see things from other people's perspective is rewarding even if it's only about VN route preferences."
visualnovels,3dtb8a,GregerMoek,6,Sun Jul 19 10:50:04 2015 UTC,"This is so true, in the other routes the romance feels so forced: in Amane's route GnK, in Sachi's GnK, in Michiru's GnK, whilst Yumiko's is perfect, i just pretend the turkey scene doesn't exist and it's all good.  Let's forget Makina's has h-scenes too, sigh."
visualnovels,3dtb8a,FrightFright,5,Sun Jul 19 12:25:09 2015 UTC,"I didnt feel the rest were forced. Frankly, I liked the motivations of the romances for the rest pf the routes.  Exxxcept Makinas. The romance was forced. I liked it better when it was onii-chan/papa relationship."

visualnovels,3dtb8a,FrightFright,9,Mon Jul 20 10:21:09 2015 UTC,"Overall I think Yumiko's back story is the more realistic among the heroines, since it's a very plausible scenario. In the other route's, Yumiko is seen as a leader and a figure of authority in the dorm, but here we see she can be very weak at times (Telephone call to her dad). I agree with your point that Yuuji is more human in this route (his body breaking down from manual labor). Her ending is probably the happiest you can get in game, keeping the academy, her friends, Yuuji while forgiving her father, who was her biggest enemy since birth...everything is resolved, Disney would be proud."
visualnovels,3dtb8a,OhLookAtMeImSpecial,7,Sun Jul 19 10:24:25 2015 UTC,Amen! Kuudere is the best dere
visualnovels,3dtb8a,coolezzz,8,Sun Jul 19 11:12:07 2015 UTC,"The first part of Yumiko's route reminds me of a really bad hollywood movie, where they continue to go to the exact spot of danger over and over again, and the baddies literally level up over time, culminating in a scene where.. all logic and physics is thrown out the window and yuuji hits a plane with a frozen turkey.   Then Yumiko's personality takes a complete 90, and instead of focusing on anything of impotance, its instead focused on Yumiko The Housewife, who is a weak, pathetic woman who can't do :anything: correct, to the point where she even calls the person they are trying to escape due to her own feeling of worthlessness. It's.. insane. It's badly written nonsense, where the writer took a potentially cool character and turned her into a B action movie heroine who needs Her Man. Let's not even mention the ending, which is the writing equivalent of 'YOU HAVE ACTIVATED MY TRAP CARD' without actually ever showing Yuuji lay the card down in the first place.  Honestly, I never disliked Yumiko from the common route, and I liked her alot in Makina's route. She's really proactive there. Hell, she's even more proactive in :Sachi's: route than she is her own. But I think her route is so, so terribly written that it honestly boggles my mind how anyone likes it. I guess her writer is.. a web designer, normally, IIRC? So take that as you will."
visualnovels,3dtb8a,Wahfuu,3,Sun Jul 19 21:21:19 2015 UTC,"Were you expecting her to be a badass though? I always viewed Yumiko as an insecure person who had difficulty accepting pieces of who she was, I think anything but a breakdown would have been rather unrealistic and boring. It makes sense that she is more stable in the routes she isnt featured in, so are characters like Michiru who never display their pathology in other routes. They're not really being challenged at all."
visualnovels,3dtb8a,Wahfuu,3,Sun Jul 19 21:44:23 2015 UTC,"I always thought that she was anxiety riddled and pretty scared on the inside, sure, but she's displayed as also being pragmatic and smart, if not a bit on the airheaded side occasionally. The pragmatic and smart is then completely replaced with 'useless' and it focuses on nothing but her failures as a housewife instead of.. anything else.  Even if by some miracle that Yumiko's character were more consistent in her route, it wouldn't really change just how stupid I thought the events themselves were, so I guess i'm just hopeless for this route entirely."
visualnovels,3dtb8a,Wahfuu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:53:37 2015 UTC,"The house cleaning scene is like 5 minutes though lol. I agree the route has maaajor pacing issues though, could have literally been half the length. Despite that I think I really liked the dynamic, especially how that amusement park scene tied it all together.  Out of curiosity did you like Amane? I don't think she really became more capable or anything, just more accepting of her circumstances."
visualnovels,3dtb8a,Wahfuu,4,Sun Jul 19 22:04:59 2015 UTC,"Amane's circumstances and her ability to deal with them are pretty admirable, I thought. Her bad end especially shows her being pretty great. Amane, though, was consistent. Everything she does is pretty consistent with the character, there's no misdirection or misleading nonsense that comes with multiple writer syndrome, because most of the common route and Amane's route are by the same person.  Yumiko goes from slightly airheaded, but otherwise pragmatic/no-nonsense kuudere, to.. that.   I'm not really just talking about the house cleaning. The 2nd half of the route is feeling bad for Yuuji, sex, fuckups, sex, self-destruction, ""TRAPCARD!""  I think the amusement park scene could have been really good if I respected the writing at all."
visualnovels,3dtb8a,mystry08,2,Sun Jul 19 22:22:42 2015 UTC,"""But I won't let you manipulate me anymore! I'll talk with my own mouth and move with my own limbs! I won't be reduced to your puppet!""  And Yumiko gains the courage to successfully confront her father with the help of people she slowly let into her life, and is hella cool about it, and goes on to live a happy life. You finished the route, right? Saying she is weaker at the end of the route than in the common route is just bs. All she's really doing outside of her route is hiding from her father in a spot he forced her to be in, and refusing to confront the reality of the situation by putting up a huge wall, you're just not paying attention to it in every other route because the focus is completely on another person.   I just don't get how you can see a character who is basically a caged bird at the start of the VN and goes on to gain the help and courage necessary to free herself and say that person is ""completely useless"" because there was a 5 minute scene of them breaking some plates. Are we just forgetting her cooking awesome food at the end of the VN at the same time?  Just feels like you're cherry-picking the lows of the character and using that to establish how you feel."
visualnovels,3dtb8a,herkz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:38:30 2015 UTC,"Because it's :terribly written:. I don't care about what the actual source of everything is if it's displayed in the dumbest way possible. I mean, yes, her character in her route does have a growth arc, where she learns happiness from Yuuji and gains the courage to stand up for her father. Which all climaxes in the absolutely stupidest asspull ever seen, as Yumiko watches as Yuuji does things that have only ever been talked about off-screen.  There's simply no consistency with how her character is displayed from the common route to how she is displayed in her own route. It's why I heavily dislike having multiple writers for eroge, because you get stupid conflicts like this. She displays NO trait besides being a kuudere (which isn't what an entire character should be about) from her common route counterpart, that personality is abandoned. And her fucking 'dere' side made me want to vomit. Second half Yumiko might as well be an entirely different character, just some kuudere that belongs in a moege. As I said, it's not just 1 scene. It's the :entire: way she's displayed in her own route, from the idiot to the first half, to the pathetic nobody she is in the second.   From the few people I know who've played Rakuen, the beginning of the game has it focusing on Yumiko, and it focuses alot on her anxiety, but it still has her growing strong and being proactive. Weird, huh? Almost like it's not written by the same writer who, coincidentially, didn't come back for the Hatsumira project or Rakuen. Wonder why.  Anyways, this is probably pointless. You clearly saw something on Yumiko's route that I don't, because all I see is piles upon piles of terrible writing and consistency issues. So I won't try and convince you otherwise. These discussions just go around in circles."
visualnovels,3dtb8a,gustave154,2,Mon Jul 20 23:39:54 2015 UTC,"But like almost every route has an asspull. Grisaia is one giant asspull VN haha, it's part of its charm imo. Kazuki secretly created a master escape journal with star routes and shit, Yuuji creating a false death for Michiru (and Michiru's entire problem being a supernatural asspull), blowing up Mihama Academy in Sachi's route. Tbh the only one where I don't think he had much of a concrete plan was Makina's route, which ends pretty disastrously for him either way.  Guess I did haha! I suppose I don't view her as useless, especially with the way they conclude the story, which seems to clash with your biggest gripe with the character (Sachi was just as useless for example and completely relied on Yuuji to solve her problem, she was ready to burn down the school and create the same mistake before he quite literally forces her to fix her problems.) I haven't read Rakuen yet due to not knowing Japanese and it being in-progress, I'll definitely give you my opinion when I do though. I know Rakuen is essentially a retcon so perhaps the author did it even better."

visualnovels,3dtb8a,LendoKhan,2,Sun Jul 19 13:53:05 2015 UTC,"Good points. I agree that Yumiko's route is probably the most realistic in the 1st game and the way it shows how Yuuji is also human is a breath of fresh air (minus the turkey, of course).  Despite that, I still consider Sachi's/Makina's route to be the most interesting and griping in terms of story content. Sachi for the love story (not natural, but entertaining) and Makina for making my adrenaline rush. The pacing in Amane's route is horrible imo so I don't really have that much of a good opinion on it just like the majority. And lastly, Michiru is... well, it's not bad :P"

She had the best development too.
visualnovels,3dtb8a,xelivous,3,Sun Jul 19 15:36:54 2015 UTC,"I really liked Yumiko's route and Yumiko herself.  Of the girl's she the most ""normal"" and realistic.  You could imagine a person like her IRL (mostly).  The other girls are slightly past the edge of what I would consider ""real life believable"" (versus anime believable).  I honestly didn't have any issues with the pacing or evolution of her character.  I thought they were fine.  People simply don't respect how someone could react to highly unusual situations.  Half the comments in this thread remind me of the bashing the last episode of Parasyte received spoiler."

visualnovels,3dtb8a,herkz,3,Sun Jul 19 09:14:11 2015 UTC,"In the common route, yumiko was a pretty capable herione who was dependable and resourceful. This is further expanded upon in a few of the other herione's routes where she is often a source of advice for yuuji when dealing with the other heroine's problems. She's capable of searching the ""dark"" side of the internet and gathering information.  then as soon as you get on her route she's a helpless girl who needs saving for the entire route. She can't even do basic housework, and fails at literally everything she tries simply so yuuji can shine even more from some kind of power fantasy over conquering a strong woman.  also ""a few secret agent moments""? The entire first part of the route is secret agent moments, and he spends most of the middle of the route doing inner monologues based on his experience as a secret agent; where he plans out various contingency plans for escaping and staying safe, or observing his surroundings. If anything, this is the route with the 2nd most secret agent stuff, after makina's.  I absolutely hated her route and will never understand how someone could like it. Although I admit the ending was above average compared to the rest of the route, it doesn't really do anything special. I'm glad you can enjoy something that I clearly can't at least."
visualnovels,3dtb8a,ChaosWraith,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:41:22 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for writing out all your thoughts so well. Im not a big fan of circlejerking haha. I like to discuss things people like and dislike that don't match my own opinion.  I think Yumiko gets strong again when they decide to confront her father and that it was more of a temporary weakness resulting from everything happening so fast. You wouldnt be sort of a wreck in the same scenario? Forced by circumstance to be alone in some apartment all day with your self depreciating thoughts while you watch your boyfriend deteriorate physically? If anything I like that they resolved it and expressed how much they mean to one another. She certainly isnt a wreck at the end of the arc. If anything it was nice to ser that more human element of her since shes so stable and aware of everyone's business in every other route. She also eats instant food all the time and Sachi does all the chores, despite being shrewd I dont consider her life in Mihama to be balanced at all.  As for Yuuji, dude is sexually a sadist and I think you need to separate h-Yuuji from normal Yuuji. I dont think he tries to ""conquer"" her normally."
visualnovels,3dtb8a,AlphaQRough,2,Sun Jul 19 17:10:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I loved how her route was a bad copy of Makina's too! And how Yumiko lost all personality she had in the common route once her route started.  P.S. I hope you know they fired the writer of her route for Rakuen because he was so bad. And he's not working on Frontwing's new game with the same team either. ;)"
visualnovels,3dtb8a,Panhead369,3,Sun Jul 19 15:24:43 2015 UTC,"Nah Makina's route was more of a Yuuji route with a heavy mentor vibe, not the same imo. It feels similar at the start though with that heavy action focus and Yuuji going against the will of his organization, but turns into a different thing. One thing I really liked about this route was that it felt like Yuuji developed in more of an organic way. I thought it felt a little forced in Makina's route, though the exposition is really valuable and thus I think her route should always go first."
visualnovels,3dtb8a,insanityissexy,3,Sun Jul 19 16:24:15 2015 UTC,"It was the same. It was Yuuji and the girl going up against her parent. Except Makina's route actually had exciting action and some backstory for Yuuji, whereas Yumiko's route had... nothing."

Yumiko was always romantic and sappy, the kuu attitude was a wall. Not much of a shock that she starts to behave differently around you, she is still kuudere attitude to the others when you return to Mihama. She also gets silly and off guard sometimes in other routes like the presents in Michiru's route."

I hear it's a mystery one so I guess it has some great mind-games etc, but how are the characters, the art, the music and pacing etc?"
visualnovels,3dtmww,GregerMoek,14,Sun Jul 19 11:01:19 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Kara no Shoujo is one of my favorites and I'm always happy to talk about it.    The protagonist of Kara no Shoujo is a private investigator in Japan during the 1950's IIRC, and he is investigating some fairly gruesome murders (KnS is not for the faint of heart). There is a pretty decent system used for reasoning.    The soundtrack is really nice (make sure to avoid reading the comments) and the art style is very pleasant.    About the pacing, I don't believe I really noticed any pacing issues while I was reading -- and this is typically indicative of good pacing.  Above all else though, Kara no Shoujo has very compelling characters, a good sense of humor, a nice story, and is great at establishing whatever atmosphere is intended at any give moment. It also never pulls its punches -- and this is a novel that can hit pretty fucking hard.  Now, having said all this praise, Kara no Shoujo is by no means a perfect VN and I do have some criticisms (a few side characters are too shallow, some H-scenes are just shoehorned in, the detective Hunt the Pixel games can be frustrating), but I still consider it a must-read."

visualnovels,3dtmww,ctom42,3,Sun Jul 19 12:52:42 2015 UTC,"As a game, I was a bit disappointed since the game has several (interesting) fail-states that you 1) don't learn are fail-states until later on, and 2) don't really tell you what you did wrong to get you in this situation. I'm not expecting a Tiger Dojo to explain things here, but some sort of hint would be welcome, given the complexity of the game and permutations of possible event flags. On the other hand, I like that it tries to retain the adventure gameplay of old, even if it doesn't do it that well, since contemporary VNs have basically given up on gameplay.   As a mystery story, I felt that it relied on too many improbable coincidences to create dramatic irony or ""solutions"", which might be ok in a cartoon-logic universe like Ace Attorney, but is really out of place in a Chandler-esque noir setting like KnS. Its a far cry from the Kyogoku novels its trying to emulate. Also, the antagonists were somewhat unidimensional (and self-consciously so) compared to the previous title (Cartagra). Which is a shame since good stories really need good villains. That said, KnS does have some colorful, memorable characters.  Anyway point is, if you want to play KnS play Cartagra first."
visualnovels,3dtmww,anonynamja,6,Sun Jul 19 13:33:53 2015 UTC,"To offer a dissenting opinion, I consider KnS a pretty disappointing read. Like Falafel I did not have any issues with pacing, characters, soundtrack, premise, etc. It was actually pretty enjoyable and promising for most of the time. The issues I had with it (aside from the absolutely terrible investigation gameplay which basically require a walkthrough) was with the mystery and horror elements.  The game has investigation sequences, an investigation journal, and deduction sequences. It makes it very clear it wants you to try and solve the mystery. And yet none of the mysteries are ever solvable by the reader. The MC doesn't really solve them either, something just happens right at each climax that leads him to the culprit, heck sometimes your required to give wrong answers in deductions to not bad end. Most of the reveals are done in massive infodump twists at the end instead of being discovered during detective work. The story also felt like it was going out of it's way to be gruesome and depressing.   Basically I enjoyed it 90% of the time, but at the end of every case I was so disappointed that it made my overall enjoyment in the negative.  tl;td KnS had a lot of potential and completely failed to live up to it, relying on deus ex machina twists, cheap gore and outrage, and was a failure as a mystery."
visualnovels,3dtmww,ctom42,6,Sun Jul 19 12:38:25 2015 UTC,"I cannot disagree with you -- in my opinion, the main difference in the way we view Kara no Shoujo is that Kara no Shoujo    Having said this, I would probably spoiler tag a few details in your complaints on the mystery. You're not wrong in any way, but you might be hinting a bit too much."
visualnovels,3dtmww,falafel_eater,4,Sun Jul 19 13:09:41 2015 UTC,"I think that if you're looking for a solidly-written, atmospheric mystery, that you'd be happy with KnS2. KnS2 as a whole has a more defined, better-written mystery as a whole. It's likely more atmospheric, and more of an 'Innocent Grey work' in that regard.  Albeit in comparison to KnS1, it doesn't have a central, meaningful romance (with the same, or even marginally comparable significance as Touko). In fact, it'd be safer to say that there is no real romance in KnS2."
visualnovels,3dtmww,mdzjdz,2,Sun Jul 19 15:03:29 2015 UTC,"Eh, the romance with Toko felt incredibly forced and out of place to me, as did basically all of the romances and h-scenes. My problem was also basically never the atmosphere spoilers. It was with the execution of the climaxes, they were really really poorly done, and did not build naturally from the investigations at all."
visualnovels,3dtmww,ctom42,3,Sun Jul 19 17:23:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the romance with Touko being forced, but I don't think that the romance was the most natural either (it certainly had its developed points though -- it wasn't arbitrary). I agree that most of the romances within KnS were arbitrary/didn't make sense (Indeed, KnS and KnS2 are both criticized for a lot of their useless h-scenes). This holds true for the sequel too (for the most part at least).  I don't think that the audience knowing more is necessarily a bad thing (granted that the protagonist doesn't take this information for granted). In KnS2, we're given several perspectives, none of which respectively have a whole picture of what's going on (so the audience on one hand is being introduced both to new information & are anticipating certain characters learning about plot points that other characters know about).   I disagree with the claim that KnS executed its climaxes poorly (although I can't quite substantiate this claim -- it's been 2-3 years since I've read it; although to what I remember, it wasn't done poorly).   Although if you disliked the prequel, I can't imagine you liking the sequel (as while it's not really 'focused' on the prequel's events, its climax is certainly related to it."
visualnovels,3dtmww,mdzjdz,4,Sun Jul 19 17:37:08 2015 UTC,"I can't say that ever bothered me too much. Even at the end I still felt like I had been involved in uncovering the truth of both investigations. It's certainly not Phoenix Wright, but I don't think it was necessarily trying to be.  The one frustration I had with the game was how easy it is to get dead ends. I enjoyed the bad ends and felt they actually added to the experience, but I remember getting stuck a couple of times where I had to reload a fairly old save (and the first time, start over from the beginning) because I had gotten myself stuck at a decision point where either choice would lead to a bad end because I hadn't done the correct footwork earlier on in the story."
visualnovels,3dtmww,The_Dran,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:03:14 2015 UTC,"Even if I end up liking it, it's good to see comments like these too before going into it. I tend to like stories even more in the end if I expect them to be overrated(same was true for MLA and Steins;Gate, even F/SN really)."
visualnovels,3dtmww,GregerMoek,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:03:46 2015 UTC,"sometimes your required to give wrong answers in deductions to not bad end   I don't remember this. Pretty sure that if you make the wrong inference, you let the bad guy get away."
visualnovels,3dtmww,anonynamja,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:12:56 2015 UTC,"I don't remember exactly where it was, but there was definitely at least one time where giving the wrong answer was essential. I was reading it along with /r/vndiscuss and we were all annoyed by it. It was something where there was a second answer that seemed correct if you had figured some stuff out (which is the one you need to pick) and after you choose it it's later revealed to be wrong. It's as if the game did not expect you to figure it out ahead of time or something."

visualnovels,3dtmww,Ewig_Custos,2,Sun Jul 19 18:52:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel pretty much the same way, like there was no real climax or exciting parts. It was like ""Yeah... all those events just sorta happened"", and it flows from one scene to the other and I never got really interested or impressed by anything. I still kind of want to check out KnS2. The way the deaths were revealed with the perspective shifts, at first I thought it was really cool and interesting, but then it just becomes a bunch of obvious death flags for characters I was never invested in to begin with, and one by one mystery reveals. I guess oldschool-style mysteries aren't supposed to be too dramatic.  I also really wasn't a fan of the cast, especially the ""romance"". I guess it's like a ""romanceless"" harem. People say that Kara no Shoujo wasn't supposed to be a romance or anything, but it still has a bunch of girls and sex scenes, and it's full of them, and I can't even take the cast completely seriously because of that, I guess. I'm hoping KnS2 is better and more interesting/compelling, but I wasn't crazy about the first one. I also couldn't really get into Cartagra much."
visualnovels,3dtmww,Vladz0r,5,Sun Jul 19 21:49:26 2015 UTC,"Nice to see KnS2 done, wonder when they'll release it.  Still have to read Cartagra before, though.  Also I'm surprised Himawari's translation is done already.  When's Otakon?"

Not to mention that it wouldn't be the first time it is being translated -- and that the first translation isn't considered to be bad.    So there's basically no real reason for Grisaia no Kajitsu to be mentioned in this thread, and there's still quite a while to go until Grisaia no Meikyuu and Grisaia no Rakuen (and ChiruChiru) are expected to reach noteworthy levels of translation."

I should probably do an update post sometime for it."
visualnovels,3dqurz,Niyari,2,Mon Jul 20 14:43:41 2015 UTC,I wonder if it would be worth setting up a bot to run the script so you don't have to take requests manually.

Of course that would be a project for later as you are quite busy right now with the current one.

visualnovels,3ds3m1,emerson_pine,4,Sat Jul 18 22:38:35 2015 UTC,Their survey giveaway is kind of hilarious. Are they seriously having a lottery where participants can win a prize equivalent to $2 in store credit?
visualnovels,3ds3m1,falafel_eater,2,Sun Jul 19 01:15:41 2015 UTC,That's $200 in prizes.  That's on par with typical survey rewards.
visualnovels,3ds3m1,sanahtlig,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:33:13 2015 UTC,"I thought a point was equivalent to 1 JPY, not 1 USD. If I got it wrong and they're giving away $200 then I take it back."
visualnovels,3ds3m1,falafel_eater,2,Sun Jul 19 01:46:33 2015 UTC,100 winners * $2 = $200
visualnovels,3ds3m1,sanahtlig,2,Sun Jul 19 01:50:02 2015 UTC,"...Then I do not take it back. Winning $2 in store credit for products that cost over $30 is virtually meaningless, especially given that the credit expires. Why not give $0.02 credit to every single participant? If they went with 10 winners * $20 then winning would have maybe meant something.    As it is,  in my opinion it's better to just not have this sort of a giveaway at all. Then again, I suppose that's just a pet peeve of mine."
visualnovels,3ds3m1,falafel_eater,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:35:29 2015 UTC,"The hardest thing to do is getting people to participate in the surveys at all. Giving everyone 2 cents might be the ""fair"" reward, but the typical person isn't going to waste their time for 2 cents.   It's a fair point to say a $2 reward is underwhelming as well (why not seriously at least make it $10 for winners), but a chance at $2 ""feels"" more appealing than a guaranteed 2 cents."
visualnovels,3ds3m1,sirflimflam,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:25:43 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm concerned, 10 winners * $20 and 100 winners * $2 are equivalent incentives.  From a practical and logical perspective, there's no important difference--it's just toying with probability of reward vs. payout with the same amount of funding."
visualnovels,3ds3m1,sanahtlig,4,Sun Jul 19 02:54:54 2015 UTC,"I disagree with that logic. It could be argued that these are equivalent expenses on behalf of the people doing the giveaway, but even that would be wrong. Giving a single winner a prize worth $200 in credit means giving away about 7 titles for free. Giving a hundred winners a prize worth $2 in credit means selling one hundred titles at a 8% discount, meaning that it's still a profitable sale.    It is incorrect to assume that store-credit rewards are a linear function (double the prize = twice as good). It's more like a series of activation functions, where a reward that's worth less than 30% of the cost of a title is the same as 5% and one free VN is almost twice as good as 80% off.    However, I don't imagine we're going to see eye-to-eye on this."
visualnovels,3ds3m1,falafel_eater,3,Sun Jul 19 12:05:06 2015 UTC,"I like how DLsite is starting to list actual English descriptions (not machine translated) for Japanese-language titles.  Their 3-image format is still entirely insufficient to get a good idea of what a title is like.  Even when the images are sufficiently detailed, the resolution is too low to read the complicated diagrams the authors have to resort to to cram in enough information.  For the time being, DLsite-Eng is still the best place to buy Japanese-language titles from overseas, and DLsite (JP) carries a wide selection of professional titles that DLsite-Eng doesn't (though the Japanese interface makes registering significantly more annoying).  If DLsite-Eng could grab all the titles from the JP side (without hiking the prices), they could be a one-stop shop for English importers.  Sadly that probably won't happen since the eroge industry self-regulatory regime has decided that selling to foreigners is bad for business.  Ever wonder why DLsite-Eng only sells doujin titles?  Well wonder no further."

Also DMM has professional titles available while Dlsite only has them on their Japanese site."
visualnovels,3dqefu,The_Bunny_Advocate,6,Sat Jul 18 13:03:37 2015 UTC,"PSA  For some reason it's more natural to have the first choice be on the right side (for me at least), but in this voting form it's on the left side.   So, remember this:   Left side means first place and more points.  Right side means last place and less points.

We can have as many 'winners' as we choose, and there's no need for 'local' representation.  A simple proportional system is superior for this application.  I would have liked a way to say ""I haven't read this VN,"" so my votes wouldn't count against it, though."
visualnovels,3dqefu,watermark02,2,Sat Jul 18 14:00:14 2015 UTC,"Local representation would basically be voting by genre, and I think more than 5 or so per category would be unwieldy.  I mean, at 5 per genre, you're already shoving more than 50 recommendations on there, not taking into account overlap.  While it's tempting to put everything in, it's more information overload for a newcomer.  I'm probably gonna code something up for it, whether it gets used or not."
visualnovels,3dqefu,ctom42,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:18:42 2015 UTC,"STV doesn't necessarily have to be local. The Senate of New South Wales, for instance, uses one 20 member statewide STV district to fill itself. STV just usually uses smaller local districts because elections in districts this size can become extremely unwieldy (hundreds of candidate to rank)."
visualnovels,3dqefu,Ewig_Custos,13,Mon Jul 20 18:18:24 2015 UTC,If you disagree with a VN and don't think it should ever be associated with that genre then don't select it at all rather than list it last.   Doing it this way makes disagreeing no worse than leaving out a VN that you have not read.  edit: In the gameplay section there is both VLR and Zero Escape. Other sections have Just 999. They should all really be Zero Escape for consistency. On a related note I did not notice the ZE until after I clicked VLR and there is no way to unclick it if I only want to vote for one.
visualnovels,3dqefu,ctom42,3,Sat Jul 18 14:44:25 2015 UTC,"Doing it this way makes disagreeing no worse than leaving out a VN that you have not read.   At first I thought the same, since this goes a little bit against common logic, but if you think about it, two-way voting would require completely different voting system. If you leave it as it is and add negative votes, what you did is basically allowed to vote for your preferred not once, but twice or more, since voting for preferred genre would get points for your choice, and get additional lead for other genres' negative points, which is not good at all.  So the system is fine, though personally I'd organize it this way: split the voting into two parts, first voting to determine genres, second one to determine ranking. The first voting would be done by titles, for each title you get 10 points, you spend them between all available genres for that title. The genre with most points for that title gets selected as 'main' genre. This way the second voting would be without duplicates and genre bias."

But I'm not going to complain about the way they are doing it, after all they are doing all the work. I was just pointing out a minor issue in the way it's done since I did not reach 9 on any category, so the ones I thought ""did not fit"" were equivalent to the ones that I just had not read."
visualnovels,3dqefu,vhapteR,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:45:28 2015 UTC,"Doing it this way makes disagreeing no worse than leaving out a VN that you have not read.   We considered going with the same 5 point strong approve -> strong disapprove sequence as the genre voting, but we didn't think that gave enough leeway to highlight our favourites. In some genres there were several VNs I'd have strongly approved of, but I'd be unable to rank those several approval choices. So we thought this new approach gave people more options to express their preferences.   In the gameplay section there is both VLR and Zero Escape. Other sections have Just 999. They should all really be Zero Escape for consistency.   Yeah I was mostly copying in the names as they were suggested and some errors went unnoticed. I'll update it if Zero Escape wins, but it looks like it'll probably be assigned to the mystery genre instead."

It certainly sounds like an interesting title, probably solid choice to localize.  If anyone's curious why it's not Dies Irae:  1- Game is too big and hard. Garejei mentioned even those scenes take up too much time and whole game is out of question. This probably applies even if you consider Conjueror (Himawari translator) working on it too.  2- I really, really doubt Light would agree with that.  3- その輪廻はもう止まらん.

Is there some shortage of people willing to be voice actors? Are they willing to work for less than everybody else? Or is it just that they are best at getting connections like I would guess?"
visualnovels,3dq54y,Kowzz,11,Sat Jul 18 10:37:20 2015 UTC,"Why I like Steins;Gate  1) Though a lot of paradoxes pop up, the theoretical physics info dumping is actually pretty neat and educational. You get to learn about some topics while you play.  2) Story wise, S;G is a great example of ""Man vs Fate"". Time travel is merely the plot device, it is not the main goal of Okabe to be the master of SpaceTime, he even declared he would forsake anything related to time-travelling in exchange for a normal life where he could live in peace with his friends (lab mems)  3) The characters are interesting and nicely developed. Considering the fact that only Okabe retains his memories, the story still shows us the characters in moderate depth despite the short ""actual"" timeline (not accounting for the days Okabe spent looping). Special mention to Christina Za Zombie. No matter how many times she forgets, she is permanently helping Okabe in every step, directly or indirectly (advice and info) and I was happy in the end how it finally hit Okabe that she's the one he cares for the most (still kinda cynical  how Kurisu falls for him given a short timespan for her, but we can argue that though she forgets, she retains some memories and emotions attached to Okabe). Great growth for the protagonist as well, as you can see him getting disgusted by his chunii bullshit and get's serious and down to business in the latter parts.  Overall, I'm still kind of unsatisfied how it all ended. All that personal relationship building with the lab mems especially Kurisu disappears after arriving at Steins;Gate. I only wish we were given canon stories to see how they did things all over again...man, these scenarios of forgetting important people and being the lone observer who remembers always gets me, since you have all these great memories together yet you're the only one left to remember. Feels so lonely. If there's a specific term for a situation like this I'd like to know.  Steins;Gate is one of the best Anime/Game/Stories out there. Excellent voice acting and plotting. 10/10 would loop back in time again. El Psy Kongalooloo"
visualnovels,3dq54y,OhLookAtMeImSpecial,6,Sat Jul 18 11:17:17 2015 UTC,"I suppose I can speak my peace about Steins;Gate. I very much liked this VN, probably my second favorite VN of all time. There is a lot to enjoy in Steins;Gate:   The visuals are unique and very well done. I thought the art style of the VN did the story a service. To me everything felt so crisp and textured. It made the sprites and backgrounds interesting to look at, not to mention the CGs.  The music was pretty good. Not an all-time favorite, but I felt like the music did a great job setting the mood. The title theme is deliciously fitting as well I thought. I genuinely enjoyed the different endings. In a lot of VNs I've played the non-true ends just sorta happen, y'know? But in Steins;Gate I thought the other endings were actually pretty interesting, especially Suzaha's ending. A matter of taste, obviously, but that's how I felt. The use of the phone for different side conversations was great, and I would have loved to have seen more. I honestly didn't care for using it as the main ""choice"" device or whatever though. It fits the story and is an interesting take on story choices, but it felt needlessly obtuse for me. I liked the ""Tips"" glossary thing. I feel like a lot of visual novels could benefit from this, I'm glad that they're implementing something like this in the Clannad translation There is a lot of other stuff I could talk about but I think I'll finish off with what I think I enjoyed the most about Steins;Gate: the characters. The lab members were great. There was a decent size cast of diverse characters, and seeing them interact was just fantastic. Okabe especially stood out to me as a great character, we certainly watched his character development the closest (And his voice actor knocked it out of the park if I do say so myself).   Easily 10/10 for me, I would love to give this one a reread down the line, and await the new VN with bated breath!"
visualnovels,3dq54y,i_suck_at_stuffs,12,Sat Jul 18 17:29:15 2015 UTC,"Wall of text because I finished this VN 6 hours ago and I think it's probably the best VN I've read. I might just be biased because I'm still feeling the 'rush' of having finished it, anyway...   Here's why I think it's awesome:   They had decent amounts of pseudo science baked into the equation without trying too hard, meaning they didn't really try to come off as if it was legitimate inventions and physics. It was a great plot device and I feel they used it properly. They stayed within the boundaries they created in the VN.  Great use of a(to me) unique choice mechanic. The first time I reached an ending I didn't even know what I was doing until the last scenes. It was a great ""Ahaaaa, damn I've been stupid"" experience. It immediately made me wanna play again and try things out. I also like their used of a codex/glossary/journal which means getting info-dumps is a choice for the reader.  What surprised me most, in a good way, was how damn funny it is sometimes. I've probably not laughed as much when reading a VN that is also has well made 'sad moments'. It has tons of references and they even explained those well by using the glossary. The humor doesn't feel forced at all. It goes well with how the characters normally behave. Well made characters, each and everyone with their own 'secrets' and strengths. They were all important to the story and the characters stayed with you the whole game. Okabe's character development is also really well made, I felt everything made sense. The only thing I might've been mildly annoyed by was Kurisu's lines at times. She was just too much a 'classic' tsundere using the same line all the time. ""I didn't x y because I wanted, I just happened to z"" I almost thought it was Michuru from Grisaia no Kajitsu for a moment. Otherwise I have no real complaints. Okabe is probably one of my favorite main characters now, along with Naoe Yamato from Majikoi. The pacing was good. You were never really bored as you can get in other VNs. The most tedious thing was I get to loop through the same conversation at times. The first ending I reached(Suzu) had lots of this, but it ended fairly quick. There was always something happening to advance the plot and very few scenes felt like 'filler scenes'. The time it took to finish it felt just right for what the story gave you. Great true ending, and they didn't use ""plot magic"" to solve the puzzle. What I mean by this is that they just didn't find some kind of miraculous ""weapon"" or something to fix everything. I guess in a way the time machine served as this, but the ending still connected perfectly to the start. You got every question answered. How the pulled it off was consistent with what seemed possible within the boundaries created in Steins;Gate. It was clever without overdoing it. Sometimes a clever ending isn't super advanced.    My previous favorite VN (MLA) probably had greater plot twists, the climax moments were probably a bit better than in Steins;Gate(IMO) but it also had so many 'flaws' IMO that it doesn't deserve the spot of best VN. Steins;Gate is something I feel that I can recommend to anyone because it doesn't require 2.5 VNs to reach a point where most people can agree that it gets good. I personally enjoyed those 2.5 VNs of content and backstory but that still doesn't mean the majority will.   It has no H-scenes with just makes it easier to recommend. H-scenes is something I skip anyway because honestly I've never felt that they gave me anything(not even a boner). I am not -against- h-scenes, or even sex in stories, because sex is a normal part of everyone's lives. I still think they're poorly made for the most part and they feel like fan service almost all the time. The key word here with Steins;Gate is consistency. The amount of fan-service in this VN was also low. I HATE USELESS FAN-SERVICE THAT DOESN'T ADD ANYTHING TO THE STORY. The only moment that comes close to this would be the shower scene, but even that is super short. Steins;Gate stayed consistent with itself in this department too.  I can understand if the art style puts people off, personally I liked it because it's different but at the same time I realize if people think it's 'shit'. The style grew on me fast."
visualnovels,3dq54y,GregerMoek,2,Sat Jul 18 12:05:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with your points, especially with the lack of any Deus ex Machina magic in the end. Everything was planned, I realized that earlier when Kurisu said she met Okabe before actually meeting him, I half expected that he'd end up in an endless loop until that day (the conference), good thing he didn't.  The only thing I disagree with you is the lack of H-scenes, wow I was so sexually frustrated...i'm not a pervert or anything...but the lack of that kind of satisfaction really bugged me.  The art is very nice, reminds of The Count of Monte Cristo anime. We can also agree that the voice acting is grade A, at par with Grisaia and the others."

visualnovels,3dq54y,araragi09,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:55:29 2015 UTC,"You're a little bit on the masochistic side aren't ya? But I have to agree with you, if Okabe died or endlessly looped til that point it would've been probably very tragic (you can theorize that other Okabes from different worldlines or his past self, will continue the cycle of what he did and end up killing Kurisu as an inevitable finale...again and again for all of eternity)  It's not Deus ex Machina if it's already been established in the start, Okabe travelling to that point of Kurisu's death and the strange message you get at the start of the game indicates that the writer/s didn't pull that one out of their asses."
visualnovels,3dq54y,OhLookAtMeImSpecial,4,Sun Jul 19 11:11:06 2015 UTC,"My Steins;Gate experience:  After suffering through the anguish of crushing all the side route girls dreams, you get to the fake-out fade-out point and the story flips the table over and changes all the rules established about how time travel works. There's a sense of exhilaration as the protagonist, through incredible effort and dedication, triumphs against space and time itself. It is a happy ending that feels deserved.   But later on, as you collect your thoughts, you are left scratching your head about how everything fits together, and you search online for various flowcharts that explain things in greater detail. You watch the anime adaptation, think its pretty neat especially episode 25, then are disappointed by the mediocre movie and the mediocre spinoffs as 5pb and Nitroplus milk the franchise for all its worth.   Steins;Gate, like other 'stable time loop' stories, is very elegantly constructed, but ultimately unsatisfying. (From a narrative perspective, not an emotional one. Case in point: Interstellar) 'X happens because X happened' is circular and doesn't really answer why for the audience. This is why I think the epigraph trilogy was the most successful of the spinoffs (and thus the best candidate for Zero), because it fills in the weakest part of Steins;Gate and satisfies readers that the character motivations behind the plot device are relatable with.  From a design perspective, I think the problem is that the true route is basically unattainable without a walkthrough, which is poor design."

Depends on how far she's developed I guess.   I think Okabe would be more eventful(and fun) to hang out with unless you meet him during the more depressive moments in the story so I will say Okabe. He might be spewing nonsense all the time but at least you get a day with something you've never quite experienced before."

visualnovels,3dq54y,Ressha,3,Sat Jul 18 14:58:33 2015 UTC,"Well, the world of S;G may well have a different universe than our ' s but I assume the opening prologue is meant to convey scientific facts of the real world to set up the concept of time travel as plausible. It bothers me that one of those facts is wrong."

visualnovels,3dq54y,MegaZeroX7,4,Tue Jul 21 18:33:32 2015 UTC,"The thing I loved most about Steins;Gate was seeing Okabe's psychological state deteriorate as he deals with himself becoming slowly more and more disconnected from the reality that everyone else lives in. That isn't the only thing, of course, but that is what pushes this to one of my favorite VNs of all time!"
visualnovels,3dq54y,Shaedana,7,Sun Jul 19 00:04:22 2015 UTC,I guess my biggest problem with the VN is that it was too easy to expect the story to blow up to a bigger scale. Major important questions and info is brought up especially about the alpha world line and SERN but the plot never broadens up. I played ~50 hours expecting Okabe or Kurisu to be deeply entangled with some sort of conspiracy but no. The story isn't about the world these characters live in. It's about the characters and their relationships. If I had realized that sooner I wouldn't have felt such disappointment at the end. Now that I've had few weeks to think the story through and watch the anime the disappointment has mostly faded away and been replaced by my appreciation for the characters. Zero is now my most anticipated game and I hope the western release wont take too long.
visualnovels,3dq54y,Adonax,6,Sat Jul 18 12:49:27 2015 UTC,"It's been a few weeks since I finished the VN and I had similar expectations of scale while I was playing.  SERN was a massive looming threat, but was never a major player once Okabe started undoing D-mails.  I saw the twist coming involving the final D-mail but past that, I was always wondering when SERN was going to show up big to get in the way.  I don't dislike the way it was handled now that I've finished, in fact I'm very happy with the way it went, but while playing it felt like a major opportunity that was set up but never explored."
visualnovels,3dq54y,GregerMoek,3,Sat Jul 18 16:11:14 2015 UTC,"Very good point. I guess the main thing was scope and time. You'd probably need more time to fully explore SERN more closely, but I also like the message in how it was handled. Look for the root cause(D-Mails) instead of treating symptoms(SERN), it is an important part of my work as a product developer and production developer. So I felt that the solution was fitting.   That said, I think the symptoms could show in more ways than ""Mayuri dies"" which instantly creates the problem solving phase. If they used the same solution(fixing d-mails) but let SERN play around a bit more(without killing someone off and triggering Okabe's time-leap) they would be able to give SERN a bit more screen-time. That itself could be fun, but let's be honest, Okabe and co. wouldn't be able to handle much military opposition. It would probably not be realistic given the boundaries of this particular story."
visualnovels,3dq54y,Shaedana,2,Sat Jul 18 16:24:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think the scope of the story is the only issue here. The writing clearly points out some of the holes that are never explained. For example Okabe wondering why Rounders aren't chasing him after killing Mayuri. I probably wouldn't have noticed that being an issue if he didn't point it out. My conclusion was that there must be something both I and Okabe aren't aware of. Maybe his time leaping is important to SERN somehow? And why didn't Rounders take the machine while the lab was empty?  There're lots of these kinds of questions deliberately brought up but never touched again. It's really annoying. ""Hey I wonder what terrible things would happen if you send your memories to another person?"" That'd be cool! ""Oh never mind! Just don't loose your phone okay? Oh that's not a problem either? Well..""  I love this VN but geez :)"

Like, all the characters seem to be speaking as if they were at a middle to high school level, even if it were the Kukis, Yamato's group, to regular classmate.  Did the TL not try to keep characters in character, or did the editor really change how each character speaks? Because it sounds really odd to have every character speak really slangy.   I don't even know what to say about these.   http://puu.sh/j3tYI/8184f8ee28.jpg http://puu.sh/j3u8W/54ae09ec67.jpg"
visualnovels,3do9fv,machaoshu,8,Sat Jul 18 08:00:50 2015 UTC,"Most of the characters speak casually most of the time. The Kukis are an exception, of course (interestingly and ironically, I've always been fond of having them speak in the royal We; editing took that out to make it consistent with Yandere and Wairu); if they sound overly casual, that was a mistake.  As for the lines you quoted: She wants feed, not food. That's the joke. As for the second line, probably could've been worded a bit better. I'm not going to lose sleep over it."

visualnovels,3do9fv,Cornetto_Man,5,Sat Jul 18 01:13:48 2015 UTC,Margit's is awful. Just concurrent h-scenes. Kokoro's is a bit better but still is a bit lacking. Monshiro's is diabetes levels of cute and Tsubame's is also pretty great. I haven't read the others yet but from what I've been told the heroine's after stories from the first are good if you like the heroines.
visualnovels,3do9fv,mbac1,2,Sat Jul 18 01:19:47 2015 UTC,Thanks - looks like Margit is up on the chopping block first.

S works well on its own, it's -very- much in style with the older game. Same humor and stupid shit happening everywhere. It's a really good sequel so far(I've not finished any route yet but it's still what you'd expect of a Majikoi sequel). So if you're only interested in a few routes I say you should hop right in."

Plus routes for two new characters Kuki Monshiro and Matsunaga Tsubame. There's also an Agave after which is pretty much a Agave Spoilers.   Along with those there's after stories for all the original main heroines as well as some more short routes for side characters (like the Chika one in the original) like Iyo. There's also a Hermit Crab after story which is bizarre to say the least."

visualnovels,3dq2cz,Demo102,15,Sat Jul 18 09:49:29 2015 UTC,"I think NVL can be useful when characters are epoxisiting a lot of information, or when you're dipping into the MC's internal thoughts and the thought process is quite lengtly and protracted. I think it also works well in flashbacks - doesn't Grisaia use NVL for all of Angelic Howl?  It's also good in VNs there isn't that many CGs and only a few character sprites, or the art quality isn't great, since NVL mode can fill up the screen and maybe mask the lack of quality art assets. So in thoe cases it feels more sensible and space effective than putting the text in the bottom of the screen.  I'm also just partial to NVL mode since it was used in Umineko, which was the first VN I ever played. I think NVL works pretty well there since art isn't Ryukishi's strong point, and nobody really plays Umineko for the art, they'll do it for the story - so the art is there on screen, but the text goes over it, which lends the story a bit more precedence than the sprites + BGs."
visualnovels,3dq2cz,ebi_hime,4,Sat Jul 18 10:49:03 2015 UTC,doesn't Grisaia use NVL for all of Angelic Howl?   I think Grisaia uses NVL for all flashbacks.
visualnovels,3dq2cz,falafel_eater,3,Sat Jul 18 11:56:14 2015 UTC,"Those portions of the game were understandable, but if the whole vn is like that, especially when the VN features amazing art, then it's a bother."
visualnovels,3dq2cz,falafel_eater,2,Sat Jul 18 19:48:16 2015 UTC,"I've read Umineko with UmiTweak (whose visuals aren't much worse off than Grisaia, plus featuring maybe five times as many backgrounds and CGs). Umineko has 8 episodes that are split off across two VNs (as in, two different applications). For one I used a version of the patch that had the text in NVL style, and for the other it had ADV style.    I much preferred the NVL. If I want to take a look at the art for a moment, I can hide the text. It doesn't have to be fully visible 100% of the time in my opinion; when I'm reading I spend most of the time focusing on the text anyway."
visualnovels,3dq2cz,Doublethree1,2,Sat Jul 18 20:30:19 2015 UTC,doesn't Grisaia use NVL for all of Angelic Howl?   I think it uses it for any scene you are in someone besides Yuuji's perspective. G-Senjou no Maou also uses it when you're following Maou and Rewrite uses it for some scenes but I can't remember when (The Terra route uses it though).  I don't mind it but if there's a lot of CG I'd prefer not to cover them with text.

visualnovels,3dq2cz,BookofAeons,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:01:26 2015 UTC,"I agree. Part of great writing includes the way one sentence follows another on the page; when you have to click each time, it breaks the flow of the lines."
visualnovels,3dq2cz,falafel_eater,4,Mon Jul 20 19:40:24 2015 UTC,"I like NVL when the sprites behind the text don't move too much.    ADV is also great, but the way it restricts line length is not always an advantage. Sometimes you need to have a wall of text, or extremely long-winded and rambling sentences, and you lose some of the impact when you only show two lines at once."

visualnovels,3dq2cz,BookofAeons,3,Sat Jul 18 16:52:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure whether you are trying to agree or disagree with my point. It might be a bit funny to analyze Katawa Shoujo as though it were some literary masterpiece, but I do believe that there is a very jarring effect when ADV abruptly transitions NVL -- which might help create a specific effect, or not.    Specifically, in your example we see Katawa Shoujo using NVL in a scene where pure ADV would not work. Try to imagine how this would have looked in pure ADV: that entire wall-of-text is a single sentence. You would have to advance the text six or seven times in order to be able to read all of it, and without going into backlog it would be literally impossible to make heads or tails of what you are reading. Even if a character is rambling or making no sense, a book should typically be something that its reader is capable of parsing without encountering a stack overflow error.    It is true that if the VN features a lot of very brief back-and-forth exchanges, ADV might look better (due to extreme text sparsity). Although if you add a third person narrator perspective, you can typically resolve that issue."

You would have to advance the text six or seven times in order to be able to read all of it, and without going into backlog it would be literally impossible to make heads or tails of what you are reading.   Rewrite has one of these where it stays in ADV.  It autoscrolls through all of it really quickly though, I read pretty fast and I still couldn't make it all out.  Had to reopen it in backlog to actually read it, like you said.  To me, even though this is sort of the same thing as the Katawa Shoujo one, in my mind it's the difference between a rant you're supposed to read for the text it contains (KS) and a rant you're not really supposed to read, the important part is just that there is a rant rather than what any of it actually says (Rewrite)."
visualnovels,3dq2cz,FrightFright,2,Sat Jul 18 20:56:28 2015 UTC,"I'm agreeing, of course.  That scene was the most striking example I could think of where NVL is used to provide an effect impossible for ADV.  The wording of the link was just my attempt at a lame pun >.<   Even if a character is rambling or making no sense, a book should typically be something that its reader is capable of parsing without encountering a stack overflow error.   It's a little different when the author is consciously trying to evoke that feeling of 404: Brain Not Found.  I don't think it should be taboo, but certainly a theme that should be handled with care."
visualnovels,3dq2cz,bigfatround0,2,Sat Jul 18 20:52:26 2015 UTC,"That's true, like Bobemmo said there are some text blurbs that are intended to be ramblings that the reader is meant to read, and blurbs that the reader is meant to know they exist (but not waste time reading).    Personally though, I always like to read every single thing. Still, either one is possible with NVL whereas ADV is can only really handle the latter type (which is the 'inferior' one, to boot)."

visualnovels,3dq2cz,FinalNwo,3,Sat Jul 18 10:08:17 2015 UTC,Having read a lot of VN's and knowing enough Kanji to read without relying on ITH/VNR/Translator Aggregator. I have to say it doesn't really get in the way once you get used to it the first time.  But the one that bothers me most is the 'Vertically Oriented Text' which I rarely see(one example being Soukou Akki Muramasa). Something about having to read from top to bottom just grates me(especially when the words are split and continued down another line).

Get used to it or drop it.  I like it because of the presentation of longer text/sentences that don't fit into a small textbox. Other than that, there's nothing special to be liked for me. It's just a format, like I said above."
visualnovels,3dq2cz,ctom42,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:03:51 2015 UTC,I find it annoying when it overlaps everything in the CG and it makes you hard to enjoy it when there's scribbles of text over it.

visualnovels,3dq2cz,Crooodle,2,Sat Jul 18 10:30:47 2015 UTC,"I actually find it easier to watch the characters and such with NVL, although that's probably just because with a textbox my eyes get glued to it so I never realize if a character changes expression mid sentence."

visualnovels,3dq2cz,FrightFright,2,Mon Jul 20 20:39:16 2015 UTC,"NVL lends it self better to narrative focused works or moments, and I honestly prefer NVL because it lets the text be more descriptive. It also better allows an actual ""narrator"" for moments where having the protagonist inner-monologue for the lines make no sense/break character.   And speaking of inner-monologues, NVL handles the long-winded ones better, while ADV is better suited to short thoughts/opinions the protag is having.  Edit: and in my case in particular, NVL actually helps me to better focus on the sprites and CG's, since my eyes aren't always glued to the bottom 5th of the screen."
visualnovels,3dq2cz,ctom42,3,Sat Jul 18 21:22:08 2015 UTC,"I prefer it 100% no question about it.  The PRIMARY draw for me for VNs is the story and the words, and it's much easier to be able to look back and reread a line that I missed or misunderstood if it's still on the screen after I've already passed it"
visualnovels,3dq2cz,Myrtillin,2,Sun Jul 19 07:55:41 2015 UTC,"In the early days of my exposure to VNs I really didn't like the NVL style. Somewhere in my brain I'd made the (simply incorrect) connection that NVL = old games. It was one of the deciding factors for me in whether or not I should read something.  Eventually I realized how silly that was, and by the time I finished Fate/stay night I had gotten used to it. Some stories are just told better in NVL style. It tends to flow more smoothly and a good scenario writer should be able to exploit some of the quirks of the format in their storytelling.  Though, honestly, I think my favourite use of the NVL format is when it's mixed into a game that is normally ADV. Grisaia used it for its flashback scenes, Clannad for its Illusionary World scenes, and so on.  In those cases (and many others) it's used incredibly well as a delineator between two things. Taking Grisaia as our example, the switch to NVL serves as a subtle indicator to the reader that the events being described in the story aren't currently happening. They're being told in flashback, and perhaps not even from Yuuji's perspective. Similarly, other games have used this technique to exposit out-of-character knowledge. If you need a way to show a cut-away scene that the protagonist doesn't know is happening, then contrasting the normal ADV format with a brief NVL scene is a good way to contrast that and to tell the player what is going on."
visualnovels,3dq2cz,sirflimflam,2,Sun Jul 19 12:51:48 2015 UTC,"It's almost the same to me, really.  Unless it is top notch (Steins;Gate for example) i don't listen to the voice acting (please don't lynch me) because i read too fast (i can't understand jap, plus it distracts me so i can't speed-read) and by the time i've finished reading a sentence the character is still in the middle of talking (or he's just begun talking, also whenever i roll the mouse wheel -no pun intended- the previous char stops talking and another one begins, therefore it quickly becomes a mess of funny noises). If there are many characters NVL can become a bit troublesome, but it really does give you a superior sense of immersion.  ADV really cannot do that, because if there's a change or something happens you have to move your eyes and stop reading for a split moment.  NVL has a minor drawback though: it might be just a problem of mine, but whenever i'm checking the textlog i often find myself thinking ""who the hell said what"" and it can be confusing."
visualnovels,3dq2cz,kahrkunne,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:04:30 2015 UTC,"It bothers me, but I get used to it. Many of them have a button to hide the text/black overlay to see underneath it for CGs and whatnot. I have seen some people quite adamant that NVL provides better flow for the reading, but considering you still have to click for each line I just can't see how that is possibly true."
visualnovels,3dq2cz,AlexHusky,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:11:01 2015 UTC,"Nope, it doesn't bother me except if I really want to see the CG (which isn't that often). If that happens, the VN usually has a feature to hide the text, so it's good and all. In fact, I actually like it quite well. I can read the text while my eyes also see the change of the sprites."
visualnovels,3dq2cz,adrixshadow,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:35:37 2015 UTC,"The NVL format doesn't bother me, but I personally prefer the ADV format more simply because I prefer dialogue driven stories more than narrative driven ones. I won't knock NVL though. I've read a few I quite liked.   My sweet spot is ADV stories with NVL elements when pertinent (info dumps, diaries, various exposition, etc)"
visualnovels,3dq2cz,fluffyharpy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:29:41 2015 UTC,"""how it's done everywhere else"" I mean, it's true that ADV format is more popular, but I wouldn't say that it's ""done everywhere else"". There should be a key for you to hide the text if you really want to admire the CG.  Anyways, NVL is nice for VNs that contain a lot of text, because it doesn't limit line length as much and the likes. It also allows the author to do some things like THIS CHAIR in tsukihime that wouldn't really work all that well in ADV format. Also, it makes more sense for any kind of narration or internal monologue. ADV format makes sense if the VN consists mostly of characters talking, but if there's a lot of narration or internal monologue (which there is A LOT of in F/SN and all type-moon works) then NVL format makes more sense."

At first I intended to do it alone, but it would take a long time to learn all the tracks, and with the low number of novels I've read I would probably not be able to pick out a good setlist on my own.  I would like to mention that I would not pick a limited amount of people based on their skill at the instrument, but that the people involved could cover tracks that they like, so we don't have the same people playing every track.

I've been working my way through the Melty Blood story mode, but it just doesn't hold my interest very well. I almost wish I could just have a script of it to read.   How's the weather?    It is hot. Most days are in the 90s but feel over 100. When it isn't hot, it is thunderstorming. Normal weather for this time of year though."
visualnovels,3dnd1h,AdelKoenig,3,Fri Jul 17 18:26:10 2015 UTC,"Ive been interested in playing Blazblue series. Since Chronophantasma Extend just came out Im playing Continuum Shift Extend to get a sense of the story, characters and general battle style of the first 2 games.  Does/has anyone played any of the Blazblue games? What do you think of the story/characters (apparently its visual novel-style ish)? Anyone have chrono phantasma extend yet?"
visualnovels,3dnd1h,superange128,3,Fri Jul 17 19:09:12 2015 UTC,"I suck at fighting games (except somewhat Smash), but I played CSE for its story alone. In my opinion it has a great and fascinating world (science fantasy is always a plus) and the characters are all likeable. And damn, Hazama comes close to Edgey... Ahem, the story is also decent and grand (and sometimes kitschy, but in a good sense), but quite confusing and hard to grasp at the beginning. You basically never get to see a canon storyline and have to piece everything together to somewhat get a feeling for what's going on between the characters. The characters are most important in the BB universe and their connections, their backgrounds and their motivations.  The battles are for once supporting and enhancing the story. Often characters face each other sharing a difficult common past (or it's just a badass epic fight), so having to actively fight underlines the story and the intensity of the situation. God, every encounter including two of {Noel, Jin, Tsubaki} was pretty tough, and I don't mean that in a gameplay-sense.  I wanted to play Calamity Trigger for a while now to understand even more of the BB universe, and maybe I will do that now."
visualnovels,3dnd1h,8cccc9,2,Fri Jul 17 19:41:51 2015 UTC,"Haha I also suck at any fighting game that isn't Smash Bros (which I think I'm decent at) but I'm working to hopefully at least get alright at some (Blazblue, Street Fighter, and maybe some anime crossover fighters)"
visualnovels,3dnd1h,superange128,2,Fri Jul 17 20:40:32 2015 UTC,"I tried SF4 for PC once, and no thanks, I can't even beat the easiest COM. I generally suck at combo heavy fighting games, I never get them right, which is a bit detrimental in BB. I couldn't even finish the tutorial there as I couldn't copy the ridiculous long combos presented to me by rabbit.  I gave up any hope to get better, except in Smash4, where I'm actually making progress."
visualnovels,3dnd1h,8cccc9,3,Fri Jul 17 20:51:37 2015 UTC,I actually like how Smash Bros is a bit easier to get into and relies less on ridiculous memorization of long combos and more doing well in neutral and reads and stuff.
visualnovels,3dnd1h,superange128,2,Fri Jul 17 21:03:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Anime fighting games tend to have long combos and a plethora of game mechanics to go along with it.  Whilst I haven't played it, Streetfighter is a decent game to get into if you don't like long combos and if you're more interested in the neutral game. If you watch a lot of high level play, most of the combos are about 3-6 moves long."
visualnovels,3dnd1h,Shotgun_Diplomacy,2,Fri Jul 17 21:48:17 2015 UTC,Ultra Street Fighter IV is basically the only 2D Fighter not named Smash Bros. I don't just automatically get my ass beat at (but my winrate still isn't particularly good).  I hope I can eventually get into the combo-heavy games since some of those fighters have interesting moveset and series-particular features.
visualnovels,3dnd1h,superange128,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:48:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, right now anime fighting games like Persona and Guilty Gear are the ones I want to get into. Just because I prefer the character designs and for me they feel flashier with their supers, insta-kills and game mechanics. Or maybe it's just because I like anime... eh. (Rise has this Super that turns Persona 4 Arena into Persona 4 Dancing all Night  Though I may pick up up SFV just to try it out and see how it feels.  Unfortunately right now, learning fighting games isn't that feasible for me due to my potato quality internet and there's only so much you can do in training mode. Right now I mainly watch tournament streams so I don't mind it but I do want to get into fighting games in future."
visualnovels,3dnd1h,Shotgun_Diplomacy,2,Fri Jul 17 23:23:36 2015 UTC,"Persona    Persona 4 Arena is really bad. You can literally mash a single button to perform powerful combos.   Guilty Gear   I've only played Guilty Gear X, but I enjoyed it a lot. The characters are all pretty interesting and have different play styles."
visualnovels,3dnd1h,ctom42,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:33:03 2015 UTC,"Persona 4 Arena is really bad. You can literally mash a single button to perform powerful combos.   Yeah autocombos, they're present in a few arcsys games but I don't think they're bad.  ArcSys balances it by having them not do max damage and the combo that each character performs is not optimal. So if you do the specific inputs yourself, you'll do a lot more damage.  If you watch top level play, they will almost never do autocombos since players have their own combos that do optimal damage.  I think autocombos makes it slightly more beginner friendly since fighting games and especially anime fighting games can be complex."

visualnovels,3dnd1h,ctom42,3,Fri Jul 17 20:01:39 2015 UTC,"Melty Blood is an absolutely phenomenal fighting game. The cast is beyond massive and it's fun to mash as well as actually try and learn (though combos are obscenely long and varied for whom you're fighting). As a bonus, because of its low system spec requirements and easy to set up net play I also managed to get my friends to play it as well even though they have no interest in Tsukihime (though a couple did watch Fate/Zero beforehand).  Only real spinoff I've played other than that though was Fate/Extra which was a passable grindy jrpg.  I should try and get my friends to try that Umineko one..."

The only other spinoff of VN's I've read that I know of is Higurashi Daybreak which is a third person shooter arena game I think? I've been wanting to play but have been too lazy to, but it's made by Twilight Frontier so I would hope it's good."

visualnovels,3dnd1h,superange128,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:44:17 2015 UTC,There is an online mode but I have never tried it. The game is not too intensive so I would be surprised if your computer could not handle it.

Apart from melty, the only game that I know of that is based off characters from VNs is Aquapazza. It's a fighting game though it features characters from VNs that I haven't read before (Utawarerumono, To Heart, White Album etc.)  I've only watched a few matches but it looks alright. I think there's a side tournament for it at AnimEVO.  Oh wait, there is a new fighting game coming out called Nitroplus blasterz which feature characters from various Nitroplus titles such as Saya from Saya no Uta and Al Azif from Demonbane. It also features Saber from F/SN and I think Akane from Psycho-Pass is available as a partner character. Here are a few screenshots and character gameplay videos. It doesn't look too shabby."

Just did a quick google search, it's called Phantom Breaker and it's made by 5pb. Two Science Adventure characters are guest characters in the most recent version, Kurisu (S;G) and Rimi (C;H). No idea if the game is any good."

I stalled it halfway through and only got it because the OST is composed by Takeshi Abo. It's more like a brawler like Streets of Rage with an upgrading system, so don't expect much from it.  Also, Kurisu is a DLC character and doesn't have a story mode (which is pretty modest in my opinion)."

That and I had heard that it's fantastic, so I wanted to see it for myself.  Everyone was right. Rocket League IS fantastic. I haven't had this much fun with a multiplayer game in years (probably since Tribes: Ascend). The controls are tight, it's really easy to get the hang of (I only started playing yesterday and I'm already pulling off some crazy moves), and the sheer chaos that each match becomes-with everyone crashing into each other and the ball bouncing all over the arena-entertains me to no end.  I'm going to be playing this one for a long time."

I listen to it mostly when I'm out walking.  I also re-discovered In Flames, I seriously love most of their albums, I just haven't listened to the band for a few years now.

From the past few days, it seems that I've been arbitrarily choosing random playlists off of Spotify.   When I'm in the mood to read visual novels (like right now, in the summer), I tend not to listen to that much Japanese music, since the composition/style of music feels too similar to whichever work I'm reading. In this sense, Spotify is the best way to listen to a different type of music."

visualnovels,3dm83h,shadowspark2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:22:14 2015 UTC,"I thought the drama category was already a bit overloaded. But more importantly I personally do think it's a good representation of romance. It's just also a drama. Though I see your point and partially agree, I'm leaving it nominated. If you don't think it'd be a good fit as one of the romance VNs on the chart, you can just vote against it/not vote for it (:  Clannad would be a really good fit for the Romance genre. But I'm not a fan of it myself, so I didn't nominate it.  Utsuge would fit pretty well, but that's not going to be a separate category on the chart."

Mystery and horror goes well hand in hand anyway so it doesn't matter that much. Just curious is all.

Slice of life is a phrase describing the use of mundane realism depicting everyday experiences (from wiki)  And muv luv extra is not really that. Extra might be (but like I said, I would sooner put it on comedy), but unlimited is not a ""mundane realistic"" story."
visualnovels,3dm83h,FinalNwo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:54:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's just me, but isn't slice of life everyday experiences in the respective universe? If a VN has lots of normal interactions with characters and normal activities, it is slice of life, regardless if there is something we don't have, like dragons, catgirls or mecha. Those things aren't realistic from our perspective, but in that world it's considered normal and is part of the characters' daily lives."
visualnovels,3dm83h,ctom42,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:36:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with this definition. I've seen people take the ""mundane"" part of SoL way too far. Someone over on /r/anime was trying to convince me that Space Brothers was not SoL because Astronauts have an interesting job."

visualnovels,3dm83h,JCAPER,0,Fri Jul 17 23:44:08 2015 UTC,"I see where you are coming from, but I would hesitate calling a Fantasy setting story a slice of life.  Because I think that the term is only applied to normal settings like our world. Even if the story happens in the future and is a slice of life kind of thing, I don't think it can be considered a slice of life the moment there are flying cars and what not. It becomes a sci-fi the moment those appear. Same thing for fantasy, because the moment a dragon appears, it ceases to be a slice of life. Because slice of life is about mundane realism depicting everyday experiences. (from our perspective, not from the characters)  I at least never saw a slice of life that happens in other kind of settings. I might be wrong and maybe under certain requirements a fantasy story can be considered a slice of life, but I don't know any examples like that.  And imo, muv luv is far away from a slice of life. Yeah, I know I'm sounding like a broken record, but... Yeah :\"
visualnovels,3dm83h,Cornetto_Man,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:27:42 2015 UTC,"But if you think about it it's still a slice of life. Not of our life but of the life of whatever world the story is in. It may be a fantasy world with dragons but for that world and its inhabitants dragons are an everyday occurrence. Look at Shuffle, a VN I would 100% call a slice of live novel. Yet that game takes place in a world where humans, gods and devils live together. Yet the events of the game are nothing special. Just a ""slice"" of these character's everyday lives."
visualnovels,3dm83h,JCAPER,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:28:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, but I think that that definition must be taken from our perspective. Otherwise we could also consider Alternative and many others (if not all, if we stretch a bit) slices of life. Because in their perspective, it's a common ocorrence what's happening around them.  The example you gave is a good one though. Fantasy and slice of life. But on the other hand, the VN focuses more on the slice of life elements than the fantasy ones (to the point where we can forget for a moment that there are demons and whatnot), and is set on our day and age.  Another definition of it is: showing what ordinary life is like. And that's pretty much what Shuffle does.  If you go check the VNDB, Muv Luv is not listed as a slice of life."
visualnovels,3dm83h,Cornetto_Man,0,Fri Jul 17 23:44:47 2015 UTC,"Otherwise we could also consider Alternative and many others (if not all, if we stretch a bit) slices of life.   No you couldn't. You could call Unlimited one but not Alternative. The events of Alternative are in no way ""everyday events"". Heck   It's funny that you used VNDB there since the very description used contradicts your view on it   A slice of life story is a category for a story that portrays a ""cut-out"" sequence of events in a character's life.  It usually tries to depict the every-day life of ordinary people, sometimes with fantasy or science fiction elements involved.  Slice of life stories may either be dramatic or otherwise presented in a very serious nature, or may be used to help frame a comedic setting."
visualnovels,3dm83h,JCAPER,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:01:46 2015 UTC,"Why not Alternative? Alternative also has moments where the character is having normal days. And those ""actually happen"" also happen in Unlimited.  Also, it doesn't contradict what I said. Sure, it contradicts what I said 2 replies ago but I admited in the previous one that there are exceptions. In fact, that definition even proves more my point, since no one in Unlimited is an ordinary person."

visualnovels,3dj8cd,Freshy_Q,3,Thu Jul 16 19:10:54 2015 UTC,I really like the colors to fit the scenery but it kind of looks like Lucia's standing in nothingness. I think some faint outlines of several sunflowers could give the wallpaper perspective.     It seems a lot of people are asking for a darker background but it makes sense that the bright lighting around her makes her stand out too much.   I was wondering if the right side of the wallpaper could be darker while keeping the area around Lucia the current shade to compensate for that?  Great wallpaper though.
visualnovels,3dj8cd,mystry08,2,Fri Jul 17 02:58:43 2015 UTC,I made the background green and yellow because it fit the theme of sunflowers.   I appreciate any constructive criticism on how to make it better.

visualnovels,3djhix,Delti9,3,Thu Jul 16 22:10:57 2015 UTC,"Koihime Musou has a similar system if you ever wanted another game like that.  You essentially progress through the main story line, and every couple of in-game days you have the option to 'visit' one of the heroines. You can spend all of your visits to one heroine or spread them out, but each heroine has they're own 'mini story line' which progresses through these visits.  Although, there is some strategic styled game play which may or may not be your cup of tea (although iirc, you might be able to turn that off?)."

Just cause it brings a finale to the story instead of it just being about seeing the heroine routes (like Grisaia although that at least has sequels for that purpose). I guess something where the main story still progress no matter what route you're on would work well with me too.
visualnovels,3djhix,Sealophile,4,Thu Jul 16 22:59:05 2015 UTC,"I'm the same way. For me at least, a true end actually 'ends' the story. The climax, the ENDING.

Having choices causes the player to feel more engaged and invested with the story in most cases, and often leads to the player thinking more about the story than they would have otherwise.   I also think that debates between which route is best is inevitable regardless of the involvement of heroines/heroes. If a choice can be made, then people who feel that a certain answer is better will have reasons for thinking so, which also causes them to want to defend their opinion. I think having a route for each girl is fine as long as the reason for the route isn't to give each girl a route, but rather to flesh each character out.

I think it's just appealing to intrinsic human nature, we all will like some characters more than others. While I understand that devoting an entire section of story to revolve one character could be interpreted as pandering, I wouldn't classify it as such.

This happens even with games with a lot of story to them too. Just look at Grisaia. Pretty much every thread on here about it devolves into a discussion on which girl they like best. I find that kind of sad since there are two routes with a lot of character development (especially for Yuuji) that would be fun to talk about.

However, I do understand why you would like kinetic novels more now. Without the concept of routes, you would have more discussion about the story rather than the characters.   Alas I still personally enjoy the idea of routes since I'm able to invest in characters I want to learn more about while ignoring the characters that don't interest me. That benefit outweighs any discussions that I could just ignore online lol.   Thanks for elaborating though. :)"

For example, /u/Taedirk brought up Virute's Last Reward. This reminds me of some of the major storyline choices in 999 and how awful they were. What, I'm going to die because I didn't want to learn about science trivia while I was about to perish in a fucking freezer? I could have learned about Ice-9 later. I'm not insane enough to sew up old socks when I can get 6 pairs for $3, so I'm locked out of the good end? Bullshit.  When games present you with small, daily-life-style choices that don't have direct impact on the main storyline, then they shouldn't get blown out of proportion as huge game changers."

Not a single interaction, just sit back and read.  If it has to have routes, I rather like the enforced route order, but not necessarily F/SN's system and its, albeit extremely funny, load of bad endings. Something simpler.  And if it has to have heroine routes, I'd take a system a la Hoshizora no Memoria. Blatant flags, unlockable/true routes."
visualnovels,3djhix,BLoyola,3,Thu Jul 16 21:13:12 2015 UTC,"As an adventure veteran I found Adrift's route selection system quite intriguing. At the beginning of the VN some event happens and you now have to find a solution to the problem this event caused. So you change locations, interact through different means with each location or character and depending on the solution you found you get on another route. Or get a bad end or get stuck because it isn't easy to find all possible ways. The 'common route' here is practically a typical point-and-click adventure game, which I found to be pretty neat :)."

You have access to all routes but the true route at the start of the game. Each route has their own contained story, but also contains hints at an overlying story as well (Some being more prominent than others) that becomes clearer as you complete more routes. Once you have completed all of the routes, you should have a pretty decent grasp on what the other routes were hinting at when related to the underlying story. Then you can play through the game again and new options are available and you can access the true route."

In the heroine routes, 3 of them have two endings, the primary heroine end and secondary heroine end. (2 h-scenes for each  primary heroine and 1 for each secondary heroine) The other one only features the main-heroine.

Do you think having the hours icons simply represent themselves and have a separate legend that indicates the time length would help with give some more open air with the chart? For instance, the negative space on the bottom left, at least to me, looks a little bit awkward. There also may be problems if a visual novel has a lot of genres. Removing the caption may be less immediately intuitive for someone to go, ""Oh! This is >50 hours long!"" though since they'd have to refer to the chart at times.  Here is a preview with the hours captions removed. If we're including a myriad of genres for certain visual novels, having the additional space could help too.  Let's make the chart awesome!

If you've read Higurashi, I highly recommend reading Saikoroshi-hen (the first arc of Rei) as well. It's a very short, but sweet epilogue which concerns general Higurashi spoilers (1-8)"
visualnovels,3dbqe7,Rastagong,2,Wed Jul 15 10:53:58 2015 UTC,"Can anyone explain exactly what this patch adds? I looked at the link but it was not clear, and when I looked up Higurashi Sui the wiki just said that it was a PS3/PSP game that included the main 8 arcs and all the other console exclusive arcs for 20 total."
visualnovels,3dbqe7,ctom42,5,Wed Jul 15 11:27:50 2015 UTC,"I didn't understand before trying either!   It basically adds the translations of the two later arcs of Higurashi Rei, which were untranslated to this day. There's also the translation of the first arc, but I'm not sure if it's a new translation or the one that was already available.  It also adds the option to use the PS3 sprites from Higurashi Sui. There's no menu for that, but there are several nscript.dat files in the patch folder. Depending on the one you put in the game folder, you can get the original sprites or the PS3 sprites, the Japanese honorifics, the translated honorifics or no honorifics at all."
visualnovels,3dbqe7,Rastagong,2,Wed Jul 15 12:13:05 2015 UTC,"Oh ok, so it does not add any arcs that were not already on the PC, got it. I'm really surprised it took this long for Rei to finish being translated though."

visualnovels,3d9ft9,The_Bunny_Advocate,20,Tue Jul 14 15:17:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think sorting by genres is a great idea, because I believe there in no 'genre balance', some popular genres will have a ton of titles, others - barely two or even one, which would look weird on a chart. Also there is a problem of VNs which belong to the number of genres at the same time.  Personally I would suggest doing a number of smaller lists, like this:   By mood: Light with warm/happy stories and comedies; grey with more complicated atmosphere and mood whiplashes; dark for emotionally heavy or depressing stuff By romance: from romance-oriented VNs to VNs with romance but not as their core element to VNs that are not really about romance By length AND pacing combo By amount of action By amount of choices (from kinetic to Yu-No) etc, etc"
visualnovels,3d9ft9,Ewig_Custos,8,Tue Jul 14 16:02:02 2015 UTC,"The problem with doing lists with more technical tags like that instead of by genre is that it makes it easier at a glance to find something you're interested in when they're grouped as genre.  If I'm interested in Mystery or Detective stories, I can scroll down and see a list of all the recommendations for VNs that have that as their primary tag. With the alternate system, it'd be much harder to find what I'm looking for, unless I'm really interested in seeing a list of all the kinetic novels (which is actually a good category - I'd vote for that one)."
visualnovels,3d9ft9,The_Dran,3,Tue Jul 14 16:14:20 2015 UTC,"True enough. It's perfectly fine (in fact, great) if there're several lists including the main one with genres, all I'm saying is that if there's only list with genres, sooner or later there'll appear a VN which cannot really be classified by basic genres but still deserves to be mentioned, which will most definitely lead to stretching the 'borders' of genres or even requiring their personal not genre-related category - in fact, you can already see that with ""crazy lists"" propositions."
visualnovels,3d9ft9,Ewig_Custos,5,Tue Jul 14 16:58:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I guess that could be part of the reason why the original 4chan charts only ever split them into starter VNs and everything else.

visualnovels,3d9ft9,The_Dran,4,Tue Jul 14 17:07:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah there are definitely going to be some flaws with a list like this, but it's not meant to be a comprehensive list, just an introduction to the medium for a newbie showcasing the range of genres available. I like your ideas though, perhaps we could create a few alternative lists afterwards to to sit alongside this new chart."

Mind screw?"

Steins;Gate is also a thriller as well and even a drama to a certain extent. Something to keep in mind.

visualnovels,3d9ft9,Rockmanll,5,Tue Jul 14 17:23:08 2015 UTC,"That's a clever idea, I'll pass it on to insanity, see what she thinks. I think my main concern would be how it looks as we increase the number of genres, it may become rather confusing with so many different colours."
visualnovels,3d9ft9,Legitheals,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:28:14 2015 UTC,You could just alternate two colors. I do that with excel spreadsheets all the time so that they don't look too stale.
visualnovels,3d9ft9,ctom42,3,Tue Jul 14 19:02:22 2015 UTC,That would not serve the purpose for which these colors are being suggested. They are functioning to identify genres so you would need a unique color for each genre.
visualnovels,3d9ft9,superange128,3,Tue Jul 14 19:09:17 2015 UTC,"I think the concept is that each genre would have a unique colour code, so you could just have a sequence of colours next to each VN to list the genres? If so then alternating colours wouldn't work sadly."
visualnovels,3d9ft9,lamoragirl,2,Tue Jul 14 19:09:21 2015 UTC,"I also suggest having the poll have both ""Is this a good genre to include in the image?"" and a ""List up to 5 VNs you would consider recommending in this genre"" questions.  Because if everyone thinks ""Shounen Action featuring mythical heroes in a modern day battle royale setting"" is an excellent genre to include, but there's only one game suggested in that genre, it might not be the best for the chart.   Having everyone list the games they would put in there gives you a picture of what games people think belong too, and that'll help deciding which genres are best to include."
visualnovels,3d9ft9,Joby05,2,Tue Jul 14 18:37:18 2015 UTC,"We originally considered asking for VNs alongside the genres, but with the large number of genres under consideration it seemed a huge hassle for both those voting and for us collecting the data. We aren't stictly bound to how the votes turn out, we can use our own judgement, so if a problem category like ""Shounen Action featuring mythical heroes in a modern day battle royale setting"" somehow makes it into the list I'm sure we can work around it (:  In the worst case, we can drop a genre if it goes badly once we start trying to assign VNs to it."

visualnovels,3d9ft9,dja2000,3,Tue Jul 14 23:38:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe we could add sub genres to each visual novel in a list? For e.g. you have action which has Muv-Luv and Fate/Stay Night and then you have sub genres for Muv-Luv obviously being sci-fi, mecha and Fate/Stay Night being fantasy. This would solve the problem of some visual novels being outside the normal genres or giving a bit more information about individual ones. Edit: Also I just realised they recommended Yume Miru Kusuri so I don't think we need to worry about our bad taste."

Just fill out user name, the character on your flair, and what series the character comes from. If a character has multiple flairs you can describe which one you use (though that's optional).  After about a week or so I'll make another topic with the results. Hopefully we can get a decent amount of votes!"

If they ever did something like this for my digital collection of Vita or PS3 games I'd be extremely upset, and this shows that they could one day contemplate doing that once those systems are sufficiently unpopular.

The combination of such an dramatic song (Onaji Hoshi ni Umarete) in tandem with Isuzu's cries of earnest sorrow really create a dynamite scenario that left quite an impression on me. I got chills and was at the edge of my seat the first time I read this scene.   Give it back... Give it back to me!  I still wanted to use it...  It was fine, even if you could only see darkness!  It was only good because of the darkness!  Yet, you destroyed it...  You destroyed my memories!   While I think that Isuzu's route is rather weak, and I myself do not care too much for the character, I find this to be one of the most emotionally charged scenes among the visual novels I have read. Although other visual novels do have similarly emotional scenes in terms of context, I've not found one else that compares simply on the basis that it lacked a fitting BGM."

But context is basically the MC on his way to the big bad to take back everything that's been taken from him (includes people). Great mood music (Shade is godlike).  Mood Summary: Just wait, I'm on the way!  (Baldr Sky) - Not sure if it's anything special out of context (a few friends weren't impressed), but the ending theme Nano Universe(video contains game CG, mild spoilers at end). Its at the end of a really long game, and the MC has been through a lot by then. And then it's finally over, MC gets to rest, and there's this wonderful feeling of relief (while this plays).  Mood Summary: End of a long journey (Muramasa's ending, 落葉(fallen leaves), fits this as well).  (OtomeRiro) - パンがなければ飢え死にすればいいじゃない(If they have no bread, just let them starve). Plays during the reveal of the mastermind behind certain events! Can't say much more than that besides it being a super great scene.

However these songs are used for almost every time when a specific scene plays so they get repetitive. So my absolute favorite songs are those that are used rarely and not just used Anytime, Anywhere. Songs that make you want to Close Your Eyes and feel like a Samurai, go To Where You are or even back to your Noisy Sweet Home to go Remembering the Past.   tl;dr Whenever the songs in bold play."

Oddly enough, many of the VAs from Koiken Otome are also in this game... and that game felt like it wasted its seiyuu talent.  I heard a lot about this from Getchu's 2014 ranking(Luna winning many years in a row), so it got me curious. Its been like 1-2 years since I got some formal JP education, so I believe the most I can read out of this is around 40-70%. Rest is with constant dictionary assistance. I honestly don't think I'm doing it justice, but even then, I found it really enjoyable. So far I'm at about when Asashi, and his bunch just finished the school ceremony(Still in prologue most likely).  At this point, I'm not sure whether I'm turning gay for Asahi, or more infatuated with Luna. Asahi feels really pure, and lovable(best girl status, but he's a guy), and Luna is like..its hard to express in words, but lovable.  Asashi and Luna's VA seem to fit really well too, and I feel an irrational love for both of them.They are really meant for each other, is the feeling I'm getting so far.  Ursule with her bizarre Japanese and Minato with her osanajimi infatuation seem to be quite different from the normal, so I find them pretty interesting, and not shallow characters. Risona is probably my favorite side character for now, simply because she's speaks funny, and is a brocon. However Mizuho seems to be lacking. I don't really see Mizuho contributing much so far other than ""want to take Asahi home"" for herself. Seems a bit shallow, but we'll see. Still don't know how to feel about Aeon yet, but he's scary is all I can say so far.  I don't know how to feel anymore. I used to hate Navel because Shuffle was a god awful experience for me, but now I really love them for this. Huh."

visualnovels,3d5hk4,mdzjdz,5,Tue Jul 14 08:41:30 2015 UTC,"I finished reading Mirai Nostalgia.   It had far too much slice of life for my liking. It's basically a character game with marginally heavier drama/story towards the end. The characters in themselves weren't bad; each character (even the twins) had full, unique routes. Only half of the routes ultimately ended up 'mattering' to the true conclusion (i.e. the rest of the routes while in themselves, meaningful, were separated from the purpose of the work).   Ultimately, it was disappointing. Like Chrono Clock, I had expected that a game with time travel would actually focus on it to an extent. The time travel mechanic in Mirai Nostalgia is comparatively significant, but it's not really developed that much (making some plot developments seem deus ex; not because they're fundamentally impossible, but because there wasn't enough development). Had the work been more focused, I think it could've been much better (as it had a good concept).   I'm still not sure as to what work I'll read next, though."
visualnovels,3d5hk4,sirflimflam,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:18:45 2015 UTC,Interesting. I had no idea the developers of Chrono Clock seem to have a history of creating stories based around time travel where the time travel is in itself pretty insubstantial.

visualnovels,3d5hk4,temporalreality,7,Thu Jul 16 03:56:50 2015 UTC,"I'm reading Aiyoku no Eustia.  I finished Fione's arc a few minutes ago. This is somewhat of a milestone for me because the partial patch that was released over two years ago covered the game up to this point. Awhile ago, I decided that if I ever knew Japanese well enough, I'd read Eustia before anything else. Well, I've been studying the language every day for about ten months now, but I didn't feel comfortable reading something this long until I'd finished RTK and the Core 6K, though I did play Tales of Zestiria in the meantime.  Overall, my impression of the story thus far is almost the same as when I read it in English. Of course, I can't recall how accurate or well written the translation was, but the characters, setting, and plot are just as wonderful as I had remembered them. The dialogue is consistently interesting with great banter, the circumstances surrounding 牢獄 are fascinating, and the pacing may be slow, but no scene feels extraneous.  My only complaint is that I preferred the prologue to Fione's arc. Caim and Eustia's relationship is, so far, one of my favorite aspects of the story. While the investigation of 黒羽 was interesting, I wasn't invested in the relationship between Caim and Fione, and none of the revelations at climax were particularly unexpected.  As for the writing, I'd recommend Eustia as a beginner's novel if you'd rather begin with something plot-oriented. The vocabulary can be quite extensive, but the lines rarely exceed more than fifty characters. As for the prose itself, I would describe it as emotive despite its simplicity.  I'm looking forward to what comes next! I've waited a long time for this."
visualnovels,3d5hk4,nogaku,3,Tue Jul 14 21:04:12 2015 UTC,"Finished reading Axanael. I figured this VN would be more plot-oriented and have a slight tinge of genreshifting element added to it based on the fact that it's by Nitro+. Well, truth be told, I enjoyed this much more than I expected given the rating of the VN by the vndb community (only 7.4/10?).   Granted, I read the initial unavoidable bad end of the character that I chose in the prologue and the HAPPY NEW YEAR True End, but I think that's general enough to actually summarize the experience offered by this VN (and the other route endings don't seem particularly canon-worthy to boot, too).  There's no better way to describe Axanael other than that this is basically ""all characters do their own thing at the start and everyone meets and gathers together to end the story in a grandiose finale"" style that's reminiscent of Durarara and Baccano.   And as anyone would guess at this moment, that just goes to show that Axanael is one heck of a good VN by my standard. Admittedly, I actually grew to empathize with the main characters (like Nitori who's just a spineless NEET--not that I'm empathizing with his NEET-ness--and Sakura whose straightforward nature could be considered selfish but also true to oneself), but I'd also concede that some may regard other characters to be too ""unrealistic"" or ""archetypal"", e.g. the Indian Guy (who I personally found exhilarating to be honest lol).   But the changes that every protagonists go through (there are 6 main characters = 4 girls and 2 guys, yes, 2 guys) never appear excessively emotionally driven to the point that you're not propelled to deny firsthand saying, 'That's just stupid', 'cause all 6 characters have their own problems that anyone living in this society would empathize in one way or another and when these characters come out on top at the end having confronted and dealt with their fear or anguish or regret, you, as the reader, are able to share that refreshingly cathartic feeling that the character him/herself would be feeling and that makes the VN as a whole a lot more endearing when all these characters that you've come to love gather together at the end to shout, '10, 9, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...HAPPY NEW YEAR!!'.  Well, reading Axanael was a hell of a blast and I actually hope that Nitro+, and other companies too, would release more ""hope-inducing"" VNs like Axanael."

The game mechanics are at first a bit obtrusive, but they're actually quite basic and the dice boardgame helps keeping things fresh (or exhausting). There's also a lot of content, after doing every route I only saw about 60% of the game. The characters are all diverse and mostly likeable and even if they're sometimes stereotypes, they're not bad at all. For example, the classic tsundere - Riho - has great character development.  Heartache 101 has a special atmosphere to it that I really liked. Also, the game is freeware and moddable, so you could create own routes and characters for it or download some new scenarios.

It is by far the most accessible of any work by 07th Expansion. I think it's actually a really great entry point into his work because it still shows off his writing style, but is not nearly as complex as Higu and Umi, while also not being nearly as dark as Higanbana.

visualnovels,3d10za,LeafCascade,2,Thu Jul 16 22:40:26 2015 UTC,"Basically, my understanding is that memorizing one or two books is not impossible for someone with an exceptionally good (as in, one-in-a-million) photographic memory. However this assumes that they've scanned over the book several times and have exerted some effort in order to commit it to memory. The described method of visually scanning the pages of a book and then reading it for the first time by recalling the image is almost certainly absurd. Maybe it could work if you're memorizing one or two pages with very distinctly memorable features, but recalling the exact image of hundreds of pages, including their internal order, and being able to maintain their image and navigate through them while at the same time also processing visual information from memory and reading (possibly subvocalizing it) just indicates such a massive mental effort that I find it extremely doubtful.  Doing this with dozens of different books simultaneously and enjoying perfect and instant recall is probably lightyears beyond what even the most gifted humans could ever hope to do. Especially at a young age.      Grisaia no Kajitsu"
visualnovels,3d10za,MiyaMiyako,3,Thu Jul 16 22:50:32 2015 UTC,"Eidetic Memory.  No adult has ever been shown to possess this skill under scientific conditions.  The article claims some children can do it, but this claim is not well-sourced.  There is a real condition known as Hyperthymesia, in which a person remembers their personal life in extraordinary detail, but not anything so impersonal as the pages of a book.  This condition seems to coincide with significant difficulty with other mental tasks.  Anecdotally, I felt I had a lesser form of this ability while I was in Elementary School and partway through Middle School.  When studying from my textbooks, I would memorize the information as a complete page.  When recalling it later, I remembered exactly the wording used in the text, where that text appeared on the page, what pictures surrounded the text, and usually the page number as well.  It wasn't an instant thing like depicted in Grisaia;  I had to read the text before I could remember it, and I wasn't able to learn anything new by examining my memories.  I attribute  this ability to my undiagnosed ADHD;  I was learning things at a much slower rate than others, so I still had virgin swathes of memory space in my brain."

visualnovels,3d10za,Dan_Tsukasa,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:40:42 2015 UTC,"There's /r/vndevs which is pretty dead, but might be worth throwing a question up there.  /r/gamedev might not be specific to VNs, but it's got some good resources as well.  For specific Ren'py technical questions, the Ren'py forums are probably going to be the best place though.  And there's always this board.  If you have general questions about VNs throwing a question into the weekly questions thread, or making your own post if you think it's a full discussion topic will definitely get some responses if it's a good question."

Was more so hoping to find a few experts or regular users of renpy to throw a few questions at. As I could make the game in unity, but I'd have to code a fair bit from scratch, but if I'm going to have to wrestle against the engine when using Ren'py then it might not be the wisest idea for my idea.  Its more about that sort of thing.  I'll try out the forums thanks."

With my little to no knowledge of Japanese I will caution that Umineko likes to have tricky wording. There are a lot of things that involve the exact phrasing allowing for loopholes and such. So it might not be the best work to read in Japanese if you are not fluent, regardless of how difficult the acutal vocab and grammar is.  Think about it this way, would you be comfortable solving tricky riddles in Japanese?

Yeah, see I was fine solving the clues and catching the ""mistakes/lies"" in Danganronpa without looking at a guide, so I think that gave me courage to attempt other visual novels in Japanese. I've been living in Japan for a couple of years, so I get a lot of chances to read and speak on a daily basis.   I think I'll give it a chance.

visualnovels,3d10za,biggest_decision,3,Wed Jul 15 07:16:19 2015 UTC,"Yes you should be able to apply the english patch to it. I will caution you that Umineko is a lot more complicated than Danganronpa. It is a nearly 200 hour read with a lot of subtle foreshadowing, trick logic, precise wording, and intentional misdirection. It is a work that people read 2 or 3 times to fully understand in their own language, let alone in one that they are still learning.  I wish you the best of luck on your endeavour, but don't hesitate to switch to English if you think you are missing out on even minor details. Everything is important."

It's easy to keep track of the very active users and mods and what character flairs they use but there are plenty of people who mostly lurk or don't post too often.  Or do I have to make a random form/poll where people choose which character is in their flair and then tally up the results?
visualnovels,3d10za,superange128,2,Mon Jul 20 00:46:08 2015 UTC,"I wish there was, it would have been really useful in choosing which flairs to keep on the sidebar popup and which to move to the wiki page.

Although something weird has been happening. For some unknown reason, even if I'm not pressing any keys or clicking the screen, it suddenly scrolls up to the previous text. At first I can just scroll it down to continue, something that I don't really mind, but then suddenly it gets worse to a point where it gets stuck at this one part of the previous text and all attempts to return it back to the current text is useless.  I tried unplugging the mouse and the keyboard and it still persists. I tried restarting the VN and it still persists. Although restarting the PC makes it return to its original behavior, its still bothering me. I checked at Fate/Stay Night and Saya No Uta (didn't bother to check Nekopara and Fate/Hollow Ataraxia since I'm expecting that its not gonna persist) to see if it has the same problem there and it wasn't, it was really just Tsukihime.

""Wiping everything clean"" in that context meant ""reinstalling OS"", which is probably not going to achieve anything if your PC was just recently built. Cleaning the keyboard (or mouse, for that matter, since backlog can be used by scrolling the wheel), on the other hand, is not exactly irrelevant in this case, but I doubt that it's going to achieve anything.  Here's a random idea: go into the folder where Tsukihime is installed, right-click on the .exe file, enable XP compatibility mode, launch the VN and see if anything changed for the better.

visualnovels,3d01k7,HonestRage,6,Sun Jul 12 15:31:35 2015 UTC,"This is a minor point, but Koisuru Natsu no Last Resort's shortened abbreviation (or the one that the translation project uses) is 'KoiRizo' rather than 'KoiSuru.'   The latter is far vaguer than the former."
visualnovels,3d01k7,mdzjdz,3,Sun Jul 12 20:09:06 2015 UTC,"Noted. It's just that it's the only Koisuru that's been talked about lately in these threads, so I went with it. I will, however, use KoiRizo from now on in other situations because as you said, there are a lot of titles that begin with Koisuru."
visualnovels,3d01k7,HonestRage,5,Sun Jul 12 20:30:49 2015 UTC,"As mentioned, it really is a negligible/a minor point. It just seems odd seeing 'Koisuru' since literally translated, 'Koisuru' just means 'to do love.' KoiRizo would be translated to 'love resort,' which is a whole lot more specific/meaningful as an abbreviation."

How many more people back because it's $5 versus backing for any cheap amount of money because it looks interesting to them? I don't think they would have lost many backers by charging twice as much.   Also, the VN kind of looks bad, to be honest. It doesn't look so much like a type-moon inspired game, but a ripoff with bad art."

Manga Gamer doesn't actually have the license for Rance yet, it depends on how well their first Alicesoft game sells. That said since MG now has a partnership with Alicesoft and the fan translator is working for MG on the Alicesoft game that did get licensed, Rance got temporarily  shelved. You can expect progress and updates on it to return if/when it gets licensed."

Oh well, I didn't want to play it that much anyways ;_;  I'm sort of curious if the translators are holding off in the hopes that they can become the official translators or if it just out of respect for the devs. I would have a hard time just saying ""fuck it, let's pack up and not release everything we have done"" if I had worked on something for as long as they did just because of a ghost of a chance that the game gets officially released."
visualnovels,3d01k7,AkaiDown,2,Mon Jul 13 04:30:09 2015 UTC,"The translator for 5D and Quest has been working for Mangagamer on other titles for a while, and the one for 6 is now translating Haruka for them.

From what I've understood Introductory Chapter is completed, Closing Chapter is being translated and Coda is still 100% RAW. Still, I can't understand   What percentage of Closing Chapter has been translated? Has a patch already been released?  Is there some raw translation I can use to play one of the VNs?

The general consensus is to not to get your hopes up for the current translation.  Either learn Japanese yourself, or wait and hope that it gets picked up by a legitimate translation team."

visualnovels,3czfki,Sharpman972,20,Sun Jul 12 05:00:06 2015 UTC,For me it's exact opposite. As long as music is good I can forgive bad art. But I have yet to read a novel with BAD art so who knows how I'll react then. (No I don't consider Umineko art bad)
visualnovels,3czfki,paranoidcitizen,10,Sun Jul 12 08:13:42 2015 UTC,"I'm total opposite. While I appreciate good visuals, they are non-essential, whereas bad music constantly grates on me.

visualnovels,3czfki,Aexis_Skyen,8,Sun Jul 12 05:00:37 2015 UTC,Tsukihime is a good example of good VN with mediocre art and music.

visualnovels,3czfki,superange128,5,Sun Jul 12 21:25:11 2015 UTC,"It depends on how ""bad"" the art is. It doesn't have to be absolutely spectacular, and I also don't mind unconventional art styles (in fact, sometimes I enjoy them). If it's not ugly, I'm good. As for the music: if it's jarring/grating/hard to listen to for whatever the duration of gameplay, I'm probably going to rage quit. Otherwise, it needn't be spectacular as long as it's not distracting."
visualnovels,3czfki,Youbiseiharukana,10,Sun Jul 12 07:48:26 2015 UTC,"Nope, when i am choosing what to read next i don't know how good the story or the music is gonna be, the only thing i can see (besides a little synopsis that doesnt mean the story is gonna be good) is the art they did for their cover or at least what the sprites look like, if they can not make an effort and at the very least make the cover appealing i am not reading that VN"
visualnovels,3czfki,Gaporigo,4,Sun Jul 12 04:42:39 2015 UTC,"I usually get the first impression from art, so it definitely helps if it's looks good. As an example I would put IMHHW, which I probably wouldn't have read if the art was not gorgeous.  As for the bad art, it depends on what you see as bad. I have enjoyed some of the old doujin VNs which tend to have really low quality. The way I see it, low quality does not mean bad art as long as the VN has style. But it's definitely harder for a VN with low production value to catch my eye."
visualnovels,3czfki,jenykmrnous,4,Sun Jul 12 05:23:49 2015 UTC,"Step one, go to VoiceActorsAlliance, get some VAs for your work. Some will even do it gratis.   Step two, go to Bandcamp and Soundcloud, look through random offerings, find a group with a decent sound, ask them if you could use their music in the soundtrack for a cut of the profits.   Step three, go to Deviantart, look for people who make sprites and whatnot of OCs. Explain your situation, ask for a set.  If you can't do it: Outsource, outsource, outsource.   Because remember the rankings: ""This VN is great."" ""This VN is good."" ""This VN is good despite..."" ""This VN isn't all that good except..."" ""This VN isn't good.""  You're automatically at 3/5 or less when you give up on two main elements out the door. There's a ""despite"" statement built into your review before they even read the first text box. Your first impression is your most important one. There's lots of people who are willing to help, to collaborate.   Thinking on it in a different direction... Katawa Shoujo is probably the best amatuer visual novel. The art style is schizophrenic due to using multiple volunteers. The music is great but very short and prone to long repeating segments. But their best song? Their first ones. Their best art? They made an ANIMATED MOVIE of the opening. To nail the first impression. Because you don't see the story as the first impression, you see the art and hear the music. In the wise words of GTA4: ""Don't judge a book by its cover, but when a book is called 'no pants', I don't want to read it."".   Now, Katawa was in development hell for, like, ever. And you don't need to follow in Fourleaf Studios' footsteps. But read through their blog they made during development as amateur creators. What they found they needed, what feedback pushed for what to get stressed.  If it has bad art and music, that is worse than no art and music. I can turn off music and put in my own (which unfortunately can remove impact in emotional scenes if Caramelldansen comes on as the heroine describes her awful past). But I can't turn off the art. Write a book, if you feel as if you have no shot of outsourcing or getting better at art and music production, or bringing another talent onto your ""team""."
visualnovels,3czfki,RavenscroftRaven,6,Tue Jul 14 03:56:17 2015 UTC,"Bad music would be a deal breaker to me, but bad graphics aren't that much of a problem if the text and ambience are good enough.  For example: Tsukihime can be considered ugly nowadays, but the music was ok - minimal and non-intrusive, and the scenery / character drawings were good enough to complement the meat of the game, which was it's story. Killer Queen, on the other hand, isn't simply ugly: the images - be it characters or scenery - pretty much contradict the text, making for something that would be better as a light novel (pure text) than the resulting game (also, the voice acting was ~meh~ at best on that one).  tl;dr: if the story is good enough, and the music isn't too distracting (even if it is lackluster), then the art doesn't have to be stellar, as long as it serves a purpose and doesn't downright contradict the text."
visualnovels,3czfki,RLFMS,3,Sun Jul 12 05:53:46 2015 UTC,"Story is the most important part but a great VN is distinguished and enhanced by the atmosphere created by the art/music.  Edit: To answer the question, I would probably be dissuaded to try a VN with bad art/music. It's like reading a story and the writing style is terrible but the content is good."
visualnovels,3czfki,TimmyThyme,3,Sun Jul 12 05:39:11 2015 UTC,"It would have to be a damn good story. If the story is just ""relatively"" good, I'm not sure it could cover for low production values.    Sorry. Visual novels are a tough medium; there's a ton of things that all need to be done well!"

Music isn't too big of a deal, and I'm usually entertained quite easily, so stories are also not that important for me. The most important thing a VN needs to have is good art (I dropped Rewrite after 1 hour because of the art).  I do consider interesting characters to be a good plus to a VN though. Even if the story itself is lacking, good characters outrank story in my enjoyment of the game."

visualnovels,3czfki,Crooodle,2,Sun Jul 12 09:16:56 2015 UTC,"Art, music, user interface, and sound effects are not all that important. What matters most is the story. Do I care about the characters? Is the plot compelling? Is the world interesting?   I say this as a person has enjoyed a number of freeware and inexpensive video games. If you release your story for free, or designate it as pay-what-you-want, then I will be more inclined to give your visual novel a chance. If you release it as an inexpensive indie game, I'll think a bit before purchasing it. For example, the people at Moacube currently sell their story Cinders for $20 US. That's not much... but since I don't especially like the aesthetic, I haven't purchased it.  I also say this as a person who still remembers the limitations of 8-bit consoles, as well as the awkward transition to 3D polygon art. If you use a distinct or offbeat art style -- such as imitating the original Gameboy's four shades of gray and small sprites -- then I'll be more inclined to try your VN."

There's various Manga I held off on reading because of the art, but when I did because of the constant praise I regretted putting off reading it so long. But I do consider reading a VN to be a bigger investment than reading a Manga, so I'd be more reluctant even if it was getting good reviews and opinions.  If a developer was in such a situation, I'd honestly prefer if they just changed the art style (Eg, everything being like a rough sketch, silhouettes for character sprites or some minimalistic style) or just used filter photos of people. At least like this the art would be detracting from their work as much. As for music, there does exist good royalty free stuff, though it may be hard to find all the tracks necessary (Suitable/fitting VNs themes/scenes/feel etc and have a licence permitting commercial use) and have them all fit together (Same genre/instruments/feel).  On the other hand, does it even need to be a VN? Could it be delivered in other formats, for example and audio drama (As you didn't mention the quality of the VAing, I assume you meant it was decent), or just a written story perhaps with the ""choose your own adventure""-style formatting. A well written novel would do better then a VN that is lacking in key areas."

Apparently ""visual"" is just as important as ""novel"" for me. Maybe later I'll have that emotional attachment to this particular developer that'd help me overcome those problems, but right now I don't feel like sacrificing aesthetics.  Music? As long as I can tell when one track stopped playing and another started, it should be good - a bit of diversity is also welcome.

I don't think I'd be okay with bad art, since ""Visual"" is half of the name of the genre. It should focus on both the presentation, and the text. If one side is no good, I'm afraid it wouldn't be holding up to the genre."
visualnovels,3czfki,BintonGaming,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:51:26 2015 UTC,"I don't really care about art in VNs. As long as everything somehow blends together and creates an coherent art style, It can be practically as 'bad' as it wants to be - it just shouldn't be an absolute eyesore. I also often like experimental art styles, outdated 8bit/16bit graphic styles etc. more than the typical VN anime art style, so there's that.  As for music, that's a tough question. Correctly used, it can be at times more important than the actual story. Badly used, it can kill the whole atmosphere and make reading the VN unbearable. Muting the music would help in the latter case, but then I would constantly think I miss out on something, so that's not a really feasible option for me either. If the VN doesn't feature any music at all, that's another thing and it can be quite good at times, but it really gets noticeable when the VN is longer than just a few hours. So, I would go with ""It depends"". I value music in VNs and games very highly, so a bad soundtrack is usually a dealbreaker for me and a good soundtrack can be the saving grace, but it's not always that simple. I don't know."
visualnovels,3czfki,8cccc9,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:03:54 2015 UTC,"If the art is bad/extremely dated, I probably won't want to read it no matter how good the story may be. Music is less of a deciding factor, but it would be much preferred if it was, at the very least, half-decent.   Visual novels are not just novels. There's that whole ""visual"" part to consider as well. If only the story is good then that's like, losing half of what makes a VN, a VN."

visualnovels,3czfki,prologio,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:56:43 2015 UTC,"Yes. I could enjoy a good VN that has lousy art, as you can tell from my flair (Symphonic Rain has excellent music though).   I like looking at nice art, but story and characters are more important to me. I think it's possible for the art to grow on you, too. When I first saw screenshots of YU-NO a year or so ago I don't think I liked the art very much, but when I actually played the VN I started thinking it was really pretty. If you grow attached to a character then you might start to like the way they are drawn. I even grew a little fond of the art in Symphonic Rain. The fact everyone was drawn to look cutesy and childish had an interesting side effect: spoiler.   I mean, if people can't get past bad art, I'm not sure how they make it through Key games...  All that being said, the reverse is true too. If a VN has beautiful art I might be compelled to play it even if the story is nothing special (if the story is actively terrible, then probably not). I think the coloring in Sprite's games is really nice-looking, for example, so I might play Koichoco even though it looks like a standard school-life romance game."

Also, in my opinion everything must be as polished as possible else i don't see how you can expect anyone to be satisfied with your creation if you're not satisfied with it yourself. Can't compose? — try getting a composer, can't draw? — find an artist. There are lots of beginners who would gladly contribute for a laughable fee if not free at all.

I'd much rather have 5 really good soundtracks than 10 mediocre soundtracks. I'd read a VN with edited photographs as backgrounds, but I'd be less willing to compromise on character designs (though I 'd be willing to compromise somewhat on how well the characters are drawn)  In the end, the best thing you can do is limit scope. The less characters you have, the less you have to draw, for example. If you're planning on making a low-budget VN I'd suggest you take a look at something like Tsukihime, which is by no means gorgeous and is still a very popular (and very good!) VN."

Tokyo Ghoul manga got this down pat even though the anime kind of made everyone a retard.  I honestly think half the reason everyone loves Kurisu so much, besides her being awesome, is she's the straight man friend/romantic interest. Without Kurisu everyone that holds a supporting role in Steins;Gate would have no one to bounce their quirky personalities off of and they would be reduced to Hentai jokes, tutturu, nyaa, e-e-e-eto, ...-click type click-. They're not only held in check but forced to exhibit a more serious side to themselves when Kurisu presses them, and I think that's really healthy for the plot and for the characterization of each character. I would consider Okabe to be a straight man later in the plot too."

It just makes you care so much more about those characters, you feel a connection with them, like they're really making the MC better.  Okabe does it with Kurisu, Battler does it with Beatrice and Virgilia. To me it just is essential to making you really care about a character in a way that makes them feel like a friend."

visualnovels,3cwjwg,ctom42,19,Sun Jul 12 07:52:48 2015 UTC,"One area I think VNs tend to do poorly in that anime do better is having a large and varied cast. A lot of VNs simply use the MC + 3-5 heroines and a male friend or two formula. The heroines are often a pretty predictable mix of tropes, and overall it lacks real variety (even when individual characters are quite good).  Majikoi, the Ace Attorney Series, and any work by Ryukishi07 all do a great job of having large and varied casts of memorable and well constructed characters. At the end of the day a great cast is more important than having one or two really standout characters."
visualnovels,3cwjwg,Cornetto_Man,5,Sun Jul 12 16:57:17 2015 UTC,OverDrive titles are also usually good for their casts. Especially the side character. In some cases I found the side characters more interesting than the MC and the heroines (like in Edelweiss and Dengeki Stryker).

visualnovels,3cwjwg,OavatosDK,9,Sat Jul 11 11:45:58 2015 UTC,"I disagree.   First of all, ""annoying"" in most cases is not a character's trait, it's a result of some particular trait(s) not going well with you personally - basically, it's like saying you like things you like without actually stating what you like.   Secondly, because of the very same reason you will find out that you can't apply the term because of how vague it is. Since ""annoying"" is some other unnamed trait, those who are perfectly fine with that unnamed trait would naturally disagree with you.  Ultimately, character never being annoying means the said character has no flaws, which belongs more in the realm of wish fulfilment than realistic portrayal of a human being. I personally found Sharin no Kuni's characters to be very interesting precisely because their take on things was often ignoring the unpleasant issues, quite biased and not ""optimal""."
visualnovels,3cwjwg,FinalNwo,7,Sat Jul 11 12:35:05 2015 UTC,"You're taking annoying too literally. Traits that are labelled annoying situationally/in a vacuum are different than a character just being a pain to read. To use an example from Little Busters, Haruka is definitely the ""annoying"" character by character design and how she acts, but Komari is annoying to the reader by being the one who is grating to read (and what I meant by being annoying). So it is fundamentally subjective, but it is important nonetheless."

She is always there to watch the mc's back from any threat and I thought her and Kou make a great pairing too.  Amamiya Yuuko from Ef - always the mysterious character that gives out good advise to other people. I always liked characters like her.  Kashi Harutsuge from asairo - The ane-go who likes to troll everyone. Always says something hilarious and at the same time gives from serious advice to other characters.  Shizuki Soujuurou from mahoyo - Such an innocent character who can ""rationalize"" anything. Also has a unique relationship with Aoko and Alice that's not always pleasant at times.  Naoe Yamato from majikoi - He is such a fun character to follow for all the ridiculous things he thinks up.  Nonosaki Akiho from moshiraba - literally the wife of the mc before she died and came back as a ghost (not spoilers if you are wondering). Even though she is a ghost, she refuses to disappear from the lives of the main cast and gives the normalcy they had before she died.   Chitose Shuusuke from oretsuba - Always manages to screw something up and does it in the most hilarious way possible. Good thing he has Tamaizumi to keep him in line.  Wakutsu Tomo from Ruitomo - Probably my top favorite character in VNs. It's hard to describe how awesome he is without listing a hundred different things about him but he is definitely in my top 3 favorite characters in VNs.  Minato Kageaki from Muramasa - Hard to imagine the VN being good as it is without having Kageaki as the MC. I still have no idea how he stays sane after all he has done and seen but it was a pure joy to follow him from beginning to end.  Amakasu Masahiko from Senshinkan series - The most memorable villain from VNs I finished. From the bombastic speeches he makes to his ""attraction"" to the mc, he made the VN so much more enjoyable and memorable. The relationship he has with other villains were fun to watch too.  Otonashi Ayana from subahibi - Practically steals the show by showing up at weird times and says the most cryptic things to everyone.   Ookura Aeon from tsuriotsu - One of the more unique villain characters I've seen. Even though he is a normal human being, he makes everyone fear for their lives every time he shows up. The fact that he kept the mc as his ""pet"" for many years and is the reason for the mc to cross-dress to go to an all-girl's school says something about him."

Kengo Miyazawa from Little Busters!- I feel like Kengo's actions throughout Little Busters! are probably the same ones I would take. Kengo's entire attitude also reflects mine greatly. Essentially, I relate to him a lot.  Houzuki Masaomi - As a villain, he's perfect. Everything he does feels like it has some sort of meaning to it. He's really intimidating and scary, but at the same time I still had some level of respect towards him. I also like him a lot more after reading his backstory in Yuukyuu  Morooka Takuya - I like him for the sole reason that he's pretty much me. The way his mind works is just so relatable. His mind very rapidly switched from topic to topic, and he's constantly thinking about his own surroundings. What people around him are like, and what they're thinking. He also knows a lot about himself, about all his strengths, and his weaknesses. He keeps this all to himself, and ends up coming to a conclusion based on these thought.   What type of characters need to be used more?   I've only read the Common Route of Rewrite, but I think we need more childhood friends like Kotori. Kotori to me actually feels as if she's a childhood friend, rather than just being given that characteristic as an afterthought. She gets along really well with Kotarou, they have lot of inside jokes, and I could really feel how far back their friendship went, through their interactions. I really want more of that in my characters."

visualnovels,3ct9tt,riruru,15,Fri Jul 10 16:24:03 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be honest here - the character designs don't even really look ""different"" to me. They're just separated from each other by twenty years. To put it another way, if you remake YU-NO in 2015, this is pretty much what it's going to look like. The artist, Nagi Ryou (probably most well-known for Ar tonelico), hit all of the key points of the designs and the art itself is technically competent, so there's nothing for me to complain about.  But I guess I'm in the minority here... the 3DS remake of Toushin Toshi II changed that game's designs way more heavily than anything in the YU-NO remake, but I don't really have a problem with any of the new designs in that game either. I guess I just don't have any real attachment to old 90s designs in general.  I'm more worried about the new castings; the Saturn version of YU-NO has some of the best voice acting I've ever heard and I really don't think there's any way the new version can live up to it. I don't think any of the new castings are bad, per se, but there's just no way they can match the original. In particular, I'm kind of upset about Ryuuzouji being recast - Ohtsuka Akio's performance as him in the Saturn version of YU-NO is among the best voice acting I've ever heard (especially the climax of the game, holy shit) and even though I understand they pretty much had to recast everyone and record new voices it's disappointing they didn't at least get him to return. Or Hiyama as Takuya, for that matter.  Also on the sound front - the music is being redone by Yonao Keishi, and I have total faith in him to produce something excellent, but it's going to be very hard to live up to the PC-98 originals. Umemoto's soundtrack is one of the biggest factors in creating YU-NO's unique atmosphere, so I really hope Yonao can recapture the sort of ethereal feeling it has."

I don't know why they changed Kanna's hair and gave her that weird vacant expression.  Yuu Kobayashi voicing Eriko sounds potentially cool."

If anything, this makes me more excited to replay the game (should the remake be translated of course). I reckon the game will feel very different overall because of the art, but still have the same plot(?). Plus I'm guessing the systems in the game won't be the exact same either as the original, but we'll see. You'd think they'd tweak it in some way.  Really at this point I just want to see ingame screenshots though."

I don't think they look bad at all, but that doesn't mean they couldn't look a little more similar or memorable, so yeah I get your point.  I haven't played the original though, so this remake will probably be amazing first experience for someone like me. That is to say, if it gets an English translation."
visualnovels,3ct9tt,mbac1,2,Fri Jul 10 20:55:00 2015 UTC,"I agree, the new designs are just generic animu versions of the original designs. They lack the personality that the originals had; to me, they feel extremely muted and unremarkable.  Furthermore, they all look the same age.  I mean, Ayumi was 29 or so in the game, but she looks 12 here.  I hope the remake will bring more new things to the table because this isn't really cutting it."

I have only seen two things so far this season since I am watching most things with someone and they have been busy.  Gakkou Gurashi  this first episode was amazing, I am really excited to keep watching this one.  Monster Mosume first episode also didn't disappoint.  Was almost scene by scene for the manga and was done pretty damn well."

Yamada-kun was pretty good I thought. I ended up getting caught up with the manga after a few episodes. While there is more material for a second season the place season 1 leaves off would work as a great ending if no season 2 happens.   I absolutely loved Plastic Memories. Loved it. There were some odd tonal inconsistencies towards the start but post episode 5 I loved every minute. I could write an essay on why the final episode was fucking perfect."

visualnovels,3ctmac,RaIshtar,2,Fri Jul 10 19:02:03 2015 UTC,I can see why you'd think that. It wasn't really anything revolutionary or game-changing but I felt it did what it tried to do very well. The animation and direction was top notch too.

Overall, I was harsh with the show because it was riskless. Yeah, it was really well done, but it's like a really well done ham and cheese sandwich. In the end it's still going to be a ham and cheese sandwich. I would have liked something more."
visualnovels,3ctmac,RaIshtar,2,Fri Jul 10 19:12:05 2015 UTC,"I would have liked something more.   I kinda agree actually. I loved it anyway but it would have been perfect to me if they had have replaced those SoL comedy bits at the start with more serious segments, maybe explore the world more.

Other stuff I watch weekly are adaptions since I already know what is going to happen anyways.  As for last season, most things that I watched that are finished implied there would be another season, or wasn't very good."

That's how I am for most shows, but I'm watching Non Non Biyori this season since I really liked the first season and it's a SoL that I think works well weekly.   Edit: actually, I never marathon things, but my favorite schedule for any show is one episode a day.  Edit 2: I just started watching Shokugeki no Souma. I haven't watched a true Jump-style shonen in years, but I'm really enjoying it. Something about the complete lack of subtlety and the battle shonen approach to food makes it very fun."
visualnovels,3ctmac,figureour,3,Sat Jul 11 22:35:20 2015 UTC,I have far too many things to comment on all but based on 1 episode my favourites are:   Gakkou Gurashi was so good. That first episode got me good. Gangsta looks really promising. The first episode was great. Rokka no Yuusha kind came outta nowhere for me. That first episode was excellent. Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai was hilarious. It was everything I ever wanted and some things I didn't even realise I wanted. Himouto! Umaru-chan. Cute/10   On the other side the shittest shows of the season are:   Chaos Dragon. That first episode was laughably bad.  Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan had literally the most generic first episode I've ever seen. Even had cool collected MC-kun run into a tsundere with toast in her mouth who was late to school.
visualnovels,3ctmac,Cornetto_Man,2,Fri Jul 10 18:28:23 2015 UTC,What made Chaos Dragon so bad?  I have no idea about either of the shows you put on the shit show.  The second one looks super generic though.
visualnovels,3ctmac,Avebone,4,Fri Jul 10 18:42:35 2015 UTC,"Everything really. Terrible animation (it had a CGI Dragon on FSN levels of bad), a ton of characters introduced all at once on several different sides but no real explanation of the lore or world-building to separate them. A really silly ending. They also made a bunch of changes to the source like swapping character genders for no reason.  All around bad.   Edit: And yeah the second was generic in every way. I'll try to find a list of all the generic events from ep. 1 I saw somewhere.   Found it   Super nice generic and coolheaded personality-less protagonist  Protagonist bumps into heroine while she's holding a toast in her mouth  Heroine is a tsundere  Protagonist ends up groping heroine's breasts  Moves on to encounter second main heroine  Gets mistaken as a pervert  Proceeds to encounter third heroine because he somehow ended up in the girl's bathroom.  Gets mistaken as a pervert for the 3rd time  Protagonist ends up in charge of all the 3 girls he previously met"
visualnovels,3ctmac,Cornetto_Man,2,Fri Jul 10 18:48:10 2015 UTC,Wow... those descriptions both sound really bad haha.  Not that there is really anything wrong with being generic just kinda boring.
visualnovels,3ctmac,Avebone,3,Fri Jul 10 18:58:24 2015 UTC,I generally like generic harem shows so I'll stick with the second one for a few episodes to see where it goes. Chaos on the other hand I can see myself dropping by episode 3.

visualnovels,3ctmac,Avebone,2,Fri Jul 10 19:10:02 2015 UTC,I very rarely drop things too since I have a pretty good grasp on what I like and dislike now. Only things like Denpa Kyoushi last season which was just poorly made are the things I drop now.
visualnovels,3ctmac,Cornetto_Man,3,Fri Jul 10 19:21:06 2015 UTC,"Chaos Dragon is just a massive mess. It's based off of a D&D Style roleplaying game called Red Dragon, but the characters are literally based on the actual roleplaying sessions of Urobuchi, Nasu, Narita (Durarara!!, Baccano!) and two other guys.

If one isn't watching it why even watch airing anime? This season is pretty bad, almost every new show is varying shades of bad to watchable (and almost no ""wow this is good"" shows).  Top Tier (only must watch shows airing and they're all sequels): NNB, Gatchaman, Teekyu  Will Probably Survive 12 Weeks Tier: Gangsta, Prison School, Rokka no Yuusha, Ushio and Tora  Might Survive 12 Weeks Tier: Monster Musume, Charlotte  Lucky To Make Me Commit For 2 More Weeks Tier:  Classroom Crisis, Gakkou Gurashi, Gate"

Gangsta - Enjoying it so far. I'm in love with the op & Worick & Nic are cool guys. I would love to see more background information. Classroom Crisis - I got bored. Every so often, I'd move my mouse around to see how much time was left. Rokka no Yuusha - Not bad. The fight scene was well choreographed & the main protagonist has a nice personality. Shinometa - I laughed like once or twice. It may have even been out of pity. I'll continue watching it to see if it gets any better for me.  Charlotte - I'm definitely staying just to see how they handle the main character. The guy is asshole incarnate and I'm really curious as to how they're going to handle his character. Overlord - Lots of people say it was disappointing, but Overlord's first episode was probably the one I enjoyed the most. I liked the main protagonist's monologues and the overall feel of the story. Also, Albedo - best girl. Jitsu wa Watashi wa - The coloring is really bright. I thought the episode was pretty good. The main protagonist had good reactions and the main heroine's voice is growing on me. Hopefully, we get more great reactions out of characters other than the main character. Kuusen Madoushi - The main character didn't blush a single time, so I'm taking the bait."

Chaos Dragon : Overload of tropes and teenagers against the world made me click the red cross in a matter of minutes. Will see what people think of it, but doesn't look like my kind of show. Even with that staff.  Charlotte : Gonna watch anyway because Jun ""Based God"" Maeda wrote that, but I liked the first episode a lot. Definitely caught my eye.  Classroom Crisis : Meh. Will see, but I'm not really hyped about that one.  Durarara : It's Durarara. Can't go wrong.  Gekkou Gurashi : The first episode was awesome. Definitely watching that, excellent.  Gangsta : Aaaaah, the smell of originality. Would watch just cause it's damn unusual in many ways.  GATE : If it gets less boring... No, even then it'd likely be otaku pandering.  Himouto!

Charlotte had a pretty great first episode and left me wanting more. Prison school was pretty disappointing with its weird art style, shitty VA casting, and poor comedic timing. It can't live up to the fantastic manga. Himouto was also disappointing - it wasn't as cute of funny as I had hope and honestly the girl pisses me off. Ushio to Tora is my surprise of the season. Pretty great stuff so far. MAPPA is doing a great job with the visuals. Jitsu wa Watashi wa is nothing special so far but I'll stick around to see why the manga has such a dedicated following. Chaos Dragon was alright but hasn't really kicked off yet. I'm looking forward to Urobuchi edge and Nasu asspulls. Overlord was okay but I don't have very high expectations. I think people are overrating it. Gangsta wasn't at all my cup of tea and the first episode will probably also be my last - although I can understand the appeal.

I haven't gotten too far yet, but I'd be lying if I said I loved all the character names. I mean 'Maude'? Really? The lesbian couple of Sue and... 'Maude'.  Anyways, books I've finished:   Jingo by Terry Pratchett. While it was probably one of the better books in the series, I think I'm going to make it my stopping place for now. I'm a bit Discworld-ed out. 4/5 War of the Twins and Test of the Twins by Weis & Hickman. They were definitely both better than the first book in the series, Time of the Twins, which could be really inconsistent in quality at times, and they wrapped the trilogy up nicely. Other than that, there's not much too say about them unless you've already read the Dragonlance Chronicles. 4/5 Joyland by Stephen King. Definitely not one of King's best novels and definitely not anything it claims to be (Crime, Suspense, anything that's not 'Mediocre Coming of Age novel'). So yeah, it felt like King decided that he wanted to write a book that touched on the carny lifestyle, sat down at his computer, and then phoned it in. 3/5 (generous rating)"

I'm enjoying it to an extant. The world is big and the lore is interesting but it feels a bit impersonal.  I'm used to VNs and books like Kingkiller Chronicles and The Dresden Files where it's all told in first person. In a way, going back to third person makes me feel very disconnected from the story and stops me getting fully immersed in the world.  Ah well, maybe it'll grow on me."

(I'll admit it outright, I got interested into it after watching Mawaru Penguindrum). But it's obviously not representative of his fiction works.  Out of those I've read so far, I liked Norwegian Wood the most - a lot of Murakami books seem to have the same central themes and types of characters, and Norvegian Wood is the one I've found to express them the best. With that said, Murakami reads very ""easily"" (simple yet compelling text), so you could read any other pretty easily and pretty fast to see what they're about.  The most interesting one, however, was probably Kafka on the Shore.   Btw I've read those translated in french (although I've starded reading Dance Dance Dance in japanese recently) so I can't vouch for the english translation or the japanese prose."

Thankfully the first variety are whats in favor right now and they generally offer a satisfying spectator and gameplay experience.

The number of Umineko comments is well above any other VN (I also expect they're considerably longer on average too).   I'm just not sure how widely read it is among the larger lurker userbase here (that would still vote in the contest), as the last survey asking about which VNs people had read (see here), had Umineko down in 21st place. It's quite an old survey though, nearly a whole year."

Honestly, I don't get how both on here and /r/anime Stein's Gate seems to plough through every contest. I mean I get it, it's good, great even, and is very popular at the moment.  But I don't really think the main couple of the whole VN is that incredible. As far as I can see, Stein's Gate is a VN there almost 100% for the story and characters, so to suggest a romantic couple originating from it can be better than better-developed ones from VNs which focus on the whole deal is plain silly.  I'm not trying to discredit the contest as a whole, or other people's opinions, it's just I don't see where this victory really came from. This probably sounds really butthurt, and to be honest it is."
visualnovels,3cq3iv,Rathilal,45,Thu Jul 9 21:52:39 2015 UTC,"Actually it's exactly because the VN did not focus on the Romance that the couple is so well liked. Most romance focused VNs come across as pretty forced, where you just arbitrarily start dating one of the girls because it's their route. In S;G Kurisu and Okabe were working together throughout the entire novel and slowly come to realize their feelings for each other. It's not the sudden forced relationship, nor is it the non-relationship romantic tension till the end. I would not put it as my all time favorite couple, but it's my #3, and possibly my #1 in anime."
visualnovels,3cq3iv,ctom42,17,Thu Jul 9 22:37:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly this.  Even among romance-focused works that I actually enjoy, I usually find that the relationships themselves lack any kind of chemistry, and just kind of happen because the people involved are main characters.  In Steins;Gate, the relationship they have evolves naturally throughout the VN and is actually platonic through most of the story.  It's also a great example of how you absolutely do not have to have H-Scenes to have a good romance."
visualnovels,3cq3iv,ScarsUnseen,13,Thu Jul 9 23:27:19 2015 UTC,"I personally don't consider this an upset, but you have to remember one thing when you see contests like this. This is a popularity contest."
visualnovels,3cq3iv,pik3rob,12,Thu Jul 9 22:04:36 2015 UTC,"Chemistry my friend, chemistry.   But yeah regardless it's my favorite couple by far and only Battler and Beato comes close to it. A story doesn't need to focus on the romance as it's one selling point for it to be good, or even the best. Perhaps like me, people like it the most because the feelings for the two characters weren't jammed down your throat."
visualnovels,3cq3iv,hyperknees91,12,Thu Jul 9 22:01:02 2015 UTC,"To be fair, this is actually Steins;Gate first actual legit win in a contest on this board.

visualnovels,3cq3iv,superange128,11,Fri Jul 10 00:36:53 2015 UTC,"Steins;Gate may not be ""a romance VN"", but Okabe and Kurisu's relationship is absolutely central to the story. Their chemistry really carries the game, both in the first half when they're snarking at each other in the lab, and in the second half when Kurisu is Okabe's lifeline. She's always there for him, always quick to understand and talk him down from bad decisions. She keeps him sane. And then there's the true ending, where spoiler If that's not love, I don't know what is."

visualnovels,3cr0g7,KageYume,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:45:44 2015 UTC,Yup. Although I'd say the title inherently fits this novel a bit more than Kiminozo. I can understand why they used Rumbling Hearts for english anime releases.

visualnovels,3coxrh,dovac,2,Thu Jul 9 18:55:58 2015 UTC,In what way? Is it about the whole exporting erotic material out of Japan or what?
visualnovels,3coxrh,Soveriegn,5,Thu Jul 9 19:19:55 2015 UTC,"Related to their rights, IP, trademark stuff."
visualnovels,3coxrh,dovac,34,Fri Jul 10 03:21:33 2015 UTC,People have tried to license TM stuff. Even recently. The problem is they want way more money than anyone can afford. You might have an extremely small chance if you could somehow convince them a Kickstarter would get a fuckload of money.
visualnovels,3coxrh,herkz,6,Thu Jul 9 16:56:06 2015 UTC,"How much is a fuckload?  Pretty sure if they timed it right and had the right backer goals, they would definitely beat out the half million USD CLANNAD got."
visualnovels,3coxrh,demeteloaf,16,Thu Jul 9 18:32:31 2015 UTC,"You do realize only half of the original $140k goal for Clannad was necessary for paying for the license, right? So $70k.  If Typemoon was asking for way too much to afford licensing it, it must've been around $500k or more. Besides, asking for a shitload of money is basically a polite way of saying ""We aren't interested in releasing stuff overseas."" At least I hope they don't think it's worth that much..."
visualnovels,3coxrh,herkz,5,Thu Jul 9 18:47:29 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm not saying it's worth that much, and I pretty much agree with you that Type Moon simply just doesn't want to license stuff overseas.

visualnovels,3coxrh,figureour,7,Fri Jul 10 03:07:45 2015 UTC,"Not to be an asshole, but I suggest learning Japanese if you're this passionate about reading VNs. It's gonna take a while and what not, but diligent study would mean that you'll probably be ready to read it by the time it comes out in X years.  Tsuki-Re is probably going to be popular enough to have a group work on the translations eventually (probably somebody from Beast Lair) - Though who knows how many years you'll have to wait (not to mention translation inaccuracy and other pesky things to deal with)."
visualnovels,3coxrh,HeroEMIYA,3,Thu Jul 9 20:15:29 2015 UTC,"I don't really think or see how anyone could think of your statement as being ""asshole-ish"". There is a certain aspect of facing reality that if one wants to read Tsukire, then you're either going to have to wait many years, never read it because the translation doesn't come out or learn Japanese. Arguments about whether or not it should or shouldn't be this way isn't very constructive unfortunately, it's on MG, Sekai or whoever's end to reach out and for the Japanese companies to comply and if they don't comply now, they might in the future when the market gets recognized. The holding your breath and praying for a TL is pretty optimistic but unlikely I think."
visualnovels,3coxrh,Spideyday,4,Thu Jul 9 21:25:26 2015 UTC,"Some people I've interacted have flat out been offended when they're told to learn Japanese for the sake of reading a few things. It's a lot of work that not everyone has the time, patience or perseverance for - But saying that doesn't really deal with this problem, like you say.  This is just the 'real-advice' I wanted to give OP and the other people here. Maybe somebody'll translate it or at least post summaries of it. Though based on TM's lack of official VN releases & what you mentioned, I'm also skeptical about the likelihood of it happening."
visualnovels,3coxrh,HeroEMIYA,3,Thu Jul 9 23:05:07 2015 UTC,"Learning Japanese is indeed one of my long term goals, but not now in the next few years (especially considering that I'm in college and I want to start to work on a few mobile games). I simply don't have time.  If it was German or other european language, it would be fine, but having to learn a new alphabet (learning Kanji will be especially fun...), gramatical rules, and god knows what else...

I simply don't have the patience or time for it.   Yes, Germanic and Romance languages aren't generally as difficult for a native English speaker (which I'm assuming you are) as a character-based language is, but learning any language requires a lot of effort and endurance. I don't think the difference is as extreme as you think."

Meanwhile Japanese and other asian languages are not so easy, because I would also need to learn new characters, gramatical rules, etc..."
visualnovels,3coxrh,figureour,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:23:00 2015 UTC,"Oh okay. I guess you would know a lot more about this than I do since I'm a monolingual English speaker (though slowly learning Japanese), but if you do plan on learning Japanese at some point, it be might be a good idea to at least learn the kana and some grammar and vocab now, even if you just do a tiny bit each day. By the time you graduate, and that info is completely hardwired in your brain, I think things like learning kanji and more advanced grammar won't feel as daunting.  Just curious, how long did it take you to learn Spanish and Italian?"
visualnovels,3coxrh,TuanT1935,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:36:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thanks for the tip. I might do that.  Answer: Hmm, how should I put this... I guess you could consider portuguese as a ""cheat"" language. In other words, if you know portuguese, you practically know italian and spanish. Portuguese, italian and spanish are somewhat similar, so I can perfectly understand what they say, even though I have problems speaking. (I did study spanish one year, for some stupid reason that I don't remember)  The true english teacher I had were the videogames (especially RPG's), hopefully the animes and visual novels might have the same effect and help me out a bit. (and it's somehow working, sometimes I think I know what the characters are saying without reading the subtitles)  I also studied french for 2 years, but sadly I didn't see why I would need french at the time and didn't practice it for years. Now I can't understand it. I kinda regret it."
visualnovels,3coxrh,reynaden,2,Sat Jul 11 21:36:01 2015 UTC,"Cool. It's interesting how that you naturally understand neighboring languages so well.  Just one bit of warning though about learning Japanese through games: I saw someone on /r/LearnJapanese who was frustrated because they learned English through American comics without much trouble but was having a really rough time trying to learn Japanese through manga. I get the impression that picking up complicated syntax and kanji through native texts can be useful, but that diving in without formally learning at least a semester or two's worth (whether self-taught or in a class) isn't worth it."
visualnovels,3coxrh,The_Dran,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:01:28 2015 UTC,Not sure abt the remake but original tsukihime is intermediate Japanese.
visualnovels,3coxrh,reynaden,2,Fri Jul 10 06:18:58 2015 UTC,"With that last part, if there are routes you could sell them separately. I mean, realta nua split fate stay into 3 distinct routes I think, sell each for $30 and its doable."
visualnovels,3coxrh,The_Dran,5,Thu Jul 9 18:50:30 2015 UTC,"I think you'd have a hard sell in the west to convince people to pay $30 for a single route of a VN. If you did that, you'd never sell enough copies to make it worth releasing in the first place."
visualnovels,3coxrh,figureour,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:17:52 2015 UTC,"Thats true, the only reason I even thought about it is since fate stay is 3 .exes now. Because of that it isn't impossible to imagine them trying to sell the individual routes in a imagined western release instead of a $70 price tag."
visualnovels,3coxrh,The_Dran,3,Fri Jul 10 00:47:17 2015 UTC,"Conceivable. With Tsukihime it might make more sense to split it into two sets of routes - near side routes and far side ones - rather than individual routes. That's because the routes are thematically linked to the other routes in the same set, but not quite so with the routes in the opposing set.  I still think it would be a terrible idea to sell the two half seperately, though. It would definitely be recieved negatively - if only for the perception that TM (or whomever would be responsible for this hypothetical localization) were trying to nickel-and-dime their fans into paying twice for the same game."
visualnovels,3coxrh,figureour,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:45:27 2015 UTC,"I haven't read F/SN in any form, but isn't the game pretty huge? Doesn't each route contain like 30+ hours of content?"

visualnovels,3coxrh,figureour,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:16:40 2015 UTC,"Well, there's definitely content to justify the price, but I still feel it'd be a bad idea. It'd give the impression that we're being asked to pay for the same game multiple times.  And even though Réalta Nua split the game into three different games, you're still recommended to read it in the original order of Fate ➡ Unlimited Blade Works ➡ Heaven's Feel. The original game forced you to read the routes in that order for a reason. But Réalta Nua (and reynaden's idea to sell them individually) allowed you to technically play whatever order you wanted.  That's probably not something that people unfamiliar with the VN would know, so how do you convey the correct order and that UBW and HF are, for all intents and purposes, sequels?"
visualnovels,3coxrh,AllisOneandOneisAll,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:08:16 2015 UTC,"I mean, some westerners seem to ""not get the point"" of the locked play order anyway, decide they want to skip fate and play UBW, download a save and then complain about it being disappointing. So nothing really works, but I agree.  Also I personally think that Fate isn't really worthwhile on its own so it would be a bad idea to seperate the routes like that. But that may be because I watched the anime first. (Unfortunately......)"

visualnovels,3coxrh,messem10,3,Sat Jul 11 19:28:16 2015 UTC,"I think we'd have a better chance of convincing them to get Fate over. Much as I want the Tsukihime remake, there's almost no presence over here in comparison.   That being said, it'd still be hard to convince them to make a kickstarter as a collection of fans. A group like Sekai or MG maybe could convince them in time to make a joint-kickstarter (assuming they continue to get the titles that developers have been reluctant about releasing here)"
visualnovels,3coxrh,herkz,10,Thu Jul 9 17:08:07 2015 UTC,SP and MG have tried and they said no.

visualnovels,3coxrh,herkz,2,Thu Jul 9 20:18:58 2015 UTC,Maybe because they have no porn? Some companies care a lot about that.
visualnovels,3coxrh,figureour,6,Thu Jul 9 20:32:06 2015 UTC,Neither does the Realta Nua version of F/SN.
visualnovels,3coxrh,Anime2Deep4U,2,Thu Jul 9 20:42:47 2015 UTC,"But a porn version does exist, and people are well aware of it. Lots of eroge devs like to pretend they have this ""pure"" image and they only release all-ages titles. At least to the west/outsiders."
visualnovels,3coxrh,AllisOneandOneisAll,5,Thu Jul 9 20:55:24 2015 UTC,I get the impression that Nasu in particular is ashamed of the ero origins of his games.

But Type-Moon knows they're hot shit and they charge like it. And no one's willing to pay what they're asking and they're unwilling to back down on the price.  Any petition would have to have more signatures than most of the high profile VN crowdfunding projects (Grisaia, Clannad, Muv-Luv, etc.) combined.

I know they ramped up Sachi's 'I will do literally anything' tendecies in the common route for comedy, but then it just becomes weird when this character trait which was only ever used for over the top comedy in the common route   Instead of being a cute and tragic heroine I actually just thought Sachi was a bully, given her teasing of Michiru is so constant in the common route, and I often thought it was too mean-spirited to be funny."

I know it's more of the fact that the author basically likes to make fun of Michiru as much as possible but I feel like Sachi being mean to her was somewhat contradictory with the rest of her character (which was consistent otherwise)  I guess you can use the argument that since Michiru is the one that puts the highest amounts of requests or tends to treat her the worst, Sachi sometimes has a passive agressive attitude she either isn't aware of or just has trouble controlling when Michiru acts really dumb."

Every other line of his I thought, ""Wow, what an idiot,"" or ""Oh my god, he's such a twat."" He has the usual terrible ideas of sex and gender roles that plague so many Japanese works, causing him to say and think outright infuriating things, made even worse by his White Knight/Hero complex. And then we're expected to believe that he's actually a super badass and that he can go toe to toe with the Servants.  Saber is just boring. There's not much else I can say about her, nor do I think I have to.  Tohsaka is either boring or annoying depending on whether or not she's in tsundere mode. Her entire relationship with Shirou is laughable.  Archer is a jackass and an idiot. UBW And yet people think he's so badass to the point that he spawned the ""gar"" meme.  Gilgamesh and Kirei are just jackasses. How these two are some of the most popular characters I'll never know.  Sakura is practically non-existant in the first two routes, and then Heaven's Feel is just one scene after the other of forcing us to feel sorry for her.  Ilya is just fucking weird. I don't know how they expect us to see all of the terrible Dead Ends she can put Shirou through and then buy that she's really just an innocent girl who wants to love Shirou.  Most every character in Fate/stay night felt like a cut-and-paste character archetype which all in all made for a dull at best, infuriating at worst read.

visualnovels,3cop12,ctom42,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:47:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not really a fan of Sakaki from Grisaia. Most people seemed to like her and her relationship with Yuuji during her route, but I didn't really find it as great as others seem to. I didn't really develop any sort of fondness for her character during the game either."
visualnovels,3cop12,Avebone,5,Thu Jul 9 17:21:08 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised Yumiko's route is liked around these parts. I thought it was clearly the weakest, and when I played Grisaia that seemed to be the prevailing opinion at the time.  I think Yumiko's character did have potential. In Makina's route she serves as Yuuji's confidant. She's the only one who knows what's going on, and the two of them can talk on the same level. She seemed like a smart person, and I hoped to see more of that side of her. But she plays the role of the damsel in distress most of the time in her own route, which is a shame.   There's also the fact that she's much less funny than the other characters. It can be fun to watch the others mess with her, but she doesn't have many good lines herself."

Don't necessarily hate or anything, and some of them are interesting, but I just couldn't bring myself to care about the drama they faced.   I'm somewhat indifferent to Kagome in Comyu, but I still like her ok. I prefer Benio and Mayuki though where for most people she's the fave.   Amane from If my heart had wings kind of disappointed me. She was my favorite character (and is the fave on that list) but her route left me sour so I ended up liking Yoru, Asa and Ageha much more. She's still funny though. Yuuji and Kazuki from Grisaia kind of fall under this as well (but I blame Rakuen for that).   Minato from Muramasa is a bit on the eh side. I always find the conversations with him more boring then the ones with other characters. Most of the interesting aspects with him are internal but I basically liked most of the other characters more.   Haru from G-Senjou no Maou. She didn't really get much development until the very very end so that was kind of eh for a main heroine and disappointed me. She's also still pretty funny though.  That's all I can think of really. I don't hate any of the characters listed, but either I was disappointed by them in some way (because I liked them) or I just couldn't bring myself to care about their struggles.   For characters I really liked that no one else seems to based on your  list. Basically all the lowly rated Umineko characters, Monomi from DR2, Haru from Comyu, Payne from PW, and yeah I like Shinji from FSN ok too (believe it!)."
visualnovels,3cop12,JCAPER,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:27:23 2015 UTC,I am not sure I can properly explain why but I like Yuuji from Grisaia but hate Kenichi from Sharin no Kuni.  Those I know those two get compared a lot but Kenichi just isn't the same as Yuuji for me.  I think it has to do with the fact that I found Yuuji really engaging and funny while reading Grisaia and I can't say the same for Kenichi.
visualnovels,3cop12,Lishy1,4,Thu Jul 9 23:12:54 2015 UTC,"While they have similar roles and are quite overpowered in a way I'd say their personalities are pretty different.  Yuuji is quite a bit more quiet, detached, blunt and sarcastic while Kenichi is more outgoing but also quite a bit more goofy and more of an obvious tease. They both like to mess with the girls but Yuuji does it in a very blunt way while Kenichi does it in a way by talking himself up and a very troll-ish way.  At least to me it would make sense why someone would like one but not the other."

Episode five  Episode Five  Episode Five  Episode Five  Episode Five  Episode Five  On a related note, I've been watching the Umineko anime with some friends. So far it's been worth watching solely for that ED (somehow I managed to avoid hearing it until now). God, I love Kinzo. Seriously though, we all like it and are having a good time with it (despite its reputation), so that's nice.  And I suppose it also bears mentioning that I've been dabbling in the Ace Attorney Trilogy a bit.  Now, you gotta understand that I'm a huge Ace Attorney fanboy. I first got my hands on an Ace Attorney game in sixth grade, and I've been playing them pretty religiously ever since then. This must be like my sixth time through the first game. I just never get tired of these games, even if I know the cases inside and out. But I was against the Ace Attorney Trilogy at first. I thought the “upgraded” artwork would ruin the charm of the sprite art of the originals.  I was wrong. The new artwork looks great, as does the 3D (yes, I am one of the few people in the world who likes the 3DS's 3D gimmick). And the nonexistent loading times on Trilogy are really nice. But one thing I don't like is how they seemingly re-recorded Phoenix's “Objection”. It just sounds out of place to me.  Of course, seeing as I'm a bit busier now than I was in 6th grade and seeing that I'm actually reading other visual novels now (for years Ace Attorney was all I knew and all I had, until 999 and Danganronpa rolled around), I'm going through it at a snail's pace (I'm currently on case four of the first game after buying Trilogy nearly a month ago). But I'm enjoying it, as always. And I really hope Capcom senses me playing it and localizes Dai Gyakuten Saiban. Because god does that game look good."

It just sounds out of place to me   Apollo Justice and Dual Destinies have a different voice actor for Phoenix, and I'm pretty sure they used his Objection for the remake.

visualnovels,3cl9os,ConfuzzledKoala,8,Thu Jul 9 02:08:47 2015 UTC,"This week I played the entirety of Fault -Milestone One- at the recommendation of /u/Arcanus44, and it didn't let me down. I also made some more progress in If My Heart Had Wings, but more on that later. Sorry in advance for such a long post.  I loved Fault -Milestone One-. While it took a while for me to become accustomed to it (which I’m beginning to notice is common for me with VNs), I quickly became invested in the amazing and detailed world and characters of this VN. While it takes a while to adjust to the terminology of the game’s fantasy world, the in-game encyclopaedia is helpful and non-intrusive, though I would have liked it to update with more terms throughout the story. The game looks and sounds amazing, with fantastic graphics and an incredible OST (albeit one that sadly doesn’t loop very well during the game) that has one of the most creative renditions of ""Canon in D” I’ve ever heard.  The game’s story far exceeded my expectations. The game bills itself as being about a princess and her royal guard who are stranded on the other side of the planet after narrowly escaping a raid on the kingdom conducted by a malicious and unknown rebel group. While this is indeed the set-up, Milestone One’s story is more focussed on the history of the town they find themselves in, the rise and fall of the wealthy Zhevitz Enterprise corporation and a mysterious young girl calling herself “Rune” (…or is it “Sara”?) - and that’s what’s so fascinating about this story: the main characters are somewhat inconsequential in the long run, acting just as a vessel for the story to explore the side characters and their lives. There’s so much to this plot that experiencing it throughout the game creates a real sense of mystery and discovery, and compels you to continue playing.  The entire backstory of the Zhevitz organisation and family is gradually told to the player through flashbacks. More plot details - major spoilers!  Overall, astounding visuals, soundtrack, story, writing, world-building and characterisation make Fault -Milestone One- a fantastic standalone visual novel, as well a great first chapter that leaves me eagerly awaiting Fault -Milestone Two-.  So, with that out of the way… Last week, I had finished the first half of If My Heart Had Wings (Kono Oozora), which is apparently the end of common route. Since then, I’ve played another two or three hours, and the game continues to live up to my expectations. The second half of the game begins with a year-long time skip following . I really enjoyed this change in pace. Enough has happened during the year we skipped that the story feels fresh and interesting, but not so much that it feels like we missed out on too much or are being left out of the loop. The subtle changes made to the characters is also really nice, such as  .  This new chapter of the story kicks off with the formal introductions of the remaining two heroines, the twins Asa and Yoru, who are the latest boarders at the Flying Fish Manor. While it seemed weird at first, in retrospect it was cool that they made a few appearances before their proper introductions into the plot. Asa has developed a love of gliders ever since seeing them flying previously. Yoru is just sorta along for the ride. It immediately becomes apparent that Asa will  in the Soaring Club, but this plot-line is drawn out for an hour or two before she actually ends up joining the club. While I’m still enjoying the story so far, I’m not sure where the story will go from here, which makes me think that it might start to slow down considerably. Only time will tell. I also wanted to mention that while it's still very much readable, the translation seems to be getting more inconsistent as the game goes on. By now, I’ve seen the phrase “Hat-senpai” translated as “Senior Hat”, “Hat”, “Hat-senpai” and “Senpai Hat”.  Honestly, my only real gripe is how hard it is to play the game without having it crash or freeze. I’ve had to re-install the game and all its various add-on patches four times now, which ahs really put me off reading it. Either way, it’s still a fun and enjoyable slice-of-life."
visualnovels,3cl9os,Arcanus44,6,Wed Jul 8 21:30:34 2015 UTC,at the recommendation of /u/Arcanus44   This made me make noises no man should ever make
visualnovels,3cl9os,balistafreak,2,Wed Jul 8 21:52:38 2015 UTC,"See, ""the main characters [being] somewhat inconsequential in the long run"" is what made me feel that fault milestone one was such a letdown. They spend all this time building up the rapport of the princess and her guard, and then they get relegated to the role of observers in relation to Rune's story. The visuals are great, yes, the soundtrack is easy on the ears, their individual stories are riveting, and the quality of the prose is upper-tier, but...  I just think the story, the narrative, the pacing, whatever you want to call it, has ""too much"" going on with it to be good, that it's too ""busy"". At least Game of Thrones has family/political ties between most of its characters and viewpoints (emphasis on most), but F:M1 feels like opening a book only to find that a large chunk of it has been hollowed out and another book placed inside. What I read of the outer book was good, and the book inside was pretty good by itself too, I can't help but wonder why the latter had to be put inside the hollowed-out former and why it couldn't have simply been properly placed on the shelf by itself.  All throughout Rune's story I was waiting for the twist that would connect her back to the two characters we'd started with. Maybe that there was basically no connection at all is the twist, that not everyone is conveniently related to each other in contrived ways, but that's precisely how characters end up having stories written about them as a group: because their current circumstances have contrived to relate them to one another. It left me with a sour taste in my mouth.  I know I'll pick up F:M2 the moment it comes out, but that's only because I already read F:M1. I can't in good conscience recommend F:M1 by itself."

Bad news on If My Heart Had Wings - about an hour after where I was up to before it started getting really bad (like, dialogue and character interactions just not making sense). I think/hope this might be a problem with Ageha's route, so I'm going to try switching over to Kotori's route and see if it's any better. Otherwise, that's a huge disappointment, because I was really enjoying it."
visualnovels,3cl9os,superange128,2,Thu Jul 9 22:41:27 2015 UTC,well Ageha's route has mixed reception with how it turns out and that's the one route where the translation is apparently by far at its worst.  Of course this is just from heresay but hopefully you enjoy Kotori's route more.

I went into it expecting ""Sakura Spirit 3: How can the writing get any worse"" and what I got was actually a good story.  Not only that, but the visuals are stunning, the characters are definitely varied, and the BGM is enjoyable.

visualnovels,3cl9os,aspiration,4,Fri Jul 10 04:25:02 2015 UTC,"I decided to start Dear Drops this week because I really felt like reading something lighthearted. So far it's been exactly that. There have definitely been a lot of similarities to KiraKira, especially in the general structure of the story (something bad happens -> learn instrument -> make band -> ).  I'm really liking the fact that a few of the characters are past high school age, which is a nice change from KiraKira. Can't say much about the story so far, since it's pretty formulaic, but instead, I'll blabber about the characters.   Kanade: Definitely best girl, even if she is oddly... shiny. There's just something about a good red-head osananajimi that makes you want to give them a good drill milky punch, namsayin? Master: Probably best friends with Willie Nelson. Chika: Holy shit she's adorable. Gonda: What kind of sick fuck leaves another man stranded?  Riho: Didn't like her much at first, but she's kind of grown on me. Especially after DD Spoilers Yayoi: Not really much to say. Guitaku was hilariously fitting though. Rimu: Okay, how old is she supposed to be? I'm so confused.

Are the Far Side routes better than the Near Side? If not I might put Tsukihime back on hold and read something else while waiting for Subarashiki Hibi and Kara no Shoujo 2."
visualnovels,3cl9os,mbac1,3,Wed Jul 8 21:14:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with those who said the Far Side routes were better - in addition to having a more interesting story, those routes are tied together.  I'd say the Near Side has more information for those interested in the Nasuverse whereas the Far Side is more relevant to Shiki and Tsukihime.  Been a while since I read the VN though, so I might be forgetting something."
visualnovels,3cl9os,balistafreak,3,Thu Jul 9 00:55:52 2015 UTC,"Ciel's problem is that she was clearly designed as a supporting character to Arcueid. Even in Ciel's own route, Arcueid threatens to steal the show quite often.   Far Side routes are much more... cerebral? Twisted? Dark? Complicated? Whatever they are, the main thing they have over Near Side is that all three routes benefit from having done the others first, not layering on top of each other so much as all being part of a common thread of Shiki's past. You'll feel much more satisfied having finished the entire Far Side than you will after clearing the entire Near Side."
visualnovels,3cl9os,elias67,2,Thu Jul 9 11:06:32 2015 UTC,"I found both Near Side routes pretty boring.  You'll like Far Side better as long as you like the characters at the house.  Arc and Ciel pretty much disappear from the story entirely.  I'm pretty sure the chuuni fights also occur less frequently, which is a plus.    Far Side focuses more on Shiki's past instead, which is occasionally pretty cool.  Still, I don't think Tsukihime is all it's hyped up to be, so don't go in expecting the second coming of Jesus or anything."

visualnovels,3cl9os,bpat132,2,Thu Jul 9 17:56:09 2015 UTC,"I think they are very different in content. Arcueid and Ciel play little to no role in the Far Side routes while being the focus of the Near Side roites and the opposite is true for Akiha, Hisui, and Kohaku."

I stopped mostly because of schoolwork and later of travels which prevented me to read steadily, but also because I wanted to find the truth after having read Episode 6. So I still thought a lot during my break, did some theorycrafting and re-read various scenes from all the episodes.  I've just jumped back into the VN by re-reading Ep6 in its entirety. It's truly a masterful tale, my favourite so far, with incredible scenes! Also, it's so highly metaphorical than I had to try and pick the hints again. Ep6 spoiler   Anyway, Here are my thoughts so far! I think I'm really close to finding the truth, but not there yet exactly. Hope Ep7 will enlighten me.  Ep1 to Ep6 spoilers and theories  Ep1 to Ep6 spoilers and theories again  Ep1 to Ep6 spoilers and theories yet again  Still Ep1-6 spoilers  Ep1-6 spoilers  So, that's it! What do you think, everyone? (No, please don't tell me the truth for real, I'm almost there anyway.)  Really glad to find out soon if I'm completely mistaken or right on spot. Sorry for this rational dissection of the tales Ep5 spoiler, I'll probably make other posts with more love later, but in short, Umineko was great in so many many ways, and just like /u/ctom42 says, it just keeps getting better. <3  Thanks to everyone who comments on the VN in the sub by the way, everyone is always lovely! In my initial readthrough (Ep1-6), I tried to isolate myself from the Internet, but during my theorycrafting break, I really enjoyed reading other people's thoughts in this weekly thread, got lots of food for thought and made my reading much more enjoyable!

In those two weeks I finished Cho Dengeki Stryker and started Majikoi S.  Dengeki was pretty good. I wouldn't rate it as high as OverDrive's best work (imo) Kira Kira but it was still pretty entertaining. Most of what I said here still stands for DS as a whole but it does improve in both Sky and Light chapters. Steel chapter I am happy they addressed the stuff I hoped it would in regards to Zero/Light Over all a fun VN if you like OverDrive's style but I don't think others will get much out of it.  I started Majikoi S after finishing that to do me until Subahibi's patch drops but ended up finishing pretty much all the translated paths already. It's such a hard VN to put down once you start, just like the original Majikoi. The addition of fully animated scenes was nice and all the new characters are great too. I'm going to go route by route for this one since I have different praise/criticism for each.  Kokoro's route was the one I was most looking forward too and I enjoyed it somewhat. The biggest problem was that it felt a bit short. What was there was good (although the marathon of h-scenes halfway through was jarring) but it felt more like a fandisc route rather than an actual route.   Margit's Route has earned a place in the hallowed halls of ""Route's that I wish never happened"". It's sitting nicely there with Chris' from the original. It was just stupid. Margit + Chris routes Fuck that route.  Tsubame's route is one I liked. It was long enough thankfully and had a pretty good story compared to the other two. Also Tsubame was amazing. Such a fun character every time she showed up. Her never ending natto advertising was hilarious and her rivalry with Momoyo was great too. Tsubame  Monshiro's route. 10/10 Mon-sama best Majikoi. I never seen a heroine as cute as Monshiro. Her route literally outdoes pretty much every moege I've played. I mean look at this. I'm pretty sure my blood-sugar levels surpassed healthy levels reading that route. If this route doesn't turn you into a lolicon then nothing ever will. Now I just have to withstand the suffering of waiting for the Monshiro after + route in A-2."

visualnovels,3cl9os,mdzjdz,3,Fri Jul 10 04:58:53 2015 UTC,"Starting my read of Mirai Nostalgia.  I'm not sure what to expect of the work yet. So far, there's been a lot of bearable (not necessarily engaging) slice of life. There's evidently some plot development going on in the background, with some subtle foreshadowing, but until things take off, I have no idea about the direction of the work.  Aside from the contents of the work itself, I dislike Purple Software's engine, it's not the most aesthetically appealing nor the most ergonomically navigable. Mirai Nostalgia has good art (incidentally, better than Purple Software's latest work, Chrono Clock), and the soundtrack's not entirely forgettable & generic.   All in all, I'm looking forward to the work. I think for my next read, I'll pick up something with actual heavy plot. The problem's that a lot of the plot-based works are either significantly more difficult to read (e.g. Light works), or as 'plot heavy' as most other works (a great deal of slice of life in-between the more serious scenes; G-Senj & Sharin are probably two translated examples that demonstrate this point). It's not to say that works with slice of life can't have plot (e.g. White Album 2 is an example); it's just that more often than not, works with slice of life tend to focus on it far too much."

I've skipped this thread a few weeks (mostly because I had to take a break from reading because of exams), but I've finally finished Umineko. Well, I wouldn't say I've really finished it, because I won't be satisfied until I manage to solve everything I've missed and I know I'll end up re-reading it sooner or later, so... I guess this is more of a <see you again>.  I went into Umineko not knowing much about it, just that it was one of the most highly regarded VNs and that it was a mystery, which is my favorite genre, and I really got more than I expected. The  were an amazing concept, and there wasn't a moment where I remember a move not making logical sense .  Although the mystery portions were toned down in the latter parts of the story , I still enjoyed them either way, because Umineko is not just about the mystery. Would I have stuck out for over a hundred hours of emotionless logic puzzles? Well, maybe for a few of them... but it just wouldn't be the same. Why? To put in in Umineko's terms: because it would have no love. And a story without love isn't a story worth telling.  I have to applaud Ryukishi07, because managing to create such a layered and complex tale while still letting you figure out everything on your own (although I still think it takes a genious to solve it before episode 6) is no small feat."

The characters seem pretty good although not many of them have gotten that many scenes yet except for Leo. The minigames are actually more fun than I thought they would be since they seemed pretty simple, but they do work well with getting you into the mood of the scene more.  Also a little bit of anecdote (and bragging) but I was able to get a hard copy of season 1 at the mangagamer booth at AX since that was almost all they had left (I got there like an hour after they opened and they only had the  one copy of that, some Higurashi, and some Higanbana.)

Overall it was pretty nice, though at some places it kind of dragged on.   Most interesting route was probably Amane's  .  Most fitting couple/romance was probably Yumiko, but the route itself felt kind of repetitive at times which made it IMO the most boring one.   I liked the Sachi route a lot, even if the damsel in distress theme was kind of present through the whole route. [ ](#s "" I think it would've been more satisfying if Sachi did more thinks without Yuuji's help closer to the end, otherwise the story itself was not bad. )  I'll say that I will some day do Michuru and Makina's routes, but right now I need a break from Grisaia.

Plus there's a mysterious type of rare water that is capable of making whatever it touches disappear.  Ame provides some hints about the nature of those mysterious things.  As for getting the books themselves licensed... It's an interesting idea the staff has bounced around already, but publishing books is very different from publishing games. We're looking into how feasible it is, and will decide from there."

visualnovels,3cgg0l,Aginyan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:31:53 2015 UTC,"Stage-nana is his personal doujin circle. Nekoneko Soft pretty much was a company that formed out of that circle way back in the day, so he also acts as a main director and writer for NNS. That's why it can be difficult to tell the two apart at times.  Thanks to that relationship, sometimes music or art assets are shared between the two. For example, a lot of the music used in Ame was previous used in Ramune, Scarlett, Narcissu, etc. And at least 1 track from Ame is used in NNS's latest game Sumire."

visualnovels,3cdppe,PurplePudding,2,Tue Jul 7 09:52:43 2015 UTC,Bit too late. Pretty sure everyone in this thread is spoiled at this point.
visualnovels,3cdppe,mdzjdz,13,Tue Jul 7 10:05:42 2015 UTC,"What to expect:  A lot of thinking.  SubaHibi's not really a straightforward work. There are works that are good simply because they tell an excellent story directly (e.g. MLA and Aiyoku no Eustia being two examples). It's not to say that these works aren't complex (as MLA is a work constituted in part by complex characters & world mechanics, and Eustia, similarly). It's just that most readers, by the end of these type of works, will probably understand the work fully (more or less).  SubaHibi's a work that requires a great deal of effort in fully appreciating. The plot which it does have is intricately, and excellently told; but I don't think that SubaHibi's a work which is good primarily for its plot (although it does have good plot). It's remembered more for what it tries to convey (which isn't so obvious), and how it tries to convey it. Subahibi's not difficult because of its allusions (as these allusions are explained in a fairly simplistic, straightforward way in most instances); it's more difficult in that it has a lot of parts, none of which, are tied to an overtly-obvious goal. It's open-ended, and less straightforward in this way (it's not to say that Subahibi's some artsy-abstract rorschach test though; as mentioned, its contents are very coherent and explainable, it's more so synthesizing its straightforward pieces into some intelligible, less straightforward whole).     I personally think that SubaHibi's probably one of the best visual novels out there. It's a work which makes use of the visual novel medium in itself to tell a fulfilling, complex story (Subahibi wouldn't work with any other medium). It's a work with strong fundamentals (excellent characterization, plot, and aesthetics [music + art]). But more than that, it's a memorable work that'll leave the reader thinking (via its themes, what it tries to convey, and whether or not it's succeeded at doing so)."
visualnovels,3cdppe,Koush,8,Tue Jul 7 04:38:43 2015 UTC,"MLA is often said to be the best VN people has read but I personally said number of times that I consider it the worst kamige. I am not saying that MLA or any other translated kamiges are bad, but VNs like subahibi are in a different level and I'm sure many of you will understand what I mean once you finish subahibi.   Baby them be fighting words around here, I will read Subahibi which I've been waiting for a long time since I begun reading VN's and then I'm coming for you."
visualnovels,3cdppe,herkz,5,Tue Jul 7 15:16:06 2015 UTC,"MLA is good and visually extremely impressive, but it doesn't have the same kind of depth Subahibi does. Not that it should; it definitely works better without trying to have some complicated plot, but Subahibi definitely blows it out of the water in that department."
visualnovels,3cdppe,hyperknees91,2,Tue Jul 7 17:33:04 2015 UTC,"I would not go into Subahibi with that mindset. Generally overhyping something leads to a lot of disappointed people (kinda like the the last of us for gamers).   Plus MLA and Subahibi are absolutely nothing alike. So just because you like one a lot, doesn't mean you'll like the other.   Regardless I'm not sure why he says its the worst of the Kamige's (a silly concept anyway)...I get he's excited and all but I think it's counterproductive to hype one game by bashing another because everyone else thinks one game is so good. Regardless MLA is higher rated on both EGS and vndb so just take what you will out of that."
visualnovels,3cdppe,yawarakai,8,Wed Jul 8 14:06:20 2015 UTC,"I don't have too much to say here, I think Subahibi is an exceptionally ""personal"" game and everyone should just go in with the bare minimum knowledge about it and take it for what it is.  It's one of my favorite eroge of all time with a level of depth that's hard to find in any kind of fiction, let alone eroge.  Reading it had a profound effect on me and introduced me to a myriad of new concepts that significantly altered the way I view the world and life in general.  It is -the game- that made me see what this medium can do when it's utilized to it's fullest, I honestly think this is one of the most important translations that will ever come out for the western eroge fanbase.  I am confident there will be a huge number of trolls and those who simply do not take the game seriously, but I genuinely hope that it impacts at least a few people in the same way that it did for me.  The people posting spoilers in this thread are indeed assholes, but luckily Subahibi is not the kind of game that can be ruined by being spoiled on a few plot points.  It's a game that explores some very powerful concepts and a large portion of it is incredibly raw, touching, and mind expanding even on subsequent rereads.  I don't think it matters all that much. I urge anyone who has been spoiled not to write the game off just because of that, you will be missing out.  I hope the patch garners a huge amount of attention because Subahibi really does deserve it."
visualnovels,3cdppe,riruru,3,Wed Jul 8 00:08:51 2015 UTC,Agreed on all counts. Especially with regards to people going in with as little information as possible.  Don't read reviews. Don't seek out reactions. Don't read this thread.  Just go for it.

visualnovels,3cdppe,awxvn,7,Wed Jul 8 00:56:26 2015 UTC,"Subahibi has impacted me on a profoundly personal level and it is one of the reasons I learned Japanese for.  That said, I wish people stop using the term 'kamige' as a genre descriptor. It is and has always been a buzzword. The word literally means ""godly game"". Popular and critically acclaimed games are called ""kamige"". Yakuza 2 is a kamige. Pokemon ORAS is a kamige. Robin Lloyd is a kamige. As far as I know, it just means ""wow this is a really good game that I personally like"". It makes zero sense to call Muv-Luv Alternative the ""worst kamige"".  Because there is no such genre that defines what a ""kamige"" is. Like seriously, how would you compare MLA to SubaHibi in the first place? There is nothing similar in anything. They are different breeds altogether.  I do think the SubaHibi translation will be huge and may be the largest VN to be tl'd for a long time. But the last kamige to be translated? What the hell does that mean?"

Is it like having the entire plot spoiled, or is it just a small part of the entire thing, making it fully worth playing the game anyway despite knowing?"
visualnovels,3cdppe,Harlequina,8,Tue Jul 7 08:05:18 2015 UTC,"It's not that big of a deal in the long-run; the reader begins to suspect this fairly early on, and it's confirmed midway through the work. There's still the latter half of the work to be concerned about. Moreover, just knowing that fact does nothing without also knowing the purpose behind it.  And in the worst case scenario -- SubaHibi's not a work renowned solely for its plot in any case. Knowing particular plot points won't really spoil that much of it (being told that Juliet dies at the end of Romeo &  Juliet, or even more severely, that Snape was the good guy might spoil certain plot aspects, but retrospectively, what matters is the message behind these plot points & the method through which it's told -- the experience)."
visualnovels,3cdppe,Spideyday,4,Tue Jul 7 08:40:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it will probably just make you appreciate all of the foreshadowing better (one of the reasons SubaHibi is so replayable.) It's an important plot element, but SubaHibi doesn't hinge on its plot twists to the same degree as, say, Ever17 or Sharin. If you hadn't been spoiled, you'd probably have long since figured it out by the time it's actually revealed, and the game's real payoff is emotional and comes quite a bit later than that.  SubaHibi is definitely still worth playing no matter how many spoilers you know."
visualnovels,3cdppe,insanityissexy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:29:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that perspective, I'm sure I'll enjoy the story no matter what but it's definitely calming to know that it's not so serious a spoiler.

visualnovels,3cdppe,Wahfuu,4,Tue Jul 7 10:00:28 2015 UTC,"Coincidentally I was spoiled on pretty much that exact point before reading Umineko. I hope this Subahibi spoiler is similar to that one, and that knowing about it won't affect my experience that much."

Like another poster said it won't destroy your enjoyment likely, just the sense of mystery."
visualnovels,3cdppe,PurplePudding,2,Tue Jul 7 09:55:38 2015 UTC,"A few technical questions:  You mentioned there were multiple endings, is there some kind of true ending that ties it all together? Or are there just 3 endings? The possibility that this VN might not have a single concise ending but 3 endings is a bit of a turn off for me.  Is there romance in the story? I know its a horror VN. But in MLA the romance element (romance may not be the perfect word here but you get what I mean) was very important. Im a huge fan of romantic VNs like Clannad and Symphonic Rain and A huge part of my decision to read this VN or not will be based on this question.  And finally is it all one program? Like its all contained in a single VN with several chapters, not several small VNs right?  Really I think what matters to me the most here is how it ends. I don't want to go through another Cross Channel again, with people saying how amazing the VN is and it having the worst ending I've ever had to read in any VN  Edit: Why am I being downvoted for asking questions? Guess next time I wont bother :/"

visualnovels,3cdppe,AkaiDown,3,Tue Jul 7 05:29:11 2015 UTC,"I haven't read the rest of the comments but some other works that weren't mentioned in the post that are referenced in Subahibi are ""On learned Ignorance"" by Nicholas de Cusa and ""The Brain is Wider Than the Sky"" - by Emily Dickinson. I'm currently still in the middle of reading it but it's an extremely beautiful poetic experience that I just can't really articulate how much I love it at the moment. There are lots of interesting characters, very powerful disturbing scenes, very interesting and beautiful scenes and the writing is extremely pretty. Though I'm sure there are a lot more works that I forgot about or just don't know of that get referenced. I really hope that it gets as much love as I express towards it because I find it to be extremely beautiful."
visualnovels,3cdppe,Loffah,2,Tue Jul 7 05:58:03 2015 UTC,"Well, that Dickinson poem is quoted in full in the game, so there's not really any reason to mention it."

visualnovels,3cdppe,hyperknees91,3,Tue Jul 7 06:29:18 2015 UTC,This only made me go from really wanting to prioritize this over everything to consider not touching it at all. I guess that's a good thing as i don't really like horror and would get surprised if i just jumped into it like i prefer to do. My opinion is that you get the best out of a story if you don't know anything about it before you start reading. I don't mind most things but if there is horror i don't know.
visualnovels,3cdppe,pik3rob,2,Tue Jul 7 07:14:38 2015 UTC,The only two visual novels that I've read that could be called disturbing are Saya no Uta and Swan Song. Where would you rank Subahibi against those two?
visualnovels,3cdppe,hyperknees91,2,Tue Jul 7 09:20:05 2015 UTC,Haven't read either so I can't really say. I'm sure someone else could answer it though
visualnovels,3cdppe,Vladz0r,2,Tue Jul 7 10:32:16 2015 UTC,"So I've heard comparisions to Subahibi to Umineko, in particular how it requires you to think and that revelations later on in the story change the meaning of previous scenes.

visualnovels,3cdppe,pik3rob,2,Tue Jul 7 14:13:32 2015 UTC,"if true, this makes me more interested"

visualnovels,3cdppe,pik3rob,2,Tue Jul 7 05:35:07 2015 UTC,"Much much much more disturbing and impressionable than either of those, and I thoroughly enjoyed Swan Song and thought Saya no Uta was legit.

visualnovels,3cdppe,hyperknees91,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:26:48 2015 UTC,Long route though.   Inventions and Insects are the two routes with the gross stuff. So as long as you can get past that you should be good to go for the rest of the game. Most of the game isn't really like that thankfully.
visualnovels,3cdppe,pik3rob,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:33:01 2015 UTC,As long as there's no jump scares I think I'll be ok. I've yet to encounter a VN with jump scares however.
visualnovels,3cdppe,wqopreuitysaklfdhjg,2,Tue Jul 7 05:37:08 2015 UTC,"Ranking it on a scale would be an extremely reductive way of looking at it for we all consume media in different ways. When it comes to more sensitive material one cannot possibly gauge how 'disturbing' it may be on an objective level for depending on the person, they may have been affected in a vastly different way. For reference, although I first read Subahibi upon release it contained scenes which made my blood run cold and had a profound impact on me to the point where I can still remember what I felt, what the weather was like, what I wore while reading them. In comparison I have long since forgotten anything disturbing in Saya no Uta or Swan Song, let alone whether or not they affected me in the first place so take that as you will.   What the characters experience here is on a much more personal scale compared to the collective sense of grief shown in Swan Song, compared to even what Fuminori and Saya went through for they ultimately had each other. Due to that Subahibi may hit harder than the former's apocalyptic situation or latter's fantastic cognitive disorder. As is the case with most denpa titles the human psyche is pushed to its limit, and the unreal is utilized to explore the real with the lines often merging. No detail is left spared once Subahibi starts plumbing those depths.   But having said that much, while many are quick to speak of Subahibi's more disturbing moments they will often forget to mention that it's an intensely human work. There is light, and hope to be found."

visualnovels,3cdppe,hyperknees91,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:55:06 2015 UTC,"Swan Song for sure. Especially with the bullying scenes.   Though the subahibi isn't really that disturbing in comparison if you ask me, because Swan Song is a lot more realistic like you said."

If you think the chomp scene in a certain VN was disturbing, well it's gonna be a lot worse and lot more of it in subahibi.   Hm, while the chomp scene didn't affect me too badly (scared me at first, kinda like a jumpscare in a horror movie, but got over it pretty quickly), I'm not sure if I wanna put myself through more. How bad are we talking about here? I'm okay with minor spoilers if that'll help the explanation.  To be honest, I'll probably end up playing it regardless. I'm just kinda curious.

visualnovels,3cdppe,Shige_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:29:50 2015 UTC,It's the prototype Sca-ji made beforehand.
visualnovels,3cdppe,ShinoAsada0,3,Tue Jul 7 05:01:51 2015 UTC,"""Prototype"" implies SCA-JI wrote Tsui no Sora in preparation for making SubaHibi, which is not really true. Mainly because they were released over a decade apart. Tsui no Sora also covers only about half of the story SubaHibi later became and arguably doesn't even include its core plot or themes.  It would be better to describe SubaHibi as an evolution of Tsui no Sora. It incorporates the vast majority of Tsui no Sora's script in a rewritten form, and there's no real reason to read Tsui no Sora instead of SubaHibi or in addition to it, other than out of simple curiosity regarding the origins of the story (SCA-JI himself has said he'd prefer that people didn't read Tsui no Sora nowadays.)  Not that you have the option unless you know Japanese. So might as well just forget it exists."

I know it sucks when a side-girl you like doesn't get a route, but I always see it as a positive because the writer isn't writing every heroine with the intent to fall in love with the main character. Sometimes its ok for him to not be that popular xD"
visualnovels,3cen5v,hyperknees91,3,Tue Jul 7 11:47:10 2015 UTC,"AoKana's just a really solid, consistent game with good pacing. It doesn't get boring -- it feels like an anime at times (which is a good and bad thing). In this sense, it's not as detailed/complex as most other visual novels (although keep in mind, it doesn't try to be that detailed; it goes for very succinct development).   As you noted, the aesthetics of the work are really great. The work's largest flaw (to some) might be its rather cursory storytelling (it's very superficial, surface stuff -- there's not a lot of complex characterization, or substantial plot; the characters are by all means really likable though)."

visualnovels,3cbrqy,mdzjdz,5,Mon Jul 6 18:02:24 2015 UTC,"I just finished reading Neyuki no Genei.   It's similar to Nanairo Reincarnation in a few ways. For one, both works are dominantly works of mystery. And two, both works contain a great deal of sexual content (it's just that Nanairo's is significantly more tasteful and reasonable).   Despite having nice art, the soundtrack was as a whole, very forgettable. It's titled as a 'horror' work by some, but I think that's a very minor element (the horror's only in a few scenes; it's not continuous).   Ultimately, while the work wrapped up in a meaningful way, it wasn't really satisfying. The plot, while central, seemed pointless (in the sense that this entire work felt like the filler episode to some other work; there's no continuous theme, motif, or purpose -- no real character development, just an 'interesting mystery'). On level of the mystery itself, it wasn't told that well; a lot of the details were literally given through dialogue (this is apparent as this game has an overwhelming amount of choices for a 'short' game). There's a deus ex machina towards the end of the work, that serves to explain the mystery too.   The flaws of the work are further exacerbated by the fact that some of the plot developments are so 'nukige-esque' (engaging in sexual acts with attractive women for the sake of getting a clue, polygamy being fine, sexual slavery being fine in some instances). I don't think that this work is obviously a nukige (as it has points with high sexual content, followed by points with very low sexual content -- the work prioritizes its storyline, it's just that the events in the storyline are dubious).   In any case, while it wasn't the best work, I did 'enjoy' the work to the extent of caring about the characters, and what ultimately happened at the end. The concept of the work wasn't bad, it just needed more meaningful development.   Tentatively, I'm planning to read Mirai Nostalgia next.  I hope it doesn't disappoint."

Subahibi is downright magical and is a wholly unique experience that transcends any complaint I could leverage against it. If you consider yourself an ""otaku"" or are interested in Japanese subculture at all you absolutely have to play Subahibi; no ifs, ands, or buts about it. I fell in love with the game all over again replaying it five years later - there's really something special here.  The translation patch is being released at the end of the month, and I sincerely hope that the English community gives Subahibi the attention it deserves. It is seriously really amazing and one of a kind.  I could write a lot more about this game, but I'll save it for when the patch is out; I'm probably going to be pretty obnoxious with hyping the game when that happens, lol. For now I'll just say: 幸福に生きよ！  Also, this Subahibi MAD is pretty damn cool.   It seems like the trial for Sakura no Uta, the spiritual successor to Subahibi and what prompted my reread of it, will be coming out soon, so I think I'll refrain from starting another eroge until that's out.

The first two chapters are really focused on the military: their operation, the different personalities, the inevitable incompatibility with the ideals of the press or the civilian rule. There's no immature or evil conflict going along here, just admirable/amiable characters and the grim situation.  There's a lot of military info dump. Sousei's the first story I've seen with a setting with so many moving parts. The combination of fighter pilots, recon, tactical and rescue pilots, air control, high tactical command painted a whole picture and got the feeling across. I could really get into the military combat. Muramasa did have a large setting, but the VN was less accessible and the feel was different: the war was more political than tactical, and the VN itself was more like a stage for the characters.  Now, with the appearance of the mech on the front cover, I feel the VN has left the miltiary focus behind and is headed for new directions. Thing's like Shin's growth, and topics like ""Humans can overcome anything."" and ""Humans must overcome the obstacles.""  Even though I know it's a valid story construction, I'm having a hard time suspending my disbelief about the mech though. It kind of kills the gravity of the military's actions because it's so much stronger than humanity's military power. Gotta work on that flexible mindset. At least here's a believable reason why it can't be used arbitrarily and why it needs to be used as little as possible.   Sousei reminds me again why I appreciate VN's with one main storyline (little branching). Not every story works with a branch for every heroine."

visualnovels,3cbrqy,dontjealous,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:15:30 2015 UTC,"I hope its okay if I ask this here. I’m not reading any VN right now, but I do have a question for you guys. With the Angel Beats VN being announced, I have given thought to whether I see myself playing visual novels in the far future (I do). With that in mind, I’ve decided that I want to try learning Japanese. I’m fully aware of the possibility of me giving up, or not making any headway, but I don’t want to look at an untranslated VN in the future that I want to read and think ""damn, if only I had tried learning Japanese"". My question for those of you who learnt Japanese with the express purpose of reading it (be it manga, novels, etc.), how did you go about it, and how was your approach different from learning all aspects the language generally rather than just reading (if at all)? Additional discussion/advice from anyone is welcome."
visualnovels,3cbrqy,EqZero,2,Mon Jul 6 21:40:22 2015 UTC,"Hi, i see 2 ways for you.  First way is you learn japanese first, you look all the grammar, grind kana->kanji, then try to read easy VNs(moege or nukige or whatever.)  This way you learn japanese stabely.  Second way is what i chose. I take a soft that takes lines from VN and parses it into words. Then you read it. It works on majority of VNs and fails only on RPG/other VNs with compicated UI where you can't hook to lines for whatever reason(for example Baldr sky where, as i guess,half of the text is printed in the images that can't be recognized by a machine)  I talk about that soft here.  I read untranslated VNs with this shit for about 9 months now and it's okay. I even can understand quite a bit of phrases without looking for parser. Learning japanese while reading your fav VN is the most optimal for me so i do it. Try it, see if it works. You can look up all unknown grammar while you read."
visualnovels,3cbrqy,dontjealous,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:05:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying.  I see. Did you used any spaced repetition software (like anki) along the way to learn kanji as you encountered them, or did you just read while looking up grammar along the way?"
visualnovels,3cbrqy,EqZero,2,Mon Jul 6 22:52:10 2015 UTC,"I used anki at first but got bored. If you have even slight dilligence(unlike me) you're gonna be allright. At start i wrote all words i didn't know to anki. There was about 1.5k per game. There are 20 cards per day, so it was hard. So I just abandoned it halfway.  I'd rather just read, and just encounter the word 100 times in a text and remember it that way."

visualnovels,3cbrqy,dontjealous,2,Mon Jul 6 23:16:32 2015 UTC,"up in the dictionary along the way   except parser instantly show you the meaning of the word(all the meanings, also, so you can choose what this words means depending on the context.)  It's so much easier than what i did with english or german when i first tried reading books in the these languages."

But that's honestly not what I got at all from listening to him speak. So much energy and excitement, someone brought up a potential side-story of Umineko where everyone dies in one room and he started laughing his ass off and talking about how fun and interesting an idea that sounds. He was really encouraging to everyone and just a really genuine person, he didn't say anything snarky or rude or dismissive at all, really seemed to encourage everyone's creativity, I don't even think he put himself down in any way beyond the typical humble ""Oh I'm not a big deal at all there are much better writers"" thing.   I think he's been really, really misrepresented as an artist, if anything I got more of a ""laid-back version of Monty Oum"" vibe from the guy where he wanted to do like 40 different things all at once but simply lacked the time to do so.

visualnovels,3c8mjl,ScubaSteeeve,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:42:16 2015 UTC,"I was there as well.  To expand a little it:  The Nasu question I believe was related to seeing him before because of the whole type moon connection.  He called Nasu a god-like figure and was making the bowing signal, which was pretty funny.  He also said he played Mahjong with him but lost badly.  One other question was related to Umineko getting side stories like Higurashi did with Higurashi Hou and he said yes to that.  Someone suggested a side story where everyone dies in one single room and he said that was an interesting concept.    Overall he was really an amazing guy to talk to and was extremely friendly."

I agree that you should only vote for the couple based on their relationship in the visual novel. I personally voted Rin & Shirou. The anime certainly did its part in reminding me that they can sometimes be a kind of sort of nice couple. (Though I'm still more of a Shirou & Saber fan)  But I also voted for them because I think Takeru and Meiya have bad chemistry; I feel the chemistry is mostly coming from her side and there's pretty much zero from Takeru's. I love Meiya as a character, but I don't like Takeru & Meiya as a couple very much.   Though in the end I don't particularly like any relationship of which Takeru or Shirou is one half."

A similar kind of pairing as Kurisu and Rin play a similar kind of role. Okabe and Shirou are both kind of crazy in different ways as well so that only provides more trouble for their girls =p. I'm going to give the ball to the Okabe team here because Okabe sparks a little bit more believable love from Kurisu then Shirou does for Rin. Plus personally I found Okabe more entertaining then Rin so that made the couple more fun to watch for me. Love the other couple as well of course, but I don't think they are quite as special as the other.   Haru x Kyousuke vs Battler x Beatrice.  Hard to really compare these two. Battler x Beatrice are more creative in terms of forming a relationship and they are the most dynamic couple here, but perhaps people will prefer the more emotional bond that Kyousuke x Haru develop. Personally I want to say Battler x Beatrice is a lot more naturally developed and there isn't a single forced scene between the two of them, while I feel like they perhaps dropped that Haru x Kyousuke is a couple on the audience a little less believably. And well...Battler x Beatrice are way better characters then those two in terms of overall development and complexity, so they kind of lose by default for me anyway. Not sure who will win but yeah."

visualnovels,3c649r,Harlequina,11,Sun Jul 5 04:50:50 2015 UTC,"Bern and Lambda actually look really good in the Pachinko sprites. Unfortunately I can't say the same for Beatrice, Battler, and Maria."
visualnovels,3c649r,Marche100,9,Sun Jul 5 04:55:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Some of the sprites look quite good, like Bern and Lambda as you said, while others... not so much. Definitely don't like Battler's personally."
visualnovels,3c649r,Vladz0r,6,Sun Jul 5 05:06:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Battler's is the most off-putting of the three not-so-great ones to me. At least Beatrice and Maria's are...tolerable, but for some reason Battler's skin is tanner than everyone else's? Almost makes him look like a totally different person.  You can see others in this video. I dunno. It's really hit or miss. Like, Kinzo's is really bad  (you can see him for half a second around 34-35 seconds in) but others like Episode 3 look pretty decent. In my opinion, of course."
visualnovels,3c649r,biggest_decision,2,Sun Jul 5 05:18:26 2015 UTC,Whaaaaat? Kinzo looks beast in the Pachinko version though haha.
visualnovels,3c649r,Harlequina,9,Sun Jul 5 05:31:22 2015 UTC,"The Battler sprite just needs some face work, tbh. If the face was better, and didn't make him look like such an asshole, the sprite would be great."
visualnovels,3c649r,Ressha,4,Sun Jul 5 06:29:20 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's definitely the face. The clothes look great actually."
visualnovels,3c649r,ctom42,3,Sun Jul 5 16:36:06 2015 UTC,He looks very evil in the new sprite. It sort've detracts from the 'hero of the truth' image I have of him.

Apparently it's based off the Umineko Pachinko Slot Machine art. Opening here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ky-5HAYu-xE (mad fight and character spoilers)  I know we can't have the Alchemist sprites because of licensing and all that, but eh. I feel like it loses its coolness and looks kinda weird now."

visualnovels,3c649r,ctom42,5,Sun Jul 5 04:50:15 2015 UTC,"Most of the sprite weirdness is just from seeing a single one for the first time out of context, people reacted the same way for Higurashi. Then we saw the expressions of them (Higurashi Spoilers) when playing and people just say ""you can get the old ones if you want to"". Watching the pachslot op I could definitely see them growing on me even if I prefer the PS3 ones from having seen them first."

It's also possible someone will make the Umitweak patch compatible, but it depends on how different the engines are (For just the sprites, replaceing the files should work, as long as they are named the same, which may take a fair amount of effort, especially since each sprite might not have a direct equivalent). There is also the full PS3 patch that is currently being worked on, but I doubt that will be adapted for this since it's a lot more work."

visualnovels,3c649r,timpkmn89,2,Sun Jul 5 04:46:23 2015 UTC,I just hope they do the portrait backgrounds for Steam profiles.
visualnovels,3c649r,Fuwante0,3,Sun Jul 5 08:10:48 2015 UTC,Its new art is pretty interesting  I was expecting them to use the PS3 art though  Wonder why they redid it?
visualnovels,3c649r,wongsta,6,Sun Jul 5 11:48:38 2015 UTC,PS3 art is owned by the studio that did the PS3 port. It's cheaper and easier (legally speaking) to go this route.
visualnovels,3c649r,Vorgier,3,Sun Jul 5 13:03:14 2015 UTC,"I think the reason's the same for the Higurashi Steam version. My guess is because having original art only would hurt sales and the PS3 art would be very expensive. This time however they're not making new sprites but using the ones from the lesser known Umineko Pachinko machine which I imagine would be cheaper.  If it's as easy to mod as the Steam version of Higurashi, it shouldn't take that long for someone to replace the art with PS3 assets."
visualnovels,3c649r,ctom42,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:46:48 2015 UTC,"no idea. I think the art is from the umineko pachinko version, you can  see more here (loads slowly):  http://www.oizumi.co.jp/machine/umineko/"

visualnovels,3c649r,Catasplurge,2,Sun Jul 5 05:07:22 2015 UTC,How does Umineko stand up to Higurashi?   Umineko is widely considered to be significantly better than Higurashi.

visualnovels,3c649r,Uninformedperson,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:26:55 2015 UTC,"The main story of Umineko is in separated into two games ""Umineko no Naku Koro Ni"" and ""Umineko no Naku Koro Ni Chiru"" both of which have 4 chapters each. Umineko is usually regarded as being better than Higurashi, although the beginning of it can be boring if you didn't like Higurashi's first few hours. There are also two fandisks called ""Umineko Hane"" and ""Uminek Tsubasa"" which have a few either humorous or serious sidestories and the serious ones are usually taken by the fans as being canon."

visualnovels,3c649r,ctom42,3,Sun Jul 5 10:32:59 2015 UTC,"I might have been overly cynical about Umineko steam release after the recent Higurashi towel scene thingy.   Have you considered that every version of Higurashi since the original has given her a towel? It's not like taking the towel away makes her look even more desolate. If you have to pick between naked child and almost naked child when both have the same effect, from every perspective picking almost naked seems far better.  EDIT: Actually according to your list you haven't even played the game, so acting like they chose to censor the game in a moment you haven't even seen is ridiculous."
visualnovels,3c649r,YujiYuji,3,Sun Jul 5 11:44:02 2015 UTC,"Wow, the sprite second from the left is amazingly powerful. If that's one of the new sprites, than I need to renew my negative opinion on them."

It's my second VN so I'm fairly uninitiated in this area of Japanese media and not sure of all the standards. My question is probably pretty simple. Is Kotarou voice acted? I don't hear him actually talk in game while playing, but he has a voice slider and an audible voice preview on the volume slider. I couldn't find a single thing about this by Googling, so I'm really curious.  Thanks!"
visualnovels,3c7jqn,JamesVagabond,3,Sun Jul 12 08:36:17 2015 UTC,"Protagonists in VNs are rarely voiced and Rewrite's Kotarou is almost not an exception. He will be voiced in the final part of the novel, but the rest of it he spends silent. In other words, Kotarou not having a voice is intended, in case you thought it was a technical problem.  I hope you enjoy Rewrite. It is easily one of my favourites, although I haven't read some of the major VNs yet, so perhaps there is even better stuff out there."
visualnovels,3c7jqn,bigfoot1291,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:49:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info man. I figured it was intended, but the voice slider just threw me off. I'm actually a decent chunk into it (I think?) at around October 16 or 17th. I love it so far. Ohtori best"
visualnovels,3c7jqn,GodBlessHDHR,2,Mon Jul 13 01:56:00 2015 UTC,"I just finished Katawa Shoujo and I loved it. All the choices seemed meaningful, there were many endings and routes to explore, and to top it all off the music was pretty nice as well(especially the menu theme). It didn't feel like scrolling through half an hour of text to make a semi meaningless decision and repeat, like some visual novels.   I haven't played very many visual novels, but I was hoping someone could recommend me a personal favorite or just a great visual novel with a similiar feel to Katawa Shoujo. Obviously I don't mean the crippled girls aspect, but just a romantic school visual novel with lots of choices and story paths.   Whether it has adult content or not doesn't matter to me, I'm really just looking for a visual novel that feels genuine and non linear(hope I used that right) like KS.  This ended up being a bit longer than I'd anticipated, but if you find the time to read and respond to this I really appreciate it, and thank you in advance."

I personally recommend Grisaia no Kajitsu to anyone that started with KS.

With the way it's going so far I have no idea when to guess when the common route will be done especially since it seems kinda long so far. Since the first route is Benio's and you're forced to go through it the first time, is there some kind of indicator you'll be done with the common route and that you are actually in Benio's route?  Speaking of which, I know Benio has to be done first and Kagome has to be last but is there any recommended order to do the middle 3 routes or does it not really matter?

visualnovels,3c7jqn,FinalNwo,3,Sun Jul 12 00:18:07 2015 UTC,"Well, the three middle-routes are shorter than Benio's and Kagome's routes. If we consider the length of the common route itself, Benio's and Kagome's routes seem to be equally long, but going by pure route length, the winner would be Kagome.  It actually is the shortest though, because you just aren't able to stop until you're done. :^)"

visualnovels,3c7jqn,superange128,6,Sat Jul 11 21:31:42 2015 UTC,"So I'm thinking of running a Visual Novel panel at an upcoming anime convention (called Anime California, it's on August 28th weekend in Anaheim, California).  My general idea is to get anime fans into VNs by giving a brief overview of what VNS are, and some good recommendations for first-timers and recs for people have more experience. The anime community seems to be the best community to get to visual novels since they are very similar to anime story-wise.  If I have time, I would consider talking about all the related big Steam news and such and where to buy VNs legally.  However there are few things I'm trying to brianstorm before submitting such as:   The title and description of the panel that would show on the panel books. I was thinking something like ""Visual Novels: What they Are, Why you should read them and Recommendations"" but that's too long for a title. Anyone have any suggestions to make it concise yet appealing? For starter VNs/other recommendations I'd base it off the picture we have on our sub. I'd probably do my own take and take different genres into account, as well as put some of my own personal bias ahemMAJIKOIahem. That said which do you think would be best to make sure to advertise at a panel where most people are going to be anime fans? I don't want to just be a boring advertisement where I just talk about VNs in a monotone/boring voice. I want to be animated/charismatic and assume most people haven't read one before. What kind of topics/stuff should I emphasis talking about or avoid talking about? Any suggestions you'd have to make the panel more interesting for people?   Keep in mind I've literally never done a panel before but since I'm passionate about VNs I've always wanted to do one and hope people get to try them out."
visualnovels,3c7jqn,Catasplurge,4,Sat Jul 11 06:15:36 2015 UTC,"I feel like you should mention that even though a lot of VN's can be 30-50 hours there's no reason for that to be intimidating. I've seen a few people on r/anime say this as the reason they haven't played a VN before. You could say something like ""Even if you could only read it for an hour or even just 30 minutes a day you should try it"" or something to that effect. Just anything mentioning that it doesn't really matter how much you pace yourself as long as you're fine with it and it doesn't really matter if it takes you a month or two to finish one."
visualnovels,3c7jqn,superange128,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:33:14 2015 UTC,Thanks for bringing it up. While I likely will have a mix of shorter and longer ones Ill make sure to talk about longer ones and how they would compare length-wise to certain anime.
visualnovels,3c7jqn,AdelKoenig,3,Sat Jul 11 19:58:44 2015 UTC,"For real though, reading all of Fate/Stay Night is about the same time commitment as watching all of FMA: B."
visualnovels,3c7jqn,falafel_eater,3,Sat Jul 11 18:57:24 2015 UTC,"Especially since a lot of VNs are structured episodically. For one example, Grisaia no Kajitsu's common route is essentially structured as a series of dozens upon dozens of standalone scenes."
visualnovels,3c7jqn,falafel_eater,4,Sat Jul 11 18:35:59 2015 UTC,"Anyone have any suggestions to make it concise yet appealing?   ""Visual Novels: When Books Meet Anime"" or even ""Visual Novels: Anime as Literature"".   That said which do you think would be best to make sure to advertise at a panel where most people are going to be anime fans?   Absolutely play up the anime connection. First of all, some of the most popular anime are related to visual novels (either as direct adaptations, or because they share staff (producers, writers and seiyuu) that anime fans will be familiar with. Without giving spoilers, let them know that they've only seen about half of S;G because the rest is in alternate routes, or in general just say ""But you know, Character X didn't have to do Y at this point"" and play up the nonlinear aspects.    A second point I would play up is that unlike anime, VNs can be as long as they need to be. Romance VNs don't have to end with a confession and you can pick your own best girl. Darker VNs don't have to censor themselves. Sad ""feelz"" VNs will hit harder than a 2-cour anime possibly could. Sci-fi VNs can place its infodump in a built-in encyclopedia so it's unobtrusive but accessible. Ecchi VNs are every bit as complex and engaging as All Ages VNs, and they don't feel like vehicles for selling BDs.  In summary of that second point, I would try to market it as ""anime going further"", in that nobody holds back on the type of content and on how far that content is allowed to go.  Also keep in mind that not every single title you mention has to be appropriate for newcomers. The important thing is to hook their interest -- so you can also talk (for just a few minutes) about titles like SubaHibi, Umineko, CROSS+CHANNEL, and even a few of the untranslated kamige like Dies Irae and Baldr Sky.     I don't want to just be a boring advertisement where I just talk about VNs in a monotone/boring voice. I want to be animated/charismatic and assume most people haven't read one before.   I strongly advise against planning your panel as ""animated"". Instead I recommend rehearsing it, or even giving a couple of pilot panels before the actual event. Hearing a person talk fluently about something they understand and love is, in my opinion, inherently charismatic. Don't be that YouTuber doing Princess Evangile. Rehearsing for a panel is super important, especially if it's your first one. You can also prepare a few short video segments or screenshots, but you shouldn't rely on them to carry the entire panel."
visualnovels,3c7jqn,superange128,2,Sat Jul 11 10:18:30 2015 UTC,Thanks for the excellent long post. I think Ill go with the Anime as Literature one thats a great one (Im bad with brainstorming creative names so thanks for thinking of one)  Best girl (or guy) is definitely one of the factors I wanted to bring up since anime fans complain best girl doesnt win  Talkin about how VNs can go farther than anime is a good idea  I was thinking of bringing up a few of the deeper/non-beginner ones. Umineko in particular was one I wanted to bring up.  Oh yeah when I meant animated I didnt mean I was gonna act like a different person or crack jokes ever few minutes or something. I just want to show that Im passionate and not sound monotone when speaking about VNs. I actually have taken speech classes and its painful when I go to panels when I hear how uninspired/boring/monotone people sound when they present their stuff.  Thanks again
visualnovels,3c7jqn,Bobemmo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:16:09 2015 UTC,"Titles are definitely tough but I think you should make sure your title fits well with the content of your panel.  I went to a VN panel at AN last year and ended up being kinda disappointed.  The presenter was fine, the panel itself seemed pretty well structured, and there was definitely a lot of info in there.  It was by no means bad.  Only problem was, it was really a ""absolute beginners intro to VNs"" which was not really what I was expecting.  All the beginner recommendations he mentioned, I had already read.  All the talk about what a VN is anyways, I had already known.  I guess I just want to say to make sure the way your panel is advertised will attract the type of people your panel is geared towards."

I'm still planning things out but my goal is to appeal to as many as possible.  That's why I want to talk about different genres, VNs that are good for beginners and ones that are good for veterans that have likely read all the really popular ones.   Hell I'll even talk about VN that probably appeal to the girls too (otome or BL/yaoi ones).  Basically my goal is to appeal to as many people as possible. I don't want to alienate people who have only read 0-3 VNs but at the same time I don't want to alienate a veteran who has read at least 10-15 and is looking for something new and interesting."

It gets a bit more difficult during monologue though.   These are the first few lines of Subahibi. Tell me how difficult they seem.   SubaHibi's difficulty isn't in how the things are written (as they're written simply). The difficulty derives more in what the lines say.     If you don't have the confidence to read SubaHibi, you could always start with an easier game (I think that Aiyoku no Eustia is a fantastic game to start with in the sense that it has short line lengths, and simple grammar. If you use a dictionary hook, you won't have that much difficulty understanding the meaning).  Even though SubaHibi's English translation is coming out soon, I'd still suggest reading it in the original Japanese."

Well, using the Rikaikun chrome extension, I could read it. I had a problem with line 25 though.    でもそれは、機械式の時計の様な精密さと美しさを持つものではなく……ただ雑然とした繰り返し。　美しさとはほど遠い。   I guess that if I play it now, I will lose a lot of nuances and subtleties. Maybe it's better to put it off for the time being. I'm downloading Aiyoku no Eustia and I'll try playing it. Thanks for the recommendation. Putting some native material in my studies will make things more interesting. I learned English playing JRPGs and it was so enjoyable. If I can have a similar experience with Japanese, it would be amazing.  I really appreciate all the fan translations that I have played not only of Visual Novels, but also of JRPGs, but playing in the original when possible is really interesting.

visualnovels,3c7jqn,superange128,2,Thu Jul 9 05:43:07 2015 UTC,Not sure if you want line count numbers of what's been TL'd or not but basically..  A different TL group translated everything that the FuwaNovel didn't mention  According to the stats they posted there is only one more route to translate and patch into English. Apparently it's a long route so it will likely take at least a few weeks to finish.  Besides that there are a few routes that require QC (Quality Control). Basically they are going to test/check the translation to make sure it flows well and likely to make sure the game doesn't break or something weird doesn't happen in the English patch.  They are in the home stretch so my guess is it shouldn't take more than a month to finish up at this rate.

However, I'm pretty sure they're are going to only have one full big patch when it's all finished. They'll most likely include a guide to patch the game properly.  The patch will very likely be posted on FuwaNovel's forum site.  That said, someone will definitely post a link to patch download it in this subreddit so you won't have to worry about checking Fuwanovel's forum if you don't want to."

It's definitely a fantastic read though so I hope you manage to acquire a working copy. More people need to read this.  Edit: You could also try seeing if there is a Japanese site to download it from. Here is a link to the google translate version of the purchase page on 07thExpansion's website.

visualnovels,3c7jqn,insanityissexy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:35:47 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the steam version don't even have the original Japanese script in them. You're most likely going to have to find a Japanese version of those vns to hook them.

visualnovels,3c7jqn,Catasplurge,4,Wed Jul 8 09:54:00 2015 UTC,It refers to the stuff that wasn't in the original fan translation.  I'd say 95% of it is probably the edits that were made to make the game not 18+.

visualnovels,3c7jqn,insanityissexy,2,Tue Jul 7 02:42:06 2015 UTC,Around 70 hours for me. It took me 2 days to finish the common route. 1 day for each heroines' routes. Took me about a week and a half to complete the game. also kotori best girl.

I think I finished Rewrite in like a week or two and each of the routes basically took me all the hours I was awake in a day to finish one. Then after that you have two parts of the true route, but one of them is pretty short and the last one is probably as long as any other route, maybe just a little bit shorter."

They seem to have a website wide sale going on and while I do have some of those games, I have some money to burn and feel like actually buying a game or two.   As for what I actually own, Aselia the Eternal, Demonsbane, and Starless. I was looking at the Raidy games since I am kinda interested in getting 3 but the fact that theyre older games and still 20$ is making me question them.   As for what I read and have no interest in simply buying  Saya no uta, school days HQ, cat girl alliance, family project, cosplay fetish academy, princess waltz, Yume Miru Kusuri, Sagara, Hitomi, Horny Bunnies 1/2, Virgin Roster.  As for what I like? Well I like darker themed stuff but I also like moe cause cuuuute. @.@ But I want something worth my money in regards to time. I cant reasonably expect the whole 1$/hour but I refuse to pay 20$ for a 3 hour game either. Eroges/Nukis/Etc, lay it all on me. My wallet wants to buy something."
visualnovels,3c7jqn,demeteloaf,2,Tue Jul 7 02:27:50 2015 UTC,"Seconding all of demeteloaf's recommendations. If you want pure money to time value then go with Yumina. It's an RPG so you'll get a lot of play time out of it. I never got bored either, even after three full routes.  President is great if you want moe with some comedy. Just don't expect anything serious from it. It's a unashamed parody, and a good one at that (at least imo).   Not much to say about S;G other than excellent. Well worth the money."

This was the best explanation I could find for Grisaia.   The word ""grisaia"" is a corruption of the French term used in art, ""grisaille,"" a method of painting in monochrome or near-monochrome, typically to resemble the appearance of marble sculptures. So literally it's meant to be ""the gray-colored fruit"" or something like that."

As for me, surprisingly the most emotional moment comes from Edelweiss, specifically the Haruka route.  Major Edelweiss Spoilers  This next one only half counts, but I recently watched Clannad and Clannad: Afterstory, so I've essentially seen the Nagisa route of the Clannad VN.  That being said, if this counts, it makes Edelweiss seem like a Disney movie for how hard I was crying.  Four separate times I had to stop the video because I couldn't see the subs through my own tears (spoilers).  Of the four, though, the sunflower fields scene takes the cake, by far.  Just glad my parents didn't see me while I was watching, because I was literally clutching a pillow sobbing uncontrollably.  I can't remember anything in the last 10 years of me crying that hard, and I'm not sure if I'll ever experience something on that level of emotionally moving ever again.  To this day, I cannot listen to Dango Daikazoku without crying."

visualnovels,3c5s12,digitalx3r0,3,Sun Jul 5 03:50:09 2015 UTC,"Just skips them completely I think? That's really easy to do with the engine at least, so that's what I imagine they did. I haven't played it in a really long time, though."
visualnovels,3c5s12,Ressha,2,Sun Jul 5 03:56:02 2015 UTC,"So it's probably easy to put it on steam then, this also pretty much confirms an 18+ patch."
visualnovels,3c5s12,TweetPoster,2,Sun Jul 5 04:00:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is listed as an option in the installer. You patch the game into English like normal and then copy over some replacement files manually. Or at least that is what it looks like you have to do based off of my archived version of G-senjou.  And it simply skips over the scenes, they add one or two lines of different dialogue to indicate what is actually happening behind the black-screen, then it fades out and jumps to the next bit."
visualnovels,3c5s12,TweetsInCommentsBot,2,Sun Jul 5 04:04:52 2015 UTC,"I've been searching, and found that it is indeed a separate patch that was available on TLwiki.   Thanks for the info, that's the kind of censorship that should be common for steam releases."
visualnovels,3c5s12,Senku,5,Sun Jul 5 04:09:29 2015 UTC,I'm just pumped that G-Senjou is going to reach an audience who otherwise wouldn't be exposed to visual novels.

It's a very accessible and fun thriller, in the vain of something like Death Note. I think G-Senjou, moreso than other recently ported VNS, could really catch on in the western market."

visualnovels,3c5s12,vhapteR,17,Sun Jul 5 02:17:26 2015 UTC,Another game that's already translated...  Gotta get that easy steam money I guess.
visualnovels,3c5s12,Indekkusu,3,Sun Jul 5 02:17:31 2015 UTC,"I seriously don't understand why everyone's getting upset that already translated games are getting released.  Why would a company go out of their way to translate a game that doesn't have a fan tl? Usually only the very popular games get translated, and it vastly reduces the cost of translation for the publisher.  It's not like Sekai is not translating games either. Clannad is huge, and a lot of it needs to be retranslated, they also release a lot of niche and indie games that haven't been translated before.  Do not expect to see many big releases get translated from Sekai Project for another couple of years. They aren't there yet."
visualnovels,3c5s12,Karakkan,7,Sun Jul 5 02:26:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not in a position to be upset myself, but I can certainly see a few cases in which someone would be upset:   The first position likely has to do with how the fan translators may be treated. As far as I'm concerned, the original team did a good job with the patch. But it's not a matter of ""oh, Sekai Project is going to save money"", but a matter of ""wait, Sekai Project is going to make money off of something that the fan translators did"". And even if the latter wasn't a big deal, would the fan translators be credited at all? I'd wager that TLWiki/Chikan aren't going to be credited in the final English release of G-Senjou no Maou. Compare/contrast how TLWiki set-up a partnership of sorts with MangaGamer for Kara no Shoujo and Nitro+ for quite a few games (apparently). Obviously I'm not privy to the details of the agreements, but if the webpages are anything to go by, the agreements were amicable. There doesn't seem to be any agreements whatsoever between TLWiki and Sekai Project (EDIT: asides from the Grisaia trilogy, which seems to be a special case). The second position is probably those in the minority who purchased the original Japanese games - why should they have to buy the full game again to get the updated English text?"
visualnovels,3c5s12,ShinoAsada0,4,Sun Jul 5 04:50:14 2015 UTC,"For your first concern, we don't really know how that will work out, it's all conjecture. I'm sure the original translators will be credited, and as they are using their translation they likely were paid for it.  As for the second one, how would you like it to work? Should Sekai Project give you a free key? If you are satisfied with the original version then just apply the patch and be done with it. Do you own all the fan translated games that there isn't anything they could release that you wouldn't already own?"
visualnovels,3c5s12,ShinoAsada0,3,Sun Jul 5 05:41:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't know how this business goes but I hope the translators are getting paid for their job.  That being said, I wish they'd pick one of these big visual novels that haven't been translated yet. I'd love to see someone pick Mahoyo or Muramasa, that would definitely be a fantastic choice."
visualnovels,3c5s12,Karakkan,-7,Sun Jul 5 05:50:06 2015 UTC,"The first position likely has to do with how the fan translators may be treated.   Why care about them, they knew what they was doing wasn't legal and from the comments here on /r/visualnovels they should be forced to pay up to the Japanese developers for damages caused by them.   The second position is probably those in the minority who purchased the original Japanese games - why should they have to buy the full game again to get the updated English text?   Because they bought the game knowing there was no English text in it, why should they be forced to release an English patch for an minority who most likely already have read it?"
visualnovels,3c5s12,ShinoAsada0,5,Sun Jul 5 09:36:41 2015 UTC,"Well shit, that came out of left field."

visualnovels,3c5s12,OavatosDK,2,Tue Jul 7 15:34:32 2015 UTC,"SP has a ton of projects and most of them have not used fan translations. Narcissu, Planetarian, Fruit of Grisaia, and G-String.

I'm sure I read it was Moogy himself that said the TL wasn't that good, but who can rate their own work honestly?  I'd be surprised if Sharin's TL was of any lesser quality than G-Senjou, especially considering the majority of the lines in both VNs were written/rewritten by TNA; TNA didn't even like G-Senjou so his heart and soul wasn't as into it as it was with Sharin. Unless myself and Pondrthis made all the difference - I'm not so sure about that.  That said, I've admittedly never read either translation in full other than the chapters of G-Sen I worked on"
visualnovels,3c5s12,Cornetto_Man,2,Sun Jul 5 03:43:12 2015 UTC,"Moogy's opinion on translations should be disregarded in most cases. He is notorious for bashing various translations and frequently it happens not because they are objectively bad/subpar, but rather because he doesn't agree with the style in which they were done. When it comes to the liberal vs literal scale, he is firmly in the liberal camp (or at least it was that way some time ago, not sure if anything has changed lately)."
visualnovels,3c5s12,OhLookAtMeImSpecial,5,Sun Jul 5 19:08:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Sharin would be a much better choice because it has an all-ages version, and the possibility of upgrading the PC version with ps3 assets."

visualnovels,3c5s12,OhLookAtMeImSpecial,6,Sun Jul 5 03:19:30 2015 UTC,That's kind of an opinion.  I liked GSNM much more than Sharin no Kuni.
visualnovels,3c5s12,Cornetto_Man,2,Sun Jul 5 03:47:18 2015 UTC,I found it to be kinda boring and Haru was a bad heroine.
visualnovels,3c5s12,OhLookAtMeImSpecial,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:50:17 2015 UTC,Please explain
visualnovels,3c5s12,veleon_,4,Sun Jul 5 10:14:12 2015 UTC,Not him but G-Senjou is a very poorly put together game. The side routes feel very tacked on. They add nothing to the central narrative and are all around uninteresting. Gonna spoiler tag the rest  More spoilers  As for Haru
visualnovels,3c5s12,bigfatround0,3,Sun Jul 5 14:40:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with some of your points especially the side routes.  Some of the flaws spoilers  as for Haru  I'd say, what makes Haru a great character is that her strengths are clearly shown during all of those action packed chapters but at the same time her weaknesses are exposed multiple times as well, becoming somehow realistic in that contrast. She's also adorable and says some pretty wise words"
visualnovels,3c5s12,Cornetto_Man,2,Sun Jul 5 15:11:29 2015 UTC,Like I said I had no real problems with Haru. The   I'm just not too fond of G-Senjou in general. It certainly has its strengths but the flaws reduced my enjoyment more than they did for others it seems. In that regard I agree with Bfr0 that Sharin no Kuni was a far superior game. Though I'd prefer for G-Senjou to come first so Sharin can get a translation worthy of it.
visualnovels,3c5s12,awxvn,2,Sun Jul 5 16:02:53 2015 UTC,"I also agree, not that he was too intelligent but rather that everybody was completely less intelligent (I mean, don't they have enough intelligence resource in the whole goddamned country?)  PS: I meant to compare Yuuji's experience and training to Maou's not, necessarily their skill set  I loved Sharin no Kuni as well, though maybe why I rank Gsenj higher is because it was more engaging for me (literally couldn't stop myself reading at some points) whereas I enjoyed SnK more for it's wide variety of characters and emotional drama. I'd say they're both from different genres so we can't exactly compare them equally, it depends on the reader's preference more than anything. But I'd definitely won't go as far as calling GSenj ""Boring"" and Haru a ""bad heroine"""
visualnovels,3c5s12,stopreplay,2,Sun Jul 5 16:20:22 2015 UTC,"I think for me the clincher was that Sharin was better in regards to all of my problems with G-Senjou. The side routes and characters were interesting and built upon the world and its characters. The villain was superior on every way. He was intelligent but not ridiculously so, he had clear motives for all of his actions and was a much better foil for the protagonist. And ."

But I agree with you about the villain, more mature, realistic, and downright psychologically brutal"
visualnovels,3c5s12,herkz,3,Sun Jul 5 16:34:48 2015 UTC,"G-Senjou has Jun Fukuyama voicing Maou. He's pretty prolific, and many anime fans will recognize him, and possibly look into buying it because of that"

visualnovels,3c5s12,annnnnnnnnnnnnblat,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:30:14 2015 UTC,I think G-Senjou has a bigger appeal since it's more of a mystery thriller.

You know, for EROge."
visualnovels,3c5s12,MyrMindservant,3,Sun Jul 5 19:37:59 2015 UTC,"I kinda actually already know Japanese and import my games. So taking that ""elitist snob"" approach isn't going to work.  Make no mistake: This is about English-speaking ""casuals"" who just want to buy their game and play it. They're not going to learn another language or go through the process of importing/patching a game or anything. They're going to look what's translated and easily legally available, and be done with it. People who're just going to import games aren't a market, and if they by some miracle were large enough to matter, it might as well be considered part of the domestic market.   So, with that out of the way, what is it that Sekai Project for these people that is ""reprehensible?"" Is it the use of existing patches? Not reprehensible to consumers. Before this, they had either piracy or importation. One of these is way more likely than the other, and neither affect Japanese company's willingness to work with the west. Is it reprehensible to the Japanese companies? lolno, why should they care? Is it reprehensible to the fan translators? Well, if the fan TLs already consented to this, clearly, they don't think so. If anything, they just want to spread their hobby, and this is probably the best way to do so.  Yeah, I'll agree that it is the case that it's not as good as an original TL,  but ""not as good as"" doesn't mean jack shit.  If you think their  business model's going to just start revolving around gobbling up fan TLs as soon as they're finished and taking advantage of ""free labor"" without compensating anyone properly... lel. Betting on fan TLs to finish in a reasonable timeframe and be good enough to go to market is pretty much the worst bet you can make.  Is it their use of Kickstarter? This you could make a much better case for, but Herkz already pointed out: the alternative is no translation at all. Shit costs a lot of money, and making that huge an investment is too huge a risk for anyone in the industry right now. Kickstarter spreads that risk out to a huge pool of backers. It's completely possible that there'll be huge delays or the project will fall on its face or whatever. Kickstarter spreads that risk out so that the worst case scenario is a bunch of people losing a couple hundred dollars they payed for out of their own pocket. You could certainly make the case that the customer should not be adopting any risk at all. That that is what's ""reprehensible.""   Personally, I think both parties are at fault here. Both the producer and the consumer are kinda treating Kickstarter as a ""preorder store.""  I'd love it if there was more emphasis on the part of the producer to make it clear ""this is about the product existing, not about you owning it"" and putting way more detail into possible risks/challenges. But the way Kickstarter is designed means their incentivized to treat it like a store because they know they'll make more money that way.  Likewise, the consumer shouldn't think ""Oh, Clannad for $50."" We'd be better off if everyone though along the lines of ""Which is worse, the chance of me losing $50 and an official Clannad localization not existing, or me keeping the $50, but having the guarantee that an official Clannad localization will not exist."" But I dunno how you'd go about changing that mentality. Stretch goals and the ""gamification of Kickstarter"" only make this stuff more complicated. There's nuance and shit to the whole thing. You can't just unanimously proclaim ""Kickstarter bad."" You can say ""I won't support Kickstarters because I'm uncomfortable with me being treated as a consumer-ish while being forced to adopt risk"" but that's a personal decision. And it has nothing to do with whether Kickstarter is itself a force for good or ill.  Is it their use of Steam as a distribution platform? I've argued this before. And while I personally don't like Steam, I think the answer is ultimately ""no.""  Is it the delays? Uh... That only really happened with WEE. All those boring doujin games they're vomiting up on Steam seem to be releasing mostly on time. Grisaia was released on time, though I guess that's not an original TL, so it doesn't count. :^) Clannad seems to be going on schedule, though, and it is an original TL. Delays are the exception, not the rule for SP. They certainly suffer fewer delays than Jast does.  Is it TL quality?  I... dunno. I haven't read a SP TL, and if they are really terrible, then maybe you're right. What I've seen of Nekopara seems like a joke. The Clannad TL seems like it could be a right mess with how many people they have working on it. If that is the case, then maybe it's okay to support their reuse of fan TLs, but not okay to support their original TLs, or at least until (if) they get better.  Personally, I just think SP is trying to expand as quickly as possible to keep from collapsing under their own weight. Whether that be debt or a shitty market or what, and because of that, they've probably needed to compromise a lot. I mean, SP has Koestl working on Grisaia, so it can't all be uniformly terrible.  But let's accept the premise that SP is garbage quality exploiting free labor and basically just exist as a giant ""VN money funnel."" Wouldn't it then be the case that ""a rising tide lifts all boats"" or whatever? If a Japanese company sees ""holy shit there's a giant VN money funnel in the west,"" wouldn't they be quite more willing to get their stuff localized? In that case, it doesn't have to be SP that does the localization. They could work with one of the companies you ""respect more"" like MG or Jast.  I think you can even already see that happening to some extent. I mean, it's impossible to prove either way, but this year was huge with the Muvluv and Alicesoft deals, and I think that started with the Grisaias and Clannads of yesteryear, which in turn built on Katawa Shoujo or whatever.  So there you go. All this is spreading your hobby and making it more accessible and inclusive. If you think that's a bad thing, I suggest going back to your /jp/ NEET circlejerk thread."

Doesn't change the fact that it exists though, which is the point of the post.  Cool your Sekai Project-hating jets mate.  Regardless of your stance, saying that they have no method of distributing 18+ content is patently wrong and you know it.  If you're going to rag on them, don't base it off of lies.  That's why he's an idiot.  They have a platform for distribution, and you're wrong if you say they don't.  No ands, ifs, or buts about it."
visualnovels,3c5s12,figureour,10,Sun Jul 5 21:22:21 2015 UTC,No value?  Maybe for pirates who don't buy games legitimately. For everyone else having it officially localized is a nice convenience. Calling a localization of a game never officially released in the west greedy is bizarre entitlement.
visualnovels,3c5s12,Docoda,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:07:28 2015 UTC,"Maybe you should stop this piracy bashing? It's really stupid to bring it into this discussion because translation was released as a patch. There are people who have imported Japanese copy to play the game and you claiming that ""not an official release = piracy"" is an insult to them.  Also, if we are talking about piracy, official release doesn't prevent/stop it in any way. If someone wanted to pirate the game, then he can pirate that official release just as easily as he would do with a Japanese copy. And if someone wants to support original developer, then importing the game or buying it from one of the Japanese DL sites/services would be even better choice than getting a localized copy.  I'm not denying that official release would result in more people outside Japan buying the game. But the situation is not as clear-cut as you make it look.  Edit: Nice, in a typical reddit fashion people are downvoting because they have no arguments to counter. It's especially ironical because I'm sure I've imported more VNs than most people here."
visualnovels,3c5s12,ApolloFortyNine,6,Sun Jul 5 02:26:27 2015 UTC,I guess so English speaking fans can support a company that made a game they liked without having to import a copy from Japan.   That money would show Japanese vn companies that there may be a market in the US that is worth pursuing.

Although it's good that the JP developers have taken a personal interest in wanting to localize it, from a personal perspective, I don't think that the game's worth playing, even if it were free.  You could buy this game as an 'investment' (to encourage future releases), but not all investments pan out.   Comparative to recent releases, the game does nothing spectacular. The CG quality's average/somewhat below average (comparative to modern games). The soundtrack is altogether, very forgettable. Moreover, the game's engine is archaic (comparative to even 2010 standards). It's not one of Purple Software's better games.   As mentioned, the game scored a 70 on EGS. As far as EGS goes, that's very low."
visualnovels,3c5uuw,mdzjdz,2,Sun Jul 5 03:30:21 2015 UTC,"What's your opinion on Purple Software as a whole then, if you don't mind my asking?"
visualnovels,3c5uuw,Karakkan,3,Sun Jul 5 03:45:09 2015 UTC,"I don't really have an opinion on the company as a whole. I've only played Chrono Clock fully.   I've done some 'research' (in that I like to know the stats of the works that I potentially read). Chrono Clock's their most recent work. Of their more recent works, Hapymaher was the best received (insofar as receiving a fan disc). Hapymaher maintains a 80 on EGS, which is very good.   Next to Hapymaher, Mirai Nostalgia's the next most-recent, but still 'good' work of their's. This maintains a score similar to Hapymaher on EGS.   Financially, it probably makes more sense to localize Chrono Clock (may as well localize an unpopular game to make more money rather than license an already well-received game). Although on topic of content, it'd make much more sense to localize one of their hits.   The hope for English readers is that if Chrono Clock does well, that the company would be more inclined to offer their 'better works.'  As mentioned though, in comparison, even though CC's newer, it's inferior to its predecessors on level of both production quality and writing."

visualnovels,3c5uuw,foe_to,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:21:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think G-Senjou is being changed much from its fan translation version, so it doesn't need funds. In regards to the others, I think SP is fully aware that people are feeling Kickstarter fatigue and are only using it at this point when they need to fund game development and not just localization."
visualnovels,3c5uuw,sirflimflam,6,Sun Jul 5 03:17:57 2015 UTC,"I read it. There were some snags here or there in the story for me personally, but overall I didn't feel like it was a waste of time. There were definitely some feel good (and bad) moments in there. The fact that the H scenes are separated from the main story as extra content also bodes well for an all-ages release, though the H scenes DO integrate a little bit of future story for the characters so it'd be a shame if that stuff was cut out in the name of an all-ages version.  Frankly, I am just glad we're seeing a really modern release get localized without it being something the fans have already translated for Sekai to pick up and pick at. I started groaning a bit at the G-senjou no Maou announcement, being yet another project based on a pre-existing translation, wondering when they were going to start looking to localize something fresher. This is a good start."

As for the story, my only complaint was that in the end there was still not very much revealed about the nature of avatars. I get that they wanted to keep that element mysterious and that even the 'masterminds' didn't really understand them, but it felt disappointing.  I like how the route structure of visual novels was handled in this game. Depending on minor actions, a situation like random groups of five people suddenly gaining powerful avatars can either lead to pure chaos or to, well, a banal story.  (I've never read anything Hemingway, does anyone know if there any significance to why all the routes are named after Hemingway books?)"

Lastly, kind of a random thought but I think Comyu would be a pretty cool video game, with the avatar fights and all."

On one hand, this game didn't really have the mind blowing twists Ever17 did, and the final route had admittedly slow pacing. On the other hand, this game had a more complex plot than Ever17, was tied together much better, had a much larger scope, solved all its mysteries (and had more mysteries than Ever17 to boot), still had very good twists, had a better cast, and could get just as emotional as Ever17. For now, let's just say that it's tied with Ever17 for my favorite VN."

Just reading one single VN until I'm done can be boring, especially with 50+h long ones. I remember taking longer than half a year for Grisaia, because the ends of the routes were great stops.  Right now I'm reading Sharin no Kuni, Bunny Black, and Steins;Gate at the same time. So far none of them captured me to the extent of putting everything else on hold until I finish it."
visualnovels,3c44i8,FinalNwo,4,Sat Jul 4 16:42:00 2015 UTC,"I tried reading multiple visual novels at some point. Specifically, I was reading Umineko, Steins;Gate and a third novel I can't even remember. Possibly Kira Kira. In the end I put S;G and KK aside and focused on Umineko alone.    My conclusion about reading multiple VNs at once is that I don't think it's worth it. When I get into a visual novel I really get into it, and if the writing is good I don't mind whether things are moving along slowly or quickly. I also like to try and put myself into whatever mental state I believe the VN is trying to put me in, and this is very hard to do when you read more than one novel at a time, because it becomes harder to separate what the novel told you and what you think of the novel as a reader from the outside.    If a novel gets stale, I just leave it alone for a couple of days and then pick it up again. If the novel still isn't interesting to me after that, I will ask around and see whether there's a specific section I need to slog through or whether it's better to just drop the novel altogether."

I'd rather play casual games, but the only one I know for the Vita is Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom.   Aside from that, Persona 4 Golden looks great, but that's it for the most part. I'd love to play Front Mission 3 as well, but can you even get it without a ps3 or ps4? Because afaik, some games require you to have a console to download or something.  On the other hand, there's the 3DS is a lot of casual games like Mario and whatnot, which are probably great when you just want to kill some time. I live in Brazil though and Nintendo has been neglecting us for quite some time. Afaik, the games for 3DS are actually more expensive and you can't even pay for the digital version with your credit card here.  It's pretty hard to choose one. Both handheld devices are overpriced here. The 3DS library is tempting, but buying 3DS games here seems like a pain in the ass and expensive. And the Vita has pretty good graphics, but the library doesn't seem that good. Any advice?"

Don't forget that the Vita's library includes PSP downloads too, so if it came out on PSP you can download it for Vita. (Assuming you don't have the same issues as you do with the 3DS.)"

I definitely changed my tune after that.  Portability still doesn't matter much to me, so handhelds are just another system to play games on; however, they offer a different experience than playing on PC or consoles, which is nice.  I say you should try out at least 999 to start out with - while VLR was a bit of a mixed bag for me, 999 was good.  Even though it's a VN on the DS, it does what it set out to do well; even the atmosphere which I really liked and thought that it was a highlight of the game.  Ace Attorney is another VN series for the DS/3DS that is very good, if you haven't played it."

He has also done phoenix wright and danganronpa if that interest you too.  i dont have any handhelds myself, so i tend to watch games on that platform on youtube, atleast for now. maybe in the future when i have money."

If there really was some kind of advantage in having VNs on PC over handheld, then I guess you would have a point. But as it stands now, there is nothing VN needs to work that Vita or 3DS can't provide. Even more so, thanks to their portable nature, you can treat the game more like a book, which is what VNs really are in the end.   With that said, if you don't have Vita/3DS, getting one just to play 999, VLR (and I guess Phoenix Wright) is I guess not reasonable."

visualnovels,3c184l,mbac1,2,Fri Jul 3 22:10:31 2015 UTC,"I do prefer playing VNs on PC, but the key for me is that good handheld VNs like Ace Attorney or 999 don't try to be Mahoyo.

visualnovels,3c212k,nogaku,20,Sat Jul 4 01:00:52 2015 UTC,"I think science fiction and fantasy would work the best in VN medium since it has the benefit of having basically unlimited length in theory. Instead of info dumping everything within a 20 minute to 40 minute episode, the writer(s) can devote as much time as needed to develop the setting and mechanic of how everything works.   Another genre that I think really works well, but doesn't get too much attention is horror genre, especially denpa. If done well, it could be as scary/disturbing as you see in movies or tv shows but there isn't a whole lot of vns devoted to it unfortunately."

Most others like Higurashi and Innocent Grey's detective VNs are more borderline horror genre that are more mystery than horror. I'd really like a VN with just ghosts or paranormal themes imbued to it, heck, I think jumpscares might even actually work in a VN with a horror genre."
visualnovels,3c212k,8cccc9,2,Sat Jul 4 03:11:55 2015 UTC,"Jumpscares aren't that uncommon in VNs and do actually work.

I can't say much about translated or untranslated horror VNs, but Y;N and The Dreaming are horror VNs you might like.

And don't worry, most people on this sub are somewhat prejudiced against OELVNS, but by now I'm tired of arguing with people about that matter, so whatever.  Y;N primarily feels like an point and click adventure and gives off a certain charm like early titles by Daedalic do; not surprising as it was also made as part of a master thesis.

I believe that one of the greatest advantages of the visual novel medium is that their length is not known. When you read a horror book and you reach page 200/700 and a suspect was just apprehended, you know the story cannot end there. With a VN you have no idea. This can make a surprisingly large difference.    Also things like having 'choices' where the reader can optionally ask a concept to be explained in greater detail is fantastic for Sci-Fi. If the reader has prior knowledge of chaos theory, there's no need to explain everything all over again. If the reader doesn't know, you can put a 2-hour explanation if you want to. Everyone wins.    Visual novels are also fantastic for simulations. Horror/mystery is much more satisfying (and terrifying) when you have to make the choices and you can get them wrong. Especially if mistakes don't immediately lead into a Bad End. VNs can enable the reader to be very involved in what's going on. For instance, Comyu has some online segments where a character is posting on a message board -- and this is complete with working, clickable links to images. It's possible to take this even further and actually let the reader interact with a ""computer system"" within the novel and affect the world that way.    Another option that I have yet to see done properly is to allow the reader of the VN to be their own entity ""inside"" a visual novel, so they can make some choices outside the context of the main character.    It's really an incredibly powerful medium. It's only limited by how expensive it is to write stories with a very large amount of plot branches (think 50 possible routes) of consistent quality, and fortunately it's not a barrier that absolutely can never be overcome.      tl;dr the best genre in the VN medium is whatever genre manages to best utilize the unique options offered by the VN being software. Survival horror is a particularly strong candidate, but it mainly depends on the individual novel."

The pictures used can gain a grasp of the nature of the fantasy world and its fantasy flora and fauna without resorting to ""it's kinda like a (blank) but with (blank)"" being ever used, as you can show, not tell, and get onto the plot of the story more quickly and expediently, and spend the bulk of the writing effort on character growth and interaction, which many fantasy series will lose over world-building, which is now a shared burden among more options.

You can use writing to create mystery/suspense, but combine it with visuals, music (or, in some cases, no music - or just eerie SFX), and user interactivity, it could create something very immersive.  Maybe VNs might have the advantage over books in terms of horror, given in VNs you can also use the music/SFX/images combination to create jumpscares, and user interactivity might make the player feel more personally involved in the story, and hence more troubled if bad things happen to their character.  I don't think I've played a VN with jumpscares before, but when I played Yandere one particular ending did make feel physically sick - even more so than reading American Pyscho did haha... - though that is more gore/splatter horror than suspense horror... I also didn't think Yandere was a particularly good VN, but I guess it shows how affecting horror in VNs can be..."

The only genre that I think is weak in visual novels is battle shounens or anything with lots of fights in it as static sprites and pictures aren't really benefitial to something that naturally has a lot of movement.   Otherwise it really doesn't matter. Most visual novels are constructed with similar elements so it's hard to say for sure. But pretty much anything that is a book, could be turned into a visual novel theoretically. So yeah any genre that works for them, works for visual novels."
visualnovels,3c212k,funwithgravity,7,Sat Jul 4 02:29:01 2015 UTC,"Even VNs with battles have a leg up on books. When you're watching a full-motion fight sequence the images might not live up to your imagination as a book reader, as many book-to-movie adaptations have shown. In a book, it's incredibly difficult to write fight sequences that faithfully project the imagination of the writer into the understanding of the reader in an exciting and detailed way. In a VN, you can give the reader the layout of the fight, emphasize the decisive points of a battle, and allow the reader to make the sequence as exhilarating as they can picture. (I'm using Fate/Stay Night Realta Nua as a reference here.)  You're absolutely correct. Visual novels can and have been used to great effect in a wide variety of genres. The way to identify either a good VN or a good book is largely the same: good writing."
visualnovels,3c212k,hyperknees91,5,Sat Jul 4 02:58:30 2015 UTC,Book-to-movie adaptions usually suffer because they lack the build up that books have due to the limited time. So that already hurts the fight scenes. Also sometimes the movie director simply doesn't know how to direct them well or in a compelling fashion.   I am not saying a fight scene written in a book or visual novel will always be weaker then its movie/tv/anime counterpart. However I will say they will always be weaker then the best the opposing medium has to offer. Which probably will also never be as good as the best fights video games has to offer.   It's kind of just layers of immersion. a well written fight your told about is not as strong as a well directed fight your shown. A well directed fight is not as strong as a well done fight in a video game because you actually have control so you immersion is the highest it can be. Obviously a well written fight is better than a poorly directed fight as well as a poorly structured game fight though.   That's just my mind set.
visualnovels,3c212k,Basileus777,5,Sat Jul 4 05:13:51 2015 UTC,"anything with lots of fights   Dies irae or anything Masada has written says hi. I guarantee you if you read those, you wouldn't be say that."

visualnovels,3c212k,ScarsUnseen,2,Sat Jul 4 05:15:28 2015 UTC,"Prose alone can portray fights well, so any failures there aren't really limitations of the medium."
visualnovels,3c212k,hyperknees91,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:53:54 2015 UTC,"Fights aren't portrayed in necessarily a weak fashion, but it's more about the build up then the actual fighting. Even with fancy prose I've never found fancy prose ever as exhilerating as a well directed fight."
visualnovels,3c212k,ScarsUnseen,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:04:22 2015 UTC,But other people do.  I think what some people are trying to get across as that it isn't the medium's fault if you don't enjoy narrative battles.  VNs aren't weak in that area because you don't like them.
visualnovels,3c212k,hyperknees91,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:29:35 2015 UTC,"But they are just weaker then what the opposing mediums have to offer. It's like horror really. It can be conveyed well in books, but it's better conveyed in video games due to the connection between the player character.   Books and Visual Novels are better at having more developed plots/characters and what not though due to not having time limitations and the benefit of having a seemless narration."
visualnovels,3c212k,Basileus777,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:57:31 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily true.  For one, the effectiveness of narrated action is limited by the skill of the author as well as the imagination of the reader, but the flip side of that is that the effectiveness is only limited by the skill of the author, and can actually be enhanced by an imaginative reader.  In animated and live action media, you are limited by your choreographer.  You are limited by the skill of the artist(in animation) or the abilities of the actors/stunt actors(live action).  You are limited by budget(words cost a lot less than animation frames and action takes).    And each medium has its trade-offs.  Live action offers more precise choreography(but also invites closer scrutiny of the same), while animation offers more epic scale and stylized interaction(yes, I know you can make animated action as detailed and precise as live action, but almost no one can actually afford to make stuff like that).    The other advantage of literature and related multimedia(including visual novels and manga here) is that you can get into the mindset of the actors, something that animated and live action media are utterly unable to do without sacrificing the advantages they would otherwise possess(I love the Rurouni Kenshin manga, but the anime's battles are slooooow).  In a book, visual novel, or manga, taking a paragraph or even a page to analyze an opponent's movements is perfectly fine.  In an anime or movie, taking a similar amount of text's worth of monologue is going to nearly unforgivably slow down the action.  And let's not forget that visual novels are a visual medium as well as a literary one.  While old school and budget visual novels are pretty much just sprites on a background or simple art slideshows, that is not necessarily true of all visual novels anymore.  Just as a truly high budget animation can show off action scenes with higher fidelity than your typical battle shounen, so too can an increased art budget and more advanced technique result in a lot more compelling ""visual"" in your visual novel.  Just look at Mahoutsukai no Yoru, Type-Moon's recent VN.  The visuals in that one are absolutely stunning.  So what I'm getting at is that every medium has its advantages, and literature's biggest advantage is that with a skilled writer and an imaginative reader, there's very little that can truly surpass it.  Even in action scenes."
visualnovels,3c212k,SurturSorrow,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:56:33 2015 UTC,"Every single medium can be enhanced by the imagination of the viewer. That isn't something limited to text, it's just something that needs to be relied on more than others. Take something like Lain, a very imaginative show. I don't think conveying the same story via text would have changed much on this front. Also take a horror game like Silent Hill 2. Most of the horror is done via the mind of the player rather than actually being conveyed on screen.   Like I said character development/mindset is a strength in the medium. Battles don't have to analyze the opponents actions because a good director can just imply what they are thinking via facial expressions or even subtle gestures (which like said earlier, allows you to use your imagination to fill in the gaps). The Rurouni Kenshin anime fights are nowhere near as intense as the ova fights because the directing isn't as good (like said shoddy directing won't benefit anyone). It's still possible to have good analytical fights (Hunter x Hunter) because the voice actors can bring the level of analysis to life.   Mahoutsukai no Yoru has good, vibrant directing in its approach which makes it far more appealing than most visual novels. This is why I think presentation is important. Granted none of the fights are that impressive still compared to a fully animated fight but it's certainly better than the norm.   I do understand that every medium has their advantages. To me the advantage of literature is that they can handle build up to fights a bit better, which is what makes them more satisfying. However I'm not convinced the actual ""fighting"" is ever that interesting or thrilling compared to their opposing mediums."

It's enjoyable and pretty badass. Might be one of the highlights. Okusama ga Seitokaichou! - Watched the first episode. Was fun. Some Ecchi is never wrong, though the episodes are short (8m~), but that means it doesn't waste much time if it turns out to be bad. Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou - Read the manga, it's funny. I hope the show doesn't fail in delivering the jokes, but I have high hopes for it. Also, Monster Girls are life. Might be another highlight if it's adapted well. Overlord - I like the setting. Other than that, I'll let the studio surprise me. Prison School - Haven't read the manga, but it is one of the more hyped shows this season, so I'll watch it. God Eater - Ufotable. Aoharu x Kikanjuu - Don't know what to expect from it, but I enjoyed the trailer. Chaos Dragon: Sekiryuu Seneki - Another promising title, but I don't have high expectations for it.

Also MC has the same VA as FSN's Archer lol Chaos Dragon - Honestly wasn't too interested in this until I read this:    Chaos Dragon is based on the role-playing fiction project Red Dragon, a story which was created by five notable character designers: Gen Urobochi (Fate/Zero), Kinoko Nasu (Kara no Kyoukai), Iduki Kougyoku (Mimizuku to Yoru no Ou), Ryohgo Narita (Durarara!!), and Simadoriru (member of the Stripe Pattern doujin circle). The results of their tabletop role-playing game sessions over six days created material for a seven-volume light novel series.   That piqued my interest.    Classroom Crisis - Not sure what to expect from this one.  Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan - as above though I honestly don't have too high hopes. Seems pretty generic but I'm hoping it'll surprise me. Monster Musume - Suu best girl, 'nuff said Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace - The horror tag brought me in. Hopefully it'll be good. Not enough good horror anime Rokka no Yuusha - Seems mysterious. Could surprise me (or could be shit) Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai - Could be funny if done right. Or could be trash, will wait and see To Love-Ru Darkness 2nd - ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Charlotte - No Key magix pls. Danchigai - Imoutos everywhere.  Gakkou Gurashi! - A moe horror SoL? Will either be amazing or terrible (please be good) God Eater - Ufo-tan plz Himouto! Umaru-chan - Could be a good gag-comedy  Prison School - Loved the first half of the manga. Hopefully the adaptation will do it justice    I think I have a problem D:"

visualnovels,3c0lo5,OavatosDK,2,Fri Jul 3 21:45:29 2015 UTC,GATE was boring.   It was everything I hoped it would be. The worst otaku pandering I've seen in years (which is amazing considering no female characters have even appeared yet.)
visualnovels,3c0lo5,Cornetto_Man,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:10:13 2015 UTC,There was nothing pandery about what happened so far at all other than the OP. The closest thing was the guy being excited about comiket. I'm not sure where you get the idea anything we saw was pandering (especially to some extreme level).
visualnovels,3c0lo5,OavatosDK,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:21:33 2015 UTC,The whole thing was clear otaku pandering. It was the worst kind of power trip fantasy. The otaku saves the day while all the others could do nothing. Then all the JSDF supremacy feeling permeating the episode. It's quite clearly trying to appeal to Japanese nationalism in the same way American Sniper did it for America. For the record I don't think it necessarily reduces the quality of the work. I enjoyed American Sniper but it was still pretty blatant.
visualnovels,3c0lo5,Cornetto_Man,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:48:14 2015 UTC,"I know the source material (and manga) are known for that nationalistic attitude, but nothing so far was super pro militarism or pro Japan. I'm sure it will get that way soon enough, but nothing that happened yet met the specifications yet. Which is actually kind of disappointing since I wanted to watch it be that kind of shitshow but instead the most mentally offensive thing was the gay joke.  Which really leaves the otaku is a hero, but I can sort of buy an off-duty soldier being more competent than the average police officer trying to lead an evacuation.   If the guy was a regular otaku I would agree more, but as it is I think it's only edging the border of power fantasy by saying ""look this cool soldier guy is an otaku too"". Still far from the worst kind of pandering or even being extreme pandering.   Oh and I don't really care about what someone labels the quality of the work don't worry. If this thing even came close to the word good for me I would consider it a pleasant surprise."

I was specifically referring to the point later in the episode when the other JSDF guy talks about he couldn't do anything.  While nothing obvious happened yet I felt like the episode in general felt very nationalistic. The JSDF were portrayed as far more powerful than they actually probably are. I mean within minutes tanks arrived on site.   All that being said I enjoyed it. It should be pretty entertaining especially if they crank all the nationalism up to what its reputation says."

The game feels kind of surreal, and uncomfortable sometimes, and it is a really cool experience. And it's hilarious, which is something I feel a lot of recent games are missing. Besides Earthbound, I finished Kirby Triple Deluxe, which was a solid platformer but far too easy, and I'm working on Xenoblade, but the going is slow, I'm 30 hours in and it doesn't feel like I've got anywhere, but it's very good. The battle system is unique and engaging, the story is enough to keep me interested, and the graphics are pretty impressive considering what it's running on. The English dub is very good too, something I usually don't say. I've been playing a lot of Melee as well, as I started hosting a weekly tournament with a friend and going to the other weekly in the city.

It's been pretty fun but I've been having a lot of trouble on Yukiko's Castle. I've died about 4 times because of the damn kings summoning those plant monsters.   I also bought Atelier Ayesha and Logy and Escha. I've been wanting to get into the Atelier series for a while now. Are these any fun?
visualnovels,3c0lo5,bigfatround0,2,Fri Jul 3 21:24:52 2015 UTC,It might be worth grinding a bit on your first playthrough in Yukiko's Castle. It can be a bit tough first time around depending on your difficulty. What Persona are you using?  It was so much harder in the PS2 version. I never got past the fourth boss when I played that version. Golden made it a little easier.  I can't speak for Ayesha & Logy and Escha but the Arland Trilogy were pretty great.

In fact against some of the toughest NG+ bosses you actually need 3-4 high level personae to use in the single fight. For the story though usually one Persona at a time is enough. It's worth experimenting a bit to find one that works for you and the team you're using.   There's a time limit? How long is the overall playtime?

But you don't really have to worry about that at all. I finished it twice and only ever used one persona in battles.    I like it when there's a time limit. It makes the game feel more realistic and challenging.    Then you would probably like the Arland games. The first one (Rorona) involved a number of ""main quests"" which had a time limit. Except you could complete that quest before the limit and then use your remaining time for anything else you wanted to do (side quests, exploring, grinding, gathering, synthesising etc). The second game (Totori) was structured slightly differently with adventuring given more emphasis. You had an adventure rank that you had to level up before deadlines or you'd get a bad end."

visualnovels,3bykx2,herkz,2,Fri Jul 3 06:35:17 2015 UTC,Free Friends is out and FF2 and KnS2 will both probably be out this year. MG has made IG's titles a priority and IG risking that relationship seems like such a bad idea.
visualnovels,3bykx2,figureour,5,Fri Jul 3 23:53:09 2015 UTC,"Hoping this doesn't spill any bad blood between the two companies. If Mangagamer staff was unaware, this probably meant that they had no plans to announce the FLOWERS anytime soon. If the Fall release stays with a nice special edition on the way, I think this is truly a win for those who wanted to see this title sooner. Glad to hear that all four parts are being released as well."
visualnovels,3bykx2,CommonHorse,10,Fri Jul 3 08:00:54 2015 UTC,JAST    sooner   hehehe
visualnovels,3bykx2,EnglishInfix,4,Fri Jul 3 08:38:50 2015 UTC,JAST care about Flowers so much that they copied the official synopsis on flowersgame.com from VNDB...
visualnovels,3bykx2,riruru,3,Fri Jul 3 17:44:45 2015 UTC,That's great but now I'm worried the game will have to deal with the usual JAST delays. I wonder how JAST got it instead of MG.  EDIT: Fall 2015 according to the site. I hope JAST actually sticks to the release schedule on this one.
visualnovels,3bykx2,NRidley,12,Fri Jul 3 05:45:24 2015 UTC,I'm guessing they actually asked.
visualnovels,3bykx2,herkz,2,Fri Jul 3 05:49:17 2015 UTC,That makes sense. I made a terrible assumption assuming that MG would get it with their prior history with Innocent Grey. My bad.
visualnovels,3bykx2,NRidley,7,Fri Jul 3 05:52:46 2015 UTC,"No, that's not a bad assumption. Even I thought they'd already worked something out with IG considering how much they talk about it, but I guess there was nothing formal."
visualnovels,3bykx2,herkz,5,Fri Jul 3 05:57:45 2015 UTC,"I was really hoping for a Flowers announcement at AX or Otakon, but I never suspected JAST. The website says it's coming out fall this year. Would be awesome if true. But it's JAST, so well... I'll believe it when I see it.  I do like having physical copies, and JAST always seems to offer them, so at least there's that."

I hope JAST publish it on steam if possible, because it's very hard and need roundabout way if I want to buy things straight from their store."

visualnovels,3bykx2,figureour,4,Fri Jul 3 23:24:37 2015 UTC,Nice.
visualnovels,3bykx2,bigfatround0,3,Fri Jul 3 06:06:39 2015 UTC,"I don't really get why you were being downvoted - unless JAST's translation quality is noticeably worse, from consumer standpoint there's absolutely no difference who got it. Hell, if anything, it will be a nice lesson for MG to get the rights faster or at least not to make any plans before getting the rights. Glory to the competition.  Yep, there is ""Jast is so bloody slow"" argument, but frankly, I look at Higurashi retranslation progress every week and can't really say that MG is that much faster."
visualnovels,3bykx2,Ewig_Custos,5,Fri Jul 3 11:42:19 2015 UTC,JAST has a long and storied history of delays and problems that goes well beyond anything happening with Higurashi.  JAST is still trying to claw itself out of the hole they've dug themselves into with all of these announced projects that have been in limbo or editing hell for years.
visualnovels,3bykx2,Basileus777,2,Fri Jul 3 12:12:05 2015 UTC,How long was Hanachirasu stuck in pre-order limbo again?
visualnovels,3bykx2,Taedirk,7,Fri Jul 3 12:37:25 2015 UTC,"It's been up for preorder since 2011. In March 2015, it was finally released.   I doubt they'll take anywhere near that long with Flowers since they seem to want to get it out and on Steam soon. But I do foresee delays. Hanachirasu was delayed at the last minute from a February release to a March release, for instance. I think Little Witch Romanesque was also delayed? Seems to happen a lot."
visualnovels,3bykx2,rainmusique,3,Fri Jul 3 16:01:33 2015 UTC,MG is pretty transparent about their projects and tries to keep its audience informed about any problems (that they can publicly discuss). Everything I've seen from JAST has been the exact opposite.

To make a good anime they would need 20~~ episodes for Muv Luv and even more than 20 for Alternative, which is impossible? So we can either get 12+12 eps which would ekhm... butcher the story or Kimi ga Nozomu translation which is way cheaper and easier to do :| We'll see I'd like to see anime properly made, but it would cost too much...  If Anime would win and we'll get properly adapted content within 50~~ episodes, head down if it'll happen.  Still, options in the poll as stretch goals like: better CGs/sprites, added routes, expanded epilogue, more cinematics sounds REALLY good.  Well, now give me 1080p Muv-Luv :D"
visualnovels,3byo3z,Maxelek,6,Fri Jul 3 08:15:04 2015 UTC,"It really saddens me that there isn't more love for Kimi ga Nozomu Eien. Ever since I heard about it I've been dying to read it. Even keept away from the anime to avoid spoilers. Maybe it's because people link it with Muv-Luv Extra? That said, if Muv-Luv becomes sufficiently successful  I find it likely that it'll eventually get released, now that there's an official company working on the translation."
visualnovels,3byo3z,Velast,0,Fri Jul 3 08:23:39 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the excitement for it. Rumbling Hearts was the anime adaptation, right? I had to force myself to sit through that mess. It's the only show I ever watched that I felt angry at myself for watching."

visualnovels,3byo3z,vhapteR,5,Fri Jul 3 14:01:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is pretty tricky. Most people would love to see a superb anime adaptation because of how much potential the story has. However, a mediocre adaptation would most likely be worse than no adaptation. Deen's Fate/Stay Night is a prime example of that.  Unless they clear things up, people won't know which one to choose. There's a huge difference between getting a high quality anime adaptation and getting a poor one. I wouldn't even need to think to pick Rumbling Hearts over a mediocre Muv-Luv anime, just like I'd vote for the anime in a heartbeat if they said it was going to be a top-notch adaptation."

visualnovels,3byo3z,l3illyl3ob,9,Fri Jul 3 07:12:46 2015 UTC,Seriously. This series has a very strong reputation for a reason. Fundamentally altering the story structure like that seems like it has way more room for it to go wrong than to go right.

It has over 300 pages of setting material with descriptions of anti-BETA tactics, TSF design (both ""this is how we designed them"" and ""this is the fictional history of TSF design""), a lot of short stories, histories of various nations in the setting, tons of artwork including a nice two-sided pullout poster with Kou Yoshinari artwork on one side, some interviews, and so forth. Almost none of it has been translated into English and it all looks really interesting. I would throw hundreds of dollars at the Kickstarter if it meant getting a translated copy somehow, even if that would be a completely ridiculous amount of content to translate and publish."

visualnovels,3byo3z,jonjonaug,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:10:06 2015 UTC,"Muv Luv is long enough as it is without full voice Takeru, and I kind of like the concept of ""voiced protagonist, but only in flashback scenes, or scenes not directly from his perspective"". The later releases of Alternative upgrade this to ""and also big emotional scenes"" and I'm not sure if I like that, since it kinda spoils the style the original release was going for with that."
visualnovels,3byo3z,awxvn,3,Fri Jul 3 07:17:42 2015 UTC,What's the reason for the MC being silent in most visual novels? Is it so the player can self-insert more easily? It seems kind of silly in a game focused on action scenes and emotional moments.

visualnovels,3byo3z,vhapteR,3,Fri Jul 3 08:25:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I find it hard to believe Age wouldn't make an effort to release a good MLA adaptation if they finally decided to go for it.

visualnovels,3byo3z,herkz,3,Fri Jul 3 08:39:47 2015 UTC,"Oh my, what a dillema. A Muvluv/MLA anime adaptation could be fantastic if properly directed! But it could also be a catastrophe.   I feel an OVA for Extra + Unlimited and then a MLA series could be a great approach. To be honest, I don't know why they haven't done that already, given how popular MLA is. But unless they're willing to put a lot of money into this adaptation and make something stellar, it could very easily turn into a trainwreck, which I'd rather not see."
visualnovels,3byo3z,helrouis,10,Fri Jul 3 06:44:26 2015 UTC,"Um, an anime would cost a shitload. Like millions of dollars. I don't even know why it's an option."

I'm stressing the word quality here because honestly I'd rather not see a mediocre adaptation. A English version of Rumbling Hearts would be far better than that. An anime adaptation would have to be fantastic, otherwise people would forever mock it like Deen's Fate/Stay Night adaptations.   Now, I wouldn't be surprised if Age announced a big project like this. But as a kickstarter goal? That seems really far-fetched.   What I mean is, I find it very hard to believe a visual novel kickstarter could be enough for a half-decent adaptation, let alone a top-notch one. So unless the main goal here is for Age to know if they should invest their money in an anime adaptation, I don't see that happening.  I think everyone would love to hear more details about a possible anime adaptation."
visualnovels,3byo3z,vhapteR,11,Fri Jul 3 08:08:45 2015 UTC,"It's a goal I wouldn't personally go for as someone who did a crowdfunding campaign myself and made it successful(by luck and massive help from others), but they're Age, and they've already done an anime too. The Kickstarter will just fund it partially more or less coming from the excess funds, which will significantly help the anime come true if helped by more sponsors/companies. I'll be adamant about the quality and will continuously ask for more details on how they'll go with it. I don't want the anime to fail portraying the important moments in the VN."
visualnovels,3byo3z,helrouis,2,Fri Jul 3 08:35:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you for helping clear things up!   The fact that we'll be helping fund the project with the aid of sponsors and other companies (if that actually happens) sounds much more realistic.   I don't understand why money would be that much of a problem for Age, given the fact that they've already adapted other visual novels. But assuming this idea has been brought up in the discussions and Age is aware of it, the fact that this is even being considered is awesome.    I'll be adamant about the quality and will continuously ask for more details on how they'll go with it. I don't want the anime to fail portraying the important moments in the VN.

visualnovels,3byo3z,herkz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:34:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's kind of weird for an anime adaptation to be a goal, even if it's an ""ambitious"" one. Perhaps it's not part of the kickstarter (not sure why it would be there in the first place though)? This wouldn't be a problem if they were a little clearer.  One thing is for certain, it wouldn't be the first time Age adapted one of their visual novels. So making a top-notch anime adaptation could be a very good move now that a company wants to release the visual novel in the west.  But yeah, the way things are now, there's no way to know what they mean by that. Maybe a low quality OVA of sorts? If that's what they're going for, they might as well translate Rumbling Hearts and leave it at that instead."
visualnovels,3byo3z,DontJudgeMeMonkey,2,Fri Jul 3 07:45:26 2015 UTC,I definitely would love to see an anime of it. But this Kickstarter is definitely not the way it's going to get funded.
visualnovels,3byo3z,Koush,2,Fri Jul 3 07:52:37 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. If it's going to be an anime, I want the people who watch it (who haven't read the VN) to experience virtually the same thing as I did. Anything less than that will only disappoint me. I know that asks for a lot, but if it can't be done, I would prefer people to just stick to the VN."
visualnovels,3byo3z,Koush,3,Fri Jul 3 07:07:51 2015 UTC,"Why would anyone even want a Muv Luv anime? Not only would it require obscene amounts of money for just the chance of being anything good, VN's are clearly a superior medium of storytelling."
visualnovels,3byo3z,anonynamja,4,Fri Jul 3 10:08:47 2015 UTC,"Anime has a much wider audience than VN's does, I wouldn't have much trouble convincing several of my friends to watch an anime, but I would never be able to convince them to read a VN. There's also the time requirement, it's not much trouble sitting down and watching a few epsiodes now and then, but that's much harder to do with a VN.  While I agree that VN's are better at telling a story, it's also a much bigger time investment and examples like Clannad: After Story and Steins;Gate are great examples of animes that are very much worth your time, even if you already have read the novel."
visualnovels,3byo3z,Koush,5,Fri Jul 3 11:02:11 2015 UTC,"Anime has a much larger audience mostly because you don't need to engage to consume it. Muv Luv is a bit too complex in everything for it to succeed as an Anime.  Look as Clannad, it's scope is extremely small and doesn't exactly stray to far from the anime format, it focuses on one small thing to a good level. Look at Steins;Gate, it starts out really good because it just has to adapt something small, a bunch of people talking and it goes into it's twists from episode 1, as soon as it deals more with the things that are unique to the VN, it falls apart and crashes on it's face and never recovers.   It's funny too because they were calling Steins;Gate slow at the start, imagine Extra. It'll get poor viewership with equally matching BD/DVD sales and before it even gets to Alternative the funding will be cut, should they even get there. The only reason Muv Luv works the way it doesn't is because it's uninterrupted, everything is in front of you, you read or you don't. Look at Umineko, that didn't work at all as an Anime and it's not even as bizzare as Muv Luv. Takeru himself is a character that is meant to represent the players way of thinking, he's full of introspection and misleading the viewer, he wouldn't NEARLY be as good if he was a watchable character.   I've had like 8 friends read Alternative and 2 that failed, the two that failed pretty much just didn't want to put in the effort and are much more likely to consume something with the actually required thought to fully digest something. Don't pander to them by making it more digestible when it's current iteration is so fantastic, just keep trying to make them experience something they've never experienced before."

visualnovels,3byo3z,Fuwante0,6,Fri Jul 3 06:58:06 2015 UTC,"This actually already exists a little. Some scenes in Unlimited are affected by who's route you did last in Extra before starting the current playthrough. The only way to get scenes foreshadowing the coup d'etat in Alternative, along with 100% CG completion due to one CG being in the relevant scenes, is to start Unlimited after completing Ayamine's route in Extra.  As for ""doing route in Unlimited having consequences in Alternative"", from what I remember this was a planned feature in the original version of Alternative, but it didn't work correctly. Depending on the routes you cleared in Unlimited, certain minor things change (the H scenes that pop up in the middle of the story, for example). To my understanding, Amaterasu's hack to allow Alternative to work in English also activates all of these scenes, and the feature works correctly in future versions of the game (which is what we're getting)."

visualnovels,3bxhog,LTearz,13,Thu Jul 2 23:33:04 2015 UTC,I don’t know about best but I can tell you which ones I like the most.   Yuuji and Yumiko from Grisaia - I mainly like this romance because you get to see their romance bloom at various stages of their life. Grisaia. I just like that type of continuation and Yumiko initiates the romance in the best way. Kenichi and Natsumi from Sharin no Kuni – For this romance I like the idea of SnK Ryou and Sion from eden* -  Heartwarming romance. eden* Arc and Shiki from Tsukihime - Great banter and some excellent chemistry together. What more is there to say?
visualnovels,3bxhog,Shotgun_Diplomacy,7,Fri Jul 3 02:51:26 2015 UTC,This doesn't really relate but I just finished SnK and I need to say thisSnK
visualnovels,3bxhog,TheBlacklist3r,2,Fri Jul 3 06:00:59 2015 UTC,Arc and Shiki from Tsukihime - Great banter and some excellent chemistry together. What more is there to say?   Really? I think Arc is an excellent girl but their arc didn't really have enough conflict for me. I like Arc more in Ciel's route than her own. Akiha x Shiki is IMO the best love story in there... tragedy and all.

Like seriously, all of her h-scenes are so damn good. It's extremely hard for an h-scene to feel genuine and be in good taste, but still be fap material because chances are, if it feels natural, the h-scene is going to be anti-climatic and boring as hell. It actually goes both ways. If the scene makes for good fap material, it tends to have no depth. I'm not sure if depth is the word I'm looking for, but yeah.   Fortunately and surprisingly, Yumiko's h-scenes managed to have the best of both worlds. From the h-scenes, you could really tell that they loved each other, but you were still able to get off to it."
visualnovels,3bxhog,HonestRage,7,Fri Jul 3 00:32:43 2015 UTC,"This is the oddest explanation I've heard to why a romance route was better than the other. Not gonna say your opinion is wrong, but yeah, maybe I missed out on some game-breaking dialigue when I scrolled past the h-scenes. I've more or less reached the conclusions that h-scenes rarely bring character development so I always speed through them."
visualnovels,3bxhog,GregerMoek,9,Fri Jul 3 02:58:10 2015 UTC,"Well, my reasoning, for why I feel Yumiko's route was the best in the romance department, isn't just limited to the h-scenes. I do feel that Yumiko and Yuuji's relationship felt the most genuine. I just used h-scenes as my reasoning in my previous comment because there are many relationships that are absolutely wonderful, but have extremely lackluster h-scenes. However, if a route is able to make a relationship genuine until the very end, which means having the h-scenes give you the same natural feeling, it's doing something phenomenal and that's what I felt Yumiko's route did."

She was just dull and a boring sick girl troupe.  The After Story was much more interesting when she was out of it and it actually developed Tomoya and his other relationships.  Though picking a Clannad romance I'd go with Tomoyo. Though Kotomi needed him more it wasn't quite as fulfilling. There just seemed great chemistry with Tomoyo. Kyou would be up there if her story focused less on her sister.  Other favorite would be Komomo from Hoshizora.  Then of course Majikoi has a lot of good ones. Chris doesn't seem to get mentioned much, but their relationship seemed natural with good chemistry. While in S! Tsubame and Yamato seemed to grow together."
visualnovels,3bxhog,bonerjohnson,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:29:17 2015 UTC,Yeah i think it is important to really separate the anime and the VN on Clannad. Judging Nagisa purely from either side and then saying she is best in both materials is pretty weird.

However I would say I like romance a lot more when it's not the front center focus the whole story. Not that those are bad, but I seem to appreciate it a lot more when the romance compliments the story and characters and it's not what holds it all together. Their ending route gave me feels like no tomorrow.   2nd favorite is of course Battler and Beatrice from Umineko for similar reasons spoiler   If neither of those count because you mean a charage route or just an individual route from a nonlinear game...then I would probably go with the same pairing you mentioned for similar reasons. I know people find em boring and it's kind of funny I like em a lot despite my two favorite romances coming from much more dynamic pairings. But there's just something special beneath the surface with them and combined with the relationship they have with Akio and Sanae it truly makes them unforgettable to me personally."

Maybe it doesn't have the romance many other stories have, but I have never experienced any fiction where the characters have such incredibly unbreakable emotional bonds. Each character has a deep, driving, compelling passion that moves their personal story forward in a structure where every relationship and expenditure of time is unfathomably precious. The entire story is built on the will to fight for what you care about most in the world. Finally, the main romance is flawed, as many will be willing to point out, but damn if it isn't the emotional core in an ocean of emotions."

Kana ~imouto~ is a strong contender there. You get a strong character growth on the one side from the outset, and zero on the other, because zero growth IS their character, they're stagnant, and that's awful, and changing it up becomes the desire of not only your character but you as well. You're not playing some fantastical Rance-like lord, you're just a guy trying to make his sister smile.

Before you disagree hear me out. She -was- well portrayed in the Fate and the HF routes, and stayed consistent with her character traits. She's someone who takes charge in almost every situation and she is usually well informed about most subjects regarding magic and combat, she always has a plan. She is also pretty talented and clever at times. She has flaws too, her temper is one of them, and not being able to show her feelings without trying to hide them behind some kind of pride curtain. She's struggling to decide if she wants to be a proper ""mage"" or just a normal person and human being with magical powers.  So why do I think the VN didn't do her justice? Her own route, UBW, where she goes from overpowered mentor/ally to pretty much a useless sidekick. In a way I don't even think UBW is her route, it's more of a Shirou route where Rin is the 'reward' at the end of it. If we compare her strong and powerful self from the other routes with what she ends up as in UBW you will notice the difference. Even in HF when things get really troublesome she already seems to have back-up plans. In UBW not so much."

Whereas Yuuji did most of the work for Sacchan, Haru and Kyousuke had almost equal efforts put in the development of their relationship Gsenj and Grisaia while having the plot clearly refine that relationship.

visualnovels,3bsqvz,hyperknees91,4,Thu Jul 2 05:30:28 2015 UTC,"Guess since there's so few couples of left I'll put some thoughts on the remaining couple combinations. I have no clue who will actually win of course as the results have all been fairly unpredictable xD   Shirou x Saber vs Shiki x Akiha   I'm sure many people think the Shirou combo is boring. However I do feel like they are an...enduring kind of boring in the same way I feel Tomoya x Nagisa is. Though the feel good relationship is also complimented by the themes that tie the two together. But it's also tragic that spoiler.   Akiha x Shiki is more interesting in a sense, but honestly I don't really think in a romantic sense Shiki has much chemistry with anyone outside of Arceid. Guy is simply too unstable for that, and Arceid kind of finds this aspect amusing so yeah. Not a bad pairing, but I don't think they would make for a great couple without any drama backing them up while Saber x Shirou I feel could make good moments without that fluff.   Yuuji x Yumiko vs Okabe x Kurisu.   In a way both of these relationships are very similar in the fact that its a girl having to deal with a somewhat crazy guy (not literally of course). The main reason Okabe x Kurisu wins is pretty simple. They get more development because the whole story focuses on those two, while Yuuji x Yumiko only get a single route together. There's also the simple fact Okabe and Kurisu even on their own are much better characters in general then those two. Yuuji x Yumiko is a great couple regardless and is easily the strongest in all of Grisaia.   Koutarou x Lucia vs Takeru x Meiya.   For fairness sakes I'll compare this to unlimited Meiya x Takeru. In terms of playing off each other in a less standard way...I feel like Meiya and Takeru really do work very well together. They also have very strong moments together. Kotarou and Lucia is ultra cute and all, but I feel like it's almost a tad too one-sided on Lucia's part because so much focus is given on her during it. Not to say Kotarou doesn't play off her at all, but it mostly seemed to be a combination of trolling or spoiler. It's good regardless but I guess I felt like the relationship with Takeru x Meiya is more genuine overall. Now if I factor Extra and Alternative in this...then yeah Kotarou x Lucia curb stomp them. So I guess it just depends on how you look at it.   Yamato x Kazuko vs Shirou x Rin   Basically a similar couple but reversed gender roles. They are both Tsukkomi/Boke pairings so both kind of play off each other at least in somewhat amusing a fashion. It's kind of hard to compare a couple from a charage from one from a storyge but I'll try. Shirou and Rin work because Rin's really used to tackling everything in a more calculative way and Shirou completely throws her off her rhythm with his thoughtless/reckless approach. To me it was just amusing to see in which way Shirou's attitude would set her off from one moment to the next. Plus he's overly blunt while she likes to be as indirect as possible. It's just a pair that plays off each other very well. Yamato x Kazuko is cute and once again, they sort of share a lot of these traits as well. I guess because they feel like they have less thematic importance and less underlying conflicts it makes the relationship feel a bit more underwhelming in comparison.    Yuuji x Amane vs Tomoya x Tomoyo   Once again a similar pairing as Tomoyo and Amane are basically very pushy girls to their man. Of course Tomoyo's a bit less in your face about it then Amane. Honestly...Amane and Yuuji have little to no chemistry together. Most of the time it's just Yuuji going ""Oh cmon"" to her sexual antics...and that's about it. Their route is too full of spoiler for them to ever develop into a decent couple. Tomoya and Tomoyo pretty much play off each other perfectly, and really do share a lot of genuine conversations and moments together. To me this one is not even a comparison.   Kyousuke x Haru vs Yuuji x Sachi   Once again...a similar relationship. Basically both couples involve a pessimistic guy with a weird girl and them basically going ""uh ok..."" to whatever they might do or what comes out of their mouth. Of course Kyousuke is quite a bit more negative then Yuuji. Both couples are kind of lacking in development in the romantic department as most of the story focuses on their problem then them as an actual pairing. I guess I'd have to give this round to Kyousuke x Haru because not only do I feel like they play off each other better as Yuuji and Sachi get rather boring when they finally get together, but also because they come from a linear game so their development as pair feels more consistently done throughout the game.   Battler x Beatrice vs Kotarou vs Akane.   The reason Battler x Beatrice win is pretty simple and I don't even need to give an indepth reason for it. spoiler kinda hard to make a believable couple when that happens.   Akio x Sanae vs Hisao and Hanako  Finally a couple that's the exact opposite of each other. I guess this depends on your taste on if you like a dynamic couple vs a feel good one. I'll just be simple with this one in saying that I would probably be entertained by a 12 episode anime that just starred Akio x Sanae living their day to day lives, I couldn't say that would happen with the other pairing. Also I don't really think Hanako x Hisao would be very interesting to see together regardless after the drama is over.   At this point though I wouldn't really mind if any of the remaining pairings won as I at least could somehow see it. Except for Amane x Yuuji as they need to kick the bucket."

visualnovels,3bsqvz,superange128,5,Wed Jul 1 21:52:24 2015 UTC,"I actually think Shirou x Rin is the worst main couple in Fate, which is a reason I actually think UBW is the worst route (but still enjoyable)"
visualnovels,3bsqvz,GregerMoek,3,Wed Jul 1 22:19:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry, long post ahead. I can see what you are coming from but I think the opposite actually. But everyone has different opinions and that's part of the fun with these threads and contests, the discussion! Not the results. Anyway here goes.  I think the UBW route is the worst but I think Rin and Shirou fits best together. They are the only couple that seems to be able to actually have fun and do things together. While Saber also has potential for this, she's more introverted and is more of a follower. HF has many nice moments, and it's my favorite route. Sakura's and Shirou's story is better, but I don't think they fit better together personality-wise. Rin's story is the worst(Rin goes from overpowering ally to useless sidekick very quickly, and that among other things ruins their chemistry), but I think she would fit him better if the girls' routes were more similar.  Rin takes initiative, she makes things happen, she has goals. Shirou not so much, he seeks goals through others(Kiritsugu initially, then his Love interest) and follows more often than leads. They would compliment each other quite well I think. For some reason I can't imagine Sakura and Shirou having fun together, aside from perhaps cooking. And their life would probably be pretty uneventful. Maybe that fits them? Anyway I see more story potential in Rin+Shirou as they get older."
visualnovels,3bsqvz,OavatosDK,3,Thu Jul 2 00:56:51 2015 UTC,"See that's the idea of their relationship, but for the most part what we actually saw was Rin's character from the other routes being diminished to a very tsundere caricature of herself. In theory they compliment each other well, but this compliment works well without the romantic attachment (which we see in Fate and HF). The romance just needlessly dragged down things that made Rin an entertaining and engaging character."
visualnovels,3bsqvz,GregerMoek,2,Thu Jul 2 01:40:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it starts off well in UBW actually, but it gets worse somewhere in the middle pretty quick. I guess Rin could work as a catalyst even if Shirou was in a relation with another girl even after the events, as one of the HF endings suggests, but yeah.   Ah well. No need to think about that now, the couples were never pitted against each other this time. Haha."
visualnovels,3bsqvz,OavatosDK,2,Thu Jul 2 01:49:05 2015 UTC,The real answer is that nobody should be with Shirou because they're all eventually more competent without him holding them back.

visualnovels,3bshs2,ConfuzzledKoala,4,Wed Jul 1 23:07:08 2015 UTC,"So, I finished Planetarian ~the reverie of a little planet~, and it was pretty great in the end. The first few hours of the game felt kinda average - not bad, but not anything spectacular ether -  but the ending basically blows that out of the water. Spoilers! That said, it’s difficult to evaluate on a whole, as the game sort of comes down to three hours of set-up for one (admittedly half-hour+ long) scene.  One gripe I had with it was in the sound production. The OST was great and really fitting at some points, but the sound effects came to be somewhat annoying, especially during Spoilers!. However, the writing and voice acting more than make up for it. Regardless, I enjoyed the game, and would recommend it to anyone who hasn’t played it. I have not yet listened to the drama CD prologue and epilogue, but apparently they’re equally emotional, so I’ll have to listen to them at some point.  So, after playing Planetarian so shortly after eden*, I decided to take a break from heart-wrenching emotional drama by playing If My Heart Had Wings (Kono Oozora). I’ve been warned against playing it, but I’m enjoying it so far. I didn’t go into it expecting a fantastic, life-changing story, I went into it hoping for a casual, laid-back, slice-of-life moege, and that’s basically what I’ve gotten. It’s nothing fantastic, but so far (three or four hours into the game) it's fun and enjoyable. Plus the visuals are spectacular and the sprites, backgrounds and CGs all look phenomenal.  It did take a while to set up (three separate patches!), but that’s to be expected I guess. While the (patched) translation is much better than I expected, there are still some inconsistencies - sometimes ""senpai"" is translated as ""senior"" and other times it’s just left untranslated, and the same thing with ""itadakimasu"". It’s nothing game-breaking, but it’s slightly jarring. Speaking of jarring, what’s up with those weird 3D plane models? They're strangely low-quality compared to the rest of the visuals and strangely processor-intensive for a VN.  I'm going to take a quick break from it to play the demo of Sekai's latest property, Sound of Drop, and I'll post my thoughts on it afterwards. Once I finish up my first route of IMHHW (I’ll probably do Ageha's), I’m going to move onto Fault -Milestone One-, which I have high expectations for."
visualnovels,3bshs2,ConfuzzledKoala,2,Wed Jul 1 21:03:19 2015 UTC,"Sound of Drop -fall into poison- is a horror/mystery visual novel that is being translated by Sekai Project, the demo of which was released yesterday. After playing through the roughly-one-hour-long demo, I have to say I’m intrigued. The story concerns two girls, Mayumi and Himeno, investigated some urban legends at an aquarium - a fairly typical horror setup. Mayumi has an untold history with the aquarium, causing her to experience flashbacks and visions very early spoilers when they visit. Also, Mayumi and Himeno bear a striking resemblance to Shizune and Misha. When Mayu demo ending, the opening plays, and the demo ends with the promise of a fall release.  While the story is interesting, the writing is generally quite average so far, and the character interactions feel unbelievable at times. There were a couple typos, but nothing too major. The visuals (backgrounds, sprites and sprite movement) all look quite good though, and the music is varied and fitting, especially during the more tense and unnerving scenes. It looks like there will be lots of choices in the full game, the description of which even boasts 30+ (mostly bad) endings, which certainly seems to add to replayability. I even saw a couple of the bad endings during the demo (bad ending spoilers in ""Decapitation One"" in particular shocked me quite a bit, especially as I wasn’t sure it was a bad ending at first). Another thing that’s cool is the optional location descriptions from the save menu.  So I guess I can add that to the ever-expanding list of upcoming Sekai projects I’m excited for. I’m starting to think they probably have more upcoming titles than actual released games at this point. In any case, I’ll get back to If My Heart Had Wings now."

I’ve reached what seems to be the climax of the common route, with the token ""this is only the beginning"" sequence followed by the opening credits appearing roughly 10 hours into the game (which is doubly strange considering we had already seen a completely different set of opening credits about six hours earlier). What's also strange is that at this point, Asa and Yoru (two of the game's main heroines) have gotten a cumulative five minutes or so of screentime (I think they'll be introduced properly soon, but I can't be sure).  So, the sequence before the opening includes the increasingly-dramatic scenes leading up to . Not going to lie, there was some genuine emotion in the  scene. The  shortly afterwards was similarly dramatic and amply established Tobioka as an outright villain, which isn't necessarily a good thing. Apart from making me wonder just how he even got the permission to do that in a single day, it also feels like Tobioka's character has changed from ""disagreeable old man with conflicting views"" to ""villain from a Disney film"".  Either way, I'm still surprised and somewhat saddened to see  go, and am seriously wondering how this would effect . I'm still very much enjoying this game, and look forward to seeing what else it has in store. I'm probably going to do Ageha’s route first, even though Kotori seems like she’s been billed as the main heroine."

Since then I've finished Danganronpa and started Higurashi no Naku Koro ni.  Danganronpa was a blast to read and to play. The puzzles gradually became much more difficult, intriguing, and complex. Sometimes that way that the puzzles were set up were unnecessarily complicated or difficult, though. Sometimes the wording on phrases was too unclear, and I would understand what the next link in the logical chain was, but I would not be able to figure out which phrases or evidences to use. My only regret is the School Mode and the sequel aren't available on PSP in English. I'd highly recommend it to anyone interested in mystery or logic puzzles.  I finished the first Episode of Higurashi, Onikakushi, and I am excited to continue the series. Despite the relative step back in quality from Umineko, the same quality of writing, sound design, and storytelling makes it an excellent read on its own. I'm using an updated sprites patch like I did with Umineko, and some fixed sounds as well. (I really do love Ryukishi07, but drawing isn't his strong suit.) Moving backwards from Umineko, there are other interesting points that you obviously wouldn't notice otherwise, such as Higurashi/Umineko Spoilers For the most part, I'm excited to know what the story will do from here.  First Impressions and Theories  More Higurashi Spoilers  More Higurashi Spoilers  More Higurashi Spoilers  I'm more confident about this explanation than any of the ones I had for Umineko. I've been wrong before, though, and I'll try to be much more flexible with my theories this time around, even though I know that's completely impossible for me. I look forward to reading more."

I found the story to be very well put together, and it kept my interest throughout. I also loved the characters and the different dynamics they had with each other. The serious parts are all patched together with a good bit of goofy humor and ridiculous situations, too. I highly recommend playing it if you have the chance.  I decided that my next read is going to be the Steam version of If My Heart Had Wings, which I picked up from the recent Summer Sale. I've only played about an hour of it so far, so I don't have much to say about it yet.

The writing seemed awkward at the beginning but somewhat improved. Took me about 1 minute to start regretting putting my real name in the name selection box.  I was a little excited about reading Nicole but I'm pretty disappointed so far. I've finished Jeff's route and don't see what else there could be left in the VN because the culprit is  which was pretty obvious from reading Jeff's route. My only thought is that the culprit changes depending on the route and that is the incentive to play the other routes which I feel would be pretty dumb, or the character that appears on the Steam trading cards but not in the story is the mastermind.

I should stay away from any VN that mention things like Laplace's demon, time loop, wordlines etc for a year or so - otherwise I'll end up once again not enjoying story I normally should.  But enough about my drama, the game was finally as interesting as I was hoping for. The point when I finally shut up and started to just read and read was the beginning of  itself finally blew that annoying facade of ""mad scientist"" from Okabe, forcing him to admit how much he cares about his friends and having him been honest with himself (I know it's often hard to face reality man, but you could at least not try to fool yourself...). And it's not only him, because every character in their respective chapters/endings had to go through some hard time, fighting with their owns insecurities and facing the consequences of their previous actions . In the end though it always came back to choices made by Okabe and I really, really appreciate that there were moments when he just  In a way, that reminded me of  route in Never7, though with completely opposite goals.   Other ""hard"" ending in Steins;Gate for me was . Sharing consciously consequences of their choices and still trying somehow to be happy together... That was really depressing, so I'm thankful for that picture at the end. That was... well, I won't write ""worth it"", but it certainly helped in finding some enjoyment in that particular end.

And ultimate endings waiting at the finale of the game? I don't want to say that I've seen that coming (definitely not the details of it), but from halfway of the game it felt like we might be faced to pick one of those two characters. Still it was dramatic enough to make me really care.  And now I'm reading the true ending, so that's that. Getting on it was quite complicated and while I know it's supposed to be sort of hidden, I can't help but feel that it's too specific to trigger it.  To sum up: Steins;Gate is (and soon was) a great experience and if not for dull moments at the earlier chapters and my ""exhaustion"" with scientific stuff, I wouldn't have a problem with calling it almost perfect.

Certainly not something I would pay for. But as a free VN it's pretty good. The game's structure is pretty simple. You order a drink, then a meal, and then you rate the waitress. If you're looking for a nice short game you can finish in about 2 hours then I'd say it's pretty good. At the beginning I found the VAs kind of irritating, but they grew on me.  I also finished two more VNs. First one was Juniper's Knot, a nice short VN, that I'd heard was pretty good so I decided to check it out. Then I played 1000 Words.

I really like how often the scene will shift to different angles as well as the minor amount of animation for the characters when they talk and blink. I will probably finish it this weekend when I have time, but it is looking to be good from what I have read so far.   I am really wanting to dive into a longer VN soon (after having recently finished Rewrite), but don't know which yet. Mostly just bridging that gap in time until then with shorter VNs for now.

visualnovels,3bs265,superange128,18,Wed Jul 1 18:11:55 2015 UTC,"You know, there’s no way she’s going to come out on top, hell I don’t think she’s even going to get a lot of votes. But if you’ll spare me some time, allow me to explain why I think Yuuko, possibly the most underrated character of the entire series, is one of MLA’s finest achievements (one of the bigger reasons I like MLA), and overall a real great character.  Yuuko Kouzuki, Man. I could just go on about why she is simply one of the most attractive characters ever. She is beautiful, proud, wears that white coat and suit like she designed it, smart, intelligent, cunning, witty, has a good sense of humor but is serious when it counts. While she can be cold, calculating and rather distant, on the inside she is actually very faithful, thankful and caring.   However, all that is just facial merit. Allow me to explain the real depth to her character if you may.   Warning: Spoilers. Warning: Essay.  Firstly, Yuuko is pretty much the only other character who is truly alongside Takeru for this whole journey, pretty much the 2nd main character, and in my opinion, has a lot more going for as her development isn't as ‘in your face’ as Takeru and his repetitive monologues were. Yuuko’s development is very well written because it was subtle and meaningful. There were hints and small changes weaved throughout the entire trilogy that add up and really develop her as one of the greater characters I’ve encountered in a visual novel.  “Wait? You mean she really isnt just a walking plot device?”  A lot of people like to point out how convenient her role in the plot is, but forget about her justification behind the plot, as well as the depth of her character. Which, with a little bit of elaboration, I hope to explain here.  A Human Genius with Human Weakness  Yuuko is presented as that one who always seems to know everything and always seems to come out on top. In Extra, she is that mischievous teacher who seems to butt in and make things worse (or better), but only for the sole goal of having fun with everyone (and for herself). Even though she is manipulative and seemingly mischievous, at the end of the day its all good fun and she cares deeply about those around her. (Lets not forget the meta-hilarity of her taking notice of and then studying why every girl seems attracted to Takeru, and just so she could help Marimo with her love troubles too.)  In Unlimited/Alternative however, the fun and games are over. She is in a position of power, authority and responsibility. Taking on the endeavor of saving humanity through her own genius and wit, both in the political, scientific and military spheres. However, as in line with the main themes of tragedy, even for Yuuko, it will be unforgivingly tough and will push her to the limit.  How is this so? Throughout Unlimited and Alternative, she remains her playful, mischievous extra self, evident that they are truly the same person. However, her real character shines when she encounters problems, and when her weakness slips into vision. When her true human character shows.  Yuuko has the weight of the world on her shoulders, and despite her genius, she encounters difficulty after difficulty with both the beta and the alternative human world. Through Takeru’s interactions we see times where she is annoying, frustrated and plain angry with the world. She even vents that on Takeru subtly but ever so present. Amongst the hardest times, she even loses her cool and you can really make out that she herself is struggling within, similar to Takeru. Struggling to come to terms with how everything keeps going wrong and feeling guilty for every sacrifice she has to make (remember, all of this is on the extreme side of things, being the one in charge and all). Then when everything fails, we see her at the end of Unlimited, defeated, giving up on herself and everything else. She tries her best to hide it, but even Takeru sees the utter sorrow and agony coming from her.  She is not a laughing impress all genius who can walk in and save the day. She is a real human, one struggling to find her way in a world full of tragedy. She portrays the ‘genius’, the one who has to hold up all that responsibility, the one tasked with solving all the hard problems, the one who no matter what must never give up, in a more realistic and believable light. She doesnt just beat everyone without trying, outsmart everything and laugh it all off  as nothing. She fails, she struggles, she doubts herself and her studies, she hides her real caring self in order to continue down and prevent others from hurting. She needs to be the one everyone can rely, but no matter what, she is still human, she still feels pain like the rest of us.  Yuuko’s struggle is even more severe than you realize. Being a genius doesn't make life easy. She has a lot of issues from her personality, a big hint was her differences with the scientific community as well as being a slave to her research and her cause. Not to mention that Takeru, being a causality conductor and all, gave her memories of Alternative IV being cancelled, and all the terrible things that happen to humanity when Yuuko herself fails at her job. Throughout alternative, she remembered what she felt before, at that time and further on, vowing never to let that happen this time, doing everything she must.  But then, what happens when one’s means become their ends? What happens when Yuuko, believing everything she does is for humanity, seem to be doing the most inhuman, immoral things one can do? Such as using people like pawns and playing with life itself.  Morality and Doubt  Yuuko realizes that unless she is prepared to sacrifice everyone and everything, then history (from Takeru's point of view at least) is doomed to repeat itself. Throughout the entire alternative world, she has to sacrifice resources, people, soldiers and friends alike just to get one step small step closer. All on her word and her will, as the one most responsible but most adequate to be in charge. However even then, things get messier when the science and risky inhuman experiments in the background get involved.   Yuuko is forced to slowly give up her humanity in-order to move forward, all for the sake of 'humanity's salvation'. It's also easier said than done. As a human, and especially a critical thinker, she is bound to always doubt and question herself and her actions. One can never be completely confident in what they are doing if it is just observed by themselves. Let's not forget the massive amounts of guilt she feels, that no matter how logical her decisions were, all the sacrifices she made were extremely trivial compared to the results they produced. She’s killing humans in hopes of saving them. Hypocritical much? Making tough choices does not make one a bad person, but what if those tough choices were the wrong choices, the ones only chosen by someone blind, crazy and deluded beyond help.  Her giving the gun to Takeru is both a symbolic and literal account of allowing Takeru to act as her moral consciousness. Yuuko doubts her own morality, doubts her intentions as a human, as 'pro-humanity', but she herself wouldn't be able to see past her own thoughts. She tells Takeru that if what she is doing is truly wrong, truly evil, truly in no way shape or form going to help humanity, then he can shoot her right here and now. The gun is loaded, and Takeru is trained, and Yuuko is dead serious. Takeru, being the only other one as deep into this as she is without being completely fixated on it was the only one she could have relied on for this. She needs this, she needs this confirmation that what she is doing is truly right, truly for the hope of humanity. If there is no meaning for all of Yuuko’s struggle and sacrifice, of others by her hand, as well as herself, then there is no reason she should continue, no reason for her to live, and the only way to do that would be for Takeru to stop her, as she is too far invested into her plan, she wouldnt be able to back down now.    Yuuko is afraid of succumbing to her mind, to her logic, to her ability to ignore emotion and forget the weight of a human life, ironically in-order to save everyone. If there is no reason for all her sacrifices, then she would rather die. For Yuuko values her humanity, she is still that kind and caring women from Extra, she is still the one who at the end of the day wants one less tear to be shed. But even so, if it is for the sake of humanity, she will even sacrifice her own humanity. This is the extent of her determination. Even if there will be more sacrifices, and more times when her weakness gets the better of her, she will continue only stronger, persevering only because only she can.  So it raises the question, why is she so willing to sacrifice everything for humanity? Why does she care this much about the future of the human race? What is it, exactly, that keeps Yuuko a kind and caring person, despite how easy it could be for her to be extremely cold and logical? Why does Yuuko care about losing her own humanity?  (Continued below)"
visualnovels,3bs265,Joyduck7,11,Wed Jul 1 19:43:15 2015 UTC,"(dear lord how much have I written) Continued:   Her Reason  Well, Yuuko cares for humanity. She cares about others, she wants only the best for everyone, to the point where she is completely heartbroken at the end of Unlimited. In Alternative, she really never takes other’s sacrifices lightly (even though it may seem otherwise), and instead always holds the highest respects for those give their lives for her. She honours this by continuing down the path that those bodies gave way to with all her might. She doesn't question or make a big deal of it, precisely because everyone involved already understands the weight of it. What might seem as Yuuko being cold hearted and ‘using them as a tool’ to some, is actually Yuuko giving the upmost respect to those who died so they can die with honour to their cause. Everyone who knows her respects Yuuko, and Yuuko knows that they wouldn't want her to waste time mourning over their deaths when she needs to carry on and save the world. (Although even then Yuuko still feels gulit for this, as they are still dead and it is still her fault.)  Yuuko’s heart is subtle but present. She truly cares, and maybe in another universe, would be more than happy laughing and playing along with everyone as just another mentor.  However, why does she care? What is it that caused her to become this attached to the world, to humanity, that she would put herself and everyone around her through hell just to save whatever she could. The answer is present in the entire trilogy. Writtin in throughout the whole of extra, unlimited and into alternative. One thing that is present and then cut short at the moment we least expected it.  It was her best friend. Her only friend.  Its never clearly stated, but its not hard to put the hints together and imagine what her backstory was (although one has to speculate a little here). Those who are smart and logical never tend to be the most social. Throughout her whole childhood and school life, it is easy to see how Yuuko, being one of the most abstract and intelligent person of her time, could have easily been ostracized, bullied, shunned, avoided or just plain ignored. Growing up isnt easy, and even those with good intentions are usually misunderstood because no one can follow their reasoning. I imagine Yuuko’s younger personality wasn’t the easiest to get along with (remember she had her differences with the entire scientific community). So its not hard to guess that she was envied for her talent, bullied for her knowledge and generally avoided for her unsociable nature (being the youngest of 3 siblings doesnt help either). However, this doesn’t mean everyone would have avoided her. It would have taken someone full of heart, down to earth, willing to listen, understand and care for others more than themselves to break through to her. One willing to get to know this particular genius and prove to her that she is worth being friends with. Who, could I imagine, is written so perfectly for that role, and is conveniently in a position in the story for that to happen. Hell, the genius said it herself.  It was, of course, the one and only Marimo.  I imagine it was her that brought out Yuuko’s good nature, and there was no doubt Yuuko herself was touched by this act. Yuuko felt love and kindness. Someone noticed her, she felt human again (No ping pong required). This led to Yuuko discovering a new nature of being a mischievous manipulator, taking Marimo all for herself, teasing her to no end out of love. So much that Yuuko even decided to be a school teacher rather than join the scientific community. Giving up all her potential future fortune and fame, and oh, and it just happened to be the same school as Marimo, gee I wonder why. What may seem like a casual friendship at a first glance, was really one of the deepest and most valued parts of Yuuko’s personality. Marimo reminded Yuuko that she was human, she gave her a reason for living, for enjoying life once again. The fact that this exists in the Alternative universe in almost unparalleled similarity; that Yuuko would use under the table dealings just to get Marimo close to her once again, truly showed how much she valued her.  And then Yuuko unintentionally causes her gruesome, meaningless death.  Carry on my way  So... the primary object of Yuuko’s affection and value... seemingly just got... eaten. Oh and it was Yuuko’s fault too, capturing and experimenting on the beta that then escaped. Her humanity, evidence that she was human, proof that she felt pain and struggled. Killed. Essentially by her hand. You know the pain Takeru felt? That kid who probably knew Marimo for about, less than a year? as his homeroom teacher? You know all the 'many' things Marimo helped him with and how he came attached to her loving and kind nature? (as we all did) Yea…  Yuuko felt something like that. Just a tinny winny bit worse, you know? Like, at least 100x worse.  Yuuko could have given up, but she doesn’t. And this is the point where everything in her character development comes together. The reason why, exactly, she would not give up, and instead carry on her way. The answer to why she works so hard for humanity, why she still tries to attach herself to an identity as a human despite having to sacrifice that very identity to move forward, and why now, she will continue no matter how hard it gets, even though her best friend became just another meaningless sacrifice at her hand.  And it's because Yuuko has hope for humanity (a theme not undersold in this visual novel). That there is truly something about being human and loving and caring for each other that is irreplaceable, invaluable and sacred. So much, that it is worth fighting and sacrificing for. Yuuko will endure and continue to struggle out of love for humanity, the love that marimo showed her. She will continue fighting for that sole purpose, to maintain the existence of that love. No matter how hard it gets, how much she has to sacrifice, no matter how much she falls down, she will get back up, and keep walking (the major theme of MLA). Even as her weakness gets the best of her, as she continues to doubt herself, she focuses on the future and the next step, no matter how small, to victory.  Even in the Extra world PTSD arc, ‘fun loving playful’ Yuuko is seriously aware of all the implications and feelings of her alternative self. She then even knowingly sacrificed herself (becoming her alternative self's pawn in a way) to get Takeru back on his feet, and to save the universe she loves and fought so far for. This is the real type of person Yuuko always was, at least in every universe where Yuuko had one friend. Her only friend.  This is the real reason behind her character; she wants to save the world that gave birth to the love that saved her. Its never blatantly stated, but its certainly written in, subtly, meaningfully and wonderfully. You have to connect the dots before it becomes clear. Even then, I think the haziness of her character and how her actions seem to do all the talking that just adds to it all.  There is always something more powerful about using actions rather than words to explain one's character. Especially in one very particular scene.  Which of course, is Yuuko’s most famous scene. The one that really solidifies everything about her true character. At a point where there is truly nothing more she could possibly do to change the fate of the universe. Where no more manipulating, or hard decisions can be made anymore. Where there is no need to hide her emotions. Her subtle yet most powerful moment.  ""Look Marimo, your children are leaving.""  Yuuko Kouzuki. A fine, fine character indeed. Throughout all three novels, a personality given multiple dimensions, realistic and interesting traits, written tightly with subtle hints that create her motivations, backstory and her reason for living and enduring. Gotta love her.  “I'll carry on, my way! Even if I have to offer up this life  I'll carry on, my way! Without doubt, without fail, I will not forget  Your tenderness that's softer than snow”"
visualnovels,3bs265,Joyduck7,5,Wed Jul 1 19:45:01 2015 UTC,"Well, I applaud your effort for writing. She is not only the most intelligent character, she is also the most intelligently written character. She is the foundation that the whole story is truly built upon.  Initially, it might be difficult to sympathise with her. But as the story progresses you understand how much she has sacrificed, and continues to do, for everyone around her. She will win, at any cost."
visualnovels,3bs265,BlackOdder,4,Wed Jul 1 20:35:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah Yuuko easily had the most thought and effort put into her, and it's pretty ironic that like you said, she's pretty much the 2nd main character of this whole franchise. Even though there were several things I did not care for in terms of Muv Luv, Yuuko basically made it all worth it by her amazing characterization which you rarely see in VNs."
visualnovels,3bs265,hyperknees91,3,Wed Jul 1 19:56:56 2015 UTC,Bravo. I voted her a ten before I read this. You are correct that she is a truly standout character.
visualnovels,3bs265,Panhead369,2,Thu Jul 2 00:54:52 2015 UTC,"Yuuko is one of my favorite characters too, the only thing I will disagree with you on is her looks. More specifically her hair. That's the only problem I had with her and it has nothing to do with her being a great character or not, it just felt so... Inconsistent. I realize most hairstyles in ML are odd like that though, but I felt it more with Yuuko in some scenes. Probably because she gets so much screen time.  Here I think is one of the best looking hair-moments of Yuuko in the ML series. The hair looks alive there and it has adapted to the scene.  Here it looks fine, I have no real complaints about this(most standard) way. From this angle the hair seems to fall naturally around her neck.  Here it looks REALLY good, but I'm guessing this is from a different VN? I haven't read it but I appreciate this look way more than the standard one.  Here is one of the scenes where I started thinking her hair was meh. It just... I can't even put it in words well... I guess it looks like a poorly designed helmet. The hair doesn't seem to follow her body naturally, but rather remain stiff even if she turns her head(now I am focusing on the hair falling past her cheeks, not the 'upper' hair).  Here it looks fine, because the hanging part of her hair has adapted to the situation.  In the scenes where she kisses Takeru... I don't even want to link that. It looks awful. Truly a helmet.  So to narrow it down, her hair mechanics are just not consistent. In some scenes it follows her body well, and makes sense. In some scenes it looks like a purple helmet someone made from can with a knife.  So to compliment your well reasoned post, I just felt like getting this unreasonable and stupid rant out in words. I don't disagree with you at all. Yuuko -is- great."
visualnovels,3bs265,GregerMoek,2,Wed Jul 1 20:22:44 2015 UTC,Everyone has crazy hair in Muv Luv. Which makes Mitsuki seem really out of place haha.
visualnovels,3bs265,hyperknees91,2,Wed Jul 1 20:27:44 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah. Hair was the problem I had with Meiya too honestly. It looked better from afar but compared to... Say Sumika, her hair is very steel-looking. Yuuhi's hair is better IMO.  But then I also think that Tama's hair was even more annoying, so to sum up my biggest yet very unimportant complaint about Muv-luv looks wise it would be that some hairstyles are just not my thing. I enjoyed the VN despite this though."
visualnovels,3bs265,GregerMoek,5,Wed Jul 1 20:39:34 2015 UTC,The hair in muv luv is more scientifically improbable then the actual plot.
visualnovels,3bs265,hyperknees91,2,Wed Jul 1 20:42:12 2015 UTC,"My favorite dialogue with her is in the PTSD arc, when she says something like how its hard to watch her own student get torn apart by quantum casualty. It's a rare moment of her showing emotion, and It made her a lot more human"
visualnovels,3bs265,hookmasterflex333,2,Thu Jul 2 07:27:43 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah, Yuuko is amazing and one of my favorite characters. My favorite character is Meya, but Yuuko is the second best one without a doubt."
visualnovels,3bs265,JCAPER,2,Thu Jul 2 12:28:54 2015 UTC,"Oh, God damn it.   I've already gone through the whole series twice, don't make me want to do it again. I've at least gotta wait until the official translation comes out.   I don't have anything major to add, but one quote from here, while not an absolutely original sentiment, really caught my eye when I was reading through:    Time is the cruelest kindness    Now it doesn't take a genius to figure out any implications of that, especially in the context of the story, so I won't go unnecessarily into detail, but I thought it might be worth bringing up."
visualnovels,3bs265,sagethesagesage,2,Thu Jul 2 14:52:21 2015 UTC,"Good quote. I could have probably gone off on another paragraph entirely about that one.   While there are many parallels and many themes surrounding it, I think it is best represented by Yuuko's character over the entire trilogy as Yuuko is, in a way, 'forced' to stay alive and continue while everyone else eventually finds their resting place. She is never allowed to put herself in danger and instead must put others in it. Time is kind to allow her to live to save humanity, but it is cruel in that she will only continue to do so by suffering and slowly be overcome with guilt and regret. The best part is how Yuuko already realizes this, even all the way back in Extra when it is first mentioned. We can see that right from the get go she is a mature character and ready for whatever the world/beta will throw at her, prepared to never give up as long as there is a chance."
visualnovels,3bs265,Joyduck7,2,Fri Jul 3 13:37:59 2015 UTC,"Damn this is a quality post. After replaying MLA 3 times, I came to the same conclusion. The more you know about what she's doing behind the scenes, the more you realize how amazing of a character she is"

visualnovels,3bs265,GregerMoek,3,Wed Jul 1 20:35:49 2015 UTC,"So sad Monomi got voted so low...so sad indeed.   Takeru - Really well developed but hard to look at him from one viewpoint. His extra self is insufferable, his unlimited self goes through some genuinely good development and he's quite likable by the end, alternative removes most of this good development and makes him superbly wishy-washy the whole game. Not that it's unbelievable but yeah, can be annoying at times. Overall a good main character but he doesn't have quite enough personality to really stand up to the likes of Okabe or Battler. Also his voice actor really didn't do him much help because he's rather underwhelming.   Sumika - In extra she's ok, but probably annoying to a lot of people. In Alternative her concept is interesting and the scenes with her are overall good. However she has too little screen time regardless.   Meiya- In extra she's funny but also a bit eh with her romance with Takeru. In Unlimited this is done much much better and she's really great throughout it. In Alternative she has some great moments but feels like they kind of...left her character short so she could be the underdog for romance. I feel like a whole lot more needed to be done with this character.  Chizuru - For the most part, completely insufferable. But she has some ok development in unlimited at the very least and grows more tolerable. In Alternative she feels completely left out of the story for the most part other than some small scenes (much like every unlimited Eishi outside of Meiya).   Kei - Strange...and that's about it. In Unlimited she's the same as Chizuru and alternative she's got the same problems. Very underused character.  Tama - Loli...and that's about it. In unlimited she's pretty good like the other two though. Same as Chizuru and Kei in alternative.  Mikoto - Here to question your sexuality...and that's about it. Same as Chizuru, Kei and Tama in terms of strengths and problems.  Marimo - Has some good scenes and is decently written, but overall feels more she's used to give Takeru development more than anything.   Yuuko - The best overall written character. Interesting, hiding a lot of things beneath the surface, and fairly unpredictable. She also gets a lot of subtle development beneath her skin which is nice. Funny how other than Takeru...she actually has the most screen time. As such she also has the most chemistry with Takeru. Not even in a romantic way, their conversations are just overall natural in nature.  Kasumi - Not enough is done with this character is all I really have to say about her. She has some ok scenes, but that's about it.  Isumi- Wonderfully written and has great dialogue with the main character. Funny how I feel like she was done more justice than Meiya or Sumika in this game. She's not even in it a terrible amount, but she makes her importance known and felt for the entire rest of the game.  Mitsuki - Also pretty good...and once again feels more important than Meiya and Sumika >_>. I don't think she was in the game quite long enough either unfortunately.  Akane - Annoying girl...that's about it. Terrible voice acting to compliment her.  Haruko - Who?   Overall the cast of Muv Luv is kind of lacking despite having some strong characters. Well Muv Luv is kind of lacking in a lot of ways so that's not a surprise."
visualnovels,3bs265,hyperknees91,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:48:40 2015 UTC,"I think the story of Muv-luv is better than most of the characters, when I think more about it I think Isumi, Misae and Mitsuki are the characters that I like most along with Meiya and Yuuko. I agree that Meiya should've been explored/used more. HOWEVER I will say that I haven't read anything else than MLE/MLU/MLA so maybe she's great in the other works she's in too.   The thing with Meiya, and what I think is best done with her, is that she's a reliable character. Not that she has 'reliable' as a trait but that you feel like you know her the more the story goes. Her character traits are so well defined and are shown so clearly in every situation she's in. I think that's good, she's consistent even through development. She just seems to make the most sense given the context of everything. She doesn't do anything random or truly out of character to fit better into some plot moment.  Honestly I liked Takeru in the start of MLA, it felt good to finally get rid of the childish and ""lacking"" Takeru from the previous other games. However later on it's shown that he's only marginally stronger mentally. That's where he starts to become one of those protagonists that feel like a burden once more. No matter how angry I was at Takeru in the latter stages of MLA I gotta say he was probably pretty well written, he just wasn't that likable for me personally."

visualnovels,3bpo19,i300,2,Wed Jul 1 14:22:39 2015 UTC,"It's set in the Nasuverse and Aoko Aozaki is the main character. Pretty sure it takes place before Tsukihime. And no, no translation. Commie were working on one but its dead."
visualnovels,3bpo19,i300,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:31:45 2015 UTC,Interesting... usually mirror moon does the translations right? I wonder why they haven't tackled this particular work.

Language might not be as simple as your ordinary harem VN, but if you've got some nerves you will manage it with great effort   However, since Mahoyo has such a superb music repertoire and beautiful art, you will not find it boring to read whatsoever => I had 2 weeks off, and during those, I was reading Mahoyo nonstop 17-20 hours a day, 10 days in row really enjoyed every part of it!  Go for it!"
visualnovels,3bpo19,hyperknees91,17,Wed Jul 1 22:57:19 2015 UTC,"I might be jumping the gun a bit, but I'm going to say Liar-soft's upcoming title Fairytale Requiem. Reading the trial took me much longer than anticipated as I kept stopping to admire how everything looked. Very much like Gekidan Inu Curry's work on various SHAFT series, as you can see Liar-soft used textures to great effect giving everything this unreal yet infinitely imaginative look.  Edit: I must also mention Hikari no Valusia, an explosion and celebration of colour. Its artist is the same as Fairytale Requiem's (Ooishi Ryuuko), who Reddit may be more familiar with due to her also being the artist for Sekien no Inganock and Forest."
visualnovels,3bpo19,Faustyna,4,Wed Jul 1 04:21:40 2015 UTC,Gotta love the forest style of artwork. So great for letting the imagination play around.
visualnovels,3bpo19,riruru,4,Wed Jul 1 05:11:30 2015 UTC,Wow. Fairytale Requiem looks like a Witch's plane from Madoka.
visualnovels,3bpo19,wqopreuitysaklfdhjg,3,Wed Jul 1 17:56:00 2015 UTC,"After reading the trial I did some quick comparisons with my Madoka Production Notes and the Gekidan Inu Curry influence is unmistakable.   But it's interesting that you mentioned the witches' realms, an entirely different realm compared to the characters' everyday lives. Fairytale Requiem's characters live in that different realm all the time, what's abnormal becoming their normal so it was a really neat (and suggestive, taking the above into account) visual choice."

visualnovels,3bpo19,Guadelupe,9,Wed Jul 1 03:55:14 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like Innocent Grey's art the best. Their works are nonpareil when it comes to consistently good art.  E1 E2  If we're expanding aesthetics to include how nice the interface looks, then I think that HoshiOri (and the other tonework games) excel at this category.  E1 E2 E3  When it comes to pure production value, then it's hard to compete with minori, as they're one of the few companies that actually have cinematic visual novels. Their art style's not a personal favorite (because it's so similar) though.  E1 E2 E3  If we're excluding minori, I'd say that sprite's most recent game, AoKana, has some really appealing, high-quality visuals too.  E1 E2 E3  There are a few honorable mentions (for doing peculiar things). For example, Natsuiro Recipe, Pulltop Air's debut game, features a lot of food art. E1 E2 E3  All in all, a good deal of modern games have an affable art style. The better games have high consistency, and the great ones have high consistency, an affable style, and a flair of originality."
visualnovels,3bpo19,mdzjdz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:49:52 2015 UTC,Natsuiro's food art is godlike. There's some quality about it I can't quite place that makes it look irresistibly appealing. I remember reading your review on the game and getting super hungry.

Backgrounds did a great job integrating the characters instead of being the usual flat backdrop for sprites. Gorgeous night sky/sunset cgs.

visualnovels,3bpo19,aldarionar_,3,Wed Jul 1 05:36:21 2015 UTC,I wholeheartedly agree with this. The whole reason I decided to read HoshiMemo in the first place was because of the bright colors and beautiful art.

Everything looks pretty well-drawn, great stuff.  In terms of overall quality, I can't recall anything that beats Rewrite. Even the menu looks great in that visual novel. Grisaia no Kajitsu is also pretty good.  That reminds me, I gotta finish Rewrite someday.

visualnovels,3bnive,DragoonX6,2,Tue Jun 30 18:07:57 2015 UTC,"I rarely care for H-scenes its just the fact that its censored.  As somebody who hasn't experienced said series i don't want other people deciding what gets cut because of sexual content or gore.  Honestly feel like having the choice between both versions is great, it just sucks that we'll be waiting on the 18+ release.  All the extras you mentioned are great, but why should that excuse censoring the content."
visualnovels,3bnive,Cornetto_Man,3,Tue Jun 30 20:21:31 2015 UTC,its just the fact that its censored.   But you see that's the thing. It's not censored. The all-ages version is made by Age. It's not like Steam is making Age make a version with no h-content just for Steam.   Honestly feel like having the choice between both versions is great   This is my opinion on the matter too. There was a thread about this very issue about 6 months ago when Grisaia was announced and I wrote my thoughts here. That hasn't changed. I don't care if AA happens or not. I don't care if I have to wait a little bit longer for the 18+ version as long as I get the option too. Whereas here they've already confirmed that an uncut version will happen yet people are still complaining about censorship.
visualnovels,3bnive,8cccc9,5,Tue Jun 30 20:28:53 2015 UTC,Because they want a simultaneous release... Having to wait for what they consider to be the definitive version of the game is hardly fun.   I'd like to know just how much content is cut from the all ages version because waiting months for what amounts to h-scenes and gore seems like a small slice of that visual novel and shouldn't warrent months of waiting to get the 18+ version.  No doubt there might be/is more to it than that but from our point of view its hard to see or rationalise.
visualnovels,3bnive,Daitelion,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:38:23 2015 UTC,"But you see that's the thing. It's not censored. The all-ages version is made by Age. It's not like Steam is making Age make a version with no h-content just for Steam.   Considering the all ages version is made for the PS3 and from reading the other comments it appears that the gore and sexual content are intended parts of the game and not just added for extra sales. It's Sony censoring the VN. From what I know, all console platforms do not allow you to ship sexual content. So if you want to release on those platforms you have to make an all ages version, or at least a toned down one.  However, having said all that, looking at VNDB shows that they made an all ages version for PC platforms 6 years before the PS3 version. So I think they wanted to appeal to a younger audience at some point for whatever reason, for example a store not wanting to sell VNs with 18+ content in them."
visualnovels,3bnive,Cornetto_Man,2,Thu Jul 2 01:37:55 2015 UTC,"However, having said all that, looking at VNDB shows that they made an all ages version for PC platforms 6 years before the PS3 version.   Well that pretty much invalidates your whole first paragraph but I have to point one thing out first.   and from reading the other comments it appears that the gore and sexual content are intended parts of the game and not just added for extra sales.   The gore yes but as I've said multiple times now the AA version still has gore just toned down slightly. The gore isn't even the most important part of that scene. It's for shock value plain and simple. Toning it down slightly would probably improve the scene tbh. The h-scenes are completely tacked on for the most part. You could make an argument for one as part of the story but honestly removing it wouldn't change the story at all. Hell one in MLA is not only terrible, out of place and actually damages the game imo but it's quite clearly just there to appeal to a specific fetish."
visualnovels,3bnive,Jmaisonet,2,Thu Jul 2 10:08:08 2015 UTC,"Same here, though I personally welcome the all ages version of Muv-Luv, because almost all h- and gore scenes felt tacked on, over the top or forced. Or they were just there to mess with the reader, which I couldn't really stand.  The KS sounds better and better, lets just see what they will exactly do with the translation."
visualnovels,3bnive,Jmaisonet,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:18:40 2015 UTC,"It's all about censoring that one scene, the gore was very relevant there.   Don't think anyone cares about the H tbh."
visualnovels,3bnive,Taedirk,2,Wed Jul 1 00:07:08 2015 UTC,But it's not like it's completely removed. Merely toned down.

Not sure why they're asking through, considering Sumika/Meiya are the two required routes to unlock Unlimited.   Eishi vs. TSF pilot ... going to be a close battle, apparently. I slightly prefer Eishi just because it's less literal to me (being a native English reader) and kind of catchy. After dozens of hours hearing the phrase, it just became less awkward and more natural. Two syllables helps too.   Like how we often use the word chauffeur instead of limousine driver.    But it also makes sense to use TSF pilot just because Eishi comes out of left field, while the word chauffeur is common knowledge."

visualnovels,3bnive,gabgrave,6,Wed Jul 1 11:29:18 2015 UTC,"I am in full argeement that having pilots from other countries call themselves Eishi would be absolutely disgusting but I still feel that a Japanese pilot calling themselves eishis should be kept. I’ve tried to clarify on the poll where the terms would be used, for all the characters or for only Jap pilots and was told it would be best to post here.  I've actually wrote this on Type-94s blog at https://type94.wordpress.com/2015/06/30/muv-luv-english-localization/#comment-130 while discussing this with him so I'll just edit and post the relevant parts here. Technically the Eishi word is a Japanese only term when written, but they adapted it to call their pilots that ingame.  Type-94 brought up a good point about international localisation, and I’m a strong advocate of that in fact. I do follow that in my work after all where I can. However, saying we support internationalisation while removing the Japanese term for pilots would be a contridiction in itself.  But then again, that said, it’s obvious that what the Japanese did in the game is the same, from the way that all the characters despite their nationality call themselves Eishis and not Pilots. This might be an example of that laziness he mentioned. But I do believe that since we are doing this anew for an international audience, the effort can be made to include both set of terms as needed. After all, its not like the vocals are going to be in English, so seeing TSF Pilot and hearing Eishi is going be more confusing in my opinion. There is an explaination by Marimo in the class regarding the usage after all.  I guess it depends on how much effort the translators put in, in the end. To me, having all terms in full American English and phrasing is equally as bad as having the terms all in Japanese, and won’t be a true effort to internationalise things.  Bottom line is, if this is a vote for what to call pilots across all characters, I'd change my vote for Pilot or TSF Pilot, because though I feel something should be done for individual characters, it'd be weirder to listen to American Pilots call themselves Eishis to other American Pilots. I really do hope that the team can put in the effort to show true international segregation by using both Eishis and Pilots when approriate for the character and context though, to provide the depth of immersion."
visualnovels,3bnive,herkz,3,Wed Jul 1 07:20:43 2015 UTC,"To me, having all terms in full American English and phrasing is equally as bad as having the terms all in Japanese, and won’t be a true effort to internationalise things.   Having it all be in any kind of English would be just as ""bad"" by your logic. As there's no neutral English used by everyone internationally, you have to pick one. And the translator is American, so he wrote in American English. Not that I know what that has to do with this discussion at all."

I can't really respond yet since I'm not sure what you meant."
visualnovels,3bnive,gabgrave,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:16:02 2015 UTC,"Well, my post was regarding the use of Eishi for Japanese TSF pilots only, so that's the context. Japanese pilots speaking to other Japanese should use Eishi, while American pilots speaking to other Americans should use Pilot or Surface Pilot."
visualnovels,3bnive,herkz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:36:36 2015 UTC,"They also speak to each other in Japanese instead of English, which we can't keep. And in reverse, Japanese players of the game missed some cultural context for stuff the American characters in the game do (possibly even due to ignorance on the writers' parts). It's just an inevitable fact that you can't keep cultural context up between languages and culture. That's quite literally the entire reason people localize things.   Now, if you want to use some different word for Japanese pilots, be my guest. I just don't see why it has to be eishi."
visualnovels,3bnive,gabgrave,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:43:42 2015 UTC,"I agree that the writer can only write familiarly about the culture he's from. However, what we have now is more than that, it's a collaboration between two different cultures, and I feel that where possible the context and tone of the original culture should be explained and kept for the readers, without being obnoxious.  The term Eishi was originally meant to name those who protect or defend, which is what the ingame characters from Japan view themselves, being on the line between their countrymen and gruesome death. For a IRL reason why Eishi though, it's because Kouki-san called it that when he created the series. Removing it would be reducing the creative content I think."
visualnovels,3bnive,NRidley,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:18:06 2015 UTC,"I just don't see how ""eishi"" is some special word that shouldn't be translated. There are tons of terms in the game like that.

visualnovels,3bnive,Jmaisonet,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:19:48 2015 UTC,"As mentioned, Eishi should be translated where it makes sense, eg when used out of the Japanese context or during context neutral narration.

visualnovels,3bnive,hakimiru,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:41:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure how to word this, but that kind of way of displaying characterization is sort of stupid. The readers can obviously already tell the characters are Japanese; there doesn't need to be some untranslated word you have to explain to show that. And I mentioned this in some other thread, but just leaving one word untranslated doesn't really do much of anything. If they asked if people wanted some full-scale changes to how the Japanese characters talk, etc., there wouldn't be a problem IMO. I wouldn't prefer making all of their lines more ""Japanese,"" but that would still be better than this. Currently, it's just dumb fanservice for weeaboos that really changes nothing.  In the end, I feel all of this debate is for naught as it's merely a distraction from the bigger issue of TL quality, and I find it really unlikely the script will be changed much if at all."

visualnovels,3bk8o0,Taedirk,16,Mon Jun 29 22:16:00 2015 UTC,Maybe one day we'll get a major announcement that isn't a kickstarter. One day...  EDIT: Official site http://muvluv.degica.com
visualnovels,3bk8o0,subarashiisekai,21,Mon Jun 29 22:19:14 2015 UTC,"KS becoming non-standard in the VN market is going to be a long ways off. The VN scene is still pretty damn unstable, and there is a big risk in putting out a VN due to the high chance of it flopping and never turning a profit.   Kickstarter mitigates that issue entirely, which is why it is used so often. If the KS fails, the only money/time you wasted was whatever it took to get into talks with the Japanese developers. In the current state of the market, it's just far too attractive for companies to rely on KS to ensure that the game makes a profit.  This is just how it's going to be, atleast until VN's cease being a niche market. Which I don't see happening any time soon."
visualnovels,3bk8o0,ShinoAsada0,5,Tue Jun 30 00:42:03 2015 UTC,I find it hard to believe the market is as unstable as they'd have us believe when every kickstarter seems to hit its deadline in a single day and games are being stripped apart to meet Steam's standards where apparently they sell like hotcakes.
visualnovels,3bk8o0,subarashiisekai,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:48:21 2015 UTC,"when every kickstarter seems to hit its deadline in a single day    That simply doesn't happen.  The Human Reignition Project took multiple days to hit 100%.  Walkerman is likely not even going to get funded  Memory's Dogma took four days to get funded.  Mind you, all of these are sekai project Kiockstarters. The sheer popularity SP has will boost up the pledge rates for their kickstarters by a large amount, likely far above any other VN translators out there. Walkerman is closer to what most VN's look like on kickstarter, it goes unknown and unnoticed for pretty much the entire campaign. If that project somehow gets 50% more funding in the next tree days (Which I doubt), it will be entirely because SP picked up the series and started advertising for them about a week ago."
visualnovels,3bk8o0,ShinoAsada0,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:16:45 2015 UTC,So what you're saying is all but one of these kickstarters has been hugely successful? Is that what you're saying?
visualnovels,3bk8o0,subarashiisekai,10,Tue Jun 30 08:43:29 2015 UTC,"Was just about to post this, so hyped going to back the hell out of this.  Edit: Hope they use the PS3 assets like the Clannad Kickstarter."
visualnovels,3bk8o0,Aexis_Skyen,2,Mon Jun 29 22:17:35 2015 UTC,"Clannad Kickstarter are even better than PS3 : 1280x960 Hope they will do something similar. I mean playing the game in 1024x600 won't be that bad, but still it's pointless starting KS if they won't upgrade graphics, but that's my opinion (PS3 ports or even better)"
visualnovels,3bk8o0,Maxelek,2,Mon Jun 29 23:26:16 2015 UTC,"On Clannad Kickstarter they did use the PS3 assets, the thing is they were 1280x960 natively but were cropped to 1280x720 in order to have widescreen on the PS3.  Here is the same thing, the PS3 version of Muv-Luv probably has 1280x960 assets but cropped to 1280x720. Anyway really hope they do this."
visualnovels,3bk8o0,Aexis_Skyen,9,Mon Jun 29 23:32:10 2015 UTC,"Holy freaking spoilers Batman. Stay away from the descriptions if you haven't read the visual novel yet!  That being said, this is pretty awesome. Muv-Luv is such a masterpiece... I hope they fix some of the issues Extra/Unlimited have on windows 8 by the way. Ever since I installed win 8, I haven't been able to start Extra/Unlimited. Alternative runs perfectly fine though."

Seems odd that a company that doesn't have anything significant in the market (at least from what I could tell from the steam page) suddenly pops up and goes ""oh yeah, we got one of the Holy Grail's of visual novels for official translation."
visualnovels,3bk8o0,Karakkan,8,Mon Jun 29 23:55:46 2015 UTC,"Please let this work out, I really need a version of Muv Luv that actually works on something higher than Windows 7."

I hold no respect for projects like this since all they do is reuse the existing translations.  Some of us actually bought the originals already and would rather see a kickstarter for non translated games, like say Baldr Sky."
visualnovels,3bk8o0,Daitelion,7,Mon Jun 29 23:35:51 2015 UTC,Give me Baldr... Would pay 200$ :|
visualnovels,3bk8o0,Maxelek,18,Mon Jun 29 23:57:46 2015 UTC,"I hold respect for these projects because they help turn the tide in our favor.  Muv-Luv Alternative is the #1 rated VN on VNDB, but in the west, your average gamer in more likely to encounter Sakura Spirits than Muv-Luv because Muv-Luv isn't on Steam.  Getting the popular titles on Steam is a very good thing because it can create and - more importantly - demonstrate demand for quality visual novels.  You want Baldr Sky?  Me too.  Why should they bother licensing a localization though?  What evidence is there that it would be worth their while?  That's what these high profile localizations are good for, even if we've already read them.  Besides, if you pledge in the Kickstarter, chances are you're getting the game as a reward, so they aren't going to be asking for more money on Steam from you."
visualnovels,3bk8o0,ScarsUnseen,4,Tue Jun 30 01:22:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that, they don't sell that well on steam, at least Sakura Spirit is $10, it gets bought as a joke or to make videos. Looking forward to Extra for $40 and Alternative for $50 with 100 peak concurrent players (the backers) and 20 steam reviews.    Why should they bother licensing a localization though? What evidence is there that it would be worth their while?    None, there's no way actually translating games would be worth their while, that would take real work, after all.  All the dirty work being done by fans is the sole reason these kickstarters even exist."
visualnovels,3bk8o0,Daitelion,5,Tue Jun 30 01:35:07 2015 UTC,"None, there's no way actually translating games would be worth their while, that would take real work, after all.  All the dirty work being done by fans is the sole reason these kickstarters even exist.   And yet Clannad is getting a retranslation."
visualnovels,3bk8o0,Cornetto_Man,-6,Tue Jun 30 02:04:21 2015 UTC,"Clannad's ""retranslation"" is a redressing, nothing more."
visualnovels,3bk8o0,subarashiisekai,9,Tue Jun 30 08:02:50 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure clannads original translation was practically a machine translation. I imagine that is quite a bit more than a ""redressing:."
visualnovels,3bk8o0,ShinoAsada0,-12,Tue Jun 30 08:33:11 2015 UTC,"The ""re-translation"" has progressed 75% in only a few months. Clannad is a massive VN. This figure would be impossible if it were a retranslation from scratch. Whatsmore, SP already confirmed Doki was a partner of their's back when the kickstarter started."
visualnovels,3bk8o0,subarashiisekai,10,Tue Jun 30 08:42:41 2015 UTC,"I don't feel the need to be that cynical, a steam release will enable a different audience to play the game that otherwise probably would not have. Simply requiring the initiative to track down and properly install the game is a huge barrier for many people.  Also perhaps this release might fix some of the longstanding compatibility issues with the engine? Although I guess that's probably too optimistic.  Regardless, any exposure that Muv Luv can get makes me happy."

visualnovels,3bk8o0,Daitelion,8,Tue Jun 30 00:46:37 2015 UTC,"Those who spend money for a ""guaranteed"" working product through official sources and those who download unofficial cracked versions are generally different people is all I'm saying.  I agree that selling a decade old series for ~$50 would be ridiculous but it looks like the majority of this publishers releases on steam are between $30 and $5. So who knows."
visualnovels,3bk8o0,Thatdamnnoise,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:58:17 2015 UTC,"Most of the games they publish are indie games sold on comiket and such though, hence the price, not big releases like MLA."
visualnovels,3bk8o0,Daitelion,5,Tue Jun 30 01:38:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, either way you look at it this announcement is a very good thing. The fact that this company is even thinking about anything outside of Japan means they noticed the success of Clannad and Grisaia, not to mention other VNs. Instead of shitting on it maybe you should support it? Who knows what the future brings ? Maybe if this is successful Baldr Sky will get a translation? Releasing a official translation of Muv-Luv is a great way to start because it's highly regarded and popular."
visualnovels,3bk8o0,MotivatedRed,9,Tue Jun 30 01:53:39 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from, but there are people who haven't gotten a chance to play this masterpiece, and this will make it much more accessible. As for reusing the existing translation, why start from scratch when you already have a translation ready?"
visualnovels,3bk8o0,joebro5000,4,Tue Jun 30 00:30:33 2015 UTC,"As for reusing the existing translation, why start from scratch when you already have a translation ready?    That's the thing, why do you think they always go for translated works? Actually translating something would take time and effort, let's make a pretty kickstarter page with nice stretch goals, drop the game on steam and call it a day instead  I also question the accessibility, it's easier for me to talk a friend into reading a VN while giving him a download link, than it is for me to talk him into buying it for $40~50 on steam.  Just take a look at how grisaia is doing, 137 all time peak on steam charts,  these numbers aren't 100% accurate, but they do offer a decent representation of how big the western VN market is."
visualnovels,3bk8o0,Daitelion,4,Tue Jun 30 00:41:47 2015 UTC,I really wished that the Grisaia steamspy page wasn't hidden by SP/FW. I'm interested in the number of owners. The number of peak users is less informative.
visualnovels,3bk8o0,NRidley,2,Tue Jun 30 02:36:30 2015 UTC,Agreed.
visualnovels,3bk8o0,Daitelion,7,Tue Jun 30 03:12:55 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying about previously translated works, and it makes sense. However part of me wants to think that they really do care about giving people what they want, not just lazily making money.  About accessibility, as far as I know, there isn't really a good place to download Muv Luv anymore, and unless you're playing on Windows 7 or lower, the game will crash. Also, maybe I'm just a noob, but it took more than a download link for me to play Muv Luv. I had to deal with disc mounting and system locale issues that actually caused me a fair amount of trouble. I woud've much rather just paid for it and download it hassle-free. Again, maybe I'm just an idiot, but it seems easier to have an official release.   Aslo, about Grisaia, it's possible that some people (myself included) are waiting for the uncensored release on Denpasoft. Then again, maybe there really isn't a lot of use for an already translated game being on steam.   I guess I just really want an official release of the Muv Luv series, and I'll take what I can get. This is all just my dumb opinion though."
visualnovels,3bk8o0,joebro5000,3,Tue Jun 30 00:54:51 2015 UTC,Nobody buys the games before they play them. There are seriously maybe three of you (not to mention most people buy old used copies that do nothing for their sales anyway). This is a chance for them actually to make anything off of it and possibly use fan response as a springboard for other MLA sidestories to get TLed. How is this anything but a positive?
visualnovels,3bk8o0,lraudio,0,Tue Jun 30 03:38:37 2015 UTC,"Nobody buys the games before they play them.    Exactly, no one will drop $50+ (likely more considering you need to buy extra then MLA unless they make some kind of bundle) on a blind visual novel purchase in the west, making the ""accesibility"" point moot.  Also I bought Muvluv after beating the game."
visualnovels,3bk8o0,Daitelion,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:43:25 2015 UTC,Completely Agree.  I really wish these teams would do kickstarters for games that haven't been translated.  I don't see the purpose in translating the same game twice when the quality of the first translation is just fine.   Give us something new like Baldr or Soukou Akki Muramasa and you'll get my money.

I'm looking forward to hearing more about it before I get excited about the possibilities, but wow.    EDIT, some random thoughts:  If they're using Ixrec's translation, that pretty much leaves... what exactly to Kickstart? Surely they'll want plenty of money for the voice acting licenses... all so that we get two VNs that are already (albeit illegitimately) available to us? What's different here from the Grisaia trilogy KS is how we were promised the sequels, both of which aren't translated yet. Here, they don't seem to be offering us anything of the sort. Perhaps if they promised MLA Total Eclipse or their new VN Schwarzesmarken I'd be plenty excited already. Selfish thinking, I know, but food for thought. I'll be awaiting more information before I really decide how I feel about this, regardless."
visualnovels,3bk8o0,LeafCascade,19,Mon Jun 29 22:23:36 2015 UTC,"A few reasons to get excited:   If they're localising it, hopefully they'll also fix some of the compatibility issues with the more recent versions of Windows. If the kickstarter and overall sales go well, you can be certain that translations for Total Eclipse and Schwarzesmarken will come.  It's good news for us consumers if there's a little more competition to the localisation industry, just in case any other companies crash and burn (not that I think it's likely, but it's good to have alternatives)."
visualnovels,3bk8o0,The_Bunny_Advocate,4,Mon Jun 29 23:10:44 2015 UTC,"Good points. I'm trying to think about this from an average VN readers perspective, though. It's all just hypothetical though, so bear with me.  The most dedicated VN readers have probably already read the Muv-Luv trilogy. They wouldn't care much for any technical fixes as it's pointless to them.   The most dedicated VN readers are probably also those who are willing to shell out large amounts of money to get highly regarded VNs localized. What happens when they've already read the games being talked about, without getting hints at future projects that'll they'll perceive as being personally beneficial to them? The fact that this Kickstarter's success will determine whether or not further games get localized makes it all especially bad, since they probably won't mention any further plans at this stage. It'd be blind faith on ""our"" side - we'd throw our money at them in hopes of -maybe- getting a chance of more age games being localized.  I eagerly await more information; this is all pretty exciting regardless. :)"

I agree that as someone who has already read Muv-luv, a technical fix is a fairly low priority, but it'll be nice if I want to replay it in a few years when I have a newer version of windows that it may not otherwise have worked with.

Yep, that's certainly a concern, especially if they consider some of the other runaway KS successes like Grisaia or Clannad to be the norm rather than what may have been exceptions and so set their target too high. But MLA is MLA, I'm sure there will be a good number of backers even without teasing us with other VNs (:   I eagerly await more information, this is all pretty exciting regardless. :)   Yep, I'm pretty excited too (:"

visualnovels,3bk8o0,Silvertongue00,6,Mon Jun 29 23:05:49 2015 UTC,Probably realized they'd have to pay someone tons of money to translate it. It's an extremely long game.
visualnovels,3bk8o0,herkz,2,Mon Jun 29 23:20:17 2015 UTC,I would easily say money. the main Trilogy makes more money simple as that.
visualnovels,3bk8o0,theglob1981,2,Mon Jun 29 23:07:57 2015 UTC,I hope they do bring Rumbling Hearts/Nozomo Eien VN to the west eventually since I liked the anime.  If they promise to bring it I will more likely support the Muv-Luv trio (though I probably will anyway)
visualnovels,3bk8o0,superange128,3,Mon Jun 29 23:18:43 2015 UTC,"My concern about this project is whether if western audiences are willing to play through Muv Luv in order to get to the other two games, especially MLA.  People who are familiar with VNs are aware of the hype surrounding MLA and many can live with the ten hours or less required for reading Muv Luv, but what about everyone else?  Although it'd be nice if more people could play MLA, that would probably open up the market even more.  One question: are any of age's other games even any good? They've been riding the MLA train for...ages."

For years I've waited for this. An official English localization release. I've continued working through 14 hour workdays and done everything I could to promote the franchise, all for this day...and it's finally here.  What this means is that Age/Ixtl/Kouki has finally decided to acknowledge beyond a doubt that Muv-Luv has a wider audience outside of Japan. It means that they have changed their minds regarding NOT releasing ML/MLA in English before KGNE, which was what befelled the Amaterasu team here: http://amaterasu.tindabox.net/blog/?p=962  We have gotten the first step in. It's D-Day. What comes after depends on whether a beachhead can be established, how well received this kick-starter is.  I've checked out the Degica company, and they are an established export company for Japanese franchises, and isn't new to the game industry, with several games under their belt for consoles and PC. Already seems more professional than Mangagamers, to me.  Let's not screw this up people, depending on our response, this could lead up to more releases, include an official English non-steam release of Win7/10 Muv-Luv Alternative non-censored edition in the years ahead. I'd put down a grand for that.  I'll be doing my part. Will you?"

Is this one of those ""I don't like it when companies business in ways companies didn't used to business"" things?"
visualnovels,3bk8o0,Panhead369,2,Tue Jun 30 01:30:55 2015 UTC,"I'm was fine with the occasional KS but it's becoming too commonplace now. Honestly, it's just a large gamble since you're paying them upfront. I've been lucky to not have backed any projects that was never completed but that's just one of the worries. You also have to pray the quality of the finished product is up to your standards. Everything looks great in the pitch but you never know until the end if you've just wasted money. Seeing a finished product allows me to make an informed choice on if I want too spend my money.   In the end, it doesn't matter. It's just my opinion. I'll let the eager backers back the projects. If I like the finished product, I'll support it then."
visualnovels,3bk8o0,rainmusique,2,Tue Jun 30 01:44:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I've already read the trilogy and Altered Fable and this makes me very excited that I might be able to share it with friends.  I feel like there might be an anti-""normies"" thing underlying the negativity? VNs are kind of special to the English-speaking audience at the moment because they're the niche of the niche. You see this kind of thing in lots of communities. I play games like Victoria and Hearts of Iron and many people are reacting very negatively to some of the news coming out about the new HoI 4 because it is making a lot of changes to reduce micromanagement and improve accessibility to a broader audience, but those changes aren't necessarily inherently bad. Making visual novels a thing in the West isn't necessarily a bad thing either. If we can convince good writers that there's a market here, we could see a lot of great works, original English novels or non-.  There are also concerns about shitty translations, which I think can be warranted, but FFS we don't need to nitpick every possible bad outcome of every event. Kickstarters to legally bring classic VNs to the English language are a hell of a lot better than no official translations at all, from my perspective.  In short, let's be a welcoming community that supports the entrance of any earnest newcomers and let one of the most impactful stories in media reach a larger audience."
visualnovels,3bk8o0,Blue3clipse,2,Tue Jun 30 02:01:49 2015 UTC,"That's great news. Muv Luv is one of the most beloved titles in the English-speaking community. It's consistently held up as the best there is, and it gets recommended to everyone. Now the people who hear about how great it is and want to see what the hype is about might actually buy it instead of pirating it somewhere. Existing fans will get the chance to support the creators. And if it goes on Steam then it'll reach a whole new, bigger audience.  I've heard people say Muv Luv is an impossibly expensive license, along with Baldr Sky and Type-Moon stuff. People also used to say KEY games will never be officially released in the west. It's exciting to see big-name titles like Muv Luv, Clannad and Grisaia get licensed. Hopefully that means something like Baldr Sky getting released over here isn't just a pipe dream.  Since I'm currently playing Muv Luv right now, I certainly feel obligated to contribute to the Kickstarter. Hope it goes well!"

Many Japanese companies are still reeling from the Rapelay crap and lets be honest the country still doesn't have the best reputation amongst westerners. You still hear shit about ""Japan is so weird"" from people. Sure attitudes are starting to change but that's only happened recently.   Plus the most important fact you highlighted yourself.

Then the fan translation came out in the middle of that and age jumped ship, probably because they thought the market would be too saturated by the fan translation to make a profit. It wasn't the best decision, but it is understandable.

Heck when Fate was announced they got thousands of requests from those who can read raw alone that they turned down.  They where quite aware that there was a market in the west considering how many can not read raw its a enormous market that strangles itsself by moral standards since steam is two goody too shoes (at least they think they are) to let h games onto steam where games that have extensive gore where you cut peoples limbs of or playing a pychopath that murders people for the heck of it are ok."

visualnovels,3bk8o0,Cornetto_Man,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:30:04 2015 UTC,"I hope there is a physical all ages release considering the 18+ version of Extra would almost definitely be illegal in Canada (maybe Alternative too) and the H-content was straight up terrible outside of one scene in Alternative.   Looking forward to more localised âge titles in the future if this does well, it's good to see them testing the waters with ML. I would definitely buy Kimi ga Nozumu Eien or Schwarzesmarken if they got a western release."

visualnovels,3bidrq,ShinoAsada0,8,Mon Jun 29 15:21:31 2015 UTC,I should stop buying anything MG releases on Steam and just wait for the bundles. Eden's been out less than half a year. Higurashi's only a little over a month.

visualnovels,3bidrq,jfietkau,3,Mon Jun 29 14:21:27 2015 UTC,"5 VNs in this bundle in total. Not all of them are good, but the price makes it a no-brainer.  If anyone here has played X-note, I'd be curious to hear about your experience."
visualnovels,3bidrq,summer_petrichor,7,Mon Jun 29 14:51:33 2015 UTC,"Warning: wall of text incoming. Might want to skip to the end to see the list where I state aspects that some people might not like in their visual novels.   Edit 3: here's the demo for the game to try out and see for yourself  Hi there! I cleared X-note about 2 days back, I think; all the endings and whatnot.   In terms of quality, I think it's pretty good. I haven't played the highly recommended ones like Umineko, but I think that while X-note might fall short of those, it's still good in its own right.   In this game you play as Essi, a psychic who's enlisted to investigate in the murder case at Xen Institute and to figure out her own mother's death years back. While it's officially promoted as an Otome game, Zeiva (the developer) doesn't do overly romantic stuff so I think guys should be able to play it without much problem. Of course you get to 'go after' guys in this game, but romance is more of a side plot than the main plot, and even so it isn't gushy or eyeball-rolling-inducing.  Having played through it myself, I found X-note to be very enjoyable. Essi is an easily likable heroine, a little naive (not an idiot though) and and the obtainable guys, Yuon, Oure and Anon are charming in their own right. At first glance it looks like a cliché Otome game with Yuon being the kuudere, Oure being the cute shota and Anon the joker pervert, but Zeiva pretty much deconstructs them in their own routes. In Zeiva's own words, they've never ""made a typical Otome game anyway"".  That being said, some points that I need to bring up for people who have certain 'criteria' before they start playing:   no auto-scroll of text. Some reviewers have complained about this. As Zeiva primarily uses Flash to program their games instead of programs like Ren'py, their games may lack functions that other games do. If you cannot stand Flash based games, move on.  this is a stat-raising game, where it is necessary to raise the stats of the heroine in order to clear the game. People who dislike stat-raising or mini games, move on. Stat-raising in this game comes in the form of mini-games, while not very difficult, can prove to be frustrating for repeat players wanting to clear all the endings in-game. I strongly recommend looking at the guide posted by Zeiva on their website that states what stats to raise and when to raise them, for those looking for particular endings. Also recommended to save the game before starting the mini-games so that if you fail (5 tries) just reload the game and try again.  people who absolutely cannot stand Otome games, no matter amount of romance involved, should probably move on too.    Hope I helped! And I'm not related to Zeiva, this is just a friendly review by a player :)  Edit: While X-note is pretty great, the next entry in the series, Area-X, far exceeds the standards set by X-note. Area-X is a sci-fi time travelling dystopian Otome game, and is even more fun than X-note.   Edit 2: fun fact - quite a number of people have asked Zeiva to remove Otome from their games since their games contain very little romance (but a lot on chemistry), and this number also includes guys lol"

visualnovels,3bidrq,KingMoonfish,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:16:43 2015 UTC,"Actually it makes a lot of sense for some items.

I'd say it's the fact that they are decent and from a well known VN series that they are doing so well. It's a shame that they might be knocking out better developed, but lesser known couples."

As for Kazuki, I expect it was a freak result as she was the last Grisaia girl for fans to rally around once they'd lost all their other options.

visualnovels,3bjp8b,GregerMoek,2,Wed Jul 1 00:03:49 2015 UTC,"I am so torn between the Fate couples. I -personally- would probably prefer Saber or Rin. Mostly because they have 'fun' potential. They seem more open to banter/pranks and general activities. Sakura is like a quiet housemaid(yes I know for good reasons) and every now and then she seems eager to compete, but to me she really only has 'feels' potential and doesn't seem to really be long-term fun.  Story wise I think Rin or Sakura makes most sense. Sakura because you know she's a sad panda and Rin because it actually seems like Shirou could have fun with her. Not just ""feels"" but actually have a good time. Sakura is just feels, and in her route Shirou manages to abandon his ""ideals"", but who says he wouldn't be able to do this with Rin too even if it didn't happen in UBW specifically? Oh well, I am probably overthinking this, but since Rin was in both categories(my preferences and what I think fits Shirou best) I guess I will have to choose her if they're ever matched against one another.  Having to choose between Yamato+Miyako and Saber+Shirou is even tougher... I will have to flip a coin. The stories are so different. It's easier to compare two couples from the same series, especially if one of the characters is the same in both examples."

It's too bad that Hisui and Shiki lost, but F/SN is just so much more popular than Tsukihime...."

As an actual couple, Shiki and Kohaku are probably the worst in Tsukihime, it's just Kohaku is the best girl in my mind. If I were to place a bet on who'd get the furthest if it were just the Tsukihime pairings, I'd go for Akiha or Hisui.  Conversely, I don't like Yumiko from Grisaia much as a character, but I think she has the second-best dynamic as a couple with Yuuji, after Sachi.

All year people were getting these occasional announcements that were basically nothing. ""Look artists of other series drew a bunch of Index characters"", stuff like that. Finally shortly before the anniversary there was an animated trailer to hype it up. It showed characters from every single one of the author's works, including Index characters from the most recent books at the time. People were getting incredibly hyped for an Index III anime announcement, or at least something fantastic for Index.   Instead they announced an anime for one of the author's other works, Heavy Object. People flipped, and rightfully so. If they had not spent all year hyping up this announcement, associating it with Index, and giving a bunch of small disappointing announcements in between people might have been excited about it. Even fans of the Heavy Object series were disappointed. It was a PR disaster."

That's precisely what I'm worried about in this case; the fact that it's coming from Aksys rather than Japan suggests to me that, even if it's ZE3-related, it's likely to be a Kickstarter or something.  Zero Escape is more popular here, and it didn't do well enough to warrant 3 right away, so a Shenmue-3-like thing wouldn't be surprising.  I'd hope not though, as this would not be how you should reveal such a project (or anything, really).  We'll find out."

visualnovels,3bj9lq,moogy0,9,Mon Jun 29 18:02:10 2015 UTC,"Been rereading Subahibi, since I read it over five years ago and wasn't very good at Japanese then.  I honestly have issues with the way it's written nowadays; the easiest way to describe it is that SCA-Ji's Japanese is simply not very ""clean."" In general it's hard to say that the text is pleasing on an aesthetic level, since there are tons of quirks and many awkward phrasings or lines that don't flow well in context. That said, it does seem to start improving the further you get into the game - you can tell that SCA-Ji wrote it over a rather long period of time and grew as a writer in the process. There's also a huge amount of text copy/pasted from the original Tsui no Sora (1999) in the earlier chapters, which doesn't help.  Anyway, I finished both endings of Invention last night. Despite my complaints with the writing, Subahibi definitely has a certain ""magic"" that is all its own. Everything with Kimika toward the end of Invention is great, in particular. Hopefully the mediocre text doesn't end up impacting my score too much, because there's definitely some great stuff here.  edit: fucking bot"

Got to what feels like halfway through the Hinahime arc. More and more the game's central themes have been coming into focus. Theme semi-spoilers  Theme semi-spoilers2   Since the game is largely about the growth of characters, one thing I really like the balance it strikes in pacing the character development... Things aren't usually 'too easy' in that it takes only a couple of kind words from someone and suddenly all their longtime ways of thinking and outlooks are changed for the better... and there are various setbacks and false starts...   But it also doesn't belabor the point and lets them start making improvements without too much delay. Sometimes it's a bit rushed, but I'd rather have things progress a bit faster than not.

visualnovels,3bj9lq,mdzjdz,5,Mon Jun 29 21:38:47 2015 UTC,"I finished reading Sumire. I wrote about it more in-depth in my review of it, but to put shortly, it's a work that tries to do far too much in the time it's given. It doesn't properly develop its parts properly to the point of not making them seem negligible, then tries to tie them to a grand whole through means of a sudden revelation. The parts in themselves (the routes up to the true route) ranged in quality from being decent/passable, to being incredibly boring to read.   This is made worse by the fact that there's no real conclusion to the series. Sumire had an interesting concept, but a plain bad execution of it.     Began my read of Parfait.  I came into this game expecting a comedic, slice-of-life orientated work. This doesn't seem to be the case. I think that like every other Maruto work, there's a great deal of character development & of drama. It's just that in comparison with this later works (e.g. WA2 & DameKoi), the drama's significantly less grand. The general 'Maruto mood' seems to be prevalent within this work. He seems to really enjoy writing his confession scenes (and certain h-scenes).   I've finished Yui's route so far, and I'm continuing on Rea's route. To my knowledge, there's not an overtly-obvious canon ending (or route) to this work. I hope that doesn't negatively affect the read. While canon routes primarily serve to properly tell or orient story-focused works, I think that Parfait (first-and-foremost a 'character game') has enough story (through means of theme, backstory, and a suggested direction) to warrant one.   I do like how the work's paced though. It doesn't drag on needlessly. I think this is due in part to its 'micro-focuses.' Even if the plot concerns slice-of-life at the restaurant/bakery, the slice-of-life is 'focused' (e.g. working first to stabilize the restaurant, working to prepare for holiday 1, working to prepare for holiday 2, and so forth). This is bolstered by the fact that the cast is affable as a whole.  My only complaint with the work thus far is that some of the heroines are entirely irrelevant until their routes. Indeed, Parfait seems to be structured such that two heroines share a common route, and that most of the more minor heroines outside the immediate interest of the two heroines, are mentioned or referenced in passing. While this is ameliorated lately presumably (by giving the other characters their proper development in the common routes that concern them), I feel that this is ultimately negative in that it doesn't develop a cohesive-enough 'air of family' (i.e. group chemistry)."
visualnovels,3bj9lq,aldarionar_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:23:42 2015 UTC,"Ema and Rikako routes should be saved for last, especially Rikako. For lack of a better word, these 2 routes are thicker than rest of them."
visualnovels,3bj9lq,mdzjdz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:07:21 2015 UTC,My tentative order's:  Yui-Rea-Asuka-Kasuri-?-Ema-Rikako  The ? would be for the potential minor heroines (Mizuna & Mio). Do you suggest going through tehir routes with the same energy as you would the other heroines?
visualnovels,3bj9lq,aldarionar_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:35:03 2015 UTC,I played Chocolat Second Brew Re-order version so it didn't have Mizuna and Mio. Apparently they are not written by Maruto and placement of their routes doesn't fit the overall game. Asuka and Kasuri are best routes to do at first. Yui and Rea has some common stuff so I see them as a pair. Asuka->Kasuri->Yui->Rea would be ideal but except Ema and Rikako order is not really crucial.
visualnovels,3bj9lq,mdzjdz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:09:49 2015 UTC,"I see. I already finished Rea & Yui's routes -- I noticed that they had a lot of things in common. Judging from your writing, this isn't the case with the other heroines right? That is, the other heroines don't share very similar actual routes (with skippable material).   Which route did you find to be the best-written, and which was your favorite?"
visualnovels,3bj9lq,aldarionar_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:15:50 2015 UTC,"Nope, they're all different. Ema and Rikako share some scenes before Christmas eve if that counts.  Rikako, for both of them. Just from the common route parts you can get the ""this is what i expect from Maruto"" feeling if you've played WA2 and Damekoi before. Ema's route is really great too but Rikako takes it one step higher, and I'm sure everyone will probably agree about Rikako's route being best one."
visualnovels,3bj9lq,mdzjdz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:41:07 2015 UTC,"I see.  It's just surprising how different Parfait is from initial expectations. There's a good deal of drama in this work, but I don't really see it discussed too much. The slice-of-life/comedy acts more as a side element.  It's also surprising that the titular characters (in that they're posted on the cover art) might not be the most important within the work."
visualnovels,3bj9lq,aldarionar_,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:52:39 2015 UTC,"On the west its understandable since its not translated and people who read it already are probably not vocal. (Probably discussed it long time ago) There was a group reading of it in IRC during couple weeks ago, it was fun. In EGS its one of the highest rated games though. Overall Parfait is a well made title, probably one of the best examples to eroge.  And yeah, not seeing Rikako and Ema in cover is hilarious. I guess Rea is more of an iconic character with her design. In all of the routes she reminds her existence to reader too, very prominent character overall."

But, his general writing style/direction's still there. I think that there's a lot of potential romantic turmoil within this work, more than there was in DameKoi/WA2.   But, I don't think that most of that will actually manifest. After all, this is a work regarded for its slice-of-life/comedy rather than its drama."
visualnovels,3bj9lq,AkaiDown,8,Wed Jul 1 02:44:24 2015 UTC,"Currently reading Inganock. I fell in love at first sight with Sakurai's writing. She has a very neat and clear prose based on usually short sentences and use of similar words. The way she controls the rhythm of her text is really pleasant. This is the kind of writing even a newb like me can appreciate.  I find her fight scenes especially engrossing, although I can see why people would complain about repetition, haha.  The VN is really beautiful, in a style that seems to be recurrent in Liar-Soft games (it reminded me of Forest but I suppose they have more games like that). I like its atmosphere a lot so far.   Several elements make it obvious Sakurai is taking from Utena, which pushes me to try to see exactly how she's using it and to think about the meaning behind each fight. Being a fan of Utena and the few works it inspired in animation, I'm very happy to see its influence extend to some eroge, and I'm really curious to see where she ends up leading the plot. I won't make theories before having read the whole thing though."

visualnovels,3bgfw6,mystry08,17,Mon Jun 29 00:26:41 2015 UTC,"The problem is adapting visual novels to anime is hard and not many people can do it. Unlike manga or LN adaptations, you really have to cut down on the content and most likely figure out a way to combine routes. But at the same time, you have to give fanservice to each character to insure the series is popular. Like, for the only adaptation I'd consider really good (Clannad), Kyoani did an amazing job at synthesizing all the parts of the game and boiling it down to something that's paced well and still covers most of the important parts without just going through each route one by one. This really isn't a surprise as Kyoani has some of the best anime staff in the business. And they weren't afraid to change it up a lot even if it might make die-hard fans mad. In the end, this made it an anime that stands up on its own without needing the source material to make it good."
visualnovels,3bgfw6,herkz,10,Mon Jun 29 02:33:23 2015 UTC,"And they weren't afraid to change it up a lot even if it might make die-hard fans mad.   Definitely something a great adaptation has to do, given the constraints of the medium. Being able to effectively condense a 50+ hour novel into 20 hours or so is an incredible feat.   I thought the Clannad adaptation did a great job making the warped dimensions of the characters in the VN look more natural.   On a separate note, I'm a bit afraid for the S;G Zero and Utawarerumono: False Mask adaptations. Hopefully White Fox comes through for the latter."
visualnovels,3bgfw6,ctom42,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:08:24 2015 UTC,"Considering Steins;Gate is considered one of the best VN adaptations, and by many as one of the best anime out there, I have faith in White Fox's ability to adapt VNs.   Utawarerumono also should not be much of an issue as the first anime for it did a reasonable enough job with adapting and the series tends to be rather easy. There are no routes, and the combat sections just get replaced with action scenes."
visualnovels,3bgfw6,TSolo315,2,Mon Jun 29 13:23:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the Clannad anime was an excellent adaptation. They did a great job choosing what to keep and what to cut (goodbye Kappei.)"
visualnovels,3bgfw6,Aexis_Skyen,5,Mon Jun 29 03:37:57 2015 UTC,"Clannad really managed to keep the essence of the VN while cutting a lot of stuff so it was a great adaptation. Other than Clannad, only Ef, Air in Summer and Steins;Gate were the ones that are pretty good adaptations in my book, can't tell you how disappointed I am in UBW."
visualnovels,3bgfw6,ctom42,3,Mon Jun 29 03:48:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly the only thing that disappoints me about UBW is the lack of the full chants. Aside from that I felt it was a more than competent adaptation, and really don't see where all the complaining is coming from. I guess my biggest complaint aside from that was where they decided to do the season split, but that's only a big deal for people watching as it comes out."
visualnovels,3bgfw6,Daverost,3,Mon Jun 29 13:25:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I thought UBW's adaptation was great. I'm with you on being upset that there were no full chants, though.  But adding in bits from other Fate projects to flesh out the story, as well as adding in brand new content never before seen in the Fate universe, really helped to make it a great adaptation. They could have cut out some of the redundancy of one of the pre-fight conversations, though. It was boring in the VN and it was boring in the anime. Cutting a lot of the one good romantic development/relationship in the VN was also a really big blow.  ufotable has been doing a great job with Fate. I am a little concerned about their ability to fit Heaven's Feel into a more limited amount of time than the TV series gave them, though. And also concerned about it getting too prettied up because Nasu keeps trying to make everything Realta Nua."
visualnovels,3bgfw6,ctom42,2,Mon Jun 29 13:45:53 2015 UTC,"Cutting a lot of the one good romantic development/relationship in the VN was also a really big blow.   Agreed, can't believe I forgot to mention that."
visualnovels,3bgfw6,Aexis_Skyen,2,Mon Jun 29 13:59:56 2015 UTC,"My biggest problem with the adaptation is that it is all style and no substance.   The lack of inner monologues from Shirou made him look like a typical dumb shounen hero, it's easily the most hated character from anime only viewers, while Rin on the other hand was changed to a modern tsundere. This make the chemistry from the two seem different from the VN and in my opinion much worse.  But the worse of all, is when they rush through important parts, only to add anime original scenes like that Caster episode. All in all for me it didn't capture the atmosphere of the VN, but I was able to enjoy it nonetheless for the awesome visuals."
visualnovels,3bgfw6,Aexis_Skyen,7,Mon Jun 29 18:52:36 2015 UTC,"Almost all of adaptations are made to promote the source material be it VN, LN or Manga, most of the time they don't care about the quality of the final product, since it's advertising. It's rare the cases where the adaptation surpasses or reaches the same level of the original.  Grisaia is a good example since it was butchered in every way, but still managed to gather interest in the VN."
visualnovels,3bgfw6,herkz,4,Mon Jun 29 00:57:25 2015 UTC,"Yep, exactly this. A lot of the time they don't even care if it's good (as evidenced by not hiring good staff to do it and not giving the project much money). Then again, why would they if it almost always works?"
visualnovels,3bgfw6,Aexis_Skyen,3,Mon Jun 29 02:29:45 2015 UTC,"Also keep in mind, that if the adaptation surpasses the original, no one would buy the source material."
visualnovels,3bgfw6,PuffyB_88,2,Mon Jun 29 04:59:46 2015 UTC,"The Grisaia anime being bad actually forced me to read the VN, whereas if it was a good adaption i probably wouldn't bother with the VN because I experienced the story properly already.  Its a strange case where a bad adaption can actually promote the VN more than a good adaption"
visualnovels,3bgfw6,Aexis_Skyen,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:53:43 2015 UTC,"That's exactly the point, if all the adaptations were good no one would bother with the source material, so that's why almost all of them are bad."
visualnovels,3bgfw6,Daverost,2,Mon Jun 29 18:58:56 2015 UTC,"Grisaia is a good example since it was butchered in every way, but still managed to gather interest in the VN.   Higurashi will always be the poster child of this to me. What a terrible adaptation. You know it's bad when they have to make up an arc in the second season to fix everything they screwed up in the first season so that the story still makes sense. And then they still completely botched the ending anyway.  Fortunately, MangaGamer rescued English speakers from mediocrity and we know better now."
visualnovels,3bgfw6,ctom42,7,Mon Jun 29 13:49:49 2015 UTC,"As others have said, the vast majority of adaptations of VNs, manga, LNs and anime into any of those is done for advertising purposes. Basically the main concern is to boost sales of the source material. This is why so many anime adaptations of manga or LNs happen when the series is barely started an only have enough material for a single season before ending ubruptly and never continuing, often with an anime original ending.   Sometimes when anime are adapted to another medium, such as manga, LNs, radio CDs, or VNs it is more of a spinnoff to capitalize on the populatity of the franchise. Yuki Yunna, Toradora, and Oriemo all have VNs that are basically just extra content for hardcore fans.   Angel Beats is a fairly unique case where the original anime story was acclaimed by many, but also widely criticized as rushed. There is a common but false rumor that the anime was originally intended to be 2 cour instead of 1, but in reality the number of episodes was known from the start. Maeda Jun was simply too ambitious. He had never written for anime before and was used to having as much room as he needed for his plots and characters. As a result they decided to skip over the stories of most of the cast and have a lot of side material such as manga and radio dramas to give additional details. The VN will be both addressing the issues of the anime and capitalizing on it's popularity by having a route for every single character."
visualnovels,3bgfw6,therationalpi,5,Mon Jun 29 01:13:39 2015 UTC,"I was just going to say this about Angel Beats. It's a unique case because you had a VN writer try to write an anime, and he ended up coming up with something more suited to a VN."
visualnovels,3bgfw6,Cornetto_Man,3,Mon Jun 29 02:42:26 2015 UTC,Something similar happened with the Metro video games. The author of the books wrote the story for Last Light which was a brand new story not based on any of the books. However halfway through writing it he realised that what he wanted to do was too much for a game so instead he decided to write a subdued version for the game then write the improved version as its own novel.
visualnovels,3bgfw6,hyperknees91,6,Mon Jun 29 05:34:34 2015 UTC,"Don't you just hate that? Some directors also seem to want to do a genuinely good job like the Grisaia guy for the first season, but given the episode number he was given he was probably conflicted on how to go about it in a reasonable fashion. Thankfully he adapted the second part much better and it joins the leagues of great adaptions."
visualnovels,3bgfw6,MotivatedRed,10,Mon Jun 29 03:17:08 2015 UTC,"he was probably conflicted on how to go about it in a reasonable fashion.    I had a similar impression. You could almost feel how desperate he was to preserve Angelic Howl with three episodes  8-bit: ""Here's a stick, tape, and a pack of gum. Make us Michiru's route in two episodes.""  Tenshou: ""oh...""  According to MAL, he apparently animated the second animated opening for Rewrite. Pretty cool."
visualnovels,3bgfw6,WellmadeIndochina,2,Mon Jun 29 03:52:57 2015 UTC,"For me at least, the anime adaptation of Clannad drew me to VNs. This was around the same time as the Clannad Kickstarter that I was watching Clannad so I was very curious what a VN was since it was source material for the anime. I looked into the kickstarter, backed it, and then started to read my first VN ( Sharin no Kuni, Himawari no Shoujo). After finishing that VN I was hooked. At the very least it can draw more people to the VN."
visualnovels,3bgfw6,MotivatedRed,2,Mon Jun 29 02:48:00 2015 UTC,"I believe the Clannad adaptation was much better done than the VN itself.

I know it's somewhat recommended to read Higurashi before Umineko, but I've also heard that it's nothing too major, so as long as there aren't any major spoilers, I'm okay with playing Umineko before finishing Higurashi, but that's not the problem. Will having to alternate between the two as they're released make them harder to follow?  EDIT: Also, purely as speculation, do you think this will affect the speed of the Higurashi Hou translations, or will it not have much of an impact considering they've already got a good base translation?"
visualnovels,3bf065,LeafCascade,3,Sun Jul 5 09:47:20 2015 UTC,"Will having to alternate between the two as they're released make them harder to follow?   Yes... don't do that.

visualnovels,3bf065,ConfuzzledKoala,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:35:18 2015 UTC,"Well it's a bit too late for that in regards to Higurashi, as I've already played Ch.1 (and don't really want to wait for all 8/14 chapters to continue it), but I can probably do that for Umineko. I guess now the question would be should I just play Umineko once all of the episodes are out (presumably in between Higurashi chapters), or wait until both games have been fully released to start (which probably won't be for a few years)?  Thanks for the advice."
visualnovels,3bf065,Bobemmo,2,Sun Jul 5 11:53:40 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry too much about waiting or not.  They were originally released episodically, so it's not like it's some crazy unusual thing that will end up ruining the story or anything.  They both have a lot of mysteries and things to figure out, so you can use the downtime between episodes to think about it, or discuss theories with other people who are also following along episodically.  Just be wary of spoilers"
visualnovels,3bf065,Vrachos,2,Sun Jul 5 13:59:30 2015 UTC,or discuss theories with other people who are also following along episodically.   I'd love it if there was a group readthrough of Higurashi and Umineko to discuss things with people during the break between episodes.

Swan Song is also pretty good though.    Neither of them have the exact same atmosphere as Saya no Uta, because SnU is very surreal. Swan Song and especially KnS are horror and therefore really emphasize realism.    I do know that Chaos;Head has some delusion-related thing integrated into the novel, so if you're explicitly looking for something surreal it might be a good pick.

visualnovels,3bf065,The_Bunny_Advocate,8,Fri Jul 3 18:28:19 2015 UTC,/u/The_Bunny_Advocate pretty much summed up our stance on this incident. Honestly we'd like to distance ourselves from all the drama going on recently. It has nothing to do with us and we'd prefer to keep it that way.

However, no matter how many times I try to follow their instructions, I can't seem to get my VNDS app to actually recognize the VNDS files.  If anybody has any advice on what I may be doing wrong, it would be very appreciated. Some info:  I have a copy of F/SN, and have used the most recent converter to create a VNDS file.  At least as far as I know.  I have used explorer to copy the VNDS file onto my android, into a ""vnds"" folder I created in the /emulated/0/ directory.  I have installed the ""VNDS interpreter"" apk.    I have refreshed and forcequit the app countless times.    My phone recognizes the files (in the music app, pictures app, etc.) so the files are on my phone.  What gives?"

I care about the girls reaction, but when i skip everything but the heroine, all i get is moaning. I want to save as much time as possible with H scenes, does anyone have any tips?  I was thinking that there is usually some good dialog after the protag cums, and usually before insertation, but i dont have enough experience to confirm this. i've only seen a couple h scenes.

visualnovels,3bf065,Cornetto_Man,2,Fri Jul 3 09:31:27 2015 UTC,Generally it's saved automatically as a different file. So in games with route locks you can usually load a save at the lock and pick the new choice. None of that matters in Grisaia though since there's no locked routes.
visualnovels,3bf065,ScarsUnseen,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:10:48 2015 UTC,"So, even if I don't have my Makina route saved, I'll still have access to all the Extra stuff I unlocked?"

visualnovels,3bf065,Cornetto_Man,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:55:04 2015 UTC,"Okay, then I guess the second question is whether or not it's feasible to go from the Mangagamer Steam release of Chapter 1 to a patched Japanese copy for the subsequent chapters."
visualnovels,3bf065,LoliPits,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:14:32 2015 UTC,You mean go from the new one to MG's old versions? There will be a notable drop in quality but if you use the Tweaks then you should be okay. It would be best to wait for the new releases but if you can't then use these to make the original releases somewhat better.
visualnovels,3bf065,Cornetto_Man,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:23:21 2015 UTC,"Ah, so Mangagamer already had a version of the VN chapters available.  Okay.  It's hard for me to tell because their website always gives me a 403(forbidden) error when I try to visit.  Possibly because I'm in Japan."
visualnovels,3bf065,timemon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:43:34 2015 UTC,They did but as far as I know they took them all down when their partnership with 07th Expansion ran out. The website problem is because you're in Japan. Since uncensored eroge can't be sold in Japan. So right now they can't be acquired legally in english.
visualnovels,3bf065,Cornetto_Man,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:52:48 2015 UTC,"When you say uncensored eroge can't be sold in Japan, do you mean that if I get one out of Japan I can get H CGs without pixels? I was under the impression that for visual novels H CGs are made pixelized and those without pixels are redrawn by other people. Is this correct?"
visualnovels,3bf065,LoliPits,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:07:02 2015 UTC,"Depends on the release but generally there's no pixels. Usually the CGs are drawn uncensored then censored with pixels after. So if the company still has the uncensored CGs then the western release can be without pixels. Sometimes their redrawn but for most of MangaGamer's releases for example come from the original company.   Edit: For example, here's a CG from MG's release of Ultimate Boob Wars (NSFW obviously)."

visualnovels,3bf065,AkaiDown,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:58:07 2015 UTC,"Not for Grisaia I believe. Last I heard FrontWing didn't have the uncensored CGs. Also Steam doesn't allow 18+ content so the 18+ Grisaia will only be available from DenpaSoft, Sekai's 18+ sister company."

Also, I'm looking for moege/light hearted VN to read. Sadly, a lot of them are untranslated :(. I really like stuffs like PE and my girlfriend is the president. (Currently reading If My Heart Had Wings)"
visualnovels,3bf065,AkaiDown,4,Thu Jul 2 15:15:35 2015 UTC,"There's really no way of knowing due to many different factors. The size of the VN, the difficulty of the Japanese, the number of staff working on it, if it's a fan TL the amount of free time the translator has, the competency of the translator. Then some projects can get stalled at certain points and take even longer.  Try ShiniKiss and Shuffle."
visualnovels,3bf065,LoliPits,6,Thu Jul 2 15:26:14 2015 UTC,How is the length of a VN actually calculated? Is 50 hours the average time people take to 100% it? Is it how long it takes for the VN to finish on auto play? Is it a rough estimate taken from the number of words/lines in the VN's text? Is there any real objective way to calculate the length of time taken for an average person to finish a VN?
visualnovels,3bf065,OavatosDK,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:32:27 2015 UTC,Depends on if people listen to the voice work of most lines like I do as well. So yeah it's kind of impossible to calculate the time.
visualnovels,3bf065,ctom42,5,Thu Jul 2 11:09:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how does vndb chooses the length indicated. The amount of time it takes someone to read a given VN is highly unreliable since it varies a lot. A ""50 hour VN"" can take 30 hours for someone and 100 hours for someone else, and even then people rarely accurately track their playing time anyway. EGS for example has users input the time it took them to play the VN but because nobody really pay attention the average time indicated is often very underestimated.   To compare and talk about VN lengths, the most commonly used metric is probably the size of the script, in mb, encoded in Shift-JIS. Another is the number of lines, and more rarely the number of characters."
visualnovels,3bf065,BookofAeons,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:21:48 2015 UTC,Yeah I find the play time estimates kinda misleading. Though I'd rather have them than nothing. Is there anywhere I can find and compare the size of VN scripts?

visualnovels,3bf065,jis33785,2,Thu Jul 2 12:08:29 2015 UTC,"You would have to hook the text with the choices separately. Alternatively, you could look up the walk-through guide in Japanese so you can pick the choice you want."
visualnovels,3bf065,svveetness,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:52:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not OP, but how do you do that? I don't see an option to add a hook in the text settings so I have no idea how to do so."
visualnovels,3bf065,falafel_eater,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:31:43 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, after you hook a thread you have to go through at least one line to have the line show up in whatever texthooker you use (VNR in the op's case).   So if whatever vn you are using has the text for choices in a separate thread, then you would have to 1) hook the text if it's possible, 2) open the text console and have have it open until you get to the next choice, 3) the text would show up in the next choice."
visualnovels,3bf065,svveetness,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:53:51 2015 UTC,"Sorry if my question wasn't clear enough. I don't know HOW to hook the text at all. The text just shows up as soon as I start a game i.e Angel Beats!, the one that I'm playing right now. I can't hook names because I don't know how to hook, I can't hook choices because I don't know how to hook."
visualnovels,3bf065,Athrithalix,3,Thu Jul 2 10:57:56 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see. Ok, so if you are using VNR I'm pretty sure the text is hooked automatically for you so you don't have to worry it. This should take care of almost all of the text except for names and choices for some vns. Go open up the text settings and look at the text threads section. If you look there should be one or more boxes with the game text. I don't have AB so I don't know what you see on there but there should be at least one box with the game text, one for names, one for UI, and etc. If AB has names in a different thread than the game text then you just search for the box that has the names and designate that as the name text. For the choices, just do what I said above.  Alternatively here is the wiki on hooking vns."

I'm running Linux on my main laptop so it's a lot of work to try to get something to run. I'm concerned that something like a virtual machine wouldn't have enough power to play a lot of the VN's I want right now. Would it work? Is there anything specific I would need to set up before hand?
visualnovels,3bf065,Aginyan,5,Thu Jul 2 13:53:29 2015 UTC,"As a rule, VNs are really not intensive. They also don't require a high framerate, so the virtualization overhead is practically negligible.    Running Linux, I just have a Windows XP VM in VMWare player. My laptop has a lot of RAM so I like to allocate 8GB to the virtual machine, but even 2GB should be good enough. If you can go with 4GB then go with that."

This isn't even the main problem; every time I run it, my antivirus says it has blocked a Trojan from within the School Days files. JAST has yet to reply to any of my queries, anyone think they can help?"
visualnovels,3bf065,Athrithalix,3,Wed Jul 1 22:46:14 2015 UTC,"My bet is that the antivirus erroneously identified a file that the game needs to verify against in order to play. and when it blocks said file it breaks the installation  hence all the trouble you're having...

What I'm really looking more forward to is the translation of Majikoi A-1, or at least Benkei's route, that character really caught my attention throughout Majikoi S and it baffles me that she didn't receive her own route.  Now, to my question, when can I expect the Benkei route to be translated? (Was considering learning japanese just to be able to play it, as well as the untranslated grisaia novels, but by the time im fluent, it should be translated already. right? ) Since Majikoi S seems to be closer to being translated fully, is there any more of Benkei in the untranslated routes, and which ones?  Tl;dr: Roughly when will Majikoi A-1 / Benkei route be translated? Is there more of Benkei in the currently untranslated Majikoi S routes and if so, which ones have her / the most of her. Thanks!"
visualnovels,3bf065,8cccc9,2,Wed Jul 1 18:54:33 2015 UTC,For Majikoi translation questions you are better off asking over at Fuwanovel since they are the ones translating it.
visualnovels,3bf065,Tez_Zim_Vin,3,Wed Jul 1 17:16:33 2015 UTC,"Let's not lose an opportunity to remind that ""Fuwanovel"" isn't translating anything, however some teams use the forums to announce updates and recruit people.   Skyspear Translations, who's doing Majikoi A-1, has its own website.  Please not that translation groups usually don't really like being asked when x or y will be done."
visualnovels,3bf065,8cccc9,2,Wed Jul 1 11:33:45 2015 UTC,"Good to know. Last I had checked Majikoi S was being done by the same team of people who finished the Majikoi translations who were working out of Fuwanovel. As Cornetto mentioned they have merged with Skyspear, so my info was a little out of date."
visualnovels,3bf065,Derelinger123,3,Wed Jul 1 12:37:22 2015 UTC,Well to be fair in this case the original Majikoi translation project and S too when it started was all done on the Fuwa forums. Sure Fuwa wasn't TL-ing it themselves but it was still the best place to ask about details regarding it. Still is really.   Also the Majikoi S team have merged with Skyspear so all things majikoi TL's are based on that site.

I'm not that big on VN porn scenes anyway so that's not something I'm too upset about, but I heard they also took out a lot of other (non-porn) elements to the story as well.   Should I hold off on playing this version and wait for the denpasoft one?"
visualnovels,3bf065,ctom42,2,Wed Jul 1 10:22:56 2015 UTC,"Coming from someone who normally finds H-scenes to detract from a VN, I recommend waiting for the Denpasoft release.  The cut content is well done and adds some moderate depth to a few of the characters.  The Steam version was also a little over-zealous on censoring a few jokes, but they also left in some that are raunchier than the ones they cut so I'm not sure what's up with that.  That said, the Steam release is still very good.  Probably 85%~95% of the full experience, depending on which girls you prefer.  I haven't read the Steam version of Angelic Howl, though, which I've heard had some big cuts made."
visualnovels,3bf065,LoliPits,3,Wed Jul 1 10:39:44 2015 UTC,In light of the muv luv kickstarter should I hold off reading it until it comes out on steam?

Correct me if I'm wrong but the grisaia kickstarter was announced last year but the 18+ version has yet to be released.
visualnovels,3bf065,ctom42,3,Wed Jul 1 02:05:47 2015 UTC,"From what other people are saying, there won't be a retranslation for the kickstarter release, so you don't have to wait.

visualnovels,3bf065,Ewindal,2,Wed Jul 1 15:26:50 2015 UTC,"I have no proof of this, but I think it's a pretty safe bet that it is the all ages version. Steam doesn't allow nudity (officially), I can't imagine Apple would."

visualnovels,3bf065,Ewindal,3,Tue Jun 30 21:25:45 2015 UTC,So I just bought Higurashi on Steam and wanted to patch in sprites and voices. On the github (https://github.com/higurashi-mod/onikakushi) it says to download HigurashiPS3-Voices01.zip but there are also 02 and 03 files that are larger. Should I use those instead? Or are they for something else?

visualnovels,3bf065,HeroEMIYA,2,Tue Jun 30 12:35:04 2015 UTC,"Depends on the VN. Installing from the Japanese disk and then patching it should work most of the time. And there are plenty of patchers out there you can use, should the VN be region locked."

visualnovels,3bf065,UnspecifiedGravy,3,Tue Jun 30 12:26:56 2015 UTC,Has anybody played 虚ノ少女? I'm wondering how difficult it is and whether I can attempt it at the moment.
visualnovels,3bf065,OavatosDK,2,Tue Jun 30 06:27:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's super difficult in terms of grammar & line length. It's definitely harder than a average moege, but I don't think it's significantly harder.  It might get a bit trickier during conversations concerning proof (which tends to focus a lot of science). There's some segments of conversation that reference a lot of archaic figures.   If you're using a text hook, then there are a few segments of text that can't be hooked (certain monologues -- but these are sparse;  further, if your Japanese is decent, you'll be able to understand it regardless)."

I understand the horror of machine translations but is there a VN translator that will work better than others. I'm trying to find one for Angel Beats -1st beat-. Thanks so much!!
visualnovels,3bf065,BookofAeons,6,Tue Jun 30 05:14:54 2015 UTC,"Give up on attempting to read AB! until you have a solid grasp of the language. At least wait until you know a decent amount of vocabulary and know the grammatical structure and alphabet. Then you could maybe try to read at the same time as using a text hooker and dictionary to look up words as you go, but I'd still say you should wait until you're more fluent."
visualnovels,3bf065,hark_a_harkonnen,3,Tue Jun 30 11:58:31 2015 UTC,"I've recently read Grisaia no Kajitsu and G-Senjou no Maou, and although I'd very much like to feel those feels, I just haven't been able to. I read posts about how people cried to GSnM's epilogue and Makina's route in GnK, but the only part that got to me was Michiru's route.  Is it just me? Or have I just been reading the wrong visual novels?"
visualnovels,3bf065,superange128,2,Tue Jun 30 10:24:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah you won't always agree with people's opinions, your tastes are just different.  Could you give an example of a VN (or any media) that made you emotional? Perhaps we could recommend you stuff based on stuff you previously liked that aren't Grisaia/G-sen."
visualnovels,3bf065,Fuwante0,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:34:31 2015 UTC,"Hm, the Tsuzumi route in Period really got me, as did Planetarian (oh the feels) and the Emi route in KS (first route in first VN). The Michiru route in Grisaia no Kajitsu was also a hard-hitter, and the next-most-feelsy would probably be Sachi's route. I reread the epilogue in GSnM and then teared up a little, but still not the emotional wham I had expected. Thanks for offering, I'd really appreciate suggestions!"
visualnovels,3bf065,Hopac,2,Tue Jun 30 05:22:19 2015 UTC,"Some VNs just don't hit everyone the same way. I cried like a bitch at the end of GSnM, but that's about it. GnK and KS were good, but not as impactful. And as for Clannad, I just don't get it. I'm going to try again eventually, but...  The only way to know what hits you is to read until something hits you, I guess."
visualnovels,3bf065,superange128,3,Tue Jun 30 03:02:35 2015 UTC,"I only remotely felt a tiny bit emotional at the Makina ending in Grisaia, the rest of the game did nothing for me. On the other hand Little Busters, Clannad, and Muv-Luv have had me blubbering like a baby at various points. Don't feel bad for not ""feeling"" for a game, if you're enjoying it aside from that it isn't the end of the world."
visualnovels,3bf065,Hopac,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:35:11 2015 UTC,"I have to carefully watch my mental state in order to enjoy a VN.  When my depression flares up, it's pointless to even try reading as I won't feel anything.  Then I'll feel like I wasted my chance to read something great and I'll just feel even more miserable.  Do other forms of media get an emotional response from you?  Movies, books, etc.?"

visualnovels,3bf065,ctom42,2,Tue Jun 30 03:12:11 2015 UTC,Can someone tell me what QC means in terms of translating? For example when someone says a translation is at 100% but the QC is 0%.
visualnovels,3bf065,8cccc9,4,Tue Jun 30 03:20:54 2015 UTC,"I believe it means Quality Control. Basically someone has to proofread the translation for grammatical errors, or sentences that just don't sound ""right"". I don't know if they also check to make sure the VN itself doesn't crash or anything after applying the final translation?"
visualnovels,3bf065,mdzjdz,2,Tue Jun 30 01:43:18 2015 UTC,Oooh so that's it! Thanks man it's been bugging me for a while now.

visualnovels,3bf065,davio12345,3,Mon Jun 29 22:53:33 2015 UTC,Do you have any examples? Pretty much everything on VNDB that is among the top 100 or so by score or popularity gets mentioned here with some frequency.
visualnovels,3bf065,Bobemmo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:57:52 2015 UTC,"That's not really surprising when you consider that VNDB displays by default the bayesian score. Unknown VNs with only a few votes won't even make it under the top 200 (and therefore have a low chance to be mentioned here). As for popularity, the top 100 is more or less steady because a lot of people choose to only read the most popular VNs. New readers looking for good VNs on VNDB will only choose from a limited pool and so we will get the same VNs mentioned here over and over as well."

I'm certain that you know how the scoring works, no insinuation intended :)."
visualnovels,3bf065,ctom42,5,Mon Jun 29 20:47:15 2015 UTC,I think that most of the higher rated translated novels are discussed frequently on /r/visualnovels.   Are you sure that the work was complete? VNDB lists a lot of English translations that are partial.
visualnovels,3bf065,Ressha,2,Mon Jun 29 22:02:45 2015 UTC,"Not really. But then again, I didn't read VNs a couple of years ago. I'm curious about what you found that made you think of your question, though."

visualnovels,3benuk,hyperknees91,2,Sun Jun 28 20:09:02 2015 UTC,I think it's because she got overshadowed by Sakuya that people feel this way. So basically she got what Grisaia Spoiler.   Or people just don't care about her personality. Which is fine too.

Across most people I meet though it seems Lucia is the fave most of the time. Probably because she has the strongest route overall and she gets more development then the other five (plus her romance is super cute).

visualnovels,3betnf,hyperknees91,13,Sun Jun 28 16:01:59 2015 UTC,"I have some issues with your review. To be honest, it sort of feels like you missed a lot of what Comyu is about.    The main issue of Comyu is that of different people living by different systems of morality, and how those people behave when their morality is challenged. The entire point behind the existence of Comyus is that they are very different from the usual world; in Comyu, you can have a group of 5 connectors where 3 are Beginner Killer mass-murderers and 2 want nothing to do with it. If you stop the BKs, the two others will die. You cannot jail anyone. You cannot take away or confiscate an avatar. You can have no guarantees of anything at all -- and even the weakest avatar is equivalent to a tank, so you can't really afford to take anyone lightly either.    The antagonists are shallow because they represent systems of morality and not people. Caesar is not interesting because he's a strong character, but because his approach is Game Theoretic and because his morality system indicates that the best solution is to have a benevolent dictator. Akihito's morality is very reactionary and inconsistent. Benio's is idealistic. Mayuki is a very moral and caring person, but it's only her online community that she cares about. Kagome is kind of nihilistic.    Akihito's group is very inactive because that's what a realistic group of people (that only barely get along) would do if thrust into such a strange situation. They can barely agree if they want to go to an organized cage fight, so how can you expect them to decide to change the world?      Another issue is the lack of a central antagonist. This is actually part of Comyu's main theme which is endlessly referenced by Akihito: fairy tales are simple. There is a princess, and there is a knight on a white horse that defeats the evil witch/dragon and everyone lives ever after. This is what haunts Akihito so much: there are no princesses (despite his constant attempts at helping women), there is nobody that is clearly evil--and even if there is, defeating them doesn't necessarily help--and even if you do ""do the right thing"" such as take revenge for the sake of your dead mother, the story doesn't end and your actions only ripple onward and hurt further innocents (such as the murderer's sister). ""Doing good"" is not actually possible.    To make things even worse, even the symbols are all wrong. Akihito wants to be the knight saving the princess, but instead his avatar is the black dragon and his closest ally is the witch.    Everything is shallow because it's supposed to be shallow. Characters are meant to act out according to their moral systems and not according to elaborate life stories.    I'll stop this rant here."

It's interesting, but not enough to carry a story by itself in my eyes.    The antagonists are shallow because they represent systems of morality and not people. Caesar is not interesting because he's a strong character, but because his approach is Game Theoretic and because his morality system indicates that the best solution is to have a benevolent dictator. Akihito's morality is very reactionary and inconsistent. Benio's is idealistic. Mayuki is a very moral and caring person, but it's only her online community that she cares about. Kagome is kind of nihilistic.   Yes I get the whole SMT vibe the characters have with the moral system. But like I said, I thought Mayuki was reasonably well developed, so why couldn't the other characters? I'm not all for the characters simply representing and idea and therefore their interesting. Also some of the characters do have interesting life stories, so I can only say the game would have benefitted from diving into them a bit more. You seem to think this would defeat the purpose of the work in which I disagree. For example I felt like a series like Monster and Swan Song captured a lot of the same messages but did so in a more convincing way and with more compelling well developed characters.     kihito's group is very inactive because that's what a realistic group of people (that only barely get along) would do if thrust into such a strange situation. They can barely agree if they want to go to an organized cage fight, so how can you expect them to decide to change the world?   Watching them waffle around constantly is not engaging. I don't mind if they can't make great changes, that's hardly the point. The problem is they hardly do much of anything. Wouldn't matter if the story had better pacing, but I expected a little more out of something so long.    Another issue is the lack of a central antagonist.

""Doing good"" is not actually possible.   I'm not complaining about the lack of a central antagonist. That hardly matters. I complained Gasai hardly gets to do anything, and the other antagonists are overly demonized compared to the main characters. It's not a problem in terms of the morality system, it's a problem in making any of the fights engaging to read (which was my main issue with it). And yes...Akihito's conflict is fine and all, but the problem I had was him constantly waffling about it in his monologue grew repetitive over the course of the game.   Everything is shallow because it's supposed to be shallow. Characters are meant to act out according to their moral systems and not according to elaborate life stories.   Yes I already explained at the beginning. The main message is that morals are essentially vanity. Still this isn't an excuse to not add needed depth and development to a character if you ask me (and Akihito still does develop, it's just too little too late). Once again I could have forgiven this if the pacing was better or if the atmosphere was conveyed in a more immersive fashion.   And like I said at the end. It seems you're one of the people who like the game for the philosophy it conveyed. Fine and all, but I feel like philosophy should be a compliment to the story and characters and not the main draw. It does to some degree but not enough for me to find this story worth reading."

It seems you're one of the people who like the game for the philosophy it conveyed. Fine and all, but I feel like philosophy should be a compliment to the story and characters and not the main draw.    Comyu is a visual novel about morality/philosophy, though. Judging it as an action-story based visual novel that is merely garnished with a bit of morality is not doing it justice, because that's not the type of story it is. It's like saying Rewrite is total garbage as a nukige because it has no H-scenes, or that Sengoku Rance's characters lack depth and development.    It's okay to say that you dislike Comyu's genre or that you thought Comyu was boring. But if you want to actually review it as a novel, you should review Comyu based on what the novel is trying to be and not based on what you hoped the novel would be back when you first installed it."

It's like saying Rewrite is total garbage as a nukige because it has no H-scenes, or that Sengoku Rance's characters lack depth and development.    But Rewrite doesn't sell itself as a nukige, it's a Key game so you know there won't be a focus on H-scenes and the very opening scene is a philosophical monologue. Sengoku Rance starts straight off with Rance antics. You aren't promised deep character depth.  Comyu, however, does sell itself as an action story. The opening scene is a flash-forward to a team of young adults with a dragon, fighting stuff. Several times in the early story, we are shown scenes of action that have no relavance yet, as if to give us a taste of things to come. You can't argue that the readers shouldn't be expecting an action story.  And it's perfectly possible to blend action with a great story and moralistic ideas. MLA did it fine. Rewrite did it fine. A story that sells itself on its action and its philosophical ideas should be able to deliver on both of them, not just one."

The >problem is they hardly do much of anything. Wouldn't matter if the story had better pacing, but I expected a little more out of something so long.    I actually fail to see where you are coming from with this. I found this work pretty consistently engaging and well paced. Yes it was difficult to convince the entire group to agree on stuff (which was kind of the point), but Babylon's Comyu was pretty damn active for most of the story. I don't see where these complaints of them not doing anything even stem from. Did we read the same work?   But like I said, I thought Mayuki was reasonably well developed, so why couldn't the other characters? I'm not all for the characters simply representing and idea and therefore their interesting   This is another point where I feel like we are reading different works. Mayuki was no more well developed than Benio, and was less developed then Kagome. I will agree that Hisoka's development was subpar (not being included in the common route initially was a dumb choice IMO). Ayaya recieved a decent amount of development in her own route, but was at a disadvantage from not being part of a Comyu. Haru did not have a route and thus got less development. Pretty much all of the side characters were pretty decently fleshed out, and Izawa was nearly as developed as Mayuki and Benio. Comparing Comyu to many other works I'd say that the cast was better developed.   The main message is that morals are essentially vanity   I did not get that message at all.    Still this isn't an excuse to not add needed depth and development to a character if you ask me (and Akihito still does develop, it's just too little too late). Once again I could have forgiven this if the pacing was better or if the atmosphere was conveyed in a more immersive fashion   Again, I can't even see where you are coming from with this. The development and pacing were both quite good. Ayaya and Mayuki's routes were a bit slower than the others, but this made sense in the context of the routes and never came off as boring. Akihito is a fantastic MC in terms of development, especially when considering most VNs have self insert protags. I'd say he is at least twice as intersting as Shirou (since you seem to like comparing this to FS/N). Again I'm left wondering if we even read the same work because you're impression of it is almost the polar opposite of mine and I can't even see where most of these complaints are coming from (and our tastes usually seem quite similar).   Watching your video I find myself disagreeing with basically everything that comes out of your mouth which is bizarre to me. I am baffled how we could have had such completely opposite experiences with this story. For example you mention how Kagome and Akihito's relationship felt rushed and her past was not explored well, but to me both of those things were the highlights of the story. The relationship was the most naturally written romance I have read in a VN, bar none. I felt the chemistry between the two characters practically since the first scene with Kagome in it. Throughout the entire story I very easily picked about Kagome's very sincere remarks from within her sarcasm. She was not kidding when she said she was his Deredere childhood friend, she always meant it. So when Kagome's backstory came up, everything fit perfectly into place and meshed excellently with how her character had acted up until this point.   The only thing I can think of as an explanation is subtlety. I found that one of the reasons I liked Comyu was because it did not shove a lot of it's development right in the reader's face. There was a lot of subtext in conversations and subtle interactions that made the characters really come to life. And from your video it seems like you completely missed nearly 100% of that."
visualnovels,3betnf,mystry08,3,Sun Jun 28 20:56:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the review, even if people don't agree with you, I think you should be applauded for putting the time in to create this.  I agree with a lot of your opinions on Comyu. To be perfectly honest, I dropped it after the common route. I love stories that focus on morality and philosophy but I just wasn't gripped by Comyu's action, overall story, mystery or characters. I got to a point where any payoff at the end wouldn't be worth my prolonged boredom.  I've considered rereading it to the end but I don't really see a pressing need at the moment with all the other great translated VNs I haven't yet read that interest me.  I don't agree with your thoughts on VN fights, though. You say that fights with sprites always seem silly but MLA does it amazingly. I think there's plenty of room in VNs for great fights."
visualnovels,3betnf,mystry08,5,Sun Jun 28 20:40:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the thoughts.   I wasn't saying the fights in visual novels are silly. I just don't usually care for them too much. What's silly is making a static sprite seem like it's doing a lot of moving around (like I mentioned Babylon bouncing up and down to give the illusion that it's charging at something doesn't look too hot to me). I agree that MLA does fights much better than most though, as they are usually brief and thrilling. I wouldn't say any visual novel could outdue a well animated fight though (like say the ones in Hunter X Hunter)."
visualnovels,3betnf,ctom42,3,Mon Jun 29 00:25:55 2015 UTC,"While I might be part of the ""Comyu was awesome"" group, I was also conflicted with the novel at times for reasons similar to the ones you mention.  I often found the themes and philosophies quite beautiful. But to be blunt, I thought Comyu was also a dragged-out fairy tale. Concepts such as group dynamic, the level of darkness/serious development, and underdeveloped characters did leave me wanting more, as you said.   I thought Comyu was far too ambitious for its level of execution. Something I usually hate to say but strangely fitting for this novel.     Some thoughts on your review:  Was that a Mizuki Nana or maybe May'n song playing in the background?  You brought up a lot of good points regarding the novel that others usually leave untouched but I heard a sort of imbalance between your spoiler section and the pre-spoiler section. During the pre-spoiler 10 minutes or so, you had a condescending tone that pretty much faded away right as you hit spoiler territory.   Moments where you were praising the tracks or artwork pre-spoiler felt like you were about to say ""but the novel was pretty bad, so these things don't matter"". But then as you talked about the common route, concessions/praise seemed fairly genuine and less... snarky?  Overall though, thanks for the review. I don't regret listening for 48 minutes but felt that Comyu may not have been the best novel for you to review. I think reviews with underdeveloped criticism or praise are rather weak, something you worked hard to avoid. But far too often, I felt a strong distaste that didn't do justice to the interesting issues with the novel you tackled."

I wasn't qualified to vote on very many choices this round, and the ones I could weren't very difficult decisions.   Shirogane Takeru x Kagami Sumika vs. Kazami Yuuji x Matsushima Michiru   I'm not particularly fond of either of these pairings, but they were equally blah so the choice was tough.  I gave the nod to Yuuji x Michiru due to ChiruChiru's character growth stemming from their relationship.   Frederica Bernkastel x Lambdadelta vs Naoe Yamato x Shiina Miyako   Not a hard choice; just felt like I was pissing in the wind :-p  I mean, what would /u/insanityissexy do if Miyako lost here?!

visualnovels,3bc23c,hyperknees91,2,Sun Jun 28 00:31:56 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'm hoping for a non-Grisaia win. It's an excellently written VN, but several of the characters are not good AS A COUPLE, and I'm hoping by the final rounds, people will realize that's what they're voting on, how they act AS A COUPLE.   Still, its popularity can't be matched, so it would need something equally mindlessly popular to beat it, so I guess, unfortunately, in effect I'm rooting for Katawa Shoujo couples, since they're the only ones with enough brand recognition to compete."
visualnovels,3bc23c,RavenscroftRaven,2,Mon Jun 29 02:06:09 2015 UTC,Well I think many people are hoping for a non-Grisaia win for the same reason. The bias and popularity is just too strong though. Especially if Kazuki x Yuuji makes it far as they didn't even interact in the visual novel most people read (actually the fact they already made it this far is kind of silly).   I dunno who would win if not for Grisaia. I keep forgetting about Katawa Shoujo's popularity though.   Regardless it's a shame if gets to that level because it'd be nice if the choices weren't swayed by popularity.

visualnovels,3bb1k9,Kowzz,3,Sat Jun 27 14:35:02 2015 UTC,Weekly Question: Does a main protagonist having a voice and/or face detract or add to the story or experience?
visualnovels,3bb1k9,funwithgravity,6,Sat Jun 27 14:41:43 2015 UTC,"From the VNs I've read, it has only added to the story and experience."
visualnovels,3bb1k9,nogaku,6,Sat Jun 27 15:41:11 2015 UTC,"I think since the backdrop of the plot is nowhere near as relatable as high school romance VNs, having the MC, Caim, be voiced and adopt a fitting personality is actually mandatory for the story to be fluid. Moreover, in the case of AnE, Caim should be considered as just another character among the cast, no different from the side characters and the heroines, since you can empathize with Caim's feelings and thoughts yet it's difficult to say that his disposition is conducive in immersing the players to feel like Caim himself since his character is fairly colorful.  Personally, I like it if the MC is voiced and has a bit of an obtrusive disposition since I rarely play VNs in order to 'hook up' with 2D girls, which is one of the reasons why I favor story-driven VNs with few choice selections. I'd just refer to the walkthrough if there are too many choices to bother with.  Also, I immensely loved Caim as the MC cause he came off across as a bit precocious and know-it-all at first, but became extremely relatable as I could actually empathize with the problems or dilemmas, , that he later faces off and reconciles with."
visualnovels,3bb1k9,Bobemmo,2,Sat Jun 27 15:50:36 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's a big deciding factor for me in terms of experience, but as someone who's still pretty awful at understanding Japanese having a voiced protagonist has been really helpful.  I wish it was more common."
visualnovels,3bb1k9,sirflimflam,2,Sat Jun 27 15:51:20 2015 UTC,"In this game I would say it adds to it. Caim is far from your usual vague player-insert protagonist. He actually has a face and has a strong sense of personality, so he really should have a voice. I definitely felt like his voice suited his character well.  In general I'm never usually bothered by protagonist voice acting (unless said voice acting also makes it into ero scenes, which drives me to muting him). It's usually the opposite: I don't generally feel like silent protagonists detract from the experience, baring a few exceptions where I really wish a protagonist was voiced. Though I will say that I always thought it was weird when a game would show CG of the protagonist missing his face. If it's just out of frame or a weird angle, then fine. However, if you're going to put the protagonist front and center in a picture, you might as well give him a full face. Anime faces are already vague enough for it not to be a massive issue, especially males."
visualnovels,3bb1k9,Beato01,2,Sat Jun 27 15:52:19 2015 UTC,I think that a voiced protagonist is almost always better. And I think having Caim unvoiced would have been a far lesser experience. I really can't imagine that the final parts of the story would've affected me as much as they did without Takeshi Kondou's wonderful voice acting. I wish he had some sort of sprite as well though (like a face in the textbox) though.
visualnovels,3bb1k9,Chronopolize,4,Sat Jun 27 18:59:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes. Too bad he isn't voiced during sex."

Also I usually don't hold much interest in h-content so it was a welcome relief to find only one mandatory scene with Tia."
visualnovels,3bb1k9,nogaku,7,Sat Jun 27 18:32:17 2015 UTC,"I thought I'd share an alternate ending idea I had for Eustia a while ago. Really rough and a bit cheesy in places, but oh well. Possibilities are interesting to look at.  Scene starts at the end of chapter four in the research tower. The starting point differs in the Sistina and Caim stop the 執政卿 from releasing the angel's power. Caim literally lops his hand offs and they do not relent until is dead beyond a shred of doubt. With the 執政卿 no longer misdirecting the power, the earthquakes of calmed down. The resultant situation is grave, but not as close to boiling over as in the original game. The researchers estimate the angel's power will last another two months, and a month until earthquakes begin to re-emerge.       Lucius wastes no time in petitioning Tia to undergo experiments. Caim concedes the decision to Tia at first, but that changes when he sees what Tia is going through. He sees the holes in Lucius's placation and guesses what might be the direction of the research.  Caim reaches the same conclusion he did in Chapter 5 except much sooner. He will not abandon Tia no matter the cost.    At some point Caim refuses straight up. Armed with a plan, he busts Tia out of there, wounding Sistina and others. He conceals Tia and moves quickly but covertly to farm house in the countryside which he had arranged previously.  In the beginning, Tia felt guilty about doing her part. She wanted to run away. Maybe she could have been able to do something for everyone. Then she realizes that the one she should be caring the most for is her beloved. He must be feeling as if he threw away the lives of everyone in the Novus Aether. That he came back for her in spite of that, and saved her from the pain and fear the selfish part of her wanted to run away from, she cannot fathom how indebted she is to him. She vows to strengthen herself, to hold her own against the weight of thousands of lives, and the shackles placed by on her by Lucius, Irvene, and herself. She vows to comfort Caim, ease his worries, to show him joy, and to love him.       A few weeks later, she was surprised when she realized she was truly happy the way they were. In hindsight, it should have not been surprising at all, after all, Caim had already made such a commitment.  One morning, Caim leaps out of his bed. He strains his senses and catches on to a silence that shouldn't be there. He wakes Tia and speaks to her. She nods and gets up quickly without a word. They both take a deep breath, and they burst out of the door. Caim catches eye of a half dozen soldiers positioned around the house. Without hesitation he sends two daggers at their heads. More soldiers appear. They keep running. He pays no attention to Sistina who is among the soldiers. He topples guard after guard in their path, not falling a step behind Tia. Just a bit further.  She takes his hand, and shows the brightest smile she's ever made. Caim can see no regrets, no weakness, no sorrow in this smile. He squeezes her hand, and they jump.    ""Why did wake you me at such an hour? What's wrong, you look worn.""  ""Your highness, your concern is spoiled on such as myself. I have come to bring good news.""  ""What is it about the angel? Have you found a way to hold up the city? Speak, Lucius.""  ""We have...not found a way to replace the angel. However, we have bought an amount of time.""  ""How long is it?""  ""Overlooking various deductions, just over ten years.""  ""Ten years...? Did the the first collapse, the Grand Forte not happen around that many years ago?""  ""...""  ""Pay it no mind. Lucius, you have done well. Allow me to offer you my thanks.""  ""I cannot be worthy of the honor."" He bows.  ""Even if this kingdom's days are limited, the King must lead his people to the end. We finally have the chance to help those from the Prison. I shall deliberate on the matter. Leave me, and rest a few days, Lucius. You will be needed in the days to come.""  ""As Your Majesty wills it."" He bows and departs.    The Holy Saint steps out and speaks about the message and blessing she has received from the angel.  Licia makes a speech to the Prison. She restates that the current Holy Saint has received a blessing from the Angels. There will be no more earthquakes. She promises food, water, and the promise that the Prison doors will one day open. She tells them it may take some time for preparations in the Lower Ward, but says them not fear, because they have not been abandoned! Not by the angels, and not by their rulers. From this day forth, you are no longer prisoners, but blessed citizens! Now put your stomach and souls at ease! She has prepared a large convoy of food brought down from the Lower and Upper Ward. Rows and rows of soldiers stand there to keep the order.  For perhaps the first time in it's existence, smiles, cheers, and laughter grace the crowds of the Prison. They are not the worried faces of those clinging to hope. They are genuine smiles of celebration and cheer. The vestiges of doubt and suspicion linger; miracles do not happen in the Prison. However, that is soon forgotten as the meals are served out to the people. For on this day, the people have something more than faith to hold on to. They have something which to confirm with their own hands. At least, this food is real.    In the highest tower of the floating city of Novus Ether, far removed from the past celebrations, stand two souls. They supported and saved each other, and have endured countless hardships together. They know each other better than anyone else. Perhaps it is their fate to share this final act together.  One of the two walks over to one of the tables and hovers his hand over a panel. He pauses, without turning back to face the other.  ""Thank you, Sistina.""  He presses the button.    TLDR: Caim breaks out Eustia a bit earlier, manages to hide out for 2 weeks. They lovers suicide off the edge (remember Eustia is somewhat resistant to dying).   Lucius reports that he has managed to buy time, 10 years. Lucia resolves to rule the citizens, even if that is all the time there is. They hold an buffet for people in the Prison. Many people are in disbelief, but peeking through behind that doubt is joy and relief.  But it was really all over and Lucius only hid that information because he assessed there was no longer any chance of success without Eustia. Rather than streets burn in riots he ended everything in an instant."
visualnovels,3bb1k9,Chronopolize,4,Sat Jun 27 17:55:22 2015 UTC,Wouldn't this basically be if Caim got what he wanted though? Like if they had died together instead of Tia choosing to sacrifice herself. Since his regret would be to live in a world made of Tia's sacrifice while Tia's regret was to let Caim die when she had the power to do something. So with your ending Caim would be able to go out without regrets but Tia wouldn't. Which is what is so tragic with the original ending since their regrets are incompatible and there is no way for them to both be content.
visualnovels,3bb1k9,funwithgravity,2,Sat Jun 27 18:49:40 2015 UTC,"Unrelated, but that's such an adorable flair of Tia :3"
visualnovels,3bb1k9,Chronopolize,2,Sat Jun 27 21:59:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know. One of my gripes about Tia was that her values weren't really developed. It felt like she was going along with Lucius' manipulations, and doesn't give an answer definitely until the 11th hour. There aren't really hints showing how she values the world so much. She just ""wants to help with the research because she believes it's her destiny, and because (as lucius says) she's the only one who can do it."

visualnovels,3bbmor,Lishy1,2,Sat Jun 27 21:27:14 2015 UTC,"Directionless exactly describes Kouhei. He supposedly has this big backstory involving his family, and train hallucinations, yet the plot just abandons everything once you choose a route.  Personally, I think that he is badly written, and being blank was merely an excuse for the writers to focus only on the heroines. It's not a bad story by any means, but Kouhei isn't memorable at all, and he doesn't feel relateable."

The only character on the list I liked was Aeka, and that was because she is the most expressive character in terms of how she reacts to the plot. Her route had actual tension to it, a serious antagonist, and an amazing climax.  Just one complaint about the list... Where's Hirofumi!? He was awesome!!!"

Over the past couple of weeks I've been attempting to learn how to hack Visual Novels and I have discovered a way to remove the Region Hack without the need of 3rd party software to run SiglusEngine.exe. While my patch does work on my system, I just wanted to know if it worked on the computers of others. Please comment below with stability reports etc. TL;DR Patch to remove region locking, works on my system, unsure of others, plz test :) https://mega.co.nz/#!IQ9BnaBI!uPKIQ2YOzYC-IFlDVizd397yVf-VUxOjpH7JMw4xPi4"

visualnovels,3b5rev,alexskc95,-5,Fri Jun 26 04:59:19 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to think of a way of saying this that doesn't sound terribly condescending, but...  Why not just learn Japanese? Machine TLs are just so terrible. And not ""ixrec can't in2 TL"" terrible. They're ""I think I can kind of understand what's going on half the time"" terrible. Of course, it's a given that any kind of tone or subtlety will be lost. God bless you if you encounter a pun.  I don't buy the ""I don't have time"" excuse, either. Clearly, if you're going to attempt to decode a broken machine TL of something as long as Angel Beats, you have time.  Or the ""I'm too stupid/have no willpower"" excuse. I mean, JP is my fourth language, and I'm exceptionally dumb and lazy. I failed my last semester of college. I know more bilinguals than I do monolinguals, and it's not like I hang out in the ""smug intellectuals club"" or w/e.  I just... I can't see the why."
visualnovels,3b5rev,TSolo315,57,Fri Jun 26 06:14:31 2015 UTC,"Yep, sounding terribly condescending accomplished. You were doing alright until you hit ""I mean, JP is my fourth language, and I'm exceptionally dumb.""  Learning a new language is difficult and is a rather massive commitment -- requiring more motivation than simply wanting to read a few untranslated VNs. Anyone claiming that learning a language is simple, especially one so different from English (for native English speakers,) is either very gifted or delusional.   Some people don't have the hours and hours of practice/learning time required (we're talking hundreds of hours here,) on top of the motivation, to spend on a new language simply to indulge a hobby."
visualnovels,3b5rev,alexskc95,3,Fri Jun 26 07:02:18 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to imply that learning a language was something easy you could learn over a summer vacation. I'm sorry if it came off that way.  It just seems to me that an awful lot of people really exaggerate the amount of effort needed to learn a language, to the point of being discouraging to beginners. Even a thousand hours, spread out over the course of three years, comes out to less than an hour a day. At that point, it's not really a question of effort so much as it is commitment.   simply to indulge a hobby.   Isn't just about every hobby a massive timesink if you want to develop any measure of skill? Nobody is born being able to paint or play an instrument or a video game."
visualnovels,3b5rev,hyperknees91,5,Fri Jun 26 08:04:27 2015 UTC,"It's just a motivation issue really. People want to read the visual novels they want to read ""now"", not wait 3 years and then read it where they may no longer be as interested."
visualnovels,3b5rev,DisparityByDesign,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:10:39 2015 UTC,"Also, I have a fulltime job that requires me to study and keep up to date with current technology. I have a social life and I exercise. I prefer using the time I have left to enjoy myself, not study even more."
visualnovels,3b5rev,hyperknees91,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:32:00 2015 UTC,"Indeed once your at the point in life where you have a fulltime job, learning it is impractical. The only way anyones going to learn japanese is if they started from a young age like I did or if they just deeeeeeply love anime/manga/vns that much.   Quite honestly my two cents on this. It doesn't really matter if people use machine TL. All that matters is if they are enjoying whatever they are reading regardless. For example the Dark Souls director actually made that game based on english literature that he enjoyed, but he couldn't fully understand so he had to fill in the gaps with his imagination. I imagine many people who read with a broken translation do this. Yes it's not the same, but so what? All that matters is if a person is being entertained. If broken engrish doesn't work for you, don't use it. Simple as that."
visualnovels,3b5rev,Hamroids,2,Sun Jun 28 15:16:59 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I think the difference here is that when reading a VN there's no need to 'test your skill.' It's a simple hobby while the arts and competitive gaming are more like passions."
visualnovels,3b5rev,Habhome,7,Fri Jun 26 10:25:05 2015 UTC,"I just... I can't see the why.   You can see why, don't kid yourself.  I've tried learning Japanese, it's pretty hard. Especially kanji. A friend of mine has been living in Tokyo for about 1½ years, studying only Japanese in school. And now maybe she can read a newspaper and fully understand it. To be able to fluently read the language anytime soon you can't just have a couple of hours a week, you need more time. Time which a lot of people don't have. Me for example, I am intrigued with Angel Beats, it sounds cool, I liked the anime. But I have other hobbies, I'm a trainer in target shooting and compete on a national level, I am a volunteer stage tech at anime conventions, I'm a hobby photographer, and I have other games and anime/tv-series I enjoy watching. And on top of that I've got a full time job. I'd be lucky if I got a few hours of language practice in per week, and it's not enough. Hence, on the occasions I do sit down with a VN, I want it translated. And if it's badly translated and I need to spend time deciphering it, well, then I won't have time to read it and I ditch it."
visualnovels,3b5rev,alexskc95,3,Fri Jun 26 08:39:13 2015 UTC,"And if it's badly translated and I need to spend time deciphering it, well, then I won't have time to read it and I ditch it.   Then you're really not the type of person I'm addressing in my post. Not everyone has to be super into their hobby. If you've only got a passing interest in VNs, and you can wait for a translation, as well as deal with the fact that some works will never get translated... That's fine. I  have a passing interest in writing, but that doesn't mean I'm going to try writing a whole novel, even if it is ""only three pages a day.""  My post is aimed towards those who do get very excited about titles like this, and buy them on release day, and know the names of the industry figures and are ""really into it,"" but despite all that would rather slog through terrible machine TLs trying to decipher what the hell is going on than learn the language those works were written in."
visualnovels,3b5rev,Habhome,3,Fri Jun 26 08:55:20 2015 UTC,"Ah yes,  people THAT invested in the hobby have strong incentive to learn the language of their medium. As it kind of IS a big part of it."
visualnovels,3b5rev,Spoggerific,11,Fri Jun 26 10:53:48 2015 UTC,"I'd have to agree with you. Half the reason I love VNs so much is because they're written in Japanese and writing in Japanese has a bunch of tricks that are anywhere from really hard to just straight up impossible in English. Furigana, obscuring the subject of a sentence, kanji puns, etc. I also get the feeling that good writing in Japanese feels a lot more... for lack of a better word, ""epic"" or ""dramatic"" than the comparative writing in English. I read F/SN in English a long time ago and again in Japanese a year or two ago, and the second time was so much more enjoyable. I'm not really sure why I feel this way - maybe it's just because Japanese is my second language so it's more ""new"" to me, or maybe it's because I'm just a dirty weeaboo - but, to me, fiction in Japanese is a lot more enjoyable than it is in English.  Machine translation destroys all of this. It's basically taking a finely crafted story and giving you an automated summary written by a machine in awful grammar. There's more to a book (VNs, of course, included) than just the events that happen in the story. Good writing is art. Even a bad human translation will generally preserve some of the charm of the original writing, and a good translation will re-write (heh) the story into English with its own tricky writing devices not possible in Japanese while still preserving the spirit of the original, a work worthy of praise on its own."
visualnovels,3b5rev,NyaaFlame,2,Fri Jun 26 07:41:22 2015 UTC,"I think the only thing I willingly used a machine TL on was Monster Girl Quest: Paradox, because let's be honest, the story was maybe half of the reason I was playing it.  For everything else I just wait until the English TL is released. I probably could learn Japanese if I wanted to, but honestly I'm not so into VNs that I'd learn an entire new language for it."

Last summer I was doing a /r/UniversityofReddit Learn Japanese course for beginners and even after a month of working with it I was still struggling to memorize/recall all the Hirigana and Katakana. Granted I didn't work on it every day, but I invested about 6 to 8 hours a week. Even had a mobile app that I would flick through while waiting for the subway."
visualnovels,3b5rev,DazzlePants,3,Fri Jun 26 22:43:42 2015 UTC,"I find that I can only remember things if I write them down, so I've used these trace sheets 1 2 to practice and help with memorization. It still takes a lot of time, and Kanji are still the bane of my existence. It also helps me to look for Hiragana and Katakana in titles of shows and novels to create links in my brain between sounds and characters.  I would personally suggest not worrying about becoming perfectly proficient at Hiragana/Katakana at the start, but work on them as you learn grammar and vocabulary. Without any context, it's really boring memorizing sounds and symbols, but when you add grammar to it, you end up focusing on that (which I find way more interesting) and the Hiragana and Katakana will come naturally over time (at least, that's my experience)."

Why don't people just learn Polish if they want to play the Witcher series? Afterall, if they really wanted to they could take the time to learn Polish and play it right? Just have to wait a few years and hundreds or thousands of hours later.   The point is: you shouldn't need to learn a new language to enjoy a game. Even me, who is starting to learn Japanese, still thinks your attitude stinks. Don't push your own ideas of what dedication to a hobby should mean on others.   You're either very young, or very out of touch with the world if you ""can't see why"" someone doesn't start to learn one of the hardest languages in the world just for visual novels.

visualnovels,3b5rev,Cornetto_Man,12,Fri Jun 26 14:04:49 2015 UTC,"Why don't people just learn Polish if they want to play the Witcher series?    This is bullshit. The Witcher series is a series heavily marketed towards English speaking audiences with full English voice acting, subtitles and most importantly a accurate translation. Angel Beats is a Japanese visual novel marketed towards Japanese audiences only. It has no English voices, no english text, hell it doesn't even work on non-JP machines. /u/alexskc95 point was that MTL's are fucking terrible and that learning Japanese is a far better option unless you like to read unintelligible garbage. Yes the ""elitist, ""I'm holier than thou"" attitude"" might be a problem on this sub but so is the attitude that any shitty translation is as good as a proper one.   Yes learning a new language is a lot of work just to read VNs, but you are the one who decided to start reading VNs, to continue reading VNs and who continues to want to read VNs. VNs which 99% of which are only in Japanese. Sure you shouldn't have to learn a new language to enjoy a game but when the games you want to enjoy are only available in that other language then somethings gotta give."

I'm at the point where I understand a visual novel better in its original Japanese than I do a machine translation. But it makes reading it a chore when I really just want to relax and enjoy the story. I played a route's worth of KimiNozo in Japanese and it was a massive chore. I'm a fast reader in English so trying to read through in Japanese was just frustrating and took me 3 times as long (and KimiNozo is loooong, so ouch). Angel Beats? Probably wouldn't be terribly bad.

Please comment below with stability reports etc. TL;DR Patch to remove region locking, works on my system, unsure of others, plz test :) https://mega.co.nz/#!IQ9BnaBI!uPKIQ2YOzYC-IFlDVizd397yVf-VUxOjpH7JMw4xPi4"

visualnovels,3b5rev,Sirson,3,Fri Jun 26 13:08:43 2015 UTC,The number of choices in this VN is astounding. I'm only 2 hours in and so far I've had 6 or so choices already. I'm loving it so far!
visualnovels,3b5rev,bigfatround0,2,Fri Jun 26 11:44:54 2015 UTC,So Key doesn't do adult content anymore?
visualnovels,3b5rev,mud074,7,Fri Jun 26 12:44:24 2015 UTC,We can only hope they don't.
visualnovels,3b5rev,alexskc95,2,Fri Jun 26 16:44:01 2015 UTC,I don't see how they could do an 18+ AB! VN unless the h-scenes were unvoiced or if the pay was good enough.
visualnovels,3b5rev,GVBN,2,Fri Jun 26 21:39:01 2015 UTC,"To clarify what /u/bigfatround0 said, Key naturally wants to use the original VAs from the anime. Many big name (or not so big name) VAs don't do 18+ stuff, something about their image or just not wanting to do it because they don't have to. Key would either have to not voice the H-scenes, hope that offering huge pay would be enough to get the VAs to voice H-scenes anyways, or use different VAs from the original anime. It just makes the most sense not to bother. Also, I may be wrong but I think the only 18+ Key game recently was the LB ""expansion""."

visualnovels,3b5rev,Cybersteel,2,Fri Jun 26 20:18:44 2015 UTC,All I'm really curious about with this game (shallow as it may be) is does Yui end up with Otonashi or Hinata in her own route. Idk it would just feel kind of wrong for her to end up with Otonashi just because that's the standard of girls with routes.
visualnovels,3b5rev,hyperknees91,2,Fri Jun 26 20:48:27 2015 UTC,"I think I heard this before the demo came out so I don't know exactly if this is how it is, but I'm pretty sure Otonashi ends up helping Hinata end up with Yui like how it was in the anime."

visualnovels,3b5rev,ctom42,-31,Fri Jun 26 19:03:56 2015 UTC,"occasional reminder to just learn Japanese already. Also it, kind of surprises me that people want to play this, the anime was bad, and the game is a literal rip off, it's a just a part of a full game, but it's being sold at the prize of a full game, so what, do they expect people to buy the 4 or whatever parts at the prize of a full game each? lol, I hope this game fails spectacularly."
visualnovels,3b5rev,tonydaniels,7,Fri Jun 26 10:36:33 2015 UTC,"You do realize that this ""part"" is as long as many full VNs. It's the entire common route and three character routes. If they had chosen the three most popular characters for these routes they could have gotten away with saying this was the whole game and their fans would have loved it. But instead they committed themselves to making a route for every character. It's going to be much longer than most VNs.  Also for those who decide to wait it's highly likely that there will be a bundled edition of the VN when they all come out that will be significantly cheaper than buying all of the episodes separately."
visualnovels,3b5rev,Instigare,-8,Fri Jun 26 10:46:57 2015 UTC,"While I've been looking forward to these VNs,    It's going to be much longer than most VNs.   That's a bold statement at this point."

visualnovels,3b7eg7,dropded,2,Fri Jun 26 16:06:45 2015 UTC,"After today, every series that has its own section in the original flair list has will be done besides Higanbana.   I imagine most of the Higanbana characters would be low rated anyway, except for Marie and Higanbana. Though if you are looking for a final VN to include to pad it out to 50 that would be a decent choice."
visualnovels,3b7eg7,ctom42,3,Fri Jun 26 17:58:53 2015 UTC,I guess it's one of those series were it's story-based as opposed to making likable characters? And/or Just has lots of characters without much focus on most of them?
visualnovels,3b7eg7,ctom42,2,Fri Jun 26 18:00:18 2015 UTC,It's a series of short stories and most of the cast only appears in one. There are a few that appear in multiple though. Even then the entire cast is heavily heavily flawed. Many of the themes deal with the ugliness of human nature so it makes sense.
visualnovels,3b5eec,Kenegro,5,Fri Jun 26 02:51:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's my all-time favorite story. Even if I will read something that is objectively better, it won't surpass ML for me.  I occasionally listen to the soundtracks, start up Altered Fable just for seeing it again, and reread some of my favorite moments in Alternative. I never did that with any kind of medium before which makes it so special for me. And I read Alternative three times already, so that's another thing I usually never do.  o7"

I thought this was a best couples competition, not a favorite Grisaia game competition. Voted against a few of the major series simply because they're actually not good couples, they're just from popular games. I'm surprised some got through that did. Like Emi? Maybe I just don't see the chemistry.  Good to see Craylanne still in there, though I think they should be knocked out within 2 rounds, they're better than many there, but not final four material."

Hopefully this wound on the eroge industry will heal over time. I'm quite optimistic, since Japan is witnessing and acknowledging the demand for their eroge in the west.   In recent years since then, the West began even producing its own eroge, like Huniepop, Sakura Spirit, and Menagerie. Sakura Spirit, in particular, was met with viral popularity, so obviously us Westerners are interested in eroge!  Just to play devil's advocate, this overseas embargo might be very good for the eroge industry in the west. Scarcity creates demand. Higher demand means more sales, and more popularity. The fact eroge developers have restrained from dealing with the West the past few years, is ultimately a good thing, because when they return, the demand for their scarce products will be very successful, and eroge in the West will be bigger than ever before!  Seriously, this wound will heal. I'm optimistic!"

What is easiest:  1) Grab yer rum  2) Import from the other side of the planet  The reason I don't pirate pc games is that steam is more convenient, I don't have to worry about laws, I have fast downloads, I support the devs, I have easy refund capability, I don't have to patch the shit out of everything and so on. Compare that to importing, the only convenience is that you support the devs, and it might not even work on your machine."

visualnovels,3b10no,ckuri,2,Thu Jun 25 11:18:35 2015 UTC,"Section 6. Reception of article  RapeLay:       Critics of violent game imagery, such as British Member of Parliament Keith Vaz, have cited games involving rape as an example of why video game content needs to be more strictly regulated.  RapeLay in particular had come to Vaz's attention in 2009, three years after its initial release, as being one of the rape games purchasable on Amazon.com, despite not being officially distributed nor supported outside of Japan, and he vowed to bring the issue into the British Parliament to prevent the game from being sold. Amazon subsequently removed the game from its website.  Equality Now followed up on the game, urging activists to write to Illusion and Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso in protest, arguing the game breaches Japan's obligations under the 1985 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.  In May 2009, these actions culminated in the restriction of the sale and production of RapeLay by the Ethics Organization of Computer Software (EOCS), an independent Japanese ratings organization for adult games, making the purchase of the game impossible.  Despite this the game is still available on many popular BitTorrent tracker sites.

visualnovels,3b10no,Dwarf_Vader,4,Thu Jun 25 22:01:15 2015 UTC,So from my understanding rapelay was not sold outside of japan right? How come that was such a big incident and not other games with the same content? Guess having rape in the name and being more interactive didn't help though.   Heck I'm surprised japanese developers even include it in there games after this incident.
visualnovels,3b10no,hyperknees91,20,Thu Jun 25 13:14:25 2015 UTC,"It was distributed by third parties on amazon and other sites outside of Japan.   At the time of the controversy, the game was already three years old and no longer in print. In 2009 Equality-Now, an American human rights organization (primarily focused on sex trafficking and sexual violence) discovered the game and started a campaign urging activists to write to Illusion as well as government representatives in the hope of getting it banned. The campaign got picked up by CNN and other news outlets and all of a sudden there's an international incident about a game no-one was playing.  Addendum: I should point out, though, that they were campaigning to ban depictions of rape and other sexual violence in video games, and it wasn't just about Rapelay. Rapelay just sort of became the media's poster child for the whole controversy."

visualnovels,3b10no,hyperknees91,3,Thu Jun 25 14:19:20 2015 UTC,I linked this thread to Keimaru on Twitter to show the interest of English fans in what he's saying.  He responded and I'm trying to convince him that Ninetail's games would be welcome in English if the company had an interest in licensing them.
visualnovels,3b10no,herkz,17,Fri Jun 26 23:00:30 2015 UTC,I can't believe developers still care about Rapelay after all this time. Especially with lots of people releasing them officially in English these days.
visualnovels,3b10no,flyingfetus117,39,Thu Jun 25 02:54:26 2015 UTC,"Like it or not Rapelay was an incident that sent shock waves that affected the industry in both countries. Given how there are people who want to ban eroge or especially loli even in japan I don't blame them for keeping the past in mind. Foreign countries don't have much numeric appeal as a marketing demographic so the risk seems higher than the reward. I am not happy about the japan only status of eroge, but I completely understand why they did it. Not long ago the US game industry had to deal with Jack Tompson trying to get rid of video games. Right now in the US it is in vogue to say that video games are sexist male fantasy simulators played by evil male basement dwelling shitlords (the gamergate fiasco). If I made eroge, especially games that include rape (like the developer in the op) I wouldn't want to touch the US (in particular) with a 10 foot pole."

visualnovels,3b10no,MotivatedRed,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:57:49 2015 UTC,I'm a bit confused by all of this. Isn't Grisaia considered eroge? At least the 18+ version. Are you essentially saying that Japanese developers (mostly) refuse to sell eroge outside of Japan?
visualnovels,3b10no,The_Dran,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:23:00 2015 UTC,"After the Rapelay incident in 2009, yes. The controversy which started in America rather quickly spread to Japan and it came at roughly the same time as when the Japanese government were being pressured by certain activist groups to ban eroge and explicit manga.  As a result, most eroge released today will begin with that ""For sale in Japan only"" splash screen, and in the aftermath of the scandal, many developers (including Illusion) also started blocking non-Japanese IP addresses from their website.   I'm sure someone else involved in the localization business can explain better, but from what I understand Japanese developers have been very wary about doing western releases as a result of the incident. It's just one of the many things that companies like Mangagamer have to convince the developers about the western market in order to get rights to a game."
visualnovels,3b10no,MotivatedRed,2,Fri Jun 26 10:31:19 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm going to have to be more careful who I talk to about VNs. I'm tried to convince several of my co-workers and friends to read some and I thought they would be pretty understanding since they're game developers. They weren't crazy recommendations, stuff like Sharin no Kuni, G-Senjou, Steins Gate, Planetarian or Narcissus (probably not the best first VN but its free on steam and is a quality VN) despite this I don't think any have picked up one yet. If they knew about the 2009 Rapelay thing then I guess I couldn't blame them? It's too bad either way."
visualnovels,3b10no,The_Dran,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:27:00 2015 UTC,"Well, Rapelay isn't really a VN to begin with, so any association would likely come from both having ero content rather than from the genre.   Recommend away, I say. If you know your friends and co-workers well you should be able to judge how they might respond to it. If you think that they'd be uncomfortable with an 18+ VN, then stick to all ages titles. If you think they might be sensitive or easily offended by those themes, then just tread carefully. And if you don't know them very well at all, then I think ""hey you should read this chinese porn game"" is a poor icebreaker regardless.   That game has been out for a decade. The controversy happened 5-6 years ago. Most people probably won't remember it, assuming they even heard about it."

Pretty much for the reasons you pointed out above he makes a far better and more threatening villain that Maou how just seems like a plot device rather than a character. It also helps that Sharin no Kuni has a really fascinating setting.

I will check out the fandisc.
visualnovels,3aznau,superange128,3,Thu Jun 25 01:28:44 2015 UTC,Sharin was the first VN I loved A LOT.   While I liked Grisaia I think Sharin did the improving heroines and their problems theme better. I also thought Ken-chan was better than Juicy-YUuji and of course Houzuki is a way better villain than any villain in Grisaia.
visualnovels,3aznau,Shotgun_Diplomacy,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:17:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think Grisaia is a very character-centric VN and excells at developing the personality traits of its heroines.

It's kind of weird not having that sitting around waiting for me to read a little more; it's been months and months since I started (one of my New Year's resolutions was 'Finish Umineko').  What can I say about this that hasn't been said about the VN that is the unofficial mascot of this subreddit?  Mind bending levels of mis-direction and careful world building? Check.  Masterful blending of both the fantasy and mystery genres? Check. Sometimes an almost profound investigation into what is truth, experience and perception? Check.  Very glad that I read it? Check Check Check.  Episode 8 was certainly a fitting finish, and quite a roller-coaster ride in it's own right.  In the end, I may admire Umineko more than I may have actually enjoyed the entire experience.  While I don't begrudge myself the almost unique experience of having read it, and will certainly read Higurashi as the new version appears on Steam, there are other VN's I've enjoyed more.  Partly I'm just not that big on mysteries, for one thing. As much as I like to reflect on the game's puzzles and whatever small insights I've gained (and I haven't figured half of it out, I'm not bragging) in the end I'm ready to move on rather than keep digging, the author's occasional jeers in the text notwithstanding. Also, Spoiler I can easily see, to a certain kind of reader, that this would be the greatest story ever told, though.  This is by no means sour grapes, it really is a great VN, I would recommend it to anyone who wanted a long, thoughtful, multi-layered story.  Actually, going over what I've just written and looking back at what /u/ctom42 wrote about Rose Gun Days last week, I think I'm going to do RGD as soon as I can (i.e. after I finish one of the other two I'm reading right now).  Reading Sharin no Kuni, Himawari no Shoujo over on /r/vndiscuss.  We are halfway through Touka's chapter at the moment.  Copious comment in that subreddit.

It's definitely the most accessible of Ryukishi's works, which while thought provoking does not require the level of engagement and thought that Umineko does. It's just a fun and exciting ride.   I can easily see, to a certain kind of reader, that this would be the greatest story ever told, though   This is the exact right attitude to have. Even if you enjoyed other things better you see what makes it so beloved by people like me. It's kind of like how I hate Evangelion, but also see why others love it.  Out of curiosity though did you manage to figure out ? I tried looking back at your older posts but there was no explicit mention of it. To many people episode 7 outright gives it away, but I've also seen people finish the entire story without even an inkling, so I don't take it for granted. If you have not yet figured it out, that would be the only thing I would definitely recommend thinking on before shelving the work in the back of your mind. It opens up several more layers of the story and it's symbolism."

visualnovels,3aznau,Ewig_Custos,7,Wed Jun 24 20:56:21 2015 UTC,"Spent a few hours on eden*.   It's good, but nothing past that. It has the same problems almost any short VN has - things move too quickly, it does not spend enough time to make the whole scene (characters included) complex. The protagonist is not an exception, despite being in the spotlight all the time he can be fully described in a single sentence, just like any other character. I did not like the portrayal of felixes - !. Human characters besides MC just don't get enough spotlight to have an impact. The pacing is pretty good - as I said, the main problem is with length, not pacing. Other than that, I'd argue that normal sequence of the events would be much better (hell, it's better in almost all cases). By starting from the finish eden pretty much spoiled most of the turns (can't call them twists), which is a shame. Setting is nice, I think the balance between details and their impact is pretty good there. Few minor issues here and there, but that's okay. As for the plot, it's nothing extraordinary, a mildly bittersweet story - in one word, passable.  Now the visuals. This VN is gorgeous. If the story was a little bit lacking, the production value partially covers it. Really, it's very plesing to the eyes, I wish same kind of quality was everywhere.   The music... It's pretty nice, but nothing specifically caught my attention. Will listen to the soundtrack specifically some other time (I'm actually almost done with read VNs' OSTs).  So, if you have ~5 hours of just comfortable reading with beautiful visuals and without complex stuff, go for it. If you are looking for something very deep, this is probably not the right title to start with."

visualnovels,3aznau,Cornetto_Man,6,Wed Jun 24 21:06:34 2015 UTC,"I decided to round out the last full OverDrive title released in English this week and started Cho Dengeki Stryker. So far I've finished the Zero and Heaven Saga's and have just started Sky and am liking it. What it lacks in terms of engaging action and narrative strength it more than makes up for with that OverDrive charm. Again the side casts really outshines the main cast with the group of enemy cyborgs being far more entertaining than the heroines.  The premise is pretty interesting. A young boy makes a deal with ""The Memory Collector"" to become the hero of his favourite manga Dengeki Stryker in exchange for all his memories. What's interesting is that nothing of the young Yuuki Yamato remains and instead we follow a fish out of water style protagonist in Stryker Zero's personality rather than Yamato with Stryker's powers. Zero Saga The new Yamato is an interesting protagonist in himself though. He's like Yuuji from Grisaia just without Yuuji's sense of humour. He's the embodiment of a donkan protagonist but he's not frustrating like other donkan protags (for example Takeru from Muv Luv). Instead he's more like Captain America in that he just doesn't fully understand societal cues and norms. This leads to plenty of OverDrive style humour, especially where the heroine of Heaven Saga Sayaka is concerned.  I'm hoping it will address some of the big philosophical questions that arise from the situation like  which until now have been brushed aside. I do like the meta-ness of the whole thing though, especially when Zero Saga. Though it seems that we might get some sort of resolution to this with Heaven/beginning of Sky Sagas.   So far Dengeki Stryker doesn't really compare to other great action VNs (F/SN, Ayakashibito etc.) or even other charage (like OD own Kira Kira). However it is entertaining enough a blend of the two that so far is worth reading if you're a fan of either OverDrive's other titles or the 90s superhero cartoons/manga that Dengeki Stryker feels like."
visualnovels,3aznau,demeteloaf,3,Wed Jun 24 21:12:31 2015 UTC,What it lacks in terms of engaging action and narrative strength it more than makes up for with that OverDrive charm.

visualnovels,3aznau,Cornetto_Man,3,Wed Jun 24 21:22:37 2015 UTC,"It really flies under the radar, even among OD titles. I still haven't read many VNs that can rival any OverDrive game in terms of supporting casts. Majikoi is one of the few that come to mind. They don't let themselves be held back by conventional character designs which results in characters like these all appearing together in the one VN."

Zero, Heaven, and Sky were the first set originally in Dengeki Stryker, and Sky Saga is definitely the best part of that.   There's more I'd like to say, but I'll save it for next week when you'll probably finish it."
visualnovels,3aznau,Cornetto_Man,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:45:00 2015 UTC,Yeah it's nowhere near as good as Kira Kira though I would argue that it could stand up to edelweiss depending on your preferences. I will refrain from judging it too much yet though since I'm only halfway through.
visualnovels,3aznau,DeadlyFatalis,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:59:50 2015 UTC,"DS definitely has its moments, but just different in feel. A lot of OVERDRIVEs stuff errs on the emotional side, but Dengeki is definitely a lot more ""Fuck Yeah!"" kind of moments, especially in the later routes.  When you finish Sky Saga, you should do Love Saga first before moving onto Steel Saga as Steel and Light Saga are definitely more of a real ending to the VN. This might be enforced, but I don't remember right now."

You consistently show a much deeper understanding and appreciation for Umineko than most people do on their first read. I guess you were right in saying that Higurashi primed you for Umineko, but even so many of the people who read Higurashi first don't come in with the same mindset as you and don't draw those connections or pick up on the important points in these parts of the story.   In fact a lot of the parts you are praising are frequently disliked by readers on their first read since they just want to get back to the main story. Lots of people don't appreciate these subtle messages until a second read.  I'm really looking forward to your thoughts as you get into the core arcs. I think you're really going to dig deep into the story, and might perhaps have some revelations even I have not reached yet (Considering I'm still learning things on my third read I'm positive there is still a lot left for me to tap into)."

The reason is that as you will soon see, Chiru itself urges the player to tackle the mysteries instead of reading passively. As you said it would be a disservice to Ryukishi to not at least attempt to think on these subjects, but don't kill yourself over it. I did not figure things out until episode 7, although I had a strong theory going in episode 6. This is typical of most readers. I do know of at least one person who solved it by episode 3 though.  Also your comment about this making you realize Umineko was more complex than you thought made me laugh. You have yet to even begin to grasp the complexity.   As always I had fun reading your comments. It's always interesting comparing how people react to various scenes. I think your spoilers from Ougon Musou Kyouku predisposed you to a magical viewpoint, which is something I had noticed in all of your posts till now. If you were still completely thinking that way late into episode 6 I probably would have done the same thing your friend did. But remember the best way to enjoy Umineko is to view it from all sides simultaneously. This means thinking of scenes as both magic and mystery."

But I'll give it a try."" after a while I found myself chuckle at some things and enjoyed it enough to continue playing it.  Now without spoiling anything I'll say that while Majikoi isn't very complex and many characters are stereotypical plus a lot of the humor is cheap, still it's one of the VNs I enjoyed most. I can't put my finger on what, it was just entertaining I guess? It doesn't take itself too seriously. The production value is pretty good though, voices, content and art. So it definitely had a polished feeling to it."
visualnovels,3aznau,superange128,2,Thu Jun 25 01:44:36 2015 UTC,Just wait until Agave route is unlocked (after beating all the main heroine routes unlock) then you'll see where the plot is going.  Also Suguru is definitley one of the funniset characters in the whole VN which is saying a lot.  That said most of the point of MajiKoi is that it's mostly meant to be slice of life-ish as opposed to the usual popular VN.
visualnovels,3aznau,ctom42,2,Thu Jun 25 18:33:46 2015 UTC,It's interesting that you can't tell where Majikoi is going because for me it was the VN that was best at properly foreshadowing each routes conflict in the common route. I had a rough idea of what each route would cover long before I got to start picking routes.
visualnovels,3aznau,demeteloaf,4,Thu Jun 25 20:04:05 2015 UTC,"I had one last route of Duel Savior left from two weeks ago, and with traveling all last week, finally got it finished.  You can read most of my impressions on Duel savior in the previous post along with a bit of snark at some of the more ridiculous things like the protagonists seeming lack of eyes, and the magic cannon that requires someone have sex with it to fire it, but overall i quite enjoyed it.  The final Harem route was quite entertaining, although I was a bit screwed over by the fact that it actually forces you to play as other characters besides Tiaga for the first time, and i had not leveled some of them up at all, eek...  Harem route had some very fun fights and the story extended on the awesome Mia route, so I'm pleased.  The the one snarky comment I'm going to give is how I thought it was hilarious that when each of the main heroines had their climactic moment, they all thought back to this image of them all together dawwwww... well, except for Tiaga, he thought back to the orgy scene...  definitely made me laugh.  But overall, I thought the game was quite good.  I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a VN with a bit of gameplay.  Biggest problems are the forced route order and that a couple of routes feel repetitive.  It would probably have been better had they cut 2 or 3 of the routes.   Still haven't picked up a next VN though.  Been reading actual dead tree books (finished Seveneves by Neal Stephenson yesterday, which i thought was good, but not as good as Anathem)  I'm debating picking up something light, because i'm ready to drop it on a hair trigger when Subahibi in English releases.  I'm thinking maybe Katahane, since /u/insanityissexy has been recommending it.  And it seems like a good light yuri romp that i probably won't get too too involved in and could easily put on hold in the case that Subahibi does drop soon..."
visualnovels,3aznau,8cccc9,4,Wed Jun 24 20:24:21 2015 UTC,"For a little while now I wanted to read An Octave Higher, an interestingly looking, relatively new EVN, and during Steam Sale I finally decided to pick it up. After the first two hours I was completely enthralled by the world of AoH, so I ... kind of ended up binge reading the whole thing in two days.  First, AoH has quite an interesting science fantasy setting, where the science leans towards steampunk and fantasy is restricted to the use of magic. But the magic part isn't just the usual mumbo-jumbo - there are e.g. magical engineering and magical science, which are trying to take advantage of magic or trying to study and quantify it. This concept works surprisingly well, because there is clearly a lot of thought put into it, and it makes you want to learn more about the world, the magic and how it works. At least I would have loved to attend some lectures on 'Introduction to Magical Science' in Conservatoire de Ouverture... Oh yeah, Ouverture is the monarchal city AoH takes place in. Thematically it would be a kingdom with colonies set in the 19th century in Europe, where industrialisation just set in a few decades ago. Magical industrialisation, that is. And with it there is segregation into the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, political unrest and other stuff.  The story is alternatively told from three different perspectives which include the upper, the middle and the lower class. This gives the reader a halfway unbiased overall picture and the transitions between the perspectives were in the beginning of the VN often seamlessly, which added to the overall atmosphere of Ouverture. As for the protagonists, they were almost all likeable and had often more-or-less interesting indicated back-stories, but sadly didn't have very much character development or depth. While all characters generally weren't flat, I thought that they also somehow never came fully to life.  I really liked the slice of life and parts at the beginning, where the world was still being explained and where everything was new. The chitchat between Franz and Aretha also were great, especially this one scene comes to mind where mild slice of life spoilers. The VN often features magic combats and I thought they were pretty cool at the beginning, but they got duller over time. It's basically always the same and I have never felt much tension from them. That's sadly a structural flaw, at least for me, because when things usually get intense, there is a magic battle, and those magic battles couldn't really reel me in.  Oh, I probably should say something about the soundtrack and musical themes since it's called 'An Octave Higher'. There are some musical themes in the story, but they're never really central, except maybe the piano in the beginning. They appear more frequently in the form of subtle ""puns"", e.g. contains the soundtrack only about 1~2 handful original tracks and more classical well-known pieces. One protagonist's name is Elise, and guess what, which masterpiece by Beethoven made its way to the soundtrack? Exactly... This directly leads me to the quality of the soundtrack. The original pieces were mostly average. I only liked a few tracks and they all became a bit repetitive after some time. As for the compositions by Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert, etc.: There were quite a few, but they were only sparsely used. And even then, I often thought they didn't really fit or benefit the story.  Hmm, as for the plot, it can be roughly divided into two parts. I enjoyed the first part quite a bit, where the worldbuilding was still in process and you got to know more about everything. It was just a pleasant and interesting story about magical science with likeable characters in an intriguing world. However, the end of the first part wasn't to my liking, I thought it was a bit sudden and felt out of place with everything about spoiler.  As for the second part, it wasn't bad, but I'm disappointed that they major true route spoilers.  Whew, all in all I enjoyed reading AoH. It has just such an interesting world, but that's also one of my biggest criticisms. There just isn't enough focus on the world and the setting, and the characterisation and description could have been more detailed in general. Omitting the second part (at least the execution) and focusing more on depicting everyday life and how the society works would have been much better in my opinion. I just hope that the developers aren't done with this setting and consider making another story set in Ouverture sometimes in the future."
visualnovels,3aznau,Youbiseiharukana,2,Wed Jun 24 20:27:28 2015 UTC,Ooh I got this vn on sale too since I had my eye on it for a while. Now I'm really looking forward to trying it out! Hopefully the characters not being as well-developed as they could be doesn't stop me enjoying it.
visualnovels,3aznau,8cccc9,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:38:47 2015 UTC,"You should be fine, they're not plain characters and have their reasons. The VN just doesn't spend so much time on descriptions and could have easily been twice its length. I don't remember there being very much inner dialogue or monologue, so you don't get so easily into the minds of the characters. It's just a little bit ... fuzzy to the touch."

visualnovels,3aznau,BookofAeons,5,Fri Jun 26 09:53:41 2015 UTC,"Little Busters!  We wrapped up Kurugaya's route this week on /r/vndiscuss.  My comments available here.  Mio is up next!  Princess Evangile  I've only read a couple of chapters since last week, as the Final Fantasy V: Four Job Fiesta has been consuming my evenings.  I'm right at the start of Chapter 13 Spoilers.  I found Chapter 12 extremely unpleasant.  Chapter 12  Chapter 12 Continued  I hit the first choice that looks like it might have real implications.  Unfortunately, it boiled down to ""which girl do you like?"" which is a style I'm not a fan of.  I prefer to role-play the protagonist on my first playthrough, and there's no real way to role-play such a decision.  It's jarring, having to switch mental gears like that.  Plus, it always feels like I'm making a flat value judgment, which I don't enjoy doing on characters I'm meant to view as human beings.  Maybe this choice doesn't really affect anything, though;  I certainly don't think I'm in Chiho's route yet.  And on a lighter note, some moments I enjoyed:  I have a goddamn degree in Chemistry, and I couldn't remember what thixotropy meant until I looked it up.  Touché, Princess Evangile, touché.  Rise-san is somewhat right about this.  A vote with only two options is guaranteed to pick the Condorcet winner.  If there must be more than two options, however, treating the vote more like a survey tends to produce superior results.  CGP Grey has produced some amazing videos on the topic.  This translation was particularly funny.  They all actually say different things which add nuance to their character:   Rise: Anata no sei yo.  Chiho: Anta no sei.  Ruriko:  Masaya-san no sei desu.  Ayaka: Kimi no sei da ne.   Ritsuko has clearly read Umineko"

visualnovels,3aznau,ConfuzzledKoala,4,Wed Jun 24 23:43:59 2015 UTC,"I’ve just finished eden*, and it was quite good.  The story starts out slow, and spends a couple hours not really doing anything but introducing characters and items that will become relevant later on. I found it getting more interesting with the flashbacks detailing Ryou’s past with Natsume, and once it had reached the point of meeting up with the introductory scene, minor spoiler, I was basically sold.  However, even during the parts where the story isn’t exactly enticing, the game really shines in its presentation. Its visuals are fantastic, and characters are portrayed completely in CGs (with lip syncing, at that!) instead of waist-up sprites. The music is fitting, the voice acting is very good, the dialogue is well written, and the opening is incredible.  All in all, a pretty great game!  Well, onto Is This the Life? and then Planetarian."

So, after I finish this, I've got: Eden*, Narcissu, Symphonic Rain, Coμ, Kamidori Alchemy Meister and Demonbane all ready to go. So, what should I do next?"
visualnovels,3aznau,Ewig_Custos,3,Thu Jun 25 04:16:58 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend reading Symphonic Rain. I did not read Coμ, but besides that it's the best in the batch.  After that choose yourself:  Eden is bittersweet story (of a milder type), has amazing visuals and is pretty short.   Narcissu is a somewhat depressing game, it's also very short.  Kamidori Alchemy Meister is a game, so you can start whenever you want. It's pretty fun (where grind is not involved), but it's pretty long. It also has new content for subsequent playthroughs, so it's VERY long if you're planning to go through all three routes and clear all quests. Some of NG+ quests require terrible grinding for materials.  I can't recommend Demonbane since I've hated it, but if you like mechas, power rangers and Cthulhu mythos, check it out. Note: there is no horror, it's action/comedy turning into action/drama."

visualnovels,3aznau,Ewig_Custos,2,Thu Jun 25 16:19:07 2015 UTC,"If you're interested in Eden, just go for it. Since you've liked ef I can guarantee even in the worst case you'll find Eden just mildly interesting. The visuals in eden are even better than ef's, by the way.  Symphonic Rain won't go anywhere, Eden is not that long anyway, it's about 5 to 10 hours.   As for Demonbane, ultra-short introduction/description would be like this: MC finds Necronomicon in the form of a girl, finds a giant robot, fights (giant) stuff that attack the city. After a bunch of battles big bads appear, and things get darker. No horror of any form besides a few unpleasant images. If you've read Saya no Uta, you won't be impressed by them. I'd love to actually start bashing the game, but it won't be fair unless someone who liked it would represent its strong points."

Yeah, ""forced"" - not something I was expecting from this title, given it's great reception. At least now I know that I should be more careful/sceptic next time I'll start to form an opnion based only on title's score on VNDB.  Anyway, for me reading Steins;Gate resembles riding rollercoaster, constantly going really high with scientific theories, then going down with Okabe's personality, then going up with mystery, then going down and throwing all this creepy anime bullsh#t in my face. And so far it never stops,  so even if I enjoy story at the moment, I have no guarantee that there isn't any Faris-related, extremely dull episode waiting just around the corner. Story is very inconsistent in terms of ""feeling"" for me and I'm afraid that even if there's some genius plot twist at the end, that would show me the whole story in totally other perspective, my opinion won't change that much. Quite sadly, because when I finally encounter ""interesting"" moment in story, I really get into it. I guess I have only myself to blame for expecting God-know-what.  In meantime when I wasn't reading S;G, I've decided to finish Deus Machina Demonbane. And it was great choice, because I've enjoyed it more than I probably should admit. It's not like the story was flawless, bah, I can even understand why some people call it garbage. Luckily, it's my kind of garbage, so there weren't many problems with overlooking especially bad moments (those h-scenes, blargh), when enjoying good ones. The fact that I'm an idiot who learned more about Cthulhu from Haiyore! rather than Lovecraft's books probably also helped, or maybe I just needed to read something happily stupid. In any case, story about sorcerers being sorcerers, mech's bashing things, and gods-related businesses mixed with humor so-bad-it's-actually-funny, loli grimoires and over-the-top names for everything (Lemuria Impact-o!) was enough to keep me sitting for hours in front of my laptop everyday.

visualnovels,3aznau,SuperBlooperYup,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:49:29 2015 UTC,"That's really good question, let's see...  I was interested in Steins;Gate as a science fiction story and it lives up to my expectations so far. I'm only little afraid it will fall apart near the end like two certain novels I've read, but foundation for every theory untill now is really solid, so no problem on that part.  On the other hand, I haven't thought too hard about rest of the game, considering it as an addition, I guess - so I'm still a little surprised how big this ""rest"" is. But still, those moments are okay, jokes tend to be funny and voice acting is great, only as I mentioned before I find Faris character jarring most of the time.  And by that I mean that there are parts taken from ""6/10 game"" in what otherwise is a great title - I'm afraid I haven't made that point clear enough earlier. I'm not hating this game as a whole, nor I'm suffering reading the worst (in my opinion) parts."
visualnovels,3aznau,Adonax,2,Wed Jun 24 23:44:55 2015 UTC,"Well, to justify all the Japanese anime culture, nearly the whole lab team are full of 2chan anime nerds. Daru, Okabe and Kurisu frequently reference lots of anime. It's not surprising then that moe culture would show up. Feris is pretty much a OTT stereotype of all the moe subculture anyway, you see a bit more depth in her real personality later in the game."

I started just a few days ago on S;G and while I'm really enjoying what's going on in the plot so far, (I'm in early/mid Ch. 3) Okabe's personality really grinds with the weight of events at times for me.  I don't have an issue exactly with his character type, but it's very jarring to be bouncing from something scientific and serious to utter ridiculousness in only a few lines.  Overall I'm having a positive experience so far, but I do have that complaint as well."

visualnovels,3aznau,ctom42,3,Thu Jun 25 23:03:12 2015 UTC,"True to my word, finished up Tokyo School Life and started Planetarian.  Final thoughts on TSL:  Before I played, I had heard that this was a very relaxed, light-hearted VN to go through.  I got a little too excited and bought it the day it came out on steam.  Months later, needing something short to go through, I saw it in my library and decided to go through it.  An hour in, I knew this was going to be one of those VNs.  One mentality shift later, I'm enjoying seeing just how terrible this VN can get.  The common route was an overdone mess that pandered endlessly to the ""otaku"" perspective that westerners possess; I was surprised at how accurately they handled it, however.  In Japan, the word ""otaku"" roughly translates to ""loser"" in English (correct me if I'm wrong JP speakers), and they're really treated as such.  Western cultures have a very glorified view of otaku, deciding to keep only the positive aspects of it and channeling all of the negative into the derogatory term ""weeaboo.""  TSL accurately pinned the stigma that comes with being an otaku.  Another theme they overplayed were the lolita culture of Japanese fashion, going so far as to design one of their characters almost entirely around it.  Yes, once again, it was represented accurately, but manifested poorly.  The individual character routes consisted of  two events ht are the same between each route save for which character you are with, and one individual event that's more of an amalgamation of somewhat dull ""character building"" moments jump-cutting between each other, finally ending in your standard confession, which even then is rather uninteresting.   All in all, it has a sloppy story that tries too hard, forgettable characters, and awkward dialogue, however each aspect of Japanese culture they reference is accurately portrayed, which is a very important in portraying in these types of works.  Most people who plan on reading this know what they're getting into, so recommendation isn't really an option here.  Don't get me wrong though - the story was terrible but I enjoyed going though it because it was terrible.  As for Planetarian...  Uh, it's okay, I guess.  Haven't read much of it yet, still in the first few chapters, but the scenario is very interesting; from what I know of Key, this definitely isn't a scenario I'd expect from them, but it's done well, and I'm enjoying the story so far."

visualnovels,3aznau,superange128,3,Thu Jun 25 09:40:01 2015 UTC,"I'm on the last route of Rewrite. I've really enjoyed the humor throughout. Also, as Key does very well, it's great to see everything come together in the end.  Chihaya Route: This was the first route I played. The way Kotarou could wind her up was often funny, though there were some times he just came off as a jerk. The best part of this route, in my opinion, I do wish  Lucia Route: I wanted to do Shizuru's second, but found out she needs to be unlocked. So I chose Lucia, instead. I thought this route was just okay. Her backstory I think overall I enjoyed her more as a side character during the common route than when she becomes the focus in her own route.  Kotori Route: Her odd sayings and random English were great elements throughout the common route. I didn't really know what to expect going into her route, since I was happy to find more of that oddball dynamic between Kotarou/Kotori, but this route also had some surprising elements. There was a lot to enjoy from this route. The ending  Akane Route: This was the first of the unlockable routes I chose to do. Honestly, a lot of this route seemed very forced to me. Kotarou The ending  Shizuru Route: Hexas!! Shizuru was one of my favorite characters throughout. Her interactions with Kotarou were always funny. She made a great accomplice to a lot of his schemes. Learning about her backstory I enjoyed seeing more of Esaka and Gen during this route. And Nishikujou, of course. My thoughts of the ending   Hidden Routes: I'm not quite finished with these yet. The first one, I'm still not quite sure if Either way, I thought they did a good job with it, and it made me really look forward to the final route, which I'm playing now."

'Scab' and 'Deadlock' are amazing at conveying a really sombre and tragic mood. A lot of the flashback scenes are greatly improved by them. And man does this game have a lot of flashbacks. I can't say for sure if I dislike it or not but it seems that every route has a lengthy flashback sequence. It's great to get the insight but it's somewhat heavy-handed as a storytelling method.  Yumiko's route is quite nice. Little Busters and Yumiko spoilers I felt the love between them was really strong and I feel it's probably the most natural of the pairings I've seen so far, even knowing that Sachi spoiler   Sachi's route is really good.

visualnovels,3aznau,AdelKoenig,3,Thu Jun 25 19:16:39 2015 UTC,"I've -started- reading several. Started meaning at most 2h in. I always tend to give VNs a short start, then wait a week or so, then power through it hour after hour. My issue now is that I've started several, and I'm not sure which one to pick first and when/how to continue.  First one is Tsukihime and frankly the artstyle is a bit boring. A lot of it reminds me of F/SN but I can understand that. HOWEVER, the story is interesting so far.     This is the VN that I'm most likely to continue, but we will see. Perhaps someone can offer advice.  Second is Grisaia no Kajitsu and I've expressed my dislike for Yuuji in the past around here. I have to say he has somewhat grown on me. I will not agree with my friend that thinks he's the best protag ever, but he's not as bad as I initially thought. I think his character introduction could've been done way better, and I think the introduction was what made me dislike him. It felt cheesy. I've come quite far in this VN though, I stumbled into Sakaki's route without realizing it.    I don't really know why I paused, but I keep wondering how much there is left on this route. Did it just start? Am I somewhere in the middle? How long is a route in this game? The common route proved to be quite a time sink with very little reward, I felt bored most of the time.  I have three other VN's on start-up mode, but I have more or less only installed them and checked out the art style. Those are Steins;Gate, Saya no Uta, and Umineko. Might go for Saya since it's supposedly a pretty short one."
visualnovels,3aznau,GregerMoek,3,Thu Jun 25 01:59:43 2015 UTC,"Tsukihime is an older VN, and that never really bothered me because I've always been much more into characters and stories than graphics.  Tsukihime has a really great story, and you are only just starting! I really liked the whole VN, especially the dark side of the moon (last 3 routes).  The recommended route order is Arcueid, Ciel, Akiha, Hisui, Kohaku. I started out doing the choices I wanted most, and I ended up on the Ciel route making Arcueid choices and it didn't turn out well with how stuck I got. I'd recommend deciding which route you want to do, and making choices centered around that person only and ignoring the others as much as you can early on."
visualnovels,3aznau,superange128,2,Thu Jun 25 02:38:44 2015 UTC,"Haha, I'm exactly the type of player that doesn't commit to anyone in the first playthrough until I have to. I guess I'll try to follow your advice though. So far Tsukihime has the best hook(for me) of the ones I'm having on hold, so I'll probably continue soon. Thanks."
visualnovels,3aznau,ctom42,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:43:05 2015 UTC,I also don't think Yuuji is evne close to the best VN protag ever   and I didn't really like his asshole-y humor at times in the common route but like you he grew on me throughout the routes.   That said of the main characters he's still the one I like least.

What I didn't like about GnK common route is that its about girls with mental issues and problems from the past, so you would think they would make some reveals about the girls to help you choose which one you want. Instead you go through a whole bunch of everyday stuff, and maybe one out of every 3 days you find out a small detail about a girls past. This went on for 15 hours and I was so happy when I heard I was near the end.  Like I promised myself in the beginning I'd start with sachi's route.

Seeing all the foreshadowing from the other routes  getting explained was cool and Kotarou got a lot more interesting compared to other routes.  I liked how Terra went basically from    All the forced choices were cool, I kinda hope they make a version where more of the choices are possible to pick see all the cool opportunities.

We had to resort to making our own images using cut out character sprites for a fair few couples."

But /r/VisualNovels always SOMEHOW manages to get me salty.  On one hand, I really like IrinaXJunichiro. MGFITP got me into the Visual Novel world.    On the other hand, TakeruXSumika's arc is one of the greatest stories I've ever seen, since I can relate to Takeru and Sumika in the story, even more so now that i'm playing PTSD in RNG Form Kantai Collection Alternative (My playthrough of Kantai Collection where /u/Daishomaru tries to change the fate of several Japanese Warship turned into cute girls in a tale of Love, Courage, and Fate.)  I feel like Takeru sometimes since there are several cute girls lives on my hands, and I KNOW I have to tell Kongou that she's my Major Muv-Luv/Kantai Collection Alternative Spoilers.

visualnovels,3av3yf,shogoki_vnz,2,Tue Jun 23 20:05:22 2015 UTC,It looks like there was no seeding done. Or at the very least the distribution into the 8 groups was done randomly.

visualnovels,3apia8,GanahaMode,5,Tue Jun 23 00:05:48 2015 UTC,It's not like voices are a limited commodity that should be distributed only to the best VNs. If a low quality VN has the budget for voices and thinks they are a good idea then they add voices.
visualnovels,3apia8,ctom42,3,Tue Jun 23 01:04:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I don't necessarily think there's a problem with low budget or even OELVN's getting voice acting, but what does perplex me is why they would have the dialogue spoken in Japanese when it's not even done by a Japanese studio for Japanese people. What is honestly the point in an OELVN speaking in Japanese? Trying to look more legitimate and appeal to VN ""purists"" who think it's not worth reading unless it's Japanese?  Personally I'd rather them hire English voice actors if it's an OELVN. Probably even shore up some added publicity if they hired some decently known voice actors."

visualnovels,3aqh9n,moogy0,7,Mon Jun 22 18:02:10 2015 UTC,"Some of us on IRC/Twitter got together and played through Maruto's Parfait over the past week or so.  I've already discussed the game to hell and back, so I don't really feel like typing up something long and elaborate again, but suffice to say that Parfait is great. I'd call it a textbook example of an eroge in a lot of ways - it might not blow your mind with an epic plot, but it is incredibly competent at nearly everything it does and every element of the game works together in harmony with one another. There's a pretty clear delineation between the common route and character routes in terms of what they focus on, but I felt that by the end everything had been tied together pretty nicely and that the game's ""world"" and characters felt consistent and believable.  Parfait doesn't really bring anything ""new"" to the table (though Ema and Rikako's routes might not be what you expect from the game initially), but I feel that it's a title that both newcomers and veterans to eroge can appreciate equally due both to how polished it is as a product and to Maruto's smooth, consistently entertaining writing. Like I said, it might not change your world or anything, but if I were making a ""guide to eroge"" or something then it would definitely make the cut. It has a 90 median on EGS for a reason.  So yeah, Maruto is cool. Just finished reading the most recent volume of Saekano an hour or so ago, in fact, and he's as consistent as ever 10 years since the release of Parfait (though Saekano is pretty different from his eroge). Looking forward to Classroom Crisis, an original anime written by him, next season.  By the way, if you do play Parfait, save Ema and Rikako's routes for last and do them in order of Ema --> Rikako. Trust me."

First untranslated game I've read without any voices which was a bit strange at first but it worked well for the mood in some scenes. It had a small scale (compared to Fate and Tsukihime) but interesting story and an enjoyable set of main characters. I look forward to the sequels when they come out in 20 years (each!).

Just like the second game, this game also had a unique story underneath all the H scenes. In a post-apocalyptic world, a single man living alone in a long long tower. Beginning the game was mostly slice of life. After halfway through the story advances and such.    OST was great and didn't bore me. I loved the title theme. Happoubi Jin's perfect girls were perfect as always too. There were a ton of H scenes as usual. I'm sure everyone enjoyed their cup of tea.    The main Bishoujo Mangekyou story is still continuing, making me wonder how many more games do I have play for that to finish.    Reading difficulty: Semi-Hard. When the protag goes in Maddo-Scientisto mode you might have a hard time understanding him.    Also read the 2.5th game 美少女万華鏡 -かつて少女だった君へ- Bishoujo Mangekyou -Katsute Shoujo Datta Kimi e-    Not much to say here because it was a short game. Took around 2 hours. As our ""main main girl"" says it was ""A story not suitable for the kaleidoscope."" There was a little unexpected surprise though.

visualnovels,3aqh9n,Chronopolize,3,Mon Jun 22 21:34:39 2015 UTC,"Picked up Hotel Ergriffen a while ago.  It's an obscure game made in 2001 by some unknown company. I'm pretty surprised the game has no votes though. I thought some people might have at least tried the game from seeing the art.   It's a quite short novel, set in a hotel which the MC finds himself at as he dreams. The game is non-linear, you pick from 3 of the heroines 5 times, and based on how exclusively you pick the heroines, the more coridal, or at least intimate rather than carnal the relations are. Quite a lot of variation, about 12 scenes for each herione (5 + 4 + 3 + 2 +1, minus some duplicates). The H varies, maybe about 2-3 H-scenes, 4-6 scenes with an H-quality, and 2-6 other scenes per herione. Often the scene cuts ought abruptly, and only leaves the implication of sex.  The first thing I noticed was the purple prose. It's thick. But I liked the use of prose here, as it's appropriate for what they were trying to do and gets utilized to good effect. At the core, it's describing things in ways I've never seen anything close to. The images, text, and music work in tandem, particularly the text and the images are very . It's my rather subjective experience, but I've really come to like just steeping in the dreamy sensorial atmosphere. I even go as far as to study the words （茫洋、艶笑、艶やか、媚態、磁器） and individual kanji (聖性、美影) so I can reread the scenes with the proper associations.  To people who like the atmosphere and don't mind the prose, it's a unique gem."

It's the debut work of Pulltop Air, another subsidiary of Pulltop (with Pulltop Latte being the other -- they produced KoiRizo).   I liked that Natsuiro managed to maintain that 'Pulltop spirit' (which I'd describe as something like a tale of maturity interwoven by diligence &  friendship), but it manages to present itself as doing something different from its predecessors (in this case, by having notable time skips; the other Pulltop works take place within a discrete period of time).   Natsuiro boasts a lot of pretty food art. I posted a few random ones at the end of my review, but there's probably at least 15-20 dishes. Like all other Pulltop games, it's atmospheric, and the protagonist is a comparatively average, but dependable & solid lead.

I haven't progressed too much in Himawari, though I appreciate Asuka a lot more since she's extremely amazing and hilarious. Parfait has a very fleshed out vivacious cast that feels like everyone has a unique purpose and personality that exceeds the classic ""trope"". I'm going to finish that up before Himawari probably since as of yet, Parfait seems a bit more fun, though it's possible that Himawari blows me away since I am expecting a substantial paradigm shift that spices it up. I just started my read through from the beginning (I read the 80% patch a while back but now I'm trying it raw) a few hours ago so I'm still on Down the Rabbit Hole 1.

visualnovels,3aqh9n,nogaku,3,Mon Jun 22 18:55:34 2015 UTC,"Since the game takes place over a single night it mightn't seem all that long, but since a single hour may be shown several times through different perspectives it starts to add up. But overall, it's a work of average length.  As it focuses on an ensemble cast there are no routes, as such. From what I can recall there are ten endings, each of which can be triggered through whether you decide to shoot or not at opportune moments. It's quite a unique system, but what's really interesting is that this also applies the first time you read it, meaning that you've a 1/10 chance of getting the true ending that first time. In general you progress by clicking on viewpoints (which you can see here), and to move on you must have read all the viewpoints for that hour. There also is no save function, it instead autosaving whenever you exit.  Let me know if you'd like to know anything else about it."
visualnovels,3aqh9n,riruru,3,Mon Jun 22 20:10:03 2015 UTC,"Nitro+ sure integrates some interesting/sadistic elements into their games--I mean, the absence of save/load system and the random possibility of endings will mean that I'll have to see whether they work for it or against it.  But, let's say that I only want to read the True Ending. Does that mean that I can just cheatsheet with a walkthrough? Or will I have to randomly mix my choices several times until I click into the True Ending route?"
visualnovels,3aqh9n,nogaku,3,Mon Jun 22 20:29:25 2015 UTC,"The unpredictability matches the Russian roulette style game the characters themselves are participating in, so if anything it at least works very well in accommodating that.

The instruments seem very high quality compared to most visual novels mainly. Suzuna's and Kogomi's sprites feel a little off for some reason, but I'm no artist so I couldn't tell you why."
visualnovels,3aqh9n,hyperknees91,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:25:19 2015 UTC,"I just finished reading Natsuiro.   I liked Yuzu & Ryouka the most too -- the other two didn't seem as relevant. I really like the cooking music; it's upbeat, and fun.   I agree that the sprites seem a little off. Pulltop Latte suffers from this too (in case of KoiRizo). In that work, Shiori looks cross-eyed at times."

visualnovels,3aonyk,Raithfyre,19,Mon Jun 22 06:24:08 2015 UTC,"Just played about an hour or so of the demo. Overall, my impressions were pretty positive.  The art-style is attractive and comfortable, while still being unique.  The music, except for a few weird scenes, generally fit the background/event/interaction and wasn't too hard on the ears.  The backgrounds were detailed, and the characters were all pretty different.  I also liked that you went to a few extra lengths to keep the story immersive, ie; the main menu being the phone, and the text-log being a phone as well.  Story-wise, it was interesting enough, but I found it a little hard to get into right off the bat.  It was nice that you guys are going the route of ""start with a bang, then rollback to everything leading to that point"" but it was a bit like... when you're on a highway and doing 60, then taking an exit for a local road and having to drop down to 25.  It took awhile for the story to rev back up to being engaging again.  All-in-all, the story looks fun, and it looks like it'll be an entertaining read.  Looking forward to your full release in the future."
visualnovels,3aonyk,vnanism,8,Mon Jun 22 07:36:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! I understand exactly where you're coming from. It's something we'll look into improving for the full release. Again, thank you so much for playing <3"
visualnovels,3aonyk,vnanism,6,Mon Jun 22 14:05:06 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. In terms of Indies, its one of the prettier ones I've seen. If you guys can tweak the intro a bit to be more engaging after the 'prologue' I think it could end up being pretty high up on the list of English/Indie vns.  Also, someone else in the thread commented on the lack of voices being a bad move and I'm tempted to agree, but at the same time, bad voice acting would be worse than no voice acting. If it isn't done properly, you could potentially destroy the characters. I saw that Japanese voices might be a stretch goal, which is a smart move, and it probably shouldn't happen unless you've got the funds to guarantee the same level of quality on the voices as you do the art."
visualnovels,3aonyk,vnanism,4,Mon Jun 22 18:35:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, voice acting is something I'd love to do, but good quality VA costs in the tens of thousands of dollars, maybe even a hundred thousand. At this point in time, it's simply not feasible =/"
visualnovels,3aonyk,Vellon221,6,Mon Jun 22 18:42:11 2015 UTC,"Well, Oelvns without voice acting are pretty commonplace, so I don't think it's that big of a deal. It might not be too impossible to have VA just for a few key scenes, though. Might also add to the immersion, something like have the climax of each route voiced, or have the first romantic encounter with each heroine voiced.   Either way, as long as your character development is strong enough, I think most readers will get over the lack of voices."
visualnovels,3aonyk,Taedirk,8,Mon Jun 22 18:49:06 2015 UTC,"Read the first 30 minutes or so, and it doesn't really line up with your stated plot.

Advancements in fields like robotics have made a lot of jobs redundant   Guy sits and talks with two people, goes and picks up food like normal.

That one gets a bit better if you keep going.  The ""normal"" scenes are played up to show as mostly abandoned and anachronistic (rare to see a manned register, abandoned highrises, common meeting places like arcades or ice cream parlors now a nostalgia relic).  The drug use scenes are definitely out of place though."
visualnovels,3aonyk,Vellon221,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:44:01 2015 UTC,"I didn't really find it out of place. There are people who just use drugs recreationally without being complete junkies, and I don't think Ken was a too inaccurate example of one. I've never used it myself, but living in a country where weed is legal (Netherlands) it matches up with the way I've seen people casually smoke weed before. (Notably, the convention center scene reminded me of how some people I knew in high school have gone to school while high before. Again; normal people, subtle enough that I never noticed until they told me they've done that a couple times.)  The only big problem I had with the drug use is how casually Ken overdosed right before going to the convention center. I guess there's some leeway with ambrosidone being a fictional drug, but holy fuck man. With most drugs, overdosing like that gets you killed. Even if ambrosidone is hard to overdose on, you'd at least be more hesitant about that shit.  I'm also slightly confused about what kind of drug ambrosidone is. For the most part it seems like weed in how it calms you down, yet it also seems to be a hallucinogen? But considering ambrosidone is fictional I guess we can let it off the hook for this one as long as they keep it consistent."

visualnovels,3aonyk,LeafCascade,2,Mon Jun 22 19:26:21 2015 UTC,I'm partial to G-Senjou no Maou and Saya no Uta. I also play the odd nukige from time to time.
visualnovels,3aonyk,Auric_Orange,2,Wed Jun 24 07:26:38 2015 UTC,I'd be interested in knowing the answer to this as well. Do you guys have VNDBs?
visualnovels,3aonyk,LeafCascade,4,Mon Jun 22 19:55:15 2015 UTC,"I do, but I haven't updated it in forever. I think I'm probably the only person who does. My favorite VN is Symphonic Rain. Other than that, I like Grisaia and Key's stuff. I also really love Katahane. Basically, I'm more of a fun of the really big titles than anything. Not super into Nitro+. Going to read Umineko next, whenever I have the time."
visualnovels,3aonyk,Bobemmo,3,Mon Jun 22 20:10:23 2015 UTC,"I've never made a VNDB profile, I'm afraid. That aside, my favourite is Rin's route from Katawa Shoujo. I also enjoyed Planetarian, Ever17, SnU, and Cave Cave Deus Videt."
visualnovels,3aonyk,LeafCascade,8,Mon Jun 22 21:11:09 2015 UTC,"I gave it a try as I'm currently between VNs. I'm not much for OELVNs (for some reason, Sturgeon's law seems to be especially prevalent among them), but I thought that I'd give your demo a try in hope of a pleasant surprise.   I didn't like it very much. I found the dialogue pretty boring, forced, and even kind of cringeworthy. It just screams OELVN and I had to force my way through it. The art is a mixed bag. For example, Setsuna's CG right at the beginning compared to her inferior sprite left me disappointed. I have to say though, the CGs and the BGs are absolutely amazing.   Also... things like the convention center scene... just don't. It screams of Steins;Gate and just gives off a vibe that says you lack originality. Music's okay, it's just kind of impressionless - just like the rest of the demo, I'm afraid. Making what appears to be a charage without voices just isn't a good idea, in my opinion.   Sorry if I was overly harsh. Time to read more Nitroplus."
visualnovels,3aonyk,ctom42,4,Mon Jun 22 16:48:32 2015 UTC,Sturgeon's Law is prevalent in OELVNs because you don't have a translator as a buffer between you and all the stuff out there.  I have no doubt there are tons of pretty awful Japanese VNs neither of us have ever heard of.
visualnovels,3aonyk,qazplm79,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:22:39 2015 UTC,"True. But there's also the fact that there aren't really any praised, large-scale visual novel companies here in the West. Even if my Japanese was good enough, I don't think I'd really be reading doujin VNs regardless. Not to say that many of their doujin groups probably aren't far more experienced and adept than ours, because I can certainly imagine that is the case."

The writing was really engaging. Only complaint I have, I have to wait after the demo ended at such a good spot. Anyway, good luck with production. I hope it goes well, with an early release? maybe? hopefully?"
visualnovels,3aonyk,Auric_Orange,3,Mon Jun 22 15:04:34 2015 UTC,I dig it. Backed.
visualnovels,3aonyk,Wraithseeker,3,Mon Jun 22 16:35:51 2015 UTC,"I downloaded the demo and went in without any expectations; OELVNs almost always suck, and though Sekai Project picking it up implies it's one of the better OELVNs I was expecting it to be mediocre. As such, I was very surprised to find out it was the best OELVN I've read so far, miles ahead of other OELVNs. Despite my initial skepticism I went from 'this isn't bad for an OELVN' to 'this is pretty good for an OELVN' to enjoying it more than many Japanese VNs. I'm definitely looking forward to the rest, though it's a real shame it's gonna take ages before we get to play more of it.  What I liked most were the writing and characters; the conversations are consistently entertaining and interesting and all the characters are likeable; I even grew to like characters that felt uninteresting at first impression once they got their proper screentime.  Minor criticisms and remarks:   Software-wise, the game does something weird with rendering which causes all screenshots taken (using PrintScreen or something like IrfanView) to be completely black. This is a real shame as I like taking screenshots of interesting quotes and conversations. [Windows] The scene transitions are frequently too abrupt. It's nice to have a short (couple seconds at most) break between scenes, and when done properly they also serve as good indicators of places where you can stop reading and return later without suddenly missing a lot of context. Unfortunately, they don't work well in the current build. Fading to black and waiting for two seconds or so works for this, or you can use title cards (I think that's what they're called?) like some other VNs (stuff like this or this or this). (Title cards usually display the date, but not always; notably, many games with date title cards display the character name instead on routes.) The second meeting (third meeting? Second with the small group) felt very, very short. The first time seemed intentional, but the second time barely anything was discussed before they ended the meeting. If I was called to the meeting I'd be angry over having to travel all that way for what, 10 minutes of discussion? Yet nobody seems bothered by it (and not even in the 'I don't like it but at least I expected this' way). The art is very inconsistent at times, particularly between sprites and CGs. Most notably, Shion's sprite looks completely different from her CG in the bar. The difference is so jarring it breaks immersion. The backgrounds sometimes looked too artificial to me; were they 3D-rendered and then traced, or perhaps even just filtered after rendering? Because that's what it looks like sometimes. Sometimes the backgrounds look fine, but other times the peculiar look feel distracting. But maybe that's just me. The game needs more QC. There were several places with missing words and punctuation. Unfortunately due to the screenshot issue I don't have any direct examples. About the Kickstarter: Although at this point you can't change it anymore, I don't like how none of the money goes to the writers. What made the demo great was the writing, not the art or sound. I'd like to support the writers too."
visualnovels,3aonyk,thesmashening,2,Thu Jun 25 16:25:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks very much for the feedback, I'm glad you enjoyed it.  As one of the writers, I can say I do this for passion, and I think the others feel the same.  To pay us even a few thousand each would have doubled the cost of production, yet I would have earned many, many times that by spending my time flipping burgers for the last year.  I do this because I enjoy making VNs, and because I like to take pride in my work. That some people have enjoyed the demo has also been really cool. If you want to pay us back, give as much feedback as you can to help us improve, and help support the continued development of us and other visual novelists in the west."
visualnovels,3aonyk,Taedirk,2,Thu Jun 25 21:45:05 2015 UTC,"Also, I should add that most of the artists have studied their craft at a higher level, and are planning to make careers of it. The writers are all amateurs, and only one of us has any English training post-high school."
visualnovels,3aonyk,VDZx,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:49:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much! A bunch of the criticisms are gonna be addressed in a blog post I'll be making soon, but I'll respond to a couple of the others.  First off, the screenshot thing: I know what you're talking about, but I'm not really sure what causes it or how to fix it =/ I had a similar issue where every screenshot that I took was of a particular scene, even when I'd already moved passed it. Will see if we can figure it out and release a bug fix.  Backgrounds are all going to be entirely redone for the full release. For the demo, they were done by two different artists, and for various reasons, a couple of them are just WIP's (the arcade background, for instance). For the full-release, everything will be redone by a different, third artist, and that will help both consistency and quality.  Finally, your last thing about the money: as one of the writers, I'm really glad to hear you say that! =) At the same time though, we simply wouldn't have the budget for it if we were paying ourselves. When we decided to go commercial, we all mutually agreed that we were fine with not making any money off the game, and any time we brought on a new writer, they had to be okay with that too. In fact, even once the full game is released, we won't be taking a cut of sales - everything that we make off the game, after the distributors' cuts and SP's cut, will simply go into a fund for future games. We all decided that we would rather be able to pay for top quality art than make a few bucks ourselves, since really, anything we made would have to be split 6 ways, and that would just be so small a number per person that it's not worth it."

It seems like an oddly designed character flaw that doesn't really reflect anywhere else.  Like someone wanted to add some designer drug use to the story but didn't quite know how to design it or where to introduce it.  Seems like something that would be better to approach with a different character using it and transitioning from watching to doing with whatever resolution that leads towards."

visualnovels,3anany,jfietkau,2,Tue Jun 23 02:24:29 2015 UTC,"So I guess I'll write a few words about the Oblivious Garden couples I nominated before they inevitably get eliminated due to unpopularity...  Irell x Lin: While her route is probably the most non-bullshit one in terms of plot coherence, Lin's chemistry with Irell hasn't left much of a lasting impression on me. I liked the point where she starts seeing him more as an equal than a dilettante, but that's about it.  Irell x Dyanna: There's a lot of tragedy in this pairing that could have been great, if only they'd started developing her earlier. As it stands, most of the interesting relationship stuff happens during the wat part of her route, and thus was lost on me because I had a hard time taking the plot at face value. YMMV.  Irell x Finn: Here's where it gets interesting because the VN plays to its strengths: the conflict arises from Irell's emotions blatantly contradicting his and Finn's social standing. She tries so hard to convey to him that him being friendly to her is Bad with a capital B, but at the same time she's not allowed to defy or contradict him. The idea that he could have actual romantic feelings for her is so foreign to her that she even  just because she's going down her mental list of things he could be wanting from her and it's the next best thing to make sense. And then when it finally clicks and they ... A shame her route is so short! I think my most memorable moments between her and Irell are when he pulls a major goof and she gets to deliver one of her masterful ""Clearly it would not be proper if such a thing happened, but as an educated man of course you knew that already YOU DENSE MOTHERFUCKER "" speeches.  Irell x Leira: Similar constellation, but in reverse. I started hate-loving Leira immediately when literally the first thing she does is to order Irell to commit suicide. And then what starts out looking like a ""thaw the ice queen"" kinda plotline becomes so much more when their shared history gets revealed, and they both drive each other to confront their inner demons and he becomes her confidante, and then the good end of her route is just about the most adorable thing ever. And I have to admit that when I say that this is my favorite couple from the VN, the bunny incident probably does play a small role."
visualnovels,3anany,ctom42,4,Mon Jun 22 01:19:09 2015 UTC,"Well I voted. I made sure to never vote for two couples that shared a character, and to not vote for a couple that I did not think was good even if I loved one or both of the characters."
visualnovels,3anany,AdelKoenig,5,Sun Jun 21 22:56:10 2015 UTC,"Since the voting is mainly to determine seeding and weed the numbers down to a manageable size, voting for only one couple per character might be detrimental. But I suppose that is just part of how you view the competition."
visualnovels,3anany,ctom42,3,Sun Jun 21 23:24:02 2015 UTC,"voting for only one couple per character might be detrimental   Not in the slightest. I'm not voting for characters, I'm voting for couples. If the OTP for that character does not win, I would not want another pairing for that couple to win, I would prefer a different set of characters altogether. Thus there is no advantage in voting for non-optimal couples.   Similarly I did not vote for a couple just because I liked both characters. If I did not think they were a good enough couple, they did not get my vote. So no Rewrite couples (Kotarou was far too bland) despite Shizuru being one of my favorites. No Dlanor x Erika, etc."
visualnovels,3anany,Kron0_0,4,Mon Jun 22 03:20:25 2015 UTC,So youre way of thinking on this is    if it aint my otp it can burn.   Cause i can get behind this.
visualnovels,3anany,AdelKoenig,2,Mon Jun 22 06:43:50 2015 UTC,"Frankly, I'd rather see Shirou and Saber over Shiki and Ciel, even though the OTP for F/SN is Sakura and Shirou. Voting one relationship per character would deny me a vote for the party I wanted to win. Hopefully this won't happen though.   I get your point about the OTP deserving more attention, but I don't trust others to keep the OTP of Sakura and Shirou alive over lesser, but still good relationships that Shirou had."

On an endeavor to avoid it I ended up being spoiled anyway. Is this going to suck the enjoyment out of the story? It does seem like an enormous plot twist.
visualnovels,3ambdp,BHokori,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:33:34 2015 UTC,"If I am correct, and is THAT translation error, yep, it's something 'more or less' important, but even so, it's not enough so you cannot enjoy the story, just don't think much about it, go and try to read it."

In Extra The other two bugs occur in credits sequences when they play little video things, the only way to get past them is to minimize the screen before it transitions to the credits from the scrolling CG. You might have to disable some setting in the config as well, but I don't recall the specific one right now.  Alternative is fine."

I was on 8.1 (it was just a few weeks ago).  1) The ending cutscenes for Muv Luv Extra and Unlimited fail to complete.  2) There's a bug during one of the cutscenes in one of the main heroine's routes Extra.  Both of these bugs result in a crash of the game that prevents you from continuing. For the first one, a number of people posted suggestions for how to get around it and I spent a few hours trying them all to no avail. You need to finish Meiya and Sumika's routes to get to Unlimited, so my workaround was finding a save file from the very beginning of Unlimited and just loading that once I had ""finished"" their routes in Extra. I still have that save if you want it.   For the second bug, you can just make a different choice to get a different scene and it won't affect your ability to progress on that character's route. If you want to know the details: Muv-Luv Extra Minor Spoilers  Alternative played with no errors whatsoever.  PS: The ending bug for Unlimited will prevent you from seeing an extra scene with Yuuko but it's really skippable."

Second question, do you reach a point where the female protagonists are more relatable, down to earth and a little less dramatic? For example, characters being overly Tsundere?"

Second question, do you reach a point where the female protagonists are more relatable, down to earth and a little less dramatic? For example, characters being overly Tsundere?   Grisaia has two distinct narrative styles: comedy-mode and drama-mode. The first one exists to make you become comfortable with the characters and laugh at well translated jokes.

Yuuji is an asshole and there is a very realistic, natural issue that causes his assholery. There are some routes where he shows a lot of regard for other people and others where he doesn't. I do agree that his personality sometimes kills the moments for me.  In  route in particular, he's an idiot without empathy and that makes the final scenes painful, so I recommend leaving that for last."

visualnovels,3ambdp,Durende,3,Thu Jun 25 23:21:44 2015 UTC,"I just discovered that once I enter an instance where there is no text to 'recollect', the arrows blink uncontrollably, so I think there is some sort of error in recognizing keyboard inputs, even if my keyboard and mouse are not connected.  EDIT: I started reading it on my laptop, and it runs perfectly; that means it's an issue of my computer and not the program itself. My computer itself has been pretty untrustworthy lately, so I feel like I may need to wipe it and build back up to that point."
visualnovels,3ambdp,falafel_eater,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:30:22 2015 UTC,Before wiping everything clean try just updating/replacing the keyboard drivers. If that does not work than it may be hardware issue with the port you are using (although this is extremely unlikely if it is a USB keyboard)

visualnovels,3ambdp,8cccc9,3,Thu Jun 25 20:04:49 2015 UTC,What is the best handheld platform for VNs?
visualnovels,3ambdp,insanityissexy,3,Thu Jun 25 15:11:36 2015 UTC,"3DS. Since you can play both DS and 3DS VNs you would have:   The Whole Ace Attorney series (6 games released officially, 7 if you include Layton crossover) 999  Virtue's Last Reward   Plus some other games that have some VN-ish stuff I haven't tried out.  By Contrast Vita only has the two DanganRonpa games and (the less buggy version of) Virtue's Last Reward."
visualnovels,3ambdp,8cccc9,3,Thu Jun 25 17:27:46 2015 UTC,"I would also say 3DS, but only by a small margin. It really just depends on what you want. I'll just add a little bit to your list...  For the DS there are additionally:   Hotel Dusk & Last Window Another Code Jake Hunter Time Hollow and Lux Pain, though they're supposed to not be good (Ghost Trick)   And for the 3DS:   Hakuoki   For the Vita, there are additionally:   Steins;Gate The BlazBlue franchise, that is Calamity Trigger, Continuum Shift, Chrono Phantasma and the related Xblaze Code: Embryo Hakuoki   And through the PS store these PSP games:   The Corpse Party series, that is, the first two entries Sweet Fuse (Fate/Extra) (Disgea Infinite)"

visualnovels,3ambdp,FinalNwo,5,Thu Jun 25 23:42:42 2015 UTC,"i shouldn't read this as a straight male, right?    It's not good to approach any visual novel with a mindset like that. You may not be the target demographic for the game, but it's not like you'll be unable to enjoy it.   Clarifying at the request of /u/8cccc9:  Hakuouki's main appeal is indeed the interesting historical setting. I'd say it's anything but a typical otoge. There's battles, politics, and mystery; just happens that most of the characters happen to be cute guys. And if I remember correctly, there's barely any romance.  Though I should say that I am the target demographic and I didn't particularly like it. Couldn't be bothered to read more than one route."
visualnovels,3ambdp,EpicSauceGirl,5,Fri Jun 26 09:19:57 2015 UTC,"There is no such as ""should"" or ""shouldn't"", just read whatever you like. I've read a few otome games I liked, but I also read a few ones that I didn't like, so it just depends. If the protagonist isn't some blank self-insert, it can be quite interesting to see the relationship from a female perspective.  As for the question whether you'd likely enjoy Hakuoki as a straight male or not: I'm not sure, but from what I could gather Hakuoki's main appeal is the historical setting with its political themes. /u/insanityissexy apparently read it (partially), so maybe she can clarify that matter a bit more?"

As it turns out, Muv-Luv Alternative is the highest rated VN there. However, it's a sequel to Muv-Luv which has rather mediocre ratings. I was planning to go ahead and read Muv-Luv anyway since hey, they're a series but I'm starting to have my doubts when even the translators notes read ""Enjoy the worst game we have ever translated (so far)"" Additionally, I've heard you have to do some... hacky things regarding your Windows version and locale (but hey, I can always brute force that in a virtual machine)  Still, at this point I have to ask. Is Muv-Luv worth spending my money on? Should I skip straight to Alternative, since everyone loves that? Or maybe I should outright give up on that series and go read something else? Anyone got ideas?"

visualnovels,3ambdp,ChunkySquare,2,Fri Jun 26 18:51:32 2015 UTC,Alternative's plot relies on stuff you experience by finishing Extra (and Unlimited) so in this case skipping is NOT an option.

Alternative is pretty much the best translated VN available (totally unbiased opinion here), it'd be a shame to miss it."

visualnovels,3ambdp,ctom42,3,Thu Jun 25 06:11:22 2015 UTC,"According to the hint given in the flag list, you need to go to school. Perhaps the latter doesn't have the exclamation mark, but since school is a sub-zone, some events inside can and probably will have the mark.  As far as I remember, if you go to school, you are forced to stay there until evening. This may be the reason why the mark doesn't appear: the needed events aren't available right from the start of the day, and if you choose not to go to school in the morning, you won't be able to visit it at a later time of the day, again missing the plot events."
visualnovels,3ambdp,Yodude1,2,Thu Jun 25 06:30:08 2015 UTC,Thought I had already tried all of the school events but apparently the answer was to read one I had already read before. I'm pretty confused myself but thanks for making me reread them one more time.

visualnovels,3ambdp,Yodude1,2,Thu Jun 25 22:12:16 2015 UTC,I remember getting stuck at this exact point. I think the issue is that there is some other flag you need to have triggered before watching that scene for it to raise the correct flag for you to get the next scene. Very poor game design.

I did not have the time or drive at the time to practice writing and rewriting the scenes to get them right, so I quickly gave up.

visualnovels,3ambdp,manuchi1,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:44:15 2015 UTC,It doesn't matter at all that much. The route you get after the common one is determined by the choices which don't involve strengthening.
visualnovels,3ambdp,ctom42,2,Wed Jun 24 17:41:05 2015 UTC,"Well it does change some dialogue in  route I think. If you .  Though as far as route choices go, yeah it has no effect."

visualnovels,3ambdp,ctom42,2,Wed Jun 24 10:14:36 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I just recently started reading Fate/stay night fate route because I really wanna know everything about the VN, the anime and whatnot. And according to most people, if you are really committed you should first watch the VNs. Now, I have been watching it for about 3 days now, with at least 3 hours of watching per day, but I noticed that the story moves REALLY slowly. So I googled how long it was approximately and I found out it is about 65-66 hours long (http://howlongtobeat.com/game.php?id=3416). Now I'm pretty new to VNs, haven't seen that many, maybe 1 or 2. But can someone please tell me if this information is true? I mean, holy shit buckets and gravy I can't believe that it could last this long. As much as I would like to watch it till the end I really don't have the patience I think. And that makes me sad. I wanna see everything (yes including the H scenes which I'm highly looking forward to :P). And after that there is the Unlimited Blade Works route (which has 2 endings, I meant to see them both) and Heaven's Feel (which also has 2 endings I wanted to see). Now if these 2 were as long as the Fate route, that would mean there is 330 hours of VN (if you watch the entire UBW route and Heaven's Feel route again for the second ending). That's 14 days of just straight VN. I'm not that patient, and I think I'd go insane. And I would really hate to read the summary, plus I'd miss the H scenes :D. If this is hard to answer in any way, shape or form. Just tell me how many days in total are there, I'm currently at day 7."
visualnovels,3ambdp,mbac1,6,Tue Jun 23 21:30:59 2015 UTC,"By ""watch"" you mean read it, rather than watching a let's play, right?  The 66 hour figure is actually for all three routes, rather than a single one - I have never heard of a 330 hour VN!  Well, unless you're me and are slowly getting through Baldr Sky with a less-than-substantial knowledge of Japanese; in which case, it'd come close enough.  Also, note that reading time is dependent on your reading speed.  I used a FAQ and read pretty quickly, so I was looking at like 30ish hours instead.  Do note that the first route is generally considered to be the worst, so if you're not really feeling it, try to stick it out until UBW.  Anyway, the anime is nothing compared to the VN so I do recommend trying to stay with the VN.  If patience is an issue, just consult a FAQ to go for the endings you want and see if that helps.  Note: different endings for a single route don't necessitate you to play through the whole thing again; there is plenty of overlap so you can just skip through that."
visualnovels,3ambdp,ctom42,3,Tue Jun 23 21:50:10 2015 UTC,"I have never heard of a 330 hour VN!   I think Kamidori Alchemy Meister can definitely hit that mark, but it's a lot of gameplay (JRPG/VN). You'd have to play through around 5 times for 100%."

visualnovels,3ambdp,AdelKoenig,3,Wed Jun 24 06:44:53 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Umineko clocks in at around 200 hours if you listen to all the voices.

visualnovels,3ambdp,Cornetto_Man,5,Wed Jun 24 20:47:15 2015 UTC,"Well, I say watch because I turn on auto-read and lay in my bed reading subtitles, so I guess it's somewhere in between watching and reading. My reading speed is above average. I'm completely fluent in English (not to brag but I was rated #1 in an English competition in my country 3 years ago :P), so that's not a problem. Where I made the mistake was thinking that only a single route was 66-ish hours. And I got 330 hours by calculating 66x5, since I thought that one route was 66 hours, and there are 3 routes, two of which I read on another Reddit thread have 2 different endings, and I thought about watching the entire route again for the different ending, so it would make it another 66 hours by my calculations which were obviously way off :D. Really, first route is the worst? I read on multiple forums that it was the best. I think it's pretty good so far, apart from the story going extremely slow. As for the patience issue, it's not a problem if it takes around 70 hours for the entire thing, all three routes I mean. I wanna do all three routes firstly by my own choices, making saves where ever there is a choice to be made so that later I can just go back to it when I do actually use an FAQ to get the desired ending. But haven't been doing that for the Fate route as I read that there is only a single ending. It's not a problem if I do end up going back though. Now I'm thinking of pulling a couple of allnighters and finishing it all in one go. Thanks for the quick reply, owe you one, I was close to abandoning it and just reading the summary, which I would've very much regretted as soon as I found out my mistake. Oh, and as for the anime, as I said previously I intend to watch and read absolutely everything there is about fate/stay night, fate/zero and whatever else there is. So after I finish the VN, I plan on watching the anime also, there is another question I have there, but it's not about VNs, so I'll leave it out. Thanks again."
visualnovels,3ambdp,Hungalas,2,Tue Jun 23 23:05:38 2015 UTC,"Save at every choice if you want to see the bad ends. I like to get them as I go, but that requires a guide. Also HF has 2 really good bad ends that get their own names.   2 endings for a route does not mean that you have to replay the whole route, jut from the last choice in the route.   I did ~2 days per day, and it seemed to go rather quickly.   I can answer your other questions about the series too. If you are going for full immersion in the Nasuverse, this guide is a bit dated, but good!"
visualnovels,3ambdp,mbac1,2,Wed Jun 24 17:55:28 2015 UTC,"So it's just the last choice that gives the different ending? I thought it was most probably gonna be somewhere in the middle or something, that's why I said I'd re-watch it. I don't care about the bad ends, they are unimportant to me. Thanks."
visualnovels,3ambdp,Hungalas,2,Thu Jun 25 09:48:38 2015 UTC,So it's just the last choice that gives the different ending?   In some VNs this is the case but not FSN. FSN works on a flag system where you need to choose a number of choices (or not choose them) in order to get specific endings. So to get a different ending you might need to go back quite a few days in game. Thankfully FSN has a handy scene skip option that allows you skip whole scenes that you've read before rather than having to fast forward.

It's the consensus that I have seen at least, but better to read it and decide for yourself anyway.  Glad to hear it, hope you enjoy the rest of the series.  Well, the FAQ suggestion had more to do with the multiple bad endings scattered across the VN - 40 or so of them, if I recall correctly.  I don't know how you'd feel about the (original) anime after the VN, but F/Z is a must-watch.  The UBW anime is getting some good scores, but I haven't seen it for myself yet.  No problem"

For generations, the men of the Susuharai family have left home at a fixed age to become independent. By tempering themselves without aid, they would have their adulthood recognized. In preparation for that day, I learned an array of things.  Susuda Prefectural High School—my new halls of leaning. To tell the truth, I had planned to transfer my first year, not second. But my everyday life here wasn't just carefree; it was pleasant. I passed the days happily with any of my peers from Second Year Class A.  But there was a girl—Kurokami Toe. To call her strange would be a lacking description. Never for a moment would she let go of the traditional Japanese doll she held in her arms. There were those who whispered it was a cursed doll, whose hair would grow when you weren't looking. Indeed, it was an eerie doll.  However, meeting Kurokami might have been fate. No, it must have been."

Then, relying only on themselves, they train body and soul until they are accepted as adults. And so I prepared myself for this day, learning a great many things so I'd be ready to live on my own.  Suzuta* Prefectoral High School. My new school. Originally, I planned to enter in first year rather than transfer in second year. Life at school is carefree, and even pleasant. Everyone has a great time in class 2-A.  There's just... her. Toe Kurokami. ""Weird"" doesn't begin to describe her. Always holding that Japanese doll against her chest, never letting go for a second. Some whisper it is a cursed doll, whose hair grows when no one is looking. But it's just an uncanny doll, with nothing special about it.  Yet, perhaps my meeting that girl was fate... No, it was fate.

Reception of article  RapeLay:       Critics of violent game imagery, such as British Member of Parliament Keith Vaz, have cited games involving rape as an example of why video game content needs to be more strictly regulated.  RapeLay in particular had come to Vaz's attention in 2009, three years after its initial release, as being one of the rape games purchasable on Amazon.com, despite not being officially distributed nor supported outside of Japan, and he vowed to bring the issue into the British Parliament to prevent the game from being sold. Amazon subsequently removed the game from its website.  Equality Now followed up on the game, urging activists to write to Illusion and Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso in protest, arguing the game breaches Japan's obligations under the 1985 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.  In May 2009, these actions culminated in the restriction of the sale and production of RapeLay by the Ethics Organization of Computer Software (EOCS), an independent Japanese ratings organization for adult games, making the purchase of the game impossible.  Despite this the game is still available on many popular BitTorrent tracker sites.

There really is no comparison.  Also the term ""normies"" in itself is fairly dumb. The amount of time it takes to go from a ""normie"" to a member of the visual novel/anime community is less than a week. Liking VNs does not make you inherently different from regular people. We are not some special race capable of understanding these crazy Japanese works that no one else can. We are simply people with more exposure to a slightly different culture. Nothing more, nothing less. Giving more exposure to the general public, while sometimes causing controversy, overwhelmingly has a positive net effect."

Would have never expected that.   As for Ef. The only thing I want to note is I watched the anime version first. I liked how some of them were portrayed in it a bit more than the visual novel. However my favorite characters from the VN (Kuze and Mizuki) ironically I didn't care for them when I watched the anime. So I mainly suggest reading the latter tale before watching the anime if possible. I'm sure some people prefer the anime for other reasons though.

visualnovels,3aiohz,MasterXionic,3,Sat Jun 20 15:59:42 2015 UTC,"The final boss was undoubtedly the hardest fight for me. I played it at normal difficulty at first and after losing about 5 times, I changed the difficulty to very easy and it still took at least 2 more tries to beat it."

visualnovels,3aiohz,Wahfuu,3,Sat Jun 20 19:11:57 2015 UTC,Weekly Question: What is one thing that Baldr Sky does absolutely right?
visualnovels,3aiohz,Wahfuu,5,Sat Jun 20 16:00:14 2015 UTC,"Pretty much storytelling in general. The game is very intelligently made and it's very very obvious if you go back and play it after beating it for the first time. It never feels overwhelming or excessively talky due to the breakneck pacing and the fun gameplay, but the story is absolutely immense without ever breaking into infodumps. It helps that so much of the game is told through it's gameplay."
visualnovels,3aiohz,mdzjdz,5,Sat Jun 20 19:11:13 2015 UTC,"Integrating the gameplay with the storyline. When it comes to reading most visual novels, no matter how good the story, I get fatigued after 5-6 hours. But Baldr Sky's different -- that's a work that I could genuinely play for the entire day without getting bored at all (granted that this is the first playthrough).  Baldr Sky just does so much right. Its pacing is superb, and it never gets boring or repetitive. Granted the structure of the work, you'd expect that it'd feel repetitive (granted the 'loop' structure). But, for some reason, this never felt like it was the case. Further, the soundtrack (which probably played through its entirety several times over) always felt fitting, and never repetitive. Baldr Sky's a weird type of additive meth in this regard.   It also doesn't have a lot of blatant weaknesses. Not many works can boast to have a multi-faceted story (which is interesting not just from a purely storyline perspective, but in terms of commentary/the mechanics it discusses), while having a cast of well-developed, and affable characters.   So altogether, Baldr Sky does almost everything right."
visualnovels,3aiohz,hakimiru,3,Sat Jun 20 20:40:02 2015 UTC,"Didn't even think about it until I saw you mention loop structure and repetitiveness, but looking at the scenario chart there's barely anything in terms of a Common Route section. The story branches off super early, which probably plays a large role in keeping things fresh."
visualnovels,3aiohz,mdzjdz,3,Sat Jun 20 21:03:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah. But the thing is that there's a fairly well-established route structure (in that certain events will always happen, and the audience begins to anticipate this by the second route). Nonetheless, the wonder with Baldr Sky is that even with that, it feels fresh and unexpected."
visualnovels,3aiohz,hakimiru,3,Sat Jun 20 21:06:54 2015 UTC,"The same events happen, but the routes put you on different sides/viewpoints. So you end up experiencing it with a different group of people, who have different goals, and different approaches. Other than a few significant events which drive the flow of the story, I feel like they don't have much in common at all."

visualnovels,3aiohz,aldarionar_,3,Sat Jun 20 16:18:22 2015 UTC,Make sure to try and level up new weapons otherwise things might get hard later on.
visualnovels,3aiohz,hakimiru,3,Sun Jun 21 00:35:11 2015 UTC,"What weapons did you guys end up liking the most? And what's your highest combo damage?  I'm a huge fan of IAI - it looks cool, hits hard, and gives you a lot of vertical distance quickly for safety. Plus landing it diagonally with horizontal momentum looks amazing >w<  Second favorite is probably Kaiser Kick - I like speedy moves, and you get a lot of momentum/positioning options with it depending on when you cancel.  The most damage I've been able to eke out so far is about 8.8K (Dive X -dependent). I've seen something like 14K in videos, but I think that's a bit inflated (On max heat Tranquilizer + satellite beam shenanigans). Never did figure out how to make satellite beam work like that (please don't tell me, I still want to try it myself)."
visualnovels,3aiohz,aldarionar_,3,Sun Jun 21 02:07:01 2015 UTC,"Melee: Sliding Kick for easy combo starter, Arm shot+Kaiser kick for throwing enemy into the air, Metal harvester/Extend arm for doing good damage (with proper weapon combination) in air while locking enemy down, E-Finger for most charge damage. You can watch some combo videos on Youtube to find skills that chain each other and put them on your own combos.  Ranged: I didn't use ranged much because they're hard to fit in melee combos and they do less damage than melee for most of the time, and they take too much heat. You can do some silly things with Satellite laser though. I used Missile Ride and Anti-air spread bomb for the most part. Former is a great escape tool and its a good spam when enemy is too far away and it's annoying to go near it. Latter is for disabling annoying enemies that run into you so you can focus on your main target. Damage is not bad too.  For Force Crashers, I like Diving kick most because you can use it in air easily with %100 hit chance (there are fair amount of FCs you can miss), its quick, deals more damage than most FCs (obviously charge FC's with max heat bar doesn't count) and most importantly you can cancel it easily to control your landing. (You're going to take huge amount of damage when you land down with red heat bar if any enemy is alive) As second FC you can use Initializer but most of the time you can kill problematic big enemies with full combo+FC so it doesn't get any use except long combos in tutorial and boss fights. I find it better to have some FC that deals AOE damage to deal when you're outnumbered heavily. I used Shining Drill as second FC, it does great damage as 2nd FC (Very stylish when combined with Satellite laser) and good aoe on ground when huge number of enemies clumped.  My highest damage is 10k for Dive2 (probably some Aoe), 16k for DiveX. (with Muramasa on tutorial, using infinite combo)  PS: IAI is best skill to start combo to get highest damage from other weapons, but it's almost impossible to start with it for the most of the time. In DiveX you get Attractor Edge which hooks you to the enemy which combos into IAI easily, it doesn't reduce much compared to other starters. I recommend giving it a try if you haven't."
visualnovels,3aiohz,hakimiru,3,Sun Jun 21 03:58:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting that you'd start with Sliding Kick, I think I've only ever used it mid-combo. It doesn't track, right? Is it for the speed? I mostly used Impact Rod for that role, since it has homing properties. I've seen videos, but I don't really like to steal any tech that I wouldn't have come up with myself. The system is so fluid and everyone thinks differently, so I have more fun doing things on my on and comparing with friends. IAI->E.Finger has long been a favorite, but I don't think I've ever liked Harvester/Extend Arm much. I had a hard time keeping them juggled w/ Harvester in my limited experimentation. Does the damage add up significantly if you can keep them in it long enough? Or is it mostly for heat generation?  That's what I was talking about for Satellite (教えないでと言ったのに ;^; それを見ただけで分かったような気がする・・・). I didn't use ranged much either - mostly just air Slash Bazooka for height adjustments and Magnetic Field ender as a fake infinite. Missile Ride I never learned to control well, since it accelerates so fast. I didn't find much use for an AOE FC w/ my playstyle, so it was mostly Initializer + random. I took targets to the air as soon as possible so interruptions weren't an issue, and doing the ground bounce->Magnetic Field fake infinite also sucked in surrounding enemies for the next air combo. I'll have to give Shining Drill and the other heat-consuming moves another try. I didn't play around with them much, since I used E.Finger a lot >w>  Infinites don't count =w= 1v1, no items, Final Destination  Oh, does IAI have good startup proration? I'll have to give it another go. Sway Knife is another one with good proration I think, and what I've been using for my damage forays (either 1 or >1, I forget which).  Speaking of FC, there's something really satisfying about landing Goliath Hammer (especially if you shout ""光になれぇぇぇぇ!"" while doing it from the air <- important because you get more yelling time). Wish there was a height-based damage bonus on it or something."
visualnovels,3aiohz,aldarionar_,3,Sun Jun 21 04:50:46 2015 UTC,"Interesting that you'd start with Sliding Kick, I think I've only ever used it mid-combo. It doesn't track, right? Is it for the speed? I mostly used Impact Rod for that role, since it has homing properties.   Yeah, it's for speed. It has good slide distance, but it's uncancelable, has long recover time if you don't hit anything and since it has knockdown you need to use low kick right after it to keep the combo going. Impact Rod is actually better as starter since it has higher base damage and doesn't knock down (which reduces the combo damage even if you manage to keep going) but it's just too goddamn slow for my tastes.    I don't think I've ever liked Harvester/Extend Arm much. I had a hard time keeping them juggled w/ Harvester in my limited experimentation. Does the damage add up significantly if you can keep them in it long enough? Or is it mostly for heat generation?   Yeah, if you manage to use Harvester until the end it does huge amount of damage but sadly if enemy and you isn't in the right position you can stray and drop the combo. Extend Arm's damage is lower but it's very fun to use, too bad there's a good chance of enemy falling in the middle of it. But there is a way to use these 2 without losing much damage thanks to Arm Straight, Basically, after launching enemy into the air with Kaiser Kick and waiting a bit until enemy gets the good position (Something near to this is probably best, Kou's arm should hit lower-bottom of the enemy mech) you use arm straight AND Force Dash immediately to stabilize Kou's position in air. After Arm Straight use Harvester->Extend arm->Mine Knuckle->IAI->E-Finger.   I'll have to give Shining Drill and the other heat-consuming moves another try. I didn't play around with them much, since I used E.Finger a lot >w>   I use E-Finger too (It should be sin to not use E-finger tbh) and Shining Drill, since using FC reduces some of the heat used with E-Finger.    Oh, does IAI have good startup proration? I'll have to give it another go. Sway Knife is another one with good proration I think, and what I've been using for my damage forays (either 1 or >1, I forget which).   This is my -ideal- combo with Kou that starts with IAI and you can see how great its damage is. I just tried Sway Knife, it's pretty good but that lunge animation at start is so annoying and enemy moves away from my trajectory.   Speaking of FC, there's something really satisfying about landing Goliath Hammer (especially if you shout ""光になれぇぇぇぇ!"" while doing it from the air <- important because you get more yelling time). Wish there was a height-based damage bonus on it or something   流星脚 (Kou uses his feet like a drill and pushes enemy down while spinning it, it looks cool) does some crazy damage if you manage to carry your enemy high enough with Initilizer+Bundie Dagger at corner but it's very hard and not worth the effort. Yeah, I really like both Goliath hammer as FC and Crush hammer as normal finisher. They're very satisfying. If you want different mechanics, Climax finger FC in DiveX does more damage as much as you release it near the end."
visualnovels,3aiohz,hakimiru,3,Sun Jun 21 06:18:46 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. I actually went the other direction and replaced Impact with Tackle about midway through. It's just as slow and doesn't have the benefits of Impact's homing, but travels a fair distance and goes through attacks, making it a great counter move. It definitely has limitations though (such as being near useless in the Dominion's Miko fight).  Thanks for the info on Harvester (and the great pic!). I'll have to give it another go with those tips. I wasn't able to get it to work reliably on my own, and eventually just dropped it from my consideration list. I made a concept combo with 流星脚 once, and the damage was pretty decent. I can imagine it being amazing with Bundie Dagger climbing, although I didn't use it since I haven't developed that tech yet. I think my main problem with it was that it's only usable once a combo, since you lose all of your height in the process.  Climax Finger FC is my secret love, and actually the main source of damage in my Dive X combo (all of 3.4K). The max charge timing is pretty reliable once you get used to it, although missing just a single tick drops your damage by about 1.2K. It's not particularly efficient, but doing something like Magnum Upper->鎖鎌->Climax Finger looks amazing >w<  I think they did a great job with a lot of the new Dive X FC's. Climax Finger goes without saying of course, and 死閃 looks super cool. Have you had a chance to try anything with Mad Angler? I completely missed experimenting with it - think I'll go do some now."
visualnovels,3aiohz,aldarionar_,3,Sun Jun 21 07:26:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you use 流星脚 as a finisher+some FC that chains after it ends. But honestly I find it really hard to fit in anywhere except training.  I just tried Magnum Upper combo and it is indeed looks cool, although I find it really hard to use Climax Finger after 鎖鎌, maybe its because what i used to put enemy higher or because I play at 2x speed.  Mad Angler has the same problem with 流星脚, you need to get higher to get good numbers (although Mad angler requires lower height to be effective) and on top of height you need to find something to lock enemy in the air before using Mad Angler to prevent enemy from falling during its casting animation which ends up hurting damage a lot if you don't. I recommend playing around Mine Knuckle and Bundie Dagger again if you want to make it work. When used in the air Mine Knuckle's explosion can keep the enemy in the air, although you need use it in between skills or before E-finger to keep enemy in the air until mines detonate. Bundie Dagger for obvious climbing."
visualnovels,3aiohz,hakimiru,3,Sun Jun 21 15:35:30 2015 UTC,"You can continue after 流星脚 with Galactic Strike just before you land for more options (it's pretty much a universal pickup), but the whole thing isn't very practical. I think I used it in a MM-shaped combo I did once for fun, and that was about it.  The enemy needs to be higher for Climax Finger to hit, IIRC. The combo I have saved uses Cage Blade as a launcher, before landing a high Magnum->鎖鎌->FC. I didn't even know 2x speed was an option >w> Although I guess it's fine, since I have enough trouble landing some of the stranger move combinations as it is.  Played around with Bundie Dagger like you suggested, and I know how to climb with it now >w< It was simpler than I expected, but my experimentation with it was minimal thanks to E-Finger always taking the spot. This is super useful - I should probably revisit heat moves and see what else I've missed.  I'm...still working on Harvester orz.Edit: Oh, I get it now! Your explanation was perfect. It's surprisingly easy once you know how it works... never would have thought to use Dash like that. Time to see what else I can apply that too *skips off*  I don't like Mine Knuckle much, personally. Does it do anything special beyond the obvious air-holding? Gravity Field gives you perfect positioning into Mad Angler for free, and IAI or air 地雷 also work.  Edit 2: Is there a way to accurately tell your height? Trying to figure out if Magnum->Bundie or Kaiser->Bundie gives you a faster climb (Kaiser looks slightly faster, I think). Also just noticed that launch->Photon Lancer->Kaiser works, which is pretty cool.  Edit 3: Ok, Photon Lancer launch setups look amazing. I know what I'm playing with for the rest of the day >w>"
visualnovels,3aiohz,aldarionar_,3,Sun Jun 21 19:41:32 2015 UTC,"Nope, I've been playing around with Gravity Field like you said and it's actually better, I didn't even know that a skill like that exists even though Muramasa has the same thing under different name. Lancer+Kaiser is really cool startup, I use Extend Arm and Flamethrower to keep enemy in the air afterwards. Flamethrower is especially good to use it in the air once you remove the heat limit with Initializer.  By the way if you want a short combo try DD missile+IAI+地雷. (You can use first 2 to start combo too) It does 1,1k damage and doesn't make you heat up. Make sure to put DD missile to Search Dash slot so you can press Z+V to dash and blow him up immediately."
visualnovels,3aiohz,hakimiru,3,Sun Jun 21 23:09:26 2015 UTC,"With the new Bundie tech, I managed to get to 9K without using Climax Finger, and I wasn't even building for damage (Raging Claw starter). Flying across the screen with Bundie is so fun lol. Kou looks like he's swimming up a river or something.  Are there any tricks to making Flamethrower juggling more reliable? It seems like I need to keep moving after them for them to stay on, and if I accidentally move too much off axis they drop.  That's a lot of damage for just 3 moves... Looks like DD missile has something like +15% bonus proration on startup? IAI does more damage after using it first than straight, and Body Blow, which I usually test with goes 100->116. Interesting stuff, I've only ever used it mid-combo. You can add Slash Bazooka->(dash)Harvester to the end to make it go up to 1.9k and still stay under heat, which is pretty amazing."
visualnovels,3aiohz,aldarionar_,3,Mon Jun 22 04:01:02 2015 UTC,"Are there any tricks to making Flamethrower juggling more reliable?    I use Raging Claw before that to get enemy in to right axis. Using it way too much with Initilizer might be dangerous though.  DD Missile has 400 base damage whereas IAI has 362. Bigger base damage increases rest of the combo. This is what I get with full DD->IAI combo without FCs. After using missile, wait a little bit until its second animation is over before using IAI to get full damage from it and extend Harvester as much as you can.  Edit: I just added FCs too and oh man..."

I actually hope 07th Expansion is not one of them, but that they will announce 3 actually new partners and that they are renewing all their 07th Expansion stuff.  Edit: Now that I actually read the article they are almost definitely announcing renewed licenses since they are going to be selling physical copies of all of 07th Expansion's stuff there.

visualnovels,3afwn7,LeafCascade,2,Fri Jun 19 21:01:31 2015 UTC,"I got tired of waiting for a translation, so I just bit the bullet and bought Dive1 and 2. I'm enjoying it despite playing it through machine translation. If MangaGamer does get it, I will definitely be buying it. It's bothered me that for all these years GIGA has never had an official English partner. I mean for a long time TGL had a Taiwanese brand localizing TGL and GIGA titles in Taiwan, so I think it's only fair that English speakers get the same treatment. I'd personally like to see someone fan translate their 90s era games like Briganty or Harlem Blade, but considering their age it's doubtful, although the first 6 games in TGL's Farland Story series did get translated. /rant"

visualnovels,3afcvk,The_Bunny_Advocate,5,Fri Jun 19 20:43:14 2015 UTC,"Here's an inspiring story for you.  When I've been around ten I decided to try my hand at cooking the omelette (the usual one). I asked my grandmother for a recipe since she cooked the most delicious omelettes, but she made a horrible mistake, and instead of 1 soon of flour per egg she said 1 cup of flour per egg. As a result, what I created was a brick. Worse yet, my parents made me eat it. Perhaps they thought it was funny. Anyway, I was so scarred by that experience that the next time I used 1 tea spoon of flour per egg, which resulted in a some slightly different version of scrambled eggs. Fortunately, it was as edible as the usual one. Since then I can make normal omelettes.  Moral of the story: cooking gets better with experience. If you're making something conventional, sooner or later you'll get it right, so don't be afraid to try."
visualnovels,3afcvk,Ewig_Custos,5,Fri Jun 19 20:28:27 2015 UTC,omelette. the usual one. flour.   Huh. Never in my life have I heard of omelettes with flour in them.  Sounds kind of like a frittata. Any chance you have the recipe?
visualnovels,3afcvk,aspiration,3,Fri Jun 19 20:46:31 2015 UTC,"Well, a live example of differences in cuisine, huh.   It goes something like this: take chicken eggs (for one person I usually use two), beat them up with a blender/mixer. Add half a cup of milk per egg, a pinch of salt and a tea spoon of sugar. Milk should be of room temperature. Stir it with a blender. Add flour, about a table spoon per egg. What's the most important is the balance between milk and flour, it's pretty hard to get it perfectly, since it depends both on the quality of milk and flour. If simplified, if on following tries you want to make the flavour more delicate, you either add less flour or more milk (usually more milk), if it's not solid enough, you either add less milk or more flour (usually more flour). Stir it again. Take a pan that is not flat, the pan should have a such a diameter that when you pour the dish it should be of ~1cm height - in short, it should not be of a height of a crepe and should not take the whole height of the pan). Add oil to the pan and heat it up. Stir the mix with a spoon and pour it into the pan. Close the lid. Wait for a few minutes, then turn the omelette over with a spatula (dual-wielding two spatulas actually makes this easier!) once the bottom part is cooked (brownish tinge, very dark brown or black = it's overcooked or burnt respectively). It can break when you turn it over, it's unfortunate, but does not affect the taste. Switch to a low heat or turn off the heat entirely, it should be ready in a couple of minutes. Not broken one usually rises up a lid like a mutant, that's okay, it'll shrink once you open the lid. Voila! It can be served, you can eat it with sour cream, honey, jam or whatever. Heard some people eat it with mayo, but I personally don't like it. For ADVANCED mode add stuff like cheese, cut sausages, vegetables or mushrooms when you pour the (yet) liquid omelette in the pan, they all are pretty great additions.  Speaking of cuisine, not trying pelmeny is a crime against humanity."
visualnovels,3afcvk,Ewig_Custos,3,Fri Jun 19 21:26:00 2015 UTC,"Aww, that's awful that you had to eat it. That's normally what puts me off being too experimental, as it's too late and I'm too hungry to make something else by the time I've finished. So I'm forced to eat it regardless of how it turns out, good or bad, with a strong probability of the latter ..."

visualnovels,3afcvk,The_Bunny_Advocate,2,Fri Jun 19 23:13:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you want the eggs to set in a big mass, low heat is the way to go (the proteins set more evenly on a low&slow setting, great for custards (creme brule and flan anyone?), but bad for stir-fry). Same for doing perfect scrambled eggs, you stir and stir and stir, and literally take the pot/pan off the fire while stirring, put it back on, then off, until it gets the consistency you want (google gordan ramsey scrambled eggs on youtube for that style).  On the flip side, if you want to make a proper french omlette that folds, you have to get the pan SCARY hot (like, a drop of water will literally DANCE on the pan surface from the leidenfrost effect, it's ridiculously hot)  because you want to set the instant it touches the hot oil, and has 0 chance to stick to the pan.  fried rice is somewhere between these two extremes =)"

No point in making bland rice balls (without a filling) either. It's a waste of time, since it's (surprise!) just rice.

visualnovels,3afcvk,FinalNwo,2,Fri Jun 19 20:04:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I just don't like dense harem protagonists that don't even realize they have a harem.  My personal favorite is Issei from DxD, because he wants the harem, tries to keep it (when he actually realizes it), and from what I heard. Also, he has many quotable moments."

I don't know if you can really call her a tsundere. She has two different ""modes"" based on which ribbons she wears. When she's wearing her red ones she's in commander mode (I wouldn't call it tsundere really) and when she wears her white ones she's in heart-stoppingly cute imouto mode. I'm pretty sure she's the reason I love imouto characters so much since DaL was one of the first anime I watched after EL."

The combat is actually pretty fun (I got a soft spot for turn based fighting that actually lets you move your characters in the battle scene), the characters and story are pretty alright, and the dialogue is pretty fun to read. It also has a customizeable magic system so you can pick what spells you wanna give to each character, although only to a certain extent since most characters have one or two spots that have to have a specific element in it. Also if you wanna 100% it you're gonna want to read a guide right from the beginning since you'll get locked out of doing some stuff if you don't do it a specific time."

visualnovels,3afcvk,ctom42,3,Fri Jun 19 23:15:41 2015 UTC,"Does anyone here play tabletop RPGs like D&D and such? Right now I'm involved in three different campaigns using three different systems.  The most normal ones is a Pathfinder campaign that has a fantastic GM who is great at making up the most random and awesome shit on the spot. In our next session I am going to be soloing a Colossal ""Magic Giant"" that is a boss enemy while the rest of the party literally watches in armchairs while eating popcorn, all because I accepted the boss's challenge to single combat.  I'm currently GMing a campaign using the Fate system. For those unfamiliar with Fate it is a fairly streamlined and barebones system without any of it's own lore, world, enemies, etc. The game I'm running is using the Nen power system from Hunter X Hunter and so far it's been a lot of fun.  The wackiest one by far is one that is just starting up (we had our first session wednesday), which is a game of Maid the RPG. It's basically just a massive parody of Maid tropes and is fantastic. Our characters were created by rolling off tables in the rulebook and I ended up with a blue haired catgirl demon maid with a scythe. The game is even more streamlined than Fate and is extremely Role playing heavy. Also there is a massive random events table to determine all kinds of wacky shit we have to deal with (which our GM modified to his liking). Within minutes of starting we already had hilarious interactions between several of our eccentric Maids. Through sheer luck 5/6 of us ended up with some form of magical powers. Also in addition to me being a catgirl one Maid had cat-speech (nyas and meows in her sentences), another had cat ears, and another had a cat familiar (they were a mage maid). It was fantastic chaotic fun."

I would GM myself but to be honest I would much rather play the a campaign with my friends.

Or at least, the qualities that we'd expect would be important for a GM since we haven't really done this sort of thing before.  Even he admits that it would probably be a bit of a mess, regardless of how much he wants to do it.  So, when I recently stumbled across and told him about Roll for Shoes, he thought that looked perfect so we finally gave it a try.  It didn't last very long.

visualnovels,3afcvk,Marche100,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:13:20 2015 UTC,"Yep. This past October (I think) I got my first taste of tabletop games with DnD 5th edition. Played with some friends over Google Hangouts/Roll20.  The first GM we had was really great. Really nice guy who emphasized being fair to the players (letting us be in charge of our own fates rather than railroading us, not purposefully trying to kill us, etc). He was really good at improvising, especially when we went off course. Unfortunately, he had to take a break.  Second campaign I took part in was GM'd by a player from the above campaign. He was totally new to being a GM, but he was pretty good. He was really invested in the world and adventures he had created/planned out and was also a fair GM. Unfortunately, just the other day I found out that he, too, will have to take a break for a little while.  But yeah, it's been really fun. Got some crazy stories out of it. One of my favorites was when we were fighting a bunch of redcaps and they all kept missing. Some even tripped over themselves and fell onto their own weapons. But then there a single redcap that kept hitting me without fail, and I kept missing my swings at it without fail. I couldn't stop laughing throughout that entire fight.  I'm going to miss playing with those GMs/players. Hopefully we can get together again in the future and pick up where we left off."

I picked up D4 and both of the Castlevania: Lords of Shadows (as well as Mirror of Fate HD).   D4 was fantastic. Fun, quirky characters, some solid core mysteries, and enjoyable gameplay made for a great experience. But best of all, it didn't crash and have a low framerate like Deadly Premonition did. I'm really glad that Swery is getting an opportunity to make a second season. D4 ended on a huge cliffhanger, and it certainly deserves to get however many seasons it needs to see its story through.  As for the Castlevanias, I played through most of the 2D ones last year (most notably Symphony of the Night and the GBA ones) and was looking for an opportunity to pick up the Lords of Shadow games, as they're the only 3D ones I was really interested in. Somehow I didn't realize that they had PC ports, because I only found that out at the start of this Steam sale. So I picked them up when they went daily. First one seems pretty good so far. Reminds me of God of War, but with some quality-of-life features GOW doesn't have. Excited to play through all of these."
visualnovels,3afcvk,JamesVagabond,2,Sat Jun 20 16:59:04 2015 UTC,"All right, let's see.   Door Kickers. I haven't played it that much yet, but it looks like a fairly interesting tactics game. You have a SWAT squad under your command (with customizable roles and gear for each member), it gets sent on missions and you have to outline a plan for them. Interestingly, you can try to create a detailed plan which would result in victory after being carried out, assuming everything went right (or at least not as bad as it could), or you can just give a bunch of simple orders just for the beginning of the operation and after that continue adding small batches of commands or even give them in real-time. Cinders. A VN I was interested in. Not sure when I'll get to it, though, because other stuff I got during the sale for now has higher priority. Grim Fandango Remastered. A gift from a friend who decided that I was ignoring Grim Fandango for far too long.  Nidhogg. Brilliant mechanics, shoddy singleplayer. I played the game for ~45 minutes and I'm probably not going to touch it after that (I have to admit, it's kind of tempting to ask for a refund here, but that'd be quite a dickish move; after all, the game certainly has its merits, although I'd definitely advise against grabbing it without a solid discount). Haven't touched multiplayer, not really interested in it, although it is probably nice enough. A whole bunch of Europa Universalis IV DLC. TIS-100. A puzzle from Spacechem/Infinifactory developer. Haven't played it yet, but I have a good feeling about it. XCOM: Enemy Within. Heard good things about this expansion, I have high hopes for it. L.A. Noire. Not sure what to expect here, we'll see. Remember Me. Same as above. LISA. Now this was a surprise. Pretty much a hidden gem. I wonder why people don't talk about it more. A great take on post-apocalyptic setting with lots of bizarre stuff going on. It's a side-scrolling RPG in terms of gameplay, but the gameplay is not the highlight. Everything else is, though.  Styx: Master of Shadows. Pretty close to finishing it. It's a stealth game and it works fine. Far from being a great game, far from being a complete wreck. Setting and plot are slightly curious, but that's about it. Being a fan of the genre, I'm satisfied with the game, although you probably won't see me heartily recommending it to anyone."

I think I am in the 'middle' of chapter three, but since I have no clue where you are I'll leave the story alone. Though the translation is a bit questionable sometimes like they prefer the English over the more localized English. I play with the Japanese voices. It makes the character 1000x more cute  As a quick note: Are you playing with the DLC-Characters? Because they were like 30 cents or something. I found Plutia to be lovely and Peachy is cute...but she's a loli and I have mixed feelings about that especially when she wearing the swimsuit outfit The HDD version of them are 'well rounded' I'd say."

It's turned out to be an immensely more time consuming than either the best girl or guy contests due to the difficulty in finding/creating suitable images. I had a script that auto downloaded almost all the character portraits from those contests, but with this we need to go a manual search for every pic.   The nomination voting post should go up in the next day or two."

The show has definitely shifted away from its previous focus on Piper, but it's just as good, if not better, than the first two seasons. Also, fuck red velvet.  Also finally got around to actually watching Nightcrawler (I tried with a friend a while back but we got distracted..) and it was fantastic. Jake Gyllenhaal is still one of my favorite actors.  Besides that, I'm in season 2 of Gilmore Girls and slowly watching Samurai Champloo."

Other than that I've begun rewatching Scrubs again. Without a doubt my favourite comedy TV show. I still laugh as hard as I did the first time I watched it all."

I can name a 1000 things I love about this season and show but I digress.    The show has definitely shifted away from its previous focus on Piper   I'd say that this is a good thing as she may just be one of the most uninteresting characters on the show.

visualnovels,3aez8r,drakeparker_d3p,8,Fri Jun 19 16:12:09 2015 UTC,I think we should open it up even further to a best Visual Novel Vocal Song Contest and best Visual Novel BGM Contest.

visualnovels,3aez8r,dont_come_any_closer,3,Fri Jun 19 16:37:08 2015 UTC,minori take their OPs very seriously. What company would hire Shinkai Makoto just to direct the OP of a VN?
visualnovels,3aez8r,LeafCascade,4,Fri Jun 19 17:13:01 2015 UTC,"Sounds like fun! The only issue I can think of is that many OPs are riddled with spoilers, interestingly enough. Especially many games that have multiple openings for different parts of the game. It's something one should take into consideration at least."
visualnovels,3aez8r,hyperknees91,4,Fri Jun 19 17:08:15 2015 UTC,"If people were to pick based on animation openings The heavens feel opening that spoils the whole route. The minori openings are prettier and cleaner in animation, but this one is just too cool. But japan doesn't really care about spoilers in their openings, it's just how they market their games half the time.   If it was based on the actual song in the opening, I doubt anything would beat Muv Luv Alternatives. Game is already raging popular and the song is hype the song.   But yeah if spoilers bother you then I would just advise to skip every single visual novel opening song ever (seriously just watch Rewrites opening song) and then come back and watch it once your done with the game. I imagine they are done the way they are so they can draw some appeal to people who otherwise might not be interested in the game."
visualnovels,3aez8r,Fuwante0,7,Fri Jun 19 17:45:28 2015 UTC,It's something that Deardrops has a shot of winning at so I'm all for it. It might also lead to people discovering titles that they would have missed otherwise since OPs are a really great way showing what a VN's about (most of the time).

In the interest of not supporting a pretty shitty VN here is how you can torture your friends for $4.  You'll want to start by acquiring a strong jute twine from home depot. 190 feet should be ample to restrain a great deal of your friends. Twine isn't very strong so double-down, you silly goose! You've got plenty.  A 32 oz bottle of Arrowhead water at my local CVS runs for about $2. Suspending it over your victim's forehead with the rope should only require about 15 feet of jute.   From there you can register a credit card with Hulu and cancel before your free month is over to avoid any expense. I recommend Hulu over Netflix to force your victim to suffer through really shitty ads.   Hulu has a wonderful selection of shitty anime! Perhaps scoff at the mainstream and force them to marathon Attack on Titan? Go for the obvious low-hanging fruit and force them to watch fruits basket or mirai nikki? Is your victim /u/ctom42? You'll be pleased to hear the entirety of Neon Genesis Evangelion is on Hulu.

visualnovels,3ade5a,Jazz957,3,Fri Jun 19 15:23:36 2015 UTC,"I finished Sakura Spirit in a night. It's a very short story with only two possible endings. The character development is terrible - the protagonist is still the same person at the end, and the plot is very cliche. It's not exactly rated M - there's no nudity, and there's no sex or innuendo implied."

visualnovels,3ade5a,Cornetto_Man,-1,Fri Jun 19 05:51:15 2015 UTC,This game includes nudity... WTF? I thought stream were completed prudes when it came to nudity and sexual content on steam. I would love to play this.

I'll give her and Meiya both 10/10 but I doubt she will be close to as popular as Meiya since she's so polarizing. I think/hope Meiya has a fair shot of breaking 9/10 but I'm not sure if she'll quite make it, especially since she's not very good until Unlimited and Alternative."

visualnovels,3a7aiu,aspiration,10,Wed Jun 17 20:02:10 2015 UTC,"I finished Shikoku no Sharnoth, so here’s the write-up (and fashion rankings).  The Good:   The characters. While some didn’t get enough screen time to really leave an impression, most of them were very entertaining and memorable. This was definitely an improvement over Sekien no Inganock’s colorful, yet easily forgettable, supporting cast. The setting. While not as fantastic of a place as Inganock, Sakurai’s Victorian-era London was quite beautiful. Combined with the art and the characters, it was still every bit as atmospheric as Inganock. Moran. No. Yes. She is hands down my favorite female character in a long time. The opening. Dorchadas is amazing and the visuals are great as well (except for the minigame segments which trigger me).   The Bad:   The minigame. I’d rather play YU-NO without a guide than go through another second of that torture. The repetition. While it’s part of the reason I love Sakurai’s writing, I feel like she used it a bit too often this time around. I hope she reigns it back in a bit in Gahkthun. M. What a boring character. “I’m so moody and yet apathetic at the same time. I also love the color black, it just gets me.” ring, ring Sakurai, your inner 16 year-old goth girl is calling, she wants her dream man back. Like Inganock, there are still quite a few questions left unanswered.   Overall, it was a solid 8.5/10 for me. The good outweighed the bad, especially if you just turn the minigame off at the beginning. You can tell that Sakurai is still coming into her own as a writer, but she’s definitely improving, even if I don’t think Sharnoth was as good as Inganock overall. My love for her is still strong and I’m even more excited for the release of Gahkthun than I was before.  Extra little notes I kept."
visualnovels,3a7aiu,aspiration,12,Wed Jun 17 20:14:52 2015 UTC,"Fashion Rankings Super Deluxe Edition  Note: Since Victorian Era has awesome stuff, the C rating for this ranking is equivalent to an A for others.    Miss Hudson - B-. Her sea foam green dress is cute, if a bit plain, but the shawl and matching shoes really pull the whole outfit together.  Claudia Acland - C+. Her two piece dress is fairly plain, but the stripes down the side of the skirt compliments the shirt and jacket fairly well. The rose motif is just enough to give her a plus.  Angelica Derleth - B. The pink color of Angie's dress gives off a sense of liveliness among the sea of dull and muted color schemes. It plays very well with her energetic, if a bit childish, personality  Henry Irving - A-. Henry's slim choice in wardrobe compliments her limited curves nicely. The darker colors in the outfit match the pitch black hair.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle - E. In a setting filled with vibrant and interesting outfits, he still manages to look like an underpaid TA.  Bell Webb - D-. Most of the outfit is good, but the white bib-thing is just atrocious, and it also makes her look very young as well  Bram Stoker - B+. The classic black suit combo would work well with his aged appearance to begin with, but the bright red of the two-toned cape really gives him the need flair to stand apart from the rank and file.  Charlotte Bronte - D+. I'm not a particular fan of the dress and the sleeves are a bit too puffy, but like Angie, the yellow color is a much appreciated break from the dark monotony.  Donna Wirgman - B. Donna pulls of the Victorian maid look exceptionally well. Her conservative black heels round out the outfit nicely.  Ed O'Neal - C. He pulls of the clean-cut soldier look well.  Elly Beinhorn - C-. Her dress is pretty plain and I'm not a fan of the flower buttons, they're simply tacky.  George Lestrade - D. His plain suit outfit is very plain, and quite frankly, boring.  Heinz Heger - B+. The charcoal on black color scheme works out quite well for Heinz, especially since in sharply contrasts his Germanic features.  Jane Doe - B. The green and black color scheme works well for Jane. I also like how her (oddly frilly) shirt pokes out from beneath the jacket.  Josef Chapek - D-. A boring suit for a boring man.  Mary Clarissa Christie - A. Mary's dress is very cute and the dark violet/white coloration is on point for her and her pale skin. When combined with her boots and black bow accents, it makes for a really great outfit.  Robin Funnel - A-. There is something so right about a coroner wearing a mourning dress. The veil just adds to the sense of mystery surrounding this odd woman.  Howard Phillips - C. Honestly, Howard is pretty much the definition of average. His suit fits well and it's a nice break from the all black of most of the male cast.  Sherlock Holmes - D+. I'm not really sure what's going on here, but it's not the worst thing in this VN.  M - D. Yes, yes. All black. We get it. Very mysterious.  Sebastian Moran - S. Never in my life has a military uniform looked so sexy. Her outfit is just another check on the list of things that are perfect about Moran.  Baron Munchhausen - A. It's a bit out of the time period, but still, he's got flair.  Keynes & Henri - B. Keynes has the ragged street-urchin look going for himself while Henri is just straight up adorable. 10/10, would adopt and lose my sanity raising.  Viola Baskerville - B-. While I'm not the biggest fan of her character design, her dress is quite nice. It's a bit frilly and I'm not sure on the fingerless gloves, but the light purple color is great and the hat is baller.  Winston Churchill - A. A typical dark suit, but the sharp fit, the maroon ascot, the hat, and the cane all combine to form a solid outfit that matches the character perfectly.  Zach Murray - B. Buff street reporter looks the part, not much else to say. He wears a green suit well, as it matches his brown hair and darker complexion.    Yeah, I ended up finding the neat portraits for each character, so this was a lot more comprehensive of a list than I thought it would be. I excluded some characters for spoiler reasons and also because they didn't really bring anything to the table anyways.  Bonus Moran: 1 2 3 4 5"

Churchill was the would-be Byronic hero of Sharnoth.  And as far as M's past goes, it's definitely interesting, but it doesn't make him any less of a boring character for me. I really think he needed at least a brief arc to help the reader get invested in him as a character. It also really didn't help that he was probably the only non-minor character who didn't have a PoV.   Such as? Did you read the web novel?   It's the same problem Inganock had, there's just a lot of loose ends (usually unimportant) that tend to go unanswered.

visualnovels,3a7aiu,BookofAeons,8,Tue Jun 23 15:32:59 2015 UTC,"Little Busters!  /r/vndiscuss covered the first half of Kurugaya Yuiko’s route this week.  You can find my comments here.  School Days HQ  An uncommonly strong bout of depression this week had me looking for something unusual to break me out of it;  School Days is certainly unusual.  Like any good PC gamer, the first thing I did was look at the options menu.  “SOMCON Options?  What’s that?”  A quick Google search turned this up: NSFW.  0.o okay then…  The entire game is fully animated and fully voiced, feeling more like an anime than a typical VN.  It’s pretty impressive from a technical standpoint.  There were a few downsides, though.  With my ADHD, keeping up with a full-speed conversation is a mentally taxing challenge.  I was frequently having to pause and check the backlog, interrupting the flow of the story.  I also felt the characters were somewhat less expressive than a typical VN; animating entire faces costs more than just the lipflaps.  On the other hand, the perpetually gloomy expressions did add to the atmosphere, so this isn’t strictly a bad thing.  Story-wise, I’ve finished Kotonoha’s  ending, and made it to Sekai’s confession scene in a second playthrough.  So far it’s been a realistic high-school romance.  Almost too realistic, even;  I was getting painful flashbacks to my own time in high-school, when I treated every interaction with the opposite sex as a life-or-death struggle.  The characters certainly feel like real, inexperienced kids.  I found the characters very hard to like, but I didn’t particularly dislike most of them either.  Kotonoha had a very weak self-identity, and so was almost as passive as the MC, Makoto.  Sekai had a stronger personality, but it was hard to sympathize with her  sorrows.  I thought I had found a truly likable character in Makoto’s friend, Taisuke, but out of nowhere  Sigh.  At least Nanami, Sekai’s friend, seems to have her shit together.  There was some sweetness to be found in Kotonoha’s ending scene, but personally it wasn’t enough to counteract the grey malaise I felt throughout the rest of the story.  I am curious whether Makoto’s blood relations are ever hinted at in-game, but I think I’ll be dropping this one here.  It’s not impossible I’ll pick it up again someday, when I’m more in the mood to be sad.  I’m starting to think the 80 upvotes /u/_silentheartsong ‘s recommendation received on my introduction post might not have been entirely serious…:   For a pleasant, heartfelt love story, try Saya no Uta and School Days.   Princess Evangile  For a second attempt at feeling warm and fuzzy inside, I picked up Princess Evangile.  I’m halfway through Chapter 9 so far, and I’m adoring everything about it.  I went into it wanting to smile, and that smile hasn’t left my face since.  I was very impressed with the story’s central conflict.  Changing popular opinion is a difficult and interesting task, but at the same time doesn’t require a hateful antagonist or excessively tragic circumstances.  I was astonished the game was able to hold my attention so well without making me feel miserable.  Masaya is definitely in the top quartile of protagonists.  So far he’s been a minor Gary Stu, but at least he has a strong personality and clear goals.  I can forgive a lot when the character isn’t yet another blank slate.  Rise-san is the first heroine introduced and my favorite thus far.  She’s both aggressively secular and slightly naive, an unusual combination that I just can’t get enough of.  A woman after my own heart, really.  Chiho-san is next, and I still don’t have a good read on her.  Partially it’s because every time she talks it feels like /u/Cornetto_Man himself is flirting with me :-p  Hopefully I’ll see more of her inner thoughts soon.  I do love the scenes where she competes with Rise-san for Masaya’s affection, with Ruriko-san looking on with a knowing smile.  Ritsuko has her own strong, informed beliefs, but she’s still open-minded.  I can deeply respect that.  She’s reminding me quite a bit of Yumiko from The Fruit of Grisaia.  Considering how hard I fell for that coodere, this girl could prove quite troublesome.  Ayaka-sama didn’t present the same difficulty as Chiho-san, fortunately, as I haven’t interacted with /u/bigfatround0 as much.  I’m not usually a fan of the Onee-san, but Ayaka-sama has been refreshingly light so far.  I think I’m gonna like this character.    I don’t keep a formal list of funniest scenes ever, but this one was definitely top-five material: Spoilers"

You love it  Though yeah, I love seeing people enjoy PE. It's one of my favourite VNs so seeing others read it and like it too is great.   Masaya is an interesting protagonist. At first I wasn't a huge fan due to the gray stu qualities you mentioned. Whenever it comes up I call him a walking deus ex machina. Whenever there's a problem you can be sure Masaya has had a part time job that instilled him with the skills to overcome it. The moment I really started to like him was Common route After that I grew to like him more and more. His whole attitude is so amiable and fresh. I liked the   I'm looking forward to seeing your thoughts next week as you get into the routes themselves.

It's still visually impressive most of the time without spending the huge budget that completely animating the full game would cost.  And yeah, don't ever play this game looking for likeable characters. There are very few to be found.

It might be that it occurs later. Normally I would double check these things before responding, but you have been so cavalier about spoilers that I got careless. At the very least I am positive the fight I am talking about has been mentioned by this point, but it might not have been shown yet.

Besides the existence of some other characters that haven't shown yet characters, I have no idea of what to expect going into the rest of the fourth episode and Chiru except. I might be more lax on spoiling myself than most people, but even I'm determined to keep the end of the first half of Umineko and the second half (especially) under wraps. (I think I'm going to go through the rest of Ryukishi's works totally blind, though.)  So, no bother if you ended up referencing a fight that (possibly) didn't really show yet. It's nothing major, and I should have worded my original post better.

visualnovels,3a7aiu,insanityissexy,8,Thu Jun 18 04:29:36 2015 UTC,"After many months, I've finally finished No, Thank You!!!  This was my first ""Boys-Love"" VN and my first impressions were great. The protag, Haru, is delightfully upbeat and has a seemingly endless supply of hilarious observations and one-liners. Conveniently, he also has the same difficulty as me in remembering names, with a system of assigning nicknames that made total sense to me, so it made it easier for me to slip in and out of the VN without worrying about forgetting who someone was (especially helpful when it took me so many months to finish it).   The setting was a breath of fresh air, set in a bar and early spoiler. Finally, a VN that doesn't drown us in teenage angst or childhood struggles to determine a self-identity (although ironically the protag is suffering from amnesia). I hadn't realised how significantly this would change the entire tone of the VN. You aren't surrounded by helpless classmates who hang off your every word and need you to run their life, no, these guys are all adults. They make their own decisions, and they aren't going to fall apart if your relationship with them doesn't work out. It feel much more authentic with both partners being equal, rather than the twisted form of parental responsibility that some VNs try to portray as a healthy relationship where one partner needs to be ""fixed.""  The prose compliments Haru's whimsical nature, avoiding lengthy descriptions and maintaining a fast pace. Scenes never drag, rarely lasting more than a few minutes, and it gives the impression that this is going to be a fairly light-hearted tale. But beneath its surface charm lurks some very troubling content. Beyond some significant issues regarding how it handles sexual consent and the consequences (or more importantly, the lack of consequences), this novel contains non-specific spoiler   Subsequent play-throughs of NTY offer a completely different feel to the first. As well as unlocking additional scenes and perspectives from other characters (an utterly fantastic feature), just being aware of what's going on in the background gives the character interactions a distinctly different vibe. Each route (perhaps excluding Maki's) manages to compliment the others nicely, each one providing a few more jigsaw pieces on overlapping mysteries that are present throughout the VN. It's a little h-scene heavy though once you cut out the common route, combine that with the spoiler  One last thing, if you're averse to ever reading h-scenes then NTY probably isn't for you. A significant amount of character development is inter-meshed with these scenes so you'll miss a lot if you skip through it.  Overall, I really enjoyed NTY and am glad to have tried something so different to my usual fare.

Generally YMK has 3 routes, of which most people are told to only read one (""Bullying""). That route can be pretty evocative, but from a writing standpoint it's not all that special and they could have gone much further. The second route (""Drugs"") is very average. I found the heroine of that route to be kind of cute at the time, but looking back I'm not sure why. This route also failed to truly explore the depths of its subject matter. The third route (""Interpersonal"") is just garbage."

Its cast (both protagonist and heroines) is entertaining to read, and it has better-than-average pacing.   But, it doesn't seem to have a lot of content. The romances are sudden, and most of them don't make a lot of logical sense (in fact, some of them go against logic). Furthermore, the routes themselves felt like a continuation of the common route in that it was primarily still slice of life comedy (without any real meaningful development). The endings to the heroine routes were even worse, in that some of them felt random, or needless (e.g. some endings felt like the writer decided to end the game on a 'high' note on a random day, with no thematic or deeper purpose).   It's not that I expected a deep, dramatic story for Pure x Connect. It just felt more like a dating simulator (in that the characters, while really likable, never grew) than it did a meaningful visual novel.   I'm not sure what I'll read next. I think tentatively, I'll give Pulltop Air's title a try."

visualnovels,3a7aiu,Saibanchou,4,Fri Jun 19 10:18:35 2015 UTC,"Didn't have too much time to read much of anything but I did read a bit more of subahibi. One thing to note is that the ""it's my own inventions"" chapter (or the 3rd chapter) is really long, so don't expect to read through it in one sit down. That chapter alone is about as long as the entirety of Shikoku no Sharnoth in terms of number of lines. So if you feel like the chapter is really long it's because it is really long. Thankfully it's not boring or uninteresting by any means but if you are short on time, it's going to take some time to get through it.  What little time I had reading, I spent mostly on sanarara since subahibi isn't exactly the most relaxing vn to read. This is my first nekoneko soft vn I tried out and I was very impressed by what I read. The vn is structured so that there are 7 heroes and 7 heroines split into 7 different stories. So in each story, it features a different couple with their own stories. The only story I completed is Nozomi's route and while it was only about 3-4 hours long, because there is no harem of girls or the common route, the story gets started right away and gets to the point very fast. The result was an excellent story that is focused on personal growth of Nozomi without any distractions. The ending was a little strange but it was an excellent moving story from beginning to end and I am really looking forward to reading about all the other heroines. I am a bit dismayed that there isn't a translation patch for the game yet, because I think this is a hidden gem, but it looks like there is a group that is translating it so hopefully everyone will get to experience this nakige at some point."

I wasn't really planning on picking this one up, but I had a few hours to kill and it was $2.5, so I grabbed Long Live the Queen.    This may come as no surprise to anyone, but I found it to be extremely lackluster. I don't mind that it's a raising sim, and its skill tree isn't as complex as that of Romanesque (unnecessary mood system notwithstanding). The thing I disliked the most was the structure of the game -- there is almost no foreshadowing, and the only way to learn the game is to try things at random, save constantly, die and backtrack. This really wears itself out very quickly.    I didn't find Romanesque to be a masterpiece when I read it, but it's far superior to LLtQ in just about every way.    Unlike my typical habits, I did not complete the game to 100%. I finished it three times or so, and although I did not read every single scene, the way the story is written is such that I don't feel like I missed anything at all. It was seriously that weak."
visualnovels,3a7aiu,WellmadeIndochina,5,Thu Jun 18 10:25:10 2015 UTC,"So I finished Rose Gun Days. To cut to the chase I found it to be an exceptional read, 10/10.  It's impossible to not draw comparisons to Umineko, what with the two works being by the same author, and with Umineko being the only other VN I have rated a 10. As a pure entertainment narrative Rose Gun Days surpasses Umineko. It lacks the depth of substance that Umineko's mysteries and layered symbolism provide, and overall Umineko is still far and away my favorite, but RDG managed to beat it on the pure narrative level. Which makes sense because RDG wears everything on it's sleeve. There is nothing to dig deeper into like with Umineko, and even the very controversial topics it delves into are addressed in a straightforward manner. In that way it is almost the opposite of Umineko. RDG also features a fantastic and well fleshed out cast that rivals Umineko, and while it's OST is significantly less sizable, it still has some really standout pieces and a wide range of tracks.  Now for my actual thoughts on the sections I read since last week. The end of season 3/beginning of season 4 1949  I also really enjoyed the later parts of season 4 1950  I know some people were unsatisfied with 1950"

Oh the other hand, your theory seems solid, but I feel like you lack confidence in it.

I liked how even with someone like me who's pretty shit at thinking hard on stuff or creating theories (probably should have been taking notes, but I thought I would be able to trust my memory which I couldn't) it was still amazing to read. Although not understanding how stuff like the murders went down will just make another read through all the more fun.   EP 8  But anyways, I could probably talk about a lot of things but I'll just leave it at that.

visualnovels,3a7aiu,Winterspark,3,Thu Jun 18 05:37:23 2015 UTC,"I've been posting a lot recently about Muramasa. But today, I have finally finished all the routes, all the way into the True End.   So, congratulations to Nitro+ staffs, for creating such a masterpiece as Muramasa, and to me, for reading through the long hours of .  I won't write up a long 'review' post about it (edit: this got dragged out longer than expected ゜ロ゜;) , mainly because my brain has yet to completely digest the implications that rest inside the labyrinthine plot details, and also because majority of the redditters in an English-speaking community like here would be ill-spoiled from reading about a random poster's 'review' of a work that hasn't even been translated yet.  But, suffice it to say that empathizing with the characters that appear in this work was simultaneously the easiest and the most difficult part in reading Muramasa: partly because, as a bystander/reader, it's not easy to separate personal ideals with the realistic portrayal (or the effort to engender the world and event as such) of human nature in a fictional work. Even if you're slammed at the very beginning with the disclaimer that , repressing your subjective expectation (that it'll all turn out okay in the end/protagonist will triumph and antagonist defeated) isn't viable to do 24/7.   With that said, if a character that you like (and honestly I thought all characters that appeared in this work felt human, each with a degree of faultiness to their character that may be nagged at, resulting in the kindling of empathetic emotions) acts/suffers from a particular emotion or a plot element, then it'd be natural to enforce your own personal morality to decide who should be rightfully spared or punished.  ...And, reading Muramasa felt weird...because it didn't let me do that. Or, at the very least, it felt like it purposefully tried to go against the norm of 'this should happen because most of the people would agree that this is right'.   The central theme of 'right and wrong' and 'just punishment' didn't help to mitigate that uneasiness, either, the mentioning of these topics often making me self-consciousness and spurring me to doubt the legitimacy of my own mental judgments of 'it should/should not happen' on the 2-dimensional level and 'it should/should not befall on someone who has committed this kind of action' on the 3-dimensional level.  Anyhow, reading Muramasa was like observing and handling an alive organism rather than allowing a piece of intangible flow of sentences that are familiar to one's ear to pass through the head. The impression that the characters who appear in this work do not conform to the reader/society's normative standards and undeniably have their own desires and motives (and most of the characters prioritized the satisfaction of their own selfishness over the good of society in general) leads one to abhor or exalt this or that kind of action.   And yet, perhaps it's because the reader becomes blatantly aware of the fact that no one here is really good or evil, it becomes harder to really commit oneself to hate a character (though liking a certain character may differ from person to person). It's conspicuous that each character who has a hand in the plot serves a sense of justice that may be reflected as 'just' when looked from one side and 'unjust' when looked from the other.  And, in the end, it just made me give up and wonder, 'Does categorizing this and that character as 'good' or 'evil' serve any purpose? Aren't they all striving towards what they fervently believe to be 'right'? Shouldn't they all--or at least those who I believe are true to themselves and acting with corresponding honesty--be praised and be rewarded when they are trying that hard?'  Well, reality isn't at all like that. And Muramasa tells this with artistic exquisiteness. That there are 'winners' and 'losers' in the world. And the 'winner' may just as well be 'unjust' as the 'loser' may be 'just'.  Reading Muramasa, I think I learned a thing or two, that a person who believes in their sense of justice isn't wrong, and that a person whose justice clashes against that of another must concede that both of their justices are 'good' and 'evil' and each must be respected equally (though that doesn't mean that one should go easy against the other).   And reading Muramasa was a pleasant experience because the main character and many others were honest about accomplishing what must be done in order to reach their goal and possessed (or learns to possess) the perspicacity to understand that gaining something happens at the same time as forsaking something.  Soukou Akki Muramasa was a work of art that justifiably places in my Top 5 of VNs that I've read so far... and also, Sandaime is the Best Heroine ๑ơ ₃ ơ"

It really got me excited to read it, something I haven't experienced for a while. The humour is great and I love the mysterious depth every character has. I especially like Michiru at the moment. She's really funny but I suspect there's a lot of depth behind the joking facade and I look forward to seeing Yuuji get to know her. Yuuji. What a great protagonist. I can see why he won the Best Guy Award. His narration is really funny and he is very intriguing to read about, with his past. The only problem I have, if you could call it one, is the vocabulary at times. I don't know if it's the translator showing off or if it's a representation of Yuuji's slightly arrogant and snobby side but I feel I'm googling a word of reference every 5 minutes. It really breaks the immersion. One thing that really struck me as strange was a choice you get to do with Makina: Grisaia  Apart from that, it's amazing. Is there any recommended route order? I was thinking of going with Michiru first and then probably Yumiko, going with order of current preference. Is there any route that's best to save for last? I assume there's no true route.

Every character has an idividual voice, he makes up new puns for ones he can't translate but he doesn't go overboard with localisation. The fact that the vocabulary is big is great and adds to the richness of the language, it's more that it's my fault for needing to get a wider vocabulary.  I appreciate it in ways because the only way I'm going to expand my vocabulary is by being forced to look up words I've seen around but am not certain about.

visualnovels,3a7aiu,Bobemmo,2,Thu Jun 18 03:04:46 2015 UTC,"I have been reading Grisaia no Kajitsu for a while. Finished Amane's route and am 1 hour into Michiru's.  The common route was okay. Some scenes were excruciatingly boring while others were a great display of translation supremacy. But it made me grow much closer to each character and, for that, I appreciate it.  Amane's route was... Well, I can't really summarize my opinion on it. Angelic Howl was absolutely superb despite being poorly paced. Towards the end of the story I was scared, in tears, and ready to shoot myself from emphatic depression. But in other areas, everything felt poorly paced. The scenes before Angelic Howl were completely devoid of power and all of the incredible characterization built in Angelic Howl was wasted in the final moments of the route. The ending was badly written and unsatisfying. That one character in Angelic Howl really bugged me until I stopped seeing them as a character and more of a witch-like figure that's here to play games.  And Yuuji is a goddamned idiot. The man has no love in him at all. And even though he is knowledgeable and intelligent, he fares way too badly at the emotional department that I can't help but feel horrible whenever his comments ignore the girl's feelings. Which is even worse in Michiru's. I love her character, but Yuuji's lack of emotional attachment and love is sucking the romance out of the story.  I went into this novel expecting an emotional rollercoaster of love such as Clannad school arc, for some reason, and instead got an amazing Japanese version of . Not what I was looking for, but I'll take it.  The novel so far is a solid 7/10 (very good). I can't ignore the superb comedy, art, music and Angelic Howl even when showered by misplaced, uncalled for sexual content and poor pacing. The translation, if I rated it, would shoot this game up to an 8. Overall, fantastic experience so far. For reference, I gave Umineko a 9, Clannad School Arc a 4, and Katawa Shoujo a 4."

visualnovels,3a7aiu,BookofAeons,2,Thu Jun 18 21:28:02 2015 UTC,"After finishing Policenauts a little while ago, I finally decided to give the famous Snatcher a try. Well, I actually made a little detour over MGS1 and 2 first... Ahem, as expected from a Kojima work, I greatly enjoyed Snatcher.  Its dystopian setting and gritty cyber punk atmosphere was intriguing and completely sucked me in after some time. A major plus point for me was that there were a lot of optional info dumps. So, as soon as I could access Jordan and with it those info dumps, I spent about an hour just reading background information about Snatcher's universe :). I think it's laudable that they provided more information than just the for the story necessary amount, because reading about pop-cultural topics or a short summary of scientific achievements of mankind in a retro hard sci-fi style really helped forming the atmosphere and bringing the universe to life. Plus it's interesting.  The story is apparently quite similar to Blade Runner and references other popular sci-fi films from the 80ies. It's set in a dystopian world, where in 1996 a virus named Lucifer-Alpha eradicated half of mankind and about 50 years later a new threat in form ""snatchers"" appears. They are bioroids, who kill their victims, take their place in society and are nearly impossible to distinguish from humans. You play as Gillian Seed, an amnesiac who joins an anti-snatcher task force called J.U.N.K.E.R.. The player's goal is it and to track down the source of the snatchers as well as discovering Gillian's mysterious connections with the snatchers.  I liked the grim detective story, even if most of the twists were predictable - bar the typical convoluted Kojima ending, which I thought was quite good for his standards. It should be noted that the ending sequence was typically over 30 minutes long and featured only speech, no text. But it wasn't a loss as the English voice actors generally made a great job on Snatcher. Surprisingly the 16bit (originally 8bit) soundtrack was also superb, very atmospheric and able to convey the right emotions. Even the feared 'pixel hunting' predominantly occurring in older adventure games wasn't severe as triggering the right events was most of the time quite simple (and you technically couldn't hunt for pixels). So, Snatcher aged well, at least the Sega Genesis version.  While I said that most of Snatcher's twists were predictable, it also had surprising moments when I thought that something would happen and then didn't. And every time I was on alert regardless of what actually transpired later on. And then the shocker moments... I'm also fond of all the references to other Konami games, hidden fun conversations (& meta jokes) or in general the videophone conversations. Apart from giving off an somewhat immediate air, the conversations with Jamie, Gillian's wife who also suffers from amnesia, were a little high light for me. It was an interesting premise and seeing how the strained relationship between the two of them develops over the course of the game was actually rewarding.  Snatcher had a likeable, but a bit shallow beginning and middle part, but when things finally spiralled out of control I couldn't lay down my controller anymore. Personally I thought the ending was amazing. A little bit kitschy, but also dramatic and thought-provoking. I even ended up liking the actual solution, as it didn't go completely haywire like in some MGS games. I just wish Snatcher was longer and spent more time on narration and buildup, as things seemingly just happen in the beginning. Or that it was a pure VN in the first place..."

Differences i notice... amane wears a bra and is refered to as in her underwear when in the uncensored version she's naked. There was a scene where they were talking about masturbation habbits and they talked a little more in detail.   The biggest one i noticed was a scene where amane was talking about heroine, in the censored version she just says heroine and thats it but then i accidently stumbled on the scene in the uncensored version, and she was talking about the method for taking heroine, about heating it under a spoon and how good it felt. I genuinely thought she was a heroine addict, which would explain why her route is good, until i realized that it was taken out of the censored version so there's no way it could be. I wonder why they censored it.  i'm 9 hours in, i have a long long way to go before it gets good :(  edit: downvoted once again for not liking the beginning of your favorite visual novel, how sad can you get..."

I'm currently in Mizuki's route and I gotta say it's completely unimpressive in every way. A lot of the emotions are forced, heroines fall in love with MC BECAUSE he's the MC, and characters go from little/no affection for someone to ""devote my life to you"" levels of affection for practically no reason. This is off-putting to say the least.  I've started a couple of other routes to see if it's different and it doesn't seem like it.

visualnovels,3a7aiu,FinalNwo,2,Thu Jun 18 02:34:49 2015 UTC,"It's an official all-ages version of the game that was produced by the original creators, calling it censorship is basically hyperbole."

visualnovels,3a7aiu,bpat132,2,Thu Jun 18 04:42:50 2015 UTC,It's officially considered just a JRPG. It has a lot VN-style dialogue but the gameplay is the main focus so it's not really a VN. Basically if its not on VNDB then not many people would consider it a VN.

visualnovels,3a679c,superange128,7,Wed Jun 17 15:25:10 2015 UTC,"My favorite visual novel and couple~ (also has my second favorite ending ever)   Okabe - Granted some people will find him annoying, he's overall still the most enjoyable protagonist in my eyes. Funny (as in the funniest that is), gets plenty of development, has great chemistry with all the characters and is just too easy to like.   Kurisu - Basically everything about Okabe can be applied to her. She basically plays the role of Meiya+Yuuko from MLA at the same time for Okabe. As she acts as basically the main characters main confident as well as being the one that helps push the story forward and helps explains the plot to the audience. Plus she's just too damn cute. Though I have no idea how much this reddit actually likes her as a character.   Mayuri - The deredere childhood friend that's still a lot more well rounded then most. Granted she doesn't actually receive a huge amount of development or anything, but she's very well fleshed out and the multiple loops still allow you to see more sides to her character you might not have expected. Her and Okabe's relationship is just too endearing though is what makes her really special (as well as her relationship with everyone else). Her ending is probably the single most bittersweet ending I've ever read. It almost destroyed me entirely T_T  Daru - Funny enough even though he's the bro character, Kurisu actually plays the bro role a bit more than him. He's pretty funny and likable regardless and has a lot of good lines. I think the plot twists that involve him are the important part of his character. Perhaps the writer should have spent more time with him regardless.   Moeka - There's no doubt she'll get the lowest rating. Her plot was handled well in the visual novel, but handled much better in the anime if you ask me. She's another I would have liked the visual novel to expand on a bit more. Still she's pretty interesting regardless and how she's use thematically is great.  Ruka - The guy who will make a straight mans heart throb. These moments are too damn funny. His story is a bit strange but still very well done. Ruka and Faris mainly serve to help the game out thematically and assist Okabe's increasing development, but I think they still managed to do some unique things with him. The ending of his route is also pretty darn emotional and conflicting.  Faris - Funny and super strange. She has the best text messages as they are all very weird. Her plot line is probably the easiest to sympathize with, but the first half was a bit too much in one direction I have to say. I'd say the anime handled this better by cutting that part short. Honestly I liked her and she's more than meets the eye, and her route was super emotional, so I shouldn't complain but I feel like they should have given her more screen time and importance to the overall cast (she's the least present member at the meetings).   Suzuha - She's just awesome. It's almost strange how pure she can be despite spoiler. I guess that in itself is another well expanded upon character trait that shows how much she clings onto hope for the future. If anything she might spoiler a bit too quickly, but otherwise I have no complaints with her as a character and feel she's the strongest written other than Okabe and Kurisu."
visualnovels,3a679c,hyperknees91,3,Wed Jun 17 16:44:22 2015 UTC,"I'm predicting both Okabe and Kurisu getting in the 9 range, with Kurisu maybe beating Kyousuke, but probably not Beato."

Back when Tsukihime came out most of those characters topped the charts, and now it seems like in future polls there are high chances of hitting new high scores. Might just be a coincidence... but it's interesting."
visualnovels,3a679c,Joby05,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:54:42 2015 UTC,Unless newer voters came in or people changed their way of voting I highly doubt it  I mean Battler was rated on Day 2 and was around the 8.90-9.00 range
visualnovels,3a679c,Joby05,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:18:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, looking it over some more I agree that most characters are where they should be. I was just surprised how so many high ranked characters showed up since the last time I checked."
visualnovels,3a679c,hyperknees91,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:58:54 2015 UTC,I think the only thing that matters is how appealing the character is. Development also helps but people obviously are going to rate the characters the highest that they actually find likable. Like said on all these polls generally the quirky/over competent girl gets rated the highest on every single poll (in terms of story games). For example there's not a single doubt in my mind that Yuki from Subahibi will be rated the highest when people get to read that game. Same goes for Tsukihime as Arceid is the independent/over-competent/extremely quirky one. For dudes it's a little more up in the air.   In terms of charage's it's a little bit harder to pin but even the above still mostly applies (Momoyo is one of the few exceptions that didn't rate the highest). I guess it mostly depends on how much the audience likes their route mainly.
visualnovels,3a679c,ctom42,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:34:36 2015 UTC,"quirky/over competent girl gets rated the highest on every single poll   But Erika was 3rd for Umineko, not first...."
visualnovels,3a679c,hyperknees91,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:47:41 2015 UTC,Well she's an antagonist so I think that's a tad different. I would say kinetic visual novels might be viewed at a bit differently than heroine routes with individual romances as well.
visualnovels,3a679c,hyperknees91,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:11:34 2015 UTC,"Well I think to be more specific in /u/hyperknees91 case. He means the love interest/main heroine in a fairly serious story that has a fairly quirky side to her personality (i.e. Arc, Kagome, Haru) but still has a tendency to get very serious when needed.  I feel like this is why Momoyo isn't as high since the atmosphere of MajiKoi is a lot more light-hearted, so Momoyo's personality AND OPness are both more treated as a joke than something that's serious with a little quirkiness."
visualnovels,3a679c,ctom42,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:46:51 2015 UTC,"In Wanko's case, she might be the most well liked because she kinda employs the underdog vibe so much. It's kinda hard not to root for her (heck all the characters do as well). Plus she's voiced by Aoyama Yukari so that helps."
visualnovels,3a679c,Joby05,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:03:42 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't think it matters at all. Battler is sitting at #3 and he was from the second poll. To be honest, I think most of the Tsukihime characters are where they belong. None of the Nasuverse characters are actually that intersting IMO, several of them probably should be lower than they are."
visualnovels,3a679c,ctom42,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:46:17 2015 UTC,"Also think characters are where they should be at:  To bring more examples:   Saya is one of the first topics I did and she's been in the top 10-15 characters the whole time and something I expected. I agree that Tsukihime characters are where they belong. Some of these characters don't always gets 9s and 10s, the more ""mainstream"" VNs like these are the ones more likely to get haters on characters  For example Yumiko and Makina do decently on character contests/surveys besides this one due to how well-read Grisaia is. However in this series they don't have an an overly favorable score of 7.00+ Houzuki and Kenichi are very well-regarded/rated characters who read the series and they were in one of the earlier topics and I'm sure they'd get something similar if done today."
visualnovels,3a679c,hyperknees91,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:54:12 2015 UTC,"None of the Nasuverse characters are actually that intersting IMO   I think you lost me there... other than that I generally agree. They are mostly 6-8 characters, but certainly much more interesting that your typical SoL character."
visualnovels,3a679c,Joby05,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:00:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't think I rated any of them higher than an 8, but I also don't think I voted on any SOL VNs aside from KS."
visualnovels,3a679c,hyperknees91,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:55:28 2015 UTC,"I think the problem Nasu kind of has is he simply spends a bit too much time on the main characters (Shirou, Shiki and Ryogi) and not enough on everyone else (not just a problem he has of course). Kirei for example deserved to get as much focus as at least Erika did in Umineko, but the amount of screen time he has is pretty limited. As such most of the other characters don't undergo that much development, or even if they do it might be simply too fast to really digest much from it."
visualnovels,3a679c,ctom42,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:14:56 2015 UTC,"Eh, I guess I can buy the pacing thing but I dunno... saying that Ciel/Kohaku/Hisui didn't all get extreme character development is confusing to me. You have an extremely different impression of them from the beginning to the end, and in Kohaku's case she actually changes in really major ways. Even though Arcueid is a fan-favorite I think that she generally has the least amount of development."
visualnovels,3a679c,hyperknees91,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:24:57 2015 UTC,"It's mainly a pacing thing rather than a development thing with those Ciel and Hisui. I would say Kohaku is an exception though and is probably the most well done heroine in terms of development he's written so far. In general I would say Tsukihime is better written than FSN though.  Granted that's just my general criticism towards him and hopefully he improved with Mahoyo. I don't agree with Tsukihime's character ranking though as I agree, Arceid is the one I would rank last for sure and I would rank most of them higher than some of the heroines above them. I think having voice acting might have helped."
visualnovels,3a679c,hyperknees91,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:36:33 2015 UTC,"I agree about Kohaku, she is probably the most well written Nasu character in all the works I have read. But thinking about say Fate characters for example, many of them don't even get any development until H/A. And that's including the fact that the servants all have myths to work from, making the work for Nasu minimal. It's kind of impressive how under characterized a lot of them are, now that I think about it.   Also the most popular ones tend to be the least intersting characters. Saber, Rin, Arcueid and Ciel are all really straightforward archetypal characters without a whole lot making them interesting. Sakura, Hisui and Kohaku have a lot more going on, but they are still fairly flat when compared to say Umineko characters. Not that this is a problem unique to Nasuverse, as you said, it's just that it's one of the most popular with flat characters."

For example in the steins;gate franchise only the original came out for PC, none of the fandisks or sequels got a PC release."
visualnovels,3a1chf,Edadinasni,5,Tue Jun 16 17:29:34 2015 UTC,"This really sucks for English-speaking fans, since typically we can't read them unless there's a fan translation, and you can't exactly release a fan translation on most consoles.   JAST does have the licenses for SciADV novels, but considering how long it took them to localize Steins;Gate, by the time they localize this it probably will be on PC.   Although if they announced Robotics;Notes in English right now, that and Danganronpa 2 would probably be enough for me to take the plunge and buy a Vita. F/HA in English certainly wouldn't hurt, but it's pretty unlikely."

visualnovels,3a0x1s,Arcanus44,3,Tue Jun 16 13:58:09 2015 UTC,The only problem with Morpheus and VN content is that something ecchi is very unlikely to be published. Morpheus may not be the best solution it is still very reasonable for VR experiences with a entry level cost much lower than the competitors assuming you already own a PS4. The argument of already owning a PC can't really be used as most do not have a PC rig with the minimum specifications listed at this day and age.
visualnovels,3a0x1s,Arcanus44,3,Tue Jun 16 14:22:41 2015 UTC,"The joke I was making is that in the VR industry, the Morpheus arguably is the worst contender out of them all.  It's a Sony exclusive, so only PS4 owners have access to it, as opposed to the Rift, Vive, and Fove, which not only are for PC, but the Rift also announced you can stream Xbox One games to the Rift.  The other problem with the Morpheus is from a developer's point of view: if you want to add Rift support to your game after it's been released, it's incredibly easy if you're using Unity and Unreal, two of the most popular gaming engines used today.  The Morpheus, on the other hand, requires that you be developing for the Morpheus day one; you cannot add Morpheus support after the fact.  Another side of this is as you pointed out; Sony isn't going to publish content like that, however the Rift is an open-source VR platform; people have already made loli sex sims using the Rift and the equivalent of a fleshlight attached to a Novint Falcon.  The possibilities of immersion like this are boundless, and I'll be honest when I say I'm interested to see how the adult side of VR develops."

And the VN consumers aren't exactly PCMUSTARDRACE guys at all. Most games are designed to be played on 15 year old hardware for a reason."
visualnovels,3a0x1s,player0000000000,5,Wed Jun 17 22:37:05 2015 UTC,"Dude. We're talking Japan otaku. They alone power the anime industry. If there was a device that could let them meet their waifu, do you really think the price point of 1500 usd is going to stop them? And that's only the beginning. Remember how much first smartphones costed. Three years from now today's high end setup will cost much less.  Don't underestimate the power of their burning desire to be in a better reality."
visualnovels,3a0x1s,RozenKristal,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:04:38 2015 UTC,I concur
visualnovels,3a0x1s,guimi2,3,Sun Jun 28 00:19:37 2015 UTC,"Yes and no, it'll be cheaper to do clasic VN's and we still don't know how VR sales will be so...  it'll probably be the future, in the long term, when VR is cheaper and extended."
visualnovels,3a0x1s,dont_come_any_closer,3,Tue Jun 16 11:58:07 2015 UTC,This. Japanese VN producers have always been struggling with production cost. The flood of formulaic moege is a direct result of companies playing it safe.
visualnovels,3a0x1s,somebody_forgotten,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:47:46 2015 UTC,The reason is that they want a guaranteed outcome and if that's what gives it that's what they'll do.
visualnovels,3a0x1s,ak0lita,3,Wed Jun 17 05:17:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know if there's one definition of Visual Novel that everyone agrees upon (most likely not), but I think it's safe to say that ""if you can't read it, it's not a novel"". So, answering the question in title - no.  These is maybe new approach to sims game, maybe entirely new genre (Slice of Life Online), but not VN. Also, they've already banned sexual content - and as we know, ""Visual Novel"" is just a nicer way to say ""chinese porn game"", so second nope here."
visualnovels,3a0x1s,Bobemmo,3,Tue Jun 16 12:30:08 2015 UTC,"... But your flair is from a VN without sexual content >_>  On the subject of reading: they could always put subtitles.  I doubt they'd do it just to conform to a certain genre, but they might do it anyways to help out people who have hearing problems or something."
visualnovels,3a0x1s,ak0lita,2,Tue Jun 16 12:50:05 2015 UTC,"whisper Don't take people seriously here, on the internet. It's not worth it.  On more serious note: I think that subtitles would destroy an immersion and that's whole reason for VR. But you also made a good point with that example, so maybe it could work after all? ...welp, I still don't know."
visualnovels,3a0x1s,The_Dran,3,Tue Jun 16 13:10:38 2015 UTC,"No.  We may see some VR adoption and support in eroge (Custom Maid 3D for example), but Visual Novels are a medium which simply doesn't translate to VR. At the very least, this video certainly doesn't make me think, ""This would work great for VNs!"""
visualnovels,3a0x1s,vitunrumaebolaneeker,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:06:02 2015 UTC,Maybe 2D art in 3D would work for VN? Like Paper Mario?
visualnovels,3a0x1s,pik3rob,3,Tue Jun 16 13:09:14 2015 UTC,I think it will be too expensive to produce
visualnovels,3a0x1s,hyperknees91,2,Tue Jun 16 13:14:19 2015 UTC,"No. Visual Novels are cheaper to make than most games, and they don't sell incredibly well. They don't make enough money to put this much budget into. I would definitely be interested to see a visual novel like this, but I don't think we will get one any time soon."
visualnovels,3a0x1s,somebody_forgotten,3,Tue Jun 16 21:16:14 2015 UTC,I actually think something like this would sell much better than normal visual novels...
visualnovels,3a0x1s,ScarsUnseen,3,Wed Jun 17 05:30:58 2015 UTC,"Depending on how its marketed, definitely. Most of the people I talked to won't read visual novels because they don't like the use of mostly static pictures/sprites."
visualnovels,3a0x1s,Nyanu,0,Wed Jun 17 10:05:34 2015 UTC,"Well, it's a niche market. What do you expect."
visualnovels,3a0x1s,nogaku,2,Wed Jun 17 05:21:10 2015 UTC,"I would say that visual novels are a poor fit because of the written aspect.  While you could read text in VR, it would be a waste of the device's capabilities, and a poor way to read for extended periods of time.  I could, on the other hand, see a sister format to visual novels, something that leans closer to an RPG than visual novels do currently, but with a focus remaining on delivering narrative experiences similar to those found in visual novels.  Maybe call it a Narrative Sim.    They'd obviously have to be higher budget than VNs are currently with 3D animated characters and environments and positional audio, but that might actually work in their favor as far as finding a larger audience.  Likely earlier examples would be a mostly on-rails experience, with the viewer being able to look where they wish, but movement being controlled by the story, but that could change with higher budgets.  I'm not sure it would be the future...  I mean we do still read books after all.  But it could be interesting as an alternative."
visualnovels,3a0x1s,nogaku,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:27:21 2015 UTC,I feel like they would be slightly cheaper to produce because you wouldn't have to hire voice actors or anything like that. I also love the prospect of actually being IN the story as it's being told.   Although something like this would probably work better in an rpg with VN elements like you said. I'd love to walk around the world and have conversations with characters within the story.  It could definitely be done in a way. My question would simply be if developers would want to create such a game? I guess with time we may see something similar. I hope anyway.
visualnovels,3a0x1s,Loffah,2,Sun Jun 21 08:08:20 2015 UTC,"Quite an interesting vision for the VN scene to adapt to the VR technology. If this were to happen (most likely years away though), I'd have another reason to buy a VR."
visualnovels,3a0x1s,player0000000000,2,Tue Jun 16 11:46:53 2015 UTC,"Wonder how it will adapt. Will VN's turn into God view into different scenes where you see the story unfold from a 3rd perspective? Will it be lime Summer Lesson and first person? Is it even a visual novel anymore? In any case, as a Wifu simulator, I'm looking forward to what the future brings, not to mention H-'s"
visualnovels,3a1u1k,superange128,3,Tue Jun 16 15:57:08 2015 UTC,"I thank Wanko to Kurasou for, in a way, being the reason that I frequent /r/visualnovels. About two years ago I discovered that this subreddit existed, and when I came here to take a look around, I saw--I think it was in a thread with recommendations--a small discussion of Wanko to Kurasou. Someone mentioned it as being a good read, and with not too much other than that to go on, I got it and read it on a whim.  I liked it a lot! It's not exactly the most deep, story-heavy VN, but it doesn't need to be. The human characters are pretty interesting, and the anthro pets are adorable. Yuuichi is one of the more unique protagonists I've seen in a VN, especially one that's, well, a bit more adult content (sexual) focused like Wanko to Kurasou is.  Two final thoughts: Risa's route is way better than Nadeshiko's, and I really wish Koutarou had her own route. She's probably my favorite character in the VN, tied with Risa."
visualnovels,3a1u1k,Daruc,2,Tue Jun 16 19:15:31 2015 UTC,Interesting how it became a reason for you to come here often. Was it one of the first VNs you read?  I actually like how it was more SoL focused but while still having a tiny bit of story here and there and feel good scenes.  Yuuichi is still a fairly unique protagonist in general since   I probably should have just did Nadeshiko's route first since I also liked it much less than Risa's. Nadeshiko herself was just boring.  Given the whole dog-girl thing I was actually surprised the only characters with actual decidated routes were two humans.  EDIT: Risa's one of the few VN characters to get 10/10 waifu material score from me.
visualnovels,3a1u1k,Daruc,2,Tue Jun 16 20:51:38 2015 UTC,"It was one of the first half-dozen or so VNs I read, yeah. I saw it mentioned here, read it, and I was like ""wow, if I can discover good VNs like that from here purely on a recommendation and a whim, it sure seems to be worth going here!"", so I have ever since. Only started actually taking part in discussion recently though.   Yuuichi   Yuuichi's a great protagonist.    Nadeshiko herself was just boring   Absolutely agree.   Given the whole dog-girl thing I was actually surprised the only characters with actual decidated routes were two humans   I feel like, considering how we're treated to a little explanation of how animal-people came to be in the beginning of the VN, they could totally make a longer VN set in the same world, maybe set during when it was all just starting, or something. There's a lot of places they could take the story to. Not likely to happen, but I can dream.   Risa 10/10 waifu   A man after my own heart!"

visualnovels,39y93v,superange128,2,Mon Jun 15 23:37:24 2015 UTC,I have a small group of online friends on another forum who loves MajiKoi as much as me and we talked about random non-canon pairings we'd like and a few of us liked this one.  I believe the common route kinda had a few nice moments but of course Gakuto pulls the whole I ONLY DATE OLDER WOMEN thing so nothing happens.

visualnovels,39vw94,The_Dran,2,Mon Jun 15 12:45:06 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Their ""commitment"" (can it even be called that when they've only released one game and then proceeded to milk it for everything they can get?) to releasing HD visual novels is definitely a goal I can get behind, but I find it very hard to justify paying for IMHHW and sending the message that I'm okay with misguided censorship and a broken translation that they still haven't fixed after two years."
visualnovels,39vw94,Cornetto_Man,2,Mon Jun 15 15:54:49 2015 UTC,Indeed. I just hope that the backlash from IMMHW will have taught them a lesson in what their actual audience wants. I am rather curious as to where they'll go next. I have no problem supporting their next project provided it's something I'm interested in and that they learned from their mistakes.

I guess it doesn't sound as depressing when I type it out like that but the way it was framed was incredibly feelsy."
visualnovels,39vetd,ctom42,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:37:09 2015 UTC,"The MajiKoi one you mentioned is depressing yet realistic and a good one. Not every thing you pursue in life will be happiness and sparkles. You'll have failures like that.   One notable one is Clannad and Edelweiss Clannad After Story and Edelweiss Haruka route spoilers  Ive had a great life and supportive parents so seeing characters that have really terrible parents/childhoods and developed obvious insecurities and bad personality traits makes me realize how much a bad childhood can really affect one's personality and motivations. Notable ones include: Touka from Sharin, Tomoya in Clannad, Umineko Chiru spoilers and every main character in Grisaia.  While the BETA is obviously unrealistic at this point in time, Muv-Luv Alternative can show how depressing it can be to be part of the military or war in general, especially when you get close to or respect certain people in your squad.  In Sharin no Kuni, Sachi route spoilers  In the Ever17/Remember11, imagining how depressing it would be in either situation/story sounds really saddening. You have no idea if/when you'll get help and you have a couple of unlikable people in your group.  In Edelweiss Mizuki's route spoilers  Another MajiKoi one Miyako route"

visualnovels,39tid4,PM_ME_1_NUDE,6,Sat Jun 20 17:19:50 2015 UTC,So like I'm very new to VNs as a whole. I haven't played any real ones. I bought the higurashi sound novel on steam and was disappointed when I found out it had no choices and stuff. I also bought huniepop FOR THE PUZZLES and was pleased with that. I'm planning on getting Clannad when that comes out on steam but I haven't played any actual VNs. Preferably it would be easier for me if i could just buy them on steam and stuff since the summer sale is going on. I really liked the show steins;gate and heard the VN was pretty good. My VN interest is pretty much the same as my interest in anime in terms of genre and I have a MAL if people want me to link it. But is it worth it to get the VN if I basically already know the story to those shows???? I'm completely new to this stuff so be gentle.  Any good places to start?
visualnovels,39tid4,Cornetto_Man,3,Sat Jun 20 13:21:46 2015 UTC,I think it's worth playing the VN even if you've seen the anime. In most cases the anime cuts out significant amounts of content to fit the main plot in. S;G and Clannad are two of the few adaptations that do the source justice but both still cut quite a bit.   Before I give actual recommendations could I see your MAL? It should make recommending things easier.
visualnovels,39tid4,PM_ME_1_NUDE,2,Sat Jun 20 13:39:20 2015 UTC,http://myanimelist.net/animelist/swagfag_420  Thanks for helping out
visualnovels,39tid4,Cornetto_Man,3,Sat Jun 20 14:06:42 2015 UTC,Well first I highly recommend you continue Higurashi. The VN is far better than the anime.   Other than that I'd recommend having a look at Grisaia no Kajitsu. It released not too long ago on Steam and it's loved on this sub for a good reason.   Also have a look at Cho Dengeki Stryker. Its also on Steam so have a look to see if you think you'd like it.
visualnovels,39tid4,PM_ME_1_NUDE,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:32:35 2015 UTC,i'll give them a look!
visualnovels,39tid4,LeafCascade,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:17:29 2015 UTC,Higurashi   There's also a voice and 16:9 patch for the first chapter available here.
visualnovels,39tid4,The_Bunny_Advocate,5,Sat Jun 20 15:39:35 2015 UTC,"If choices are important to you then you might want to check out the vndb.org page for any future VNs you're interested in, the tag ""kinetic novel"" means there aren't any choices in it.  As for Steins;Gate, the anime is a pretty fantastic adaptation but it does cut some important content, namely the alternative endings. If you're a big SG fan then I'd certainly recommend trying the VN, although when there are so many other fantastic VNs you haven't read it seems a shame to read a VN whose ending you already know.  There's a good guide on new VNs to try over on /r/vnsuggest here that you might want to check out."
visualnovels,39tid4,Fuwante0,2,Sat Jun 20 13:38:47 2015 UTC,"Here's the stickied thread from /r/vnsuggest. Judging by how you like Clannad, I recommend Planetarian as it's also made by Key and available on Steam. It doesn't have choices though but it is pretty short and perfect for a beginner.  Other then that here's a recommendation chart (also in that sticky) with some really good VNs. You'd want to avoid the tag ""Kinetic Novel"" since that means that it doesn't have choices.  Edit: Forgot to mention that Higurashi is indeed a real VN. Just part of a subset of VNs named Kinetic Novels which as I said before are VNs that don't have choices."

In Umineko there's more in comparison that you won't understand if you haven't read or watched Higurashi. Personally I'd suggest you check out Higurashi first before reading Umineko. I feel like if I were to have read Umineko before Higurashi, I'd be straining myself to see the connection between the two.   You can do either or first, but if you're curious about the connection between the two, watch/read Higurashi first (anime was pretty good imo). As OavatosDK already mentioned, theoretically, Higurashi is the prequel to Umineko, as Umineko's universe is based on the framework of Higurashi's."

visualnovels,39tid4,falafel_eater,1 point,Sat Jun 20 09:49:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but how can Higurashi refer to Umineko when Umineko did not exist at the time Higurashi was written?    If anything, Umineko calls back to/expands upon points from Higurashi. It's really a semantic debate to be honest, and maybe not a particularly interesting one either."
visualnovels,39tid4,absolutezcero,3,Sat Jun 20 10:07:30 2015 UTC,"I guess that means the author had both works in mind it was being written. It's not unheard of for authors to intertwine multiple works together.   That's relatively what I was saying earlier: that Higurashi doesn't really reference Umineko except one or two mentions at most. Umineko however has several hints from dialogue to the characters' designs that reference Higurashi.  I don't find it interesting either. Lots of the hints given in Umineko make it obvious that the two are related, so it's not much to debate about imo."
visualnovels,39tid4,OavatosDK,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:35:34 2015 UTC,"If you're willing to, I definitely recommend reading Higurashi no Naku Koro ni (Higurashi When They Cry) and its sequel Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai before Umineko. It enhances the experience a lot, and both are great. Most of the spinoffs don't matter, the main series titles are Higurashi, Higurashi Kai, Umineko, and Umineko Chiru."
visualnovels,39tid4,Cornetto_Man,5,Fri Jun 19 21:08:17 2015 UTC,Okay so there's Umineko no Naku Koro ni which is the first four chapters. Then there's Umineko no Naku Koro ni Chiru which is chapter's 4-8. You can ignore the spinoffs/fandiscs as far as I know. Those two are the only two you need to read.  Then there's Higurashi no Naku Koro ni which is an earlier work by the same writer. Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai is the sequel to Higurashi in the same way Chiru is to Umineko.  Now Umineko apparently (I haven't read it yet) has a few small references to Higurashi. However you lose pretty much nothing by not having read Higurashi first. The references are small and unimportant. So you can jump straight into Umineko and its sequel Umineko Chiru right now.  I personally recommend having a look at Higurashi and trying it out. It's an excellent horror VN. It's currently being retranslated and released on Steam so you might want to wait for those (but it could take years for all 8 chapters to be released).
visualnovels,39tid4,OavatosDK,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:04:38 2015 UTC,"Now Umineko apparently (I haven't read it yet) has a few small references to Higurashi. However you lose pretty much nothing by not having read Higurashi first.   That's mostly what the Umineko readers who haven't read Higurashi say. Higurashi dramatically changes your perception of a character and initial perception of the world with several direct callbacks. So while yes you can read Umineko first, Higurashi definitely enhances the experience."
visualnovels,39tid4,ctom42,2,Fri Jun 19 21:06:24 2015 UTC,"I'd disagree. I did not find that my knowledge of Higurashi really affected my experience with Umineko to any noticable degree. The few references were cool, but I took them as just that, references."
visualnovels,39tid4,OavatosDK,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:30:30 2015 UTC,"Higurashi  If it was as simple as the few references they make as jokes I would agree more, but Umineko feels like a natural evolution out of the Higurashi narrative in terms of how it uses reader perceptions and concepts (especially since I read the latter right before starting Umineko)."
visualnovels,39tid4,ctom42,2,Fri Jun 19 23:48:45 2015 UTC,"But that is purely a matter of perspective. Many people go into Umineko expecting something different from Higurashi, or simply not having defined expectations. For these people even if they have read Higurashi they don't necessarily use their experiences from it as a basis for initial impressions, I certainly know I didn't.   I can understand where you are coming from, and it's also clear that Ryukishi took that into account Ep 1 spoilers, but I just don't see it as an integral part of the experience, and I often find that many people who go in with that mindset end up more confused because the works are inherently different.   I can't get into too many more details especially with Bern as you have not finished Umineko yet, but in the grand scheme of things the impact of reading Higurashi is negligible for most people."
visualnovels,39tid4,Bobemmo,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:56:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's more the other way around; if you read Umineko first, you get a rather weird perception of certain things in Higurashi.  I'd also recommend reading Higurashi first even though they're not super strongly related, though."
visualnovels,39tid4,OavatosDK,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:09:55 2015 UTC,"Umineko is built out of the framework established in Higurashi basically, so applying the advanced framework to Higurashi messes things up."

visualnovels,39tid4,absolutezcero,3,Fri Jun 19 09:34:01 2015 UTC,It's possible. I hated the text box as well. Here's how to get it from the Umineko wikia. However it won't be exactly like the first season's. At most the text will take up a third of the window because the text is scripted as if it was still in the textbox.
visualnovels,39tid4,ctom42,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:48:05 2015 UTC,"No, there is not, at least not without removing the whole umitweak patch. There are however three different textbox styles you can choose from if you just think it looks ugly.   The only reason the textbox is optional for the first half is because they did not finish the conversion in time for the initial release. The only reason the game originally had NVL style is because it is easier to produce. Hence why the non-doujin releases of 07th expansion games (console ports, etc) always use ADV instead. In fact, for Rose Gun Days Ryukishi actually got enough of a staff that it was ADV to begin with. Typically most people prefer ADV over NVL."
visualnovels,39tid4,absolutezcero,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:20:07 2015 UTC,"That's not true. Here's proof. There's a customized script file available for people who prefer NVL. I got one for Umineko Chiru and it kept the tweak intact. However the text only takes up however much it was intended for the textbox though (at most, a third)."
visualnovels,39tid4,ctom42,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:49:38 2015 UTC,"Ok, but that is not released through Umitweak. Anything is possible when people are making their own scripts. Also I'm not sure why you would want to just shift the text to the top of the screen and remove the box. The reason most NVL fans like NVL is that they prefer having a full screen worth of text at a time.  Also I'd actually say that is still ADV format. Basically the textbox is just shifted and made 100% transparent (I'm guessing that is actually how it's coded, but even if it's not, that's efficiently what they are achieving). True NVL would be full screen."

Officially no it doesn't exist (is the Umineko tweak even ""official"" to begin with?), but it still does nonetheless.   It's just a matter of preference. Personally I didn't like reading text at the bottom of the screen. And I was too used to the NVL-styled text from EP 1-4 to revert back. And I liked the screen worth of text as well, but I easily adapted to the text box worth's of it in Chiru.   Yea, you can say that it technically still is in ADV format since it'll fill up a text box's worth of text at a time instead of the full screen. It's possible to get a full screen's worth, but you'll have to re-script the entire game to do that, which takes loads of effort."

visualnovels,39tid4,8cccc9,3,Thu Jun 18 21:21:49 2015 UTC,"I would say it's worth its price alone for the soundtrack, which is already included in FLAC with the VN. As for your actual question, that depends on what you value. Dysfunctional Systems ep1 is only an introductory chapter that ends on a (little) cliffhanger and makes you crave for more. It has quite an interesting and unique setting with a lot of thought put in it and outstanding production values. And while it's only an introductory chapter, there happens quite a bit and is a short ride in itself.  If you really can't stand cliffhangers, you maybe want to stay away from DS, but for two and a half bucks it's probably worth the risk. Personally I really enjoyed DS, especially the rational take on things, the optional info dumps, the setting and the finale."

I'm one of the few people in the face of earth that was completely unimpressed by the anime. I really wanted to like it, but I couldn't. I really loved the beginning, where the mystery and thriller aspects had a great build-up, and the characters' chemistry was superb, but once the drama actually started I felt like the whole story fell flat on its face.  Okabe's actions didn't make sense during Spoiler  Overall it felt like a great setting with a great concept that was ruined by the horrible execution.  I know that the visual novel actually develops Ruka's and Feyris' characters. But what I really care about is if the issues I had with the main route are resolved in the visual novel. Spoiler  I played F/SN after having watched the anime, so I know how much of a difference just being able to read the main character's thoughts can make.  What I'm worried about is the fact that some people say that in Steins;Gate's case, the anime was a very faithful adaptation, in which case I'm not sure if it'll be such a different experience as reading F/SN was.  So, how is it?  Also, for what it's worth, I'm currently reading Chaos;Head and it's been an incredible experience so far."

About Rintaro's decisions:  The pacing  Mayuri   Mr. Braun,   If you can invest a couple dollars I say is not something that will disappoint you, not by a long shot.

The e-mote system was interesting, it was adorable and of course catgirls. All that being said I'd recommend it if you want to overdose on cute. If you want anything more than that then avoid it.

My personal opinion is that stuff like anime/movies/VN etc. should be evaluated with very clear cut intentions. I evaluate them based on how well they fulfill my expectation.  To give you an idea, I looked into Higurashi expecting a good story. That's why it's great to hear that it's well done. I wouldn't want to get rektm8 by some poor translations.  For titles like Nekopara though, I am well aware of what the selling point is, thus I would go in expecting nothing but plot and economics. I don't really care if it has no solid story or whatever, as long whatever story that's present is semi-coherent, it's good enough.

There is and there isn't. Technically it can be done but in reality all the ""patch"" was was just an illegal copy of the 18+ version that you replace the Steam version with. As such I can't link (or really recommend it since the 18+ version can be bought rather cheaply) it. There has been some talk recently that the patch was edited to remove parts so that it would only work with a Steam version but as of right now the original patch still contains a pirated version of the game.   I also want to know more on why you think Sakura etc. are awful. Not to oppose you; I've never even played them. I'm just curious to know why you rate it poorly because my initial impression was that the art's decent...   Literally all it's got going for it is the art. Everything else is just not good. The story is a mess of cliches and tropes (and filled with misspellings and grammar errors), the characters are cardboard cut outs with zero depth or development and the music is as generic as it gets. It's just all around awful.  By the way, if I can make another recommendation. If you want something cute (like NekoPara) but with an actually decent story and characters then check out Princess Evangile. It's a personal favourite of mine. The Steam version has H-scenes removed (the 18+ version is available here. There's no patch for this one) but honestly the h-scenes aren't too important. I liked them since some were handled a lot more realistically than most eroge but they're not too important overall."

Dodged a bullet there by asking first haha.  Princess Evangile looks interesting. I shall take a closer look when I get home. As a side note (I don't know how related JRPGs are to VN's... they probably aren't), have you heard of Hyperdimension Neptunia by chance? If so, thoughts?"
visualnovels,39tid4,Cornetto_Man,3,Wed Jun 17 23:28:48 2015 UTC,"have you heard of Hyperdimension Neptunia by chance?   Hahaha I own a copy of 1, 2, Rebirth 1 and the Limited Edition of Rebirth 2 (and will be getting Rebirth 3 as soon as it comes out). So yeah, I've heard of it :P  Personally I love them. There's not much in the way of a serious story but for fans of anime and video games the story that is there is very entertaining. The gameplay in the Rebirth games is excellent too. I'd highly recommend the series."

visualnovels,39tid4,EnglishInfix,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:48:25 2015 UTC,"Not really. Rebirth 1 and 2 are remakes of 1 and 2 with vastly improved gameplay. The story is pretty much the same (apart from a few characters removed and new ones added). The first two aren't on Steam either, only PS3"

visualnovels,39tid4,Checklad,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:52:40 2015 UTC,"Not the same guy but: If My Heart Had Wings is a butchered translation of an otherwise ok game from an ok studio (if you give a shit about moege that is). If you're really interested in it, I'd wait for the full restoration patch (IIRC the current one only reinserts the h-scenes, and a full restoration is underway)."
visualnovels,39tid4,zethan,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:55:58 2015 UTC,"The art is the only good thing about the Sakura series, so you're better off just looking at the CGs for a few minutes than wasting 10h~ of your lifetime. Same might be said about Nekopara as well, but it does well what it wants to do. Sakura Spirit doesn't.  The writing is terrible, even for Moege. It is an OELVN series that tries too hard to be Japanese by just including random Japanese words in sentences, so it's specifically made for the cringy type of weeaboos.  The music is ripped off other games that aren't VNs.  The story is nonexistent. You may believe there is one, but the only thing you get is the description on Steam.  No 18+ version is wasted potential. I don't think it's important for a VN to have 18+ scenes, all-ages is fine too, but if the only good thing about the VN is the art, it would be the best thing to focus on while developing it."

Can anyone help me? I also did play half through nekopara but i didn't really like it."
visualnovels,39tid4,LeafCascade,3,Wed Jun 17 17:08:33 2015 UTC,"You seem to be phrasing it a bit awkwardly, but if what you're looking for is a story/plot-based narrative that also features sex scenes, then most of the visual novels you'll find here should be appropriate.    That said it's typically not really intended to reward the player as much as just tell a story that also features some sex. (Although this varies from novel to novel).    In addition to the recommendation of Grisaia no Kajitsu, you might also want to check out G-Senjou no Maou or Comyu."
visualnovels,39tid4,LordRuler,3,Wed Jun 17 13:50:40 2015 UTC,"I have a little thread over here for newcomers to this medium.

visualnovels,39tid4,LeafCascade,5,Wed Jun 17 14:24:23 2015 UTC,"Hey guys. So I have a bit of a dilemma, I just read one of the greatest VN's ever and want more.   Just finished 100% Majikoi, and it was the best thing ever. A perfect mix of humour, characters, eroge, not taking itself too seriously, and, my personal favourite, not so much breaking the fourth wall as completely ignoring it, which was hilarious at times.  I had a lot of fun reading it! It wasn't all fun and games, there were important messages and difficult choices/paths too, but most of all it was a good time~!  Someone has mentioned ""Sakura Bitmap"" before, but it's apparently untranslated...  I'm wondering if there's anything out there similar to Majikoi?     I know there's a sequel being translated atm"

If you're looking for a close-knit group of friends doing things together (as long as you don't mind that they're both all-ages), I can highly recommend Little Busters! and Rewrite.  Also, try browsing /r/vnsuggest to get a feel for what is commonly recommended."
visualnovels,39tid4,LeafCascade,2,Wed Jun 17 08:24:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sorry, should have mentioned, I've read [the vast majority] that's regularly recommended around here with the exception of MuvLuv (which I'll get around too eventually).  I loved Rewrite, LittleBusters was good too~ thanks for your suggestions  I actually read Grisaia a while ago, and a few weeks/months (I don't really recall) after I finished it, all of a sudden it was everywhere and we were all reading it, it got kickstarted and so on. What happened? I'd thought I'd stumbled upon an awesome sleeper VN haha  thanks again man"
visualnovels,39tid4,LordRuler,3,Wed Jun 17 09:35:16 2015 UTC,"Grisaia's been insanely popular around here since its fan translation was released in 2013.

So it's far from a sleeper VN, hehe.  If you still want recommendations I'd like you to create a VNDB list with votes and link it to me so I can see what else you've read/what you liked."

I'm reading through Miyako route (I found her really funny so I chose her first) but it seems somewhat lacking, I was not expeting some huge drama, tears or life changing messages, but I feel that the whole 'need to open up to everyone' is lost in all the rest of what is going on. Besides a lot of the stuff that is happening around the characters, seem to have almost no connection to (what I think is) the 'main' plot of the route. That is why I feel like the bits an pieces are part of mayor plots in other routes, hence my first question. I also feel like I'm only half the whole route (I'm on the first week of september) so maybe I should wait a little more to get to the 'interesting' part.   I really do not want to drop this VN: I really like the humor and the general atmosphere of the story!"
visualnovels,39tid4,superange128,2,Tue Jun 16 17:33:50 2015 UTC,There's a light spoiler for Yukie's route casually presented in Momoyo's route. So you might possibly want to read Yukie's first.   Honestly I would just recommend not reading those two back to back mostly as they are kind of similar. Miyako and Kazuko's routes are a bit more drama oriented then the others so you might also want to space those two apart as well. Unless of course you want them back to back.
visualnovels,39tid4,ctom42,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:37:10 2015 UTC,Huge drama doesn't happen nearly as much in other routes as it does in Miyako (though it's not fully gone).  I liked Miyako's route's drama but can understand why people wouldn't.  Basically every main route and side route (outside maybe Agave) has the great humor/atmosphere you like a lot.
visualnovels,39tid4,Cornetto_Man,3,Wed Jun 17 19:19:16 2015 UTC,"Oh! don't get my wrong I'm a HUGE sucker for tons of drama. And I really enjoy the over the top humor of the VN.  The truth is, I did not like (at the begining, mind you, it wrapped out so good that every complaint vanished) the route because it have not enough drama to call it 'dramatic' and not enough humor to call ir 'humorous', that is if you can understand what I'm trying to say... maybe it's not easy to convey why I felt it bland."
visualnovels,39tid4,wemilord,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:40:02 2015 UTC,"Oh alright, then I think the other main routes will easily fill your void of good humor and good drama (won't say which route(s) for drama) mostly since the way Miyako's route was executed was a bit different than the others."
visualnovels,39tid4,Pikaflare,2,Tue Jun 16 23:43:42 2015 UTC,"People tend to have very different opinions of the routes in Majikoi.

The only routes that seem universally loved are Wanko's route and Agave.   That said, most people who make it through the common route end up loving the VN as a whole, even if one or two routes don't really do it for them."
visualnovels,39tid4,dont_come_any_closer,2,Tue Jun 16 23:56:00 2015 UTC,"Not really. For the most part the routes in Majikoi are all pretty self-contained with only small little references to stuff that happens in other routes.

visualnovels,39tid4,LeafCascade,2,Mon Jun 15 21:51:55 2015 UTC,"You can get Grisaia no Kajitsu on Steam and put it on auto mode, and you'll get what you want."
visualnovels,39tka8,Aexis_Skyen,15,Sun Jun 14 17:18:16 2015 UTC,Not really happy with what SP is acquiring these days... This doesn't seem to be that bad. H-scenes might make it okay.  I'm not really happy with the direction they're putting their effort towards. There are better titles out there to put that in.
visualnovels,39tka8,Docoda,10,Sun Jun 14 18:24:12 2015 UTC,"It seems they're going for quantity over quality, at least for now. I can see why it's necessary for the time being, and I don't really mind, at least as long as I don't have to see these type of posts every other day.   And I don't really like what I'm seeing here either -- but then again, I dislike a lot of things. I don't mean to be disrespectful, but like, the fact that you say it may improve with H-scenes is actually laughable to me."
visualnovels,39tka8,LeafCascade,4,Sun Jun 14 18:31:18 2015 UTC,"I don't mean to be disrespectful, but like, the fact that you say it may improve with H-scenes is actually laughable to me.   It even sounds laughable to myself, because I don't really care about H-scenes unless it adds something in a good or useful way. But I'm just trying to find anything positive in this. Because I'm just getting fed up with what SP is pulling off these days.  You are right about the quantity over quality thing. So far only their own kickstarter projects (and not these acquired that had their own kickstarter campaigns) are what interest me (And maybe Sacrament Sheep/NekoPara). So I try to keep my criticism for the rest for myself, but at some point (now) it is starting to get ridiculous and I'll just openly show my opinion (which I've actually always done, but not a lot and less direct)"
visualnovels,39tka8,Docoda,5,Sun Jun 14 18:46:41 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're looking for the highly requested titles that people want. It can take upwards to a year or more to get them to even talk to you. Also we're saving stuff for AX anyways.."
visualnovels,39tka8,dovac,7,Sun Jun 14 20:27:19 2015 UTC,"It's cool that you're saving these big announcements for AX. But does that mean that every single semi-big con you guys go to needs some announcements of new licenses? Announcements of licensing some OELVN's and random JP VN's.  I had hoped SP would just specialize themselves, or at least keep themselves to the sort of VN's they were handling at first. High quality works like Fault and Economica. But then you guys decided to publish OELVN's. Which is in some way a nice thing to do. But what about bringing the JP VN scene to the west before starting to worry about all these half baked things people are making here.  I would actually want to write more here. But I don't think this is the place for it. Might as well make a post on the forum or something. You know I have been supporting you guys since the first Kickstarter and I wish to support you more. But this is just so you know there is a bunch of frustration from my side. I can't speak for others though."
visualnovels,39tka8,Docoda,17,Sun Jun 14 20:58:18 2015 UTC,Well Sekai is as business. They need to make sure they have a steady flow of capital to insure that they can bring the JP VN scene to the west. The VN market is still so small with the percentage who actually buy stuff even smaller that saturation is the only viable option. Why do you think MangaGamer release so many nukige? If Sekai can get 2-3 big licenses for every 10+ other things I'd be pretty happy. At least we're getting those licenses.

visualnovels,39tdyc,superange128,6,Sun Jun 14 16:19:47 2015 UTC,"Such a great VN. Certainly a favorite. I went into Hoshizora pretty neutral, not prejudiced any way in particular (which is unusual for me, I often read a little bit about VNs before I begin them), and was so happy with the experience. I don't know what it is exactly about the art style, but it's so incredibly beautiful. Great music, great characters, I can't wait to see what ratings come out of this."
visualnovels,39tdyc,Daruc,2,Sun Jun 14 19:40:42 2015 UTC,"Its one of my favs despite it not being particularly special in terms of execution compared to other typical high school slice of life romance VNs  All the stock archetypes are there but are done a bit better than usual, the MC is a lot more likable than the  average MC (without having over the top super powers)  The stargazing theme was cool  Has one of my fav true routes  Pretty much every route was at least decent/good in their own way  Only thing was that some of the humor wasnt particularly funny"
visualnovels,39tdyc,Daruc,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:59:15 2015 UTC,"the MC is a lot more likable than the average MC    This is a big thing for me. I know that some people like to project themselves onto the protagonist in VNs (or just about any fiction, really), and I can relate, but when the protagonist is written with that specifically in mind I feel it very often ends up incredibly bland and boring. Give me an interesting protagonist with character over a your-name-here stand-in any day. HnM's not exactly a stellar example of protagonist uniqueness, but You stands out enough for me.  That sort of thing is actually why I'm really excited for your Wanko to Kurasou topic coming up. Loved the protagonist in that.   Only thing was that some of the humor wasnt particularly funny   I was in tears every time  came up."

She's just a bitch the whole time without really anything redeeming. Doesn't even get tolerable until late in her route. Even the romance was meh.  Chinami. God she was so annoying. I had to turn off sound. Even the ""romance"" aspect was just wrong.  Now you'd think it wasn't enjoyable, but Komomo was great. While the tsundere she did warm up and get cute. With a mix of supernatural and such thrown in.   Kosame wasn't bad but her story just felt like an extension.   I didn't mind the mystery girl, but her route got kinda boring.  Didn't care for Mare as well little kids are not for me."

Not too surprised with Amane and Yoru doing better than everyone else though.   You - Eh kinda dull like Aoi except for a few good comedic moments. Really not much to say about him quite honestly.   Asuho - Likable but her route was kinda disappointing as she really doesn't develop much, nor is her problem that engaging. She's pretty cute regardless.  Komomo- Her route was the best that I read outside of the spoiler. Lots of good development from her and she was pretty darn cute overall. Not many complaints for sure.  Kosame - Technically the most interesting girl in the game, but some of the moments with her were a tad too cheezy for me. Overall lots of fun and has the most chemistry with the main character if you ask me.  Isuzu - Lord...I hated this character. She's unlikable basically the entire game and her route was the worst in my eyes. Honestly I have nothing good to say about her. Her romance with you feels completely unnatural and during her route spoiler   Chinami - Funny or annoying depending on how you view her. She's basically the Makina of this visual novel...and yeah...that's about it.   Yootootooowoo - I didn't read her route. I got bored of the game after Chinami's so yeah.   Mare - Apparently doesn't get a real route in this game until eternal heart. Kinda lame because she's pretty likable and cute overall. If that's actually true then all I can say is the creators are seriously baka baka. Better than most loli characters for sure and had a lot of decent chemistry with you."

Here's an excerpt from the new eden* one:   MangaGamer delivers the English release of this 2009 title by minori to Steam. eden* is a kinetic novel (a story without choices or gameplay) about the last few people on a dying planet. Its most unique selling point compared to similar titles is its visual presentation: Instead of the waist-up character sprites positioned in front of static backgrounds that we are used to from most modern visual novels, it relies almost entirely on scene-by-scene custom images, each one carefully designed to take character positions and camera perspectives into account. This gives the experience a very cinematic feel, quite literally reminiscent of movies, compared to other titles of its kind. Most scenes also features blinking eyes and lip syncing with the Japanese voices, which makes it impressively lively.  Needless to say, the asset quality is excellent throughout, starting with the backgrounds ranging from the painterly to the borderline naturalistic. The same attention to detail extends to the characters who, despite the multitude of poses and perspectives, always appear consistent, unique, and alive. From what I can tell as someone who does not speak Japanese, the voices really fit well, and coupled with the competent sound design and the soundtrack by Tenmon (if you happen to enjoy Makoto Shinkai's movies: yes, that Tenmon), which expands a small number of recurring motifs into a gripping soundscape, this is an aural experience that you are unlikely to forget.  The story revolves around Warrant officer Ryou Haruna and his assignment to guard a remote research facility during the planet's final moments. A peculiar (but largely unspecified) astronomical phenomenon is going to wipe out all life on Earth, and humanity is putting the finishing touches on a centennial plan to migrate into space and search for a new home. One component of this plan are the felixes, genetically engineered superhumans whose intellect propels scientific progress far beyond its normal pace. However, there are dissenting voices claiming that humanity should face its ultimate fate head-on instead of trying to escape, so military protection is granted to essential actors within the plan – in particular to Sion, the supreme felix, mastermind behind the giant starships and humanity's savior.   Read more... and if you like it, feel free to check out my other visual novel reviews as well. I'm still considering a curator group that would help you find my reviews right on the store pages (and potentially replace some of the... less useful curators).

visualnovels,39q1x2,jfietkau,3,Sat Jun 13 17:46:17 2015 UTC,^ Getting the PLUS+MOSAIC from mangagamer also gives you a steam key but its $24.95 [actually $18.71 because its on sale on mangagamer.] but its also like an expansion pack so you probably wont miss much.

visualnovels,39q1x2,blind_guy23,2,Sat Jun 13 20:44:09 2015 UTC,"There are certain VNs that are great with H-content and then there's others where the H-content doesn't fit in with the theme/art style at all and ruins the atmosphere for lack of better term. I feel like this is the latter, but I haven't played it and this will determine whether I pick it up on steam or not.   Someone mind letting me know which of the two this VN would be?"
visualnovels,39q1x2,CharmExclusive,7,Sat Jun 13 21:00:31 2015 UTC,"I would say the H-content doesn't kill it at all. Like I said, they're just sidestories/what-ifs so it's not like there's a nice heart warming moment in the main story innterrupted by Ryo glazing Shion's face with his man-frosting. Think of them more as bonus stories to uh...see more of your favorite characters."
visualnovels,39q1x2,xelivous,8,Sat Jun 13 23:37:00 2015 UTC,IMO more VNs that have H content added in later should do this.  Better to have extra scenes after the story than to mess up the pacing and character development of the original story by adding in H scenes.

visualnovels,39qrjw,Harlequina,6,Sun Jun 14 07:28:55 2015 UTC,Couples with the most chemistry from what I've read.    Umineko  Steins Gate  Dangan Ronpa 2  White Album 2  Grisaia    Most visual novel romances don't really offer much chemistry because usually the heroine is doing all the work in making the relationships fun. Not always of course but yeah. Nothings even come close to the top 4 in my eyes though (I literally laughed at almost every scene #3 had together). I won't be nominating personally but it'll be interesting to see who people think are the best couples here.
visualnovels,39qrjw,hyperknees91,2,Sun Jun 14 00:06:54 2015 UTC,Really? Why?
visualnovels,39qrjw,DontJudgeMeMonkey,6,Sun Jun 14 07:20:51 2015 UTC,Well spoiler
visualnovels,39qrjw,hyperknees91,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:11:16 2015 UTC,"Ah. I guess that makes sense haha. At the same time, I disliked her the most, but I guess it was the most natural."
visualnovels,39qrjw,DontJudgeMeMonkey,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:10:52 2015 UTC,Yeah usually I hear people like Yumiko the least because she acts completely different than the other 4 (as they are more sociable and energetic). For the opposite reason people might also like Yumiko more than the other heroines because she's the only one who doesn't act silly constantly. For the kind of game Grisaia is I can see why she might not be as popular as the others are though.
visualnovels,39qrjw,hyperknees91,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:12:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not finished with it yet but I agree, I think Yumiko is the most interesting character currently. Makina, Chiruchiru and arguably Sachi seems like pure dripping comic relief and not much else. Somehow I prefer Sachi to the other two though."
visualnovels,39qrjw,GregerMoek,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:43:20 2015 UTC,Agree. I liked Yumiko but that whole thing felt more realistic. Just      easily drawn together. Nothing out of convenience. No back stories and in the end I think it was really mutual caring.
visualnovels,39qrjw,bonerjohnson,11,Sun Jun 14 18:14:49 2015 UTC,"I nominated Nick and Maya, even if it's a non-romantic couple - at least on screen ;). They are just so dedicated to each other and went through so much together, that it actually hurt to not see them together later on in AA4 and AA5."
visualnovels,39qrjw,8cccc9,3,Mon Jun 15 10:48:38 2015 UTC,Ah man Maya's not in 4 and 5? I've only read 1 but that seems like a bit of a bummer. Guess they want to keep everything implied or just plain teased in that series though.
visualnovels,39qrjw,hyperknees91,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:52:34 2015 UTC,"They went another direction after the original trilogy and part 4 is also settled a few years after part 3, so I guess they didn't want to draw new sprites for AJ. But AJ was generally not the bee's knees and I would have preferred it if even Nick didn't make an appearance, but alas.   Guess they want to keep everything implied or just plain teased in that series though.   I'm not sure about that, but there are still references in 4 and 5, so she's not dead."
visualnovels,39qrjw,8cccc9,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:54:51 2015 UTC,"Well I meant perhaps Pheonix Wright is one of those series where they would only ever hint at the romance, but never actually confirm it or have the characters confess their feelings (like a lot of shounen shows)."
visualnovels,39qrjw,hyperknees91,1 point,Sun Jun 14 08:31:56 2015 UTC,"I'd honestly say there really is not even any romantic tension between Nick and Maya. The character I mentioned is the only one that has actually had any real romance and that's because she's Phoenix's ex-girlfriend from his backstory, and there is a whole bunch of stuff going on with that. But since they AJ distanced itself from the rest of the series, and DD only had appearances from the most core of the previous cast, it's doubtful she will ever make another appearance."
visualnovels,39qrjw,ctom42,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:42:40 2015 UTC,Well from the game I played it seemed like they were just good friends for the time being. I don't know if that changes over the course of the games though. Regardless I would miss her just because I like her as a character rather than any romantic reasons.
visualnovels,39qrjw,hyperknees91,4,Mon Jun 15 14:56:25 2015 UTC,Nick and Iris are a much better couple
visualnovels,39qrjw,ctom42,3,Mon Jun 15 15:14:03 2015 UTC,"I knew you would show up ;).  I'm not arguing about OTP and Iris really seems to be the better match for Nick in a romantic sense. He was madly in love, as one wouldn't otherwise AA3 case 1. They generally had a good chemistry, but I can't say how much of it was due to AA3 case 5, so I guess it was real.  Even if Nick and Maya aren't in a romantic relationship, they don't really need to be. Maya stays with Nick because she wants to, not because she doesn't have any other options. And the trust and importance they place in each other over the course of the trilogy is phenomenal. Just look at 2-2, 2-4 and 3-5 to name the obvious ones. A bit more hidden instances are 1-5 where AA1 case 5. Or case 3-2 where AA3 case 2."

Doesn't have to be good/healthy development (Krauss/Natsuhi being an example of interesting development that isn't always healthy). Have really fun dialogue Most are canon but some are potential for canon or canon in some universe Somewhat of a preference towards childhood friend romance since these seem to happen more often canonically in VNs than in anime   I hope one of these win.

visualnovels,39qrjw,bigfatround0,5,Sat Jun 13 21:45:56 2015 UTC,They certainly are /r/visualnovels' best couple. This gets my vote.

visualnovels,39qrjw,JustiniZHere,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:14:43 2015 UTC,Man as much as I like Miyako I'd nominate Chris as my Majikoi choice. Chris and Yamato had a cute thing going. While most of the other girls would seemingly be friend zoning.
visualnovels,39qrjw,bloodmuffin454,2,Sat Jun 13 21:59:54 2015 UTC,This is probably my second fav majikoi couple after Miyako

visualnovels,39qrjw,bloodmuffin454,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:50:18 2015 UTC,I'll ship Little Busters as canon until the day I die.
visualnovels,39qrjw,FinalNwo,4,Sun Jun 14 13:05:03 2015 UTC,You know spoiler tags don't help unless you put the VN name in the spoiler title so people know if they can check it or not. Also not sure why you would put a spoiler tag over a couple that has a route.
visualnovels,39qrjw,FinalNwo,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:58:41 2015 UTC,Saw other people had it spoilered so I edited it to match. Wanted to err on the side of caution.
visualnovels,39qrjw,The_Dran,2,Tue Jun 16 10:28:54 2015 UTC,"...and why exactly are non-canon couples allowed? When the couple doesn't exist in respective VNs or fandisks, it doesn't exist. Headcanons aren't relevant to anything, in my opinion. They're just wishful thinking of salty people who didn't get what they wanted."
visualnovels,39qrjw,Cornetto_Man,4,Wed Jun 17 21:35:49 2015 UTC,"Why are they allowed? Because this contest, just like the Best Guy and the Best Girl contest, is not intended to be completely serious. It's all for fun.   It's pretty much like /u/Cornetto_Man said here, just a tad more lenient:   completely ridiculous ones like say Takeru and one of the Maids shouldn't be allowed but there should be some leniency in cases like this.   In the context of this contest ""canon"" means any two people in a visual novel who are in a romantic and/or sexual relationship. And ""non-canon"" means two people in a visual novel who are not explicitly in a romantic and/or sexual relationship, but it's not out the realm of possibility that they could be.   Allowing non-canon couples (while still not allowing completely ridiculous couples) makes it more fun."
visualnovels,39qrjw,FinalNwo,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:39:48 2015 UTC,"Hm, makes sense. But for VNs, I think there should be a different approach. When there is a potential romance, a route is made 9/10 times. The authors know who can fit as a romantic interest. For anime or other medium where there is only one romance but multiple potential romances, this could be applied, because the premise is there.  This is just my take on non-canon ships. I do have some, too, but I'd never nominate them in an actual couple contest.  I guess I can quote myself from my conversation with Cornetto:   I'll just not vote for it then."
visualnovels,39qrjw,Cornetto_Man,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:22:58 2015 UTC,"I think there are certain ones where they don't get a route, for whatever reason. Yumizuka/Shiki in Tsukihime, for example. Her route was cut out due to lack of resources, if I recall correctly, and in the final release it's strongly implied that Yumizuka's affection towards Shiki can only ever be one-sided.  But even given that, I think that pairing still deserves a place in the contest. In our head-canon we can all imagine what a cute couple they would have made."
visualnovels,39qrjw,FinalNwo,3,Sun Jun 14 10:31:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with you in regards to headcannon being irrelevant. Though I took that non-cannon couples being allowed meant that, say there's a VN with multiple routes but one is considered cannon. Like Kira Kira for example. But in that case the ""non-cannon"" couples are still valid entries."
visualnovels,39qrjw,ctom42,3,Sun Jun 14 21:52:09 2015 UTC,"If certain routes are canon, it doesn't make other romances non-canon, in my opinion. See, what I mean is that canon couples are any couples that exist in the VN. Couple =/= route. True route =/= only canon romance. Canon = everything in the VN. There would be no reason for different routes if they would be canon somehow."
visualnovels,39qrjw,hyperknees91,3,Sat Jun 13 22:47:18 2015 UTC,Oh now I get you. I agree that completely ridiculous ones like say Takeru and one of the Maids shouldn't be allowed but there should be some leniency in cases like this.

visualnovels,39qwng,dovac,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:14:37 2015 UTC,"I use some of the reallivemax tools for messing with audio and graphic files, but for the script, I already have a foothold in RLDev. The SDK is hard to get into because all the documentation is in Japanese, and while translating the small documents on individual tools is easy enough, doing the whole thing, and then describing their uses, would be a pain. ^^;  I think that the sdk doesn't get enough mention though, a lot of people don't know it even exists. Might be worth going through one day."

If not, I wouldn't recommend it to you; to me, it was a huge waste of time that constantly had me waiting for something interesting to happen."
visualnovels,39pnys,LeafCascade,2,Sat Jun 13 15:28:00 2015 UTC,Completely agree. And even as a pure SOL it was pretty boring. I can't say I enjoyed it at all.

visualnovels,39pnys,QWERTY__Finger,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:32:14 2015 UTC,"The art and music is good enough to keep me reading though.   Yeah, it's an aesthetically appealing game, I'll give them that. By the way, don't expect much from the routes either, I did that and it didn't turn out very well."
visualnovels,39pnys,LeafCascade,0,Sat Jun 13 15:36:49 2015 UTC,I liked Asa and Yoru's routes as their relationship was pretty interesting with Yoru being a genius and Asa being just a normal person. Plus they were adorable. And  of course.
visualnovels,39pnys,Cornetto_Man,2,Sat Jun 13 15:44:21 2015 UTC,"999 Characters dialogue is written really well at the very least. I guess more development needed to be given to them though. The game was very much more about story and atmosphere though so it's alright.   Aoi - So dull so very very dull. The only moments I found him amusing is when he is kind of doukan about romance. Also he gets absurdly cheesy at times which really doesn't fit the games tone if you ask me.   Kotori - Lord I could not like this character and man do I wish she wasn't the main heroine. Her route only further proved this because she acted like a little princess who Aoi had to save. Funny enough most reviews I read of this game said she was the most interesting...which is probably just because more emphasis is given on her. Her voice actress not being great doesn't help things either.  Amane - At first she was my favorite, but then I read her route which really dampened my impression on her. She's the strange quirky character of the game and at first I thought she was suppose to be the main girl. Regardless I was pretty disappointed with her overall. She takes too long to develop and when it does happen, it's too fast to really take in. Though I will admit the way her romance was done and how doukan she was about it was really funny.  Ageha - I really do think the approach to her character was pretty interesting. She wasn't just the typical childhood friend character, but her route also was probably a tad too strange in its approach. Regardless I think they did a fairly good job with her character and making her unique.   Asa - Like Yoru a huge shame they took so long to actually incorporate this character into the main cast. Very cute overall if a tad dull. Really would have enjoyed this game more if her and Yoru played a bigger part in it.   Yoru - My fave and I have no complaints with how her character is done. Her route is wish fulfillment incarnate which I really did not expect for this kind of game. Regardless she's a whole lot of fun and the one time the game actually gave me feels was when spoiler. I basically forgive most of the game thanks to Yoru."
visualnovels,39qdlw,Grifkilla51,3,Sat Jun 13 19:02:09 2015 UTC,"Well. I am personally just not the right player for this game, at all. But I commend you for making something way different than what's out there, and I wish you the best of luck with your campaign."
