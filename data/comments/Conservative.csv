Hell, even my extremist liberal friends who work/volunteer at Planned Parenthood would quit and never donate again if this were undeniably true.  Just a quick message to one of them showed me that their viewpoint isn't that it's okay to murder human beings, they're not actively fighting against it because they believe that the costs discussed in the video were reimbursement for the work they did to prep and transfer the now aborted fetus. They aren't paying for the tissue, but rather the time the staff has to put in for the research company they are donating the fetus to.  If that is not true then that fact needs to be made well known. If they do not react after that THEN you can say that they are advocating for the sale of human tissue.  I really don't want to argue the morality of abortion since it just comes down to a difference of opinion, so I would really appreciate if you didn't take the conversation there.

One can argue that plan parent hood is not involved with transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control of the tissue.  They may have some storage costs.

Trade in bodies, which is a different legal thing has been legal at various times and in various places as far back as Galen. But it has never been popular. As someone said up thread supply tends to meet demand, creating a market for bodies.   Eg/ body snatchers and grave robbers, dissection or vivisection of criminals from antiquity to the premodern era.   Just a side anecdote.  Before the outlawing of body trade in the latter twentieth century, my university acquired a large collection of medical specimens. Some from around the same time period and the same geographic location were almost certainly killed for their skeletons to study. But they were over 100 years old and from the far east.   We will see how the racial component plays out. Knowing PP serves mainly black women, I am doubly horrified to see how the black market body trade, especially of minorities not something from the past but is very much thriving in the postmodern era."

Even if not inherently immoral, selling human flesh encourages practices and procedures that create supply to meet demand, i.e. at least some people will die that would not have otherwise. Planned Parenthood proclaims to be a place offering women options, but where there is a clear financial incentive for them to encourage abortions over adoptions or parenthood, there is a strong presumption of bias. If a lawyer or therapist were practicing with even a fraction of the level of bias demonstrated here we would revoke their licenses and punish them for unethical behavior."

In the event of the death of other officials or foreign dignitaries, the flag is to be displayed at half-staff according to Presidential instructions or orders, or in accordance with recognized customs or practices not inconsistent with law. In the event of the death of a present or former official of the government of any State, territory, or possession of the United States, the Governor of that State, territory, or possession may proclaim that the National flag shall be flown at half-staff.

It's a known fact that the Obama administration supported the 'rebels' against Gaddafi in Libya, and the 'rebels' against Assad in Syria. They weren't 'freedom fighters' or 'rebels'. They were radical Islamist Jihadists. Those very same groups morphed into ISIS & other Jihadist terrorist groups.   It's a known fact that Obama has been openly hostile towards Israel from day one - going so far as to interfere in Israeli elections earlier this year. Lotta good it did Obama. His team lost anyway.   It's a fact that the Obama administration has openly supported the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, a known radical Islamist terrorist organization.   Obama has refused to use the words 'Islamic terrorism' and call it what it is.  Obama was conspicuously absent in Paris after the Charlie Hedbo terrorist attack. The Obama administration's statement on the attack (yeah - let's kill people over a fucking cartoon!) was to condemn the attack with some pretty words, but not before accusing CH of going too far and questioning their judgement.   That's not leadership.   Obama just gave the Iranians the tools that they need to continue funding Jihadists across the globe, and maybe come up with some nukes, too.

I wish feminist could start focusing on how women might be responsible for their own situations. Approach that topic. There is nothing wrong with wanting kids, but if you stay home to raise them for 10 years, don't expect to rejoin the working class at the same salary as a person who has been working steadily. If a man drops out of the work life for 10 years and has a significant higher salary than a woman, that's a problem. If you're comparing women out of the work environment for 10 years to men who have been participating, wtf do you expect?

The exact number is hard to pinpoint, but let's just say the cause had overwhelming popular support (over 60% if I recall correctly). Now, of course, support for polygamy could possibly reach 60% at some point in time, but let's be reasonable: it's just not going to happen. Considering that there is currently not a single representative, senator, governor who would defend polygamy, it's hard to see it legalized within the next few decades. Since it'll have been so long since Obergeffel v. Hodges, can we really put the blame on it?   I don't see how it's disingenuous. Do you mean far fetched? For any Muslims that believe every nation should use sharia law, then yea. They would. Their push for sharia law would be a push for legalized polygamy by proxy.   Sorry, I didn't finish my sentence: I meant that it's disingenuous to say that Muslims could possibly succeed at changing the law when it comes to polygamy. There are simply not enough of them to make any difference in this particular issue.   I actually looked at a poll on moral acceptability: you can look at here. I was actually surprised to see polygamy at 14% (I thought it would be closer to 5, to be honest), but that's still considered ''highly unacceptable''. Even if we were to believe that acceptance for polygamy can follow the same extraordinary path as acceptance for same-sex marriage, it would still most probably take about 30 years to get it legalized (gay marriage in 1996: 27%, polygamy now: 14%). Don't you think it would be a little bit far-fetched to sugest, 30 year from now, that Obergeffel v. Hodges changed everything and led to the legalization of polygamy?   Listen, I am not saying I know for sure. All I'm saying is that the ideas expressed in the article were good, I agree with them. But he nor I are saying this is going to absolutely 100% happen and it will be because of the passing of gay marriage.

Fair enough, that's a balanced opinion. Thing is, I also can't be 100% sure of what I'm saying, but I'm fairly certain that if polygamy is to be legalized (which I doubt, but for the sake of the argument, let's say it is) in the next 15 years, it will not be caused by any legal ramifications (precedent) of this decsion, but rather by a complete shift in public perception, in a transformation of morality in the US."

Additionally, yes older generations do not support polygamists due to religious beliefs, but also there are several more laws holding polygamists back from attaining marriage rights, such as divorce laws and the tax code.

'Rights' (if we choose to call marriage a right) are not denied because the laws haven't yet been set in stone. In fact, laws are never permanent - seeing as how they can be altered. This is a temporary issue, at most.  Also, polygamist mormons are not the full summation of all polygamists in the US. And either way this discussion is not about mormons. It's about how polygamy will exist within a legal system."

The Supreme Court ruling that just happened would have been a non starter just 10 years ago not to mention the 40-50 the author posed when talking about polygamy. And there are still people today (that are completely decent non-bigoted people btw) that believe same sex marriage is unnatural and potentially damaging to society just as there was 10-20, 50 years ago.   Do I believe that it's potentially harmful to society? No.  Do I believe it's unnatural. Yea I do.

Anyways, marriage is not a line. It, like nearly every other aspect of life, has far more than two dimensions to it. It isn't solely heterosexual one day, then gays are allowed to marry, and then all of a sudden it's time for polygamy and bestiality and the end of the world. Besides, the only place homosexuality is unnatural and potentially dangerous is in the bible. Animals and humans practiced it long before marriage or religion came around and said it was wrong. Besides, I haven't seen the country implode yet. Granted it rained kind of hard on the 26th, but that was about it."

The author wasn't saying he could say for sure. He was just arguing based on the slippery slope concept. I don't understand why people think this slippery slope idea exists with everything else except this one specific issue. Baffles my mind.

If you think anything is that simple then you should probably look at it a little harder. Gays make up maybe 5% of the population, whereas those who would benefit from bestiality or incest or sex dolls (really?) Are virtually nonexistent. Gay marriage has been legal in other countries for years, they don't seem to be falling apart or exhibiting any of the problems proponents of the slippery slope argument would lead you to believe. When there are real world examples of why a theory is wrong, it generally helps to maybe pay attention to that than continuing along rationalizing the poor theory."

Liberals have been using past court cases to argue their agenda for DECADES. Lawyers use past court cases to prepare their arguments. How would you not think that people could do the same thing decades down the road.   The slippery slope happened with healthcare (not complete still in the works. Goal is government pays for all) work requirements with welfare, political correctness, Americas debt issue. Most every issue conservatives deal with. Except this one. This is the one that can't succumb to the slippery slope issue. Everyone knows that the constitution was written in an attempt to prevent government tyranny by way of slippery slope. The forefathers have argued about this (the concept of a slippery slope) years before and after the official start of our nation. Others have warned everyone else about it for decades after. Ayn Rand warned us in her writings because that's how The Soviet Union came to be. Why is same sex marriage the ONLY issue that will not slide down that slope?"

Based on the other words in the sentence, you should be able to give somebody the benefit of the doubt by inferring that he actually means, ""a natural right is never something that costs another person a penny.""  I think it would be more useful to show how it is that you can both be correct in this case, due to the fact that ""right"" is used in multiple senses. Natural rights in essence exist only as negative obligations on other people, and therefore it would be true to say that they never cost another person a penny. On the other hand, civil rights are the rights granted to you as a citizen of a country to help protect your natural rights. This is the sense in which it would be true to say that rights cost money for things like trials and elections.  I think John P.

Conservative,3dy5yf,JackBond1234,-16,Mon Jul 20 16:17:11 2015 UTC,"It's the slippery slope fallacy, right to healthcare and education? = you're cattle in a barn.  When the opposite of that is not having those ""rights"" and being forced into debt if you want an education or healthcare. IMO I'd rather be a ""cattle in the barn"" than a slave to debt. That shit'll ruin your life."
Conservative,3dy5yf,TYLER3LYT,30,Mon Jul 20 16:22:19 2015 UTC,"The difference is that between a right and an entitlement. While there may be dictionaries that disagree, it's an important distinction if you want to have a useful discourse on the subject of rights. A right is a liberty that you have whose exercise is not restricted. Requiring other people to give you something is not a right, it's an entitlement. You have a right to go out and get an education. You do not have a right for someone else to be required to give you that education. Public school is better labeled an entitlement and not a right. You have a right to seek out healthcare of your own choice. You do not have a right for someone else to give you care or treatment, though in some situations you may be entitled to such.  Entitlements are not altogether a bad thing. Some are good. Where you draw the line on which entitlements should be allowed and can be afforded is a subject for debate and reasonable people can reach a conclusion on that. Personally, I believe that public education is a fair entitlement to give people. (Though I might have my own opinions about what level at which it's paid for and who should decide the standards.) Most people, in fact, agree that public school is a fair entitlement. That doesn't make it a right by a fair definition of the word.  Conflating ""rights"" with ""entitlements"" is an emotional use of language. You have a right to speak, assemble, and pray. You have a right to privacy and to protect yourself. You have a right to not be searched without a warrant. But to call ""free healthcare"", ""free college"", food stamps a ""right"" is just an attempt to redefine the word to convince people that forcing another person to feed, teach, or treat you is as sacred as your right to speak.   If you want to argue that those things should be entitlements, then make your case. But if you want to call them ""rights"" then you've already started your argument with a false premise and you should be duly ignored from the start.  Interestingly, those ""rights"" often come with restrictions that hinder your liberty. Your ""right"" to healthcare may mean that you can no longer choose your doctor or seek treatment at your own expense that you might need to live. Your ""right"" free education may mean that you can't choose your own college anymore or choose your own profession. In such case, your mislabeled entitlements actually reduce the sum of your rights and liberty. That may be ok with you, but at least call it what it is."
Conservative,3dy5yf,JackBond1234,17,Mon Jul 20 16:41:25 2015 UTC,It isn't a slippery slope fallacy. It's an analogy.
Conservative,3dy5yf,Ponycar_Driver,10,Mon Jul 20 16:30:41 2015 UTC,"Making it a ""right"" means it must be provided. When the government provides things, rarely if ever does a viable private sector competitor remain. The more government provided ""rights"" you rely on, the more the analogy fits. You no longer work for yourself. You become a labor force for the government who rewards you with ""rights"" and sustenance.  This debt thing you speak of does not occur in a free society. The government has helped make capitalism chug because it's being suppressed by socialist policies. The more of these policies we take on, the harder it is to rely on capitalist principles simultaneously.  By the way do not talk about commodities as if they were rights. Rights are inalienable and cost nothing. Commodities can be provided as entitlements by the government, I.e housing, healthcare, and marriage recognition. Do not confuse these."

I'm sure outside groups lobby to change things in the DSM, but there are a lot of groups lobbying for different things (look at fucking Tumblr and all their horseshit).

Back in the 1970s homosexuality was removed under suspicious circumstances.  Now I'm not saying that homosexuality is a mental disorder.  There appears to be nothing pathological about it to me.  I'm just trying to ascertain if these decisions are based on science and reason or politics and pressure.
Conservative,3dyehg,CherryCokeNixon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:59 2015 UTC,"Well, things change over time with new research. More people are being diagnosed with various forms of autism because the definition has widened and typically they would have been diagnosed as mentally retarded or some variation. Same goes for PTSD.  In regards to homosexuality, that was removed as a mental illness because researchers couldn't find any impairments. Most researchers and clinicians believe homosexuality has a primary genetic or hormonal component. It's actually an interesting field of research.  Now, I'm not going to say that the APA is free of influence from movements and groups, but typically their decisions are grounded in empirical research. If they change something to placate a group, there is going to be a pushback from the professional community because it's detrimental to change diagnostic criteria to placate."

Those ladies don't cotton to this kind of bs and had a lot to say about this particular story. I don't agree with them about much politically, but most seem to be very in favor of gun rights for women and very astute when it comes to this transgender issue and how it impacts biological women.   I posted this story over there a few days ago and they had basically the same reaction as people on /r/conservative did. One of my favorite replies to this story from /r/Gender_Critical:  https://www.np.reddit.com/r/Gender_Critical/comments/3domgy/transgender_reporter_to_ben_shapiro_you_keep/   The narcissism and insecurity of the typical MtT, especially of the autogynephile variety, is shown clearly by Tur's overreaction here. If Tur was secure and sure of his trans identity, then he'd just let comments like this roll down his back, as such comments are common and come with the territory when trans. Tur wouldn't care what someone like Shapiro thought and wouldn't need the constant reassurance of ""really being a woman"" from all and sundry if he felt secure. Shapiro hit a nerve...and very astutely, too, in my opinion."

Ben Shapiro files police report against trans woman Zoey Tur for her response to his deliberate provocations   On the program, Shapiro continually insulted the transgender community by refusing to refer to Caitlyn Jenner with her preferred pronoun, then deliberately provoking Tur, asking her “What are your genetics, sir?”  Tur was clearly in the wrong to threaten Shapiro — though whether her words and endorsement of a tweet amount to battery are a matter for the Los Angeles Police Department to decide — but Shapiro and his adoring fans utterly ignore Shapiro’s complicity in creating the hostile environment in which the threat was uttered.   So, according to the left, if you are provocative then you deserve violence. I suppose it doesn't matter if your words are provocative or if it's your style of dress. I wonder if Salon thinks people should be raped if their clothes are provocative or if they flirt too much?"

This person has a mental illness if he thinks it's appropriate to think he's a wolf and act like a wolf. This person has a delusion where he believes he is something he is clearly not. Sure, he identifies as a wolf, but he's a fucking human being. There are many people in mental institutions who identify as famous people, Napoleon seems to be popular.   What is the difference between these people who are clearly mentally ill and someone who identifies as the opposite sex? In both instances, they are people who think they are something they are not. Why do we institutionalize and make fun of one but glorify and praise the other? Why is it courageous for Bruce Jenner to put on make up, have surgery that inverts his penis and put on a dress but it's laughable that some other person fucking growled and snarled at a customer because he thought he was a wolf?

Shapiro is just as innocent and blameless as other victims of abuse and bullying.  Sex is binary. It is black and white. Shapiro is talking about biological sex. He/she pronouns are descriptors of sex. Tur is a ""sir."" If Tur was deluded into thinking he was Julius Caesar, should he be able to threaten Shapiro for not calling him ""Caesar"" or ""your highness""? I'm sure Jenner and Tur think they're women despite being men.

Why are you stating something that we already know, and the vast majority of people accept as fact? The ""Black Lives Matter"" protestors are simply trying to inflame racial tensions to get what they want - to say that our society does not value the life of a black man is ridiculous.

All lives matter - this should be their message. I have never understood what they intend to do by stoking racial tension (fighting fire with fire, I guess?)  On another note, blacks kill WAY more blacks than whites do (source) so why isn't that what these protestors focus on? The answer is that they are unwilling to admit to themselves that the reason that many blacks are not advancing in society is because they blame the system and society in general for their own shortcomings (Michael Brown would never have been killed if he had not robbed a store then disobeyed an officer's warnings...).  If that sounds racist / insensitive to you, I don't care. I'm tired of people beating around the bush just to be politically correct.

The only question is if he is sincere in his beliefs, or if he is simply selling himself to his base. The fact that he knows his base so well is pretty refreshing, though."

This is an incredibly important election.  There will be at least one, possibly two Supreme Court justices retiring.  Obama's immigration and healthcare policies will be even more difficult to change 6-10 years from now.

My reasoning being: his record as Florida governor was not only conservative, but it was also quite successful (from a more objective standpoint, like in terms of economic growth). In addition, I feel as though he is very level-headed and more pragmatic than some others.   Hillary, on the other hand, is just god-awful. She will literally say ANYTHING she needs to in order to get elected. The most frustrating thing is, she refuses to make some of her political positions clear so that she can flip-flop later and pretend like she didn't.

Conservative,3dwrhf,nicklausj123,5,Mon Jul 20 20:37:48 2015 UTC,"If I may, most conservatives pay attention to the platform. While Jeb did govern Florida in a very conservative manner, he is Pro-Common Core, Pro-Amnesty, and is cool with compromising on taxes if spending is reduced. The first two are social issues conservatives, by and large, oppose. There's also the fact that he is another Bush. After the last one, is it really believable that another one is our only shot at the White House? The Bushes are our Clintons so to speak. Lastly, Jeb is seen as a moderate/establishment guy. A lot of conservatives were let down in 2012 when establishment Romney lost. We feel that running a true conservative like Paul, Walker, or Cruz would be better. After all Reagan ran as a hard conservative and won big.   A few months back I made and posted a slideshow on all the candidates and their stances on certain issues. According to ontheissues.org (which I used as a major source), only two candidates were not labeled as ""hard core conservatives"" by their scale: Rand Paul (Libertarian) and Chris Christie (Moderate).

The Democrat Party absolutely loves him. He's done everything the liberal agenda has set out to do and then some. I understand you wanting to write him off but it's the absolute most dangerous thing we can do. John Kerry, Al Gore, and a myriad of other candidates that we have no clue about can still run.

General public = GP. The subject is the figure like Bernie Sanders.   Subject organizes group to pose as or infiltrate PC (this case random Reddit users).  The PC engages the GP as propaganda machines. They act as though they are independent of the subject. They follow Alinsky tactics and demonize opponents. Mock them. They make it seem like anyone disagreeing with the subject are denying the sky is blue. Over time, the GP becomes afraid to resist the PC claims. It is a situation like ""The Emperor's New Clothes.""  In an effort to appear knowledgeable/cool/correct the GP accept and espouse the views of the PC, and subject. It becomes a situation of, ""See! I'm one of the in-crowd too!"" They then promulgate the PC's topics (Facebook, Twitter, Reddit) effectively becoming propaganda machines but even worse, they ""believe"" their claims. It becomes part of their identity, and not just for a check as it was for the PC.

He is much more moderate than they would have liked.

Most Americans simply didn't realise that fœtuses are human beings (heck, IIRC the Southern Baptists supported it back then). Opposition to abortion was lumped in with opposition to contraception.  As a result of Roe v. Wade, the pro-life movement was forced to examine its philosophical, legal and ethical arguments, and it is (slowly, but surely) persuading the nation.  Likewise, I hope that Obergefell v. Hodges will lead the pro-marriage movement to re-examine what marriage actually is, and restore healthy marriage & sexual cultures in this country.  After all, homosexual pseudo-marriage wouldn't even make sense had heterosexuals not destroyed marriage and chastity already.

Conservative,3dw6hf,yugtahtmi,3,Mon Jul 20 09:15:58 2015 UTC,"It's not discrimination when they are entitled to the exact type of marriage as literally everyone else. Gay people can enter into heterosexual marriages just like everyone else and straight people, like gay people, cannot enter into homosexual marriages . Nowhere are we legally guaranteed happiness with the choices that are presented. If a state wants to change the types of marriages they recognize then that's fine, but I see no constitutional reason to have to. The only way this would be unconstitutional is if gay man was not allowed to marry a gay woman when everyone else can have a heterosexual marriage.  I understand this is a controversial opinion but it really is the only way to accurately analyze and interpret the scenario and the constitution in my opinion."

You say that gay people have the right to marriage, but to a woman not a man.  You do realize, i hope, that way of thinking is discriminatory.

The ‘Hadith’ literature, which are considered by Muslims to be the most trustworthy sources on Muhammad’s life, contain accounts of Muhammad having those who mocked him killed. And Muslims are to emulate Muhammad. The Qur’an says that it is the destiny of Islam to rule over all others, (Sura 48:28). There are between 50 - 60 Muslim countries, of which 80% persecute non-Muslims, (Open Doors statistics). In the traditional Islamic view there are considered to be 2 regions of the world, Dar al-Islam (Region under Islamic rule) and Dar al-Harb (Region of War). In areas of Islamic rule, non-Muslims are given 3 choices, to convert, fight or surrender to Islamic rule. So, the behavior we are witnessing may be fundamental, as it has always existed in Islam, but it is not radical or extreme."

Lol: elaborate on which Hadith and the context    In areas of Islamic rule, non-Muslims are given 3 choices, to convert, fight or surrender to Islamic rule.    Um.is it people that give that rule or the Quran?  Before you answer, think about why Muhammad when he first returned to Mecca allowed people of other religions to maintain theirs   So, the behavior we are witnessing may be fundamental, as it has always existed in Islam, but it is not radical or extreme.

The main difference is for Christians, some have used the scriptures to justify a sin. With Muslims, you have to ignore quite a lot of the Quran and the Hadith to not be militaristic. This is because Islam isn't just a religion, it's also a government. If Islam was to disavow itself as a government with the power to kill, conquer and destroy then it would be like Christianity."

That covers many of the programs that you are probably thinking of, but also the largest (or 2nd largest, it swaps with unemployment benefits depending on the economy) chunk of that is the child tax credit, which you are (i'm assuming) at least partially in favor of.   Yes, it is non-zero, and there are big issues with fraud and dependencies and what not that need to be addressed, but if you really want to see that cut the government take of your pay stub shrink, it is going to take a LOT more than addressing the ""lazy, dumb people."""

I think they would agree that your tax rate is too high but they would see that as a problem of the corporations and large earners not paying their proper share of the pie and thus forcing everyone's taxes up.

For federal at that amount you're at 28%. Which comes to 33% total.  So it does actually work out if her residency pay is around $60k and his pre-MBA NYC salary is at $100k.

You've played the game, according to the system, in order to set yourself up for success.  I respect that tremedously. Here's the problem, as I view it, you've been conditioned to think that you are different then those you condemn for being lazy and stupid.  The truth of the matter is, you're middle class.  That sounds crazy, right?  Doctors and the such being middle class, when historically they held a higher level of class imo.  So, if your middle class now, what happened to the middle class?  They've been systematically over time squeezed down into the poor.  I don't believe it's fair that you will pay 33% of your income to taxes, but you shouldn't be looking down rather you should be looking up.  The incredibly wealthy in this country have positioned themselves perfectly.  You'll hear from people like Warren Buffet who openly admits that his effective tax rate is like 15% and his secretary pay more.  Romney I think pays like 13% he said at one point.

Second off, you can't always just look up and blame the people who are doing better than you. They got there by working hard, and doing the things they needed to do, making good financial choices, making contributions to society through the services and products they provided. Wether you like it or not, their wealth does indicate the fact that something they did benefitted other people, or no one would have paid for their services.  Now, lots of ""rich"" peoples taxes are low because, get this, they are smarter than you. They spent their money on charities and other philanthropic causes because they are what is called tax deductible. That means they don't have to give all their money to big brother.   At the same time the top few percent of earners pay a very large portion of taxes, while the bottom 50% pays very little to nothing. And 15% of Romney's income is probably a lot larger amount of money than if the government took every last dime you had. Which they don't by the way, I doubt you can afford to pay much in the way of taxes since you seem like a good little societal leech.   People at the top earned their way there. An yeah, that does make them better than a lot of people on the bottom. Not all. But a lot. Choosing to save money for the long term instead of blowing it all away put them ahead. Choosing to work extra hours so they could pay for college, and financial planning over the long term to achieve a goal put them ahead. Studying instead of smoking pot and getting sloshed put them ahead. Producing results for their companies instead of redditting all day on company time put these people ahead. Sacrificing time for additional education when most people want to work so that they can play, and delaying the beginning of life even further back puts these people ahead.   So don't come in here with your scheme to vilify the rich, especially when you know nothing about what it takes to be successful. It is insulting to everyone on this subreddit's intelligence to come in here and preach this shit. You are essentially saying that people cannot have the American dream of coming here, working their asses off and making their way to the top, because you want to give people who have achieved that dream's money to lazy SOBs so that they can feel good about themselves and continue to leech off of society.

Conservative,3dvbdp,CavalierPB,0,Mon Jul 20 15:41:31 2015 UTC,"In 1987, when I was on my own for the first time, I had a minimum wage crap job. Minimum wage was $3.35 an hour. Adjusted for inflation, today's federal minimum wage is a bit more than that.   I wasn't exactly living like Daddy Warbucks back then, but I had food, an apartment, a car, friends, and a life - and imagine, I had all that without any government assistance ever! Crazy, huh? I managed to pay all my own bills and everything - on a minimum $3.35 PH wage job.   I've come a very long way since then, and I do very well today. I've had close to 30 years to improve my station in life, and I did so drastically. I did so without ever going to college, even.   One can live on a minimum wage job. I did it. Please don't pretend that it isn't possible to support yourself frugally on minimum wage - and eat and have a place to live and 'participate in society' - whatever that means. Yeah, you'll be poor, but you will get by.  Minimum wage is a starting point for kids with their first jobs - not a lifestyle in your 30's. If you've been in the workforce for a year and you're still making minimum wage, you're either working for a shitty company, or you're a shitty employee. You, as an individual with free will, can choose to change either one of those things or both.   ""If you can't work your way up, you don't deserve to be paid more"" is kind of a harsh way of putting it, but employers (in the private sector at least) pay their employees based on productivity. If you come to work and put in the minimum amount of effort possible every day, call in sick at least twice a month, have a bad attitude, etc. - your employer will not value your work, just as you seemingly do not value your job. If you do exactly the opposite of that, your employer will value your work more. They will pay you more to keep you. They will promote you and pay you even more.   That's just reality. That's the way that the world works. Work hard, make smart life choices, work harder, save, make smart life choices, and save while working harder (it's not rocket surgery, folks - that's just 3 rules), and you will soon find your station in life change from that $3.35 per hour job, a crappy studio apartment, and a really crappy $400 van to being a successful business owner that does very well, a beautiful farm in the very nicest part of Tennessee, and very nice vehicles including a few restored classics.   That's a long way to come, and it took a very long time, but it's certainly possible to support yourself on minimum wage, and it's also possible to start there and work your way up the ladder. Most successful people started working for minimum wage at some point. That's where most people start.   Where one goes from there has everything to do with the choices that they make."

Who says having a minimum wage job prevents you from doing that (in most areas of the country - I won't address places like NYC where the cost of living is ridiculous)? If you get paid the current minimum wage of $7.25, don't work any overtime, and work 9 hours a day for 5 days a week, you're making about $1435 a month (assuming 22 work days per month). You can get a 1-room apartment for cheap if you look for it (a quick search around where I live found 1-bedrooms for $650 or less; the cheaper places probably aren't listed online so I'm sure you can find cheaper if you physically go and ask).   Don't buy a smartphone, don't pay for cable, shop at the cheapest places you can find and buy in bulk. You don't NEED internet but can pay for the cheapest and lowest powered one from Comcast or whatever you have nearby if you feel like you do. I personally spend about $120 per month on groceries and I hardly eat out. Ride a bike to work (you can do it, I see Hispanics doing it all the time here). If you qualify for Medicaid that can save you a minimum of $130 a month.  My parents are paying for my car insurance and phone bill until I start actually making an income, and for that I am very grateful.

Conservative,3du64y,Orsks_Axe,0,Sun Jul 19 21:39:42 2015 UTC,"This is the first sentence of the article:   Planned Parenthood's president apologized Thursday for a top official's tone in a controversial video, but she also denied the clip's allegation that her organization profits from tissue donation.   Taking the word of the accused is no way to figure out if a video is a 'hoax'.   In fairness, I'd like to point out that:    The former secretary of state collected nearly $10,000 from nine individuals who work for the country’s largest abortion provider, including from several high ranking executives at the billion-dollar operation.   $10,000 from nine individuals is not exactly a huge donation. $10,000 is barely enough money to hire the adequate security needed to keep her supporters off-camera at Hillary's next event.   None of that is really relevant to the topic at hand:  Was this PP official offering to sell the tissue and organs of aborted fetuses to a buyer?  The answer is obviously 'yes'.   I say this as a pro-choice conservative: Out of context? In what context is the organ and tissue trading from aborted fetuses correct?   Leftists that came to downvote this - ask yourself this:  Should heavily government-sponsored agencies be allowed to sell the tissue or organs of executed criminals?

In my previous comment I was just pointing out that the ""they apologized"" argument is completely false.  I'm not sure what your point was about the donations so I'm not going to address it but if you would like to clarify then I'll address it.  Was this PP official offering to sell the tissue and organs of aborted fetuses to a buyer?  The term sell here is the key. They are not selling body parts to some black market dealer. They are donating tissue for medical research that has the potential to save lives and cure diseases. The ""cost"" they were discussing is simply a reimbursement for the costs of delivery so that Planned Parenthood can ""break even"" and keep their doors open. I would say that in the context of the betterment of society, the willing donation of tissue from a consenting mother is an acceptable context.   Should heavily government-sponsored agencies be allowed to sell the tissue or organs of executed criminals?  If that criminal consented and said prior to their death that they wanted their body to be used for science then by all means their body should be used for science. If they want their body to be used to solve problems facing the living, then who is it hurting?

Conservative,3dua1q,mostnormal,3,Sun Jul 19 18:42:39 2015 UTC,"The answer is yes. They can re-restrict the requirements rather than pick up the cost.  However, of course, that would cause a social backlash in blue states at minimum and everywhere probably. This wasn't a legal trap, but it was a social obligation trap. It's a clause that gave proponents of the bill the ability to say republican states where foolish for not increasing medicare because there is no legal requirement for them to ever pick up the tab. What they obviously don't say is that the social backlash will probably prevent any state from actually using that escape route though. Which is why republican states have resisted the expansion.  That said, the state will only have to cover 10% of the expansion cost. So while they do have to find the money it's not actually a huge amount."

And before anyone says that we should repeal Obamacare...it's already here, and like it or not, it's going to stay, especially in California of all places.

Many doctors lose money on medicaid visits - when you see something like $22 on a 30 minute office visit, you certainly can't afford your overhead and make any profit.   A good friend of mine lost his practice (had to shut down) because medicaid was paying 3-4 months behind schedule and the reimbursement on his patients (majority medicaid in a small rural town) wasn't enough to keep afloat.

We've tried it that way for over a decade and it's been failure after failure. But let's keep going to the well with it.   Why it is the establishment GOP is always telling us what we can't do? The left doesn't do that. They don't say Obama or Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren are too extreme to win. They don't say Obama has only been a Senator for two years and is too inexperienced. And, do you realize that Obama has only issued 4 vetos his entire presidency? Our side negotiates against itself. They won't even send him a bill unless they know he is going to sign it. Obama doesn't say that that he is only 1/3 of the government. He doesn't say, he won't shut down the government under any circumstances (even though it takes both Congress and the POTUS). He doesn't say that he can't do that because he is restricted by the Constitution. He doesn't say he can't do that because the Supreme Court will strike it down. No. He says, ""I've got a pen and a phone.""   Our side stands for nothing except ""showing they can govern"" by constantly compromising with a radical that refuses to compromise. They keep telling us, we have to compromise our values for a candidate who stands for nothing except DNC-lite.   How would that have looked to attack a female moderator?   How about this: ""Ok, Candy, you are no longer being a moderator, you are being an advocate and to top it off you are completely wrong.

Conservative,3dtvv0,pearlofsandwich,10,Sun Jul 19 21:13:39 2015 UTC,"A problem with the current trend is proof racism is rampant (key word) has dried up.  They've moved one line of thinking over to latent forms of perceived institutionalized racism, which of course are abstract obscure notions.    To understand how abstract it is, it's not always the same type of thing where a personality culture exists within a corporation and can be fixed by changing management, which many people can relate too.  It's typically more structural.  An example is the notion white communities have advantages because, as racists way back when, they excluded minorities and held them from gaining wealth, education, or whatever.  This advantage, as the notion goes, persists, even if not consciously.     This line of thinking takes some truth (there was institutionalized racism in the south with school segregation, for example) and a whole lot of ""I just know"" and ends up into these scary belief systems.  There's so little proof required between cause and effect it's possible they can keep reinforcing and convincing themselves, and their fellow believers, a problem persists.  One noteworthy issue is 'studies' showing racism are often based around data sets and statistics, which purportedly show some form of exclusion.  Of course, statistics are only as good as the assumptions made collecting data, and therein lies the ambiguity.  There could be a whole host of reasons variation exists, but when someone is looking for racism, especially unconscious structural racism, and believes fervently it exists, the natural conclusion will be it's the culprit.    The whole thing is a self perpetuating belief system."
Conservative,3dtvv0,Roez,4,Sun Jul 19 20:22:18 2015 UTC,There's so little proof required between cause and effect    This is the thing. In most things you need a cause in effect. The problem is that institutional racism is impossible to disentangle from other causes. There is rarely a case where racism and only racism causes an effect.
Conservative,3dtvv0,MizGunner,2,Sun Jul 19 21:35:29 2015 UTC,"I probably could have written that better (I'm watching a tournament), but what you said is the crux of the entire thing.  The cause and effect logical connection is often missing when racism is discussed.  The missing proof is excused away and the gaps filled by, ""we just know it's there"".  Mike Rowe has an interesting blurb I literally just read during an intermission, which  mentions another example where cause and effect are missing.  It's his take on the Confederate Flag issue, link below:  http://mikerowe.com/2015/06/off-the-wall-confederate-flag/"

Conservative,3dtvv0,PoliSciGuy92,2,Mon Jul 20 03:44:41 2015 UTC,"My first comment said racism wasn't rampant, and I said that was the key word because of course there's racism.  Let's find ways that target it, when with confidence we can point to it, and work toward resolution.    Don't take action (especially with the whole weight of the Government behind it) based on 'just because I know.""  It's a dangerous precedent, grounded in abstract notions which can't be verified, and therefore can't ever be solved."
Conservative,3dtvv0,Roez,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:00:47 2015 UTC,"I agree often Racism is looked at the abstract too often and you can't take these conclusions and make sweeping legislation based on those abstract findings. But I do think you can find instances of racism in some particular circumstances. However, even if you find racism, there might not be a policy fix that can solve the problem. And when you do find problems, there are often other issues in the mix.   Like many successful black people say that they are closely watched by mall security. Even if you think this claim isn't true, I have no empirical evidence so I can't dispute your doubts, there isn't an easy fix to this problem even if it exists.  Those security officers should be using their intuition and black, white, etc. shouldn't be stealing in the mall. Being followed in the mall is a minor inconvenience that if it exists, doesn't have a political solution. Maybe black people do steal more, or maybe they are just followed more and white people are caught less. Doubt an actual answer empirically exists, but I think the best solution is just to acknowledge a problem exists and realize there are minor inconveniences that some black people may face. But there is no solution to these problems, even if you don't believe in this particular problem claimed by many.  An example I am more familiar with is the issuing of municipal fines disproportionately to the black community in Ferguson, MO. They gave ridiculous code violations, parking violations, etc. to citizens that aren't causing problems. And many times these citizens don't pay the initial fine and then the court comes back charges a ridiculous late fee. A stupid $100-$200 fine becomes an outrageously stupid $1,000 fine.  Now the solution is to not commit these initial infractions, and if you do pay them and show up to your court date/get a lawyer. However, there are some examples of an old women who parked her old car in her driveway got a ticket for ""derelict vehicle in the driveway."" That ticket isn't serving the public good. And many of these minor tickets are being used to fund a larger percentage of the spending in Ferguson and surrounding area, and that seems to be the case in most cities with high population of African Americans.  If the police and city government were target a public safety need that would be a different story but it does appear to be the cast that they are targeting uneducated, low income black people that are more likely to make these mistakes. What is even crazier is some people who don't pay their fines end up serving jail time to pay these tickets. (Costing the state money and preventing these people from trying to better themselves).   I'll admit the problem has less to do with race in the present, but more about the current state of affairs for those people in Ferguson.  Being black does not make you more likely to not go to court, pay your fines etc. A better indicator are things like your income and education. However these black communities were being targeted because of those other factors.  Whether you call these a racism problem or some other kind of problem, it is semantics. The problem with systemic racism in some circumstances is that it perpetuates the disparity in education and income, and this problem has an easier fix. These stupid tickets aren't serving the public good."
Conservative,3dtvv0,MizGunner,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:44:26 2015 UTC,"Very well-stated. Culpability that is assumed, rather than proven, is an issue for those accused and a license for the accuser.  To add to what you said, this belief system manages to survive its culpability problems in several ways. Those who are accused are labeled as ""privileged"", which rejects the idea that their accusations can harm the accused. By pointing to a system rather than an individual, the accused is literally dehumanized, and the accuser can label the money and property it takes from individuals as a ""solution"" instead of as a ""punishment"".  On the accuser's side, there is the problem of license. If they can accuse without proof, why can't others match their reckless righteousness? Their problem is solved by categorizing humans by class in a way which their class has a title to accuse and the opposition does not. It is, quite literally, a rejection of legal equality."

His policies have entirely capitalist   No, it's crony capitalist to the extent it's capitalist at all, and we're still in the process of transforming. They're still far from done.     Crony capitalism is a term describing an economy in which success in business depends on close relationships between business people and government officials. It may be exhibited by favoritism in the distribution of legal permits, government grants, special tax breaks, or other forms of state interventionism. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crony_capitalism    If you want to be generous you can say he wants a command and control style economy similar to Europe and the UK, but his ideology is steeped in Marxism when you get right down to it, and there's no ignoring or getting around the fact of who his mentors were and the people he hung around with. What do you call Frank Marshall Davis, the Reverend Jeremiah Wright and Bill Ayers? You're going to tell me those people weren't Marxist Communists?   Give me a break.   or at most promoting the welfare state which is something socialists don't necessarily support   The reasons for that are two-fold: 1) it's about time the repressed in this society got what they were already entitled to and deprived of supposedly by virtue of the unfairness of this country since its founding and the inherent inequities of the capitalist economic model, not to mention as it relates to supposed racism, and 2) overwhelming the system deliberately so as to bring about an economic collapse a la the Cloward-Piven model.   So please spare me the bullshit about how this man is a capitalist supposedly and not a socialist when nothing could be further from the truth. He's a 'capitalist' to the extent he can reap the benefits from it personally, along with his cronies and the groups he favors by redirecting money their way, and he most certainly didn't make the ""You didn't build that!"" argument for nothing.

Which, chances are, you won't do - because then you'll have to deal with both your arguments and evidence being exposed as a joke and torn to pieces in front of you, and how are you going to comfort yourself then?

The fact that blacks face harsher sentencing is not a representation of the criminal justice system, it is a representation of the fact that a large portion of blacks live in poverty and cannot afford adequate legal counsel.

The 18-29 crowd, the so-called 'millennials' still support Democrats to Republicans by a small majority - 55-40% respectively, according to the latest reliable polling that I could find.   The bad news for Democrats is that number has changed considerably since 2008, when it was 66-32%.   I can only imagine that the 'enthusiasm' gap has shifted wildly as well. Eleven points in 7 years is a lot of votes lost.  Young people enthusiastically (and naively) voted for Obama. Democrats don't yet have a 2016 candidate who would come close to drawing as many young voters as Obama did in 2008 & 2012. That means a lot of those young voters stay home, like they traditionally do.   There's no doubt about it. Younger people are starting to feel the real-world effects of Obama & the Dems fiscal policies, and they're not liking them. Not one bit. That's only going to continue to get worse for the Dems."

For some speculation, I also think millenials are going to start getting a little older and find liberalism a little empty.

In the US, that's already the law now. Same-sex couples can get married.   Loooong before that, plenty of employers offered benefits to same-sex live-in partners. In the 90's I have a live-in GF that worked for Vanderbilt. Even then, Vandy offered employee healthcare benefits to same-sex live-in partners. Since we weren't married, I was not eligible for her sterling benefits package. If we were gay, I would have had some really great health insurance back then.   Even before the recent SCOTUS ruling, 37 states recognized same-sex unions. That's a relatively big majority.   Property rights? Anyone can draw up a will. End of life care rights? Anyone can draw up a living will. Poor planning is not homophobia."

I fully expect Sanders to get the nomination and for Hillary to do what she did in 2008 and keep running as a Democrat instead of dropping out.  The other thing is that voters are in three basic groups: Republican only voters, Democrat only voters and swing voters.  It is the swing voters that matter.  Sanders will never get my vote, liberals will not vote Republican.  But the swing voters will decide the next president and if the democrats continue to alienate voters by being pro-illegal alien and not caring that Hillary and Obama broke the law repeatedly, the Republicans stand a good shot at winning."

Sure we have people like Marco Rubio (good guy by the way, I fully expect to see him in the Florida governor's mansion at some point), but for the most part the public's perception of the party's position on all things Latino is Trump acting like a jerk in public and calling illegal immigrants rapists.

Let the free market handle the supply of immigrants. Any good job isn't going to be taken by unskilled worker who can't speak English. With lower transaction costs, the invisible hand will guide the right amount of unskilled workers willing to do cheap labor.

So this is the KKK - which is no longer really the KKK but merely a couple thousand people in loose groups that call themselves that, and the NBBP - which is no longer the Black Panthers and are also very similar in number.   It's all just one big gathering of racists that all hate each other. Both sides agree on the anti-Semitism.

He is a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured....He was a war hero.""  The bad part of his quote was disrespecting soldiers that were captured serving their country.

This was last updated 3 days ago: It's Clinton 57% vs. Sanders not quite 18%:  http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-national-democratic-primary  As limited appeal as the Socialist Sanders has among even Democrats, he has virtually zero appeal to swing voters, and he won't steal any traditionally Republican votes away, either. He has 18% of Democrats supporting him and virtually nobody else.   To surf the internet, one could come to the conclusion that Sanders is a viable candidate.

You cited polls that are mostly based on name recognition, there's no doubt that Hillary is the most recognizable candidate out there. But I prefer to look first at the issues:   Some 63% of Americans agree that the current distribution of wealth is unfair. And in a Gallup poll done earlier this month, a majority, 52%, think that government taxation on the rich should be used to reduce the wealth gap   A majority of Americans oppose the Supreme Court “Citizens United” ruling   Some 79% of Americans believe that education beyond high school is not affordable for everyone. And some 57% of people under 30 believe student debt is a problem for youth   According to a very recent Yale/Gallup poll, Some 71% of Americans believe global warming is occurring, and 57% are sure that human activity (emitting greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide) is causing it    http://www.juancole.com/2015/05/mainstream-bernie-sanders.html  It is correct that Sanders has a huge internet following, but you also can't ignore his in-person following: he just had 12,000+ show up for a speech in Arizona and 6,000+ in Dallas, TX, not to mention the 10,000+ in Wisconsin. You can't deny that people are getting excited about him (even Coulter apparently), and I think that's what makes a viable candidate"

Meanwhile, look at the Republican polls from the same sources:  http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-national-gop-primary  That's a serious clusterfuck, but it also shows you how skewed the internet is. Jeb Bush is polling a close 2nd to Trump right now.   To read /r/Conservative, you'd think that Jeb Bush's support out there was not measurable.   It'll all shake out in the end, I suppose.

If you think that those who dismiss the holocaust as being ""a conspiracy theory"" then you should take a hard look in the mirror pal.  Its happening again, but the nice thing is, we could grant asylum to these soon to be victims if the president or the state department (take your pick) actually granted them such.

The point is this deal was highly complex and if Obama was taken for a ride then Germany, Great Britain, and France did as well. I trust having the four most powerful western countries in the world prevented the United States from leaving in a worst position than when the negotiation took place. Most Western experts seem to think this was a good deal. Only time will tell, but if this deal is rejected there is not way Russia or China reimpose the sanctions. They were wanting to get rid of them for awhile.  It is this deal or war. And if this deal is breached by Iran then war after taking out 14k centrifuges and taking away a lot of their uranium is better than going to war right now."

Mom wouldn't let me go play in it. :-(   I had an uncle in Billings, Montana - 800 miles away - and even there they had maybe a quarter inch of ash.   Scary to think about."

I have enjoyed some of the controversial things Trump said because he's hit a nerve with a lot of people that few of even the other Republican candidates have said, but there's lots and lots to go after John McCain without going after his war record.  I'd have said something like, ""Sure, he's a war hero, but what has really done for America since then?  Simply being elected Senator isn't enough, he's compromised American values with liberals rather than standing with conservatives; he's advocated far too much in government spending; and in spite of the fact that he was elected from Arizona, he doesn't look to protect his constituency from the flood of illegal aliens.  My question is ""What has John McCain done for America since he left the Navy?""  That way you can blast that RINO McCain without questioning the merit of his service.  Every Republican in America should be criticizing Trump for this remark."

But we're talking about off-color remarks that were made in a fit of ungoverned passion - ones he eventually backed away from. For what it's worth, he now says he respects military POWs for their service. It's sort of like when a girl makes herself look like a complete asshole by commenting on the size of her ex's ""manhood,"" when it had nothing to do with the break-up, nothing to do with his actions, was never a problem in the relationship, isn't anything he can really control, and has more to do with her anger at that one individual, rather than all smaller guys in general. A crude example, to be sure, but people lash out all the time, bringing down whole groups of people with such petty insults.

But anyway I pretty much agree with you in that I prefer Paul or Cruz but I'm impressed with Trumps recent tenacity. So many people who care about politics (and many of those who don't) get tired of...well politics. They get tired of being paid lip service and lied to or with politicians who dance around the issues. Trump told it like it is. The facts are with him and there is a ""silent majority"" that agrees strongly that we are not getting Mexico's best and brightest. Unchecked illegal immigration is a plague on this nation that our politicians refuse to fix. I don't actually believe Trump will fix it either even if elected to the white house but god damn is it refreshing just to hear someone higher up on that totem poll say it loud and clear for once."
Conservative,3dth4t,IMULTRAHARDCORE,2,Sun Jul 19 13:31:12 2015 UTC,"Here's my opinion as to why Trump is doing so well.  1) He's talking about illegal immigration, and it's not sugar coating it.  He's not talking about how it's good for the country or the economy nor is he telling the story about how all illegal immigrants are hard working people falling the laws and providing a better life for their families.  No, he's telling the hard truth that Liberals want to ignore.  That they are breaking serious laws.  He's getting people to talk about it.  People who want to fix and secure our borders are listening to him.  It's hard for me to hear Trump speak on this issue and not want to vote for him.  I live in Texas and I'm tired of going to a fast food counter and having the person behind the counter address me in spanish and have some asshole liberal tell me that I should be learning spanish.    2) One of the top Democrats running is Bernie Sanders, an open unapologetic socialist.  Trump is the polar opposite as a billionaire capitalist.  If there is any candidate running right now who can tell Sanders just how his policies won't work, it's going to be him.  Sadly, those who support Sanders don't understand money or math or economics enough to realize that Sanders is full of shit and Trump is right.  I expect Trump to push for job creation by making it beneficial for employers to hire more people and that would be how the economy under him will improve.  I expect Sanders to continue with higher taxes, making it more difficult for employers to hire and more government programs to make the citizens dependent upon the government."

Of course, Obama will weigh in on every scumbag hoodlum shot (by a cop, that is) and use that as an excuse to try and nationalize local police.

Conservative,3do19r,bltsponge,-5,Sat Jul 18 05:19:46 2015 UTC,"Who said Obama didn't trust soldiers with weapons?   It is illegal for Military members to have firearms on base. Obama is the Commander-in-Chief and has never changed or addressed this policy despite the shootings that have happened on his watch.   Do you disagree that the deal made this week increases the time the Iranians can produce a bomb from the current 3 months to 12 months?   Yes, I disagree. Tehran's goal is not to have a couple of lousy gravity dropped low yield bombs like North Korea has, only to have their program wiped out in an attack by Israel, Saudi Arabia, or another U.S. President with a spine. They want a plutonium source to make miniaturized nukes that fit on ICBMs and advanced ICBMs to deliver them to anywhere on earth in 30 minutes. This deal keeps their refinement infrastructure in place and protects them from attack under the guise of compliance while they perfect these technologies. Technologies which the deal does nothing to stop. When they do achieve these goals, they kick out the inspectors and can announce as a nuclear armed state and will not be vulnerable like they would now if they broke out in a few months. Obama and his shills are only looking at the next few months. Iran is playing the long game and they have won with this shit deal."
Conservative,3do19r,well_here_I_am,14,Fri Jul 17 22:03:22 2015 UTC,"Except that the deal as stands allows for inspections; even with the advance notice required giving the possibility of hiding evidence, it is impossible to hide the traces of radiation at a level of refinement anywhere near that of a nuclear bomb. Is is also impossible to hide the massive amounts of power that go into highly refining uranium, with a process that takes a year."
Conservative,3do19r,Terron1965,-8,Fri Jul 17 22:24:09 2015 UTC,"They don't care about Uranium. They are already confident they can refine that to weapon's grade. Under the deal, even if they don't cheat, they get to keep 5,000 centrifuges (and Pakistan built their bomb with only 3,000). What Iran wants is Plutonium that is easier to miniaturize for ICBMs. They get to keep their heavy water reactor and perfect that technology. And they have no limits placed on ICBM development. They want a complete nuclear weapons system, not some shitty bomb they have to strap under a plane that is going to be shot down 500 miles from it's target."
Conservative,3do19r,MizGunner,0,Sat Jul 18 00:43:19 2015 UTC,"To be fair with ICBM development, currently, I think, there are 5, maybe 6 countries in the world with ICBM capabilities. They are a very difficult difficult technology to build and harness that require some serious tech.  Countries like Pakistan, Germany, Japan, Canada don't even have them.  But yes, allowing Iran to procure weapons that allow them to project their power outside their borders is a scary thing that should not be allowed and cut from any agreements."

Conservative,3do19r,toms_face,-2,Sat Jul 18 09:49:39 2015 UTC,"Crippling sanctions - should have been enacted years ago, and maybe it would have been Iran calling for the deal, not a pathetic failed president begging for something to cement his legacy. We should have been expending all our diplomatic capital to cut Iran off completely and drive them to the table.  Regime Change - Instead of backing the Iranian Green Movement in 2009, Obama was deafeningly silent. He was more interested in showing the Mullahs that he had no intention of taking a hard line with them than in supporting an actual pro-Western democracy movement. There is a strong pro-western contingency in Iran that we should be doing everything in our power to support including arming them, the same way Iran armed anti-U.S. forces in Iraq with armor penetrating IED (which they have gotten away with).  Surgical strikes - Let Iran know we mean business. When they creep out into the Persian Gulf and try to kidnap sailors, we bomb their boats. When they shoot down our drones, we take out their surface-to-air missiles. Let them know that they are on thin ice. ""But that will start a war,"" says the cowardly Leftist. I doubt it. How many times did we do strikes like this on Saddam? He just sat there and took it.   Finally when Iran is begging for a deal, then we set it up with actual unrestricted access and termination of all centrifuges. If you do it right, the people rise up and take out the Mullahs for you. Now obviously none of that can happen because we sold out for Obama's legacy."
Conservative,3do19r,toms_face,6,Sat Jul 18 02:16:28 2015 UTC,"Sanctions-  I agree sanctions should have been brought to the table years ago. But the United States can't unilaterally impose sanctions. The recent sanctions were only imposed out of the promise to sit down and negotiate with Iran. The sanctions were unraveling if we didn't get this deal done.  I know some people have disputed the idea of sanction unraveling. I guess you would trust China to keep those sanctions on Iran without a deal?  I think the best indication of the sanctions unraveling in the future are the terms of the deal. Obama & Kerry would have been able to get a better deal if we were able to hold sanctions indefinitely. No one wanted to include ICBMs in the deal ever, but 8 years shows we still had more bargaining power, but not enough to keep sanctions going indefinitely. You'll argue Obama wanted to do it all for his legacy, but if he has the power to make the deal better, that improves his legacy.   Regime Change-  I'd stay out of Iranian politics. History shows we shouldn't meddle and it seems Iran is changing on their own with Hassan Rouhani. He isn't Green, but has their support. If a hard-liner takes over in the next election or anytime soon this obviously changes. And your option 3 starts kicking in.  Surgical Strikes-  We can't simply walk into Iranian airspace, Iran isn't Iraq. United States & its allies had already crippled Iraq's air defense system with the cumulative effects of years of air strikes during Desert Shield, Desert Storm and No-Fly actions. The crippling sanctions that had prevented Iraq from rebuilding said air defense system. Iran would take much longer. However, you'd still need an on the ground BDA to know if you destroyed all the critical aspects of the targets. Or you could trust Iran when they are begging for a deal.   Even then, they'd probably still have enough fissile material left to dig out the rubble for a nice dirty bomb, which they'd have much fewer qualms about using after we took a big swipe at their one strategic option. If this isn't soon after bombing the shit out of them, this will be a reoccurring problem. Or an Iranian ISIS forms and we have to start worrying about them.   Diplomacy Benefits  But even after all three of these options are being considered, we still have the option to reimposed sanctions if Iran starts screwing with inspections, or starting doing surgical strikes. So all of you options are still on the table. If Iran breaks the deal, all the downsides to options you said go away, because making sure Iran doesn't get a bomb is the main priority. Iran isn't going to get a huge jump on making a nuclear bomb right under our noses.   I don't trust Iran, but Iran wants to sell oil. And we have cameras everywhere, inspectors everywhere, if Iran wants to keep making money, they'll follow the agreement. If they screw around, yeah they could start working for a bomb, but their economy goes to shit and we bomb their entire country.   I would rather try diplomacy, it will save lives, and if it fails, we haven't eliminated any of your options and didn't alienate any world powers by going against the original reasons for the sanctions."

These sanctions were severe, but only because the global community saw them as a tool to diplomacy. Sanctions based on punitive measures aren't viewed favorably, especially when made for diplomacy.

Without getting into anything classified, we can hit them with B-2 stealth bombers any day and with a variety of cruise missiles.   Good to know. This line right here is what ties the whole deal together and improves my point. This shows why this deal isn't based on trust.

At least now we have cameras in enough places to have a better idea where those places are going to be.   I think Iran has enough incentives to keep them away from breaking this deal. Yeah they have ideologically driven crazies but we aren't going to keep them under control, deal or no deal. At least now the Green Party and Moderates have a incentive to try to keep their own under control. And if they can't, based on your military intelligence Iran is fucked. Iran can't bomb us overnight. We should have stopped them sooner, but we still have time if they start screwing around.   And if they bomb us they have to do it with 6K first-generation centrifuges rather than do it with 20k they had before the deal. That makes this deal better than status quo even if you have the assumption it gets broken in the near future. As they are much further from the bomb.   How fast do you think we could start bombing Iran?"

Except now we can't because we are in a deal with them and they can use that to weasel, play shell games and stall.

That makes this deal better than status quo even if you have the assumption it gets broken in the near future. As they are much further from the bomb.   Nope, they are not. They are just the same position, but will have a decade of international top cover to work on ICBMs and Plutonium."
Conservative,3do19r,StabbyDMcStabberson,4,Sat Jul 18 04:16:09 2015 UTC,"You are right about the punitive comment, if we make sanctions more intense to make a better deal then they weren't punitive. However, our world view differs on the politics of the mullahs and Iranian government.   I believe the mullahs would be more powerful in a time of struggle for Iran. They are an evil that we must keep a watchful eye over in any situation. But these mullah types multiply when you cripple their economy. By working with Iran on this deal we have empowered the Green Party and Moderates without using military force.  It is what caused the Green Party's surge in power.  I think this is a big sticking point. I want to use military force only after trying to showing Iran the benefits of a western society, trade and economic power of the west. I want to use a carrot and stick. Your plan may have a little carrot, but it certainly isn't enough to show Iran the power of capitalism and democracy. And if Iran screws up this opportunity, then and only then do I feel comfortable completely leveling their country.   Usually primarily the stick with the mullah might be the only way to do it, but I just imagine Hercules fighting the Hydra when you say that.    Nope, they are not. They are just the same position, but will have a decade of international top cover to work on ICBMs and Plutonium.   This is where I don't understand your beliefs systems. We slowed them down.  You have to admit that destroying 14K centrifuges, leaving Iran with 6K centrifuges is better than 20k. Even if that is still enough to make a bomb, more centrifuges just allow mullahs to put together a bomb quicker. It is better than the status quo. Iran was going to get their hands on their frozen assets eventually. And we can't prevent the Asian countries from trading with them forever.   This all boils down to the fact that you don't trust Obama. I think he used the extent of his diplomatic capital, he could have waited another year if he thought it was necessary, but he thought this was the best deal he was going to get in his eight years (Presumably so did all the European countries did as well). All Presidents like to wrap up major agreements with multiple countries before the massive turnover of himself and his administration. Just part of our political process.   Maybe a Republican could have used our diplomatic capital better, but that is all speculation on your part. At this point you have to recognize that the US really only has one bite at the apple and this is the deal we are going to get. Other countries aren't going to reimpose sanctions if Congress messes this up now.  If we don't pass this agreement, that means war.  If Iran violates this deal, that means war with mostly global approval.   I'm glad we could have this discussion, you made solid arguments, we just view the world differently."
Conservative,3do19r,the-knife,-1,Sat Jul 18 05:08:38 2015 UTC,Why do you think the USA would actually attack Iran? Iran knows we wouldn't so that point is moot. If we attacked them in 8 years I would ask the question as to why we just didn't do that in the first place and prevent them from gaining any advantage over the years we delayed. Obama squandered the capital the USA has built over the years about meaning what it says and following through on its threats. This makes diplomacy with anyone less effective when you negotiate without teeth.  Iran wins and the USA loses in this deal and there is no other way to look at it.
Conservative,3do19r,-__---____-----,0,Sat Jul 18 06:14:01 2015 UTC,"Why do you think the USA would actually attack Iran?    To prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon if this deal falls through. That is a threat large enough, probably the greatest realistic threat to the world, and even Obama would commit to taking military action. If Iran thinks otherwise they are fucked.  But if you are right, if this is an empty threat, then negotiations are pointless and we should just bomb them now and prevent any type of build up. But if that is the case than Obama won't bomb them now anyway. So there is no way to win if Iran is acting under the assumptions you believe, and Obama is going to act the way you believe. Iran won't compromise if they don't think military action will be taken. If Iran did, then Obama will have won this round on a bluff.   Based your line of thinking negotiations are pointless, with Obama at the helm. The only way they are worthwhile is if have hard power to back them up. And if Obama won't use military force than the world is in trouble.  However, if Iran follows through on this deal just for a year and half then they have to deal with a new President. If Iran follows through the initial steps of getting rid of most of their centrifuges and uranium then the next President can deal with a Iran that has decreased its nuclear capabilities. And that President won't have the same reputation as Obama.   That right there means the USA would improve their position based on a bluff. As a poker player that's winning. And if we lose, well you couldn't expect to win sitting on a 7-2 off-suit. We were screwed from the get-go if that is the case and no deal would have been good."
Conservative,3do19r,-__---____-----,6,Sat Jul 18 17:24:44 2015 UTC,"What don't you actually like about this deal though? I think it's good that Iran loses its capability to create nuclear weapons without the world knowing, while ending the sanctions and allowing them to use more nuclear power."
Conservative,3do19r,killingbabyseals,-10,Sat Jul 18 17:44:03 2015 UTC,"That's incredibly naive. It does nothing to curb their weapons program if you know what they really want. They shut down some centrifuges temporarily and that buys them time to get what they really want a ICBM launchable nukes. They need time to achieve that. They need Plutonium, which is easier to miniaturize for ICBMs. They get to keep their heavy water reactor (which can be used to produce Plutonium) and perfect that technology. They also need to perfect their ICBMs, and this deal has no limits placed on ICBM development. They don't want some lousy low yield  bomb they have to strap under a plane that is going to be shot down 500 miles from it's target. In this deal, they get to continue all this research and be in total compliance and untouchable from a military strike (which would be seen as unprovoked). When they are ready, they kick out the inspectors and go full nuke and nobody can stop them unless you want LA or NY nuked in 30 minutes. They will still be outgunned, but they are willing to die to kill a few million evil infidels and usher a new holocaust. Just listen to the apocalyptic language of their leaders."
Conservative,3do19r,killingbabyseals,11,Sat Jul 18 03:17:20 2015 UTC,"The deal makes Iran give up almost all of its enriched uranium and is only being allowed to have its uranium enriched at 3.67% whereas it would have to be around 90% to be used for weapons. They have to give up most of their centrifuges, and very extensive facility inspections."
Conservative,3do19r,Ceolanmc,-4,Sat Jul 18 03:29:29 2015 UTC,"The Uranium is irrelevant. What is important is the infrastructure. Even if the don't cheat, they get to keep 2,000 more centrifuges than Pakistan needed to make their first nuke.   By the way, you might want to read up on Uranium enrichment because you are making the mistake of thinking that 4% purity is still 86% away from the 90% needed for a bomb. The Separative Work Units (SWU) per ton of feed stock is not linear. To get to reactor grade (4% purity) requires about 67% of the SWU to get to weapons grade. Research reactor grade (20% purity) is 85% in SWU per ton of feed stock.  ""The curve flattens out so much because the mass of material being enriched progressively diminishes to these amounts, from the original one tonne, so requires less effort relative to what has already been applied to progress a lot further in percentage enrichment. The relatively small increment of effort needed to achieve the increase from normal levels is the reason why enrichment plants are considered a sensitive technology in relation to preventing weapons proliferation""  http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle/Conversion-Enrichment-and-Fabrication/Uranium-Enrichment/"
Conservative,3do19r,Ceolanmc,7,Sat Jul 18 03:38:49 2015 UTC,"If the uranium is irrelevant, then you wouldn't have a problem with Iran storing uranium. Personally I'd rather be safe and make sure that Iran cannot make nuclear weapons with their uranium due to the threat that they can be to other countries. Even though Iran's religious head of state has declared nuclear weapons to be against their religion, we should still be careful.  The fact remains that Iran is only allowed to keep their uranium at less than 4% enrichment, while it requires 90% to make weapons. This means that they have an enrichment level for producing nuclear power for energy consumption, but not to create a fission reaction used in nuclear weapons.  What I am referring to by enrichment is the proportion of uranium-235 isotopes, in contrast to uranium-238 isotopes."
Conservative,3do19r,pipechap,-3,Sat Jul 18 03:58:58 2015 UTC,"In the context of development of a bomb, uranium stockpile is not relevant. The ability to refine it is what is relevant.

Iran's religious head of state has declared nuclear weapons to be against their religion    The fact that this ever happened is disputed. Nevertheless, there is in Shi'a Islam the concept of the Taqiya, or the legal lie, where it is religiously acceptable to lie for a variety of self-serving reasons especially to your enemies.   The fact remains that Iran is only allowed to keep their uranium at less than 4% enrichment, while it requires 90% to make weapons.    Go back and read the article I posted. You obviously didn't get it. You still don't realize that 4% refined is already 67% of the way to weapons grade because the work required is not linear.

Conservative,3do19r,kittyscat,-2,Sat Jul 18 17:04:54 2015 UTC,"1) Iran has already produced research grade uranium which is about 85% of the work (SWU per ton of feedstock) to make weapons grade. Weapons grade is just a few more spins in the centrifuge.   2) The number of participants is irrelevant. A distinction without a difference. Any difference is a two-edged sword. The other edge that cuts us is that now you have China and Russia and the notoriously unreliable French to block and run interference for Iran.  3) The inspections in this one is also terrible. The excuse that they already produced research grade uranium can be used to mask future inspections.  4) Nope, wrong again. As long as Iran keeps stalling and appealing, they can still appear to be in compliance and any attack would be seen as unilateral and unprovoked without exhausting diplomatic channels.  Iran learned from North Korea how to stall and exploit pollyannish liberal fools with diplomacy in order to get what they want. Apparently the liberal fools did not learn."
Conservative,3do19r,KuztomX,4,Sat Jul 18 17:25:13 2015 UTC,I owned several firearms and had them legally stored on post as well as several other buddies.
Conservative,3do19r,kittyscat,-1,Sat Jul 18 17:40:13 2015 UTC,"Kept under lock and key in the armory or command post, correct? Certainly not readily accessible for self defense, which is what we are talking about."
Conservative,3do19r,KuztomX,2,Sat Jul 18 03:57:31 2015 UTC,"All weapons have to be registered with the Provost General only with a signed statement from the unit commander, and this includes bb guns, paintball guns, bows, firearms and slingshots (don't quote me on the slingshots that is what I was just told). Pistols in the state of New York have to be given to and will be held by the Provost Marshall until the SM displays a valid pistol permit. Single soldiers who live in the barracks will have all their firearms held in the unit armory and will only be accessible under the discretion of the unit commander (this makes things difficult because no armorer is his right mind is going to want to wake up and be at the arms room at 0430 on a Saturday morning so you can pick up your deer rifle and show up sometime later in the afternoon). Married soldiers or single soldiers not living in the barracks but living on post are allowed to store their firearms in base housing as long as they are registered with the Provost Marshall. Most units require soldiers to disclose number of firearms they own as well as the serial numbers so that if the soldier presents or is suspected of posing a risk to themselves or others they will be able to seize the SM weapons and store them in the arms room, and only be released at the discretion of behavioral health and the unit commander. Even though they make this difficult there are many work arounds, while I registered my deer rifle and shotgun on post for the sole reason of hunting in the training area, I stored all of my weapons off post in a gun safe anchored to the floor in a storage unit. I was in for 5 years, had a perfectly clean record with no mental health issues and a secured storage site off post, which allowed my unit to look the other way. While I think loosing restrictions on post with firearms is a good idea, allowing single soldiers to be able to store firearms in their rooms is usually a piss poor idea. Single soldiers are notoriously stupid and often drunk leading to dumb situations. Unlike in real life where you can pick your roommate and where you live, you can not do that in the military, nor move away from bad people and people you don't like. In the military the same asshole who is your boss is very likely to be that same drunken asshole who lives one room down, and it is asking for trouble when two very intoxicated people who don't like each other are living right next to each other, and worse when there is access to firearms. The service like normal life is full of trash, and with firearms this leads to thieves, with rooms relatively easy to break into, and too small to hold a decent safe, I would not feel comfortable with leaving several thousands of dollars worth of firearms unsecured in my barracks room for some dick nosed faggot to steal. Military rifles are one thing if they get stolen or go missing, the entire base goes into lock down until they are found, and the chucklefuck who stole it will go to assfuck prison, as well as the person who lost it is going to be in a world of hurt. Sensitive military equipment such as rifles undergo regular inventory to see if everything is there, the only way to ensure that privately owned firearms are not stolen is to store them securely in the arms room and undergo the same checks as military owned firearms. The looser gun control on military installations I would support would be to allow CC holders to be able to CC on pot (which is banned) except SM who live in the barracks would not be allowed to store their firearms in their barracks rooms. I would also support a base wide personal weapons arms room that is open 24 hours a day but would be a logistical nightmare. tl;dr Allowing CC on post would be the biggest ease of gun restrictions on military facilities, but not if you are a single soldier, if you are a single soldier you are fucked."

Conservative,3dp5uf,FleetSevens,-5,Sat Jul 18 18:09:40 2015 UTC,"If you're going to give a rebuttal to John Oliver give a proper one rather than name calling. What reason is there to be disrespectful to trans people? Let's run with your view that trans people are mentally ill. Do you think treating a mentally ill person disrespectfully and inhumanely is giong to help them be functional, happy members of society? Is treating a transgender person with complete disregard for how they'd like to be treated going to help be free of government dependence? It won't. I know it wont. You know it won't. Caitlyn Jenner may be an affluent woman, but she's still part of the most poorly treated minority in North America.  Important note that I explain more further down- there is no ""cure"" for gender dysphoria. You can't make a trans person stop being trans by any method. They've tried it for decades. They have never found a thing that makes gender dysphoria disappear."
Conservative,3dp5uf,PhazonZim,11,Sat Jul 18 12:34:05 2015 UTC,"It is disrespectful to allow other types of mentally ill people to indulge their illness.  Why not this one?  Most people want to help these people and clearly this illness is not normal.  Treating it like it is normal is even more disrespectful than at least honoring the fact that they are sick.  It allows them to quickly spiral in their illness rather than at any point challenging themselves that something might be wrong in their psyche.  At no point in time does it make sense to say to other types of mental illnesses, 'ok, just indulge it for a while.  You'll be fine'.  It's a massive, long-term battle of the mind.  Helping them is not indulging them in their sickness and allowing them to spiral to this point.  Helping them would be similar to helping an anorexic person.  You don't say to an anorexic person, 'hey go ahead and don't eat if that makes you feel better'.  You work with them (sometimes for a long time) to help get them over the mental barrier of not eating correctly.  Ultimately it comes down to their ability to beat it.  Society encouraging them that they don't have to is what is disrespectful to them.  It goes a long way to disabling this ability.  The proper rebuttal to John Oliver here is that those names of pop stars are not attached to a mental illness, but a figure of fame.  Detaching the name from the issue is what he is trying to do."
Conservative,3dp5uf,Fran7118,-3,Sat Jul 18 13:16:36 2015 UTC,"Okay, there are two angles here to look at. Let's compare gender dysphoria to schizophrenia and psychopathy-- two medically recognized mental disorders. Someone with schizophrenia cannot be made to function simply by embracing their hallucinations. Inevitably there will be a hallucination that will interfere with their interactions with the real world. I have a friend whose mom has schizophrenia so severe she needs to be in a care home. Does it seem necessary that a male-bodied person who claims to be female be put in a home? That's pretty excessive and wasteful. Someone with psychopathy is a danger to other people, they must be treated for the protection of others. A person with gender dysphoria? Let them do their thing and they go back to being a normal, functioning member of society. Gender dysphoria stops interfering with their everyday interaction with the real world and they can go back to being productive.  Now the other angle. The fact is there has been no successful method of treating gender dysphoria found other than transition. Other methods, including medication, electro-shock therapy, counselling, lobotomy, etc were tried for decades with no success. Transition is a drastic medical solution, but it's the one they go with because it's found to have worked.  Imagine you had cancer and you're given the option to go for chemotherapy or be given counselling by a psychologist to will the cancer away. Which would you go with? Chemotherapy is not great, but it's the one that works. Sometimes it doesn't work, sure, but it's better than going with the solution that we know for a fact does not work."
Conservative,3dp5uf,PhazonZim,8,Sat Jul 18 13:40:58 2015 UTC,"Whether or not SRS works is very controversial.  It is safe to say that it is not a guaranteed fix for their problems.    In some cases transgenders should spend time in homes to protect themselves from their self as they (like many other mental illnesses) commonly have suicidal thoughts.  Not for their entire lifetime of course, but clearly these people need additional, close-knit assistance with their issues.  Chemotherapy does not work every time when attempting to treat cancer either."

No. As someone who has dealt with anxiety and depression, nothing is worse than sitting at home in the echo chamber of your own mind. Suicidal thoughts manifest and grow when left unchecked. The best way to clear such thoughts is to be open about it with friends and family; to know you can talk to someone, ask for help, or have a shoulder to lean on.  The last thing someone who already hates him or her self and wants to die needs is the negative stigma of being ostracized and placed into a home. Love, compassion, and understanding do WONDERS. I pulled through my issues with the help of my friends, not my counselor or psychiatrist or any of the drugs they tried to feed me."

Conservative,3dp5uf,Andrew985,3,Sat Jul 18 18:44:59 2015 UTC,"It's actually not really controversial at all, and SRS is but one part of many in the journey that is transition. Transgender people have suicidal thoughts because gender dysphoria makes them hate their bodies and society treats them like garbage. If a trans person is treated with respect and modern medicine helps them be comfortable with their bodies they won't contemplate suicide.   The reason I brought up chemotherapy is because transition doesn't always work either. Sometimes people still treat a trans person like garbage after transition, and sometimes modern medicine isn't enough to make them happy with their bodies. Transition falling short for those people isn't enough to dismiss it entirely, it still works better than anything else.  So here's what it boils down to. Do you want to give trans people the best possible outcome? Do you want them to not be a burden on society? If so, then treat them with respect and dignity and accept that transition is the best known method of treating gender dysphoria. If you DON'T want what's best for trans people, and you want them to burden society, then continue to call them delusional and promote treatments that the medical community has known to be ineffective for decades. Here's the real delusion, wanting there to be a solution that you're comfortable does not make it so. There are countless trans people who will tell you that transition helped them live normal, happy and productive lives. I'm one of them. I would have committed suicide if transition wasn't an option-- but now my life is awesome."

I'm glad you are happy now.  You know that others won't feel the same and the change is life-altering and permanent.  There will be and are people who have had SRS and regret it so much they contemplate suicide.  They should never feel forced into thinking that this is their only option and/or an easy way out.  We're going to have to agree to disagree on what is 'delusional'.  There are also people who are just confused and think they are transgender when they are actually not medically diagnosed as being so.  I'm not implying this is you, but you know this is happening.  What about the families that have made it in the news for encouraging this type of feeling in their children?  You have already acknowledged it is a mental illness, yet society is making it into something they want to consider 'normal'.    If a person whose mental illness makes them think they shouldn't have a limb and they feel suicidal due to these thoughts should we allow them to have it amputated?    I'm not going to debate this any longer as we have both clearly drawn the line.  I do respect your opinion and you as a person."

Diagnoses which were once a death sentence are now life-saving surgeries that are practically out-patient, adding tens of years to lives. Successful treatments exist for all kinds of diseases, where 150 years ago, 'doctors' diagnosed the patient with 'consumption' and covered them with leeches or drilled holes in their heads with rusty bits to let the evil spirits out.

Conservative,3dpnao,fizzy88,4,Sun Jul 19 02:23:08 2015 UTC,"Sure, it is mostly because of government regulation. Specifically, it is because of lack of appropriate government regulation on the health insurance market. If you read further into the post, the added section, he says (emphasis mine):   To answer many people's implicit questions, some of the largest drivers of cost in the United States are (1) insurance companies and (2) patient expectations. Let me address the former, then the latter.  Overhead on insurance runs something like 20%. Medicare's overhead used to be about 1-2% until they let private insurers sell ""medicare advantage"" plans, and the overhead on those is somewhere in the ballpark of 20%. Our highly complicated private insurance market is a driver of this, because it will always be in the insurance company's best interest to deny as many claims as possible. This is, of course, preposterous and bullshit like that should be illegal, but the health insurance companies have powerful lobbyists and we're stuck with this system (for the record, I'm of the personal opinion that health insurance companies should be operated exclusively for the benefit of the members, not for shareholder dividends). Anyway, this system results in even more overhead costs since hospitals and physician practice groups have to employ people just to submit bills for the care they provide.  Our system is absolute insanity and the insurance market should be heavily regulated the way it is in other countries. There are multiple different types of healthcare systems that are all still far better than how the US does it. Many of the best systems are run entirely through a (highly regulated) private insurance marketplace. It doesn't have to be a binary choice between our current system and single payer.   Edit: I personally don't hold the opinion that more or heavier regulation is better, but I would say we need the right regulation to keep costs from going out of control as they do now. You can't leave health care to the free market because, as Iatros stated, it will always be in the best interest of the insurance company (and the shareholders) to deny as many claims as possible to increase profit."

Or rather, perhaps because the wrong regulations are in place.  I'm not saying we should have no regulation at all.

The same theme ran true at the Navy Yard in DC on September 16. Police were called after the shooter opened fired, and reports indicate it took approximately three to seven minutes for them to arrive. ""  http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2013/09/17/when-military-gun-free/  Edit:  According to this article it was not entirely Clinton's fault - the directive banning guns being carried by regular soldiers on base was initially issued by George H.W. Bush, implimented by Clinton, and re-authorized under Obama.  So in other words, the RINOs and the Democrats once again worked together to screw America... what else is new?"

If this isn't political then why was the shooting of a black Church considered political and southern heritage stripped and degraded with everyone jumping to conclusions? This is an example of liberal hypocrisy. It's political because if those Marines had a Side Arm they might have had there lives saved. Though let's be honest, if a recruit was killed along side of them would the narrative be any different? You liberals think with an agenda that deals with shutting down the opposition. If you don't agree with it, or are offended about it you whine and complain until It's dealt with."
Conservative,3dmeai,chabanais,0,Fri Jul 17 21:42:42 2015 UTC,"It IS a political issue, because anti-gun groups are calling for more gun control where as those on the rights have called for allowing soldiers to carry on military bases.  Obviously, checks are far from foolproof - duh - which is how the Ft. Hood shooter managed to get onto the base with a loaded handgun and shoot several dozen unarmed soldiers in a cafeteria.  I agree, the problem is not just with bases themselves, military members should carry at all times, even at the recruiting center or when off base.  Why would we not trust the people we trained to safely handle and use weapons to safely handle and use weapons?    Let me tell you a story.  I grew up less than a mile from a military base (not a military family, they just liked the town).  I won't mention the name of the base because I don't want to give ISIS any suggestions, but trust me to say it was a MAJOR one.  Like top tier list of potential targets for an attack.  When I was a kid, there was a path behind my friend's house through the woods that led directly to a remote corner of the base where the fence was dug up.  We used to crawl underneath and walk around exploring the place.  As a teenager - post 9/11 - we would sometimes go visit friends and such who worked on base such as at the commissary.  The guards would check underneath our car, in the trunk, etc., but we didn't have to get out of the car.  They would have had no idea if we all had two or three handguns a piece hidden under our clothing or inside the cabin.    TL,DR:  Gun free zones don't work, not even on military bases.  Members of the military are a target and should be encouraged if not required to carry and be ready to protect themselves, their fellow soldiers, and civilians if possible."

Conservative,3dn0ss,markdesign,19,Sat Jul 18 00:54:25 2015 UTC,"He has a case for assault; and he may have a case for battery.  Assault is an act which creates an apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact.  Clearly those elements are met here; in regards to both the statement made on air as well as the statement made re ""seeing him in the parking lot"" later on.  Battery is an act which brings about a harmful or offensive touching of a person, or of an object closely associated with the person (e.g. a camera or a hat).  There is potentially a case for battery, since the transgender person (man) put his hand on the back of Shapiro's neck (this could amount to an offensive contact, especially in the context of the verbal threat being made).  IMO, Shapiro should definitely pursue the case because he is very likely to win.  SOURCE: I'm studying for the bar exam, which is on the 28th (kill me)."

Conservative,3dn0ss,ryandomness,4,Sat Jul 18 03:06:10 2015 UTC,Whether or not they are mentally ill is irrelevant when you consider that the best outcomes for them is to accept their identity and let them transition. The reason psychologists and doctors allow this is simply that it's the only thing that has consistently proven to allow trans people to live happier lives. To demand a person not transition is to not want what's been found to be best for them. That's not showing respect and kindness  Downvoting medical knowledge because you don't like it doesn't make it less true.
Conservative,3dn0ss,PhazonZim,2,Sat Jul 18 10:39:20 2015 UTC,If it makes them happier then why do such a high percentage of them attempt suicide? Suicide seems to be the antithesis to happiness or am I missing something?
Conservative,3dn0ss,JordanCardwell,7,Sat Jul 18 13:14:32 2015 UTC,"They don't attempt suicide because people are letting them transition. They attempt suicide because people are treating them like shit and medical treatment of gender dysphoria isn't perfect. A trans person who is in a place where they are treated with respect and dignity, and comfortable with what modern medicine has been able to do for them will not attempt suicide. If you want to see a lower rate of suicide for trans people, be respectful and accept them."
Conservative,3dn0ss,PhazonZim,2,Sat Jul 18 13:26:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but this sounds like circular reasoning. Let's for a moment say we agree that the reason trans people attempt suicide is because of bullying. It STILL would follow that helping them transition does not lead to happiness. Last time I checked, being led into a life of bullying which leads to suicide isn't exactly happiness by any definition I can think of.  And that is all aside from the need to prove that bullying can cause a group of people to attempt suicide at a 25-41% rate. In order to prove this, you would need to show that other groups of people who are bullied also attempt suicide at that radically high rate.  So to summarize, even if we agree that bullying is to blame for the suicides, I don't see how you can call that ""happiness"". Also, please prove that bullying causes all of these suicides."
Conservative,3dn0ss,JordanCardwell,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:09:50 2015 UTC,They attempt suicide because people are treating them like shit   Do you really believe that's why transgenders commit suicide at such a high rate? It has nothing to do with their various mental illnesses?

I have no problem with any of the gays, but how is transgender any different from that white girl pretending she was a black?  I feel like America should watch the South Park episode where Kyle's dad tries to become a dolphin again.

If Bruce Jenner wants to live and identify as Caitlyn, should we not accept that? I think the fact that most people say she should be forced to live as Bruce is what drives most trans people to suicide."
Conservative,3dn0ss,jjlew080,5,Sat Jul 18 11:48:19 2015 UTC,"Do we accept someone with schizophrenia in our society? Do we indulge their delusions? No, we try to get them to seek help. That's the point that Shapiro is making. Shapiro is saying that Bruce/Caitlyn can do whatever they want with their body, but we shouldn't be congratulating him on his mental illness.   Shapiro has a good counterargument to the suicide point as well. The suicide rate doesn't change after a person changes how they identify. It's not an effective treatment.   At the end of the day, if someone wants to change how they identify, let them. But don't congratulate them."
Conservative,3dn0ss,jettj14,3,Sat Jul 18 14:01:32 2015 UTC,"So your only issue is congratulating them? No one is saying, ""congratulations on your mental illness!"". We should be congratulating them on living their life how they want to live it. Living as a trans person doesn't harm anybody, but living with schizophrenia, per your example, certainly can harm others.  I'm not going to pretend I understand transgenderism, I don't think anybody can that isn't going through  it. But what I do know is it must be incredibly difficult, scary and confusing to the point that ending your our life is a better option. So, IMO, we should congratulate them to have the courage to make the switch if that is how they identify and makes them truly happy."
Conservative,3dn0ss,jjlew080,0,Sat Jul 18 14:38:21 2015 UTC,"If they were truly happy, wouldn't the suicide rate of post-op transgender people drop? It remains the same.  Transgender people can do whatever they want with their bodies. But I don't think we should celebrate a biological man choosing to call himself a woman. It is a delusion. I think you make a good point that transgenderism isn't as dangerous as other mental illnesses, but that doesn't mean transgenderism should be celebrated."

I don't think anyone should be called a freak for what they believe, and I can't deny that trans people experience bullying.  As for delusion, if you are born a man, have the genitalia of a man, look like a man, but think you are a woman, isn't that the definition of delusional? We aren't afraid to call schizophrenic people delusional are we? Sometimes the truth hurts. I don't think it's beneficial to indulge people in their delusions."

I'm not sure what problem many conservatives have in understanding the distinction between biological sex and so cietally constructed gender. Sex is what you're born with, certain chromosomes dictating if you're biologically male or female. It is the gender roles and expectations in our society that make up what it means to be a man or woman, from appearance expectations to expectations involving hobbies or employment. Hence the term used nowadays is trans GENDER not transSexual. When Ben called the reporter sir, he is making an attack on the reporter's identity, refusing to acknowledge and respect the person she is trying to be. Whether or not you think she is mentally ill, it's still incredibly disrespectful to refuse to acknowledge a person the way they have worked hard to be seen as.

After working its way through a bunch of layers, the whole process could take many months before the UN inspectors get access to a place.  The idea that inspections are going to slow or prevent Iran from building a bomb is a lie."

Conservative,3dmam1,Braxo,0,Sat Jul 18 09:31:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly, this pressure was building, which is why the deal had to be made. Countries trading with Iran didn't need the sanctions lifted to know that. The Asian countries wanted cheap oil and didn't want the sanctions to last in perpetuity.   So if we can't put sanctions back in place and Iran have materially breached the agreement, which could happen if they always wait 100 days for inspections, then that means war. Maybe other countries reimposed sanctions to prevent war, but that is a card we will have to use if necessary. If not we will be walked on.  The truth is no one knows for sure what Iran is going to do. This deal was probably not the best deal the United States could have gotten, but it wasn't the worst. It's too speculative to try and say how a nuclear negotiation by a Republican would like or with another President.  What it all boils down to is that Iran better feel the pressure to keep making money. If not, the only other option is war and that would be the case no matter who is in office."

Iran has 14 days to respond to the access request. After 14 days if it's not satisfactory, then there is another 7 days where Iran is forced to resolved the concerns. They have 3 days after that 7 to make good on that.  So there is the where the 24 days comes from that we all hear.  Then, after those 24 days - the dispute process begins that are outlines in paragraph 36 and 37. The Joint Commission takes the dispute and attempts to resolve it in 15 days. (24 + 15). If any party objects to that attempt, then there is another 15 day process for the Advisory Board to resolve it. (24 + 15 + 15).

Our banking system heavily relies on mortgage securities because of how traditionally safe they were (because only people with the means to pay them received loans).  Banks all over the world bought our mortgage securities, and when people started defaulting on those loans, we finally reaped what we had sowed.

How much the country has changed shows when you look at Sanders popularity, an avowed socialist as popular as he is would have been unheard of 15 years ago no matter who it was.  I think the reason both are popular now are for the same reasons. Neither tend to back pedal statements. They both say what they mean and mean what they say. They both have a more narrow appeal in their respective parties, yet they drift into some areas that party moderates can get behind. The both speak of issues passionately that resonates with there core supporters.  I think they both show a good degree of integrity in terms of what they believe no matter how misguided they may be but for different reasons. Neither can see a good reason to change anything they say or their views, one because he is super rich and even if he isn't elected he still is a billionaire and has brought issues he cares about to the forefront, the other doesn't care about money in the first place and even if he isn't elected he has brought the issues he cares about to the forefront.

It wasn't that long ago that in everywhere but the furthest left bastions the term ""liberal"" was viewed as a horrible label to carry. That probably still has some carry over in how people self identify. I suspect many of those who called themselves moderates would by anyone conservative be seen as liberal. Self IDing cons outnumber either self IDing libs or mods each individually, but cons aren't anywhere close to a majority and the lib label is trending up.   http://www.gallup.com/poll/180452/liberals-record-trail-conservatives.aspx"

Conservative,3dm5v8,joe9439,4,Fri Jul 17 14:02:40 2015 UTC,"Not everyone spends the same though.   I'd rather get rid of all other taxes and keep a flat income tax. Everyone would pay 10-15% income tax and everyone would keep 85-90% of what they earned. Regardless of whether that is minimum wage or millions of dollars of return on an investment. A flat income tax is the best way to tax people an amount proportional to their wealth and what they can afford. Sales tax is only when you buy new goods, and property taxes vary based on where you are and your exact living arrangements. Income tax just makes more sense to me."
Conservative,3dm5v8,Andrew985,3,Fri Jul 17 14:40:53 2015 UTC,"My problem with income tax is two part:   The ability to save and invest is diminished. You can't keep your money so you're less able to save for retirement or unexpected expenses and people are more reliant on government programs. There are by necessity of the income tax a bunch of rules about figuring out how much you owe. Some groups of people get breaks because of one reason or another. It's not as easy as just ""taxing income"" when you have to do a 500 sheet workbook to figure out what in the world is going on. It also puts the government in a position to pick winners and losers. Bottom line, you're crazy if you think we can start new with the income tax and not instantly have new clauses in the tax code that say, ""You pay less taxes for x reason."" If that happens we're back to where we are now.   An income tax is by necessity convoluted and it promotes government dependency."
Conservative,3dm5v8,joe9439,3,Fri Jul 17 14:54:42 2015 UTC,"Could you give me some examples of why some people would pay less? I don't understand what situation could justify that.  When I said what I thought was ideal, I literally meant a flat income tax (let's say 15%). Meaning if you are salaried at $50K, you pay $7,500, at $100K you pay $15,000, and so on. It wouldn't matter if you are male/female, straight/LGBT, white/black/whatever, and it wouldn't matter if you were a teacher or an advertising executive.   I don't understand why this idea of a flat income tax sounds ""broken"". Can someone elaborate? If it was about savings/investing, wouldn't removing other taxes have roughly the same effect as removing income tax? In both cases you would have more money available to spend/invest."
Conservative,3dm5v8,Andrew985,3,Fri Jul 17 15:08:42 2015 UTC,"Here you go.  People are going to want to have their deductions back. Politicians like pandering to ""disadvantaged minorities"" and that can include students with student loan debt or people with health problems they caused with their own fast food habits. With any income tax you will always have deductions because people can vote and politicians buy votes. As soon as you have deductions we're no different than we are now other than getting rid of brackets. If you just say you want to get rid of brackets people will just say you hate poor people. As soon as some metrics come out on LGBT married couple employment they're going to want a deduction to make them ""equal"" when they statistically make 0.0001% less money on average or something stupid like that.  Saving and investing at the time of purchase is much different than doing at the time of earning. I don't make money and then spend it instantly and in the time between earning and spending I have the ability to invest the cash which adds liquidity to the market, fueling business, and lets me keep more of the money that I earn. I could potentially only spend money I make as profit on my investments. That's good for the economy, good for international competitiveness, good for business owners, good for people that need jobs, and good for me.  And speaking of international competitiveness, a flat tax doesn't go far enough to address this issue. As a business owner I compete with companies in international jurisdictions with a 0% income tax. This includes essentially all companies in China. If I'm being hit with 30%+ on income tax and they are paying nothing they are going to be able to outgrow me even with all costs being equal. China collects more revenue through sales based taxes than they do income taxes now and if we want to be any kind of a serious competitor to them we are going to have to follow suit."
Conservative,3dm5v8,joe9439,3,Fri Jul 17 15:27:43 2015 UTC,"See, this is where the power of ""no"" comes in.  A flat tax is a flat tax. No deductions means no deductions, and no special treatment means no special treatment. I don't get why this is difficult."

They may say something like, ""no, except for disabled babies"" because it sounds like a great exception to make. The exception creates the opportunity for more exceptions. You eventually end up with the convoluted tax code that nobody understands like we have today.  To have the power of no come into play you would have to literally have it written into the constitution in plain English. It would have to say something like ""The national income tax rate will be 10% and there will be no exemptions or deductions under any circumstances."" Even that is a lot to ask because you know it's impossible for them to write it that plainly.   How do you then account for legitimate business deductions like cost of goods sold? What about business travel and expenses? What type of business expenses can you deduct? Then we're back to having deductions again."

This would put a layer of protection between the federal government and citizens.  Sales taxes are already collected by states. It doesn't need to be VAT. Regular sales tax like we have now on sales to consumers and businesses is fine.  I agree that Democrats would try to keep the income tax and just layer another tax on top. I feel like we've got to eventually do something about the tax code though. An income tax was a bad idea when it was started and it's still a bad idea now. The US has one of the highest income tax rates in the world and we're not competitive, especially when you consider that businesses and individuals in other high tax countries are more free to move their assets to tax havens than we are in the US.

The cross country route was an option available only during early spring weather, vegetation and parasitic insects or wildlife and Mom allowing.  Admittedly one hostile wildlife encounter event ended up with me being weaponized to ensure safer journeys during our trips to lower level education in the local 'rural school'. That encounter being with a hostile skunk which may or may not have been rabid, but certainly with a bad attitude and penchant for sharing it perfumery with anyone or thing unfortunate enough to wander within range.  Sis, myself and Twiggy our ever present Beagle escort named after a famous Brit Super model of the era, finding ourselves so victimized by said skunk that day found ourselves banned from the one room institution of education and sent back home for odor removal.  Pop armed me with a 22 Remington rifle to ward off any future such encounters while traversing the 'hood'.  Taking the long gravel road route had a rather unusual characteristic associated with it as well.  While passing the three residents along that route we would have their various four legged security guards join us on our journey.  While in School Twiggy and company would hang out under the shade tree  or playground merry ground waiting for those imprisoned inside the government establishment to be released on recess and lunch furloughs, lunch being their favored occasion of course.

If we're talking true severe mental illness, what's the right way to respond?  Mocking and degrading isn't going to change the mental illness, and it's going to encourage outsiders to treat the mentally ill in ways that will only aggravate their condition.   Celebrating schizophrenia, for example, seems ridiculous, but making snide comments is definitely harmful.    If everyone believes the right answer is for him to get counseling for his mental illness, then is there any version of that where he seems courageous and respectable for doing so?  Or is he born a lesser person, with no value, that we should all mock and laugh at, and encourage each other to do so?  And the deeper question is if people are born with genetic predispositions that make them struggle minute-by-minute to achieve conformity to traditional social institutions, what is the best way to deal with that?  To tell them they weren't born that way? (You're wrong when you tell me you're schizophrenic!)  To realize they were born that way and reject them?  To realize they were born that way and to tell them we're all embarrassed for them and we're sympathetic to the fact they will always feel ashamed because they should feel ashamed forever?    I don't know.  It's interesting.  Can you have a strong society without saying some people aren't worthy of your society?   Must people be rejected and exiled and shamed to build a stronger world?   It makes sense that society must be protected from criminals.  But should we treat those who don't fit in like criminals?   Even the straightforward issue of being born a hermaphrodite - should that person hide their non-standardness because they SHOULD be embarrassed and ashamed they were born that way?   Because how they were born is some kind of threat to the rest?  I think about it a lot.  I grew up around lots of traditional, conservative families.  There were the ones who used the switch and fear and mockery and shame to keep the rules.   My family said everyone was born deserving to be treated with kindness and respect, those things aren't earned, God commands us to treat everyone as we wish to be treated.  When I acted outside of the rules, I was corrected by explaining why the rules were valuable and asked to find a way to undo any damage I did to others.  But we have Quaker backgrounds.  I think that's the war within conservativism.  Is it the Quaker way or the Puritan way?"

Tragedies and social problems in this country should not just be talking points for presidential candidates; I feel like this is a fairly obvious point.

Jesus is the Way, Truth and the Life (i.e. only way to Heaven is through Jesus)? Check. Yup, I'm a card-carrying, fundamental Christian.   Being a fundamental Muslim (which this Islamic radical preaches), means crucifying people for eating on Ramadan, jailing anyone who does not believe as they do, Sharia law, and terrorism.

Conservative,3dipoc,modifieddevice,7,Thu Jul 16 21:55:08 2015 UTC,How can these people claim it's a hoax? The doctor explains everything in plain english.
Conservative,3dipoc,xXnewbsonlyXx,8,Thu Jul 16 22:18:15 2015 UTC,"The original nine minute video released by the Center for Medical Progress (a pro-life group) accuses planned parenthood of selling fetal tissue, which is illegal, and claims to show an executive with planned parenthood disusing prices for various organs.   What has been made clear by the extended transcript that was later released is that the Planned Parenthood representative is not discussing selling the organs, but rather reimbursement for tissue donation. Women who get an abortion may donate fetal tissue for medical research and by law planned parenthood can receive reimbursement for ""reasonable expenses occasioned by the actual retrieval, storage, preparation, and transportation of the tissues"". The ""prices"" she quotes in the video is how much they are reimbursed, not how much they sell the issue for.   The initial video clearly misrepresents what is happening in the conversation in order to get attention, and so there has been a great deal of deserved backlash over that. However the backlash neglects a comment made by the Planned Parenthood representative which raises the possibility that the organization is earning a profit on the reimbursements for costs incurred as part of fetal tissue donation.    ""I think for affiliates, at the end of the day, they're a non-profit, they just don't want to -- they want to break even. And if they can do a little better than break even, and do so in a way that seems reasonable, they're happy to do that. Really their bottom line is, they just, they want to break even. Every penny they save is just pennies they give to another patient. To provide a service the patient wouldn't get otherwise.""   Obviously this is different from the initial story from the CMP (and the top story on this sub about the issue) which accused them of ""selling"" baby parts. However the possibility that Planned Parenthood representatives may be exaggerating expenses of fetal tissue donation in order to make a profit on the reimbursement is something that deserves further investigation. As of now there is little research available on the subject and whether you believe that planned parenthood representatives routinely engage in price exaggeration (the PP rep admits the possibility) or are just trying to break even (as is PP's official policy and the law) likely reflects existing biases on the subject rather than an examination of the evidence."
Conservative,3dipoc,srasmus4,4,Fri Jul 17 07:37:50 2015 UTC,"Because, it was made out that Dr Nucatola was profiteering. On the contrary, this is how tissue donation has always taken place. Even the ""better than break-even"" comment, read in context, is followed by ""every penny they save is just pennies they give to another patient"". There's no net gain there, nobody is lining their pockets with the proceeds of organ harvesting.  The original, edited video and accompanying stories are INCREDIBLY misleading. Especially the part about partial-birth abortions. That's not what they were talking about, yet the video explicitly says that they were. It was a lie. A hoax.  You can disagree with the ethics of the abortions themselves all you want. That is a different issue though. The original video was highly misleading. If you're going to try to start a sensible discussion about the merits of abortion, and resultant foetal tissue/organ donation, don't start it with a lie."

Conservative,3dipoc,modifieddevice,10,Thu Jul 16 22:57:57 2015 UTC,"While you may (and probably do) regard abortion as an evil, immoral act, it is not illegal. Also, these doctors are not conducting partial birth abortions. Late term miscarriages use the same means to remove the fetus from the womb, and often people will label it a partial birth abortion (when the fetus has already died). In the long, unedited version of the video, they discuss the organ donor research that is done with all fetal tissue where the parent consents to donate the fetal organs and tissue. They also mention that the research facilities cover the cost of the transport/processing from the hospital or PP where the donations come from.   No one is making a profit, and no one is doing anything illegal. Immoral? Reprehensible? Evil? Those are all accusations that can be leveled here, but it is all above board legally. Just remember, no one is ever arrested for being evil, only for breaking the law. Human law, that is. God's Law is something that only really exists in Muslim countries, and even then they would contend that it's not the same God."
Conservative,3dipoc,owennb,-2,Fri Jul 17 02:58:05 2015 UTC,"The video alleges that planned parenthood is profiting,the best course of action is letting whatever investigations play out and if planed parenthood is found liable or guilty in any wrong doing then i will return to gloat and carve crow for plated servings.my opinion is judging from the initial presentation of the video and transcript that this evil and they're trafficking in baby parts but that's just my opinion, let's let investigations play out."
Conservative,3dipoc,modifieddevice,-2,Fri Jul 17 09:47:04 2015 UTC,The doctor in the video made it clear that the national office could not be directly involved because if it became public they would lose big in court. The video also lists federal laws dealing with the transportation and selling of human organs being illegal. At no point in the video does the doctor state they have the consent of the mother.   Legally this is murky and will likely result in an investigation. Most likely the national office will pretend they had no part in illegal selling of human organs and let the local chapters take the fall.  At the very least this should be sufficient to strip all federal funding from the organization. We'll see though.
Conservative,3dipoc,ultimis,6,Fri Jul 17 06:27:36 2015 UTC,"The video refers to buying or selling human body parts as illegal, which is not what is being discussed in the video. She specifically says (even in the edited version) that what is being discussed is the donation of fetal tissue which should not be represented as the sale of fetal tissue. The laws mentioned in the video refer to sale and are therefore irrelevant.  Donation of fetal tissue for medical research is legal and the provider may accept ""payment for reasonable expenses occasioned by the actual retrieval, storage, preparation, and transportation of the tissues"" (Title 42 U.S. Code § 289g-2).    At no point in the video does the doctor state they have the consent of the mother.   Yes, because they edited that out of the video, in the transcript she refers multiple times to getting the patient's consent.  Here she talks about how staff time in discussing and doing paperwork for consent could be billed as part of the reimbursement for the tissue donated.    There’s who’s going to consent the patient to donate. It it’s staff, then that’s staff time, that gets figured into it, as opposed to if there’s someone that’s there, then it’s just flagging the interested or “eligible” patient and somebody else does the work.   Here she talks about how they approach the issue of donation with patients   Yea, I mean, there are obviously the patients how come in, who are asking about it from the start so it’s easy to talk about. But the others, I mean honestly, there’s not going to be one thing that works for every patient. Every patient experiences a whole wide range of emotions about the experience in general, and so you don’t know where they’re coming at from there. But I think every one of them is happy to know that there’s a possibility for them to do “this extra bit of good,” in what they do. And I think patients respond most to knowing the types of outcomes that it might contribute to, so for example Alzheimer's research, Parkinson’s research. I think most of these patients have some experience with at least one of these conditions or another. I think the ones that come in asking are the ones who have already had the experience, that’s why they come in asking. But um, I actually think it’s an easier conversation to have, than just consenting them for the procedure in general.   Here she talks about how they can't use the tissue unless patients have consented to specific studies it will be used for:   And Planned Parenthood has very strict protocols or grounds, if we’re doing a research study in general, when the different points in the consent happen. This doesn’t fall into the research bucket because it’s not a specific protocol, it’s not specific project. So, if there’s not consented for a specific project, it’s not going to an I.R.B."

Gosnell ran the Women's Medical Society abortion clinic in Philadelphia, PA and he was a prolific prescriber of Oxycontin. In 2011, Gosnell and various co-defendant employees were charged with eight counts of murder, 24 felony counts of performing illegal abortions beyond the state of Pennsylvania’s 24-week time limit, and 227 misdemeanor counts of violating the 24-hour informed consent law.

The alternative is not performing research that could save the lives of future babies... because someone thinks it's gross or something?"
Conservative,3dipoc,rainbowshine64,10,Thu Jul 16 17:17:03 2015 UTC,"Some people would argue that it's because harvesting the organs of non-consenting individuals is unethical, regardless of what those organs are being used for.

Conservative,3dipoc,UncleSlippyFist,14,Thu Jul 16 18:22:15 2015 UTC,"But they got consent from the patient who received the abortion, which is consistent with how we handle medical consent in general."
Conservative,3dipoc,rainbowshine64,11,Thu Jul 16 18:31:01 2015 UTC,"Again, this all comes down to how you define ""personhood"" and what you think about current laws concerning organ donors. Some pro-lifers might argue that you shouldn't (not necessarily that you can't) ask the parent of a child, in or out of the womb, if the organs can be used against the child's wishes. Just because something isn't against the law currently doesn't automatically make it ethical (that is, if you're discussing this from a moral, rather than legal, standpoint).  And back to your point about the patient giving permission to donate the child's organs, full consent actually hasn't been reached, in many cases, under the existing legal framework: Planned Parenthood will sometimes alter ""the timing, method, or procedures used to terminate the pregnancy"" ex post facto (in violation of the law) by using ultrasounds to more easily find the parts of the body that need to be crushed and simulating partial-birth abortions, taking out the baby feet-first (all this after the patient has signed the consent form). Planned Parenthood will go to great lengths to spin this as anything other than the grisly and morbid practice it is, but it doesn't change the reality of what they've done.  While some might argue that this is completely harmless, some providers could be incentivized by the profit opportunity that is created by this practice to farm fetuses for their organs. One bioethicist argued that women should grow fetuses in their wombs to even greater maturity, in the same way one would raise livestock, so that their organs, more developed than that of younger fetuses, could be used for medical research. I don't know about you, but that seems pretty sick."
Conservative,3dipoc,ItsMeTK,0,Thu Jul 16 20:20:33 2015 UTC,"In the video she heavily implies holding meetings at the start of the day to plan what sort of procedures to use to get the tissue/organs in demand. This before any abortions are performed and possibly even before any consent given. Even if totally legal, it's at least grossly unethical.  It's no surprise PP are saying it's not true; their team of lawyers is on the job (and referred to in the video). But the fact the media aren't properly reporting or investigating is shameful.

Although the #1 book in the politics section of the bestseller list as of right this minute is Adios, America by Ann Coulter.  #5 is by Dana Perino, #7 is by O'Reilly, and #9 is by Charles Krauthammer.  I just don't buy that they have some liberal agenda enters into it since none of the evidence supports that.    Now maybe they have a bias specifically against Ted Cruz.  That would at list fit the data better, although I don't think there's nearly enough evidence to support that idea at the moment.    Finally, and probably the best evidence that this all amounts to nothing, let's go back and look at the list for June of 2012 (I just picked a random summer week during the last election). This would be right in the heart of the lead-up to the presidential election.  The #1 book on the NY Times bestseller list is Amateur by Edward Klein with the description ""A journalist argues that President Obama is callow, arrogant and unable to lead.""  #3 is The Great Destroyer by Rush Limbaugh's brother and says ""The talk show host’s brother, a lawyer and columnist, describes the president’s “war on the Republic.""  If you go further back to July of 2011 (analogous to this month), you see books from Ann Coulter (""The columnist compares the Democratic Party to a mob."") and Glenn Beck.  I'm not seeing any evidence that the bestseller list is leaving out conservative books, even in the lead up to elections."
Conservative,3dia3w,ricker2005,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:50:53 2015 UTC,"You are making a logical fallacy there.  You are saying that the fact that some conservatives are on the list proves that other conservatives are not left out.  That doesn't follow.  The fact that Ann Coulter's books is on the list doesn't prove (or disprove) somebody else not getting on the list.  It only shows that at least some conservatives are on the list.  They could be skewing the numbers so fewer (not not none) conservative books make the list.  That would be a bias that is harder to detect (indeed if that's what they did they fooled you).  They could put resources into making sure liberal books have the maximum counts possible and conservative books have the least counts possible (aka, only check bad news for liberal books and only check good news for conservative books).  There are a whole host of ways and reasons for this to happen that is indicative of a bias."

Stopping a POTUS candidate who is conservative from having his book be recognized could diminish his reach in the election.

If it were, then how do you explain the other conservatives who have books all over the bestsellers list?    What are you implying then, that this was an oversight? And if so, do you believe this oversight would've occurred for a Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders book? Or do you think they just didn't care to do their due diligence because Ted Cruz is conservative?  Just because this doesn't usually happen doesn't mean this was just a coincidence. Not to mention, it shows the NYT original statement on why his book didn't make the list in the first place was a lie. They got caught with an egg on their face, let's not pretend otherwise."

I get that. He's a bozo. I've thought that from the start.   'Sanctuary cities' were around before Obama. In fact, the concept was being implemented before Reagan:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city  This is a local law enforcement issue. The whole tragic incident occurred as a result of local officials re-writing immigration law, and having a policy of ignoring federal immigration laws.

Roughly 20% of enrichment is required for research grade purposes and 90% is required for weapons grade purposes... they only have a 3.67% enrichment cap which is just enough for energy production. But then there are 'critics' who will scrutenize the effectiveness of IAEA in monitoring Iran; however people seem to have forgotten the IAEA is who found out about Iran's covert nuclear research in the first place lol.

And we should have gotten more. We should have had the power. We shouldn't have made a single concession.  Meanwhile, Iran got their sanctions lifted, which gives the number 1 terror sponser in the world a serious influx of cash. They can keep sponsoring terror. They keep the US prisoners. They get to keep building missiles, including ICBMs. The truth is they don't even need a nuke now. With the sanctions lifted and no real snapback sanctions in place, they can dominate the region without the help of nuclear bombs.

People keep bringing up the fraud boogeyman, but it is largely just that. A boogeyman. There are only ever a handful of cases of fraud throughout the nation. There is no need to add more hoops.

It seems odd to me that the liberals make it a bigger issue than it is to hide something else. People do commit voter fraud and there should be more controls to fight it not less to make it easier. I don't think it affects the out come but it just seems odd to me that they say its hard to get an id for minorities but they need it to do just about everything else. I would like to see how many people this would actually affect. I have a feeling it would actually be a wash when you think about how many votes are fraud and how many people would not get an id or could not to vote. It really feels like nit picking. Other countries require id to vote, its not some new idea. It seems so natural that you need prove you are you to do something like vote as you. No one ever bring up people with felonies can not vote and I actually think that seems worse than requiring an id to vote."
Conservative,3deua3,Ninjaboots,4,Thu Jul 16 03:26:59 2015 UTC,"It is an ID. Why are we making it sound like a long process?    Well, for some rare cases it can be a long process. I went about three years without ID because I lost all my documents (Birth cert. SS card, etc.) and without one, it can be difficult to get the others.   To get a state ID, you need (where I lived) 6 ""points"". The BC is 4, the SS card is one, and an insurance card counts as one was well.   The SS office wouldn't issue me a card without my BC.  I needed to go to Trenton to get my BC, a two hour drive from where I was, and I don't own a car.   I had no way to get to Trenton, so I couldn't get my BC.   I was stuck for a long time until a friend of a friend gave me a ride to Trenton.   Now, are most people in that situation? Absolutely not. But enough people are (or know someone who is/has been) that to a lot of people it seems like a very important issue.  I don't know the numbers on how many people would not be able to vote who should be able to, and I also don't know the numbers on voter fraud, but I agree that it would probably be, like you said, a wash.  EDIT: And just since race was brought up, I'm white and I had these issues. If anything it wouldn't be ""racist"", it would be discriminatory towards the poor."

Conservative,3deua3,MichMaybenot,3,Thu Jul 16 05:41:16 2015 UTC,"The trouble is, the way voter ID laws are handled are explicitly to keep minorities from voting, because they vote for Democrats. That's why you see these laws in states completely under Republican control. That's why you see early voting canceled, and voting places in minority neighborhoods shut down or having their hours cut back. Republicans know why they're passing these laws, and so does everyone else. They won't admit it, so they just throw out this canard about fraud, although the type of fraud that would be prevented by voter ID laws is pretty much nonexistent. Yes, I know you can find 2 or 3 cases where one person could have voted twice, but out of millions of votes it's huge overkill to have these rules. But it's not about stopping fraud, it's about the fact that if Republicans can't win, they cheat. They change the rules so they can win.

Of course the number of cases is low, because few have access to the records necessary to check for fraud, those who do are likely to have benefited from it, and have vested interest in perpetuating the myth that it doesn't happen.  Nonetheless, all of the liberal mouthpieces picked up on it, and are touting it as fact.  Every article I can find cites the same flawed paper.

Citing a lack of evidence for a clandestine activity as fact that the activity is not happening is, in its own right, absurd. Because the point is TO NOT GET CAUGHT. But let me keep going with the ""proving a negative.""   One cannot prove a negative. Here's an example. If I asked you to prove to me that aliens exist, you'd merely need to present to me evidence of UFO activity observed here on earth. You merely need to observe a single event. However, if I asked you to prove that aliens DO NOT exist, you would have to search the expanse of the entire universe simultaneously in order to prove that there are no aliens existing in any part of the universe at any given time. An impossible task. This is why if you ask a scientist if aliens exist, the response will be that ""we have no proof that aliens exist."" The response will not be ""aliens do not exist,"" because making such a statement is scientifically inaccurate.  Voter fraud is, in essence, analogous to aliens. In this case it's something that's potentially observable, but it is, by nature, intended to be unobservable. So, one can say ""we have no evidence of voter fraud."" However, to say ""voter fraud does not exist"" is false, because you cannot prove that it does not exist. But, it's been observed, and therefore it DOES exist.

You should be arguing that voter fraud is an exceptionally difficult crime to detect and looking to criminology literature for sources on why our current measures of it are innacurate. Instead you've argued that all crime rates are wrong because criminals don't intend to be caught, which is an issue that criminologists have been studying and coming up with ways to deal with for a long time.

It's done once at least several weeks before the first time one votes, and updated whenever one moves to a new city. Many cities offer the opportunity to register on applications for drivers licenses.  In my city, the people working the booths have a checklist of everyone who is registered to vote. It's like picking up tickets at roll call at a broadway show- you just state your name, no ID asked. It's rare, but if they tell you that someone else already claimed to be you and voted for you, then you can take your ID out to prove that the first person was an imposter. They then nullify the first vote and hand you a ballot.  Voting multiple times is kind of hard because you have to hope that the volunteers don't recognize you (or travel to different voting centers) and  also be lucky that the people whose identities you are stealing aren't voting that day..  As for voting on behalf of other people, that doesn't seem to be something that anybody cares about discouraging.

Look we have to get, beyond this ""this is what they said"" ""as I heard it"" mentality and get to the core of their argument and defeat it that way.    What needs to be said is, by requiring you to present ID at the time and place of voting I am not infringing or baring or blocking or not allowing you to vote.  You still have that right.

In reality, registration makes so that the fraudster would either have to assume the risk of the person they are impersonating showing up to contest the vote, or he would have to do his research beforehand on which registered voters are not going to show up at all.  Leaving politics and race aside, just from a design perspective, a voting system based on registration and name lists is not bad, especially since it helps increase voter participation. For example, voting can only occur for a few hours on one day, whereas buying a M-rates game can be done at any time.

Right now, Trump is our useful idiot pointing out the fact that we must control our borders and he is forcing the GOP mainstream folks like McCain to fly their true colors.  The GOP is scared shitless because the writing on the wall says we are sick of their antics and all Trump did was hang a big spotlight on it and drag a lot of attention to it.

Conservative,3dj5rh,chabanais,2,Thu Jul 16 18:17:55 2015 UTC,"The difference between a nuclear reactor and a nuclear bomb have to do with the purification percentage of the uranium or plutonium. A nuclear reactor only needs a 5% to 6% minimum to operate. A nuclear bomb needs at least a 20% purity percentage to be viable enough to explode.  The process itself is extremely difficult, separating uranium 235 from 236. One is very slightly heavier than the other, hence the repeat uses of centrifuges. With each use comes dimishing returns of purification rates.  All the monitoring systems are watching for purification attempts to go beyond 5% or 6%. If it does, that's a major red flag that needs to be closely investigated. There's simply no need to purify uranium more than that.  I guess the TL;DR version is that it takes significantly more work and effort to make a bomb than a reactor. There's a lot of over-hype about this well understood process as well as a bit of fear mongering."

The US gets none of its hostages released. The deal does not touch Iran's missile program, which presumably exists only to deliver the nuclear weapons they say they aren't building. The deal neither touches Iran's funding of international terror nor its exporting of weapons to those groups. There is no concrete inspection plan in place and no ability whatsoever to monitor the Iranian military's nuclear activity.  Perhaps the most telling evidence, though, is that America's Middle East allies, most notably Saudi Arabia, are lining up behind Israel, not the United States.  Marco Rubio said this morning that this deal exists to become a part of Obama's presidential library. It is a horrible deal that is going to make an already dangerous part of the world even more dangerous through enabling terrorism and terror states.

There was a timeline - Obama needed to get it done before the 2016 primaries got serious, which is three weeks from tomorrow with the first Republican debate.  So Iran just needed to wait and Obama would blink, and boy did he ever.  They completely played him.  Iran gets billions of dollars and in exchange we get an Iran with a nuclear program, that calls for the destruction of Israel, and that funnels rockets, bombs, and guns to Hezbollah to murder Israeli citizens.   Do liberals really believe themselves when they say this was a good deal?  Is the Teleprompter Messiah's kool-aide really that strong?  This ""scaled back"" Iranian nuclear program (if you even trust them) is essentially a pilot light.  By being allowed to keep it, how long will it take them to scale back up?  No time at all.  And when they do so, they'll be doing so with a massive army stocked to the teeth with weapons obtained after the arms embargo is lifted.  We're already only a matter of years from Iran overtly taking control of Iraq.  Once they do that, there will only be a weak, destroyed, war ravaged Syria between them and Israel."

The only reason the Cuban boycott survived for so long is because there is a big Cuban diaspora in a swing state. It was always political and never ideological.  The only thing the Cuban boycott really accomplishes is giving Canadian and European tourists a really cheap Caribbean island to vacation on.  I don't have a problem with boycotts of oppressive states, but there needs to be some consistency."

To stop limiting the freedoms of Americans to travel and buy what they please?  Because we've been doing the same thing for multiple generations and it hasn't worked at all?    Or how about because 100s of other countries allow trade and travel, which just means we are putting our own businesses at a disadvantage?  Even the EU trades with them, and no one hates the Castro types more than Europe.  Unilateral sanctions are completely pointless.  Sanctions weren't working, and continuing to starve people less than 100 miles off our coast was fucking asinine and inhumane.

Eternal or not is another question, but keep killing Americans, and we'll find out for sure how eternal having enemies can be.  ""Terrorism is like a gnat hitting an elephant""  Yeah, good insight. Except for the fact you are wrong, because those gnats are killing Americans, soldiers and civilians.  You become dead wrong once the gnat gets a major govt like Iran backing them in secret, because now your gnats can shoot down an airliner, like what happened in Ukraine. Or when the Iranians use their terrorist connections to secretly supply their terrorist gnats with something far worse then BUK M2 Rocket Launchers.  This awful deal gives the Iranian regime billions of dollars to build their asymmetric forces into something that can actively threaten our interests worldwide, including here at home.  We already know they want nukes, and this deal gives them just that, just like the North Koreans got theirs after Jimmy Carter.  We're getting a war with them anyway whether we like it or not. Don't forget, it is the Iranians choice to use terror because they hate Israel and the US.  The only question is when. The sooner the better, since once they gets the nukes WW3 here we come."

If individual companies decide they want to do business with Iran, why should the government tell them they can't?  I'm sure this won't be the end of negotiations either. It's not like any of the involved countries, or other, uninvolved countries in the region, think that the problem has been fully addressed. The deal is a tentative first step towards opening up Iran and stabilizing the Middle East."
Conservative,3ddsg8,shots-o,5,Wed Jul 15 18:18:47 2015 UTC,Not sure if you should be casting aside the advanced arms point so quickly.  What constitutes advanced arms and weapons? Certain rifles? Tanks? Missiles and rockets? Drones? Submarines?  You definitely don't want Iran to be able to project any power outside their borders and advanced weapons may allow them to do so.
Conservative,3ddsg8,Braxo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:24:04 2015 UTC,Don't they develop a lot of these in house already though? I'm on mobile so I can't source it but I believe there's an international drone watch group that states that Iran already has a drone fleet. And how effective were the sanctions to begin with at dealing with weapon shipments? I'll look more into it though. Thanks for the contribution!
Conservative,3ddsg8,shots-o,4,Thu Jul 16 00:10:10 2015 UTC,Wow. Have I got a whole bunch of bridges to sell you................
Conservative,3ddsg8,UmbrellaResearchCorp,-1,Wed Jul 15 20:23:05 2015 UTC,"You're right. Let me go with an extreme example of some other possibilities.   We stay at the bargaining table and demand that Iran entirely dismantle their nuclear program. Then, they leave the talks cause they're not totally dismantling anything, and terror groups recruit the resulting disenfranchised Iranians (who haven't benefited from lifted sanctions at all) into terror groups (not ISIS though, since Iran has already deployed aid in support of anti-ISIS forces). The resulting resurgence of terrorist activities cause Isreal to deploy the IDF to Iran to A) Forcibly dismantle all nuclear facilities and B) suppress these new terrorists. Iran, with their recently developed nuclear weapons (cause they didn't stop weapon developments at all) detonate suitcase nukes in Tel-Aviv.  That seems much better than trying to diplomatically resolve an incredibly complicated situation."
Conservative,3ddsg8,shots-o,3,Thu Jul 16 00:06:18 2015 UTC,"This is an ongoing problem, for over 30 years now, and you make it sound like there's some unexpected turn no one anticipated.  Making up 'what if' analogies without more justifying it is worthless anyway.    Many people, including Democrats, admit Iran got much more out of this than the US side.  All this agreement did was kick the can down the road.  If Iran decides to get nukes, it's no secret Saudi Arabia will follow.  That's what's at stake.  Then we can have a fun little nuclear arms race, and hope none of those governments fold.    This forgoes the significant fund increases Iran will have at their disposal, which they can use to further their middle east interests.  They've been funding those interests in Syra, with Hesbollah, and Yemen when they didn't have the money."
Conservative,3ddsg8,Roez,0,Thu Jul 16 00:50:44 2015 UTC,"So what's the correct way to deal with it? You're right. There's a lot of history between the US and Iran. We've screwed each other over a fair number of times. Hell, we overthrew their government. And they kidnapped our embassy staff. I say, give them a chance to join the international community as a peaceful stabilizing force.   If proof surfaces that Iran reniggs on their end of the their deal, let the sanctions snap back into place, and then let's consider military intervention."

Conservative,3ddsg8,UmbrellaResearchCorp,3,Thu Jul 16 00:20:15 2015 UTC,"Well you can't go right to a fixed water spot though, first you have to turn off the water. To relate this back to the deal, a big reason some would join a terror organization could be economic hardship. Sanctions increase economic hardship. So, like in your example where the water is causing the spot, removing the sanctions could be a good first step to really addressing the terror issue.   And, for the record, I don't think this is the last deal to be made regarding Iran's nuclear program. Like I said in my original post, everyone thinks there's more to do."
Conservative,3ddsg8,shots-o,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:26:46 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about? Iran will continue to support Hezbollah anyway, with or without sanctions.

You think because we're going to lift sanctions they'll sit back and be all ""Ya know, those Americans really aren't so bad after all. I think I'll quit saying ""death to America"" all the time --- I feel it's really not warranted anymore"". Bahahahahaha, is THAT what you're saying? THEY DON'T CARE.   Anyone that thinks Iran won't be violating this stupid agreement and pushing forward with their weaponized nuke program needs their heads examined.

Every Iranian I've ever ever meet has talked about how, aside from extremists (who exist in every country, let's face it), Iranians long for closer economic relationships and friendship with the greater world.   How many times have our politicians advocated military intervention in Iran? They're essentially advocating for the deaths of Iranians. Yes they're advocating it ""for the greater good"" just like the Ayatollah advocates death for his greater good.

If they start developing bombs, then the sanctions will snap back into place and then we can consider military options.    Seriously? Are you serious now? The entire point of this was to KEEP THEM from getting the bomb.   You're basically just saying ""eh, fuck it........let's just kick this can down the road a bit so that future USA has to deal with this shit"".   And that's all this crap was. Obama administration kicking the can down the road and all but guaranteeing Iran get's the bomb. All so Obama can say ""hey, look at me! I made a deal!!"". Because he doesn't give a fuck. Because when Iran gets the bomb it'll be some future POTUS's problem. He'll be living the rest of his life, protected by secret service, in some mansion, being treated like a king by the media and other organizations. He won't have to answer for anything he does right now. That's why he did it.   So really, just admit it. You really don't give a shit if Iran gets the bomb, do you?

You do realize that the inspections have to be announced 24 days in advance, right?   The US was negotiating from a position of power, and basically gave up EVERYTHING to the Iranians.   It's a bad deal. And making a bad (understatement of the year) deal in order to just ""make a deal, any deal no matter the cost"", is the hallmark of a coward, a beta male, and a weak nation. Iran is going to get the bomb now, it's basically guaranteed. And this entire administration is complicit in their efforts. Because they're just weak, utterly and completely weak.

Claiming that reddit was never intended to be a ""bastion of free speech"" has been proven to be untrue.  They did make those claims.  If they want to change their minds, then they should plainly state that they've changed their minds.  A lot of people have assumed this is about increasing ad revenue, but I highly doubt it.  They don't like that reddit has become home to some awful communities, they don't like the people who post there, and they want them off their servers.  They should have the integrity to come out and say; ""we don't like the people, we want them gone"" and be done with it.  If they want to increase revenue they should have a short video ad pop up occasionally when people click ""next page"" or ""more comments"".  I'm sure that's something they're already looking into.  Personally, I think there are subreddits that should be banned, e.g. r-rapingwomen.  As long as they have clear rules and don't ban subreddits for political speech or triggering an overly sensitive social justice warrior there shouldn't be a problem.

People who don't have access to top notch schools earlier in life will still find difficulty in getting accepted, but it will increase their chances of being able to afford college.  That said, the quality of college education is declining. The academic atmosphere at large institutions are being ran more like business than like academics. Degrees are being sold as products to students who will buy them. This is why stupid, new, and careerless majors have sprung up anew. You can even ""customize"" standard majors at many schools. Students love trendy choose it yourself stuff, because they aren't thinking of real world skills. The universities are trying to decrease overhead in the academics, and increase the student attractions. Money is poured into unnecessary services and activities in dorms to make them attractive to students. . In order to cut costs, universities have increased class sizes and provided more online courses. Hands on experience is expensive, and it is a cost that can be cut. Exams are given as multiple choice because we simply lack the grading power to give out 500 written exams to a bio 101 class. High quality labs are being replaced with cheaper alternatives that don't carry the same amount of skill. Students like it because the activities are easier to complete because they lack the same rigour; instructors hate it because we know that we are giving them a substandard education. The business model does not work well in academia. We also have been in the trend of scaring away good instructors by reducing tenure track positions and hiring adjunct instructors instead. If you had a PhD or Masters degree, would you settle for around 9000$ per semester with no benefits? Public institutions are better off viewed as an investment in future society.

The number of entrance applications would likely increase, thus making the process more competitive.  This has the potential to increase the quality of students attending these universities.  Perhaps this is a bit of a stretch, but couldn't this be viewed as providing full scholarships for these higher quality students based on their high school merits/test scores?

We, as a nation, will invest a ridiculous amount of money to let everyone have a shot at getting a degree. Where are we going to get that money?   Hell, the college I went to can't even get enough housing to support the student population as is, they are setting records of attendance every year. There's no way colleges would even be able to take them all! So what happens? You start getting new colleges left and right that basically take anyone in and will give any degree to any person, because they know whoever they take in will give them free money.

The rest of what you said would probably be correct if the proposal was for the gov to pay for everyone's tuition at any school.   That is not what is being proposed though, what is being proposed is for public state universities to be free, there is no profit motive.  Nothing about this proposal means that state schools will simply accept anyone or even lower their entry standards, in fact the opposite is likely to happen as the applicant pool increases.

Sanger was a eugenicist, as was Hitler -- and in this case, invoking Godwin's Law is entirely appropriate.  They are both responsible for the murders of tens of millions of human beings, and for the same reprehensible reason.  We should hire three or four colored ministers, preferably with social-service backgrounds, and with engaging personalities.  The most successful educational approach to the Negro is through a religious appeal. We don’t want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members. -- Margaret Sanger’s December 19, 1939 letter to Dr. Clarence Gamble  ""Birth control must lead ultimately to a cleaner race. -- Margaret Sanger, ""Woman, Morality, and Birth Control. New York: New York Publishing Company, 1922. Page 12.""  She also had one of her birth control manuals published in Yiddish so it could be distributed to Jewish immigrants as well.

Because what he is saying is what people know via their pocketbook.   If people would rather the government not be running up debt to pay for benefits then they should agree with what he is saying. You don't need to agree with his solutions to agree with his broad statement.   Maybe if he phrased it using Main St vs Wall St then his sentiments would be less frightening.    ""where we've got to move is not growth for the sake of growth but ... to a society that provides a high quality of life for all of our people,""   As I said in the other Sanders thread, he's saying that rather than only looking at GDP growth that things such as child hunger should be included when deciding on what economic actions should be taken and when measuring the health of the economy.  We've seen over the last 30 years that GDP growth doesn't always equate to better personal economy for most of the population. If we keep on using GDP growth as the goal and measure of economic success then there is no reason to believe that the results will be any better for most of the country.  If the GDP goes up but the percentage of children who fall below the poverty level also goes up then are the economic policies correct?"

Conservative,3dc740,pipechap,6,Thu Jul 16 00:55:13 2015 UTC,Sanders' comments confirm this.

For example, I am getting a mortgage. I'm doing better now than I did a year ago. My standard of living will grow if I manage my debt and expenses. Hell, interest rates are a lot better than they were when my parents started out.   On the flip side, food costs more than it did a year ago. Check out the grocery store, package sizes are smaller, cost is same or more. Bacon comes with so much added water that the pieces cook up to half their uncooked length. I expect more inflation of food prices. In that regard, I am doing worse than last year. Don't have enough knowledge of home economics to see if my parents food spend is changed since they started out.   The take home is scarcity and unlimited desires.

In a perfect world everyone that could work, would work, and the people they work for would pay them fairly out of the kindness of their hearts, and we wouldn't even need a government. But since we don't live in a perfect world, we need to make sure people who do work are compensated with a livable wage, and people who can't work, should be helped out. Will people take advantage of that? Of course. But those of us that do work will still be better off.  That being said, I don't think the federal government should be dictating a minimum wage. It should be set by local governments with some oversight. Because someone in Phoenix doesn't need to make even half as much as someone in San Fransisco to enjoy the same quality of life."

Why should people who work low level jobs be able to live off of that income? And to what extent? Should businesses be forced to scale pay according to need?  Jobs with low pay should encourage people to better themselves by getting an education, and increasing the value of their work. They should not be permanent positions.   Nobody should intend on making fast food service, or being a cashier at a retail store, their career. These should be transitional positions that rotate people in and out constantly as they move up the ladder.   If you don't pursue a higher level position elsewhere in the world, you should absolve yourself to being content with the position you're in, and the pay that you receive, and not expect to be paid more simply because you exist.

Conservative,3d9dut,3mpir3,5,Wed Jul 15 02:15:59 2015 UTC,I wasn't talking about articles.  I was talking about comments.   Speaking of garbage spam; pnwell who is a self professed paid climate propagandist posts sensationalized articles with no science at all on that subreddit. Yet they are never deleted. The guy is an obvious spammer based on the number of articles submitted to reddit each day yet he has not been banned from r/science.   I'm perfectly fine with garbage skeptical blog spam being removed. What I'm not fine with is the clear ideological hypocrisy of the mods there. Back when I used to visit the subreddit I reported those pnwell crap articles thinking the mods actually cared about science and being professional.  Instead the articles persisted and rational posts calling out the garbage article we're deleted from the comments. Essentially you were fine with crap submissions as long as it fit the political narrative you agreed with.

Conservative,3d9dut,SonySamurai75,2,Wed Jul 15 17:30:33 2015 UTC,"Are from a very biased source.   I'm curious as to how you actually determine this. Our situation here is fairly easy in this regard. Determining what's 'very biased' in something like an academic journal? Not so much. Do you just blanket approve certain academic journals because it's, well, practical?  I have personally noticed a trend in the comments myself that I'd be willing to start recording if you're so inclined. The trend being non-scientific posts that are socially left tend to stay put. Right wing ones in the same boat get nuked. If you are liberal, or if your mods are, it makes sense. It's impossible to be 100% neutral as your own personal bias will always bleed through.. regardless of how much you try. Again though this is just an observation."
Conservative,3d9dut,Jibrish,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:36:25 2015 UTC,"Generally, comments will be left alone if they contribute to the discussion at hand & stay on topic.  I cannot vouch for the automod though; which does remove the bulk of comments.  Reddit-ers do overwhelmingly lean left, and that can be seen in the comments.  I'll take a look at any comments I get PM'ed, but will only remove a comment if it blatantly crosses the line, or is off-topic.  Determining article bias really ain't that difficult, usually.  Does the link/journal/etc. come from a recognized source?  If not, does the link provide citations to any claims?  Does the source have a short/sketchy history?  If not, it will probably get flagged."

There has been no static climate outside of Michael Mann's fabricated hockey stick graph.  Among scientific minded people the majority agree the planet is warming and that humans have been a part of that warming via Green House Gas emissions.   Where skeptics come in is the actual magnitude of warmth from the CO2 forcing. Alarmists (which are a subset of scientists) rely upon a theory that there are large positive feedbacks that exceed negative feedbacks so much so that CO2 forcing is doubled or tripled.  The ""secret"" here is the amount of warming produced by CO2 is no threat to humanity. It's so small that before we notice any dangerous amounts of warming we will have long depleted all known sources of carbon fuels. This is where the unfounded positive feedback are much greater than negative.  And there is zero science backing this. All the models which failed to predict the last 15 years also assumed the above baseless theory.  So no there is no 50/50 divide outside of the political debate (which is also important when discussing ""solutions"")."

She needs to get rid of the tissue, she has patients who want to donate to research facilities, and the research facilities are willing to pay for all the costs involved in transporting the tissue. Any tissue that isn't taken by the research facility now has to be disposed of by a bio-waste management company.  What I don't know is (and this is using completely made up numbers) if the cost of the procedure is $100, the disposal is $20, and the additional cost of getting whole organs is $30, what percentage of the costs is the research facility paying? If PP doesn't have to pay for the disposal when they donate, anything above $10 make it cheaper for PP. It could be that these research facilities just cost less than the bio-waste management company."

And voting Conservative is principled, not socialistic. As a Conservative, I make decisions all the time that don't benefit me directly, but I make them based on principle. When I lost my job, I didn't take unemployment payments from the government. Why? Because I had saved wisely and didn't need it while I went to school. I'm not rich, but I don't vote to tax the rich more than they're paying now. Why? Because I don't buy into the bullshit of perpetual class warfare that the Left engages in. The top 10% already pay over 70% of all income taxes and when government transfer payments are considered, the top 20% are the only ones who pay a net amount in taxes. I'd say they're paying their ""fair share"" already.  So go ahead and continue to be selfish and vote only at what benefits you directly. It's that kind of thinking that killed the auto and steel industries in America. It's what's killing Greece right now.

Also, Mexico and many other nations do not, and would not reciprocate such treatment of labor so the ""free-market"" would ONLY apply to the US, even though the economy is interconnected globally. It'd be a one way street.  You have to weigh the positive and negative externalities of such policy. Do you want more crime in exchange for labor mobility?

Conservative,3d9ja2,Methylendioxy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:09:42 2015 UTC,"You bring a fair point, adaptation is incredibly important. But you see, a conservative form of government allows for the rapid adaptation of the social system. It not only allows, but fosters innovation in economic, technological, and social areas of issue.    The world works the way that we make it work. This realization is the beauty of the American experiment. We want the world to work as a peaceful, and constantly advancing place. So how do we do this? Obviously we need to be able to learn more, and to innovate. In order to do this we need to have a system that fosters that. A free market system fosters innovation, and in this system innovation is not in the hands of the government, but the people who are infinitely more effective than the government. Look at history. We have had this system and it is proven that when we prosper because of it, so does the whole world. And as the rest of the world develops the process only continues, and it continues exponentially at that.    The only time that the process is stopped in this situation is if these nations build a form of government that discourages further advancement. For that just look at Russia or China or certain southeast Asian countries, or even European countries at that."

Conservative,3d9ja2,Minimum_Use,-1,Wed Jul 15 02:04:49 2015 UTC,"You clearly haven't lived in Europe...  ... and it's not cheaper. You're paying higher taxes to cover it. My German friends always complained about half their check going to government... then having a 19% VAT (value added tax) to everything they bought, paying about $10/gal for gas, $300+/mo for oil to heat their house in winter, and on and on. EVERYTHING is taxed there and taxes highly at that.  With all those taxes, countries are still going broke in Europe. Greece was the first, and there's many others on the verge of financial collapse.    It's not the utopia many here make it out to be. It's not horrible by any means, but our (intended) system works much better. It only gets messed up when government steps in, creates market distortions and then tries to blame higher prices caused by said market distortions on the free market in order to seize more control of the market."
Conservative,3d9ja2,Aenemia,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:09:48 2015 UTC,"I live in Austria so I think I can expand on your points. VAT is 20% here for some goods, others are taxed at 10%, it does seem like a lot but if you compare cost of living in a major city in Europe with a major city in the US the difference is negligible (certainly not 20% increase).  I pay 22% tax + social security, have had several complicated medical issues that required surgery and neither me or my parents have ever had to pay for anything (even glasses). But what's more important is the fact that there is no worry about your well-being. I get that in the US if you work a decent job the insurance you get is pretty good and out-of-pocket cost is low but what happens if you get fired and in between jobs something urgent comes up? The pressure on the individual to be employed during all his life is not worth of a free nation in my opinion. Shit happens, nobody should have to worry about their health, it's basically the right to live. Also I would wonder how much money from expensive ER last-minute treatments could be saved if everyone received free preventive treatment which is much cheaper, especially for hospitals. Next on the list: I do not know in what kind of mansion you have to live to pay 300€/m for heat. In my 120m2 apt. I pay 70. As for the gas price, distances are much shorter in Europe generally so people don't actually spend that much more since they drive less. For cities your point stands but in cities usually the public transport is superb and nobody needs a car anyway.  I know this is an unpopular opinion here but I wanted to present the facts as an EU insider."
Conservative,3d9ja2,Methylendioxy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:23:18 2015 UTC,That's what we were charged when we lived out on the economy for oil by many landlords... but we were charged way more for rent than most Germans would pay for rent on an equivalent property. The landlords knew what the U.S. Would give us for a rent stipend and charge that amount.   I just know from living in the U.S. and Europe that it was much more expensive in Europe (particularly Germany) and my German friends always complained about having about 50% of their check going straight to government.

Conservative,3d9ja2,Aenemia,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:36:20 2015 UTC,"No problem, if that is what you encountered so be it. For very high income families it is possible that close to 50% (although maximum is 45% I think), go to the state. For people with a more moderate income the situation is much less dire. Also social security tops out at 840€/month maximum, nobody pays more than that regardless of their income. Didn't wanna bash your post just give some insight that what we get in return for the taxes is well worth it and most people realise that."
Conservative,3d9ja2,Methylendioxy,2,Mon Jul 20 15:23:49 2015 UTC,"Right, but from my perspective as a freedom minded individual, the tax being ""worth it"" is irrelevant. The way I see it, that is my money and the government should have no claim to it. I should be able to spend it as I see fit. If I want to help the less fortunate, I can. If I want the best insurance, I can buy it. If I want no insurance, I should t have to pay for it. It's not the government's role to tell me how, when, and where I spend my money... and it is most definitely not their right to take my money by force and spend it for me."

Conservative,3d9ja2,Methylendioxy,-1,Mon Jul 20 18:51:24 2015 UTC,"It still makes him a socialist. But if you want to argue healthcare. Europe is largely subsidized by the United States in the form of Defense, Medical Breakthroughs, and large trade. If the United States were to adopt a similar system the large cost of healthcare would strangle the country, which would mean a down sized military and a screeching halt to medical innovation. Which means Europe would find itself in a tough spot."
Conservative,3d9ja2,ultimis,2,Mon Jul 20 20:00:59 2015 UTC,"In what ways are the European medical system subsidized through us? I'm honestly a little skeptical at that point.  I will concede that the cost of a (what I think to be) significantly improved/cheaper-for-the-individual/simpler healthcare system might come from our defense budget. We have enough soldiers and arms to effectively wage a war against most of the world, which to me, seems ludicrous.   Furthermore, a reduced military wouldn't really hurt us all that much right now, since we aren't sending boots on the ground in the middle east. Our only other possible threats at the moment are north korea, to which we lend a small force in the DMZ, and Russia, who is currently encroaching in Georgia. Should we have to fight Russia, It would not be just us sending troops. The EU/UN/any good samaritan nation would come to the aid of the occupied nation. Russia. My point is that, even with a reduced military, the world would not simply plunge itself into chaos."
Conservative,3d9ja2,Minimum_Use,6,Wed Jul 15 01:11:41 2015 UTC,They don't have to spend much on defense because we have a large presence in Europe still as a result of WWII treaties which saves them money.
Conservative,3d9ja2,Aenemia,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:40:35 2015 UTC,"In what ways are the European medical system subsidized through us?   Pharmaceutical innovation in the U.S. is taken up by these socialize healthcare systems and sold for much cheaper costs as generic knock offs. Our healthcare costs are so high because we front the bill for these medical break throughs.  A socialized healthcare system which Bernie Sanders would like would strangle these companies from being able to innovate and we would likely see little innovation from Universities that receive grant money to research it.   We have enough soldiers and arms to effectively wage a war against most of the world, which to me, seems ludicrous   The U.S. has maintained the ability to wage two simultaneous wars at one time (similar to what we found ourselves in during WW2 against Japan and Germany). This allows us to create stability throughout the world as any wanton aggression can easily be responded to by U.S. forces. Again subsidizing Europe as a lot of these countries barely maintain a military anymore because they know the U.S. has their back. These countries would suddenly find themselves defenseless with the down sizing required to pay for a Socialized Healthcare System.   Furthermore, a reduced military wouldn't really hurt us all that much right now, since we aren't sending boots on the ground in the middle east.   Ramping up a military is hard. Military Acquisition programs take over a decade to get off the ground. So you have to be proactive in military assets and requirements else you will find yourself ill prepared ot meet the challenges of the next decade.  On top of that if you reduce the number of enlisted personnel you essentially will require the return of the draft. As when a large war breaks out you won't have the numbers to respond. The military hates the draft as these people are untrained and don't want to be there. There is also a ramp up time for a draft as you need them to have at least basic training before being able to deploy them in war.   Our only other possible threats at the moment are north korea   A lot can change in a decade. Especially if the U.S. can no longer project power around the globe. A power vacuum allows other countries to attempt to fill the void. China might seem harmless now, but if they decide they want control of the entire South China sea, those countries will have no ability to stop them on their own. Countries will valuable resources such as oil might become hot beds of war and bloodshed more so than they already are. Trade stifled you start to see prices across the board go up as goods/energy are less reliable.    The EU/UN/any good samaritan nation would come to the aid of the occupied nation.    The UN is made up of all countries. Some countries have a veto (such as Russia). So if it suites their interest to have a country be occupied by one of their regional allies, they will veto any UN action. NATO is made up of 90% U.S. forces. Europe only provides token forces for any NATO action. Again we are subsidizing their military and defense. When Libya was a problem for Europe (not for us). They demanded the U.S. to take military action. We had no personal interest in Libya, but since Europe could not do the job themselves we stepped up and did it for them."

We've seen over the last 30 years that GDP growth doesn't always equate to better personal economy for most of the population.

The knowledge gained is for the public good which is why such grants exist.  There was an observable trend (homosexual females have a greater likelihood of being overweight than homosexual males). Science seeks to know ""why?"". Finding out may lead advancements in medical practice and pharmaceuticals. We may find a closer correlation between hormone 'X' and body attribute 'Y' which means you should medicine 'A' over 'B' to reduce risk 'C' on procedure 'D'.  The more relations we observe and understand, the more our world opens up to us.  Is there government largess? Of course. But I see the benefit in defending the sciences and general research. My critique is that often the journals get put behind an additional paywall when they should be made free to the public since we did foot the bill for it."
Conservative,3d8yn7,xxPhilosxx,3,Tue Jul 14 14:49:44 2015 UTC,"Well in addition to this, there is a budget for research, no matter the level this was conducted on. The tax payers are paying this money anyway, the only difference is the research it's used for. If people have a number of other studies they themselves would like to get underway and are being denied grants to do so then I could understand the frustration.  Also, the author of this article points out that domestic violence is also a big issue in same sex relationships and that it ""receives very little attention at all."" However, since the obesity rate is much higher than the domestic violence rate (75% to 35.4% respectively), I don't understand why that's not the more valid issue to study?"

If they don't use the money for one particular study, they'll either just use it for something else or roll it over.   Plus, how could you possibly determine if this study is worthwhile before anything has come or not come from it? If you want to get mad about what studies are being done, I can assure you there are plenty that focus on way more meaningless stuff. Hell, grant research goes into studying geometry still. I mean, it's not your middle school stuff, but it's still intangible, esoteric geometry that doesn't have many implications except proving mathematical concepts and the occasional addition to something in theoretical physics."
Conservative,3d8yn7,Douglas-MacArthur,3,Tue Jul 14 20:24:52 2015 UTC,And exactly why is it the governments job to decide what studies are worthwhile?
Conservative,3d8yn7,JackBond1234,0,Tue Jul 14 22:28:08 2015 UTC,"The government itself doesn't decide and I don't think I ever said that it did. The government allocates money to institutions that bundle the money into grants. If you want to research something, as long as it doesn't require special permissions (like animal testing or handling dangerous/otherwise illegal materials), you can research it. However, without grant money you would have to fund the research from your own pocket, which is usually pretty difficult unless you are rolling in cash. Thus, you apply to an institution (usually, you have to be associated in a certain way with that institution, such as a professor for a college) for a grant.   That institution makes the final decision where the money goes and why."
Conservative,3d8yn7,Douglas-MacArthur,3,Tue Jul 14 23:02:37 2015 UTC,And who is authorizing this institution to make these decisions with my money?

Conservative,3d8yn7,Douglas-MacArthur,2,Wed Jul 15 00:21:54 2015 UTC,"It is my money. I earned it and I did not give permission to have it taken from me. And I did not authorize it to be spent on frivolous experiments.  I acknowledge that this is the way it is, but whatever you're calling democracy gives power to the citizens in name only."
Conservative,3d8yn7,JackBond1234,0,Wed Jul 15 00:38:34 2015 UTC,"You do give permission to have it taken from you, though. When you get paid the money you earn, by working in the United States, you pay a certain percentage. Then when you buy things you also give permission by paying sales tax. If you own property you also give permission by directly paying taxes on it. It's the way every government works, and you can't really have a functioning country without it.  In order for every citizen of the United States to specifically choose what their tax money went towards, they would all need just about every masters degree there is, study every field of everything, and have extensive political knowledge to understand how it all fits together and functions properly.   Not to mention, the portion of your tax dollars that goes towards all research in general is insanely minuscule. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (which is the department that is the umbrella to the NIH) gets about 2% of the federal budget annually, while Social Security,  Welfare, and the DoD get 50%, each alone have a roughly equal thirds of that. If you made $100,000 last year, you payed 2 cents for this research, but you payed $5,000 for Social Security.  If you wish to choose what your taxes are spent on, or not pay taxes at all, I invite you to start your own country."

Prior to the Obergefell decision, gays were able to get married, even in states where marriage was defined in the traditional sense. They could have the priests, the bridesmaids, the church ceremony, the vows, the wedding cake, and call their same-sex partner whatever they wanted. They could live with them, raise children with them, and spend eternity with them without fear that an officer would someday slam down their door and arrest them for being in a committed same-sex relationship. All Obergefell did was extend an already flawed, government-controlled franchise to even more groups, ramping up enforcement of police powers against insurance companies and hospitals.

Conservative,3d9cht,PhilosoGuido,-6,Tue Jul 14 20:25:43 2015 UTC,"This Iran deal might actually help stop them from getting a bomb, and promote westernization and assimilation of a historic enemy.  We should oppose it anyway.  Personally, I think the Iran deal is a good one.  Though eventually reducing the arms embargo is troubling, Iran hasn't actually demonstrated itself to be a viable threat.  The ""death to america"" chants are rhetoric, and are just a scapecoat for their economy, crippled due to the US sanctions.  Iran does not have a history of behaving irrationally, we have no reason to suspect they would randomly attack their neighbors (and Israel would wipe the floor with them if they tried).  We should oppose the deal anyway, for political purposes.  Before the sanction relief becomes law, we get the chance to vote it down in congress.  With a majority in both houses, along with sympathetic democrats, we can pass a bill that stops the sanction relief.  Obama will veto this bill, forcing us to find a 67 vote supermajority, which we wont get.  The bill will pass, sanctions will be lifted, and Iran will join the international community.  We get to claim 100% opposition to the bill though, giving Democrats ownership of the agreement.  This costs us very little, and gives us a potentially huge talking point down the line:  If anything goes wrong, if Iran messes up in the littlest way, it falls squarely on the Democrats and helps further tarnish Obama's (and Hillary's and Kerry's) international diplomacy legacy.   Tl;dr: We lose nothing from opposing it (even though it might be a good deal) and stand to gain a giant political talking point (""Democrats are bad at international policy"") if it ever breaks down.  edit:  Are the downvotes in response to my optimism for the deal itself, or for my thoughts on why we should oppose the deal anyway?"
Conservative,3d9cht,ZandreTheGiant,-1,Tue Jul 14 17:09:49 2015 UTC,"Wow, what a warped, misguided, unprincipled view. First, the deal is horrible. Let's look at the specifics:   Iran gets to keep centrifuges.  They can continue to enrich and stockpile reactor grade uranium which is about 80% of the work to get weapons grade, allowing for a quick breakout to a bomb. They can restrict inspections of certain military facilities.  They don't have to reject terrorism They can continue developing a breeder reactor for Plutonium which is easier to miniaturize and weaponize than uranium They can continue developing ICBMs, which are to hit us not Israel or Europe (which they can already hit) They get immediate relief of sanctions  They get lifting of the arms embargo and now access to advanced S-300 surface to air missiles from Russia The ""snap back"" sanctions will be blocked   This is probably the worst deal in history. It will probably mean Saudi Arabia acquiring nukes to defend itself. Israel will be much more likely to be forced into attacking Iran. Iran will not become more westernized. There is nothing in the deal to suggest that except your Pollyannish notions."
Conservative,3d9cht,PhilosoGuido,6,Tue Jul 14 18:43:35 2015 UTC,"We seem to be reading different agreements.  Here's where I'm reading from.   Iran gets to keep centrifuges.   Centrifuges reduced by 75%, and only the oldest, crappiest ones they have.   They can continue to enrich and stockpile reactor grade uranium   Uranium stockpiles reduced by 98%.  Cannot enrich past 3.67%.   They can restrict inspections of certain military facilities.   Inspectors from IAEA will continuously monitor Iran's declared nuclear sites and also verify that no fissile material is moved.  Iran can make it difficult to visit military sites, but an independent arbitration panel has the final say (this is a concession, sure, but they would never give unrestricted access to all their military bases, no government would ever allow that).   They don't have to reject terrorism   Neither does Saudi Arabia.  Also irrelevant to the negotiations.   They can continue developing a breeder reactor for Plutonium which is easier to miniaturize and weaponize than uranium   Arak heavy water reactor to be redesigned so it cannot produce weapon-grade plutonium.  Iran not allowed to construct additional heavy-water facilities.   They can continue developing ICBMs, which are to hit us not Israel or Europe (which they can already hit)   So what?  They have a right to develop a conventional weapons program.  Does this frighten you?  Launch an ICBM at the US, see what happens.     They get immediate relief of sanctions   Sanction relief starts 4-6 months after verification of compliance.   They get lifting of the arms embargo and now access to advanced S-300 surface to air missiles from Russia   See above.   The ""snap back"" sanctions will be blocked   By who?  If they aren't complying sanctions turn back on, no questions asked.  .  Im not trying to be a dick, but basically nothing you said here is true... I shared my source, could you share yours please?"

Conservative,3d707w,Neon-Knight,8,Tue Jul 14 15:00:58 2015 UTC,"Did you read the article?    The structural problem in health care is the use of insurance for routine care. Comprehensive insurance has been stretched to cover the kinds of routine medical visits that could easily compete in a direct-to-consumer billing environment. In part, that has evolved from the insurers themselves in competition for corporate plans, but also because of state mandates on coverage. A reform that encourages insurers to focus on hospitalization and serious illness, plus restructuring family practice through HSAs and true price signaling, would solve multiple problems, chief among them a shortage of family practitioners. Thanks to the overhead of dealing with insurers and a lack of competitive impulse in a price-setting environment, more and more doctors are choosing other fields. Retail clinics where doctors don’t have to spend inordinate resources dealing with insurers would lower costs through competition and a larger market pool.    I thought this was the meat and potatoes of it.  Install a system with some kind of price feedback to consumers for routine care and allow for insurance to cover more significant medical procedures.   This is also an opinion piece so the author isn't going to go into detail on what his alternative would be."

However, the result is giving Iran, the world's biggest exporter of terrorism, billions of dollars, plus the lifting of sanctions. There are also many loopholes that allow Iran to build the nuclear weapon like military bases that are off hands to inspectors and a 14 day response period between a request for inspection and a response from Iran (enough time to move the bomb somewhere else, maybe?)"

As embarrassing as it is to admit, I think I'm in the same boat. I've heard the phrase, almost verbatim on many cable news networks (CNN, etc.) and of course its people with the state department or experts in the field that claim Iran to be the largest state sponsor of terrorism.   So, I did some Googling and here's what I think. Being the ""largest state sponsor of terrorism"" means that of all the states that sponsor terrorism, Iran is the largest and most powerful. This doesn't mean that Iran is necessarily contributing huge amounts to terrorism around the world, just that it is the most successful among the ones that do, like Russia to a certain extent, Pakistan, etc. Iran has and probably continues to support Hamas and Hezbollah. The Wiki has a lot more information on Iran's support of terrorist networks and activities.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_and_state-sponsored_terrorism  I haven't found a source that officially names Iran as the #1 state supporter of terrorism (except for the state dept. sources and experts on TV networks that I mentioned), but Iran definitely has and continues to seek the destabilizing of the Middle East by supporting terrorist networks."

In the Netherlands a law was actually passed that says all State owned buildings/parks/etc only have information available in Dutch.  No more English.  Also, I've heard the direct link of Heroin and other hard drug trafficking is linked to visitors from Africa.  Each country knows that when they see an influx of visitors from Africa they are going to see more Heroin.  If our border states point this sort of thing out - more illegal immigration from Mexico to a particular state means more crime - but that's Xenophobic.

Right now, what is stopping Iran from making a nuclear bomb?  As far as I can tell, there is literally nothing, aside from the threat of military force (am I right about this?).    Isn't any deal where they agree to halt nuclear bomb production better than the current state of affairs, where they can make nukes whenever they want to?"
Conservative,3d8s2a,ZandreTheGiant,4,Tue Jul 14 16:10:45 2015 UTC,"Some argue that the deal doesn't go far enough and the better route to take is to increase sanctions until they are willing to agree to having zero centrifuges, no nuclear material at all and to stop supporting terrorism in the middle east. Some think they should go even further and make nice with Israel.   The counter argument is that nothing short of war would make that happen and increasing sanctions would make them more dangerous and more determined to be a nuclear power so they could use that as leverage and the world would either have to allow it or go to war to prevent it."

Conservative,3d8s2a,ultimis,0,Tue Jul 14 19:20:53 2015 UTC,"The right to defend ourselves stops when we start attempting to indict people on what we fear they might do instead of what they are actually doing.  Iran has agreed to give up 98% of its stockpile, its agreed to IAEA searches of all its nuclear facilities and to keep an inventory of unrefined nuclear elements; and the sanctions have a snap back clause in case of the conditions of the agreement are violated.  And before anyone compares this to N. Korea please keep in mind that Iranians are not anywhere near as isolated as N. Koreans. Iranians have a sense for the world at large and yearn to be part of the international community because there are real financial incentives for them if they do."
Conservative,3d8s2a,Mosetsfire84,2,Tue Jul 14 20:18:45 2015 UTC,"You are all over this sub with your shilling for this Obama deal. Let me explain if you care to be educated. Iran has demonstrated that they have the technology to enrich Uranium to weapons grade. They have a significant stockpile that could be weaponized in a matter of weeks to months. But they don't want a couple of gravity deliverable bombs, they want an entire program with the ability to strike anyone on the planet within 30 minutes, like the U.S. Russia and China have. The problem is that they can't miniaturize the weapons and their delivery methods (ICBMs) are crude. So, they need plutonium, which is easier to miniaturize and put on an ICBM. All this takes time and they are worried that Israel, Saudi Arabia, or a future U.S. president with a spine will take out their program militarily before they can achieve these goals. This deal buys them time and gives them legitimacy and the protection of the international community.   The deal is a total give away. It gives them the ability to preserve their infrastructure and continue their research while being essentially immune from attack. Any attack would be in bad faith against a reformed country trying to rejoin the community of nations, not on a rogue nuclear terrorist state. They will cheat, they will play shell games to hide their elicit actions, and if/when caught cheating, it will take months of international wrangling to get sanctions back in place and even more to get any UN/international approval for force. They will stall and feign compliance then on their terms, kick out all inspectors and declare themselves a nuclear armed state and dare anyone to do anything about it. Then it will be too late. It will be mutual assured destruction like with the Soviets except this is a radical apocalyptic theocracy who doesn't mind strapping bombs to children. They may be out gunned 1000 to 1 in nuclear arsenal but they will have the advantage of being crazy enough to actually push the button. They will be immune from the fate of Saddam or Qadaffi. They are playing the long game, and Obama and his useful idiots are looking at the next few years."

Instead of freeing people who committed something that was a bona fide crime we should work on changing the game so we don't lock up even more people over substance. Drugs are a waste of time and terrible for your physical and mental health but I don't want my money spent on keeping them away from adults determined to get them. I also want their distribution taken away from ruthless criminals and turned over to a system that will check IDs and keep them away from my children. Lastly I want law enforcement that tries their hardest to solve violent crimes and property crimes instead of inflating their arrest numbers with useless revolving door drug arrests that do nothing to really protect the life and liberty of the majority.

I don't think the game was ever even released. Just a couple of animation videos on the site http://www.heradventure.com/  Feds Give $100K to Fund Video Game Featuring Feminist Climate Change Superhero  We’re Getting A Social Issues Video Game Featuring A Black Female Superhero, Courtesy Of The U.S. Government   The National Endowment for the Arts is funding a new interactive game from filmmaker and digital media artist Ayoka Chenzira, Ph.D. It’s called HERadventure, a science fiction-based, multimedia platform project intended to target women 18-25 with the aim of bringing awareness to social issues affecting women like depression, discrimination, or pollution. The star of the project is HER, a black female superhero from another planet.  Inside Spelman asks, “What would happen if the societal issues affecting women put other planets at risk?” The answer is HER, the superhero created by Chenzira. Spelman College was recently awarded a $100,000 grant from the NEA to pursue HERadventure and one of four nonprofit organizations to receive a grant for a gaming project.  “We knew that people were making and consuming art in new and different ways and thought it important to support that art making as well as that art experience by the audience,” Alyce Myatt, director of media arts for NEA told Inside Spelman. She said the review panel was impressed with Chenzira’s proposal especially because they planned to “address social issues and was international in scope.” Chenzira said it was inspired by her sense that “what we do on Earth impacts the universe − not just pollution destroying the ozone layer, for example, but our thoughts and how we organize gender roles and social systems also have impact.”  Inside Spelman explains the premise:  “We knew that people were making and consuming art in new and different ways and thought it important to support that art making as well as that art experience by the audience,” Alyce Myatt, director of media arts for NEA told Inside Spelman.

Inside Spelman writes that according to Chenzira, “Students involved in the next phase of development will work with women’s studies, sociology and art scholars who will consult on the project. They will also have an opportunity to create alongside artists who use filmmaking, 3D animation and computer programming as part of their respective medium.”  The plan is to release HERadventure on International Women’s Day this year, (2013) March 8."

Conservative,3d517g,metaltrite,8,Tue Jul 14 07:12:21 2015 UTC,"Because it's an investigative study. The question they seek to address is not ""How can we make obese lesbians better"", it's ""Why are lesbians more prone to obesity than other demographics in the first place?"".  I know, it doesn't sound like a huge difference, but it can be a vitally important one. We just don't know until it's been thoroughly scrutinized, that's the pain of not knowing exactly what you're looking for.   To give a famous example, consider Edward Jenner and the invention of the modern vaccine. Instead of sticking directly to the more intuitive ""How do I solve the issue of smallpox"", he noticed and investigated the odd tendency of milkmaids at the time to not come down with smallpox nearly as often.  That investigation brought him to notice that it was specifically the milkmaids who had previously been infected with cowpox who demonstrated this resistance (this was all before germ theory, mind you, so it was far less obvious then than it is now), which led him to conclude that being inoculated with the far less dangerous cowpox might help prevent the development of smallpox, ultimately leading to the single largest amount of human lives saved as a result of any invention in all of known history.   It's a journey, no doubt. One with many dead ends and often little immediate applicability, but that's the reason why it's important that this be a role delegated to government; because corporations do not expend resources on lines of research without a forecasted return on investment within a relatively immediate timeframe.  Back just before the Space Race, for example? Nobody would have invested in rocketry in any but the most tangential way, it was seen as a dead end as far as profit was concerned. Look shortly after the Space Race, however, and suddenly everything from satellite imagery to GPS networks and global telecommunications are all valid fronts for venture capitalism, which in turn evolved to the major industries and everything dependent on them that we know today. That all simply wouldn't have happened without a huge amount of government research."

Conservative,3d517g,FleetSevens,9,Tue Jul 14 03:33:51 2015 UTC,Here's the conclusion taken from the actual NCBI website.  Correlates of overweight and obesity among lesbians and bisexual women are generally comparable to those observed in studies of heterosexual women. Evidence that lesbians' higher BMI is associated with higher levels of fitness is not supported.  What waste of money.

Conservative,3d517g,Vulamond,10,Tue Jul 14 00:26:32 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty small thing, in the overall budget. The $3.5 million is the total amount spent since 2011. In FY15 it received $658,485. The project is scheduled to be completed in 2016.  The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, which funded this project received $1,283,487,000 for just FY15. That 658k represents just 0.05% of the institute's funding.  The institute received $1.2B in funding, which represents approximately 0.1% of the overall FY15 budget. So this study we're talking about cost 0.0005% of the taxpayer's money.  Is it a study conducted with dubious purpose? Sure. And it should probably have never been approved. But let's maintain some sense of perspective here. If we want to talk budgetary items, let's talk about the more substantial expenses."

Conservative,3d5vlf,iswantingcake,6,Tue Jul 14 05:18:44 2015 UTC,"I'll explain it to you.   Conservatism is concerned with the preservation of order and the principal institutions which uphold and secure that order. Things like national sovereignty, rule of law, and security of the citizenry to pursue a peaceful and prosperous life have a place of significance in the hierarchy of conservative ideals. These are a prominent article of the contract between the government and the people, from whose consent their power is derived.   When the government fails in or refuses to perform its duties, it's in breach of this contract, and we get a myriad of unwanted results such as this. Criminal illegal aliens constitute a significantly high percentage of our prison population, and are represented as a disproportionately high percentage of their demographic. This is not really a surprise as Mexico is a failed narco state, both corrupt and violent. Their patriarchal machismo permeates their culture, and drug lords and cartel bosses are their modern day folk heroes.   The free roam of such people represents a clear and present threat to the well being of our lawful citizenry, and represents a systemic failure of American immigration control which demands correction."

One is something that happens about 12 times a year (mass shootings)  The other is a group of 11 million people from third world countries that commit about 2.2 million instances of crime over a 7 year period, including 25,000 instances of homicide over that same period.

Conservative,3d4cvw,Vzninja,36,Tue Jul 14 05:00:28 2015 UTC,"The rise in prices correlates directly with the minimum wage – now set at $15 – which were increased by 14.4% to match the 14% elevation in pay.   They're raising their prices by a higher percent than their labor costs increased? Did the other expenses of the business somehow increase more?  Edit: I checked the source article.    William Blair's Sharon Zackfia said in a client note Monday that the popular Mexican fast-casual chain jacked up prices across the board by 10.5% on average in San Francisco, with beef entree prices up 14.4%, large soda up 11.1%, chips up 10.3%, and water up 10%.  ""We believe the outsized San Francisco price hike was likely because of increased minimum wages (which rose from $10.74 per hour to $12.25 on May 1) as well as scheduled minimum wage increases in future years,"" Zackfia said in the report.   So the price increases weren't 14.4% across the board, and the wage increase wasn't 14% of total labor costs, but rather 14% of their minimum wage labor costs.  For these numbers to make sense on their own (and maybe there's been a big spike in supply costs or something, but I doubt it) this would have to be in anticipation of minimum wage increases that will come years down the line."

Conservative,3d4cvw,fizzy88,3,Tue Jul 14 02:28:27 2015 UTC,"There's so many other things that companies have to pay for that you aren't accounting for.  Minimum wage isn't just going up for Chipotle employees, but the entire infrastructure that serves chipotle. Truck drivers, laborers, farm workers, etc. will ALL be paid a higher wage. Higher wages for these different services mean these companies are ALL paying more wages and subsequently higher taxes which means they are charging Chipotle (and related businesses/services) more money because they have to make up the higher costs somewhere.   Chipotle has to charge more money to make up for their higher labor costs (and the associated higher payroll taxes (social security, Medicare, local, state and federal taxes, unemployment, the list goes on and on and on)) AND for all their infrastructure costs, which includes all related services/businesses."
Conservative,3d4cvw,co_radio,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:22:12 2015 UTC,"Right. So assuming that Chipotle in SF was paying all of their workers the previous minimum wage, and now has to increase wages to $15 for all of their workers, this would amount to a 3.5% total increase in expenses. This is not enough to explain the price hikes, and there are likely other factors involved, like supply problems or the fact that property and rental costs are becoming absurdly expensive in SF. Whatever the case, the article's claims are flawed, or at best incomplete.  And by the way, in none of those articles is it mentioned what Chipotle workers are actually paid. It is being assumed that they are paid minimum and so wages must rise. While it is likely that many employees are paid close to minimum, I doubt that this is the case for all employees, like managers for example."
Conservative,3d4cvw,Urbanscuba,-1,Mon Jul 13 22:06:40 2015 UTC,"this would amount to a 3.5% total increase in expenses.   No, not fucking true at all. It isn't just wages that go up when wages increase. Chipotle now has to pay a higher contribution to social security. The cost of their benefits, which are based on wages, has gone up. The cost of any payment they make for unemployment insurance has gone up. There's a lot more here than just the money that goes in the worker's pocket.  Now what about the poor fucker who owns the business that delivers shit to Chipotle? His costs have gone up too, so he's increasing prices on the services he provides...and so on and so on.  EDIT: You fucking shit for brained morons can downvote this all you want. The impact of an increase in wages goes far beyond the actual increase in pay to employees. It's a proven fucking fact."
Conservative,3d4cvw,chabanais,-1,Tue Jul 14 00:28:38 2015 UTC,"Chipotle's direct costs go up 3.5%  Chipotle's delivery driver's cost go up by ~5%, which increases Chipotle's costs by 5% of their food's cost. So we're talking 5% of 30% An extra 1.5% to total cost  And the food the driver delivers goes up by ~5%, so you're increasing the driver's cost by 5% of 30%. So an extra 1.5% which is added to the driver's costs, so now Chipotle is paying an extra 6.5% of THEIR 30%. Chipotle's total costs are now 1.95% higher instead of 1.5%, nearly negligible, especially when you could definitely see 2% increased sales from people having more spending money.  You get dramatically diminished returns on the stacking effect, your supplier goes up by a bit, but the effect your feel from his suppliers is negligible.  What raising the minimum wage does is simply elevate the quality of life for the lowest earners at the expense of consumers at large. The secret is that when you go from earning $7 or $9 bucks an hour to $11 you're still spending pretty much everything you make, so raising the minimum wage feeds back into higher consumption."
Conservative,3d4cvw,pipechap,0,Tue Jul 14 02:26:32 2015 UTC,Perhaps they simply decided to raise prices as high as the market will bear?  That is simple economics.
Conservative,3d4cvw,Um_Pale_Face,4,Tue Jul 14 03:35:40 2015 UTC,"If I attempt put myself into the mindset of the average person who asks for increased minimum wage, the only thought that makes any sense is they think the massive profits of these companies are more than cushy enough to absorb an increase in minimum wage, and that the business paying out these higher wages would take the increase in stride, without raising their prices any.   And in that thought, one can only assume that they believe these companies are evil, and in many ways, deserve to have their massive profit margins reduced, and given to those that generate that wealth for them.  It's just too bad that all falls apart when you look at, for example, the profit margins of oil companies, the most egregious of all corporations in the mind of the low information voter, only makes about 10% profit out of the hundreds of billions it expends to make that money.  Meanwhile, companies like Chipotle, and other restaurant businesses make far less in profit, and are basically breaking even in comparison to the oil companies.   But after all, is it any wonder that those who earn and demand higher minimum wage do not understand even basic economics, or basic business principles?"
Conservative,3d4cvw,rewrewsuh,2,Tue Jul 14 03:23:57 2015 UTC,It seems Chipotle's operating margin is 18.23% currently: http://finance.yahoo.com/q/ks?s=CMG+Key+Statistics  As opposed to say Chevron which has operating margin of 8.48%.  So not sure where you get the fact that Chipotle makes far less in profit (if you were talking percentages and not raw numbers).  Not saying min wage hike is good but your numbers don't seem right.

Conservative,3d4cvw,msa001,-3,Mon Jul 13 16:20:37 2015 UTC,Strawman....from the article:   The rise in prices correlates directly with the minimum wage – now set at $15 –  which were increased by 14.4% to match the 14% elevation in pay   Sounds like they did the bare minimum to reflect the increase in cost of their labor.  Nice try.

Conservative,3d4cvw,j-awesome,3,Mon Jul 13 18:22:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're just not very good at math.  Salaries for minimum-wage workers are a small fraction of Chipotle's overall costs, so a 14% increase in those does not correspond to a 14% increase in the final cost of the food you buy."

Conservative,3d4f1m,r4nd0md0od,29,Mon Jul 13 16:52:47 2015 UTC,"Well for the GOP nomination, from my perspective it's:   His conservative stance on most issues (this might seem like a given for all R nominees, but for certain issues it isn't). This would help over people like Jeb Bush. His relatively clean name. This is a big help over people like Trump, but it's also a double-edged sword because his name also isn't well known.  His appearance (someone who looks like they can be the president can go a long way).  He can articulate ideas well, and in a rather non-controversial way. If you ask me, this is one of the biggest ones. Some of the runners, like Trump and Carson, can often destroy themselves with their own words. That's not to say Walker is the only one like this (Rubio comes to mind), but it certainly doesn't hurt his chances.   As for the national election, his chances of winning all depend on who his opponent is. It will likely be Hillary, in which case the fact that he is so clean while Hilary has so much controversy surrounding her will probably be the biggest factor.  I probably didn't cover everything here, so if someone else wants to chime in, feel free."

Unfortunately, though, there are a few good candidates who haven't held a comparable leadership position to know how they would do, so it's a bit unfair in a comparison (though one could argue the experience itself is important).  For instance, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul have only been senators, while, as you mentioned, Walker has been in a few positions including the Governor of Wisconsin. Even Fiorina and Trump have held non-political leadership positions (however, Fiorina's time as CEO of HP doesn't indicate anything positive about her leadership abilities)."

I mean, I don't live in Wisconsin, but his budget repair bill seemed to do wonders for the state, especially after the recession. It turned a substantial deficit into a surplus, created quite a few jobs, and all the while cut taxes.  Also, I want to clarify, my question isn't a challenge; as I said I don't live in Wisconsin so if there's other economic policies of his that haven't done well I genuinely want to know."

Conservative,3d4f1m,proWI,2,Tue Jul 14 02:16:27 2015 UTC,"Well again it's different for the GOP nomination and the national election. A conundrum I always discuss with people is that while Rand Paul is a great candidate for the national election (detailed solutions to problems, decriminalization of marijuana, champion of minorities will win over young and minority Dems) he's a little too close to the middle for the far right members of the party, making it difficult to win the party nomination. On the other hand, if a far right person wins the nomination, it's that much more difficult to win the national election.  If you ask me, Walker's advantages over Paul lie mainly within the party itself; he's more conservative on certain issues, and I think there are some who just get a certain feeling about him like he's a genuine person and different from the other candidates, not unlike how the Dems felt about Obama in the 2008 election. There's also the relatively small factor of Paul's name, as most Republicans aren't overly fond of his father, despite how different they are."

Conservative,3d4f1m,r4nd0md0od,13,Tue Jul 14 13:48:38 2015 UTC,"He's definitely not the most conservative of the GOP candidates, but I guess that really depends on your definition of ""conservative."" In terms of it's traditional, objective meaning, on a scale from 1 to 10 where Chris Christie is a 1 and Ted Cruz is a 10, Walker is probably a 7.   However, in the more dynamic sense of the word ""conservative,"" as it relates to the general feelings of the party's base, hes probably even closer to the end of the spectrum (near the 10). For instance, Ronald Reagan is often considered to be the champion of the Republican party, yet on that first scale he might be in the same place as Walker simply because he's not rigidly conservative on everything just for the sake of being conservative."

What is so bad about that?   What's so bad about it is that it's a recent stance he's taken. He spent years being pro-amnesty.
Conservative,3d4f1m,rms141,6,Mon Jul 13 16:26:38 2015 UTC,The reality is he was campaigning in a purple/blue state where immigration was not really a matter he was concerned with and he had no power to actually influence. Why lose votes in a state he is already at a disadvantage in?
Conservative,3d4f1m,ultimis,2,Mon Jul 13 16:46:33 2015 UTC,This stance predates his time as governor. And he had nothing to gain by being pro-amnesty in Wisconsin—the Democrats weren't voting for him anyway.
Conservative,3d4f1m,rms141,4,Mon Jul 13 17:01:36 2015 UTC,"Moderates lean left there which is why that state has voted left for quite a while. All stating ""I want all illegals rounded and tossed out of the country"" would do is lose him votes and might have been enough so that he would have never been elected.  Regardless. Some issues people don't really consider until it is relevant to what they are doing. I have changed my position on crucial issues over the years as I learn more about it or it becomes more relevant to me. At one point I would have been indifferent to abortion (as I'm not religious) I am now pro-life (I'm still not religious)."
Conservative,3d4f1m,ultimis,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:12:03 2015 UTC,"All stating ""I want all illegals rounded and tossed out of the country""   so he's against enforcement of our laws then?"

Absolutely zero of the candidates running align with me 100% and I'm a social and fiscal conservative.

Conservative,3d4f1m,matty25,0,Tue Jul 14 03:49:47 2015 UTC,"Walker's immigration stance is, to put it gently, nuanced.    He has supported path to citizenship and has spent the last year trying to walk that position back with limited success.    He favored the Senate immigration bill that got Marco Rubio in such trouble, then said he'd sign an Arizona-type bill to allow police to stop illegal immigrants, then said such a bill would be a ""distraction"", and now says he'd sign such a bill again.  Conservatives ran Mitt Romney over the rack for that kind of flip-flopping.  I'd like Governor Walker to take a position and stick to it."

Conservative,3d4f1m,pumpyourstillskin,7,Mon Jul 13 22:32:57 2015 UTC,"It's because of the way liberals view education as being more important than jobs when in reality an education's purpose should be to get a job, the job/career ultimately being more important.  The liberal professor who is highly educated but has little real work experience is revered (Obama) but the guy who forewent his final year is demonized because he took a job (Walker).  Education to them is everything and jobs are only good if they fit neatly in to a liberal box (can't make too much, can't make too little, has to be a positive effect on the environment, etc.) otherwise they are bad.  Walker has his head screwed on right; he went to college to get a job. He just so happened to get that job before he was done with his education."

Conservative,3d4f1m,Danteele,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:27:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know about you but here in Wisconsin not many expected him to win.  Milwaukee as a whole is very liberal.  Inner city for the most part yes, but don't forget the rest (the west side is more conservative since it's near Waukesha, the reddest county in the state, but still west side is still a bit blue.)  Dane County (Madison located there for non Wisconsinites) is very very liberal.  Dane County and Milwaukee are the 2 most populated places in WI.    Scott winning 3 times is impressive in a state like this.  Strong love for the unions and coming off Jim Doyle, this state was very liberal.  Scott beat Tom Barrett, popular mayor from Milwaukee in the recall election, which is pretty impressive, and Mary Burke for reelection.  3 wins in 4 years is pretty good, and hopefully it will be 4 wins in 6 years."

If you just look at the last election and you focus on Dane County out of the 500,000 people in Dane county roughly 50% voted and out of that many only 179,000 voted for Mary Burke. The thing a 50% turn out for Dane County is very good because most of the time it is at 35%. Most likely if Walker does what he is doing now he will be elected again."

Conservative,3d4wb3,Bonzai88,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:26:03 2015 UTC,"I think thats the biggest thing here.  A lot of people assume that when you say illegal alien, you are making one giant blanket statement of all foreigners.  No, its not.  They have committed a crime by entering the country without correct documentation or came under false pretenses.  Im surprised more legal immigrants arnt furious about this.  They actually go through all the right channels and have one hell of a hard time becoming a naturalized citizen, while these people illegally come in and are granted some weird blanket amnesty.

Ideally they wouldn't be there, but is there a realistic way to achieve this? Realistic in terms of resources, political capital?

Not only should it be hard for you to move to the United States, it should be hard for anyone to move anywhere. The concept of porous borders and the lack of enforcement on already-placed ones is causing much of the world's violence and unrest.

This was his conclusion after several paragraphs of working with the data. And he states in the next paragraph:   And I believe these are low-end estimates. For one, murder is almost always handled at the state and local level, not the federal level. So the GAO’s homicide data are skewed toward the state and local data, which cover fewer years (four) and a smaller population (illegals only). The Washington Post states that “Federal prisoners made up 10 percent of the total incarcerated populations in the United States in 2013.”   I would say there are large error bars on this.

Politicians (in America, anyway) can't talk bluntly--it rubs too many listeners the wrong way, even just for being too loose and impolite; hence, the extremely carefully scripted speeches and statements and mild-mannered demeanor of Clinton, Bush, Obama... A recent prime example of primetime-ready politician-speak was Jeb Bush's official statement about the marriage equality ruling:   ""I hope that we can show respect for the good people on all sides of the gay and lesbian marriage issue -- including couples making lifetime commitments to each other who are seeking greater legal protections and those of us who believe marriage is a sacrament and want to safeguard religious liberty.""

During this rant she actually uses the word 'micro-indignities'. I threw up in my mouth a little.   My eyes kind of glazed over after that much stupid crammed into 45 seconds. I'm sure she said other stuff, too.   The fact of the matter is that maybe 1% of Redditors would have any clue who Ellen Pao is had Reddit not done some stupid things lately, finally placed that last straw on the proverbial camel's back, and a grass-roots revolt ensued. Hundreds of subs (including defaults) went dark in protest.   Reddit is 99% run by users. The users fought back over various issues.   It was kind of a digital version of the Boston Tea Party ... and Pau and her sex and her race had dick-all to do with it.   There's no sexism or racism involved at all.

Conservative,3d4xkp,blitzbomb3,2,Tue Jul 14 17:52:53 2015 UTC,"gun violence is relatively stagnant   Incorrect, gun violence exhibits the same declining trends as most other forms of violent crime.   We often see reports claiming that gun violence is increasing, but national trends show otherwise. FBI crime statistics show that gun violence was far higher 20 years ago. A few extra cases in a short timeframe are likely to be chance fluctuations or copycat effects.   They're both decreasing, medical error is just a much bigger problem right now and it's not getting any press.

Conservative,3d4xkp,blitzbomb3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:56:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that, I'm saying that just because the physical number of deaths is higher, that does not mean the general public should necessarily worry more about medical deaths than gun deaths. Medicine is always improving, and when you're in the business of helping sick people, you're bound to let down a few. Doctors and other medical professionals should use those statistics to improve care and reduce incidents, but as a relatively normal American citizen, I'm more concerned with teenagers taking racial justice into their own hands than with doctors trying their best and failing occasionally. Now the case of individual hospitals treating patients badly or being corrupt is an entirely different story and should be dealt with immediately.

Not every day ""uh oh I might get shot rn"" worrying, worrying about how commonplace mass shootings have become in recent years. Columbine was one of the biggest stories of the decade, and this decade we've had more than a few incidents of comparable magnitude. It's not as simple as passing legislation, there is going to need to be a huge attitude change in various areas of our culture if that trend is to recede.   And to answer your other point, deaths from overdoses of prescription pills are not included in Medical error deaths. Those are the kind of deaths we're talking about.

This is what has happened in the US since the 1960's. The Marxist movement eventually took on a life of its own and now preaches hatred of all things that are ""normal"" or represent the majority of society: white people, Christians, heterosexuals, males, etc.  The reason they only hate the majority is because they have been successfully brainwashed to do so.

He was in my unit for 3 months and got the troop commander to write an exemption for him to do peyote at a meeting they have with their elders twice in their life time.   The reason I brought up the head gear issue is because it wasn't allowed until about a year ago. Never has been an issue until now. A lot of people from various religions served in the military without any exceptions to regulations. Also in the military there are a surprising number of people that agree with and sympathize with this police chiefs position.

In an attempt on the DODs part to clarify the regulations that govern how we wear our uniform and DOD approved hair styles for women, the DOD was actually successfully accused of being racist towards black women and the regulation was changed yet again to include more ""white fad hair styles"" and to allow some previously unauthorized black women fad hairstyles.  Now this doesn't sound like much, but I can guarantee you the DOD wasn't trying to be racist and offensive in this push to clarify the regulations. Service members have discovered that if they complain the right way then they can have whatever they want. Don't like the way basic training is conducted?

Conservative,3d13cl,msa001,-35,Mon Jul 13 17:56:29 2015 UTC,"But the silence from the Obama Administration about the other 6,373 gun homicides this year is not sickening?  I agree that with such coverage and this being in such a public light that a comment might be helpful but there are literally thousands of deeply tragic deaths each year by random acts of violence and any administration shouldn't be expected to comment on each of them.  Let us compare apples to apples and I can assure you that had Kate been shot down by police or any authority representing the state, had her murder been committed by those supposed to be protecting and serving her or had her murderer walked free from legal proceedings, then there would have been comment.  As it stands, the tragic murder of Kate has little or no similarities with the others mentioned here and by drawing up racial lines on this argument u/legalizehazing is perpetuating a ridiculous narrative that maybe white people have it worse off?  Systemic and institutionalised racism and sexism is present in the vast majority of the world and will take a long time to undo, and while things are far more equal now than 30, 50 or 100 years ago there is still something wrong when pay disparities look like this or specifically this and might as well show it including women too. Basically if you're white and male and straight you are statistically likely to have a significantly easier/better life.  I personally take 'racism does exist' to be such a blatantly obvious statement but the only way the title of this post could be considered a worthy title is if that fact were in dispute. I would like to remind people here that it is not.  TLDR: 1.) Compare like for like; random acts of violence are definitely awful, tragic and concerning but not comparable to state homocide/failed judicial proceedings. 2.) Of course racism does exist and while we have set the grounds for eqality, racism is both systemic and institutionalised and will be an issue for a long time to come."

It's perfectly normal. The POTUS doesn't weigh in about local law enforcement issues. Nobody would expect him to.   What's sickening is that when the hapless, incompetent Obama chooses to open his big stupid gob about a 'murder', it's a criminal who attacked a police officer - forcing the officer to act in self-defense. Or, it's a criminal who attacked a civilian - forcing them to act in self-defense.   Obama dispatches Sharpton to the area to race-bait. Obama sends dignitaries to the funerals. Obama forms opinions (that have all been factually incorrect) about the cases. He publicly speaks about his ill-formed 'opinions'. Obama sends dignitaries to the funerals of thugs (yes, I said 'thugs'. that's not Racist™) that were killed in self-defense.   The Obama administration has refused to comment on the Steinle murder.   That would be perfectly normal had Obama also chosen not to comment on the other non-murders that he can't wait to have an incorrect 2-bit opinion about.   Obama would most likely comment on the Steinle murder had her father shot the convicted felon illegal immigrant dead in the street before he had an opportunity to murder a young woman. I'm sure we'd be hearing all about how Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez was an innocent cherub on his way to church to pray for his sick grandmother and deliver Girl Scout cookies ... gunned down by a member of the Aryan Nation who went to SF looking to pick a fight with anyone that's not white.   The issue isn't Obama's silence about this murder. The issue is Obama's previous meddling with local law enforcement issues, making public statements about pending cases that were 100% wrong, and sending representatives to the funerals of criminals and thugs who were ultimately responsible for their own deaths.   I have no issue with Obama's silence about the Steinle murder. My issue is that he needed to drink a big, steaming hot cup of STFU a very long time ago."

The POTUS weighing in publicly about local or state law enforcement issues - especially when he's proven to be 100% wrong in the end - is irresponsible. It's narcissistic. It's race-baiting. It's completely unbecoming of his office. It's unpresidential. It's embarrassing.   The issue really isn't Obama refusing to comment about #4.

Conservative,3d13cl,unusualsquirrel,-30,Mon Jul 13 07:35:03 2015 UTC,"Systemic and institutionalised racism and sexism is present in the vast majority of the world and will take a long time to undo, and while things are far more equal now than 30, 50 or 100 years ago there is still something wrong when pay disparities look like this or specifically this and might as well show it including women too. Basically if you're white and male and straight you are statistically likely to have a significantly easier/better life."
Conservative,3d13cl,Rangerfan1214,16,Mon Jul 13 11:43:42 2015 UTC,"Those are not pay disparities, those are overall income disparities. Neither article took two people working the same (or similar) job of different races and genders and compared them, they took the widespread median income of different types of people.  As far as the first article, and parts of the second article, it is obvious statistically white people have ""easier"" lives. There is a significant smaller percentage of white people in low-income housing, in neighborhoods that lack resources and education. In this regard, yes, I suppose white people have it easier. If you took a white kid and dropped him in the projects, 9 times out of 10 he does not grow up, get a 6-figure job and moves to a suburb. That kid will most likely end up like his parents, working a similar low-skill job, in the same bad neighborhood.   Now I liked the second article because it compared education, but let's face it, not every degree from every school is created equal. Now if you take the first article and extrapolate a little, you can conclude that there are most likely fewer blacks and hispanics getting advanced degrees. Now that also begs the question, how many of them were flowers that grew in the dark? If they were an aforementioned flower, they likely had little to no guidance choosing/paying for a college. So in turn their post-collegiate employment may not be as lucrative as it could have been, had they known which degrees were making money, or if they had that couple of extra thousands of dollars to pay for the nicer school they got into.   As far for women, I noticed the article never mentioned whether or not the women used in the statistic had ever been on any kind of maternity leave, which of course slows people down depending upon how long they were gone. The sad fact is that women get pregnant, and have to take time off from high-stress jobs, which in turn could hurt how much money they make in the long run.  As you could see, you and I have varying interpretations on relatively general data. I believe the reason white men typically live ""better"" lives than those of other races is a matter of sins/successes of the father metaphorically speaking. As far as men vs. women, I find it hard to believe that men are just handed more money without any reason, at least not anymore. Honestly, there are so many variables in trying to find out such a thing, I don't think we'll ever know the answer.  Now I do still believe there is racism on some level, but to go as far to say one entire race of people is purposefully holding another back seems absurd. But at the end of the day I've been wrong before and stranger things have happened."

What you seem to be saying is the narrative pushed by the left (or the president) is the official or legal position.  What I'm wondering is: were they really charged in a court of law with a racism-related crime?  I.e. a hate crime.  I don't think Darren Wilson was charged or convicted with/of a hate crime so I'd say officially it wasn't racism.  I don't think George Zimmerman was charged or convicted with/of a hate crime so I'd say officially it wasn't racism.  I don't know about the other two.  All I'm saying is that Obama's narrative is not necessarily officially or legally the same as a court of law, it's like a shit test of the nation by the president.

But at this point in the race, neither looks like they have a shot because the media doesn't really support either of them and whether you like it or not, that has a lot to do with it.  Another thing Trump has going for him is he doesn't allow the media to control what he says like the other candidates too. Everyone else is walking on eggshells and is afraid to say the wrong thing because God forbid we offend people who aren't going to vote for us anyway!   I watched the full interview he had with NBC last week and the interviewer tried for 30 minutes to sling ""got ya!"" questions that other candidates would've squirmed to answer. He took full control of the interview and did not let her attempts to muffle with him political correctness alter what he had to say.

And no I'm not talking about Judicial Review. The court has no power to create constitutional law which is what this is. Only the states via 3/4ths support can change and add onto the constitution. No part of the federal government was empowered to change the Constitution. If the court had such power it would be in directly conflict of the spirit of ""checks and balances"" as the other two branches of the government have zero power to change the Constitution.

Conservative,3d1xhz,ezfrag,0,Mon Jul 13 18:31:41 2015 UTC,"In their eyes, the Supreme Court did not create a new law.   I don't care about ""in their eyes"". You can rationalize anything. Lawyers can convince you aren't technically alive if they put their minds to it. The SCOTUS created law in two places:  1.) They created Constitutional Law by claiming a right never specified in the Constitution was generated by the 14th amendment even though that amendment was passed 150 years ago. No court in that 150 years even considered it even though cases dealing with marriage have appeared many times in courts. The only thing close was loving v. Virginia where they said marriage was essential to procreation and the continuation of the human race. Which even that was an exaggeration. But they use that along with the fact that laws were created specifically to make blacks feel inferior (which was the ""spirit"" of the 14th amendment) made it unconstitutional. They didn't use framers intent, they didn't use the text, they didn't even use to the crazy ""spirit"" of the text to support this. Kennedy straight up stated that he was finding new rights every day by reading into it. This wasn't that the right existed there all along, it was that he found a way to make his ideology work.  2.) Even if there was a legitimate application of the 14th amendment (which there wasn't as states discriminate on a whole host of issues). The court went above and beyond its function by writing new law by declaring a definition of marriage in all 50 states. If the states were in violation of the 14th amendment it is not up to the court to write law to correct it. Their ruling should have been ""same sex couples are currently not being given equal protection in the following states: a, b, c, d. Those states will have X amount of time to comply or find the state institution of marriage to be unconstitutional. They would then list out what same sex couples need to be given in order for compliance. This would allow the states to either pass new laws to include same sex couples in marriage or create new institutions like Civil Unions which would have all the same rights and protections as married couples. In either case it is up to the states to come up with a solution, not the court.   I'm all for calling for an Article 5 Convention to override them, but that does not change the fact that what I had stated previously was correct.   Which is a cop out. There are no checks and balances in the federal government if the court can create Constitutional law. End of story. Congress and the Executive have zero ability to create Constitutional law. The only way new rights and Constitutional law can be created is via Article 5. The Constitution makes this perfectly clear. The Constitution is supposed to be really hard to change. It's a foundation document for this country and only a vast majority of the people should want it to be changed before it can. It was never intended to be changed on the whim of a 5/4 majority of political activists in SCOTUS. What you are endorsing is a Tyranny of the minority. A political ideology that can't enact Constitutional amendments can enact them by stack this court via Judicial Supremacy and then make sure the majority cannot revert it as their only choice is to either stack the court back or get 3/4ths of the states to over rule a activist court.   The Supreme Court is the final interpreter of federal law and the constitutionality of other laws.   Which is called Judicial Supremacy. No where in the Constitution is this stated. This was a view that spawned in the 20th century (over a hundred years after the founding of the Country). Judicial review =/= Judicial Supremacy. The courts only role is to apply law under the Constitution. Judicial review (which is not specified) is a natural byproduct of this as when Constitutional law is in conflict with congressional law someone need to state that it is. But this review is limited to framers intent and the text. It does not allow the Court to decide whatever it wants. They did that with the Dredd Scott decision and you can see how that turned out.   This is the same court that considers it a right to end the life of an unborn child, so my opinion of them is not nearly as high as you seem to think I put them.   Which was based off of the created ""right of privacy"" which has no foundation in the Constitution. There are rights related to privacy, that doesn't give a blanket privacy right.   Turning over a Supreme Court decision on a Constitutional interpretation is very difficult. It has only happened 5 times, and only twice in the last 100 years.   Actually when there is clear Judicial activism the other branches can declare a review. Call in the justices for  hearing, and if found they are creating law (as in this case) then they are in violation of the Constitutional prerogative and should be impeached by congress. Once a impeachment is confirmed congress would notify SCOTUS that it's decision was a mistrial and should be retried (assuming the justice impeached was in the majority, else the ruling would stand).  We the people have allowed them to get away with this. The court exists to apply law, not create it. Creation of law is left to the legislature (congress and the states)."

SCOTUS did not create the legality of same sex marriage, they struck down the illegality of same sex marriage, which they deemed unconstitutional.   Which is called Judicial Supremacy. No where in the Constitution is this stated. (in reference to my stating that SCOTUS is the final interpreter of the law)   Might I direct you to the Constitution, Aricle 3, Section 2, Clause 1 - In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction. In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.  The court decision came from a number of cases the 6th District court had consolidated into one case and reversed. That gave SCOTUS the jurisdiction when the case was appealed.

So, is SCOTUS an overreaching arm of the Federal Government? Most certainly! You could also say the same thing about the Executive Branch, and quite frankly, the Legislative Branch as well these days. But if you still want to try to go down the route that SCOTUS created a new law, please provide a source showing that new law. Otherwise, I'm through with you. There is no point arguing with a fellow conservative about this when there are liberals out there that our debate skills could be used on."
Conservative,3d1xhz,nicksvr4,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:53:23 2015 UTC,"Where is the new Law created by SCOTUS?   I already spelled that out to you. Anything considered ""Constitutional"" such as Constitutional protected rights is ""Constitutional Law"".   Rights are not created by the court or constitution, they are only protected by them.   Yeah and the only protected rights are listed in the Constitution.    SCOTUS did not create the legality of same sex marriage, they struck down the illegality of same sex marriage, which they deemed unconstitutional.   I covered this in points 1 and 2 in the last comment... No state made same sex marriage illegal so your statement is just wrong. There were many states which reaffirmed the definition of marriage after activist courts decided it needed a new meaning.  The court decision if you have read it: 1.) Made marriage a constitutional right between two people (covered their liberal asses from the eventual polygamy cases). 2.) Made law in all 50 states that defines marriage as a institution between any two people instead of the known definition of between a man and a woman. That is both Constitutional Law created and 50 State laws created.   The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;—to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls;—to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;—to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party;—to Controversies between two or more States;— between a State and Citizens of another State,—between Citizens of different States,—between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.   If you're going to cite the Constitution, cite the relevant portion. They are not above the Constitution. They cannot contradict the text of the Constitution. They cannot create Constitutional Law. They cannot create any Law. Their job is to apply the law and make sure it is consistent.   The court decision came from a number of cases the 6th District court had consolidated into one case and reversed. That gave SCOTUS the jurisdiction when the case was appealed.   Which is irrelevant. I didn't say that the court can't hear cases dealing with the states. I stated there is nothing in the Constitution which states they are the final authority on the Constitution.   Which again I pose the question to you. Do you believe in the spirit of checks and balances in the government? Do you understand its purpose and why the framers put it there? It was if one branch (not just congress and the executive) got out of line the other branches would have a means of reigning it back in. If the Court can do whatever it wants than there are no checks. It has the ultimate authority as it can generate Constitutional Law out of its ass. Let's say the court does some completely insane and states it is perfectly legal to kill Democrats who who speak in public. They rationalize that the first amendment does not apply. From your argument their word is final and it is now legal to kill Democrats in open season. Now the SCOTUS would never be stupid enough to make its abuses that extreme as they know the moment they lose the support of both parties they will removed.   I agree with you on this point, which is why my statement ended with my affirmation that I do not hold SCOTUS in as high of a regard as you seem to think I do.   I haven't been arguing that you hold them in high regard. I've been arguing against your Judicial Supremacy stance which is a common held perception on reddit and in the general public. To paraphrase Vary's from the Game of Thrones: ""Power is where people perceive it to be"". In this case there is no Constitutional law supporting Judicial Supremacy. But the court has slowly been growing its power over the last century and the power creep has let people accept it.   That's great in theory, but it has never been done. I do appreciate how far you are willing to stretch the ""High Crimes and Misdemeanors"" of Article 2   Of course not. Gingrich in his 2012 White Paper spelled out a similar response to the court. I'm not stretching ""High Crimes and Misdemeanors"" I'm applying it and:   The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour   A judge creating law from the bench is not acting in good behavior as that violates the role in government and the rule of law. As for High Crimes and Misdemeanors.   The charge of high crimes and misdemeanors covers allegations of misconduct peculiar to officials, such as perjury of oath, abuse of authority, bribery, intimidation, misuse of assets, failure to supervise, dereliction of duty, conduct unbecoming, and refusal to obey a lawful order. Offenses by officials also include ordinary crimes, but perhaps with different standards of proof and punishment than for nonofficials, on the grounds that more is expected of officials by their oaths of office.    Impeachment again has been misinterpreted by modern people as a means of removing someone from office for a criminal activity. The reality is it was a convention setup to remove someone who wasn't necessarily acting in a criminal fashion (or it couldn't be proven as such) but it was obvious they were up to no good in one way or another. Impeachment is a political tool to remove people who are acting out side the scope of their office or in a bad way.   But if you still want to try to go down the route that SCOTUS created a new law, please provide a source showing that new law.   I can't spell it out further for you. I listed exactly what laws were created in that previous post. If you're done that's fine."

So if they want to encourage heterosexual stable relationships, that is fully within the state's right to do so. If they want to encourage people to have children by providing tax breaks, they are free to do so. If they want to reduce risky investment flipping, they can place taxes on investments sold within a year of acquiring them.  I'm all for gays having access to right of attorney and similar protections via Civil Unions. But there was no violation of equal protection by having marriage be what it has always been: a union between a man and a woman.

This was a very, very common complaint for states that allowed gay marriage before it was federal law.   So? It sucks. But singles also don't get treated the same. Polygamous groups don't get treated the same. Taxes are highly discriminatory. You can get tax write offs on thousands of things. Are you claiming our entire tax code is a violation of the 14th amendment? Say two people don't' believe in marriage, they will be paying higher taxes as well. The government (and it's right to discriminate which we both agree upon) is within its right to encourage heterosexual relationships if they so choose.   Gay couples had to file a tax return as a couple for the state, then as two separate people for their federal tax forms. That's not at all equal treatment to hetero couples.   I file my taxes all the time. This is a nonissue. Claiming it's a slight hassle is not equal protection. Even if it was a violation the problem lies not with state definitions but the federal government's treatment of the state's definition.   Add to this the automatic, no questions asked, spousal benefits from being able to get married in the first place, no paper work or lawyer required past getting married.   What about the benefits of being labeled ""disabled""? Better parking. State payout. Special treatment. Just because a group of people get benefits doesn't mean it's a violation of equal protection because you don't get them.   But in reality I support same sex couples getting these. Which is why California's Civil Unions since 2005 have had these (3 years before proposition 8 became a thing). They can also get these via a will and a lawyer can right up a right of attorney.    Oh, and the right to have your marriage recognized by the state and federal government to begin with.   No such right exists. You have no right to force others to recognize you as something. The example I often use for this debate is a crazy guy who claims he's a martian. He comes up and tells you this, and you nod your head and say ""sure buddy"". He takes offense that you don't recognize him as a martian and goes to the courts to make the government recognize him as a martian. Mind you ""Martian"" like ""Marriage"" have specific meanings. People are free to misuse them, they are not free to force others to recognize them as such. So based on your argument this crazy guy would be allowed to have a legal status ""Martian"" associated with him on federal records.   Anyone can get married in a religious sense, any time, anywhere. It's all ceremony. What was not equal were the legal parts, where the state and federal government must recognize you and tax you, and treat you like a married couple.   Yeah same sex couples were getting married long before in state recognition of it the redefinition. I live in California and some of my gay friends called their relationship marriage and have benefited the same protections since 2005 via Civil Unions. They were not arrested for their misuse of language, they were not fined for having a ""wedding"". The state just didn't recognize it as marriage as it required opposite sexes to meet the definition.  There is no problem with having different legal statuses such as male and female, single, divorced, married, domestic partnership, etc. And there is no problem with discrimination if the state isn't doing it specifically to alienate a section of the population.   That did not exist for gay couple prior to the ruling.   And none of those were required. The court went above and beyond its scope and several of the justices in the majority opinion should be impeached for it. I don't care if you support ""Gay Marriage"" they violated the rule of law and the Constitution with their actions."
Conservative,3d1xhz,xXnewbsonlyXx,-12,Mon Jul 13 20:25:25 2015 UTC,"Like I said before, the same-sex marriage ruling was about equality. If straight couples can marry, then gay couples should be able to as well. Citing the constitution doesn't help your argument at all considering it doesn't say they can't get married. So where's the basis of your argument?"
Conservative,3d1xhz,stemgang,9,Sun Jul 12 22:43:50 2015 UTC,"If straight couples can marry, then gay couples should be able to as well.   I agree with the wisdom, but I don't agree with the legality or the reasoning of the court. They made the decision without legal backing and instead went with what they thought ""felt"" right. That's not how you interpret law. If you want gay marriage at a federal level, seek an amendment, otherwise, the states method was already working well for legal gay marriage."

You're assuming facts not in evidence. The jury's still out on whether any gays are ""born that way"". And as far as love goes, that's irrelevant from a legal perspective. Finally, many would argue that marriage is by nature heterosexual and that gay people were always free to legally marry someone of the opposite sex. That's equality. Love and/or sex isn't necessary for the marriage contract."

It's not like Trump is out there hiring every single fucking worker that works on any project in his portfolio. But of course, none of that matters to the shrieking left that's fucking scared to the point of stupidity that Trump has been polling so well. Why else would they be moving against him?   How many tens of thousands of people are employed in the construction projects owned, partially owned, or even under some tertiary project that falls into Trump's asset umbrella? How many contractors, their sub-contractors, and their sub-sub-contractors are they going to dive into?   The Obama admin and leftists in general are fucking world-class idiots. This little media stunt isn't going to change anyone's minds about anything. The illegal ""democrat-voter"" problem isn't going away. The fact remains that while this administration is somehow going to say that ""trump has no credibility because he has illegals in his employ"" is the fucking Mount Everest of cognitive dissonance & downright hypocrisy given the fact that practically 1/10th the population of Mexico has been aided and abetted by this entire administration on the hopes that they will stay here in the USA and have 4 or 5 little illegal babies that will grow up to be good little Democrat voters -- because ""OH, those bad Republicans hate mama and papa, tio and tia; so I'd better vote for the Democrats otherwise their benefits would get cut""."

There are droves of illegal immigrants because the nation doesn't enforce the immigration laws, they will be looking for work and know people will try harder to verify identity so they will try harder to appear legal. Some people get passed the verification (just like background checks, people get through all the time) and then the owner is on the hook because someone got past their verification process.   On the other hand the above situation ends with the owner successfully verifying someone is illegal and doesn't hire them based on that.

Our gay marriages weren't being acknowledged by the federal government and most other states until a couple weeks ago.  The federal stance of marijuana is still a little dicey. It's hard for our pot growers, distributors, and sellers to find banks willing to keep accounts for them, for instance, because of federal regulations (yet federal sales taxes are applied to pot sales).  Meanwhile, historically, there was a point in our history when a lot of states got upset because the federal government wasn't forcing some states to recognize the laws of other states. Those states thought they had the right to disregard certain laws, such as recognizing the right of people in other states to treat people as property, and so a number of states ended up seceding because they didn't think other states had the right to do that and the federal government was unfairly disregarding the laws that said they had to.

Source for this being a nation wide and growing problem.   Crime rates have been declining nationally for years. There has been a spike in homicides in some large cities this year (see here). However there's no indication if this are a trend or not.  Your example is complete anecdotal. But let's say it a ""thing"". Every 10 days there's an event as you described. That means it happens 37 times (what the hell... let's round up). And lets say each event involves 20 people. So in a country of 318,900,000, I (or you) have a 0.00000232047 chance of being involved in such an event.  (37 x 20 /318,900,000).  BUT.... that 319,800,000 has a lot of people that don't live in urban areas where all these terrible things happen! You're right. Only 81% live in urban areas (according to worldbank.org). Then the chance SKYROCKETS to 0.00000286478  Doesn't seem like much of a worry to me.  And before you point out that plane crashes or oil refinery explosions happen less frequently and present even less of a danger I'll point out that both of those have big boomy explosions and that does make the national news."

You can even see that Scot-Irish influence in the Confederate motto itself: ""Deovendickia.""  That being said, this anti-flag hysteria is getting out of hand. I must say, it's no surprise that Boehner voted to ban even private citizens from planting that flag on Confederate gravesites, or that the Mississippi flag has come under fire.

They might as well ban Civil War reenactments, demand that ""The Night They Took Old Dixie Down"" be taken off of iTunes, and force anyone with a Confederate flag in the back of their pick-up truck out of work. Never mind that the battle flag was also flown in the name of Southerners whose homes were sacked, crops razed, civilians slaughtered, and cities burned to the ground.

He's actually more liberal than he lets on? Great. It's business as usual then, because most of the candidates fall into that bracket. Even, to a degree, Cruz and Paul do.  What's important here is that Trump finally pointed out one of the biggest, most obvious problems with illegal immigration - and when he was called a racist, attacked on all sides by the media and business forces - he stood his ground. He said, flatly, that he had nothing to apologize for, and that he was calling attention to something important.  Which is all completely true. The idea that what he said was 'racist' is inane. The idea that he should apologize is even worse.  I think Trump would probably make a shitty president, so at least he has something in common with Jeb, Rubio and others. But he's doing something valuable -now-. He's not letting media and big business condemnations determine what is and isn't acceptable to talk about. He's not letting outrage force him into making public apologies.  He has a fucking spine and some courage, and he's sharing it with others. Pardon us for not believing that forever trying to only say things and increasingly intolerant liberal culture approves us is wise strategy."

Mexicans are not the ones crossing the borders, they just happen to be the point of entry to the countries south of it (one of which happens to be where i am from). He labels them all Mexicans. So not only is he calling the people who illegally cross the border rapists and criminals, he also calls them Mexicans,  I find that even more offensive.    Saying illegal immigrants aren't the cream of the crop (they're not).   My father over stayed his visa and eventually became illegal back in the 80s during the Reagan administration. Reagan granted him/us amnesty. He went to english school, graduated college, worked his way up the ladder in one of Manhattan's most luxurious hotels and became the Chief Electrical Engineer until he started his own successful company.

Conservative,3cyxpd,logicalthinker1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:09:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah he stated in the speech that he uses lobbyists and donated to all sides as it was beneficial for him to do so.

Not sure how true that is.  The first link is like ""meh"". Seems like some random crazy idea to fix the debt problem that would never pass congress. That was 16 years ago. I had some pretty crazy ideas 16 years ago too.  The 2nd link is pretty damning. That is straight up pro-amnesty which a lot of the people who are supporting him have no clue about. I imagine he would change his tune as he will known that his polling is solely due to anti-illegal immigration support. But none of his comments as of yet have contradicted amnesty or support amnesty.  He hasn't backed down on his socialized medicine support so I imagine he won't back down on amnesty either. I think this will lose him his voter support unless he does a 180. Or if he can somehow guarantee securing the boarder for certain.

Conservative,3cyxpd,logicalthinker1,0,Sun Jul 12 18:14:32 2015 UTC,So if he said he no longer believes it? As I said 16 years is a lot of time and he could have said that it was an extreme measure to take on the debt but he knew would never actually work.  Regardless it seems he has a lot of positions to defend and the legs on his campaign are likely to fall out from underneath him soon.  BTW in the grand scheme of things I would prefer a small wealth tax over a high income tax any day. As a high income tax really hinders economic mobility. Some states already do wealth taxes in the form of property tax. Trump's crazy idea stated he would exclude property. Likely such an implementation would have a lot of rich people sending their money and assets over seas.

When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that my dear friend, is about the end of any nation.

Conservative,3cydpt,MadDogReynolds,5,Sun Jul 12 12:52:28 2015 UTC,Education costs are a huge issue for this country. I don't think this actually addresses the problem as education cost increases seem to be tied to administration costs (IT infrastructure). But this will allow their University to trim programs more easily (such as the mythical underwater basket weaving). And I approve of making that easier.
Conservative,3cydpt,ultimis,3,Sun Jul 12 03:32:57 2015 UTC,"Not IT. Actual administration is the cost they cite. They say competition over grants and awards and blah blah require tons of admin positions.   It's bullshit though. That's a result, not the cause. It's very very clear it's a demand problem. When half of a college's graduates are in psychology and political science etc and prices are rising three times the rate of inflation... you know it's not admin costs lol. It'd be more natural if say, competition over students not over students persuaded by obscure awards etc was the priority. Demand is being over ""stimulated"". Underwater basket weaving won't get trimmed because their is demand for it. Until tuition is a real price that shit won't get cut."
Conservative,3cydpt,legalizehazing,0,Sun Jul 12 06:23:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was basing that off of one article I read on it. Administration costs went up like 400% (even accounting for inflation) between the 1980's and present and a large part of that was blamed on the rise of expensive information technology and the specialists to maintain them.   Underwater basket weaving won't get trimmed because their is demand for it.   Well it's not really a thing. But let's say under water basket weaving was a real program. There is actually incredibly low demand for such a program. But how does it exist? It's being subsidized by tuition for students going into other programs. So when I was in college for my engineering degree we paid tuition then we paid even more money for our engineering school to pay for labs and equipment that we need to stay relevant. Our engineering school was required to do that as our tuition was being siphoned off by worthless programs that need our tuition for staff and professors for those worthless programs. So we had to give out extra money just so we could have the bare minimum equipment that should have been covered in our tuition costs to begin with.  So it sounds like there could be tuition savings from cutting these crap programs that serve no real purpose outside of paying for some person with a PHD that needed a job. So the Wisconsin school can't raise tuition to rip off the students, and now the school is empowered to make cuts where needed (where the strict tenure law stopped them). They either cut these programs or they watch as their school fails."
Conservative,3cydpt,ultimis,0,Sun Jul 12 06:40:46 2015 UTC,Nope.  The reason costs went up so much is 100% due go the fed taking over the loan system.    When money is free and easy to get price becomes less of a factor in the buying process.  Universities are gold plating themselves to attract more students.  That drives up cost.  Want to fix it?  Get the government out of the loan business.
Conservative,3cydpt,gbimmer,-1,Sun Jul 12 13:18:09 2015 UTC,"When the government gives out money, people put their hands out.     Simple as that, when the Fed gives out more loans then tution will spike."

Conservative,3cydpt,RandallWho,8,Sat Jul 11 23:42:04 2015 UTC,"The ultimate question here is one of basic morality (at least from a libertarian point of view). Why should citizens, especially those who defy the ""established consensus"" on issues ranging from global warming to the supposed virtues of the New Deal and Great Society, be forced to fund institutions that teach things contrary to their views, particularly when students are getting a very one-sided treatment of these issues? It's the same question that arises with government schooling. Liberals get quite uppity when the tables are turned and Texas education officials vote to promote American exceptionalism and the role of states' rights in the Civil War. We wouldn't have to constantly be at each others' throats over what these institutions should or shouldn't be teaching if, in a marketplace of competing values, people had the freedom to keep their money (rather than have it taxed) and allocate funds toward schools and colleges whose teachings align more with their values, or even stay neutral and actually present both sides."

And yes i agree with the stentiment why should my taxes go to something i don't belive in? And it is something that I struggle with I mean if I want my education my parks my government services the. I am going to have to take the stuff I don't want. As for the education issue I think the left not want certain things taught is just as bad as anything. Education shouldn't promote an agenda left leaning or right leaning. It should promote critcal thought and critical theory people should be think and look at subjects not just learn. But I don't think that can be accomplished by the private or public sector till the way education is taught is looked at. So not wanting to teach something on ideological grounds is more a flaw with the system then anything and I don't think cutting funding is go to help. I mean what is to stop the school from seeking outside funding from some one or some one that has an agenda? We already see this occurring among the sciences.
Conservative,3cydpt,RandallWho,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:19:06 2015 UTC,"Education shouldn't promote an agenda left leaning or right leaning. It should promote critcal thought and critical theory people should be think and look at subjects not just learn.    I agree with this. People should be encouraged to do their own research, analyze a variety of sources, and come to their own conclusions. The ideal would be to diversify one's reading list, so that one could read Paul Krugman for one take on monetary stimulus, and then Bob Murphy or Tom Woods for an alternative perspective. I notice that my ethics textbook devotes a great many paragraphs to the limitations of Ayn Rand's egoist philosophy (with the usual ""rich getting richer,"" capitalism-caused-the-2008-collapse bromides) while very few to its strengths. Meanwhile, deontology is mostly ""strengths,"" with very little in way of limitations. That's about as fair as balanced as Fox News.   I mean what is to stop the school from seeking outside funding from some one or some one that has an agenda? We already see this occurring among the sciences.   The difference is that the funding is now voluntary, as opposed to extracted from everyone indiscriminately through the threat of state-imposed violence (i.e. plunder)."
Conservative,3cydpt,rainbowshine64,2,Sun Jul 12 06:20:13 2015 UTC,"The article stated tuition is also frozen (so no similar tuition hikes can happen). The school claims this will result in lower quality staff as they can't be as competitive. Walker claims professors can teach more classes.  Arguably education has been a bubble for years. Costs have been skyrocketing for decades and are not sustainable. Some analysis I've read says this is due to administrative costs which have skyrocketed (IT infrastructure, which oddly enough was supposed to reduce administrative cost for schools and businesses)."

On the contrary, most of us support school choice (like making it easier for charter schools to receive state funding), local control over schools, and limiting the impact of extremely powerful teacher unions (that care more about teachers than students, generally speaking).  Cutting funding for schools does not always make them worse (or imply that conservatives ""hate"" schools). Think about it. We spend more per-capita on our students (in the US) than most other industrialized nations do, and yet our educational system is not very highly ranked worldwide. This is mainly due to a lack of accountability - schools these days will pass kids even if they're not proficient. Also, tenured teachers don't have to be good at their jobs, so we have a problem with lackluster teaching, too.  In my opinion, (although it may be counter intuitive) conservatives really are doing the right thing here."

I think a lot of people also want the illegal immigration problem taken care of.

It's the only reason Hillary seems like she has a huge commanding lead in the polls. It's the reason why incumbents are so hard to unseat in political elections. In time the other strong candidates running good campaigns (which I assume Rubio will have) will catch up in the polls.

His only solutions from this speech was an implied secure the border (obvious Republican response) and he inserted a crazy idea of charging Mexico 100,000 dollars per illegal that comes into the United States from Mexico. Which I have no clue how he would even do that. He also quipped he would have really smart guys, wall street sharks, negotiating these deals instead of the political appointee types that seem to have flooded the Obama administration.  The speech spent a lot of time dealing with the problems of illegal immigration and not actually the solutions. Pretty much he made it clear it would be a top priority for him to put an end to illegal immigration.  He admits openly in this speech that conservatives will not like him on healthcare as he believes in 100% coverage. Though he doesn't specify socialized medicine.  There are a lot of people who are single issue voters. I've debated a few on this subreddit who will never vote for Marco Rubio because of some of his immigration stances. There are others who just value certain positions more than others. Those people might see illegal immigration has as a huge crisis while socialized medicine that don't really care one way or another or it's not nearly as important to them.  In a ideal world everyone would consider the host of issues across the board and weigh each one in importance and make a logical decision on who to support. Or you're one of those people I've been debating recently who think that if you don't agree with them on one or two issues you're no better than any Democrat and they would rather stay home and not vote (thus helping Democrats win the Presidency).

We haven't had a few degrees of warming. It was like .5 degrees warming (even with some readjustments) for the 20th century. Sun spot actively rose throughout that period as well.

Wha   The emails that were leaked from the University of East Anglia late last year are not proof of this; they are merely the icing on the lake   Deng   McIntyre asked the senior author of the hockey stick graph, Michael Mann, for the data and the programs in 2003, so he could check it himself. This was five years after the graph had been published, but Mann had never been asked for them before. McIntyre quickly found errors: mislocated series, infilled gaps, truncated records, old data extrapolated forwards where new was available, and so on.   Lolz srs   Not all the data showed a 20th century uptick either. In fact just 20 series out of 159 did, and these were nearly all based on tree rings. In some cases, the same tree ring sets had been used in different series. In the end the entire graph got its shape from a few bristlecone and foxtail pines in the western United States; a messy tree-ring data set from the Gaspé Peninsula in Canada; another Canadian set that had been truncated 17 years too early called, splendidly, Twisted Tree Heartrot Hill; and a superseded series from Siberian larch trees.    Interesting go on   He had standardised the data by “short-centering” them—essentially subtracting them from a 20th century average rather than an average of the whole period.

What a douche this writer is.  Edit: Trump is a known quantity.  Most Americans have followed his career's ups and downs at least vaguely by the occasional sensational headline he makes as he does his attention whore thing.  Obama was virtually unknown to the American public prior to 2007, and the media and his wealthy backers have gone to great lengths to either hide or just not publicize his background and upbringing.  Did he buy and sell businesses like Trump?  Who knows.  Did he go bankrupt like Trump?  again, this information has been kept a secret from the public, only a carfully crafted narrative has been alowed to be presented to the American public.  So again Mr. Goldberg, who is being conned?  Who is being sold a bill of goods?

Conservative,3ctunc,WhiskeyHoliday,24,Fri Jul 10 19:41:56 2015 UTC,"Forewarning, this is long, but only because I want to give the full and most honest answer I can for you, with all of the respect and research I can muster.  I don't think Obama is ignoring the murder of Katie Steinle any more than he is ignoring the murders of hundreds of people across the country that go un-remarked-upon by the POTUS. It is absolutely a tragedy that she was killed, but her case is not comparable to Trayvon Martin's or Michael Brown's.  Let's look at Katie's case: she was killed self-admittedly by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a nonresident alien living in San Francisco. Articles mention his long rap sheet often and at length, but when they get more specific you see that they were all for non-violent offenses: heroin, imitation controlled substances (I'd guess K2 or similar), inhalants. He'd also been deported five times, but each time he returned to the United States. All of it, perhaps, a good conversation-starter on our immigration policy, but none of it related to her death.  If she was murdered, as far as we know it was a random and unfortunate tragedy that she was chosen as the victim, and not related to her race. If it was accidental, as Lopez-Sanchez strenuously claims, then it was an accidental tragedy. He maintains that he found the gun wrapped in cloth while working off some sleeping pills on a bench, and that it discharged when he picked it up, accidentally striking Katie. Since we live in a country where defendants are innocent until proven guilty, we must at least consider the fact that as a fellow human being, he might be telling us the truth. He also seems to show genuine remorse for her death.  In contrast, Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin were some of many examples where the black community felt that it had been oppressed and terrorized by people in positions in power due to the color of their skin. The circumstances surrounding the deaths of both boys were murky. In Michael Brown's case, there was the fear that due process had been robbed from him, that he had been gunned down by an officer of the law. Note that almost nobody thinks that Darren Wilson purposefully decided that he would murder Michael Brown, or that Darren Wilson shot him specifically because he was black. The state of racism is such in the country today that we're nearly there. There are hardly any lynchings, blacks are a protected class, the n-word is slowly being reclaimed, etc. The problem was more that we still live in a country where there is a deeply-bred instinctive fear of black boys and men as more violent, more dangerous, and more criminal. Ferguson has also had a long and painful history of oppression for its majority black population, and the pain there runs deep.  The pain was the same for Trayvon Martin: the belief was that he would still be alive today if he was not black. Most people don't believe that George Zimmerman got up that day wanting to murder a black boy, but the frustration was real that Trayvon was (as far as we know) completely innocent of any wrong-doing, and was murdered by a vigilante who followed him against police orders, engaged with Trayvon, and at the least turned that confrontation into a shooting out of fear of Trayvon. It's also worth noting that George Zimmerman's been involved in multiple firearm-related altercations since the shooting.  So, to TL;DR this as best I can Katie Steinle was an individual tragedy, her death was potentially a murder, potentially manslaughter, and it involved a nonresident alien.   Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Eric Garner and any others I'm missing were examples used by the black community to try and show the many ways that they must live in fear, that they must watch their actions more carefully than people with differently colored skin, that they are viewed with more distrust and suspicion than other races, that they don't feel as protected under the law, that they're lives seem to have less perceived value than people of other colors, et cetera and so forth in addition to being individual tragedies."
Conservative,3ctunc,actofgod22,37,Fri Jul 10 21:07:40 2015 UTC,"oh man, first of all Zimmerman was not ordered by the police to do anything.  A dispatcher (no authority) said he didn't need to continue following him...so he stopped.  You can verify it by listening to the audio, he clearly stops running as soon as she says ""we don't need you to do that"".  Mind you, she didn't say ""stop right there mister!""  We have independent eye witness testimony of the ""ground and pound"" that Martin was doing to Zimmerman.  This isn't Zimmerman's defense, it is what an uninvolved person saw.  Secondly, anyone with a grip on reality knows that any inherent fear towards black men of a particular age is justified by statistics.  Only idiots walk around with zero situational awareness, they are referred to as marks.  You can't fight the numbers, or deny them.  Let's also be real here, no one is freaking out when the black FedEx guy is coming down the street.  No one is clutching their purse in a bank next to the black guy in a suit or the family of four out to dinner.  People look at how people dress, act, who they are with, where they are and what they are doing when making assessments.  It is called being intelligent."

A brief glance at the statistics confirms this to be completely reasonable.    Trayvon was (as far as we know) completely innocent of any wrong-doing   No. Violently beating people and bouncing their head off the pavement is indeed wrong-doing.   followed him against police orders   Who stopped following him after the police told him not to. Who encountered Trayvon a full five minutes after he reported to his girlfriend about the ""creepy ass cracker"" yet only managed to clear a distance of less than 100 yards during this time frame when he clearly could've just continued home. But ""science is defined between a particular object and a particular knower"", ""facts be racist"", etc.    turned that confrontation into a shooting out of fear of Trayvon.   Or out of a fear of brain damage from getting his head bounced off the pavement. Whichever suits your narrative.    It's also worth noting that George Zimmerman's been involved in multiple firearm-related altercations since the shooting.   Well maybe if people would stop trying to murder this fucking guy for a few minutes.

I understand your concerns here about Trayvon, and there's enough doubt in what actually happened that I'd be reluctant to discuss Trayvon Martin at much greater length.

Conservative,3ctunc,timtom45,-13,Fri Jul 10 22:13:35 2015 UTC,"We'll leave Brown alone since that one's a clusterfuck and I don't know which narrative, if any, I support. I am sorry for not fully considering and expounding upon the Trayvon case, because it is true that Zimmerman had abrasions on the back of his head. He most likely was attacked by Trayvon, and Trayvon probably did have opportunities to escape the situation without attacking Zimmerman.  However, Trayvon was predated upon by a stranger, an armed man, and a civilian. The middle sequence of events is ambiguous, but Zimmerman did follow him, he did arm himself, and he did shoot Trayvon to death. Trayvon had no chance to explain that he himself, perhaps, was afraid for his life. No matter the circumstances, as well, it seemed to be that Trayvon would not have been stalked and killed at all had he been a white teenager.  I have no ready answer for you about sanctuary cities, except that it does seem illegal and it does seem to subvert federal law. However, I don't think the fact that San Francisco is a sanctuary city had anything to do with the death of Katie Steinle, any more than SF's parks & recreation department is to blame for installing park benches Juan could sleep on.   For more literature and statistics on immigrant crime that liberals might be reading:  http://articles.latimes.com/2013/dec/03/science/la-sci-sn-immigrant-violence-antisocial-behavior-20131203  http://reason.com/archives/2014/07/11/immigrants-are-less-criminal-than-native  http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/anecdotes-evidence-setting-record-straight-immigrants-and-crime-0  I would love to see your own articles related to immigrant crime, because I really would like to learn more if I'm turning a blind eye to something.  It seems to be that in almost every metric, immigrants – from all parts of the world, both documented and undocumented – are on average less prone to crime or anti-social behavior than native-born Americans. If it had been an American homeless person who had found/acquired a gun and accidentally/purposefully shot Katie Steinle, I doubt that Megyn Kelly would be calling for a response for President Obama. That she has at all seems like a cruel way to twist a tragedy to support the narrative she wants: that undocumented immigrants are dangerous, and that it's Obama's fault."

Trayvon wasn't afraid for his life.  Zimmerman stopped following trayvon and waited peacefully for police.  Trayvon had ample opportunity to explain himself.   Instead he left his house and ambushed zimmerman.  Trayvon attacked Zimmerman first.

Requirements for permanent residency   have attended an institution of higher learning or served in the United States military for at least 2 years and if discharged, have received an honorable discharge pass another series of background checks continue to demonstrate good moral character   The headline asked specifically why Obama was ignoring the murder of Katie Steinle.

Maybe you could help me by telling me more about why you think that President Obama should give a statement on her death, when so many other murders, as you agree, also go without one.

Conservative,3ctunc,timtom45,5,Sat Jul 11 06:09:14 2015 UTC,"I think you're right; the cases of Katie Steinle and Trayvon Martin or Michael Brown are quite different and it would be a mistake to try to draw too many specific comparisons. However, one similarity they do share is that they exemplify larger concerns held by Americans that include criticisms of government and its methods of law-enforcement. It's true that Katie Steinle's murder does not involve the same racial elements that Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown's did, but there's no rule that the President must only speak on crimes involving race. We shouldn't pretend that this was just another everyday, local murder with no wider implications to speak of. It involved failures on multiple levels of government and raised some serious questions about the consequences of sanctuary city policies.  I've also seen some people say that the reason Obama should not comment on Katie Steinle is because it'd be ridiculous to expect him to speak on every single murder that occurs in the country. I think this is a bit dishonest. Nobody has argued that the reason he should comment on Steinle is because he should comment on every murder. They're saying that the details of this particular murder reflect widespread criticisms of immigration policy that ought be acknowledged. Whether this argument is right or wrong—it shouldn't be twisted into something it's not."

They're saying that the details of this particular murder reflect widespread criticisms of immigration policy that ought be acknowledged.    This hit the nail on the head. No one is asking Obama to comment on every violent crime, but this isn't a typical violent crime. A woman in San Francisco was allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant that has been deported five times. Meanwhile, Obama is trying to push forward with his amnesty agenda in Congress. While I understand that the illegal immigrant accused of the murder would likely not have been granted amnesty under Obama's plan, a discussion about securing the border still needs to be brought up. If there's ever a time for the President to comment on the elephant in the room, it is now. Obama has more valid reasons to comment on this murder than the death of Trayvon Martin, which was only made important due to race baiting and incredibly poor journalism.   Of course, since this alleged murder doesn't help him politically, Obama isn't going to comment. There's really nothing more to it than that."

Here are sources as to why the so-called ""Left"" is just a self-righteous mob martyring dead bodies for their various self-interests.     The Trayvon Martin Controversy is a bunch of Projections of Racism. It was a political lynching of the worst kind I have ever seen in my life.  That is the FBI did a full investigation(s) and found none.  Just because a population feels sensitive (i.e., vulnerable to racism) does not mean ""racism existed"".  The media had a hey day and the very political ideology value minded people to keep in check fueled it!  Thus ""Liberals"" who defend such nonsense based on purely a populations who associate by the color of skin and were not even there are The bigots.  There is no worse form of projection on another person than Racism, mmmmmkay?  Especially given Mr. Zimmerman is a person of color, himself.  (can't wait for the hispanic = white BS.  Yet his Mother is Peruvian with ancestry of Chattel Slavery -- ouch!).  Now, here's the two hitters:  http://law2.umkc.edu/.../zimmerman1/zimmermanaccount.html   All that really matters, however, is that Zimmerman--who for forty seconds endured punches to the head and head slams into a concrete sidewalk and who found himself straddled by an attacker... had a reasonable belief that deadly force was necessary... unless the jury concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Zimmerman lacked a reasonable belief that deadly force was necessary, they still owed him an acquittal.  This was not a winnable case--at least not winnable with any jury that looked at the evidence through clear eyes. State Attorney Angela Corey filed charges against Zimmerman under heavy political pressure to do so. But political pressure should not decide who gets charged with a crime and who does not... The Zimmerman trial is a trial that never should have happened.""  <---- Finnito!!! Read it over and over again.     And it would not have even gone to trial if it hadn't been for President Obama.  The sad part is we went from ""Yes we can"" with hope to this divisive mess to; How can you defend your guy just like Clinton with Monica Gate.  Isn't your party/Liberals just the biggest contradiction EVER?  7 allegation of sexual misconduct against Clinton INCLUDING RAPE.  He spoke at Obama's ""War Against Women"" DNC.   Yes, please explain to me!!!  Now:  https://civic.mit.edu/.../mapping-the-trayvon-martin...    The actions taken online and offline, incendiary comments by pundit Geraldo Rivera, and the President’s statement (saying that if he had a son, he would “look a lot like Trayvon”) broadened the story beyond the focus on the events of February 26th. The Pew Research Center reported that the Trayvon Martin story “received the highest level of sustained coverage of any other story with a racial component” they had seen in the past five years of weekly media tracking. (The prior had been the USA had elected the first ever Black Man.) Given the broad media attention paid to the case, what started as a battle for justice around a singular event became a political battle.   Now you have Pelosi singing this Garbage:  https://grabien.com/story.php?id=32042  Good day and turn of the ______ing TV.

'Feelings' is not a valid reason to distinguish these cases.  What distinguish the other cases from Steinle is proof.  There wasn't any evidence of racism in those cases.  None.    This means Obama sent in the posse, including depending on how you look at it, supporting prosecution of an innocent(s), based on nothing more than feelings and speculation.  Doesn't that strike you as a dangerous precedent?    Here's the problem: Obama is creating a self-perpetuating situation.  It is not a means to an end, only a means unto itself.   When facts do not control action, then what's to say when to stop?  More feelings?   Are we supposed to now just investigate everyone and stamp out 'felt racism' until the point where the black community all of a sudden says, ""we feel better now, thanks!""    There's only so much room for bringing the whole weight and power of the Federal Government to bear on innocents, based on pure speculation, before it starts creating racism all by itself."

Seriously, if the border was secured he would not have killed her. Its directly related to her death and the fact that he came back 5 times is stunning. The fact that sancuary cities refuse to obey federal law is also directly related to her death.   Since we live in a country where defendants are innocent until proven guilty, we must at least consider the fact that as a fellow human being, he might be telling us the truth.   You live in a fantasy world. Darren wilson was literally crucified by the media and federal government for being white. The fat black kid had just robbed a store and the feds, media and liberals gave the criminal the benefit of the doubt over a responsible man trying to do his job. This illegal immigrant has already admitted guilt, and whether or not you are dumb enough to believe his story makes no difference.   The problem was more that we still live in a country where there is a deeply-bred instinctive fear of black boys and men as more violent, more dangerous, and more criminal.   Do you live in a closet? Take a look at the crime statistics. Young black men are only 3% of the US population yet commit nearly 50% of all murders. The leading cause of death for black men between 15 and 28 is homocide. The rate at which black men rape, murder rob assault etc is absolutely stunning. You have to be pretty clueless to think whites and asians just fear young black men because they look different. Blacks also commit hate crimes at twice the rate whites do per capita, and 50% dont graduate highschool."

Anyway, although I disagree with the Obama administrations immigration policy, and disagree with San Fransicos policy to not have deported this dirt bag, I think there is a difference between deaths at the hands of Police officers, and a civilians death at the hands of another ""person"". It seems to me there's a big distinction here, since murders (unfortunately) happen every day, whereas murders by police officers of citizens do not.  However, I do not think the officer in the case of Michael Brown was in the wrong. I am almost positive Michael Brown brought his own death because of the surveillance video I saw of him robbing that store earlier in the day, so I know he's likely to fight a cop, which is what the officer said. I am simply trying to give the reason why Obama has not commented on this, I don't see any particular reason for him to do so, it is one of many (again unfortunate) murders that occur every day.

There is a very clear case laid out using statements from HS on this issue that clearly indicate the administration doesn't want to enforce immigration laws and that they don't want to force sanctuary cities to comply with the law.  The reason Obama is ignoring this tragedy is because he knows he undeniably shares in the blame for it.

Conservative,3csisz,JimmyNashville,24,Fri Jul 10 18:53:07 2015 UTC,regulators have to make sure their insurance markets don't collapse. And the big insurers asking for double-digit rate hikes are backing those requests up with cold hard claims data which show that costs per enrollee are far higher than expected. (Which is what critics of the law said would happen.)   Government regulators have to approve the increases because they are warranted.  If they don't the insurance company just leaves that market.  Looks like we are heading in the right direction.  Force enough insurance companies to fold and the feds will be begged by the useful idiots to nationalize health insurance.

The additional costs are covered an insurance company's risk pool - the money they have collected from everyone using their service. Not everyone gets cancer, but those who do are covered by the pool gathered by other payers. A plan where people can choose to only pay for certain things would dry up the pool, and the company would not be able to effectively cover everyone anymore.  The people who never/rarely get sick ""lose"" in this situation because they pay more than they receive back, but they can find comfort knowing ""if something DID come up, my family would be covered"".

Obviously, NYT doesn't want this, so they'll hold off on putting the book onto the list until they're more sure.

This article also seems to want to cherry pick precedents, and church involvement. I skimmed through some of it toward the end, so maybe it was mentioned, but I must point out that there are MANY American churches that don't separate themselves from political activism. Martin Luther King preached civil rights and organized marches and such from the pulpit. The fact that gay marriage has gained such a foothold in this country is not separate from churches either. Liberal churches have been championing LGBT rights for decades now.  Black churches tend to vote Democrat, and black churches will tell you how to vote. From the pulpit. I know; I used to attend one. Is this the sort of thing the author wants for the country? It's all well and good to say ""Why are American churches not getting involved?"" But it's myopic. Many are getting involved, but they would be on the ""wrong side"" for the author.   Then there are all the middle-America ""God and country"" types who may not take political action as clergy or as churches, but as individuals they do. There are also other clergy that are very nationalistic and get very touchy about certain issues, particularly in regards to Israel. But is any of this NECESSARY? Many churches, even if they don't take action as entities, will strongly encourage action on the part of their congregants and foster certain ideas in them. I know of one church that regularly says the Pledge of Allegiance in the middle of service on July 4th.   As a Christian, however, while I love America and believe in fighting for just causes, I don't believe it's the church's job to get involved regularly as a church, or clergy as clergy. Just as I don't believe Supreme Court justices should be legislating, I don't believe clergy should be campaigning or things like that. There are instances in the epistles of Paul where the Apostle seems to come against Christian activism. He tells people to be content as they are, lest they be poor witnesses of the faith to the ruling authorities. He tells slaves not to revolt against their masters, for example. Paul was not ""pro-slavery"", and would urge masters to free their slaves (Philemon suggests this), but neither would an uprising help his cause. This is why, though we admire MLK, I think getting political about civil rights in the pulpit was contrary to Christian teaching.   The sort of action the author espouses is prevalent among churches that focus less on doctrine or scripture and more on tradition or social justice. And it's prevalent among those who lean to the ideological left. I don't think that because I refuse to stoop to the level of my opponent that makes me ""on the wrong side of history"".  EDIT: While we're on the subject, have we forgotten back in the 1990s when certain evangelical churches teamed up with Southern Baptists in an ill-conceived boycott of Disney? My point is that very often when American churches get political or activist, they become more of an embarrassment than anything else."

Should we only remove the flag if every racial problem is completely fixed as a result?  For instance, I would like to see a reduction or elimination of the Federal debt. If someone proposes a small tax cut that doesn't, on its own, eliminate or reduce the debt, I'm not going to oppose it because it doesn't serve to solve all spending problems.   However, West seems to believe that implementing a solution that doesn't solve every related problem is not worth doing. I would challenge him to give an example of ANY government action that solved every problem it was addressing.  Clearly, this undertaking was symbolic. He can pretend like the government is trying to solve all racism by taking the flag down, but anyone with half a brain knows this is more of a political statement rather than a political solution to racism.  Furthermore, conservative outrage over this issue is just plain stupid because this is a brilliant political move on their part. Rather than letting the discussion transition into one about gun control, the Republicans jumped on the opportunity to make it about taking down the flag and that became the national focus. It was genius. If you are conservative and complaining about this, you clearly don't know what you are talking about because this was one of the smoothest political moves of the last 20 years.
