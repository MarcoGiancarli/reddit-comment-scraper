I'm glad STAR_ is pretty content with his life atm, and I think a lot of us can sympathize with the TF2 burnout. Those of us that have been around playing these arena shooters for ages are ready for the next big thing. Could it be Overwatch? I doubt it, what with its slow-as-molasses movement, but who knows."

STAR_,39n285,MooseEatsBear,3,Sat Jun 13 02:43:07 2015 UTC,Im guessing Gorbo Goes to Heaven and the Dreadout Halloween video. Both are under 400k which is below average.

His 2Fast2Quick video is pure gold all the way through, including the description text.  I also love his laid back Story Times, where you really get to know this hardcore but also relatable gamer STAR_.  Lastly I also have to agree with OP that his Basically series is really high quality content all the way thorugh and IMO especially the Microvoltu one. This seven minute long sarcastic breakdown of an abomination of a game like Microvolts is just the kind of video that defines shtur the most for me, even though personal matters and experiences which he of course left out in it are a part of that too."
STAR_,39nit5,theunderratedduck,2,Sat Jun 13 13:31:35 2015 UTC,"There was a QnA video he did, I think it was called ""I'm STAR_, ya know me?"" and he answered a lot of questions, but not one has been able to find it and I'm afraid I'm going insane. I assume he unlisted it/made it private."

Like I haven't played in like 3 months but I didn't really quit it, I still have it, I just have things I wanted to play more right now"
STAR_,38m90r,ayyyyyyyyyyyyy-lmao,9,Fri Jun 5 03:30:54 2015 UTC,"No he is not. He has said on a multitude of occasions that he will probably never quit. Whenever Star_ does not post a TF2 video for 2+ months people will begin to cry that he has quit the game. If you check his twitch account you can see that he regularly streams 4+ hours of TF2. People have to understand that Star_ is not a YouTube gamer. Most of his TF2 videos are updates showing new features in the game. Occasionally he will post a live commentary, but in these he is almost never serious, usually just messing around with Jerma or others."
STAR_,38m90r,theuncertaintortiose,3,Fri Jun 5 05:00:18 2015 UTC,"TF2 is still my favourite game, I don't hate it, I just hate making videos on it. Big difference.   From star's most recent video"
STAR_,38m90r,Almost__Dead,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:36:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah I watched that. So he'll probably make less tf2 videos, but he'll still play it. As I said, he can do whatever he wants, we shouldn't make him do something he doesn't want to so we can have ten minutes of entertainment."
STAR_,38m90r,Almost__Dead,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:32:33 2015 UTC,"Again, gonna quote STAR_   I'm waiting for one of two things: Either for Overwatch to be amazing or TF2 matchmaking to be amazing.   Sounds like he doesn't know what he wants to do. He loves making videos like Sweet Genius, because they are different than what he usually does. And we can't make him do what we want him to do. The reason he is viewed as a TF2 youtuber is because he WAS A tf2 youtuber.   If he dropped TF2 100% and made more videos like Sweet Genius, he'd merge his audience to like that more. It isn't our fault people view him as a tf2 youtuber."

STAR_,37n9rt,Almost__Dead,5,Thu May 28 21:54:59 2015 UTC,"Why would you be afraid to talk? If you don't talk you wouldn't lose anything by being banned anyways. Also the mods will most likely just give you a 1 second time out, and I'm pretty sure they almost never perma ban anyone. If you've watched ster's stream more than once everything gets pretty obvious and really you should just use common sense when talking in chat, if you wouldn't say something in real life to a friend it's probably a bad idea to say it in chat."

STAR_,31tjj4,Alexander_Rex,5,Wed Apr 8 01:50:06 2015 UTC,"STAR_ 100%.  It feels like his original name, albeit was actualy niichts, but he wasn't really called niichts in TF2 for a while.   not a fan of how ster sounds (personally, would have prefered stern, since it would be another german name he would have had and it also means star)  My favourite name STAR's ever dubbed on steam is Nothing(underscore). Don't remeber which video, but I love it because I get the joke at how nichts   means nothing in German and it also has the underscore from STAR. Really clever name.  Note: The name actually had an underscore, but reddit formatting doesn't want me to use that."

Speaking as a big fan of ster's videos, I would certainly not play TF2 less if he stopped."

STAR_,2fs2v7,YourMommasBFF,13,Mon Sep 8 04:11:29 2014 UTC,"I really feel that Star_ is very underappreciated on youtube in general. True he mainly makes TF2 videos, but with so much effort and time put into videos i still do not understand how he has so little subscribers, he deserves at least a couple of million of subscribers in my opinion. The Basically Videos, are absolutely hilarious, all of them, especially Sweet Genius.    There are people on youtube who produce and montage the same shit all the time (prop hunt) or just do silly playthroughs, which frankly have already flooded youtube, and there are just a few people who are worth watching. Star prioritizes entertainment for the viewers over mass volume of videos, and people do not understand that and or do not recognize that, and that is very sad."
STAR_,2fs2v7,trololbaus,7,Mon Sep 8 09:50:52 2014 UTC,"YouTube has grown into a ginormous community that has a lot of everything nowadays, but I believe that more viewers aren't what he wants, but instead viewers that care. Even though he doesn't have millions of subscribers (Jerma too), they get an abnormal amount of likes on their videos and have a dedicated fanbase.   He does deserve more subscribers, but I think he'd appreciate more quality people instead who care about his videos."
STAR_,2fs2v7,trololbaus,2,Mon Sep 8 11:58:43 2014 UTC,"I do agree with you, youtube has become a huge community. As he said, he wants to do videos which he enjoys, not the ones which may be more financially sound as he made the example, i.e. doing something original like Sweet Genius. The same thing goes for Jerma, another hilarious youtuber with original content aimed at actually entertaining the viewers. It is really a shame though that these two youtubers do not get the respect and attention they deserve for their excellent original content. Sadly the intelligence of the majority of youtube viewers is on a level of a 10 year old, zombified by pop trends.   And I do agree, he would appreciate more quality people commenting and providing feedback, as the youtube comments are just a joke in this regard."
STAR_,2fs2v7,DemeGeek,5,Mon Sep 8 12:16:23 2014 UTC,"I sent him a message on YouTube, I hope he gets it and that Google isn't going to be a butt about the whole Google+ thing.  I didn't find this subreddit until over half-way through my message (I searched for ""STER"" and ""Niitchs"" but didn't think to look for ""STAR_"") so I continued on there. I might send him an email with the same body but with the subject ""In case YouTube was being a butt"" or something.  I suggested that he look into joining a fan community such as this one so that he had a group of people, that he knows are fans, to talk to about his videos. Plus, if he tells people that he hangs out here then the sub will gain more readers and it would be a win-win!"
