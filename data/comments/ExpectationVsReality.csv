ExpectationVsReality,3e2iup,XirallicBolts,17,Tue Jul 21 15:48:25 2015 UTC,"However, the foods themselves are not necessarily carcinogenic, even if they contain trace amounts of carcinogens, because the gastrointestinal tract protects itself against carcinomas by shedding its outer layer continuously. Furthermore, detoxification enzymes, such ascytochromes P450 have increased activities in the gut due to the normal requirement for protection from food-borne toxins. Thus, in most cases, small amounts of benzo[a]pyrene are metabolized by gut enzymes prior to being passed into the blood.    And it only applied specifically to charbroiled food as a byproduct of using coal on the grill."

Since then its just morphed into a big party that means she's a ""woman"" now, even if she's not going to be married. A bar mitzfah of sorts but sadly one that didn't mean the level of freedom or independence for it does for males.

ExpectationVsReality,3dv9nr,aravena,7,Sun Jul 19 21:14:58 2015 UTC,All these posts do for me is make me realize how stupid it is to pay a lot to decorate something you're about to eat.
ExpectationVsReality,3dv9nr,finreddit,34,Mon Jul 20 01:41:12 2015 UTC,"Thing is, you get what you pay for.  The cake on the bottom is easily in the $250-300 range depending on where you live and may be even higher.  Getting a cake to look that clean takes lots of skill that you should pay for.  Not everyone will pay that much for a cake.  That's why grocery stores sell sheet cakes for $30.  The problem comes from people who give a $300 cake as a reference picture, then balk at the price when a skilled baker quotes them.  They turn around to some yahoo amateur on Facebook who says they can do it for $100 and you end up with the above cake.  Also, I'd like to see this free cake she got.  Decorators who can do this level work are usually busy with paying customers and don't have time to donate cakes to people who go to the cheaper less skilled person."
ExpectationVsReality,3dv9nr,pumpkinhead002,15,Mon Jul 20 02:13:23 2015 UTC,The decorator probably should have told her that she couldn't do the cake how she wanted though.  Edit: I do agree with you though!
ExpectationVsReality,3dv9nr,Hotman_Paris,15,Mon Jul 20 02:29:00 2015 UTC,"Man, I hope some day I'll be rich enough to spend $100 on something I will later turn into poop."

ExpectationVsReality,3dv9nr,ericaashlee21,5,Mon Jul 20 07:04:46 2015 UTC,Yeah there would be no way I would pay $100 for that.

ExpectationVsReality,3ddpuv,Mattfornow,7,Sun Jul 19 20:34:05 2015 UTC,Im confused on what you're trying to say here....
ExpectationVsReality,3ddpuv,Mattfornow,21,Wed Jul 15 16:25:31 2015 UTC,"The first shot looks dramatic because it looks like she's right next to the surf. Well, with the second shot, you can see that's because she actually is...too close.  With a telephoto lens, you can make use of lens compression to make the background seem much closer than it actually is.  see here:  http://learnmyshot.com/telephoto-lens-perspective-compression-and-the-angle-of-view/  it's how film directors get shots like this without putting extras in the path of an airplane. Other examples are when actors dive away from a large explosion - which is actually far behind them, but telephoto lenses make them seem close."
ExpectationVsReality,3ddpuv,I_am_bovo,10,Wed Jul 15 19:11:57 2015 UTC,"The shot here with this model would loose something, though. Any further from the surf and shes not laying on wet sand. No reflection."

These types of models are for us.  In case you haven't noticed, tattoos have become really common place and are very quickly becoming socially normalized. I work a customer facing office job with a giant mass of writhing tentacles on my arm, which I have exposed often, and not once have I gotten any reaction from a client other than ""Cool, can I see that?""

ExpectationVsReality,3dbn1b,_Bonkaholic_,2,Wed Jul 15 16:33:06 2015 UTC,"I think the real thing is far more fascinating than the mock-up. There was an AMA with one of the New Horizons team members yesterday (or the day before, don't remember which), where he said that the current color photo we have of Pluto, the one seen here, was taken with a camera that sees in the same visual range that we do. So the amount of doctoring on it is very small -- what you see in the picture is what you'd see if you were floating above Pluto.  Also, Pluto has an atmosphere, but it's very thin. Nowhere near as prominent as the concept drawing.  And the best part is: Pluto has a heart. A big ol' heart for all of humanity to see. That's way cooler than fantasy."

I plant a metric shit ton of flowers every year, in beds, indoors, in pots- I usually spend about a hundred bucks on good, hardy annuals, plant seeds for the native wildflowers and easy stuff like four-o-clocks and morning glories, then I inevitably get duped into buying a few of the boxes like the one in your pictures. I wouldn't say I have a green thumb, but after a few years of trial and error, I've gotten pretty good at growing a large variety of flowers from seeds.   Those as-seen-on-tv fuckers always suck. They never bloom well or at the same time and often it's one flower you want and a hundred gangly nasty black-eyed suzies or some other filler shit flower with teeny tiny little faded blooms.   I will buy them again next year. And get duped again. However, the amaryllis bulbs that come in their own little pot actually do manage to turn about about 70% of the time."

When it is slow at the store the pizzas look wonderful but on a busy night at 6 pm they are going to be ragged looking.  sucks that you had a bad one. try again  next time in the cheap pizza lotto."

ExpectationVsReality,3ckeu9,shamus727,39,Thu Jul 9 14:04:26 2015 UTC,"Going to repost a story I told before in a different sub:  I dated a girl from Centerville, OH for a few years and I am from CT. When I went to Ohio to meet her family one of the first things we did was go to Skyline because she worked there in high school and talked about it a lot as a ""real Ohio"" thing.  The ""chili"" was the consistency of a toilet bowl after a night of heavy drinking and taco bell. It tasted like what I imagine boiled dog food would taste like.  As an Italian-American I was mortified that this ""chili"" was served over what they called ""spaghetti"" and my gf told me local Ohioans thought of it like an Italian dish. The ""spaghetti"" was maybe slightly better than ramen grade and was definitely not improved by the meat barf and ""cheese"" it was topped with.  Despite my internal reaction to the abominations in front of me I had to pretend to my gf that it ""tasted pretty good"" and ""I just can't finish because it's so filling.""  An hour or so later we get to her parents place and within 20 minutes of meeting them for the first time I had to literally RUN to the toilet because that meat diarrhea had surged through my body at the speed of light and was about to hold me hostage for 15 minutes of loud, explosive, first impression ruining Skyline Shits. You could not pay me enough money to ever eat at that place again.  EDIT   I certainly didn't mean to set off an anti-Ohio mood with my post guys, sorry if it came off that way. I just wanted to share a funny story from my past and I guess it offended some.   My experience of Skyline was definitely shaped by the way my ex-gf presented it to me with months of hype talking it up because I guess it was one of the unique Ohio things she had (and had worked there before) compared to all the CT things (New Haven pizza, seafood etc) around us and, obviously, it was not cuisine I enjoyed. I'm sure in a different setting (drunk and starving?) it might not have been that bad on a hotdog maybe.  I hope you can just enjoy my (somewhat embellished as /u/professorpan noted) story as fish out of water/meet the parents/diarrhea humor as intended and not take offense because you happen to live in a place where a corporation sells gross slop to people and calls it food. That happens everywhere."
ExpectationVsReality,3ckeu9,cignasty,26,Wed Jul 8 18:26:17 2015 UTC,I've never thought of Skyline as an Italian dish.  Nor have I heard that from anybody I know.  That is one of most ridiculous things I've ever heard.

ExpectationVsReality,3ckeu9,ChewbaccaFart,23,Fri Jul 10 09:25:02 2015 UTC,"Cincinnati-style chili ranks dead last on a list of each state's most popular food items   For the mercifully unacquainted, ""Cincinnati chili,"" the worst regional foodstuff in America or anywhere else, is a horrifying diarrhea sludge (most commonly encountered in the guise of the ""Skyline"" brand) that Ohioans slop across plain spaghetti noodles and hot dogs as a way to make the rest of us feel grateful that our own shit-eating is (mostly) figurative. The only thing ""chili"" about it is the shiver that goes down your spine when you watch Ohio sports fans shoveling it into their maws on television and are forced to reckon with the cold reality that, for as desperately as you might cling to faltering notions of community and universality, ultimately your fellow human beings are as foreign and unknowable to you as the surface of Pluto, and you are alone and always have been and will die alone, a world unto yourself unmarked and unmapped and totally, hopelessly isolated.  But wait! This abominable garbage-gravy isn't just sensorily and spiritually disgusting—it's culturally grotesque, too! What began as an ethnic curio born of immigrant make-do—a Greek-owned chili parlor that took its ""Skyline"" name from its view of the city of Cincinnati—is now a hulking private-equity-owned corporate monolith that gins up interest in its unmistakably abhorrent product by engineering phony groups of ""chili fanatics"" to camp out in advance of the opening of new chains, in locations whose residents would otherwise see this shit-broth for what it is and take up torches and truncheons to drive it back into the wilderness.  Whatever virtue this bad-tasting Z-grade atrocity once contained derived from its exemplification of a set of certain cherished American fables—immigrant ingenuity, the cultural melting pot, old things combining into new things—and has now been totally swamped and consumed by different and infinitely uglier American realities: the commodification of culture; the transmutation of authentic artifacts of human life into hollow corporate brand divisions; the willingness of Americans to slop any horrible goddamn thing into their fucking mouths if it claims to contain some byproduct of a cow and comes buried beneath a pyramid of shredded, waxy, safety-cone-orange ""cheese.""  Cincinnati chili is the worst, saddest, most depressing goddamn thing in the world. If it came out of the end of your digestive system, you would turn the color of chalk and call an ambulance, but at least it'd make some sense. The people of Ohio see nothing wrong with inserting it into their mouths, which perhaps tells you everything you need to know about the Buckeye State. Don't eat it. Don't let your loved ones eat it."

The shower is amazing. It's set up where it spray water at you from three sides like a triangle. And not weak little puny sprays either, it can be hard enough to take paint off ya. And it stays hot forever.  And it even has a bench to sit down and enjoy the spray and scrub up.  It's amazing."

Now, that's nothing new to me, obviously, but my husband's eyes went wiiiiide, like he just saw the most unimaginable thing ever. I couldn't help it, I laughed so much.

I will be sure to read next time, however, a summary would have be nice instead of having to go through 14 pages to make a simple bread. Listing ingredients and tools should be top of the list. ;)"

I feel like those 3 things sum up about 90% of /r/expectationvsreality cake posts (50% or better are summed up in #1)"
ExpectationVsReality,3cakz4,the_corruption,14,Mon Jul 6 13:58:54 2015 UTC,I feel like 90% of cake fails could be prevented by not dumping the icing on the second the cake comes out of the goddamn oven. What did you think would happen???

No. Was it ever intended to look like the one on the left? No. Icing Smiles made this statement on their Facebook page:   ""This is a very personal post for me. What has happened in the last few days as a result of a popular cake blog has caused me to ride a roller coaster of emotion. Unless you have been in a cave, you know that one of our cakes was unfavorably compared against the INSANELY talented work of McGreevy Cakes. It has gone viral and it broke my heart. My heart broke for the baker because I know how much of herself she puts into her donations. My heart broke for the family should they come across the posts because it may take from their joy of receiving the gift. It broke for our team whose extraordinary efforts were used in this way. Our Sugar Angel wasn't commissioned to copy Shawna's work, she was asked for a Frozen cake for a sick child and she did just that. I am well aware that all photos we publish are public domain but to use the efforts of volunteers serving medically fragile children as a source of humor is tasteless. I am well aware that my opinions are biased but I see the efforts, stress, tears and passion of our volunteers and I hate to see them lead to ridicule in any forum. In fairness to the original blogger, we do not know if they were aware of the source of the cake and as soon as it was brought to their attention, it was removed. (THANK YOU!) When I finally got past the initial shock, I fearfully reached out to our Sugar Angel, Lisa to offer my sympathy and boy did she change my attitude. Her facebook page was loaded with comments to which she graciously replied with humor and self-deprecation. She even commented that she knew it wasn't her best work and maybe Elsa was getting back from rehab. The best part was that she didn't care because she made a child happy. Lisa, I have the utmost respect for you. Thank you for all you do to make my vision come to life. I am proud to share this cake and claim it as ours! - Tracy""  This company contracts out with bakers who donate their time and resources to make cakes for critically ill children and their siblings. I have personal experience with this company as they made cakes for my children when one was overcoming medical problems. I just want to say that this company is amazing and this woman tried her best to make a little girl happy and succeeded!

ExpectationVsReality,3c4en8,noheroes90,2,Sat Jul 4 20:10:42 2015 UTC,Having to go to a specialty shop and paying out the nose depends on where you live.

ExpectationVsReality,3c4en8,edwards12691,4,Sun Jul 5 01:14:19 2015 UTC,There's a place in Columbus called Mikey's. They have hot dogs with pizza instead of the bun. And it is fantastic.

ExpectationVsReality,3c3d5f,Plus13,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:57:26 2015 UTC,"Don’t over mix or under mix that’s how you get flat or cracked cookies. When you add some flour to the eggs gently fold the mix by hand and count every fold up to 50-60 strokes. The finished mix should be smooth and viscous. You can easily overmix with a stand mixer especially if you don't have a lot of experience, also have your eggs at room temperature before whipping."
ExpectationVsReality,3c3d5f,penguinsuicide,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:09:09 2015 UTC,"The stand mixer isn't used for mixing the macaronage though, its only used for the Italian meringue, the macaronage is mixed by hand. Unless that's what you're saying can be overmixed? Even still, this is how thick the macaronage comes out with Italian meringue. You have to actually beat it pretty hard to deflate it, so it is very hard to overmix."

ExpectationVsReality,3c3d5f,LethargicMonkey,6,Sat Jul 4 11:38:04 2015 UTC,Okay I'm no expert but a few things I have found that help    draw circles on the underside of the parchment to use as a template for piping the batter  slam the baking tray on a table a few times to get some of the air bubbles out  let the piped batter rest for like 20 minutes before baking until the tops are a bit dried out   I have never tried the Italian method and I'm still having mixed success when I bake them but these tips helped me get more consistent results

Dusty salt shakers. A bowl of pickles for an appetizer. Drinks with NO ICE. Gospel music playing from a small cassette player on the counter. NASCAR merchandise displayed in glass cabinets.

ExpectationVsReality,3bu2my,ambercore1000,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:18:22 2015 UTC,that is very cool. Really great way to deal with low light overexposure. I do minimal product shots (in terms of messing with the deeper camera settings) and I never knew what ETTR was all about.

ExpectationVsReality,3bu2my,wazoheat,3,Fri Jul 3 05:54:32 2015 UTC,"TBH, charts always overestimate the number of stars you'll see for these kind of evening events, light pollution or not. Venus, what with being closer to the Sun than us, never appears very far from it in our sky view, so morning or evening twilight is usually a factor in Venus-centric events like this one. And because of how close to the Sun the planets appear, by the time it's dark enough to easily see the stars with the naked eye or with a camera, everything is in the same thick  horizon haze that dims the sun to a directly-observable red blob at sunset.   Even with the sun's brightening though, evening photos are dim enough to be hard to acquire for a typical point-and-shoot digital camera, much less the still very small camera in a  modern cellphone, which still has a light-collecting diameter smaller than your eye. The magazine-worthy shots we ooh and aah over are taken with high-end, very sensitive cameras, often with multiple images digitally overlaid to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. This brings out the bright dots that are the planets from the variably-bright background pixels caused by tiny variations in the camera's chip.   Source: have spent way too much time trying to get pictures of the night sky, with mixed results.  TL;DR Space is hard to photograph, reality is still a damn good picture."

ExpectationVsReality,3bnv1w,jewdai,14,Tue Jun 30 19:35:46 2015 UTC,I used this recipe:  http://hostthetoast.com/crock-pot-general-tsos-chicken/  Maybe I used too much corn starch. Didn't include sherry cooking wine. Thank you for the tips :)
ExpectationVsReality,3bnv1w,triksterx,24,Tue Jun 30 19:47:44 2015 UTC,"1/4 C of corn starch is enough to thicken a half gallon of liquid into a gelatinous mess. Also, when using cornstarch, the thickness of the sauce is dependent on two things: amount of corn starch and heat. Any thickening you have to do should be done just before you serve, not 20 minutes before you take it off the heat. Whoever wrote that part of the instructions doesn't seem to have ever actually thickened a sauce using corn starch."
ExpectationVsReality,3bnv1w,triksterx,5,Tue Jun 30 20:27:09 2015 UTC,"It absolutely can, but the hotter you are cooking, the faster the sauce is going to thicken. The temps you would have a slow cooker at, it would only take corn starch a couple minutes to congeal to the point of eating jello instead of sauce. Especially if you add way too much, like this recipe tells you to do. Not understanding how corn starch works is a real good way to ruin a perfectly good recipe."

I own her Land of Plenty and her Revolutionary one, the Hunan cookbook... don't have any of her more recent ones since then but I've looked through them. I highly recommend her memoir.. Shark Find & Sichuan Pepper. I checked it out from the library and finished very quickly, it was fascinating. Her experience being a white woman in China back then, such a foreign land.. her descriptions of trying the local foods and the impressions they had on her. And, she gives recipes too. It's a great book."

I ate it right away. Tastes pretty good, I'd give it about 8/10. Bun was soft and warm, inside was toasted a bit. Lobster was well drained and cooked, with not too much mayo or salt with a hint of lemon. Some lettuce and celery underneath to keep the bread from getting soggy, but not so much as to be filler.

ExpectationVsReality,3bdlrw,StephenFish,36,Tue Jun 30 20:12:49 2015 UTC,"This does work, but there are some lesser known tricks that also apply to regular cookie baking:     Keep the dough cold to the last minute. Don't let the dough set out while you preheat. Don't let the dough get warm in your hands. Scoop, pinch, pull from the batch and do it quickly! Preheat! Always, always, always allow full preheat of the oven. This allows the dough to go from cold mass to a cooking temperature with minimal 'sloppy' state in between. This means less spreading or, in this case, running down the slope. Try a dark pan and don't spray. You will have mixed results depending on the type of pan and coatings, but you shouldn't spray a pan when baking cookies or biscuits. The spray heats up faster and can burn the bottom of the cookies or biscuits before the other bits of the food are done. The dark pan allows radiant heat to be absorbed by the pan quicker, which will give you mixed results because it can cause the surface of the food to cook faster than the rest. This could be a good thing if you want something to sear."
ExpectationVsReality,3bdlrw,shutthefuckupandpun,6,Sun Jun 28 15:45:05 2015 UTC,This is what I was thinking. They should've put the tray with the dough smooshed on it into the freezer for a bit before baking it.
ExpectationVsReality,3bdlrw,EmilyamI,2,Sun Jun 28 16:39:15 2015 UTC,"You would think keeping dough cold and letting the oven get to temperature before starting it would be common cooking sense.  At the very least, the oven thing."
ExpectationVsReality,3bdlrw,arhombus,109,Sat Jul 4 17:05:05 2015 UTC,I think the trick is making the dough thicker or pastier than usual so when they do melt they dont go that far.
ExpectationVsReality,3bdlrw,JohnnyZondo,75,Sun Jun 28 05:34:14 2015 UTC,Might also help to refrigerate the tray with the dough on it.

ExpectationVsReality,3bdlrw,ConwayTwittysHair,34,Sun Jun 28 10:35:42 2015 UTC,"Actually, the famous pinterest cookie bowls are made on a pan specifically made for it, so most people who just turn a pan upside down end up with this awful mess.   http://www.amazon.com/Wilton-Nonstick-6-Cavity-Cream-Cookie/dp/B004CYELT6"
ExpectationVsReality,3bdlrw,feralcatromance,5,Sun Jun 28 12:06:15 2015 UTC,"It would still require a slightly different consistancy of cookie dough. Chocolate chip cookies have a lot of butter/sugar, which allows them to ""spread"" as they warm up.   On the other hand, a drier sugar cookie with less butter and more flour, will hold it's shape.   You could always play with other factors like starting with a cold pan and a hotter oven to sort of try to flash them into holding their shape, but then they wouldn't be cooked throughout.   Since the pan you've linked to doesn't have a rim of sorts to keep the cookie dough from spreading, I doubt it would make a huge difference. Although I will admit that having a shallower shaped bowl would help to cut down on spread due to gravity, the pan isn't the only difference."

ExpectationVsReality,3bdlrw,Fuck_Best_Buy,10,Sun Jun 28 06:21:24 2015 UTC,What do you have against Best Buy?
ExpectationVsReality,3bdlrw,jman377355,6,Sun Jun 28 06:28:46 2015 UTC,"I added an update to the end of the story for those who have already read it.  I bought an Asus gaming laptop in February of 2014. The employee asked if I wanted to buy the warranty, and said it covers ANYTHING except submersion in fluids. I said sure, why not. Fast forward to a few months ago. I'm at my house playing a game and I get a call from my father in law saying that my wife has been in an accident. He got a call from the police, and all that could tell him was that she was on her way to the local hospital. I grab my computer and run out the door. I realize I left my keys inside. Set my computer on my car, run back inside to get my keys, and jump in my car. I live next to the loop, so I turn on to it. A few seconds later I see something fly off the back of my car. FUCK. Pull over, grab it off the side of the road (it's destroyed of course) and get to the hospital. Luckily she only has a broken leg.  Next day I go to best buy and tell the customer service person what happened. She sends me to geek squad where they tell me it's not covered. Talk to manager, he refuses. Also refuses to put me into contact with the district manager. He says that since I have no way to prove what the employee told me about the warranty I'm shit out of luck.  Call a few stores and ask the computer employees if it would be covered. A couple say yes, get transferred to the manager, he denies they said that and that they are telling him they didn't say that. Fucking wow.  Call corporate, they say the same. I give them the employee's ID number from the receipt, and they refuse to look it up so we can ask them what they said the warranty covers. She refuses to give me the district managers contact info. I ask to speak to her manager, and after 30 minutes on hold I hung up because I had to pick up my daughter. Tried again later and had an hour wait time both times.  I've filed a complaint with the BBB with no response.  I've also contacted stores and I tell them what happened to my laptop, but I say i didn't have the insurance on it and they tell me that would be covered 100% had I had the warranty. Then tell them I did have the warranty and they immediately say they are going to grab a manager then deny ever saying that.  I spend $1,500-$2,000 a year at best buy and never buy large purchases off Amazon because I want to be able to walk in and get my problem solved. Since that now has no benefit, fuck it. I'll just put my Amazon prime to work.  A lot of people start talking shit every time I post this saying its a warranty and they don't claim it covers accidental damage, so here is an image from their site about the warranty:  http://i.imgur.com/KXrUXZ3.jpg  http://imgur.com/EyKsYXf  Update:a few days ago I emailed the CEO my experience and a member of the ""Best Buy Executive Resolution Team"" contacted me and told me they would not be upholding the warranty."
ExpectationVsReality,3bdlrw,Fuck_Best_Buy,2,Sun Jun 28 06:35:18 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if this will get you anywhere but you might be able to take this to the Federal trade commission if you want to go a step beyond. I am surprised that contacting the CEO got you nowhere.

ExpectationVsReality,3aq71j,dapuipui,51,Mon Jun 22 16:46:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you care, but it is due to the temperature being too high.   Ovens, specially older ones, don't always heat to the temperature you set on the dial.   They tend fluctuate in temperature and have hot and cold spots.   You can compensate for this by getting an oven thermometer that will give you an accurate reading, and doing the toast test to find where the hot spot is.   Next time you do this recipe, try lowering the temperature by about 25 F and increasing the baking time by increments of 2 minutes until you achieve the desired result.   EDIT: I forgot to point out why:   In the first image, the bread is clearly risen and puffy, that requires a longer and gentler baking time. The cheese and filling has melted and spilled out of the second one, the temperature was too high."

ExpectationVsReality,3am2q6,parplayaz,20,Sun Jun 21 18:41:31 2015 UTC,The leches is suppose to be absorbed from the bottom. I believe you cook it first then afterwards you woukd flip it upside down onto a pan that has a layer of the tres leches.

ExpectationVsReality,3am2q6,Nerrickk,3,Mon Jun 22 00:51:27 2015 UTC,The secret is poking it with a fork or knife so it absorbs the milk but it isn't noticeable. On average I prefer using spacing of about 1 inch between each puncture. Also don't pour your whole milk mix at once do it in stages so it absorbs evenly and doesn't just sink to the bottom.  Hope this helps :)

I picked out a plum-colored tea-length dress with a lot of sequins around the waistline and received a bright purple tube-sock dress covered in craft glitter. We ended up going to Sears.

I don't even remember what the Sears dress looked like. I do remember my shoes- woof. They were black two-inch clog-looking wedge sandals… The sandal part was this two inch wide black band of semi-stretchy material. I tried to google them just now but apparently they don't even make shoes that ugly anymore. These are close.  Just picture something even more… clunky."

My older sister decided to just pay the extra money as it was still an okay price, only to be e-mailed the next day by FlightNetwork stating that the flight she booked doesn't exist at that price.  Fuck you FlightNetwork! If you can't offer that fare, then don't advertise it and certainly don't accept payment for it. It's not even about the money for me, it's okay if the flight genuinely costs more, but don't waste my time with lies and fake search results."

They do that two more times, changing the dates and times. But since I had already paid I guess it didn't matter that much. Which is good I guess.   Then a couple weeks ago they sent me another email telling me I have the choice between two flight choices. The times that I had originally bought the ticket for, and the final times they told me I had to take.

If I buy a 50in TV from brand A, and a month or so later a different store is having a sell on 50in tv's from brand B, would it be reasonable to go back and ask them to price match?   Probably not.   I'm not going to advocate for this website, it seems like they're in the business of being intentionally misleading.  But I would recommend making sure you understand how a company's policy actually works before making your purchase based on how you assume the policy works."

They make it themselves in their plant in Orlando with all sorts of seasonal flavors. It's a full half gallon(2qt) vs 1.5qt of most everything else. It's nice and thick and their flavors are rarely overpowering. Most are just perfect. I like them better than premium haggendaz type brands for half the price.  And lots of the time they go on sale for buy two for $7 which still rings up just $3.50 per full half gallon. These sales are kinda random, last for a week, sometimes two weeks in a row.  My favorite is their chocolate chip cookie dough. The vanilla and whatever other flavors they use for it complements the dough perfectly."

ExpectationVsReality,3a3brn,Organic_Mechanic,7,Wed Jun 17 10:54:04 2015 UTC,"I'm just an amateur ice cream enthusiast still figuring it out as I go, so I lack technical knowledge on most of this stuff. But let's take a look. I got the ingredients from their website:  INGREDIENTS: Modified Milk Ingredients, Water, Sugar, Cookie Pieces (Sugar, Enriched Wheat Flour, Vegetable Oil [Soybean, Palm And Palm Kernel Oil], Cocoa, Yellow Corn Flour, Dextrose, Chocolate, Baking Soda, Monocalcium Phosphate, Corn Starch, Salt, Natural Flavour, Soy Lecithin, Milk Ingredients), Glucose, Hydrogenated Coconut Oil, Mono & Diglycerides, Natural And Artificial Flavour, Cellulose Gum, Guar Gum, Polysorbate 80, Carrageenan. May Contain Peanuts And/Or Other Nuts. Ingredients and Nutrition Facts are current as of 3/1/13. Please see shelf packaging for any changes.  There are a lot of substitutions that make it crap compared to good homemade ice cream. But there's nothing insidious, despite the chemical-sounding names.  'Modified milk ingredients', water, sugar, glucose, hydrogenated coconut oil, mono & diglycerides, flavour, cellulose gum, guar gum, polysorbate 80, carrageenan.  I'm most curious what 'modified milk ingredients' means. I would have guessed it means milk powder, reconstituted with water, but if that were the case you'd assume that would use more water than milk powder, and water would be the #1 ingredient? Very irritating that they can get away with such a vague term. 'Milk ingredients' is presumably what cream would fall under as well. Cream is important because it's the major source of milk fat, which impedes ice crystal formation, and gives you a nice mouthfeel. I assume the failure to meet some specific % threshold of one or more out of milk, cream, and milkfat is why this product can not legally be called ""ice cream"".  Sugar, obviously important. People are hard on sugar. But more than for sweetness, you need sugar to give your ice cream structure, because it reduces lowers the freezing point and impedes ice crystal formation.  Glucose = more sugar.  Hydrogenated coconut oil. I'm not totally sure on the context here - I've never researched coconut oil or hydrogenation. I assume it boosts the fat content, if they skimped on milk fat by not using enough milk/cream.  Flavour. Artificially synthesised vanillin is cheaper than proper vanilla bean extract.  Monoglycerides and diglycerides and polysorbate 80 are emulsifiers, which cause the fats (milk fat and whatever other fats they've got in there, like the hydrogenated coconut oil) to coalesce. In homemade, custard-based ice cream you would use egg yolks for this coagulating effect. Egg yolks are better in some ways and worse in some ways. They give a richer flavour and thicker texture. They're (I assume) more expensive and perishable, but I say that not knowing anything much about glycerides. They can also overwhelm the ice cream with their own yolky flavour and yellow colour, which is a downside if you want a cleaner flavour and whiter colour.  Cellulose gum (from wood pulp some plant fibre source I'm not sure of), guar gum (from guar beans, a legume), and carrageenan (from seaweed) are stabilisers. They help prevent minimise the size of ice crystals that form when ice cream is frozen. They also help your ice cream to hold onto the air bubbles that you churn in. The /u/taco9 post linked elsewhere in this thread describes this 'overrun' - whipped-in air - very negatively, and I'm sure that skepticism is warranted. But some air in your ice cream is good, because it makes it smooth and scoopable. One problem you face when making ice cream at home is you churn it, it has a nice soft texture. Then you transfer it to a container and put it in the freezer, and before your freezer can properly freeze it, it partially melts, loses that air, and then freezes into a spoon-bendingly rock solid brick.  For comparison, my homemade ice cream uses milk, cream, egg yolks, sugar, vanilla extract, and xanthan gum (from the Xanthomonas campestris bacteria! The x makes it sound sexier)."
ExpectationVsReality,3a3brn,01111000marksthespot,5,Wed Jun 17 07:23:09 2015 UTC,"In case you were wondering, the hydrogenated coconut oil is most likely for texture and temperature stability. The hydrogenation process turns unsaturated fats (liquid at room temp) to saturated fats (solid at room temp) by adding hydrogens back into the fatty acid. This makes them more stabil. This is how crisco is made from vegetable oil.  Source: Currently studying Food Science in college."

It's not until you start looking at ones with internal compressors that they start to get expensive.  It's probably not justifiable on cost, because you're still buying ingredients. Milk, cream, and eggs end up being of comparable expense to premium ice cream. But you can play around with flavours, and if you view it as a hobby, it's pretty cheap."

ExpectationVsReality,39zj19,silentsecrets,6,Tue Jun 16 11:57:49 2015 UTC,"American cheese:       American cheese is a type of processed cheese. It can be orange, yellow, or white in color, is mild, salty, and faintly sweet in flavor, has a medium-firm consistency, and has a very low melting point.  Very early in its history, American cheese was only white in color—as it was made from a blend of cheeses (most often including Cheddar) which were originally only white. However, the later versions are often a yellow hue due to the addition of annatto, a sweet and nutty seasoning added to Cheddar and to Colby so that by the late 1800s American cheese was often simply called ""yellow cheese.""  Today’s American cheese is, by law, required to be manufactured from at least 2 types of cheese. Because its manufacturing process differs from ""unprocessed""/raw/natural cheeses,  American cheese can not be legally sold under the name (authentic) ""cheese"" in the US. Instead, federal (and even some state) laws mandate that it be labeled as ""processed cheese"" if simply made from combining more than one cheese,  or ""cheese food"" if dairy ingredients such as cream, milk, skim milk, buttermilk, cheese whey, or albumin from cheese whey are added.  As a result, sometimes even the word ""cheese"" is absent, altogether, from the product's labeling in favor of, e.g., ""American slices"" or ""American singles"". In the United Kingdom, packs of individually wrapped slices are labeled as ""singles"",  although they are commonly referred to as ""cheese slices"".

It meant calling in sick to band practice (and was the only time I had ever skipped even part of school). At 5am the local paper came and took photos of the crowd and interviewed people. I rocked up to school late that Monday morning and apologized to the music teacher saying I had a doctor's appointment.  You know where this is going.   Next day, front page of the newspaper, 2/3 of the page is a picture of me smiling, and playing guitar with my legs in a sleeping bag. Across the bottom in giant letters it says ""speaking-of-segues lines up for U2 tickets"".  Like the opposite of Ferris Bueller. I got busted so bad which was pretty traumatic for good guy me back then. In hindsight I imagine, the teachers were laughing about it especially given how clean cut I was (that all changed once I hit college)"

When there's a language barrier, it's understandably difficult, but a lot of times we realized that the cashier at Taco Bell was so low-functioning intellectually it was literally not possible to make him understand what was wanted, much less expect him to key it in to the register or explain it to the line cook in a way that would result in the desired taco.

ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,headzoo,3,Fri Jun 12 23:16:17 2015 UTC,Some of these people are smarter than the way they're acting.   Stupid is as stupid does.
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,sterling_mallory,9,Sat Jun 13 23:10:28 2015 UTC,Then they created and spammed about 30 new subreddits and got them auto-banned.
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,Hydrox6,-4,Fri Jun 12 20:57:57 2015 UTC,So it's ok to have hateful content about others but when it becomes relevant to you it's suddenly not ok?  How does that even approximate a cogent position?
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,Lawls91,9,Fri Jun 12 21:13:40 2015 UTC,sigh...it's not about the content
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,erktheerk,8,Fri Jun 12 21:16:02 2015 UTC,"How about pretending you live in the real world and use a little common sense. You can walk around town and call everyone you see a fatty to their face, but if you call your boss a fatty to his/her face, you should full well expect to get fired. Common sense dictates that some lines you shouldn't cross do exist, and if you choose to cross those lines then don't get butthurt when it blows up in your face. Going after reddit's sister site was crossing a line, and it wasn't a smart idea."
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,headzoo,7,Fri Jun 12 23:12:06 2015 UTC,I mean wasn't imgur originally created by a Reddit user for Reddit?
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,DarkZyth,5,Fri Jun 12 20:34:11 2015 UTC,"Yup.   Originally designed as a gift to the online community of Reddit,[9] it took off almost instantly, jumping from a thousand hits per day to a million total page views in the first five months"
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,erktheerk,6,Fri Jun 12 21:18:19 2015 UTC,So Reddit users bashing the staff of a Reddit user created website. That's just counterproductive lol. Wonder if they saw it coming (the users of that subreddit I mean)?
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,DarkZyth,3,Fri Jun 12 21:29:00 2015 UTC,"I would just like to point out, it's not a ""Reddit created website"" which implies that Reddit has some level of control over it/its creation. It's a website that was created by a Reddit user with Reddit in mind as an audience."
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,little_gnora,3,Tue Jun 16 01:28:26 2015 UTC,"Sorry I meant to put ""Reddit user created"". Or something to that effect haha."

ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,shodanx,20,Sun Jun 14 18:52:37 2015 UTC,"They didn't get banned for having offensive content.  People have made several posts listing subs with far more offensive content, pointing out that they haven't been banned even though their content is far worse.  And that is true.  But those subs have the sense to keep their content contained in their sub.  The minute  one of the dead people subs start following people they don't like and harassing them outside of that sub and encouraging that behavior among themselves, you can be sure that sub will also be banned."
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,angelcat00,111,Fri Jun 12 19:36:46 2015 UTC,"And they don't. But if you start harassing people - yeah, they're going to crack down on your shitty shenanigans."
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,Mushroomer,14,Fri Jun 12 18:22:23 2015 UTC,"They mods don't condone it. Every meta sub brigades in some way because it's impossible to stop. So far as long as the mods have a rule against voting on linked subs, they get to stick around."
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,bigDean636,22,Fri Jun 12 20:30:49 2015 UTC,"Oh it gets much, much worse than that. They took a photo of an overweight autistic girl from /r/sewing, made it their sidebar image and bullied her. She then posted on /r/suicidewatch and they brigaded the thread and encouraged her to kill herself."
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,bigDean636,2,Fri Jun 12 20:41:19 2015 UTC,"I remember that happening, but I recall no mention of her being autistic. She seemed normal and balanced when I interacted with her."
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,evange,11,Fri Jun 12 20:42:43 2015 UTC,"Dude, I do not understand why r/shitredditsays keeps coming up.  Drop the war against srs.  I'd never even heard of them until this blow up whereas FPH bigotry has been leaking everywhere into other subreddits for months. I went to their site and it is extremely mild compared to the subs that were banned.    They are merely pointing at retarded comments around reddit, not personally ridiculing and harassing people's posted pictures of themselves."
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,didnotwanttoregister,-4,Fri Jun 12 20:51:01 2015 UTC,"But if you start harassing people - yeah, they're going to crack down on your shitty shenanigans.   You mean like SRS does?"
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,PM_ME_UR_GENETICS,-67,Mon Jun 15 15:44:49 2015 UTC,"If that was their reason, then why ban the other 60+ subs? Were they harassing people too or just distasteful?"
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,Mushroomer,64,Fri Jun 12 20:47:29 2015 UTC,"Because the vast majority were reactionary subs popping up to either try and dodge the ban, or brigade the front page with FPH content.  The initial ban was only three subs - FPH, and two other subs that had been embroiled in harassment scandals."
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,owa00,11,Wed Jul 1 15:16:34 2015 UTC,"Also, I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of those subs shared the same toxic users."
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,Mushroomer,7,Fri Jun 12 18:30:39 2015 UTC,"What content on that subreddit is in violation of the rules, exactly? Unlike the other fatpeoplehate# subreddits, it clearly wasn't created as a community to subvert a community ban. None of the content is in violation of Reddit's ToS. It's a passive aggressive joke.  Get over it."
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,Mushroomer,2,Fri Jun 12 18:35:37 2015 UTC,"The other subreddits were banned because they were essentially the exact same subreddit as FPH. There's really no point in moderation if the community just renames their subreddit, and goes back to doing what they were banned for in the first place. The technical term is 'ban subversion'.  FPH6 is an outlier, because it wasn't created as a save haven for ex-FPH users. Rather, it was made as a joke by a user with a lesser opinion of the FPH controversy. Instead of posting offensive speech and mockery about the obese, it's a subreddit for desert recipes. A dumb joke sub that hasn't even been posted in for 20 days, since it was really only a joke that made sense for 10 hours.  Additionally, you say the subreddit was 'owned by SRS'. I didn't do a ton of research, but I can confirm the subreddit's creator /u/newsagg , never even submitted a link to SRS."
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,gymnasticRug,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:10:29 2015 UTC,Dessert*  im so sorry for this

ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,arrow74,-25,Wed Jul 1 06:35:56 2015 UTC,Yet those subs had broken no rules even still. Even though you say brigading they didn't even do that much.
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,erktheerk,19,Wed Jul 1 06:45:14 2015 UTC,"You don't know that. I visited many of those subs shortly after they were made by using the output from a script that scans for new subreddits. In many of the ones I visited there we threads campaigning for material to be posted and then vote brigaded to the front page. Some power users claimed to have 20 or more people at their disposal and were combining their efforts with larger groups.   Also the ONLY people who can tell if vote manipulation and brigading are occurring is the admins. They have the IP addresses of everyone and can monitor where they are active anywhere on reddit even without interacting with a sub. If you use VPN, unless you use a different one for every account and never sign in unless you're on that IP, the IP address of that VPN will be attached to your account and is visible to the admins. They can also discover your alt accounts when you switch to them on the same IP and all of the account information is linked back to the same user."
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,arrow74,-7,Wed Jul 1 07:01:42 2015 UTC,"I doubt all the subs they banned were, and I'll stand by that. Also by the merit of your own comment you don't know if they were brigading either."
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,erktheerk,8,Thu Jul 2 23:24:51 2015 UTC,....sigh   You just want to believe.   Go through that list. Fathate subs are there that are not banned. By your logic they aren't deleting everything related to fat hate.  Have a good life. I'm done talking to stupid.
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,arrow74,-10,Wed Jul 1 07:21:49 2015 UTC,Different opinion = stupid  Solid logic.

ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,arrow74,-4,Fri Jun 12 19:39:26 2015 UTC,"I did read your comment, and I'll accept some of the protest subs may have been involved in brigading, but once again from what I saw not all of them were. I can accept some of your information, but just because I'm not agreeing with everything you say that doesn't make me a, to quote you, stupid ignorant person.   Also just because I don't agree doesn't mean I haven't done some reading. So please I ask that when arguing you try and approach people in a fair way. Don't lash out and make assumptions, or all out insult people."
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,Mushroomer,-61,Fri Jun 12 21:45:46 2015 UTC,"So you agree they were banned for their content, not harassment."
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,3rd_Shift_Tech_Man,31,Fri Jun 12 21:48:17 2015 UTC,"They were banned because they were an extension of the sub that was banned for harassment. If a sub is banned, and six more pop up that are literally just extensions of that sub to subvert the ban... Yeah, you're going to eliminate those. You don't gain diplomatic immunity just because you slapped a number on the end of your name."
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,Mushroomer,-50,Fri Jun 12 21:49:10 2015 UTC,"You're saying it's a bannable offense to make a ""fat hatred"" sub, which is the same thing as banning distasteful subs."

ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,Zetaeta2,15,Fri Jun 12 22:03:13 2015 UTC,"You're saying Reddit should permit a sub that is literally the exact same thing as the sub that was banned, because the name is one letter different."
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,POW_HAHA,-22,Fri Jun 12 18:42:19 2015 UTC,"I'm saying they should be honest and say ""all fat shaming posts and subreddits are banned"", because apparently that's their goal. If this is really about harassment, they'd ban the people offending, not ""fat hate"" in all forms."
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,angelcat00,22,Fri Jun 12 18:53:01 2015 UTC,Are you even reading the responses to you or just waiting for the next time you can talk?
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,Cpr196,-12,Fri Jun 12 19:01:03 2015 UTC,"I didn't respond to you because you have no proof to back up your claims of vote manipulation. Where's your ""output from a script that scans for new subreddits""?"
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,erktheerk,8,Fri Jun 12 19:03:51 2015 UTC,Fatlogic and fps are still there. They only banned fph and its successors.
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,rcm034,7,Fri Jun 12 19:56:02 2015 UTC,If they're banning all fat shaming content then how come /r/fatpeoplestories and /r/fatlogic are still up?
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,TotesMessenger,11,Fri Jun 12 19:33:56 2015 UTC,"People get their alt accounts banned all the time for trying to dodge a ban by making a new account.  This is the same thing.  The new subs were banned for trying to get around the initial ban, which is against the rules."
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,jfb1337,3,Fri Jun 12 19:38:41 2015 UTC,"What if they were? What does it matter? It was a sub leaking out into the whole of Reddit and giving off the image of a website that hated fat people, so why is Reddit gonna not ban that? You earlier said they didn't ban X amount of shit racist subs, or whatever, but they technically did ban some, they banned one racist sub, a homophobic sub, another fat hate sub, I have a feeling it isn't just random, I feel like perhaps they too were harrassing people."
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,Khalexus,-15,Fri Jun 12 20:14:06 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think that's exactly why they were banned. I think they're using harassment as a cover because they don't want to say ""we don't allow fat shaming content on Reddit anymore""."
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,erktheerk,10,Fri Jun 12 20:49:19 2015 UTC,You have no idea how reddit works. Just because you can not see evidence of something doesn't mean the admins do not have the tools to follow users around and determine if they are breaking the rules. There are hundreds of thousands of subs with millions of users. They have tools to track and ID those who are causing problems.   https://www.reddit.com/r/ExpectationVsReality/comments/39m2dg/it_was_nice_while_it_lasted/cs4kbb2
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,Khalexus,12,Fri Jun 12 19:44:12 2015 UTC,"Ban evasion is a thing and realistically should be enforced (otherwise you couldn't ban anything). Stuff has been missed in the past, but doesn't make it any less valid.  HOWEVER, that doesn't apply at all to several of the banned subs."

ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,Khalexus,59,Fri Jun 12 19:27:25 2015 UTC,"They didn't ban it because it's distasteful, they banned it because of harassment.   And before you say ""But the new fph subs didn't have time to harass anyone"" - no, but ban evasion is a separate rule which they break."
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,erktheerk,-65,Fri Jun 12 19:15:04 2015 UTC,"How is it ban evasion if all 19 moderators of FPH were shadowbanned? Is it now against the rules to make ""fat shaming"" subs?"
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,ExdigguserPies,37,Fri Jun 12 19:19:59 2015 UTC,Because they broke Reddit's ToS by not taking reasonable steps to stop the harassment their sub was participating in.
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,abuttfarting,24,Fri Jun 12 19:47:17 2015 UTC,Because they broke Reddit's ToS by not taking reasonable steps to stop actively participating in the harassment their sub was participating in.
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,Chilis1,11,Fri Jun 12 18:59:03 2015 UTC,"I was going to include that but I have tried to take a step back from this whole thing, as such I'm not 100% on the facts and didn't want to risk making baseless allegations. But if the mods did actively participate in the harassment, then yeah, that's completely messed up and it's no surprise they're banned."
ExpectationVsReality,39m2dg,sterling_mallory,11,Wed Jul 1 06:05:19 2015 UTC,Yeah they were posting pictures of the imgur admins in the sidebar and participating in the threads where members were organizing the harassment. Allowing email addresses and other personal information to remain up and generally being supportive of the whole thing.   Example screenshot

Incidentally, I had surgery to construct a new bowel, so a lot - A LOT - of foods are off the menu to begin with, yet surprisingly the hospital didn't really have a menu or alternative to help. The best I could go for was the 'mush everything up to shit' option, but as they often included healthy veg in each meal - something I'm recommended not to have much of yet - that was a bit hardwork.  Looking down the menu for my first meal since surgery and seeing the following was sad, as I could eat none of it:  1) The hottest fucking chicken curry in existence (okay, maybe just a chicken curry option) 2) Jacket potato and beans 3) Cheese and onion pie 4) Mushroom soup  I can, however, have crisps (potato chips).

My wife has been in the hospital quite a bit since we got married and breakfast is always fairly scant if you just get something off the delivery cart. Granted, yours has bad presentation, but my wife usually got an egg, toast, some form of cereal, milk, juice, and coffee; not much different from yours. Occasionally they would have pancakes instead of eggs and toast, or bacon instead of toast. But if you wanted anything substantial, you had to head down to the cafeteria and buy it yourself."

My mom was devastated but she freaking loved the hospital's cafeteria. They served my brother really good food. She'd sneak her food to his bedroom so he she could be with him longer, and cry whilst eating the delicious food.   When he got better, they transferred him to another hospital, and the food completely changed. I think when you're in the hospital my brother was at, it's usually really serious shit and they want to make sure at least the food is top notch so it's at least one happy thing."
ExpectationVsReality,39c9qj,Opium_Poppy,7,Wed Jun 10 20:16:49 2015 UTC,Getting better but still rough lol. Hope you get out soon!
ExpectationVsReality,39c9qj,ozarkhome,7,Wed Jun 10 21:07:13 2015 UTC,"Hospitals, at least, are pretty good about accommodating food allergies.  Bad form to kill the patients who are otherwise stable.  I've never been in a hospital that didn't offer a menu for hospital food.  I've been in hospitals in three different states, but it was always for childbirth.  The worst time I had was when I was inexplicably on a clear fluids diet for 24 hours after a c-section.  There was nearly nothing I could eat--the lunch and dinner choices were cream of chicken or cream of mushroom soups.  And Jell-O.  The only choice available to me for breakfast was Cream of Wheat.  So I was randomly on about a 600-calorie diet for a day."
ExpectationVsReality,39c9qj,CrystalKU,5,Wed Jun 10 20:39:02 2015 UTC,A clear liquid diet immediately after abdominal surgery is super common.  I think they are hesitant to have too much go through the gut while it's initially recovering from the intrusion and anesthesia.
ExpectationVsReality,39c9qj,missprecocious,2,Wed Jun 10 20:56:14 2015 UTC,"I've had three c-sections, though, and only clear liquids after one.  It doesn't seem to be super common with this type of abdominal surgery.  Only like two other women I've spoken to dealt with it.    Of course, different hospitals have wildly different standards of care for childbirth in general.  Like, the Navy hospital I delivered my first two at kept a fridge in the hall with snacks and drinks that you could go for any time, but that seems to be pretty rare too.  All of the civilian hospitals I delivered at, if you got hungry in between meals you were out of luck unless you had family there to bring you something."
ExpectationVsReality,39c9qj,shrekman123,3,Wed Jun 10 21:55:15 2015 UTC,"When I had my son at a regular hospital, there was a little lounge in the maternity ward with a kitchenette, including vending machines, two fridges (one was specifically for storing pumped breastmilk) and a bunch of random foods. I never actually went in there, but my fiance did (because the food I got from the cafeteria was HORRID) and he said it was really nice. Maybe I was at one of those rare hospitals. Either way, it was a nice thing to have!"
ExpectationVsReality,39c9qj,shaleesmo,2,Wed Jun 10 22:17:23 2015 UTC,"Hm.  Weird.  In my area it's de rigueur to do a clear liquids diet after c-sections.  But you're right, it probably varies according to where you are at.  :)"
ExpectationVsReality,39c9qj,triksterx,2,Wed Jun 10 22:28:29 2015 UTC,"I have worked at a prison and currently work at a hospital.  Hospitals taking food allergies very seriously, they would be diligant in getting you the correct foods - that said, I saw a patient on a low sodium diet that was served chicken fried steak with gravy and french fries - I cringed at every bite she took and was pissed enough to report it.   Prison -- not as accommodating - they will not serve you your allergens but you won't have much to supplement it with. For example, a dialysis patient I had once had a very strict diet, she got boiled cabbage for almost every meal, that was all they had that they could give her. I always felt bad for colitis patients as well, I always hoped they felt much better on the outside when they could get more accommodating foods. As a medical provider, we had protocols for a lot of things, often part of the protocol was to educate on the importance of diet and fresh fruits and vegetables. I refused to say this to the inmates that had no control over what they could eat (other than the processed foods from commissary). There was a vegetable garden but only a handful of inmates had the privileges to eat it."

An occasional bad batch is sort of to be expected when you've got bags of meat hanging on shelves so I can't get too mad when I get a pack that tastes like shoe leather.

ExpectationVsReality,38tc3p,bigchorizo,76,Sat Jun 6 17:17:25 2015 UTC,What's the expectation?  That it would be clown shaped?  I've seen these for years and they have never been clown shaped.
ExpectationVsReality,38tc3p,conspiracy_thug,28,Sat Jun 6 21:10:51 2015 UTC,Lol 'clown shaped'
ExpectationVsReality,38tc3p,izzohead,12,Sat Jun 6 21:18:39 2015 UTC,I don't care to consort with the juggalo types
ExpectationVsReality,38tc3p,conspiracy_thug,8,Sun Jun 7 02:22:26 2015 UTC,It would be insane to expect it to look like the wrapper.
ExpectationVsReality,38tc3p,cjgroveus,9,Sun Jun 7 01:51:26 2015 UTC,Not everyone is used to the candy. If you are used to every product and know how it will turn out then we wouldn't have this subreddit. As a new customer you don't have a lot to go off. He probably believed it would be clown shaped and maybe slightly bigger.
ExpectationVsReality,38tc3p,Cock-a-la-mode,17,Sat Jun 6 21:20:37 2015 UTC,It doesn't give an example of what the product is supposed to look like. The packaging just has a drawing of a clown.
ExpectationVsReality,38tc3p,JonnyRichter,3,Sun Jun 7 01:29:50 2015 UTC,"That may be, but considering this candy is wrapped in a soft wrapper, I find it hard to believe anyone older than 5 would be surprised that it is not clown shaped or gigantic. You could make the argument that there could be an expectation it would simply look better. Again, that argument breaks down when you realize the only thing that wrapper is hiding from someone with at least a little critical thinking ability is what color the goody is."

Also beach sex at night around 10-2am is very safe, hampton beach is a great place to do it in new Hampshire at night in the summers, cops dont bother you and there's about 4-5 other couples spread out doing it.   role play: it can always be awkward my experience, have the guy walk into the room in character.

ExpectationVsReality,37izm5,ooo_shiny,23,Thu May 28 15:59:59 2015 UTC,Biggest problem is the shitty shredded lettuce they use now instead of proper decent sized leaves so any heat makes it instantly shrivel. The way they do sauce now is also ridiculous and results in it being all in one tiny spot (or more commonly outside of the burger). Looks like you ordered it with no pickles as well.
ExpectationVsReality,37izm5,Suprman37,26,Thu May 28 04:20:21 2015 UTC,"McDonald's has used shredded lettuce since the 80s at least.

ExpectationVsReality,37izm5,satansnewbaby,2,Thu May 28 21:53:25 2015 UTC,We here in NZ use two kind of leaves- shredded and salad.

ExpectationVsReality,37hfbw,wheres_caty,12,Thu May 28 05:36:04 2015 UTC,Amy's stuff make not look great but it tastes better than most microwavable mush.
ExpectationVsReality,37hfbw,mynameismud_butt,15,Sat Jun 20 17:28:04 2015 UTC,That is exactly what I expected.  You just need to stir your dahl and curry and it'll look fine. It's not Amy's fault if you don't follow directions.
ExpectationVsReality,37hfbw,scrotoe,6,Wed May 27 21:37:55 2015 UTC,So I figure you'd know about this:  Why does indian food always have whole spices instead of ground spices? It's annoying as hell to try to eat something only to bite down on a whole kernel and have flavor invade my mouth

ExpectationVsReality,37hfbw,Autumn-Moon,11,Thu May 28 01:34:32 2015 UTC,"I'm Indian, I don't know for sure but I suspect it's because 1) that way you don't end up eating the spice itself but rather food flavored aromatically by it, and 2) once you grind spices they lose a ton of their freshness and flavor.  I feel you though, I flippin HATE when I accidentally bite into a whole clove in my chicken curry. I suffer for the deliciousness. :("

Even some proper homemade curry won't look pretty in such conditions.   Side note: there's no noticeable difference between curry in Indian restaurants in England and in the USA. I've had plenty in both countries. Chinese food, on the other hand, tastes very different in both countries as opposed to how it's made in China. In fact, General Tso's was created in America.

ExpectationVsReality,371m5g,po_ta_to,109,Sun May 24 20:03:44 2015 UTC,"I seriously spent weeks planning for this cake. I watched 100+ videos about cake decorating, and bought really good supplies. I have a bunch of nice Wilton tips, but I had such trouble with them, because I didn't have actual piping bags (a friend assured me that Ziplock bags work just as well). The tips just kept bursting out. Since I couldn't manage making the flowers with the icing tips, I had a brilliant plan: Create an extremely dry mixture of icing with mostly sugar until I had a mixture that could be shaped like Play-Doh. They held shaped, but look exactly like what they were and tasted exactly like what they were.  The top border was meant to be an elegant shell shape. Instead, it looks like shoddily arranged turds. And I ran out of icing for the top border, so I had the brilliant idea to add two little purple turds to finish it off. Beautiful.  And yes, the cake is sitting on an old microwave plate.  This was for my mom's birthday. I'm so sorry, Mom."
ExpectationVsReality,371m5g,whofartedomg,64,Sun May 24 00:46:04 2015 UTC,"Buy some piping bags with screw on tips and keep trying! Proper tools are essential to getting a professional finish. I also suggest a rotating cake stand for frosting,  and a decent flat cake tray. You can even buy disposables so you can leave them at parties without worry. It only gets easier with practice. Don't give up!"
ExpectationVsReality,371m5g,Colorfag,16,Sun May 24 01:24:01 2015 UTC,I have a screw on adapter thing that will connect the tips to any bag. I have never had any trouble using Ziplocs.

ExpectationVsReality,371m5g,chelsey-dagger,17,Sun May 24 03:06:29 2015 UTC,"Oh god, the Ziploc bag trick is not good for real decorating (as you discovered).  Proper cone-shaped icing bags help you force the icing evenly into the tip.  (Another common error with ziplocs is squeezing the icing in the middle of the bag instead of using consistent pressure at the top of the mass of icing in the cone bags.)    I will say that I loathe cleaning reusable decorating bags (forever greasy).  The disposable ones (they have reinforced seams) are so so so worth it."
ExpectationVsReality,371m5g,coldhore,16,Sun May 24 06:30:03 2015 UTC,"You know what, if one of my kids made this, I would much prefer the one on the right over a prepared store bought version.

ExpectationVsReality,371m5g,notsomuchreally,2,Sun May 24 05:34:31 2015 UTC,I have two decorating guns I got from two different garage sales for a couple of bucks. I don't think they are they expensive new either; I love them. I definitely haven't tried anything fancy like this but the amount of control I get while piping is awesome. One has a trigger that kind of pumps a shot of frosting with each pull of the trigger and one that I push the end in while piping. I like the latter one better

ExpectationVsReality,36yq6g,gypsywhisperer,23,Sun May 24 01:14:03 2015 UTC,"I live in the ghetto in my town. There's a dollar store of some type every half mile and none have steaks or any real meat or produce. They do have grocery sections that are full of pantry goods that are name brands. They also have milk, butter, cheese, juice and a couple of freezer cases of ice cream, pizza etc. All name brand stuff and comparable to grocery store prices. The problem in the ghetto is that no grocery store wants to deal with high theft, and food stamps. So all of the grocery stores are very far away. People sadly have to get most of their groceries from dollar stores. With that said I could see a dollar store carrying these so people think they can do all their grocery shopping at a dollar store."
ExpectationVsReality,36yq6g,DrStephenFalken,5,Sat May 23 17:34:39 2015 UTC,The grocery stores near me are more expensive in order to make up more for the theft. I will go to the grocery stores by my boyfriend's place instead because it's cheaper.

A chicken in the ghetto was $7 but at the upper middle class Krogers it would be $5. Steak was $7.99 for sirloin in the ghetto but was $5.99 in the better part of town. Everything was cheaper in the krogers that was in the expensive area to live because they didn't have to worry about much theft."

Honestly I don't mind the process at all, it's just an enzyme that is present in meat anyway, used to make scraps more appetizing. Good solution to avoid wasting food. One just shouldn't use it to try and sell lower quality products as higher quality products."
ExpectationVsReality,36yq6g,DrStephenFalken,4,Sat May 23 10:29:17 2015 UTC,"As they said in the video, the problem is whether or not they're letting consumers know about it, which is important because if someone doesn't thoroughly cook these pieces through the risk of food poisoning is much higher than with unprocessed pieces.   The reasoning behind that is because most harmful bacteria is found on the surface of meats where the cooking process will kill the bacteria off. That's why you can eat a blue steak and be perfectly fine, but you can't do the same with say hamburger meat. It's not the meat itself that's the problem, it's the preparation of the meat. Tartare is fine because it's prepared right before serving.   I do also wonder about possible long term effects from regular exposure to the enzyme. It's important to remember that just because something is 'natural' that it doesn't mean it's perfectly safe. Pure capsaicin is pretty dangerous even in very small quantities, so much so that they've begun to ban the sale of it in some places. Or even carrots. While it's pretty hard to achieve carotenemia from just eating carrots, juicing them (which isn't even that much of a refining process scientifically) and then consuming large quantities of that on a regular basis can result in poisoning. If you were to refine carrots and then consume that result on a regular basis, you could get carotenemia much more easily.   I'm not saying that consumption of this enzyme and these examples of meat is dangerous or anything, I'm just saying it's food for thought.   I really hate videos (like this one) where they maintain a specific atmosphere that isn't appropriate or even necessary in relation to the material being presented. It triggers some weird responses in people, such as becoming too critical of the material. It's kind of like with infants where your tone of voice is everything to them. If you scream a lullaby at them they will dislike it, if you read them a diary from a serial killer in a gentle voice they will smile and be generally happy. It's a bit similar to that. On the other hand, it also causes people to become defensive because they recognize that it's inappropriate, unfair or unjust, so they end up accepting it sort of as a form of stubbornness, which is equally undesirable to having people dislike something just because of the tone of the material being presented.   Question and be critical of everything and try not to let artificial atmosphere persuade your thoughts."
ExpectationVsReality,36yq6g,audiophilistine,4,Sat May 23 07:05:27 2015 UTC,"Depending on where you buy them. Often they're nothing more than sirloin trimmings hand cut and ""shaped"" (rolled by hand) into what is called ""faux fillets"" (as in fake beef tenderloin fillet) in the restaurant and food business. There's nothing wrong with them and often they're not ""glued"" together if they're from your local grocery stores butcher area.   If they're from a brand not affiliated with your grocery store and in a vacuum sealed package they're more than likely either real high quality or meat glue. Just have to read the label carefully.   If you buy the ""faux fillets"" from your grocery butcher meat section and you can't take one apart or pull one apart then it's glued together and your local butcher at that grocery store is an asshole, start shopping some where else. If you can pull one apart, the beef should take the shape of Pac-Man with an open mouth or be a strip of beef rolled into a circle. If it does pull apart into one of those shapes then it's real beef free from glue.   If the glue free ones weren't shaped into faux fillets they would be sold as sirloin tips. So it's not waste being used to make more food. It's a legit, delicious part of the cow free of meat glue.   If it's glued together it's a slightly nefarious way your grocery store wanted to make money on what would have been ground beef."

ExpectationVsReality,36yq6g,jeffykins,3,Sat May 23 15:12:01 2015 UTC,Your first mistake was buying meat at a dollar store.
ExpectationVsReality,36yq6g,endymion2300,3,Thu May 28 16:03:56 2015 UTC,This makes me feel sad and empty inside
ExpectationVsReality,36yq6g,ASACschrader,9,Sat May 23 23:32:31 2015 UTC,the only reason i'd buy dollar store steaks would be for sandwiches.   you could make a tight beef dip with that shit. or something that kinda sorta resembles a cheesesteak but still tastes pretty good because you can't go wrong with beef and cheese.   could also make an omelet.
ExpectationVsReality,36yq6g,DrStephenFalken,3,Sat May 23 13:29:42 2015 UTC,spend three bucks on ground beef...
ExpectationVsReality,36yq6g,endymion2300,3,Sat May 23 23:35:31 2015 UTC,Or you could go to your grocery store and find a $3 box of steak ums and do the same. Or even a $3 or $4 steak and do the same.
ExpectationVsReality,36yq6g,CrymsonRayne,2,Mon May 25 14:31:25 2015 UTC,"steak-ums are like five bucks here. i don't like the flavor anyway, and they're way greasier than they need to be.   and, to be fair, i didn't exactly say i buy dollar store steaks. i said that if i bought them, it would be for [blank]. i was just offering suggestions based of what i do with steak when i buy it."
ExpectationVsReality,36yq6g,CrymsonRayne,5,Sat May 23 07:04:01 2015 UTC,I actually got about nine of these the other day for stir fry. A good marinade later and they were as tender as could be.
ExpectationVsReality,36yq6g,pants_are_the_worst,19,Sun May 24 01:46:23 2015 UTC,I love using ribeye for stir fry. But I don't think I would ever have the courage to buy this.
ExpectationVsReality,36yq6g,DrStephenFalken,4,Sun May 24 03:57:05 2015 UTC,It's just end cuts is all. I flattened it like carpaccio and stir fried it.
ExpectationVsReality,36yq6g,CrymsonRayne,18,Sun May 24 07:49:38 2015 UTC,"I feel like for 9$ you could buy a decent small steak, thinly slice it, and end up with higher quality and higher volume of steak."
ExpectationVsReality,36yq6g,DrStephenFalken,2,Sat May 23 07:30:18 2015 UTC,"At my local grocery I can get a big 3 lb package of stir fry meat and marinade it and it's tender and delicious. Or I could even buy 3 ""house sirloins"" and have tender delicious stir fry without concern for food safety or mishandling for the same price."
ExpectationVsReality,36yq6g,ASACschrader,3,Sat May 23 09:45:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was more going for decent quality, and more quality. Big stir fry. Still turned out tender. I'd do it again."
ExpectationVsReality,36yq6g,CrymsonRayne,2,Sat May 23 17:20:00 2015 UTC,But you paid  $1 dollar for I assume at best a 2-3 ounces of beef per package. That's like $6-$8 a pound for piss poor quality beef. You can get good steak for that price and get just as much. Or you could tell your grocery store you need beef for stir fry and you're going to marinade it. You'll end up with 3 lbs of good beef trimmings for stir fry for the same price and you won't have to worry about food safety.

ExpectationVsReality,36yq6g,CrymsonRayne,1 point,Sun May 24 01:44:57 2015 UTC,I'm sure some of that 3.5 ounces is saline added to up the beef weight in those packages.  It's really about the quality and less about the price.   Ribeye near me is on sale right now for $6.99 lb. I also know it's whole steak and comes from a trusty worth source. It's also been handled in the right manner. I'm not over paying for trimmings injected with saline solution to be palatable.

Why does Hugh Jackman continue to work for a company on a multi-trillion dollar war project that nobody has interest in?

If you want to piss your money and free time away with a shitty movie that resembles the director's previous two movies, but suffers from being a derivative mess (Robocop meets Short Circuit but without any of the heart)... Watch Chappie.  Honestly, I didn't know who Die Antwoord was before this, and they just pissed me off. The fact that the movie attempted to make them a pair of sympathetic characters in the second half was laughable, because they all suck."

I did my 40% best on that work :P Here:   Those measurements do generally correspond to some standard alcohol serving sizes, but the placement of the lines isn't intended as any kind of serving guide: a shot of liquor is generally 1.5 ounces rather than 1 ounce, not many people drink wine out of Solo cups, and beer is usually poured into a Solo cup until the cup is full rather than being carefully measured out at 12 ounces.  Read more at http://www.snopes.com/food/prepare/solocups.asp#QarBWFQvjEWyAjOy.99   The lines are purely coincidental and the ""expected"" measurements are something some drunk dude probably thought of before the rumor spread. The parent company even said:   The lines on our Party Cups are designed for functional performance and are not measurement lines. If the lines do coincide with certain measurements, it is purely coincidental."

It's the use of controller. It's the history of console gaming.   There's no doubt that PC gaming is technically superior, any person with an objective mind can see that, but its not practically superior.  PC gaming doesn't allow for many people to sit together in a room and play on one screen. The keyboard is such an odd way to play a game. It's clumsy and difficult to get used to. Most of the time, I just want to lay in bed, relax, and play a game. With PC, unless I have a laptop, I had to be hunched over a desk sitting upright."

ExpectationVsReality,366dcd,Redeemed-Assassin,-6,Sun May 17 02:56:02 2015 UTC,"History of console gaming? Consoles have made some great games, but every major genera was birthed on PC first and eventually migrated to consoles. RPG's, FPS's, RTS's (not that consoles get many of those), Racing and Flying sims, the list goes on. Consoles have some amazing brands they have made that have brought revolutionary ideas, but their core concepts were still developed on PC.  You can hook up controllers to a PC, so you don't get to make the claim that PC's don't have controllers. Hell, the XBone controller hooks right up with the charging cable and microsoft has drivers for it you can download.   Also, I don't know about you, but I find gaming with a keyboard and mouse to be much more comfortable than a controller for most games (FPS, RTS, RPG). I find I have much more control precision with both my movement and my aim using mouse + kb. That's not to say that controllers are useless since I do think controllers are better for racing and fighting games (Forza and Mortal Kombat come to mind as examples).  Also, slouching at your desk is possible if you set it up right. You can also look into a wireless kb / mouse or extension cords and a small desk and have your monitor output go to your tv, sound output to your sound system, and relax in a chair and play there. Or wait for the Steam Link that's gonna let you hook up your PC to your TV and use a controller.  Not trying to be an argumentative dick, just giving the counter points to your points.

By making them small in the photo they've created the illusion of the pizza being bigger.  Then they delivered by giving you tiny sausages that are probably rejects from a company that makes Italian wedding soup.

Common debuted in 1992 with the album Can I Borrow a Dollar? and maintained a significant underground following into the late 1990s, after which he gained notable mainstream success through his work with the Soulquarians.

The owner was not helpful and kept trying to get me to buy a spray for the coffin or a stand of flowers.  I was not looking to spend $150 on flowers and she wouldn't let up.  She then said that I needed to hurry and make up my mind because it ""wasn't a good time of year for a funeral"" because he died so close to Mother's Day.  All right then.  I left and ordered lovely flowers online.  At least that way, I got something in my price range and didn't have to hear someone tell me that it was inconvenient when someone dies before a holiday."
