It also meant that in the two and a half years I was waiting for a tribunal I wasn't given any employment support (I wanted to be on the Work Programme side of ESA, despite the lower payout, because I really need to be productive to feel like a worthwhile human being) despite requesting it.  Since my tribunal, which got me back pay and access to more psychotherapy, and starting on the Work Programme, I've massively improved and started my own business.

Can you imagine a situation - maybe not in London - but in another town, say Bristol, on a much smaller road, say, not during rush hour, and say, with hardly any traffic.

If you're at a junction in the middle of the night and you can see for miles all round - but the ""law"" says you have to stop at a red light. Fine. Except that red light is controlled by a timer, and it's purpose is to keep you safe and avoid collisions.  At 2 am, when you can clearly see there are no other vehicles - is legislation being enacted? or is it just an electronic timer.

When that ran out I had to scavenge, do stuff I shouldn't and basically expend a lot of energy making money to buy food and essentials, when I was supposed to be just studying. If I went under this system, I'd have £8k a year, that's not a lot, but it's enough to live and lets you concentrate on studying.  Realistically, we can bitch and moan about getting loans instead of free stuff all day, and yes I think the way it was handeled was incredibly unfair, and we obviously CAN afford free tuition, what we mean is that we would rather spend the money on other stuff. But if you want to go to university, not being able to actually afford to live whilst you are there is a MUCH bigger deterrent than making some small repayments when you can afford it."

BritishSuccess,3cjthm,pandapopsicles,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:10:54 2015 UTC,"Because some people can't afford to pay off the loan, even WITH the fact it only starts. That's 8k of debt per year, which could be 16k to nearly 50k if someone was doing a long degree.  50 grand of debt is not something to laugh about."
BritishSuccess,3cjthm,Projectmayhem666,2,Fri Jul 10 07:01:05 2015 UTC,"Right, but why does that change if someones parents earned 30k? Do you think they are paying off their kids loans? Because whilst I'm sure you can find some that are, most people become largely financially independent when they set off for uni, or at least when they're done and get a job.   Given that the loans repayments are set up for different levels of current earnings anyway, why would you want people whose parents earn different amounts to be in different levels of debt?"

That gave me a good grant. Furthermore, my dad gave me £1500 each term for the three years (because I was living with my mum, my dad's income wasn't considered or something).

It's basically saying that if you come from a less well-off background, then you should start life with more debt than someone who didn't. Also I had a full grant and still worked in term time, full-time over summers and did a year in industry so that I had extra money to avoid working in final year.

BritishSuccess,3ca8w6,hoffi_coffi,5,Mon Jul 6 15:57:18 2015 UTC,"Because if there are two cyclists in the middle of the road you have to go further into the other lane, and so unless you drive a range rover or something you can often overtake a cyclist on the LHS even when someone is coming the other way (only if the road is wide enough).   I cycle, a lot, like 300 miles a week minimum, and I also drive, and it is orders of magnitude easier to overtake bikes cycling on the LHS of the road than it is two cyclists in the middle of the road.

Also I don't think many cyclists take up 1m, most ride just past the drains which are typically 30 cm from the road. If you're in a small car on a wide road and there's another small car coming the other way you can easily leave enough space for you all, of course you will go into their lane a bit but it'll be fine. Obviously not on a blind corner or something, but its perfectly safe."

It was incredibly liberating actually, I could just rock up anywhere and take my time.

I am not sure I have done it since, or had a need to. No one would bat an eyelid though I am sure.

BritishSuccess,3bz0vr,Kandiru,3,Fri Jul 3 13:36:18 2015 UTC,"Actually less is used for either, while fewer can only be used for something which is countable. Source"
BritishSuccess,3bz0vr,jamesick,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:42:38 2015 UTC,this isn't really a source. this is one persons opinion on it.
BritishSuccess,3bz0vr,Kandiru,3,Fri Jul 3 19:49:11 2015 UTC,"Well, it links to the King James Bible, and Shakespeare (both of which use Less for both countables and uncountables and rarely use fewer at all.) so those are the actual sources. Not sure what greater source you would have for valid English?"
BritishSuccess,3bz0vr,Disgruntled__Goat,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:57:21 2015 UTC,"well, the Oxford dictionary has this to say   Usage  In standard English less should only be used with uncountable things ( less money, less time). With countable things it is incorrect to use less ( less people and less words); strictly speaking, correct use is fewer people and fewer words. See also few (usage).   but it does also say this   1.1Fewer in number:  [AS PRONOUN]: a population of less than 200,000 See usage below.  MORE EXAMPLE SENTENCES In most cases fast greens present less problems when drawing around a blocking bowl.  It can be shown for example that there were less that 5000 men present but this is not of any importance. Yes, but it would present less difficulties once it is acknowledged that the writ is almost as of right.   http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/less  Informally, you're probably fine using less all the time, but formally I would always try to use fewer and less correctly because it does often sound weird when using ""less"" incorrectly. Ultimately, it doesn't really matter."
BritishSuccess,3bz0vr,letmeruinthisforyou,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:24:59 2015 UTC,"Right, but they use as their example, that you can say ""A population of less than 200,000"", and give less 2 usage meanings, one for less uncountable, and one for less countable, clearly showing that they understand it is used in both meanings.  In Mathematics you normally talk about ""where x is 3 or less"" rather than fewer for example, so in some formal settings you certainly do use less over fewer."
BritishSuccess,3bz0vr,Disgruntled__Goat,-4,Sat Jul 4 08:17:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The correct answer is to use whatever you think sounds best. ""Less articles"" rolls off the tongue a bit better than ""fewer articles""."

BritishSuccess,3bmbw7,fix3r,22,Tue Jun 30 12:40:50 2015 UTC,In my opinion it should be mandatory unless you are immunocompromised. If the parents don't like it then they should have their child taken away as they clearly aren't responsible enough to look after them.
BritishSuccess,3bmbw7,MsEtheldreda,3,Tue Jun 30 13:06:26 2015 UTC,The fact is that other than a few nutjobs the medical community are unanimously agreed about the safety of 99.999% of vaccinations. Parents who ignore their advice are abusing their children's health.

BritishSuccess,3bmbw7,justhisguyouknow,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:22:13 2015 UTC,"Well yes, but the recent surge in vaccination scares came out of the UK, after Andrew Wakefield published his now discredited study. While there were vaccination scares since basically the first time we even begun to think of such a thing, the recent surge in popularity can be traced back to Wakefield."
BritishSuccess,3bmbw7,rovingtiger,2,Tue Jun 30 22:19:33 2015 UTC,"The vaccination scare for MMR didn't come out of the UK, it stayed in the UK.

BritishSuccess,3bmbw7,Yaverland,2,Wed Jul 1 11:48:35 2015 UTC,"Except that's wrong. People in America still maintain that Wakefield was right in his study, including the aforementioned Jenny McCarthy, and the MMR scare also hit Japan very badly for example. Just because other countries were worried about other issues regarding vaccines - as was the UK at the time - doesn't mean that the MMR scare was contained to the UK. In fact, the greatest evidence against Wakefield came not from the UK, but from Japan, despite the fact that you say it stayed in the UK.  In Japan they discontinued the MMR vaccine - in part due to the Wakefield study and in part due to their own issues - and yet autism rates continue to rise alongside the rest of the world; thus proving that the MMR vaccine had no link with the increasing rates of autism reported by Wakefield, and continued to be reported by others."

Thinking a bit harder I can remember a wethers local to me that has less of a selection, I think only two ales. But it really feels like that's an exception."

A lot of them are jumping on the idea that the books are giving young women a false understand of what love is. The idea that fantasy and reality are two distinguishable things and people are smart enough not to mix the two up has been preached for years when it comes to popular entertainment. If young women are unable to understand that the depictions of love in a book may not be accurate to reality then they've got bigger problems than possible relationship complications.

Whilst people may mean no harm, a small percentage are careless enough that they still do cause loads of grief.  We had to spend loads of money on stiles and instead people would use the gates and fail to shut them properly afterwards.  The first you know about it is when someone from nearby calls you and tells your animals are out, either in their fields or worse their garden.  Rounding up sheep in the dark because some twat in a cagoule failed to shut a gate properly tends to cause a gradual build up of resentment against ramblers.

If I recall correctly, in some countries (like the US), you can't walk on the private land of another without permission.

Even forced us into single file too. Best thing is, the teacher has sent every single group since down that path, every year."

BritishSuccess,3bar5v,Sirsgirl,5,Sat Jun 27 18:54:14 2015 UTC,"My theory is that it's because American conservatives are intellectually bankrupt due to their long time anti-intellectualism, so they just ape liberal memes like moving to Canada.  It was popular among some groups of American liberals circa 2004 to declare they would move to Canada if George W. Bush won a second term.  That makes sense as Canada is more progressive.  There aren't many more religious and conservative countries than the US, at least that American conservatives would want to go to (Iran?  Unlikely)."

I'm gonna say something a bit sensitive now. The A Levels they did, the exams from 2001 to 2008, were way easier than the exams now. I've done exam papers from then, and compared to exam papers now, they were a walk in the park. They don't understand the pressure now.   A Level exams are not only way harder, but the course, which is designed to be done part in January and rest in May/June, is done all through May/June. On top of that, all unis seem to add an A* on all their offers and they seemingly think if they offer higher grades than they should, they might look more prestigious and the student might choose than uni as a result. Bath offered me A*AA for physics fgs - the uni is good but it's not that good. The pressure to do well is higher than ever. The offers back then weren't this high and the exams definitely weren't this demanding."

BritishSuccess,3ay5ov,awesomejt,3,Wed Jun 24 16:12:36 2015 UTC,Someone told me the other day that Oxbridge pretty much ignores your A-levels and just decides based on your interview nowadays.
BritishSuccess,3ay5ov,TycerX,33,Wed Jun 24 16:51:40 2015 UTC,"That's absolutely not the case. You need very good a-levels to even get an interview at Oxford. At Cambridge everyone gets an interview but you're just going along for the ride unless you have very good a-levels.  They even ""tier"" the subjects. So OP's subjects for example would be low (IT) and middle tier (Geog, Econ) because they are not the traditional academic subjects that Universities want you to have. The idea is that you turn up to university with a strong academic spine or core. Then as university progresses from undergrad to postgrad and beyond, you branch out into the specialisation you want.  Other good universities still want a-levels (entry standards are a key area of how universities are ranked). They won't tier the subjects so much and the lower down you go, they will just want any accredited a-levels.   Then you get down to your Lincoln's, Anglia Ruskin's, London or Manchester met's etc. To get into them you just have to open the door."

At Sussex they only allowed BA students to switch if their first year marks were good which gave me the impression that it was considered a ""tougher"" course. Also as I said previously, a few people I know wanted to switch after starting the BA.  I'm a bit biased tbh since I studied biomed and there's a general feeling that Bsc degrees hold more weight - but I'm sure that's just a weird form of snobbishness. Not having a clue about career options for geography graduates (human or physical) certainly doesn't help my position!  Good luck with your degree :-)"

The downside to the Virgin approach is that you must use their equipment, even if it's shit.  As the other person says, BT only maintains the line up to the master socket, and they charge if it a problem with the wiring on your side of that socket, like your extension wiring. Even if Virgin did the same thing, adjusting power levels would be something that is definitely on their side and wouldn't be charged anyway  BT and ISPs that use the BT network (except Sky) don't care what equipment you use. You can also be more flexible in where you want that equipment, and if you're not an idiot you can do it without seriously affecting your connection."

Plus, the superhub 1 was badly designed in terms of where the lights and cables were.

It appears to assume that every person on fibre to the cabinet has been sold a 38 or 76Mbps service, rather than ""up to"". That isn't actually true, because when you order, you get told an estimate of what you probably will get - and if that's not 76Mbps dead on, you're not going to get that.   In my own case, BT and every other ISP will say I can get 54-73Mbps (the lower number taking into account any unforseen issues, or dodgy wiring inside the home). I get 70-73Mbps."

The issue of speeds, distances and the ""lottery"" of what you will get is a very real one, but Which is doing a disservice by exaggerating things.  The point is that you are told the speeds you should actually expect before you order. It isn't bad advertising - unless BT and others are saying ""yes you'll get 76Mbps no problem"" but you actually get 10, which they don't.   but at least you can be confident of getting the speeds quoted in the adverts.

My view would be that if you have to brake and swerve because someone's cruising in the middle lane you weren't watching the road and planning ahead enough and that's not good either.
BritishSuccess,3anaaz,oneonetwooneonetwo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:01:31 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're doing 70 in the slow lane when you come up to him doing 60 in the middle, you do need to brake and move over two lanes before you can overtake."
BritishSuccess,3anaaz,NobblyNobody,2,Mon Jun 22 13:37:56 2015 UTC,"Brake and swerve suggests a last minute thing, though. In principle, if you're looking far down the road and planning ahead on a long, straight, clear motorway, you could have clocked the approaching slower vehicle and done your lane changes early without having to brake and swerve. If you want to do 70 (or more) on the motorway you just have to be prepared for when you catch up to the cars not doing 70."

Edit: Punctuation errors. My phone did an update over the weekend, and now it thinks I need a space after a word, before punctuation. Also random capitalisation of letters and not capitalisation of ""I""."
BritishSuccess,3anaaz,norwegianjon,9,Mon Jun 22 18:21:54 2015 UTC,"A few miles? That's daft, but I wish they'd define what is reasonable.

BritishSuccess,3anaaz,governmentyard,3,Mon Jun 22 08:00:28 2015 UTC,"The problem is it's one where you really do have to leave a lot of discretion to the police seeing it happening but, at the same time, I don't think I've ever kept up with a police car on the motorway.

BritishSuccess,3anaaz,oneonetwooneonetwo,-2,Mon Jun 22 10:24:05 2015 UTC,"Isn't it something to do with the speed? If you're going the limit in the middle lane, that's all good right?"
BritishSuccess,3anaaz,Srekcalp,2,Mon Jun 22 12:51:25 2015 UTC,"It's certainly a factor but you're still supposed to keep left to let things pass unless you're passing yourself. You're not the motorway speed regulator so if something wants to blow past you're still causing an obstruction and reducing the motorway's flow.  I remember reading an account of this story which said that cars had to ""swerve"" around this guy. Obviously, if you find yourself having to swerve to avoid a cruising vehicle on a motorway you weren't exactly keeping your eyes peeled. The fact the drivers you're obstructing aren't Lewis Hamilton/are speeding is actually irrelevant to the lane hogging issue."

BritishSuccess,3am7df,dibblah,3,Sun Jun 21 21:31:27 2015 UTC,"Recipe is simple.   Eggs, depending on how much batter you want, either about 2 or 3. Crack them into a measuring jug, mix them up. Add milk to the same volume as the eggs, so if the eggs take up 100ml in the jug, add another 100ml of milk. Mix. Add plain flour to the same volume, so your final mix is 300ml. This is a bit tricky, you may want to add smaller amounts and mix, and if it's too little, add a bit more.   I've usually then put the batter in the fridge, occasionally overnight if I'm that prepared for cooking. Then, during the cooking:   You'll want to use a not small pan - I used to use cake trays for my Yorkshires, but found that they were too small, so I've recently used a couple of glass casserole dish lids instead to make a couple of giant ones. (I've also been known to use a frying pan with the handle taken off to make a huge one...) Whatever type of dish you use, put it in the oven set to the hottest temperature you can (usually around 220ºC). Once the dishes are hot, take them back out of the oven, and, again this is what I've recently been doing, put some butter on the dish to grease it up, brushing it all around the pan. Put a good amount of batter into the dish and pop it into the oven. Take anything else that is in the oven out if you're serving that bit up (usually for me it's the roast potatoes at this point). Leave them in the oven for around 10-15 minutes or so - again, I've tended to use this time to dish up the rest of the meal onto plates. When you take them out, they should be nice and risen and nice and brown. Don't open the oven while they're still rising - if you want to check to make sure they're okay, put them in an oven with a window.   And there you go - Yorkshire puddings. Or Uorksjorw piddings. Whatever."

BritishSuccess,3akxjt,starlinguk,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:02:25 2015 UTC,"A delay of 30-59 minutes gets you half the value of your journey in rail travel vouchers, 60+ minutes gets the full value of the journey.  So a single ticket is divided by 2 for 30+ or face value for 60+. A return is 2 journeys so 30+ is divided by 4, 60+ is divided by 2. Weekly tickets are the equivalent of 10 journeys (so divide by 10 for the per journey price), monthly I think is 40 journeys, annual 400 but I'm not 100% on the last 2. You can obviously use those 3 types more than that set amount of journeys but that's how the cost is worked out.  Some things worth noting;  Check the companies website before you travel, if the service is cancelled in advance and posted on the website you can't claim a delay for it, the next train will be used to assess punctuality.  Keep your tickets, you'll need to send those in.  Fill the form in properly. I know I shouldn't have to point that out but I do. If other things increased the delay (overcrowding on the next train etc) add a small note on the form or attach a letter explaining. If you changed services in your journey, say which bit was delayed."

BritishSuccess,3akxjt,Vertman3000,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:26:03 2015 UTC,"You can obviously claim for last minute cancellations. In your example if you get to your destination 60 minutes or more after your scheduled journey was meant to (this is what matters, not when your next train starts) then you'd get the whole journeys value compensated. It's the ones that are cancelled for like a whole week for something like engineering works and will be decided quite a bit in advance that you can't claim for.  If you put your proposed journey into the company's website (pretty sure this should work on all operators websites) as if you're buying a new ticket, you'll see what trains are available around that time so you'll know what to do if yours is cancelled or delayed. You won't see an option for a planned delay but somewhere on the website they'll be details for why it's cancelled.

I think that the puppets were of their time and if they were to use puppets today, it wouldn't seem right. They haven't changed the original TB vehicles too much, just updating things to take advantage of what can be done with CGI.  They do actually use real filmed model sets to help make it feel more like the original, so the water effects are scaled just like the original because they're filmed in the same way.  It's as faithful to the original as it can be, whilst updating it for the 21st Century and I think it needs to be watched with that in mind."

BritishSuccess,38v7zz,miniflip,4,Sun Jun 7 21:40:16 2015 UTC,OK this is gonna sound fairly mental. I'm wondering if the reason behind the size differences is due to when it became common place to wear clothing and cover the penile area fully. So when the area wasn't fully covered a long long time ago women would select a mate partly because of penis size giving the chance for natural selection to increase the average size of penises in that region.
BritishSuccess,38v7zz,slaming,31,Sun Jun 7 22:41:08 2015 UTC,You're right....that does sound fairly mental!
BritishSuccess,38v7zz,Molineux28,8,Sun Jun 7 22:47:21 2015 UTC,"I think if we're going so far back that clothing didn't cover the groin area, a female would 'choose' her mate based on his strength/speed and therefore his ability to protect and provide for her and their children.

BritishSuccess,38v7zz,Srekcalp,2,Sun Jun 7 09:14:53 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter how the kid is bought up, the genes come from the parents.

BritishSuccess,38v7zz,Mr_Evil_MSc,3,Sun Jun 7 11:36:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe not a beneficial survival trait but a beneficial fertility trait, such as large hips and breasts. Does having a bigger penis make you more fertile? Likely no, but do bigger breasts make you more fertile?"
BritishSuccess,38v7zz,slaming,-1,Sun Jun 7 14:37:34 2015 UTC,"They indicate larger mammary glands, making you a better feeder of babies indicating an increased survival benefit.

BritishSuccess,38v7zz,Mr_Evil_MSc,1 point,Sun Jun 7 11:46:31 2015 UTC,"Fisherian runaway:       Fisherian or Fisher's runaway, first proposed by R. A. Fisher in the early 20th century, is a hypothesized genetic selection mechanism for the evolution of exaggerated male ornamentation (a subtype secondary sexual characteristic) observed in numerous sexually reproducing species; based upon the preference (or attraction) of females for ornamented male mates (known as female choice).        The evolution of male ornamentation, an example being the colourful and elaborate peacock plumage compared to the relatively subdued peahen plumage, represented a paradox for evolutionary biologists in the period following Darwin and leading up to the modern evolutionary synthesis; the selection for costly ornaments appearing incompatible with natural selection. Fisherian runaway is an attempt to resolve this paradox using an assumed genetic basis for both the preference and the ornament, and through the less obvious but powerful forces of sexual selection (a sub component of natural selection). Fisherian runaway hypothesizes that females choose ""attractive"" males with the most exaggerated ornaments based solely upon the males' possession of that ornament. According to Fisher, if strong enough, female preference for exaggerated ornamentation in mate selection could be enough to undermine natural selection if the ornament under sexual selection is otherwise non-adaptive (naturally selected against). Fisher hypothesized this counteraction would result in the next generation's male offspring being more likely to possess the ornament (and female offspring more likely to possess the preference for the ornament) than the previous generation. Over subsequent generations this would lead to the runaway selection (via a positive feedback mechanism) for males who possess the most exaggerated ornaments.     Fisherian runaway sought to explain the paradox of male ornamentation but neither the mechanism nor the secondary sexual characteristic or preference is restricted to this system: Fisherian runaway can be applied to include sexually dimorphic traits and characters such as behaviour and structural displays expressed by either sex.

If you want to make a donation go straight to the charity. The companies chuggers work for get on average £150 per signup which is pretty much all of your first years donation.

BritishSuccess,38hoqg,aamir__mir,-4,Sat Jun 6 01:16:10 2015 UTC,Think of it as a sales job - for them. I'm sorry you have problem with people earning wages.  Like I've repeated a dozen times already - it's a huge return on investment for charities. That's all there is to it - for every pound they put in they get 4 out.  Like it it or not people don't volunteer to pay that money without a bit of accosting.  That's just how it works. Most people will just not pay unless they are nagged a little bit.

BritishSuccess,38hoqg,aamir__mir,-7,Thu Jun 4 19:18:17 2015 UTC,Again. They make more money for the charities than the charities would make otherwise.   It's fucking hard work - I know because I know people who've done it.   One just had to fold the company because and the other works silly hours.   They put a lot of hard work into it.  It's a sales job.  It takes men in suits who press palms and make deals and if they weren't doing that they'd go elsewhere.   It's hugely draining.   So tell me. What do you feel is a decent wage for people doing this job - bearing in mind that you are doing absolutely fuck all yourself?
BritishSuccess,38hoqg,letsgocrazy,6,Thu Jun 4 19:55:11 2015 UTC,it should be illegal to mislead people like that. people are signing up to give money to charity when the first year of their donations aren't even going to the charity its completely misleading! I know full well how hard of a job it is and how long the hours are but the fundraisers themselves make nothing compared to the guys sat in the offices earning thousands from people who think they are giving to charity. id never give to a person like that. i always listen to them but if i feel like i want to give id give direct to the charity

Back when I was in uni in central London I saw one of these chuggers and having nothing to do I thought I'd listen to his story. I was told of the kids in Africa that have no water, need mosquito nets etc and so I decided to sign up. It was only £5 a month, right?  2 months later I get a call from a credit company demanding to know why I haven't paid my bill, then I start getting letters from 5 other companies. The charity was a scam, purely getting people's details for identity theft. It took me months to clear my name.  Moral of the story kids, NEVER EVER give to chuggers. There is no guarantee these people are who they say they are. All a scammer needs to do is get some tabards printed saying 'action aid' or something and they appear real. Sometimes the chugger themselves may not know its a scam.  For that matter I rarely give to charity now. I hate when they put on the sob story on TV saying 'these people need money' without giving a shred of evidence that their previous donations have made a blind difference. I particularly avoid charities where there are already services covering that area. Breast cancer charities? Why start a new one... there are hundreds of them already."
BritishSuccess,38hoqg,cac2008,16,Thu Jun 4 08:39:14 2015 UTC,Bloody hell. I'd never have thought of that. Lucky I'm tight and would never give to charity on a direct debit basis anyway.

No harm in being extra safe, but not all charities are out to scam you."
BritishSuccess,38hoqg,joeflan91,9,Thu Jun 4 13:04:26 2015 UTC,"Sure enough. I don't donate to charities now though for a number of reasons:  1) Apart from a rare few, I see no evidence that their individual campaigns are effective. They're basically asking us to give them money with no proof that it leads to anything. The TV adverts try to emotionally lure us in without giving objective evidence of their past successes. We should be choosing who to give our money to based on evidence, not based on who hired the most expensive PR company.  2) There's often too many charities working towards the same thing. A quick search on CharityChoice returned over 50 breast cancer charities all doing basically the same thing. It seems to be in vogue to start a charity with someone's name on it, rather than fundraising or assisting an already established charity.  3) Many foreign/international aid charities are regularly criticised for making the problem worse, by disincentivising the government of these countries from taking any action. This issue is often discussed in international development degrees.  4) As a generalisation of above, most charities deal with symptoms, not causes. Whilst some people do indeed need the 'plaster' of a foodbank this does not deal with the deeper issue. Yes, charities dealing with international disaster response don't need to consider this, but a charity that aims to provide charitable help for higher education for children from BME groups only helps individuals, and doesn't even consider the cause of the issue.  5) Charities often benefit the state as opposed to the society. Any large scale support by charities or philanthropists to provide 'essential services' is fundamentally ethically wrong. It carries severe risks of altering the balance of funding from the public sector to the private sector, exposing those who are most at need to the vagaries of the market. Those most vulnerable then only receive fluctuating care of gradually decreasing quality.  6) Charities promote favouritism of causes, not fairness. People tend to donate to issues that appeal to them, but this then leads to money being diverted from needy but unpopular issues, to those in vogue. Instead aid for needy causes should be handled by the Government, but this one at the moment is looking for any excuse to pass the bill onto the private sector (see point 5).  TL:DR - there should be no need for charities, as it should be handled by the government. In attempting to start new charities, promote existing charities and support campaigns we are letting our existing government cut their social net even further."
BritishSuccess,38hoqg,cac2008,5,Thu Jun 4 13:56:59 2015 UTC,"there should be no need for charities, as it should be handled by the government   I very strongly disagree. There are loads of charities out there that shouldn't be state funded at all. The Royal Academy, for example, meets it running costs entirely out of revenue that it raises itself from donations and entry fees. Why should people who don't care about the visual arts, or who can't easily make it to their shows in central London, pay for this institution? And why should the Academy have to justify its expenditure to some bored civil servant hamstrung by rules and with all the artistic taste of a cat, instead of justifying its expenditure to knowledgeable members and supporters who actually give a shit?"

You're simply trying to get on with your day and there's someone stepping into your path trying to reel you in with a sob story.

""sorry starving African kids, cac2008 wanted to get back to his office and use Reddit while eating his Tesco's meal deal""   African kids are starving because their own countries are doing fuck all for them, something many of these charities are making worse by disincentivising any action from their own countries. Why should they have to do anything, if we'll feed and clothe the worse off in their own country?   They are instructed not to harass people, but you can't take away someone's right's to approach you in the speech.   Indeed, but I can complain to the powers that be for the nuisance, and it finally appears that some councils are listening.   You'll be wanting to fine homeless people £1000 for sleeping rough or begging next wont you?   That's a bit of a wide leap from talking about charity isn't it? No I don't think they should be fined, I think the bloody government should be fined and taken to court for allowing this situation to get in such a mess in the first place, but whilst charities are going to get these people they help they rightly need, they also ensure that the government will cross yet another social care topic off the balance sheet.

And then.   I became the 4%. All at once my deliveries stopped and two packages had not arrived. For the first few days they were just ""in transit"", nothing to worry about I thought. Two days later nothing. Three days I'm anxious, I email the retailer. On the fourth day one of the parcels arrived, the package torn the labels ruined. I signed. By the fifth day the last package still had not arrived, I checked the tracking once more: Status Unknown.   I like to think my last package is still out there somewhere, travelling endlessly around a Yodel conveyor belt, or maybe lost under a drivers chair but who knows.

I liked a reasonable number of the songs and didn't actively dislike any of them.  Most of the performers seemed to be pretty good singers, and some of them were very very good.  I thought it was noticeable that Graham Norton was quite quiet this year, and mainly just made snippy comments talking over the top of the presenters, which was odd because they spoke English for almost the entirety of the show.  I'd say this year, I felt more embarrassed seeing people desperately trying to take the piss out of things that were perfectly decent and normal because that's what they felt they had to do."

BritishSuccess,3702m0,giggsy664,1 point,Sat May 23 23:48:54 2015 UTC,It is in the constitution that they have to have a referendum every time it's amended.

It was just always assumed that marriage was between a man and a woman, so in 2006 when there was a case to get the state to recognise a Canadian same sex marriage, it was rejected by the courts. The vote was just to amend the constitution to clarify that a marriage is between any two persons, although a separate bill will have to be drawn up for same sex couples to marry in Ireland and we should see marriages by Christmas if it gets through the Oireachtas quick enough."

I was very vocally 'anti-Yodel' at the time & fought against the switch - but the decision was made anyway.    I've been very impressed with the performance & have had to eat a bit of humble pie.    One of the best improvements they've made is to incorporate GPS into their hand-held signature/POD terminals. This means that the shady drivers can no longer 'sign' for all the parcels in their own back yard...

A few days later someone knocked at my door asking why I hadn't come to collect my package. Turns out they had delivered it about 10 doors down from me. That's not a neighbour, That's someone who lives on the same street as me.  Second time I ordered a new PC chair, it was ""delivered"" by yodel. By delivered I mean left behind my bin in broad daylight (keep in mind the gap it had been was huge and there was no way it was hidden), while it was raining. And it was missing when I finally got in that evening. Phoned up Yodel got told that it was ""left with a neighbour"" despite the note they gave me saying it was left behind the bin and there being a large gap behind my recycling bin.  They told me that they would look into it and get back to me. After leaving it a week I called again, was fobbed off and told they were still looking into it and ""are we Suuuuuure a neighbour doesn't have it"". Called AGAIN a week later after waiting to hear from them and they told me that it was up to Amazon to deal with it and it had nothing to do with them at all.  God I fucking hate Yodel."

BritishSuccess,36hf5b,dinocheese,33,Tue May 19 12:25:01 2015 UTC,"Good for you - politeness is the future.  Some years back I was cold-called by someone or other who then proceeded with the usual ingratiation:'Hello sir, and how are you today?'.    I knew what was coming, but hey - manners: 'I'm very well, and how are you?'.   'You are the first customer ever to ask me that'.  He may well have been lying, but it made me feel more entitled to curtail him before he could get very far through his spiel."
BritishSuccess,36hf5b,BlackJackKetchum,8,Tue May 19 13:45:25 2015 UTC,"'You are the first customer ever to ask me that'.   I'm not surprised it is utterly, utterly impertinent to ask a customer/anyone you don't know personally how they are.  More and more people are being taught to do this it seems and it drives me mad. They can do it in America if they want to but I wish we could stamp it out.  What's wrong with talking about the weather?"

BritishSuccess,36hf5b,Poop_Slow_Think_Long,2,Wed May 20 01:20:21 2015 UTC,I see what you're saying but you can't meaningfully care about someone you know nothing about. And asking this question to strangers is just inviting them to feel bad and possibly lie to you.   After my father had his heart attack I would go shopping to distract myself. Every time a cashier asked me how I was I would die a bit inside. It reminded me of what had just happened at the worst moment and then I felt compelled to lie and say I was fine when really I wasn't. That made everything worse.   Because people lie you don't know how many people you've done this to.

BritishSuccess,35tk28,rupesmanuva,14,Wed May 13 14:23:29 2015 UTC,It's not mostly bone! It's the usual proportion of bone that you find an actual chicken :/
BritishSuccess,35tk28,hypnocyst,1 point,Wed May 13 16:03:43 2015 UTC,"That implies that all chickens are the same size. They are not. Some are well fed, some less so.   A butchers i used to go to used to sell 5kg of chicken breasts which (i'm pulling a number out of the air here) had around 20 of them in the pack. My current butchers sells 5kg packs of chicken with 13-14 breasts in them, meaning the pack with fewer breast in for the same weight came from chickens with more meat in relation to their bones than the pack with more, smaller breasts. I assure you, proportion of meat to bone is clearly not uniform. Unless you're a fatty who conforms to the ""it's not fat, I'm just big boned"" bollocks."

I had happily reluctantly got my £20 out of the cash point on the Monday morning on the way to the bus station, hopped on the bus and pushed it over to the driver.   ""A weekly ticket, please"", I chirped.  The driver looked at me like I had just simultaneously pissed on his cornflakes, kicked his dog and eaten his last rolo without permission.  ""It's £21 mate"", he replied acidly.   I blinked. ""Oh, it was £19 last week""  ""£21 mate"", he barked back.  I scraped through my pockets for change and miraculously found a fiver in the back pocket of my jeans, remnants from the Friday night at the pub. I handed it over to him.  The driver, again, looked at it, then back up at me. This time with full on scorn and disgust.  ""I've not got enough change for that. I'll have to print you a change note"".   How a bus driver thought he was going to manage the rest of the day without £4 in change is beyond me.  I wandered off to the back of the bus feeling deflated. Unsurprisingly, I saw a similar thing happen to countless people getting on the bus during my travels.  I put the change note in my wallet and forgot about it.   The next Monday rolls along and I made sure I had enough money in change for the, frankly, heinously inconvenient £21 ticket price. When I stepped onto the bus, however, I remembered my change ticket.   ""One weekly ticket please"".  Not as much as a grunt from the driver.   Fine, then. I paid the driver (the same driver from the week prior, no less) in a £20 note and a £4 change note. He looked at me with eyes that wished a life of despair to me and my family, but begrudgingly accepted it and gave me £3 in precious £1 coins.  I half expected a change note for £3 and I could carry on the game for at least another week. Shame, really.     A month later I bought a car."

I've gotten into arguments before about the problems with discussion on reddit, with disliked opinions getting downvoted to hell with absolutely zero discussion, even dumb shit like someone not like harry potter always gets downvoted.   However, the other points he made were, in my opinion, complete jumps in logic that benefit his particular viewpoint. ""We all know UKIP are only going to continue to grow"" for instance. We've all seen parties get very popular only to do terribly within the next few years, look at lib dems last election, BNP a few years a go, and greens seemingly forever.   But to suggest that no-one will listen because we're all 5 year old socialists while the comment in question has positive points and is clearly not just being downvoted is ludicrous. It's a bit of a victim complex.  EDIT: Also, the Green party is really popular when you get down to it, but its not people's first choice.

BritishSuccess,35abwa,Kiin,0,Sat May 9 12:28:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not even going to bother reading most of that, largely because it has nothing to do with the poknt I made.  Obviously the BNP are very different from UKIP in terms of policy,  but what I said was true. Both parties had remained relatively obscure,  reliant on a small core of committed supporters, until they experienced a change in leadership.    Both Farage and Griffin proved to be charismatic leaders whose ability to give their parties a more relatable face, and increased their respective party's popularity,  but in their absence there was little that could be done to save them.  This might not be as true for UKIP, given that they made more progress than the BNP ever did, gaining a much larger voter base and a seat in parliament. But without a charismatic,  press-friendly leader like Farage,  I have to wonder how much longer they will hold on."

BritishSuccess,359o08,tombot18,12,Fri May 8 12:39:30 2015 UTC,"I have been in work but I don't mind replying - in fact I already posted why in another thread:  Tory tax policy will be financially beneficial for my family and I. Inheritance tax alone was a big reason. But I am also in favour of pro-business enterprise taxes as I believe the resurgence of small businesses will be the salvation of our economy long term. Fiscal conservatism supports that goal whereas the re-distribution of wealth sidesteps it. I hate the idea of a mansion tax, although I feel obliged to point out that it wouldn't have affected us as we live in a modest home, however I am utterly disillusioned with Labour's politics of envy. It is not simply an insult to the rich, it feels like a insult to any reasonably comfortable middle class family who have worked hard and saved hard. And I don't like the faces in the Labour team. I find them to be shallow and frequently vitriolic voices in opposition, whereas the conservative team is much more experienced and a safer pair of hands. That's me being shallow, but it plays it's part. I was delighted to see Ed Balls lose his seat. I also find Labour's pretensions towards economic competence to be undermined by not merely their record, but by their 2015 manifesto policies. Energy price freezes, rent controls and higher taxes... none of these will promote a healthy economic revival according to the sources of analysis I trust, and smack of populist policies dressed up to seem sounder than they are. Inequality in our country is an issue, but I don't believe any of the leftist Miliband policies tackle the underlying reasons behind it. It's been all surface. I voted Tory because I want the strongest government possible. None of the left of centre parties could provide that kind of stability in coalition. The warnings about the SNP may well turn out to be exaggerated, but nevertheless worth heeding. I want to see how they behave in the UK Parliament in opposition, we don't hear that much about their day to day politics in Scotland. I think it's a good thing for the Union for Scotland to be better represented in London, however I do fear the idea of a weak government propped up by a party with an uncertain but hot-headed agenda and a lot of momentum behind it. Let's see how they play being in opposition before we let them in the hen-house. I have a lot of time for the Liberal Democrats and Nick Clegg, and I'm sorry to see him so punishingly defeated. I hope they can rebuild and provide a sensible liberal voice in protest. I thought they did a good job in coalition. I want this cycle of inter-generational debt to be brought under control. It is a massive number and cannot be tackled in a single parliament, or even two or three. Labour pussyfooted around that, The SNP plain don't give a fuck but the Tories do and I hope they will re-commit to tackling it in this government. What I'm worried about with the Tories: Europe. I'd hate to see the whole party divide up AGAIN and self-destruct over this bloody issue. I really hope there will be cooperation and an attempt at sensible outcomes. UKIP exist for a reason, there is no need for the Tories to follow them. They have a clear path to take: one of re-negotiation, a better deal for the exchequer and a better alliance with countries we trade so much with. Furthermore I am concerned about the loss of a liberal voice on social and environmental policies. But the economy comes first. The NHS is at risk of mis-management no matter who is in power, and I don't believe the Tories are stupid enough to carve it up like their opponents claim. It is under strain not simply from a lack of money but also increasing demand and the complexity of modern medical care, particularly among the elderly. If any party will be committed to helping the elderly, including reforming their care arrangements, it's the Tories, if only to protect a core portion of their vote. I have parents who will soon be entering that stage of life and I'm very wary about the challenges ahead."

I voted Conservative (despite being in a location where Labour got 75% of the vote), because whilst I do believe in liberal values (Lib-Dem at the last election), the economy just has to come first, and I don't trust anyone else with it. There is a reason we're doing so well compared to the rest of Europe.  I still believe the Tories could have done a better job, especially on contentious issues such as the bedroom tax or the changes to disability benefits. I am also very against fox hunting, the new ""porn laws"" and the snoopers charter.At the end of the day, no party represents my views in their entirety, but for the country as a WHOLE, I believe the Tories will do the best."

All I know is that the vulnerable people in my life have really struggled this past 5 years, and now it looks like that's only going to get worse, and I couldn't in good conscience vote for that.   What happens if/when we do 'recover'? Who defines what recovery looks like? Completely eliminating the deficit? In the unlikely event that we get there, it's not like there is any plan to re-fund or improve the services that have received cuts - so the people who are hurt most by the cuts are shit out of luck for good, or at least until they die.    *A recovery that keep slowing every quarter."

There are of course cases where both and fine and neccersary (students or stay at home mothers/fathers perhaps for the former, shadowing executives at a corporate office). But they have become abused by businesses with full time staff cut to be replaced by 0 hours contracts, working only when the company needs to, but making it difficult for the worker to gain other employment to fit their ""0 hours"". 0 hours contracts in principle are fine, but unregulated use is causing employment issues that the last government ignored and that was Labour's issue."

BritishSuccess,34zfts,BadBoyFTW,14,Wed May 6 11:05:51 2015 UTC,"The government floated Royal Mail (founded 1516) on the stock market.  The idea is that you sell a bunch of the shares to ""known"" companies or individuals before opening it to the public at a predetermined price based on it's value.  You do this so that once it goes live the price doesn't resemble a tsunami and stops it being hugely volatile in the opening period.  Unfortunately, depending on who you believe, the Conservatives 'accidentally' hugely undervalued the shares they sold to - literally - their friends. One of the individuals who got some shares was the fucking Best Man at George Osborne wedding.  The 'deal' is that you're not supposed to sell those shares. You're 'chosen' because you agree to not sell immediately if the price goes up. You're supposed to see it as a ""long term investment"", not a smash and grab robbery.  Well, guess what happened. They hugely undervalued it and a lot of the people who weren't supposed to sell simply sold. And they raked in millions. They might as well have taken it straight out of the government bank accounts because our tax money generated that value to begin with. Then those fucking assholes pocketed it all.  And lets keep in mind the entire sale was ridiculed from step one. And people were calling them out on undervalueing it before it went live.  They knew. They didn't care. It was as close to embezzlement you can get.  Unless, as I said, you believe it was all just an innocent mistake by otherwise upstanding loyal citizens of the United Kingdom with only our best interests at heart...

BritishSuccess,34p3sh,lobstronomosity,30,Sun May 3 09:55:39 2015 UTC,"As I understand it from my vague understanding of boxing, Mayweather is undefeated at boxing because he's like Chelsea,bhe defends all match, doesn't do attacking play and then wins cause of a few jabs on judges decisions.  Unlike Chelsea who play offensive when they're against smaller teams, he doesn't face smaller teams every few weekends cause he doesn't fight every weekend for whatever reason. He only fights every two years so for the majority of his existence no one cares he exists. But when his fight comes around media make it a big thing because he's undefeated and a smack talker so it's easy to create a narrative.   As he only fights every two years people forget that he isn't very interesting to watch and figure they'll watch him because this much hype must mean something good is gonna happen, like him playing offence and losing. Nothing good happens and people are shocked.  TL:DR - Mayweather is Chelsea. Media and sports are crazy. People are stupid."

August the 24th be with you <name here>... Always.  And so on for every single day of the year. It generally came from the same number so people were able to block it, but I'd occasionally switch the number and people would start getting them again, much to their annoyance.  In the run up to May the 4th this year I've had it automatically changing the number every day so it's unblockable.

First past the post leads to stagnant boroughs.  I want a political system where parties are more incentivised to produce results rather than rest because they're in a safe seat.

We get a political party based on PR, but in addition we have unallied local representatives.

Many countries around the world, including multiple first world countries with stable democracies and economies, use PR to great effect, and the scenario you describe can easily be avoided by introducing a minimum threshold for a party to enter parliament, such as modern-day Germany does (where any party needs at least 5% of the national vote to be represented). A system which allows a party with 11% vote share to gain 11% representation is much better IMO than that party getting 0% representation, which can and does frequently happen with FPTP.

The Fascist party that developed in Italy in the 1920s rigidly enforced conservative values and behavior norms during the Mussolini regime. As a political epithet, fascist was subsequently used in an anti-authoritarian sense to emphasize the common ideology of governmental suppression of individual freedom. It has also been applied to a broad range of people and groups, including people of many religious faiths, particularly fundamentalist groups. The individual, institution, or group(s) called fascist often find the use of the term in this way to be highly offensive and inappropriate.

BritishSuccess,344umo,lawlore,7,Tue Apr 28 12:12:40 2015 UTC,"The Speaker is designed to be a non-partisan role- they are unbiased and run Parliament sessions from a neutral perspective. As such, that role is somewhat at odds with running a political campaign in an election- he cannot express an opinion or create policies, as this opens him up to accusations of being biased.  However, to just automatically assign the seat to him (or to create a constituency specifically for the Speaker) would be undemocratic. This means the major parties do not run candidates against Bercow in his constituency of Buckingham- they could, but they don't. It is therefore tradition for the Speaker to run virtually unopposed, and win with a big majority.  For this election, UKIP and the Greens are opposing, and in 2010 it was UKIP, minor parties and independents, including one who campaigned that Buckingham was not being heard as a result of this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_(UK_Parliament_constituency) .

Most of the people taking photos/videos of an event choose to hold their devices in a way that blocks the view of the people behind them - the selfiestick means that phones are held at an even higher level - blocking the view of people who are sat even further back. Because concerts/tournaments/shows are often attended by hundreds (if not thousands) of people, it's difficult to police everyone - therefore, the most effective way to deal with the issue is to have a mass ban."
BritishSuccess,341f2k,ChickenShoes,2,Mon Apr 27 19:07:25 2015 UTC,Yeah I can see the point . I do like recording during concerts but I'm incredibly concious of any nuisance it might bring to others. Got my hand covering the screen and usually film below the shoulders.    I guess selfie sticks go against any measurement you can take against bothering others and only amplifying it. A forest of selfie-sticks during a festival would be a nightmare. I already hate these dumb giant flagpoles with blow-up sheep and everything tied to it.  Way to obstruct vision.
BritishSuccess,341f2k,Thefriendlyfaceplant,2,Mon Apr 27 19:22:55 2015 UTC,"Okay I have to ask, why do you record during concerts at all? The quality of the video and sound is terrible because it's too dark and loud for anything other than professional equipment.  I've never enjoyed watching a friend's video of a gig they went to, all I can think is ""I can't hear it, I can't see it, why am I watching this shit?""  I'd bet £20 that you'll watch those videos maybe once, and then never watch them again. Why not just enjoy the show?"
BritishSuccess,341f2k,theartofrolling,1 point,Fri May 1 08:10:49 2015 UTC,"I edit the footage into short videos which I share on Facebook. The videos are short and interesting enough to watch back much like you would going through old photo galleries.    Some gigs aren't interesting to record. No matter how good the music, a dude with a guitar isn't going to yield interesting material. But at other times the gigs are small and intimate, or the light show is awesome, or crazy shit happens on stage. I'm really glad I captured those moments."

I always want to stop people at gigs and ask them why they are holding their phone over their heads and desperately recording something that will work out being dreadful quality, especially if they are unlucky enough to catch me singing along.   If they want a video of the band, there are literally thousands of them online. It can't be to some how have a personal record because they are never visible in the video.

BritishSuccess,33cdps,modernbenoni,2,Wed Apr 22 10:46:28 2015 UTC,"Mmm, the principle of a short-term loan isn't so much the problem as the aggressive marketing and streamlining that make it incredibly easy to put yourself in a really, really bad situation, and don't put across the possibility, or rather probability of it.  I'd say that for most people, taking out a payday loan is a terrible idea that should be avoided if at all possible.  The marketing is clearly aimed towards making it a triviality, something that the naive might think that ""people just do"".  I've had perfectly sensible friends who've done it once, paid it off and said ""jesus, never again"" because for all it cost them, they can see just how easily it could have cost them much, much more."
BritishSuccess,33cdps,Richeh,0,Wed Apr 22 11:20:30 2015 UTC,"Are you honestly saying that it is probable that you won't pay off the loan when you planned to? I mean yes it is possible but with decent planning it won't happen. I'd hardly that say marketing is aggressive.  Yes it is ""easy"" to wind up with a lot of debt, if you consider ignoring the debt and waiting for it to build up to be ""easy""."
BritishSuccess,33cdps,modernbenoni,6,Wed Apr 22 15:44:50 2015 UTC,"I mean that the people going into a payday loan won't realize the implication of the consequences of not paying it off.  What's the worst that can happen, right?  Now, you write these people off as ""idiots"" as if they don't  matter.  We were all young once, and these can be teenagers going in to these agreements.  Yes, it's not the brightest move, but that doesn't mean they deserve to be left to a cycle of unmanageable debt.  And when you say it involves ""ignoring"" the debt, you're not acknowledging the tight financial situation that these people are in.  Maybe to you it's trivial to pay back a hundred quid, but there are people who genuinely live on a shoestring budget.    You borrow £100, because your rent is due and you're a bit short this month.  But maybe then your car breaks and the choice is between paying the loan back and getting it fixed, and your job depends on that car.  No brainer, right?  Only another £20 if you pay it back next paycheque.  Except it isn't, it's compound interest, hiked because it's past payment due, and a fine for late payment, so now you owe them £230.  If it's a good month, you've got, let's say, £120 to spare and you send it to Wonga.  You feel like a responsible person, you've got debts, but you're paying them off as fast as you can.  Next payday rolls around, you've eaten ramen all month, you've got £120 left again.  You ask Wonga how much you owe them now.  They tell you, it's three hundred pounds.  You're now throwing money as fast as you can at the problem but you have no earthly way of making money fast enough to pay it off.  Now, this is a fairly modest sum, calculated using Wonga's 1509% representative rate for late payments.  It's also a fairly responsible person, earning a low wage, who's been forced into one bad decision.  Now they're a slave to debt, their quality of life decreases exponentially no matter what they do.  Imagine if it'd been a larger loan?  More than one loan?  What if they were stupid enough to try and pay off the loan with another loan, and maybe a bit more to treat themselves to a night out?  If you're going bankrupt, no matter what you do, and you're paying everything you have just to mitigate it; wouldn't you be tempted just to think ""fuck it"", pretend the loan doesn't exist, stop eating ramen and start playing the lottery?"

Which kind of irritates me - there are times in my life when I would have done with £50 for a weekend and pay back £55 on Monday. Now this service is to be made illegal/unprofitable because inbred morons cant grasp the fact that you need to pay the money back soon.  Hell's teeth, they even classify themselves as payday loans ie. just enough to last till payday.

This doesn't really disprove your point as we'd have other slimy politicians performing that role, but I thought I'd point it out.   Also they make us a bucketload of cash every year so that's good.   This is a bit of a myth by the way. France makes loads more money out of their former royal palaces because you can actually go round them as they're not lived in by a current monarch. There is literally zero reason to believe tourists wouldn't keep coming to see the palaces were we to get rid of our monarchy. I mean just look at them, they're incredible buildings."

It's not just the buildings people come to see - look at the crowds which turn out worldwide whenever a living Royal shows up to do a thing.  I wouldn't say there's zero reason to assume anything. I'm not sure how the benefit to being able to go into a building would weigh against the negatives of there not being a chance to see a royal."

I don't like how they hold influence and wealth by birthright. I don't like how taxpayers subsidise their lifestyles. Those are my reasons, but I'm not trying to pursuade others particularly. We live in a democracy, after all, right?  Anyway, I'll quote from a blog here.   But why stop there, if we look at London's official tourism site the top 10 London attractions by visitor numbers for 2012 were as follows.  British Museum, Tate Modern, National Gallery, Natural History Museum, London Eye, Victoria and Albert Museum, Science Museum, Tower of London, Madame Tussauds and the Royal Museum of Greenwhich.  The astute will note that Betty's palace isn't on there. Some will say it's because people just stand outside it, well they could do that if it was empty couldn't they? But what about the guards in the funny hats I hear you ask. Well they could still have them there if they wanted as security when they fully open up the palace to visitors. Perhaps even turn it into a hotel, casino or how about the world's biggest cat house. Think of the tourism that could bring in? Businessmen would flock to spend time with some of Miss Betty's girls.  So what about France? Their version of Betty's palace is the Palace of Versailles which welcomes 5.3 million paid visitors every year. It is the fifth most visited paid attraction in France. Just to put that into perspective, their symbol of France's former absolute monarchy welcomes just under a fifth (18%) of the visitors that the UK welcomes.   Buckingham palace performs nowhere near as well as the Pallace of Versailles, so your asertion that it being lived in helps it in comparison is evidentially false."
BritishSuccess,33bsv1,auntie-matter,11,Tue Apr 21 11:38:53 2015 UTC,"Versailles is a slightly different thing. It's way more impressive than anything we have. That's like comparing the Blackpool tower to the Eiffel one. One might also argue that France has relatively little else worth visiting, whereas London is particularly rich in cool shit, although I don't really know how that works out.  Also, the crowds of people who turn up whenever a Royal does something are doing what? Enjoying the local architecture? People like the royal family. You might not, but people travelled from all over the world for the Jubilee a few years back. People who likely wouldn't have got on a plane just to go on a big wheel. Personally, I'd never bother going somewhere to see them, but plenty of people do.  Also it's not just tourists visiting a palace which makes us money. What about all the Royal estates, all of which pay directly into the country's coffers? Liz doesn't pay tax (a common complaint of republicans) because her entire income goes to the Revenue."

It's preposterous.  Money-wise, though, the most visited tourist attraction in Scotland over the last year was the National Museum of Scotland on Chambers Street - nothing to do with the monarchy - and the highest paid attraction was Edinburgh Castle. Holyrood Palace, where various members of the royal family do occasionally stay, didn't make the top 20. The Falkirk Wheel, however - ""the world’s only rotating boatlift"" - was 13th.

Neither of us know how many people's decision to visit the UK is influenced by the existence of the royal family. It's far from just ""visiting the palace"" which makes them part of the tourist draw.   If you can break down the visitor demographics to those places, that might be a bit more meaningful - I've been to see buckingham palace once when I was a kid and see no need to go back - but I'll go to the British Museum every chance I get because exhibits change and there's loads more to see there. I suspect I'm far from alone in that. So of course places like that are going to higher visitor numbers.  Strictly speaking the royal family is the state. So their estates are already owned by the country.  Head of state is an entirely ceremonial position. Why not choose it on the basis of whose vagina someone comes out of? It's just as valid a means of making the decision as anything else. Voting would just mean costly elections every so often and then nobody would be happy with the result anyway - look at how badly the position of PM goes every five years. Also, to be honest, it looks like a really shitty job. Sitting around waving and pretending to be interested in all that dull shit, never a day off, paparazzi everywhere.

The Prince of Wales is the eldest child of the British monarch Queen Elizabeth II and heir apparent to the British throne. Traditionally, the British monarch remains politically neutral.  The letters are sent by Charles in a private capacity, but concerns have been raised that they may represent the exercise of undue influence over British government ministers. Charles has described himself as a ""meddling prince"". Issues that Charles has expressed views about in public include farming, genetic modification, global warming, social deprivation, planning and architecture. The content of the black spider letters is known only anecdotally and from memoirs and leaks.  In 2010, The Guardian journalist Rob Evans made an application under British Freedom of Information legislation to see the Prince's 2004 and 2005 letters to ministers. After several legal cases the application was eventually refused by the Attorney General, Dominic Grieve in October 2012, and the case was the subject of an appeal in the Supreme Court, who in March 2015 ruled against the government's decision, and allowed for the eventual publication of the letters.

You do know the Queen only has power on paper, and should she ever actually use any, it would be disastrous for her and there would likely be serious consequences in terms of removal of the monarchy?

BritishSuccess,33a6wr,Brite1978,4,Mon Apr 20 21:43:59 2015 UTC,Ocado masterrace reporting in. Much better quality than everywhere else and never in the 2 years I've been using them has anything ever been substituted.
BritishSuccess,33a6wr,LazyPyro,1 point,Tue Apr 21 02:49:49 2015 UTC,"I live in Belfast, we can't use Ocado unfortunately."
BritishSuccess,33a6wr,LazyPyro,2,Tue Apr 21 05:51:17 2015 UTC,"Oh that's a shame. I do always recommend Ocado to people who prefer shopping online as they're the only ones that I've never had problems with (actually Morrisons as well since they use the exact same system). Sainsbury's were ok too but as your title implies you'd often get substitutions.  But at least they're not Tesco. Tesco is just the worst. They have complete and utter plebs packing your groceries, seemingly being dicks on purpose (putting heavy glass jars or cans on top of bread or crisps was a frequent occurrence).  Once, we ordered quite a lot of stuff and it turned up without bags. I asked ""where's the bags? You expect me to pick out all these items one by one? This is going to take all day"", and you know what his response was? He literally grunted. Like a pig. Urrrghhh. That's what he did. I shook my head in disbelief and just slowly brought items into my kitchen one by one while he just stood there like a bellend.  Obviously I complained immediately after this and was given a refund of the delivery charge on the spot directly to my card which was good of them, but ultimately pointless as this was the last straw for me. Never again will I order from Tesco online, no matter how many vouchers they insist on sending me. Also, that delivery charge refund was simply due to my order arriving without bags. The woman I spoke to had absolutely no response for the driver's behaviour and seemed to just not care, perhaps it's just normal now? I don't know.  This would never happen with anyone else. In fact Ocado/Morrisons don't just deliver to your doorstep, they will actually offer to bring your shopping into your house anywhere you want it."
BritishSuccess,33a6wr,steyyan,1 point,Tue Apr 21 06:28:35 2015 UTC,"I've ordered from Tesco frequently over the last two years (I'm just a student, so I can't afford this Ocado thing, and Sainsburys website is beyond horrible if you need to use the browser's zooming feature) and I've never had any real trouble with them. Granted, there has been some substitutions (once every 3-4 times maybe), but I've never been unhappy with their service..."

BritishSuccess,331afs,Something_Pithy,7,Sat Apr 18 22:50:59 2015 UTC,"the humour is never going to transfer very well. Especially since the earlier books rely so heavily on footnotes for humour.  That said, I think Hogfather was a FANTASTIC effort and probably the best adaptation, even though like with all of them they missed bits out. I really enjoyed Death in it and I would hope at some point they do Mort, Reaper man and so on. I thought they got Death dead-on! I also love how poignant Hogfather is. I think it's one of Pratchett's best books. I particularly love Death's little lies speech. I think they could have done the Auditors a little better though, then again they have so much more of a part in Thief of Time (this one REALLY needs an adaptation as well!)  I did not like how much David Jason is reused though. He shouldn't be both Rincewind and Albert.  The worst was Going Postal. They had this wonderful opportunity to realise these beautiful ghostly images of the old post office at work and they didn't do it.  As for TCOM/TLF, I was upset that they didn't keep twoflower speaking a different language but did it all in english. it made a lot less sense for Rincewind to approach him when there was no need for translation. Also he is clearly meant to be akin to the japanese or chinese in the books but he is american in the film.  All in all though, they help get people into discworld so I can't complain too much."

A black community, fed up of years of 'random' stop-and-searches targeting them, who already had tensions building between them and the police, became incensed over a police shooting of one of their own, which led to protests and riots. It doesn't make any of the criminal acts during those riots any less criminal, it just goes some way to explaining why the backlash against that particular shooting was so strong.

The term can be applied to many things in the UK, yet in the US it is reserved for only 4 things (first result in google for ""Violent Crime definition US"")   violent crime is composed of four offenses: murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault   This is taken from the home office guide on crime statistics in the UK, found here:https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/116226/user-guide-crime-statistics.pdf (Page 19 to be exact)   Violent crimes are those where the victim is intentionally stabbed, punched, kicked, pushed, jostled, etc. or threatened with violence whether or not there is any injury.

So that's calories burned.  You burn 2000-2500 calories a day, so each hour you wouldn't have been cycling uses about 100 calories.

BritishSuccess,32kuek,Tigers_Go_Rawr,3,Wed Apr 15 10:35:24 2015 UTC,"My gravy is very simple:  Use the pan you cooked the meat in, keep all the meat juices. Put on a low heat. Add a stock cube (same stock as the meat you cooked, obviously) then add some boiling water. To thicken it, I add cornflour. If you're making a lot of gravy, add more than one stock cube.  Protip - to stop it going lumpy, if you mix a heaped teaspoon of cornflour separately with cold water in a mug or jug or something, then pour it into the gravy pan and mix it in.  It's nothing fancy, but I've only ever had compliments about my roast dinners :)"

It was written on the label, but he couldn't find anything like the puds he's seen on TV and in cookbooks.  What a sad, stunted little pud it was :( It was the size of half of a small roast potato and half-squished underneath a slab of ""chicken"". It was a British Airways flight too.

Who the fuck do these politicians think they are telling us they know better) and a cut to the foreign aid budget (It's being used to overthrow governments leading to wars, they'd be better off donating to charities, the aid that went to Syria ended up in the hands of the ISIS). As these aren't extreme, and are good (in my opinion anyway) they will most likely get through in a coalition negotiation, with the extreme policies not standing a chance. Immigration is too high free movement works only in theory, having 28 states' migrants move to mainly 3 countries doesn't work well and should be revisited. However, if education was improved so we could have homegrown skilled workers to fill the jobs, we wouldn't need so many migrant workers... I'd prefer education be improved, but no party is offering it. Main party politics have dominated government too long, and it needs to change, UKIP are most likely to be successful, pointless voting a different minor party. A labour-SNP coalition terrifies me.

The current policy is more racist as it discriminates against places like India and New Zealand as we need to regulate the immigration from there more to make up for our open borders to the EU. UKIP would use a points system that places emphasis on speaking the language and having a skill set that we need. Immigration has positives and negatives and we would lose the negatives with this system. UKIP are one of the most open parties to asylum seekers, we believe it is British tradition and were one of the first to campaign to take in asylum seekers from Syria. UKIP does not believe in privatising the NHS in anyway. We plan to assist hospitals in paying off PFI and plan to enlist more nurses and doctors by saving in middle management so the NHS can do its job. The current NHS looks a bit like the hospital episode in Yes Minister.   Those are generally the three main misconceptions, any more precise questions I am happy to answer.

No-one got what they ordered, the waiters didn't have a clue who to give what, you just ate whatever ended up in front of you. By the time the bill comes around about half of the diners have already left, some I'm sure without paying a penny, others just guesstimating what to leave. The total collected is way, way short. So the poor sucker left to handle the bill comes back around asking for more. I've already paid over the odds, for not the meal I ordered. I sympathise, but not a chance am I handing over more.  I left before it got resolved. I sometimes wonder whose credit card ended up taking the hit, and did they ever get their money back from the free loaders."

Student landlords seem to like putting Virgin in their houses, and students who have to sort their own out like Virgin because they're one of the few ISPs to offer a less than 12 month contract.  So when you have houses with 5 or 6 people each torrenting shit 24/7, multiplied by hundreds of houses all sharing the same bit of local network, you get bad performance  I had VM in Reading.

BritishSuccess,31jknd,2-4601,3,Sun Apr 5 20:30:46 2015 UTC,"It kind of works though. There's a fine line between animation looking  decent or going into the uncanny valley.   What is really odd, but works well too, are things like the water looking wrong in the same way that it did in the original, because you can't scale waves authentically. It's wrong, but right for Thunderbirds. And the British countryside having short fuzzy yellow grass too. There's an odd level of detail gone into making this look very like the models and puppets of the original, when it could have been done 'properly'.   The pacing was the main difference. In the original, you did get the tension building up and then the action happening at the end, but this went for it right from the start, and within the first ten minutes we'd seen all of the Thunderbirds launch - which is always the best bit."

Now do the first step again, with the same laces as that step again. (the lock) Do those last two as much as you need, until the lace is used up. I can do a video if you're that interested."

BritishSuccess,30xiqe,alexandriaweb,9,Wed Apr 1 11:44:47 2015 UTC,"There is a misunderstading in general about what free speech means. Hate speech doesnt get a free pass because of free speech laws. Free speech is more something like in Russia where gay people cant even protest about the laws they have there without being arrested. It is not intended for bigots to be able to freely spill their hatred. For instance, you can't call your boss a cunt and pass it out as free speech, it is still grave misconduct and you will be liable for sacking. I didn't express myself as clearly as I would have wanted, sorry. She has the right to free speech, but not the right to incite hatred. People like that ukip councillor that said racist stuff and brushed it off as free speech. She was still being racist, dismissing a whole segment of people as one thing."
BritishSuccess,30xiqe,rbrenelli,6,Tue Mar 31 17:57:53 2015 UTC,"It is you who has got confused, sorry. If you call your boss a cunt at work then, because it is a workplace, they have the right to enforce their workplace standards and fire you. However that does not mean you should be prosecuted for it.   I do not think people being racists should be prosecuted for stating their disgusting opinions. Free speech is allowing, in a general sense, so as not to infringe the rights of others to have workplace standards etc., to say whatever horrible ignorant nasty offensive thing they like with the sensible caveat that someone cannot go around asking people to beat up someone else. Or indeed bomb someone else."
BritishSuccess,30xiqe,Timothy_Claypole,3,Wed Apr 1 05:53:47 2015 UTC,"The problem with this line of thinking is it does nothing to stem the flow of racism and bigotry that spreads through people.   Inciting hatred doesn't just tell people what you think, it convinces people to think it too. Whilst it doesn't  convince everyone, it obviously catches on with some people.  They might not be telling people to go beat people up, but they're telling them they should be beaten up, one way or another."
BritishSuccess,30xiqe,godtom,2,Wed Apr 1 07:11:21 2015 UTC,"The problem with this line of thinking is it does nothing to stem the flow of racism and bigotry that spreads through people.   It isn't supposed to. It is free speech, not an attempt to correct behaviour."
BritishSuccess,30xiqe,Timothy_Claypole,2,Wed Apr 1 07:47:14 2015 UTC,"That's the point of limitations to free speech - by all means hate somebody, but don't spread the irrational hate."
BritishSuccess,30xiqe,godtom,2,Wed Apr 1 09:57:30 2015 UTC,I think the point of free speech is we let people realise that irrational hate is irrational and not treat adults like children by not letting them say naughty words.
BritishSuccess,30xiqe,Kurskwastheworst,2,Wed Apr 1 13:12:11 2015 UTC,"The problem with ""leaving them to it"" is that people aren't going to realize, look how long it took for people to realise black people are people too. Or how nobody noticed Jews weren't evil, were human, and didn't deserve to be slaughtered.  Hatred begets hatred, one way or another, the less people spouting filth, the less people believe it."
BritishSuccess,30xiqe,godtom,2,Wed Apr 1 13:39:47 2015 UTC,So you believe that people can't be trusted to make their own decisions about what is right in the world and that we should leave it up to other people to tell us what is right?  Can you not see the hypocrisy of something like that?
BritishSuccess,30xiqe,Kurskwastheworst,1 point,Wed Apr 1 14:02:22 2015 UTC,"The long and short of it is no, people can't be trusted to make their own decisions of what is right and wrong, not when other people around them spew hate, even core beliefs of good people can be misdirected by people who are full of hate.   Free speech is all well and good unless it's hate speech. Teach your kids creationism and whilst stupid it doesn't hurt anyone, teach your kids that gay people deserve to die, then that's obviously hurting people."
BritishSuccess,30xiqe,godtom,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:07:36 2015 UTC,"Limitations on free speech should be for things such as shouting fire in a crowded theatre, or making a national call to kick the crap out of people of a certain demographic.

BritishSuccess,30xiqe,godtom,2,Wed Apr 1 21:58:13 2015 UTC,It has always been understood that human rights are always conditional on other human rights. Hate speech is not protected by free speech because it is being used to impede or hinder the human rights of others.
BritishSuccess,30xiqe,gamas,0,Wed Apr 1 08:33:44 2015 UTC,"Hate speech is not protected by free speech because it is being used to impede or hinder the human rights of others.   That doesn't quite make sense. I can impede/hinder the rights of others with the things I say without it being hate speech, and without it being a criminal offence otherwise.  Equally I can say hateful things without actually impeding/hindering the rights of others.   There is a line to be drawn, such as directly inciting acts of violence."
BritishSuccess,30xiqe,Timothy_Claypole,1 point,Wed Apr 1 18:47:50 2015 UTC,"Sorry, this is the same answer I gave the other user that replied to my comment, but I believe it still applies.   See, I don't disagree with you, and I said I wasn't sure I had expressed myself correctly. I mean that some people think that because of free speech there can be no consequences to what they say, for instance the employee or the ukip councillor that got sacked. They can and will suffer consequences such as those, and yes, it is meant to shield you from the state persecuting you and being arrested like the example I gave you for Russia. The misunderstanding is precisely that people think there are no consequences at all see, that they shouldn't be fired and so on.  And if what you end up saying, depending of the position you with old in society, what you say and the way you say it can be classified as hate speech, and that is punishable by law. I'm from Brazil and here during the elections one candidate not unlike Mr. Farage said on national television during one of the debates that the the anus is not part of the reproductive system and that ""we"" should stand out ground and hunt the gays, to be over with them, that the Christian family was majority and they should end that minority. Then he tried to get away with is as free speech. It wasn't, it was hate speech and he was condemned by the electoral national court here.  So this is what I meant about the misconception about free speech, there are still consequences depending on what you say, when and where and to whom."
BritishSuccess,30xiqe,rbrenelli,1 point,Wed Apr 1 08:50:48 2015 UTC,"There can be consequences for what you say, depending on context yes.   However where there are consequences you probably do not have freedom of speech as a result. It helps to only use ""freedom of speech"" in a general legal sense.

Hate speech doesnt get a free pass because of free speech laws.    I'm sorry, but you are wrong. Free speech as a principle means precisely that people can say stuff that we find abhorrent.   The reason is that noone has the authority to declare what is and isn't acceptable, because frankly, even though we may be right in this case, society has a long history of getting it wrong.   A hundred years ago people like you would have been requested exemptions for free speech so that people didn't ""blaspheme"", 50 years ago you would have been calling discussion of homosexuality ""obscene"" etc. Sure, you might be on the right side in this case, but you are supporting laws that make oppression easier.   Ideas - however repellant - should be open to criticism, and objection.   Reporting people to the police for their expressed ideas - however repellant - is the action of facists, and this country should be ashamed of its current stance on free speech."

BritishSuccess,30xiqe,rbrenelli,1 point,Wed Apr 1 21:45:30 2015 UTC,"I think we both share a similar position on morals (and I'd stand with you in calling that politician a grade A idiot).   You raise an important issue, which is the need to protect minorities from majority oppression. But that is exactly what we risk when we provide mechanisms for suppressing ideas by force (by people being able to declare things as ""hate speech"").  The Brazilian politician in your example was absolutely within his rights to express his stupid views.. and people are within their rights to judge him for them, or to support him on that.   What the right to free speech doesn't grant him however, is the right to use that speech to manifest those views.   He shouldn't have been convicted of hate speech for saying hateful things, he should have been convicted of abuse of power once he tried to use his authority to suppress the rights of others.  Can you see the distinction? .. the liberal position is that people need to have the right to express ideas, but they do not have the right to execute those ideas, and especially not to impose those views on others.   If we decide that we are going to be able to tell each other what we can and can't say, we end up in a very dangerous situation. Is see the ""left's"" love of hate speech laws in a very similar way to the ""rights"" misuse of ""terrorism"" - it is a tool of oppression wrapped up to look necessary."
BritishSuccess,30xiqe,moptic,2,Wed Apr 1 21:49:39 2015 UTC,"The Public Order Act 1986:  A person who uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or displays any written material which is threatening, abusive or insulting, is guilty of an offence if—          (a) he intends thereby to stir up racial hatred, or          (b) having regard to all the circumstances racial hatred is likely to be stirred up thereby.   There is a line to be drawn between the right to free speech, and the prevention of hate speech - in the UK it is the above definition which draws that line. You can be a massive racist, but you cannot do so in a way that might threaten others' safety. I don't think Katie has crossed this line, but if you're going to make public statements about Rochdale, where racial violence has already occurred, you have to be very careful about clause b). Note that since 2008 this legislation has been extended in England and Wales to include sexual as well as racial hatred."

It is OK for 16 year old kids to have sex but not to watch it on TV or online if it's classed as an 18.  That is just stupid. It should all be one age, no wonder we have so much teenage pregnancies and unsafe sex because kids have to experiment for themselves rather than be educated properly about it. If a 16 year old is allowed to do these things, then they should be allowed to watch or play ""18 rated"" things.

BritishSuccess,30t7wv,br1ggsy,2,Tue Mar 31 12:18:42 2015 UTC,"My last point is tongue in cheek. The SNP campaigned to allow 16 year olds to vote as that gave them the best chance of success: 16 year olds are more likely to be swayed by patriotic arguments, whereas the rest of us with some life experience ask for annoying things like evidence.  My point about adults was a whinge that some adults still vote like teenagers would: only considering what they can get in the immediate term rather than looking ahead to the future. The very opposite of what we need in voters."
BritishSuccess,30t7wv,cac2008,2,Tue Mar 31 12:21:13 2015 UTC,"But if it were formative there would be some evidence that children are affected negatively. Again, I'm not arguing from a defensive position here. Is there such evidence?  I also would have thought films are rather different. The reason I was scared by scary films when I was young is because films seem so real. If I saw someone being tortured or murdered it was impossible for me to distinguish from reality (other than rationally). That is not the case with video games."
BritishSuccess,30t7wv,WhaleMeatFantasy,3,Tue Mar 31 01:43:43 2015 UTC,"GTA V has an interactive torture scene and it's pretty realistic. It's an extreme example, but GTA V sold very well, and it's easy to underestimate what gets put out. I'm a fair bit older than 18 and can't stomach that scene.   I don't have kids of my own and certainly can't tell parents what their kids can and can't do, but I'd be pretty upset if my child was exposed to something this and nobody said anything about it."
BritishSuccess,30t7wv,zmonge,3,Tue Mar 31 02:33:40 2015 UTC,But children learn about how Jesus was tortured when they are at primary school.  Why is that OK?

BritishSuccess,30t7wv,cac2008,7,Tue Mar 31 09:22:28 2015 UTC,"Your argument just seems to be based on taste, though. When I was little, if I found something scary I would stop doing it. If a child doesn't mind they will carry on.  You can't argue for something to be banned for everyone on the basis that you can't stomach it.  On the other hand, if there were some evidence to show that children who play that torture scene (or similar) are more likely to hurt a friend at school, then that puts rather a different case."
BritishSuccess,30t7wv,WhaleMeatFantasy,2,Tue Mar 31 02:41:53 2015 UTC,"I think there's still a lot of controversy on the video game violence front, really you can find evidence both ways.  You're right in saying that It doesn't make sense to ban something for everyone because I can't stomach it, which is why I mentioned that I can't make choices for other parents, it's up to them to decide where their child is developmentally and whether or not the game is appropriate for their child.  What I'm really trying to get at though is that if my child at the age of 13 or so were being exposed to such things without my knowledge, I'd appreciate it if someone like a teacher brought it up. That's not to say I'd necessarily keep the child from playing the game, but it would allow me to better determine what actions were appropriate."
BritishSuccess,30t7wv,zmonge,1 point,Tue Mar 31 02:51:32 2015 UTC,I think your points are very sensible. I'd agree with all of that and I hope most parents would too.

You're way, way overestimating the age at which you can separate reality from fiction. I was playing GTA 3 at 11 years old and the original GTA younger than that. There was never a moment when I even considered applying things in that game to real life, because I recognized it was a game and not real.  No 13 year old is going to confuse a game with reality, unless they have severe mental development issues."
BritishSuccess,30t7wv,Vancha,2,Tue Mar 31 11:13:43 2015 UTC,"Not that I'm disagreeing with you but there's a huge amount of difference between how the first GTA looks and feels and now. Current games look far more realistic and have much more complexity and interactiveness than games from the era of GTA1, so it might be logical to assume that for developing minds it is harder to differentiate acceptable attitudes.  Also other cultural cross-overs mean that gaming is not isolated from reality as much as it used to be. There never used to be brands and references to actual places and events as much in games, I'm trying to think of a games like GTA which took place in somewhere real(ish) like how GTA uses thinly disguised version of real places."
BritishSuccess,30t7wv,wheresmyacctgone,1 point,Tue Mar 31 11:39:18 2015 UTC,"Then take GTA3. It looks terrible now, but back then it looked as good as anything out there. In 15 years time, I'm sure we'll look back at GTA5 and chuckle at how artificial and unrealistic it looks and honestly, there'll probably be today's 10-13 year olds claiming that the realism of GTA9 might be indistinguishable from reality for the children of the time.  I just don't think you can get away from the disconnect of knowing what you're playing is a game. I think we'd need to get to the point of games looking, feeling, sounding and smelling the same as reality and then someone spending more time in said games than the real world before any problems actually arose from being unable to distinguish what's appropriate in reality as opposed to a game."
BritishSuccess,30t7wv,Vancha,1 point,Tue Mar 31 12:23:47 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I'm not disagreeing with you but I still think that older games were less ""real"". Not just in terms of visuals but in that they didn't replicate the real world so well. Now there are real brands used in gaming worlds and more use of real world locations in real world settings. There is also greater use of multi-media such as GTA's radio stations. In older games you'd never have heard the soundtrack outside the game, never seen adverts for the same brands in both worlds. This and companion apps on mobile devices could (but shouldn't to any well adjusted player) make it more likely that someone could use the behaviours they learnt in-game in the real world."
BritishSuccess,30t7wv,wheresmyacctgone,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:02:46 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'll take the bait... you say video games could arguably be a fairly unproductive use of time, but they are equally as ""unproductive"" as any other artistic medium. Some games are as cleverly made and emotionally affecting as great music or literature. Some are obviously pretty poor, but only as poor as bad music or literature. Unless you want to construct an argument that spending time engaging with any art is unproductive, then it would be nonsensical to single out video games in this way."
BritishSuccess,30t7wv,a_hirst,1 point,Tue Mar 31 13:55:35 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply but I wasn't arguing that point. Because this is specifically about violent games.
BritishSuccess,30t7wv,WhaleMeatFantasy,2,Tue Mar 31 14:13:46 2015 UTC,"I played GTA and other 18 rated games when I was 9 or 10 years old. Nothing wrong with me. In fact, graduated with an honours in game design last year. My early experiences with video games definitely helped craft me into the type of person to follow that industry. 13 year olds can play GTA if they want. It would be the parents responsibility to ensure the childs distinction between video games and reality are solid. Its also the parents responsibility to make sure the child is given the attention they deserve to ensure they aren't exhibiting any signs of violent behaviour or other anti-social behaviour which would be exacerbated with video games and other violent or adult media not meant for them. If the parents can't do that, then yes, maybe the kids shouldn't be playing GTA and the like.  I'm sure there are millions of children who were in the same situation as myself who played GTA and other 18+ video games as kids and turned out fine. I have friends who did and we're still very good, law abiding, mentally stable and contributing members of society. Ultimately the responsibility falls on the parents to monitor their children, just like we all had.  The same arguments could be made about violent/mysoginistic films, TV shows, music, books, websites etc which doesnt seem to get the same scrutiny as video games.  Not to mention that some games with 18 ratings probably shouldn't even have an 18 rating cos they're not even that violent or distasteful. Like CoD as an example. The multiplayer is very tame and could be played by anyone 12 and up in my opinion. Ignoring the voice chat of course. Either way, teachers should not have this kind of power. The responsibility falls to the parents or the guardians   The best part of this stupid new legislation is that it's not even illegal to play 18 games underage. Its only illegal for someone under that age to buy it from a store. So a teacher having the authority to call an officer over to a students house who plays an 18 game is going to be really pointless because there's nothing much he'll be able to do unless the law makes it illegal for children to play games with ratings above their age... Which will be near impossible to enforce."

BritishSuccess,30t7wv,fulfilledprophesy,3,Tue Mar 31 02:00:50 2015 UTC,"TL;DR - Studies show playing up to an hour a day is actually good for kids, but the content is important.  There are plenty of studies that show video games as being beneficial to development.   http://rochester.edu/news/show.php?id=3679 http://news.msu.edu/story/9971/ http://www.cell.com/current-biology/retrieve/pii/S0960982213000791?script=true http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/mp2013120a.html http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11008989/Playing-video-games-for-up-to-an-hour-a-day-is-good-for-children.html To name only 5.   There are people who ideologically hate the concept of computer games. They say kids should be 'outside playing'. We do have that: those are the hood rats hanging about on street corners. These are the people who want kids to have their upbringing. They think kids should play with wooden cars and a hoop and stick. Following their arguments is like saying 'I don't use a lighter: when I was a wee lad we bashed two flints together. Lighters is making people lazy!'.  The negative effects of computer games appear to come from two issues:   The content of the game itself The amount of time playing the game   Children who play more violent video games are more likely to have increased aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and decreased prosocial helping, according to studies (see Anderson & Bushman, 2001; Anderson & Dill, 2000; Gentile, Lynch & Walsh, 2004). This isn't clear cut however: A study at Boston suggests that experiencing violence in a virtual environment reduces it in the real world, however this could be more predicated on how the game handles violence. If it lets you experience the consequences of your actions it may increase empathy (http://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2014/06/037.html). If it just lets you kill every mo'fo in the area with no repercussions then I can see how this would lead to a twisted approach to problems, particularly in a young developing mind. For evidence of this, try and play COD online. You are surrounded by 11 year olds who think insulting everyone around them is a good thing.   The Telegraph article above links to an Oxford University study that kids who play games for an hour a day actually have boosted concentration, attention spans, reflexes etc. Those playing between 1 and 3 hours have no effect, and negative effects only started from 3 hours onwards. This is partially supported by a paper in the Journal of Psychology of Popular Media Culture (http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/ppm-1-1-62.pdf)."

Its up to the parents to decide whether their child should be playing those video games or not.  Sure a 10 year old probably shouldn't play GTA. I'm not a parent but if my 14 year old said he wanted to play any game that was an 18, I would know whether he was mature enough to play the game.  The whole idea if ridiculous,are they gonna start prosecuting parents because their 14 year old watched a film that is rated 18? No. Its a stigma against video games.

Freedom from EU rules would mean the UK could trade more with these fast-growing nations and not be so tied to its neighbours.  But another European country seems to be doing both with relative ease. Data I have extracted from the Eurostat database shows Germany’s exports to Brazil, China, India, Russia and South Africa are more than four times the value of UK exports to those countries – trade that represents a higher share of Germany’s total exports than the equivalent UK figure. Indeed, the UK even exports less than France to these countries.  Meanwhile, the UK exports more to Ireland than it does to China (twice as much in 2011 and 60% as much in 2013). Overall, about half of UK trade is with EU partners (imports and exports). And while the share has been declining recently, the absolute value of trade with European neighbours continues to rise.

BritishSuccess,30ly4b,Timothy_Claypole,2,Sat Mar 28 23:24:15 2015 UTC,We can do that but at what cost of deregulation?  By this I mean it will make our country a shit place to work. Imagine removing maternity leave. Or cutting the number of statutory holiday days. Or reducing the scope of constructive dismissal. Stuff that impacts on the quality of our working lives.  This and the fact that the EU is on our doorstep. Lower lead times for delivery and cheaper.
BritishSuccess,30ly4b,throwawaytribute1,2,Sun Mar 29 06:49:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you for a civil reply.  I would say removing the EU does not mean removing those rights, we can enact them ourselves while have 1 less layer of government to support.  The argument about lead times and delivery I don't know enough facts about (source?), but surely the low transport costs that make delivering indian/ chinese production here profitable prove it is not that much?"
BritishSuccess,30ly4b,Timothy_Claypole,3,Sun Mar 29 08:41:55 2015 UTC,"The price of us doing business with the rest of the world is that we must become a lot more competitive at some things. There is a balance. We can let businesses off the leash, as it were, and have them provide goods and services at much lower costs but at the same time it comes with a real price for our working conditions. Our productivity is not good enough to overcome this.   I am not suggesting we act like the French, but we have to consider that being part of the EU/EEA has trade benefits and we have a bunch of highly developed countries on our doorstep with whom we are going to find it tougher to sell to.  Indian/Chinese manufacturers have low production costs which we cannot compete with because we require higher wages and I dare say we are better at enforcing regulations. But I am really referring to the two-way trade with regards transport."
BritishSuccess,30ly4b,throwawaytribute1,1 point,Sun Mar 29 08:47:16 2015 UTC,I think this is where we agree to disagree.  I believe an extra layer does not remove corruption it just moves it up a level which is why I do not see the EU as neccessary for our rights.  You believe it is needed to oversee these rights and for it's trade benefits.  Everyone agree's we shouldn't be like the french.
BritishSuccess,30ly4b,Timothy_Claypole,3,Sun Mar 29 08:53:09 2015 UTC,"Hang on, not sure I mentioned about the EU giving us rights, in fact I did not mean to say anything like that.

BritishSuccess,30hary,PigeonMother,31,Fri Mar 27 16:56:48 2015 UTC,"Good morning and welcome to the Docklands Light Railway. This automated train is provided for the security and convenience of employees of the various instituions and companies. Please feel free to move about the train or simply sit back and enjoy the ride.  The time is 8:47 AM. Current topside temperature is 12 degrees Centigrade, with an estimated high of 16. London is maintained at a clement 15 degrees centigrade at all times.  This train is inbound from Lewisham to Bank. If your intended destination is a high-security area beyond Heathrow, you will need to return to Bank, take the Central line to Holborn and board the Picadilly Line. If you have not yet submitted your identity to the HM Passport Office, you must report to the HM Passport Office for processing before you will be permitted into the most painful areas of the British mass transit system.  Due to the high toxicity of material routinely handled in Central London, no smoking, eating, or drinking are permitted within the A406 ring road.  Please keep your limbs inside the train at all times. Do not attempt to open the doors until the train has come to a complete halt at the station platform. In the event of an emergency, passengers are to remain seated and await further instruction. If it is necessary to exit the train, disabled personnel should be evacuated first. Please stay away from electrified rails, and proceed to an emergency station until assistance arrives.  A reminder that the London Marathon will commence this on the 26th of April 2015. The semifinals for high-security personnel will be announced in a separate Secure Access transmission. Remember, more lives than your own may depend on your fitness.  Do you have a friend or relative who would make a valuable addition to the TFL team? Immediate openings are available in the areas of Dangerous Bus Driving and Letting People Whose Oyster Cards Don't Work Through The Gates. Please contact TFL for further information. If you have an associate with a background in the areas of theoretical physics, biotechnology or other high-tech disciplines, please don't bother them about applying, as they are probably in better paid jobs. The TFL is an Equal Opportunity Employer.  A reminder to all London employees: Regular radiation and biohazard screenings are a requirement of continued employment in the Central London. Missing a scheduled urinalysis or radiation check-up is grounds for immediate termination. If you feel you have been exposed to radioactive or other hazardous materials in the course of your duties, contact your Radiation Safety Officer immediately. Work safe, work smart. Your future depends on it.  Please stand back from the automated door and wait for the me to tell you to Mind The Gap. Before exiting the train, be sure to shove your way past the hordes trying to board. Thank you and have a very safe and productive day."

I would have been equally disappointed if they just gave him a slap on the wrist and let him off again. About time someone put him in his place."
BritishSuccess,309co6,greg225,27,Wed Mar 25 17:45:29 2015 UTC,"Why are people celebrating this? Okay, I understand, he shouldn't have punched someone, but let's look into the past.  Consistently people have been begging for him to be sacked, but why? Because he made a comment that upset you? How about the legion of other TV presenters, comedians, writers etc etc who have made similar comments?  Let me get something straight: I am not defending Clarkson for what he did. He shouldn't have done it. But it seems everyone is happy that he's gone, even if they never watched Top Gear. Imagine if someone wanted something you loved to be cancelled? How would you feel? How would you feel if you asked them if they even watched it, and they said no? Be a bit annoying, wouldn't it?  Let's take another example. I do not enjoy The Voice. Do I want The Voice to be cancelled? Not particularly. The reason being is that there are people out there that enjoy it. And don't give the stupid ""I pay a licensing fee"" excuse, because it's pretty difficult for the BBC to create things that every single person enjoys. And let's be honest, The Voice has a ton of viewers. My point is is that just because I don't enjoy something, does not mean I don't want it to be stopped.  Again, and I know people will constantly overlook this point, I am not defending Jeremy Clarkson. I'm simply saying that it's a bit ridiculous for someone to want something to be cancelled simply because they don't like it."
BritishSuccess,309co6,chiefmarnaus,17,Wed Mar 25 15:50:47 2015 UTC,"I love Top Gear. I genuinely do. I am gutted that this means the show won't go on as it has done for the past 20+ series. I love the interaction between the three presenters, I think despite being occasional idiots they are genuinely good people, I think it does brilliantly funny segments and makes me want to drive cars to have fun. I understand why other people don't like it, but that doesn't stop me liking it.  But it's ridiculous to excuse someone for assault simply because their programme is popular, and especially because a bunch of a million floppy dicks signed a fucking petition without knowing the facts. If you continually do things your employer doesn't want you to do, and they have told you not to do any more stupid things, you need to be fired. I am happy that the pressure of the ""anti-PC"" brigade hasn't been enough to force the BBC to excuse workplace bullying. I am happy that this makes a lot of morons upset. Not because I wanted Top Gear stopped."

Put a more accepting person on, someone who can actually be humorous without being a bigoted, unapologetically racist cunt. With Clarkson on there, it only gives the view that being a bigoted racist is acceptable: that is the wrong message to send.  As for the racist cunts defending him, I assure you Top Gear will continue on with different presenters.  The only reason it got so much attention before is because he intentionally stirred up drama, and thus the streisand effect attracted curious people."

BritishSuccess,309co6,TheTretheway,0,Wed Mar 25 21:11:10 2015 UTC,"The reason I am 'celebrating' it (by which I mean I'm quietly content about it) is because of what the show represents. A male-dominated, boisterous, discompassionate culture that can be quite detrimental to the 'progression' of society. You might think I am being too dramatic (well brace yourself) but I have thought this for a long time about Top Gear (and many other shows the BBC trots out).   It's not just that the comments he made are offensive, they have at different times been described as racist, sexist, ablist, homophobic, classist and on almost every occasion I would agree, it's also not an issue of freedom of speech (he is ultimately an employee of the corporation). For me it is that a lot of the people who are defending him aren't defending his right to say such things (which of course he has) but that they agree with the things he says. I have seen many of his defenders use similar slurs without the privilege of receiving money in return and to those people he is an inspiration and a validation.   It's not about whether one watches the show or not, personally i would enjoy a show about cars a lot more if it wasn't so rigidly formatted and casual bigotry wasn't a compulsory side order, but that it invades almost every pub, social gathering and work environment in the country and is a mean-spirited distraction from a unity that could benefit everyone.   I feel like the BBC has relied on Top Gear for too long and I am genuinely interested to see if it will create something that is truly brave and irreverent in its place and use its enormous influence in a positive way as opposed to placating Middle England.  Also, to those who enjoy Top Gear, it was never going to last forever. Surely this is an excellent way to go out, courting the attention and controversy it sought during its production as opposed to gradual decline in quality and output, personnel changes and eventual cancellation.  To answer your other questions, if someone wanted to cancel something I generally enjoyed then I would look at the merits of both sides and choose rationally whether it is truly worth defending."

BritishSuccess,304gh9,kendo545,71,Tue Mar 24 13:54:14 2015 UTC,"Here's a comment that turned out way longer than I thought it would...  Gavin and Stacey was fucking brilliant. There are lines, moments, and performances in that show that are going to be extremely hard to top, and while it's an ensemble programme, he and Ruth Jones wrote it and played characters that would go on to ""break out""  So the BBC found itself with a very rare thing: this ridiculously well-received and popular comedy that works as both broad entertainment and well-written comedic drama. What to do with the stars, these amazing people who just pulled this thing out of thin air and would surely make the corporation £millions in DVD sales?  Ruth Jones kept it trill - she wrote some more, did some ""serious acting"", and popped up in the occasional indie comedy, but generally stayed on the right side of credibility. Corden, though, got teamed up with Matthew Horne (i.e. Gavin) and they put out a sketch show. Actually, ""put out"" is an understatement - they wrote it and performed it, and then the BBC spent weeks hyping it up as a huge comedy phenomenon in the making. It was shit. And I don't mean ""I don't like it"", it was universally panned, nobody watched it, the BBC paid way too much for it. Then Corden started getting voice-over work for adverts, he did some presenting gigs, and suddenly he was everywhere.  The thing is, his overtly extrovert and outgoing personality is great in a sitcom where you're on a script, but in real life it's just... Annoying. Especially when he's presenting all these shows, turning up in the papers, making stupid statements, getting into fights with Picard, and generally being really full of himself. Because, of course, he's had years of people blowing smoke up his arse telling him how brilliant he is.  I don't hate him, by the way, I just think he peaked at the very start of his career, and that people have been offering him all this media work as a result of that early success, which led to overexposure, a big ego, and a public backlash.

His fans do not seem to realise he takes 3 minutes to explain what could be said in 30 seconds. He has to labour points presumably because people will not understand him unless he explains everything in very over-expressive ways just to make his point that the things he is saying may require a modicum of thought to fully grasp the situation which may be lost on people who need him to explain things yet again right after saying them in a very obvious way because without that re-emphasis right afterwards some people simply won't find the joke funny.

BritishSuccess,2zzzsr,QuinLabRat,3,Mon Mar 23 17:40:55 2015 UTC,Is there a system for who calls where? We live about 10 minutes walk from a hall and they come around a lot but growing up in another town we lived 15 minutes walk away and never saw anyone (except to family at school).
BritishSuccess,2zzzsr,Morticiagoldbunny,5,Mon Mar 23 18:30:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is a system and we know when and where we have been, but if there are only a few of us in a large area it will take a longer time between visits. Also living next to the hall makes it easier for those who don't have cars etc. so those places get taken more often. Sometimes there it is really difficult to meet people at home, or we meet other people in the household (who might not mention the visit) or we might meet someone that watches the pets whilst the people living there are away and we just assume it's their house.

No answer and they drive off  Then the car pulls up at the next window and just hands you some cash and a fist full of tokens.  So now you have to fuck about and check that they have the right tokens, the fact that it's not meals they want but individual free items so your screen is changing in the kitchen and you're fucking people around and now there's an empty box getting launched at your head by the guy on buns.

BritishSuccess,2zwrrj,Thauma,10,Sun Mar 22 21:20:00 2015 UTC,"There are many things which are different when Monopoly is run, logistically and otherwise, which if they aren't detrimental in any other way, they're just fucking confusing.   Allow me to make a list of changes which apply in different parts of the restaurant (I work in a drive thru restaurant, so the parts about kiosks are assumptions)  Kitchen (I don't do kitchen much so I probably missed something)   Before monopoly, the chicken legend had 2 separate boxes, one for the mayo legend and one for the salsa legend. Not any more. Its now a grey box and we have to press flaps on the side of the box so people on the counter know what they're picking up. Apple pies are suddenly a thing - In my restaurant, Apple pies aren't all that popular, except when monopoly is on. This means they need cooking more often. Apple pies are the longest cooking thing we have in the entire menu, taking just under 6 minutes to cook. Sometimes, this means the fryer used to cook the pies in is tied up, and in my restaurant we use the same fryer for the apple pies as the Mozzarella dippers, but only one can be cooked at a time. Items disappearing and reappearing on screen - In the kitchen we have screens which tell us items which are on order on the tills, even if they haven't been paid for yet. This means that when twats come along and don't mention until its time to pay that they have monopoly instant wins (which happens far too much), things get taken off order to then but put back on order then confusion ensues and people complain they haven't got their food yet because we thought it had already been done. The Big Tasty is back. Fuck that, it takes too long because the fact that the Tasty without isn't even a grill order is just annoying. Somebody orders a tasty. they shout ""Tasty on order"" or something to that effect. WITH OR WITHOUT BACON. We're not psychic.   Front Counter   Breakfast Changeover - According to the promo rules, we aren't meant to be giving out cups with the stickers on during breakfast. This makes life hard because then we need to find cups which don't already have stickers (As cold cups come pre-stickered) if somebody orders a cold drink, for example.  Instant win stickers - Fuck off, these are just plain annoying. Especially when customers think we're psychic and know they have them. Refer to the 3rd part of the kitchen problems for reasons why this is a problem. However, the stickers allow most staff members to, at their discretion, interpret the instant win stickers as any other instant win sticker, or anything else really. It depends where you are, but the rules say its up to the server.  Customers dumping their non-winning stickers on the counter - It's annoying, don't do it. Non-pre-stickered drinks - Some drink cups/bottles don't come pre-stickered, and as a result we have to add stickers to them ourselves. This only applies to items which have been bought as meals. For example, if somebody bought a meal with a hot drink or a bottle of water, a sticker would be applied to it, but if they bought it separately, the sticker is not provided. This can make customers annoyed because the cold drinks and iced drinks have stickers by default.  Customers wanting more stickers / Bitching they didn't get any on their non-meal drinks - See above for the reason behind this. People moan because some people will be seen with stickers on their usually sticker-less drinks, or will demand stickers on anything and everything else. Today I had a man complain because he didn't get stickers on his happy meal. It's worth mentioning that every promo poster says ""16 OR OVER"" in the corner, so obviously happy meals do not have it. Again, be nice to your server, you might just get some stickers.  It's busier - For kiosk restaurants, people HAVE to come to the till because the kiosks don't take instant wins. Yay. That's in addition to the fact its already busier than usual anyway.   Kiosks (We don't have these at mine)   You can't use instant wins on the kiosk.    Dining Area   Don't stick your useless stickers to tables/chairs/whatever. It happens too much and they're a huge pain to pick off sometimes.    Drive thru   The scenario /u/Thauma posted happens all the time. Stop doing it. Seriously. Needing to manually apply stickers slows everything down. Orders changing on the screen because of ""twats with vouchers"" slows everything down and confuses the runners.  Handing out game boards with receipts/straws/napkins slows everything down.    Employees   We're not allowed to play - This means we're meant to hunt down sticker-free cups/fries/whatever for our break, but really we can't be arsed, we like collecting game pieces as much as customers do. But we can cheat, so it's much more fun.   I think that's everything. And that's why its so damn hard."

The driver just printed me a ticket and told me to mention it to the driver when I came back so I can pay then.

You're right in saying somebody should always be there, but it just depends on the store. I work in a busy city centre Local, so there's always somebody on tills and people around to help. If the store is any bigger it becomes a lot more difficult to keep on top of the dozens of self-scans, and if the store is any smaller there's simply a smaller workforce, so less people to help out.   One thing I will say is that if you are ever left waiting for more than a few seconds, it's only because we've got a thousand other things to be doing at the same time.

BritishSuccess,2zbwnt,Fatally_Flawed,2,Tue Mar 17 19:57:57 2015 UTC,"I tried to do this (after reading about it on a different thread) a few weeks ago. I wanted to be discreet as I didn't know if I'd have any money on my card to pay for what I was buying - a 'personal' item. I wanted to quietly abandon it if the payment didn't go through.   The til I was on must have been dodgy because the volume would ONLY GO UP. I kept pressing the down arrow and it just beeped louder and louder, drawing more attention to me. Of course, the bagging area didn't recognise the item I'd scanned, so a teenage boy had to come over and help, seeing said personal item in it's lone glory on the screen and the bagging area.   And of course, my card didn't work. So the computer lady kept insisting, at the top of her voice, that I needed to INSERT CASH OR CHOOSE ANOTHER PAYMENT TYPE. I was too worried to leave it there and just go, as I knew all eyes were on me now (they weren't, but you know). I had to call the teenager back over and ask him to cancel the whole thing because I'd 'picked up the wrong bank card, silly me'. He just looked at me with a mix of curiosity and pity."

My friend duly mocked me for having a card from dinosaur times, and, when I explained my excitement over the upcoming renewal, looked at me like I was proper mental.

Well...    For many, getting the Bus is a necessity, but for a lot of people it is a choice. If you could choose between driving to work with the radio on and spending a little more money for parking etc, or spending half an hour on a dirty, noisy bus with a grumpy driver, you're going to drive. This is where my generation of drivers differs from the preceding generations. This is why I get so irate when I get issued a dirty or broken bus.    People aren't going to want to get on a bus that comes from the late 90s, regardless of how much ""life"" it's got left in it! Customers don't care how many miles the propshaft has left in it, they want a quiet, clean and efficient bus, that doesn't look like it's going to fall apart before you get to town.  I'm going to make damn sure that your journey is safe, pleasing and timely because if its not, you're not going to want to do it again. If everyone stops getting the bus, who pays my wages?    I will do my best to wait at the stop if I see anyone running, I will look out for people running a bit late to the stop, I will wait till I'm on time before leaving and do my up most not to be late. I will ALWAYS greet you with a smile, a good morning or afternoon and am happy to chat if it doesn't make the Bus late. I will answer any questions you have, will point out your destination, connection or further route and make sure you will want to willingly get on that bus again tomorrow.    Call me the next generation of Bus Driver, but surely that's all just common (business) sense?    Edit: GOLD! (gold) always believe in your soul, you've got the power to know, you're indestructible, always believe it! Thank you mysterious benefactor!"

People would have stuck up for Jimmy Savile and Rolf Harris a few years ago too, Clarkson has been at the Beeb since 1988, so I doubt he was blind to what was going on. It was commonly talked about that Savile was into ""young"" people and that people were asking about the Rolf Harris paedo rumours years ago too (and as you see from the link, there's your people sticking up for him).  If he did something that's worth firing him, fire him. If he didn't, then don't. But by fuck, Britain, stop rushing to defend people that work for the BBC because of single-issue Facebook campaigns.

Take it off him if it makes you feel better. It doesn't take anything away from me.  The whitewashing of the 70s is the pop cultural equivalent of book burning.

BritishSuccess,2xoh97,Randomd0g,5,Mon Mar 2 16:16:09 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I use to be one of those drivers when it was branded HDL, each driver is expected to make 200+ deliveries (urban areas) 150+ (rural) with on average about half of all deliveries being signed for.. Customers aren't in a lot of the time, neighbours in shity areas not ideal. No mention of safe spaces to leave items so yeah being inventive with where to hide things in plain sight is a thing.   I was agency back then and it was a commission job, x amount of packages equals x rate of pay, under x deliveries and you had problems where the cost of van hire, fuel, running costs exceed daily rate of pay. Wasn't happy that I left some expensive items in vulnerable places but in the time that I worked for them, I only had two complaints... one of which was a customer who couldn't read my writing and couldn't find his package.   When it was HDL, it was bottom tier stuff, even the royal mail would have forwarded on items because of specific council estates that it didn't want to deliver to (I'm looking at you... Weston Super-Mare).   While I understand that Yodel are basically the same, I think the unions that were in place back then damaged the reputation (hence why I was agency and not an employee), they look like in a lot of areas to still be operating under a lot of agency, self employed drivers not wanting to get involved with the union.   </previous life story>"

They recently opened a ""Primary Care 24/7"" in the building next to A&E and now send all ""blue's"" over there to be seen by a GP instead of clogging up A&E.  It's amazing how many of the people told to go there throw a fit. I heard one woman that had brought her child in for what appeared to be a common cold yelling ""If I wanted to sit and wait to see a GP, I'd have gone to my own! I came all the way here for no reason!"" The mind boggles.  Even when I'm extremely ill I will see my GP first if I can. Either by getting him out to the house, talking on the phone or visiting if I'm up to it. He'll often just call an ambulance or in the less extreme cases, give me a letter and tell my husband to take me in.   I'd rather do that though than go to A&E for no reason and waste their time."
BritishSuccess,2xgoxt,BendyZebra,2,Sat Feb 28 21:51:50 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. I'm a complicated case and my care is essentially palliative as there is no cure or treatment for it, they just do their best to firefight as things progress. Without the NHS I'd be dead for sure as I'm uninsurable and due to my disabilities, unable to work.   My husband could never afford to pay for all my meds, tube feed and related equipment and constant hospital admissions. Especially as he's a type 1 diabetic on a pump, takes protective meds for his kidneys and requires monitoring of his retinopathy and other issues. We cost a lot between us!  I have a few friends that are Doctors and all of them say that A&E is hell on earth. I respect anyone that agrees to do it, it sounds awful!   As a frequent flier with my local hospital I'm always stunned by the number of people that abuse the system and then throw a tantrum when it takes longer than just going to their GP.    Unless it's an obvious emergency (I'm at massive risk of stroke, aneurysm, arterial dissection, heart attack etc) then I always go to my GP first. I know I get special treatment even with the GP and therefore it's easier for me to get an appointment, visit or a callback but it still makes more sense to me to speak to them first!  I don't want to waste my time or anyone else's by sitting in the hospital when my GP could have dealt with my issue (especially as I have to wear a mask outside of the isolation rooms!) Plus if I do end up needing to go to the hospital, having my GP call ahead or send me with a letter means I'll be treated much faster anyway as I've essentially already been triaged!  In some cases I've arrived and been taken directly to the emergency admissions unit or directly onto the ward I need as they're expecting me and know what treatment I require. It makes the whole system run much better that way.   Glad your heart isn't too bad!! I don't blame you for taking the perks where you can, with how hard you guys work and all the shit you take for it, you deserve some special treatment when it's your turn to be in the bed!! :D   I definitely appreciate just how lucky we are to have the NHS. When I'm admitted I love to treat the staff as much as I can. There's a Morrison's next door to my local hospital and I'll send my carer or husband to buy big bags of treats so I can leave them at the nurses station.  It makes me smile to see the obviously stressed doctors and nurses swarm the desk, smiling widely and fighting like kids over who gets which lolly or whatever. I get one big bag for the day staff and one for the night staff so that it's fair.   The one time I had nobody around to fetch me the sweets, I put my mask on and went down to the in-hospital Costa to buy everyone a drink. I probably look like a suck-up but I just really appreciate how hard you guys work. I wouldn't be here without you all!  It's only something small, a sweet or a drink, but it seems to really lift the mood on a ward and I just really like to say thanks.  P.S. - I love your username!!"
BritishSuccess,2xgoxt,BendyZebra,1 point,Sat Feb 28 22:29:56 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's cool, I'm not surprised you can't figure it out from so little info. It's considered a ""rare"" disorder anyway (most likely just massively underdiagnosed though!) and I didn't give away any of symptoms that would maybe jump out at you.  As the Prof. that diagnosed me put it, I have ""severe, multi-systemic, mixed-type Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome."" I have classical, hypermobile and vascular types and I'm pretty messed up these days. I use a powered wheelchair and ceiling hoists to get around without falling apart.  Even now when I go to A&E the first question is usually ""what's Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome?"" and the few that have heard of it have no idea that there are so many types and that it can be as severe as this. I tend to find a lot of Doctor's will just take my lead as I'm classed as a ""Patient Expert"". It can be a little scary when I'm ill and have to tell everyone else what to do.  I suffer 30+ dislocations a day (including spinal ones and ribs) and even more subluxations, I've given up counting those. I don't go to the hospital for that though as the standard method for reducing a dislocation (pull!) is dangerous to me, my tendons and ligaments will snap or come away the bone. I have to manipulate them gently back into place and can mostly do them myself (or with help from my husband). Still really bloody painful though!  I have the J-tube as I have almost complete digestive tract paralysis, starting with dysphagia and going right the way through to having extremely slow, stretchy bowels that refuse to absorb most of what I take in, even with a specialist feed designed for Crohn's/IBD patients that have lost most of their small intestine.   They're not sure why the gastroparesis started, the main suspects are the kyphoscoliosis, as C5&6 decided to collapse onto my spinal cord and compress it by just under 50%, or possibly the autonomic dysfunction (I suffer with low blood pressure, orthostatic intolerance causing tachy/bradycardia, I can't control my body temp or breathing normally etc... Having digestive issues could easily be down to that!)  I have a whole bunch of crazy internal issues relating to the lack of collagen and cartilage. I'm a bit overwhelming to my local hospital and have to go to London for anything major. My heart is weak and I have issues with MVP but it's not too bad for now.  Sorry to hear about the heart block! Type 1, 2 or 3? I'm assuming it's not Type 3 as you say it's relatively mild. Glad you're doing okay with it though. I get palpitations and it feels awful, you have my sympathy!  I totally agree that everyone should see just how much they're costing each time they go to the hospital, especially if it's for something that should have been seen by a GP.  It's awful how badly medical staff are treated these days. Yes, you guys make mistakes, everyone does though, you're not infallable but you still deserve respect. I'm actually terrified of Doctors as due to my condition I've been on the receiving side of a few too many mistakes over the years. That's just because of the lack of knowledge about EDS though. I had one side of my ribcage collapsed and an artery in my wrist burst in one day because of a Doctor that didn't want to admit that he didn't know anything about EDS.   He refused to listen to me when I told him what would happen and funnily enough, it went exactly as I expected. That kind of Doctor does make me angry as I have to know every detail about what is and isn't safe to do to me or I'd be dead by now. He put me at massive risk because he refused to accept that in my situation, I may actually, genuinely know more than him because I live with this every day!  Most Doctor's are really good at holding their hands up and saying ""I don't have a clue, I'll let you guide me"". I trust a Doctor that admits to what he doesn't know far more than I trust one that tries to fake it.  I really do genuinely appreciate good Doctors though and I can even forgive the ""bad"" ones as it's a tough job and I'm a challenging case to handle.  Most of the nurses and Doctor's know me now as I'm often on the same few wards. I get greeted with hugs and ""oh no, what's wrong this time, Trouble?!"" when they see me. I also get ""so where are our sweets then?!"" with a wink and a cheeky grin.   I regularly play little pranks on the ones I know well and they prank me back. It's nice to cheer them up, whether with coffee, sweets or jokes.   Gonna have to go find the BMJ study on chocolates for staff now! I've got to read that.  Don't apologise, I'm pretty sure my messages are ten times longer! It's nice to talk to you!"

It doesn't seem to make a difference though and I'm used to the nasty looks.   It kind of makes me laugh that they resent my fast treatment. The way I see it is that if you're made to wait then you're obviously not likely to drop dead soon.

Hershey's milk chocolate of article  Hershey bar:       The Hershey Process milk chocolate used in these bars is cheaper to make than other types of chocolate as it is less sensitive to the freshness of the milk. The process was developed by Milton Hershey and was the first mass-produced chocolate in the United States. As a result, the Hershey flavor is widely recognized in the United States, but less so internationally, in particular in areas where European chocolates are more widely available. The process is a trade secret, but experts speculate that the milk is partially lipolyzed, producing butyric acid, which stabilizes the milk from further fermentation. This compound gives the product a particular sour, ""tangy"" taste, to which the US public has become accustomed, to the point that other manufacturers often add butyric acid to their milk chocolates.  The American bar's taste profile was not as popular with the Canadian public, leading Hershey to introduce a reformulated Canadian bar in 1983.  The company describes the revised Canadian formulation as a ""creamier, smoother, lighter coloured and milder flavoured product more suitable to Canadian taste"". Butyric acid is a component which provides the characteristic smell of human vomit,  and many Europeans describe the taste of Hershey bars as reminding them of vomit, even if they do not know the underlying chemistry.

BritishSuccess,2w78mq,JDRaitt,37,Tue Feb 17 15:42:43 2015 UTC,"Ditto the fact our tanks are fitted with kettles as a requirement. Apparently in Afghanistan US solders were jealous of the fact that while they sat shivering in their tanks, British soldiers were having hot tea. But as standard when making a brew, we were more than happy to share with them.  Edit: while researching this fact I found some other cool tea related military facts:    During World War II, Britain shipped, by weight, more tea to her troops than anything save bullets. In 1942 the Luftwaffe decided that, deprived of tea, the British Empire would pretty much grind to a halt. They therefore decided to bomb Mincing Lane - center of all British and Imperial tea trading - flat. It worked too. The tea industry was sent into chaos and tea was rationed to two ounces a week - which is very very little. From a morale point of view it was one of the most successful bombing strategies of the war. In response to shortage fears, in 1942 the British decided to buy the tea. As in all of it. In the world. That's right: in 1942, to fuel her soldiers, sailors, and airmen, Britannia bought the entire world crop of tea - and it was as vital to her armies as bullets and tanks. On D-Day, the British troops started to make tea on Sword Beach almost as soon as they landed, even though they were still under fire. Later, after the beaches were taken and troops started to move inland, the Americans got upset over reports that the British stopped advancing to make tea,   I could go on but I'd be here all night, more here:  http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TeaAndTeaCulture"

They could go faster, but this increases the fuel costs, and I suspect they collect more passengers by running slow, I dunno. The line isn't busy.  It reminds me that once I was on the ferry from Le Havre to Plymouth (as it happens), a night crossing, I stepped out the back, sorry, the stern, to watch the harbour disappear, we were powering away on two propellers. Then a little way out, one of the propellers stopped, and I reckoned we were about half speed. Puzzled, and assuming a mechanical problem, I called out to one of the engineers and asked why. He said if we went too quick we'd arrive too early. The customs office wouldn't be open and we'd have to wait on the ferry.  I wasn't convinced by this argument, but it was evident we could make the crossing in half the time, or maybe two thirds. The twats."

The line between Exeter and Waterloo is single track towards the west, so you can't run at a decent speed and end up stopping a lot to allow trains to go through. Or, if it's a First Great Western train that got diverted, you end up stuck behind a stopping south west trains... train.  In OP's case the normal line between Taunton/Exeter was closed I think, so they had to divert via Yeovil and Honiton  That said, diversion routes are always nice, that's why the government is finally beginning to listen to the people that have been saying that Plymouth needs two lines to London for years - but only after the only line was put out of action for 3 months"

It won't happen, far too costly. The route uses a couple of tunnels near Longdown that I suspect would need substantial overhauls. They're good for mushrooms though.  Another proposal was to extend the Exeter to Okehampton line to Plymouth via Tavistock. Thereafter via either Bere Alston or Yelverton. It won't happen either, the cost would be astronomical, for a ""backup"" line. Great cycle routes mind."

My usual postie and a couple of the regular delivery guys know that I'm basically always home unless I'm at the hospital but the rest of them don't even try.  It still stuns me when I watch them jump out of their van, ""sorry, you weren't home"" card pre-written in their hand. They make no attempt to actually retrieve anything from the van or bring the package to the door. They just stroll up, card in hand, ready to shove it through the door and run before you notice.  I take great pleasure in getting to the door first so that they arrive to see me sat there in my wheelchair, door open, clearly awaiting the package.  The look of sheer panic as I politely question where my package is just warms my heart. I'm far too lazy to actually complain every time (although I will for repeat offenders) but when I ask for their name you can see them shitting themselves. Lazy bastards.  Sometimes I mix it up for fun and open the door as they're putting the card through my letterbox. That's even more fun to be honest as they instantly know they've been caught and they can't make any excuse about ""I was just checking if you were in before lugging the package up the drive..."""

Taking an example that does work, such as the passive aggressive charms of ""congratu-fucking-lations"" - what we can see here is the base word is 5 syllables, which is a minimum.

BritishSuccess,2v6h7g,incachu,10,Sun Feb 8 09:21:46 2015 UTC,English UK should be the default and only keyboard if you purchase your phone in the UK as the region and keyboard settings will all be set to UK.
BritishSuccess,2v6h7g,DearMrSupercomputer,1 point,Sun Feb 8 17:21:49 2015 UTC,"Buy a Macbook and you'll find that they always  have a US keyboard. Worse still, keys like # are hidden and you have to fucking google their locations if you need them.  ""#"" is Alt-3 in case you're wondering. Good luck memorising the others, Mac users"
BritishSuccess,2v6h7g,EpicFishFingers,3,Sun Feb 8 22:17:26 2015 UTC,"This isn't true. There's a difference between a British English Apple keyboard and a US English Apple keyboard. US keyboards don't have a £ key.  It took me about a week to get used to alt+3 for # and I'm a programmer so I use a lot of #s. It's also clearly displayed next to the £ symbol so I wouldn't call it hidden. What else do I need to a memorise? I'm also able to use characters like é and à very easily, compared to PCs which require you to memorise alt+nnnn codes."
BritishSuccess,2v6h7g,DearMrSupercomputer,1 point,Mon Feb 9 00:13:41 2015 UTC,"The entire keyboard design does my head in. I've never seen the # displayed on any macbook keyboard, but I'll take your word for it that it is on yours.  @ is swapped with “. There isn't an indent on the caps lock key so it's easy to accidentally hit. The backspace and enter keys are undersized, as are the arrow keys, and as I don't have a macbook for experimenting, I don't know what alt + the other numbers do. Maybe you'll find some long-lost keys :p  It's a decent size for a 13"" laptop, apple haven't wasted space at the sides of the keyboard, but that and simply adding a £ key to the UK version doesn't make up for deliberately straying from the standard keyboard design to make it a pain in the arse whenever you have to use any other laptop and you forget where the keys are.  The standard defence I hear is that you get used to it, but I never hear any legitimate reasons for moving the keys around in the first place. For enough if you need to oust a line to make the small keyboard usable, but why hide the # key instead of, say, that button to the left of the 1 key? Or why make the capslock button so large and the enter and backspace so small?  Given apple's reputation I suppose I should just be glad they didn't go full hipster and use the Dvorak setup, but still, I believe their current keyboard is sub-par  I should add that while French accent letters are hard on windows keyboards, many programs exist that allow you to simply rebind your keys for such niche uses (we are still talking about UK keyboards, right?), and most of those programs inherently won't be for mac users."
BritishSuccess,2v6h7g,EpicFishFingers,1 point,Tue Feb 10 19:35:57 2015 UTC,"I believe the keyboard design comes from the early days of Apple and they haven't seen a real reason to switch to the IBM/Windows layout. If you don't see an equally-sized # symbol next to the £ symbol then you must have an older MacBook. I checked my 2010 MBP and it's missing the # symbol, so I'll give you that one. They should definitely have placed it there all along. My 2013(14?) model has the symbol as prominently displayed as the £ symbol.  Having used both layouts I can easily switch mental modes between the two so I don't personally have an issue, but I can understand your trouble if you don't use both regularly. However I actually prefer having the pound symbol on the 3 rather than next to the enter key, especially when you need to use it frequently.  I've spent a lot of time in the U.S. so I'm used to the Windows U.S. layout as well, and maybe that's why I don't have an issue with my MacBook, although I know I'm not representative of the majority of the British population.   Holding alt and pressing alphanumeric keys gives you all sorts of symbols, and adding shift in the mix gives even more. It's really convenient for all sorts of foreign language characters, but if you need those frequently on Windows I suppose you can use third-party programs. Horses for courses I guess. My favourite is being able to use “proper quotation marks”, or perhaps an ellipsis… (alt + ;). This helps when doing design work."

BritishSuccess,2uv3yh,Jestar342,19,Fri Feb 6 16:02:40 2015 UTC,"There are various people at harm, most notably people who cannot vaccinate for other health reasons like being allergic or having a weakened immune system. Everyone being vaccinated creates what is called Herd Immunity, which means that those who cannot vaccinate are kept safe. Vaccinations are also not perfect, and so you may still be at risk even if you've had them done. If everyone is vaccinated this reduces the risk that you'll even come into contact with the virus, and so the chance of getting it is even more remote."
BritishSuccess,2uv3yh,BCMM,6,Thu Feb 5 13:46:19 2015 UTC,"to follow on this, to my understanding, the more people that get infected with a disease also means that there are more chances for these disease to mutate, which would make already existing vaccines ineffective."

BritishSuccess,2uv3yh,wwesmudge,4,Thu Feb 5 13:48:38 2015 UTC,"Not everybody can be vaccinated (immunocompromised people, people with allergies to ingredients used in the production of the vaccine, etc.), and not everybody who is vaccinated develops full immunity.  When a disease is introduced in to a region that was previously free of it, one of two things happens:   Each infected person infects an average of more than one other person before they die/get better. The number of infected people grows exponentially. Each infected person infects an average of less than one other person before they die/get better. The number of infected people decreases until the region is disease-free again.   So, the way to prevent epidemics happening is to reduce the number of susceptible people an infected person has contact with. You can simply reduce the number of people an infected person meets; closing schools and so on helps, but is obviously undesirable; quarantining might help if the disease is easy to detect. Or you can reduce the number of people that are susceptible, using vaccination.  In practice, there are a number of factors out of the control of health authorities, like how many people an average person meets each day and how likely they are to transmit the disease if one of those people is susceptible to it. One can estimate a threshold of people that must be immune in order ensure that situation 2. prevails, and for some diseases, that allows some margin for the people who can't be made immune, but doesn't allow a great deal more.  When there are enough vaccinated people around to bring about situation 2, the unvaccinated/ineffectively vaccinated are protected by ""herd immunity"" - they are highly unlikely to to exposed to the disease. If an anti-vaccination campaign take the number of non-immune people over that threshold, it can cause an outbreak that affects people who did not choose to avoid vaccination. Outbreaks due to vaccine refusal have actually actually happened; even in countries with high levels of vaccination, because anti-vaccination parents tend to exist in clusters, causing situations where a single school in an otherwise sensible city is above the threshold."

BritishSuccess,2uk1sp,ohshititsthefuzz,18,Mon Feb 2 22:23:10 2015 UTC,"I prefer Rington's Traditional teabags. Each bag makes two cups (when using a teapot of course, brewing the bag in a cup and then using it again is heinous!) and it's delivered to your door by a friendly driver!   I was gutted when my old driver retired, he was such a sweetheart. The new one is nice too but I don't quite know him well enough yet :(   I enjoy it when they turn up in their pretty van's carrying a wicker basket full of different types of tea, biscuits, chutney, jam, etc, etc. and they've been around for a long time!  The original deliveries were via horse and cart! (as shown in the search above.)  I pay £3.24 for 100 tea bags which equals 200 beautiful cups of tea. I'm never going back to buying from the supermarket.  I can order online from a huge selection or just take my ""usual"" when they arrive on my doorstep (plus anything else in the basket that looks good, I often end up with a pack of their ginger snaps) and I can either pay online or pay by cash or card at the door.  If you don't have any cash or your card on hand then they just smile and tell you not to worry, you can pay it next time. It's nice to be trusted, I can't think of any modern companies that have customer service that rivals my Rington's driver!  I sound like an advert for them but I'm disabled and housebound so having a familiar person knock on my door to bring me tea and biscuits along with a friendly chat and a genuine smile is pure heaven. I'm pathetic, I know.  TL:DR - Screw all your tea suggestions, nothing beats a delivery from Rington's!"

The drivers are all amazing too, they've been known to notice that a regular isn't answering when it seems they should be home.

It's not like the edits are terrible or anything, but if you can it's worth getting the full experience elsewhere at some point."

BritishSuccess,2txxyt,military_history,2,Thu Jan 29 18:59:27 2015 UTC,"It was great! We had a core course in First Year along with regular history modules--I did Early Medieval Europe, the US from 1750-1880, the Hundred Years' War and a wild module on International Relations. From Second Year on there were dedicated War Studies modules--I did armoured warfare, armies in WWI, the British Army in WWII, Early Modern war and state formation, the Falklands War and the British Army and the Empire. The dissertation was 15,000 words and I did mine on the Battle of Aubers Ridge, 9 May 1915.  It was very academic and definitely had a 'war and society' approach--some people were disappointed that there was too much talk of states, societies and culture and not enough strategy, tactics and weapons, though there was plenty of that in my opinion. I have heard at Wolverhampton they do actual wargames which I am definitely a bit jealous of! What's the course like at Salford?"
BritishSuccess,2txxyt,M35Mako,3,Sat Jan 31 00:54:06 2015 UTC,"Similarly, pretty awesome! I had a few core modules on general international history, covering the French revolution up to the start of the Second World War, which focused more on diplomacy and how nations interacted. The meat of the course was a bit more detailed, I did armoured warfare too, as well as a module each on sea power and air power, which were both very interesting. I also did a module on the Spanish Civil War which was pretty great, as well as a module on SOE and the British assistance to the European resistance movements during the Second World War. I also did one on British counter insurgency campaigns since 1945, and we even covered the current war in Afghanistan even though it is still ongoing.   I did my dissertation on the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, but mine was only 12,000 words if I remember correctly. My main interest is naval history, so I really enjoyed doing that."

BritishSuccess,2ttpxq,intj_gay,24,Tue Jan 27 10:27:44 2015 UTC,Why does Hershey chocolate taste of grittiness and vomit?  That wasn't a setup for a joke. It tastes like grit and has a taste like bile. There must be a reason.
BritishSuccess,2ttpxq,Jackpot777,17,Tue Jan 27 11:45:02 2015 UTC,"From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hershey_bar#Hershey.27s_milk_chocolate:   The Hershey Process milk chocolate used in these bars is cheaper to make than other types of chocolate as it is less sensitive to the freshness of the milk. The process was developed by Milton Hershey and was the first mass-produced chocolate in the United States. As a result, the Hershey flavor is widely recognized in the United States, but less so internationally, in particular in areas where European chocolates are more widely available. The process is a trade secret, but experts speculate that the milk is partially lipolyzed, producing butyric acid, which stabilizes the milk from further fermentation. This compound gives the product a particular sour, ""tangy"" taste, to which the US public has become accustomed, to the point that other manufacturers often add butyric acid to their milk chocolates.   I think because the US is bigger, so it takes longer to transport things from where they're produced to where they're consumed, so they needed food that was less quick to go off, or at least less noticeable once it had gone off."

BritishSuccess,2ttpxq,starlinguk,0,Tue Jan 27 12:29:00 2015 UTC,"It's actually because of tradition.  Chocolate in America was originally made by Quakers, because they were the ones exempt from war time service. However they didn't believe in/use electricity, so the milk they stored to use in the chocolate making process always started to go off.  This gave it that sour icky taste, however wartime Americans were appreciative of any indulgent pleasures they could get, understandably, so they loved it.  At a later point, when the factories were being run using electric, the milk was no longer sour and Americans actually complained about the change in taste of their chocolate, so to keep the customers happy the manufacturers used good milk but added a sour component to make it taste off, to give the same flavour.    I can't find a link to back me up on this, but if you search Quakers and chocolate you'll see all the famous chocolate names are actually Quaker family names, British chocolate too, but we have shitty enough weather that our milk doesn't go off it you keep it outside..."
BritishSuccess,2ttpxq,APacman,11,Tue Jan 27 11:52:18 2015 UTC,"Quakers have no problem with Electricity. The reason Quakers were so involved in the chocolate industry was that chocolate was seen as a alternative indulgence to alcohol, but without the social harms."

I've never heard this (grew up around some Quakers/Friends), and a quick Google leads me to examples such as Peter Collinson (botanist ""with a keen interest in electricity"", 18th century) and the electricity companies founded by Merz (father and son) in the 19th / 20th centuries, so of the relevant and earlier periods.  Are you perhaps thinking of the Amish, or maybe the Mennonites? (I don't know Mennonite history or when they adopted electricity). Hershey was raised in a Mennonite family.

Me, I just wait for the next bus if I see a full one, and it's always sparsely populated. Plenty of room to lean back seats. But no fun for the people on the full ones!"

If you wish to mention the Queen specifically, I'd point to her feasting with the Bahraini royals as they massacred protestors, and her ""impartial"" comments on Scottish independence and Turkey joining the EU.  Lastly - what's wrong? I would argue that not being able to hold our head of state to the fire of the people via election (I'd have no issue if she wanted to run for head of state) or the enormous amount of money spent on someone who ""has no power"" - many times more than actual presidents with power.

You're all for pragmatism, I presume, so here's the pragmatic view:  She's chosen by Parliament, through the Acts of Succession which are able to change at the whim of Parliament, a democratically elected body chosen by the people of the UK. If Parliament wanted to be rid of her, all they need to do is change the Acts of Succession to have an elected King, and then change the name to President. They won't. Why? Because people either don't want it, or don't care about it. Either way, there aren't any votes in it, and so it's simply not something that needs to change."
BritishSuccess,2tmbvu,Lebagel,1 point,Sun Jan 25 22:47:49 2015 UTC,"I assume you are referring to the Act of Settlement...  The reason I say she is elected by God, is because her family is the chosen family to be the subject of the Act of Settlement, which was put together because the royal was made head of the state religion. Obviously everyone knows this was just to oust Catholics from succession, but I'm just looking at the facts in order to show how stupid the whole thing is.  Saying she is elected by parliament is another way of looking at it, but not a particularity sensible one in the context of this particular discussion - there is a law that says they are elected in such a way, and to change that would be to change the law, which you correct to say parliament (meeting certain conditions) could do. This is exactly what republicans want to happen.

I'm not saying she was elected (no one sane would claim that), I'm saying we have the power to democratically remove her with our current establishment (i.e., no need for a revolution), but we haven't. You can go about looking for arcane biblical and societal references in many of our Laws – it comes with the territory of being a thousand year old country, but ultimately it doesn't really matter.

To suggest that parliament could change the rules on the royals is just a ""what if"" and is worth very little.

It seems like my argument was exactly how I wrote it: That the main function of a sitting monarch is to provide continuity of various governments irrespective of party leaning, and whose only powers come from democratic institutions/the constitutional rules we allow that monarch to have. And that state of affairs only exists because it was a decision arrived at democratically.  Therefore statements like ""she is a symbol of anti-democracy"" are at once ignorant - since the role of the monarch facilitates democracy and mitigates against actual tyranny (such as that currently seen in Putin's Russia), and meaningless - as if the role of the monarch in British government is anti-democracy, then so is every other position not subject to election - such as the appointed senior civil servants and policy advisors whose work actually actually affects our lives.

An elected mitigation against tyranny would be much more democratic.   Is that right? What was the last law the queen passed?   She passes all the laws. They need royal assent.    What was the last tax she levied?   5p plastic bag tax?

I don't much like her son's commitment to homeopathy though, it's a shame I can't vote against the meddlesome quack in the upcoming royal assent to the throne.   Fun game, that.

BritishSuccess,2sx9s7,dronebox,15,Mon Jan 19 10:27:40 2015 UTC,"I did mine a few weeks ago and they owed me. Not only that, but the money was in my account within one week of submitting the form!  Needless to say, the money isn't going anywhere for at least 10 years until they decide if they want it back."
BritishSuccess,2sx9s7,ClintRenee,5,Mon Jan 19 11:03:42 2015 UTC,"They'll find a way... It wouldn't surprise me to find that they have some clandestine recovery department, the sole purpose of which is to slowly claw back tax refunds"
BritishSuccess,2sx9s7,g0_west,10,Mon Jan 19 11:07:55 2015 UTC,"I've always thought HMRC are very fair actually. They try to take the appropriate amount and always give rebates without hassle. Sometimes they even send you a letter out of the blue saying ""we owe you £x, here you go [insert cheque]"" which is nice."
BritishSuccess,2sx9s7,vzzzbux,2,Mon Jan 19 11:26:12 2015 UTC,"I just got one saying that I owe them a fairly small amount of income tax (not sure why as I was on PAYE at the time).   They claim that they sent me a notice before but I don't remember it. At least this reminder had a very polite tone and gives me about a month to pay.  Unfortunately, the only payment method they seem to want is a cheque, so this marks the first time I've ever had to write one  When it was the other way around, they were quick enough to issue a refund (although I did ask rather than wait to see if one would come) and a cheque"
BritishSuccess,2sx9s7,ClintRenee,2,Mon Jan 19 12:02:40 2015 UTC,"Every letter they've sent me has had a giro slip, as well as bank transfer information so I can do it all online. Do you no have that info on the back of the letter?  I don't even own a chequebook..."
BritishSuccess,2sx9s7,vzzzbux,4,Mon Jan 19 12:04:06 2015 UTC,"Nope, it even says something like ""the payment options we accept are..."" and just cheque/postal order/bank draft  https://www.gov.uk/tax-overpayments-and-underpayments says basically the same thing as my letter  Fortunately I did opt to get a chequebook when I opened my account, not that I intended to use it. Still had to google how to write one and I'm not 100% sure I've done it correctly  It's not a huge sum of money so maybe that's why I don't get more options? It would ordinarily be taken out of PAYE but I'm not in employment right now so they're making me pay them now"
BritishSuccess,2sx9s7,fsv,1 point,Mon Jan 19 12:05:37 2015 UTC,Are you a higher rate tax payer?  A small amount of bank interest might be the cause of this.  I pay higher rate and you have to make up the difference between standard and higher.  You can pay by bank transfer or debit/credit card and it goes through within a few days.
BritishSuccess,2sx9s7,vzzzbux,1 point,Mon Jan 19 19:58:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. My former employer did totally screw up the payroll system (corporate manoeuvering and transferring us from one ltd company to another) and some people got told they were earning 2x their salary as HMRC had both companies as employers in their system, so they were going to take several zillion pounds in tax) so it may be something to do with that.  The P800 thing doesn't really explain it. If you mean bank interest as in my own bank account, I think the bank already subtracts tax when they credit the interest."

BritishSuccess,2sx9s7,Richeh,2,Mon Jan 19 14:49:05 2015 UTC,Now all you have to do is repeat that for 5 years or so and they will give up making you do self assessments. That's how it worked for me. I think they got bored of finding out that my P60 really was the full story.

BritishSuccess,2sx9s7,LykkeStrom,3,Mon Jan 19 15:59:39 2015 UTC,"Nah, they wouldn't go after you for 40p.  They'd probably go after you for 40p + £100 late paying fine + £10 per day + 15% compound interest though."
