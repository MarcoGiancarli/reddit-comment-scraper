I had a similar situation earlier in the game and explained this to him, I would be more than be willing to let him free as long as he repayed me for my troubles.  Needless to say the Russian diplomats refused my advances.  Rather than destroying them militarily, this led to a fallout between our two (maybe only one) great nations.  Now that the Russians broke free from my sphere of protection, they have to face the consequences for his actions.

The battles can be extremely fun, I've been doing them for pretty much 2 years straight and still look forward to every Tuesday and Friday. We'll always have room for line infantry, we have plenty of members and leaders to ensure that everyone gets a chance to play what they want.

We have formed the great Triumvirate consisting now of the Ottoman Empire, the Russian Empire, and the newly formed Scandinavian Empire(Under Bobu(Fuck you Kiddeee)).    Porpaps, Savior of the Orthodox faith."

RedditBrigade,3ab04l,SergioSF,2,Thu Jun 18 21:27:51 2015 UTC,"The only reason I can think of this ever happening is if you don't have it in your inventory. You have to have an ammunition container (round or canister) in your inventory for this to work. You only get one each time you take from the box. Are you doing all of these things? It's also possible that your inventory is somehow full when you take a container, so then you can't get it and thus it doesn't work."
