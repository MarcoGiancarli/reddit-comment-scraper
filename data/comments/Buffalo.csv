Most everyone knows of the same ones here:  CoWork Buffalo is on Main Street in the Theater district.  Good rates, the WiFi is fast, and the people seem pretty awesome.  The people there seemed to be a bit more of the coworking people I've met in the past (I've done co-working in about 3 cities so far).  It's not overly large, so I feel that if you worked there, you would meet everyone rather quickly.  DIG is also available.  It's located right next to 43 North which gives it a bit more polished/business-y feel.  (think more business casual vs. jeans + t-shirts)  The space itself is rather large (they've got some serious event hosting capabilities).  They've got some funky architecture things going on which probably make it more intimate than it feels from first glance.  Given their location next to a tech incubator, there is a bit more emphasis on business aspects.  The prices between the two are pretty competitive.  I've only spent time in CoWork buffalo so far (time constraints), so keep that in mind.  Im not sure exactly what you're looking for in a space, but I think between the two of those, you could do quite well."

Just on my street, those who own their homes are the folks I consider great neighbors. They take care of their property and the neighborhood as a whole. Stop and say hello when they're walking by. Even a muslim family who offered us home made traditional meals during ramadan.  Conversly, those who are renters in the same neightborhood have been a split of about 30/70, not in favor of good neighbors. YMMV, I have had great neighbors who have been renters to.

I also lived in Clarence, the neighbors were all nice and professional, but they would allow their kids to take over the streets like it was a playground and they felt that they were parenting by putting up removable signs that warned of ""Children at play"".  Of course these are the same people who voted against putting a hockey and tennis courts in the area but instead voted for a worthless gazebo.  Also lived in the Town of Lockport near the Amherst border, very nice but if you ever have a family and move out to Pendleton (The Clarence of Niagara County) keep in mind it's a small town, so everyone knows your shit.

Buffalo,3e1me3,Eudaimonics,3,Tue Jul 21 16:17:54 2015 UTC,"That's your only complaint? It mentions the Yahoo call center about a story on Buffalo's resurgence. The article uses one stat- unemployment rate.  This is one of the worst ""buffalo's new life"" stories written yet.   Hate to be the badguy, but let's get real: one new plant and a wind farm that's been there for half a decade or more, isn't going to change Buffalo's problems one single bit. The roads still suck, the government is still corrupt, the schools are terrible and the crime is high. You think people will gladly move to raise a family in that?   This is just a good start, a flicker. But soooooo much more is necessary"
Buffalo,3e1me3,ReverendBass,7,Tue Jul 21 14:12:42 2015 UTC,"There is so much more going on than a Yahoo! Datacenter (Not call center), and a wind farm.

IBM AI Research Division 43North Z80 Labs SolarCity Medical Campus expansion Myriad downtown construction projects etc etc etc   I didn't even name everything, just the first ones that come to mind, because I already see them happening daily on my commute."
Buffalo,3e1me3,SoBuffaloRes,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:19:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have looked. But you need to look a little deeper, because you will realize that this is still the same Buffalo. The poverty rate is up, most jobs remain in retail and bill collecting. Are those signs of a city turning a new leaf?   The Buffalo Billion hasn't done jack shit for anyone but rich white people. The East Side hasn't gotten a dime. The West Side, under its own resurgence that has zero to do with government or Buffalo Billion, hasn't gotten a dime. Buffalo has been so depressed, so damaged psychology, that 4 construction cranes equals a resurgence. But in reality, the schools still suck, crime is still high, the infrastructure is still broken, and the government is still corrupt. This isn't a place people move to and start a family. And none of the aforementioned businesses will help fix those problems. Buffalo is doing better, but you can't cite an employment rate and three large construction projects as a signal that Buffalo is turning around. There's zero proof of that, and in fact, there's more proof that it's the same Buffalo, just with 10 new flashy companies that were HEAVILY subsidized on the public dime. The richest god damn family in Buffalo can't even build a new headquarters without getting millions in public rebates. It's absolutely ridiculous. That NYtimes story was horrible.  The Medical campus expansion isn't creating that many new jobs. It's rearranging jobs that already exist. And they are trying to chase out poor black people from a housing development. The medical campus says it is creating about 12,000 new jobs. But the truth is there’s only about 1,000 net new jobs. That's a drop in the bucket for just about any other city in the US."

It might be slow growth but I think in the next few years we'll be seeing some real growth. A lot of people my age (20s) are excited about what happening here. Parents used to tell their kids to move somewhere better. Now kids are coming back to stay after college. There's been a huge psychological shift in the younger generation.

The new Northland Avenue industrial park and the new training center located right in the heart of the Eastside will do a lot for the area.  Then you have Larkinville, Central Park Plaza, and the continued development of the near Eastside.  The mayor is already talking about rent freezes and mixed income developments to ensure residents can still afford to live there if they choose. Many of the residential projects near the Medical Campus are mixed income.  Buffalo didn't decline in a day, and it wont recover in a day either. Right now we are seeing some real initial signs of a resurgence. Actual population growth in the Metropolitan Area is a good sign, despite being only a trickle at this point."

Buffalo is doing better, but you can't cite an employment rate and three large construction projects as a signal that Buffalo is turning around   As I stated before, there's more than 3 large projects and low unemployment numbers.  There's also regional population stabilizing.  Younger demographics are improving.  Many high-tech firms are setting up shop here (Yahoo, SolarCity, et al), and many other high-tech firms are expanding shop here.  We have myriad tech startups creating new industries as well.

Buffalo,3e1me3,SoBuffaloRes,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:05:18 2015 UTC,The Med Campus can either be considered the near East side or an extension of Downtown into the near East side.
Buffalo,3e1me3,Eudaimonics,4,Wed Jul 22 06:16:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, but what about the historic tax credits which has been the single most noticeable program that has done Buffalo the most good?  At this rate there won't be any abandoned buildings at all downtown within the next 10 years at the rate buildings are being rehabbed.   Not just downtown either, individual home owners are taking advantage of these credits where ever they can.  What about Larkin? What about the Richardson Olmsted Complex? The Central Park Plaza Project? AM&As?  What about the fact that Buffalo is one of the fastest growing markets in the country in terms of real estate appreciation?  What about the resurgence of Amherst, Grant and Niagara Streets?  There is a lot more going on that was never mentioned in the article. There is a lot of investment being made that never makes it to the first page.  Most of the current economic redevelopment programs have barely gotten off the ground and our economic sector is already getting pretty strong looking at job growth and unemployment rates.  Buffalo didn't fall in a day, and its resurgence wont happen in a day either. If the government started these long term programs for economic redevelopment earlier, maybe it would be more apparent today.  However, Buffalo's resurgence is all around us in small ways. Its not hard to see. It may be in its infancy, but we are off to a good start.  Of course Buffalo has problems. Violent crime is actually down though. Poverty is up, but Buffalo also has a lot of college kids and seniors so that might not mean anything serious.  Schools are poor, but BPS actually rank higher than NYC's (not by much mind you). If NYC cannot solve its failing school problem, what makes you think Buffalo would just be able to solve these things at a flick of a switch?  Crime, Poverty, Schools. Everyone knows Buffalo has these problems. They are not anything new and they are problems most cities have to grapple with."
Buffalo,3e1me3,Eudaimonics,0,Tue Jul 21 16:32:46 2015 UTC,"Larkin: great project. It has spurred some small growth in that area. But it is still depressed there. Baby steps can sometimes lead to big changes, and this is one example of one project having bigger spinoff effect. There's a distillery and an upgraded brewery out there, too and the new restaurant. All good. I like it. I already mentioned the resurgence on the West Side. Duly noted.  But again: poverty is rising, crime is bad, the schools are still horrible--these are all barometers that real people, real families, use when making life decisions. You don't measure your economy by the unemployment rate and job growth without the other indicators that provide the necessary context. for example, outside of construction (temp jobs), buffalo's biggest job growth is in bill collecting and retail. Good jobs? Do you consider those good jobs? That's context and serious indicators for the health of the economy. I never disagreed that Buffalo is doing better, and I am not arguing with anyone who says it's doing better than what I am describing. But I am offering some context that seems to be ignored by these articles and some who post here. That's all."

The only information my uncle was able to provide me is that he’s buried in a cemetery near some railroad tracks in Tonawanda. It’s likely small and no longer in use. His headstone apparently has some German inscribed on it.   Sounds like his grave may be in the Frieden's Cemetery: http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gsr&GScid=64593  Frienden's Congregation was the larger german congregation in North Tonawanda, and located their cemetery there.

My great grandfather was president of the Buffalo Steel Company, which hasn’t been in existence for many years. My uncle was in the area 20-25 years ago and had trouble finding anyone even at that time that remembered it. He says that the property/building is currently a recycling center, but I’m not sure if that’s still the case. It would be nice to see if there’s any original structures related to the company, and to see how it looks today.   Buffalo Steel Company is now Klein Steel Buffalo, and yes, they do some recycling, but mostly deals in cut steel.  http://www.buffalosteel.net/"

Elmwood definitely felt like it was a hidden treasure at the time - this amazing rare street that other cities didn't really get to experience.  I walked it every day from home to school and back. Here are some random memories I have of Elmwood in the 90s: *The old building where Spot is now was a cool little bookstore. I can't remember the name.  *There was a weird little Chinese restaurant where Bureau is now.  *There was a great old world shoe repair place I think in the Wasabi building.... the guy was an old cowboy type and told great stories. I used to stop in there walking home from high school just to kill time and chat.  *The old Lexington Coop on Lexington Ave was a tiny cramped place full of hippies and patchouli.  * where the coop currently is was an old bank building converted into a store that sold cool house furnishings.  * where Mezza is now used to be an old school ice cream parlor, complete with a long bar and soda machines.  * I think I encountered Eric Starchild first in 1996 and I bought a bracelet for my girlfriend.  * here's something most people don't remember. All of the buildings on Elmwood, from like Delavan to Forest had a blue neon stripe along its roofline, creating an uninterrupted blue glow on the street at night. Most of them are gone now since owners have remodeled, but a few buildings still have them.  Where Globe Market is now was just an empty minipark where there would be drum circles and people selling homemade jewelry."

It'll make exploring further away from town very easy (the parkway can be busy, hot and annoying in a vehicle), though it is a very walkable town.   Any season is good to visit in. Buy booze at duty free to drink at room or make cold drinks to put into a pack.  That is IF you want boozy drinks.     Bed & breakfasts are best imo. There's one by the golf course that is probably one of the best to stay at, iirc lakewinds. Queens landing is nice, also prince of Wales hotel; they're more expensive than the B&Bs.    Old Fort George is great to tour. Definitely Vineyard Estates; Jackson triggs is my favorite. Trius is good. Stratus. Naval hall is a neat museum.       Jet boat tour is okay, not really part of the allure of NOL.     If you want to have a drink on the water the golf course has the only real waterfront bar.     Shaw theaters for shows.     Queenston park is a cool place to explore, you can go up inside the statue, it's quite a sight up there.     The cork, harp & old angel Inn are great places to have a drink.  The old angel is haunted & is the oldest pub, it has a true English pub environment, they also have their own tasty beer.     If you enjoy relaxing & walking around a small town, & exploring shops as well as tasting wine, NOL is the place for you.     The queen's royal park at the water is a relaxing spot to share a bottle of vino.     There are horse drawn carriage tours that leave from prince of Wales hotel.     Do some research on festivals, for example the peach festival is an explosive party to taste buds & an excellent opportunity of a time to go.    If you want to venture away from NOL, Welland canal isn't far away. The flora clock near the l&q bridge is neat. The butterfly conservatory & botanical gardens are great to visit (whirlpool).   Spanish aero car is a fun ride. Niagara Glen, is the equivalent of devil's hole & just as fun as it."

Buffalo,3dt4eu,Fudgeworth,7,Sun Jul 19 05:00:31 2015 UTC,"Compared to previous years it was a bit of a let down.  I fell in love with the event 2 years ago looking up a grain Silo and seeing illuminated gears ( http://bit.ly/1CPFxED ironically the header image on the Facebook event page) . Venue change was a bit of a let down, but that could have been executed better. The lack of content was really my biggest complaint. There wasn't even a place where artists were selling any art this year. Food/beer/bathroom situations were improved, but everything else suffered."
Buffalo,3dt4eu,haricari,3,Sun Jul 19 08:35:10 2015 UTC,I don't think any event in the city will compare to CoN at the silos.  I get the idea of wanting to mix it up and highlight another section of the city but why did they block off the water with the food trucks? If you're going to experience the Old First Ward that's where you are going to go!   I too was disappointed with the quality of the art and some of the performances. I went through the trains while it was still light out so I didn't get the full effect. By the time I came back to the trains at night the line was too long.   On the positive side the shuttle service was great....  I really hope they go back to the silos next year!
Buffalo,3dt4eu,BornOnATightrope,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:34:49 2015 UTC,"shuttles were great, but there was a couple of mistakes on the SoN website.

Minor issues, but the drivers were great!"
Buffalo,3dt4eu,haricari,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:23:28 2015 UTC,Didn't catch that- I used the Larkin shuttle and it was perfect. Very quick and ample parking. Hopefully next year will be better!
Buffalo,3dt4eu,BornOnATightrope,4,Sun Jul 19 14:56:47 2015 UTC,"I thought there was definitely some cool stuff (some of train cars, the glowing sculpture), but it felt a little sparse on the whole.  As someone involved with projects like this, I think it's important to remember that most events like CON in Buffalo are put on by volunteers who work really hard to pull them off.  If we, as a community, want more and better events like this, we need to tell our local leaders that they should be funded proportionally."
Buffalo,3dt4eu,budboomer,3,Sun Jul 19 18:35:48 2015 UTC,"So, so disappointed. Last year at the Silos was incredible. There was far more art, it was more interactive. Just...disappointing."
Buffalo,3dt4eu,mrsclause2,3,Sun Jul 19 17:03:51 2015 UTC,"A lot of disappointed people will no doubt blame the change of venue, but I feel the real problem was the lack of content and poor planning.  Communication from the organizers was horrible this year. Despite having a flyer, the event's website, and FB page, I had to rely on commenters for info on where to park, where the event actually was (all official literature simply said ""Old First Ward""), and the cost for general admission  (which was zero, but I felt that could've been stated).  Speaking of costs, I feel bad for anyone who paid for the Saturday night ""VIP"" passes. I've seen more exclusive and nicer setups at a high school dance.  Using the train cars instead of silos was a neat attempt, but woefully mismanaged as people were piled in and slowly marched from car to car. The individual car experience is felt, overexposed, and finally becomes irritating by the time you manage through it and it's like this on repeat as you either wait to get through the whole thing or give up in between two cars. I suppose the one solution would have been to only allow a finite people into each car at a time, but perhaps there weren't enough volunteers for this.   Outside of the train cars, the big focus this year was on performances. Those I saw were entertaining and welcomed. But, this seemed to be at the greater expense of art displays and booths. Don't get me wrong: I don't want this event turning into the Allentown Art Festival. But I also enjoyed interacting with and supporting some of the local artists. Even if nothing was for sale, it would have been nice to see more exhibits.  A few other notes:   The church had some video art playing when I stopped by - not my cup of tea but more power to you if it's yours. The building with the VIP area was primarily an ad for whatever apartments/condos/lofts are being built there. The hipsters are invading! The garage next to it was was a unique venue and the acoustics were rad. The community center had some interesting services and information. The kid doing his best Ginberg cosplay in the corner I could do without. Lots of food trucks! The mural by the tracks was the highlight for me. Close second was the neighborhood itself. The OFW has charm and I wouldn't mind if CoN came back next year - but they really need to get their act together."

I was there for 4 hours and missed the aerialists twice! Overall, I still enjoyed the event : )"
Buffalo,3dt4eu,zipunzipit,2,Sun Jul 19 20:16:53 2015 UTC,"There was a schedule, but it seemed each act had delays (reasons are unknown to me), which pushed the whole thing back quite a bit.  I had a friend that was supposed to begin performing at 9 PM but didn't start until close to 10 due to this.  If you followed the schedule provided (which wasn't exactly easy to come by), nothing would've made sense.  Incidentally, I want to say around 11 PM I saw a security guard escorting 12/8 from the east side of the event across toward the ""amphitheater"" talking on his walkie-talkie: ""I found the band.  They met at the wrong bar.  I'm bringing them over now.  Be there in 5."""
Buffalo,3dt4eu,Harvey6ft,2,Mon Jul 20 00:50:44 2015 UTC,a lot of people were upset about the change of venue. Obviously silo city is amazing and a great venue. this could have been cool but there was next to 0 content
Buffalo,3dt4eu,wild_cosmia,2,Sun Jul 19 22:24:26 2015 UTC,What people don't understand about the event is the downfall of why they hated is that the idea of the event is not to exist at one location forever. It's to be hosted in less popular areas for a few years to bring attention to them as they are resourceful & /or areas of interest
Buffalo,3dt4eu,LeJourLeFroid,2,Mon Jul 20 01:06:36 2015 UTC,"The event is going to end up dying though if people end up walking away disappointed. No one would care to even go after a while, which sucks because I think it's a great idea. I actually thought the Old First Ward site was a really cool spot, there just wasn't really much to go do or look at once you made one pass through. It definitely did get me interested in checking out the Old First Ward though.   I think a much better idea would be to, have Silo City be the nucleus for the event with it branching all the way out to the Old First Ward and give people room to go up to the water. Instead of moving it around every year, get some bigger musical acts and artist to make it an even bigger event. I wouldn't mind paying to go to something that was like the past City of Night events at Silo City combined with this one. Buffalo needs a big signature event like how Austin has SXSW, NYC has the CMJ or Gainesville has the Fest. If ELAB doesn't do this, some one else has a golden opportunity."
Buffalo,3dt4eu,whirlpool138,2,Mon Jul 20 05:53:28 2015 UTC,"The event will only die if people don't stop being hyper critical & adverse to changes. The essence of the event isn't to revisit a location that now has become revived/recognized.   it's like using the same canvas too much for an artist.  They're manipulating the environment around them, three years at the same location could be like drawing the same image 365 times. Art isn't about being regular & located in a common known area. It's not meant to be mundane, confined to one space.     The largest art/music event you seek is called edgefest, blue Heron festival, buffalove festival, & kerfuffle.     I don't think centralizing the silos as a hub would work well.     You know the first year of the event at silo city was quite beat & dead, right? Nobody knew what to expect & after it the reviews were mixed.     I would be willing to bet, if silo city were a centralized hub for the event which then had exhibits elsewhere, people would complain that there isn't enough at silo city or that they would have to go elsewhere.  It's bad enough people are complaining it wasn't at the silos.  That's like complaining that a band that regularly visits buffalo played their show at mohawk place instead of the showplace. An unfamiliar location does not merit a negative response, & I bet that is mostly what stems the negativity.     What if a few years away the event is held in black Rock? Could you imagine how outraged people would be if they all went to silo city for a few exhibits & one band, to learn they need to travel across the city, to the opposite side to see the rest of the event exhibits?          Meanwhile, as I understand it seems as though the organization of the event could have been better, the first years of a venue change are never smooth.     Then again, if the event had had such great support from the community in its last year, a big hit, it should have not mattered if the venue was changed.  When ingenuity Cleveland moved from the Detroit shoreway sub level of the bridge to a forgotten early century industrial warehouse, the event doubled attendance."
Buffalo,3dt4eu,LeJourLeFroid,4,Mon Jul 20 11:10:47 2015 UTC,"The reality is, CoN is a victim of it's own success. People have way too high expectations, and Silo City wants too much money for a free event. It was cheaper when no one cared about the Silos, now that it's the place to be they jacked prices. (This was also a part of why the Rock Gym never happened, among others of course)"
Buffalo,3dt4eu,sobuffalo,2,Mon Jul 20 12:22:43 2015 UTC,"See this is the problem, I assume you have something to do with ELAB. Instead of listening to people's criticism and hearing out the complaints, people like you are going on the defense. The bottom line is, people aren't going to keep going to the City of Night event if there isn't anything to do and people are leaving disappointed. It has nothing to do with the people who are attending's ad version to change or their negativity. Just reading your first paragraph makes me go ""well fuck you too, atleast I still came out and supported you guys"". It makes the event look bad and it's going to push even more people away, regardless of where you have it and the programming. The other poster was right about City of Light being a victim of it's own success. The event went from being huge and exciting last year to basically one small street with a few attractions, a crazy long line to walk through crowded shipping containers (you could of atleast have a real train like everyone on here said there would be) and the same food trucks that are out at every event. Your comment reeks of being arrogant and totally craps on the people who are attending's thoughts and feelings.  I agree that art is meant to be changing and innovative, but one of the biggest criticisms is that there was little to no art at this years event and even when there was, it was extremely derivative and trite. Is this really the best Buffalo has (I know it's not because the past City of Night events were a blast and there is other great things happening in the city)? The thing you are missing is that people aren't just upset that the event changed. They are upset by how little art and interactive stuff they were to do, that the art train ended up being a bunch of shipping containers that were over crowded and had a long line, that access to the water was completely cut off, that the murder burlesque show was just awful and that the Barrel Factory was basically empty ( my group of friends literally had the door slammed shut on us as we were walking in by one of the events volunteers, why would you shut the door on people when it's only 11:00 pm and the event has another hour?). Just read the comments for this thread, the list goes on for a while.  Also the Kerfuffle and Edgefest are nothing like SXSW or the Fest in Gainesville.  Those were actual real music and art festivals that both attract people to new neighborhoods and artists. The Kerfuffle is an awful comparasion,The Buffalove and Herd Fest were especially narrow ended and under achieving.  I mentioned it as a possibility to what people want and expect City of Light to be. Crossing the city to see exhibitions and bands doesn't hurt the New Orleans Voodoo Fest, SXWS in Austin, NXNE in Toronto, the CMJ in NYC or any of the other big street art festivals across North America. People aren't going to end up going to the Black Rock in the first place if it's anything like this years event!City of Light could be something that could put Buffalo back on the cultural map and attract people from out of town. If next year's event is as lackluster, I honestly can't see it last to long which is a shame because I loved the first two years and would gladly pay to attend.  One of the most beloved and exciting art installations was used as the event header! I knew a ton of people who legitimately thought they were gonna get to go to Silo City again! How much more of a bait and switch can you get!?!? People would be pissed if it was any other big festival, what was the point of even having that up if people weren't going to even see it? You compare this years City of Light to the Ingenuity Cleveland moving it's location, but did the event this year pull in as many people as last year? The crowded didn't look nearly as big and by reading all the comments on here, it's pretty evident that people walked away pretty disappointed."
Buffalo,3dt4eu,whirlpool138,-1,Mon Jul 20 16:45:46 2015 UTC,"Lol sorry. Honestly.  Did not mean to come off as ""fuck you too"" - nope don't work for elab just sick of reading the negative reports. I thought it was okay for its first year. Sure it could have used more content, idk who was part of the organization this year except for one or two people, and they usually pull most of the artists. Maybe many artists were adverse to doing it because it wasn't at the silos? Which would be stupid since it's a means for them to be seen.      All I meant was the public needs to give everything a chance, especially when it comes to art, not jump all over it and compare it to the previous year.  Yes, it is a victim to its own success."
Buffalo,3dt4eu,LeJourLeFroid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:09:38 2015 UTC,"I am also sorry if I came off nasty in my last post. I honestly want City of Light and ELAB to succeed but there were some obvious things that were a let down about this year (the gears silo being advertised, lack of artists, limited programming) but it did attract me down to the Old First Ward, so I guess it did it's job. It just feels like such a huge drop off compared to last year , when it could be such a huge event for Buffalo. Maybe next year, work out a deal with Silo City? People really really want it back there. Maybe make it a huge event by inviting Sugar City, Squeaky Wheel, CEPA, Hallwalls, WNY Creative Writing Center, Feral Kid Records, Black Dots and all the other art groups in the city to participate? Something like that would be a massive hit. For something that is supposed to be about promoting art and new neighborhoods in Buffalo, it really missed the mark and didn't seem cohesive."
Buffalo,3dt4eu,whirlpool138,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:00:42 2015 UTC,"From what I'm hearing, going in the day time was vastly different than at night. The art installations were lackluster and sparse, but the live art performances were entertaining.   The burlesque show had some talented people. There were also some performances that were rather strange like the pseudo torture porn strip show act. I don't really ""get"" art. at around 10:30 there was a live band parade and a whole bunch of people dancing along with it followed by a very impressive fire dancer show.  If you left at 9:15, I think you may have left too early."
Buffalo,3dt4eu,Rydev,-3,Sun Jul 19 14:17:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah.. What was up with that ""murder burlesque"" show? I'm a pretty open person but that was not enjoyable.  I left right after her ""performance""."

They might have been 22s however their wings were very identifiable to 15s & 16 however of the two. Definitely 15s due to the rear engine exhaust. Not thunderbirds BTW. Their show planes are typically painted.

As for why the logo is the tomato planet..That's a tough one to explain. It started out as an actual plant with pizza type items growing off of it. Then the tomato was eventually created and things evolved away from the plant and more towards to the tomato.  It's not always easy to explain why The Pizza Plant is how it is haha.

Buffalo,3dns49,LuckyCahoon,5,Fri Jul 17 21:03:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly nobody wants your drawings or cassettes when they're out drinking (no offense). You don't want to approach people from a place of seeking validation. To you it may seem like you're offering them something, but to them you're more like the bum they had to say no to on the way to the bar. Don't task them with anything.  Again, your work might be great and some people might like it, but that's more of a daytime thing I'd suspect. People out at night only want to have fun. So just be a fun, likeable, non threatening person.   Be playing darts by yourself, then ask someone near you if they wanna play. This probably works better with pool actually. Go to one place often and get to know the bartenders (tip well - you'll get a lot out of it). You'll soon realize other frequent flyers at that bar and you can talk to them. Go out on the patio where people are smoking or just hanging...People seem to be more sociable outside.   (Edit: I just realized you weren't talking about going out to bars specifically so most of that wasn't super relevant but whatever 😃  )  The above is for both sexes btw. As for your main question, yeah girls in Buffalo are tough to crack! Honestly you might have better luck in the suburban bar scene. But I live on elmwood and really only go to elmwood bars and I basically never pull chicks haha. And I'm a decent looking dude with a great personality when I'm drunk lol. But everyone around elmwood is kinda obsessed with being the cool young professional type so if you're not a local tattoo shop owner or bartender you're already at an unfair disadvantage.   All that being said, there are obviously tons of cool people around, too. Being friendly and fun trumps everything.   What bars do you go to most often?"
Buffalo,3dns49,LuckyCahoon,0,Sun Jul 19 05:42:42 2015 UTC,As far as bars I really only go to the Blue Monk or occasionally I'll stop in random other ones I really mostly go to coffee shops more than anything and people there tend to dig the tapes and drawing more than at any bar yeah but I think its just cause more hipsters go to coffee shops lol (just never quite attract the type of girls I'm after but again I think mostly I'm bad at randomly talking to people I don't know already unless they start the conversation I reeeally need to do that more)

Buffalo,3dns49,mountainsbeyondmtns,0,Sat Jul 18 03:46:22 2015 UTC,"Moved here a little less than a year ago for grad school. My program is all females. I, along with many of my other friends, tried tinder earlier this year. Was in a relationship for about 6 months, but didn't work out...not doing that again. Now we're just trying to spend as much time as possible where other people are...Blue Monk's good, Canalside concerts, fitness in the parks. It's easier said than done to actually meet people though. I think it'd be ideal just to meet someone in a coffee shop or while grocery shopping, I'm working on getting more comfortable just approaching people."
Buffalo,3dns49,bdine49,2,Sat Jul 18 14:55:35 2015 UTC,"Pro life tip, ideal situations are not reality, life isn't a perfectly scripted TV show or film. That kind of event doesn't happen unless you initiate it or accidentally bump into someone, & in that case accidentally bumping into an attractive person is extremely rare, 9/10 it'll be someone you don't even want to touch. Faking it will only be the most disingenuous bad acting you will ever see. Problem is television & film raise people to believe those ideal situations could actually happen. The more you don't think about or worry of meeting someone, the more likely you will meet someone; because it's not on your mind & you're being you."

Buffalo,3dns49,infernux,2,Mon Jul 20 06:14:29 2015 UTC,"Pro life tip: you're always going into nothing.  If you believe every person you speak to will like you, you're already failing yourself before you have done anything.    How to meet people : give zero fucks &  say something like 'hi, Im Bob, is there a beer you really enjoy here at the monk that you would recommend?"" lol that'll blow up a girl's head & maybe stir a conversation.    There's nothing intimidating about females, they're just incredibly judgemental cover readers.

There is also the Niagara Street to 190 South where you can't see over the concrete barrier until the last second.  That is also combined with a short onramp.

It's so dangerous to drive in a lackadaisical manner, but it's a Buffalo thing I suppose.  Driving in the northtown suburbs (Amherst/Williamsville) there is one rule to live by: everyone is on their cellphone. I've seen people pull into an intersection to make a left, then stare straight down at their cellphone (could be their junk too?).

People who block the one way side street or any street to pickup or speak to someone... Pull over the the side of the road especially if there is prevalent space to do so. They will do it when you pull up behind them. Just do it to begin with!     people who do not physically turn their head to look for traffic around them before backing out or switching lanes. relying on your mirrors is dumb.      People who turn right in parking garages.   There's a flow of traffic in here just like a traffic circle, always to the left.     People who do not get over to right to turn right. The dmv handbook says to get as close as possible to curb when turning right. You'll see people in two lanes at once, or swing out left before turning right as if centripetal force has something to do with turning.    People who don't know how to pull into turning lanes after the islands on main, they'll stop in a jack knifed manner blocking the left traffic lane.       People who drive down the center of side streets. People who drive down the center of wide open one way streets when two cars can drive side by side.     people who do not understand their spacial environment & bounds of their vehicle, many drive as though their vehicle is a 3' larger on all sides.     there are people who don't signal when changing lanes, there are people who make dumbass aggressive manuevers banking on that other drivers won't block them out as nobody wants to deal with red tape (there have been times i wanted to speed up just so they slam into me, but then i remember i have a job and I need to be there), there are the crawl out of drives drivers & they sometimes end up blocking traffic just to go where they want to go.      People who don't know how to park on the street. These are people who leave 3feet to half their own car length between the bumper of their own car & the existing parked car.      People who swing their street side doors out into traffic, as if drivers are suppose to sense that's going to happen.     People in circles. Niagara Square is the worst.     the interchange between main/humboldt & the 33 E&W is a fucking disaster, especially for drivers coming from parkside or the west, nobody knows how to use the lanes appropriately, all those interchanges suck because of greedy fucktards who want to bypass waiting in line. nobody wants to let people merge and get over from main/humboldt to the 33w either, so you have to inch out to make it happen, or charge out into a spotted gap, also people from main/humboldt to 33e need to learn to just fill in that right lane on the offramp to merge into traffic instead of trying to immediately get in to line. people who don't realize the 33w interchange from 198e is going to become one lane is infuriating, they always zoom up the right side, then get over at the last minute, i'm shocked nobody has had a michael bay blow up crash there.    people who insist on staying in the right lane when an obvious onramp merge is coming up. people who don't understand that they need to get up to speed to join traffic from a dead stop or slowed down yield, especially when a gap is big enough for multiple waiting cars to join, best example is the construction interchange from porter to 190 north, but that also falls into the dickbags who don't shift over to allow people to merge.     oh and box blockers. holy fuck, they are the worst. elmwood and tupper seems to be one of the worst intersections to witness this around rush hour. people who just block the intersection. nobody can go anywhere. there are times you'll have one person coming from the west on tupper to east tupper, one person who was heading south on elmwood turning onto east tupper and someone heading north on elmwood turning onto east tupper all gridlocked in the box together. some people will moan that it's a traffic light problem, but it really isn't. if it's obvious you can pull into the road where your vehicle isn't going to clear the intersecting lane, don't turn or don't go through. it's just selfish behavior, has nothing to do with light timing.    thing is, much this behavior can be seen all over the country, it's not limited to wny.  people are just not taught how to drive properly and safely for everyone on the road; to essentially share the road. everyone is in a big fucking hurry to get somewhere all because they're selfish and incapable of departing at an appropriate time. and then there are those who just don't give a fuck if they destroy their car."

You may pass on the right:      When a vehicle ahead makes a left turn.   not illegal, just need to use caution per NYS DMV guidelines   If you prepare to pass on the right at an intersection, check the traffic ahead carefully.

They have boxing classes and you can probably get more advanced personal training if you wanted (or other fighting styles). I didn't box when I was going there, but the atmosphere is very friendly/supportive and the prices are good."
Buffalo,3dggfc,j_la,2,Thu Jul 16 03:04:55 2015 UTC,"KC's was the first place that showed up, and it seems solid.  I just wasn't sure if it was ""fitness boxing"" or more legit"
Buffalo,3dggfc,Grooth,3,Thu Jul 16 03:22:07 2015 UTC,"I used kcs for years and it's more than just fitness boxing. Several students competed in golden gloves. My old trainer Max I think works at BCUT now I think but KCS is legit as fuck. At least it was when I used to go there when it was on symphony circle.  And Kevin is seriously the nicest dude. It's kinda pricey if you have a personal trainer but as I recall the classes weren't too bad. And at the time paying for classes have full access to the gym at all open hours. I'm a bit biased because I did an internship there for a few months back in high school but I have a lot of great memories. The thing I loved about KC's is that it never had a ""meathead"" vibe. Yea there were some incredible competing power lifters that trained there but everyone was always kind and helpful. People would say hi to the regulars and just be generally very welcoming. The first day I ever went there I had personal training and I had to stop for a bit because it was pretty intense, and this random guy came up to me and gave me some words of encouragement. I learned eventually he was a regular, but it's just an example of the kind of positive attitude that gym fostered."

Which is great, because you'll be close to everything and have the Metrorail right there.  Allentown is just a short walk away and you'll find a lot of indie music, cheap dive bars and a few nicer places in between.  Downtown you have Chippewa street where the clubs are. Enjoy the 4 am last call.  If you're here this Saturday, definitely check out City of Night.  The Italian Festival is also this weekend and worth checking out for the food or if you're into Italian music.    Albright-Knox - Picasso, Warhol, Van Gogh, etc Buffalo City Hall - for the free observation deck atop of the third tallest city hall in the US. The free tour is also awesome. Buffalo Naval Park and Museum - Largest inland naval park in the US with 3 WWII era vessels to explore. Teddy Roosevelt National Inauguration Site - where the president took the oath of office following the assassination of William McKinley at the 1901 World's Fair Walkable Neighborhoods, each with their own charm and filled with local bars, restaurants, cafes and boutiques - Elmwood Village, Allentown, North Buffalo/Hertel"

Buffalo,3deafo,auburner,5,Wed Jul 15 23:52:17 2015 UTC,"I feel like you missed the entire point of my reply. OP asked for recommendations for activities. He stated what he enjoys doing. U/eudaimonics suggested things to do that fit the criteria but also some other activities he thought were interesting day time activities unique to Buffalo and worth checking out.   Now, my issue is why activities like the art museum, a national historic site, and a neighborhood tours are automatically ""old people"" activities. You need to adjust your attitude about life. Those activities are for all ages and are some of the best ways to get a good feel of the city. Going out in Allen and EV are also great but when you are nursing a hangover, an art museum is a great way to spend the day.  Open your mind, bruh."
Buffalo,3deafo,Vocal_Minority,-3,Thu Jul 16 02:03:24 2015 UTC,"I in fact do not need to adjust my attitude about anything.  I am interested in history and art, but I am able to gauge when someones interests don't mesh with mine.

Buffalo,3dc0fx,WilliamHenryHarrison,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:25:41 2015 UTC,Exactly. The contract with the city is one of the reasons fios hasn't made into the city
Buffalo,3dc0fx,N0minal,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:54:20 2015 UTC,"No, the only reason FiOS didn't make it to the city is that they need to offer it everywhere, within 5 years, or not at all.

Buffalo,3dc0fx,WilliamHenryHarrison,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:31:51 2015 UTC,"The franchise agreement with TWC expired about a decade ago. It's all negotiated through the State Public Service commission now--basically with the same terms; 5% of revenue, free basic tier I-net for municipal buidlings.

Once students complete the semester’s courses [...] they’ll be able to demonstrate the ability to use electrical instruments to perform standard tests, measurements and tasks; operate nanofabrication process equipment with a focus on safety, environmental and health issues; and apply quality standards used by industries across Buffalo-set locations at Riverbend and the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus."

Buffalo,3d91u0,Eudaimonics,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:23:22 2015 UTC,"The NYS Broadband maps are surprisingly spot on, although I have noticed discrepancies in the maps, specifically boiling down to overstating coverage in the Northtowns, and with that, speeds. That's been getting corrected slowly, and I've pointed out specific areas of inaccuracies to them.  Another aspect to remember is that in many areas, Verizon DSL is beginning to undergo a ""Stop Sell."" While Verizon may offer something between 500kbps to 15Mbps, it doesn't mean they'll connect it. Even in the areas that lack FiOS. Verizon wants nothing to do with the copper or it's associated technologies. They would much rather sell it off, or milk it until it's dead, then scrap it in favor of Wireless."

This fact doesn't stop them from sending me at least one mailer a week asking me to sign up for coverage they can't provide.  When I'm feeling playful, I call them up and try to order it.  Edit to add, this is especially galling considering much of the ""Universal Service Fee"" paid on our phone bills for the past ~15 years was meant for the construction of high speed fiber.  Verizon took that money, serviced the most profitable areas, and then backed out of the commitment."

USF is not for building fiber, it's for connecting rural America, first with telephone, now with internet/cell phone. No areas connected w/ USF money have ever been profitable, that's the reason USF exists, to ensure areas that are impossible to serve profitably still have service.  In fact, Verizon declined to participate in the first USF disbursement designed to connect rural America to broadband.  Moreover, USF has only been used for broadband purposes since 2011, hardly the past ~15 years."

Verizon nears “the end” of FiOS builds  At the same time, VZ has let it's copper decay, and has ceased expansion of fiber.    Also, when talking about fiber penetration, VZ likes to refer to the number of ""buildings passed"", however, according to the above article,   Some homes are passed with fiber but aren't ready for services because network gear in the central office hasn't been initialized."

This one house is preventing the entire neighborhood from becoming a walkable city center, in a bustling commercial district.  From my vantage point in Chicago, where I'm a renowned architect and city planner, I can see this gem MUST BE SAVED FROM DEMO, and restored to it's former glory.  I will not make an offer on the lot, and nobody else should, but the city MUST FORCE the sale of this property to someone, or force the owner to make all repairs.  Because, cars and gasoline.

Buffalo,3d4qns,LeJourLeFroid,6,Mon Jul 13 16:40:19 2015 UTC,I think this is another good thing about having Pegula as an owner.  He has already proven that he is willing to spend his own money on sport complexes. He also seems to be very good at making money off them too just looking at the Harbor Center.  Time will tell though.
Buffalo,3d4qns,Eudaimonics,4,Mon Jul 13 16:19:51 2015 UTC,"He's willing to spend his own money when the state, county, city, and school district give him subsidies.  I would much rather see the state set up a government organization to construct, own and operate a new Buffalo stadium, and for Pegula to lease that stadium out from the state. This way, the local municipal governments would receive the full tax benefits that the stadium would bring in."
Buffalo,3d4qns,a_jackson_federalist,3,Mon Jul 13 16:48:08 2015 UTC,"This would be the best option ONLY if the government also got naming rights and concession revenue. Then at least the stadium would pay for itself over time.  Right now the Ralph is owned by the County, but correct me if I'm wrong, but they don't actually enjoy the revenue generating parts of the stadium.  If done right there are a lot of ways to make money from a stadium other than 10 NFL games per year."
Buffalo,3d4qns,Eudaimonics,3,Mon Jul 13 18:06:58 2015 UTC,"Concessions would be contracted out. Del north would buy the rights to run them and earn the profits.   Issues like naming rights would have to be figured out with the Bills though. The Bills would be the reason why the stadiums name has any value, so they would deserve some of the profits from naming rights.   The state agency would obviously get the profits from the concerts, unless the concerts are held during periods of time that the bills have leased."

Buffalo,3d57w8,thahamer,4,Mon Jul 13 16:54:39 2015 UTC,"I am a fan and go fairly regularly for woodworking projects. It depends on what you're looking to do/how much time and money you'd like to invest.   They have a free night every 3rd Monday of the month where you can come in and work on a project for a few hours. They ask for a small donation if you use their materials.   Speaking of materials, it's a big help if you have an idea of what you want to make and the materials to make it. They have a much more limited supply now that one of their tenants left.   For small stuff (cutting board, spoon, etc.) they probably have some scrap laying around but that's iffy. For larger projects you can buy supervised time in the shop. $50 for the safety course; $75 for 20 hours/month. That's charged on a month to month basis. This doesn't include materials.   As far as learning, they're great. Megan is the founder of foundry and there all the time. She's very nice and good at showing you what to do but letting you do the work. Some of the other people that help out there as supervisors can get caught up in their expertise and start doing a lot of it for you rather than letting you just run with it, which can be a good thing if you're worried about making a shitty project.   This turned into a really long post but feel free to ask any more questions if you have them."
Buffalo,3d57w8,vivelafrance,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:57:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the long post i really appreciate it.  Really the reason i considered there was because i don't own any real tools myself. This all started because I decided to buy a pile of wood and build this: http://i.imgur.com/mbXZ9mUl.jpg  It's simple and i made it quickly using a hand saw, four 3$ clamps from harbor freight, and a cheap drill. Its got some flaws, the edges are rough, and the cut on that backing plywood is REAL rough, but i made it with my hands and It felt good.  So, i decided that id like to learn more about this, and theres some simple furniture and stuff around the house that I could use that I would love to build myself. I started looking into woodworking classes, since clearly I have no skills as of right now, and thats how i got to the idea of the Foundry.  The more I look around though, Im thinking maybe A class or two from there might be helpful, but in reality a small benchtop table saw, and some other miscellaneous tools might be all I really need to get started. For the 75 a month, i could save for 3 or 4 months and get the saw, and maybe use youtube as my teacher for now."
Buffalo,3d57w8,vivelafrance,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:48:37 2015 UTC,Yeah that's definitely and option. You can test the water and go to the open class next Monday if you want. Just make a cutting board or something small. They'd probably have the scrap around and would just cost ~$10 donation.

Buffalo,3d5owa,sobuffalo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:13:02 2015 UTC,Apparently since the late 90's they frown upon floating down the river. Were you flagging down the sheriffs like you were in trouble and had to be rescued or did they just say get the hell out?
Buffalo,3d5owa,bucky716,2,Tue Jul 14 03:13:05 2015 UTC,"This was back in the 60's (yes, I'm an old fart) and the sheriff was called by someone at Hank's Boat yard. They came from down river, so they must have been patrolling the Grand Island bridges area looking for kids who would drop stones off the bridge on boats (noooo, not us kids).   Yeah, they chewed us out good, but were nice enough to drop us off back at the foot of Ontario St where our bikes were locked. I can't remember how we were going to get back to the bikes if we made it to Strawberry island. How dumb were we? Really dumb, I don't know what I'd tell my kid if he ever would have done some stunt like that!"
Buffalo,3d5owa,Mister_JR,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:51:39 2015 UTC,lol nooo not us.. Maybe I'm just lucky that we managed to tube during times they weren't out or no one called.
Buffalo,3d5owa,bucky716,5,Tue Jul 14 17:59:20 2015 UTC,Don't try to swim in the Niagara River. The current is very swift. You'll end up with a search team dragging your body out of the river on the other side of the falls.
Buffalo,3d5owa,son_et_lumiere,5,Mon Jul 13 19:33:07 2015 UTC,"At Strawberry island, you're still 13 miles upstream of the falls.  Chances of actually reaching the falls is pretty slim. Plenty of chances to get to shore (particularly on the North Tonawanda side). If you do make it to the falls, it is likely you have already drowned before getting there."
Buffalo,3d5owa,Eudaimonics,3,Mon Jul 13 19:53:51 2015 UTC,"I've heard some parts are worse than others. Besides, a swift current in-itself is not dangerous. But I'm curious if there any undertows ."

Buffalo,3d5owa,bucky716,2,Mon Jul 13 21:07:07 2015 UTC,It's possible. We used to tube from the foot of Ontario St to Niawanda Park and a couple times we paddled our asses off and made it to the island. There's a lot of boats out there and it'd be tough to see you swimming so make sure someone is spotting you!
Buffalo,3d5owa,SoBuffaloRes,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:44:02 2015 UTC,"Short answer: No.  Long answer:  Yes, with proper supporting team and if you are a strong swimmer, and are able to figure out where you will need to start, in order to compensate for the current."
Buffalo,3d5owa,LeJourLeFroid,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:02:10 2015 UTC,"Sure. Put on an identifiable pfd & have a guide boat with you. If you started up stream around the army Corp of engineers locks swim out to the middle of the river you might hit it. Prob have to start more like foot of ferry. If you attempt from directly across black Rock park, you'd probably end up at beaver island state park.     That current is strong."

Buffalo,3d1lx0,SoBuffaloRes,13,Sun Jul 12 19:53:14 2015 UTC,30 mph is ridiculously slow though. It needs to be at least 45.
Buffalo,3d1lx0,TooterMcgavin716,8,Sun Jul 12 20:02:51 2015 UTC,"Why? The problem is dot and our elected leaders are complete idiots. They made the entire length 30, which is just plain dumb. The cartoon missed the point though and is a lazy commentary on what happened. This was a reactive response by chest-pumping politicians who have allowed nysdot to ignore the constituency who overwhelmingly wanted this thing removed, or at least turned into something more conducive for a park. The fact there were never guardrails there--ever--says a lot about nysdot and the elected leaders. Guardrails slow, even stop, cars from careening out of control. That road had zero safety measures, despite cutting through a park. This was such an easy task that concrete barriers appeared in a single week after this crash. But where did they come from? They aren't new. So what other roads did the idiots make unsafe to make this road a little safer?"
Buffalo,3d1lx0,ReverendBass,8,Mon Jul 13 00:32:33 2015 UTC,Its too slow for the current configuration. It still feels like an expressway. People speed by accident.  They need to actually downgrade it into the parkway for it to actually make sense.  Hopefully this will happen sooner than later.
Buffalo,3d1lx0,Eudaimonics,2,Sun Jul 12 21:07:07 2015 UTC,"Based on the ""renovations"" coming, it doesn't sound like they'll change the ""scaping"" much at all from expressway to Parkway. Narrowing the lanes doesn't make it feel like a Parkway as I read was said in a TBN article. Main Street has narrowed lanes.... I don't see anyone slowing down"
Buffalo,3d1lx0,LeJourLeFroid,4,Mon Jul 13 03:25:30 2015 UTC,"it's really not that bad. I'd be fine with them raising it to 40/45 where the 198 isn't actually going through the park, but 30 seems right for where it is near all of the walkers/joggers/pedestrians."
Buffalo,3d1lx0,chocolate_babies,3,Sun Jul 12 20:45:08 2015 UTC,I like the idea of making it not an expressway.  I live near the park and use 198-33 1-2x/week.  There are plenty of alternate routes where 198 as a thoroughfare is unnecessary.   But realistically it is so short from Delaware to 190 how much commute time does it add?
Buffalo,3d1lx0,wmm339,4,Mon Jul 13 12:58:43 2015 UTC,"I've been in Buffalo for about 4 years now and the SUVs on 198 are the first time I've seen actual Buffalo police pulling people over. I'm used to the staties on 90/190, but it's novel for me to see Buffalo police doing something.  edit - The blonde police lady seems to be ridiculously pretty, which makes merging a few times a day a lot better.  edit edit - The slower speed isn't nearly as annoying as I assumed it would be either."

Buffalo,3d1lx0,Eudaimonics,6,Mon Jul 13 18:48:09 2015 UTC,"The spot where the kid was hit is notorious for being log jammed and slow, I seriously doubt the car was doing above 30 to begin with.  The fault is with the driver and the lack of barriers.  It's a 4 lane expressway, and for a while a 6 lane expressway.  Lets stop the bullshit, it needs to be 45+.  People die in tragic accidents all the time, and the knee jerk reaction to lower the speed limit is a joke.  They finally started writing tickets today, yet people do 50 MPH down Delaware ave.  I'm totally fine with them downgrading it to a 2 lane road with a nice median, roundabouts, bike path, and parking for access to the parks, however until then lets put the speed limit back to normal.  I don't mind the extra time spent driving, but there's something unnatural about the configuration and the speed limit that make it unbearable to drive.  I equate it to traffic jams in the morning on the 290.  You know you should be going 55, but when you're stuck in traffic it's horrible. My brother died on Millersport in a traffic accident so I'm not a heartless asshole who doesn't understand the situation."
Buffalo,3d1lx0,Sabres00,9,Mon Jul 13 00:15:30 2015 UTC,"No. That intersection is bullshit. Nobody drives properly. People, ahem, asshats, coming off the 33 may think they can use that third lane to get ahead of traffic which is really for people exiting from the 33/198 to Parkside & those merging on from humbolt/main as well as those coming in from Parkside. Just as badly people going from Parkside to 33 should get in the right lane on Parkside if they're going 33east & the left if they're going 33west. Theres no need to slow down everyone trying to go west just so they can get ahead of traffic a little bit. & on that note nobody going east or west should be in the middle lane between Humboldt/main & 198 to 33 interchange, that lane is not there to go all the way to the beginning of the off ramp to skip everyone in traffic & create a dangerous road block for those needing to pickup speed to join traffic to 33west. Any fuckface who uses those interchange lanes to get ahead of traffic is an inconsiderate turd.     Also, you don't mind the extra time & yet you're advocating to has the speed raised. Make a choice! You can't be fine with 30mph if you want the limit up to 45."

Buffalo,3d08cy,laceychr,7,Sun Jul 12 11:41:57 2015 UTC,"I love Kaisertown! It's kind of like a living fossil, in a way. Outside of the enclaves south of William Street, it's among the last stable, old-school ""worker's cottage"" neighborhoods on the East Side; a place with the built environment and demographics that used to define Buffalo's ""Polonia"".  Kaisertown is pretty much what Broadway-Fillmore, Broadway-Bailey, Genesee-Moselle, and the other street-hyphen-street neighborhoods along the radials east of Fillmore were like in the 1970s. It's fairly safe, and many blocks reflect a positive stereotype about Polish-Americans - they're very meticulous about maintaining their houses and lawns.    It's not going to gntrify anytime soon. I don't see the usual east-of-Main decline in its future either, unless a mass dieoff of babchas floods the market with cheap houses, like what happened in Broadway-Fillmore in the 1990s.  Kaisertown is like a bastion of ""old Buffalo"" - friendly, Go Bills!, bowling, all paper bingo, meat raffles, Monte Carlo nights, fish fry, summers following lawn fetes and Chiavettas from parish to parish, vacations to Vegas and Myrtle Beach, schools where half of the teachers are named ""Mister K"", drinking Genny Cream to stay ""regular"", and so on.  Lovejoy, the other East Side ""holdout"" neighborhood, has a much different vibe, both physically and socially. Still blue collar, with much bigger houses and lots than Kaisertown.  Lovejoy has a reputation as being somewhat cold to (non-Italian) outsiders, and very racist. Whether it's deserved or not, I don't know, but a lot of the Lovejoy residents I've known or met put on an ""I'm from Lovejoy and I'll kick your ass!"" tough guy persona.    Kaisertown is kind of like a sweet Polish grandmother who always has fresh pierogies when you visit, interrupted by that one guy who keeps 1980s Buffalo hesher culture alive, and still boasts about being a 97 Rock Workforce Employee of the Day in 1998. Lovejoy, based on its reputation, is more like that one uncle who worships the ground Carl Paladino walks on."

Buffalo,3d08cy,bdiap,3,Sun Jul 12 13:15:11 2015 UTC,Thank you kindly! Looking forward to making many great memories as well :)
Buffalo,3d08cy,Fudgeworth,4,Mon Jul 13 01:43:33 2015 UTC,"I've been living in Kaisertown for a little over 2 years.  The quality of houses and people varies from street to street and block to block.  If you look at some places like Fenton and Holly Streets south of Casimer you will see all of the houses are well maintained.  Weimar Street north of Casimer on the other hand is kind of ghetto.    The good thing about Kaisertown is that it is affordable and safe.  I haven't had any break-ins with my car or place.  There is a decent police presence in the area too.    There is a wide range of people living in Kaisertown.  My street has both retirement age people and families with young kids.  Without looking at statistics I'd say it is mostly white and 10-15% black.  Haven't seen many hispanic, Asian, or Indian people around.  As for food places, I don't really eat in Kaisertown, I'd rather go to other places in the city.  I did have a decent beef on weck and wings at Wiechec's Lounge on Clinton.  I've been meaning to check out Polish Villa on Harlem.  I've tried all the pizza places on Clinton but would rather make the drive to Gino's NY on South Park.    There's some recreation activities around Kaisertown.  Holiday's sports bar has sand volleyball.  They cover the courts when it gets cold out.  There is also American Indoor Street Hockey on Mineral Springs.    Overall I'd say that I'm happy with my choice to rent here.  I'll probably live here for another year or two and then either buy a house or move close to Elmwood."
Buffalo,3d08cy,dew22,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:33:57 2015 UTC,Gino's on South park? Is that the same Gino's on Elmwood?
Buffalo,3d08cy,Fudgeworth,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:41:38 2015 UTC,Sure is.  I used to live near the one on Elmwood and was bummed out when I had to move.  Then I saw a post on Reddit about how there was a Gino's on South Park.  It's the same delicious thin crust pizza.
Buffalo,3d08cy,SoBuffaloRes,4,Wed Jul 15 04:18:25 2015 UTC,"Current homeowner in Kaisertown.  It's a very walkable community.  Mainly, because it's a very self-sufficient neighborhood.  For example, there is a grocer, two hardware stores, two gas stations, a liquor store, a few corner stores, etc etc.  Cycling is very well accepted on throughout the neighborhood, so if you like to bike commute, you wont have an issue.  Many people in the neighborhood are older (Although that seems to be changing), outdoors oriented (There's many fishing spots, and some hiking trails).  Weicheks (sp?) has the best Fish Fries in town, IMO, and that's a bold statement coming from me.  SC Lounge is a really nice dive-type bar on the weekends, complete with outdoor seating.  There's a few ""seedier"" bars, but they are still pretty good.  Personally, I avoid Dad's Bar, but many enjoy going there.  Many pizza places:  Guzzo's, Molinas, Desi's, and more than one I'm forgetting.  Partner's is right outside of Kaisertown, on Shanley.  Worth it!  Excellent wings there.  On Harlem Rd, there's a sports bar that has a volley league there as well.  As previously mentioned, there is one official DEC fishing access, which also allows launching Kayaks.  There are some hiking trails back along the Buffalo River, from the DEC point to Stachowski Park behind Houghton Academy.  More or less:  The neighborhood is pretty blue-collar, with accompanying recreation, pubs, and restaurants to match."
Buffalo,3d08cy,KTBillsfan,5,Sun Jul 12 17:01:09 2015 UTC,"I'm sure you got some weird inquiries about your move, we did when we moved here from the ""hot"" neighborhoods because we didn't want to over pay for a home.  I think you'll find you made a good choice!  First you can get almost anywhere in 15 min.  It is very walk-able as well, you can get groceries go to the hardware store or grab a bite and a beer without worry about driving.  Clinton-Bailey farmers market is right across bailey.  If you like Kayaking you can launch right over on Harlem.  I watch all the postings around here, I have a hunch which house you bought, if I'm right good for you, amazing place.  Welcome to the neighborhood!    There's some fb, IG and websites about the neighborhood as well as the blog someone posted below.  https://www.kaisertown-coalition.com/ https://instagram.com/ktownbuff/ https://www.facebook.com/Ktownbuff?fref=ts"

Buffalo,3d08cy,jojotoughasnails,4,Mon Jul 13 02:27:44 2015 UTC,"I think one of the best places in Kaisertown is Porky's. It is truly taking a step back in time. It's still family owned & operated and if you fire up a conversation with the bartenders they will tell you some incredible stories about The neighborhood. The bar used to be open 24 hours a day to service 3 shifts of blue collar work schedules. In addition, the average drink price is $2.50. Less if you're drinking draft beer, maybe more if you're going for something fancy. After I moved to Kaisertown from Parkside I invited a few friends to Porky's and they had an amazing time and were in disbelief about how inexpensive it was.   Another hidden gem is Donut Kraze on Dingens. Most people love Paula's, but Donut Kraze might be able to give Paula a run for her money. They've got some great classics like peanut sticks, but also have some unique flavors like maple bacon and strawberry cheesecake.   Final tip, check out the East Clinton Shopper. It's a traditional neighborhood and not everything is as readily available online as it is in other neighborhoods. It comes out the first week of the month and is free at local businesses. Try Lucky's, Porky's, Desi's or Guzzo's to find a copy.   Welcome to Kaisertown!"
Buffalo,3d08cy,ooppoop,3,Mon Jul 13 12:19:58 2015 UTC,You're right by south Buffalo which is awesome. Lots of hole in the wall bars/restaurants with good wings.  Also could head over to Blasdell for some more commercial stuff...and the cathedral-like Wegmans

The only downside I can see is being so close to the 190 (I imagine the noise/pollution would be rough, but I don't know for sure). Enjoy!  EDIT: I forgot to mention you're right by the Cheektowaga/West Seneca border, so you're right by those amenities as well."

Like any area in buffalo (or any city) you run into some less desirable folks but overall it's a good place to live. Weichec's on Clinton street has awesome food, as does Lucky's.

I moved here in 2007 and really enjoy the area.  I live near the 190 entrance on the western end of Kaisertown, and I love the convenience. I work in Allentown and can get from home to office in about 10-12 minutes depending on traffic. I like my neighbors and have never had any trouble here.  You must go to Hectors Hardware on Clinton. It's like stepping back in time, and they always have what I need. Wiechec's has a spectacular fish fry. Molino's & Guzzo's have decent pizza and wings. The Park Lounge is a great (cheap) place for a quick drink. Since the weather is so nice, you should just take a walk up and down Clinton, stopping in to the various businesses to get a feel for the neighborhood and its residents.  I think you're going to like it here! And tell your friends!"

It just puzzles me that managers of bars with sports on do not look at the tv schedule for the night to figure out what programs they want displayed.   And nobody is talking about the suburbs. I know your chain place has the game on most likely. It is probably one of the things I like most about national chains.

Buffalo,3cswx6,wh0ligan,0,Sat Jul 11 09:23:45 2015 UTC,"What's wrong with LA nova? Aside from prices having increased over time, they have many many options other than pizza. 5 pizza logs +fries for $6 is solid, at the fncenter you get only 3pizza logs for $6"
Buffalo,3cswx6,LeJourLeFroid,5,Sun Jul 12 13:48:12 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is really not funny.  Chain/local, city/suburb, and good/bad are all separate variables. There are good local restaurants in the suburbs. There are bad chain restaurants in the city. There are even good chain restaurants and bad local restaurants in both areas!  Any thought spent on city vs. suburb nonsense is such a waste. We're all in the same area and we should all want it to be as good as possible as a whole, not independently."

Buffalo,3cswx6,dumbroad,-10,Fri Jul 10 16:55:04 2015 UTC,Its satire. The fact that your offended says enough. Sad because your par-baked Panera bread loaves are shipped frozen and de-thawed while your kids play candy crush and ignore your parenting choices getting to you?
Buffalo,3cswx6,BassoonHero,8,Fri Jul 10 20:17:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure you got the joke.  Honestly, the whole thing looks misdirected. I am typing this from my desk in Orchard Park. Now that's a culinary wasteland. I ate at Panera yesterday because there is nothing but mediocre chain restaurants out here. The lunch vote today was between a pizzeria and a Greek diner.  But Amherst? Yes, it's a suburb (the horror!), but it's a diverse suburb with plenty of great food. The obsession with Niagara Falls Boulevard is a bit odd — perhaps the author never made it any further into Amherst. If that's the case, I can certainly understand how they were left with a poor impression.  We also get groundbreaking, edgy comedy. For example, isn't it funny how people in the suburbs drive cars? And how about those Buffalo Wild Wings? (Is there even one in Amherst?) And what's the deal with airline food?  It strikes me more than anything else as a parody of urban hipsters."
Buffalo,3cswx6,tritonon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:16:16 2015 UTC,"Considering NFB is split between Amherst and Tonawanda focusing on it seems weird. Technically the BWW is in Tonawanda. But also who cares if there are some chains at the Taste of Buffalo, you don't have to eat it, do you? I am going to the taste because I am only here for the summer and I will not be sampling any food I can get back home."
Buffalo,3cswx6,BassoonHero,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:01:10 2015 UTC,"Its a parody of the Taste of Buffalo, not actually having many options from Buffalo. Authenticity is lacking. If you think that Amherst is a target in this parody then your missing the bigger picture. Its a statement about a lackluster food festival (which all are anyways) by calling it the Taste of Buffalo and including national chains, it becomes anything but the Taste of Buffalo.

Buffalo,3cqzzo,Newmex,2,Sat Jul 11 00:37:30 2015 UTC,"There is a Train from the Toronto Airport to Union Stn, then a Train to Burlington Ont, then Bus from Burlington to Niagara Falls On. Short walk across the Rainbow Bridge then 1 bus 3 blocks away to Downtown Buffalo.  Only problem is that it takes about 4 1/2 hrs one way and last bus back leaves Niagara Falls Ont at 21:30.  Union-Pearson Express from Airport to Union.  Go Transit from Union to Niagara Falls Ont with transfer in Burlington.  Walk across bridge to near the Seneca Casino.  NFTA bus from Casino into Downtown Buffalo.   Another option is Via Rail  Via rail is 4.5 hrs from Union, about the same as the Go Bus but there is only 1 or maybe 2 a day, where Go Transit is every hour."
Buffalo,3cqzzo,crash866,3,Fri Jul 10 05:16:08 2015 UTC,"compared to other cities, you'd think there would be something like an express ""coaster"" from NF to Toronto that would only take two hours to ride on.

Buffalo,3cqzzo,crash866,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:01:33 2015 UTC,On weekends there is a train from Toronto Union Station direct to Niagara Falls.  Takes 2hrs 4min.  There is a Train/Bus combo with switch in Burlington.  This takes 2hrs 22min with a 10min layover at Burlington.  Fare is $18.15 one way.

It's new and is pretty amazing new orleans grub. Black Swan is a neat place. was, maybe still is, looks like it still is...per urban spoon & yelp... The Lodge is an interesting spot, similar menu to the archer. Hydraulic Hearth does mostly fire brick oven flat bread pizzas, that's a fun place to go to.    Tappo has great italian plates, really nice roof top patio + $15 bottles of wine. Seabar & Kunis for Sushi, and Sato are excellent establishments of Japanese Cuisine. Kaydara is great for pho.  Pearl street is at best good for its patio, food isn't anything to write home about.    If they love clams, Oshun is a great spot with an amazing environment.    there are most great unique spots around the city, such as Sun on Niagara which has bomb dizzle thai & black rice plates."

Come to find out they chose a more expensive tire style instead of the style ordered, and charged me way more than a couple bucks per tire.  I had to go there for a refund, manager apparently got fired.  Okay fine, accidents happen.

Buffalo,3cjzxw,etm33,3,Thu Jul 9 00:57:40 2015 UTC,How much was the total install? How many solar panels? How long until it pass for itself
Buffalo,3cjzxw,davewinkwink,3,Thu Jul 9 01:30:25 2015 UTC,"24*255Watt panels - 12 facing south, 12 facing west. $20k before the sizable incentives (I signed my contract last year, so the NYSERDA incentive was $1/watt, plus 30% Fed tax credit and 20% state tax credit). In the end it will cost me about $5k out of pocket. Payback should be 5-7 years - I'm about 20% oversized so should make a few bucks every year selling power back to the utility. My next car will be electric, so that's why I went larger."
Buffalo,3cjzxw,etm33,2,Thu Jul 9 01:58:18 2015 UTC,"Won't they need replacement in 10 years? Maintenance costs? I can't imagine they hold up well in snow. And when they do need replaced, what the heck do you do with them and how much roof damage does it do to remove them and reinstall new ones"
Buffalo,3cjzxw,ReverendBass,3,Thu Jul 9 02:39:03 2015 UTC,"They're warrantied for 25 years.  They're tempered glass over aluminum frames, so not much the snow will really do to them. Maintenance wise, the occasional spray with a hose is about it.  If you're just replacing panels, there's zero roof damage as they're mounted to racks, not the roof directly - replacing a panel is four screws/clips per panel.  If you have to remove the racks, you'd just have to reseal the screw holes and put the shingles back down (they lift one tab of the shingles to install the rack upright)."
Buffalo,3cjzxw,etm33,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:53:30 2015 UTC,"The panels are cut from giant silicon crystals (the technical name is monocrystalline photovoltaics) - and therefore could be classified as man-made stone, so they will outlast the shingles on your roof. That is also why they look glittery in sunlight.   Also, the glass is strong enough for an adult to stand on without cracking, so snow isn't ever a problem."

Good to acknowledge that slices laying around are often much different than a pie that you'd order. If the slices were sitting out for a while it'd be nice for them to at least throw it back in the oven for a few minutes if you're not in a rush...

I'm from downstate so buffalo pizzas aren't my preference, and I can bake really good pizzas. That said I almost feel guilty not buying from this guy. He always throws in free sodas, knocks off dollars from the prices, and gives away free slices to people. So I make it a point to go here whenever I do order out a  buffalo pizza.

Buffalo,3ckrcy,ReverendBass,2,Thu Jul 9 03:12:09 2015 UTC,"I agree. Just saying who this is appealing to... Personally I don't see the point of established restaurants getting in on the truck trend. (amys, chefs, 716) Are they doing ""that much more business with a truck""? Seems like a backwards business plan. Food trucks to me are best for when drunk & require ease of access to something a Lil better than mcds"

Buffalo,3ckrcy,ReverendBass,2,Sat Jul 11 04:18:49 2015 UTC,"I've never been to Chef's.  I know it's a local landmark though.  What's the verdict on this place?    When I'm at an Italian restaurant I like to order lasagna and some meatballs.  I also like penne pasta, arancini, and stuffed peppers."
Buffalo,3ckrcy,WorkAccount716,3,Wed Jul 8 19:07:52 2015 UTC,"it's good italian food, but it's become somewhat of a novelty at this point. the portions are also ridiculously huge. i just find it super boring because i feel like the food at most italian restaurants tastes the same."
Buffalo,3ckrcy,buffalo442,3,Wed Jul 8 19:24:00 2015 UTC,They've got awesome spaghetti parm and everything else is mediocre.  Their meatballs aren't impressive (go to Mulberry if you want those).  Their salads are pitiful.  But the spaghetti parm is awesome (although that might be the pound of mozzerella you get on it...) and I'll keep going back for that.
Buffalo,3ckrcy,Sabres00,3,Thu Jul 9 05:15:48 2015 UTC,"It's not really good.  They ""Parm"" the shit out of everything, and their sauce is too sweet.  If you order a salad it's lettuce, maybe a tomato if your lucky. I had a stuffed hot pepper that was actually pretty good, but it's not really a place you want to go to lunch then try and be productive at work after.  Also It's popular among Sabres players because they have private rooms for large groups and they can carbo load before a game without getting pestered."
Buffalo,3ckrcy,yancancook,3,Thu Jul 9 15:52:16 2015 UTC,Chef's sauce is meh. You'll like it if you're over 55 years old.

They're all in the same tier imo especially Ilios and santasiero's  I have a feeling most people talking in this thread haven't eaten at all these places in a while, if at all. It's a landmark, for a good reason, not like the Anchor Bar."
Buffalo,3ckrcy,sobuffalo,4,Thu Jul 9 12:53:50 2015 UTC,"Chef's really isn't that good, and I'd place it on the same tier as Franks Sunny Italy as far as quality.  I'm not sure why it's so popular, but I bet it has a lot to do with the fact that it was one of the only restaurants around that area, people equate quantity with quality, and Sabres players went there often."
Buffalo,3ckrcy,Sabres00,-1,Thu Jul 9 15:58:46 2015 UTC,When was the last time you've eaten there?  And it's in that location because it's been there since it was the Sicilian/Italian Neighborhood. You think they could last that long if they weren't good? or at least appreciated by real Italian immigrants. I suspect many of the favorites from this crowd might be Carrabbas or Pizza Hut.  people ITT seem to hate on it but don't serve up restaurants they feel are good enough.
Buffalo,3ckrcy,sobuffalo,4,Thu Jul 9 16:45:37 2015 UTC,"I have been there at least 5 times in the last year.  A few of my bosses at work really like it so I have to go when we have work lunches.  People did offer up alternatives but you shit on them.   A lot of places last long that aren't very good; like I said some people equate quantity with quality.  Since you made a broad generalization about the thread let me make one as well, I think the people who frequent Chef's generally aren't from the city. When people ask where you can get Italian food it's usually the go to answer I hear people outside the city say.  The same goes for Duffs and Salvatore's; both completely over rated and inferior to their counterparts.  People may think those are good destinations because they have never known any better."
Buffalo,3ckrcy,Sabres00,0,Thu Jul 9 20:11:00 2015 UTC,"People did offer up alternatives but you shit on them.   Where do you see that? I agreed with the ones listed but the majority of the people here don't have alternatives.  The ones I mentioned Chef's, Santasiero's, and DiTondos serve authentic Italian-American food passed on generation to generation. You can not like it, but to say they are a bad Italian restaurants is wrong. It seems to be trendy to bash on the popular, even though most times there is a reason they are popular. Duff's has good wings, denying that is disingenuous. I've never heard anyone recommend Salvatore's, although Russ's is a great steakhouse. The Anchor Bar, sure they are completely overrated but there sauce is pretty good, the wings they serve is the problem."
Buffalo,3ckrcy,LeJourLeFroid,2,Thu Jul 9 20:48:46 2015 UTC,"You said they were on par with Chef's, which I don't believe they are.  Mulberry's is way better.  I'm not bashing on popular restaurants just to be a contrarian, but Duffs wings are average and only good if you request that you want them crispy.  Most wing joints in Buffalo don't have that issue.  I could literally name 10 better wing joints then Duffs, and just as many Italian joints for Chef's, but you really wont care.  You enjoy your sugar sauce at Chef's and I'll try and get out of lunches with the boss."

Igloo, again, has been a mainstay here for a while, but it seems everyone is collabing on events lately.  The scene is great and very healthy now.  Stuff to do pretty much every week."

Buffalo,3ci8xt,irons,6,Wed Jul 8 13:47:38 2015 UTC,"Wait. Let me understand this correctly. You believe, that, OP could apply to ten jobs a day, not hear anything for a few months & they should just continue to soldier on with no means to eat or pay bills?  But their hard work will eventually be rewarded.... OP could be the most perfect worker, it does not garuntee they'll find employment quickly.     The point of public assistance isn't to live off it, it's to provide a temporary buffer when it's MOST needed & continue to find work.     Unfortunately most of the country takes advantage of it to exceedingly lazy degrees.  Just because people exploit the system doesn't mean it's purpose is for others to live off the govt. That would be like saying stop signs are optional because everyone does the west side roll at them.     Would you also advise OP not to explore the Erie County job resource center downtown?, a place where those who apply for temporary assistance are immediately directed to... what if someone were laid off during the height of winter? would you tell them, ""no, do not immediately go apply for HEAP, jobs fall out of the sky""    There's nothing wrong with applying for temporary assistance, I know plenty of successful people who had to use it due to unfortunate layoffs until they found a suitable employer.       Alas, OP would not qualify.    Also replying to me doesn't help OP get your input."

The other time, I called 4 hours ahead, to schedule a pickup to get on a plane flight.  They showed two hours after my flight departed (I had someone fetch me).  Basically, all of the cab services in the area suck, which is why we need Uber or Lyft operating, and why all the cab companies attacked Lyft when they tried to start operating here."

Pignataro  on April 20, 2013 - 11:40 PM, updated April 21, 2013 at 7:54 AM  First of a three-part series  Thirty-five years after underground toxics turned the Niagara Falls neighborhood of Love Canal into a ghost town, researchers are warning that Western New York is still home to nearly 800 hazardous waste sites that could someday lead to big trouble, not only for local residents, but for the entire Great Lakes region.  A recently completed study, believed to be the most comprehensive look ever at hazardous waste sites in Western New York, finds potential chemical hazards lurking across Erie, Niagara and Cattaraugus counties.  • Half of the world’s known radium is stored about a mile from the Lewiston-Porter schools, where approximately 2,300 students attend classes each day.  • The most deadly wastes from all over the Northeast are hauled along local roads to a dump site in Niagara County.  • Lead from a former smelting plant on East Ferry Street is believed to be linked to a deadly outbreak of lupus on Buffalo’s East Side.  • And radioactive waste from the West Valley nuclear storage facility in Cattaraugus County could someday endanger the Great Lakes.  What makes this information important and worrisome – not only to Western New Yorkers, but to tens of millions of other Americans and Canadians – is that the vast majority of these waste sites are located in the Great Lakes watershed, the largest source of fresh water in the world.  Many of the sites are either directly adjacent or close to Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, the Niagara and Buffalo rivers, or other waterways that feed the Great Lakes.  An estimated 26 million to 40 million people drink the water from the Great Lakes, which contain more than one-fifth of the world’s fresh surface water.  “It’s important … It’s overwhelming,” said Joseph A. Gardella Jr., an environmentalist and University at Buffalo chemistry professor who co-authored the study that was completed by the Western New York Environmental Alliance, the Community Foundation for Greater Buffalo and the University at Buffalo’s Urban Design Project.  “This information is a wake-up call,” said Brian P. Smith, program director for the Western New York Citizens Campaign for the Environment. “Policymakers need to look at it, digest it and find out what wastes are in their districts. We need to work to comprehensively clean up the waste in a way that is protective of public health. Protecting the Great Lakes has to be one of our top priorities.”  Some of the material is leftover from industry or war projects. And more dangerous material continues to be hauled here from elsewhere because this region has become a dumping ground for other communities’ poisons and wastes.  Among the most significant findings:  • Niagara County has more than twice as many federal- and state-designated hazardous waste sites as comparably sized counties throughout the state.  • The three counties contain 174 federal or state “Superfund” hazardous waste sites, 43 designated as “significant threats” to public health.  • Erie County has almost eight times as many brownfield cleanup sites as the average county in the state, and Niagara County has more than twice as many as the average county.  “Are we overburdened with waste? Yes, with all kinds of waste,” said Lynda H. Schneekloth, a professor at UB’s Urban Design Project. “We never knew how much of it was out there until we conducted this study.”  Niagara County, which is much smaller than the average county in the state in terms of population and area, is especially overburdened, she said.  The job of protecting people in Western New York from hazardous waste mainly falls on two watchdog agencies – the state Department of Environmental Conservation and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The DEC has a much bigger presence than the EPA in Western New York and is more actively involved on a day-to-day basis.  Despite the presence of these hundreds of waste sites, the public safety situation is “light-years better” than it was in the late 1970s, said EPA spokesman Michael J. Basile. That’s because the two agencies constantly monitor the sites, he said.  “We have better regulation of these sites, much more attention is paid to environmental issues, and we have a much better-educated public than we did in the ’70s,” Basile said. “Whether you live around the corner from a dry cleaners or an industrial waste landfill, there are environmental regulations. We work hard to enforce them. So does the state.”  Reacting to the claim that Western New York is overburdened with hazardous waste sites, Basile said he does not believe so. He added that the DEC would be better equipped to answer that question.  “I will say that, in the Northeast, there is a historical preponderance of industrial activity, whether you are talking about Buffalo, Pittsburgh or Niagara Falls,” Basile said. “[Western New York] is not the toxic capital of the world. It’s easy for someone to make that claim, but it’s not the case.”  A DEC spokeswoman declined to comment for this story, but according to Gardella, much of the data in the “Mapping Waste” study came directly from DEC records.  Much waste produced here  So how did all this waste get here in the first place? Much of it was produced here. Decades ago, during the 1900s, chemical companies were attracted to Niagara County because of the proximity to the cheap and plentiful electrical power generated by Niagara Falls. Easy access to fresh water, another key component in the chemical industry, also was important.  “Sixty years ago, Niagara Falls was like the Silicon Valley of the chemical industry. Many chemical plants were built in the city,” Schneekloth said. “It brought great wealth to the region, but also a great negative legacy. Today, the wealth is mostly gone, but the negative legacy is still with us. Love Canal is the most famous example, but there are many others.”  Another reason why Niagara County has such a big share of radioactive waste is that much of the work on the Manhattan Project, which led to the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, was done here.  After the Manhattan Project was completed, radioactive waste generated by the bomb project was gathered, then deposited and stored in the Niagara Falls Storage Site off Pletcher Road in Lewiston.  And then there is all the waste that is still being hauled here – to the Chemical Waste Management landfill in the Town of Porter – from other areas of New York State and the Northeast.  Gardella, the UB chemistry professor, suggests an inordinate number of landfills were started in Western New York because land is cheaper here than downstate. In addition, he said, the region has always lacked political clout.  “Do you think that if the [Chemical Waste Management] waste facility was in the Catskills, or on Long Island, rather than the Town of Porter, the people in New York City would tolerate it for a minute?” Gardella said. “We became the dumping ground for other parts of the state.”  Massive effort to compile  About 100 local environmental groups worked on the 223-page study. The information they examined has been available in complicated reports from a variety of government agencies for years, but never before assembled into one comprehensive report. Even the federal government has not done it before.  The study compiles information from the EPA, the DEC, the state Health Department, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Defense Department, the U.S. Department of Energy and other government agencies.  The study is based on a 2010 “snapshot” of the region’s waste sites, but there has been little change since then.  “Yes, this information has been available for years, but only in ways that are very difficult for the average person to access and decipher,” Gardella said. “We’re professionals, and we were tearing our hair out trying to make sense out of some of these government reports.”  All the government agencies – especially the state DEC – were helpful and cooperative with researchers, rather than trying to hide information, he added.  The report identifies Superfund sites as the most heavily polluted, and the study lists a total of 174 state or federal Superfund sites in the three counties.  Of those, the state DEC classifies 22 sites in Erie County, 15 sites in Niagara County and six in Cattaraugus County as “Class 2 Superfund” sites, meaning they pose a current threat to human health and are being remediated.  Many of these most serious waste sites are located near neighborhoods, schools and places of work.  In Erie County, the Class 2 Superfund sites include the American Axle plant on East Delavan Avenue, the Radio Tower site at 901 Fuhrmann Blvd. on Buffalo’s outer harbor, the Tonawanda Coke plant on River Road in the Town of Tonawanda, and the former Bethlehem Steel property at 3555 Lake Shore Drive, Lackawanna.  Class 2 Superfund sites in Niagara County include the arsenic-tainted FMC Corp. site near the Royalton-Hartland High School in Middleport, and the former Forest Glen mobile home park in Niagara Falls.  Greg Evans, 48, a disabled truck driver, has lived all his life within a few blocks of two major hazardous waste sites in Niagara Falls – the Love Canal landfill and another former Hooker Chemical waste site along the Niagara River on Buffalo Avenue.  Like many people in Niagara Falls, he is concerned about the chemical waste in his community.  “In my opinion, there are chemicals all over this city. I’ve been fortunate. I’ve never gotten sick from them,” Evans said. “I do think it’s something to be concerned about. It should be constantly studied and tested.”"
Buffalo,3caw9q,zjp_716,2,Mon Jul 6 18:13:35 2015 UTC,"Continued  Falls has most sites in state  Niagara Falls has more hazardous wastes than any other in New York State.  The EPA currently lists 211 hazardous waste cleanup sites in the state. These are sites contaminated by hazardous waste currently stored there or stored there in the past.  Twelve of those sites are in Niagara Falls. No other city, town or village in the state has more than six.  The Niagara Falls cleanup sites include the mammoth CECOS International waste dump, a huge garbage hill off the Niagara Thruway; the Durez Corp. chemical waste site off Packard Road; and the former Forest Glen mobile home park off Porter Road, where 150 people had to be relocated in the early 1990s after the discovery that toxic waste had been illegally dumped there.  Also included on the EPA’s Niagara Falls list are the Frontier Chemical waste site on Royal Avenue, where oily contaminants called non-aqueous phase liquids have been found in the groundwater; the Hooker Chemical Hyde Park site, where groundwater contains dioxin and volatile organic compounds; and the Occidental Chemical plant on Buffalo Avenue, where chlorine, caustic soda and other chemical compounds are made.  Many of the sites in Niagara Falls are close to the Niagara River, which connects lakes Erie and Ontario.  A Cattaraugus County site that concerns environmentalists is the West Valley Demonstration Project, a nuclear waste facility in the Town of Ashford. A nuclear fuel reprocessing center was operated on the site from 1966 to 1972, and radioactive waste from atomic weapons and nuclear power plants was shipped there from other regions of the U.S.  If the nuclear waste is not removed from West Valley, environmentalists warn that it will eventually leak into the region’s creeks and migrate to the Great Lakes. “This is a situation that is not going away,” said Smith, of the citizens for the environment group.  Making legislators aware  So now that this report is completed and the breadth of the poisoned sites has been identified, what to do with it?  In recent weeks, Gardella and other environmentalists associated with the study have met and briefed several legislators about problems in their communities.  “We’re going out and telling them what sites they have in their districts, what needs to be done about them and what government agencies are responsible for them,” Gardella said.  The recent Tonawanda Coke trial in federal court is seen by some as evidence that people and community groups can force government watchdog agencies to investigate and punish polluters.  Tonawanda Coke had been polluting for years at its plant along the Niagara River, but the EPA and U.S. Attorney’s Office didn’t begin major investigations until a public outcry from neighborhood residents and the Clean Air Coalition of Western New York, a grass-roots organization.  Last month, the company that runs Tonawanda Coke and a top plant official were convicted of criminally polluting the air and ground in the neighborhood. The company and the convicted official face potential fines of up to $200 million. People who live near a contamination site cannot rely on government to fix the problem, said Erin Heaney, executive director of the Clean Air Coalition.  Citizen groups such as the Clean Air Coalition and Buffalo Niagara Riverkeeper “are fantastic,” said the EPA’s Basile. “They get involved. They keep our agencies on our toes, and sometimes act as our eyes and ears.”  It’s unfortunate, Basile said, that groups such as Riverkeeper have to spend time cleaning up thousands of tons of garbage that is illegally dumped in waterways and on beaches by average citizens each year.  “That is a problem you can’t lay at the feet of government or industry,” Basile said.  In terms of government cleanup efforts at waste sites, tough and expensive decisions lie ahead.  Environmentalists admit it would cost untold billions of dollars to clean up all the contamination in Western New York. Gardella said it would cost $1.5 billion to $2 billion to clean up waste at the Niagara Falls Storage Site at 1397 Pletcher Road, where radioactive waste from the atomic bomb project, including half the world’s known radium, are stored.  “There are major decisions that have to be made all over Western New York,” said Smith, from the Western New York Citizens Campaign for the Environment. “But if we don’t clean these sites up now, they will cost us much more later.”  email: dherbeck@buffnews.com and tpignataro@buffnews.com  Link to report: http://www.buffalonews.com/assets/PDF/BN6188420.pdf - LARGE FILE ~26MB"

Buffalo,3caw9q,ProInvestCK,3,Mon Jul 6 17:23:26 2015 UTC,"As another environmental scientist who too has worked on industrial remediation, I can emphatically say that there is a big difference between closely monitoring pollution and cleaning it up.   In WNY I can only speak about the school that I atteneded.  In the case of my former school there has been testing for the presence of radionucleotides, but not other chemicals of concern that are known to be on site- such as missle and other high-energy fuels that were tested there.  And yes, they found radiological contamination on the school property which has yet to be removed (the recommended action).  Also, the outfall pipe from the former wastewater treatment plant at the waste storage site crosses the school campus and has never been evaluated for contaminants, which makes me question how 'closely monitored' some of these sites really are.  In any case, I question the wisdom of putting a school on one of these properties.  You'd think we would have learned that lesson after Love Canal.  Fortunately, my school now has a commercial hazardous waste dump between the it and and the former military radiological waste dump to protect the children (it makes a great site, being already contaminated- just pile it on!)."

CoB gave them 15 dark fibers back in the day along the 33, with the agreement they would service Buffalo.  Verizon took those fibers, ran with it out to the first-ring suburbs where their executive team lives, did FiOS, and then said,""Well, never mind brah, but thanks for that free fiber!"""

Buffalo,3c8t3o,buffalocentric,8,Mon Jul 6 06:45:32 2015 UTC,The only way TWC will be challenged in the city is if 1. Google Fiber comes in. 2. We get Muni Fiber. That's about it. How local cable monopolies are allowed to exist is such a joke.
Buffalo,3c8t3o,SoBuffaloRes,2,Mon Jul 6 03:13:25 2015 UTC,"They are allowed to exist because there is only so much room on poles and in conduits.  Could you imagine 45 different providers, each with their own cabling on the electric poles?"
Buffalo,3c8t3o,buffalocentric,3,Mon Jul 6 11:10:29 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure other companies share resources, just one is the reseller and pays maintenance and fees to the owner. There wouldn't be 45 lines to the poles."
Buffalo,3c8t3o,SoBuffaloRes,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:32:40 2015 UTC,"Then, you still have a monopoly...  Only one organization can own the cable, you'd just have others leasing it.  Which they can do today.  Buffalo has a rather extensive fiber network that anyone can lease."
Buffalo,3c8t3o,nemoomen,3,Mon Jul 6 12:02:33 2015 UTC,"I can't explain it, but I can add some information. I moved from a suburban FIOS area to the city, a pretty nice area, and I couldn't get FIOS there even though the market is probably even better than the suburb I was in. When asking my friends and coworkers about it, they said that Verizon FIOS can't come in to Buffalo unless they come into ALL of Buffalo. So they can't come into North Buffalo and Elmwood but not the East Side. So that's why they stop at the suburbs."
Buffalo,3c8t3o,flancresty,2,Sun Jul 5 23:56:23 2015 UTC,"Definitely not true, I got FIOS installed in my North Buffalo house last week and am writing this using that connection. 75/75 is pretty sweet.

Buffalo,3c8t3o,pete716,3,Mon Jul 6 21:01:56 2015 UTC,"I reached out to both a city of Buffalo councilman and Verizon a couple of years ago and here are the replies.  From City of Buffalo:    ""There has been a misinformation campaign by Verizon to falsely claim that somehow the City of Buffalo is preventing them from providing service to our residents. You can find the whole story at www.dontbypassbuffalo.com .   The reason they have not moved to the city is not officially clear on their part, but I can assure that the City is not the problem. We have sponsored several resolutions not only encouraging FiOS to move to the city, but also demanding that they comply with state law. The telecom is supposed to have moved into the municipality within five years of providing service to nearby suburbs. Clearly, they have not, nor do they have any infrastructure in place that would indicate plans to do so.  Fiber optics and other infrastructure is expensive to install. It is alleged that their decision has a lot to do with the city's high percentage of low-income and minority residents, especially compared to that of the suburbs where they have provided service. Again, nothing is officially clear. All I can tell you is that the City of Buffalo is in no way obstructing the company from providing service.""   From Verizon:   ""Thank you for being a FiOScustomer.  Unfortunately, Verizon does not hold a franchise agreement with the City ofBuffalo to provide FiOS TV.  We do not need a franchise to provide FiOS Internet. Right now, the company is focusing on completing the so-called buildout commitment we have with the 182 towns/villages/cities in the state where we do have franchise agreements, rather than seeking new franchises.  I realize this is not the answer you were hoping for, but that is where we currently are.  John Bonomo Director-Verizon Media Relations"""

There is probably more to this deal he didn't know about.  Of course, here is an article saying that it isn't worth the cost for Verizon to build networks in the city."

Also most people who have FIOS pay less in their first year and have a hard time keeping that rate after.  I've been paying TWC $41 for the last 3 years for internet and service has been good."

Buffalo,3c8t3o,LonelyNixon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:15:03 2015 UTC,This isn't just a downtown thing it's all over the country. In NYC for example there are blocks which are comcast territory and ones which are time Warner. The cable companies collude with each other to keep prices high an not having to really compete with each other.   The issue with fios is that Verizon stopped laying down fiber a fe years ago so there are huge holes in coverage.   In short we really need Google fiber to come an liberate us.

What you get for the money, though, wow, that is well short of excellent.  To answer your question, no one else has run cable or fiber in the city, so that's why.  It's not like other companies are prohibited from doing so; there just (apparently) is not enough of a profit motive to get them to do it."
Buffalo,3c8t3o,irons,6,Mon Jul 6 00:16:47 2015 UTC,"I've dealt with Time Warner's outsourced Indian phone operators and have gone to their DT Buffalo office. The service was awful in both instances. At their office, you take a ticket and wait for a miserable lady to tell you what to do. It's either TW internet or no internet.Since they have their customers in such a stranglehold, we're not treated like customers at all. They have no incentive to provide a good experience or a good product. They operate similar to public services like the DMV or town courts or the like, where ""customers"" have no choice and are thus subjected to being treated like cattle."
Buffalo,3c8t3o,sobuffalo,2,Mon Jul 6 00:47:02 2015 UTC,"I think your comparison is a disservice to the DVM. Their customer is much better than it was 15+ years ago. Anyone remember the 1 hour queue with terrible fluorescent lighting at the AppleTree?  While I've only reasonable to good service with TW (after getting past teir 1), I know I'm the outlier. TW, ""At least we aren't Comcast!""  It's the nature of having an oligarchy control a utility. However, the cost is real with the rental of rightaway (pole or underground), infrastructure, cost per turn up, and maintenance. Then add on how bad consumers can be about paying their bill on time or at all. This makes companies not want to pay the money up front to built into aging cities.  Verizon has halted all new cable roll outs nationwide as much as possible. This is both fiber and copper. They are betting on the ability to roll out neighborhood wireless or better cell tech in the next decade. Check their original plans after hurricane Sandy to see the prototype of what they want to do. Without bringing new fiber or copper this gets them out of under a number of FCC regulations that cover physical delivery.  The only way you are going to get out of TW's grasp is either pay up front for someone to run fiber to your prem or get Muni-broadband started."

We're looking at a home that is in a newer development of William Street."
Buffalo,3c9clo,buffalo442,2,Mon Jul 6 11:33:18 2015 UTC,The front part of the middle school is old - very old.  But it's been added on to a number of times and the interior has been renovated over the years.  I actually liked the building when I went there - weird layout that gave it some character.  The area around the middle school is pretty nice.  99 Brick Oven across the street has great wood-fired pizza.  A few blocks behind the middle school is Como Park.
Buffalo,3c9clo,buffalo442,5,Tue Jul 7 00:14:15 2015 UTC,"Grew up in Lancaster.  It's a great place to live.  I'm not sure where you drove through, but the majority is not old or beat up.  The village tends to be older but is much smaller than the town, most of the town is newer (80's through present) residential.  The ""downtown"" part of the Village along Central is small, but has events for the major holidays that are fun.  Unfortunately it doesn't really have decent bars or restaurants, but that's not what most people living in Lancaster are looking for (there are decent bars/restaurants in Lancaster, but they're not in the downtown area of the village).  There are no bad areas of Lancaster in terms of safety whatsoever.  You mention, ""I'm concerned about the areas we'd be driving through to get there.""  What do you mean by this?  If it's a safety concern, there is zero reason to be concerned.  There is no area of Lancaster that I wouldn't feel safe walking around alone at night - or letting a kid walk around alone at night for that matter- unless you count the small section of Depew that technically falls into the town of Lancaster (most people from Lancaster would not consider that to be Lancaster).  The only not-so-good section of Depew is Main St. west of Sawyer.  My neighbor is a Lancaster cop and the most excitement they deal with is shoplifting from WalMart and prostitution at the hotels on Transit along the Thruway.  So...what appeals to me about it?  I'd say for one, the school system.  As embarrassed as I am about the whole Redskin thing (fueled mostly by people who seemingly never moved on from high school), it's an excellent school district.  Although Clarence has excellent schools too, and Amherst schools are all pretty good - especially Williamsville (but Amherst and Sweet Home are good too).  I did my K-12 at Lancaster and it really does have a lot to offer, especially as the kids get into high school.  The housing is also generally affordable with a lot of nice neighborhoods.  The kind of streets where everybody knows each other and your kids can play hockey in the street.  If you live in Clarence or Williamsville, you're probably going to be paying more.  The drawbacks?  For me, the only one is depending on where you live, you may not be particularly close to a lot of things.  If you live on the northern end of Lancaster - near the high school - you're not far from the Thruway or all of the stuff on Transit.  But if you live in East Lancaster - especially say east of Central and south of Walden, it adds another 5-10 minutes to get anywhere.  Even going to Tops on Broadway can be about 10 minutes away.  Downtown is a good 25 minutes. But - at the same time, if you live in most parts of Clarence, you're going to be even further.  I guess I'm comparing it to living in West Amherst though - since that's where I moved after Lancaster.  All in all, can only say good things about Lancaster.  I grew up there and it was great for a family, and the schools are great."
Buffalo,3c9clo,haydenv,5,Mon Jul 6 05:34:28 2015 UTC,"All of these have really good schools. Lancaster is located closer to basically everything. I moved from Lancaster to Clarence and I need to drive an extra 20 minutes in each direction to get almost anywhere. I miss the central location of Lancaster. Yes, the village is all old houses and old people but there are some nice new developments that are really close to everything.   Don't forget to weigh in property taxes and drive time.   Clarence is probably the most scenic one. Drive down Goodrich or main street. Just remember that you will need to take the traffic on transit road to get anywhere. It's the only major north south road.   For me, Clarence is a more premium place to live, but you pay for it with money and time spent driving. I lived by Lancaster high school and I was spoiled. It seemed like it was 15 minutes from everywhere.   Seeing that I grew up in Lancaster and now live in Clarence, I would be very happy to answer any questions your family might have! Welcome to the area :) Sorry if I repeated myself!"
Buffalo,3c9clo,FancyAndImportantMan,2,Mon Jul 6 03:45:51 2015 UTC,"I sub in the Lancaster schools (And at the William Street school right near where you are looking). It's a really well-run district, most of the kids are good and respectful (a few shitheads here and there, but what school doesn't have them). My only concern is that it is so big. The high school has like 2000 students, and overcrowding in the elementary schools has been an issue. Also some of the buildings are pretty old and outdated. (Except for William Street; built like 20 years ago and has AC!)  Lancaster itself is nice enough, but a bit too suburby for me to live there.  It's close enough to places in Cheektowaga and Depew, but can be a bit of a pain sometimes to get to the city (About a half hour drive). My advice would be to take the 190/90 to the City and back, rather than the 33 and 198."
Buffalo,3c9clo,buffalo442,2,Mon Jul 6 13:05:00 2015 UTC,"As a former student of the district, being so big was an advantage.  Once you get to the high school, that allows them to offer more classes and activities.  They have a ton of AP classes, plus the pre-engineering Project Lead The Way program, Academy of Finance, etc.  I don't think you'll see as much of that from a smaller district.  Seconded on taking the 190, unless you live north of Walden/near the high school in which case the 33 would make more sense.  From anywhere south of that, Como Park to Bennett to Union to William and getting on the 90 is fastest.  Very little traffic that way."
Buffalo,3c9clo,FancyAndImportantMan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:17:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah there is no doubt that they are able to offer a lot more programs because of their size.

Buffalo,3c9clo,BillsInATL,2,Tue Jul 7 00:21:56 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing you drove through Depew to get to Lancaster/The Village. I currently live in Depew, about 100ft over the border to Lancaster. If I head down my street towards Lancaster, the houses are all very nice, new curbs on the street, sidewalks taken care of, etc. If I head the other way deeper into Depew, it gets kinda ghetto and trashy very quickly.  Lancaster and Depew are tied together pretty closely, and even share some services. Depew being the more blue-collar part and Lancaster being the much nicer part.  That being said, Lancaster is a great lace to live. Your taxes do not go to waste in any way. Great schools, great town services, very quick to make repairs and keep up the streets/curbs/sidewalks, etc. The entire town (and even Depew) is incredibly safe and quiet. The Village is a great little bonus and they regularly hold parades and festivals. For housing prices, you really cant go wrong."

I challenge you to give the fish fry a chance at the moose lodge next to the fire house.

Buffalo,3c8re4,716in619,3,Mon Jul 6 04:52:01 2015 UTC,Just buy the car and then have someone teach you.   Buy a car that you don't know how to operate?  That's like buying shoes you haven't tried on . . .

Buffalo,3c8re4,LonelyNixon,4,Thu Jul 9 01:33:08 2015 UTC,"I would never let someone learn on my manual, rent one for a day -- if rental companies even offer manuals anymore"
Buffalo,3c8re4,stakoverflo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:02:45 2015 UTC,I mean I don't think it needs to be your daily to get the basics down but you probably will need a few sessions and eventually take the car out into actual roads to really learn. Nothing like being stopped on a hill with someone up your butt to teach you how to minimize rolling back while you engage the clutch.   That said I don't have a manual and if I did I wouldn't put it in a strangers hands on the Internet.
Buffalo,3c8re4,poprocksandkim,4,Tue Jul 7 13:39:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly it's pretty simple. Clutch in, put it in gear, rev to 1.5-2K, let out the clutch and go. First gear is the hardest, you're not really going to stall with the others.  Then it's just a matter of ""fine tuning"" that technique and getting faster and smoother and learning exactly when / where your car specifically catches.  If you haven't already, you can find lots of videos on this on YouTube. Of course watching and doing are two different things, but it's honestly not so difficult."
Buffalo,3c8re4,Isvara,2,Mon Jul 6 10:44:23 2015 UTC,"Your best bet is to test drive the car with an automatic transmission to make sure you like the feel of the car (space, size, interior, etc) and then buy the same model with a standard transmission. When you get your car is when you get to learn. You'll be hard pressed to find someone willing to let a new driver burn the clutch on their car unless they don't care about it. If that's the case you don't want to learn on a car with a beat up clutch anyways because it will not be the same feel as when you buy your car. You will learn as you go, take your time and remember that if you don't get it the first day the car will still be there tomorrow."
Buffalo,3c8re4,poprocksandkim,2,Mon Jul 6 06:49:53 2015 UTC,"If you're teaching someone properly, you're not going to get anything like a burned out clutch."
Buffalo,3c8re4,Isvara,2,Mon Jul 6 08:26:55 2015 UTC,"You can be the best teacher and still not want to risk someone damaging your car. Burned clutch was one example. Not saying it would for sure happen, but I don't want someone else grinding the gears on my car or making it stall multiple times because they can't get the balance between the clutch and the gas pedal. If you're so confident offer up your car as the guinea pig."

Buffalo,3c70xd,rbroni88,10,Mon Jul 6 03:32:46 2015 UTC,"The vast majority are gang related, so its pretty easily avoidable.  Just avoid the worst areas of the east side at night and you should be fine. During the day you should be fine as long as you mind your own business. A lot of the east side is more abandoned than it is dangerous. There are also pockets of very nice neighborhoods too.  The Westside used to be similar not too long ago. However, the Westside is smaller, is gentrifying rapidly and they recently cracked down hard on gangs.  Homicides are much rarer in North, South and ""Central"" Buffalo, but obviously it spills over from time to time.  Honestly, even the worse of Buffalo's neighborhoods are not even close to as bad as other cities. I think the low cost of living and plentiful minimum wage jobs - see Canadian shoppers - prevent most people from getting too desperate."

Buffalo,3c70xd,rbroni88,2,Mon Jul 6 16:00:45 2015 UTC,"It depends where on the West Side she was looking. There are some very rough and tumble parts to be sure. The trouble is you can't really pin down what areas are specifically good and bad. The best I can tell you is that west of Grant is generally still rough, but again, some streets are better than others. Ones I would avoid would be Herkimer, Hampshire, parts of Rhode island and Vermont. Not even because they're inherently dangerous, but there a lot of houses owned by slumlords who don't care for their properties and tenants.   I can also say that appearances are deceiving. My block doesn't look the best. There's a vacant lot across the street, two houses are abandoned/vacant, the one next to me is not lived in (there've been people taking stuff out of it every so often for a couple of months, but no for sale signs or anything, and its exterior is in great shape), and another is owned by an LLC from California and it needs some TLC. That said, there is NO crime on this street. One of the neighbors got into an argument with his mother-in-law the day moved in, a couple of weeks ago a couple of cars almost crashed at the intersection and the drivers yelled at each other for 10 minutes. That's it. It is the most peaceful, quiet street I've ever lived on. Go figure.  So I guess the point is to keep an open mind. I cringed when I was on the phone with (at the time) my prospective landlord and he told me where it was located. But I checked it out, decided it was the place for me, and I have not regretted it for a second.  So with that, I would say anywhere Baynes Street and east is definitely a safe bet. Hoyt also isn't a bad option. Specifically, look for places on Potomac, Lafayette, and Delavan in that boundary. There's nice places west of Baynes, but that's where it gets more fuzzy.  Also in the City, there's Elmwood Village and Allentown, very popular (albeit a tad busy/noisy) with young couples. You should be able to find a reasonable 2br in that area. I also neglected to mention the Lower West Side. Generally, I would look south of Connecticut and East of Niagara (in the 14201 area code). Finally, there's North Buffalo, which is close to Amherst, but it's not really for me. Nice area, a lot of people love it, but relying on Elmwood, Main, and Delaware as your main arterials gets annoying after a while.  That's all I can think of. Good luck on your search!"

Buffalo,3bxniy,slimmons,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:11:51 2015 UTC,"The glaring problem is that Linwood is a one-way street and there are two bike lanes, one for each direction. Running against traffic in that situation when a.) you're in a bike bike lane and b.) there are sidewalks isn't bright. Someone (me) backing out of their driveway onto Linwood, is looking south for oncoming cars and bikes. Runners are way less visible running behind that line of cars you have to breach as a driver. It's just a bad idea, and I've nearly clipped a runner who wasn't paying attention running against traffic in, again, a BIKE lane."

Bicycles are self propelled vehicles generally moving at a pace faster than pedestrians and are far more visible (which is why you walk against traffic and bike with it). No child under like 10 belongs on the road in my opinion anyway (and obviously dependent on if we're talking about a residential block or a thru street with higher traffic).
Buffalo,3bxniy,naus226,3,Tue Jul 7 16:09:44 2015 UTC,Well they don't belong on the sidewalks. Thats for people with waxed mustaches and roller skates.
Buffalo,3bxniy,Eudaimonics,15,Tue Jul 7 16:36:02 2015 UTC,"Huge pet peeve... There's a sidewalk 5ft away. I'd rather walk on a bumpy sidewalk then have to push my kid in a wheelchair for the rest of their life or worse...  A couple years ago during the winter a kid was struck by a car on NF Blvd because he was walking in the streets, it happens in an instant.  People like this infuriate me"
Buffalo,3bxniy,naus226,8,Fri Jul 3 01:04:29 2015 UTC,"Winter is different. Buffalo doesn't enforce its laws concerning sidewalk snow removal.  It's dangerous sure, but in this case pedestrians have more of a reason to be out in the street."
Buffalo,3bxniy,Grooth,2,Fri Jul 3 16:16:12 2015 UTC,"Winter is the ONLY time it might be acceptable, but only if the walk isn't cleared. People will walk in the street even with a cleared walk. That. Is. Infuriating."
Buffalo,3bxniy,ahronzombi,2,Sat Jul 4 00:13:18 2015 UTC,"I get that, but there is actually laws and regulations for snow removal on sidewalks for businesses and even citizens. Just because they are barely enforced (the incident I mentioned caused the city of Amherst to issue a warning that all businesses WILL be fined if sidewalks weren't cleared) doesn't make it OK. I'd still rather trudge through snow then take a Subaru to the face."
Buffalo,3bxniy,LeJourLeFroid,3,Sat Jul 4 02:43:44 2015 UTC,The city should start a snow brigade. They would shovel the sidewalks of unshoveled houses and then fine them.   The fines would go towards funding the snow brigade and subsidize snow removal for homes of seniors and the disabled.  The city could also offer snow removal services for a fee and get some money back into their coffers.
Buffalo,3bxniy,FancyAndImportantMan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:31:23 2015 UTC,Quit thinking logically! You know this city doesn't do that!
Buffalo,3bxniy,LeJourLeFroid,11,Sat Jul 4 16:37:19 2015 UTC,"I can sort of understand it if you're in the hood and it's winter, there's a lot of abandoned homes on the east side that don't get shoveled. Some places it's impossible to use the sidewalks. But in the middle of summer on fucking Linwood is ridiculous. Especially with children."
Buffalo,3bxniy,chubes,9,Fri Jul 3 01:25:36 2015 UTC,"Amen! Thank you its not just me. Buffalo and the surrounding areas have a lot of dumb fucks that walk in the road even with kids. We have lots of sidewalks and they aren't covered in snow all year, tickets need to be written, this is a serious public safety issue and having lived in other parts of the country before I found Buffalo its a local issue, just like the bad taste in food."
Buffalo,3bxniy,Stanczyki,5,Fri Jul 3 12:28:21 2015 UTC,"Yea. It's weird imo, if someone falls becoming injured due to a fault in the walk, they'll have better chances going after the home owner (if that's your thing) than going after the city for reparation. Then again I can see it being an active ""protest"" of locals to get drivers to slow down on their streets. It's not something that can really be enforced until someone gets hit by a car. Same goes for bicyclists riding the wrong way on one ways where a lane is not painted."
Buffalo,3bxniy,KnivesAndShallots,7,Fri Jul 3 01:14:41 2015 UTC,"Same goes for bicyclists riding the wrong way on one ways where a lane is not painted.   That is such a nuisance.

Buffalo,3bxniy,CholentPot,2,Fri Jul 3 11:49:08 2015 UTC,Unpopular opinion: All the vitriol here directed at the people who walk in the street would be better focused at the city for not providing sidewalks that work for the user base.  Are the sidewalks wide enough for people to walk side-by-side? Did the city plant species of tree whose roots are less llikely to damage the sidewalks? Is the planting space for the trees big enough? Are there ramps to the street at every intersection for strollers and wheelchairs?    Also sadly amusing how it never seems to be the fault of the automobile driver for any accidents or deaths that occur on our streets.  If you're in the street and not in a car it's somehow your fault. Ok.
Buffalo,3bxniy,716in619,3,Fri Jul 3 17:34:40 2015 UTC,"The people in this picture are in a parking lane - not a travel lane - and separated from traffic by a 3' wide bicycle lane. On a 30mph, one-way residential street. The sidewalk on some major roads is closer to traffic than this.   Sometimes humans on foot or on bicycles, or using roller blades, wheelchairs, etc are going to be in or near or crossing the street. That's the difference between a residential street and a highway. The more appropriate PSA here is: drive carefully on residential streets because sometimes things that are not cars are using them. The sooner we all realize this, the safer we'll all be.   And texting drivers should be shot on sight. Fuck those guys."
Buffalo,3bxniy,unclexbenny,8,Fri Jul 3 01:28:52 2015 UTC,The people in this picture are in a parking lane - not a travel lane   Parking lanes are subject to become travel lanes when there are no parked vehicles in them . . .
Buffalo,3bxniy,Harvey6ft,7,Fri Jul 3 08:26:08 2015 UTC,The point was that there's less risk when on the sidewalk. Who would want to take the chance of being hit by a distracted driver?
Buffalo,3bxniy,plastiqmanb,6,Fri Jul 3 02:10:08 2015 UTC,"Also, they are in both the parking lane and the bike lane. Inches from the driving area."
Buffalo,3bxniy,The_Silmarillion,10,Fri Jul 3 02:10:21 2015 UTC,"I am not following your logic. Does a distracted or a drunk driver care that they are standing in a parking lane? They are called accidents be ause they are not on purpose. This is not adults who are chatting, THERE ARE TWO INFANTS IN STROLLERS!!!! In a perfect world, all drivers would would pay attention on residential streets but come on, the sidewalk is literally right there.   Also, on the 198, there was a completely preventable toddler who died after being struck by an in attentive driver. There was much more separation than this.   I can't believe you are defending these people risking the lives of their children over a bumpy sidewalk. And the kids weren't even sleeping!"

If you're gonna get hit, you're gonna get hit. See Delaware park.   But, don't be an idiot. The street is not a place to congregate."

It's relaxing to go 30 or 35mph on the road and just leisurely get home after a long day.  When it was 55mph, people would crash, slam on their brakes, and merge very dangerously on every ramp.  None of that happens anymore and I like it."
Buffalo,3bxvuk,tryingtohelp2010,3,Fri Jul 3 15:15:37 2015 UTC,"I noted the same on the 198 after the speed reduction:  It was calm, and relaxing to drive on.  No white-knuckling like before."

We could save a few accidents by making the 190 speed limit 30 or the 90 speed limit 30, but that would be dumb because its a highway and its meant to function as such. They put the guard rails where they should have been in the first place, now either turn it back into a highway or turn it into a parkway. But don't leave it as a highway where your stuck doing 30."
Buffalo,3bxvuk,buffaloUB,4,Fri Jul 3 23:14:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you. 30 is fucking ridiculous. It's a highway. People drive 45 on main street and nobody bats an eye. At least make the speed limit 40 outside of Delaware park. I'm willing to go less than 50 because it is a tricky stretch, but not 30. People just need to learn how to drive.

Buffalo,3bxvuk,Kindness4Weakness,3,Sat Jul 4 06:47:46 2015 UTC,I try to avoid that road as much as possible. What a mess. It's faster to get out to Elmwood by going down to the end of the 33 than to go across the constantly jammed 198.

Buffalo,3bxvuk,FancyAndImportantMan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:56:17 2015 UTC,Depends where I'm headed. Ferry can be quick. Other times if I'm going further south on Elmwood I'll just go to the end and get off there.
Buffalo,3bxvuk,nicktoberfest,3,Fri Jul 3 17:02:10 2015 UTC,I just don't get why it would have to go back up.  So many people slam on their brakes at the 190 interchange anyway. Just keep it 30 throughout. People will still get to work on time.
Buffalo,3bxvuk,CunderscoreF,7,Fri Jul 3 02:37:44 2015 UTC,It's kinda ridiculous to have thirty from Elmwood to the 190

Buffalo,3bxvuk,CunderscoreF,3,Fri Jul 3 12:14:09 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's also a question of ~ 2 miles, which means going from 60 to 30 is a question of 2 minutes driving time. that's it. all this hubbub over 120 seconds."

The only argument I've seen to keep the speed low is that people drive poorly on it...just like they do everywhere else. The problem was the lack of guardrails near the park, not people driving a highway at normal speeds. If they want people to do thirty they need to turn it back into a parkway as it was originally intended."
Buffalo,3bxvuk,buffaloUB,4,Fri Jul 3 23:09:28 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't be a highway.  you say there is no reason to go 30 on a highway.

Buffalo,3bxvuk,CunderscoreF,4,Fri Jul 3 23:53:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah well unfortunately it is a highway. If we're going to have an ugly highway cutting through the park, we ought to use it as a highway.

Buffalo,3btcsx,Vocal_Minority,-4,Fri Jul 3 22:08:26 2015 UTC,I take my dog to the south western portion of Delaware park. Near the casino and the lake. I let her off the leash there and see other dogs off leash as well. Everyone is friendly. The thing I worry about most are cyclist going way too fast on the pedestrian walk-way. The park really should have off-leash hours from 9 PM - 9 AM.
Buffalo,3btcsx,KnivesAndShallots,7,Thu Jul 2 12:27:23 2015 UTC,"Technically, you are the one who is acting illegally, not the bikers. Dogs are not allowed off leash in Delaware Park. Bikers are allowed on the pedestrian paths."
Buffalo,3btcsx,Vocal_Minority,-7,Thu Jul 2 13:44:31 2015 UTC,I know what I am doing and I never said they were riding their illegally. Although it should be illegal to ride bikes on the narrow loop.
Buffalo,3btcsx,KnivesAndShallots,3,Thu Jul 2 17:21:43 2015 UTC,"Maybe you do, but I stopped biking through Delaware park because of careless dog owners who thought they knew how their dogs would react to a bicyclist.  I have been chased many times and knocked over a few times by dogs off leash.    I used to bike with my on-leash dog through Delaware park (which is totally legal), and every single time an off leash dog would chase us.    Maybe you're the exception, but why don't you just take your dog to the dog park? Dogs are not always as predictable as you think, and if you're wrong about your dog, you're taking an awful lot of risk and liability just to save a five minute drive to LaSalle park. Not to mention that a cop will ticket you if he sees you with an off leash dog."
Buffalo,3btcsx,Vocal_Minority,-5,Thu Jul 2 17:37:31 2015 UTC,I don't go to lasalle park because I don't want to stand around and breath urine dust.
Buffalo,3btcsx,TOMALTACH,4,Thu Jul 2 17:50:50 2015 UTC,then go to black rock canal park dog park
Buffalo,3btcsx,flancresty,5,Thu Jul 2 18:36:23 2015 UTC,"The park really should have off-leash hours from 9 PM - 9 AM.   No, no it should not. Go to a dog park if you want off-leash park, off-leash dogs negatively impact other park users in a number of ways, and indeed are a hazard to the cyclists who are actually using the park legally and as intended."
Buffalo,3btcsx,Vocal_Minority,0,Thu Jul 2 16:50:52 2015 UTC,"What ways do off leash dogs negatively impact other park users?   Note, i am only discussing the portion of the park that goes around the lake. Please tell me how bicycles going 15-25 mph down a narrow path is good for people walking their dogs (on leash or off), people with small children, elderly people who cannot move quickly, runners who may be focused on their run, and people using the walkway to actually walk.  Buffalo needs to do a number of things to improve the park   Remove the freeway and make it a greenway. Remove the golf course and make it more park like. Add vendors to the park grounds. Put off leash hours. Increase the infrastructure in the park (playgrounds, benches, tables, water fountains, restrooms)."
Buffalo,3btcsx,flancresty,7,Thu Jul 2 17:20:21 2015 UTC,"The path is for bikes so your question is like asking how it's good for pedestrians to allow cars to go 30 mph on the street.  As for how off leash dogs negatively impact others:  1.) They shit and their owners are unaware (or indifferent) and leave it behind. 2.) They approach children and others who don't know that your little precious Lassie is well trained, has an owner, and is not a threat to them. 3.) They run across the bike path without sense or regard for bike traffic, endangering those on bikes who despite your wishes, are using the paths as intended, traveling at speed. 4.) They approach owners with leashed dogs, potentially exciting the leashed dogs and causing problems for their owners. 5.) They run into traffic, creating hazardous conditions for the drivers. 6.) It's against the law.    I fully acknowledge that a responsible dog owner can address most of these issues. But we don't make our rules for the best of us, we make it for the worst of us. And certainly bad dog owners are out there, are terrible, and ruin it for more responsible dog owners, likely giving many of you a bad rap. But so goes the world, we could have many, nicer things if some people weren't shitty.  Feel free to petition for all those ideas, until then, don't be selfish, follow the park rules that were established for everyone.  And by the way, Delaware Park closes at 10p, so your proposal for overnight off-leash hours is a non-starter."
Buffalo,3btcsx,Vocal_Minority,0,Thu Jul 2 17:31:28 2015 UTC,"Maybe part of the problem is that there is a bike path around the lake and no pedestrian walk way. But I dunno, I guess I am just crazy.  Also,where are you getting your information that the path around Hoyt Lake is intended for bicycles rather than pedestrians? There are no signs, there are no lines to show direction for bicycles to travel, and there are benches along the path. There is literally nothing to indicate it is intended for bicycles."
Buffalo,3btcsx,TOMALTACH,6,Thu Jul 2 17:51:51 2015 UTC,"to /u/flancresty's point   4.) They approach owners with leashed dogs, potentially exciting the leashed dogs and causing problems for their owners.   my dogs are great, but that doesnt mean they like EVERY other dog.  And I really don't want to deal with a raging piss & vinegar reaction every time i'm out for a walk with my dogs.      go to a dogpark if you want to let your dog off leash. it's selfish to say that everyone should abide by your ideals of ""off leash hours.""    what about people who are afraid of dogs? or simply just aren't as loving of them as some of us are? are they just suppose to endure the event when your dog runs up to them, harassing them to meet them?"
Buffalo,3btcsx,Vocal_Minority,-1,Thu Jul 2 18:19:47 2015 UTC,"Maybe this is not tactful but you deal with it. I meet people and talk to people that I have absolutely no desire to deal with be I deal with them. I don't think they should stay inside and away from me all the time. When a disabled person comes up to me and is friendly, I don't always want to talk but guess what I do? I act nice and deal with it. I know it will be temporary and my life will go on.   Dogs coming up to me or being around are not that big of a deal. Especially during specific hours. I am Not saying it should be 24 hours. If you are scared of dogs or have a problem in general, don't go during those hours. I am sure there are people who had large crowds who want to enjoy canal side on Thursday but they stay away.  We shouldn't cater to this unknown minority of people that may or may not have a problem. Let them deal with it.  On a slightly related note, I did a quick google search of cities with off leash hours for public parks: Portland, Austin, nyc, San Diego, and Minneapolis.   Let's get with the times guys. Off leash dogs are not going to ruin everyone's park experience. It will add to it.  Ugh typos. I am on mobile, figure it out."
Buffalo,3btcsx,ooppoop,2,Thu Jul 2 20:43:29 2015 UTC,"Wow. That's callous as fuck. ""don't go to parks during those times"" Fortunately the parks are for everyone, not what you think who they should be for"
Buffalo,3btcsx,Vocal_Minority,0,Thu Jul 2 22:17:31 2015 UTC,"But we all already don't go to the parks for various reasons at various times. Everyone can go to the park at all times but many people choose not to. That doesn't mean the park shouldn't host those events because a small vocal minority of people cannot use the park exactly as they wish during that period of time. That is what makes the park great and why there should be even more things to do at the park. Everyone should be able to find a time and activity to use the park as they wish. There should be places that nothing happens and there should be places for playgrounds, and dining, and walking, and sports. It doesn't mean you have to love those activities or enjoy them. Just allow other people to do it as long as t minimally interferes with your ability to do what you want. And unfortunately, there are a small minority of people that will be so fervently against that activity that you enjoy and they will not use the park. But that is a balance that needs to be made.  We live with people all around us, all the time. If we try to make everyone happy, nobody will be happy. Sometimes you just have to deal with things you don't like because we live in a city. That is what makes city living great. You are forced to be exposed to things you don't necessarily like and you can't do anything about it. You just move on. But you come away knowing that those people and experiences are out there. Your world is broadened."
Buffalo,3btcsx,ooppoop,3,Thu Jul 2 22:38:06 2015 UTC,tldr what you seek are called dog parks.
Buffalo,3btcsx,Vocal_Minority,-2,Thu Jul 2 22:42:34 2015 UTC,"No, they are fenced in areas of gravel, covered in urine, with a bunch of people and dogs standing around with their thumbs up their ass. The dogs aren't exercising and neither are the people.I want to walk/exercise my dog off leash in the park with the birds, animals, water, maybe meet some people, drink my coffee, and plan my day out."
Buffalo,3btcsx,ooppoop,5,Thu Jul 2 22:47:38 2015 UTC,"Dog parks AREN'T for exercise, they're for socialization. & they're much less for people to exercise... Wtf. Ohhh right you want your dog to just shit anywhere even if that means you don't see it & never pick it up.     If you're so focused with dogs exercising Maybe you ought to get YOUR thumb out of your butt and go activate those dogs. If you want to exercise with your dog go exercise with your dog on a leash. Hundreds other people don't have a problem with it.   What you want is not what the majority wants fucking abide. Dude. I hope you get cited one day."
Buffalo,3btcsx,Bryan____,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:03:01 2015 UTC,I take my dog there on off hours when there's not many people there usually just other dogs. I stay away from the bike path and the casino unless the dog is swimming and then go back to the gravel paths in the southern section.  Have some courtesy for leashed dogs and other people using the park and you'll be fine. I try to stay to myself when we go. It is much more exciting than the dog park downtown but I don't go after 11am so its usually early on the weekends when no one is there.

Buffalo,3btifv,alawa,-7,Thu Jul 2 14:29:57 2015 UTC,There is no nutrient that you need to get from animal products. You're probably just deficient in some nutrient because you aren't paying any attention to what you eat. It's not that hard. There is no such thing as a farm that treats animals well.
Buffalo,3btifv,Yellowed,14,Thu Jul 2 01:30:29 2015 UTC,"Bullshit. There are several local farmers taking fantastic care of their animals. Creatures that have one bad moment in their lives. I lived and worked on farms, and these people are taking amazing care of their livestock.   T-Meadow Farms (Lockport) Oles Farm (Alden) Autumn Harvest (can't remember)  I appreciate and understand the vegan mentality and lifestyle, but there are humanely treated animals. The pigs at T-Meadow spend their days running around eating fruit that falls off of trees and mowing down on spent grain from Pearl Street and CBW."

There's this thing called ""The Circle of life"", and for better or worse, we are a part of that circle, and we fall into the section for predators.  There's a reason we have canine teeth and molars.  We are omnivores.  And, FWIW, most farm animals has been so tightly bred to us, that they would die if left to their own devices.  Cows don't even know how to have sex.  Chickens would be the bird equivalent of rats.  Pigs would destroy every last farm if left to run wild."

It's not a matter of ""we might as well kill them"". The ""Circle of life"" of a song from the Lion King that doesn't have any greater meaning than that. We are not preyed upon by any animal.   There's a reason we have canine teeth and molars. We are omnivores.   I don't want to go deeper into an appeal to nature, but nothing about our teeth would imply we have an ability to tear raw flesh. Horses also have canine teeth. Humans are different from other omnivores because we need to cook meat in order to eat it. Google ""Bears Teeth"" to see what an omnivores teeth look like.   And, FWIW, most farm animals has been so tightly bred to us, that they would die if left to their own devices.   Like I said before, these animals aren't just popping up, we intensively breed them."

Buffalo,3btifv,ReverendBass,3,Thu Jul 2 02:26:33 2015 UTC,http://atlanta.cbslocal.com/2014/04/01/study-vegetarians-less-healthy-lower-quality-of-life-than-meat-eaters/
Buffalo,3btifv,lemonyellowdavinci,0,Thu Jul 2 15:00:57 2015 UTC,"All the major dietetics and health organizations in the world agree that vegan and vegetarian diets are just as healthy as omnivorous diets. Here are links to what some of them have to say on the subject:  American Dietetic Association   It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.   Dietitians of Canada   A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.   The British National Health Service   With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.   The British Nutrition Foundation   A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.    The Dietitians Association of Australia   Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.   The United States Department of Agriculture   Vegetarian diets (see context) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.    The National Health and Medical Research Council   Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians, these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.   The Mayo Clinic   A well-planned vegetarian diet (see context) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.    The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada   Vegetarian diets (see context) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits.   Harvard Medical School   Traditionally, research into vegetarianism focused mainly on potential nutritional deficiencies, but in recent years, the pendulum has swung the other way, and studies are confirming the health benefits of meat-free eating. Nowadays, plant-based eating is recognized as not only nutritionally sufficient but also as a way to reduce the risk for many chronic illnesses."
Buffalo,3btifv,alawa,2,Thu Jul 2 15:17:33 2015 UTC,Is this what he asked? There are amino acids and other vitamins that  non meat proteins do not provide. There are farms that let animals freely graze but they ultimately are killed for food. They are animals.
Buffalo,3btifv,lemonyellowdavinci,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:39:12 2015 UTC,Vitamin B12 is only found in animal products. Strict vegetarians and vegans are recommended to take a supplement or use fortified nutritional yeast to get adequate amounts.
Buffalo,3btifv,alawa,2,Thu Jul 2 01:33:59 2015 UTC,I know. B12 supplements usually don't come from animals.
Buffalo,3btifv,SoBuffaloRes,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:38:46 2015 UTC,"Sure, but if you're trying to meet all your requirements just by eating whole foods then that's kind of a misleading statement. Not meant to be argumentative, just stating what could be unclear."
Buffalo,3btifv,boxxa,-1,Thu Jul 2 01:49:17 2015 UTC,"I guess, but there's nothing about veganism that implies you can't take supplements so I don't get why it's unclear."

Buffalo,3bpujf,abbeycrombie,3,Wed Jul 1 04:38:53 2015 UTC,"I have one and drive it all year and I live in the southtowns. With snow tires, the thing is a tank in the snow. Rear Wheel Drive with the engine mounted over the rear axle means that you get the benefits of Front wheel drive (all the weight over the drive wheels) with the benefits of rear wheel drive (the front tires are actually free to do their job of steering the car without losing traction because of the snow) You're also right on the 14,000 price figure. I lease mine for like $110 a month."
Buffalo,3bpujf,schwidley,2,Wed Jul 1 12:09:24 2015 UTC,Thanks for the help!  How long have you had it for?
Buffalo,3bpujf,allegedmark,2,Wed Jul 1 14:53:47 2015 UTC,"Just my thoughts. In a city the size of buffalo with the winters we get, a smart car is not a smart choice. They are relatively expensive, not super reliable and really don't get very good gas mileage for their size. For less money you can buy a few much better small cars. I'd personally recommend checking out a Ford Fiesta hatch, it'll still fit in many small spots most cars can't fit in and gets much better gas mileage. Even if you never have more than two people in your car the back seats fold down and give you quite a bit of storage. Winter will be manageable with all seasons but I'd recommend throwing winters on it which shouldn't cost any more than $300-$350 and will last you a few seasons ."
Buffalo,3bpujf,allegedmark,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:18:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help!  I think the Smart Car is about $14,000.  Are there more inexpensive cars?  I had trouble with my Fit at first in the snow, but once I got snow tires, it was a lot better.  I still sometimes have trouble, but it's doable.  I live downtown (near the highway though), but I do 95% of my driving in the North Towns."
Buffalo,3bpujf,buffalosmellslikesqu,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:21:53 2015 UTC,"That 14000 sounds like a heavy discount or used i think, I thought they were going for closer to 17 or 18k. The problem with smaller cars even with winter is what I encountered this weekend . I own a 500 Abarth and the winters were necessary but in heavy snow falls it falls for two reasons, ground clearance and weight. I can only imagine the Smart Car is worse. Ground clearance id imagine to be just as bad and the weight much worse. Going through heavy snow, the weight of the Smart Car is going to be bad. The car ends up not having enough weight to get traction"
Buffalo,3bpujf,CaleYarborough,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:42:45 2015 UTC,Just a couple reasons you're wrong. The smart cars are rear wheel drive your 500 is FWD. That means the weight is over drive wheels in the smart and not in your fiat.  The smarts also have crazy narrow wheels which cut through the snow very well.  I would said the smart cars would be MUCH better in the snow than your fiat. If seen them cruise through over a foot with out snow tires on them. Source:  I worked for Mercedes Benz
Buffalo,3bpujf,CaleYarborough,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:54:44 2015 UTC,"Car enthusiast here! If all you want is the cheapest possible car, I'd say go take a look at either the Nissan Versa or the Mitsubishi Mirage. Neither of them are especially nice cars, but they'll get you from A to B.  If you want something a little nicer, I'd highly advise that you go check out the Chevy Spark.  And, if you go up in price a little bit, there's also the Ford Fiesta, Toyota Yaris, Chevy Sonic,and the Scion iA (which is actually just a Mazda, but the Mazda isn't sold in the US.)  I really would not recommend the Smart Car. While I think they're interesting little cars, they're not a great deal. For $14k you get no luggage space, no back seat, and poor gas mileage (for something of its size).Additionally, they're lightweight, rear wheel drive, and have a short wheelbase. Ultimately, this means they are going to be pretty skittish in the snow.   Lastly, Buffalo is not a very dense or crowded city, and it's got lots of large freeways and boulevards full of pickup trucks. Obviously, this is just not an environment that plays to the Smart's size advantages."
Buffalo,3bpujf,CaleYarborough,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:26:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I'm looking for an inexpensive, reliable, hatchback looking car.  I don't really like American cars for some reason.  Thank you for the help!  I just started my car search.  What are your thoughts on the Toyota Prius C?"
Buffalo,3bpujf,tc1955,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:27:32 2015 UTC,"The Prius C is really just a Yaris  with a hybrid drivetrain. Both are pretty decent cars, but you may want to check out the regular Yaris along with the Prius to see if it's worth paying the premium for the hybrid. The Yaris already gets pretty great gas mileage as it is, but if you have your mind set on a hybrid, then there's nothing wrong with the C."

Buffalo,3bn7su,shakedownshakin,5,Tue Jun 30 16:01:49 2015 UTC,"Barton Inn is close enough to walk. Most people end up having to park farther away.  Lewiston is a nice charming village. Lots of restaurants and boutiques. Quite a few bars for afterwards too.  I've never had a problem with admissions, so don't worry too much about that. They will probably go on at 8 or 8:30, but obviously there is never any guarantee of this.  If you have time, check out Old Fort Niagara in Youngstown to the North, or hike the Niagara Gorge at Devil's Hole State Park (bring a good pair of sneakers/hiking boots) to the South.  Or you can just hit up the wine trail which is always fun.  Do you know how you're getting to Lewiston? Public transportation is pretty sparse out there, but there is a single bus line that will take you to the village. NFTA Bus 50 Main - Niagara. You would however need to first take either Route 40 (Buffalo-Niagara Falls) or Route 60 (Niagara Falls Express) and then transfer. A taxi is going to be at least $100 from Buffalo-Niagara International. Renting a car is obviously the easiest option and gives you the most mobility."

Buffalo,3bn7su,Yellowed,2,Tue Jun 30 17:03:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks...I was a bit surprised to see the show lets out so early, was really hoping for a later night kind of thing especially for this show, they usually have a crazy light show synced up to their set.  I have been to lewiston and remember it being very nice but it was many years ago, since the show lets out early I am hoping we can find a bar or two to keep the night going.    I was thinking of the gorge hike as it is pretty amazing or if the weather on Thursday is nice I might do the jet boat,  previously live in b-lo for 25 years and it is one of the things I never did but kind of regret having not done.    The wine trail is also a good call."
Buffalo,3bn7su,blackpony04,5,Tue Jun 30 16:24:53 2015 UTC,"They let out early because it's a quiet, residential town, and it takes forever to get all the traffic out."
Buffalo,3bn7su,blackpony04,5,Tue Jun 30 17:01:17 2015 UTC,"Resident of Lewiston here so I can confirm everything Eudaimonics indicated is dead on and you can't beat the location as far as the concert goes. There's always an opening act and the concert will be over by 10PM since it's smack dab in the middle of a quiet village. Definitely walkable and I highly recommend some pre-concert drinking at Water Street Landing which is about a hundred yards are so from your hotel. They have an outside bar right on the river and you'll definitely enjoy the atmosphere. As for hiking, I recommend the Whirlpool over Devil's Hole (the staircase alone makes the difference but the view at the Whirlpool itself is phenomenal). You can also take a brief hike from the trail just south of Artpark and walk along the river below the Lewiston-Queenston bridge and that one is an easy trail (seriously the staircases at the other parks are ridiculously out of kilter). As long as the weather holds out you're sure to have a good time. And even then, I've killed many brain cells at Water Street and you can do that rain or shine!  EDIT: As for the Jet-Boat, try the new one (Niagara Jet Adventures) in Youngstown 7 miles to the north (just follow River Rd. from Lewiston). They're awesome and your money would stay in that village versus the other jet boats which are owned by a Canadian company (if that matters to you)."
Buffalo,3bn7su,blackpony04,2,Tue Jun 30 19:17:15 2015 UTC,"Any recommendations for post show cocktails, maybe some live music or something interesting to do, we are kind of late nighters so kind of hoping there is something for us to do locally after the show.    I know the whirlpool/devils hole very well, did a lot of fishing in the area when I lived in Buffalo, good call on the hikes though definitely some really cool areas to explore.  I remember the staircases in some of the parks being pretty bad 10-15 years ago and can imagine if they have not done some work on them by now they are just about blown out completely.    If the weather is good we were thinking about riding the jet boat, it is something I always wanted to do when we lived there and just never got around to doing.  Think it's worth it?"
Buffalo,3bn7su,blackpony04,2,Tue Jun 30 19:29:54 2015 UTC,"The Brickyard BBQ is about 2 blocks from your hotel and they offer a huge selection of beer and phenomenal BBQ. I'm a regular at Water Street during non-tourist months and their pub menu is really good too but they tend to close earlier. Either one is close enough to safely stumble back to the hotel from and I'm fairly sure Brickyard stays open really late (2AM I think is max). As a townie I don't go down to Water Street in the summer so I'm not sure how late they stay open as it depends on business.   And yeah, the staircases haven't been touched and are an adventure themselves. Whirlpool requires more effort but the reward is amazing as you can sit right at the water's edge with the rapids to your left and the whirlpool right in front of you. If you're looking for light walking definitely do the trail above Artpark (at the end of the upper parking lot) as it's less cumbersome and still very pretty. Either jet boat is fun and the one in Lewiston is based right out of Water Street but I know the one in Youngstown is brand spanking new and I've been told it's better. It ain't cheap but I don't think either of them are and yeah, it's worth it (although I haven't been on the Youngstown one)."
Buffalo,3bn7su,kryzchek,2,Tue Jun 30 19:40:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks...Will check those places out, sounds like we will try and get a good buzz on before the show and hit the BBQ place after...it looks pretty close which is good cause I plan on doing a fair bit of drinking.  Not to continue to bother you but is security tight at Artpark, if i stash a flask of whiskey in my waistband or pocket will it be discovered?  I see they sell beer and wine but i prefer the hard stuff."
Buffalo,3bn7su,kryzchek,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:53:54 2015 UTC,Admittedly I haven't gone yet this year so I'm not sure how security is but last year it was fairly lax so you can probably get away with it.  Someone else would have to chime in though as I don't remember if you get wanded or just a cursory look over for coolers and obvious stuff. Venue prices really aren't too bad relatively speaking either way....  Be sure to enjoy yourself! You'll probably like Lewiston as it's a walking village and the two bar/restaurants I mentioned are my two favorites in town. Heads up that Water Street is 2 restaurants in one with 3 bars total. The left side is more fancy with a $20-30 price per plate but the right side is pub priced from $8-15 and I really like their food. The BBQ joint is from $8-30 and if you leave there hungry there's something wrong with you!

Buffalo,3bghwj,jkthird,2,Wed Jul 1 03:57:49 2015 UTC,"Correct. Some interesting facts: If your cooking food over it even marshmallows or hot dogs it's not the same because you are cooking. So keep food near by.  Ensure that your fire pit isn't overhanging any tree's, make sure your surround it with rocks to create a fire barrier if it's in the ground.  If you have a fire pit that is made out of metal make sure the exposed flame is covered.   Some like my own have an open top. At one point there was a screen to prevent embers from escaping. So I went to HomeDropYourMoney and got the mesh screen folded it twice and cut out a shape and shoved it in. Problem solved.  Also make sure you have stone under your firepit if it's on grass. So if you have a patio with concrete your set. Otherwise I'd go grab one of those landscape pavers that's about 2'x2' square. This way if they complain about it not being on a hard surface your covered.  Though if they want to tell you to stop they can. I know all my neighbors where I've lived the last 10 years so I'm good.  But when I lived on Richmond as a renter me and one, just one friend, tried to use a firepit and my neighbors called the police on us.  So keep it in the backyard out of sight of nosey neighbors that have nothing better to do than report stupid stuff.   Something I found from 2007 BUFFALO FIRE DEPARTMENT BUFFALO FIRE DEPARTMENT Michael Lombardo, Commissioner Michael Lombardo, Commissioner  DEPARTMENTAL RESPONSE: DEPARTMENTAL RESPONSE: • Open burning is prohibited with within City limits. This includes in City limits. This includes the use of fire pots, chimneys, open pits and outdoor the use of fireplaces.  Use of these devices for cooking is not permitted as a means to circumvent the ban on these devices.  • Barbeque grills or hibachis are to be used for cooking only, and are not to be used to maintain any form of recreational fire.  •Failure to abide by these regulations will result in fines up to $450 and/or possible court action being taken by the Fire Prevention Bureau."

I've needed to have it set up a total of three times in my apartment (roommate who has the Internet in their name always seems to move out), and it has gotten insanely easy. First time we had a service call, took about an hour maybe? Second time, same thing but it was because we were upgrading to much faster internet. Third time they sent us the router and cables in the mail and it took about 10 minutes for a self install. If your house isn't already wired for fios it might take a little longer."

We switched from Adelphia to Verizon DSL when it was available then upgraded to FiOS when it first came to our neighborhood (before they offered TV).  Connection was insanely solid, the only drop was when they accidentally disconnected us while installing a neighbors.  Speeds were always consistent, and generally better than what I paid for.  Eventually we got the TV package when they offered it and that was really good too, particularly the on-demand stuff.  Fast forward to now and I'm stick in an apartment that only offers TWC.  I miss FiOS so much.  Get FiOS, you won't regret it."
Buffalo,3bcjr1,cryonine,2,Sun Jun 28 03:32:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, the internet is much, much better.  And it won't cut out because the fiber is run directly to your house - you don't have to worry about interference on the cable or weak signals.  And I almost always get the advertised speed, even during the peak hours.  I think their network is actually equipped to handle it."

Which means if you get a ticket you have to go to court and plead not guilty, if you are found guilty it will cost you an additional $85.  The only way to really be found not guilty is to hope that the ticketing officer does not show up, or as I witnessed the officer shows up in sweat pants and forgets everything.  The only other time people may get let off is if they hire a lawyer. You pretty much have no chance to get out of the ticket because the judge takes the officers side no matter what.  It could be that the people I watched argue their case were unmatched intellectually, but the few times I did see a person make a good case they were found guilty.  So basically the way it was before was a $85+fine bet on whether or not the officer was going to show up."

Buffalo,3b85kx,Eudaimonics,15,Fri Jun 26 19:11:54 2015 UTC,"This article is fear mongering. A driver could fall asleep and hit someone LITERALLY ANYWHERE. The fact that the speed limit was reduced by 40% is a sad joke. The concrete barriers should have been there from the start, but making a highway slow to a crawl does nothing but increase congestion while feigning safety. Guess what happens when a driver falls asleep doing 30 and hits someone? The same result."
Buffalo,3b85kx,MyDogShitsTigers,3,Fri Jun 26 22:39:19 2015 UTC,"If you try to make this sane argument out loud people start asking you why you want to kill children. It's ridiculous all around. One death and it's a ""deadly expressway""? What does that make Main Street? A slaughter house?"
Buffalo,3b85kx,guiridelnorte,8,Fri Jun 26 22:52:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can't win any of these arguments.  It's like you can't have a nuanced opinion, it has to be one side or the other.  I support keeping it a 50 mph expressway with proper barriers until they come up with a design and start building a proper parkway.  But I guess I just want to murder kids in the meantime."

Buffalo,3b85kx,ooppoop,3,Sat Jun 27 13:40:26 2015 UTC,I think the long term strategy is to cause congestion in the short term so less and less people use the expressway.   Then over time they can shrink it and ultimately get rid of it in favor of expanding the park.
Buffalo,3b85kx,Braxo,3,Sat Jun 27 12:22:36 2015 UTC,"The long-term strategy is to return it to a parkway, as it was originally designed to be."
Buffalo,3b85kx,SoBuffaloRes,3,Mon Jun 29 11:15:26 2015 UTC,"I said this a few weeks ago and was called heartless and stupid.   Look, I drive this road every day. 30mph on a road without stop signs and streetlights is stupid. I find the road more dangerous now than beforehand. There is no way to patrol to limit and the few that follow it are messing up the flow. People now are swapping lanes more often to move around the slow rollers. Either shut the road down altogether or deal with a normalized speed limit. going from 50 to 30 was knee jerk. 40mph would make more sense. We're moving slower on this road than on Colvin or Sheridan."
Buffalo,3b85kx,CholentPot,2,Sun Jun 28 23:51:36 2015 UTC,"Moving slower on the 198 than on Sheridan or Colvin?  I recently drove on the 198 from end to end.  Overall, my trip was about 4 minutes longer than it used to be.  There weren't ""a few that follow"" the limit either.  Most everyone was.  The few who weren't kept getting hung up between cars that were following the limit."
Buffalo,3b85kx,SoBuffaloRes,2,Mon Jun 29 11:12:28 2015 UTC,"My recent drives on the 198 didn't seem like there was additional congestion.  In fact, there was less congestion than previously.  The only congested spot was the Delaware exit going westbound, which has always been congested due to the poor design of the exit and intersection.  That being said, it's no longer a highway, nor should it ever have been.  It's something we'll adapt to.  And, it only adds a few minutes to your trip if you are driving it end-to-end.  Otherwise, it's no different than taking any of the parallel routes to it now."
Buffalo,3b85kx,SoBuffaloRes,6,Mon Jun 29 11:14:54 2015 UTC,yeah. a highway in the middle of the park is stupid. probably even more stupid than a highway taking up wayyy too much waterfront property.

For 8.50 for 2 slices and a drink, I think is a great deal. Their slices of pizza are generally twice the size of anywhere else. I was there at least once a week when in school, and the staff always knew me by name, and would usually toss an extra slice in with my combo if one of them seemed ""small"".   I usually get their special pizzas because they are always delicious. The blue cheese chicken pizza is my favorite for sure."

As a couple examples, marriage before a priest and witnesses was only required after the Council of Trent in 1563.  Prior to 1184 marriage wasn't even a sacrament and the church was not especially involved in marriage."

Buffalo,3b1y6w,ReverendBass,2,Thu Jun 25 20:07:40 2015 UTC,Why not just go to the beach to tan? If you don't go into the water you'll be fine.  And to be honest cases of people actually getting sick from Lake Water doesn't really happen. Or happens with such infrequency that its statistically negligible.   If your goal is to avoid polluted water then you should probably stick to a place like Delaware Park.  Lake Erie is actually the least polluted of the Great Lakes because it is so shallow.

Buffalo,3b0h1k,nobody2000,2,Thu Jun 25 04:46:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why you're being downvoted. You're right.  I've had the (mis)fortune of being able to go to clubs in other cities, and of course in Buffalo. We don't have anything that compares. Personally, I hate clubs, so I couldn't care less about whether we have them or not, but I've been dragged to them on work trips, and here. I'd much prefer Allen's bars, which are definitely not considered ""clubs."" I've never been to the gay bars, so I can't comment on them.  Yes - they're overpriced. Yes - they're full of kids. The other people should know that, well, people actually like that.   What you generally don't get in Buffalo that you'd get at clubs in larger cities:   Multiple environments/themes in one building. Pure came close back in the day, but mostly we have what equates to a simple bar with loud music. Skilled bartenders. I don't mean ""mixologists"" I mean someone who can do more than just throw two ingredients together and serve you a drink. Buffalo bartenders tend to simply be looks only. Outside of the city, they hire for looks+skill (and they compensate accordingly).  Exclusivity. If you're not wearing a hat, can pay the cover, and you have an ID that says you're 21, you're in most clubs in Buffalo. Outside of Buffalo, clubs tend to be at least slightly more exclusive. If you can get into an exclusive club, there's a better chance that it's a 1:1 ratio of guys:girls. Non-exclusive clubs are full of bros.   I get why we can't sustain a club. We don't have good public transportation, and the college kids who would go to clubs all live in Amherst. Depending on the vacancies on Chippewa and the time of year, the street can get quite boring on a Thursday night or a Friday night...it's not always bumpin'."

Buffalo,3b0h1k,Eudaimonics,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:57:44 2015 UTC,"UB Kids go down to Chippewa and Allen all the time to get trashed. Obviously, they would be out more often if they didn't live in Amherst though. Most of the new College themed bars near UB North are filled with middle aged men.  They won't spend more money than they need to however, so large clubs are not going to do well either way...except on the main drinking holidays or if they get some good talent.  These large clubs are also not the type of places where your average college student is hanging out every week either (they'd quickly go bankrupt). Even in NYC, you're more likely see college kids in smaller cheaper clubs. The large expensive ones are filled with the wealthy socialites, tourists and young adults celebrating special occasions.  If Buffalo had more tourists downtown and had a large population of young wealthy socialites (which it does have a small growing population of) then we could support more large clubs.  Right now, looks like Lift is the best we can do."

He was a very nice guy and a hard worker (he kept asking when he could come to finish the fence when my backyard was buried under 7 feet of snow last year). The positive to vinyl is that you don't really have to do anything to it, I haven't stained my fence yet but I'm sure the process will suck. I personally think wood looks nicer."

In other words, the just-world hypothesis is the tendency to attribute consequences to—or expect consequences as the result of—a universal force that restores moral balance. This belief generally implies that in the existence of cosmic justice, destiny, divine providence, desert, stability, or order, and has high potential to result in fallacy, especially when used to rationalize people's misfortune on the grounds that they ""deserve"" it.

Buffalo,3amnws,mpwac,6,Sun Jun 21 18:53:50 2015 UTC,"I recommend using a U-lock as your primary device. While a thicker bar is better, one thing to avoid is a large lock as it is easier to gain leverage and break.  Also, always test the structure you are locking to as to ensure it cannot be moved or broken."
Buffalo,3amnws,FancyAndImportantMan,5,Sun Jun 21 18:56:32 2015 UTC,"I'll vouch for that, I have a U-Lock and that thing is a monster.  Also, keep your bike inside, especially if you have security system. I keep my bike on my enclosed front porch, and even though it's visible, there have been no attempts to steal it to my knowledge because I have a security system on (And signs/stickers for it everywhere)."
Buffalo,3amnws,iretasup,5,Sun Jun 21 19:33:19 2015 UTC,"To add:  When using a U-lock (or any lock for that matter) wrap the lock around your back tire and your frame and secure it. These are the most important pieces of the bike. Losing your front tire is better than losing the whole piece (if you have quick release or easily removal wheels). Also, if you are with another person always try to double lock your bikes together."
Buffalo,3amnws,j_la,2,Sun Jun 21 21:20:23 2015 UTC,"When I am out and about, I combine my U-lock with a study carbon fiber cable. It has loops on the end that I can run the prongs of the U-lock through. I loop it from wheel to wheel (since they are quick release) and that does the trick. What I like about it is that it doesn't add a lot of weight to my rides."

However, you increase your odds of keeping your bike by a lot if you use a Kryptonite u-lock combined with a cable lock and hook them up to something solid. There are a lot of people using simple cable locks out there, so if you throw a solid u-lock on your bike it's not going to be very appealing to a thief."

But I'm posting here because I think this is important--if you smile at Starchild, that's really all that's necessary to make his day.  I remember the first time I met him in Delaware park a little over a decade ago. He told me about his ""everything is love"" experience. Then I asked him where reality lay (I was coming down from an acid trip, okay?). He responded that reality is ""in a smile"".  Seriously, all you need to do to make Starchild's day is smile at him. I know he's tough to interact with. Honestly, I've had conversations with a friend of mine who has become convinced that he's on the autism spectrum.   I've spent hours and hours listening to him. I've hung out at his house (his mom's place). I've gone on trips with him (not recommended). And I can guarantee you that if you just smile at him and tell him that you don't want to talk right now (you might need to say it twice. and be direct about it, as he doesn't understand hints), he'll wander off happily to find someone else to talk to.  edit: I just looked at your username. leaving my comment anyway."

On the other side, there obviously will have to be some way to prevent this law from being used in inappropriate situations, like if someone leaves their dog in the car for only 10 minutes while grabbing something. How will this issue be dealt with? Is there a minimum time you have to wait before you can break a window?"
Buffalo,3ag1n7,PoorAuthor9,7,Sat Jun 20 01:32:41 2015 UTC,This is the problem. I know left my dog in the car with all the windows cracked at night for 15 minutes while I grabbed a pizza. A woman came in freaking out about there was a confrontation the pizza place asked her to leave she didn't the police were called. I'm worried this crazy woman would have used this as an excuse to break my window
Buffalo,3ag1n7,dew22,3,Sat Jun 20 02:43:24 2015 UTC,10 minutes is all it takes to get to a dangerous temp on a summer day...
Buffalo,3ag1n7,SoBuffaloRes,2,Sat Jun 20 23:23:54 2015 UTC,"IIRC, you have to call the police first before you break through the window. This lets them know who you are and what you did, and then use you as a witness in their investigation. I expect the police would provide you all the answers you need at that point."
Buffalo,3ag1n7,TRMeson,2,Sat Jun 20 03:33:30 2015 UTC,"There has to be some very specific ""guidelines"" otherwise anyone could simply wait for someone to park, leave their car & then immediately go smash a window.   At least a thorough education to the general public of what to look for, specifically. All animals pant, hell, walking my short haired dogs, they pant & people who see em say ""they need water"" which I love cause they have mobile bowls, I'll pour some out watch them ignore it & not drink & thank those strangers for advising what my dogs did not require at that moment.     obvious indicators to merit property damage ie: all windows not opened at least six inches (depending on size of animal & it's temperament, far enough that the animal cannot escape or cause harm to people it may be suspicious of, barking/snarling at), the animal must be showing clear signs of distress such as laying down & clearly hypoxic (labored breathing), slow moving, not alert, perhaps whining & so on.  I would hope as another person pointed out, you would need to contact authorities prior to doing anything, I'm sure they would then instruct based on questions of inspection.     I had a friend who left their dog in their vehicle for about 30min with Windows at least 4"" open on a 65° day. Despite the dog being clearly happy, active, alert & interested to meet the officers on scene, they reported that the dog appeared distressed.    An officer may tell you that if there isn't any clear evidence that the animal has access to water, that it's a problem. So, leaving water bowl in the vehicle may deter problems for owners in those short time period absences.   If there isn't clear evidence that an animal is in distress, than nobody had the right to do anything, especially if they are incapable of providing ""aid"" ; I could see someone breaking the window & an animal attacking that person, then it being put down for its defense of property or I could see an animal escaping from its ""rescuer"" putting the animal at risk on the streets &  causing unnecessary stress for the owner, on top of property damage."

Buffalo,3agd3s,CunderscoreF,5,Fri Jun 19 23:01:39 2015 UTC,"It's something subject to discussion, given that language is fluid and has different meanings in different contexts, but modernly the term ""queer"" has been used to describe anyone who is not heterosexual or cisgender (gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and many more). This is how I'm using the term, and for the record I am a queer person.  Of course, one should be mindful of the use. Saying someone is ""a queer person"" vs. saying someone is ""a queer"" has different weight to it. I'm not ""a queer"" but ""a queer person."" And of course, with anything relating to this topic, I can only speak for myself as far as preferences go. I imagine different parts of the US use different terminology, but this is the terminology I've come to see from my time talking to folks who identify as queer, and in gender studies literature."

Buffalo,3acf4z,Buffalo14202,3,Fri Jun 19 03:00:38 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to see this conversation.  There needs to be something done about getting designated smoking areas in the Canalside area. Over 21 acres of open space and no smoking area??   Cigarettes are legal. Smoking is not against the law. The venue is outside in wide open space. Serving alcohol and not permitting smoking is a slippery slope. People smoke and people are going to smoke.    Concerns about second hand smoke are understandable, however if people are not given a designated area, they will smoke in bathrooms and port-o-potties, thus exposing unsuspecting nonsmokers to second hand smoke. Kind of defeats the purpose doesn't it?  If a designated area is not provided, people will designate their own.  Providing a clearly designated and marked smoking area with receptacles will prevent smokers from being near non-smokers and contain the waste that will otherwise be littered  Consider other major venues that provide smoking areas (i.e. Dodgers Stadium, Fenway Park, Arrowhead Stadium). Managements at these places have learned to co-exist and that by providing a designate area, they are regulating more that flat out prohibition.   The money Canalside is wasting on overzealous, robotic ""security"" officers could be used to provide designated smoking areas where they can legally enjoy a cigarette instead of hiding like a teenager in a high school bathroom.  Is no secret that the funds used to improve Canalside were State monies reserved for Bass Pro and were TAXPAYER CASH. These are PUBLIC MONIES.  16.6% of New Yorkers smoke cigarettes; with 22.7% of those smokers in Western New York, more than anywhere else in the state. (Source: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)).  Smokers are part of the public and pay taxes too. THEY PAY MORE!  In fact, many projects would not exist if not for cigarette taxes. It is no secret that recent hikes in cigarette taxes resulted in money that was slated for other programs to be reallocated (misallocated?) to projects, including Bass Pro (now Canalside).  Not to mention $105 million from the New York State Power Authority -- A utility provider funded by every citizen who has no choice but to use electricity.  Cigarette smokers are regular people who are going to spend money on $6 beers, pay for your VIP tickets, and spend money at Canalside.  It is discrimination that a person cannot engage in a perfectly legal activity on a public space that is funded by public monies.  This illegal ban essentially refutes the very people who have contributed to what Canalside has become; and are the same people who would otherwise come there to spend money.  We have all paid into the same pot and should all be able to reap the same results. They should a least designate a corner to smoke in."

Buffalo,3abyy3,FancyAndImportantMan,3,Thu Jun 18 22:22:05 2015 UTC,"Founding fathers is my favorite. Beer is a bit pricey there though. Food is amazing (get the steak sandwich) and free nachos with plenty of toppings every night I believe. Also, best bartender in Buffalo. He loves presidential trivia and the place is covered in American history memorabilia.  The pink is a cheap dive bar known as a (ex) drug den kinda. It's not riddled with drugs and addicts anymore, and is the last stop on any night out on Allen. It picks up after midnight and peaks around 2-4am. It's mostly younger hipster types but all walks of life go there. Also known to have the best steak sandwich in Buffalo, but I've never had it and still recommend founding fathers sandwich instead.  The other place I'd suggest is brick bar. It's a regular bar that gathers big crowds at night with plenty of pool and darts and cheap beer. It's usually my first stop when I go out on Allen. It has a huge bar and another mini bar in the back.  Oh, also Allen street hardware is good. They have a good old school hiphop dj Saturdays(?) and it gets quite cramped. But it's a cool place and has good food during the day and good drink selections.  A couple miles up elmwood you'll find some more bars worth checking out if you feel like venturing that far. Mcgarretts has a big draft selection and is a classic dive with pool and darts and foosball. Same with Goodbar. Coles is a tiny bit more expensive with mostly young professional types but it's a great place. Blue monk has the best beer selection in Buffalo, but you definitely pay for it. Always a good crowd and definitely worth going.   Edit: I can't speak on any ""thirsty thirsty"" deals for any of these bars, except I know Mcgarretts has 2 for $6 I think."

Is it necessary to break down the history of the pink?  It's a great place to hang & everyone goes through not strictly hipsters, though, a Lil dark & dreary for anything prior to 10am. Definitely the pink & the brick. Frizzys also.    The pinks steak sandwich is the best in the city, medium rare, the works, & hb sauce to dip in, well worth $12. Close second is ff's steak sandwich then maybe century grill.  I don't know how you can recommend one sandwich over another which you have never consumed.     nitzches & whatever is/was the bend also for cheap beers."

And in reality the history is what makes it the pink. It's not even called the pink anymore and people still call it the pink or the old pink. The history is what makes it a buffalo staple. If someone opened that bar today it would be closed in a month. It's the history/culture that makes it what it is. Don't be mad at me for describing it.  And I said it's a hipster hang out but everyone goes there. You argued and agreed with me at the same time?!   And of course I'd only recommend a sandwich I've had instead of one I didn't have. I fully disclosed that the pink is known to have the best, but I can only recommend founding fathers because that's the only I've had.  Are you the owner of the pink or something? Damn! Lol"

There's not a ton to do right now, but it's definitely worth checking out of you have a some time. The views of the river are amazing."

Buffalo,3a9fhk,TOMALTACH,4,Fri Jun 19 14:42:29 2015 UTC,"they're pretty damn good considering they're massive, loaded and inexpensive."

Buffalo,3a9fhk,OhSnapItsRJ,4,Thu Jun 18 12:42:51 2015 UTC,"I live near here, and after craving a meatball sub from reading this topic decided to give this place a go. Definitely recommended. Their bread could use improving, and I'm sure Wegmans/Dibellas would beat it here, but there is a 0% chance they beat the meatballs. Some of the best meatballs I've ever had. $8.16 for the full sub, absolutely worth it."

That includes hot water tank, gas clothes dryer and gas oven/stove usage.  Very very lucky that the previous owner had all that done (I found the invoice for the work, $8k including the furnace and hot water tank) so having 69F even in the worst of the winter didn't break the bank...

Im also wondering how many are using fireplaces since a lot of houses I see have them. My current house doesnt but we use electric oil radiators and keep the base thermostat temp low, but comfortable, about 65 degrees, on bad days we put it up to 75 when we are home but only to get the temp up then we lower it again.   I posted this because a big reason Im moving up there is that the cost of living was low, but I do know its colder and was curious if heating a home breaks the bank or not, which I can see that varies. I would invest in properly insulating the house I get if it needs it, new windows, insulation on the siding of the house with panels to cover it and in the attic. Thats what we did a few years ago and it significantly cut the heating costs."

Some UB undergrads go there every week during the semester. If you're looking to play FNM with way too many people, Dave and Adams is probably your plac (free, cash prizes, and free pizza). Collectors Inn probably has the most variety of formats, maybe Two Kings has a good variety too. Those are the more competitive groups, so you get the attitudes that go along with that. I heard Dark Forest had to close, which sucks if it's true they we good people.   The MTG scene is pretty decent, and somewhat dominated by Dave and Adams.

Buffalo,3a6x3l,Bramenstein,6,Wed Jun 17 18:28:32 2015 UTC,"are you strictly seeking around downtown?    Well there's Gino's in the Main Place mall. That's a solid spot for a slice. Not much else after that. Most restaurants offer ""flatbreads"" which technically are like pizza, but more like naan bread pizza. Hydraulic Hearth by larkinville is suppose to have good pizza/flatbreads and specialize with pizza + they just opened their patio slash ""beer garden"" with shuffle board. As for wings, I'd suggest Century Grill or Swannie House for downtown. I haven't had Big Ditch's wings yet, although, their Beer is solid, and their wings description sounds like they would be as delicious. Pearl street's are okay. Gabriel's Gate in Allentown is one of the best establishments close to downtown for wings.    Where to get both? that's tough to answer for specifically downtown. Probably Big Ditch would be the best spot if it had to be downtown, they have ""flatbreads"", wings and delicious beer."

Do you know any places sort of around there I should check out?"
Buffalo,3a6x3l,TOMALTACH,5,Wed Jun 17 19:07:58 2015 UTC,"while some of the places ""seem"" far between, they're only minutes of walking, or you can hop on the subway above ground to scoot around, but you really will get somewhere more quickly walking.      definitely check out big ditch, have a trough aka a flight. definitely check out bourbon & butter inside the hotel lafayette, enjoy a drink there. Oshun is swanky and very cool place, i love that building and what they have done with it.    it's the season for patios...with that said... Liberty hound has some good mixed drinks, and a great patio.    Pearl Street has a really nice patio although their beers aren't too impressive.    The hatch has a bar, and is a cool spot for sunsets.     I have yet to check out Toutant but their menu looks amazing. Tappo is also another cool spot with a rooftop patio, $15 bottles of wine, that's always a plus. If you like sushi, seabar is downtown, even if you're not a fan of raw fish, try the beef on weck roll. Delicious.   Um, Founding Fathers is very cool place to hang out, said to be a bucket list place to check out in the nation. Swannie house has a great simple patio. Hanging at Canalside, sipping on some beverages incognito is relaxing.  (there's a free concert tomorrow, i think everclear is the headliner, usually goes on around 730/8)."
Buffalo,3a6x3l,Eudaimonics,7,Wed Jun 17 19:11:43 2015 UTC,"Wings are easy downtown.  Pizza is a bit more difficult.  Most places serve good wings anywhere. Gabriele's Gate is close to downtown and is excellent. Other than that, Pearl Street, Pan American Grill, and many other places do serve ok wings.  For pizza, I would go to Casa Di Pizza on Elmwood. Prima Pizza downtown is you best option if you must be downtown though.  Pearl Street has pizza, but I cannot vouch for its quality.  Lots of other AMAZING restaurants for things other things: Seabar, Tappo, Oshun, Buffalo Proper, Archer, Ballyhoo, the Lodge, Lagerhaus to name a few.  Big Ditch just opened downtown and is AWESOME.

Better place to enjoy a sporting event & few beers. Their ""pizzas"" are more like Flatbread pizza.   I will mention the beer can chicken is good, better have two other people with you though, it's $30 & filling. Bada bing actually has better food."
Buffalo,3a6x3l,zebra15,0,Wed Jun 17 20:34:02 2015 UTC,"If you're getting food at 716, I do not recommend the pizza. Definitely not Buffalo-style pizza, it's more like flatbread."
Buffalo,3a6x3l,coppersink63,3,Thu Jun 18 13:16:39 2015 UTC,Gino's is the only good place for pizza downtown and its in the main place mall which isnt a very good location.  However there are a few good places to stop to eat.    Pearl Street Grill The Hatch Chef's Tempo The Anchor Bar   and a little farther away would be Pano's but honestly if I had to pick I love stopping by the hatch for a hotdog/ice cream and walking along the water.

Buffalo,3a6x3l,Grooth,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:47:00 2015 UTC,I have a very deeply important question you may be able to answer. Last time I went to Blacksheep I ordered the fish plate appetizer which was fucking incredible. But on it there was some fish of some sort resting on too of what appeared to be some sort of reddish brown granular substance. I assumed it was salt but when I tasted it it was actually saltier than pure salt. My dad and I both wonder what it was. So what is it? Is it actually just salt? It had a very pungent flavor as well if I recall. Hard to describe just very strong tasting.
Buffalo,3a6x3l,Yellowed,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:02:14 2015 UTC,"It was lava salt. It's just there to hold the oyster upright. Some places use crushed ice.   Don't eat it. It's weird to tell people not to eat it because it can come off as patronizing, but I've had to buy a new half dozen oysters for a guest once when he put the salt on every oyster  before eating a single one."
Buffalo,3a6x3l,Grooth,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:10:37 2015 UTC,Oh god that sounds horrid. I can't imagine doing something like that before tasting it.

I don't know how far away you are now, but maybe take a weekend and scour UB, Buff State, Medaile, Canisius for any of those posters. Also check out those schools' subreddits as well. I know /r/UBreddit is pretty active."
Buffalo,3a5apb,cherieblosum,3,Wed Jun 17 09:57:55 2015 UTC,"I live near UB south campus. A lot of UB students live off campus here. For surviving without a car living here is actually a good option. Aldi's and TOPS are close by for groceries. Loads of eateries nearby. There's a metro station if you plan to go to downtown or the airport. I would advice against staying near UB north if you don't have a car. It is doable UB has a Mall and market bus service once every 2 weeks during spring and fall semesters not so sure during the breaks.  The UB shuttle takes takes 15-20 mins to reach one campus from another. This becomes a hassle if you have a class in the morning and then one in the evening( Add's about an hour to each class). Also UB's bus service changes during breaks, weekends and exams. Try to stay close to the campus where your classes are held. Also the rent in the apartments you linked seems a tad high for the area. Look around on craigslist you'll find cheaper apartments."
Buffalo,3a5apb,korpy_vapr,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:03:18 2015 UTC,"If it's that close to UB South expect it to be fairly hood and weekends to include a ton of drunks as South Campus is where the parties are. Apartments close to North Campus will be much nicer and in a much nicer area, UB provides buses from North to South if you have to get there for classes. Lived on both North and South campus for a year, in the dorms albeit, but preferred North heavily to South. It will depend on your preference though!"

""African lion safaaaariiiii"" last time I went there I was in seventh grade I think. I liked it a lot. It's basically a huge zoo from what I remember. And the drive through safari is awesome for a child interested in animals.   Semi related story but last time I was there I was in the gift shop when I realized the 40$ is brought wasn't in my pocket so I panicked and went to go look for my money and walked out of the gift store without paying for my stuffed animal and rock candy. I'm sorry african lion safari for taking 10$ worth of cheap tourist shit."

Buffalo,3a5q01,ConneryFTW,2,Wed Jun 17 15:07:49 2015 UTC,"Well, it's a zoo. The safari trail is an interesting experience if you haven't been through it, although I would strongly advise you take the tour bus and not your own vehicle. There's packs of baboons loose on the trail, and they have been known to tear mirrors, trim, and antennas off of peoples vehicles if the mood strikes them.   You could also check out Safari Niagara. It's quite a bit closer to Buffalo, and it's really a nice park, especially for the kids. Not many people seem to know about it."

As an animal obsessed kid sitting in the rear-facing seats of my parent's car, it was the best thing ever. Monkeys climbing on the car, lions sleeping, giraffes looking into the window and other animals around. It was great. That being said, I'd be worried to go back, see it through the eyes of an adult and it being a total let down."

Get there as early as you can in the morning because as the day goes on and heat increases the animals get lazy. Drove my own car through with no problems and no animals touching it. The only cars I saw monkeys crawling on were people either feeding them or pretending to feed them. They have some fun shows as well to see. Drive the safari, pack a lunch, see the shows, drive through a second time before leaving!"
Buffalo,3a5q01,bucky716,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:08:02 2015 UTC,"I really liked it, as a child and as an adult, and I was thinking about taking my child there this year as well.  My suggestion is to take your own car as long as you don't mind damage.  Usually the extent of damage is poop or pee from the monkeys and/or wiper blades getting pulled off, but they ARE animals so you never know.  The baboons definitely climbed up on our car without enticing them.  The safari bus thing moves too fast IMO and isn't as personal, and I remember us stopping to view and the park officials trying to sort of rush us along, but we mostly ignored them and they didn't do anything.  Just move to the side so other vehicles can go past."
Buffalo,3a47s5,ohlilmissbina,12,Wed Jun 17 02:36:20 2015 UTC,"The way these games work, means that only a few pieces have any value. There are very few of one of each color, sometimes only one of two. If you have the rare piece then you essentially won the prize because the others will be easy to find. If you don't have the rare piece, which you probably don't, then they are worthless."

Buffalo,39zu21,Eudaimonics,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:32:46 2015 UTC,"The racism is to a point that it's become pretty much engrained in the culture, I would just say this is palpable (and most pervasive in the police tactics) in Cheektowaga, Kenmore and to a slightly lesser degree Amherst. North Buffalo is hip, most parts of the City are hip, Town of Tonawanda is OK for the most part, anything around the campuses are OK. I mean OK by either diverse enough that it's not a problem or under the radar enough that it isn't a problem, or at least the police aren't a part of the problem."
Buffalo,39zu21,Eudaimonics,3,Wed Jun 17 15:49:38 2015 UTC,Just the normal stuff. Expect to pay anywhere from $750-900 for anywhere in North Buffalo (and rents are rising fast). Kenmore can be cheaper depending on where you are...though Kenmorons will judge you depending on which block you live on.  But you are right. 75% of rentals are in multifamily homes (usually an upper and lower) instead of large buildings/complexes.
Buffalo,39zu21,buffalo442,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:08:48 2015 UTC,"Kenmorons? Is this a technical term, widely used?   That rent sounds pretty reasonable, though. I've got my heart set on a garage, what are the chances of that?"
Buffalo,39zu21,asdfmatt,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:47:14 2015 UTC,It's Kenmore's official demonym.  Getting a garage can be tough but not impossible. Many complexes have some covered options.
Buffalo,39zu21,Eudaimonics,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:55:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, gotcha! I don't want to offend anyone if I call them that - and I will.. especially if I observe that it's true.   Covered is better than on-street... I drive a low to the ground car, I don't want to get completely stuck in the snow piles. :)"
Buffalo,39zu21,asdfmatt,0,Wed Jun 17 00:57:45 2015 UTC,"Kenmore isn't very exciting.  It's safe, but otherwise it's pretty bland - lots of old buildings (and not the cool old, the abandoned 60's old), not the prettiest place.  Not that it's a bad place to live, but it wouldn't be one of my top choices..."
Buffalo,39zu21,buffalo442,6,Tue Jun 16 05:34:43 2015 UTC,"Town of tonawanda is as quiet as it gets while still being close to the city. Close as possible to Sheridan drive (anything north of highland is safe and quiet), or that little square of blocks near Kenilworth is also quiet and has more of rentals, try and stay as far as you can from Franklin elementary though. The duplexes there are rough."
Buffalo,39zu21,JBob250,3,Tue Jun 16 04:48:46 2015 UTC,How do we feel about Amherst?
Buffalo,39zu21,JBob250,7,Tue Jun 16 04:59:05 2015 UTC,"Amherst is pretty large (also Buffalo's largest suburb by population).  It also has one of the best school districts and one of the most expensive one (though there are plenty of affordable places).  You would want to stick near the city in Amherst for convenience and Main Street near UB South Campus has some things going on.  Williamsville is nice and walkable and has a lot of boutiques, bars and restaurants. Not really exciting if you're single since its mostly families and older folks.  Near UB North there is a lot of students, but its pretty boring.  East Amherst has a lot of gated communities and McMansions.  Traffic is pretty bad, so it doesn't make for a pretty commute during rush hour...though compared to Californian traffic you'll probably laugh at this."
Buffalo,39zu21,JBob250,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:05:39 2015 UTC,LA traffic drives me nuts! We don't really have traffic here unless there's something going on in town. I'm just not that patient I guess.   Thank you for the reply. :)
Buffalo,39zu21,maxwell7301,6,Wed Jun 17 00:49:18 2015 UTC,"Amherst. Is. Fucking. Enormous. Getzville is chill, anywhere near UB (both campuses are in or on border w. Amherst) is ok--studenty but you can get family-oriented areas by Harlem and Main... Interspersed with public high schools, YMCA, etc, close to 290... Not bad, depending if you're comfortable to get further from the city by now... I mean, there's still Williamsville, East Amherst, et cetera if you don't mind a drive and are really looking to get out to the burbs."
Buffalo,39zu21,asdfmatt,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:23:17 2015 UTC,"Yep, Amherst is huge.  Williamsville is nice, not a bad commute to Kenmore.  Snyder and Eggertsville are closer to Kenmore - Snyder is a bit more upscale, but both are nice areas.  Same goes for Getzville.  But you can go pretty far out and still be in Amherst - if you're out in East Amherst - along Transit or up toward Lockport, that's quite a hike from where you'll be working, plus there's not a ton around."
Buffalo,39zu21,maxwell7301,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:39:49 2015 UTC,"What's a drive, like 20 minutes? or more?"
Buffalo,39zu21,asdfmatt,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:45:51 2015 UTC,"most of the suburbs are nice, and there isn't a huge problem with traffic around Buffalo. the 290E/90W interchange and the 190N above the city get backed up, but typically only during evening rush hour.   I work in Kenmore, and make the drive every day because I like Depew/West Seneca. I've been doing it for over ten years, barring a blizzard, it only takes 20 minutes in and 25 minutes out."
Buffalo,39zu21,maxwell7301,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:31:29 2015 UTC,"You're definitely the person I want to follow during a blizzard then. I was wondering, if it would be more advantageous to look into living in the 'burbs - but I don't really want to be so cut off from all the social aspects of the city.   Thank you for the reply, and your insight. :)"
Buffalo,39zu21,luxical,2,Wed Jun 17 00:22:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know what school district the Elmwood area is in, but if you're brother is still attending school, I'd stay away from city Schools. kenmore/Tonawanda is fine though.  it all depends on your interests,and you choice won't be permanent, I'm sure you've moved a bunch before. but if your brother is still in school, dont go south of kenmore"
Buffalo,39zu21,luxical,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:09:48 2015 UTC,"He's going to be in college, so school is not an issue. Thanks for the advice, I definitely don't want to get stuck somewhere sketchy."
Buffalo,39zu21,RITheory,0,Wed Jun 17 01:13:54 2015 UTC,"ya, you're fine in Elmwood if you don't mind the occasional bums, and like crowded bars on weekends. Kenmore Hertel still have pockets of bad neighborhoods, lil less crowded bars, and you're more likely to get a garage or at least off street parking.   I'm near your age, I prefer quieter areas, but will head into the city on weekends, its about a 15 minute drive, but obviously unbike-able, though I have 6 bars within walking distance even out in the burbs.   basically, everything is accessible from everywhere, and Google distance to Holiday Valley or Kissing Bridge for snowboarding trips.   and don't move to rochester, ever. we've been on our way up, really gaining steam the last year. they're on their way down the opposite path.  for colleges, Google SUNY at Buffalo aka University of Buffalo, it has a great reputation. It's not quite RIT, but very reputable."
Buffalo,39zu21,factus10,3,Wed Jun 17 01:26:58 2015 UTC,"South of Highland Avenue is just fine, if you're west of where the old train tracks used to be. Those duplexes are sketchy, I'll give you that.  I would argue that anything near Colvin, all the way from Sheridan to the Buffalo city line is the best part of Kenmore/Tonawanda."
Buffalo,39zu21,factus10,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:52:47 2015 UTC,My sister rented a year on Colvin right before Hertel (closer to N Buff) and she had a really cute apartment. I assume you mean west of Montrose or which train tracks?
Buffalo,39zu21,Krunkyjunk,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:27:57 2015 UTC,I mean the tracks near Anderson's and Teds on Sheridan.  They're turning that into a trail now.  Streets like Highland are better west of there.  North Buffalo is perfectly fine.
Buffalo,39zu21,cphuntington97,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:18:06 2015 UTC,Ohhhh right closer to Ken West. Forgot that Highland went through there (Harrison stops and starts back up?). Yeah those are great homes in that area for TOT.
Buffalo,39zu21,cphuntington97,2,Tue Jun 16 19:30:39 2015 UTC,"Yup, all the streets start back up, but Harrison is the only one that goes through.  There are actually some really nice streets near Ken West, like Deerhurst, Devonshire and Doncaster.    I grew up around there and went to Lindbergh and Ken West."
Buffalo,39zu21,Eudaimonics,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:28:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I've been considering the 'burbs, I'm only concerned about being too far from the 'fun' things in the city."
Buffalo,39zu21,cphuntington97,5,Wed Jun 17 00:50:09 2015 UTC,"If your 17 year old brother is still in high school Kenmore is not a bad place to be. You can still be very close to the trendy areas while living in an area that's very nice for families. Kenmore is definitely quiet (can be dull). Teenagers don't need cars to get around Kenmore - it's small and walkable. If it were just you I'd say living in the city would be more fun, but you do have another person to consider.   Also if you are not used to snow you might really want to make it a priority to get a place with off-street parking, whatever neighborhood you ultimately choose."
Buffalo,39zu21,whackabackatacka,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:24:59 2015 UTC,"Lame question, do people have garages in Buffalo? or is that a weird thing?   My brother will be doing college classes online, so a school for him isn't the issue. I definitely need to be in a place where he will be able to ride a bike to get around until he can buy a car for himself. Kenmore seems like a good place for that.   Thank you for the reply. :)"
Buffalo,39zu21,cphuntington97,2,Wed Jun 17 00:39:16 2015 UTC,"Inside the city proper there aren't as many garages but you can find places that have one. In any of the suburbs, nearly every house has a garage. Not lame at all :)."

Buffalo,39zu21,flancresty,0,Wed Jun 17 03:37:02 2015 UTC,"Idk, I've heard Ken West has fights nearly every day. Hearsay from teachers I used to work with, though."
Buffalo,39zu21,whirlpool138,6,Tue Jun 16 16:15:22 2015 UTC,"First of all, congratulations! I too am a non-native: my family moved here in 1985 when I was 16. We moved right into Allentown. Since then, I've lived in the Elmwood Village area, Linwood, Cheektowaga, North Buffalo and now in Kenmore.  Allentown is great if you don't mind living within one block of one of the party streets. Bars are open until 4am in Buffalo and parking is a problem in Allentown without the added crap from the drunks. Thurs-Sat nights are going to be filled with drunks screaming at each other until about 4:30am. In the winter it's not so bad b/c your windows are closed. The summer... well, it's special.  On the other hand, there are lots of great places to eat on Allen. And you'll definitely be one of the ""cool kids"" living there. Not sure where you brother would go to school... Grover Cleveland, I think. You can look up whether it's a good school or not. Rents are off the hook, imo. Apartments (and houses) tend to be small because of the period in which they were built or how they've been split up since.  Elmwood Village is nicer (potentially fewer drunks, depending on which part of Elmwood) but still poses a parking problem. I've lived on Richmond, Ashland and Lexington. All great apartments. Considered a ""cool"" area too. Rents are priced accordingly.  North Buffalo is great, for the most part. I've lived on Crescent (Parkside area) and just off Hertel Ave (equiv of Main Street for North Buffalo). Most of the houses are duplexes: two units in each. Some are owner-occupied, some are both rentals. You'll encounter a lot of good-sized apartments for very reasonable rents.   And you'll have access to lots of good places to eat and shop in North Buffalo.  I have friends who live in the larger suburbs (Amherst, Williamsville, etc). They're great if you want a big house and lawn.   A lot of people like to slag on Kenmore. Here's why (I learned this shortly after we moved here): Kenmore cops are renowned for giving speeding tickets. I've been driving for >20 years in and I have yet to get a speeding ticket in Kenmore. But in Buffalo, the ""city speed limit"" is interpreted as more of a suggestion and people take umbrage at having to drive 30mph.  Kenmore is one of Buffalo's oldest suburbs. The housing stock is almost all post-1900. The first few blocks in are the oldest... the further you go north, the newer it gets. A lot of the houses are single-family but there are still duplexes (side-by-side or up/down). The house next to mine is a duplex.  I live on the first street in Kenmore, 1 block north of Kenmore Avenue (that's the dividing line between North Buffalo and Kenmore). I'm about 2 blocks from where you'll work.  Kenmore is as quiet as any North Buffalo street. We have a mix of ages... there are a couple senior citizens on my street and a bunch of families with young children. There's a lesbian couple a few houses down and a Burmese family across the street from me (Kenmore has, historically, not been very diverse but that's changing). Those are just the people I know.  Here are a few reasons to live in Kenmore:   You can put out bulk garbage every week. In Buffalo, there are a few specific times of the year (depending on the street) when you can put out large items that don't fit in your garbage tote. There's far more off-street parking (and on-street) available. It only takes one winter in Buffalo to understand the value of off-street or reasonable on-street parking options. The police respond to your phone call in just a few minutes vs a long time to practically never in the city. For example, I had a minor fender bender on Niagara Street near downtown (an area called the Lower West Side). I called the cops. A cop came and responded to a robbery at the gas station I was near that happened while I was waiting for cops to come to my accident. After an hour and a half, I gave up. On the other hand, Kenmore cops showed up within minutes when an unlocked bike was stolen off my porch. And about an hour later, they showed up again with my bike. Kenmore knows how to plow the streets. Seriously, you cannot underestimate the importance of plowed streets. While almost all of Buffalo was being fucked by the snow this year, Kenmore streets were clear down to the asphalt. There was no better example than Kenmore Avenue. The north side of the street: asphalt. The south side? 1-2"" hard packed snow. Kenmore, like any other place in Buffalo, is near to everything. I like to ride my bike. Riding down to Elmwood? 20ish minutes (driving, about 10). North Buffalo? Ditto. Kenmore enforces its local ordinances. This is good and bad. You're not supposed to have (regular) grass over 12"" tall in your yard. On the other hand, no street in Kenmore looks completely unkempt. Yes, there are a fair number of reasonable places to eat, shop, whatever in Kenmore. We're getting a Mexican grocery, apparently (a few blocks north of Kenmore on Delaware). I have no clue why. But for the most part the more 'interesting' shopping is in Allentown, Elmwood, Hertel, etc. Kenmore schools are good.   Wherever you look, pay attention to how people are parking and the size of the street. I have a friend who lives two streets east of Delaware (in North Buffalo) about a block south of Kenmore. The street is narrow. It gets even narrower in the winter with the snow.  Good luck!"

It's good to know that I'm going to be a good spot - I do have a tendency of being a little bit of an amateur race car driver. I'll cross my fingers and hope that I don't attract too much attention.   My brother is 17, but he just graduated HS a couple of weeks ago. He has a car here but we wont be able to bring it with us. You mentioned that Kenmore is relatively close to the surrounding neighborhood, and easily accessible by bicycle - AWESOME.   If I can afford to live in the area - I am more than likely sold.

Buffalo,39zu21,cheesemcnab,3,Tue Jun 16 04:45:08 2015 UTC,"I want to ""second"" how important it is to have something to do during the winter evenings when it is cold and dark out, i.e., a serious hobby. If you have nothing to do but sit around and fret about the cold, it's going to get to you.  I try to see the winter as an opportunity to really focus on something without being distracted. For me, it's making music, but it could be anything, and there are tons of clubs and groups around -- a good way to meet people.  It's also really helpful to stay active in the winter. The weather doesn't always lend itself to winter sports, but there's BikeorBar, plenty of gyms, yoga studios, etc. Shoveling snow: chore or exercise opportunity? You decide!  I also use the Philips 6500K compact fluorescent bulbs. They look more like daylight than conventional bulbs.  I confess to spending many winter evenings reading in cafes. They're cozy!  All this, and still the winter gets to me sometimes. On the plus side, you'll appreciate the good weather when it's here.  The main reason I stay in Buffalo is because I can afford a single family home here on a moderate salary, and I feel my quality of life is very good. If you're sticking around for a while, buy a house. Why line a landlord's pockets? Line your own!   If I leave Buffalo, it will be because I'm curious about the lifestyle I could have in a bigger city. Speaking of which, Toronto, Ontario, Canada is about a 2 hour drive north. So get your enhanced license and/or passport."
Buffalo,39zu21,Eudaimonics,2,Tue Jun 16 14:20:09 2015 UTC,"Something to do ... like... knitting? campfire sing alongs? or do you mean... the casual consumption of adult beverages?  Hopefully, I can find something to do... what is the norm for most Buffalonians?   I will more than likely buy a house. Without getting too personal, I really need to take care of my family and I'm trying to get a good spot so that my mom will meet me up there when her lease is up in October.  The main reason why I chose Buffalo is because she has obsessed over it for the majority of my life. My parents are Canadian and my entire family lives in Toronto, so it will be great to be so close to them - and also have my own space, because - let's face it, who needs family ALL the time.   Thank you for taking the time to be so thoughtful, much appreciated. :)"
Buffalo,39zu21,262Mel,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:31:21 2015 UTC,"You are very welcome! I wouldn't worry about what the norm is; I just know that having a serious hobby has been really helpful to me and my friends. Some of them spend all winter machining parts for model trains. My mom spends an inordinate amount of time training her dog. Whatever interests you!  The Village of Kenmore is really cute. My cousins live over there. They have a nice big house with a garage and a large yard and everything. It's a little too suburban-feeling for me, personally. I live on the west side and I like it here. I can walk to Allentown in 10 minutes or Canalside in 20. Buffalo is neither a big nor a busy city. After business hours, things get pretty quiet. I think my street is quieter than where my folks live in Williamsville.   It just depends on what you want. You could live 10 miles north in Wheatfield (aptly named) and have a 20 minute commute by car. I'm not recommending it, but it just depends on where you want to live and what kind of commute you can put up with.  I place a huge priority on walkability because all meaningful interactions happen on foot."
Buffalo,39zu21,flancresty,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:35:05 2015 UTC,"I really like and understand your mindset, I want to be the kind of person that appreciates walkability. I want to be able to walk a few blocks to a farmers market or waterfront.. is there anything like that in Buffalo?"
Buffalo,39zu21,Eudaimonics,2,Wed Jun 17 03:36:21 2015 UTC,"Both Kenmore and North Buffalo have farmer markets. Actually, most neighborhoods and suburbs have them, so just keep an eye out.  Buffalo has a pretty nice waterfront that just keeps getting better.  Downtown you have Canalside, the Naval Park and Erie Basin Marina.  The Outer Harbor is now filled with great parks and nature preserves to explore on foot or by bike.  There are a lot of great bike paths along the Niagara River that connect to an extensive system that crisscrossd the state. See /r/Buffalobike  Check out Bird Island Pier, Niawanada Park and Squaw Island Park (near the Blackrock locks).  Also checkout the City of North Tonawanda (halfway between Buffalo and Niagara Falls). They are the current terminous of the Erie Canal and they recently redid their entire waterfront. Lots of great gastro pubs and bars to check out.  Kayaking is fairly popular, there are several rowing clubs, there are boat cruises that will take you out to the Lake that are a lot of fun. There are beaches on both Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. Not great for swimming, but the sand quality is good at some of them."
Buffalo,39zu21,Eudaimonics,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:29:35 2015 UTC,"/u/Eudaimonics left you a really good comment!   The Kenmore farmer's market is every Saturday right near Kenmore and Delaware at the intersection of Delaware Ave and Delaware Road. I imagine it's a bit more modest in scale than the one at Elmwood and Bidwell.  There's even a little one by me on Fridays at Elmwood and Edward. Even Main Street in Williamsville where my folks live has really blossomed -- they have a farmer's market, Spot coffee, and several restaurants have turned their front parking lots into patio dining areas. But there's no waterfront access, and I personally prefer the density of the urban environment.  The waterfront extends all the way from Hamburg along Lake Erie all along the Niagara River. I really like it; I walk or bike to Canalside, if only to watch the sunset. Why not?"

Buffalo,39zu21,Harvey6ft,12,Sat Jun 20 21:10:04 2015 UTC,"Don't let the Reddit circlejerk fool you.  The average person in Buffalo is not in love with the city and would gladly move away if given the opportunity (look at the declining population as evidence).  As someone who also moved here from California, let me tell you that every time you mention this fact to someone here, the first question people will ask you is why the hell did you decide to move to Buffalo like you're some moron for doing so.  That being said, there if you're pot-committed to moving here, there are some positive things about the area.  See the sidebar for details.  Specifically to your questions, the Kenmore area is certainly nice and quiet.  Your typical /r/Buffalo Redditor is going to try to sell you on the Elmwood Village.  Wonderful part of town if you're making bank and can afford to buy a nice house or are a college student looking for a rundown apartment near all the college bars.  Otherwise, don't listen to the hype.  Living in the Kenmore/Delaware area affords you plenty within walking distance, is ""older"" only in the sense that Kenmore's median age is 39 so you'll find plenty of people in their late 20's and early 30's there, and you are still very close to the Elmwood Village should you want to take advantage of what it has to offer.  Coming from the desert any snow is going to be a culture shock.  Again, your typical person here will say ""the winter's aren't that bad"" and that ""all you have to do is layer to keep warm"".  Again, this is coming from people who have lived here their entire lives.  You are going to be cold come winter and while I don't personally think that driving in the snow is difficult, many natives seem to have a hard time figuring it out so take that for what you will.  Yes, the Kenmore/Delaware area does not typically get as much snow as the southern regions, but it will definitely get snow come winter.  Not 8 feet of snow, but the snow isn't actually the worst part of Buffalo winters.  It is the cold and darkness.  The sun will disappear behind overcast and not show up for weeks.  The days are extremely short (depending on your work schedule, it is not uncommon to leave for work and come home both in pitch-black night) and the slightest amount of wind will make it feel like razors are cutting across your skin.  Is it manageable?  Of course.  Will you find fun and interesting people and things to do in the area?  Depends on how much effort you put into it, but you certainly can.  However, one last warning: nearly all the major events occur from June through August.  The rest of the year, things drastically become quieter.  You never really appreciate having nice weather year-round until you move to a city where it's only around for one season.  Find a club, hobby, or activity that is indoors during the off-season or learn to engage in a winter sport.  Despite the somewhat negative reply, I really don't hate Buffalo.  I'm just trying to give you another perspective so you have an informed outlook - especially moving here from CA.  There is a lot to appreciate about the region and I will honestly say that IRL, this area has some of the friendliest people you'll find.  I've been all around and I can't think of another area where you can engaging in friendly chat or be offered a hand by a random stranger as often as you will here.  Good luck to you."
Buffalo,39zu21,Harvey6ft,13,Tue Jun 16 10:23:40 2015 UTC,"I moved from CA and disagree wholeheartedly. I've had experience living in four-season climates, so the winters are just another part of life, not something you have to ""deal with.""  Days are just as short in most parts of the country, the variability is only about 45 minutes, and of course on the other side of it, we get longer summer nights, so it balances out entirely.  The cold is nowhere near a problem, having lived in Minneapolis (wonderful city) for ten years, that cold is a problem. Here, not at all. It's never below zero, rarely below 10, those are temps at which life actually becomes difficult. I walked to work every day this winter, about 1.5 miles.  You fail to mention entirely the biggest advantage, which is cost of living. You can own a home here, that's basically out of reach in most of CA for a middle class person. And you can do it with a normal job, not some 90 hour/week job that makes having nice things pointless. In Buffalo you can have it all, including leisure time."

Buffalo,39zu21,Harvey6ft,5,Tue Jun 16 14:11:14 2015 UTC,"Your typical /r/Buffalo Redditor is going to try to sell you on the Elmwood Village. Wonderful part of town if you're making bank and can afford to buy a nice house or are a college student looking for a rundown apartment near all the college bars. Otherwise, don't listen to the hype.   Huh? 9 times out of 10 people here acknowledge EV as an aside while selling the glamours of North Buffalo."
Buffalo,39zu21,bear_trap_ouch,3,Tue Jun 16 11:08:38 2015 UTC,"North Buffalo is cheaper and just as stable. I think that has a lot to do with it.  Though at this rate, it won't be that way for much longer. In 5 years the Westside will be the next hot stable cheap neighborhood."
Buffalo,39zu21,benji716,2,Tue Jun 16 13:01:49 2015 UTC,"In some cases, the West Side is almost becoming too pricey. Sellers are asking for $100,000 plus or Elmwood-esque rents for areas that aren't quite stable yet."
Buffalo,39zu21,nemoomen,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:16:42 2015 UTC,"$100,000 is still a steal compared to most cities. Even if you have to do some renovations, that's not bad for a 2400 square foot house with two units."

People here truly do love this city, and there are plenty of us who have moved away and then moved back (by choice, not by necessity)."

The more you travel the more you appreciate Buffalo's very real benefits more, but at the same time you become more cynical about its weaknesses, since clearly there are many things we could do better.  Also, being polite means we often are self-depreciating when talking to visitors."
Buffalo,39zu21,TOMALTACH,3,Tue Jun 16 12:56:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with the above comment. Unless you need to be here, why would you move here. I'm from Buffalo, born and raised. I'm raising my family here because I have parents that need to be looked after & cannot leave the state on conditions of their retirement (they would lose their health insurance, etc). That being said, we have rentals in Kenmore, in fact very near Delaware and Kenmore Ave. It's a nice, safe, quiet area that is actually catering a little more to families as the elderly population dies out. In the village there are restaurants, bakeries, banks, gyms, shops, etc. One block over is Mang Park. Great place for walking the dog, tennis courts, basketball courts, wading pool and large public pool (all across the street from the police station). Rents range from $600 to $1600 depending on what you're looking for."

The city is 38% black and only 23% are under the poverty line.   50% of the city is solid middle class, or higher including a good number of blacks. Some of the poor are also just college kids.

It is likely Buffalo will also be gaining population again some time in the next decade. But yeah, at this point population still is not booming. If you grew up here in the 80s, 90s and early 00s, you would better understand why people are so optimistic now. We're talking night and day here. Though from your perspective, I could see why you wouldn't think all the recent development is a big deal. You're from California, if you moved anywhere with even slightly worse weather, you would get the same response."

Buffalo,39zu21,anand_pandey,3,Tue Jun 16 16:35:51 2015 UTC,"Buffalo is a great city, I'm not originally from here. The snow in Jan and Feb can be trying, but if you like all four seasons than it's something you deal with. Aside from the winters the weather is great here, doesn't get blisteringly hot and the fall seasons are beautiful. There's two Great Lakes right here, a lot of outdoor activities, awesome bars and restaurants, two professional sports teams and two semi-pro ones, close proximity to Canada/Toronto, gorgeous neighborhoods with big beautiful homes (Elmwood, Richmond, Bidwell, Lincoln Pkwy, Parkside, parts of North Buffalo, parts of Central Buffalo), a bike friendly city, a lot of room to breathe and move around unlike other bigger cities such as Boston, San Fran, NYC, etc..., generally friendly people, excellent cost of living, affordable NICE homes for the middle class, and tons of other high points. Sun and Sand ain't everything, and if it is to you, then go to California or Florida I guess."

Buffalo,39zu21,dearinap,1 point,Wed Jun 17 00:43:13 2015 UTC,"I was perhaps a bit too judgmental in my initial response as many have commented on.  I really don't hate it here.  It's great as long as your expectations are set straight.  I don't know if you're coming from a one-street town like Baker, a strip mall like Palmdale, or if you're just playing up the whole ""desert"" thing while really being from outside of LA, so I'm not sure how to properly set those expectations.  Regardless, without a doubt, get prepared for the cold.  I had a friend visit from San Diego in May and he froze his ass off the entire time while I was wearing a t-shirt because I'd grown to adjust to the weather.  You will too, but not for a few winters.  Feel free to hit me up once you do get out here and I'd be happy to show you some of the awesome stuff in the area to check out."

Buffalo,39zu21,asdfmatt,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:04:16 2015 UTC,"Is this better?   By posting here on /r/Buffalo please understand that you’re going to get a lot of responses from people who are in love with the city, but they do not represent the average person in Buffalo.  There are 6845 Redditors subscribed to this sub, whereas about 259,000 people live in the city alone and many of those subscribers live in the regions surrounding it or are former citizens.  Many (not all) residents of this city would gladly move to another location in the US if given the opportunity, but stay here because of familial or financial reasons.  And as Buffalo’s declining population shows, there are many without those hindrances who have moved away.  As someone who also moved here from California, I am usually asked why I moved here by locals because without asking me about my situation, they cannot comprehend why I would have decided to move to this area.  That being said, if you are definitely set on moving to Buffalo, there are a lot of positive things about the area.  I recommend you check out the sidebar for details, but I will say that there have been a lot of developments recently in the downtown area that are very promising.  Unfortunately, this hasn’t trinkled down into many of the poorer neighborhoods and is unlikely to do so in the near future, but there is a general feeling in the region that things are on an upswing.  Specifically to your questions, the Kenmore area is certainly nice and quiet.  While many here on this sub love to highlight the Elmwood Village and North Buffalo areas, they are by no means the only spots worth living in, and they have their disadvantages that those here don’t often take into consideration.  The Elmwood Village is expensive (relatively speaking) for homeowners and most renters are nearby college students who accept lower standards as long as they can be close to school and nearby bars.  North Buffalo can be just as expensive for homeowners in some areas, but less so in others.  It really depends on the street.  You can find a street that is expensive and exclusive to lawyers and doctors and others that are rundown and ripe for development.  As a renter, you may find either disappointing because even in the nicer streets you will often find discrimination by the local “community committees” and in the poorer streets you are subject to loud noise and crime.  The Elmwood Village really is an awesome place to be around – especially if you like to walk because pretty much all you need day-to-day is on the strip.  Except for basic housing needs like furniture and kitchen utilities.  But the Kenmore/Delaware area offers much of the same – moreso given that you’ll be close to Goodwill and Target for these types of things.  And if you will still be very close to the EV should you want to patronize it.  Some have suggested that the EV is the place for younger people and this is certainly true if you’d like to be surrounded by college students.  But Kenmore’s median age is 39 so you’ll find plenty of people in their late 20’s and early 30’s there without having to listen the late night/early morning drama that comes with college students getting drunk.  Coming from the desert any snow is going to be a culture shock.  Many here on this sub tell newcomers that the winter’s aren’t that bad and ""all you have to do is layer to keep warm"" but they are coming from the perspective of those who have lived here their entire lives.  It will be cold for you coming from a desert climate at least for the first couple of winters.  Driving in the snow is a skill that has to be learned, but many in the area seem to forget how to do so during the first few weeks of snowfall so you won’t feel that out of place while you adjust.  The Kenmore/Delaware area does not typically get as much snow as the southern regions, but it will definitely get snow come winter.  8 feet of snow is rare even in the southtowns (not once a century as someone else has suggested – more like once a decade) but snow is something that you’ll have to adjust to coming from where you are.  Actually, the worst part about the winters in Buffalo is how short and dark the days are.  Compared to the southern region of California (which I assume you are from considering you stated you are used to a desert climate), the days in the winter are even shorter than you would expect.  Furthermore, they are much darker because of the overcast that will last for weeks if not months.  So even during the days it will be very gray and gloomy outside which can have quite an effect on your general mood.  On top of this, depending on where you are in the region, the wind can make things feel much colder than it is.  Sometimes the temperature may read in the 20s or 30s but the wind chill makes it feel like it is below zero.  It’s like razors are cutting across your skin.  Is it manageable? Of course. Will you find fun and interesting people and things to do in the area? Depends on how much effort you put into it, but you certainly can. However, one last warning: nearly all the major events occur from June through August. The rest of the year, things drastically become quieter. You never really appreciate having nice weather year-round until you move to a city where it's only around for one season. Find a club, hobby, or activity that is indoors during the off-season or learn to engage in a winter sport.  Despite the somewhat negative reply, I really don't hate Buffalo. I'm just trying to give you another perspective so you have an informed outlook - especially moving here from CA. There is a lot to appreciate about the region and I will honestly say that IRL, this area has some of the friendliest people you'll find. I've been all around and I can't think of another area where you can engaging in friendly chat or be offered a hand by a random stranger as often as you will here.  Lastly, Buffalo is extremely affordable.  Whereas in many parts of CA it is difficult to own a home and make means end on an average salary, in Buffalo you can buy property and call it your own.  Depending on your economic situation, you may even be able to own several properties and rent out to those in need of a place to live.  If this is something that interests you, Buffalo is a great place to start.  Good luck to you."

Also, talks of a slight expansion south to a new Park and Ride.  It's a shame that the NFTA is pretty bad at taking leadership and speaking up and promoting themselves.  Especially considering there are a lot of developments going on that would be enhanced by rail extensions. NFTA should be lobbying full force for an expansion to Larkinville and Riverbend. Both lines would cost less than the recent $200million renovations done to the Ralph."
Buffalo,39zscw,Eudaimonics,2,Tue Jun 16 14:31:17 2015 UTC,"http://toamherst.nfta.com/  TL/DR: They're talking about Light Rail or Bus Rapid Transit in the Bailey, Millersport or NF Blvd corridors, through UB North and then towards Crosspoint Park.  BRT is usually preferred by thrifty constituents who would prefer no spending on transit at all. During the planning period in other cities, BRT typically gets repeatedly watered down until it's nothing more than a glorified bus line. If you want to make an impact and actually get ridership, LRT is a better bet. Whatever they do, it should be in the NF Blvd corridor. Transit development needs to be about creating places, not just connecting A to B.  I haven't been to any of the meetings but I bet the comments from Amherst residents are a hoot."

Places like Tonawanda, Kenmore etc aren't far removed from Buffalo and crime in Buffalo can really effect those places as well. Just my two cents.   Also, sorry to creep but I looked at your history a little bit, you only moved here a few years ago and you live in Elmwood village. I'll take a lot of flak for this but Elmwood village is a significantly sheltered part of Buffalo that isn't exactly a dangerous area. Also most people in the suburbs have been in the area their entire life and a lot of us come from the city. I think it's unfair to say we don't care."

What the actual fuck? You make a bold statement that there are no minority cops, get proven wrong, then say the problem is that a statistic exists? You can measure any statistic you want, so your statement makes no sense.  Minorities make up 89% of the impoverished population, according to this. Could it be possible that someone living in poverty is less likely to become a cop? Crime rates are significantly higher in the lower class, so it makes a lot of sense that someone growing up in the lower class will be part of the ""no snitch"" culture, or even a criminal themselves. When anti-cop sentiments gets hammered in to your head by family, friends, and neighbors, it's not a hard choice to make. Become a cop, and you'll be hated by your peers."

Buffalo,39qkz1,Sabres00,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:32:53 2015 UTC,"BN Article Part 1   From the window of her seventh-floor apartment, Toni Guercio looks out on a panoramic view of the Buffalo waterfront that would make a millionaire jealous. ¶ She especially enjoys the spring and summer sunsets, when a soft glow illuminates the Erie Basin Marina, the Buffalo Harbor and the historic lighthouse at the Buffalo Coast Guard station. ¶ “I just love that sunset,” she said. “When I’m having a tough day or I’m worried about something, it always makes me feel good.” ¶ For Guercio and other residents of the Marine Drive Apartments, the view comes at an affordable price. The 57-year-old former grocery store worker said she pays just $396.50 a month for her two-bedroom apartment, in a rent-controlled, government-owned complex of six 12-story buildings on a prime piece of waterfront property.  Marine Drive is the last bastion of the middle class and the poor on Buffalo’s downtown waterfront.  That’s a genuine waterfront bargain, especially considering that condominiums a short walk away on Rivermist Drive have recently sold for between $490,000 and $700,000.  There’s just one problem with Marine Drive. The aging complex is becoming a shabby eyesore, and not just in the opinion of Guercio and other residents.  Some city officials are concerned that the complex of buildings is a blight in a downtown area that has become one of the region’s tourism hot spots.  And several residents fear that the Buffalo Municipal Housing Authority, which owns the 616-unit facility, is intentionally letting the place deteriorate so that tenants will leave and Marine Drive can be sold to a private developer.  “With all the development going on down here, they’re not going to let people like us stay here,” said Wesley Brewer, 82. “It’s a prime location. They want us to leave so they can make condos here.”  Officials of the housing authority said they are doing their best with limited resources and would like to do more. They estimate that it would cost at least $42 million for long-needed upgrades at the aging complex.  They say they are considering rent increases, but are not trying to force residents to leave. They also say there is no plan to sell Marine Drive.  “The waterfront, in that area of Buffalo, a lot of good things are happening down there,” said Modesto Candelerio, assistant executive director of the authority. “We want to be part of all that. How do we make Marine Drive better? It’s going to take resources and it’s going to take time to raise the revenue we need to improve it.”  But the many millions of dollars needed to upgrade Marine Drive do not appear to be coming anytime soon.  History of Marine Drive  Marine Drive Apartments is owned and run by the Buffalo Municipal Housing Authority, which charges monthly rental fees ranging from $305 to $565, including most utilities.  The apartment complex was built for low-income residents in 1951, and was originally called Dante Place.  In the 1960s, the authority turned over the operations to a tenants’ association.  Many older tenants said the tenants’ association did an excellent and efficient job of running Marine Drive and maintaining the property for 40 years.  But critics accused the tenants’ association of discriminating against minorities who applied to move in and giving special preference to government employees and people with political connections.  “It was publicly subsidized segregation,” said Scott Gehl, executive director of Housing Opportunities Made Equal, a not-for-profit group that fights housing discrimination in Buffalo. “A lot of the older tenants say things were wonderful in the good old days, but it was a segregated place for people who were blessed with political connections.”  A federal investigation and legal action that HOME filed in 2002 led to a federal judge ordering the tenants’ association to revise its rental policies and give minorities a better chance to move to Marine Drive.  In 2004, the housing authority hired new managers to run Marine Drive.  The housing authority hired a private company for several years, and then created a not-for-profit corporation to manage the property in 2006.  But after a growing number of resident complaints about the management, the housing authority took over Marine Drive in 2011.  The complaints  Residents say Marine Drive has deteriorated sharply since the housing authority took over management in 2011. A News reporter spoke to 20 residents, most chosen at random. Only one resident said he felt the housing authority does a “pretty good job” of maintaining Marine Drive. The reviews from others were overwhelmingly negative.  Among the residents’ complaints:  Littered grounds, dirty and smelly stairwells and hallways, screens missing on some windows, malfunctioning elevators and heating systems, insufficient security, slow response to problems with plumbing and other maintenance issues, crumbling sidewalks, inadequate snow plowing, poorly maintained landscaping and sometimes, rats.  “One night, I opened the door to our building, and a rat came out of the garbage room and ran right past me,” Guercio said, referring to an incident on Mother’s Day. “Rats are getting to be a big problem here. The place is getting so bad I can hardly stand it anymore.”  Her complaints were echoed by many other residents, including John F. Nostrant, 74, a former restaurant owner and bartender who has lived at Marine Drive for almost 20 years.  “Here we are, sitting next to millions and millions of dollars in waterfront development, and what do you see here? Rundown buildings, scraggly old bushes, dirty grounds and garbage that doesn’t get picked up,” Nostrant said. “This should be a showplace … but it’s terrible.”  Kewpy McCullough, 20, a fast-food restaurant worker who lives at Marine Drive with her nine-month-old baby, Jordyn, said that maintenance staff does not respond to complaints quickly.  “I had mold in my apartment. I had to call them for three weeks before they came and cleaned it up. Now it is growing back again. We live on the fourth floor. I have to carry my baby up the stairs a lot because the elevators keep breaking down.”  And Shamia Nicholson, 42, said she and her 3-year-old son, Shomari Sweat, moved out of their apartment last November after a malfunctioning toilet spewed raw sewage through the apartment.  “We’re still in a temporary apartment,” she said on May 18. “They’re still cleaning our apartment up for us. It still isn’t ready.”  Another plumbing horror story came from Joseph Bonds, a 59-year-old minister who lives at Marine Drive with his wife and son. The toilet flooded so badly in the apartment above theirs that “sewage was leaking down through our ceiling,” Bonds said.  “It was horrible, I mean urine, and fecal matter ... You wouldn’t believe the smell. I had to constantly call the BMHA for three days before they finally came and helped us.”  BMHA management  BMHA administrators say they are doing the best they can with limited money.  Marine Drive receives no government subsidy, according to Candelario.  “Marine Drive’s operations are entirely funded on the rents we collect,” he said, adding that administrators have to closely watch the finances.  “The staff is lean over there,” Candelario said. “I go over to Marine Drive periodically, not every day. There have been occasions when I am not happy with the way it looks, and I tell the staff to fix it. Usually, I think it looks pretty good.”  And some residents make exaggerated complaints about Marine Drive, he said, while acknowledging that the authority wishes more money was available to renovate the buildings and hire more workers to maintain them.  “The property is more than 50 years old. It’s never had a major facelift,” Candelerio said. “We had a physical needs assessment done in 2012. At that time, it was estimated that it would cost $42 million to renovate the plumbing, the electrical systems and just to improve the basic necessities in those buildings. If we had the resources, we’d love to upgrade Marine Drive.”  And though some residents complain, Candelario notes that Marine Drive has few vacancies and a long waiting list to get in.  “It is still a very desirable place to live,” he said.  Waterfront renaissance  While residents of Marine Drive complain about their individual situations, some city leaders also are worried that deteriorating conditions are a blight on the multimillion-dollar efforts to turn the waterfront into a showplace.  In recent years, hundreds of millions of government dollars have been spent to build or improve downtown waterfront attractions adjacent to Marine Drive.  When the weather is nice, thousands of people each day visit Canalside, Erie Basin Marina, the Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park and other attractions located just a few steps from the apartments at Marine Drive.  “Our waterfront is really taking off. You can’t just have this big place rotting right in the midst of all that,” said Fillmore District Council Member David A. Franczyk, whose district includes Marine Drive. “You’ve got this place that people look at and say, ‘What are we going to do with that?’”  And Common Council President Darius G. Pridgen, who lives in an upscale waterfront condo a few blocks from Marine Drive, also voiced deep concern.  “The only thing I know about is the exterior of the buildings,” Pridgen said. “The buildings are weathered. They’re dated. They definitely need an update.”"
Buffalo,39qkz1,zjp_716,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:58:49 2015 UTC,"BN Article Part 2   Going forward  So where to go from here?  Gehl, of Housing Opportunities Made Equal, said the BMHA needs to find a way to come up with money to upgrade the buildings and better maintain them.  “I think that, with an adequate public investment, it could be modernized,” he said. “It could be a wonderful sociological development on a waterfront that is otherwise set aside for upper-income people. The city needs to invest in it. It would be criminal to allow it to deteriorate to the point that it’s taken over by a private developer and turned into a high-end property.”  The brick buildings need to be painted and power-washed at the very least, said Joseph A. Mascia, who sits on the BMHA board of commissioners as a tenant representative from Marine Drive.  But all that takes money, and without a subsidy, that means Marine Drive improvements will have to come from rents from the middle and low-income tenants.  Candelario, the BMHA assistant executive director, said options include raising the rents at Marine Drive to pay for badly-needed repairs and more maintenance workers.  Tenants and sources at the authority said the BMHA has discussed raising rents, at first for new residents, and later, for those already living there.  One recent applicant was told that an apartment that formerly cost $392.50 will cost $567 – a hike of 44 percent, one tenant said.  The authority has no plans to sell Marine Drive, Candelario said. “It’s an option we have discussed when we talk about our options,” he said. But “there is no formal proposal to put it up for sale.”  Pridgen has heard suggestions that the Marine Drive Apartments should be torn down, or sold to a private owner who would turn the buildings into high-priced condominiums. Both he and Franczyk said they oppose that idea.  “Waterfront housing should not be limited to the wealthy,” Pridgen said. “We should welcome diversity on the waterfront – not only racial diversity, but the diversity of people at different income levels.”  email: dherbeck@buffnews.com"

You'd probably would have an easier time trading money for sex on Tinder as opposed to the street corner nowadays.

Buffalo,39gtok,FancyAndImportantMan,4,Thu Jun 11 16:57:55 2015 UTC,"As awesome as this would be, some serious economic benefits would have to be shown before we throw over half a billion at this. Hell maybe Papa Pegula will throw in a hefty sum and we won't have to worry."
Buffalo,39gtok,Fgrira-Fpevoare,3,Thu Jun 11 19:07:54 2015 UTC,I don't care if they spend a trillion to fix it.  An Olmsted parkway is priceless.
Buffalo,39gtok,BuffRisingCommenter,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:34:17 2015 UTC,For once I agree with you :-)
Buffalo,39gtok,Fgrira-Fpevoare,2,Fri Jun 12 14:55:44 2015 UTC,"Before they bury the Kensington, they should dig up the bones of every planner, engineer, politician, mobster, construction worker, and suburban developer that had a role in this travesty, and give them a proper pauper's burial. They should toss them onto the pavement in the Humboldt Parkway trench, and cover them with the only thing Buffalo got out of that botched urban surgery. Junked car parts, and debris from recently-demolished historic houses in nearby neighborhoods that the Kensington sucked dry like the suburban vampire it is.  Robert Moses and all his minions not only destroyed Olmsted's magnum opus, but also killed the East Side.  They should treat their rotten corpses like every other mass murderer."

Buffalo,39gtok,byrningdownthehouse,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:04:15 2015 UTC,They want to spend a half billion on this?
Buffalo,39gtok,KnivesAndShallots,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:34:19 2015 UTC,I suspect that it would actually cost more...
Buffalo,39gtok,Ebscer,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:09:16 2015 UTC,I'd rather see the money going to a redesign of the 190 elevated section that cuts through downtown.
Buffalo,39gtok,Giant_Slor,-2,Fri Jun 12 14:25:56 2015 UTC,This looks like one of Matthew Ricchiazzi harebrained ideas.
Buffalo,39gtok,WorkAccount716,6,Thu Jun 11 17:56:19 2015 UTC,"Eh, this idea has been floating around for decades.  Half a billion dollars is a hefty price tag though."
Buffalo,39gtok,Eudaimonics,2,Thu Jun 11 18:28:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, covering the 33 vs dozing one silo... Covering the 33 seems like a reasonable expense, then again I'd like to see the mini dig project happen first"
Buffalo,39gtok,LeJourLeFroid,-4,Thu Jun 11 18:35:05 2015 UTC,"Since the 33 is not a crucial link to downtown, I think the huge expense of covering it doesn't make sense. The next time the section between 198 and Goodell Street needs major repairs, just fill it in, pave 6-8 lanes and rename it Humboldt Boulevard. The right of way near the original Humboldt Parkway is plenty big enough to carry lots of lower speed traffic even if you add green space.  Rochester is filling in 3/4s of a mile of their downtown expressway (roughly the same distance as 33 from Ferry to Best Street) for $20 million, of which the city only has to outlay $400k. Because there are so many underused alternative routes from the East Side to downtown (and most drivers can use the Thruway instead to access downtown) filling it in makes more sense to me. I'd say unless the federal or state government really wants to pay for the highway to be decked over it would be a waste of money."
Buffalo,39gtok,mycrows,4,Thu Jun 11 22:55:16 2015 UTC,The Inner Loop that's being filled in here in Rochester isn't as big of a link that the 33 is. Not a good comparison at all.
Buffalo,39gtok,bucky716,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:07:55 2015 UTC,True. I made the comparison to give a sense of how cheaply fill in of an expressway can be relative to decking.
Buffalo,39gtok,mycrows,4,Thu Jun 11 23:10:30 2015 UTC,Have you been on 33 during rush hour? Getting rid of it would be an absolute nightmare.
Buffalo,39gtok,a_jackson_federalist,2,Fri Jun 12 00:04:01 2015 UTC,"It is, but Gennessee, Broadway, and Kensington are all high capacity roads that are severely under utilized.  It really wouldn't be that bad and those roads could really use the street traffic.  I would say that they would need to improve public transport before this could be a possibility though. A metrorail expansion to the airport would help a lot as well."
Buffalo,39gtok,Eudaimonics,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:56:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, I commuted for a couple of years on the 33. Based on other cities that have downgraded urban expressways to boulevards, I think the traffic could be managed. Especially because many commuters on 33 could use the Thruway instead."
Buffalo,39gtok,mycrows,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:08:19 2015 UTC,This is crazy talk.
Buffalo,39gtok,moar_distractions,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:59:29 2015 UTC,I think it's more crazy to talk about spending most of a billion dollars to build a park in an impoverished residential neighborhood. I don't think that'll happen. I do think the 33 will be downgraded within my lifetime. The neighborhood would benefit more from that anyway.
Buffalo,39gtok,mycrows,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:41:44 2015 UTC,A whole lot of that rush is induced demand.
Buffalo,39gtok,SoBuffaloRes,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:47:00 2015 UTC,"That might be the case, but if you were to get rid of the 33, and that traffic had to be handled by Clinton and Broadway, the morning on those roads would be a shit show."
Buffalo,39gtok,a_jackson_federalist,2,Fri Jun 12 10:57:33 2015 UTC,"Most of the traffic would be handled by the boulevard that replaced the 33. There are boulevards w/pedestrian crossings in major cities that handle more traffic volume per day than the 33. Drivers would also have their choice of the numerous underutilized parallel routes, like Main, Genesee, Sycamore, Broadway (which could be improved if necessary) or the 190. Some could shift to Metro Rail as well. Even without the 33, it will continue to be easy to access downtown Buffalo."
Buffalo,39gtok,mycrows,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:57:27 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a plan!  If we were to divert more traffic onto those streets, small businesses would get a nice boost in business.  Not sure how it would divert onto Clinton and Broadway, though...  Kinda the wrong side of the city."

I want to feel excitement and encouragement for the ECHDC, however, it's bureaucracy getting in the way again. Too much red tape, too much involvement within the RFP, etc. Sometimes a good amount of involvement is needed and sometimes it's not."
Buffalo,39ajeb,ooppoop,2,Wed Jun 10 13:00:11 2015 UTC,"fucking hate ECHDC. they delay everything. they rejected the proposal for building on the south aud block for what? the canalside village will it ever be built? rather have a giant empty hole in the ground than empty buildings right? if anything ECHDC is good at delaying projects and ripping off visitors to the area. $5 for a blue at concerts, $7 for a rusty chain, are we in L.A.? $15/hour for a community blue bicycle vs $0.05/hour for a Buffalo Social Bicycle. $30/hour for a paddle boat which seems botarded when you can just walk into the ""canal"".  Would be better if they were bumpber boats. If the ECHDC wants to make even more money, more visitors, they'd try to get more attractions completed  if i didn't know better, ECHDC seems to be trying to make up for being waaaaay over budget this past winter.

Buffalo,39ajeb,kryzchek,3,Wed Jun 10 17:02:26 2015 UTC,I don't. I think the Buffalo Science Museum is pretty sad overall and the children's section is especially pathetic.

A baby beluga named Skoot contracted bacterial meningitis, and was then attacked by other whales that threw her into a stone wall because they were trying to kill her to alleviate her suffering.

There are a lot of rumors that the Canadian developer who owns the Sheraton and new Rain Forest Cafe is trying to get the city to let him control the Aquarium so he can build a huge new expansion (to capitalize on it's proximity to the Gorge Discovery center and removal of the Robert Moses Parkway).

Buffalo,396gwv,Eudaimonics,11,Sun Jun 14 14:13:27 2015 UTC,"A few things:   You'll probably won't want to live in Cheektowaga. Its an old blue collared suburb. You'll likely will want to live with other people your own age in a little more exciting setting. Checkout Allentown, Elmwood, or North Buffalo for neighbohoods that young professionals are flocking to. Learn to layer. The cold really isn't that bad once you have this mastered. Also, Buffalo is pretty mild compared to the frigid midwest...we just get a lot more snow. Get into a winter sport - there are ski resort towns 45 minutes to the south of Buffalo and they have real powder for much of the winter. Nothing closes for the snow. Even with the worse storms with driving bans, you'll still find stores and restaurants open. As someone else suggested, definitely go to a parking lot and learn how your car handles in the snow. Snow tires are not mandatory if you know how to use your car's momentum correctly and when not to brake or hit the gas. You probably won't like any of our ""Mexican"" food options. That's ok because you can get great old world as well as great new wave immigrant cuisine. Not to mention the best of ""old"" Buffalo bar food and ""new"" Buffalo's growing contemporary culinary scene. Summers in Buffalo are AWESOME. Great weather and there is always large festivals and events going on, including several free large concert series. Buffalo has still retained many of its world class institutions from when it was a major city and we have a great indie music, art and theatre scenes thanks to a large number of college students, young professionals moving back into city neighborhoods and new wave immigrants.  Buffalo is large enough where you can find most scenes to some capacity, but we're small enough where everything is very inviting and accommodating. If you cannot find it, well Toronto is less than a 2 hour drive away. Last call is at 4 am. Chippewa for clubs. Allentown for hipster dives and indie music. Elmwood for college bars, dives and young professional haunts. North Buffalo for a little of everything. Blackrock, the Westside, University Heights, South Buffalo, Village of Williamsville and City of North Tonawanda have some semblance to nightlife as well. Artvoice - free weekly magazine listing everything going on in the coming week. NFTA -Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority - if you ever have the need to take public transport. The bus system is actually pretty good within the city limits but becomes more sporadic in the suburbs."
Buffalo,396gwv,LeJourLeFroid,2,Tue Jun 9 22:18:32 2015 UTC,"Collared? As in food? Winters are just as awesome, if you know how to enjoy the weather"

We might be going out every once in a while, but my main priority is her safety right now. And looking at buffalos crime stats has had me on edge about where the rent. Do you know how safe the areas you mentioned are? Like I said, her safety is key for me. I know I can't keep her safe from everything, but I rather minimize as much risk as I can ya know?"
Buffalo,396gwv,whackabackatacka,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:48:40 2015 UTC,"Allentown, Elmwood Village and North Buffalo are all thriving stable neighborhoods. Rent is rapidly going up in all these areas. These are all neighborhoods young 20-somethings are moving to to be close to the nightlife and other amenities.  Downtown is safe - its one of the most expensive areas of the region to live in - but not as many people live downtown (rapidly changing though) so it can feel a bit desolate.  Really the only main area you have to really worry about is sections of the eastside that have high rates of poverty and gang warfare.  The Westside is still spotty in some areas, but its gentrifying fast so violent crime is on the decline.  Obviously, crime can happen anywhere, so you should always be aware of your surroundings.  Just stay between Main Street and Richmond within the city and you're in a completely safe area North-South throughout the city.  To be fair there are some nice/stable neighborhoods on the Eastside and much of it is more abandoned than it is dangerous."

Gps is kinda dumb like that and just says buffalo for everything, so not sure what the best way to determine that is, for one.

Buffalo,396gwv,chadjohnson400,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:09:33 2015 UTC,"Just Google map each town and find you address.  Downtown is defined generally as the Southern Border being the Buffalo River/Inner Harbor (Also South Park Ave), the Northern Border is Tupper, The Eastern Border is Michigan Street, and the western is South Elmwood Ave.  Of course some people might disagree by a street or two.  Essentially you are pretty far from downtown. The closest city neighborhoods for you are University Heights and Kensington."

Buffalo,396gwv,Komacho,9,Thu Jun 11 01:01:46 2015 UTC,"If you haven't lived around snow before read up on winter preparedness.  During one of the first snowfalls take your car to a big empty parking lot and see how your car handles.  See how long it takes for your car to stop after braking.  See how it turns.    Learn alternate routes to and from work.  If there is heavy snowfall I usually avoid the interstate.  We had an incident a couple of years ago where people got stranded on it overnight.    Keep some food supplies in your house.  We had a really bad storm last winter and I was unable to drive to the store for a week.  I now have a supply of black beans, rice, soup, and ramen.    Take up a winter sport.  Winters seem to go by faster and are more enjoyable if you do something outdoors like skiing, snowboarding, or snowmobiling."
Buffalo,396gwv,swallowtails,7,Tue Jun 9 17:20:33 2015 UTC,Weeds a little more expensive. We have 4 seasons all of which have their benefits and down falls. I find myself wishing for snow at the ass end of September and then praying for it to be sunny mid February. I like it a lot. Cheektowaga is pretty close to everything so that's a plus. I suggest purchasing a vehicle with either 4x4 or awd. That might not even help you as I had to walk 8 miles in 3 feet of snow in the middle of November. But all in all I know people who have moved to Cali and then came back because they missed Buffalo. Welcome.
Buffalo,396gwv,missdawn1970,5,Tue Jun 9 17:03:44 2015 UTC,"Get a shovel.  Get a heavy duty ice scraper.  Cheetowaga is a decent place, plenty of kind people.  Don't be afraid when people come up to you and start talking.  Enjoy Dyngus day.  Get used to Tim Hortons.  Buy a Sabres or Bills jersey.  Go on Elmwood if you like hipster-ish things.  (PhD at University of Buffalo, I assume).  Get some wings at Duffs.  DON'T go to a chain for pizza.  Go to Picasso's or Molino's.  (Other places are good, too.)    Feel free to pm me with what staffing agency or what place of business and I'll give you the complete skinny on it.    It really can be a nice place to live.  Despite the cold... -_-"

Buffalo,396gwv,terradi,5,Wed Jun 10 00:41:45 2015 UTC,"Cold. Prepare yourself for cold. You may think you have warm clothes, but they will not keep you warm here. California cold ain't nothin compared to Buffalo cold. You need a heavy coat, a hat, scarf, gloves, good waterproof boots. Keep a blanket, bottled water, and some non-perishable food in your car in case you get stranded in the winter. And a snow brush, of course. And you'll need a snow shovel at home. I'm sure there's more I'm not thinking of.  On the plus side, we have great food, and all kinds of festivals in the spring and summer. Taste of Buffalo, the Allentown Art Festival, the Italian Festival, parades, and many more that I can't remember right now. And that's just the city. The burbs (including Cheektowaga) have a lot of their own stuff. You'll never be bored living here."
Buffalo,396gwv,Komacho,3,Tue Jun 9 16:45:39 2015 UTC,"In the same vien, keep your gas above a quarter tank in the winter, and be sure to get at least all season tires, if not snow tires for the winter. Your California tires will not cut it here.  As harsh as that makes the winter sounds, as long as you're prepared, it's really not that bad. And as missdawn said, the summers are awesome, with festivals just about every weekend."
Buffalo,396gwv,Komacho,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:59:29 2015 UTC,"Along these lines, make sure your windshield fluid is made to withstand a cold winter. Might be worth emptying out your fluids in the late summer/fall, before it gets cold, and replacing it with the heavy-duty stuff rather than putting it off and aiming to get to it before the temperatures drop.  Actually never had that problem in Buffalo and ran into it for the first time in another city, but it's one of those winter things you want to be prepared for, because frozen windshield fluid is a seriously dangerous situation."

Buffalo,396gwv,LonelyNixon,3,Tue Jun 9 17:06:15 2015 UTC,I haven't worn long johns or a scarf since I was like 4 years old. I mean if you are planning on playing in the snow gloves and MAYBE a scarf would be okay. But if you are just out and about and only going to be outside for 10 minutes tops none of this stuff is really required. I get annoyed when people compare Buffalo to Hoth.
Buffalo,396gwv,mycrows,3,Tue Jun 9 17:14:51 2015 UTC,"It depends on your tolerance for cold. During the last two winters, I have needed to really bundle up. And to someone coming from California, Buffalo might feel like Hoth."
Buffalo,396gwv,Eudaimonics,2,Tue Jun 9 17:21:42 2015 UTC,"I believe the point komocho is making is op doesn't need to go overkill.  They can test the waters & get shit as they need it.

If your running from heated area to heated area sure you night be fine, but worse thermal shirts, sometimes pants if I knew I was going to be out an scarfs are a must.   You're going to cry ""wha pussies""  but wear a scarf this winter. I resisted doing it well into my 20s and have nothing but regret. Such a simple addition that gives you surprising warmth.

Buffalo,39626t,ooppoop,2,Tue Jun 9 16:47:07 2015 UTC,"There absolutely is a law. The zoning board issues permits for construction like this. The permit they issued (which has the force of law) was for a fence of a certain height. The owner is building a higher fence for which he was not permitted (or so the neighbors allege). That's against the law.  It's a value judgement that this fence is attractive but the hypothetical concrete Berlin wall is not, that's why we have laws, to be clear about the rules for things and not use an arbitrary ""but it looks good"" system to decide what's allowed."
Buffalo,39626t,flancresty,3,Tue Jun 9 17:06:44 2015 UTC,"No no... Zoning are rules, not laws. Laws disambigualy have severe consequences, zoning rules, fines at best...     They applied for their permit to erect the fence, which was approved. They just attempted to squeeze a little extra beyond the zoning limitations.   Or, perhaps they didn't realize the fence would be taller in some places than 8', their footings do sit an inch or two above level ground.     Don't go and act like you haven't squeezed a little something extra beyond the rules; everyone has, even devout religious people who thought the would ""fuck"".     Geezus. The point is an artistic fence that may topple a bit over eight feet isn't an eyesore. It doesn't affect anyone. There is no permissible reason for discourse, except to just be a bunch of whiny assholes.      Oh no the fence is a bit taller than 8', that means if my children attempt to scale it, which by doing so they would be trespassing to start, & fell they could potentially injure themselves     Whatever."
Buffalo,39626t,ooppoop,2,Tue Jun 9 18:46:38 2015 UTC,"Parking laws have fines ""at best."" But zoning fines can end up with liens on properties and theoretically even seizure. Government ""rules"" like zoning exist because laws authorize them to exist. If a law says ""you can pass rules about who can build something somewhere"" and you violate the rule, you are violating the law. It's a semantic distinction at best between the two. But if the government can compel you to do something or sanction you if you don't, that's a law.  And yes, we've all jaywalked and driving over the speed limit and violated the laws and the rules. And 99% of the time it's fine, but if you do those things (including violating a building permit) you can't be mad when you have to face the consequences, even if they are rarely enforced."
Buffalo,39626t,flancresty,2,Tue Jun 9 19:00:13 2015 UTC,"""What’s happening on Nottingham Terrace is your basic neighborhood dispute. But when a tiff of this sort involves owners of some of Buffalo’s most expensive residential real estate, participants bring one of the city’s top attorneys along to make their case.  Against a fence.  Specifically, a more-than-half-million-dollar fence of hand-forged wrought iron with two massive gates.  The two gates – one 17 feet tall and the other 12 feet – already installed in front 175 Nottingham Terrace are getting some good reviews from passers-by. But many neighbors in the Delaware Park community aren’t as impressed.  In fact, residents of that area showed up, en masse, at a Zoning Board of Appeals meeting last week. They were represented by attorney Terrence M. Connors, who made a successful case for why the Zoning Board needs to reconsider whether the fence can be installed.  “This construction is illegal,” said Connors, a resident of the area whose wife signed a petition objecting to continued construction of the fence.  The petition was signed by approximately 150 people who live on Nottingham and nearby streets.  Connors told the board that portions of the fence are higher than what the board originally approved. Further, while the original plan called for an 8-foot fence along two sides of the property – Nottingham Terrace and Lincoln Parkway – work is being done to fully enclose the property, affecting homeowners on Middlesex Road and Randwood Lane as well.  “It’s a classic bait and switch,” Connors said. “The application should not have been granted.”  Connors also said deed restrictions on the property prohibit a fence from being installed without the written consent of the original developer. That developer, he said, was never asked about this fence.  “This fence is in violation,” Connors said.  The property owners, Albert and Donna Haid of Burlington, Ont., could not be reached to comment.  City officials said the homeowners can legally continue installing the fence, but at their own peril.  “They have permission to erect the entire fence if they want to,” Building Commissioner James W. Comerford Jr. said. “If the Zoning Board reverses their decision, they would have to take it down unless they pursue further court action.”  While the building permit lists the project’s cost at $650,000, other sources have told The Buffalo News it’s $800,000.  Charlie Banta is among a handful of homeowners whose property abuts the Nottingham Terrace property. He said his objections have to do with aesthetics and, more importantly, scale.  “It’s just out of scale to the neighborhood. There’s nothing even remotely similar to it in the neighborhood,” Banta said.  Beyond those concerns, he and other residents said they never got a chance to attend the initial Zoning Board hearing on the fence because of an apparent clerical error.  The Zoning Board hearing was in January 2014, but the notice sent to residents said the hearing would be December 2014.  “The notice went out for a meeting in December 2014 – 11 months after the hearing,” said William Collins, a resident who attended the meeting.  After listening to Connors and a couple of neighbors last week, the Zoning Board voted to reopen the case. At its June 24 meeting, the board will reconsider whether the fence should be approved.  What would Banta like to have happen?  “I think the neighborhood will have a response to that question at that re-hearing,” he said.  “The neighborhood is very appreciative to the Zoning Board, that they made a decision to have a rehearing on this permit,” Banta added."""

Buffalo,392zlj,a_jackson_federalist,6,Tue Jun 9 01:05:38 2015 UTC,My goodness this is an ignorant statement. Tuition is lower because SUNY has more funding than PA in terms of tax money so it can be lower.

Buffalo,392zlj,Honestzergtea,3,Tue Jun 9 03:36:50 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  He says   Our out of state tuition rates in NY need to be increased.   Well, you can do that -- and watch your out of state enrollment correspondingly drop.

I don't think 'beating Rochester and Syracuse' is much of an accomplishment either.  At least the population is pretty much the same as 15 years ago so the jobs number isn't diluted by a larger population.

Yes, we have job growth, but what is replacing those jobs lost in the recession and the decent paying manufacturing jobs?   What kind of jobs are leading the the region and what jobs are growing? It's not hard to find this out.   I looked up the info not long ago. I'll try to get it again and post it here. It's not how we want to ""rebuild"" our economy"

Buffalo,38wl2p,SoBuffaloRes,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:14:17 2015 UTC,I am not talking about pay. I am talking about work environment. You said it is a highly rated company to work at. It's the opposite.

Buffalo,38wl2p,SoBuffaloRes,2,Mon Jun 8 13:16:35 2015 UTC,Talk to some folks who work there--that's the way I came to the conclusion I have about the place. One person told me that she was sick and they fired her on the spot unless she got a doctor's order that said stay home. That's just 1 story of numerous that made me question that place.
Buffalo,38wl2p,ReverendBass,0,Mon Jun 8 14:18:17 2015 UTC,"That is pretty normal for most jobs, actually.  Especially for hourly employees.  They do get paid sick days."

Buffalo,38wl2p,716in619,2,Mon Jun 8 14:15:27 2015 UTC,he's talking about the low paying jobs that have made up alot of the new jobs in the area.
Buffalo,38wl2p,chemicalbro13,2,Tue Jun 9 11:08:14 2015 UTC,"The jobs at Geico aren't low paying.  Neither are the tech jobs I named above.  Whenever there is job creation, many of the jobs will be low-paying.  It doesn't mean they all are.  Seeing as a large proportion of the jobs were in construction, these are also not typically low paying jobs."
Buffalo,38wl2p,SoBuffaloRes,2,Mon Jun 8 03:37:02 2015 UTC,True I'm just referring to what that guy was actually saying and GEICO is a good company to work for.
Buffalo,38wl2p,chemicalbro13,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:02:16 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but you really don't know what you are talking about. I suggest you go to the dept of labor website and play around with the data and make a call to one of their data analysts  to know what the data means.

Buffalo,38wl2p,ReverendBass,2,Mon Jun 8 11:38:42 2015 UTC,"You can comb through the data too.  And, again, one of the largest growth sectors was construction.  Construction jobs are typically not low-paying."
Buffalo,38wl2p,SoBuffaloRes,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:50:06 2015 UTC,Construction is not one of the largest growth sectors here and secondly those are not permanent jobs. You have to keep that in mind.

Buffalo,38wl2p,ReverendBass,-1,Tue Jun 9 00:10:59 2015 UTC,And again: My comment had nothing to do with what Geico pays and neither did your comment as it was originally posted. Getting paid well does not make it a good place to work. And define paid well for us. What is a good salary here? What are the benchmarks you're using?
Buffalo,38wl2p,ReverendBass,2,Tue Jun 9 10:49:14 2015 UTC,"It looks like to me (Using Glassdoor) that Geico pays just above median pay for WNY, for sales and claims, right about $40K/annum.  For more technical positions, it appears they pay in the low to mid 90's.  Hourly employees are paid ~$16/hr, which is $1/hr more than what is considered a livable wage.  401K is matched by the employer, and employees there say it's great.  Health care benefits are about average.  Geico is also well know for hiring from within.  You have to know their product before you get placed in even their technical divisions.  I'd probably work there, if I was just starting my working career.  Might even stay there too from the sounds of it."
Buffalo,38wl2p,SoBuffaloRes,0,Tue Jun 9 11:52:09 2015 UTC,Thank you. That's exactly what I am talking about. We've replaced good paying jobs with credit collections and dollar general retail store employees. But hey!!! We're in a revival!   Like I said--you cannot take job growth data and use it to determine the real health of an economy.

Buffalo,38xvw3,PapaOomMowMow,3,Sun Jun 7 22:59:08 2015 UTC,"I can definitely tell you that Frank's and butter it is all Mikes uses. But it really is just getting the perfect combo of butter and sauce. I only eat medium wings so for about 20 wings, I typically use like a quarter stick of butter and about 40 shakes of a Frank's bottle."
Buffalo,38xvw3,CunderscoreF,3,Sun Jun 7 20:23:09 2015 UTC,It's been a long time since I worked at the place but I seem to recall that they used the juices from the hot pepper mix they make for subs. That could be something that adds an extra spice.
Buffalo,38xvw3,bucky716,2,Mon Jun 8 14:28:05 2015 UTC,"would the extra hot sauce be on the side? or would you get the fingers extra saucy? I've worked in a few places here and I have to say when you toss the freshly fried chicken in the sauce it adds a certain something (probably grease) that makes it just... better. Usually the recipe is franks - or a similar hot sauce based from the same pepper - and a bit of butter/butter-like substance.  If you want something spicier, you may want to try putting some hot sauce in a pot and heating it on the stove until some excess water boils off. That's what we used to do for people who wanted spicier sauce. Then add butter for more flavor and thickness"
Buffalo,38xvw3,Csquareres,2,Mon Jun 8 05:58:22 2015 UTC,Thank you for all of the comments!  I have a better direction to go in now in my quest for a dipping sauce.

I really enjoy reading them. You are doing god's work kind sir.
Buffalo,38pb6j,auburner,3,Sat Jun 6 12:03:05 2015 UTC,There really isn't any point to eating pizza if it's undercooked.  I'd take one of those burnt slices you got at Zips or LaNova in a heartbeat over undercooked dough. Could you do Ricota's on Elk?
Buffalo,38pb6j,darkviper039,3,Sat Jun 6 00:30:31 2015 UTC,Do Vinces on kenmore ave or la pizzeria on elmwood or Mike's Subs in Kenmore? or Pat's pizza on ontario in riverside
Buffalo,38pb6j,Yellowed,4,Tue Jun 9 03:29:27 2015 UTC,When I worked at Mohawk our sound guy got Prima all the time. And bitched about how bad it was all the time. Then I would order La Nova and not let him have any.

Buffalo,38pb6j,chocolate_babies,3,Fri Jun 5 20:14:30 2015 UTC,"I'm actually convinced Pizza Hut pizza is pretty decent as long as you only get a personal pan. Anything more than that, and it's gross/too much. I know this doesn't make sense, but to me it does.   Also, I actually would like to see some chain reviews at some point, just for fun. For as good as his writing is when it comes to describing pizza, I'd love to hear you review places like Little Ceasar's and Papa Johns. We shit on chain pizza places all of the time here because of how spoiled we are with great pizza, but I honestly think places like Domino's aren't half bad."

Buffalo,38k7w7,Harvey6ft,5,Thu Jun 4 19:33:50 2015 UTC,I didn't see an actual official quotes about speed bumps. In all my years of living in Buffalo I've never seen speed bumps on city streets. They are very difficult to plow over.
Buffalo,38k7w7,pete716,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:06:52 2015 UTC,"Buffalo has no god damn clue how to plow anyway, they dropped the ball and went home last winter"
Buffalo,38k7w7,darkviper039,5,Fri Jun 5 02:01:34 2015 UTC,Part of the problem was that South Buffalo was hit with an entire winter's worth of snow within one day.  This took a huge chunk of the allotted snow removal funding even before winter started.
Buffalo,38k7w7,Eudaimonics,4,Fri Jun 5 15:33:08 2015 UTC,"In all fairness, we far exceeded our snowhandling ability, due to lack of thaws during the winter.  Generally, we get 2-3 thaws each winter, where temps go above 32.  Many days, it hovers around 25, which allows snow to melt when it gets hit by sun.  Most of this winter was spent below 20 degrees."
Buffalo,38k7w7,SoBuffaloRes,14,Fri Jun 5 13:43:51 2015 UTC,"What happened last week was a tragedy and change was not only necessary, but inevitable. But this is typical knee-jerk politics.  The 198 and 33 provide the only fast route across the city. Turning the 198 into a parkway cuts off this access, reducing Buffalo's efficient multi-lanes roads to the 90 and 190 - which circle the city's perimeter.  The sensible solution was to finally build some guard rails and maybe reduce the speed to 45. But instead we get this ridiculousness."
Buffalo,38k7w7,mpwac,8,Thu Jun 4 20:39:30 2015 UTC,"This highway is windy already has a stop light, has extremely sharp sudden exits, those exists get backed up to shit because of their sharpness and they exit in awkward places(like the Delaware one),  the crummy thing cuts right through our biggest park making it inconvenient for park goers to go from one side to another,and to top it off it's only 4 miles long from 33 to 190. You totally need that unimpeded 55 mph speed limit to bridge that 4 mile gap!  You save a whole 4 minutes!   We already have a Web of highways connecting this city and no traffic. Buffalo will manage somehow. Personally I'd rather be able to enjoy a local park a bit better rather than help the people trying to pass through faster."
Buffalo,38k7w7,LonelyNixon,13,Fri Jun 5 17:19:28 2015 UTC,"https://www.dot.ny.gov/content/delivery/region5/projects/547022-home/547022-repository/NYRoute198ScajaquadaCorridorStudyJune2005NYSDOT547014BW.pdf  It's not a knee jerk. They did the study in 2005, and the recommendation was clear. The road was under designed if it was indeed to be an expressway. They're just finally acting on the clear outcomes of the study. It's a shame it took them 10 years and a tragedy to do what was right.  The only reason that it seems like a knee jerk if that the public wasn't paying attention to any of this work until something tragic and preventable happened."
Buffalo,38k7w7,aaronin,14,Fri Jun 5 00:52:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but most people are not using it to cut through the city.  Most people are going too and from Elmwood Village or North Buffalo and Buffalo State, Canisius and Medaille.  That being said, a parkway with very few traffic lights is not going to add much time to your destination.  This downgrade was actually already in the works - and some plans called for its complete removal - so we are just seeing the project expedited."
Buffalo,38k7w7,Eudaimonics,4,Thu Jun 4 20:58:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I went to a meeting about 2 years back about downgrading/removal of the 198, and Assemblyman Ryan was there and spoke, and seemed very much aware of the need for such action. I don't consider this to be a knee jerk at all."
Buffalo,38k7w7,FancyAndImportantMan,3,Thu Jun 4 21:04:14 2015 UTC,most people are not using it to cut through the city.   Do you have something to back this claim up? Because I use it that way frequently and I see plenty of cars in front and behind me doing the same.
Buffalo,38k7w7,mpwac,0,Fri Jun 5 03:13:42 2015 UTC,"The 198 and 33 provide the only fast route across the city.   Slowing down 198 doesn't cut off anything, it'll add at most 5 minutes to your drive time. OHHHH NOOOO THE HORROR!  It's sad that it took a tragedy to force the issue but it's already been talked about for years to make all of this happen."
Buffalo,38k7w7,bucky716,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:38:35 2015 UTC,Putting cross walks and traffic lights on it adds a lot more time.
Buffalo,38k7w7,Physics_Unicorn,4,Fri Jun 5 01:40:49 2015 UTC,"Google map the routes from park side to buff state. 198 is 8 minutes, and 10 minutes going Nottingham. I'm sure you can save a minute or 2 elsewhere and make the park whole again."
Buffalo,38k7w7,sobuffalo,4,Fri Jun 5 02:46:07 2015 UTC,"That's 8-10 minutes with no traffic, and doesn't account for increased traffic due to downgrading of the 198."
Buffalo,38k7w7,buffalo442,5,Fri Jun 5 04:04:57 2015 UTC,"I know it might be hard to believe but there are plenty of studies showing ""slower is faster"".  Look up ""rolling speed harmonization""  Nottingham as an alternative isn't what I'm talking about, I'm saying it's the equivalent since it's the same distance but a residential road. 198 will still be faster."
Buffalo,38k7w7,sobuffalo,5,Fri Jun 5 04:31:35 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong that the 198 will still be faster, but it will still be slower than it is now by a large measure."
Buffalo,38k7w7,Physics_Unicorn,4,Fri Jun 5 04:51:34 2015 UTC,"Come on, read the link. It explains the benefits of everyone staying at the same speed instead of everyone passing each other, or stop abruptly on the Delaware Exit.  Faster speeds does not equal faster throughput.   Do you have any studies showing otherwise? i can post more if you'd like but I think you get the point."
Buffalo,38k7w7,sobuffalo,5,Fri Jun 5 05:13:54 2015 UTC,"If you think crosswalks, traffic lights, and a significantly lower speed limit will not make it slower to traverse those few miles,  I'd say you're being deliberately obtuse. It took a few minutes to get from 190 to 33 before, with only one traffic light slowing people down."
Buffalo,38k7w7,holysweetbabyjesus,6,Fri Jun 5 12:06:40 2015 UTC,"so. to sum it up, driving any where is a complete inconvience for you because there are crosswalks, low speed limit and lights basically everywhere?"
Buffalo,38k7w7,LeJourLeFroid,4,Fri Jun 5 18:01:47 2015 UTC,"How many seconds longer do you really think it will be?  All this complaining because it MIGHT cost a few seconds? And we get a far more accessible Park. You'll live, I swear."
Buffalo,38k7w7,sobuffalo,-1,Fri Jun 5 14:56:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing with you, but rolling speed harmonization is best suited for highly congested multi-lane highways of lengths much greater than the 198.  Disregarding that the 198 doesn't have the vehicle saturation usually recommended for this concept, you just don't seen the benefit of ""slower is faster"" until you put it into practice in a stretch of road exceeding 10 miles.  Additionally, the proposed changes to the 198 go beyond just lowering the speed limit.  Additional lights, rumble strips, and other attempts to turn it into a quasi-city street will reduce the time it takes to traverse it.  By no stretch of the imagination will the proposed changes make it faster or equal to travel the 198 as it was before.  Structurally, it makes no sense to change anything about the 198 near its access points to the 190 and 33.  Those strips of expressway exist completely separate from anything remotely pedestrian or residential - they are vertically positioned in such a way that they cannot interact with the surrounding neighborhoods.  Where there exists said interaction (somewhat between Elmwood and Main), changes should be made.  I think everyone is in agreement that some sort of structure needs to be built to divide the 198 from the nearby walkways and roads.  Additionally, a lower speed limit in this section is not a bad idea.  But if you can legally travel 40 MPH on a main avenue in Buffalo, there's no reason this section should be reduced down to 30 MPH, especially considering that it connects two highways the way it does in such a short span.  If anything, the great reduction of speed is more likely to cause accidents than a more gradual one.  And let's get something else straight: this isn't about pure convenience.  I wouldn't mind adding even 10 or 15 minutes to my drive if it made sense, but this proposed change slows down cars to an unnecessary - and potentially dangerous - speed with little benefit that I can see, provided the other safeguards I've outlined are implemented.  Lastly, this is not going to increase fraternization between the two sides of Delaware Park anymore than it already exists.  There already exists a perfectly accessible bridge between the two and there is hardly any place that slowing down traffic on the 198 is going to allow for more accessibility.  Within Delaware Park, the 198 has Hoyt Lake dividing the park on the west side and Forest Lawn Cemetery dividing the park on the east side.  The only accessible corridor is near Delaware Ave - which is exactly where there is a bridge joining the two halves of the park."
Buffalo,38k7w7,sobuffalo,3,Sat Jun 6 03:45:08 2015 UTC,"Can you link to the detailed plan that shows all the traffic calming they'll use? Everything else I've seen talks in generalities.  The 198 downgrade has been talked about for decades, this is about time we get some progress. This isn't the silver bullet but it's a huge step in the right direction and I don't see the arguments on keeping it as is.  We should start ditching a lot of our highways, like I said in another post the over abundance of highways hurts neighborhoods commercial business with less and less traffic. What are the most popular neighborhoods and how far are they from highways? Elmwood and Allentown, sure it's not the only reason but it most definitely has had an effect."
Buffalo,38k7w7,sobuffalo,-1,Sat Jun 6 06:09:48 2015 UTC,"Based on comments in the media by government officials, it's safe to say that something similar to this plan will be implemented.  Elmwood is a unique ""village in a city"" that benefits from being close to colleges, hospitals, and being right in between downtown and... the 198.  But don't try using Allentown as an example of a popular neighborhood.  Seriously, the most successful part of Allentown is the bar scene.  But even Allentown is mere minutes from both the 190, the 90, and the 5 so I'm not quite sure what you're getting at when you claim that these neighborhoods are far from highways.  Look, I'm not going to debate this any further with you.  I've already wasted enough of my time doing so.  You're not going to change my mind, and I'm obviously not going to change yours.  Worst of all, I've addressed nearly everything you've brought up and provided counter-arguments, yet you've ignored every topic I've brought up and continue to find new fronts to attack from and I don't have the time or patience to deal with that sort of childish debate.  Besides, it's not like this conversation has any real-world implications - it's not like two morons arguing about this on Reddit will ultimately change the decided direction of the 198.  I will say it seems clear to me that you are passionate about fighting for your viewpoint on this topic, even if it seems like you've got your head in your ass and probably don't drive on the 198 often or have other less sincere motivations."
Buffalo,38k7w7,corp_goth,5,Sat Jun 6 12:35:09 2015 UTC,"You seem to be taking this personal. I'm not the only one that wants this, so stop acting like a spoiled little baby that think we need as many highways as we do.   I bet your from Long Island and love speeding around the highway, but Buffalo has Olmsted parks and many of us like to appreciate them.   You're only argument is to not change because this isn't a perfect plan, that doesn't prove anything. You also try to insinuate I don't use the 198? I'll take the rest of your argument as pure speculation and ""the sky is falling"" mentality.   I bet you $100 that in 5 years this won't even be an issue."
Buffalo,38k7w7,sobuffalo,2,Sat Jun 6 13:03:34 2015 UTC,Yeah property on Nottingham > Parkside you're going to have mega speed bumps & a 25 mph or something else to keep the rift raft from using it as an alternative route.
Buffalo,38k7w7,SoBuffaloRes,3,Fri Jun 5 05:26:07 2015 UTC,"like I mentioned elsewhere, I meant that just as a comparison on the distance. I honestly don't think people will be finding alternative routes, which other alternative won't cost the precious minute or 2 extra? That's if you use the entire thing, the difference if you go from Elmwood to the 190 or something will make it even less significant.  People complaining about drive times...in Buffalo? Come on"
Buffalo,38k7w7,TOMALTACH,2,Fri Jun 5 05:38:02 2015 UTC,People who complain about longer drive times in Buffalo have obviously never spent much time outside of Buffalo.  6 hours to get from the north end to the south end of Chicago.  On the interstate.
Buffalo,38k7w7,mpwac,3,Sat Jun 6 23:04:34 2015 UTC,"I really do not understand why everyone is in such a hurry to get somewhere. It really doesn't take a whole bunch of time to get from point a to point b in this city WITHOUT an expressway route. try leaving earlier if you're concerned about travel time.      I hate driving on the 198. I'll only use it if i absolutely need to. It's far too narrow & windy for the stupidity of the drivers on it and their half-assed confident-less maneuvers. looking forward to it being converted to a parkway, even better if they include landscaped earth along it; natural attractive barriers such as berms & trees.  I also hope the delaware west bound exit is rescaped so that there isn't a massive hazard line of cars waiting to exit."
Buffalo,38k7w7,SoBuffaloRes,4,Fri Jun 5 13:48:40 2015 UTC,"The 198 does not directly interact with any residential areas in its present form.  In fact, the majority of it is very separated as it exists above or below the normal residential streets.  There is a brief section of the 198 that is hazardous to residents if they walk along the areas that are close to it inside Delaware Park.  Horrible as the incident last week was, let's remember that for many years with who knows how many drivers and pedestrians utilizing the 198, there was little to no problems in the grand scheme of things.  Opinions on this seem polarizing, but it's really not that difficult to solve.  You leave the majority of the 198 as it is.  For those sections that are near pedestrian foot traffic (essentially between Elmwood and Main), you place guard rails and reduce the speed somewhat (I don't personally think it should be 30, but I'd be okay with it in this small section) and that's it.  Problem solved."
Buffalo,38k7w7,mpwac,-2,Fri Jun 5 03:09:27 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%. But the well-to-do Parkside residents don't want to actually reduce potential accidents - they want to reduce traffic in their neighborhood. They've been pushing this for years and just now have the public sympathy they need to reduce the ""trash"" that's driving through their neighborhood - which incidentally will drive up their house values more."
Buffalo,38k7w7,SoBuffaloRes,7,Fri Jun 5 03:19:55 2015 UTC,"And, it's a problem when residents of a neighborhood get to self-determine what their neighborhood looks like?"
Buffalo,38k7w7,LonelyNixon,-2,Fri Jun 5 13:42:16 2015 UTC,"Not at all. But isn't interesting that only the wealthy with the political pull and influence get a chance to do so?  There's another park in the area that is divided by a highway.  One with a view of the sun setting over the water -a rarity for east coast cities. Like Delaware, this park requires local residents to cross a bridge to experience the full beauty it has to offer.  The residents dislike the noise and pollution the nearby highway produces, but they are powerless to change things. Despite many protests and campaigns and pleads to the local government, they are told that easily accessible avenues are too important to change anything.   Welcome to Riverside. And Black Rock. And all the other poorer neighborhoods that live along the 190/Niagara River.  How would you feel if these sections of the 190 were turned into ""parkways"" where you could only travel down upon at 30 miles per hour and were stopped multiple times by street lights?"
Buffalo,38k7w7,corp_goth,3,Sat Jun 6 04:27:19 2015 UTC,"Riverside park is cut in half?  For the 30 or so years I lived there, I never felt that way.  The 190 is at the edge of the park, and largely out of view, with about 60-120 feet between the park and the 190, not including Niagara St which runs along it.  There is a very tiny number of folk in Riverside that feel the 190 is a blight, as it's at the outermost edge of the neighborhood.  Those same folk also want to get rid of Schaeffer Village projects, and want all non-White owned businesses out of the neighborhood.  In fact, most residents of Riverside just want better signage to indicate the amenities of the neighborhood available on the exits, and perhaps one additional exit in the neighborhood.  I know, because I was a regular attender of the Rediscover Riverside group when I lived there.  Now, if the 190 was converted to a parkway?  I'd love it.  Wont happen, as it's an arterial for the city.  Niagara St. being the model complete street is great."
Buffalo,38k7w7,whirlpool138,3,Sat Jun 6 22:56:17 2015 UTC,Honestly any resident in any neighbor regardless of class probably would rather that the street in front of their house isn't simply an artery or expressway from one place to another.   You say that like it's wrong for homeowners and residents(Parkside being a big area with lots of apartments along it as well) to rather their neighborhood not be an expressway.

The fact that these guys thought that bolting climbing holds directly into the concrete was a good long term solution really shows how much they actually know about indoor climbing and frankly climbing in general.   This project was doomed from the start.  Hopefully for their own sake they hire someone that actually has an actual clue as to what a real climbing gym is and not just what makes for a good one time circus ride like climbing on the outside of a silo.  Oh by the way, this was never intended to be 4 season fun.  No heating in the huge silo chambers along with not being able to insulate the concrete means when you wana have a good time inside during the winter, their doors are closed because it is too cold.

Buffalo,38k4h0,thegangler,2,Thu Jun 4 23:21:36 2015 UTC,Cool looking place! They send water down the outside in the winter?   Certainly could have been a great facility in silo city but the people starting it up were pretty clueless to climbing in general so I doubt making good ice would even be something they were capable of.

Personally I think 35-40 is a nice sweet spot until they actually do downgrade it given that nothing has changed except for the speed limit.   That said I suspect it's just this way because they have to take into account the people who speed. Many of whom will see the 30 mph sign and go 40 instead of seeing a 40mph sign and go 50-60.

Buffalo,38fdrd,NinjaPointGuard,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:46:04 2015 UTC,"Well a major problem is that when you live in a poor home environment and go to school where you are only interacting with other kids from poor home environments, this makes poverty normal and reinforces the anti-intellectualism that thrives in cyclical poverty communities.  The only way to break the cycle is to empower these kids from a young age to strive to do their best. This is made a lot easier if they are not completely immersed in poverty at every level.  We need to de-centralize poverty and stop sweeping it under the rug and banishing it to the Eastside if we ever want to see improvement.   As for the counterpoint that poor students will bring down the averages in suburban districts, I think its good to remember that suburban students in good to excellent performing schools outnumber the 47,000 BPS students - not all of which are poor performing - almost 4:1.  Don't worry, gentrification in the city is pushing the poor out into the cheap first ring suburbs anyways. Either we can work for a solution now, or deal with it later.  Obviously this is a complex problem and there will never be a ""one-size-fits-all"" solution."

The possibility and likeliness of the Buffalo children being ostracized by the suburban kids is also a concern."

Buffalo,388dvi,pete716,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:08:00 2015 UTC,Either it's some other random Art Deco building or it's a photoshopped version of our City Hall. It's missing the third lower tier.
Buffalo,388dvi,dr_w,15,Tue Jun 2 19:53:05 2015 UTC,are you saying this could be photoshopped?

The playground is unlike anything I've seen, but it's a lawsuit waiting to happen. We were down there for about two hours and I saw a lot of kids fall pretty bad. One girl fell about fifteen feet and her mom scooped her up and left, so I'm not sure what happened."
Buffalo,38957u,holysweetbabyjesus,5,Wed Jun 3 21:03:53 2015 UTC,Maybe her mother should be paying attention if she's climbing 15 feet off the ground.

Buffalo,38957u,SoBuffaloRes,2,Thu Jun 4 22:42:24 2015 UTC,"15 feet? that seems exaggerated. did the child stand on the highest rail then leap off of it? i'm gonna go ahead and say the dude in this image closest to the playground is six feet tall. considering that, the top platform is at most eight feet.    kids fall. even batman knows that, we fall to learn to pick ourselves up. or, perhaps, the parents probably should just be watching their kids or playing along with them."
Buffalo,38957u,LeJourLeFroid,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:58:29 2015 UTC,"I was actually more worried about the rocks that you sit on in the playground, I watched kids running up to their parents and all I thought of was one of those going head first into a rock.  That being said it is pretty awesome, and the one tall structure that kids can climb is off set in its own area and every kid I saw was being watched by their parents, it's no difference then a kid climbing a tree.  I saw more kids trip over their own feet."

Buffalo,388prv,thephisher,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:11:09 2015 UTC,Went to a few of these concerts over the past few years and they have been pretty bad. The bands never start at the scheduled time. they usually go on early and you miss half the show. You have to buy expensive tickets to get drinks and the workers are rude. Seems to be run pretty poorly. At least they are not charging admission this year.
Buffalo,387xfs,zigmachine,4,Tue Jun 2 14:18:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Ralph is in the middle of the suburbs and there are not even any good hotels within walking distance (just a bunch of ratty motels).  There is also is not much in the way of nightlife there. Most bars close down by Midnight.  I would definitely stay downtown or in Allentown and invest in the $30 taxi ride. I would ask around. Maybe you can find some others to lessen the fare.  Downtown and Allentown are within walking distance (or a $5 cab ride) from each other. Downtown you have a lot of clubs on Chippewa that will be pumping on a Saturday night.   Allentown has a lot of dives, indie music venues, and some nicer places in between and is a much more relaxed atmosphere.  Between Allen and Chippewa (20 minute walk) there are a lot of other bars spread a part.  Last call is at 4 am."
Buffalo,387xfs,Eudaimonics,3,Tue Jun 2 16:01:36 2015 UTC,No nightlife in the area  No public trans to and from the arena

Buffalo,387xfs,Yellowed,2,Tue Jun 2 16:36:53 2015 UTC,"Wherever you stay, the only means to and from the stadium are a rented car or taxi. There are no hotels/motels in walking distance and no public transportation to/from Orchard Park. The stadium is not in the city proper, but about 20-30 minutes down the highway, in a family-friendly suburban town bordering the countryside. In downtown Buffalo, the nightlife areas are Chippewa, Elmwood, and Allentown."
Buffalo,387xfs,prunillebaudelaire,3,Tue Jun 2 15:37:40 2015 UTC,"Stay in downtown Buffalo Friday night and stay at the motel by the stadium for the concert, I'm sure there will be plenty of people around after the show for some semi-nightlife."

You might also check if any bars are offering a shuttle to and from the concert, I've seen this done for football games and country concerts."

Buffalo,380tol,pete716,29,Mon Jun 1 00:45:39 2015 UTC,Personally I don't think a reduction in the speed limit is the appropriate knee-jerk reaction to the accident. Why wouldn't a barrier or guard rail be put up? Something that would actually prevent a future tragedy. During rush hour nobody can drive 50mph and they don't. 30mph is completely unnecessary for a non-residential road in my opinion.
Buffalo,380tol,nateholme,7,Mon Jun 1 01:14:52 2015 UTC,They are putting barriers up too from the press conference tonight.
Buffalo,380tol,JaneEyreForce,6,Mon Jun 1 01:20:17 2015 UTC,"Why wouldn't a barrier or guard rail be put up   because that takes too much time, I'm sure it'll happen eventually, but imagine the outrage if they told everyone ""yeah, they'll be up in a month"" after what just happened? I would be afraid of it happening again before then. Not to mention all of the families that would avoid Delaware Park, or at least the area around the 198.   Classic case of ""they gotta do something"". And I don't blame them."
Buffalo,380tol,AngrySquirrel,8,Mon Jun 1 01:23:02 2015 UTC,"They are installing barriers. Per the article, temporary barriers (probably concrete Jersey barriers, I imagine) will go up immediately until ""park-appropriate"" barriers are designed and installed."
Buffalo,380tol,flancresty,14,Mon Jun 1 07:45:30 2015 UTC,"It goes right through the middle of Delaware park, it is absolutely a residential road and should be regulated as such. It's a parkway in that section, not a freeway.  It's a shame it takes tragedy for government to act quickly, but given how slowly they typically act, at least they are."
Buffalo,380tol,nateholme,14,Mon Jun 1 12:55:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry you are not correct. Technically it is an expressway operated by the NYS DOT. Residential roads are just that. Residential, meaning people live on the road. RT-198 is not a road people live on."
Buffalo,380tol,ryannellis,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:27:16 2015 UTC,"It's not technically a residential road, but it is simply a road that has heavy foot traffic. I suppose you could make the argument that it's a parkway.  All in all it doesn't matter. It's a densely populated area with both heavy commute traffic and foot traffic. Lowering the speed limit makes people perk up and take notice as to where they are (at least in theory). I don't see anything wrong with reducing the speed. Slow down and be safe. They're also adding barriers."
Buffalo,380tol,nateholme,6,Mon Jun 1 16:54:49 2015 UTC,"I'm all in favor of safety, but there is not foot traffic on the 198."
Buffalo,380tol,LeJourLeFroid,2,Mon Jun 1 19:32:31 2015 UTC,"Sure there is...within twenty feet of the west bound lanes lies ring road, plenty of foot traffic.   It's no different than a residential road  with parked cars between pedestrians & traffic."
Buffalo,380tol,MyDogShitsTigers,2,Mon Jun 1 21:05:39 2015 UTC,Seems like a good place to put up guard rails rather than slow down traffic because of one tragedy that could have been prevented with guard rails.
Buffalo,380tol,SoBuffaloRes,3,Tue Jun 2 20:39:21 2015 UTC,It's not really a knee jerk reaction.  This has been in the planning phase for a few years now: https://www.dot.ny.gov/scajaquadacorridor

Like, I feel it's not safe to be going that fast through an area like that, and it even borderline feels illegal, but I know it wasn't because hey, that's the speed limit. If that makes sense."
Buffalo,380tol,CholentPot,8,Mon Jun 1 01:26:07 2015 UTC,Just drove it. Doing 30 on this road is stupid. Put up some guard rails or something. Change speed to 40. 30 is much to low for a road with no stop signs or traffic lights.   Slower may not be safer.
Buffalo,380tol,TOMALTACH,4,Mon Jun 1 20:07:16 2015 UTC,Barriers were installed today for portions of the 198 near the park. My kids are playing soccer there on Tuesday and I'm glad to know cars won't be ripping by there at 60+mph.
Buffalo,380tol,CholentPot,-5,Mon Jun 1 20:09:31 2015 UTC,"Sure, I agree but this is not the way law and order works. Where's the voting? Where's the public opinion? Traffic pattern studies?

Buffalo,380tol,BassoonHero,10,Mon Jun 1 20:17:47 2015 UTC,"the 198 is a state maintained expressway, not city.    voting? traffic studies? damn, there's been discussion to rescape the entire road back to a  slowed parkway for the past five years. I don't like driving on it & avoid using it if at all possible. it's far too narrow for 50mph tagged on with people who don't know how to look before switching lanes or signal for that matter."
Buffalo,380tol,AngrySquirrel,-1,Mon Jun 1 20:22:15 2015 UTC,"You're right about the State Expressway. Still seems weird how somethings get done overnight and other drag out. It's almost as if they were waiting for a tragedy, seems like they had a load of 30mph signs stocked up somewhere so they can pull them out overnight.   When the government works this fast and efficiently it rubs me wrong."
Buffalo,380tol,Swing_Top,3,Mon Jun 1 20:26:16 2015 UTC,seems like they had a load of 30mph signs stocked up somewhere so they can pull them out overnight.   This seems like a totally reasonable thing for highway department to have on hand.

Buffalo,380tol,buffalo442,2,Mon Jun 1 15:30:03 2015 UTC,What happened is a tragedy but dropping the speed limit from 50 to 30 is absurd seeing as its the lone quick rout from Eastern to Western parts of the city.   I'm just glad to be done with College because I used that road five days a week to get to school.
Buffalo,380tol,LonelyNixon,6,Thu Jun 4 20:32:56 2015 UTC,"So basically the next week don't drive on here because there will actually be cops patrolling.

You do realize that it's a safety law to move out of the lane to give the officer a space of safety if they have their lights on right?  Any service vehicle with lights for that matter."
Buffalo,380tol,flancresty,2,Mon Jun 1 13:26:14 2015 UTC,"I see it all the time actually.  That law was passed because an elderly man hit the cop while he had someone pulled over right near an entrance to a highway. So if that law was in place at the time, then that person would technically be breaking the law just by using the entrance ramp.  What should have been done instead is that troopers and cops should have been educated on approaching cars at the passenger side while parking their car slightly outside the car they pulled over.  Almost every other state has been doing this for years.  I understand the safety aspect, but it's made things more dangerous for drivers because people misunderstand the law.  If an emergency vehicle is on the side of the road then drivers must move to the open lane, if there's no open lane then you stay in your lane."
Buffalo,380tol,buffalo442,2,Mon Jun 1 18:45:28 2015 UTC,"No they wouldn't have.  If you can't change lanes (either due to them not existing, or someone blocking you) you can slow down to comply with the law.  You could use the entrance ramp as long as you go slow and exercise caution."
Buffalo,380tol,LeJourLeFroid,0,Mon Jun 1 22:42:40 2015 UTC,This is a good thing to happen. As others have noted a barrier has also been mandated by the Governor. I imagine the planning of the the barrier has already started and I hope ground breaks this week.
Buffalo,380tol,buffalo442,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:31:00 2015 UTC,I just drove down the 198 east from Parkside. There are earth movers in the area (working on barrier) and there are 3 cop cars along the roadway with lights on shooting radar.
Buffalo,380tol,LeJourLeFroid,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:53:37 2015 UTC,This kinda Sucks. Either downgrade the highway into a Parkway or an actual road or put up a big barrier with more crosses to the other side. Don't do this though. 30 mph speed limit and a wall separating it from the park is dumb
Buffalo,380tol,Fudgeworth,4,Tue Jun 2 14:52:35 2015 UTC,"Nothing will change. Drivers will continue to operate vehicles impatiently & recklessly. It is bs that the cause of the driver's actions had yet to be released pending investigation.  Seems like they would know within  24hrs.    Cars can still go over/through guard rails. I would have been impressed if the city/state closed the road to immediately convert it to a Parkway lined with trees, land mass berms & elegant prefab printed stone/brick concrete barriers.    There better be troopers enforcing it at the very least."
Buffalo,380tol,AngrySquirrel,4,Mon Jun 1 02:26:29 2015 UTC,"If the speed limit is 30, then people will drive 35 or 40 instead of 55 or 60 as they did when it was 50. That alone gives a much wider margin for error for drivers, if they do get out of control, they need less distance to stop. We'll see what the investigation says, but a reduction in the speed limit will reduce speeds.  If they slap a speed camera (not advocating for this as I think they are invasions of privacy and arguably unconstitutional [I can't ""confront"" my accuser if it's a camera]) that would solve the enforcement issue which I agree will be problematic and potentially create its own safety issues (where do you pull over to get your ticket?)."
Buffalo,380tol,AngrySquirrel,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:59:16 2015 UTC,Hard to see where they could enforce it from though.  There's no shoulder.
Buffalo,380tol,boccelino,4,Mon Jun 1 03:26:06 2015 UTC,"The can post up on the island at humbolt/198west or they can set up at the 33west/198 interchange merge ramp I don't think there's any law that says you have to shoulder you're vehicle when being pulled over, fairly certain you are only required to be as far right as possible (there are roads without shoulders where officers pull over vehicles).      Personally I feel the speed limit drop should be posted prior to the pedestrian bridge over the 33 by west delevan (it is) & prior to/entering the 198 exit/merge ramp from the 33, not just before the main street bridge."
Buffalo,380tol,bucky716,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:05:34 2015 UTC,"Those spots aren't in the 30 mph zone though.  Not saying that people couldn't be pulled over in the right lane, but where would the cops sit to operate the radar?"
Buffalo,380tol,FancyAndImportantMan,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:46:50 2015 UTC,"Eh?  They sure are in the zone. Signs are posted immediately after the pedestrian bridge by west delevan on 33 east bound side. 5-0 could sit in those trianglar spaces where interchanges merge same as they do on the 90, 290, 190, 400, 219, etc"
Buffalo,380tol,BassoonHero,2,Mon Jun 1 23:19:35 2015 UTC,I've seen Buffalo PD parked here near the large antenna in the past.  I don't think they were doing radar but that's a spot where they could do it.
Buffalo,380tol,JimboJimboSlicee,0,Mon Jun 1 03:35:02 2015 UTC,They could also set up by the parks facility on the other side of the road at that point to cover eastbound traffic.
Buffalo,380tol,bflo666,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:37:47 2015 UTC,"There aren't many ideal places to set up for enforcement, but they could also just go over the curb with an SUV and work off the side of the road. Air-based enforcement would be a possibility as well."
Buffalo,380tol,buffalo442,2,Mon Jun 1 07:40:06 2015 UTC,Air-based enforcement would be a possibility as well.   With Predator drones.
Buffalo,380tol,bflo666,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:16:38 2015 UTC,I can smell a massive lawsuit coming based off of the rapid change after the tragedy. Sad that this is what it took to finally get things moving to change the 198 into a parkway and not an expressway.
Buffalo,380tol,TweetPoster,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:46:19 2015 UTC,I personally don't have a use for the 198. I can get to my house just as easily if I go southbound on main or get off at ferry on humboldt. You can get to the 190 north by the 90 or 290 south from the 33 through oak. Does anyone have a practical use for the 198? I'm curious what others think.
Buffalo,380tol,Ebscer,4,Mon Jun 1 13:58:09 2015 UTC,"It's the only quick way to get from my apartment to the 190. Reducing the speed limit is a very mild inconvenience that might add 2 minutes to my commute. Removing the route entirely would force me to drive miles in bumper-to-bumper traffic on the surface streets, adding probably 10-15 minutes twice a day. With the 198 gone, every major east-west street would look like Parkside during rush hour.  It was a mistake to build the 198 there, but a lot of people have come to rely on it in the last half-century. Reducing the speed limit in the park is a no-brainer, but they can't simply remove the road without really screwing over people who rely on it for their daily commute."

Buffalo,380i4k,BuffalosDeigo,2,Mon Jun 1 00:09:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, Audobon is open to the public.  Brighton isn't too far away, and neither is Sheridan.

Buffalo,37zowm,aliciaayn,2,Wed Jun 3 01:47:18 2015 UTC,"Yep, what everybody else said is good. The Elmwood/Allentown area is great if you're young. Elmwood's a little more bougie and Allentown's a little more hipster.  I would recommend staying mostly east of Richmond. West of that is an up and coming area, but might be a little rougher than you're bargaining for. If you are comfortable in that kind of thing, the grant-ferry area (near Sweetness 7 on grant) and the D'youville area (near horsefeathers market) would be where to look. And you'd probably end up saving almost half your budget.  On the east, to be within walking distance of things, stay west of Delaware. Anything past Linwood pretty rapidly depletes, and east of main gets scary.  And again, to be in walking distance, stay south of buff state (forrestish).   A little bit north of that, the Hertel area (Hertel between delaware and main-ish) is neat too.  If you're looking for something more suburban, Williamsville and East Aurora are both very nice. North of the city (Amherst) is the more populated of the suburbs so there's more traffic, but in general it gets a little less snow that the southtowns.   Oh and if you're here by July 11th-12th, try to get to the taste of buffalo. It'd be a great way to acquaint yourself with the city.   Edit: Btw, Craigslist is probably the easiest to find something in the area. Just be sure to take the proper precautions and see the place before you hand over any money and all that."

Buffalo,37va84,Common_loon,2,Sat May 30 18:32:43 2015 UTC,Just went to get takeout and DOT has variable message boards posting a new 30 MPH speed limit. So terrible  that this had to happen to push this change.

Buffalo,37va84,dogscandance,3,Sat May 30 18:42:19 2015 UTC,I think it's more the state's fault. It is a state expressway.

Buffalo,37va84,_The_Bright_Side_,3,Sun May 31 00:11:34 2015 UTC,I drove by the accident around 20-30 mins after it happened. Seeing the cop laying evidence cones by the broken stroller was really heartbreaking.
Buffalo,37va84,Moofrooo,2,Sun May 31 15:54:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was just trying to get of Parkside at the time and got pissed when I saw it was closed (I thought it was because of the race). Now I feel like an ass."
Buffalo,37va84,FancyAndImportantMan,5,Sun May 31 16:21:51 2015 UTC,"Why did the car go off the highway in the first place?  The right lane ends right after the traffic light.     People often go in that lane in order to pass all the cars that are stopped at the light. They then expect to be let back in.  Maybe the driver did this, unsuccessfully passing the other cars on the right, having no room to get back in, and going off the curb.  I always call that lane the asshole lane.   I bet that's what happened."
Buffalo,37va84,maxwell7301,5,Sun May 31 03:23:38 2015 UTC,"Your comments here really make it clear you are the asshole. Not letting people merge properly is aggressive and causes accidents. Also, check out the discussion from a previous time somebody brought up the ""asshole lane""   http://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/2c4xop/the_one_thing_everyone_in_buffalo_can_agree_on/  It's clearly not something everybody will agree on but your job on the road is to safely operate your own vehicle. Not police and block other traffic from a safe zipper merge. I have never been in an accident and regularly practice these proven safe driving techniques."
Buffalo,37va84,nateholme,1 point,Mon Jun 1 12:59:54 2015 UTC,"I do let people merge in most cases.  It's only the situation where you wait in line to enter a ramp for 10 minutes, and another car passes hundreds of cars and expects to be let in at the very front of the line.  This often happens on the ramp to the 33 from the 198.   The airport ramp gets backed up past the parkside traffic light, and the downtown ramp is basically empty from the traffic light.   I've seen people try to go from the far left lane at 60 mph try to merge into the far right lane, which is a stand still.   That's not safe."
Buffalo,37va84,maxwell7301,-3,Mon Jun 1 15:10:57 2015 UTC,"So,  does that include the people wishing to merge 198w from off Parkside,  they're assholes to you? You're cool."
Buffalo,37va84,LeJourLeFroid,5,Sun May 31 06:20:05 2015 UTC,"They're not assholes if they come from Parkside.   Only people going straight from the light.  The asshole lane is this: http://i.imgur.com/wIWdMiH.jpg  It's the worst when there are many cars waiting at the light in the 2 other lanes to the left, and other cars whiz by in this right lane to pass everybody."
Buffalo,37va84,maxwell7301,2,Sun May 31 16:15:27 2015 UTC,"I agree there are assholes who use that lane inappropriately, it's meant for those merging in from Humboldt & Parkside. It's the same with the 33 interchange. Ppl going to the 33 east from main don't know how to utilize the right lane to reduce the line of traffic going to 33 then there are the assholes who block traffic needing to merge to the 33west just so they can get ahead in the line. O well. It won't change, cause people don't know how to drive selflessly"
Buffalo,37va84,LeJourLeFroid,3,Sun May 31 16:40:37 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's the other asshole lane.     When you wait your turn to get on the 33, and cars whiz by on the left, and expect to cut the entire line.     I never let them in.  They have to go Downtown."
Buffalo,37va84,maxwell7301,2,Sun May 31 16:43:58 2015 UTC,"I'd think so since there is a yield sign. If you yield to traffic, how are you merging? There is a light that gives plenty of opportunity to go when traffic isn't whizzing by. just my 2 cents"
Buffalo,37va84,sobuffalo,1 point,Sun May 31 14:51:20 2015 UTC,Lol but those people from Parkside aren't assholes unless they try to jump in traffic like an asshole cutting off someone else. O well

Teddy Roosevelt Inauguration National Historic Site - Where the resident took the oath of office following the assassination of William McKinley at the 1901 World's Fair Buffalo & Erie County Naval Park and Museum - Tour 3 WWII vessels including a submarine, cruiser and a destroyer. Also, check out nearby Canalside. Albright-Knox Art Gallery - Wahol, Picasso, Van Gogh, etc. Also check out the Penny Burchfield Gallery and the Buffalo History Museum nearby if you have time. Delaware Park is also nice to explore. Walkable historic neighborhoods - these are the real reason people love Buffalo. Check out Allentown, Elmwood Village and North Buffalo/Hertel Ave   Tips   Grab an Artvoice - its a free weekly magazine lisitng everything going on that week by genre and event type. The Metrorail is free to ride downtown on the above ground section. Just hop on and off. Last call is at 4 am - Chippewa Street for Clubs; Allen Street for dives and indie music venues; Elmwood Ave for college bars, dives and young professional hangouts."

Buffalo,37jng2,OnlineDegen,6,Thu May 28 02:46:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know but last time I tried selling a car on craigslist I got an unbelievable amount of shitty lowballs and trade offers.  Maybe they're just listing a high price to offset that.  I see you're asking 12,000 for your car, will you accept 2,000?  Yo I got a 4wd quad with no gas tank and 16 quarts of slightly expired baby formula, straight trade?  Lastly, and this is only semi-related, I'm selling a BMW race car that I built several years ago.  I'm asking 20,000.  It has thousands of hours of work and close to 50 grand in parts.  Some dipshit was genuinely shocked that I wasn't interested in trading my car for his bone stock version of the exact same car.  It seriously has a book value of under 4000 dollars...  AND he wanted money on top.  I know it might seem like he was trolling me, but I assure you he was not."

Buffalo,37jng2,YOUDONTEVENKNOWME,1 point,Thu May 28 20:18:02 2015 UTC,I think the main problem with cars on Craigslist is the lack of listings due to the relatively small population of the Buffalo Area. At most you usually only have a handful of listings of your vehicle to choose from so most people listing them don't have a lot to go on so they likely use KBB to value them which is notoriously inaccurate. Like anything else you buy you just need to be a savvy shopper.
Buffalo,37jng2,blackpony04,1 point,Thu May 28 10:24:41 2015 UTC,"i recently bought a 2006 jeep grand cherokee for $4000 on cl.  that was the asking price, and i tried to get him to go lower and he wouldn't.  it was a really great price though"
Buffalo,37jng2,bufffalove,1 point,Fri May 29 13:13:42 2015 UTC,"I'm into cars, and Craigslist is just an absolutely terrible place to buy vehicles. In my experiences with the site, about 3/4 people on there are really strange, and don't have a clue about their own car. So, as a result, you get all sorts of old rusty garbage that people have ""modified"" or tinkered with, despite not knowing what they are doing. In other words, almost everything on that site is super sketchy, even if it looks nice. Plus, this is Buffalo, so the underside of almost everything will look like it's been submerged in saltwater for a decade.   Since I'm a little crazy and enjoy buying other people's ""project cars,"" I bought a 2000 Acura Integra that someone had brought up from California. I paid $3900 upfront for it, and have spent $2000 and several months repairing everything from the steering rack to the exhaust. I have yet to rectify a random cylinder misfire and a potentially bent upper control arm.   In other words: if you're like me, and enjoy working on your own car, then CL is a neat place. If not, then just pay the extra money to buy a truck from a reputable used car dealer. You'll get such a better vehicle for your money."
Buffalo,37jng2,CaleYarborough,-1,Sat May 30 03:25:14 2015 UTC,I was talking to a dealer last week and he mentioned that they aren't listing things on CL anymore because it requires payment. Found a great deal on a used van after hunting around a bit.

Buffalo,37jng2,thebenson,3,Thu May 28 04:13:48 2015 UTC,"This isnt very good advice. I've bought my last 6 vehicles from CL and got exactly what I paid for. $500 VW Jetta that needed work, got what I needed for a year. $10k minivan, still running strong. Having a bit of known how goes a long way. It's no different than buying anywhere else used.  OP: Last thing I picked up was an 8yr old Mazda minivan w/ low mileage for about $9000 a few years ago. It took us about 3 months of looking. I've found cars or other big price things in as little as a couple of weeks or as long as 6 months. There was a lot of over priced stuff, even from some big name used car dealers."
Buffalo,37jng2,irons,2,Thu May 28 08:02:52 2015 UTC,"This is bad advice. If you know a mechanic, have them look at it. Get the carfax. You can find really good value in motor vehicles when you cut out a middle man dealership."

Buffalo,37h7j9,SoBuffaloRes,3,Wed May 27 22:53:22 2015 UTC,"I think we have two different outlooks on this. It seems that you believe that peds and cyclists have priority over vehicular traffic.   I'm of the opinion that a tradeoff is not necessary. Sure, there's idiot drivers out there, but does that really merit slashing access to a big chunk of the park in order to establish a car-free zone?  Since it seems that you frequent the park, I'm sure you've seen how many gatherings and parties are held there. Next time you're there on a weekend, and a family is relegated to one of those decomposing picnic tables that is slapped in the woods, do them a favor and walk their stuff up the Ward Hill Walkway to one of those shelters.   It may have been knocked down, but you're at least spreading the message."
Buffalo,37h7j9,SoBuffaloRes,2,Thu May 28 05:31:25 2015 UTC,"I think we have two different outlooks on this. It seems that you believe that peds and cyclists have priority over vehicular traffic.   No, I don't.  I believe strong multi-modal access to our region's resources are a requirement, not a ""Nice to have"".  But parks are there for people, not cars.  So, a loop was returned to foot traffic and cyclists, not cars.  So, walk a bit further.  If a family is in the woods, why would they care about a picnic table?  There are lots of trunks to sit on, and plenty of clearings where they can plunk down a blanket, and enjoy their time.  You don't need a table.  Or, they could do themselves a favor, and walk their gear to the destination of choice.  My family does it weekly."
Buffalo,37h7j9,justwanttolurk,1 point,Thu May 28 11:01:12 2015 UTC,"I believe strong multi-modal access to our region's resources are a requirement,   Obviously, you do not if you think that cutting off road access to a third of one side of the park is an acceptable course of action.    If a family is in the woods, why would they care about a picnic table?   I'm starting to think that you're full of it about frequenting the ridge. The number of people and families who go there to hike in the woods are far outnumbered by those who use the shelters, playgrounds, sporting facilities, etc.   Look, we can't all be Swiss Family McGee, and as u/sobuffalo said, the Ridge is not a nature preserve."
Buffalo,37h7j9,SoBuffaloRes,2,Thu May 28 14:00:45 2015 UTC,"Obviously, you do not if you think that cutting off road access to a third of one side of the park is an acceptable course of action.   Of course it is.  Cars can still get to the park.  Once there, people can switch to foot/bike in the park.  If only we would focus on getting public transport to this park, and improve cycling routes to it as well.  Crossing the 20A/240/277 intersection by anything but car can be quite challenging.   I'm starting to think that you're full of it about frequenting the ridge. The number of people and families who go there to hike in the woods are far outnumbered by those who use the shelters, playgrounds, sporting facilities, etc   I know this is the case.  Which is why having more areas open exclusively to foot traffic is a good thing.   Look, we can't all be Swiss Family McGee, and as u/sobuffalo said, the Ridge is not a nature preserve.   Nobody is suggesting everyone can be.  However, we should promote outdoor, on foot, exploration.  It's good for physical and mental health, and good for the environment."
Buffalo,37h7j9,justwanttolurk,0,Thu May 28 14:21:16 2015 UTC,"If a family is in the woods, why would they care about a picnic table? There are lots of trunks to sit on, and plenty of clearings where they can plunk down a blanket, and enjoy their time. You don't need a table.  Or, they could do themselves a favor, and walk their gear to the destination of choice. My family does it weekly.   What?    First off, Chestnut Ridge is not 'the woods' but rather a park.  There is a big difference.  While there are tails and plenty of nature to enjoy, it's still a park.  Suggesting that people scramble to find tree trunks to have a picnic is absurd.   If you're all about the enjoyment of nature without things like roads, shelters or tables in view...that's fantastic.  Go on a hike in the woods.  Secondly, it's pretty arrogant to suggest a County Park should be accessible to those who can walk.  What about the people who can't walk great distances or walk at all?  Not only is accessibility a fundamental requirement for any public space, it's silly to suggest people wanting to have a gathering larger than a few people trek their food and drinks into a 1,200 acre park.    I get the whole 'you don't like cars' and want as much nature to yourself as possible but that's not how public parks work."

You said so yourself:  it's only 1/3 of the park that is off limits to CARS.  Wheel chairs are cool.  Mobility Scooters are cool.  In fact, making that loop off-limits to cars makes it even more accessible for those folk.   I get the whole 'you don't like cars' and want as much nature to yourself as possible but that's not how public parks work.   I never said I don't like cars.

I don't consider myself all that great of an outdoorsman, and I can hike, with a load, on unimproved trails, from one end of the park to the other and back in about 3 hours.  Tops.

Buffalo,37d2n0,njkiser,3,Tue May 26 19:12:03 2015 UTC,"ITT People who think that 8-10 events a year in a Billion dollar facility will be a catalyst for something.  What are you going to do with other 355 days of the year?   Honestly look at Ford Field in Detroit, Lions fans are not happy with the end result of that move."
Buffalo,37d2n0,corp_goth,1 point,Wed May 27 23:44:49 2015 UTC,yep. I've given that some thought and bounced the idea around with some of my friends. If Pegula could pitch a stadium with the intentions of making it a public space like Canalside then I would be in it 100%.
Buffalo,37d2n0,justwanttolurk,2,Thu May 28 12:27:23 2015 UTC,"The Bills fan who looks forward to the tailgating more than the game itself from the cheap seats is going to get left behind with the new stadium.  It's just a reality.    If you want an owner who is willing to put his money where his mouth is when going after that all elusive Super Bowl win...you need to work with them.  A new downtown stadium is needed keep up the pace with other NFL teams.  We know Terry and Kim have the money but they are not a charity..no matter how much they give back to Buffalo.  NFL owners make a lot of money off ticket sales and luxury box sales.  Right now, the price point and prospective buyer is limiting in Orchard Park.  Move the stadium to downtown and it opens up so many more markets."
Buffalo,37d2n0,Sabres00,1 point,Wed May 27 15:02:16 2015 UTC,"This is true, and honestly everything changes with time, so those people need to grow up.  I remember as a kid I could take a cooler into Darien Lake, Lancaster Speedway, and Fantasy Island, now you can't do that shit, so you deal with it.  My dad used to tell me how they brought kegs and grills inside the Rockpile, so to him anything that we do now is tame.  If we can build something like they're building in Minnesota or have the possibility of a revitalized downtown, landing a few Superbowls, getting bigger musical acts, or a new convention center, I'll take that over having a reputation for being great tailgaters every day. Plus it's Buffalo, we'll find a way to pre-game."
Buffalo,37d2n0,justwanttolurk,1 point,Wed May 27 16:14:28 2015 UTC,Don't think a Super Bowl can come to Buffalo.  There are some pretty specific requirements on the number of hotel rooms and quality of rooms that Buffalo would not be able to meet.    A stadium like the one that was pitched for San Diego where there was 'exhibition' space attached would be a win/win for Buffalo.  Although I would like to see a dome or retractable roof and I think Pegula wants that as well.
Buffalo,37d2n0,Sabres00,2,Wed May 27 16:27:58 2015 UTC,I think between Canada/NF NY and Buffalo we're already in decent shape.  I think it could happen if downtown development keeps up they way it is going.  Jacksonville was a mess so the NFL wont let that happen again.  I'm sure once the stadium site and design are finalized there will be a whole bunch of developers ready to jump on the opportunity to add more hotels.
Buffalo,37d2n0,ooppoop,2,Wed May 27 20:12:06 2015 UTC,"But could a downtown stadium be a major addition to the cornerstone pieces that are popping up all over the city? It seems as if there is a new restaurant or brewery opening up every other week and they seem to be strategically placed throughout Buffalo. On the eastside of Buffalo, only a few blocks from First Niagara Center, is Larkin Square and the recently opened Hydraulic Hearth. A putt putt course is also in the plans for Larkin Squareand is slated to open for business on June 17th. Flip over to the westside and Resurgence Brewery is holding down Niagara Street and boasts a full house on any given weekend night with their tasty beer and indoor lawn games. And how could I not mention the Harborcenter? One of Mr. Pegula’s finest projects that continues to bring people to downtown Buffalo all year round. Like the pieces to a puzzle, these different establishments are beginning to tie Buffalo together. Could a downtown stadium be that one missing puzzle piece that always seems to get lost under the sofa, only to be found years later after the puzzle is long gone and forgotten?      Sure it's nice that resurgence opened on Niagara Street, except, people who know the area have been going to that section of Niagara for years & for better quality products than sweet ""beer""; such as santisero's food, & rich's deli meats.  Niagara didn't just come back on radar purely due to resurgence, maybe it did for nonlocal citizens. That would be like saying black Swan holds down allen, which we all know not to be true. There are other reasons people go to allen. A stadium could be the link between first ward & downtown. More interesting restaurants around it could be erected & spruced up residential blocks. However, it could also go sideways, after all, there is quite a bit of crude behavior associated with football games. Stadium downtown imo would be greatly beneficial."

Buffalo,379tcr,WNYADK,35,Tue May 26 01:11:29 2015 UTC,It is not expensive to live in Buffalo and the future is better now than it has been in years.  A lot of construction going on.
Buffalo,379tcr,bdiap,4,Tue May 26 01:23:33 2015 UTC,Agreed. I just bought a house and it is significantly cheaper than renting a comparable quality place by myself with a pitbull.
Buffalo,379tcr,Fgrira-Fpevoare,17,Tue May 26 04:42:22 2015 UTC,"You should make a decision solely based on what you want out of life. I'm sure your grandmother and mother want what's best for you, but honestly no one can truly judge what's best for you but you. Life's about more then job opportunities and optimal decisions, it's about happiness and fulfillment, if you love the climate, culture, experiences and have friends here and don't like it in Louisiana, then this is where you should be. Buffalo is probably not the Buffalo your relatives remember, a lot has changed in the past 5 years, especially the last two of those. Keep in mind that your mom and grandmother probably went through Buffalo's darkest hour, I mean imagine seeing half the city leave and thousands of jobs disappeared, how could you not become disillusioned when everything seemed so hopeless.  However, the economy and job market are picking up and the construction industry is booming, you should have very little trouble finding a welding job. Also, the city is more beautiful then it ever has been because the state, local, and federal governments have been dolling out millions to clean up pollution and recreate natural habitats lost from 150 years of destruction, the people are banning together to beautify the rough parts of the city, and most of the jobs that lead to grime, dirt, and dust being released into the city are gone. Buffalo is changing rapidly and it's almost too much too keep track of, I feel like you need to check it out for yourself in person. What I would suggest is to come up here for the summer like you want and while you are here you can look around a bit and familiarize yourself with the job market and see how comfortable you feel living here agin. Worst case scenario you can go back to Louisiana. Either way, we'd be happy to have you. Oh yeah also Buffalo is dirt cheap to live in."
Buffalo,379tcr,SuicydKing,19,Tue May 26 01:43:13 2015 UTC,"People who say it's too expensive to live in WNY have never lived anyplace else. The cost of living here is ridiculously low.   As far as how Buffalo is doing now, I'd say it's on the rise. The median income for a family of four is over $50,000 now, up from something like $36,000 a few years ago. There is new construction everywhere, the medical campus is bringing people here, and there's companies like Yahoo, Time Warner and Geico as well.   There have been a lot of development projects to improve the city as well, Harbor Center, Canalside, etc.   Now is a great time to live in Buffalo."
Buffalo,379tcr,justwanttolurk,4,Tue May 26 03:59:31 2015 UTC,It's the taxes and schools.  It's always been about the taxes and schools.
Buffalo,379tcr,SoBuffaloRes,4,Tue May 26 11:40:22 2015 UTC,The taxes in the CoB aren't even all that bad.
Buffalo,379tcr,justwanttolurk,4,Tue May 26 14:49:21 2015 UTC,"True.  But the schools in the COB are horrible.  In the parts of metro Buffalo, like Williamsville, where the schools are really good...the taxes are horrible.  You have to pick one or the other sadly.  It's not a dig.  WNY is an amazing place to live.  If they can figure out how to have good schools and lower taxes it would IMHO turn into one of the better cities in the US overnight."
Buffalo,379tcr,SoBuffaloRes,5,Tue May 26 15:02:41 2015 UTC,"Interesting note about schools in the CoB:  Any student can attend any of the schools in the district.  School choice.  There's no more ""I live in a bad area, so I must go to a bad school"" thing anymore.  So, it's just a matter of getting your kids into the better schools.  My tax bill is ~$800/yr, and both of my students attend City Honors, which is a nationally ranked school."
Buffalo,379tcr,justwanttolurk,1 point,Tue May 26 15:17:45 2015 UTC,CH is a fine school and a perfect example of what you get when you have an entrance exam.  I have been told there are several people with power working to open CH to all students and I am very curious as to what that will do to their national ranking in 5-10 years.  While you view 'any student can attend any of the schools' as a positive...to many it's a negative and that's why many have abandoned the BPS.  I am not sure you would be bragging about how low your taxes are if your kids were enrolled in Lafayette.  Many parents that I speak to don't want to chance their kids education and not every kid in Buffalo gets to go to City Honors but every kid who calls 14221 home is going to go to a Williamsville schools.  To each their own I guess.
Buffalo,379tcr,SoBuffaloRes,4,Tue May 26 18:13:41 2015 UTC,"There's no ""chance"" to a good education in BPS.  It boils down to a couple of factors:   Parental involvement.  Numerous times my students didn't get their #1 choice in school.  We called, harassed, hassled, and stopped in to central enrollment until our students got into their school. Even at Lafayette, a student can be successful.  Lafayette is a great example of what plagues our schools:  Underfunded programs that are key to our schools, such as ESL programs for immigrants; and poverty. Parental involvement again:  A student can be successful in any school, as long as the parents are pushing their student to perform well.  There are numerous examples of this in BPS, and nationally:  When the parents are pushing their students, the students succeed.   PS Some of those kids with a 14221 zip code are also going to CHS, Buffalo Gifted and Talented Program, and other top choice BPS schools, via loopholes (ie, buy a $1 lot, and use that as a mailing address, pay $100/yr in property taxes as proof of residency).  Then, follow the above steps."
Buffalo,379tcr,justwanttolurk,1 point,Tue May 26 23:39:55 2015 UTC,"Parental involvement is key.  No doubt about it.  That's one of the reasons the schools are so bad in Buffalo.    There are examples of good students in every school and there are examples of great schools in even the most underperforming districts.    That said, most parents don't like to gamble with their kids education.    Also, like I said before, while City Honors is a fine school that has kids from all over the region trying to attend...I am not sure how long that's going to last if they do away with the selected admission standards.    I wonder what the performance of a High School in the town of Amherst would be if it could draw only the best from Amherst, Sweet Home, Williamsville and Clarence.  My assumption is it would rank pretty darn well.  :/"

I have a number of friends who have moved back within the last year from places such as Richmond, New Orleans, and NYC.  It is definitely NOT expensive to live here. Especially if you are renting in the city. Property taxes out in the burbs are high, but the housing prices are still well below the national average.  There is a TON to do here, both professionally and socially. I agree with others that you definitely want to have a job lined up before moving, but that can be said for just about anywhere. And there are a lot of jobs opening up each month. Buffalo is booming, more so than it has in over a century. There are more job openings than people to hire.  I think it's definitely an option you should look into on your own."

What we're finding is that some of these companies are DYING for welders, or other tradesmen. No one goes into the trades anymore and their workforce is dying. If you come back as a welder, you will be making around $35-$50/hourly and on that salary, you would do very well living in Buffalo.

Buffalo,379tcr,FancyAndImportantMan,-1,Tue May 26 18:01:28 2015 UTC,"I've never seen a thread so full of bullshit about a town. If you have little friends with connections or money saved up it will be a bitch to live here.  Unless you have a specific degree in a specific field, expect to get paid shit. If you really want to come back don't do it without money.   All these hipsters moving back into white collar jobs have jacked the rent up. So if you have no credit - don't expect it to be easy to rent a place in this town.  Oh yeah since public transportation is limited (Hours and area) don't expect to get to work without a car unless you are working food service or downtown. Because more than likely you won't be leaving the city if you live in it.  If you do live and work in the city you better have a kickass resume, but even then it won't mean shit unless you know somebody.  If you feel like commuting to the burbs or live on the outskirts of the city you might be better off. There are plenty more jobs than in the city....... if you can call this a city.  Having spent a couple years down in New Orleans working I must say I made more money there than I ever did here.   Common buffalo misconceptions: Machine Operator = Means a machinist here not a equipment operator (We also call Skid-steers Bobcats here because we only call things by brands in this backwards town so know one knows wtf your saying if you use skid-steer or tractor).  Customer Service= Debt collections for shady companies that ask you to do sketchy and illegal shit. Most close after a couple years and open under new names.  Demolition: Means 100+ year old house rehabs and remodels not actually demolishing something.  Dishwashers/Servers/Cooks/ETC= Food service slaves where generally the cooks are either awesome or will shit on lesser employee's.  Delivery drivers= Stoners who make great money assuming they have their shit together enough to get their food to you on time. Most can't handle their shit.  Bartenders/Other Service industries= Unless your a female or can grow tits overnight it's not going to happen without knowing someone.  Temp agencies= SPS, Express, Key Resource Group= Taking your information to put on file and waste your time only to never call you back. If you go to a temp make sure it's a national agency at least.  Tellers=Well since tellers were replaced by hourly waged employee's even banks don't pay what they use to for entry level jobs.  Receptionist/Admin= Yet again unless you know someone don't expect to get this job unless your clueless with tits or flaming.  Manufacturing Jobs= Well there's Tyson which is great if you want to get paid 10 bucks to finger chicken all day, General Mills isn't a bad place to work if you can get in (If you know someone). GM/PowerTrain and Dunlop/Dupont are also great places to work if you know people and can piss clean. As most jobs in this category do 5 panel drug tests including hair testing.  If you do coke or are a drunk it's likely you'll fit right in with most of the douche bags who live here and get a job easier as you are now a part of the circle jerk.  Insurance for owning a vehicle in this state is ridiculous and if you don't have your ducks in a row(Your life is slightly fucked up) expect for people not to give a shit too much. Because the one's that do well here are blind to the ones who are struggling.  Oh yeah and if your homeless at one point, enjoy the 1-6 feet of snow depending on the year. There's no way to survive that if you have no car or home to sleep on and you fall on your face.  So all in all it's dependent on your support structure. If you know people it might be easier. If you don't know anyone or just don't have anything that makes you stand out...... stay south. They'll appreciate your hard work more, pay you better for it and you'll never deal with the frustration of competing with your parents and your friends parents for jobs.  Unless you like working 9-5 jobs for shit money forever. The alternatives are being a DR, Dentist, Lawyer, Engineer if lucky or a Union employee of some form. Local gov isn't a bad place for a job. But yet again...... enjoy sucking dick.   Non-profits = generally means........ they are for profit. Rarely do they give a crap about what their actually doing to help the people(Ex:Crisis Services)  So if your shit is together Buffalo can be a wonderful place to live.Just be glad you weren't born into poverty on the east side of Buffalo struggling to cling on to a normal life.  Because it's really fucking hard to do when you have no one catch you if you fall.  Best Of Luck - Grab a Po' Boy for me.  PS wtf is with you people talking up this town? Seriously, is it because you've never seen the otherside? Which I could actually understand if it's pure ignorance. But otherwise it's a load of shit for some people who don't have a silver spoon to choke on. Consider other people might not live like you."
Buffalo,37aqha,btm1547,3,Tue May 26 06:09:39 2015 UTC,There are a few sources you can use online like Cardkingdom or Abugames.  If you're looking to sell them in person the only place I have ever played locally is Collector's Inn.  I can't tell you if that's a good place or not to sell your cards but I can say that is in fact a location you can do Magic related things.  I just realized how useless I was.

I think there's still a Wednesday night thing at the Merriweather library. There's also a night or two at Spot on Chipewa where people play.

Buffalo,375j27,ToxicKnight6,2,Mon May 25 01:41:54 2015 UTC,I think the big issue here is this sub isn't big or active enough for us to worry about a more esoteric version of itself.

Buffalo,374wjc,dima1720,2,Mon May 25 14:27:17 2015 UTC,"My point was it's a bad time to be a renter pretty much anywhere. Demand is outstripping supply in most places. While Buffalo has a lot of housing supply, quality housing in areas people want to live is where the demand is.   Amherst has historically been opposed to most apartment development. That's changed in the last 10 years or so, with most development being student or senior apartments. Hardwood floors were the dominant flooring choice 50+ years ago, and there was nothing in that area 50 years ago but farms.   I wouldn't install anything but carpet in one of my units because renters are hard on pretty much everything, but especially floors. If the unit has hardwoods aleady, cool. If not, i'm not going to the expense to install something that will inevitably be trashed."

Buffalo,372496,RocketPoweredTofacos,4,Sun May 24 03:46:01 2015 UTC,"Best thing you can do is go to a resort when they open. Rent & take a couple lessons. Either you're going to enjoy it or you're not, not really much you can do to prepare for it; you're gonna fall the first day you learn.  Snowboarding is mostly about transitioning your hips & balance, while skiing is mostly knees over toes & balance.  Between the two, it's really about how long you can stand (endurance of legs) in a protected half squat position.     If you enjoy it after all the falling & lessons, go to holiday Valley on demo day.  Try out different gear, rent boots from hv, talk to reps about gear, generally you'll want something that does well in ice or all mountain gear.      Then based on your trials & research of  product reviews, buy gear to last you forever"

Buffalo,36xujl,Cananopie,2,Sat May 23 01:22:05 2015 UTC,"Normally what happens is there are volunteers blocking traffic while runners pass by, but they let traffic cross the intersections when there aren't any runners coming up.  Best bet is to try to avoid the intersections and course for the morning, both the marathon and half marathon sold out this year."

Buffalo,36w3ew,Yellowed,1 point,Fri May 22 18:02:55 2015 UTC,"Ha, regardless, serving booze at a fifteen theater multiplex where you have to have cops on hand to deal with fights on Christmas Day isn't the ideal situation. Places like Alamo Drafthouse have only a few screens at most. If you have a license to serve food and fit all the criteria that a restaurant or bar would have to meet, there's no reason that you could not get a license. Screening Room has alcohol and shows movies, Shea's has alcohol and shows movies, Riviera does it, and North Park has had catering serve beer and wine a few times.   As I said, it's just logistically a giant clusterfuck to monitor everyone in a dark room, especially if yo have twenty of those rooms."

Buffalo,36ocxk,oliver-hart,1 point,Thu May 21 11:28:41 2015 UTC,"There's actually another cave you can see from the top of these falls too, it's just all clogged up with logs and debris"
Buffalo,36ocxk,soontobeghosttowns,1 point,Thu May 21 12:11:07 2015 UTC,"I've actually gone in about a quarter mile before, after you enter the first chamber you can go further, lots of squeezing and going through water up to your chest though. one time it started pouring outside and flooded the cave while we were in it, scared the shit out of me."
Buffalo,36ocxk,NotRoryWilliams,2,Thu May 21 13:26:04 2015 UTC,"Whoa! And we are definitely talking about the same space behind the upper falls? It's been years since I've been back; I can't remember access past the first chamber.  I always thought that any decent-sized ""caves"" people talked about near Akron were just the former gypsum mines near the airport."
Buffalo,36ocxk,WJIngalls,1 point,Thu May 21 13:42:58 2015 UTC,"How is this the second? Is there another one upstream that I don't know about? Or do you and I just use different terms for the order of waterfalls? To me it's quite clear that the first fall is the one upstream, e.g. The first one that the water (or a boater if the water were high enough, which doesn't happen often) goes over is obviously the first... but I could be completely mistaken.   I know there's one downstream of this, which is a bit taller but lacks the really cool cave access."

Buffalo,36mxv2,ReverendBass,-1,Wed May 20 21:10:32 2015 UTC,I didn't think this was going to be any good but I recently tried their IPA and was pleasantly surprised. Look forward to checking this spot out and trying more brews! I love beer.
Buffalo,36mxv2,thegangler,4,Wed May 20 20:32:06 2015 UTC,didn't think this was going to be any good   Why not?  What led you to such disbelief initially?     Their beer is far better quality than resurgence.
Buffalo,36mxv2,seven1six,1 point,Wed May 20 21:11:33 2015 UTC,"This - Resurgence is not about the beer, BD clearly is."
Buffalo,36mxv2,ReverendBass,1 point,Wed May 20 21:29:14 2015 UTC,"Either way, both are awesome places (BD looks awesome), and the only downside to Resurgence is that it is busy all the time, and when you go in there on a weekend its packed, which is a good thing for the west side and for breweries alike"
Buffalo,36mxv2,Common_loon,1 point,Thu May 21 01:29:33 2015 UTC,No. Their beer mostly sucks. That's a big problem. The ambience is all that place has. But that's just my beer drinkin' opinion
Buffalo,36mxv2,ReverendBass,3,Thu May 21 04:11:12 2015 UTC,I fucking hate Resurgence Beer. Cool spot shit beer. I live a stones throw away and wont go anymore unless it improves.
Buffalo,36mxv2,TOMALTACH,4,Thu May 21 14:18:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is a cool spot and the ambience is great. Their mistake, and this is just my opinion, was brewing some-dozen different beers instead of focusing on making three or four spectacular ones. Their IPA, I swear that stuff smells like urine. The sponge candy is gross. I tried one that I thought was ok, but I can't remember what it was--I think it was the ""smoky"" one. But even that was meh ok."
Buffalo,36mxv2,ReverendBass,2,Thu May 21 20:03:59 2015 UTC,"Yea. It seems only people who rave about their beer are those who like sweet flavors in their beer.  I like hints of the flavoring not full on near replication.  That stout is horrible.  Best girlie beer I can think of that is very good it's pete's wicked ales strawberry blonde; when drinking it it has a subtle sweet taste but an excellent ale & at the end of the gulp there's a hint of strawberry - reminds me of ""strawberry cough"" that marijuana that Michael Cain bred in the movie ""children of men"".     The loganberry wit is by no means a great beer but a great idea & fairly good attempt and probably the only beer they made an effort to try. The blood orange saison isn't bad either. But like you said they should have focused on a couple clutch beers. It seems like they rushed to open, to be the first new brewery.  Plus they didn't have a solid brew master until just shortly before they opened.      Big ditch had the correct business plan. I think they're gonna be my new local spot downtown."
Buffalo,36mxv2,ReverendBass,-2,Sun May 24 20:50:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's the name. It left me with this Budweiser kind of feeling and even the marketing sort of makes me think of cheap, ol' pilsners. That and the fact that so many new breweries are popping up, they ALL can't be good. Odds are many won't make it.   But then again Pearl St still brews crap beer.   I was really disappointed with Resurgence, too"
Buffalo,36mxv2,Mjap52,2,Thu May 21 04:09:23 2015 UTC,"really? big ditch, in reference to the erie canal?  to the region...    it's more than just some family name, or a street. and better than a angry goat/bison logo and name of ""revival"" along with sweet ""neer-beer"""
Buffalo,36mxv2,Sabres00,1 point,Thu May 21 13:54:49 2015 UTC,"I didn't get the reference and am not aware of the historical background it has. But it really doesn't matter, right? The beer I tried was refreshing and delicious. I liked it a lot and want to spend a day over there drinking beer!"
Buffalo,36mxv2,RVAGOD,1 point,Thu May 21 20:05:00 2015 UTC,"Have you tried Pearl Street's beer recently? It's improved a lot over the past few months. Sabres Edge is about 10x better than it was in early 2014.   They hired a new brewer, I think around the end of summer."

Buffalo,36mxv2,RVAGOD,-5,Fri May 22 15:20:06 2015 UTC,"Disappointed to see silverware on every table, looks more like just another restaurant than a kick ass brewery. Brewery's should be about the beer not the food, I guess we can hold out some hope for the beer hall they have planned?"
Buffalo,36mxv2,RVAGOD,6,Thu May 21 12:58:52 2015 UTC,"WHat????     so great lakes brewing company isn't an awesome brewery to you? fat heads? the church? goose island? omegang? rhorbach's? Southern Tier? Pyramid? Lake Placid? Long Trail?   there are plenty of awesome breweries that also have decent, good and excellent food restaurants.        BD beer IS about the beer. they made certain to have a viable product ready for mass production before opening to the public. I'd rather go to a brewery which has good beer to start from the opening than one that will work on improving their recipe from the day of opening. resurgence beer is sweet, flat, watery, and hasn't improved since their opening; they say their always tweaking it, but i have yet to meet a beer fan who thinks it's by any means good, or even worth the cost."
Buffalo,36mxv2,RVAGOD,0,Thu May 21 13:51:37 2015 UTC,"Thank You!  I thought I was the only one who thought resurgence was ""not all that."""
Buffalo,36mxv2,Sabres00,-2,Sun May 24 20:45:21 2015 UTC,"Obviously beer quality is at the top of a breweries priority, but I enjoy a brewery that is laid back and all about drinking and having fun. I don't want to be seated at a table, waited on then feel pressure to leave after the meal. I can have that experience at a restaurant and still drink Big Ditch Beer."
Buffalo,36mxv2,RVAGOD,2,Thu May 21 14:19:17 2015 UTC,"I don't want to be seated at a table, waited on then feel pressure to leave after the meal.   i dont know what brewery you're at where they're doing this. pretty sure any brewery wants you to drink and enjoy yourself without feeling like you need to come in then leave. hell, this doesn't even happen at bars. honestly you could hang out and drink water all day without feeling this in a brewery or a bar."
Buffalo,36mxv2,716in619,-2,Thu May 21 14:25:22 2015 UTC,If they are busy and people are waiting for a table this will happen. Are you affiliated with Big Ditch? You seem very defensive to any negative criticism of the post?

Buffalo,36n0nu,qrush,6,Thu May 21 23:16:26 2015 UTC,"For Buffalo, you don't necessarily need to look in a big apartment building to find a great apartment.  Buffalo is full of gigantic homes that are split into smaller apartments. So each home may have anywhere from 2 to 4 apartments with like 2 beds, 1-2 baths, and a porch each.  There are some tech companies in Buffalo that may also be interested in graphic design work - not just agencies.  For my shopping, I get my meats and some items from a Wegmans. For other produce that is really cheap I just head to the Price Right next to my apartment.  To meet people, you can live in an area with bars. In downtown you have the Allentown, Elmwood, Hertal areas. That's where I would look if I were you."

Buffalo,36n0nu,Vocal_Minority,1 point,Wed May 20 22:43:37 2015 UTC,"Allentown is Buffalo's take on Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Allen street is loaded with old brick buildings and is extremely narrow. Almost like what you would imagine an alley in a big city. That's where all the bars,resturants and live music is at. They area immediately around that is full of old Victorian and Colonial style historic homes that are painted bright vibrant colors. Like Allenstreet, the area around here is a very tight and close pocketed neighborhood. Traditionally it was where all the artists and weirdos lived, now it's more full of the young professional yuppie type. Either way, it's still a cool place to visit. The intersection of Elmwood Avenue and Allen Street serves as the center or nucleus of Allentown."

Buffalo,36n0nu,Vocal_Minority,0,Sat May 23 22:13:20 2015 UTC,I guess they don't teach you how to search a sub or read a sidebar in graphic design school.
Buffalo,36n0nu,LeJourLeFroid,8,Wed May 20 18:22:16 2015 UTC,I am so tired of every question asked in this sub being met with this same answer. It is not so busy that we need to attack people for asking basic questions.
Buffalo,36n0nu,Vocal_Minority,5,Thu May 21 03:28:07 2015 UTC,"he has a valid point. afterall, asking the same question over and over when good ""behavior"" involves doing the research yourself first, then when very specific questions you have need answers, then ask those questions. not bland questions that are found in the sidebar's #1 Frequently Asked Question: Moving to WNY (it dumps all the threads about moving to buffalo)   not looking around first is makes about as much sense as graduate students expecting their instructors to tell them how they should do something right."
Buffalo,36n0nu,LeJourLeFroid,1 point,Thu May 21 13:48:18 2015 UTC,"I agree to an extent.   The reason I have an issue with the canned response of ""see the FAQ"" is that the city is dynamic. Having the same conversation occasionally serves to bring new ideas from new people who may not have added to the conversation. A new person would also not know if the faq is updated.   Additionally, the FAQ is not, to my knowledge, not generated by the subreddit. Instead it is written by the moderators so there is a chance for bias.   Also, the canned response is pretty cold and discourages discussion. The person may have already checked the FAQ but thought their situation was unique or did not apply. Maybe it does apply but they do not realize it does.  I think the FAQ is great and the mods do a fantastic job. There is a wide and deep amount of information there but there are situations where just telling someone to check the FAQ is pretty much saying fuck off."
Buffalo,36n0nu,whirlpool138,1 point,Thu May 21 23:48:46 2015 UTC,"tells people to fuck off      What? Really? How do you at all gather that? Did you read my original comment? You just reiterated that if someone reads the faq & hasn't had their concerns answered, then they may want something answered, so instead of posting ""moving to buffalo"" & asking a generic question that is repeatedly answered in a broad way, the users ought to asking very specific questions. Not, something as basic as ""where to look for apartments""     People can also find threads that discuss where to meet people or where to eat with basic keyword searches.     Also. Only some of the wiki might be biased by one moderator, for example the neighborhoods grading page.  But generally most wiki pages seem to link to archived discussions regarding a subject such as great places to go hike.     Telling someone to seek out information that exists does not in any way say fuck off.  You should see other subreddits for cities if you feel this is true about buffalo, many other cities will quite literally tell you to take a hike without attempting to direct you to any information."
Buffalo,36n0nu,flancresty,1 point,Sun May 24 23:07:48 2015 UTC,"Not every comment saying something along the lines of ""go check the FAQ"" is telling someone to fuck off. There is a polite way to tell someone where to find the best source of information. In this particular circumstance though, what u/flancresty wrote was rude, condescending, and uncalled for. From my perspective, it was a pretty clear fuck off. The amount of comments agreeing with me is pretty indicative.   Btw, I had no idea we could add to the FAQ so easily. Thanks for the heads up. Have a good mdw."
Buffalo,36n0nu,TOMALTACH,1 point,Mon May 25 00:22:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe flancestry is having a rough day. They did say it a bit snottily. But you'll find that quite often comments will include a suggestion or two and redirection to the #1 question search. Moving to buffalo is a big thing but should the sub be flooded, with common questions that lack very specific detail to their questions?   Sometimes you'll see two broad exact same questions within hours of each other being posted, why can't someone just tag on in a thread, ""I'm looking or interested of this also, suggestions appreciated!""  so they may have to check back instead of seeing their 'inbox' blow up with direct answers.   (actually would be nice if people could subscribe to threads so that they could see the replies also, for this reason) edit: there is, if they have the Reddit RES app, they can click on subscribe to the thread, they can also receive the replies that the OP see in their inbox.  There's a difference between ""I'm moving to buffalo, where should I live / look""  &  ""I'm moving to buffalo, neighborhood a & b seem most along like what I might like, tell me more about these areas, can I walk to spot a & spot b? Are there parks close by?"" Etc etc.     if flancestry or anyone wanted to be truly unhelpful they could suggest unpleasant areas to live or pleasant areas that are 45min drive...     At least most recent person said they're looking between NF & lancaster.  Which is better than where in the entire metro region...      Point is good redditique ought to be exercised prior to asking a question & questions ought to be relatively specific to what they're looking for. Not, where's good to eat? Etc.     People get chewed out in other subs for not doing research first.     Cheers"
Buffalo,36n0nu,flancresty,-1,Mon May 25 02:40:51 2015 UTC,"The information barely covers everything going on in Buffalo, especially for someone considering a move to here. It's aimed more at day visitors stopping by for a short time period."

I know this isnt sustainable, and they will plateau, but i cant see them going down unless something epic bad happens to the area.  my main concern is that the houses rising values, are making the rents rise as well, and is pushing the fun people that make this area awesome, out to the hertel/north buffalo area.

Only marathon I've finished was the one in Rochester and the miles and miles of solitary thought on the canal are scenic but boring.
Buffalo,36d71e,FancyAndImportantMan,1 point,Mon May 18 20:57:52 2015 UTC,I preferred running along the canal. I am worried that the course may be hard to follow during the second half when most of the crowds are gone.

Buffalo,36erfu,thescottishplayyy,3,Tue May 19 01:44:19 2015 UTC,"Head to Main Street and hit up all the bars. Kelly's is great for the atmosphere and people watching. Their drinks are strong and get the job done (I don't recommend getting a Tom Collins here though, tastes like it could be Pine Sol). The Idle has a nice beer selection, but order a Dirty Water or a margarita pitcher. The Vital is also good for beer, honestly the mixed drinks are the best here imo."

Buffalo,36btwa,frank_abernathy,6,Mon May 18 03:03:23 2015 UTC,"When I moved to Buffalo I went to Blue Mountain Coffee and just by a  one sentence description they were able to give me the right filters for my coffee maker. Granted, this isn't that hard but it was over 30 years old and he knew what i needed before I even finished the sentence! Their coffees are great and they do a beautiful gift basket that makes a great present for someone too!"
Buffalo,36btwa,Terrible_Toaster,7,Mon May 18 04:30:27 2015 UTC,I would 2nd Blue Mtn Coffee. If your out in Amherst Premier Gourmet has a ton of kitchen accessories and I have to imagine there is a good selection of coffee related stuff.

Buffalo,36btwa,rbroni88,2,Mon May 18 03:17:23 2015 UTC,"Premier Gourmet on Maple has all the things you're looking for - in addition they have probably 2 dozen whole bean coffees for sale.  Not sure if it fits the knowledgeable & well-priced criteria, but they'll have what you're after."
Buffalo,36btwa,drabbb,2,Mon May 18 13:44:15 2015 UTC,"If you're just looking for equipment, you're probably not going to find competitive prices locally - much better off ordering from Amazon.  If you're not sure what you need, and want some direction, I'd recommend stopping by Public Espresso at the Lafayette when Clinton is working. They have all sorts of equipment there (pour-over, aeropress, french presses, chemex, etc.) and he's incredibly friendly. You could probably have him brew bean with the different methods, to get an idea of what you prefer.  My recommendation would be to pick up an electric burr grinder, aeropress, digital water heater, and pocket scale. That's about the simplest setup to get started with making a consistent brew. Here's what I personally recommend:  Burr grinder  Aeropress  Gooseneck water kettle - Go for the gooseneck if you will eventually be making pour-over coffee with a Hario or Chemex.   Pocket Scale"

Oh.. my... word... plus sumptuous house-made tiramisu that easily ranks among the best in Buffalo.  Kalypso -- Some of the most tender chicken in the entire city and a kickass jerk sauce.  (For my money, best plantains in the city, too.)  Taki's (on Court Street) -- Best simple breakfast foods.  Phenomenally efficient service.  JJ's Cafe (Kenmore Avenue) -- Best super cheap greasefire caliber breakfast food.  Also a real quack of an owner who will charge you ""Eleventy million dollars"" for a breakfast sandwich and refund your Andrew Jackson ""Fifty jillion rubles.""  Heh.  No other place like this.  Oliver's -- Because everyone seems to forget that this place has some of the best food in Buffalo at prices far lower than Archer, let alone Chop House, or Rue Franklin, or Tempo.  Go for lunch and try the steak sandwich or the burger and be alone away by the difference between there and anywhere else.  Go for dinner and be sure to order the pork belly.

Buffalo,367gdv,buffalo442,2,Sun May 17 14:14:59 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you mentioned Balkan dining. I have the craziest story about how I met the owner.   Edit: I didn't have time to write this out on mobile earlier, so I'll go now.   Summer of 2014 I was going on a road trip with my sister to Florida. I was in buffalo and needed to meet her in DC. I decided to fly from buffalo, but my flight required me to have a layover in Atlanta, which was crazily out of my way. As I went to stand in line for security, i had to get through all the rope divider things, and since there wasn't a line yet, I just unhooked it and walked through, but a small crowd followed me. I let them through behind me and they all proceeded to cut me in line. I was okay about this, but one guy stopped and said thank you.  He was friendly so we started talking and he asked where I was going. I said DC and he said Virginia. He was heading there to propose to his girlfriend.  Turns out his girlfriend and he knew each other as kids (their fathers were good friends). However the conflict in the Balkans caused them to flee to the states and they lost touch. His father has since passed. While he was on a trip to Istanbul years and years later, he ran into his childhood friend and they reconnected. At this point he was heading to go propose. Anyways, we hung out in the buffalo gate for a bit and went on our planes.   In Atlanta (for those who have been know what I'm talking about) there are these trams  that you can take between terminals. I'm waiting in mine, and Lo and behold he shows up. Turns out he was detoured through Atlanta too. We talked for a bit I wished him good luck again and he went on his way.  I guess the better story is about his (hopefully wife) girlfriend and him reconnecting. But I still thought it was nuts that we were both getting re routed through Atlanta for a fairly short trip to the DC area."

There were also a lot of slumlord apartments around there. There was a big Somali presence on the block, and I think they were all related. They were all nice and kept mostly to themselves.   Connecticut was fine if you acted like you belonged there. I used to wait for the bus on Connecticut all the time at night and never had a problem. I'm pretty used to the lower West side, though. I went to school around there.   I did occasionally find used needles around my yard in the mornings.   Overall, not a terrible place to live if you're young, but I moved out when I had to raise a family."

And, yes, in NYS we hammer people's balls to the wall when they get into arrears.  The city isn't charging a dime to go to the outer harbor.  The private corporation managing the outer harbor will be charging $5 to park in the lot(s) closest to the marina.  A private corporation based in Tennessee, no less.

I've been fortunate to travel all around the world, and I love this place and the people here and really don't want to go anywhere else.  I love that first day of spring, when the leaves first bud.  I love the comraderie of strangers just for sharing a common bond.  I love the parks.  The art and music scene here is amazing for a small town.  My favorite part is that it's like a sketch board, where you can do pretty much anything you want because of the low costs.  I love waking up on Sunday mornings to drink dollar mimosas and watch the Bills.  I love my neighborhood, where the racial boundaries are broken down and I live around people from ethnicities around the world trying to make our place the great city it once was.  I love that Elon Musk is moving operations here and Terry Pegula is building us a real downtown.  I love all that because it means that people truly believe in this place and it isn't just a bunch of broke hipsters touting where they were forced to.  Sounds to me like you are taking all of the anger from your life's shortcomings and projecting it as negativity towards the town.  That's not helping change things here.  In fact, what all of the old racist assholes who had brought this city down for a while did and nothing ever got done.  And you're not being a dick, this place isn't for everyone, but you are being a miserable, wet towel and that's the attitude that will bring down yourself and anywhere around you."

While I totally understand and appreciate your optimism and the fact you are willing to stand up for your city, you just proved my point exactly. You are accustomed to this place. You think it's great. And, that no improvement is needed... I simply disagree. And I'm bringing you an outside perspective. And for the record, you know nothing of my ""shortcomings"". That is just an attempt at ad hominem to make your point. There is no need to get personal here.  But hey, prove me wrong... That's exactly what I want and am asking for. Prove me wrong, Buffalo.

Okay... Well, NYC and Long Island are still NY state. (i.e. Similar taxes, same laws, etc.) Vermont has one of the highest costs of living in the country. (So, of course this seems low cost to him/her). And, Philly has one of the highest crime rates in the country, if not the highest.   And, arguably, any and every city needs ""improvement"". I have lived in all regions of the U.S. except the far west (CO was as far as I went). You will never understand that the grass can be greener, if you have never seen greener grass, so to speak, ya know? I feel I have seen much greener grass on the other side of the fence... Far greener, actually. I'm doing my part for this city. I just want to encourage others to, instead of just demonstrating complacency and unfounded-pride.   P.S. I come from a family that has experienced extreme poverty, as well as, a decent amount of wealth and accommodation. I have seen both sides of this coin."

I wanted to move to Denver, or Portland/Seattle, or SF for a long time with the idea that these places have the things I want, until I realized that instead of just paying a lot to buy into some else's ideas, I could work to create what I want here. And being a childless mid-twenties dude with a pretty good job that I work easy hours at, I have more than enough time and resources to do that.  I just don't think you and I value the same things and probably wouldn't have much to talk about in real life because we live different lifestyles and that's fine. I hope the place I love and work to improve gets to be somewhere that you will be able to raise a great daughter and also love."

Buffalo,35ziz9,FancyAndImportantMan,2,Fri May 15 02:56:38 2015 UTC,"North buff is no less of a city life experience than Elmwood is.   You're but a skip away from Delaware park, there's a butt load of small shops restaurants, bars, pizzerias, bakeries, several cafes and so on. Beyond that of you want to go to a chain restaurant store you are also near all that stuff on Delaware.    Some things to think about  1.elmwood isn't nyc. I think the elitist ""urban"" crowd from Elmwood and Allen need to cool your tits about your super urban lifestyle. The two flat house may be a little cookie cutter, but be that as it may the houses are all split into two apartments and really close together. It's not like the Elmwood village isn't mostly houses anyway. Your Elmwood house probably has more land too. Buffalo resembles Staten Island more than it resembles Manhattan or hell even the Bronx.    I feel like the main hertel drag is more of a real city street than Elmwood is. You want to talk urban living? How many butcher shops are in the Elmwood village? How many local groceries? Ethnic grocers? In terms of actual livable amenities within walking distance and not just trendy restaurants and bars hertel seems to win out when you consider it's a main strip is a mile shorter. So yeah there are less juice bars on hertel but I'd rather have a place to get some steaks.    3.This is a dumb pissing contest to have. Both neighborhoods are nice and have their pluses and minuses and the whole city comes to life when the trees finally start to bloom."

I can't tell you how many times I've almost rear ended people who decide to pull to a complete stop at the last second, or gotten stuck behind people going 10 mph down Delaware/Elmwood, or sat forever at the never ending stop lights there and on Hertel. This isn't a one-time thing. This is based on several years of going to college and working in that area.  Elmwood may not be perfect but you're greatly exaggerating the noise and drunks. There are many young families who live there and love it. Does Hertel have a noise ordinance and all the bars close at 11? I thought not. And in Elmwood, there's plenty of side streets that are easy to get through to avoid the main drags of Delaware and Elmwood (which are still far less clogged then their northern counterparts. At least there you can cross the street safely.  Among other things that have soured me on N.

I don't think many people are talking about the Plazas on Delaware when they are talking about living in North Buffalo, but the North-South streets that intersect Hertel. Never a problem finding parking there, Hertel does not suffer the traffic problems Elmwood does.  How many cities have you even lived in to judge what is an ""authentic"" city experience? You're calling me a snob when your comment is the one that shit on another neighborhood, calling it inauthentic and inferior? Pot, kettle, etc."

Buffalo,35trp5,jmg2303,11,Wed May 13 13:14:16 2015 UTC,"Sensible, but all this amounts to is an expanded intermodal yard to stage import and export cans moving primarily on the rails of NS and CSX. Sure, there will be some increased regional pull for drayage carriers to start pulling and dropping in Buffalo instead of other locations, but this designation probably won't mean what most people think when they hear ""inland port"".   Now if somebody could approach the Lake Carrier Association, Great Lakes Towing, Moran, McAllister or Bouchard to start a Lakes-based short-sea operation with Buffalo as a transshipment hub, we'd be talking real port operations."

Buffalo,35tthd,pete716,2,Thu May 14 20:53:32 2015 UTC,I signed up for a free trial membership to check out the gym a few weekends ago when I was in town and the dude at the desk was definitely pretty weird. He was kind of standoffish in person but then called me the next week to make sure I had a great experience. I really liked the weight room on the top floor and if there isn't a ton of traffic and parking isn't hard this is probably the spot for me. This and the Burt Flickinger Center are the only ones that are pretty close to my apartment and the BFC has horrible hours.
Buffalo,35tthd,whirlpool138,2,Thu May 14 21:38:47 2015 UTC,"Don't hesitate to sign up. The dudes that own/operate it are total bros, but they mean well. Occasionally you will have to wait your turn for a bench press (rarely) and you may have to budget 15mins to wait for a lane in the pool (again, rarely) but that's about it. The location is convenient, and it has everything you need. Jesus does their shower soap ever suck though. I don't even think you can call it soap."

Buffalo,35pat2,CleanBaldy,2,Thu May 14 16:31:16 2015 UTC,"It's pretty awesome.  In summer, it goes 45 miles first on electric before having to worry about using gas.    In our Buffalo winters, it goes about 20, because the cold affects the batteries.  Overall, Buffalo is a great city to own the car, if you're within 15 miles of work.   My MPG over the last two years is 140 MPG.   21,000 miles so far.   Only one long trip of 1,000 miles, which took my MPG way down, since that was all gas.    Heck, that 1,000 mile trip used 1/3 of my TOTAL gas usage!    If I never took that trip, my lifetime MPG would probably be 200+ MPG.  It's got great pick up and in two years, I haven't had any issues with the car.   In winter, I toss dedicated snow tires on, but that's just my preference.   I prefer staying safe :)  There's a lot more I could say.   I'll leave it at that.  Toss me questions if you'd like.   It's a really awesome car..."
Buffalo,35pat2,whirlpool138,2,Thu May 14 17:26:00 2015 UTC,"That actually sounds great, 20 miles on a battery charge is just enough to get pretty much anywhere in Western New York. Did you buy it at a local dealer or outside of the area?"
Buffalo,35pat2,CleanBaldy,2,Thu May 14 17:40:50 2015 UTC,"I'm actually leasing it, since the 2016 volt comes out this year (I actually planned this two years ago).   Battery distance will be even better, from 37 miles (even though it gets 45 in nice weather) to 50 miles for the 2016.   I hope that means 60+ miles in nice weather and ~30 in cold!  I leased it two years ago when they were new.  Fully loaded, so it's $350/mo.  With barely any gas costs, it's saving me a fortune.  I had traded in a BMW which needed premium and sucked down gas at 16 MPG...   so, I'm honestly saving over $500 going from that to the Volt.   When my lease is up, I plan on trading up to the 2016 Volt next July.    Unless, of course, it's horrible in some way.   It's not quite out yet for me to take a look at it...  I got it at Basil Chevrolet.  I knew a guy... I'm sure you can get them at any local Chevy dealer.  They all can grab stock from anywhere...   just remember that.   My car was shipped from somewhere else...  When I leased mine, I could have gotten less options for $299/mo.  I think it was only $2k down.  That was reasonable for me, since it's a $45,000 MSRP on the sticker."

One kid died from ODing on it while I was going to school there (at least three years ago now) and since then local media and assorted stupid people have blown heroin at Lancaster High wayyy out of proportion.    The vast majority of students don't do it.  I never once met a kid who did it.  Like any suburban high school, there is a very small group of students who do it. Uniformed people now occasionally call Lancaster High ""Heroin High"" which is incorrect, as Frontier High has claimed the title of ""Heroin High"" for years.   EDIT:  Can't speak for the Town/Village of Lancaster as a whole, but I believe while there are people who use it, it's a very tiny percentage of the population.

Buffalo,35qpf2,braune13,1 point,Tue May 12 20:58:57 2015 UTC,"And the only reason Frontier has that rep is because the administration's policy at the school, for better or worse, is to let law enforcement handle it rather than sweeping it under the rug.

Sure there are worse places and lord knows I've gotten around, but tolerant is a better word than friendly. Not enough bike lanes, drivers don't give a fuck about cyclists anywhere, and then there are those  months where cycling is a non option for most people.   Only way to really deal with it is wear safety equipment and bike carefully. Take into account that you cant trust people around you."

Buffalo,35r0st,LeJourLeFroid,5,Tue May 12 20:29:28 2015 UTC,"It goes both ways. Today I was driving up W. Ferry with a cyclist riding with traffic but also where cars were parked. I was making an effort to be fast enough to not hold up traffic but slow enough not to turn him into a human pancake. He thanked me by blowing 2 stop signs and almost cutting me off at Norwood.  Also, Elmwood is not the most bike friendly street. It simply receives too much traffic for it to be so. There are bike lanes on Richmond and Linwood, a bit out of the way but will be far safer for you in your travels through that area."

I pretty much stick to side streets or Richmond/Linwood"
Buffalo,35r0st,Sabres00,4,Tue May 12 21:57:26 2015 UTC,"I think that it isn't so much that Buffalo is not bike friendly, I think that a lot of drivers are just fed up with the way that SOME bicyclists treat the laws. I can't tell you how many times I have almost hit  cyclists who were running stop lights , stop signs,  not folding into the other traffic on circles, and disobeying other traffic laws. It happens on a daily basis especially in the summer.   I find that when I am on a bike I am respected. But, I am always on super high alert. You should always be aware that you are on a vehicle that will always lose the battle of bike vs. car. That being said, I do agree that there is a lack of bike specific amenities here in downtown, & I hope that they are going to improve this as time goes on."

Buffalo,35r0st,SoBuffaloRes,3,Wed May 20 14:05:20 2015 UTC,"For fifteen years, I drove a delivery truck.  I used to spend 8 hours a day driving around Western New York, and there were drivers who couldn't even see a truck, much less a bicycle.  I've seen drivers do all sorts of stupid and dangerous things.  I've also seen a lot of bicyclists and pedestrians do stupid and dangerous things."
Buffalo,35r0st,Metal-Dog,2,Wed May 13 04:52:22 2015 UTC,"During warmer months, and even during some random colder days I bike just about everywhere I go, every day in the city.   Biking here shouldn't be scary. Sure there are crappy drivers and people that don't pay attention, but you should always assume any car doesn't see you. I stick to Ashland/Norwood/Linwood when going North and South. Less traffic so they feel way safer. For ever ride with a close call, I probably have 50 rides without any issues with drivers. And I find I encounter shitty drivers in my car too, probably just as often as on bike. I just feel more protected in the metal box with wheels.   Elmwood is fun to cruise down and people watch but you definitely want to be 100% alert and aware at all times. It's a really busy road.   I rode a motorcycle for a while in my early 20's and it was similar to bicycling in that some people just don't see you or respect you on the road. Play it safe at all times when dealing with traffic.   I was hit by a car once on a rainy night but I just think it was bad luck.   I think Buffalo is very bike friendly and tons of other people get around by bike. You just gotta be smart about it and you'll be fine.  Maybe join a group ride like the campus wheel works or slow roll rides to meet other cyclists and get a better feel for being on the Buffalo city streets."
Buffalo,35r0st,LowItalian,2,Tue May 12 23:23:30 2015 UTC,"I have recently started biking as my main mode of transportation and frequently bike Elmwood and Downtown. I will say I have had way more problems with pedestrians than motorists. People jumping out from in between cars to cross the street with out looking is a constant problem. The stretch by Buff State that has the two way bike lane in always clogged with inconsiderate pedestrians. I only ride on sidewalks when I absolutely have to.   That being said, when dealing with motorists you have to err on the side of caution. Like the other redditor commented on here, you have to assume no one sees you. I also try not to pick up too much speed. Even though it feels great to zoom down a hill, I keep my speed reasonable because I know the limits of my brakes and how long it takes me to decelerate to a complete stop and If I have to stop suddenly I would like to be able to do so.  Understand what roads your taking and what type of traffic you will encounter. I avoid Niagara St. for this reason. Niagara has a lot of commercial traffic (Semi's and what have you) not to mention tons of debris. Even though Elmwood is a tad out of the way for me I take it anyways because I know a lot people that typically drive it factor bicyclist into the typical traffic."
Buffalo,35r0st,Dontdieman,2,Wed May 13 01:25:13 2015 UTC,I feel safer on a bike on Niagara than Elmwood.
Buffalo,35r0st,auburner,0,Wed May 13 22:34:14 2015 UTC,"I ride on Niagara on a daily basis. And although the condition of the street itself sucks big time, its way safer for a bicyclist.   Also, I think it's somewhat crazy to expect that bikes should have to stop at stop signs and stop lights like cars. I'm not saying that we shouldn't have rules on the road, but just like Semi's have different rules on the road, I think there needs to be some rules changed for bikes. Like the Idaho stop for example."
Buffalo,35r0st,BarefootDogTrainer,2,Thu May 14 02:11:49 2015 UTC,"I believe most educated & sensibly aware cyclists abide by the Idaho stop manner. I think those who complain about cyclists blowing stop signs and lights may be exaggerating of everyone whether they slow down to look or not, though there is a fair quantity of cyclists who do not even bother to slow to check for a cleared intersection before continuing. But what rules do semis not have to abide? Far as I know big ass trucks have to follow same rules as any other vehicle on the road, especially with stops & intersections."
Buffalo,35r0st,LeJourLeFroid,1 point,Thu May 14 03:35:14 2015 UTC,"You are very correct, semi's don't get any exclusions from the rules, but rather extra ones because of their size, amount of noise made, materials they carry, etc.  All I was trying to say, albeit poorly, was that Semi's > Cars > Bicycles. And that by following that there should be some different rules for cyclists.  Again, not no rules but different. Like how in some places motorcycles can ""Split"" lanes of traffic."

I'm used to punishment passes and MGIF but, overall, traffic here seems better than where I've lived.  Oh yeah, IMO the city could deploy some street sweepers every couple weeks to clear the lanes and put up better signage for all the bike routes and paths since they suck and I can't find them without using g-maps."

I went to college at Buff State and worked on Elmwood. I felt I had to be on high alert at all times because people on cycles seem to not give a fuck about traffic. As if just because they have the right away.. that they are invincible.   But then again, you cant generalize everyone. Some drivers care, other ones dont give a fuck and the same goes for cyclists. I blame it on the lack of legit bike paths in the areas like the Elmwood strip.  I wont lie, there have been a few times where I wanted to run some people down, riding bikes 3 abreast into the road, blocking traffic, with no clear desire to move quickly.  edit: When I say that I felt like I should have been on high alert. I mean that I felt paranoid about driving around there. I think I am an excellent driver, and people can be a lot less careless than me or forbid, intoxicated."

The mass exodus you keep referencing started with a generation of folks who placed priority on automobile based infrastructure and big yards and cookie cutter subdivision homes.    Times are changing, and a lot or the wrongs that were made between 1950-2000's are being righted. So many things happened in that time span that crippled city living, especially rust belt cities."

Buffalo,35luw2,Yling,11,Mon May 11 18:20:58 2015 UTC,Infrastructure breeds population not vice versa.   Baltimore's metro is the 4th largest in the United States so I'm not sure where you get your facts. Pittsburgh has a 2m+ population so if they are losing population then I am not sure at what rate.
Buffalo,35luw2,Yling,-2,Mon May 11 18:34:57 2015 UTC,"First of all, quoting Baltimore as the 4th largest metro is disingenuous -- that's only when grouped with DC.  As its own metro, which accurately captures its regional economy, it is much, much smaller.  Anyway, I'm not sure what your point is.  All of the cities I've quoted are Rust Belt towns whose population peaked post-war and have hemorrhaged since. Yes, the metro areas are larger than the city propers, Buffalo included. That fact underpins, rather than undermines, my conservative attitude toward the meaning of new development."

Buffalo,35luw2,Yling,1 point,Tue May 12 12:36:12 2015 UTC,Pittsburgh has been booming for the past decade.
Buffalo,35luw2,LowItalian,1 point,Thu May 14 16:37:07 2015 UTC,"The corporations which occupy the downtown business district have been ""booming"" relative to Pittsburgh's continually shrinking population. Yes, Pittsburgh is shinier than it was in the 80s -- but booming it is not.  Here's a graph so you can contextualize what's been going on in the Rust Belt versus the rest of America."
Buffalo,35luw2,whirlpool138,11,Thu May 14 16:53:09 2015 UTC,"Take a drive a few hours west and come take a look at Utica if you want to see a city in decline. New investments like those going on in Buffalo are easily the most positive developments that Upstate cities have seen in decades. True, the city is still losing people, but if you look at the the percentage loss over the last few Censuses (Censi?), the rate has been slowing down pretty consistently, and Buffalo should hit break even in the next few years, and then probably start seeing growth again."
Buffalo,35luw2,Yling,-1,Mon May 11 18:17:31 2015 UTC,"I think you mean a few hours east.  Again, you're equating new buildings with a new economy that hasn't demonstrated success in other, similar cities and is, at best, only weakly existent in the case of Buffalo.  And if you want to compare localities, compare the city of Buffalo with its surrounding suburbs. As far as new restaurants, employment centers and entertainment attractions go, the suburbs continue to outbuild the core."
Buffalo,35luw2,whirlpool138,10,Mon May 11 18:26:46 2015 UTC,"Are you sure about the suburbs out building the core?   I don't have the data to support this in front of me, but billions of dollars are being invested in city development and I don't know of any suburb projects that come close to the price tag and scale of just the things going on at the medical campus or canalside alone, not even touching all the other city projects.   And for the first time in decades the city didn't lose population last year.   I'm not saying buffalo's not without problems, but things really are getting better downtown. Most every positive metric is going up - employment, housing prices, wages, infill etc."
Buffalo,35luw2,Yling,1 point,Mon May 11 19:02:41 2015 UTC,"Have you been inside the metropolitan core recently? This comment says it all for you. Suburban development cannot be compared to the multiple-million dollar developments happening with the city. Where are all the hotel and apartment conversions (outside of Niagara Falls)? Or college expansions? The only thing the suburbs have going for them is retail expansion due to the Canadians coming over here to shop and even then, the city of Niagara Falls is starting to over take Amherst (it's way more enjoyable going to the Fashion Outlets and Military road over the Boulevard, plus it's right on the border)."

Buffalo,35luw2,Yling,1 point,Thu May 14 16:56:49 2015 UTC,"You are comparing Buffalo to a whole other city that outside of being a Great Lakes/Rust Belt city, has little in common with Buffalo's current development. I have been there recently actually, I had to travel cross country consistently over this past year during my service in the Americorps. Buffalo is booming compared to most areas of the country. Staying on Elmwood is a bubble too, that area has been developed for over 15 years now. Maybe you should get out and explore the city more instead of staying in one neighborhood."

Buffalo,35luw2,FTG716,1 point,Mon May 11 20:08:45 2015 UTC,"Not sure why I can't down vote you but this is false. The census is published every ten years. Between 2000 and and 2010 Buffalo shed 30,000 people, which is a massive loss in a sub-300k city."
Buffalo,35luw2,Yling,1 point,Thu May 14 13:09:27 2015 UTC,"Have you read the recent census data? The NY times published a story last year about how Buffalo's metro is actually significantly growing now, faster than NYC and Chicago actually. A big part of the reason is because during 2000-2010, the Millennial generation was still in high school, now that they are coming of age, they are fleeing the suburbs and moving back into cities across the US. The areas with the most crime and abandonment issues are actually starting to become the suburbs now (especially after the Great Recession)."
Buffalo,35luw2,716in619,1 point,Thu May 14 16:48:10 2015 UTC,"Okay, the post I responded to cited ""Buffalo"" and ""the last census"". The last census was in 2010 and the city of Buffalo lost a shit ton of people between 2000 and 2010.  I couldn't find the article you're talking about on the NY Times website, but I also can't figure out what argument you're making. Are you saying that the Buffalo metropolitan area has grown since 2010 because young people are moving back to the city? The Buffalo metro area is largely suburban, so that doesn't make logical sense.  Anyway, you're wrong. Just took a look at the census estimates, which are available at census.gov.  Census Estimates for Buffalo City    2010 census: 261,310 2010 est: 261,310 2011 est: 260,334 2012 est: 259,387 2013 est: 258,959   Census estimates for Buffalo-Cheektowaga-Niagara Falls, NY Metro Area   2010 Census: 1,135,509 2010 est: 1,135,342 2011 est: 1,135,411 2012 est: 1,135,067 2013 est: 1,136,153 2014 est: 1,136,360 % est growth in 4 years: 0.07%   New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA Metro Area   2010 Census: 19,567,410 2014 est: 20,092,883 % est growth in 4 years: 2.6%   Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI Metro Area   2010 Census: 9,461,105 2014 est: 9,554,598 % est growth in 4 years: 0.9%   So, no, Buffalo city is still declining in population according to recent census estimates. There's been a tiny little increase in population in the metro area, but no, it's not greater than the Chicago or NYC metro areas.  All this data tells me is that the Buffalo region is stagnate in population and that the city of Buffalo is not substantially participating in the ""movement back to the city"" that's observed in other parts of the country.  Note: I calculated the % est. growth. Didn't see that freely available on census.gov."
Buffalo,35luw2,Flat_corp,5,Thu May 14 17:43:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're 100% wrong but I also don't think it's as cut and dry lipstick on a pig development as you're making it out to be.  Metro population I believe has leveled out and even upticked a bit, which I think is more evident of regional health than population loss in the city proper (not to say that's a good thing).  I'd tend to agree with you in the broader sense that I think as a city we can get a little too excited about development projects that really don't address the issue of entrenched and chronic poverty."

Buffalo,35luw2,Yling,3,Tue May 12 00:39:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't blame people anymore when they do this. It's simply entrenched in the psyche of most Buffalonians in their late 20's to 60's. My father shits on every single good thing that happens to this city. It takes years, sometimes generations, to erase the cynicsm that comes with terrible politicians, bad deals, and just overall decay. Sooner or later though if good things keep happening, people will start to come around. I recently reconnected with an ex of mine and enjoyed telling her about all of the recent developments and that it had to be seen to be believed and even then I got the ""Yah... but it's Buffalo..."" People just don't want to accept that good things are happening, because fall is that much harder when you hit the ground the higher up you are."

As far as getting people and business to come to a city, I would say it's most important to strengthen and expand its successful neighborhoods.    Look at all the best parts of Buffalo -- none of them are typified by these types of single-shot, big money developments.  Nearly all of them display a strong class of small businesses supported by populations with cash to spend that they receive from their work in the well-paying parts of the regional economy (banking, back-offices, health and education), along with a large community of artists.  This is what I don't see, and what I don't think we will see, in ""Pegulaville."""

Buffalo,35luw2,copsarebastards,4,Tue May 12 04:22:41 2015 UTC,"I guess my personality is a novelty account.   Why does this opinion suck? Gentrification improves neighborhoods. It improves schools through a larger and more affluent tax base, it creates jobs through more businesses and more affluent customers, it  beautifies areas because people take pride in their neighborhoods and businesses improve the exteriors of their business, it reduces crime because people expect more from their police departments. There are people who lose out because they cannot afford the neighborhood but not everyone can win in life. Look at every area where gentrification has occurred in every city and the neighborhood and city are better for it. Sometimes the truth hurts."
Buffalo,35luw2,SoBuffaloRes,-1,Tue May 12 11:42:30 2015 UTC,"It's a racist process that often doesn't occur until affluent whites displace minorities, for one. The process you are referring to is urban renewal. It's the same thing, just gentrification is the negative side of the debate.  The idea that it takes a group of bourgie whites for a community to take pride in their neighborhood is not true. Often times it has more to do with the property owners than the community members desire or lack of desire for the community to look nice. Same with the police comment. You are implying a shift in the priorities of community members that is based on racial essentialism. Many times gentrification displaces unique local shops and minority culture. Point is, the issue is an ongoing debate with strong arguments for both sides that should be considered. There are things more important than economics. To say so matter of fact that it's a good thing is just privilege."
Buffalo,35luw2,copsarebastards,2,Tue May 12 14:55:33 2015 UTC,"Gentrification is another name for urban renewal.  Unless you are saying only minorities can do urban renewal, and otherwise, it's white people and gentrification and bad?  If this is what you are stating, you, my friend, are a racist of the worst type.  Akin to Klansmen proclaiming they are on the side of black folk too, they just want the races to be pure."

I've never understood why gentrification is seen as bad.  Properties improve, average wages increase, employment increases.  Do some people get priced out?  Maybe.  But, then there's always lower priced areas to move to.  Or, perchance, once can actually improve their station in life and not get priced out."

Buffalo,35hqx3,dan_blather,10,Sun May 10 14:21:50 2015 UTC,"It's cool but similar to Penn, Grand Central & Union Station - I like our central terminal, just wish it were MORE central to downtown, had it been built at the exchange street station location originally && incorporated transfer to other light rail routes along with the main subway, it may have never seen a downfall"
Buffalo,35hqx3,LeJourLeFroid,5,Sun May 10 14:30:46 2015 UTC,"With the growth of airplane usage and seeing railroads become mostly for freight across most of the country, there's no way it would have survived here, regardless of where in the city it is. The reason it's out from downtown is also because that's where a few lines meet in a junction, so the location makes sense in railroad terms. It's unfortunate but it was a worthy attempt at something useful."
Buffalo,35hqx3,landofpeanuts,5,Sun May 10 16:22:38 2015 UTC,"What I meant was if things were tied together more centralized, linking other modes of transportation & if there were more light rail, it would still be used today as other stations that have interlinked modes of transportation in other metropolitan areas. Are you sure it wasn't built there because at the time it was the most vacant area for the platforms or that it was thought that area would ""boom""?  I don't think the terminal was built there specifically for the converging railroad lines there. The transit line is really one line through the area. Then again I don't know if public transit were ever on any of the other lines there, most of the other lines lead to industrial locations & bypass the station.  Maybe one or two for cargo that may have stopped at Central but those lines also tie into the main transit line, which goes through exchange street."
Buffalo,35hqx3,LeJourLeFroid,8,Sun May 10 16:44:52 2015 UTC,"Here's a good map that illustrates why the Central Terminal was located where it was:  http://railsandtrails.com/Maps/Buffalo/BuffaloMap-100.jpg  In terms of passenger traffic, not much was heading up to Niagara Falls/Toronto in 1920. Instead, the West Shore, the Erie, the Pennsylvania, and NY Central's other lines had much more passenger service heading to Cleveland, Detroit, and Chicago. The problem was that for trains that picked up in Buffalo before continuing south/east/west, they had to back up until they got to a junction where they could then continue on their way. This kind of delay was huge nuisance for an industry that marketed reliable schedules."
Buffalo,35hqx3,thisisntnam,5,Sun May 10 19:16:04 2015 UTC,"Also, the two stations that WERE downtown (the Lehigh and the DL&W), both were demolished over the last fifty years. If the Central Terminal was downtown, it most certainly have met the same fate. Buffalo, like most cities, was very happy to demolish ""white elephant"" buildings.   The old DLW station (NFTA still uses a portion of the station): http://www.forgottenbuffalo.com/forgottenbuffalolost/thedlwterminal.html  Lehigh Valley: http://wnyheritagepress.org/photos_week_2008/lehigh_valley_terminal/lehigh_valley_terminal.htm"

The ""downtown would move east"" story is an urban legend.  Downtown Buffalo has always been linear, following Main Street.  Locals were optimistic that the Broadway-Fillmore neighborhood would turn into an ""uptown Buffalo"", but that never happened.  Plans for Union Station included a loop, so trains can return to the NYC and B&O mainlines, and westward to Chicago.  That's why the site was so big."

Buffalo,35hqx3,buffalo-mitch,2,Sun May 10 16:29:21 2015 UTC,"Well the location would not work in terms of the actual railroad.  The Central Terminal is where it is today because it is the location of of the New York Central Track switch between the New York-Chicago line and the line to Toronto/Niagara Falls.  Secondly, had this plan been implemented, it would have cost us city hall in its current form and location."

The cities are actually very similar and each has their good and bad quirks and personalities. I could fill an entire book on the different nuances. There are two major differences. First, almost no one lives in downtown Buffalo and the area far less vibrant and walkable as pittsburgh's golden triangle/ north shore. Second, Buffalo seems to be changing at a faster pace than Pittsburgh. It seems to me buffalo is what Pittsburgh was 15-20 years ago. It's been exciting to watch the beginnings of a turnaround for the city of buffalo. If it continues, buffalo will be a great place to live and work, not unlike how Pittsburgh is now."
Buffalo,35f7e7,minkus1342,3,Sat May 9 20:21:14 2015 UTC,"For some reason Buffalo has a higher population density than Pittsburgh on paper but it doesn't seem that way when you're there. Maybe it's due to the very flat topography of Erie County. Also, correct me if I'm wrong, but there seems to be a lot less traffic in Buffalo than Pittsburgh."
Buffalo,35f7e7,mycrows,7,Sat May 9 21:10:00 2015 UTC,"Driving in pittsburgh is terrible, combining poor city planning with mountainous terrain.  You know how bad getting on the 33 from the 90 is during rush hour?  Well basically everything in pittsburgh is always like that.  EDIT: on the other hand pittsburgh has uber and lyft so really Pittsburgh wins in the end."
Buffalo,35f7e7,bjt23,3,Sat May 9 23:17:01 2015 UTC,I would agree with the population density. The geography of pittsburgh adds to the character and vibrancy of its neighborhoods. The flat geography of buffalo on the other hand make navigating so much easier.  I'm not sure I completely agree with the point about traffic. There are some really bad interchanges in buffalo. Also the upkeep of roads is worse in buffalo because of the damage done by plows. Traffic probably depends mostly on where and when you are driving in each city though.

Buffalo,35f7e7,FancyAndImportantMan,3,Sat May 9 22:21:02 2015 UTC,"Buffalo is Pittsburgh 15 years ago.  It's on the verge, you have the same high levels of civic pride with a lot of young people making the effort to improve the city that they care a lot about.  It's like Pittsburgh in that you're either a Bills and Sabres fan, or you're an outsider, but the city is very passionate about it's sports teams.  The city still has inexpensive places to live that are nice, where as the cost of living in Pburgh is really starting to go up.  It's much more of a ""community"" feeling than the burgh (especially more than DC), because it's smaller and not nearly as isolated as parts of burgh can be.  The people, the food, the sports, it's A LOT nicer in the summer time in Buffalo than it is in Pittsburgh, not nearly as stuffy and overwhelming, DC isn't even a comparison.  Yes, there's a lot more snow than anywhere you've experienced before, but they do as good a job removing the snow as they do in Pittsburgh (if not better) and the people are pretty stalwart about it, so those ""IDIOTS WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO DRIVE IN THE SNOW!"" are much more few and far between than pretty much anywhere South."
Buffalo,35f7e7,MrF33,3,Sat May 9 21:56:08 2015 UTC,"Left Buffalo, but go back pretty often [family].  Regardless, I love Buffalo, and you will too, if you have a decent job.  It was hard for me to find work in my 20's, when Buffalo was poor[er], but I'd go back, if I could do what I'm doing now, there.  Maybe someday... anyhow, for others, I still recommend it.  Allentown and Elmwood Village are excellent neighborhoods, very walkable, with food and entertainment, also affordable. Beautiful houses, lots of bars [open to 4am, if you're into that kind of thing] and good restaurants, safe, and lots of families, non-families, great galleries, art and artists.  If you are awesome, and like places that are awesome, then you should go."

It's easy to come here and feel right at home. Hell, look at Rex Ryan. He was the coach for one of our most hated rivals, now he's here and he might as well have been a Buffalonian from the start.  Then theres the locale. Lots of great local food chains (Mighty Taco, Duff's, and the Anchor Bar are probably the more popular ones, but by no means are they the only ones) and plenty of great scenery like Niagara Falls and the naval park.  Obviously I'd recommend you come visit the city beforehand, but I think it'd be a smooth transition from one rust belt city to another."

Our parks are pretty awesome & while they're not as awesome as the emerald necklace they're awesome on their own level, such as proximity to state parks, the falls, Niagara gorge, there's a leaking natural gas pocket where you can light a flame behind waterfalls, speaking of falls, there are fair share of excellent locations of waterfalls."

Buffalo,35cvpa,holysweetbabyjesus,5,Sat May 9 22:21:19 2015 UTC,A larger crime rate in this context means that there are more crimes per capita (that means per person) than in other similar sized cities.

Buffalo,35cvpa,flancresty,-1,Sat May 9 19:01:21 2015 UTC,Name calling and poor grammar and I'm the one who needs to grow up?
Buffalo,35cvpa,holysweetbabyjesus,4,Sun May 10 13:46:56 2015 UTC,Yes.
Buffalo,35cvpa,flancresty,-1,Sun May 10 14:05:49 2015 UTC,"Forgot to add a lack of reading comprehension. I never said anything about all the drunk drivers are whites, but you want to call someone a racist idiot to avoid thinking about your own shortcomings.  The point is that this crime map focuses on ""gangs"" when drunk driving violence occurs an order of magnitude more frequently than shootings and other ""gang"" crimes, but nobody makes a map of those because it's not another way to cast aspersions on poor black people.  But that clearly sailed miles over your head.  Also, rates of things can be higher or lower, not larger or smaller."
Buffalo,35cvpa,holysweetbabyjesus,5,Sun May 10 14:19:06 2015 UTC,Ha ha ha. Good one.
Buffalo,35cvpa,LonelyNixon,2,Sun May 10 14:27:16 2015 UTC,"A lot of the map was poor puerto rican people. It's not all about black and white. There are other ethnic groups and it upsets me that you are expressing such prejudice by assuming all of the high crime zones are black neighborhoods.  As for drunk driving it's an apples to orange comparison. It happens everywhere drinking exists, and it's not really a map with much relevance as drunk driving has less restrictive boundaries due to car and crosses all cultural and economic barriers. Also sober drivers kill more people with cars than guns a year too. Vending machines kill more people than lions by falling on people."
Buffalo,35cvpa,flancresty,0,Sun May 10 14:43:15 2015 UTC,"A lot of the map was poor puerto rican people. It's not all about black and white. There are other ethnic groups and it upsets me that you are expressing such prejudice by assuming all of the high crime zones are black neighborhoods.   The city is just 10% Latino, about half of whom (5.8%) are Puerto Ricans so no, a ""lot"" of the map is not Puerto Ricans (and if you're going to feign outrage, at least show Puerto Ricans the respect of capitalizing their ethnicity). I'm pretend upset that you lump all Latinos into the category of Puerto Rican.   . Also sober drivers kill more people with cars than guns a year too. Vending machines kill more people than lions by falling on people.   Those are accidents and irrelevant. Drunk driving certainly has fewer boundaries, but can also be mapped, most drunk drivers are not one-time actors. We know where people who have been arrested for DWI live.  Moreover, unlike most gang violence, drunk driving violence is random. If I'm not involved in a shady deal, I'm not likely to be the victim of gang violence. My actions have little to do with whether I will suffer at the hands of a drunk driver."

Pano's on Elmwood HAS food vegetarians can eat but it is not very good. India Gate on Elmwood has veg options and the food is decent but the interior is not really very nice for a business lunch. Acropolis on Elmwood has decent falafel stuff/veggie burgers/non meat entrees Sun on Niagara can make almost every dish with tofu and has lots of fresh and delicious vegetable rolls in the sushi options. Thai/Burmese. Wine/Beer available. This is my favorite! Amy's Place on Main is amazing but a bit of a jaunt. almost every single thing is delicious. Saigon Cafe on Elmwood is great as well. Thai. Bar. Hardware on Allen has a make your own veggie burger option and does great grilled asparagus. Bar there. Allentown Burger Venture on Allen has veggie burgers. Fancy beer bar there. (weird seating on tall bar stools, slow service so go only if you have time to wait a bit) Gatur's is Ethopian on Allen that is delicious and the veggie options are awesome. (Also a bit slow) Presto almost next door on Allen has good sandwiches and the staff is adorable Cafe 59 across the street from Presto/Gatur's is also a sandwich/entree place. Bar there. Panero's on Delaware/Allen is Italian with a few good veg options NOT a Panera's chain it is a little locally run place (Big dishes for pasta, good salads) Oshun downtown has interesting veg side dishes but not a lot of entrees but if they eat fish/seafood it is great. Bar there. Cantina Loco has tofu tacos that are great and also a bar as well.

It just didn't make financial sense.  Now, Downtown, if he could get a decent lot and decent rent/least/purchase price, would be viable.  The next closest market is Tops on Niagara."

Excellent seasoning, good beef, perfect crust. I will rate 10/10 if I can eat it faster - since they don't have seating, I had to take it to go.   Apple Empanada: 7/10. Canned apple filling (not bad, but not special), and overly sugared on the outside. Delicious, but lots of room for improvement.   Mac & Cheese: 8/10. Not quite cheesy or flavorful enough to be a 10, but definitely super tasty. Had a mexican-seasoned flair to it. Will try again.   Friends were split between this place and Niagara Cafe's pastelillos. I preferred this place.     They need some seating aside from the banquet seating (not accessible today), and the place will be excellent.

While many of the trends between Buffalo and Detroit have been similar for decades, they really are very different cities.  Buffalo is a much smaller city in terms of land mass and population, but the neighborhoods are much more intact.  Detroit has a much larger city and metro area.   There are some ridiculously wealthy suburbs, and some parts of the city are coming back, basically the areas mentioned in the article.     I think they have a nice Downtown, as well, although it's sort of an island, where people from the suburbs visit by highway.   Not that Buffalo isn't at least somewhat like this, but it's much less extreme.  Detroit doesn't have neighborhoods like North Buffalo, where the commercial strip (Hertel) looks nice, and street after street of houses look nice too."

I would check that because it can lead you down a path of faulty logic. Just like how you jumped to the conclusion that I was excusing racism endured by African Americans because at times African Americans can also exhibit racist behavior. In reality, we are all capable of exhibiting racist behavior and of course, that does not make it okay. I would also ask, from reading your comment about power structures, that you assume that African Americans and/or any other non-whites inherently could not be in control of a ""Power Structure"". That line of thought in it self could be construed as racist."
Buffalo,350b0a,Dontdieman,1 point,Thu May 7 03:12:39 2015 UTC,"Confirmation bias how? We are all capable of discrimination and prejudice. We aren't all capable of racism.

Buffalo,350b0a,copsarebastards,1 point,Thu May 7 04:40:28 2015 UTC,You selectively use the social stratification definition of racism to further your preconceived notion the only whites are capable of acts of racism while ignoring many other widely accepted definitions of the word that do not place heavy emphasis on sociopolitical status when discerning what would constitute an act of racism. It's a pretty clear conformation bias.
Buffalo,350b0a,Dontdieman,1 point,Thu May 7 05:06:37 2015 UTC,"Not really. It's the best definition of racism. I am a sociology student. I don't have any desire to talk about society in any way other than the way sociologists do. There's no point when I have a couple hundred years of work I can refer to, rather than some anecdote about what some random person thinks racism is. Discrimination covers the other usages of the word racism, and racism has to do with more than stratification- if you read that article it gives a nice overview."
Buffalo,350b0a,copsarebastards,1 point,Thu May 7 05:22:36 2015 UTC,"Discrimination covers ALL of the definitions of racism, as it is a broad term that defines the distinctions we make (favorable or unfavorable) when presented with a varied set of factors like religion, economic class, age, gender....ect.

Buffalo,350b0a,BuffRisingCommenter,4,Thu May 7 02:11:21 2015 UTC,I grew up in Depew/Cheektowaga and it's about as bad as you'd expect.  It's so ingrained in the culture in these suburbs from white flight resentment that it genuinely makes me think we'll never truly turn the corner when it comes to addressing poverty.    I have relatives who had literally not been past the city line in over a decade - it's mind boggling how segregated we are.  Makes the One Buffalo shit being thrown around seem like dark comedy.

Buffalo,350b0a,tmp_acct9,0,Wed May 6 18:04:44 2015 UTC,not letting a black person in is a racist act of discrimination. Discrimination is based on prejudice. Whether these things are racist or not has to do with whether it's contributing towards and based on a racially essentialist view- for example one that attributes crime to black people as a race.
Buffalo,350b0a,copsarebastards,1 point,Wed May 6 18:24:02 2015 UTC,"I suppose I mean the colloquial definition then, as well as the literal.

Buffalo,350b0a,Physics_Unicorn,2,Thu May 7 02:01:30 2015 UTC,Yeah I just prefer to be technical because the jargon definition points to the history of racism and the social construction of race that America is basically founded on. It's important stuff.

I've met a lot of people who are from the Southtowns and haven't actually been exposed to folks outside their general community much...the things I've heard, ""jokes"" etc.  It may seem harmless but it breeds a steady racist undertone to daily life that doesn't sit well with me."
Buffalo,350b0a,OhShaSha,3,Wed May 6 13:00:35 2015 UTC,This place definitely has a huge problem with racism. I think it's because the city is so segregated.

I took off running towards the Bon-Ton and one guy was able to hit me in the side of the head with his fist.    Luckily a guy in his mid 20s was watching and pulled up in his car.  I think he had a crowbar or something and scared off the black guys.  I was in the guys car and he said he had been watching them for some time.  This was a long time ago, so I can't remember but I think he said they had attacked someone else too.

They are also one of the larger local companies, which gave me peace of mind. They were great - fast, cleaned up well, and the roof looks great.   When I moved into a new house, the prior owners had just had the roof replaced by Dalex.  I've had them back a couple times to do some minor gutterwork and roof modification, and I found them to be very reliable, knowledgeable, and easy to work with. I think they tend to be on the expensive side and maybe specialize in tall/complex roofs, but I think they're still worth calling.   tl;dr - get multiple quotes, and I recommend calling Stockmohr and Dalex."

As for an apartment/house/loft, it'll depend on your price range and your desirables. Buffalo ain't very big in the square mileage department, but personally, I still like to live close to my job. Downtown has a ton of properties available, mainly apartment or loft, but it doesn't have much in the way of walkable grocery options. It does have very easy access to all the highways in every direction, walkable access to many of our concert venues, the First Niagara Center (hockey, lacrosse, concerts), Coca Cola Field (AAA baseball), etc. The Herd's not in town this weekend, which is too bad, but I'm sure one of the other Redditors will come up with some sort of happening or festival. There's at least one every weekend somewhere. I'm partial to North Buffalo since I grew up there. Check out Hertel Avenue between Delaware and Parkside. Great mix of quiet neighborhoods and places to shop, eat, drink. Walkable stuff up and down.  Go get a hot dog or two at Ted's (many locations, including one in Tempe, AZ if you're ever out that way...my wife's from Phoenix so we go there for a taste of Buffalo when we visit the in-laws). Ted's hot sauce (ketchup + relish + magic), mustard, onion on the dog."

Buffalo,34xoj2,ideabook3,1 point,Tue May 5 13:24:23 2015 UTC,"Don't live in North Buffalo or near Hertel. I lived there for 18 years growing up before my family moved near Delaware Park. You're isolating yourself with a 5-10 minute drive from any other interesting part of the city. Sure, there are a few exciting places popping up here and there, but the development on the West Side with places like Black Sheep, Martin Cooks, and Providence Social popping up, its clear which way the city is growing from Allentown and the Elmwood Village."
Buffalo,34xoj2,FancyAndImportantMan,3,Tue May 5 13:44:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah North Buffalo is fine if you don't' mind conducting all your business up in that area. But it feels so isolated from everywhere else in the City, almost like a suburb. I used to work up there and I don't miss the rubberneck traffic or the snobbish attitude toward the rest of the city at all.  (Unfortunately, a good chunk of this sub lives in NB so brace yourself for the downvotes :( )"
Buffalo,34xoj2,Eudaimonics,2,Tue May 5 14:23:47 2015 UTC,"I live in North Buffalo and I visit the other areas of the city all the time.  Its a 5 minute car ride to Elmwood, or a 15 minute bike ride. I've never not gone to Allen because its a 20 minute drive away. The park and ride at UB South is very convenient to get downtown.  Maybe you're talking about older residents though?  I do agree North Buffalo is not as exciting as Elmwood, Allentown or what is going on on the Westside. But I think that has to do with there being more old time residents and not being isolated.  However, Hertel has an awesome collection of restaurants, a great classical movie theatre, awesome shops for antiques and furniture, and a decent bar scene (though the crowds are not as young). We have our own Farmers Market, soon our own Lexington Coop and when it comes to Middle Eastern or Italian there are a lot of great places to check out.  Delaware Park is just a 0-15 minute walk away no matter where you live."
Buffalo,34xoj2,Sayoshinn,2,Tue May 5 15:42:45 2015 UTC,"Craigslist and Artvoice classifieds are probably your best bet for apartments, especially in Elmwood/Allentown area. If you like the downtown loft vibe, The Buffalo Lofts have several locations around the area. Take a look through North Buffalo as well. If you like Elmwood, Hertel Ave is coming up nicely as well and is likely a bit cheaper."

Buffalo,34xoj2,Braxo,2,Tue May 5 13:36:57 2015 UTC,"Essentially, anything directly North of Delaware Park in its entirety can be considered North Buffalo up until the city limits at Kenmore Ave.  However, then you have actual neighborhoods including North Buffalo proper itself, North Park (older name but still popular to describe the heart of Hertel Ave), University Heights (the area West of UB's South Campus) and Parkside (wedged between Delaware Park and Main Street).  To the South of Delaware Park/Forest Lawn Cemetary, you have Elmwood Village and Delaware.  West of Richmond is usually the agreed line for the Westside and East of Main is the near Eastside, which both have more specific neighborhood names.  Neighborhood names will vary from one another. Lots of older names that are not used as much and a few newer ones."
Buffalo,34xoj2,WorkAccount716,1 point,Tue May 5 15:33:01 2015 UTC,"Allentown and Elmwood will have apartments/houses, but they might be a bit pricey. Wes Side has a lot of good apartments but some parts are better than others. Generally the closer to Richmond the better."

Elmwood areas include streets like Richmond, Norwood, Ashland, Elmwood between Lexington and Bidwell (farmer's market this Saturday morning).  I would add Hertel Ave to your list as well - centered around where Mes Que Bar is about - a lot in that area.  I would suggest having a nice porch so you can porch-it during the summer."

I've been with Sprint 10+ years and I think they've gotten better but verizon and at&t are miles better.   Not only do they both have faster speeds than sprint they definitely have much better coverage both in the city and outside it.   You can get by with Sprint in the city but you'll definitely be annoyed when your friends with verizon and at&t have better reception, even sometimes when you have no reception at all."

Granted, in some rural regions, away from metropolitan areas, the network does become limited.   It's alright there are times the network seems overloaded.   The basic function which I use it most, making calls works quite well.     Data. Seemingly sufficient.     Getting upset that a Web page doesn't load promptly is about as logical as expecting a pc with a dual core 4ghz processor with 6gb ram to load anything at the speed of light.

Buffalo,34uh3s,LonelyNixon,2,Tue May 5 03:48:01 2015 UTC,"T-mobile has excellent coverage in the city of buffalo and the towns that actually touch it. So the immediate northtowns, easttowns, southtowns and the city itself will give you some sexy sexy lte speeds.   As you probably know though t-mobile becomes more nebulous in outlying areas. The recent shift the band 12 has helped out quite a bit and there is awesome coverage along the 90 now and theoretically the lte expansion is set to improve. So if you live within the city itself tmo is the way to go.  The not full unlimited plans have free data for music streaming(for most services including some like google music where you can upload your own music) and the non prepaid plans have roll over data.   Also tmobile is notably better than sprint in terms of speed and coverage. Sprint can be spotty as hell. They do have lte here though so I doubt its that bad, but still my experiences with sprint show it's not the best choice to make."

There are some dead zones inside of some lecture halls here and there, but as band 12 finally reaches us this should change, and you have wifi in these zones and t-mobile has wifi calling on many of their devices which allows the sending and receiving of texts via wifi in said dead zones."

If you aren't going to travel much, or you are going to travel to only a few specific cities that you know have service, then go T-Mobile.

When will we see progress instead of waiting till exactly 2019 as NYS Is behind on times for the state we live in that use high speed internet especially with companies looking to come here that can use it and wont pay out the ass for it.  Will we see instant residential speed results rather than them working on businesses first?  Do they plan on actually focusing on Non NYC areas first because they already have some municiples and fiberoptic speeds in place. As people with TWC and only TWC should receive support first seeing that Verizon Fios does not plan to do nothing, and TWC has no interest in upgrading speeds to their MAXX Service which essentially brings 4x the speed we currently receive.  Do they really show any interest in rolling it out quicker in areas that can receive such upgrades quicker or areas that cant receive speeds, so meaning what are they going to prioritize as I know I should be happy with what I got compared to those who cant even get 5mbps, But Hey Ive had this speed since adelphia and service, speeds, and quality has not changed so im technically in the stone age still paying out the butt for the speeds we get which is 30/5 since pretty much adelphia came to town. So who would be prioritized before 2019.  Do they plan to actually look into NYS and realize they should do full Gigabit in most of the state besides those out in the sticks who would get the 100mbps speeds?  Do they care enough to actually bring by 2019 this service faster to compete with other states as they should to bring in tech companies and promote internet based services for residents ect?  Im more along the consumer side but I really would like to know some things because I have waited too long to see any type of upgrade for NYS Internet not in the NYC Area, and after fios flipped us off I care to know about these things"

I think (hope) it will.  Fisher points out how the finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE) sectors of the economy are fueling most of the rebounding in Buffalo -- but, even though they are contributing to what Fisher calls ""sprawl without growth"", I think they, along with sectors like food service, retail, and entertainment/hospitality/tourism, will be enough to ""tide Buffalo over"", until things like the manufacturing sector (represented by the aforementioned Solar City project), the ""Eds and Meds"" sector (represented by the growth of the BNMC), and the entrepreneurship sector (represented by 43North's business competition) increase their share of the local economy."

We've been the back-office location for about 30 years now, and it's a key reason we weathered the recession with minimal damage.  Now, should we diversify?  Yes.  Should we be alarmed by the large proportion of the local economy tied up in finance, insurance, and Real Estate?  Not really.  We don't have real estate booms here, so we don't have busts.

Buffalo,34p9v6,FTG716,10,Sun May 3 14:12:10 2015 UTC,"Easiest -> Hardest   Night Buses - First, initiate a single line consisting of 4 buses. This line would extend from downtown, up Elmwood, down Hertel, and then back down Main. With cabs being so inconsistent and expensive in Buffalo, I don't see how this would fail for this single line which connects all the popular nightlife scenes. It will also reduce drunk driving over short distances. Expand service and build out additional lines as needed. Municipal Fiber - Erie County had a $9 million surplus last year. This would be a great initial investment for a network that would pay for itself and put Buffalo on the map. Improve Bus Shelters - I'm still baffled how bus stops in the city lack essential information such as route info, maps and transfer points. Its like the NFTA doesn't want people riding buses. Fine property owners for not shoveling their sidewalks. All funding would go towards a shovel brigade to help out exempt residents (the elderly and the disabled). Stop using salt in the winter and instead use something less corrosive. Bonus points if we could find a cheap way to heat our roadways to just above freezing. We'd save money on plows and a ton of money on maintenance.   Grandoise, but realistic expensive redevelopment scheme   Expand the Metrorail, implement a commuter line between Depew and Niagara Falls, and bring back street cars. Make the Peace Bridge passenger cars only and build a bridge for trucks either near the GM plant or build a second span at the Lewiston-Queenston Bridge. Demolish the 190, Skyway, 33, and 198.   We don't need a ridiculous system, but if we want to get rid of those highways then we need to provide an alternative for commuters. Short lines to major access points of the city.   Expand the Metrorail through South Buffalo and hook it around to the Union Ship Canal for a Park and Ride so we can demolish the Skyway. Expand the Metrorail either to the Central Terminal if not the airport and build park and rides so we can demolish the 190 and the 33. Commuter Rail from Depew to Niagara Falls with stops wherever there is a high concentration of people or jobs. Build a park and ride near the GM Plant. This will help facilitate the removal of the 190.  Expand the Metrorail to Buffalo State and connect it to the new commuter rail service. We are now able to complete rid ourselves of the 198. Trolleys for high density corridors without the room for a metrorail extension.    Without the highways, the Peace Bridge is no longer suitable for truck traffic. Considering these bridges use tolls, it really is not expensive for the tax payer to fund an additional span some place else.  Finally   Eliminate Cyclical Poverty - Which also solves Buffalo's school, crime, and gang problems.   We need better well funded programs to help people escape poverty. In the end we will actually be saving money and be able to focus on welfare that tends to our most vulnerable citizens: the elderly, the sick and the disabled.  Our current system does not do nearly enough and even traps people in poverty after they reach a certain point.   Better community healthcare clinics and options Universal preschool and daycare - allowing parents (especially the young ones not prepared for parenthood) to work and study. Expanded workforce programs - training (classroom and onsite) as well as employment programs. Greatly expanded upon youth programs - art, music, athletics (things we already know kids like and will provide them with a sense of community and support they might not get at home) Public housing that better integrates people into society, instead of banishing them to a dark isolated corner of the city. Community empowerment programs - make sure community groups are well funded. They are a valuable catalyst for getting the word out about everything else. They are also integral at making sure these unheard voices have a voice.   Initially very expensive programs all around, though for many of the ideas there is already a foundation.  If we want people to actively take part and care about our shared society, then they need to be included in the discussion.  In time though, we would have more people contributing to society and the money to pay to take care of our sick and elderly.   I'm afraid, it is too long term for any politician to take it seriously since they are all fixated on the short term and their next election."

Buffalo,34p9v6,pornatworkdontstop,2,Tue May 5 01:17:25 2015 UTC,"Why demolish the 190 and 33? Why make it harder for people to get into and out of the city? Some of us that live here have to commute out to the suburbs and that makes things very difficult. I agree with the 198, at least bury it near Delaware Park so that we can reunite it. But getting rid of one of the main arteries into the city doesn't make sense if you want to expand the city. I think we should bury the 190 downtown and the 198. I think the 33 isn't that bad. I agree with almost everything else, especially the light rail. This needs to be expanded into a complex system that would make car usage in and around the city mostly pointless. We need to return to the glory days of our mass transit system.   I think another problem especially playing downtown is the difficulty that businesses have establishing themselves because of the bureaucracy. I feel like it is more about who you know than what you know when it is required to get a permit to do business downtown. The politics are definitely getting in the way of the redevelopment."
Buffalo,34p9v6,Terrible_Toaster,5,Sun May 3 20:35:06 2015 UTC,"Yea the 198 getting replaced I get. It's windy, slow, backs up anyway, and it cuts through a park. It could easily be an avenue and we'd lose almost no time.  The 190 and 33 get genuinely busy and are conduits into and out of the city.  I mean along those stretches on the 190 there's squaw island and lassale park and the downtown waterfront/canalside. You also hav that smelly boat launching point in blackrock.   Personally I don't really care about the 190 clearing up. For what? So some trendy condos can attempt to move in?  Yet another park(don't get me wrong you can never have too many but we aren't exactly a city that's hungry for more). Also the water along that stretch smells pretty bad in the summer and in the winter the water brings cold death winds.   And for all the shit the skyway gets for some reason it's height it exactly why it's not such a bad place. I mean you still have water front park development under it."

Buffalo,34p9v6,algo_rhythm,2,Mon May 4 20:15:52 2015 UTC,"Essentially the 190 cuts through downtown and along the water front.  The destination for at least 50% of the traffic on the 190 is downtown. That being said, there is no reason for the 190 to actually cut through downtown.   Starting out we could remove the 190 from Larkin to the Peace Bridge (and divert all truck traffic North). The Commuter Rail Service would make local trips redundant as well as the connecter to the Metrorail via Buffalo State.  The other 50% of traffic is just passing through and much of it is truck traffic from the Peace Bridge. They can find other routes around. This is why building a second span into Canada just for trucks farther down river is important in order for this all to work.  The 33 cuts through a neighborhood. Buffalo's other routes (Kensington and Broadway) are very much under utilized and are already designed for high amounts of traffic. At best, put it underground and restore the parkway."
Buffalo,34p9v6,Eudaimonics,2,Mon May 4 20:16:45 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it, but the flight of people to the suburbs combined with the auto-commute is what helped destroy the city, and it is what is holding it back from being a great city again.

I'd rather have empty lots that have more of a chance of someone buying the space and rebuilding, than these shitty empty buildings full of broken and boarded up windows that will never get used because nobody wants to pay to clean out the inside enough. We have plenty of historical buildings that are being used, and more that are getting repurposed. We don't need to keep them all.

How much do you want these companies to put down for saving old buildings, they have budgets, something most preservationists don't understand.

Plus a lot of them are still being used for grain storage!  Speaking of Riverworks, it shows what great space we can have out of what most people see as eyesores.   What projects were stopped because of Preservationists? Bass Pro?  Usually they are pushing for projects to get done, like the pressure on Carr with the Cobblestone place. Not much left in the Cobblestone district, why knock down more? for parking? you have to be kidding.  Plenty of demo is done because they can, like Paladino knocking down the Harbor Inn, I mean imagine having it still, with that area on the upswing? It's a grass lot right now.

However, do we preserve the bad with the good?  Preserve lone worker's cottages on the urban prairie?  IMHO, we need a more holistic approach - preserve the urban fabric, repair it where it's been torn, keep it from ripping apart where it's threatened, and ensure what we build is just as good, if not better, than what was there in the past.  Empty lots don't bring progress.  However, it's easier to redevelop a large contiguous area -- 20 or 30 contiguous acres of vacant land -- than 200 lots scattered among the cottages that remain in Polonia.  Economies of scale.

Buffalo,34p9v6,TOMALTACH,1 point,Tue May 5 12:01:42 2015 UTC,"The problem from my perspective is that harborcenter is just another scheme to get money from locals, without providing a new source of revenue from outside WNY- thereby not really adding much to the economy other than a nice story. Its really just a bigger, fancier version of a big-box store. Sure, Pegula will make some money and employ some people, but where is the Marriott gonna send its revenues?How about the Tim Hortons?  Who is going to shop and eat there other than WNY residents? Does Buffalo even need more retail and restaurant space in a city filled with empty buildings and empty storefronts? I'm all for improving the waterfront, but I don't see it as an economic driver.  The solar plant is great news, but I don't see it as a game-changer for the local economy.  If it was a local business that could grow Buffalo, sure, but as a outside endeavour - that's where most of the prosperity will go.   Perhaps I've just seen this story play out in Buffalo and Niagara Falls so many so many times with the same outcome. I don't see how this is different. I mean-  Buffalo couldn't even take chicken wings big time! A couple guys from Ohio did it and set up the company in Minnesota. If Buffalo can't even prosper off its own cultural heritage when others can, what hope is there in any other industry?  Cheap land and labor are some of the few things Buffalo has to offer. That, one of the highest cancer rates in the nation, a commitment to auto travel, and a belief that someone from somewhere else will step on and fix the local economy.

NOT just locals.      Tim Horton's contributes money to hockey programs for kids in the local region.

Many who are here for tournaments stay close to the harborcenter therefore places like liberty hound, the swannie house, riverworks, pearl street, iron works, helium, lagerhaus, the naval park, clinton's dish, buffalo pub, sabres store, hyatt, comfort suites; they're all seeing outside money come in.

I'm paying $39/mo for a 3yr contract, but if I move more than 15 miles away, they waive the contract. 2 yrs is $49, 1yr $59. Not meathead-y at all. It's also private, so they limit the memberships.   I've gone there at typical peak hours (7AM before work and 6PM after work) and the most people I've seen in there at once is maybe 7.   If you're a huge cardio person, it may not be the place for you, as they don't have that many treadmills/ellipticals, but at the same time, it's never crowded, so it may not be a real issue.   They have personal training available, and they're super helpful and intelligent when it comes to that stuff. Once you talk with the owner(s) or a worker their, you'll see what I mean.   I don't do anything crazy at the gym, but a few of my friends who are big into weightlifting and are members there said they have everything they need.   It's also really clean and well maintained.

Buffalo,34eojt,TOMALTACH,3,Thu Apr 30 15:20:45 2015 UTC,"yes that's my company AMA!  Here's some videos I made of kayaking the River.  Against the Grain  Brighter side  btw prices  Tours will probably be $35 for a few hour tour around Silo City with Explore Buffalo. We'll be adding more variety as the season goes on, some including meals from local places like McCarthys (our next door neighbor) and Marcos Deli.  Rentals will be $15 for 1 hour, $30 for 2-3 hours, and $45 for a full day. I can't offer overnight rentals because of insurance but I can arrange for specific location drop offs/pickups, which make for more 1 way fun instead of back and forth. This obviously includes PFD (lifevest) and paddle.  Our kayaks are mostly Pungo 120 or better quality/more length. We'll start modestly but I plan to offer touring kayak rentals by next season.  The Barrel Factory will not be open by the season, but we will be camping out a lot in front on the lawn whenever we don't have a scheduled tour.  Check us out on Facebook for updates, we're still working out the kinks so some things may change."
Buffalo,34eojt,sobuffalo,3,Thu Apr 30 21:35:22 2015 UTC,As a related question:  Where is the best place to put-in if you have your own kayak?
Buffalo,34eojt,fullcircle_bflo,6,Thu Apr 30 19:44:37 2015 UTC,"Starting with the Buffalo River, there is the DEC Launch on Harlem, behind Tops.   Then there is Seneca Bluffs which is still primitive (no docks just dirt launch) but I talked to Councilman Scanlon about getting a launch installed and it's in the works.  Foot of Bailey is another primitive launch, not a great launching point because of access, but a great spot to pull over and freshen up, this is at the confluence of the River and Caz Creek.  Red Jacket park is the Foot of Smith and a nice concrete launch. I'd warn about the crime element if you leave vehicles because it is very secluded, and a favorite for kids drinking.  Mutual Park, easily the nicest public launch in the City, it has EZ Docks, which are basically a dock with a lot of hand rails and a grooved launch to make it as easy as can be.  Riverfront Park is nice but a lot of construction going on so not sure how accessible it will be this year.  Canalside isn't a good place to launch but another spot to freshen up.   Gallagher Beach is a nice launch area, so is Wilkenson Point but it's a bit of a haul to carry kayaks. I use it as another rest stop going around the Coast guard Base.  One of my favorite launches is the East Marsh in Beaver Island on the Northern tip of GI. I wouldn't go alone or with no experience but it's a fun trip to Strawberry Island.  There are some north but I'm not that familiar."

Buffalo,34btpn,francis2559,4,Thu Apr 30 14:52:13 2015 UTC,I took the route to poughkeepsie and it took all day. I think we made a ton of stops.
Buffalo,34btpn,melvin_fry,3,Thu Apr 30 00:19:52 2015 UTC,"Actually there are far less stops today than there were in 1890. The key difference is that Amtrak does not have track rights on most of the line, so all Amtrak trains have to defer to freight trains using the track. With slower moving Bakken oil trains now severely taxing available track in the Buffalo-Albany corridor, congestion is at an all-time high.   Another compounding issue is that there are only two tracks on the majority of the route to Albany. In the heyday of NY Central, there were four tracks available to handle freight and passenger service in both directions. This allowed priority trains to pass slower moving services, something which does not happen today.   Post-Albany, the amount of freight train traffic on the Eastern Hudson lines drops significantly. Provided that Metro North isn't all gummed up, the run from Albany to Penn is usually an on-time affair."
Buffalo,34btpn,Giant_Slor,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:22:58 2015 UTC,"I get that high speed rail for the whole country probably wouldn't work, but it seems to me like the Toronto/Buffalo>NYC corridor, as well as the Boston>NYC>Washington DC corridor would make excellent candidates for laying dedicated passenger tracks."
Buffalo,34btpn,Karma_Redeemed,3,Sat May 2 17:21:29 2015 UTC,"A truly developed high speed rail would make Buffalo the perfect jump off point to explore the country. We're right in the middle of Chicago, Pittsburgh, Toronto, Philly, NYC, and Boston. I'm sure you could include more southern cities like Washington, Cinci and Indy eventually. Imagine being able to take long weekends to any of those places for like $150, and it only taking a couple of hours.  Makes me sad this country is run by such incompetents."
Buffalo,34btpn,moar_distractions,2,Thu Apr 30 12:17:55 2015 UTC,"I think people underestimate how big and spread out our country is. I've ridden trains through Sweden/Germany/Czech Republic, just searching times on Google maps right now, it's not any faster there than it would be to take a train from Western NY to say, Chicago. Would high speed rail be nice? Sure, but people always point to Europe as some super connected region we're supposed to try and be like, and it's not entirely true. Trains can only go so fast without building what I assume would be ridiculously expensive direct shot high speed lines between every big city."
Buffalo,34btpn,unclexbenny,3,Thu Apr 30 13:14:47 2015 UTC,"Paris to Berlin is 650 miles, takes 8 hours by train and 10 hours driving. When I said ""a couple of hours,"" I meant some of the closer ones, but even using that example, if you compare it to Buffalo to Chicago, which is 550 miles, that's an 8 hour drive or 17 HOUR TRAIN RIDE.   Think about the people that don't have a car. Or even just one that they don't want to put the miles on or isn't reliable. Obviously at this point, air travel is tough to compete against, but maybe someday increasing oil prices will make it unfordable. Plus everything about being on a plane is god awful. Plus, there is the actual environmental impact.  I'm also no sure why you think we have to model anything on Europe. We can do better if we want to. Japan is building a train that will go 375 miles from Tokyo to Osaka in 60 minutes."
Buffalo,34btpn,moar_distractions,2,Thu Apr 30 13:52:42 2015 UTC,"Paris to Berlin, two huge cities which I assume have pretty effiecient express service. I agree that we should be able to put in high speed routes between specific major cities here. I traveled from Malmo Sweden to Prague, 505 miles and it took 16-17 hours, right on par with Buffalo to Chicago. I'm just saying that anything going through multiple cities is going to take time, high speed trains or not."
Buffalo,34btpn,unclexbenny,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:34:15 2015 UTC,"Well, Europe is as good a starting point as any for a base model of how HSR can really work, as is Japan and to a lesser extent China.   The reality is though that while they have maintained their passenger and freight rail network to permit upscaling of train speeds, the US waved bye-bye to passenger rail 50 years ago. Whats left are beat up low speed freight lines in most areas."
Buffalo,34btpn,Giant_Slor,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:33:52 2015 UTC,"One of the reasons it works so well in Europe is that most of the continent fits into the Eastern US, which along with high fuel prices, less road infrastructure and already crowded airspace tends to make the train a much more salable option.   I tend to agree with the notion that HSR only works up to the 3-5hr time range. More than that, it's quicker to fly, less than that, its quicker to drive. In the end, there certainly are areas and city pairs where HSR could work like the NEC, Houston/Dallas, Chicago/St. Louis, San Fran/LA, LA/San Diego and Seattle/Portland but there will never be a true nationwide HSR network. It just can't compete against aircraft and airline subsidies."
Buffalo,34btpn,Giant_Slor,2,Thu Apr 30 13:55:45 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you, short fast routes seem to make more sense, especially initially, than a huge nationwide network. Hell, I would love to just see something between Buffalo and Rochester that took 20-30 minutes downtown to downtown. I think it would be pretty convenient."
Buffalo,34btpn,unclexbenny,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:35:33 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see actual HSR come to fruition in this country between certain population centers, but there's no way itll ever fly with the current environment in Washington. I guess it'll have to be sold as Ike did the highways - a major national defense priority."
Buffalo,34btpn,Giant_Slor,2,Thu Apr 30 13:25:26 2015 UTC,"My thought would be that the way to frame it would have to be ""dependance on foreign oil."" I'm sure for some of us, environmental impact is equally important, so I guess you could do both. But you know how conservative radio would immediately turn that into ""liberal tree hugging,"" so good to have both."
Buffalo,34btpn,moar_distractions,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:38:20 2015 UTC,"Good chance that the Empire HSR will be built within the next 20 years. Unlikely a line to Chicago would be built unless train ridership skyrocketed.  Though yes, rail just needs to be as fast as air travel (which is not as fast over medium distances after factoring in travel time to an airport, security and the flight itself).  If a train can get to NYC in 4 hours its pretty competitive to flying considering you're being dropped off in the middle of the city."
Buffalo,34btpn,moar_distractions,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:31:16 2015 UTC,"We have record low oil prices right now. Don't you think if prices were half the cost, a couple of hours combined with a more comfortable seat wouldn't be competitive?"

For an American city, this is actualy on the lower end. Cities with higher obesity rates include DC, San Diego, Jacksonville, Tampa, Chicago, Austin, Charlotte, Pittsburgh Dallas.

It's quite amazing, when you eliminate grains and gluten from your diet, it's really a cleanse.  Then just one bad meal can really throw your system off track.

Buffalo,346zlw,LonelyNixon,3,Wed Apr 29 12:19:57 2015 UTC,Hard to see it getting all the way to Allen from hamburg because it seems like it was a local HS student from what was stated in OP.  I know what shops you are talking about but do not have enough personal experience with them to bad mouth them publicly. I would say start with Allen though.. A simple search will help get the tires spinin.

Just because you live in the burbs doesn't mean you're safe. Danger lies around every turn and theft always possible. Even in safety. Lock your front door, lock your car door, keep valuables out of view, and keep your bike chained up. Trust no one."

The only thing ""of value"" that should always be in there are the registration documents, tire iron, and jack (this is probably the only benefit of carrying around a shitty scissor jack).

You won't end up having to pay it even if something comes in the mail, which it probably won't. Going through the EZpass line turns that $1 toll into like a $20 fee on the main line, not sure what the fee is for the bridges."
Buffalo,347xv9,262Mel,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:16:03 2015 UTC,If you go through an EZ Pass lane without an EZ Pass it records your license and the next time you pass through a toll (bridge or other) they'll pull you over. Happened to my BIL's dad who was visiting from Toronto. His fine was $500.
Buffalo,347xv9,TeslaWiskers,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:17:43 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of a $500 fine but I wouldn't put it past the thruway to do that.

It's possible there is some kind of US/Can reciprocity agreement by which they can harass you. I'd just call their 800 number and explain. They'll probably ask where and when you went through and for your license plate and they'll look it up, if they have it recorded they can tell you how to pay and if not then I wouldn't worry about it. I'd call sooner rather than later though, I think there's a day or two grace period, it's a lot easier to rectify before they start piling stupid fees on top."

Buffalo,346gwb,TheSelfGoverned,2,Tue Apr 28 21:38:25 2015 UTC,"Well, 200k is refundable. Also, there will only be 5 licenses issued with a limit of 20 dispensaries to start out. Demand will be through the roof. Also, being the first to market will give you a huge competitive edge. I would say 210k is pretty cheap considering the demand."

Buffalo,346gwb,TheSelfGoverned,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:42:37 2015 UTC,"That doesn't seem unreasonable. Liquor licenses aren't cheap; they're in the thousands, as well, and they need to be renewed.

This is not just a business, this is a huge change, one which will require huge oversight. Why do you think they're only allowing 5 licenses, with 4 locations each? That's $50,000 a location, $1 million overall.  Regulation and oversight can be expensive, but it's worth the investment."

People successfully do it in their closets with $200 worth of equipment. /r/microgrowery  Government is so comically out of touch with reality.  The real reason for the $200,000 bribe is to limit competition (they have a hard limit of 20 locations, duh) and maintain extremely high profits - also to make sure the poor and middle class don't get a single piece of the pie."
Buffalo,346gwb,TheSelfGoverned,2,Wed Apr 29 05:11:48 2015 UTC,"You sound really paranoid. They have to start small (though, I see the irony of that possibly creating a monopoly). They can't just make it a free for all, anyone grow as much as they want wherever they want. That's what we need regulations for.   As you rightly point out, growing weed is easy. It's literally called weed it grows so easily. If we let anyone grow and sell with little, or no, oversight, we would have neighborhoods all over the state with houses suddenly becoming marijuana-related businesses. That's not how this should work.  I'm very pro-pot, and even used to consider myself somewhat of a libertarian, but the reality of the world doesn't allow for such a simplistic perspective. You have to make so many more considerations when making major decisions like this.   It also seems like they're being pretty transparent about the whole thing, which lends it a lot more credence than it being some bribery, kickback thing like you're making it out to be."

How does the world ""not allow"" for any alternatives to that?"
Buffalo,346gwb,TheSelfGoverned,3,Wed Apr 29 06:00:53 2015 UTC,Is there anyone in the marijuana crowd actually excited for this.  We're not talking about the loose regulations like they have in California here.
Buffalo,346gwb,Eudaimonics,6,Tue Apr 28 23:45:11 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter. It's another step in an inevitable sea change. How far isn't as important as the fact that it's an actual step.

Buffalo,3460sf,just_robot_things,4,Tue Apr 28 16:07:37 2015 UTC,"Are you into going to concerts or seeing bands? Buffalo has great music scene with shows going down almost every night (especially punk and indie bands). It's probably the main way to meet new people here (if you aren't really into sports or whatever). The city is just big enough where you can be familiar with a lot of people but still not meet everyone. Last call is 4 am and there is a whole lot of ""punk""/diy houses that throw big house parties every weekend with bands playing. I would say that it's one of the main things to do at night for people in your age group (especially when it's in the middle of winter, in my experience more people actually try to get together in the winter over than the summer). You don't have to fit the part, you can be nerdy as all hell and still fit in with everyone. A whole lot of people in Buffalo play Magick along with Dungeons and Dragons.  As far as nerd culture goes, there is UB Con every year (which just passed actually) at the University of Buffalo North Campus. It's pretty cool but not as huge as other conventions, it also mostly focuses on gaming, anime and cosplaying. Not so much on fantasy, sci-fi or comics but they are represented decently. Right across the border, over in Canada is both the Comic Con in Niagara Falls, Ontario and the Fan Expo in Toronto. They are pretty much the same thing, the Fan Expo is ran by the Comic Con people, it started first and is a little bit bigger because of it being located in a major city. The Niagara Falls Comic Con is smaller but is way better for people from out of town since Niagara Falls, Ont already has such a built in tourism market. I have no idea why they have such similar events so close to each other but it's pretty awesome if you are a local.  http://fanexpocanada.com/  http://niagarafallscomiccon.com/  I can't speak so much for the Buffalo airport, I have always understood it as handling shorter flights with layovers. Everyone I know flies out of the Toronto airport whenever they have to go long distance (to the West Coast, Europe, South America or Asia). Either way it's not that far away and it's only a minor inconvenience crossing the border.   People regularly take trips out to Niagara Falls, Ontario or Toronto. The Ontario side of the Falls is like Canada's Orlando and Las Vegas smashed together. Clifton Hill is loaded up with haunted houses, wax museums, Japanese style arcades and other cool stuff. A little farther past that is Lundy's Lane, which has most of the regions dirty stip clubs (if you are into that thing). Between Niagara Falls and Buffalo, there are four casinos located in the area (five if you count the one in Salamanca). There is always stuff going on with each side of the border so it's pretty common for people on either side to cross back and forth."

I'm headed to St Louis on Monday. My options are fly to NYC then St Louis, or drive 5+ hours to New York and pay to park for three days. I'll fly.   I know of at least one board game group and they seem to meet pretty frequently. There are cons in Niagara Falls and Toronto. Very much worth the drive. Which people do often.   I moved here in 99 and was divorced shortly afterward, still in my late twenties then. Never had a problem finding women. It helps that there are so many people that move here for college and end up staying.   You get used to dealing with the cold.

Buffalo,3460sf,Eudaimonics,3,Tue Apr 28 16:23:56 2015 UTC,"What is the geek/nerd culture like in Buffalo? Are there hacker or maker spaces around? Any sort of gaming/boardgaming culture or sci-fi/fantasy conventions that occur?   I know there are quite a few groups. They get advertised on /r/buffalo from time to time. As for Geek Culture there are quite a few shops around that host events. Then there is Niagara Falls Comic-con   How much does the weather affect the goings-on in the city and surrounding areas? Is it difficult to motivate friends to get together in the winter? How hard are the winters for those with SAD?   Nothing really closes for the snow. Snow removal is pretty good. Even during the worse winter storms, there will be places open. It can be a bit more difficult to get friends to go out depending on the weather, however, there is also a cabin fever effect which also makes it easier at times. Get into winter sports and this wont be an issue.   What's the dating scene like for those in their late 20s, early 30s? What do people do to meet new folks?   Pretty robust. Many of the city neighborhoods are filled with young people, so there is always the bar scene (though as you age you'll probably slowly stop going to bars for this reason). Join a co-ed amateur/beer sports league. Those are a ton of fun and a great way to meet new people. Buffalo's Tinder scene is pretty active too.   How often do people take trips up to Canada?    Pretty often, though everyone knows at least a few people who have never been over the border.  Niagara Falls, ON gives the region a lot of awesome unexpected amenities. Then Toronto is just a short drive away for their cultural scenes (though its pretty pricy).    Do people tend to fly out of the Buffalo airport, or do you drive to a bigger airport to reduce multi-leg flights? Is Buffalo a pretty expensive airport to fly from?   Almost never. Pittsburgh or Cleveland are not worth the 3.5 hour drives. Buffalo's airport offers enough flights to enough locations where its not too bad. Southwest and Jet Blue are nice airliners to have servicing the city.  The only time where you might want to travel to a different airport is for international flights. In that case Toronto's airport can be significantly cheaper. (Only fights to outside North America, flights within North America are so expensive, a lot of Canadians travel down to Buffalo's airport).  Other Things  You should really come and visit before you make a decision. See some of the sites and explore some of the neighborhoods like Elmwood or Allentown and make a decision for yourself.  Check out the nightlife, experience the great local food scene (both old and contemporary Buffalo). Buffalo is large enough where there is something always going on (just not an overwhelming amount). Lots of great gems in Buffalo leftover from when we were still a major city."
Buffalo,3460sf,Ebscer,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:01:19 2015 UTC,I love the odd relationship between the Buffalo and Toronto airports.  Flying to Europe?

Buffalo,3460sf,WorkAccount716,2,Wed Apr 29 17:04:52 2015 UTC,"I fly directly out of the Buffalo airport.  One example of weird flights would be if you are going to Chicago.  If you look on Expedia for roundtrip flights May 20 to May 27 there are some direct flights to Chicago but the others have a stop in odd places like Charlotte, Boston, or Philadelphia, places in the other direction."
Buffalo,3460sf,ProInvestCK,2,Tue Apr 28 16:32:53 2015 UTC,"Those would be the larger connecting hubs though right? It is odd to go the other direction but you could say it's the disadvantage of geography?  But if it's a connecting flight, you're going to connect in a hub and it just works out that it's located further east even though you're going west."
Buffalo,3460sf,Fudgeworth,2,Tue Apr 28 22:56:45 2015 UTC,Most likely hubs.  It makes sense from the airlines point of view to route people through hubs but from the customers perspective it's a pain as it makes 5 hours of travel time out of what otherwise would be a 2 hour direct flight.
Buffalo,3460sf,PoorAuthor9,2,Wed Apr 29 01:34:42 2015 UTC,"Hey, Buffalo is a great place to live. I was born and raised here and have loved it. Answering your questions:   Geek and nerd culture is pretty open and accessible here. UB has an active ""geek"" or nerd culture, and people from the public are always welcome to participate. There's definitely that community here that you can find if you look. Even outside of UB you can find it.  Weather is very big here. The winters are tough and long and snowy and cold. It depends on where you live, but if you want to do something, you usually can, and people are used to it, so they are down to do things even when the weathers bad. In Buffalo, we're used to the snow so like a foot of snow won't shut anything down. More true in the suburbs, the city can get a little congested in snow. The winters might be tough on people with SAD, but if you get out and do things, it shouldn't be too bad.  The dating scene is good - there's lots of people in that age range in Buffalo. getting involved in the nerd culture would get you to meet people. In addition, maybe considering renting a house with people. Buffalo's youth community is built on bars and clubs so there is always an opportunity to get involved with that if you meet a few people.  Going to Canada depends. Niagara Falls is less than half an hour away. If you want to cross the border, it's as easy as taking your enhanced license or passport and walking across the bridge. Some people with family in Canada go every weekend, some people just go when there's concerts in Toronto or whatever else. It's really up to you. Very easy to go to Canada.  I've always flown out of Buffalo. Most of the northeast is accessible from buffalo, but the rest you can connect. It isn't expensive.   Anyways, if you do come to Buffalo, please PM me. I have some friends that are involved with the geek/nerd culture in Buffalo that are around your age and would be happy to meet you. One in particular is really nice and a girl and she'd be more than glad to help you get involved in the community. Also, we always need people to play Settlers of Catan, haha."
Buffalo,3460sf,TOMALTACH,4,Wed Apr 29 22:50:57 2015 UTC,"What is the geek/nerd culture like in> Buffalo? Are there hacker or maker spaces around? Any sort of gaming/boardgaming culture or sci-fi/fantasy conventions that occur?     there are groups I'm sure. definitely there are people who play board games at bars and cafes. you can find LAN groups around.  check out massivelan if they still exist. UB hosts a ubCon every year, i think. Comicon is hitting up niagara falls this summer?  You can find almost anything to do for any interest group.  some may be small but they may exist. trivia at bars is a big thing.     How much does the weather affect the goings-on in the city and surrounding areas? Is it difficult to motivate friends to get together in the winter? How hard are the winters for those with SAD?     it really depends on the individual.  If you're a fair weather person, you'll likely find yourself staying indoors during winter, maybe doing dinner nights with friends, having board game nights, cards against hummanity, poker or whatever floats your boat.  A couple sixers of beer or bottles of wine ought to hold you over while the storm blows over. To really enjoy Buffalo all around, you'll need to embrace the winters, learn to go out and enjoy the elements no matter what is thrown at you.  All my friends play hockey, fish and ski, so we're all out there all the time, no matter what falls from the sky. for an individual with seasonal affective disorder, it could probably hit you hard IF you don't learn to enjoy the little things that comes with a good snow fall ie; walking on the super quiet streets, snowshoeing, xcountry skiing in the parks, snowboarding/skiing, attending winter festivals, hockey games, etc.       What's the dating scene like for those in their late 20s, early 30s? What do people do to meet new folks? I'd be moving there by myself and I'm not always great at getting out of the house, but I'd like to meet people and not be so lonely.     dating and meeting people is tough, anywhere you go alone. meeting people is very easy here.  there's always some event going on, people are quite friendly.  best ways to meet people are to go outside your bounds to activities, meetups (meetup.com), concerts, festivals, and generally any bar really.       How often do people take trips up to Canada?     again depends on the individual. some people go very frequently. it is not as though you can only cross so many times.  Some years, I personally am there every weekend.  There's quite a bit to do in canada from camping to visiting toronto for festivals, shows and concerts.      Do people tend to fly out of the Buffalo airport, or do you drive to a bigger airport to reduce multi-leg flights? Is Buffalo a pretty expensive airport to fly from?      this seems a bit silly to ask. I surely wouldn't drive to pittsburgh or cleveland to go to NYC or anywhere else.  flights are relatively reasonable, but it really depends on the airline and where you're going.  Buffalo is a major hub for southwest and jetblue, so there are a fair number of direct flights to some places. it does see its fair share of traffic in a typical high traffic fly day.  I have never been on any trip that was more than one stop in another hub when flying out of buffalo.   If anything, people may be more likely drive to short distance locations such as pittsburgh, cleveland, philadelphia, nyc, washington dc, etc.   only time driving and flying out of a different hub has ever really been beneficial has been with international travel, going out of toronto."

Buffalo,3448cz,redwing634,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:53:21 2015 UTC,"The problem with indoor soccer in Buffalo is, we don't have a venue for it. FNC is way to large to open for games. Rochester's team, the Lancers, draw 12k or so per game. Other teams in the league draw as little as 500. League stability is questionable at this point."
Buffalo,3448cz,bchiarmonte,2,Tue Apr 28 14:30:23 2015 UTC,I think it all depends on the league itself and marketing efforts.  The Bandits do very well despite being a team for a niche sport.  It would be cool if Buffalo had some sort of soccer complex though.
Buffalo,3448cz,TOMALTACH,2,Tue Apr 28 14:35:26 2015 UTC,what if it were to appeal to first niagara arena to get the necessary equipment to play indoor soccer on the ice there?
Buffalo,3448cz,nonethewiser,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:42:25 2015 UTC,The material cost for that equipment is likely less than the facility cost for hosting a single game.
Buffalo,3448cz,bchiarmonte,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:00:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly. They most likely still have the nets and topper boards around in a store room someplace. Could use the same turn the bandits use, just replace the center section with the team logo."

Buffalo,3448cz,Bezzie,2,Tue Apr 28 17:35:24 2015 UTC,"We attend games because my son likes the dance to the music and cheer and have fun.  Although, my wife's cousins love lacrosse, so they attend Knighthawks games frequently.  (They're from Rochester).

Buffalo,3448cz,a_jackson_federalist,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:27:02 2015 UTC,Definitely! That's why the Bison's are so popular too. Much more casual and relaxed atmosphere than a Sabres or Bills game.  FC Buffalo has a lot of potential in this regard too if they even get a permanent location.

In 1970 Buffalo was still a top 20 metro with 1.3 million residents, making it a major city still.   In 2015 we have 1.15 million residents but are now the 50th largest metro.  Buffalo's market can handle a lot more that what people assume by our current rank.  Then you have another 400,000 that would be in Buffalo's metro if there wasn't a border, but that's a different story.  Also, Soccer runs at a different time of the year than football and hockey. There is a lot of value to that."

Buffalo,3448cz,bchiarmonte,2,Tue Apr 28 23:46:56 2015 UTC,Well obviously there are much more lucrative markets. Buffalo however could support a 18k stadium (or really just the FNC) for an MLS team.  Buffalo does have a good size soccer community. We actually have our own region wide amateur soccer league with 70 teams. Look into the Buffalo & District Soccer League (BDSL)
Buffalo,3448cz,LeJourLeFroid,0,Tue Apr 28 23:59:05 2015 UTC,"It depends what you mean by support. Sure, there's probably room for an owner to make money off an MLS team in Buffalo. But a big reason why that's the case is because the MLS is keeping the cost of owning teams very low at the moment.  But, the MLS knows it has a product that will get big. Likewise, the MLS is not bounded by tradition as it looks to monetize it's product like the other leagues are. There's simply know reason for the MLS to consider putting a team in Buffalo, where just as the Bills and Sabres, it would rely on profit sharing and hard caps to survive."

The old one was not in the least creative, and was a copy of the Richardsonian Romanesque that was popular during the time, not even an actual Richardson building, and a bad copy at that.  Richardson designed useful spaces, and not really designed for a look.  The old building was designed merely to look like it was a Richardsonian, without any of the key principles in design.  So, if it's creativity you're looking for, you got it with the new building.  The old one was the equivalent of the spate of Rite-Aidian architecture we have in our region today.  It was poorly laid out, grossly inefficient in energy and space utilization, destroyed the Parisian layout of the roads, and failed to offer any of the features required for a library building itself."

Come over, experience the city.  you shouldn't limit yourself all because of some commonly shared stereotypes.  When you dine out, be sure to tip at least 10% though. I think that is the most notorious regular characteristic shared by most canadiens.  At least tip accordingly based on your service and quality for food (presentation & tastefulness), even if service isn't great I wouldn't ever drop less than 10 15%, it'd have to be severely lacking (ie; terrible attentiveness, unfriendly, uncooperative, dirty dishware/tables/environment) to merit 8 10%.      When driving, stay to the right unless you need to pass or are passing vehicles on the left. Please don't slow down traffic creating a caravan in the left lanes, not all lanes are of equal ""use"".    If you're going to shop here. Please don't leave things behind in the lots. there are dumpsters in lots, or even better find salvation army dumpsters to leave those items behind. Feel like this behavior is lazy pity on the less fortunate of america. ""i'll leave this here, maybe someone less fortunate will pick it up and use it"".      any how. come over. don't pick a fight about the toronto maple leafs, ottawa senators, or the montreal canadiens - you will enjoy the city, culture, history, and locals greatly."
Buffalo,345c1d,TOMALTACH,2,Tue Apr 28 13:19:57 2015 UTC,I have no idea why most Canadians  are such poor drivers as in Ontario we receive literally TWO YEARS of extra training before we can attain our full drivers licence yet it still makes no difference. I know from experience and my driving is decent.   In terms of the low tipping behaviour yes it's pretty despicable. Lots of people just throw a toonie (two dollar coin) at our servers here and then get on their way.   Not a hockey fan so there's no issues there lol.
Buffalo,345c1d,LeJourLeFroid,2,Tue Apr 28 13:37:27 2015 UTC,"loads of cool stuff to do here.  and as /u/workaccount716 mentioned, most people can't really pick up on your canadian."
Buffalo,345c1d,Eudaimonics,2,Tue Apr 28 13:39:44 2015 UTC,Part of the reason is they don't know the roads as well.  No idea why they seem to be more apt to tailgate though.
Buffalo,345c1d,TOMALTACH,2,Tue Apr 28 15:11:54 2015 UTC,"ha. one would think if you don't know the roads well, or where you're going, you'd stay to the right."
Buffalo,345c1d,cdninbuffalo,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:44:31 2015 UTC,"The only issue is that sometimes the right lane becomes a right turn only lane (Elmwood and Forest, southbound). I've been forced to turn right a lot by sticking to the right lane, even when I wanted to go straight."
Buffalo,345c1d,TOMALTACH,2,Tue Apr 28 22:40:16 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean within reason on expressways & highways or multi-lane roads such as Delaware stay to the right. Intersections were lanes have specific purpose stay in those lanes if necessary, then again that doesn't stop people going straight thru turn only lanes, Washington Street from eagle to Tupper is bad with drivers doing that.  Then again the signage around here isn't exactly the best."
Buffalo,345c1d,TOMALTACH,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:02:08 2015 UTC,TWO YEARS of extra training    interesting. TIL
Buffalo,345c1d,cdninbuffalo,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:40:43 2015 UTC,Yep. We have to go through the G1 and then G2 classes and then we get our final licence. Silliest thing ever and clearly not very effective.
Buffalo,345c1d,ooppoop,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:47:16 2015 UTC,"I've pondered the same question myself, because in my experience, Canadians aren't bad drivers in general.   Here's my hypothesis.  I've driven in both NY state and Ontario (as well as other parts of the U.S.), and I've noticed that Buffalo drivers are more ""intuitive"" drivers in that they adapt better to different road conditions.  I think part of it has to do with the irregular roads in Buffalo. Due to historical reasons, a lot of roads here aren't laid out in a simple grid (many are triangular, e.g. Bidwell Park), there are lots of lanes that end suddenly, turning lanes that suddenly appear, traffic lights that you cannot see once you go past a certain point (Delaware and W Delavan), there's a lot of curving around (Scajaquada, Kenmore and Elmwood), and complex multi-lane intersections (Main and Humboldt Parkway).   Southern Ontario roads are way more regular and boring, so even G drivers, despite the extra 2 (sometimes more) years of licensing,  are thrown off when they come to Buffalo.   It isn't so much a U.S./Canada thing, but a Buffalo thing (due to historical reasons). When I was in NC, the roads were very regular (and very wide) and there were very few surprises."
Buffalo,345c1d,cdninbuffalo,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:39:02 2015 UTC,"triangular      Hah. Is that the technical term?  I think you mean radial.    Only a handful complicated intersections; main/Kensington/Humboldt, genesse/chippewa/Ellicott, um...maybe amherst/Tonawanda.       suddenly appear       It would behoove you to pay closer attention & look ahead past other vehicles for what is coming on the road if characteristics of the road are ""suddenly appearing"""
Buffalo,345c1d,ooppoop,1 point,Wed Apr 29 11:03:23 2015 UTC,"No I actually mean triangular in a local sense (not so much in a layout sense, but yes, radial in a larger sense since Buffalo streets extends out of a downtown epicenter). Ashland, Bidwell and W Delavan is an example.   I know what you mean, but sometimes when you're new and the roads are unfamiliar, it's not that easy. There isn't a lot of leeway -- in terms of distance -- to react either. I can think of many examples in the greater Buffalo area where lanes appear and disappear within a very short distance. There just isn't enough time to change lanes, at least not without being a little aggressive. Couple that with the heavy snow in the winter, things can get confusing pretty quickly.   I've gotten used to driving in Buffalo (it's part of my muscle memory now), but when I first moved here, I got thrown off a lot. I speak from my own experiences; your mileage may vary. My point is: there may be a reason why out-of-towners seem to drive so badly (Canadians being the most visible out-of-towners, but I bet that would be true for anyone not from around here)."

Buffalo,345c1d,cdninbuffalo,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:28:53 2015 UTC,"A lot of my near accidents with Canadians involve them doing really stupid things that don't involve road structure.  Cutting across 3 lanes of traffic from the leftmost lane to take an exit, wandering/changing lanes without a blinker or room, and the age old ""I don't know where I'm going so I'm going to make you pay for it"" type maneuvers, etc.  And the same goes for my experience driving in the Clifton Hill area, I realize that it's hectic there but it's as if people just don't care.  I just think it's noticed more than the Americans because of the plates.  And I live near the Galleria, so that extremely increases my chances lol."
Buffalo,345c1d,immelbatoast,1 point,Fri May 1 02:01:35 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I can see how that might be the case.   I'm just wary of over-generalizations about the drivers of an entire country being bad -- especially when I don't see any strong evidence of it in most of Ontario. It's an easy trope that everyone repeats, but never stops to think about how true it is or how localized an experience it might be. But living close to Galleria mall, I'm sure your observation sample size of bad Canadian driving is much larger than mine, so I take your point.   Thanks for providing data points."
Buffalo,345c1d,Sudsnbuds,1 point,Fri May 1 02:16:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, totally get your point.  Like I said, I think you just notice an Ontario plate more than a NY one, so even though you encounter bad NY drivers daily, when you think back to all the Canadian plates you've seen, you tend to remember the most memorable encounters.  Plus, I'm convinced the Canadians that come here to shop all the time are pseudo-Canadians, because I've encountered a lot of rude ones...which is so unlike Canada in general that I have to convince my out-of-state friends they can indeed be rude LOL."

If you know what type of housing you're looking for and price range you could take a spin through different areas/neighborhoods.    I assume you like BBQ from living in Memphis/Nashville/South Carolina.  Check out Dinosaur BBQ or another place like Fat Bobs or Kentucky Gregs.
Buffalo,342rnv,monsieurvampy,4,Mon Apr 27 23:33:50 2015 UTC,"How's the music and the culture and the food and nature and all of that?? I'm used to a good supportive local community, great music, stuff always going on, farmers markets etc...   Since you addressed this to me specifically (what?) I'll add what I can.  Music culture is pretty good, depending on what style music you like, but regardless it's not nashville or Austin but we have a lot of good local bands and a lot stop here from or to Toronto/NYC/Cleveland/Pitt  We also have a near unlimited amount of free concerts in various places, usually very decent bands. Plus a lot of paid outdoor shows.  Food, If you don't like the food, get out!!! Sort of kidding but we take our food serious. Don't dare use Ranch with Wings (yes not Buffalo Wings duh) instead of Blue Cheese.  Farmers Markets are on the upswing, at least in the City. If you don't mind driving a little you can find plenty of choices already.  Stuff is always going on, sometimes you need to search a bit, but I rarely am bored.   Winter has tons of ice skating and hockey (to watch or join), curling, etc. (we're half Canadian don't forget)  Summer is pretty great, it gets plenty warm but not unbearable like some southern places. I can't even begin to list the summer activities but there are plenty of opportunities to drink, eat, play outdoors, chill inside, or whatever.  Keep in mind the City is around 1/4 million, and a mill in the County, but it was built to have a million in the city, so we have a bit of excess of highways which means you can get nearly anywhere in 20 minutes. If you live in the City 20 minutes can get you to Niagara Falls, or head South to Chestnut Ridge (Eternal Flame!), or 20 minutes East and you're in Rural area, plenty of fresh fruit, veggies, and milk."

Spend as much time at Canalside, Broderick Island (when they re-open it) and LaSalle park as possible during that time. It is heaven.  There's great neighborhoods like Elmwood Village and Allentown that are wonderful to spend a beautiful weekend in. I would say those and parts of the West Side (between Grant and Richmond, Virginia and Porter that are east of Niagara) are the best places to live. EV/Allen have the music, festivals, and markets you'll be looking for.  It'll be a culture shock but I am sure you will do just fine. Welcome!"

Buffalo,342rnv,alongstrangetrip,2,Tue Apr 28 00:26:41 2015 UTC,Southerner here originally from a small coastal town in NC.  Buffalo-Niagara is a great place to live.  I prefer the country but I know lots here enjoy a more urban lifestyle.    I enjoy these northern winters loads more than my rainy 40 degree southern winters.  Pick up a winter sport!  I picked up pond hockey and skiing (local slopes are less than an hour away; multiple options!)  Get outside and cycle.  Buffalo embraces cycling like none other.  The local apples here are some of the best.  I prefer Senek farms and/or Tom Towers (Ransomville/Youngstown area).   Access to Canada is perfect for quick weekend trips when itching for a new experience.  One of my new favorite places to visit is the Georgia Bay.  I love hiking and kayaking in the wilderness up there.   I can't really speak too much on the city mainly because I'm not really an urban kind of guy.  I just enjoy cycling the city and going to Bisons games.  Maybe I'm too simple. Haha.  Cheers!

But the sprouting of new growth that is taking place is very cool and cheering. I'll echo that summer is wonderful. Speaking of sprouting, the Buffalo Garden Walk in July blew me away when I first attended... 350+ gardens on tour. City of Night at Silo City is a funky arts happening that truly could only happen here. Canalside in summer, watching sailboats come into the harbor. The city is finally learning to party in winter too. But more important I love that everyone is friendly. I was talking to a homeowner during the garden tour and the next thing I know I'm getting tours of gardens that weren't even on the tour. I agree with the suggestion of visiting for a week if you can. Feel the vibe and see if it fits."

For new apartments in an downtown area, Buffalo is actually still pretty cheap compared to other cities.  Sure, there are much cheaper options but as I said, these places are old and often have not been updated in 20 years.  As for groceries, they want a grocery store for a new development near the bus terminal. Right now downtown needs to still work on gaining population. As population grows, so will shopping options.

Buffalo,33wteu,LeJourLeFroid,2,Tue Apr 28 23:03:07 2015 UTC,"I'm quite interested in this trend as I prepare to possibly make a move to Buffao (assuming I can find an appropriate job).  Coming from the greater NYC, I am already starting to see my peers (the eldest within the millennial generation) make a move from within NYC towards to suburbs as they start to have kids and are thinking of schools.    As I think about the greater Buffalo area, I'm thinking that all the younger people who are going into apartments now will eventually have kids and think about school at that point as well.  And if they want to go the public route they will probably want to be in the better school districts of the suburbs speaking very generally here.  In Manhattan, of all my friends staying in the city, just about all are paying to put their kids in private schools.  NYC is a beast of it's own though.  In Buffalo however, when the time would come, I don't understand as much why someone would want to pay rent with nothing to show for the expense in the end, and on top of that, pay additionally for private schools.  Especially I see more people being more budget conscious in this area.  Although that might start to be hard to say when people start paying 2-3K for rent.  Maybe because it's something new and something the Buffalo area has not seen for a long time that people are willing to spend more on such a living set up, and possibly pay more than they would have otherwise on rental expenses.  The younger generation, at least for now, I really see moving to the suburbs after the party is over in the city.  For older generations who are downsizing, this might be a great opportunity for those who can afford the rental expense now.  Might be even better should rental prices come down in the future.  Prices are a function of supply and demand of course.  In the comments I've really only heard about the demand.  But the supply side could bring prices down.  I don't know what the profit margins are for the developers but if the margins are good, I would only expect more developers try to get in on the action and increase supply.  As long as the margins are better than they'd get on any other kind of development then they'll continue building."

Biggest factor for me currently is finding the appropriate job as I work in kind of a niche sector of finance right now.  Doing research on what types of positions exist in buffalo that I could transfer my skills to and of course you want a role that makes sense, fits within your overall planned career path."
Buffalo,33wteu,ProInvestCK,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:23:13 2015 UTC,These companies would probably make more money if they were to buy a bunch of houses outside of downtown and fix up the insides to rent $600-$1000/month apartments.  Looking for an apartment that isn't in a shitty apartment complex is annoying.
Buffalo,33wteu,RhoBautRawk,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:37:19 2015 UTC,$3000 a month for a loft? Better be made of gold that you get to take with you when you leave. What an outrageous amount for a rental
Buffalo,33wteu,ReverendBass,2,Sun Apr 26 17:34:59 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing the actual amount of people doing this is very low.  Most new apartments are going for $1200-1500 per month. So affordable for those making $40,000+ if we go by the 25% rule."
Buffalo,33wteu,Eudaimonics,4,Sun Apr 26 20:22:42 2015 UTC,I make more than that and I wouldn't say $12-1500 is affordable for me. I am debt free too. I also like beer
Buffalo,33wteu,ReverendBass,0,Sun Apr 26 21:12:45 2015 UTC,"That figure is not realistic. The only time I've seen rents that high for a five-or-six bedroom house. The priciest lofts are $2000, at most."

Buffalo,33vtw8,bencub91,5,Sun Apr 26 02:55:01 2015 UTC,I like the  different options there but I thought that the gravy was a little bland.
Buffalo,33vtw8,roi_lorenz,2,Sun Apr 26 14:33:04 2015 UTC,"The gravy was really bad.  We talked to the owners and they were really proud of their slow-roasted bone broth artisinal gravy.  Unfortunately, poutine is drunk-food and really needs to have some thin, salty, institutional type gravy on it.  Plus, mine was really cold.  I ordered original and my husband ordered some kind with meat.  I think they made mine then let it sit there until his was ready.  Ass-backwards.  They were also out of a lot of stuff.  I remember for sure they were out of the Montreal-style toppings, since that's what I tried to order.  I'd go back to give them another chance.  If it still stinks after they have been open a few months, I won't waste the time/money/calories.  Smoke's Poutinerie in St. Kitts isn't too bad of a drive for good poutine."
Buffalo,33vtw8,trenper,6,Mon Apr 27 03:26:52 2015 UTC,It was alright. The Melting Point next door is much much better IMO.

They're so good that I'd rather not have them drenched with the okay to mediocre stuff (usually of conflicting temperatures and textures) on top of 'em.    Maybe I'm just not ""getting"" the poutine.  I dunno.  I guess the end product is okay."
Buffalo,33vtw8,Vhrix,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:31:35 2015 UTC,"Yea. It's pretty good. Wasn't super impressed. Different cheese options would be nice.  I do like their inventiveness with different ""styles"". Taps in Niagara Falls has much better poutine in my opinion."

Last weekend I tried the new burger place on Allen, I was impressed until the check came. 17$ for a burger is steep, Colter Bay a block away is half the price and similar quality."
Buffalo,33vtw8,Richisnormal,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:14:15 2015 UTC,"While the sandwiches are bit overpriced, You're not going to get a solid tuna steak ""burger"" at Colter, best sandwich imo at abv.  Even the salmon is differently delicious. Colter Bay is generic compared to abv. Then again abv has you pay for its inventiveness.      I wouldnt go out of my way for abv, but it's a good place to pop into once in awhile."
Buffalo,33vtw8,TOMALTACH,3,Sun Apr 26 19:51:33 2015 UTC,"Thursdays after 4pm Colter Bay does $5 burgers w/ either fries, tater tots, sweet potato fries and maybe one more option (tots are where it's at).   For $5 it may be the best burger deal in town. And while it may not be a stand out burger, it's decent.   You can order any burger on their menu, my fav is the Frontiersman."

Buffalo,33vtw8,liq456,1 point,Mon Apr 27 02:42:09 2015 UTC,"I've eaten there a handful of times and I've probably tasted about half the items on the menu.   I think it's pretty good, not like mind-blowingly good, but good. I don't think any one type stood out as the best to me.   I wish they'd do small orders like the Poutine place in the Galleria Mall. The portions at Allen St Poutine are pretty big imo, I'd def like the option to order a smaller size for a few bucks less. Specialty poutine there runs about $9, and I think traditional poutine is like $7.  I think they really nailed the vibe there though. Being able to draw on the walls is fun, and I'm a huge fan of the big Allen St Poutine sign they hung up.   I bet they'll be around for a while, it's usually pretty busy on there. A welcomed addition to the hood for sure."

I was never active in the local community, but CS in general seems to be in decline (see, for example, a lot of griping on /r/couchsurfing).  It's been kind of a perfect storm of changes to the site and how it's run, a rush of cheap people who want free places to stay but have no interest in actually participating/hosting, and some people dropping out to airBNB instead."
Buffalo,33wd1x,itwentok,1 point,Sun Apr 26 21:00:21 2015 UTC,Probably migrated to airBNB once people realized they could make some money off of couch surfers (still ridiculously cheap though).
Buffalo,33wd1x,Eudaimonics,0,Sun Apr 26 16:00:19 2015 UTC,$40 / night isn't exceedingly cheap. We need more rooms to push the market down further.
Buffalo,33wd1x,TheSelfGoverned,3,Sun Apr 26 17:14:43 2015 UTC,"$40 a night isn't cheap? You're joking, right? It's as cheap as a hostel"
Buffalo,33wd1x,ReverendBass,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:39:51 2015 UTC,"$40 is rediculous cheap. Especially if its for an entire well kept apartment in a central location.  Also, while there is a certain appeal to couch surfing, there is a lot more privacy with airBNB."
Buffalo,33wd1x,Eudaimonics,2,Sun Apr 26 20:30:45 2015 UTC,"It is usually a bedroom, not a full apartment, and normal budget hotel rooms are in the $40-60 range."

Buffalo,33v2zu,Fudgeworth,10,Sat Apr 25 22:25:51 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, horrible drivers are everywhere. There's nothing more than the volume of people on Elmwood making it seem like there are horrible drivers just there."
Buffalo,33v2zu,bkdrummer,8,Sat Apr 25 22:33:06 2015 UTC,"I think it has to do with the volume of people, plus the fact that a lot of people who don't live in the area go there to visit, and don't know how to navigate traffic, parking, etc. Downtown gets like that too when there's a game or event going on."
Buffalo,33v2zu,mysteriousG,6,Sat Apr 25 23:11:27 2015 UTC,"I can sort of sympathize with the second to last point. If someone stops to make a left, you don't always have full vision around them or behind you. I'll just wait once in a while so I don't run over a biker or run into a car also making a left from the opposite side."
Buffalo,33v2zu,Strictly_Commercial,3,Sun Apr 26 01:55:52 2015 UTC,I agree. Is it even technically legal to pass on the right? Or is that more of a turning/ parking lane?
Buffalo,33v2zu,ikedavis,4,Sun Apr 26 02:24:23 2015 UTC,I'm not sure. I have gone around people before with cops right there and it's been fine. I just don't always go around if I cant get a clear look ahead of the car or behind me.
Buffalo,33v2zu,Strictly_Commercial,2,Sun Apr 26 02:38:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Passing on the right when a vehicle is trying to make a left hand turn is such a bad idea.    Maybe I'm a horrible driver, but I usually just remain patient and wait it out.    Hell, I think i may have been that guy waiting it out when the light turned red. Haha.  OP were you the driver in the Subaru forester who was riding me the whole way down Elmwood?!"
Buffalo,33v2zu,BingoBanjoBongo,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:33:40 2015 UTC,LOL.  I don't have a Subaru.  I can't remember the specific intersection but there was plenty of room to go around it.  It wasn't a busy stretch of Elmwood where there are lots of pedestrians and parked cars.

In fact, I haven't even found Elmwood to be as bad as other places, probably because it's too busy for people to get enough speed to do any real damage. Other cities I've driven in (NYC, Seattle, Rochester, Toronto) don't seem quite as bad, but that's probably because I haven't spent much time there.  Far worse than British roads, though. The level of distracted, impatient arrogance is astonishing here."
Buffalo,33v2zu,Sweethomebflo,3,Sun Apr 26 03:12:37 2015 UTC,What I'm really tired of are all the drivers making illegal left turns off of Delaware between Gates Circle and Allen.

People who dont know how to use specific lanes, yield & merge at on ramps such as 198/33 interchange from main/Humboldt are just as horrible.     The problem would be easily fixed if meter maids were assigned to issue traffic & moving violations along with their regular parking ticket duties. I'll encounter at least two dozen people between my morning & afternoon commute from downtown to north Buffalo who ought to be receiving citations, from shit as simple as failing to stop at stop signs & for school busses to blocking the road.      What's the difference between the west side & East side? Stop signs are optional in the east."

Buffalo,33p65n,bflo666,2,Fri Apr 24 14:43:20 2015 UTC,I don't think an airport line is such a necessity because it's such a direct shot down 33 from downtown that taxi aren't that outrageous to depend on.
Buffalo,33p65n,a_jackson_federalist,3,Sat Apr 25 15:27:59 2015 UTC,"Taxis are expensive. Affordable for people on business, but not always otherwise.  There are a lot of business parks around the airport as well, making it easier for people to do the reverse commute or commute at all considering the line passes through the Eastside which has a large carless population.  Then you have the benefit of connecting downtown hotels, restaurants and attractions with the galleria, promoting Canadian tourists to actually spend time and money in the city."
Buffalo,33p65n,Eudaimonics,1 point,Sat Apr 25 15:59:46 2015 UTC,"I won't argue on taxi prices, but in all honesty and in a perfect world there should be a direct mass transit option from the airport to the city center. Look, New York managed to fabricate a connection from JFK to Jamaica LIRR station using airspace over an existing highway, why not here? Sure, money played a part, but the majority of the NFTA's legacy railbeds have already been partially developed.   Nobody says that route has to accommodate the light rail cars that run in everyday service, just a car that can run on the same rail gauge. A development plan that just connected the airport with downtown on a dedicated service is the way to go."

Buffalo,33p65n,Stalking_Goat,7,Fri Apr 24 12:20:21 2015 UTC,"It’s possible that someday in the not-too-distant future, Buffalo Sabres fans bound for First Niagara Center could get off Metro Rail trains at a redeveloped Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad Terminal just across the street.  Escalators would take them to the second floor of a vast, bustling terminal with shops and restaurants, where they would cross a skywalk into the arena.  Looking even further into the future, a short Metro Rail extension close to South Park Avenue could provide service to a new Buffalo Bills stadium that now appears on conceptual maps.  The explosion of development around Canalside and the Cobblestone District prompted the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority to commission a study on how the agency should respond.  If the area is to continue to expand, the study concludes, so too must public transportation.  “The need to extend service beyond the DL&W will be required,” said Thomas George, NFTA director of surface transportation. “If one of those opportunities is created, we don’t want to be caught flat-footed.”  Millions of dollars would be needed, and Metro Rail extension optimistically lies three to five years ahead, but rail access opens opportunities for the authority-owned DL&W terminal, NFTA Executive Director Kimberley A. Minkel said.  What’s more, it is hoped the transit expansion will encourage developers already expressing interest in the Cobblestone and Canalside areas.  “We are studying how to get to the other side of the DL&W, open up that area and open rail for future expansion,” she said.  The $300,000 transit study conducted by Parsons Brinckerhoff surveyed “stakeholders,” such as many of the developers active in the area, the City of Buffalo, Erie Canal Harbor Development Corp., the state Department of Transportation and the Sabres.  The study presented five alternatives for serving the arena neighborhood, but three were discarded because of cost or interference with traffic on South Park Avenue or with Metro Rail operations at its rail yard and shops on the DL&W’s ground floor.  The authority and its consultants settled on two alternatives as worthy of continued study.  One involves a new station on the DL&W’s downtown edge alongside South Park that would minimally affect vehicle and rail traffic.  Another routes Metro trains along the DL&W’s ground floor on the Buffalo River side, where stairs and escalators could connect passengers to any new development on the second floor and possibly to the arena.  It also concludes that Metro Rail’s current Erie Canal Harbor Station – while serving the immediate area well – fails to provide all that will be needed for future development farther down the Metro tracks.  The study examines the entire area, including how to better serve Canalside and how to attract Amtrak passengers from the Exchange Street Station.  Officials of the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus proposed a similar plan in 2013 that would involve a Metro Rail extension through the DL&W to a privately built parking garage and transit hub in the Old First Ward. The idea was to serve Southtowns commuters working at the burgeoning Medical Campus.  But NFTA officials say their study involves only existing trackage to Michigan Avenue and does not take into account a short stretch of railroad right-of-way the authority owns south of Michigan.  Minkel said that the possibility of a new Bills stadium in the area did not precipitate the new study as much as the accelerated pace of development at Canalside and the Cobblestone District. But she noted the NFTA was included in stadium studies commissioned by New York State. A public transportation component of any downtown stadium is considered crucial.  But the underused DL&W also lies at the heart of the NFTA study, she noted, calling it “ripe for transit-oriented development.”  Developer Rocco R. Termini, who in the past has expressed interest in redeveloping the old terminal but has also questioned the NFTA’s stewardship, was not surveyed as part of the study.  He said transit would not provide the needed catalyst for the facility as much as the surge of development in the area.  “The reason for development is what’s happening on the periphery,” he said, pointing to the flood of visitors to Canalside this past winter.  Still, Minkel said the NFTA remains excited about at least studying the potential for a relatively short Metro Rail extension that could provide significant benefits.  While the authority is also studying a much more extensive rail expansion from University Station into Amherst, she said the downtown effort remains separate. Both will compete for a limited amount of federal funds available for new starts around the nation, she said, but the authority feels confident enough about the initial data collected to continue the process.  Now, Minkel said, the authority will work toward adopting a preferred alternative later this year and identifying other considerations, such as cost and environmental factors. If the authority decides to continue pursuing the idea, Minkel said it will then enter the “federal process” that could result in Washington money for the project in the years ahead.  “The only thing we’re committed to now is completing the study,” George said.  One of the disqualified proposals was a plan to elevate trains onto the second floor of the DL&W, which still features boarding platforms for passenger trains. Though the existing infrastructure there might prove ideal for Metro Rail trains, Minkel said the additional $40 million to $50 million needed for support structures nixed the idea.  Ditto for ideas to route trains directly through DL&W’s ground floor, or to build a station in the middle of South Park Avenue near the facility – mainly because of the effect on automobile and rail traffic.  Assemblyman Sean M. Ryan, D-Buffalo, on Thursday praised the NFTA for preparing for the future needs of the burgeoning Canalside and Cobblestone areas. He also said the authority is correctly recognizing the potential of the DL&W terminal.  “It’s a great example of how the NFTA is becoming a forward-looking organization,” he said. “We need the NFTA to take a seat at the table in the rebirth of Buffalo.”"

Buffalo,33ptja,buffalo442,-6,Fri Apr 24 15:54:53 2015 UTC,"woah, I didnt get a ticket first off and also im sure all of use UB students care to read these PSA's."
Buffalo,33ptja,buffalo442,8,Fri Apr 24 16:13:54 2015 UTC,"If you have to read a news release to wear a seat belt, you deserve a fine."
Buffalo,33ptja,Straxthepotatoe,-4,Fri Apr 24 22:09:40 2015 UTC,simply do the same thing and dont write these tickets. solution is simple as that. Record the students that arent wearing seat belts and ticket them the next time around if you want revenue.
Buffalo,33ptja,flancresty,4,Fri Apr 24 16:20:18 2015 UTC,"So, let them get off the first time, and don't catch them the second? What if they drive different cars the second time and just get more ""warnings""?"
Buffalo,33ptja,flancresty,10,Sat Apr 25 14:28:44 2015 UTC,Where is your evidence that the students are paying for the police? Most campus police are funded primarily by US Dept. of Justice and US Dept. of Education grants.
Buffalo,33ptja,marlovious,-6,Fri Apr 24 16:18:23 2015 UTC,"These are university police with UB all over them. I can only assume that the students pay for this ""protection"" through these tickets and tuition. Where do you think this ticket revenue goes?"
Buffalo,33ptja,ooppoop,9,Fri Apr 24 16:22:20 2015 UTC,"You assumption is wrong. Maybe read the words I wrote instead of just repeating the mistaken claim. As others have noted, writing the number of tickets it would take to fund even a fraction of the force would be very difficult to achieve, just from a human productivity standpoint."
Buffalo,33ptja,a_jackson_federalist,9,Fri Apr 24 16:33:00 2015 UTC,Never mind the fact that any tickets written would be handled by the local court (Amherst) which doesn't fund the UB police.

Buffalo,33ptja,a_jackson_federalist,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:58:04 2015 UTC,"I'm actually kind of curious about that. Do students have the ability to have a seat belt ticket or any other driving citation handled by the student wide judiciary? Also, I wouldn't be shocked if a portion of the ticket revenue from UB's campus do funnel back to UBPD. This would actually be an interesting thing for someone to look into."
Buffalo,33ptja,Yellowed,3,Sat Apr 25 15:24:31 2015 UTC,"Also, I wouldn't be shocked if a portion of the ticket revenue from UB's campus do funnel back to UBPD.   Not directly I wouldn't think. It's like getting a ticket on the thruway by a trooper. You have to appear at the local court depending in which jurisdiction you are pulled over. You can plead quilty and pay the state or plead down to local parking tickets where any revenue goes to the town. This is why so many tickets get plead down."
Buffalo,33ptja,spk6361,4,Sat Apr 25 21:20:40 2015 UTC,"SUNY police, which can be found on any SUNY campus, are a branch of the State Troopers. You do pay for them through your taxes, and I'm sure that a portion of your tuition goes towards campus safety, and some of that money likely goes towards helping fund the UBPD. Without a doubt, UBPD has ticket quotas, just as any police department has. While I'm not a fan of quotas, I am a huge fan of campus PD handing out seat belt tickets. It's such an easy law to follow, and so easy for them to catch you breaking. If they weren't pulling over every driver that they see without a seat belt who is driving on campus, I would say they're not doing their jobs."

University police have the same retirement and any normal state worker. Troopers are in their own category entirely. University police are more like a local municipality than anything else. They go through training just like buffalo, Amherst or west seneca. If they wanted to transfer to one of those they could. If they get hired by the troopers they have to get re trained for 6 months."

Campus police -- or any police -- are a law enforcement agency; their job is to be proactive when enforcing the law, and that includes writing tickets.  The FD is an emergency services agency, not a law enforcement one; that's why they don't drive around looking for fires . . ."
Buffalo,33ptja,augustca,5,Fri Apr 24 21:58:58 2015 UTC,"yeah, it's pretty transparent that they are doing it to gain renenue (like the BS $20 parking tickets you get when there's frost on your window covering your tag) but it's pretty easy to just not break the law in this situation. Putting a seatbelt on is not even a hassle and it certainly isn't worth $75"

Buffalo,33ptja,LonelyNixon,10,Fri Apr 24 22:23:09 2015 UTC,"what's the purpose?   Wearing a seat belt as the driver of a moving vehicle is the law in New York State. If you are not wearing a seat belt, you are breaking the law and are therefore responsible of your action (or in this case, inaction). Seat belts save lives; I do not understand your argument."
Buffalo,33ptja,marlovious,2,Fri Apr 24 15:10:33 2015 UTC,Also in the event of an accident your dumb ass becomes a projectile that can hurt other people as well.
Buffalo,33ptja,ProInvestCK,-4,Fri Apr 24 15:24:23 2015 UTC,"by simply doing the same thing but not ticketing essientally has the same effect. The ticket just becomes revenue off of already greiving students. ""please buckle up your seat belt."" is simply all thats needed. Not a 75$+ fine....."
Buffalo,33ptja,Yellowed,7,Fri Apr 24 16:15:16 2015 UTC,"We all know you need to wear them to comply with the law, a sign isn't going to do anything especially with college kids. Some sort of disincentive is necessary."
Buffalo,33ptja,spk6361,2,Fri Apr 24 21:52:28 2015 UTC,"I dunno. Do you know how much a full time police officer makes? The cost of writing the occasional sub $100 ticket doubtfully makes up the difference.   UB just has stupid initiatives where they baby students. I've gotten little notes on my windshield evaluating my car in terms of security. Doors locked, nothing in view, and etc. Like I'm some naive idiot who doesn't know how to prevent putting a big ""PLEASE BREAK INTO MY CAR"" sign on my vehicle. The whole click it or ticket I think is genuinely a misguided attempt to force people to buckle up because otherwise people don't and it can cost them their lives, their projectile body somebody else's life, and if you aren't insured the government a lot of money in heath coverage.  I'd be more annoyed by the tickets if it wasn't something you should be doing anyway and if it wasn't so damn easy to avoid.  Maybe I'm a little more livid about the issue because I know people who've almost died because they weren't buckled up. But boohoo to your friends. Be glad it's a fine and not their lives."
Buffalo,33ptja,pete716,-4,Fri Apr 24 15:30:09 2015 UTC,well how else do you think they pay the for the excessive amount of police/ police vehicles? other than student tuition and ticketing students for things that dont necessarly seem ticket worthy?
Buffalo,33ptja,buffaloburley,3,Fri Apr 24 16:19:02 2015 UTC,And I'm guessing when (god forbid) you have an emergency and have to call campus police you would rather wait for state troopers/erie county sheriff/amherst police to respond?

Buffalo,33n402,LowItalian,2,Fri Apr 24 16:28:55 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't try to do letchworth and Zoar Valley in a day. I mean you could, but you could easily spend a day exploring just Zoar Valley. Not only that, but Zoar Valley has really fun kayaking/Rapids if you're into that.   Letchworth is really cool, but the trails there by the gorge are paved in places and you'll find tons of people. And most of that trail is within site of a road. So it doesn't feel like hiking through nature so much to me. Def worth checking out though, the falls are gorgeous.

There is actually a loop that runs about 5 miles starting/stopping at the eternal flame parking lot. It is a good hour hike with some climbs and stream crossings. It is maintained by the Boy Scouts with orange and blue markers on trees for clarity. The only section you have to watch out for is where the trail markers change colors.

A bunch of uptight stuffed shirts and that is not my style. Now don't get me wrong. I'm a people person, I'm a people pleaser, I hate nobody, I'm friends with everybody, all I want is to have a good time. And how better to engage people and bring them into my fold than a party? And now all I can think of is party. It has to happen and it has to happen this Christmas. And not one of their fuddy duddy parties with their Chopin and wine glasses and finger sandwiches, not that I don't like a good glass of wine on occasion, or a bit more than that you know what I mean, but something that blows the roof of the entire town. Something that will change them all. And who better to do it than me? Because I know people. I know how to talk to people, I know how to sing, dance, make them laugh, make them cry, I can do it all, I'm a real renaissance man. But what most people don't know is that a party at this level is a full time job. Sure you might see me around town and I'm doing groceries or running errands but in my mind, in my mind, the wheels are constantly spinning. Decorations, themes, what alcohol to buy, what food to get, what music to play because music is an essential part of every party and don't worry about the noise level, because I play it loud and play it proud, but you get music going, and all of a sudden, everyone is with you and having a great time.

Looking closely at the many photographs reveals buildings falling apart at the seams. In order to construct world's fairs at a quick pace, 95% of the buildings were constructed of wooden frames and chicken wire with a base coat of plaster! Each rainfall caused the buildings to decay more and more so you can imagine the dillema the directors of the Pan-American faced with the summer of 1901 being one of the wettest in Buffalo's history.   http://www.buffalohistoryworks.com/panamex/buildings/buildings.htm  I think one of the cooler things architecturally to come from the Pan am is the inspiration for the Electric Tower downtown.  http://www.buffalohistoryworks.com/panamex/buildings/etower2.jpg"

Buffalo,33isaa,maxwell7301,5,Wed Apr 22 23:12:12 2015 UTC,"Zoning board rejects storage facility at former Dash’s store BY: Susan Schulman  Published: April 22, 2015, 05:07 PM  Updated: April 22, 2015, 05:07 PM Plans to convert a former grocery store building on Kenmore Avenue into a self-storage facility were denied Wednesday by the Buffalo Zoning Board of Appeals, which said the proposal would change the nature of the neighborhood.  In a 3-0 vote, zoning board members said the retail commercial environment associated with the grocery store that operated at the site for decades would not continue if the building becomes a self-storage center.  In addition, board member Warren F. Glover said some in the neighborhood are uncomfortable with the “interim” aspects of the plan, and feel the current property owner, Joe Dash, has not been “up front” with the community over his plans for the building since purchasing it in 2013.  The decision came as a bit of a surprise since, earlier in the meeting, University Heights Councilman Rasheed N.C. Wyatt told the board that the University Heights Neighborhood Collaborative was pleased with some compromises made by the property owner, and voted to support the project.  Originally, Dash proposed an indoor and outdoor self-storage facility, but in the face of neighborhood opposition, the outdoor storage proposal was dropped. The current plans calls only for indoor storage, using the existing building. Dash would postpone any decision on what to do with the outdoor portion of the property until sometime in the future. Also, additional landscaping was included in the plan.  “The applicant worked closely with the community to create a development plan responsive to community concerns,” said Dash’s attorney, Corey A. Auerbach, of Damon Morey. “The applicant remains committed to bringing a productive redevelopment to the site and will work with the community and the city,” he added.  Dash purchased the former Budwey’s grocery store at 400 Kenmore Ave. in November 2013. His initial plan was to close his Hertel Avenue store and convert the Kenmore Avenue store into a Dash’s signature Market Side Cafe. But the Hertel Avenue community opposed the idea of their neighborhood store closing, and Dash decided to keep that store open. He then closed the Kenmore Avenue store."

Buffalo,33j4qg,RVAGOD,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:27:29 2015 UTC,"716 is cool to bring guests in from out of town, but IMO the place reeks of chain restaurant. The service has been awful the 5 times I've been there and the food is bad. The concept is cool for the city, but I'm not a fan."
Buffalo,33hyv2,TOMALTACH,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:50:29 2015 UTC,Anybody know Buffalo's FTPP (food truck per person) ratio?
Buffalo,33hyv2,InsrtBooze_EnjoyShow,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:41:52 2015 UTC,"Well there were 35 on the list (not including several from Rochester and Batavia).  So that is a ratio of 31,500:1 for the metro area.  Most of the trucks survive off of catering to businesses and large events throughout the region. Only a few - like Lloyds - can often be found regularly on the streets."
Buffalo,33hyv2,Eudaimonics,2,Thu Apr 23 22:03:42 2015 UTC,"Speaking of Lloyds, saw all the trucks in the lot behind shanghai bistro, is that their new kitchen spot? No longer at the first Presbyterian church at Symphony Circle?"

Buffalo,33guu5,granolamuncher,7,Wed Apr 22 12:37:00 2015 UTC,"You should ask him what places he knows well, then go to those places, where he will see how they have changed.  Ask him about those places when youre there, if he has any interesting stories that may be relevant to the changes he sees.  This is a huge way to view a place you have not been for a long time. show him the places you know he will see drastic change, ie driving on main street & riverworks.   aside from the above, the city hall observation deck and niagara falls are always choice spots. take him for a buffalo river tour, show him the outer harbor (gallagher pier, wilkeson point), visit silo city, if they're open - maybe go for a kayak tour at elevator alley. go find some food trucks to experience. show him Harbor Center (including Impact sports training[pros have even come in and said it's one of the best facilities they have ever exercised in), Canalside, & maybe grab a drink with him at 716 - check out what ever is on the 30' screen.  Enjoy a dog or drink at the renovated hatch.     There are newer sculptures at the Albright Knox Art Museum that are very interesting. loads of new restaurants.      maybe check out the Central Terminal and if the giant pile of snow has vanished yet?"

Everytime I go downtown or to the arena with my dad, who is nearing 60, he's always amazed by the progress.  He was the one who would take me around in the mid-90's and tell me that nothing was going to change.  He still lives here and hears about progress, but seeing is believing.  He wasn't negative on purpose like a BN commenter, but he saw it stuck in limbo for so long, that he just loves seeing the area with some life now."

Buffalo,33e6ha,LibrarySquidLeland,4,Wed Apr 22 01:52:21 2015 UTC,"Hasn't happened to me, but I know that Ricks has a reputation for buying stolen bikes.  I've heard of them buying bikes that they know they recently sold and returning them to their owners, but I've also heard of bikes disappearing into the basement never to be heard from again.  I think it depends on the employee who actually processes the transaction"
Buffalo,33e6ha,rutr0,4,Wed Apr 22 02:34:52 2015 UTC,I had a friend get a call from an employee at Rick's when someone came in to get a flat repair on a bike that was stolen from him 18 months prior. They keep their eye out for bikes that have been reported stolen on the various cycling related Facebook groups in town.
Buffalo,33e6ha,chemicalbro13,3,Wed Apr 22 11:50:55 2015 UTC,"I have been buying from ricks for years, both new and used stuff. I've also sold them bikes before and they have to take down all of your information so that if the bike is stolen they hand the paperwork over to the cops.  Idk if you have first hand experience with your bike being stolen and being there but if you have proof its yours they will give it to you.  Buffalo has a small bike community and they would never last if they were known for that."
Buffalo,33e6ha,ReverendBass,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:28:38 2015 UTC,There were stories on here where Ricks tried to get $$ from the person before giving the stolen bike back because they tuned it or something.

Buffalo,33e6ha,chemicalbro13,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:40:52 2015 UTC,I can kind of understand that side of the argument from them as their is no database for stolen bikes here.

Buffalo,33e6ha,Sabres00,2,Thu Apr 23 01:30:09 2015 UTC,Last year my bike got stolen then a few weeks later I saw a cop car with about 5 bikes in his trunk.  I didn't realize bikes were such a hot commodity.
Buffalo,33e6ha,cubosh,2,Wed Apr 22 13:10:47 2015 UTC,i have literally WATCHED some punk kids roll into ricks with like 3 bikes of completely various sizes/styles and sell them to ricks.  they just buy it up and throw it in the basement.  i dont know why because have you SEEN that basement? they are like hoarders. i cant imagine anything selling from down there

Buffalo,33cvzo,716in619,3,Tue Apr 21 17:06:14 2015 UTC,Main Place Mall is doing great actually.  They have become a hub for data centers since they are literally on top of a major hub of the internet.  I will say that it would be nice if they incorporated what stores they do have left with Main Street though. It is a very unwelcoming building.

Buffalo,33cvzo,dan_blather,1 point,Wed Apr 22 05:56:11 2015 UTC,"Sadly, yes.  Even if it weren't ColoCrossing, servers don't live downtown, ride Metro Rail to work, or shop in downtown stores or eat in downtown restaurants during their lunch breaks.  A server farm employs very few people per GFA compared to traditional office uses, and contributes as much to downtown's street life and vitality as a warehouseor archival storage facility."

Buffalo,33cvzo,KnivesAndShallots,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:20:07 2015 UTC,"something more welcoming to start with.  look at convention centers across the nation in major metropolitan areas; they're all brimming with natural light in the the common area up front. Buffalo's, you walk in, it feels like a shallow cave of false bright lights.     San Diego is an excellent example to model after, including Boston's, and Pittsburgh's.  The exterior ought to be interesting to look at, afterall it is a very large building, who wants to just look at a giant plain box?  feel like something contemporary yet, modern would be neat, i'd like to see something done by  Frank Gehry in the area. OR better if a new convention center could be implemented in an existing building (ie main place mall), then newer buildings erected in place of the current convention center, perhaps the rest of the UB campus, or ECC. beyond the atrium, there isn't much more to design than just giant show rooms and massive ""classrooms""."

Buffalo,33b8nc,ooppoop,-1,Tue Apr 21 03:20:12 2015 UTC,Have you been to Canada? Their culture is different. And FWI is an acronym used on the subreddit /r/futurewhatif meaning future what if
Buffalo,33b8nc,Hanoiing,9,Tue Apr 21 05:45:33 2015 UTC,Its really not that much different.  We have way more in common with someone in St Catherine's than we do someone in Kentucky.
Buffalo,33b8nc,LeJourLeFroid,3,Tue Apr 21 05:47:35 2015 UTC,"Contrary to myth, Canadians are just as rude as Americans && just as bad when it comes to littering, look at mall parking lots. And they don't dance at live concerts. They do however drink as much budweiser as anyone South & West of the great Lakes."
Buffalo,33b8nc,Hanoiing,0,Tue Apr 21 15:05:24 2015 UTC,"You make a compelling argument, I'll remember that. But their culture is different; they have free health care, different demographics of people, are part of the British Commonwealth, different style of government, certain goods like alcohol and cigarettes have much more strict controls, taxes on such goods and most other goods are much higher. If we were in fact annexed, these issues would fundamentally change our every day life. Also, I would like to know, what do we have in common with people form St. Catharines, the closest big city to Western New York, besides sharing maybe 10 television and radio stations, what is the common ground?"
Buffalo,33b8nc,whirlpool138,6,Tue Apr 21 16:08:07 2015 UTC,"My ex-girlfriend was from Canada, I never seemed to have any problems when we were dating. All the stuff you listed is exactly what defines a culture, we shop at the same stores, follow the same teams, go to the same concerts and follow the same bands. The list could go on forever. It's dumb to think  the international border causes that much of a cultural difference, there are many things that define culture besides nationality and legal laws (take Germany and Austria for example). Shit, I spent my whole teenage years going over to Niagara Falls, Ontario and hanging out on Clifton Hill. My family used to go shopping at Comisos every weekend. If anything, the border is holding back WNY and Southern Ontario's true potential."
Buffalo,33b8nc,Hanoiing,6,Tue Apr 21 16:24:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but does this mean we're culturally different than Pennsylvanian because they have state ran liquor stores? Or New Jersey where you cannot pump your own gas?  Or Vermont which I've heard is adopting a single payer healthcare system, Nevada where prostitution is legal, Washington where marijuana is legal, Texas where they teach abstinence only education, California where there are strict water use restrictions, Mississippi where gay marriage is banned? What about the freaks in Arizona that don't recognize Day Light Savings Time? What about Puerto Rico or Hawaii where the official language is not just English?  At the end of the day, Buffalo and Lower Ontario share the shame Midwestern Culture and our shared legacies of being post industrial centers. Also, our accent takes on some characteristics due to our proximity to the border.  Both countries give their states/provinces a significant amount of autonomy. US law is based upon British common law. US higher education is based off of British institutes. The US almost adopted a universal healthcare system and even began the process to convert to the metric system in the 50s and 60s."
Buffalo,33b8nc,Hanoiing,-1,Tue Apr 21 17:14:47 2015 UTC,"Wow, all those similarities; if I'm clear, it's that we kind of talk alike? (not really) and share a ""mid western"" American culture with Southern Ontario? I'm interested to know what this international ""American mid western culture"" consists of"
Buffalo,33b8nc,LonelyNixon,5,Tue Apr 21 17:22:19 2015 UTC,"It comes from proximity. The transmission of people, goods and ideas over a short geographical distance.  Please note, I am not saying that our culture is identical. I'm just saying that our culture is ridiculously more similar than any region in North America outside of the American Midwest.  A major similarity is the genuine friendliness people greet you with and the general openness to strangers. The fact that nobody is bothered or aghast that you went up to them on the street and started a conversation - even if its just small talk."
Buffalo,33b8nc,TOMALTACH,2,Tue Apr 21 17:36:25 2015 UTC,I can agree with that
Buffalo,33b8nc,whirlpool138,0,Tue Apr 21 17:45:38 2015 UTC,"Not much different? More likely incredibly different in every way imaginable. Did you know that they pump gas in liters, and their national animal the Beaver has an uncanny ability for biting people in an artery in the leg that causes people to bleed out?"
Buffalo,33b8nc,Hanoiing,5,Tue Apr 21 13:47:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but pop is sold in liters at American stores and the last time I checked, those damn beavers never stay on their side of the border."
Buffalo,33b8nc,Hanoiing,2,Tue Apr 21 14:04:16 2015 UTC,"lol, they still pump gas! it's not like they all drive solar cars, or load up a hopper with coal to heat their boilers in their steam powered vehicles.     beavers biting leg artery? are you sure you're not mixing them up with the ROUS's of the mississippi?"
Buffalo,33b8nc,whirlpool138,7,Tue Apr 21 14:55:24 2015 UTC,Where have you been? Western New York pretty much shares the same culture as Southern Ontario. We are closer to Toronto any day than NYC.
Buffalo,33b8nc,frobs,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:19:11 2015 UTC,"Interesting, it ""pretty much shares the culture"" in what ways, specifically?"
Buffalo,33b8nc,whirlpool138,6,Tue Apr 21 17:06:43 2015 UTC,"Its easy.  Travel to San Francisco, then Houston, then Boston. Get out of the touristy areas and talk to the locals. You'll noticed much greater differences between these cities and yourself than your average person just across the border in say Hamilton.  Also, just like the term ""American"" is a vast generalization, so is ""Canadian."" Vancouver and Seattle share a similar culture, as do Maine and the Maritimes, or the Great Plains on either side of the border."
Buffalo,33b8nc,frobs,2,Tue Apr 21 17:20:49 2015 UTC,"Ok, people at literally opposite ends of American have different culture I grant you that. But we share an American identity, national media, and most importantly federal guidelines that make all of the United States more homogenous than they could be with a whole other nation with a different history, customs and culture."

Buffalo,3395lg,ShakesJr,8,Thu Apr 23 14:34:37 2015 UTC,"City Hall is encouraging residents to collect rain water run-off from their homes rather than letting it flow into sewers, a move aimed at helping to prevent Buffalo’s sewer and storm water system from getting overwhelmed.  As an enticement, the city is offering 1,000 down spouts and rain barrels free of charge to residents. When those spouts and barrels are gone, the city will sell additional ones for $100 and $200 each, depending on whether residents needs a large or small barrel.  The first 1,000 will go to the first residents to contact the city, evenly divided between Buffalo’s nine Common Council districts.  The Buffalo Sewer Authority will deliver and install the equipment. The water collected in the barrels, city officials said, can be hooked up to a hose and used to water lawns.  Anyone interested can sign up by visiting raincheckbuffalo.org, by texting 877-877 or by calling 311.  The program, known as Rain Check, is part of a 2014 commitment by the city with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state Department of Environmental Conservation to reduce sewage and storm water run-off into Buffalo’s combined sewer system. The system gets overwhelmed during heavy rains, sending untreated sewage into local waters, including Scajaquada Creek.  At a Monday news conference, Mayor Byron W. Brown said the down spouts and rain barrels offer a way for all city residents to help address the problem.  The Rain Check program is being done with support from the Community Foundation of Greater Buffalo, which donated $170,000 toward the project, part of money the foundation obtained from a national organization.  The program is being offered citywide following a pilot program that began two years ago, which found the down spouts and barrels effective in reducing water going into the sewer and storm water system, according to sewer authority officials.  The city has also been working on the program with Buffalo Niagara Riverkeeper and PUSH Buffalo."
Buffalo,3395lg,LonelyNixon,2,Mon Apr 20 17:18:59 2015 UTC,What exactly do they use the rain water for? Like drinking water from the tap? Or does it go to showers and toilet water?
Buffalo,3395lg,LonelyNixon,4,Tue Apr 21 13:59:41 2015 UTC,"watering plants, washing cars, cleaning things unnecessarily such as driveways, etc"
Buffalo,3395lg,rutr0,1 point,Tue Apr 21 14:47:48 2015 UTC,Oh so it's just for the hose. Ok that works cause I wouldn't really trust exclusively drinking water that initially passes through the rust belt of this country before getting to me and falling into my drinking glass.
Buffalo,3395lg,LonelyNixon,5,Tue Apr 21 15:01:52 2015 UTC,"You mean, like our drinking water that comes from Lake Erie?"
Buffalo,3395lg,rutr0,5,Tue Apr 21 20:01:53 2015 UTC,Yeah but that goes to a treatment plant before it's processed. Rain is formed by water droplets accumulate around impurities in the atmosphere. Ideally this is just like pollen and junk but in this case we are talking about smoke stacks and what have you. I'm not saying drinking rain water will kill you but exclusively drinking that stuff unprocessed can't be good for you in this day and age.
Buffalo,3395lg,fullcircle_bflo,3,Tue Apr 21 21:10:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was just being a wiseass. Some are even hesitant to use rain barrel water for vegetable gardens on account of contamination from asphalt roofs. From research I've read, the biggest contamination possibilities come from bird crap that can accumulate in gutters. That said, I fully support this project for the positive impact it will have on our often overwhelmed wastewater system."
Buffalo,3395lg,Sabres00,2,Wed Apr 22 11:48:04 2015 UTC,"haha. yeah, it's just a way to conserve treated water use, collecting and using water that falls from the sky for non-essential tasks."

That is hardly enough time to judge the programs success.  Most Universities did not get on board until late last year. Many are only now getting incubator space and processes finalized. We are lucky in Buffalo that UB was on board at the beginning.  Look at BAK USA for example. They are setting up a manufacturing plant. Of course they are not going to have all 100 people they pledged to hire in less than a year. That is completely unrealistic.  Same goes for Liazon. You don't just hire 500 people all at once, especially if the space is not ready yet.  In short this articles and the other ones are either impatient or just choosing an easy target since it has Cuomo's name on it (though it was design by some very intelligent people with no relation to Cuomo).  In reality, Startup NY has barely begun and is designed as a long term redevelopment tool. Which is a breath of fresh air considering the neglect and silver bullet projects."

Buffalo,336qtj,halcyonights,4,Fri Apr 24 12:51:13 2015 UTC,"FYI: If you're a prize winner, you will have all the winning pieces in the same ticket. At least, this was how it worked 2 years ago, when I last worked for the company. It may have changed in the intervening years.  Edit: Forgot to mention: By the end of the campaign, everyone is missing the same 1 or 2 pieces for each prize. This is done deliberately to keep an active interest in the game. An exchange system would end up with an overabundance of the common pieces being offered, with everyone needing the same rarer pieces to complete the prize. Essentially, winning the game is akin to winning the lottery. It's not really possible to ""beat the system"" in this case.   Source: Tops employee/management for 9 years."

Also, when minimum wage increased from 8.25 to 8.75, they cut every department's hours by absolutely ridiculous amounts. They could have cut 1 hour per 1 department employee and easily have covered the cost but no, they decided to fuck everyone over who wasn't management. Why cut a 3 person department 15 hours?

Buffalo,332zis,ninthinning01,1 point,Sun Apr 19 03:00:58 2015 UTC,Thousands of additional jobs created by businesses that support solar city is going way overboard.
Buffalo,332zis,a_jackson_federalist,4,Sun Apr 19 14:18:20 2015 UTC,"You do realize what Solarcity does right?  They are primarily a solar panel installation company. This means they do need thousands of techs to go to homes and businesses to outfit them.  Solar is getting more efficient and cheaper every year. It is not going to be long before we see homes getting rid of their utility bills altogether (which could be as much as $2000 per year), even in places like Buffalo.  Once you have one major factory of single industry, this attract other companies who want to take advantage of the labor pool that is already established. This is why certain industries are centered around specific cities."
Buffalo,332zis,Eudaimonics,0,Sun Apr 19 21:54:23 2015 UTC,"They will not hire thousands of techs in WNY to go to homes and businesses to outfit them. Maybe they hire a couple dozen people to work in this capacity. Regardless, that's not what /u/ninthinning01 was saying.

When thinking seriously about the Solarcity business model this could also be a total disaster.   We are paying nearly a billion dollars (Buffalo billion) to build the Solarcity buildings and infrastructure while Solarcity contributions are $0.01.

If this facility is as massive as they're making it out to be that's not that bold of a statement.   I'm more curious how it will impact the nearby area.

Buffalo,32zplg,arabdoc,7,Sat Apr 18 02:22:10 2015 UTC,"Buffalo is very good at getting rid of a lot of snow fast.  You won't need to assume any more time for winter versus summer. Just keep an eye on the weather report - if it's due to snow between 4am and 6am, it could extend your commute substantially. Otherwise, the rule of thumb in Buffalo is that nothing is more than a 20 minute drive.   The location you picked will certainly be safe, but also very lacking in neighborhood/social/cultural qualities. You definitely won't have the ""Buffalo Experience.""  I know you'll be working long hours, but if you're the type that may want to walk to a little restaurant for a great dinner and a beer after work, you should consider living in Elmwood Village or Allentown.  Those are both much closer to your work (Allentown is less than five minutes to Buff Gen, and EV is ten).  They're both safe for a city (EV more so than Allentown although I've lived in the latter for six years with no incidents).  You might deal with a car break in once every three or four years, but muggings and house break-ins are rare.  However, the type of apartment you describe is rare for both neighborhoods. Most Buffalo apartments are ""flats"" - one floor in a 1900 era house.  Some have off street parking in the driveway. There are a couple of small apartment buildings with covered parking, but probably outside your price range."
Buffalo,32zplg,KnivesAndShallots,1 point,Sat Apr 18 02:56:18 2015 UTC,"Amazing information, thanks! I don't think I'll have time for any fun unfortunately...will barely have time to sleep, so social qualities are not my priorities.  I've considered both neighborhoods but I haven't found any flats besides one at the Elliott apartments on Linewood which was a little pricey for what I saw.  Any specific apartment complexes like the ones you described in EV/Allentown?  Otherwise I may just stick with Boulevard towers in Amherst and wake up 15 minutes earlier for work!"
Buffalo,32zplg,KnivesAndShallots,2,Sat Apr 18 03:11:31 2015 UTC,"You might check Ellicott Development for the type of apartment you're describing, although you may not find one for under $900.  Kissling has some great locations (some buildings are nicer than others) and will be in your price range, but they don't have the best reputation as landlords.   I understand what you're saying regarding social qualities not being a priority.  I'm only cautioning you that if you put any value at all into a sense of neighborhood, you're in pretty much the only part of Buffalo with very little of it. Every neighborhood in buffalo and the suburbs has a cool history and general ""feel,"" but unfortunately that pocket of Amherst east of Niagara Falls Boulevard and north of Maple is just kind of bleh.  Edit: I just noticed you already mentioned Ellicott.  Here is a beautiful building in Allentown and literally a five minute walk to Buff Gen.  I have no idea how much the apartments are though, or what the parking situation is."

Big windows, exposed air ducts and some with brick, has that lofty feel.   Mohawk parking garage is directly next to it and costs $72 monthly for 24hr/7days a week.

Buffalo,32zplg,Vocal_Minority,3,Sat Apr 18 09:09:17 2015 UTC,Idk what you're talking about. It's very easy to hop on the 198 to the 190 to get downtown or the 198 to the 33 or just shoot down main.  All 10-20 min drives depending on all the other botards on the road.
Buffalo,32zplg,LeJourLeFroid,2,Sat Apr 18 14:20:54 2015 UTC,"Lol, shoot down main. What, do you have a traffic light controller in your car or something?"
Buffalo,32zplg,Eudaimonics,2,Sun Apr 19 02:48:26 2015 UTC,Anyone who travels on main frequently knows the timing of the lights. /u/fanyandimportantman ought to realize a reality & learn to adjust appropriately
Buffalo,32zplg,FancyAndImportantMan,1 point,Sun Apr 19 05:00:39 2015 UTC,I live in North Buffalo and driving is super easy.  Just avoid Parkside during rush hour. Take Delaware or Mainstreet to the 198 instead.
Buffalo,32zplg,Eudaimonics,1 point,Sat Apr 18 17:18:53 2015 UTC,"The stop and go/red lights on the main drags are killer, especially north of Amherst St. The small side streets aren't as bad and usually quite nice."
Buffalo,32zplg,FancyAndImportantMan,2,Sat Apr 18 17:23:23 2015 UTC,"Ok, I will admit that there are way too many lights.  Many of the lights should only be active when school begins/let out since they are really only used by buses."
Buffalo,32zplg,maxwell7301,0,Sat Apr 18 17:36:49 2015 UTC,Yeah or at least sync them. People drive either like it's the expressway or like a little old lady in a Yugo on the main strips so it's a complete wild card.
Buffalo,32zplg,FancyAndImportantMan,1 point,Sat Apr 18 18:31:19 2015 UTC,"How so?   The traffic in North Buffalo is nothing, compared to the Amherst area, in my opinion.  I've lived in North Buffalo for a while.   I really have no complaints about the traffic."
Buffalo,32zplg,maxwell7301,0,Sat Apr 18 20:53:13 2015 UTC,"The main streets can get clogged, and the lights are too long and there are too many of them. I get the same vibe driving on Delaware/Elmwood/Main as I do on Transit or Genesee. Maybe it's because I'm not used to the area, although I did drive on Elmwood quite often when I went to the gym or when I worked on Great Arrow."
Buffalo,32zplg,Eudaimonics,1 point,Sat Apr 18 20:57:16 2015 UTC,"The lights in the city are terrible.  I wouldn't say the volume of cars is bad, though."
Buffalo,32zplg,flancresty,2,Sat Apr 18 22:49:29 2015 UTC,"From Amherst, you are looking at a 45 minute commute minimum in rush hour traffic. By the sounds of it you won't be dealing with rush hour traffic though. Snow can add some time, but on most days it wont. If it just snowed the night before, I would leave 20 minutes early. However, considering you are leaving so early, you probably don't have to worry about any slowdowns.  You might want to try parking at UB South (8 minute drive away) and taking the Metrorail down too. It would definitely be quicker during rush hour and you wouldn't need to worry about parking at all.  However, you would probably be much happier living closer to the hospital.   Allentown - Right adjacent to the hospital. You could easily walk to work everyday. This is Buffalo's bohemian neighborhood and offers a ton of great restaurants and arguably is Buffalo's best nightlife district. You're also within walking distance of downtown which offers a ton of things to do.Apartments are rapidly increasing in price, but you should find something for $900 a month. Elmwood Village - Buffalo's most in demand neighborhood. Rents along Elmwood itself is likely beyond your budget, but the farther away you get, the prices go down. Look for an apartment between Delaware and Mainstreet and you will also be within walking distance of the Metrorail Parkside - Quiet little neighborhood home to the Buffalo zoo, Medaille College, and the Darwin Martin House. Its a quick drive to either Hertel Ave to the North or Elmwood for restaurants and other amenities. Also you will be within walking distance of the Metrorail. North Buffalo - A little more laid back than Elmwood or Allentown, but Hertel Ave is a great street in its own right filled with bars, cafes, restaurants and boutiques. You'll also be within walking distance of Delaware Park and its the only area of the city where you find big box stores if you need to do some more serious shopping. The park and ride at UB South is a short drive away as well.    The only issue it seems is covered parking, but is does exist in those neighborhoods for some of the complexes."
Buffalo,32zplg,buffalo442,0,Sat Apr 18 17:17:24 2015 UTC,"For $700-$900, you can get a sweet place in North Buffalo, which is both the best neighborhood for adults, and the closest to Amherst. My fiancee commutes from N. Buff to the Amherst campus, and it's 15-20 without snow, maybe 30 min when it was snowing and for the day or two after, and never more than 45 minutes, even in horrible conditions.  edit herp derp i'm dumb. north buffalo is still the best though."

Buffalo,32w6ua,Trosso,-1,Fri Apr 17 21:31:33 2015 UTC,"That's honestly a really nice picture.  Too bad he didn't take it on a Samsung (or for that matter, one of those 41-megapixel Nokias), it could look even nicer!"
Buffalo,32w6ua,goaltaylor33,13,Fri Apr 17 13:31:14 2015 UTC,Not really. The photographer matters so so so much more than the camera.
Buffalo,32w6ua,flancresty,5,Fri Apr 17 14:21:10 2015 UTC,"I wasn't shitting on Apple for no reason.  The fact of the matter is, their best phone has an 8 megapixel camera.  That's a much lower quality camera than Samsung or Nokia.  There's no debating that.  And for the record, I don't understand why when anyone does anything, that I have to know that it was on an iPhone.  OP left it right in the title.  If he didn't want opinions on how the picture was taken, he wouldn't have included the information right there for all of us to read.  Also for the record, I agree with u/ooppoop, they are overpriced status symbols, and they're crappy to boot.  iPhone is consistently multiple iterations behind competing phones.  Do you know the last iteration of the Galaxy that had an 8 megapixel camera?  It was the S3.  If you're keeping track, they're on the S6.  And iPhone somehow manages to be more expensive than their competitors while also being technologically inferior.  For the life of me, I don't know why anyone buys them.  So yeah, plenty of good reasons to shit on them."
Buffalo,32w6ua,goaltaylor33,4,Fri Apr 17 14:23:29 2015 UTC,"""Sing it sista! "" lol. Figure of speech. Completely agree on noting (what device was used). Nobody says ""pic"" (nikon & 50 red filter 350mm).   Besides /u/flancestry is on point.  Nobody cares about you're stupid device.   I could take an equivalent photo with a disposable camera & touch it up with ps.     Love apple's advertising for their newest and phone where it can do something new that droid has done for.ev.er.    Whatever. To each their wasteful expenses own."
Buffalo,32w6ua,ooppoop,7,Fri Apr 17 23:34:22 2015 UTC,"You do understand that what I said regarding megapixels was a fact, not an opinion, right?  Megapixels determine exactly how clear a picture a given camera is able to take.  The higher the megapixels, the greater the resolution, the better the picture.  My personal opinion is irrelevant; the iPhone's camera is technologically inferior to those competitors I mentioned, on a hardware level.  This isn't an opinion that can be debated, it's a fact that must be observed.  And no, Apple didn't do anything negative to me as a child.  I loved traveling the Oregon Trail on them when I was a kid.  But as an adult, they changed from a tech company who liked to push technological borders and innovate to a greedy corporate giant who preys on the uninformed and does little to nothing to improve the technological world around it.  What was the last real innovation Apple had?  All I can think of is Siri, which I was legitimately excited for because of the technological advances it represented.  But it ended up being just a marketing ploy to sell phones and they've done nothing to improve the way the technology works.  Thank goodness other companies will follow up for them.  In short, Apple fell from grace as a respectable tech company and have shown time and time again that they have no plans to redeem themselves.  As a company, they have become useless.  And I will not abide that.  And since you've missed it in my previous reply: the reason I'm ""shitting on Apple"" in this very specific instance is that the phone's camera is actually technologically inferior, and it was used to take OP's beautiful picture, which means that the picture would have looked even better using another device.  It is a pertinent point to make regarding the picture, and so I pointed it out."
Buffalo,32w6ua,goaltaylor33,2,Sat Apr 18 01:16:32 2015 UTC,Apple makes overpriced garbage used by sheep
Buffalo,32w6ua,darkviper039,-3,Sat Apr 18 03:14:47 2015 UTC,"wow, could you sound any more pretentious? I switched from an iPhone to a Samsung 4 years ago, and I love it, but I still think Apple makes a great product. I've had my macbook for 7 years now and have never once had a virus or had to take it in for any kind of repair, and it's still just as fast as the day I bought it.   they may be a bit overpriced, but their UI is fantastic. for people who aren't super tech-savvy, and don't have the need to customize every aspect of their phone, it's a great product."
Buffalo,32w6ua,chocolate_babies,0,Sat Apr 18 07:21:34 2015 UTC,"o, there's a reason, it's overpriced status symbol crap.     even better, lost your iphone? go through a bunch of red tape to get a new one - when it's found it locks up incapacitating any possible use of it after a full factory reset, leaving whomever tries to return it with a useless piece of junk when the original owner doesn't make any attempts to retrieve it.     lose your droid? much less hassle than replacing an iphone. including not becoming a useless piece of junk when it's found."
Buffalo,32w6ua,ooppoop,4,Fri Apr 17 18:14:42 2015 UTC,"Someone finds a lost phone and cannot use or access info on it at all?  You're right, downright terrible.  On a more serious note, you left out a key piece of info. The iPhone can be set up with ""Find My iPhone"" (which I don't know anyone who wouldn't take the 5 minutes to set it up) and it will show you the location of where the phone is.  One last thing, OP took a great photo and you try to turn this thread into another Android vs iOS debate which is not needed."

Buffalo,32w6ua,marm0lade,7,Fri Apr 17 16:34:47 2015 UTC,I'm not here to bash on Apple but you are incorrect about Android. I left my HTC One in a rest stop on a road trip last summer. When I realized it was gone (100 miles later) I used my laptop and Android device manager to see my phone was picked up and traveling down the highway. I called it numerous times and they did not answer and I knew they had no intention of returning it. My phone had a PIN lock and encryption enabled so my data was secure. I remotely wiped my device and reported it stolen to Tmobile which means it can't be reactivated for service. It was effectively bricked. iOS and Android are on par when it comes to device security.
Buffalo,32w6ua,ooppoop,-2,Fri Apr 17 16:43:53 2015 UTC,Good! I'm not familiar with Android security. I'm was just making assumptions based on the comment I was responding to.

Then again, now that I think of it, Wegmans doesn't really have a single prominent central location in WNY.  It would be cool if they finally upgraded their Amherst Street location. With the new liquor store, its obviously a location they want to keep investing in."
Buffalo,32xvwj,Eudaimonics,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:02:29 2015 UTC,The amherst store has had a lot of renovations it would seem. I moved away fromm 2010 and just got back 6 months ago. The dine in area is expanded to 2x the size it was when I left amongst other changes.
Buffalo,32xvwj,thahamer,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:15:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what the specifics are, but I remember reading that the Amherst street location just barely made the cut for getting a Wegmans. I believe there's certain parameters as far population density, size of the site, etc. that need to be met before a location is up for consideration."
Buffalo,32xvwj,chocolate_babies,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:36:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I like the Amherst Street store the way it is.  I don't want it to get bigger.   They did just remodel the prepared foods section, which is good.  The liquor store is a nice addition.  Another Wegmans in the city would be cool, but it's unlikely to happen any time soon.  Apparently, a lot of people don't like the new East Avenue Wegmans in Rochester.  It's big, it's annoying, the parking lot has ridiculous traffic and they got rid of the bulk section (because city).  They demolished an old store to built a large parking lot, and razed a whole city block for the new store."
Buffalo,32xvwj,maxwell7301,2,Fri Apr 17 19:51:36 2015 UTC,I don't have any problems with an Amherst location.  There's hundreds of awesome independent restaurants in the city that serve much better food than any corporate 'pub' ever will.  #buffaloeats

Very much like eating at a nice restaurant.   Mind you, it depends on which model they'll use for the upgrade. Some of Philly's earlier Wegmans had tile floors and the newer ones have cement floors. I know that sounds like a petty difference, but the tile really adds a warmth to the store."

I actually drove by this place on Tuesday (there was some crazy traffic on Rt 5 for some reason, so I ended up going to Hamburg via South Park) and thought ""Hey, that guy from Reddit should review that place.""  Then BAM!  Here it is.  But I want to know if the wings are good.  If so I'd definitely stop on a Wednesday.  Which reminds me, on my way through I also passed Chick-N-Pizza Works on Abbott and Southside Parkway.  Would love to know what you think of them."

Buffalo,32vcfx,ReverendBass,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:30:15 2015 UTC,Old news? I don't recall ever reading a story that Dugs Dive was closing. I know I read his lease was up in Jan. 2016 but that story said this tennesse guy who now managed the property was going to discuss keeping him there. Not sure this is old news at all
Buffalo,32vcfx,Sabres00,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:34:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah It was reported that the owner of Dugs may run it through 2015, but that was obviously just lip service to the media.

Then I remembered how expensive the place was for food that was just okay, coupled with the fact another restaurant is bound to open in it's place. If Kentucky Greg's opened there that would be the best thing possible. Just someplace that has high quality summer-time food at reasonable prices. A good seafood place would be nice too.  As someone else noted most of the restaurants on the water front suck. It would be great to have a good, inexpensive one available."

She cuts my hair while it's dry (which is how it should be done) and I always leave thrilled with how I look instead of miserable like I always used to be with other stylists. She doesn't have a ton of availability and they only take cash, but it's honestly worth it (and curly girls don't need to get haircuts frequently anyway). I usually make an appointment online and if there's nothing available for a while I check every few days to see if there were any cancellations. I usually end up getting in just a few days after looking. (sorry for rambling for so long, I just got really excited)."

They also have a live webcam of their shop, so you can take a look and see how crowded it is.

However, a chocolate covered cake does not have a VAT tax. So the company that makes Jaffa cakes went to court over it. They determined that the difference between a biscuit and a cake is in how they react when left out.  A biscuit becomes softer when stale, a cake becomes harder.

Buffalo,32jx5e,whirlpool138,2,Tue Apr 14 12:17:38 2015 UTC,"Between the city, county, and state (NYDOT), there's a massive amount of single-mode fiber under the city. It would certainly be doable, but someone competent would need to run it - anything controlled by local government would be ""subsidized"" to make it ""accessible"", and then cut at a later date, especially when the city already has no money.   Hell, the city technically already has municipal wireless, but it only covers Niagara Square, the Hatch, and a small area down the Marina."
Buffalo,32jx5e,Eudaimonics,8,Tue Apr 14 12:36:23 2015 UTC,"anything controlled by local government would be ""subsidized"" to make it ""accessible"", and then cut at a later date   Like hydro and electricity.....?"
Buffalo,32jx5e,flancresty,5,Tue Apr 14 15:47:11 2015 UTC,I thought Buffalo was actually doing pretty good financially? Don't they have a AAA credit rating now? I also much rather have a locally government ran internet service provider than have to pay Time Warner or Comcast. Treat it a municipality like water and electricity.
Buffalo,32jx5e,BuffNewsCommenter,5,Tue Apr 14 17:16:06 2015 UTC,"Municipal fiber would work in the same way that you pay for electricity, water or garbage collection.  If you look at the markups of the ISPs there is a TON of money to be saved by the tax payer and enough money to maintain and improve the system.  In short, it pays for itself. If done right, it might even generate revenue that could go towards other programs that could use funding (arts and culture, public transport, infrastructure and beautification, workforce development and poverty relief programs). Buffalo would also be a step ahead of cities without such a system."
Buffalo,32jx5e,nemoomen,4,Tue Apr 14 17:31:48 2015 UTC,"It definitely depends on how it is run, yes. There is no existing public utility that would take on something like this, so they would have to create one. It wouldn't be too hard to turn a profit from it and also be much cheaper and better than TWC or Verizon.  I don't think they'd have to subsidize the service. They'd just have to not make it ridiculously overpriced like current offerings from private companies are. It could easily run itself and generate profit if done in the right way."

Buffalo,32jx5e,Narrenschifff,5,Wed Apr 15 21:27:26 2015 UTC,"Cool, but I'd be wary about security on that if it's truly open/unsecured."
Buffalo,32jx5e,kryzchek,11,Tue Apr 14 12:06:13 2015 UTC,You should always use a VPN on any public or large private WiFi network. Security is always going to be an issue with them.
Buffalo,32jx5e,marm0lade,3,Tue Apr 14 12:16:14 2015 UTC,How does one do this?
Buffalo,32jx5e,kryzchek,2,Tue Apr 14 17:01:48 2015 UTC,There are a lot of great and free VPN clients out there. I'd recommend TunnelBear. Just download and use. On Android it is free for 500 MB or $2.99/month for unlimited bandwidth.  It's as simple as downloading and clicking GO.
Buffalo,32jx5e,SoBuffaloRes,2,Tue Apr 14 17:12:57 2015 UTC,Does it have any effect on speed? I'm curious because I have no idea about any of this stuff.
Buffalo,32jx5e,Narrenschifff,2,Tue Apr 14 19:47:37 2015 UTC,"All VPNs will slow down the connection speed a bit, but I haven't noticed that much difference from TunnelBear. Not sure what the max bandwidth is though. Plus I already have a very slow Internet speed, so maybe it's just my own personal experience.  That being said, I did just test it out on Netflix and it worked great. You can select a bunch of countries and your device will act like it is there. I chose Sweden and opened up my Netflix app and it showed a whole different movie catalog for streaming that isn't available in the US. There are even sites that show you what countries certain Netflix movies are available in so you can use a VPN to switch to that one and watch it instantly.  It's super easy."
Buffalo,32jx5e,Herman9020,-1,Tue Apr 14 20:19:53 2015 UTC,"That's not going to help much when it comes to someone sniffing WiFi traffic, which would be my primary concern."
Buffalo,32jx5e,SoBuffaloRes,7,Tue Apr 14 14:59:19 2015 UTC,The vpn wouldn't encrypt your data?
Buffalo,32jx5e,kryzchek,0,Tue Apr 14 15:07:01 2015 UTC,"It would but I still get a bit wary about it. Public Wifi can really lend itself to a man-in-the-middle type attack. It wouldn't take much effort to sit on a bench, broadcast a WiFi network with the same SSID and trick people into connecting to that.   I'd imagine the vast majority of users on the public WiFi are also going to be on mobile devices and probably aren't that savvy about setting up VPNs on them, although that's on them."
Buffalo,32jx5e,SoBuffaloRes,7,Tue Apr 14 15:33:40 2015 UTC,A man in the middle attack can't decrypt encrypted data over a VPN. MITM is good for sniffing unencrypted traffic or spoofing SSL certificates used by common web services. But if you are using a VPN those attacks can not happen.
Buffalo,32jx5e,cookie_partie,0,Tue Apr 14 15:50:12 2015 UTC,"I'm banking on the fact that 99% of people won't be using a VPN, and those that are going to connect to fake WiFi almost certainly won't be."
Buffalo,32jx5e,buffalo442,6,Tue Apr 14 15:51:37 2015 UTC,Which is why a VPN was suggested from the get-go:  To prevent MITM attacks.
Buffalo,32jx5e,wafflesareforever,3,Tue Apr 14 17:22:16 2015 UTC,Wish I knew more about this stuff. Is there a good resource to read for the layman?
Buffalo,32jx5e,ProfessorPoopyPants7,6,Tue Apr 14 16:21:23 2015 UTC,"If you Google ""how VPNs work"" there are a bunch of sites that will explain about it. I use a really easy and simple one called TunnelBear. Great Android app too and you don't need to know how to set anything up or configure anything.  Basically, if you are on a WiFi network with someone else, they can access data you're sending, including usernames and passwords, pretty easily. If you use a VPN, then even if they are able to, it will be completely useless to them since it will be encrypted and show up as gibberish.  Most people don't know what a VPN is or that public WiFi is dangerous, but that's a concern everywhere, including Starbucks or hotel WiFi, so this isn't anything new or unique to what Buffalo is doing, and it can be very easily fixed by simply downloading a good VPN client."
Buffalo,32jx5e,Eudaimonics,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:28:14 2015 UTC,You are right but our Access Points are using a tri-radio design which means that the third radio is searching for rogue APs. If an AP has the same SSID as ours our APs will look at their MAC address and know that they are not part of the network. Then when a client connects to the rogue AP our radio will send a disconnect signal to the foreign AP forcing it to drop the client.
Buffalo,32jx5e,Herman9020,4,Tue Apr 28 06:14:16 2015 UTC,"Um, yes, it would.  You could sniff the traffic all day if you like.

Buffalo,32jx5e,bobdoleraisetaxes,5,Tue Apr 14 14:12:03 2015 UTC,"You find ""public"" wifi in most touristy places of major cities all over the world.  Usually, they are set up by telecoms and you have to sign up in order to use the service (which they then can sell to marketing companies) as well as subject you to ads.  By the sounds of it, this system is a bit different than that because it seems to be true public wifi and not just free commercial wifi.  We'll see.   UB does have experience making sure 1000s of people are able to use their connection simultaneously without barely a hiccup on their campuses. I have a lot of hope that the system won't be bogged down too much by having so many people connected to it."
Buffalo,32jx5e,SJ135,2,Tue Apr 14 17:35:37 2015 UTC,"I designed the system to accommodate 250 clients per AP due to the high bandwidth design. If I detect congestion, we will install another AP to load balance the traffic. The system is using bandwidth steering which means that a client trying to connect at 2.4GHz but has an 802.11ac network card, the system will push the client to the 5.8GHz spectrum which can handle 4 times the capacity."

Buffalo,32mwni,cjf4,4,Wed Apr 15 01:49:21 2015 UTC,"I posted this mostly because I found the midcentury perspective on Buffalo's esteem fascinating. Framed in the context of consistent rejection by all four major sports leagues of its status as a big time city, I learned that some of the esteem issues that have dogged Buffalo for decades (and that it finally seems to be escaping) were much more deep seeded than I thought. Apparently the jokes about Buffalo being 2 decades behind fashion wise aren't exactly new witticisms.  Also fascinating was the talk of the new football stadium. Many of the considerations haven't changed: open air or domed? suburban or downtown? spartan or posh? The county wound up going with the former on all counts, which is interesting to contrast with the modern consensus for the latter in all 3 matters.  Finally, despite the still fresh in the head obits from his timely passing, I don't think anything I've read has painted a better picture of what kind of a guy Ralph Wilson was: a hard core pragmatist. His frank words about both the strengths and weaknesses of the city as a sports town, while not as warm and fuzzy as many Bills fans fond remembrances, go a long way to explaining a lot about Buffalo.  Anyway, if you have a couple of minutes, it's well worth a read."
Buffalo,32mwni,dan_blather,2,Wed Apr 15 02:34:52 2015 UTC,"Apparently the jokes about Buffalo being 2 decades behind fashion wise aren't exactly new witticisms.   I graduated from a high school in the city in 1984.    I showed non-Buffalonians some pictures copied from my senior yearbook, and asked them to guess what year they were taken.  As a control, I also showed them photos from 1984 yearbooks from elsewhere in the country.  For the non-Buffalo photos, most guessed mid-to-late 1980s.  For the photos from my yearbook, most guessed mid-to-late 1970s.     Anyhow, Buffalo was a strange place in the 1970s.  Neighborhood business districts were still vibrant, there was no urban prairie, factories were still running, all the pre-Conrail rail lines were active, corner bars got busy during shift changes, and the UB South Campus was still where most classes took place.  It was full of life, but it was also a place that was beaten down by time.  You want to talk ""authentic"" and ""gritty"" - that was 1970s Buffalo.  Dirty, streets and parks filled with litter, buildings covered in soot, nothing ""preserved"" or ""restored"", houses covered in ghetto brick, rustbuckets ruling the roads, expressway pavement with a beat, and surface street potholes that make this year's road damage seem like superficial thermal cracks in comparison.  Very little in the city seemed new or fresh, or even reasonably polished.  Culturally, outside of some parts of Amherst, Clarence, OP/EA, and some west-of-Main neighborhoods, it was overwhelmingly blue collar, and very working-to-lower-middle class.  Imagine Depew X 50.  And, for some odd reason, so many people liked it that way."
Buffalo,32mwni,maxwell7301,2,Wed Apr 15 12:17:39 2015 UTC,"As a non Buffalo native (Rochester, for what it's worth), this seems to explain a lot of Buffalo's best and worst qualities.  On one hand, I've never been fond of the aesthetics of a lot of the industrial, working class neighborhoods. They always seemed packed a little too tightly, awnings, wrought iron, a lot of the worst vestiges of mid century design.  However after spending some time here I started to learn there was something endearing about the culture beneath that Depew type of thing. Work hard, raise a family, have a beer, watch sports. I think the uncomplicated, unpretentious nature of that can look really good compared to some of the complexities and stresses of modern life. And it went a long way towards creating stronger communities than some more economic prosperous places."

I remember approaching the stadium near the Washington Street entrance, and the doors were locked. line went down Washington Street and people were throwing themselves against the door trying to get in. My dad didn't let us stick around to see what would happen, but I remember the banging sound and people hollering ""Open it!"" We went around to wait in line on Swan Street.   The whole plaza area around the stadium was packed. While we were waiting in line, I saw Mr. Birmingham, my social studies teacher, among those waiting to get in. He was wearing a heavy tan coat, a ball cap, and was listening to a Walkman. We made eye contact and he smiled and shrugged. I was still young enough that I thought it was disorienting and cool to see teachers in the wild.  I remember we sat on the third baseline near home plate, in one of the last rows of the lower level. Mayor Jimmy Griffin was among those who gave a speech down on the field, and we were all so excited. Not because the Bisons were playing, but because Buffalo built something, and it was beautiful, and new, and because we just knew that a major league baseball team was coming. This was three years before the Bills were Super Bowl contenders, FYI. But we were happy and optimistic.  I don't remember much about the game, except my father was enjoying being a part of history that day. He said things like, ""Remember who threw out the first pitch..."" and ""Remember where we were sitting today."" Late in the game, Tom Prince hit a home run -- I think it was a three-run HR? -- that put the Bisons on top by one. It was the game winning run. As the ball left his bat and sailed toward the left field wall, everyone in my section stood up. I was 12 so my view was blocked, but I could see through the shoulders in front of me the ball carry over the fence. I remember that feeling. ""We're winning. We're winning. We won."""
Buffalo,32lde5,Giant_Slor,2,Wed Apr 15 13:11:45 2015 UTC,disorienting and cool to see teachers in the wild     haha. love this.
Buffalo,32lde5,bucky716,2,Wed Apr 15 13:31:14 2015 UTC,"The Bisons and their field are probably in my Top 5 of things that make Buffalo awesome. I'm a lifelong Yankees fan who had spent far too long paying redic prices to see professional baseball, doubly so when they tore down Yankee Stadium and replaced it with that GDMFing abomination that now shares the name.   One of the first things I ever did when I moved here in the Summer of 2010 was to go to a Bisons game, and it totally changed my views on minor league ball and brought back my love for the game.  As somebody who last paid $74 a pop for bleacher seats at the house that greed built while also shelling out $11 for a pint of beer and probably a similar amount for the program so I could score the game, going to a place where I paid less than $15 for basically field-level seats (bought on game day), got a free program and was charged a fair price for a brew and dog was just mindblowing. I now make it a point to attend as many games as I can during the season.   Probably my favorite memory thusfar is last year in June when a buddy and I got seats behind home plate and sat pretty much right next to the guy who I think is partially blind but spends the game listening intently to his radio shouting at the opposing pitcher and showing him his armpit on hitters counts. The more beers in, the better that guy got."

Buffalo,32lde5,a_jackson_federalist,2,Wed Apr 15 00:32:51 2015 UTC,This is actually one of the better AAA stadiums on account that Buffalo at one time was in the running for a big league team.

Buffalo,32lde5,a_jackson_federalist,1 point,Wed Apr 15 12:01:33 2015 UTC,This one had the ability (not sure if it still does) to be quickly expanded into a MLB caliber stadium.
Buffalo,32lde5,a_jackson_federalist,1 point,Wed Apr 15 22:07:15 2015 UTC,No MLB owner would ever move a team to Buffalo under the conditions that Coca Cola gets expanded. The parts of the stadium that would be used by the MLB team are just too antiquated when compared to modern stadiums.
Buffalo,32lde5,LeJourLeFroid,0,Wed Apr 15 23:42:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that the ones you've been too were state of the art, but I am saying that Buffalo's stadium sucks compared to any AAA stadium built within the past 5 years. Size isn't everything. Buffalo's stadium is the largest of all the dozens of minor league stadiums spread across the country. This was great during the late 80's when it was getting filled up and Buffalo was contending for an MLB team, but now it's kind of a detriment.  There are three big things that make a stadium bad or good. First is whether or not the concourses are closed or open. At Coca Cola, to get to your seat from the concourse, you have to walk through a tunnel. This means that while you are buying concessions, going to the bathroom, or just walking around the stadium, you lose sight of the game. New stadiums are built with concourses that are open to the field, and the this both increases the gameday revenue for the team, as fans spend more time in the concourses where they're buying expensive food and drinks, and improves the fans experience as they're able to be in the concourse and still see the game action. If I had time I would show you pictures.  Second is how the seats are oriented to the infield. Coca Cola doesn't completely fail here, but of the two field level seat layouts, that are still used in new stadiums, Coca Cola is using the lesser of the two. Basically, the vast majority of the action that fans want to see happens in the infield. The seats should all be as close as possible to the infield and oriented to face the infield. There are newer stadiums that do a much better job with this than Buffalo's nearly 30 year old stadium does.  Finally, the stadium experience is getting more and more tied with food and concessions. Coca Cola just doesn't have the space for them to give fans access to really nice bars and restaurants. It was designed at a time when the emphasis just wasn't placed on that."

Seriously, the City of Detroit is the equivalent of five or six East Sides, plus some Cheektowagas, Tonawandas, Lackawannas, and Snyders with varying levels of East Side-style blight.  It's more-or-less a demographic monoculture - there's only a few neighborhoods with more than a token white population.    The culture of the Detroit metro area, as a whole, is almost identical to ""old Buffalo"" culture.  The accent is a dead ringer, down to the flat A and making every business name possessive.  Tim Horton donuts, love of hockey, growing up with Canadian TV, Carhartt jackets everywhere, lots of Polish people ... just like home.  The built environment, though ... much different.  Another difference -  racial and labor conflict are defining and dominant themes in Detroit's history.  In Buffalo, not nearly as much."

It is a completely meaningless fact since city boundaries are totally arbitrary. Cities like San Antonio and Jacksonville have their borders drawn way out to the farmland, encompassing wealthy suburbs as well as the inner city poorer neighborhoods. By contrast, Buffalo's borders are small relative to most other cities.  If history had been a little different and the City of Buffalo included some of the wealthier inner ring suburbs like Snyder, Hamburg, or Kenmore, we would not even be in the top ten of this list.   The only meaningful way to compare cities like this is to compare Metropolitan Statistical Areas, and in most wealth/income benchmarks, the Buffalo Niagara MSA fares pretty well."

Buffalo,32k01g,FancyAndImportantMan,4,Tue Apr 14 18:36:24 2015 UTC,"Actually, there is a very good chance that Buffalo was named after the animal (or at least the creek the city was named after was named after the animal).  There is no evidence that that the French story actually happened.  Also, the range of the American Bison comes pretty close. Close enough where you would have seen the stray Buffalo in WNY every so often. Definitely close enough for natives to be familiar with the animal.  But yeah, the French story sounds a lot better.  Some other myths:   Buffalo is cold: sure compared to most if the country. Compared to the Midwest though, Buffalo's winters are pretty mild temperature wise. Buffalo-Niagara is decreasing in population: According to recent census estimates, the Metropolitan area is now growing again - albeit slightly. Buffalo is disgusting with all of its polluting factories - To be fair this was true until fairly recently. However, besides parts of Tonawanda and Niagara Falls, you don't encounter that harsh industrial smell anymore. A lot of the grime and carbon has been cleaned off buildings, so Buffalo actually looks pretty nice. Buffalo is a poor city: While Buffalo does have the 3rd highest poverty rate in the nation, people don't realize that 50% of the city classifies as middle class (or about the same population of Amherst). I don't mean to belittle the poverty issue either. Its still something we need to work on. This is the reason why Buffalo has one of the highest income disparities in the US.

Buffalo,32e07u,Ithacan,4,Mon Apr 13 00:36:37 2015 UTC,"He was in a tough spot. He did more than expected with not a lot of talent on the team. I liked him, but there are certainly better coaches out there."
Buffalo,32e07u,holdup_waitaminute,8,Mon Apr 13 01:03:41 2015 UTC,"Nolan is an excellent coach.    He was used to play a roll. Having served his purpose the franchise did what they planned on doing. It sucks, I would prefer that he is kept but it is Not exactly shocking news either. It is shocking that irbe was relieved of duties."
Buffalo,32e07u,LeJourLeFroid,3,Mon Apr 13 01:24:30 2015 UTC,I thought Irbe was retained. I saw a remark from GMTM that Irbe still has a year on his contract and that the new coach would have an impact on that decision.
Buffalo,32e07u,zjp_716,3,Mon Apr 13 02:30:26 2015 UTC,"Huh, I saw different but I may have glanced over it. He may be retained."
Buffalo,32e07u,LeJourLeFroid,4,Mon Apr 13 03:13:52 2015 UTC,"He hasn't NOT been retained.  Per Murray's press conference, he has one year left on his contract with the club.  The capacity in which he could stay with the club has not yet been determined.  The next coach may choose to consider him for the goalie coach.  Else he may take on another role within the organization.  Else he may be gone."

Somebody had to take the fall for the tank job; if he had been kept around, it would've been that much more obvious that the Sabres tanked on purpose.  Only question now is, who comes in?  Damn -- I wish we could get Quenneville (who I wanted years ago)"
Buffalo,32e07u,716in619,3,Mon Apr 13 05:09:13 2015 UTC,"Did you listen to the press conference?  That's not the sense that Murray imparted at all.  He praised Nolan repeatedly over and over again and actually heaped a bunch of blame on himself and/or on them both jointly.    What he is doing with Nolan is precisely NOT scapegoating him.  He is making the far more nuanced point that he wants someone who shares something more of a similar agenda and that he wants the best coach possible to acquire.  That Nolan doesn't fit either of those criteria shouldn't be a point of debate (but also has little to do with your original point).    Excepting retirement press conferences, this had about the least amount of blame shifting and some of the most responsibility assumption that I've ever seen with an outgoing coach."
Buffalo,32e07u,Vhrix,1 point,Mon Apr 13 13:03:54 2015 UTC,"He praised Nolan repeatedly over and over again   ""You're great and deserve a lot of credit blah blah blah.  ""But you're still fired."""
Buffalo,32e07u,716in619,1 point,Mon Apr 13 20:30:11 2015 UTC,Indeed.  But firing != scapegoating.
Buffalo,32e07u,Vhrix,2,Mon Apr 13 21:45:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think he is a scapegoat, I think Tim Murray doesn't get along with him for whatever reason. Take a look at Jim Harbaugh in San Francisco. If the GM/owner and the HC don't get along, the coach is gone no matter how well he's doing. Given the desert of talent on that team the past two seasons no one expected them to win. He wasn't fired for the terrible results as much as he was for the disconnect with Murray. The losses sure didn't help either though."

Buffalo,32dgkb,silent_scorpion,5,Sun Apr 12 23:52:59 2015 UTC,I would enjoy reading a public comment about their company culture.
Buffalo,32dgkb,marfalump,5,Mon Apr 13 02:02:38 2015 UTC,"It's a big company so your experiences are dependent on what department you're in. I'll break it down into my thoughts on my department and the entire company.  My department is mostly quants, we have a work hard play hard mentality. I really enjoy my job, sometimes stressful but every day is different and super challenging. Everyday I'm learning something new. My direct line of management is awesome, they really respect everybody's ideas and input, my current boss is probably the best boss I've ever had.  Note that I came from working at start ups, so to me M&T has a very conservative and strict corporate culture. Everybody I seem to meet outside my department is super professional and very robotic. Most of senior management is super conservative and hard to adapt to newer ideas and technologies.   Overall, I really enjoy it, there's a lot of good training and learning. There's a lot of things M&T can improve on which allows for you to be able to do some cool things."
Buffalo,32dgkb,silent_scorpion,2,Mon Apr 13 02:48:08 2015 UTC,"I've been at M&T for eight years now; agree with most of this. Conservative; risk adverse and very proud of it. It's worked for them so far. I came from a smaller company, and I can say it's the best place I've every worked.  You can PM me with any specific questions? Welcome aboard."
Buffalo,32dgkb,dcampbez,4,Mon Apr 13 03:06:51 2015 UTC,we have a work hard play hard mentality.   I cringe every time I read/hear anyone say this about their job.
Buffalo,32dgkb,surewhynotwth,3,Mon Apr 13 14:55:56 2015 UTC,Yep me too. I'm not even sure what play hard means. It's such an office phrase. Might as well have said he has a case of the Mondays.
Buffalo,32dgkb,BZI,2,Mon Apr 13 15:26:06 2015 UTC,"I mean..it's pretty much what it sounds like...Like I said, I worked at a few start ups, where senior management would host weekly parties, keggers, casino parties...etc. They treat you well, but you're expected to work hard ~60-80 hours. My current department is the same way...it's in short saying, it's not the normal 40 hours/week white collar job..."
Buffalo,32dgkb,silent_scorpion,3,Mon Apr 13 17:08:43 2015 UTC,What's the big secret? M&t isn't exactly the Freemasons society. what? The colors weren't always green & white?    Share the company culture with the public.

Buffalo,32dgkb,Harvey6ft,4,Mon Apr 13 02:27:40 2015 UTC,"OP was asking for some general insight regarding company culture, not trade secrets.  I do understand the need to be guarded when discussing the company you work for, but some general comments on an anonymous forum like reddit should be harmless.    edit:  I retract my statement.  Stay safe.  Don't share information about your employer, especially on your standard reddit account."
Buffalo,32dgkb,marfalump,3,Mon Apr 13 03:15:53 2015 UTC,"And if you had some negative aspects of said company culture you wanted to share with OP before they began a career there?  Something that could be misconstrued as slander?  I've worked at places where that could definitely get you in trouble, even on Reddit.  I'm not saying M&T is like that, but why run the risk?  Besides, what do you care about M&T's culture?  OP's actually going to be working there.  You're just nosy at best."

Buffalo,32dgkb,ReverendBass,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:21:51 2015 UTC,"Say what you want, I don't care.  By this day and age, all major financial institutions have internal corporate policies that forbid employees from communicating through public channels any messages that in any way shape or form could be construed as official policy or positions of the bank without first having it approved by legal, marketing, and/or compliance departments.  Even if the communication through public channels is an opinion of an employee, the employee is at all times of employment a representation of the bank.  Most institutions have a social media policy as well by now and in most cases it's pretty restrictive.  Most employees probably have not read through these in full but know they exist and without knowing exactly what and what they are not permitted to say without having to worry about repercussions, simply choose not to say anything at all.  How could they track you? Should not be a difficult task for those in the industry of tracking such activities and those of which are far more complex than posting on Reddit."

Buffalo,32dgkb,john-was-here,1 point,Mon Apr 13 00:39:01 2015 UTC,"Former employee here.  I spent 5 years with M&T in a few different departments.  There is a lot of pride in working for M&T.  The bank is well-managed and respected in the industry.  They are heavily involved in the communities in which they do business, and corporate culture places the customer above all else, which IMO is the right way to approach things.  The downside is that it is damn near impossible to move up from within unless you are an EA. (You went to an Ivy League school and were recruited into a special sr mgmt track program).  Raises are non-existent. If you move internally, you will be given greater responsibility but you will not receive meaningful salary increases.  The company has no plan in place to retain employees who complete higher education...most employees who get their MBA while working for the bank end up leaving.    M&T relies on their stability to retain employees ""we don't pay a lot but you don't have to worry about us shutting down your department"".    It's a great resume-builder and you'll work with some great people, but don't expect to make it a life long career.  PM me if you have specific questions."

Most preservationists either like to sue to save things or protest at to be demoed sites. Most   Shea's was never in danger of destruction thanks to vigilant theatre lovers, Darwin was the result of a company not people and central terminal's restoration needs to be left to the professionals and not a group of wannabe urban planners, it's going to cost tens of millions to restore it"
Buffalo,328hpq,Stanczyki,19,Sat Apr 11 17:00:23 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about? Shea's was almost stripped of everything that was of value on the inside during the 80's and was saved by a small group of preservationists (granted who had money). The Terminal was also left for dead before the current group took it over, the main hall was wrecked before they started fixing it up. Are you saying that the Central Terminal should of just been left abandoned because a ""professional group"" wasn't going to take it over? Those wannabe urban planners know what they are doing, they just lack the capital to totally fix the place up. No one else in Western New York is trying to make an effort. There are also a lot of preservationists who are making an impact without working on huge million dollar projects. I know a lot of people involved with the Young Buffalo Preservationists and they are doing a ton  by investing in and renovating dilapidated housing through out the city ( my friends and I put a good amount of time renovating the building for the new Sugar City btw). Your comments just seem really dumb to me, shame on people for trying to save historical structures and invest into the city. The only big project that I can think of being shut down is the whole Bass Pro deal and look what we got, I'll take Canal Side and the Harbor Center any day over that mess."
Buffalo,328hpq,whirlpool138,-1,Sat Apr 11 17:29:16 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure those 'preservationists' were theater people who saved the theater in the 70s, but hey, the internet is not a source. Sure they became preservationists through their efforts, but that would be calling me one because I did work on a house from 1880.  I never said the Terminal should have been abandoned, don't put words in my mouth. I think their current effort is misguided as their restoration only allows the terminal to have events a few times a year, and nothing on a large scale either. We're coming to the point where someone could buy it and actually present an actual plan instead of a hodge podge of slow progress.  There are plenty of people trying to make an effort, look at all the businesses that have popped up in the last 5 years. Preservationists from their BRO armchairs criticize it all the time because it isnt good enough for them, would they rather go back to even a decade ago when the outlook was as bleak as ever?  Another person said that Buffalo's recovery is mainly because of the preservation tax credit. That is laughable and outright wrong.   Buffalo's revival is a few things: MULTIPLE types tax credits, easing up on business laws, businesses realizing Buffalo has a low CoL so backoffice employees can be put here (see: Geico, Citi, BoA, etc), the medical campus, which will make Buffalo even better in the next decade, Obamacare (look at the employment explosion at Fidelis, insurance companies are growing here). To say its because of preservation is a joke and shows you know very little of how the real world works.   That's nice of your friends to put time into houses, are they still big houses that are too expensive to maintain.  The problem is, the majority of preservationists I speak with want to save EVERYTHING, and that isn't feasible. They seem to be the loudest voices and try to obstruct things. The majority of Buffaloians are tired of obstructionists impeding progress, and want to enter the 21st century already, be it preservationists, people like Mary Ann Rizzo, or the older generation trying to hold onto their old ways."
Buffalo,328hpq,Stanczyki,11,Sun Apr 12 21:27:09 2015 UTC,Those companies are led by preservationist minded people. Otherwise they would have torn down the structures for something new.  Preservationist does not always equal you're typical protester activist on the street.  Some actually do have money and they in fact put it where their mouth is.
Buffalo,328hpq,Eudaimonics,5,Sat Apr 11 17:16:53 2015 UTC,"You sound very bitter. The majority of Buffalo's recent developments have been as a direct result of the Preservation Tax Credit. Hopefully in the next few years we'll reach a point where all the low hanging fruit has been redeveloped and we start to see some of the many, many parking lots built on - don't forget that over 50% of Downtown was demolished and much of that is still surface parking. I'm curious, what developments are you referring to when you talk about obstruction? Bass Pro?  As for the brick streets, they are traffic calmer, they are more pervious and thus much better at reducing stormwater runoff, and it can be argued that they improve property values. Imagine if all of Arlington Park/College St was brick, it would be incredible."
Buffalo,328hpq,WhitleyStrieber,3,Sat Apr 11 20:40:10 2015 UTC,"And for the 7 months out of the year that it snows, they are impossible to plow without either damaging or turning into a sheet of ice.   We don't have brick roads here for the same reason you rarely see exposed aggregate concrete sidewalks. The same ""drainage/runoff"" you mentioned become nothing but unsafe in the winter."
Buffalo,328hpq,sevenoneSICKs,2,Sun Apr 12 02:29:04 2015 UTC,We have a good amount. In South Buffalo there are quite a few actually and I don't see the issues you seem to. Show me a road in WNY that doesn't get fucked up during winters.

Buffalo,328eer,monsieurvampy,1 point,Sun Apr 12 03:49:47 2015 UTC,"My suggestion would be to do minimal work to keep the building standing. Create a focal point of development at Broadway and Fillmore. Also, push for the Fillmore National Historic District Nomination that is currently in the works. Once enough development has taken place, then consider options. The Station would need be multi-use.    Tower to be used for offices Obtain ownership of the train concourse  Build a ""modern"" bridge to connect the station to the concourse that allows current trains to pass through. Encourage Amtrak (one day it will stop being underfunded) to use the station and close the Exchange Street and Depew Street Station.  Brewery The baggage building and others could be used for lofts or office. Some buildings would need to be purchased."

Your best bet is a lot near the First Niagara Center - which are always empty during the day. You can then take a 5 minute metrorail ride.  If you are coming from an area where you are within a 10 minute drive of UB South, I would consider using the Park and Ride and taking the Metro down. A monthly pass might save you money on parking, gas and mileage in the long term."

And, yes, that means in bike lane too, as well as auto travel lanes.  Secondly, NYS doesn't have a mandated cycle lane law (Thankfully).  NYS law for cyclists is AFRAP (As far right as possible).  This means taking the travel lane if needed.  So, since the cycle lane was blocked, you can take the travel lane.

It's kinda like a video I watched a while back where a cyclist circled back to call a cop out on a U-turn (Again, legal for cops, even if not for civilians).  Cops are dicks, I get it.  It doesn't help anyone to act like a dick to cops.  Rule #1 of the internet (And real life):  Don't be a dick."
Buffalo,3201rd,SoBuffaloRes,56,Sat Apr 11 01:12:10 2015 UTC,"Emergency vehicles, by law, are allowed to park in fire lanes, bike lanes, and many other places where parking is not allowed, regardless of whether they are currently in an emergency situation. Even unmarked emergency vehicles are allowed this privilege.  That said, the cop probably shouldn't have been parked in the bike lane in this instance."
Buffalo,3201rd,nonethewiser,38,Thu Apr 9 23:22:24 2015 UTC,I believe the reason for this being allowed is so they can respond quickly to an emergency call that could come in at any moment...even times like this when they are running inside real quick to get their pizza.

Buffalo,3201rd,T17SAM,13,Thu Apr 9 22:02:41 2015 UTC,"I'm an avid cyclist, as I do not drive, so cycling is my primary means of transportation. Not to sound like a tool, but I managed to ride my bike all throughout this past winter, save for the initial November storm.       Having established my status as an 'asshole-hipster-bicyclist', I'm going to go ahead and state that this exchange seems totally unnecessary. Yes, he was absolutely blocking the lane, but that's par for the course on this stretch of Elmwood, and he wasn't blocking the line-of-sight. If you want to take issue with someone and post it on the interwebz, why not confront any number of box-truck drivers that block the lane and obstruct the view of traffic, which presents a very real danger to cyclists and occurs almost daily?     EDIT: Also, I feel that as a whole, this video is counter-productive to building a constructive relationship between the BPD and cyclists in this city, due to how your buddy approached the officer, and the editing of the video. The officer-in-question was being quite friendly at the beginning of the exchange, and the manner in which the video cuts off is blatantly misleading, at best. Look into the conflicts between Critical Mass protesters and the BPD in the early 2000's to see how this kind of situation used to be handled (Mike Niman wrote a series of articles on the matter that are available online). If, in fact, your friend was able to resolve the situation amicably, we deserve to see that, as opposed to the inflammatory nonsense presented here."

OP thought he really ""got"" the cop on this one, but it's him that comes across as looking like a complete tool. I know this may not fit into the narrative that ""All Cops are Dicks"", but if the cop would have been parked far away and got a call it would have taken him that much longer to respond. Even though they are afforded breaks a lot of cops don't actually take one.  The video also cut out, which to me also further proves the point that the cop was probably really cool.

BUT! that does not mean double parking or blocking a lane, even though a bicyclist could very easily have gone around the vehicle, as bicyclists are not restricted to the bicycle lane by any means.     Like anyone else, they ought to find the most unobtrusive place to park illegally.       To me, this is the equivalent of an officer blocking a one way road that has parking on both sides, holding of thru traffic, just to talk to a friend on the street.     the officer should have parked on the corner of all the illegal spots to choose from.     oh well."

Buffalo,3201rd,forza101,3,Fri Apr 10 05:59:39 2015 UTC,"It's a couple things. You can't always immediately and safely overtake a bike. Some people just sit in the middle of the lane and now you have to try to get out while being significantly slower than traffic. This doesn't happen often.  The big thing, I think, it that it's just a disruption of the norm. When there's a bike I pay special attention and worry about giving them enough room - oh I need to turn soon, what are they doing? I can get ahead of them, but is it safe? Do I just sit and wait and hold up traffic instead?  That's the kind of thing running through my head when there's a bike nearby. Otherwise I'm just in the usual routine and thinking about whatever.  Part of it is the time. It's not just a minute tops if there's much any traffic at all and you wish to go about things safely and you don't have much advance warning of the bike. It's also an issue of somewhat disrupting traffic and causing me to do something somewhat more dangerous to avoid moving at bike-speed the rest of the way to my destination.  It's also about taking me out of my routine while I try not to kill the damned guy wandering about traffic practically naked."

What happened a lot to me was that a car would drive ahead, slow down, and then we would play the ""go, no you go"" game. It's almost always more time consuming than just waiting, holding cars back, and letting the cyclist go.  But yeah, it's kind of hard to drive one way all the time because the situation changed case by case."

As for OP, I think he was annoyed, like I was, that there was a car blocking the lane (but it turns out that it's legal). It's not so much that he has to take an extra 5 seconds to go around, it's the fact that the car should not have (at least to our previous knowledge) been there to begin with. It's a different story when a cyclist is in the lane, riding legally, and drivers have to wait to safely pass."
Buffalo,3201rd,SoBuffaloRes,3,Fri Apr 10 06:00:08 2015 UTC,You're driving down Elmwood anyway. Half of that street doesn't have a marked bike lane and there are enough lights keeping traffic moving slow. You can legally and pretty easily get around this.

Buffalo,3201rd,SoBuffaloRes,2,Fri Apr 10 14:56:24 2015 UTC,Many motorist will see a bike lane and assume that a cyclist HAS to ride in the bike lane.

Many times there is dangerous debris or even worse storm drains that are not bike tire friendly.

Buffalo,31z50o,moar_distractions,3,Thu Apr 9 12:12:47 2015 UTC,Alternatively he could take public transportation.  This means he would have to take a bus downtown to catch a bus to the Falls anyways.
Buffalo,31z50o,Eudaimonics,2,Thu Apr 9 12:29:22 2015 UTC,Busing in from the airport is a pain in the ass though and this guy is on vacation. OP should try and rent a car.
Buffalo,31z50o,LonelyNixon,1 point,Thu Apr 9 13:43:54 2015 UTC,"Busing in from the airport is a pain in the ass though   I'm inclined to agree unless OP can catch the 204 Airport-Downtown Express. It's fast, direct, and costs $2. For some reason though, NFTA doesn't seem to consider that people may need to get to/from the airport in the middle of the day."
Buffalo,31z50o,itwentok,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:55:25 2015 UTC,"I'd never bus with luggage especially in a city I don't know. Work travel means car or cab, probably less demand than you think."
Buffalo,31z50o,moar_distractions,1 point,Thu Apr 9 23:57:44 2015 UTC,"I've taken the 204 and it's more like a shuttle than a normal bus. Not sure how much demand there is, but it would not kill them to run it once or twice an hour all day. Having it available only at certain times suppresses demand because it ends up being too much trouble to plan on using it."

Buffalo,31z50o,Eudaimonics,4,Fri Apr 10 23:22:24 2015 UTC,If you like architecture Buffalo has amazing buildings. You could drive into downtown on the 33 and check it out. I would recommend you get a detailed plan on where to go and what to see.
Buffalo,31z50o,memebuster,3,Thu Apr 9 12:04:26 2015 UTC,"You could drive by Grand Central Terminal, that's not too far from the airport I don't think.   I'd recommend Elmwood Village but there's not going to be too much going on, on a Tuesday.   Maybe just go see City Hall, it's a masterpiece and you'll drive by some great buildings on your way in."

Buffalo,31z50o,WorkAccount716,2,Thu Apr 9 13:32:18 2015 UTC,This time of year it's a bit difficult to traverse but I recommend taking a walk from the falls north to the hiking paths by the gorge. There's one close by that lets you walk south towards the falls but I recommend the Whirlpool State Park which is about 2 miles further north. You have to traverse down some majorly uneven steps to get to the river side but then you can take the trail right up to the Whirlpool and just enjoy nature. It's a totally immersive experience and it's one of my favorite places in the area. The trail does get mucky and there's some boulder climbing but if my 44 year old fat ass can do it anyone can. Here's a shitty government site that briefly touches on the trails:  http://www.nfwhc.org/parks/gorge.htm
Buffalo,31z50o,blackpony04,2,Thu Apr 9 15:30:49 2015 UTC,I'd recommend that you just pop downtown and take an architecture tour or any of the other numerous tours available in the city.  The architecture tour will take you to the observation deck of city hall.    More recommendations could be made based on how much time you have to do something & what sort of transportation you will have access to.

Buffalo,31z50o,ohmftw,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:57:02 2015 UTC,"Ok here are the top things to check out:   Buffalo City Hall - Free observation deck (third tallest city hall in the US). Also, be sure to catch the free daily tour that starts at noon. Albright-Knox Art Gallery - Picasso, Warhol, Van Gogh, etc. Also checkout the other venues in the museum district: Buffalo History Museum and Penney Burchfield Gallery. Olmsted Designed Delaware Park is right there to check out as well. Teddy Roosevelt Inauguration National Historic Site: Where the president took the oath of office following the assassination of William McKinley at the 1901 World's Fair. Erie County and Buffalo Naval Park - Largest inland naval park in the country. Nice small museum and you have three large WWII vessels to tour. Walkable Historic Neighborhoods - This is why locals and visitors end up falling in live with Buffalo. You probably wont have all that much time to explore but check out Allentown, Elmwood Village and North Buffalo/Hertel Ave.   If you are looking for nightlife in the Falls, you might as well just head back down to Buffalo (though I suppose Clifton Hill can be fun on occasion). Buffalo has a 4 am last call and multiple districts catering to multiple tastes."

Buffalo,31w81z,Instantcretin,5,Wed Apr 8 20:12:30 2015 UTC,"They really should switch to using pizza ovens instead of conveyor belt toasters to cook. Their dough would be better, which would really take the pizza to the next level."
Buffalo,31w81z,dagm20,0,Wed Apr 8 20:24:40 2015 UTC,You have some data on the quality of dough as it relates to the type of oven it's cooked in or...?
Buffalo,31w81z,TechnicallyMagic,3,Wed Apr 8 22:54:11 2015 UTC,"Read the part about the dough. It's soft, chewy, not cooked through very well. That's because of how it's cooked, not because of the dough its self. Pizza dough is a really simple thing to make and most places use the exact same recipe. I've worked at a few pizza places in the area and I know this first hand.  Unless you mess up the ratio of flour and water, or put in too much or not enough yeast or salt, then the quality of the cooked pizza dough is 100% based on how it's cooked."
Buffalo,31w81z,dagm20,4,Thu Apr 9 00:44:32 2015 UTC,Yea like hydraulic Hearth by larkinville uses a wood fired rock slab style pizza oven. Perfect crispy yet chewy crusts. That plus it's so hot in the oven (~700) pizzas cook in like 3-5 min

Prior is a very professional environment, but it will cost more money and flying in/out of a Class C airport can consume a lot of time better spent really flying.

Buffalo,31xjd1,RVAGOD,1 point,Thu Apr 9 05:29:59 2015 UTC,"Meh, take it for what it is, makes no nevermind to me, tbh.  Don't get me wrong, I was already in my industry working when I attended school, so most of the classes where ""review"" for me, which made it so I could graduate much faster, and spend less on tuition.  I mean, I'll go into the bad part of it too:  No credit transfer anywhere else (Other than other for-profit colleges here like B&S, Medaille, etc etc), base costs very expensive ($450/ch when I attended), very easy to traipse through class and barely pass, etc etc etc.  Some more good (Which I really, really wish ECC would copy):  Your schedule is easily built, and you know exactly what books/materials you will need for every single class.  None of the ""Show up the first day, to really find out what books/materials you'll need"".  Enrollment process is dead simple at ITT, contrasted with ECC where it's a fscking maze to find your way through (UB and Buff State are the same as well here).  There's classes to meet anyone's schedule (ie, try working full time and getting a CS degree at a SUNY school).  Homework load is very low, none of the ""Do 67 problems in your text book, oh, and by the way, it's due day after tomorrow.  Oh, you're on call?  Sorry.""  I think what kills most people is they fail to actually take into account a few things:  How much the total cost is for the entire degree program.  People end up dropping out half way through the program, which basically means you've flushed money down the drain.  And, hardly any students attempt a test out from any of the classes, which they are very open to doing.  Maybe things at ITT changed since I attended (2006), but there were no online labs, all labs were done in class, and were to be turned in by beginning of next class.  And, my instructors were proficient at what they were teaching."

First, the discretion to prosecute a state offense rests solely with the Erie County District Attorney's Office (or, rarely, with the New York State Attorney General). This issue aside, the New York State Legislature has not authorized any prosecutorial or law enforcement agency the power to enter into a contractual obligation to withdraw a charging instrument for the benefit of a private company. Such appears to be in excess of any law enforcement agency's jurisdiction, and the contract appears facially illegal. It will be interesting to see how this develops.

That said buffalo is pretty damn blighted and has a lot of downright sketchy and crummy neighborhoods. You got the first ward, large parts of the east side, west side, black rock is ok but it looks sketchy, the university ghetto neighborhoods like university heights and so on. Then there is downtown which is improving but still eeriely abandoned after 5.  Now buffalo can be beautiful. It can be great. But its hard to try to sweep the sketchy parts under the rug.

Then theres the lower East side if you literally mean ""lower Manhattan"".  I mean Wallstreet is empty but really our downtown is freakishly empty.  Besides most downtowns aren't like ny's downtown. Most downtowns in most cities serve the role Manhattan as a whole serves ny(only of course on a significantly smaller scale) .   I've traveled around the country too. A lot of people here live in this bubble as if buffalo is only Elmwood, Allen north buff, but the east side West side and crummy parts of South buff make up a huge chunk of this city. There is plenty to see here and the parks help hide our ghettos but let's not look at stats like how our crime rate is bananas and our rate of poverty and then pretend that it's all isolated to one easily avoidable tiny part of town."

This means while cities like Houston, gets to include every single wealthy suburb and exurb in their statistics, Buffalo is stuck with only the inner city neighborhoods. These statistics should be taken with a grain of salt. If you look at Erie County, the crime rate is about average.  Even Buffalo's worse neighborhoods have nothing on the worse neighborhoods of Chicago, Houston or LA.  And as I said, its pretty easy to avoid the blighted and high crime areas anyways."

They're also one of the most experienced in the world if I remember right. They did everything they could to make it a quick and easy process. The day of the procedure I was in and out of the building in 45 minutes. The doctors were really funny and gave me a new pair of glasses afterwards (two champagne glasses). They called me that night to see how I was doing. And I was able to drive the next morning. Through them I was able to finance it over two years without interest. And they said they'd do a touch up within a couple years if necessary.  Couldn't recommend them higher. I hope you choose them.

Buffalo,31qp8m,Tralala01,1 point,Tue Apr 7 13:32:41 2015 UTC,Any reason you chose Fichte Endl over Atwal or another place?
Buffalo,31qp8m,CleanBaldy,1 point,Tue Apr 7 13:36:18 2015 UTC,My mother had gotten it done there years ago and didn't have any problems. So I figured I didn't want to explore the unknown and risk it.
Buffalo,31qp8m,grasshopper_jo,4,Tue Apr 7 13:54:06 2015 UTC,"My mom actually went to Canada to get her eyes done. I forget where but partly because her vision was so bad, no one in Buffalo could do it and partly because it was half the cost. They did a fantastic job, she only needs reading glasses now vs glasses to see 1ft in front of her. I know you asked Buffalo but Canada is close enough I figured I'd offer another idea that could be cheaper."

Buffalo,31qp8m,Jjhockey01,3,Tue Apr 7 16:18:35 2015 UTC,"Fichte was awesome. I got mine done a long time ago - 13 years ago, so the price probably isn't relevant anymore. I did not regret it. It makes a huge difference, relatively easy, probably saved me money in the long run."
Buffalo,31qp8m,Toretto89,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:42:02 2015 UTC,Cost really isn't an issue for me. I am going to finance anyways but put a large chunk down with my tax return. When it comes to your vision you really can't put a price on it. Some of the horror stories are kind of freaking me out a little though.  Thanks for your input.
Buffalo,31qp8m,sstoveld,2,Thu Apr 9 01:49:50 2015 UTC,Eye Care Vision Associates is an excellent office. I would recommend them over all the rest. They have the best ophthalmologists I've ever met.

Buffalo,31qp8m,sstoveld,1 point,Tue Apr 7 12:37:27 2015 UTC,"I had mine done at Fichte just over two years ago. No complaints. I chose to go with the blade procedure. I had some fog and scratchiness after the procedure, but I was fantastic the next morning. It cost me around $1,300 for both eyes. I paid for it through my FSA. Also, if you have insurance, check if you have EyeMed. It saved me some cash. Also, go to the open house, they give you a voucher, I think for like $100 off each eye, something like that.  A lot of people don't like the blade procedure. The thing is, if it wasn't safe, they wouldn't be doing that procedure. I went for it, and I have had zero issues with it. I'd do it all over again."
Buffalo,31qp8m,NardDogNailedIt,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:22:00 2015 UTC,Why'd you choose the blade procedure? Because it was cheaper?

Buffalo,31qv2e,ubthethrowaway,8,Tue Apr 7 13:31:34 2015 UTC,"Got a buddy who lives in one of those north buff houses.  Fun fact those cookie cutter houses in north buff are called two flats. They are from the 20s so they have some charming oddities such as those old school steam radiators, and a bunch of old fashioned windows, and skeleton keyed doors. It's quite charming.  In terms of noise as long as they aren't stomping about it's all cool you can sometimes hear people if you're really quiet and like next to a radiator pipe but otherwise it's groovy.   Also living within the city especially a happening neighborhood like north buff is so much better than the burbs. North buff has grocery stores, big chains, local butchers,little boutique shops, movie theaters(fancy artsy and otherwise), bars, restaurants, and pharamacies, and so on. It's really walkable and a great place to live.   Also you're not that far from delaware park which is another bonus."

Buffalo,31iozk,maxwell7301,5,Sun Apr 5 17:31:40 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess it depends how suburban you want your living situation to be.  Orchard Park is definitely a nice area, but things are going to be decently spread out.  You'll need to drive most places, although there are some walkable villages around there.  The actual Village of Orchard Park is somewhat walkable.  East Aurora, which is close to Orchard Park, is extremely walkable and nice.  I usually recommend North Buffalo for people coming to the area.  It's safe and family friendly, a bit more suburban than the Elmwood Village, but it's still in the city.  The Hertel Avenue area is very walkable, and lots of new businesses are popping up.  North Buffalo rental prices are pretty decent.  It's a short drive from the Elmwood Village, Allentown and Downtown, and it's also not far from Kenmore/Tonawanda and Amherst."
Buffalo,31iozk,Revernd,7,Sun Apr 5 21:10:01 2015 UTC,"Hi,  Actual OP resident here.  I'm not sure what Flan or the rest are going on about.  Sure, we get some more snow, but the area is nice, and you aren't bunched all together.  We got a lot of Snow in November sure, but that was a storm that hasn't happened since '06.  It's not like this is some nightly occurrence.  So let's get that out of the way first.  Secondly, I don't know what suburbs are so horrible that you wouldn't want to be there.  Maybe Tonawanda, or Lackawanna but that's it.  OP and the surrounding area are awesome.  Chestnut Ridge for Hiking, the Stadium for Bills games, plus awesome local bars and eateries.    As for the apartments.  Hammocks are a love it/hate it relationship.  I've heard mixed reviews myself.  Village Square are nice, though can be outdated as with Armor Heights.  I'd stay away from Green Lake apartments, though those tend to be the most modern of all the options here in OP.  Don't let the others get you down. The suburbs of Buffalo have a lot to offer.  Any other questions I'd be happy to answer!  Edit:  Lancaster, which is in the Northtowns has had more Snow this year compared to OP.  74 and 71 inches respectively."
Buffalo,31iozk,buffalo442,1 point,Sun Apr 5 15:25:10 2015 UTC,"Lancaster isn't the northtowns, isn't the southtowns - it's an eastern suburb and almost due east from the city.  Lancaster typically gets more snow than the northern suburbs (Amherst, Tonawanda, etc) but less than the southern ones (OP, Hamburg, etc).  Nothing wrong with Tonawanda either.  There's a couple of dumpy areas (I wouldn't live next to Tonawanda Coke, for instance), but for the most part it's good."

Buffalo,31iozk,maxwell7301,1 point,Sun Apr 5 21:31:58 2015 UTC,"Clarence usually gets lumped in with Amherst, so it's a Northtown.  I feel like Akron and Alden are far enough out not to be grouped in to any of these ""towns"" designations.  It's a stretch to call them suburbs, in my opinion.    They are still in the Buffalo metro area, but they are more like exurbs than suburbs."

Buffalo,31iozk,buffalo442,3,Sun Apr 5 15:42:30 2015 UTC,"I have neighbours on either side, I can and do walk into the Center of the village, we hold countless of community events, and can walk tons of cool places here.  I don't see how that qualifies as us not being a proper 'community'?  Again, not looking to start a fight here.  Just relating my experiences here in OP."
Buffalo,31iozk,flancresty,1 point,Sun Apr 5 15:52:41 2015 UTC,If you live in an apartment that has snow removal (like most do) that's not much of a concern.  If you have a house with a driveway and sidewalks you need to clear then I understand that.

Buffalo,31iozk,MGNero3,2,Mon Apr 6 13:14:46 2015 UTC,I live around the corner from Canterbury court and it always looks nice. Can't speak to how clean it is but it looks nice! Check artvoice for ads in other houses.  As for elmwood vs OP you just need to find out what lifestyle you want. City life vs suburbs.
Buffalo,31iozk,FancyAndImportantMan,2,Sun Apr 5 15:37:35 2015 UTC,I also live right around the corner from Canterbury and have a friend that lives in those buildings. For the most part they are great. His only complaint is in the winter they really crank the heat.
Buffalo,31iozk,WorkAccount716,2,Sun Apr 5 15:56:24 2015 UTC,"I work part-time in Orchard Park and it's nice enough. However a good chunk of it is sprawled out and unless you live right in downtown, there's not many places you can walk.  Elmwood is amazing. I can't recommend that enough to young people moving to the city."
Buffalo,31iozk,Common_loon,2,Sun Apr 5 17:10:02 2015 UTC,"Dude, make the hour drive from Rochester with your girlfriend and pound the pavement and see what area you like.    As user Eudaimonics pointed out this is a lifestyle question if you are debating Elmwood versus Orchard Park.  It's basically city versus suburbs.  I grew up in OP and also lived in the Elmwood Village as an adult.    Elmwood Village has great restaurants and nightlife.  One negative would be lack of parking, so try to find something with off street parking.  Also there are panhandlers in the summer.    Orchard Park is a quiet and safe suburb.  There is less diversity there.  There's a couple of bars and restaurants in the center of town (four corners)."
Buffalo,31iozk,dan_blather,2,Sun Apr 5 21:39:20 2015 UTC,Lived in Canturbury Court. They are excellent and very very quiet. They have a well maintained courtyard in the center of the complex which is always great to look at in the warm months. I would recommend it to anyone.
Buffalo,31iozk,Eudaimonics,2,Mon Apr 6 00:05:15 2015 UTC,"Orchard Park as Fairport?    One thing to remember - suburban Buffalo and suburban Rochester are really quite different. It comes down to Buffalo's historically blue collar economy and culture.  The Northtowns -- Tonawanda, Kenmore, Amherst, Williamsville, and Clarence -- are the functional equivalent of the area from Irondequoit down to Brighton, Penfield, Pittsford, etc.  They're denser. and much less sylvan and ""quainty quaint"", than Rochester's wealthier burbs, though - think more like what you'd see in Oakland County, Michigan or east suburban Cleveland.   There is no equivalent to the Easttowns in suburban Rochester.  Cheektowaga, Sloan, and Depew are very Polish, very blue collar, almost solidly lower middle class, and culturally very Old Buffalo.  Lancaster is something of a move-up suburb, but still culturally leaning Old Buffalo.  Commercial areas can be hard on the eyes compared to their suburban Rochester equivalents, and neighborhoods can be cut up by railroad and industrial corridors.    The Southtowns are mixed.  OP and East Aurora are more middle- to upper-middle class, white collar, and more sylvan and quaint like eastern Monroe County.  Hamburg and West Seneca are more middle class, but more blue-collar leaning, kind of like Lancaster.    Niagara County - no Rochester equivalent.  It's kind of like what Northwest Indiana is to Chicago - very industrial, hard on the eyes, but growing thanks to lower property taxes.  Niagara Falls is kind of like an Italian-American version of Gary.  Really, not as bad as Gary, but not as nice as ... oh, Utica.  The ""Westtowns"", if one could call the Canadian suburbs that - if you don't have a passport, they're about as relevant as Australia or New Zealand.  Even if you did, you can't really live there.  Even if you could live there, housing and daily expenses are very expensive compared to the States."
Buffalo,31iozk,BuffRisingCommenter,2,Mon Apr 6 16:01:34 2015 UTC,"Depends on the type of lifestyle you are looking for.  OP is nice, but it is also very suburban, bland and pretty boring. If you are a set of young 20-somethings looking for a vibrant neighborhood and being within walking distance of entertainment, nightlife, boutiques and restaurants, then it definitely not the place for you.  The Village of Orchard Park does offer some walkability and there are a good collection of restaurants and a few shops, but its really not even close to the same scale as living in Elmwood or even a larger village like East Aurora.  Commuting will likely be a breeze. You have the 400 and 219 passing through Orchard Park, so there are plenty of ways to get into the city. Expect a 45 minute commute during rush hour at worse (maybe more if you move to the furthest fringes).  If you cannot afford Elmwood, you're probably not going to be able to afford OP either though.   Don't be afraid of looking within a few blocks of Elmwood either.   Also, check into Allentown or North Buffalo. Those neighborhoods have lively commercial districts as well. West side would be a good option too. Just obviously scope out the area as the Westside is very much block by block, though within 10 years the entire area will be just as nice as Elmwood itself at the rate it is gentrifying.  You might also want to look into places along the Metrorail. This way you won't need to worry about parking downtown.  Also, a lot more apartments open up at the beginning of the summer when out-of-town Buffalo State and UB students go back home for the summer. Check back in May and June and there will be no lack of options."
Buffalo,31iozk,flancresty,1 point,Sun Apr 5 19:08:25 2015 UTC,"Northtowns, Southtowns, Easttowns, it doesn't matter what you call them.  The suburbs are all the Sucktowns, as far as I'm concerned."
Buffalo,31iozk,Revernd,1 point,Mon Apr 6 12:21:29 2015 UTC,"Don't fucking do it. For one thing, if you live in OP, you'll get 10x the snow Elmwood or the north half of the city does.  Literally. OP folks got 7 feet in November, North Buffalo got 4 inches. Second, the suburbs are horrible."
Buffalo,31iozk,Eudaimonics,6,Sun Apr 5 13:51:26 2015 UTC,"1 anomaly does not account for a full experience.  We haven't had a storm like that since '06.    The suburbs aren't horrible, if anything, better than the city. Elmwood has its perks, I cannot deny that, but by no means are the suburbs horrible."
Buffalo,31iozk,flancresty,2,Sun Apr 5 15:26:25 2015 UTC,"Really depends on the lifestyle you're looking to live.  For most young people, the suburbs are not exactly the most exciting places to be."
Buffalo,31iozk,Revernd,1 point,Sun Apr 5 19:14:19 2015 UTC,"It's not anomalous that the southtowns get a shitload of snow when there's lake effect and the northtowns do not. Yes, the November storm was historic, but that pattern holds true.  As for better than the city, that's obviously a total judgment call. If you like spending your life in your car rather than outside walking and interacting with your fellow humans, sure the suburbs sound great. If you aren't afraid of people who look different than you and think that walkable communities make healthy citizens, then the city is where it's at.  OTOH: If you like public services and schools that aren't poor to terrible, the suburbs are your jam."
Buffalo,31iozk,flancresty,4,Sun Apr 5 15:41:11 2015 UTC,"Right, but you're stating ""7 feet"" like it happens ever winter, which simply isn't true.  For example, we didn't have snow Christmas of this year.  As is saying the city is better.  OP is a fantastic place to walk through town, with David's, Mangia's new Patio, as well as Green Lake and Chestnut Ridge.  To say we spend all of our time in the car is erroneous as best.  Taste of OP, 4th of July, the Ice Cream Social, as well as countless other town events bring people in all the time.   You bring diversity in as if somehow living in the suburbs means you're scared of different people?  If that's not complete and total bias, then I don't know what is.  Again, you're entitled to your own opinion, but to insinuate that folks that live in the suburbs are somehow scared of people of various ethnic, religious, economical or otherwise backgrounds is just borderline absurd.  I can understand why people love the city, as I can those that live in rural settings.  The suburbs of Buffalo have so much to offer, both the North and Southtowns.    I'm not looking to start a fight, you have your opinion and I have mine.  I can see where you're coming from, but I just don't believe you've actually spent enough time here to make such claims.  As for the OP, it boils down to what you're most looking for; Park Ave or Fairport.  Have a good one, Flan."
Buffalo,31iozk,Revernd,0,Sun Apr 5 15:48:35 2015 UTC,"Right, but you're stating ""7 feet"" like it happens ever winter, which simply isn't true.    No I didn't. I said OP gets 10x the lake effect snow the northtowns do, and used the Nov. storm as an example.  All those great places you talk about, how do you get there? And how do you get to work? And how do you get your kids to school? And how do you get to the bar you hang out at, the restaurant at which you eat? How many OP residential streets have sidewalks? Are safe for kids to walk or bike on?  How many days a week do you not drive your car?"
Buffalo,31iozk,NewUserFromBuffalo,3,Sun Apr 5 15:52:36 2015 UTC,"The way it comes off, at least to me and I'm sure others, is that we get insane amounts of snow each year, which just isn't true.  You can walk to all those places except work.     -I drive.  I'd have to drive if I was in the city though, since I work in the Northtowns. -I don't have kids, but nevertheless, there are school-buses for a reason. -All the restaurants are right in town and easy walking distance from all the apartment complexes OP mentioned as well as my house.  The same for the Bars in town.  -I don't drive 2-3 days a week.  Though I don't see how that would matter since in my case, I'd have to anyways."

Buffalo,31ed24,K04free,36,Sat Apr 4 06:50:54 2015 UTC,It's not worth the stress of finding and beating him up. Be glad it was some dumb college kid who'd ride it around ub and not anybody else because you probably would not have found that bike otherwise.
Buffalo,31ed24,LonelyNixon,16,Sat Apr 4 07:21:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah dude - the simple fact that you caught him, got your bike back and probably scared/humiliated the shit out of him would be plenty satisfaction for me.  Not worth getting knifed over or whatever."

Buffalo,31ed24,TLunge12,1 point,Sun Apr 5 04:13:56 2015 UTC,"Get a better lock for it. In the pic you posted I saw you post was one of those slinky wire locks that could be cut with some arts and crafts scissors. It takes seconds to cut through that lock. You need something a little more serious like a kryptonite ulock and even with that, with the right tool its stolen in minutes. There is no perfect lock, just better locks that take more time to get through. I went a step further and had custom axels put on - http://www.amazon.com/Pinhead-Bicycle-Locking-Skewer-Pack/dp/B000XHBKOU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1405437437&sr=8-1&keywords=pinhead+locking  This set exactly to prevent my wheels and headset from being stolen. If they have the right tools, they can strip your bike of all the parts while its locked up. I think is comes with the seat lock as well. Just dont lose that key and if you do, keep the packaging.   A trick they do down here in NYC is they pop a tire and hope you leave it over night, so they just steal it while its quiet out. Personally I want to avoid flats at all costs so I have puncture resistent tubes and schwalbe marathon plus tires. They are a bit thicker and I got away with running over a 3/4"" nail. http://www.amazon.com/Schwalbe-Marathon-700x28-Allround-Beaded/dp/B0025XOWP4/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1429632411&sr=8-2&keywords=schwalbe+marathon+plus"

Buffalo,31benm,K04free,26,Fri Apr 3 15:17:03 2015 UTC,"Three things I learned from having my bike stolen (and getting it back):  1) always have a picture of your serial number on your phone, and email it to yourself in case you lose it. There's no dispute if that's the same bike or a different bike of the same model that way.  2) bring a copy your police report to local bike shops, especially Rick's Cycle on Allen. Check back with them periodically and ask to see their trade in stock. Do not take no for an answer when you ask to check out Rick's basement, which was where my bike was living for about 4 months (without them calling me).  3) watch Craig's list like a hawk. If you find someone selling a bike suspiciously like yours arrange a meetup to buy it back and bring the police/campus safety. It might be worth it to hold that meet up in a public place in Amherst and ask the Amherst police, as they are much more responsive than Buffalo PD.   Good luck, hope you get it back."

Buffalo,31bffl,cTrollAltDel,2,Fri Apr 3 16:13:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The fact is buffalo uses the internet quite a bit, its like every home has almost 3 devices or more now in this day and age, and with the file sizes of photos and videos increasing due to evolving technology, 50/5 for around $70 a month or 30/5 for $60 is just terrible, While download may not be too bad, but for a house with 5 devices in use at all time that also runs off streaming services, I can tell you we are bottlenecked by these speeds."

I think I know what you are exactly talking about being a necessity, but surprisingly you would be shocked that in this day and age its becoming more and more of one.  I say this because, Lets take NYC for example, They are practically putting Free Wifi 1GBps setups around for communities because it's just used that darn much.   While maybe cities like buffalo may not be anywhere near as demanding to have that done, It just shows its starting to happen.  Though I do agree if you don't use it, it shouldn't be charged, But if they do something like that to where free wifi spots are made like a public park and anyone can use them if they can access it, I think a small little fee to help fund a project like this wouldn't be too bad.

Also if you look here, you can see the setup we have in buffalo. http://www.fibertech.com/networks/current-markets/buffalo-ny/  Now looking at the link below, Ill use Custom Canvas off seneca st as a example which is right by me about 3 blocks total away from me.  You can see the services that can be given and Fibertech ""Dark Fiber"" offered services there. Now if we worked with Fibertech, Upgraded equipment, and got home use, we could expect these speeds possibly, We would just have to expand the lines to residential areas, which couldn't be too bad for us seeing that EVERY main street practically has a line so if we add on to those somehow, I think it would be fine.  http://www.broadbandmap.gov/internet-service-providers/775-seneca-st-buffalo,-ny-14210/lat=42.8755774/long=-78.84834160000003/  Ill use a church just for a example that doesn't have a fiber line on fibertech website but has the possibility of still getting said 1gbps speeds.  http://www.broadbandmap.gov/internet-service-providers/668-clinton-st-buffalo,-ny-14210/lat=42.8812633/long=-78.84969710000001/  While all information are just examples ect.

Buffalo,31bffl,cTrollAltDel,2,Fri Apr 3 18:52:26 2015 UTC,"I did looked up the wikipedia for Dark Fibre Network before I asked and I was also previously aware of Fibertech. I was not aware that Fibertech is considered Dark Fiber, but I am aware that we have fiber lines laid for business. I've been wondering for months why it is that residential areas can't be provided access to these fiber lines. And I don't know if you have anything to add in regards to that, but I don't think you're talking out of your ass. You're probably one of the few who actually know about this situation and I just don't even understand why these lines were laid to begin with without considering the residents of the city. Like, how did this all happen and why is it that nobody seems to really know why things are the way they are or how to change them? I know you don't have all the answers but anything further you could add would be great."
Buffalo,31bffl,autowikibot,2,Fri Apr 3 19:43:04 2015 UTC,"Its more for business because it simply doesnt use ""high tech"" equipment for large scale resident usage probably if I remember right, its just basic stuff but puts out the speeds.   Not to mention Buffalo screwed theirself with that TWC contract or w/e to have them here and be the only ISP practically from what I remember. But now with the new FCC Stuff going into place, we can bring in new ISP's/Make Municiple though the municiple wasn't excluded just city had to do it theirself if they wanted a backup to the only ISP in town.  I really don't have much to add, I just know whats here after researching and learning into it over the years and wondering to myself why this happened.  But yeah, I really do hope something happens soon as I can't wait to not be screwed in price to performance for our internet.  With buffalo booming again and companies coming here ect. theres no reason we should use this crap internet at high costs and slow speeds where tons of people use internet every day.  Imagine when things go totally networked because we are sick of high cable prices and high internet prices and high phone prices.   I made the switch years ago for VOIP phone, Streaming ect. Because in all honesty, When the power in my house goes out we can't use the phone because its through cable and if theres a emergency and you can't use it why bother paying those prices?  Lets not forget, Lets take for example... WGRZ just had a water leak that damaged equipment, But is Live streaming online. Imagine if news stations started doing Live streams for the news on the internet, Another reason to cut cable out of the picture, Though this is probably 10-20 years away, It can catch on sooner, and be even better for those who just want internet, But can still also watch the news via a App or something on their ""Smart Tv's, Computers hooked to tv or just their computer setup alone ect."" Things like this are not out of the picture what so ever.  Especially if lets say you have cable already, take twc for example, streaming app they have right, so parents watch on main tv, kids watch on computer/phone/tablets ect. Or in their own rooms with a tv if they do, As sometimes people dont want all those extra boxes that costs extra monthly.  internet is powerful in many ways."
Buffalo,31bffl,cTrollAltDel,1 point,Fri Apr 3 21:12:29 2015 UTC,"I guess I'd be interested to know where to start looking for the difference between the ""basic"" business network and the ""high tech"" residential one.

Buffalo,31bffl,cTrollAltDel,2,Fri Apr 3 21:25:35 2015 UTC,"Yeap so true. I once again will say this, Besides the cable box and modem, I use NOTHING from TWC since it was Adelphia when we first got them atleast 15 years ago I wanna say maybe longer?... But we still use the same cable, same outside box interior electronics, ect. We never updated, its just not even worth having them come here to update our stuff because theres no reason to.  In all honesty, I am shocked TWC didnt renegotiate after it was up but I am glad."
Buffalo,31bffl,cTrollAltDel,1 point,Fri Apr 3 21:29:25 2015 UTC,"I've still yet to figure out why they didn't. Doesn't make sense to me.  And it's not just Buffalo. I was talking to some folks from Genesee County. Time Warner refused to renegotiate with them, too.  The only thing I can think of is that, if the agreement expired, they wouldn't have to pay that 5% of gross revenue that the agreement stipulates. Not sure, though; I'm asking folks in the City to look into that."

I was very disappointed with the museum as 90% of everything was geared towards younger kids. It will be great when we finally have children of our own but for two younger adults (25ish) it wasn't very enjoyable. I mean we would have loved to play with some of the exhibits but we didn't think it was appropriate to push the children out of the way haha.

Buffalo,318mm5,heyheythrowitaway,8,Fri Apr 3 07:20:31 2015 UTC,"My situation had me arriving in Buffalo from Australia with no real idea of what to expect.   On first sight, Buffalo was a greyish wasteland. With a hibernating population waiting to come up for air.  When they did surface, they injected life into a totally foreign landscape. The likes of which I'd never seen before. As the people warmed up, the city thawed and the beautiful greens and blues won me over.  As winter returned I was able to appreciate the beauty in the countryside and the city itself. The architecture is so very different to my city in Australia. European settlement in Australia is only 220 or so years old, so there's no high-rise buildings with any age about them here.  Buffalo city hall is wonderful, and was my first real exposure to art-deco. And the love affair with 30's - 60's lifestyle and design just carried on from there."

Then we would pick up a pepperoni pizza from mister pizza, and a black cherry 2 litre. Still , every Thursday when we are all home, from college or elsewhere, we get a pizza from mister pizza.

Buffalo,317zgi,ooppoop,9,Mon Apr 13 03:57:53 2015 UTC,"The health system is the exact reason why many people fall into this predicament. The over prescribing of powerful legal opiates leads to addiction every day. When the person that does these cannot find their drug of choice or their prescription runs out they turn to illegal means which in turn fuels the illegal drug market. Supply = Demand  Anyone who is prescribed these medications for the long term becomes addicted to them. Which I am sure a percentage of these 13 people started doing these drugs legally. It's tough for the people who are legally prescribed these medications to look at themselves in the mirror and decide they are addicts, which is exactly what they are."

I am speaking of people with chronic back/neck pain or pain in general who have been on the medication for years. Or persons who had injuries, and then recovered and stopped receiving medication. I KNOW two people who received prescriptions to oxycontin and as a result started using heroin when their prescriptions were stopped. One of whom is now dead.   Your article made me laugh to be honest. Posting a myth reality response that is used to reassure families. It even uses textbook references!"
Buffalo,317zgi,Komacho,-4,Fri Apr 3 01:23:56 2015 UTC,"Most non-hospice opiate prescriptions do not end in addiction. That is a fact. Hydrocodone/oxycodone is used every day following trauma, surgical procedures, etc. They are used for a short term to great effect, and they do not result in addiction. Take your moral panic elsewhere. Sorry, the fact that you know two heroin addicts doesn't tell us anything about the population of people who received narcotic prescriptions."

There is no regulation on illegally obtained substances, they might have no idea what they are getting. Or, it might be someone who is experimenting, or poorly advised. Abuse of opiate based substances is certainly a dangerous and legitimate epidemic, regardless of the benefits in the controlled medical setting.

I know there are a few around south florida, as well as in tampa, jax, etc. I'd start there as their regular bar most likely has pretty decent wings.

Buffalo,313ni3,lostwolf87,9,Wed Apr 1 19:50:36 2015 UTC,"Just a warning. Coming from new york unless you are from certain parts of the bronx our city including our downtown is going to look ghetto to you.  The cheerleaders wont get it but really our best neighborhoods have most in common with mediocre neighborhoods in the bronx than they do with trendy ones in brooklyn or manhattan.   That said I think this is a good thing. The bronx moves slower than the other richer boroughs so it still has that x-factor that new york city used to have. You've got the hole in the walls, the poverty, the ethnic neighborhoods that aren't overrun by hipsters. Even our hipster districts are overrun with actual hip individuals who are poor and not just trust fund babies.    Also I dunno if you've ever travelled to other cities but prepare to get your expectations of what a city is to be lowered. My first trip to chicago bummed me out. If you've never left ny I can't imagine what buffalo will look like to you. So keep in mind we have only about 200,000 people.  Our density is low. Our big trendy areas will make you scoff.  That said the cost of living is a delight. There are parks everywhere. We have walkable neighborhoods. There is plenty of nightlife. There are museums, pretty buildings, and etc.   Also normally I'd recommend renting(I pay 300 a month my nyer brother and I live in a nice big apartment), but since you are looking to buy I say buy soon. Buffalo is on the up and up. Expect change and expect things to improve.  I am really grateful to have found this fine city when I did because I can feel it in the air. It's not quite like NY in the 90s but it sort of is. The idea that things are going to grow and change. That the ghetto neighborhood will become a trendy yuppie enclave soon.   Get in here while the getting is good.  Also from an ecological perspective the wny region is a large provider of green energy(whether we use it or not I'm counting it we should!) and we also are a water rich area possibly one of the best water reservoirs in the world. Also winter kerfuffles aside we have the least natural disasters. So no big fires, no earthquakes, hurricanes, or sharknados.   All in all I've been rummed out so all I can say is welcome to buffalo. I hope to god you aren't a yuppie pioneer, and I know nothing about housing values."

Im hoping to land a house with 2 apts for around 150k tops. Being that the prices are a bit higher than I expected.   I wouldn't say Im a yuppie pioneer but I have some aspirations. First I want to settle down, then maybe open a business in the developing city.

My advice is to use the opportunity to go someplace that you might not go otherwise, maybe someplace a bit less casual.  I'd also opine that you're a bit better off going someplace where you can get a nice cocktail or a really good bottle of wine rather than just getting beer.    Pearl Street, Cole's, Steer, Acropolis, Lenox Grill, Hardware, Century Grill are all fine for what they are, I suppose.  But they're any day of the week type places.  Try something new.    Great suggestions from others:  Tappo, Oshun, Seabar, Black Rock Kitchen & Bar, Providence Social Club, Left Bank.    My additions:     Sato for sake and curry, ramen, or their pork belly.  (Josh Smith is the only certified sake sommelier to my knowledge in the region and will really help set you up.) Vino's on Elmwood for Italian and great wine. Oliver's.  It's actually price competitive with Left Bank, Providence Social, Buffalo Proper for non-steak entrees but with better wine and cocktails.   Lombardo's.  Boom.  Same deal as Oliver's.  Price competitive for non-steaks.  GREAT wine. Sumptuous food. Archer for exotic meats.  Good whiskey selection.  Limited but excellent wine selection.     But you're turning 21!!  Don't limit yourself to beer.  (I'm sure you'll drink more than enough with friends soon enough.)  And don't limit yourself to a place you could go any other night of the week.  Find something special and have fun!!  :)"

Buffalo,312jon,FTG716,6,Wed Apr 1 18:01:14 2015 UTC,"Aside the timing of the lights, my #1 gripe is the tendency for the city/towns to mount lights DIRECTLY ABOVE THE GODDAMN LINE ON WHICH YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO STOP.

Buffalo,30zbpw,joepunchface,1 point,Wed Apr 1 13:49:42 2015 UTC,"Stop by your (suburban, volunteer) fire station or check their website, honestly. If there's nobody there (they're not staffed 24 hours a day), keep watching for cars in the parking lot. Then just knock on the door. I could better direct you to which company if I knew where you live; you could pm me if you'd like.   The process is similar between companies: put in your application,  then it takes about 2-3 months for the bureaucracy to handle it. There may be a couple interviews in that period. Once they call you, you'll need a physical, and then you can start.   When you start, you'll have a year or two to complete the minimal schooling (generally NYS Firefighter 1 and NYS EMT-B). You'll also have to respond to calls and do weekly company training during that time, and maintain a minimum amount of calls and training every year.   It can be a lot of work, but if you're cut out for it, it's one of the most rewarding things you can do. You'll make amazing friends, you'll always have a worldwide support network, and there's a little bit of a retirement at the end."

I am a veteran so hearings stories and relating to the older ladies and gentleman is well worthit. Especially when you make their day better because you are there actually talking to them (Which I noticed a lot of medical personnel  there don't communicate with them very much. Granted the nurses and doctors and MA's are overworked so I can't blame them too much.) Or if you are interesting in working in some specific field ie OT, PT etc you can go directly to the director of that department and work directly for them.

Buffalo,30x47h,bundto,6,Tue Mar 31 15:33:15 2015 UTC,"The days of big concerts and ""superfests"" at The Ralph went away with the decline of supergroups like The Who, Pink Floyd, and The Rolling Stones.  The whole ""you probably haven't heard of them"" phenomenon didn't exist in the 1970s and 1980s.  Then, if a band was popular, people flocked to see them in concert.  Today, not so much.    Also, the rock and popular music scene is much more fragmented now than in the past.  Basically, more bands and genres, each splitting a larger fan base into smaller bits. Bands that are popular by today's standards don't have nearly the same huge young fan bases as popular groups of the past.  In the 1970s and early/mid 1980s, Buffalo was EXTREMELY blue collar, and hard and progressive rock had a HUGE local fan base.  Buffalo has five album rock stations, with playlists that had a lot of overlap.  Want to hear some Zeppelin, Kiss, Triumph, Rush, Yes, Boston, Supertramp, Fleetwood Mac, AC/DC, Aerosmith, Genesis, or whatever?  There's 97 Rock, WPHD, Rock 102, The Bear, and Wizard 98.  Today, it's just 97 Rock, and its playlist became frozen in amber around 1986.    Can you imagine the Ralph selling out for Modest Mouse or Death Cab for Cutie, even if they weren't seen as corporate sellouts?  Now, put yourself back in time to the Buffalo of 1982, when half of Buffalo's (white) teenagers and early-twentysomethings were heshers, hard rock is found at every other station on the FM band, everybody has a father or uncle with a job title like ""30 ton jack-and-grind smelter engineer"" or ""hot-drop slag forge gruntsman"", and Snorton' Norton just announced the lineup at this summer's Superfest at Rich Stadium - Foreigner, Loverboy, Ted Nugent, and Iron Maiden."

What I do recall was that his prices were in the lower half of the several estimates I got. Not the lowest, but I had significant suspicions about some of the lower estimates. I have a ranch style house with a walkable roof. They finished in one day.  Issues they encountered were; A couple small rotted boards in an area I knew to have had several leaks. They replaced them with spare lumber they had on hand at no cost to me.  He and I both thought I had 3 layers already on my roof. It turned out to be 5(don't ask) he warned me that his only concern was if all the tear-off material didn't fit in the dumpster he would have to charge me for a second Haul-away. It made sense to me as I know they pay for the disposal. But regardless, he had his crew jam it all in to make it fit and again there was no extra charge.  In the end I paid exactly what was estimated and after climbing on the roof to look at things myself I was VERY happy with their work and their cleanup afterwards. He struck me as an honest and no BS kind of guy. Highly recommended."

Buffalo,30yia2,natebenson,6,Tue Mar 31 19:04:24 2015 UTC,um... what do you want to know? can you walk on the tracks and follow them? yes. are you trying to get into homes from the tracks? that would not be wise.
Buffalo,30yia2,TOMALTACH,0,Tue Mar 31 19:53:39 2015 UTC,"No no, don't want to get into homes. Looking for active rail lines that carry various cargo, tankers, etc going through residential areas. There's a lot of lines that butt up to school property and a view from google maps shows a lot of lines are right up against residential property lines.   Just looking to get close to tracks for a news story, maybe talk to residents along active lines."
Buffalo,30yia2,TOMALTACH,8,Tue Mar 31 20:04:51 2015 UTC,The belt line that circles the city sees quite a bit of freight traffic.  Familiar with North buffalo? The line that passes Nichols school is very active. Broadway railyard along Broadway is extremely active as well & there are multiple yards along Broadway as well as residences across the street.
Buffalo,30yia2,Tralala01,2,Tue Mar 31 21:12:20 2015 UTC,Came here to say this. Very active through here.
Buffalo,30yia2,irons,3,Tue Mar 31 22:24:13 2015 UTC,Most of the active lines in Depew/Lancaster hit residential directly. The lines that run along Gould Ave in Depew are close to houses and are approachable from Firemans park.
Buffalo,30yia2,LibrarySquidLeland,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:11:14 2015 UTC,"The rail yard that splits Lackawanna in two is also quite active, and dozens of homes are immediately adjacent to it.  Walk down Center St and pick a sidestreet to the west; they all abut the tracks.  Same deal with Lehigh St on the other side of the bridge, although that community is a lot less apt to open doors to a stranger."

Buffalo,30u4sm,RVAGOD,3,Tue Mar 31 04:51:47 2015 UTC,"I share the concern about maintaining 100 taps,but if you frequently encounter poorly maintained draft lines I suggest going to better bars."

Guess that's another bar I am never going to visit.  *That being said, the menu does look pretty good and I am impressed by the beer selection (But who knows if they are going to go through enough that it is fresh). I am also always wary of an owner being described as a ""kid in a candy shop"" in regards to their product. It means the person might make choices based on preferences rather than business. Oh well, hopefully it works for them but yeah, definitely not trekking out to Clarence anytime soon to get busted for a DUI on the way back.  Long live blue monk, Colter Bay, and Coles!!"
Buffalo,30u4sm,Vocal_Minority,5,Mon Mar 30 20:53:50 2015 UTC,"As someone who lives out in Clarence, I am really excited to try this place! All of the good bars are a half hours drive for me and a new restaurant that's this close to me is great news.  Edit: however that specific location is known for high turnover of restaurants failing- pretty sure there's been 3 prior places in past 6 years alone so we'll see if this one can break the mold"
Buffalo,30u4sm,nursingstudent,4,Tue Mar 31 11:54:46 2015 UTC,"Well, my girlfriend doesn't drink much.  She could drive.  I might consider checking it out.  It's right near her parents' house."

Buffalo,30u4sm,Hanoiing,6,Mon Mar 30 23:02:30 2015 UTC,"I don't do my drinking in East Amherst/Clarence either, but you know it's possible to go out for quality food and drink without getting blasted, right?  My primary concern would be turning over 100 beers - either they're throwing out a lot of beer, or you're spinning the wheel of manky beer."
Buffalo,30u4sm,thegangler,-1,Tue Mar 31 00:28:44 2015 UTC,"You are implying I have an unhealthy attitude towards alcohol because I don't think it is safe to drive after drinking any amount of alcohol? Nice.   I would just prefer to not worry about a vehicle when I go out to have a few beers and watch a game or get a bite to eat and I wouldn't want to live anywhere that option isn't a reality.  There is also no way I am spending an hour (an HOUR) out of my day driving to drink the same beers I can find within walkable distance to my home where I don't have to risk anyone by driving.  But if you want to spend an hour doing that and put others and yourself at risk, help yourself. Just please calm down with the attitude of everyone who doesn't want to drive after drinking automatically has a drinking problem. You make yourself look like a hayseed."
Buffalo,30u4sm,Vocal_Minority,9,Tue Mar 31 00:41:17 2015 UTC,"No reason to resort to ad hominem arguments in attempt to take the moral high ground, chief. Heaven forbid you drive an hour (an HOUR) out of your way for a different experience.   Now that you've made your personal preference clear to everyone on the sub, you win the internet for the day. Myself? If I'm in the area, I may just stop in for a pint and pie. Thanks OP!"
Buffalo,30u4sm,thegangler,-5,Tue Mar 31 01:36:18 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, it's not really an ad hominem argument but that is beside the point.  You guys are really missing the boat on this. I think the food looks good and the beer selection is great. I personally am not driving out to Clarence for beer and food I could get in the city. Not worth the time, not worth the risk. I know a lot of you people are stuck out there though so I understand. You can only eat and drink so many times at Applebee's before you need to try something different."
Buffalo,30u4sm,Vocal_Minority,6,Tue Mar 31 02:29:44 2015 UTC,Ignorance is bliss.
Buffalo,30u4sm,Fgrira-Fpevoare,3,Tue Mar 31 02:58:39 2015 UTC,there are actually many places out in the suburbs that have a good beer selection
Buffalo,30u4sm,ShooterMcGavinn,4,Tue Mar 31 04:08:50 2015 UTC,"I'd even say there's more on just Transit than where this guy is at. Off the top of my head: Brennan's, Pizza Plant, Buffalo Brewpub, the new Tavern at Windsor Park, and now Griffon. Then you have Moor Pat on Main Street too."

Buffalo,30u4sm,Sayoshinn,0,Tue Mar 31 00:38:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I love the place for being chill but I think they are not utilizing their space with their current lay out. I never see anyone eating/sitting in the dining area and it is completely cut off from the bar area by that wall. They should put in a square/horseshoe bar in and open it up for better people watching."
Buffalo,30u4sm,Vocal_Minority,-1,Tue Mar 31 00:43:02 2015 UTC,I'm sure the Brinkworths are just on edge waiting for your consulting advice as what they've done there for decades hasn't been working.
Buffalo,30u4sm,corp_goth,-1,Tue Mar 31 00:52:39 2015 UTC,"Look, I like the bar and the atmosphere there. I just can't help noticing they are not utilizing their space efficiently. I really don't understand your attitude. I assume their goal is to make the most money possible. If that means changing something about their bar, then they should do it. Just because there is change doesn't mean the bar will lose its character. The old and new can be incorporated. Maybe someone should make them an offer for the bar and change things up. The location and building are great. I would make even more money if they slightly modernized."

I wasn't sure what to think of the Daily Public when it came out but between this article and the article calling out the Buffalo News bias it's really giving a voice to science-backed education. Calling out the hypocrisy of the likes of Paladino, Cuomo, and Wilmers on education is precisely what's going to save future generations of Western New Yorkers."
Buffalo,30pkxq,Cananopie,-7,Sun Mar 29 18:06:50 2015 UTC,That article last week was a joke. The professor's research was nonsense and the article was not subjective itself. A joke
Buffalo,30pkxq,ReverendBass,8,Mon Mar 30 02:17:18 2015 UTC,"I know you feel this way but you (and everyone else who had plenty of negatives to say about it) provide no evidence to back your claim. Professors are the people we rely on to conduct reliable research and this is exactly the sort of stuff missing from a majority of Buffalo News education pieces. The way that professor determined the bias was that ""Nikischer and her graduate assistant Vanessa Ludwig undertook the coding process separately in order to prevent bias contamination, finishing with a 99 percent inter-rater reliability—a measure which indicates the degree of agreement between independent coders."" And then those words were used to determine the bias of a piece.  You, on the other hand, are just sharing your opinion which seems to be backed by far less research."

Buffalo,30r2ya,Vhrix,2,Mon Mar 30 01:18:30 2015 UTC,"Downtown has options.    There are the places with private spaces you can reserve (Pearl Street, Sidelines, etc.).  There are cavernous restaurants with toooons of seating (i.e Century Grill, Pan-American in the Hotel Lafayette).  There are the lunch places that you can have reopen for your private event (Panaro's, DiTondo's).    Another thought is you might contact Hector over at Valle of Mexico.  He's accommodated large groups of 20+ before for (unofficial) Yelp game nights.    For some of these, the quality is dubious to begin with.  Beware.  For some of these, the quality might suffer significantly because of the mass of people.   I'm sure there are people with other better options.  Curley's isn't a bad one though."

Buffalo,30k7ky,evilguest,1 point,Sun Mar 29 07:17:57 2015 UTC,"Would you mind elaborating? I'm not really seeing ""competition"" in the sense that Allentown Pizza competed with Crust Pizza because their price ranges and offerings were different. But like Crust Pizza I see a lot of restaurants come and go, Lagniappes is another example that comes to my mind which didn't have any other Creole competition in Allentown, and I know there are many others that just show up for a while and fade away.   I suspect this has more to do with a high cost of rent that demands a certain amount of income from these places to stay afloat and many cannot reach this standard. I was wondering if anyone had more of an understanding on this end of things."
Buffalo,30k7ky,NewYorksNo1Italian,2,Sun Mar 29 17:31:07 2015 UTC,"In my estimation, at least for Crust, it was not staying open during peak business hours. If your business is in the Allentown area, and there are bars all up and down that street, and you close at 9pm on a Friday and Saturday, you're going to miss out on loads of business that could have kept you afloat. Advertising is also huge when it comes to getting people to pay attention and try out your business, and from what I could tell, they did little to no advertising, and relied heavily on foot-traffic, which again, might have worked out if they stayed open during the heaviest foot-trafficed times."

I think that is a contributor to the low profit margins, but I may be wrong.   As far as the ""bad help, lousy food, loan problems, disloyal clientele"" I'm wondering how much of an issue that really is. Personally I enjoyed the food of at least a few places that closed down and thought they brought something unique. Never had a problem with the help and other business owners in the area don't seem to have that problem. Loan problems and the loyalty of the clientele I can't really speak towards."

Always be aware of your surroundings, don't keep your head down keep it up so that potential people know you see them and you're smart enough to not be a target. Always lock your car doors, always lock your front door, if you live on ground floor don't leave unmonitored windows open, don't leave any valuables in plain view in car, and just use common sense.   Also you should live like this wherever you are even in amherst.  Fun fact black people aren't the enemy, it's usually shady looking young people.

Buffalo,30i9ql,Eudaimonics,2,Fri Mar 27 16:41:40 2015 UTC,Boo. Buffalo is in that nice sweet spot between gentrified and plenty decent. All these jobs are just going to bring in more middle class and rich people and cause property value and rent prices to go up. Then all those restaurants with pictures of buffalo everywhere on the walls are going to go tits up and in their place will be a star bucks and some trendy yuppie oxygen bar.

Buffalo,30i9ql,LonelyNixon,1 point,Sun Mar 29 07:17:16 2015 UTC,"At the same time, Buffalo has a ton of space and parts of the city are still bleeding population.  Even with modest growth (say 1000 net residents per year), we are talking decades before this truly becomes a problem citywide.  Now if Buffalo was growing at the rate Columbus is (~8000 per year) then I would agree that this is a serious problem.  I believe that Buffalo itself will be growing once again by the end of the decade. The rate of that growth will be determined on numerous factors and if this almost too perfect storm plays out or not."

Buffalo,30gn6b,Yellowed,3,Sat Mar 28 14:15:00 2015 UTC,"I just moved to Buffalo (close to Lancaster) into some apartments in from Rochester.  I don't know how experienced you are, your budget, or what you want in an apartment but there are a few general things I can say.  Pay attention to the shape of roofs and if you see any water damage in the apartments.  The weather causes leaky roofs in a lot of places.  If the apartment has a flat (or is less sloped) roof and is older you are probably going to have issues with leaks.  Several places I looked at had evidence of water damage to the ceiling.  Pay attention to the windows and how well the apartment is insulated.  In Rochester I had a poorly insulated apartment and was paying $150 a month in gas and electric.  Now I have better one and pay around $60.  Pretty big savings.   Look for newer apartments.  The old ones will be cheap and it will be tempting but I think you will save money in the long run with the electric and gas bills.  I don't know if this is common in NYC, but I found many of the cheaper apartments don't usually have their own washer and dryer.  This was a deal breaker for me and eliminated a lot of places.  Also pay attention to a/c.  Some older places don't have it or use window units.  I found its not standard especially if you are renting a house.  You might not need it a ton of the year but it is definitely nice for a month or two.  I don't know your salary but you can pretty easily find something pretty nice between $800 - 1100 a month depending on what you want and what you can afford."

Cheektowaga isn't the most desirable area, and I don't know much about Lancaster. Elmwood Village, Allentown, and North Buffalo are the most popular areas, and generally have a good mix of young people and families. The West Side of Buffalo (west of Richmond Avenue) is headed in that direction, as well.   If you're looking to buy or rent around Cheektowaga, I'd recommend Kaisertown, as it's fairly close, and also a really great, accessible neighborhood. Check out this article for more info.

Buffalo,30dtai,sobuffalo,7,Thu Mar 26 15:54:10 2015 UTC,"The 100-year-old Broadway Theatre stands as a grim reminder of its East Side neighborhood’s decline.  Plaster has worn off the brick walls of the former movie theater, and most of the remaining, musty seats are damaged beyond repair. The tarnished ceiling dome only hints at its former splendor.  Seven years ago, a group of African-Americans working in media bought the vacant theater at 512 Broadway, just east of Jefferson Avenue. They want to create a multimedia performance space and a place to teach media arts to youth.  They wrote letters to foundations, appealed to the mayor and contacted developers seeking support.  None stepped forward – until Carl Paladino answered their call.  At their first meeting three months ago, the developer offered to have Ellicott Development, his construction and management company, be the project manager to guide the building’s renovation from design through construction. His company’s involvement, he said, could also help attract donors.  “They’re really sincere, straight-up people,” Paladino said. “I have a lot of faith in them, and I’m trying to help by going somewhat public on it. By putting our credibility behind their project, I’m helping them to go out to the community to raise the necessary funds to do the renovation.  “We adopt projects once in awhile for good, earnest people,” Paladino said. “I think, whether it was my church or one of the schools we’ve helped, that we have helped put them on the right track to get the project done. I have a good crew of project managers and construction managers that will carefully watch over every aspect of the project, and make sure it’s done right.”  Paladino’s offer to help floored Michael Quinniey, a founding member of Western New York Minority Media Professionals. He had grown accustomed to having doors shut – if they had cracked opened at all – and found Paladino’s interest genuine.  “He liked that we had put in a lot of hard work, and we didn’t cry when things weren’t going our way. And he liked the project,” Quinniey said.  “We were very flattered to get Carl’s offer to be project manager, because quite frankly it was more than we dared hope for,” Quinniey said.  “We went to him asking him to be an advocate for the building, and he said, ‘I think I can make this work.’ It wasn’t about money for him,” Quinniey added.  Theater’s origins  The Beaux Arts-style theater opened in 1915 as the Sattler Theatre. It was commissioned by John G. Sattler, who also owned Sattler’s Department Store at 998 Broadway.  The 928-seat movie theater cost $35,000, according to theater historian Ranjit Sandhu. The architect was Henry Spann, who also designed the North Park Theatre on Hertel Avenue and the former Savoy Theatre on William Street.  The Sattler changed hands in 1920, and was rechristened the Broadway Theatre, and later, Basil’s Broadway.  It’s last phase, beginning in the mid-1960s, was as a house of worship. The theater became Muhammad’s Mosque 23 – boxing champ Muhammad Ali visited – before God’s Holy Temple took it over and then leased the building to Joy Temple Church until 1996. It has been unused since then.  The boarded-up white terra-cotta facade still retains decorative patterns, accented in blue, red, yellow and green. Inside, the magenta-painted box office entrance leads into the auditorium, where ornamental theater chair stands and plaster details offer a peek into grander times.  The media group wants to revitalize the space by removing the back wall to build a larger stage and add seating. The group will have to put in new seating, sound, lighting and HVAC system. It also wants to build an addition for bathrooms, a refreshment stand and a lounge.  The preliminary price tag is around $7 million.  Paladino said the theater’s problems were only “cosmetic” and not structural, despite its century-old age.  Minimal damage  The building needs a new roof – estimated to cost as much as $150,000. Asbestos cleanup could cost about $200,000.  Luckily, the concrete roof’s slight pitch and drainage system helped minimize water damage to the building.  The group has also received advice from Flynn Battaglia Architects, and Buffalo’s Young Preservationists helped clean the theater, remove graffiti, trim trees and paint, Quinniey said.  Reginald Wallace, the group’s theater director, said they’re dedicated to saving the community’s lost history while it’s still possible.  “We’re trying to restore our history and a sense of pride in our community by restoring one building and one block at a time.” he said.  The Broadway Theatre would join a select group of theaters, if it reopens.  Only 27 African-American theaters still operate as performance halls, according to filmmaker Wendy Hacker of Loose Threads Cinema, who researched historic black theaters for a film project.  They include the Howard Theatre in Washington, D.C., and the Booker T. Theater in Rocky Mount, N.C.  “Most of these theaters, with very few exceptions, were smaller affairs and not as splendid as the Broadway Sattler. That theater is such a grand old dame, and it will be magnificent when it’s done,” Hacker said.  Christina Lincoln, director of operations for Preservation Buffalo Niagara, said theaters have the potential to rejuvenate an area. She saw it happen in Cleveland with the revitalization of the Capitol Theater.  “Things do happen gradually, and it took many years for them to open the theater again and make a project like that feasible, but when that theater came back to life, a lot of life started to spring up around it,” Lincoln said.  “I think people are starting to recognize the assets that are on the East Side, and I’m hoping some of the downtown rejuvenation, and on the West Side, starts to spread to the East Side now.”  ‘Nothing but helpful’  Paladino’s support of black media workers may surprise some, given the racially tinged disputes he is embroiled in on the Buffalo School Board and his past controversies over emails.  Paladino scoffed at the notion anyone should see his involvement through a racial lens.  “By far, I’m the last person you can call a racist. That’s what people (say) when they have no other excuse for their behavior,” he said. “It’s just terrible the African-American leadership is so devoid of competence.”  The media group’s Dwayne Kelly, an African American, defended Paladino.  “I’m aware what has been said about Carl, and they don’t know the Carl I know,” Kelly said. “He has been nothing but sincere and nothing but helpful.  “If the guy was the bigot they say he was, he wouldn’t have given us the time of day,” Kelly said. “Instead, he gave us two hours, lunch and an offer to help.”  The group and Paladino see eye-to-eye on the project.  “The theater is going to provide opportunities for young people, black and white, as a center not only for entertainment but also media production,” said Kelly, whose father used to take him to the Broadway to see westerns as a child.  “We’re trying to build an entire new middle class in the black community that is not solely dependent on government and that knows how to reach into the private sector to move the community forward,” he said.  Reopening the theater, Paladino said, could spur investment on nearby property where Buffalo Forge Co. once stood.  “The building is in an area that isn’t so pretty,” Paladino said. “I think it will be a jewel that might be an inspiration to others to do other things around it.”****"

But I only gave him 7 bucks to drop me off in Allentown. He argued with me but I think he had no recourse because what he was trying to do was illegal.   If we have any lawyers here, I wonder if you could legally just jump out of cabs pulling this shady ""meter off"" bullshit and not pay them.

If the meter isn't on they didn't call the ride in to hq so nobody but you and the driver know the pickup and destination.  If they want to call the cops let em and explain the situation that the cabbie illegally drove you and tried to strong arm you into paying him an inflated rate.  Odds are you get out, they bitch, then you just keep walking away.  I don't recommend stiffing cabbies but if they are trying to fuck you, well fuck them as they have no legal way to make you pay."

Buffalo,30a1y5,MrF33,1 point,Thu Mar 26 12:56:17 2015 UTC,"From a driver, that depends on the situation.  I would always request the driver to turn on the meter.  But if it's a trip between two set rate zones, the driver isn't required to run the meter and you can be held liable for that fare.  Drivers are independent contractors which gives drivers the ability to grant a discount or offer a trip at a specific rate if that is agreed upon between the driver and the passenger.  If the driver doesn't run the meter and the cops are called, it's generally a ""his word against yours"" situation where the cop would decide what a fare rate would be.  But that is also dependent on the cop's perspective on the law.  Some cops might make you pay more and some might not make you pay at all."

Many of them were implemented between 1910-1970, so now we simply accept them as a society. But they are not acceptable, both morally and politically.

So you want to start a taxi company, in addition to the insurance costs mentioned, you're going to pay through the nose for the legal right to pick up passengers.  The system was built a long time ago to protect cab drivers and cab companies. Since the emergence of alternatives like Lyft, cab drivers have been increasingly relying on the system to prevent any changes and protect their asset (the medallion)."
Buffalo,30a1y5,flancresty,1 point,Thu Mar 26 12:53:49 2015 UTC,"They were made to ""protect"" them, and to regulate them. If you had unlimited licenses, the big companies would monopolize the trade. The limits actually help the smaller guy. Do you have any examples of someone trying and being denied?  The insurance would be cheaper if a few drivers banded together as I suggested. I don't understand why people wouldn't want to have appropriate insurance, even if not legally required. CYA.  Do you think they should lift the law so companies don't need commercial insurance? of course this goes for Liberty and the rest as well.  Do you think the license limit should be lifted? Liberty could have unlimited Cabs.  I really don't think things would work out to well if those things happened. Maybe I'm misunderstanding but what solution would you like to see?"

Given that there are only 300, you have to buy one from someone with a license, you can't just apply for one and get it. I assume all 300 have been claimed for some time, I could be wrong.  They should absolutely have commercial insurance, they are companies, and given the relatively high potential liability (say four passengers are killed by a negligent cab driver, that's a multi-million dollar lawsuit), personal insurance limits are nowhere close to the levels needed. Moreover, cabs drive 5x-10x the miles a ""normal"" driver does, and personal insurance rates are calculated based on ""normal"" driving amounts.  Yes, I do think the limit should be lifted. IMO there are two problems:  1.) Shitty service. Increasing the number of licenses could improve this by enabling new firms to enter the market. Or not, maybe Liberty would just buy them all. There are ways to induce new firms, like limiting the number of licenses a firm can have.  2.) Not enough vehicles. Here's where raising the limit really comes into play. With only 300 licenses, even if they are all operating 24/7, that's just not enough taxis, particularly during high-need times (weekend nights most notably)."

We don't have anything as full-featured and all-inclusive as you're saying, but we do send out a monthly email with a recipe and a few tidbits about what's new in the store, you can sign up for that here: http://niagaraproduce.com/get-fresh-club/   As for avocados, there is seasonality in some varieties but Hass (the ones everyone thinks of when they think 'avocado') are available year-round these days. I believe we had some Hall avocados in a few months ago, so we do get other varieties sometimes.   Thanks for the kind words. Happy to help!"

FYI every living thing dies, and if it doesn't happen in the animal's prime for food, it would most likely happen outside, and slowly from disease or starvation. So try to separate your emotional response to violence en masse, from special, loving violence. Taking a life is violent.

Buffalo,30a5ts,Brownie456,-1,Wed Mar 25 19:33:40 2015 UTC,"Sure thing, what I'm trying to drive home is that if you truly have a motivation like you describe, you should participate in butchering an animal. I'm from the area this store is in. I take issue with people who will say something like wanting to support ""more humane"" killing. Smaller farms, local farms, mega farms, they're all killing animals. Uncle Jed and Tom-Bob put a chain through Bessie's nose ring, and through a ring in the floor, pull her head down to the floor by it, and swing a sledge hammer down into her cranium. They they slit her throat and haul her up to the rafters by her hind legs and let her bleed out. Uncle Jed will take a bowl of the blood in and eat it like soup. I'm not embellishing here.   My issue is that you're still looking for rinsed cuts in a package from this store. You're still not making your peace with butchering. There's nothing more violent about it at a mega farm by machines, than down in Eden NY. I'm fine with this, death is a part of life and these animals are food. Don't delude yourself thinking you could be less impacted by the way they kill at small local farms, than the way they kill at factory farms.  If you'd rather an animal live outside and be free range before they're whacked for food, not because they may be healthier to eat but because that's somehow more humane, you're personifying non-sentient creatures."

Buffalo,30a5ts,TechnicallyMagic,2,Thu Mar 26 01:30:38 2015 UTC,"I'm a layman on the subject so anyone feel free to jump in and correct me but I've definitely read that how about cow lives impacts the quality of the meat. Especially diet and exercise/relaxation. Things like Kobe and Waygu are two well known examples.   But I've also watched a documentary years ago about Temple Grandin. She developed a more humane way to lead animals to slaughter that supposedly had a positive correlation to the quality of the end product. And I believe they also use that poker tool you see in No Country for Old Men rather than sledgehammers. Not sure what it's called.   Reading your story was tough, and I'm sure it's very true. Just hard to stomach, even as a self proclaimed 'meat-a-tarian'.   Perhaps I'm wrong, but from what little I know, I think OP is justified in asking her question."
Buffalo,30a5ts,algo_rhythm,1 point,Wed Mar 25 20:07:48 2015 UTC,"Oh of course OP is justified, I just wanted to relate the info. You're right I believe the stress on the animal can effect the meat, just like diet, etc. That's not an interest in being humane as much as quality of the product though."
Buffalo,30a5ts,LonelyNixon,1 point,Wed Mar 25 20:13:32 2015 UTC,"Its called a cattle (or captive) bolt gun. Renders the animal brain dead instantly. Very little stress or discomfort. Cattle still must be bled out, but after the captive bolt they don't feel a thing.   Pigs typically are stunned electrically because their skulls are not conducive to captive bolt method. Pig must also be bled out after being stunned. Done correctly, this method is pretty humane as the stunner basically makes the brain zonk out for a minute or so during which time the nervous system does not function very well. The stun isn't painless, but it is very quick and minimally traumatic to other systems. An experienced person should be able to bleed out the hog before it can recover from the stun.  A stressful death can cause release of cytokines and hormones into the animal's bloodstream which can lead to less tender and flavorful product."
Buffalo,30a5ts,TechnicallyMagic,2,Sun Mar 29 19:14:02 2015 UTC,"You realize morality on this subject isn't binary.  You can be ok with the fact that you kill an animal in order to feed on it's fleshy bits and insides while still also wanting the organism to at least have a more comfortable time on this planet.   Besides free ranged meat tastes better and is less likely to get you sick than a bunch of animals in ages just big enough to hold them and the pile of their own shit that they have to lay in.  The issue seems to be more one that you have with this and in order to come to terms with your killer instinct you just close your eyes and go ""its only meat. It's only an animal. It's like a living robot made of meat who's life matters less!"""
Buffalo,30a5ts,LonelyNixon,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:03:06 2015 UTC,"Morality isn't binary according to LonelyNixon, so I guess you've struck a balance between killing but I don't need to come to terms with my killer instinct by telling myself anything. Wanting an animal to have a more comfortable time on the planet is a subjective idea, what's comfortable for a cow? Cows are bred to stand in a stall, they prefer it. The barn down the street, when it caught on fire, they had to shoot the cows in their stalls, because they would not flee to safety. Safety was the barn, the barn was life, they had never been outside. THAT'S HOW THEY THINK. People want to see the cows in the field, grazing, up until they're herded to the slaughter. That's good for YOU, not for the cow. Personification is the root of all this, how would YOU feel if you had to stay in the same place, if you had to watch others be killed before it was time for you to be killed. We're sentient, it would be different for us. That's my problem, 100 years ago we didn't project our thought processes and feelings onto animals nearly as much. We've separated ourselves from killing to survive but kept the meat in our diets. So now you have generations of people who haven't seen killing to eat, meat comes from a store. That's why there's all this upheaval, all of a sudden people connected the meat with actual animals being killed. My attitude is a result of never losing that, raising rabbits to slaughter, watching the cow slaughtered at the neighbor's (my original story), etc. My attitude is practical and realist, I grew up butchering humanely kept animals, it's no big deal. I'm not to blame for the state of the food industry, I don't even eat that much red meat! It's your parents who wanted a mountain of choices in thick red steaks on the shelf for an incredibly reasonable prices that have driven the state of it. Now their kids are all crying foul at what it took to make that happen. Buy a calf and raise it, butcher it, and then tell me how often you need a steak."
Buffalo,30a5ts,TechnicallyMagic,1 point,Wed Mar 25 23:42:42 2015 UTC,"Ive seen animals that I go on to later eat be slaughtered. This is down in small farms in Puerto Rico so not the bolt to the head way either. The slicing of necks, and in the case of chickens they sort of crack em like a whip to break their necks. I eat meat quite a bit. It's not some magical thing that comes prewrapped in plastic in the grocery from me. I am very aware of how it used to be a living breathing thing. I've also gone to cock fights so I'm not exactly a bleeding heart here.  You seem to be under the impression that animals are incapable of experiencing suffering. Now this leads to the philosophical waxing of ""what is suffering anyway, man"" but without diving too far down that obnoxious rabbit hole the fact is that animals do exhibit traits that one could consider suffering. They are capable of experiencing, pain discomfort, and react in a manner that could be described as fearful.   Farms which are inhumane not only produce a lower quality of meat but they also do cause unneeded suffering to animals. You've got gestation cages for pigs(which are smarter than dogs), you have chickens which are factory farmed literally squeezed multiple chickens into tiny cages with no room to move around. The birds are literally shitting on each other. Then you have things like frois gas over in france.    It's not ""personification"" it's just common decency. There is a difference between killing something and then causing it suffering before killing it. Yeah there is more to the argument of eating meat than either be a vegan or give zero fucks about the animal. Even animals we kill deserve to live more comfortably.  Then there are the practical issues with such farming practices which yield and inferior product to free range animals that are better taken care of and inherently more delicious. You also have the issue with animals in such tight spaces being more prone to diseases due to the filthy conditions and for these diseases to more quickly spread."

Buffalo,306bqk,Stanczyki,1 point,Wed Mar 25 12:44:41 2015 UTC,"Well multiple people have proven your incorrect assertions wrong and you imply teachers do nothing to help their students, have you actually spoken with a teacher that works in BPS?

Buffalo,306bqk,PSkeptic,0,Wed Mar 25 14:10:50 2015 UTC,"Here we go again.  Actually I have worked with many products of the BPS, and their math and grammar skills are part of what makes the BTF opposition to change so offensive.  Now to say that one has to walk in a teacher's shoes to criticize is one of the red herrings that you teachers bring up constantly.  It is demonstrably false, we don't need to have served in the armed forces to decide whether we should go to war or not, we don't have to be doctors to accuse one of malpractice, etc. etc.  So there goes your assertion as false. As for multiple other people proving mine as false, your fellow teacher in another thread quoted a website that rated NYS as the second best state for education in 2010 or 2011, and that meant that there was no problem, that Cuomo was the problem.  That is ridiculous, look at graduation and literacy rates in Buffalo for decades, the decades that unions got what they wanted because it was ""for the kids"".  She quoted that rating like it was the temperature, objective, when it was nothing of the kind.  You can't argue so you obfuscate and complain endlessly, and the general public has had it."

You tried to say that there's no place in the world that doesn't get that, but I filled that ""hole"" with my current home. Now you're saying that you just wouldn't want to live in a place that doesn't rain between June and August or so, which is honestly irrelevant.

Buffalo,304uou,716in619,2,Tue Mar 24 21:57:27 2015 UTC,"The thing about museums is that even if they cover overlapping material, they're really never in competition, and have an interest in each other's success. It's known in the industry as conglopetition. Basically, a high quality museum culture is going to benefit all the museums, and they all have an interest in driving each other's attendance. Now, there are some points where they still compete, grants and major events being perhaps the two biggest examples. But, it takes more than one museum to drive people from outside the region to come to Buffalo for a weekend or day trip. It's tough to imagine someone from Rochester driving all the way just to see the AK, but perhaps a trip to see AK and BHM is doable, so both AK and BHM have an interest in the other doing well because it's very likely going to drive attendance to the other. Then locally, there's a huge interest in making WNYers value the areas cultural sites. Every museum in the city benefits from collectively joining in making the local population interested in coming to their establishments. Someone who goes to the science museum is very likely the same person that if advertised to would be interested in going to BHM. BHM and the science museum both have a big interest in pushing each other's product."

I was speaking more to /u/Eudaimonics's suggestion that the Science Museum, Explore and More, Pierce Arrow, and AK all merge to form one entity:  to me, it just seems to make more sense that museums of a similar type and mission -- like the Science Museum and Explore and More -- cooperate and/or merge than museums with far divergent collections and patrons . . . one would be hard-pressed to find fine art at the Pierce Arrow, or a hands-on science exhibit at the AK -- therefore, it may be a little unrealistic to expect those three museums to cooperate any closer (as in trading exhibits, etc.) than wishing each other well.   The thing about museums is that even if they cover overlapping material, they're really never in competition, and have an interest in each other's success. It's known in the industry as conglopetition. Basically, a high quality museum culture is going to benefit all the museums, and they all have an interest in driving each other's attendance.   True -- but, as long as two (or more) museums are in different buildings, they're like stores competing for business (the patrons.)  Take for example M&T bank:  they sponsor Free First Fridays at AK, and Free Second Fridays at BPAC, right across the street . . . that's a good way for both museums to keep out of each others' way, so to speak; they're not competing for the same product (the crowd that wants free admission.) Now, suppose M&T sponsored Free Friday admission for both museums on the same Friday; I daresay the competition and relationship between the two museums would be a bit more adversarial . . ."

I am 33 and have a good time finding ways to male the balls float in the air currents while the kids work on making the fastest car. The fourth floor is still space and that hasn't changed in years.

Buffalo,3057ot,Krunkyjunk,6,Tue Mar 24 16:10:13 2015 UTC,"Pegula + Jacobs = Primarily Privately Funded Stadium, so I'm not worried. The taxpayers can pay for some infrastructure improvements that will benefit everyone.  Pegula knows how to capitalize on stadiums. I feel he would keep a stadium busy for more than a few dozen times per year. Part of the problem with the Ralph is that Eire County doesn't have an events committee actively looking out to attract events."
Buffalo,3057ot,Eudaimonics,5,Tue Mar 24 17:03:45 2015 UTC,"Another problem is hosting events so far down south at Rich Stadium.  I'm not too far from that area, and I still don't want to be bothered to drive that way for anything."
Buffalo,3057ot,PSkeptic,2,Tue Mar 24 18:04:03 2015 UTC,"You say that, but Pegula got a lot of public financial assistance while constructing the Harbor Center. Close to like half the cost was covered by money he will be saving from the various tax deals he made. Further, this is the NFL, and it doesn't want any owners setting bad precedents for future stadium deals. If Pegula doesn't sufficiently seek out public financing, Goodell is not going to provide him financial assistance from the league coffers. The last thing the league wants is for LA to turn to the teams looking to relocate there and say that Pegula paid for his own stadium up in Buffalo and that they can all do the same in So-Cal."
Buffalo,3057ot,a_jackson_federalist,2,Wed Mar 25 14:48:04 2015 UTC,Tax breaks are not really the same thing though as an handout. Especially when the stadium would likely replace parking lots that are not currently generating much in the way of taxes anyways.
Buffalo,3057ot,Eudaimonics,0,Wed Mar 25 16:24:24 2015 UTC,"No, they're almost exactly the same, if not worse. Whether the city and county pass bonds in order to give Pegula a big check, or give him tax breaks, there is no difference. As long as the bond payments are the same as the amount of tax revenue they're negotiating away, the two are exactly the same, with the tax breaks being slightly worse in that once they expire, there's always the chance of the owner getting extensions. What the stadium is replacing makes absolutely no difference."
Buffalo,3057ot,a_jackson_federalist,1 point,Wed Mar 25 16:28:27 2015 UTC,"Its not worse when the land they build the stadium on is not generating revenue and it is unlikely that land will be developed anytime soon.  If you have not noticed, Buffalo has no shortage of open lots and dead spaces.   The city is not booming in population either, so even with the recent increase in demand, development only goes so fast. Most of which are targeting older discrepant buildings and not open lots."
Buffalo,3057ot,Eudaimonics,1 point,Wed Mar 25 16:34:55 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing that you aren't understanding. The municipalities could all pass bonds, and have to make payments on those bonds for years to come. That would decrease the net gain in tax revenue that the stadium would bring in. They could also make tax deals that cut out the middle man bankers, but still decrease the net gain in tax revenue that the stadium would bring. The means of coming to a deal with Pegula have the same affect, the concerning difference is that come the end of the tax deals, Pegula will definitely look for extensions. Hell, I'm sure that extensions to the tax deals he got on the HC, despite them having many years left, will be something that he pushes for in the negotiations for the new football stadium.  I'm not saying that it's definitely going to be bad deal for the city and county. But, I really want public oversight into the negotiations, which I feel there has not been enough of, and I want there to be a public vote on the matter. I don't want the massive stadium deal to be decided by politicians that are all in Pegula's pocket. You can look at Pegula's political donations. The man is a solid Republican, donating to many GOP federal level campaigns. Yet, he made donations to Brown's reelection campaign. It's not because he agrees with Brown's policies, hell, he probably really doesn't care how the actual city is managed, instead it's because he wants whoever the mayor is to just push the stadium deal through with as limited input from the public as possible, and Brown has an unbeatable Democratic political machine.  Also, let's be real here, a lot of the land in the first ward, where the stadium is likely going to be built, is being sat on in the hopes that the new stadium gets built there. Paladino owns a lot of that land, and he's going to use his influence on the BPS school board, which will have to approve of all property tax deals, to make sure that the new stadium, if built within the city, will be on or right next to land he owns.  I have little to no doubt that the stadium deal will reflect stereotypical corrupt Buffalo politics, even if Pegula attempts to avoid this, though I think his political contributions reflect that he knows he will have to play the game, and us tax payers and average citizens will be getting bent over. Hopefully he turns the Bills into a winning franchise, which I guess would be the equivalence of him reaching in front to give us hand jobs while we take it from behind."

One of the nice features of the streetscape at this pov is the ability to see downtown down the street from here. A garbage would block this view.

He's a reason Buffalo has stagnated, he owns a lot of staple buildings and either let them sit or put Parole offices/Meth clinics in neighborhoods he wants to fuck around with. he's a manipulative person and him having so much power kind of screws Buffalo."
Buffalo,3051ea,WorkAccount716,3,Tue Mar 24 15:59:31 2015 UTC,"He's a reason Buffalo has stagnated    Carl had the Breckenridge and Ogden Street toll barriers removed.  I remember that those tolls were a pain in the ass.  Not only did you have to pay but it also was a waste of time and caused traffic jams.  1 trip a day at $0.75 is $273.75 a year that Carl saved everyone.   http://www.buffalonews.com/niagara_thruway_users_cheer_as_tolls_go_by_the_wayside_______motorists_will_save_75_cents_each_trip.html   The toll removal effort gained unstoppable momentum when developer Carl P. Paladino, a fervent opponent of the tolls, hired attorney Michael B. Powers of Phillips Lytle.  Powers found a law that indicated the tolls should have been removed in 1996, and a lawsuit was filed in February. After a judge refused in August to dismiss the suit, Powers said he believed eliminating the tolls would be only a matter of time."

There's a reason why Paladino wanted to be on the school board, and it's not because he cares about education. Pegula is going to look for a property tax deal on the stadium. Let's the say he would have to pay $50 million in property taxes, part of the deal to get the stadium built is going to be having the actual amount that he pays lowered. Every municipal level of government that collects property taxes needs to agree to this deal, the BPS school board, assuming that the stadium is in the city proper, included. Paladino is going to use his influence on the matter to make sure that the stadium either gets built on his land, so he can really cash in, or at the very least adjacent so he can build a parking garage."

Just like how us horrible guys who avoid dating single parents are voluntarily limiting our own options. Yeah, I'm aware, and I would rather limit my options than waste my time dating people I already know I'm not going to want a relationship with.   I dated a Canadian once. It was a major hassle logistically. Even phone calls became more complicated, although there are so many ways to deal with that now.

Buffalo,2zxguf,poopiswhatsfordinner,9,Sun Mar 22 19:05:36 2015 UTC,Do Casa Di Pizza next I hear they have free Hepatitis
Buffalo,2zxguf,RVAGOD,3,Mon Mar 23 02:39:48 2015 UTC,"I did Casa a few weeks back. Thankfully, I decided to order hep-free. A wise decision in hindsight."
Buffalo,2zxguf,FancyAndImportantMan,6,Mon Mar 23 21:45:59 2015 UTC,"Will you be reviewing Mr. Pizza Elmwood anytime soon? I've had it plenty of times, I'm just curious what others feel about it, especially a professional such as yourself."
Buffalo,2zxguf,BZI,3,Sun Mar 22 19:11:28 2015 UTC,This would be my vote too. Sounds right up his alley.
Buffalo,2zxguf,ilovetofufu,2,Mon Mar 23 14:27:46 2015 UTC,"The original Mr Pizza Dough and Sauce recipe was made by my father actually :) . He helped my uncle open it wayyy back in the day when Mr P was like one of 5 pizzerias in Buffalo. The recipe has changed over the years,  but is still my go to place. (to be fair I don't pay either) My friends always ask me to get a pie from there when they come to hangout, they've become addicted. I always get one of the flavored crusts ( Honey Garlic etc.) My favorite Specialty pie is the Mr. Greek, no olives, garlic crust, double order of BBQ wings. ( I love how they do the BBQ properly and throw them on the pit for a bit get them nice and crispy). I also like how Fancy said MR P on elmwood. Big diff btw that and the one on the Boulevard."
Buffalo,2zxguf,ilovetofufu,4,Mon Mar 23 15:59:31 2015 UTC,"Abbott pizza is crap IMHO I'd actually say its one of the more disappointing pizzerias in the area.  My father and I like to try Pizza from everywhere, this place was not so hot."
Buffalo,2zxguf,Sonny_Zwack,3,Mon Mar 23 15:55:02 2015 UTC,That corner used to be a 7-11 back in the 90s. Don't know if it's the same building but it was campaign headquarters for Kearns or Kennedy or Higgins. The lot then became overflow for cars from the Jack Adkins Ford and now Basil Resale place across Abbott. Abbott moved there just a few years ago from their original place on Abbott at Densmore. (Streetview from 2007)
Buffalo,2zxguf,mbrancato157,3,Sun Mar 22 20:21:40 2015 UTC,I believe Abbott just recently changed owners as well if I'm not mistaken
Buffalo,2zxguf,nonethewiser,2,Mon Mar 23 09:59:30 2015 UTC,"...wow. You coud craft a wikipedia article on that corner. Thanks for the input, man!"
Buffalo,2zxguf,ConneryFTW,3,Mon Mar 23 21:51:38 2015 UTC,"Abbott is great pizza, too bad they closed their Kenmore location. Probably the best ""Buffalo"" style pizza I've had."
Buffalo,2zxguf,Denwha71,3,Mon Mar 23 14:44:55 2015 UTC,Thank you! These are awesome! Will you be reviewing Picasso's on Union anytime in the future?
Buffalo,2zxguf,TechnicallyMagic,2,Mon Mar 23 15:55:19 2015 UTC,I promise I'll hit it
Buffalo,2zxguf,BZI,2,Mon Mar 23 21:47:27 2015 UTC,"The Picasso's on Broadway was Amazing, they put ""fluff"" on their pizza and have the best crust."
Buffalo,2zxguf,Denwha71,2,Mon Mar 30 20:01:53 2015 UTC,"What if you don't live in the city, but feel that Bella and Ricotta's have some good 'za out in the OP and Hamburg area?"
Buffalo,2zxguf,Denwha71,2,Mon Mar 23 03:33:41 2015 UTC,Bella is my favorite pizza in WNY.
Buffalo,2zxguf,Denwha71,2,Mon Mar 23 14:28:25 2015 UTC,not bad but boring bland pizza
Buffalo,2zy8pn,castrating_zionist,3,Sun Mar 22 22:49:23 2015 UTC,"Like the person said in the other post, SEFCU is great, despite the lack of branches in the area. I have had an account there for almost 9 years, and they have done everything to be there for me."
Buffalo,2zy8pn,latenightwreck,1 point,Mon Mar 23 01:47:05 2015 UTC,"Seconded. They have a great Android app, online depositing, & friendly staff. The Amherst branch at UB knew me by name, and would just let me take out cash without even giving them my account number."
Buffalo,2zy8pn,MyDogShitsTigers,3,Mon Mar 23 14:14:19 2015 UTC,Sefcu & Morton lane are excellent
Buffalo,2zy8pn,TOMALTACH,2,Mon Mar 23 02:07:47 2015 UTC,Check to see if your place of employment has a relationship with one
Buffalo,2zy8pn,insertingUsername,1 point,Mon Mar 23 04:45:04 2015 UTC,My fiance uses Meridia and he seems to like them
Buffalo,2zy8pn,bencub91,1 point,Mon Mar 23 04:21:39 2015 UTC,I have had a Meridia account for 6 years. They are great.
