titlegore,3dwk6d,GnarlyBellyButton69,2,Mon Jul 20 11:09:38 2015 UTC,"That actually makes a lot of sense.  It's basically altruism. If you get another drink at the bar, you're cock blocking another person from getting another drink, which makes you the drunk one instead of them, wherein you can prevent someone else's drunk driving.  The problem is, you might drunk drive."
titlegore,3dwk6d,SparklingLimeade,2,Mon Jul 20 11:11:01 2015 UTC,"The thought is coherent and makes sense in that regard but as a course of action that one could consider actually attempting it makes no sense.  First it assumes that getting a drink now will cause the establishment to run out in the future. It is far more likely to merely increase the quantity of beverages ordered when the supply is next replenished. There are situations where it is expected that the drinking will continue till supplies are exhausted however so this is not a fatal flaw in the idea.  Second it assumes that denying the theoretical future drinker (TFD) a drink will result in a better outcome. What if our TFD say instead ""Oh, I haven't had that many and there's nothing left to drink so Ill go home now instead of chilling till I'm sober or making other plans because I'm clearly too wasted."" How can we know the impact of one drink? Why would anyone make decisions based on something so volatile?  Lastly it narcissistically assumes that the thinker is better able to drink this drink than the TFD. There are circumstances where this is clearly true (eg. deciding between having one drink or two) but if the thought is applied generally it's disgustingly egocentric to think that the TFD will hold their liquor more poorly.  A large number of extremely situational assumptions have to be made for the title thought to be applicable and in that limited set of circumstances there are other courses of action that are more effective, less roundabout, and generally better such as limiting the number of drinks available or curbing the drinking habits of problematic individuals directly."

titlegore,3dwk6d,bageltax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:48:42 2015 UTC,"I like the idea you have, but for it to be altruistic one must really hate the drink or possibly have a some sort of allergy to the drink. (Like for me, I hate the taste of lite beer and Jäger.) If you derive any pleasure from it, then it is not altruism.   I can see this scenario working at a house party or small social gathering where the alcohol is perceivably finite, but not in a setting where it is perceivably infinite, as the user above me suggests."

titlegore,3ddl4o,IpMedia,24,Wed Jul 15 14:56:24 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly it went a lot better than that;   ""BATTLE IN SICILY.  Now when Harald came to Sicily he plundered there also, and sat down with his army before a strong and populous castle.   He surrounded the castle; but the walls were so thick there was no possibility of breaking into it, and the people of the castle had enough of provisions, and all that was necessary for defence. Then Harald hit upon an expedient.   He made his bird-catchers catch the small birds which had their nests within the castle, but flew into the woods by day to get food for their young. He had small splinters of tarred wood bound upon the backs of the birds, smeared these over with wax and sulphur, and set fire to them.   As soon as the birds were let loose they all flew at once to the castle to their young, and to their nests, which they had under the house roofs that were covered with reeds or straw.   The fire from the birds seized upon the house roofs; and although each bird could only carry a small burden of fire, yet all at once there was a mighty flame, caused by so many birds carrying fire with them and spreading it widely among the house roofs.   Thus one house after the other was set on fire, until the castle itself was in flames. Then the people came out of the castle and begged for mercy; the same men who for many days had set at defiance the Greek army and its leader.   Harald granted life and safety to all who asked quarter, and made himself master of the place.""    I was unaware of the bird-catchers of the Viking armies, even me being Swedish.  Who knows, perhaps I've got bird catching genes. I have been able to catch flies with my hands."

The processor has 'shattered' Intel's tick-tock cycle - Every second processor they release uses smaller transistors, and every other processor is more efficient, but they've had to do two more efficient processors in a row. The reason they've had to do two 'tock' cycles in a row is they're struggling to make a processor at the next smalles size, i.e. Moore's law is faltering.

We could've had a collection of lessons from Jesus, some historical context that is related to what he talked about(Moses, the 10 commandments), and cut out the rest(most of it wasn't meant be literal anyway, and most of the laws given were from the leader of a specific group of people to those people, not from God to all of man).   the bible isn't divinely inspired, it's just a guide, but it could've done better even in that regard, considering how confusing it is."

titlegore,3c77iq,BIG_BANK_THEORY,20,Sun Jul 5 14:58:45 2015 UTC,This isn't title gore
titlegore,3c77iq,TommyLP,3,Sun Jul 5 18:36:30 2015 UTC,I concur
titlegore,3c77iq,Koneesha,2,Mon Jul 6 01:45:04 2015 UTC,"May I ask, why do you not think it is title gore?   I think its title gore, because the OP posted a garbled question which repeated itself twice."
titlegore,3c77iq,Zedyy,5,Sun Jul 5 21:17:19 2015 UTC,"No he didn't, he first asked why aren't you out or if you are out why are you on your phone."
titlegore,3c77iq,TommyLP,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:39:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah this. Title gore to me is quite hard to explain, but you know it when you see it. It's when a title make so little sense that it makes you think ""what the actual fuck"" and makes you laugh. Most of the posts I see are simple typos, badly worded titles or titles that are far too long. I wish I was a moderator so that I could remove them haha."
titlegore,3c77iq,Zedyy,3,Sun Jul 5 21:42:46 2015 UTC,"A nice rule of thumb is when I see it on the frontpage, I should be able to tell that its in titlegore. At first glance I just assumed it was the AskReddit thread."
titlegore,3c77iq,Magnyus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:03:12 2015 UTC,"The question is still very easy to understand. That alone makes it not titlegore in my opinion. If it were up to me I'd remove it, but I'll leave it up for now."

titlegore,3c77iq,master_of_deception,-23,Mon Jul 6 02:32:57 2015 UTC,Because Reddit is full of losers with no social life.  Better question: Why are you on Reddit instead of Facebook?   Because the have nothing to share with their friends.
titlegore,3c77iq,PointyOintment,6,Sun Jul 5 16:45:15 2015 UTC,Check the subreddit
titlegore,3c77iq,master_of_deception,7,Sun Jul 5 21:10:43 2015 UTC,Oh
titlegore,3c77iq,NormThaPenguine,2,Sun Jul 5 22:01:33 2015 UTC,Would've gotten a similar response on the ar sub too
titlegore,3c6kp8,porpoiseoflife,2,Sun Jul 5 09:03:23 2015 UTC,everyone in the linked thread seems to understand it… O_o
titlegore,3c6kp8,PointyOintment,2,Sun Jul 5 11:46:53 2015 UTC,"Well, that's mostly because we're all anime nerds.  A) It's in reference to a fairly well-anticipated title commonly translated as GATE: The JSDF Fought There that started airing over the weekend. So the general idea is pretty much understandable once you have a reference for it.  B) We're used to seeing the English language being butchered by awful translations like this. It's not always this eye-twitch inducing, mind you. But any long-term anime fan has seen something just as bad. So we can generally catch the trend before wondering exactly what translator was used to produce a word-jumble like this.  But for normals, I'm sure that the reaction should be somewhere around this..."
titlegore,3c6kp8,Cley_Faye,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:00:56 2015 UTC,"You're probably right. As sad as it is, I had to read that title multiple time to see that it was wrong."

titlegore,3c7a6w,readytoascend,0,Sun Jul 5 15:26:55 2015 UTC,Um... what's so terrible about this post? Grammar? Check. Spelling? Check. No run on sentences.   Is it because the title is long? Is that all it takes for titlegore these days? Really?
titlegore,3c7a6w,breovus,2,Mon Jul 6 00:07:41 2015 UTC,"I agree, I'll remove it."
titlegore,3c7a6w,Magnyus,0,Mon Jul 6 00:36:07 2015 UTC,You've removed a post that was on +20 with 92% upvoted after just a few hours. At that kind of trajectory it would have been one of the top posts of the week. I can't believe you removed something just because you and /u/breovus didn't bother reading the title. I think this is very poor.
titlegore,3c7a6w,breovus,0,Mon Jul 6 16:14:23 2015 UTC,"One of the top posts of the week based on all of 20 upvotes? You think awfully high of yourself.   Also, it was clear by the context of the post that OP was referring to the START of the launch of the last shuttle mission.   Also thanks for those kind PMs harassing me because I commented negatively on your post. I can tell it was really going to be something big that I ruined. You know... since only I and a mod commented on it.... and it remained an active post for hours. Yep. That mod must have deleted everyone's comments or something too right? Just more proof of reddit sucking right? Ruining all those top posts by high quality contributors and everything...   Grow up. It was a dumb post to begin with and you're taking this far too seriously if you're really so butthurt you have to whine this much about it."
titlegore,3c7a6w,breovus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:11:22 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about? ""Found this beautiful image from the start of the Space shuttle Atlantis. Actually it is from the 135th and final mission"" makes it seem as though OP has included a plot twist in the title. The top comment in that post by a huge margin is someone else saying /r/titlegore."

titlegore,3b1xh1,Tim_Crook,3,Thu Jun 25 16:10:22 2015 UTC,"Humans and Dinosaurs were not even close to living together. The genus Dinosauria was wiped out in the  Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 million years ago. The earliest precursors to Hominids (the Genus we are categorized in) came about approximately 22 million years ago and Homo Sapiens came about a mere 200,000 years ago. In effect, there was basically 66 million years of separation.  Its related to atheism because of the Creationist belief that the world is only 6,000 years old. If the world is younger than the supposed extinction of the Dinosaurs and Adam and Eve have been on Earth since day six, then Humans and Dinosaurs had to have coexisted in the beginning. I believe the people who run the Creationist Museum claim that Noah's flood was what killed off the Dinosaurs. Because of this, the belief that Human's and Dinosaurs coexisted is often associated with Creationism."

Seems like a strange fragment. Anymore isn't usually used to express the current state of things. Am I wrong??

titlegore,36k9q7,FallenXxRaven,4,Wed May 20 12:09:00 2015 UTC,To me it implies that Guy Fawkes didn't exist before 1605.
titlegore,36k9q7,Larsen1337,-1,Wed May 20 14:38:43 2015 UTC,"First off: I am NOT TRYING TO BE A DICK, IM ACTUALLY CURIOUS  How does the title imply that to you? Heres how I see the sentence.   ""TIL the word Guy comes from Guy Fawkes"" Okay so we get the term guy because that was his first name, and through various social bullshits it became a term, like every other word  ""the guy who tried to blow up the British Parliament  in 1605"" I didnt do any fact checking, I never do. I just read the ELI5 title and say ""Oh cool"" and take it with a grain of salt.  and didn't exist before that  I think this is what threw you off. Here he means ""The term ""guy"" [Would you take a look at this guy? The hell is he doing?] didn't exist before Guy Fawkes became so famous for trying to blow up friggin parliament.   Its no different than those few words we have in English based off the person who first did that thing. I can't think of any examples and I know there and plenty and its pissing me off, so PLEASE fill in that blank haha.  E: Various formatting, that was a fair amount for not checking in between haha. I think I made it clear.   ""Why didnt you just use > to quote instead of bolding it?"" Because I just now thought of that and I dont feel like changing everything. > woulda been much easier."
titlegore,36k9q7,FallenXxRaven,3,Wed May 20 15:04:02 2015 UTC,"The fact that there's no comma between 'trued to blow up the British Parliament in 1605' and 'and didn't exist before that' causes it to read as 'he tried to blow up Parliament and didn't exist before that', rather than 'the word didn't exist before he tried to blow up Parliament'."
titlegore,36k9q7,OmegaX123,0,Wed May 20 15:10:41 2015 UTC,"Well youre not wrong, but I think its kinda silly to let that get in the way. This is where context clues come into play.   I mean just think of hanging out with your friends, someone has more than likely said ""Yeah well fuck you"" only to have everyone laugh because of the context.   Language is full of things like that, and to not take a second to think about what you read, and to be a dick about it because someone missed a keystroke is, as I said, silly.  EDIT: In the context of this post, it should be obvious he didn't just spawn and start throwing torches at parliament. The only thing here that couldn't have existed before 1605 is the term 'guy'."

titlegore,35r3sr,blndcavefsh,1 point,Wed May 13 09:22:16 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't it change the average penis size?
titlegore,35r3sr,MundaneInternetGuy,8,Wed May 13 09:40:50 2015 UTC,"it might, but there's just as much chance that it would make the average penis size larger as there is it would make the average penis size smaller. The guy above was assuming it would make it bigger. Say you have an average penis size of 6 inches with 5 penises recorded, 3 more penis sizes are added with sizes of 7, 8 and 8 inches. This makes the average penis size 6.625, in this situation the average penis size is bigger. However let's say the new penis sizes are 3, 4 and 5 inches. This makes the average penis size 5.25 making the average penis size smaller. Because the size of the new penises is completely random (because we have no idea how big the trans people's penises will be) we can't assume that OP was right about the size of women's penises increasing, because they have just as much of a chance of decreasing."
titlegore,35r3sr,save_the_pigs,4,Wed May 13 09:56:30 2015 UTC,But it's women's average penis size. Adding a penis of 1 inch is going to increase the average.
titlegore,35r3sr,blndcavefsh,1 point,Wed May 13 10:05:41 2015 UTC,That's working under the assumption that a vagina counts as a 0 inch penis.
titlegore,35r3sr,save_the_pigs,-6,Wed May 13 19:12:12 2015 UTC,"actually that's why I originally said that it wouldn't change at all, all of the women are going to have the same size penis, because they all are being added on through surgical procedures. However on the slight chance that they are different my previous comment explains how we don't know that they're going to be bigger."
titlegore,35r3sr,TurnbullFL,10,Wed May 13 10:10:49 2015 UTC,"Penises added on? What are you talking about?  If someone gets a penis added on to their body they probably aren't identifying as a woman  We're talking about physically male people identifying as women, thus increasing the average penis size of those identifying as women"
titlegore,35r3sr,AaronGoodsBrain,-5,Wed May 13 10:17:43 2015 UTC,"what I'm saying is that they are modified, and the fact that many of them existed before this statistic shows that the penises could either be bigger or smaller after the new ones are accounted for."
titlegore,35r3sr,AaronGoodsBrain,-1,Wed May 13 10:24:46 2015 UTC,"Going from zero to anything, however small, is a large increase."

titlegore,35r3sr,AaronGoodsBrain,2,Wed May 13 12:50:19 2015 UTC,I don't know much about Italy but I'm pretty sure social acceptance of trans people is increasing in most democratic nations. So more people would feel comfortable identifying as trans.

titlegore,34dyqy,savesthedaystakn,65,Thu Apr 30 16:14:09 2015 UTC,I feel like it does when the 'minor typo' completely changes the meaning of the title.

titlegore,34dyqy,doomsday1216,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:19:08 2015 UTC,Top post of all time is a minor typo
titlegore,34dyqy,The_Vizier,1 point,Fri May 1 12:35:25 2015 UTC,So a shitty post rising high means it's OK for more to do so?

titlegore,34dyqy,doomsday1216,1 point,Fri May 1 16:07:37 2015 UTC,Then why did you reply to me if you're aware your argument is invalid?
titlegore,34dyqy,The_Vizier,1 point,Fri May 1 16:31:11 2015 UTC,"So in your mind, the fact that ""shitty"" is subjective means that my argument that this is shitty is invalid? That doesn't really follow logically."
titlegore,34dyqy,doomsday1216,1 point,Fri May 1 16:41:08 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying is that if it's the top post it was good enough to get there, and it's totally OK that this one gets upvoted too despite what you think."
titlegore,34dyqy,jhuynh405,1 point,Fri May 1 16:48:09 2015 UTC,"Well, that's your opinion, and I have mine, and they differ. I don't think just because a shitpost made it to the top however long ago justifies another shitty post getting up votes. You don't have to agree with this, and I don't understand how you think it's ""invalid"" to have an opinion that differs from yours. This must be how other people see all redditors. Convinced their opinions are fact, and terrible at discussing or arguing them in any coherent fashion (ie, ""your argument is invalid."" sure it is, sweetheart, sure it is)"
