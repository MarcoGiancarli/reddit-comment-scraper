postmetal,3e25pk,ark3,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:32:29 2015 UTC,Yeah I love the song. Love the artwork too. I'll find out if they have any t-shirts to sell :)
postmetal,3e25pk,RadiologisttPepper,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:04:24 2015 UTC,No links to merch on the site that I could find. CD is available on their bandcamp.
postmetal,3e25pk,mynameisjonjo,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:10:54 2015 UTC,Cool thanks for that buddy :) Might end up getting the album
postmetal,3dzr2b,Caznik,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:11:42 2015 UTC,"Fun track that's a little different from the sludge/doom/black metal offshoots that seem to have dominated this sub for the past few weeks.  Full album: http://juggernautrome.bandcamp.com/  Pretty unique for the first 5 tracks, last 2 I found to be kind of generic to be honest."
postmetal,3dcubr,AusMetal,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:16:54 2015 UTC,"I've only been on it for a couple of days, but this is quickly becoming one of my favorites of the year. Fantastic album."
postmetal,3dcubr,Ignimbrite,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:58:52 2015 UTC,Likewise. Two weeks until their album launch show ... Pretty stoked.
postmetal,3cjx8h,ChiSoxBoy,5,Wed Jul 8 14:19:21 2015 UTC,"Great music!!! Congrats, great songwriting, I think you can level the whole production up, but my god, the songs are really good.  Thnx for sharing!"
postmetal,3cjx8h,TheOzZzO,3,Wed Jul 8 19:48:50 2015 UTC,Thank you for checking it out! I've never produced anything on my own before so this whole album was a learning process. Future releases will only get better!
postmetal,3cjx8h,robotgraves,3,Wed Jul 8 19:52:20 2015 UTC,"it's really good.  Watch that bass level, it's present, but the way it compressed (not file type, but actual music compression) crushed everything else under it, especially the first song.    Also I listened like 5 times to the whole thing cause its good"
postmetal,3cjx8h,ChristinCaspari,3,Thu Jul 9 11:30:51 2015 UTC,"I had a tough time taming the bass. It's difficult, or at least it was for me, getting it to sit well in the mix without drowning out the rest of the low-end or making it sound flubby. It's certainly an aspect of mixing that I will be studying up on for my next releases. Thank you for offering constructive criticism, but most of all thank you for listening (five times! haha)"
postmetal,3cjx8h,7ape,3,Thu Jul 9 13:32:37 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for sharing ! x3
postmetal,3ceqpk,anteloop,2,Tue Jul 7 09:52:58 2015 UTC,"This is good album, but it's by-the-numbers post-rock, not metal."
postmetal,3ceqpk,Phoenixed,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:41:19 2015 UTC,"That explains why searching brought nothing up. Oh well, probably already been posted on the post rock sub."
postmetal,3c299f,tokartron,2,Sat Jul 4 02:20:06 2015 UTC,"This was certainly the high point of my week.  I hadn't been expecting to hear or see any material from your new album any time soon, much less a full track.  I'm excited to hear heavier material again, and I think releasing more atmospheric tracks in between albums allows for tracks like this one to have a larger impact when they're released.  I can't wait to hear the other (nine?) tracks on the album.  Am I right in thinking that the word 'film' implies that every track is going to be accompanied by video, or will it only be certain ones?"
postmetal,3c299f,Jehusephat,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:02:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks Jehusephat for the kind words, glad we made your week :)  The album does return to our darker, heavier sounds in a lot of places, but we've not departed from the atmospheric segues either. We're hoping to give a more cohesive listening experience this time around. That's mirrored in the film realm as well - yes there will be a film for each track, all summing up to be one feature length film, parcelled up in episodes that all take place within the same universe.  If you haven't already found your way there, you can check out the album pre-order page: http://dumbsaint.bandcamp.com . August 7 can't come soon enough ;)"
