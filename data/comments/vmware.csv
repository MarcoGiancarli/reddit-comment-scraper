When my team is looking to hire, we go through a pretty intensive review process, where experience matters more than certifications.  Just having a cert doesn't mean much if you have no experience.  You said you have ten years of experience as a sys admin.  Doing what?  If you have been nothing but an OS admin for ten years and are looking for a senior position in a VMware team, I wouldn't get your hopes up.  As I said before, in my short answer: it depends.  By that I mean if you can negotiate as that being a factor in your salary.  In my experience, however, experience and knowing the little details trump certifications.  Screw it, I should just change my short answer to: None.  Do not expect anything just from a VCP."

At least that is what the first support person for VSPP told me - I wasn't happy about it, and persisted that they should be able to flag the company without moving my cert off my personal account, as the cert follows me and shouldn't be tied to my employer.

Feature list of VSS and DVS  I'm going to assume that you fit into the 3 hosts with up to 2 physical processors each limitation of the licence.  Essentials isn't feature capable, all it allows you to do is have vcentre, the core features are not available. If you're going to be using more then one host then you would want to look at Essentials Plus as a minimum.

So there's nothing in between the $600 price tag and $5k for setting up what I need? I need the capability to have a virtual serial port ssh'd or telnet capable and a vswitch for the most part. The productivity portion isn't required until roughly Q4 in earnest so trying to justify that large of a price for our meager operation just does not feel appropriate use of resources."
vmware,3e2nbh,hphn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:43:24 2015 UTC,"It's a little unclear what you currently have and want to accomplish (at least for me).  How many physical servers are going to be at each site?  Do you have a firewall or router already in place to do the VPN tunnel between sites?  Do you already have a layer 3 capable device to setup vlan interfaces?  The free version of ESXi will let you run VMs and has a vswitch so you can setup portgroups for vlan tagging. It lacks any of the advanced features like vMotion, High Availability, etc and it doesn't include vCenter. A lot of the APIs are locked out in this version, so some backup software, such as Veeam, cannot be used because they need to tie into the APIs to take snapshots, etc.  As OversizedSpoon stated, Essentials will give you a license for 3 hosts and 2 physical processors each. Again, this doesn't have the advanced features listed above, but it does include vCenter. Btw, vCenter is a single server/appliance that allows you to manage multiple ESXi hosts in one client. Without it, you would need to manage each host individually.   Essentials plus will give you the same as Essentials, plus these features: vMotion, High Availability, Data Protection, vShield Endpoint, vSphere Replication.  You can compare versions here.  Again, as OversizedSpoon stated, it's best to have multiple physical hosts in each site for HA in a production network. Essentials Plus at least gives you a little room for growth and some advanced features like HA.  The vswitch itself does not act like a Cisco switch. It's pretty dumb, overall. You'll probably want to configure the ports on the physical switch the ESXi host (physical server) is plugged into as trunk ports, then in the vswitch you'll create portgroups with the VLAN ID you want to tag with. From there, you assign any VMs you create to that particular portgroup so the traffic is tagged with that VLAN.  As for the VPN tunnel, the vswitch will not do this either. You'll either need some physical hardware to accomplish this, or you could use something like pfSense, which is free and virtualized, at each site as your firewall and configure the tunnel there.  If you have any questions, just message me and I'll be glad to help if I can."

There's more I'm needing I'm sure but for now that's what I know I need to set up.  As I am thinking I'd like to set up a small user profile capable of using an in-house created app for inventory and QA that's not very demanding at all, yet at any given time I'd think we'd have a total of 160+ users and devices on the networks total at any given time (60-70 per site respectively and 20 network devices or so).

Performance was great and zeroissues with stability. If we wound need just one deployment that would mean +1 happy customer. But we're MSP doing bank branches project so we've checked how well Atlantis can scale and it's where we've hit a road block. #2 setup did not deliver expected performance and it was #1 twin in terms of everything! #3 provided decent IOPS being still lower compared to #1 but who cares! Except we had PSOD at least once a day with #3 :( Atlantis support was clueless and we stopped talking to them after their proposal to ""swap SuperMicro for something usable"". We devastated all three setups, re-built them into two pairs, added some flash, installed VMware Virtual SAN and... all issues are gone!

Another option would be to use the MOB or either pyvmomi (python) or rbvmomi (ruby) (or, possibly, powershell or govmomi, whatever is out there) to look at a VM's summary and config info.  You'll have to do the following navigaition: https://vcenter/mob  (from memory): ?serviceInstance?, content, rootFolder, datacenter, childEntities, VM, summary, config  EDIT: MOB per vm: https://<vcenter>/mob/?moid=<vm-moid>&doPath=config.files List VMs on a datastore: https://<vcenter>/mob/?moid=<datastore-moid>  EDIT2: Best I can do with RbVmomi. The following will output all the vmdk files that are currently configured to every VM. With a little more work it can test the expected filename 'puts ""..."" if vdisk.backing.filename =~ /filename.vmdk/. If you're more familiar with powershell or pyvmomi it can easily be adapted.  vim = RbVmomi.connect host: <hostname/ip>, user: <username>, password: <password>, insecure: true content = vim.serviceInstance.content ds_view = content.viewManager.CreateContainerView(container: dc._ref, type: ['Datastore'], recursive:true) ds_view.view.each do |ds|     vms = ds.vm     vms.each do |vm|        vm.config.hardware.device.grep(RbVmomi::VIM::VirtualDisk).each do |vdisk|          puts ""#{vm.name}: #{vdisk.backing.fileName}""       end     end end"

What is your dad going to be using SQL for that he needs it hosted here and 2TBs worth of space for SQL DBs?  Your only way to achieve this would be use Workstation as ESXi is not designed for the use case you want (Run a server and use it locally for a guest OS).  Why not use Hyper-V? It is free, comes with Windows and you could host a Server 2K8 R2 box on it to host SQL."

VMware will allow you to run multiple OS's simultaneously, but not interactively on computer itself (unless you use VMware workstation, see point 2 below). Generally gaming needs direct access to hardware and can't be done through virtualization.  Your better options are:   You can always just install SQL Server or SQL Express directly on Windows itself and skip virtualization. If you still want to virtualize and have his SQL stuff on its own sandboxed machine, you can use VMware workstation (which costs money), or some free alternatives like VirtualBox. Use Windows Server w/ HyperV, which allows you to virtualize but still gives you an interactive windows desktop on the machine itself."

vmware,3dxny6,Blog_Pope,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:07:02 2015 UTC,That would depend on the speed of the links. Typically you would have your different traffic types separated.
vmware,3dxny6,Juandrt58,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:14:20 2015 UTC,"It's good to keep management separate, but its better to keep iSCSI separate.  iSCSI should be a dedicated nic with Jumbo Frames enabled and it should be bound to the software iSCSI adapter (if you're using it).   That being said, with only 2 nics I would probably vSwitch them together for redundancy (on separate switches)  My advice to you would be to buy new NICs. They're not that expensive and they give you a lot more flexability.  Edit: For reference, here's what ours looks like: http://i.imgur.com/z0kU9M7.png These are all UCS virtual interfaces, so it looks like we have no redundancy for the management but we do as its done in the back end. Everything except the management is dedicated to a specific side of the fabric to control traffic flow, and all specific data types are segregated. That bottom vSwitch is a massive trunk port with about 30 VM-Networks on it. The dual iSCSI interfaces are for ONLY iSCSI and they're on separate vSwitches so that I can dedicated the full bandwidth of the port to them."

I wouldn't bother with dedicated vSwitches, just create one and manage your traffic using port groups, for example on for management traffic, one for vMotion, one of iSCSI and the rest VLAN based for production. If you are worried about the vMotion or production traffic using too much bandwidth, you can always you traffic shaping policies to limit the bandwidth and do load balancing on the ports using a LB policy like ""route based on physical NIC load""."
vmware,3dxny6,scottyyyc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:18:04 2015 UTC,"Best practice is to segregate services on different NICs - Management, vMotion, iSCSI, and VM Traffic (though many will mix management and VM traffic together, since it's often on the same network). Ideally, you have redundant NICs feeding separate switches for each service, so 4x2=8 NICs (ideally) per server (minimum). 2 NICs obviously won't let you do that. I have 12 NICs on each of my servers (4 for iSCSI, 4 for vMotion, 4 for VM and Management Traffic). I use all colour coded and labelled cables, so it's very easy to see what's what in my racks. Obviously 10Gbe with things like DCB can make this a bit easier.  If I HAD to use 2 NICs, I would segregate iSCSI on its own NIC, and leave VM traffic on another NIC. For what it's worth, a good enterprise quad-port NIC isn't terribly expensive (around $300 last I checked), so first thing I would do is buy more NICs so you can set it up properly with proper redundancy."

vmware,3dyswc,systadmni,4,Mon Jul 20 17:11:53 2015 UTC,"Your thought process is going the right way.  Do you have any applications outside and inside vSphere that connect to that vCenter? Examples include vSphere Data Protection, Veeam, vCenter Operations, vSphere Replication, XYZ Server Monitoring, Vsphere Update Manager, etc. Keep in mind that these will all need to be reconfigured with the new vCenter server. If you do have anything that ties into it then I would look at the documentation about moving to a new vCenter for that product.  Do you have any vSphere Distributed switches or are the all vSphere Standard Switches? If they are standard then you dont need to worry about the networking on the hosts and you should be able to move them over to the new vCenter without issues. If you have Distributed Switches then you will need to migrate all networking off of the Distributed Switches back to the Standard switches before migrating. Keep in mind that if you have an advanced networking implementation such as NSX, which you probably don't, that relies on distributed switches and this will all have to be unconfigured.  Do you know of any authentication config, custom alarms, resource pools, affinity/anti-affinity rules, certificates, server advanced config changes, cluster HA and DRS per-vm changes, etc. These will all have to be set up again. Some of these things can be exported and some cannot. If you have any of this be sure to document it. I wish VMware would create a vCenter config export which would make this so much easier...sigh.  After reviewing all of this, even if you have very little actually configured against your vCenter server, I highly recommend configuring everything you can on your new vCenter server before migrating any hosts over.  Finally, move one hosts over at a time but be sure not to leave only one host in a cluster for too long, keeping in mind that if you have a failure of that host its downtime.  If done correctly, this process should be able to be completed with no downtime but I would still recommend doing it after-hours.  It might also be worth looking into what version of vCenter 5.1 hosts are compatible with (maybe even vcenter 6.0?). In that case you could even create your new vCenter on a newer version and get that taken care of at the same time.  Once everything is moved over power down the old vCenter and keep it for at least a week in case you missed anything you needed from it."

In fact, if you're willing to dedicate hardware to the firewall/router, maybe you should actually just install it on bare metal. Once you use passthrough, that VM isn't going to any other host anytime soon, but using normal virtual NIC's you can just move it around as much as you like, and add more NIC's to it via VLAN's if you want to route more networks through the firewall.  I suppose if you must squeeze the absolute maximum performance through... but having a firewall process gigabit speed data constantly is not that usual in any normal setting.  Personally I still prefer to run firewalls on real hardware, as I like separating them from the rest of the infrastructure in case of faults, and pfSense especially since it's a doddle to set up in an active/passive cluster out of the box. But then I suppose I'm a little old-fashioned."
vmware,3duwsk,cr0ft,2,Sun Jul 19 18:53:14 2015 UTC,"We did a lot of testing of this at my old job, just to see.  Our goal was to be able to build a lot of seperate pfsense boxes.  We took a server and loaded it to the gills with dual port 1 gig nics.  We ended up with about 5 nics (10 ports).  We then assisgned each NIC to a VM so we could get 5 pfsense boxes running on each host.  We then tested without the passthrough.  We then bombed it with traffic using a traffic generator.  Our conclusion:  Passthrough greatly reduced CPU load, but not of the VM... the hypervisor CPU usage would go through the roof without the passthrough and with the passthrough it didn't do anything.  We estimated that with passthrough we could squeeze one more VM on the system.  We also did failover by using CARP on two different hosts."

I have an HP N40L running FreeNAS 9, with a few jails in it.  I do not have a pfSense installed currently on any hardware.  I want would like to run pfSense but not on a new physical machine.  So Ideally I want to run all the above as VMs.   WMC7 will be setup to use tuners over the network (pfSense will play a big part in it) A new FreeNAS installation having LSI 9240-8i passthrough to it configured as CLI. pfSense with OpenVPN server running so a family's windows machine can join my network with it's shared Ceton tuners.   This may not all work out in the end but will be a learning experience to virtulization world.  This is all up in the air, but currently I am doing this to see if shared tuners over the VPN can be a viable option.

Although this does depend on how much encoding horsepower this box has to do VPN, VPN adds major processing overhead if you don't have a crypto offload of some kind.   This simplifies things too. You'll need to set up two separate virtual networks inside ESXi though, one that's external and one that's internal (and then set up your virtual NIC's for pfSense in the right one depending on if they're internal or external).  I'm no expert at reading error messages, and haven't even run version 6 in anger yet so maybe someone else can help sort out why it's purple-screening."

""Two nodes"" mean two companies: Datacore and Starwinds. They can keep proper quorum with only two nodes and no external witness. HP VSA can keep data on two but would require physically separate witness. Others like EMC ScaleIO or recently published Nutanix ""no hardware"" will ask for a fully operational third entity."

Single, I'm assuming by the price. Some people are using the Intel PRO/1000 PT Dual-Port card in this system.  Some brief research leads me to believe that VSAN be setup across hosts of different generations/CPU models. So I guess down the track, I could always add a couple of the Intel NUCs with SATA + M.2 connectors, and set up VSAN with the original host.

vmware,3dmu2b,5mall5nail5,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:35:59 2015 UTC,Actually if you want HA you need at least Essentials Plus. Essentials is extremely barebones as far as features.
vmware,3dmu2b,cofonseca,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:54:06 2015 UTC,"Essentials is fine if you're on a tight budget and just want to virtualize, but don't want any of the features. You get licensing for 6 CPUs and vCenter, but you don't get any high availability features such as HA and vMotion, which are really the biggest benefits of virtualizing in the first place.    I would recommend at least Essentials Plus if it fits your budget. You'll have a lot more features and it really is the better choice as it allows for better redundancy, availability, and growth. You won't feel limited with Essentials Plus where as with Essentials you can't even vMotion.    All versions allow backups although you need backup software to do this. I would also recommend Veeam but there are several options out there such as Unitrends and Backup Exec.    Here's a chart that compares Essentials and Essentials Plus. You can see the difference in features.  https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere/compare"
vmware,3dmu2b,cofonseca,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:56:37 2015 UTC,Looking at the price difference between Essentials(~600) and Essentials Plus(+5000) why is there that much of a price jump just for a few extra features? Would I be able to get  VMware vSphere Standard(1296) and still have all the features of HA? It would still be cheaper if we had to buy two copies of vSphere Standard instead of buying two copies of Essentials Plus.  I have heard a lot of good things about Veeam so I will be checking them out.
vmware,3dmu2b,crymson7,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:13:42 2015 UTC,"Look here: VMwareComparison/NoEssentials  Looks like standard is your answer.  Edit: Essentials is at the bottom (for a reason)...just get Standard...especially if $1,296 is your pricing, that is a decent deal"
vmware,3dmu2b,cofonseca,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:05:03 2015 UTC,"Standard is not a kit, it's just a license for 1 CPU. Essentials Plus is a kit license for 6 CPUs. If you have three servers with 2 CPUs each, you would be covered with one Essentials Plus license, whereas with Standard you would have to buy 6 licenses. Essentials Plus is the best deal here.    The only downside to Essentials Plus is that it only allows up to 6 CPUs in the cluster. If you wanted to add a fourth server with 2 CPUs, you would have to convert your whole environment over to Standard licenses."
vmware,3dmu2b,cofonseca,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:11:51 2015 UTC,"Now I understand sorry about the confusion. Essentials Plus is the best deal there.   Couldn't you put the fourth server on a different cluster? It would just be harder to maintain but you wouldn't have to abandon a those licenses. It would seem to me a waste to purchase something like that only to outgrow it and not be able to reuse it somehow.   Is the Essential Kit on a subscription based model like the Standard, or do you buy it once and you're done?"
vmware,3dmu2b,GutGenug,3,Fri Jul 17 18:48:47 2015 UTC,"No worries, that's what questions are for!    You could absolutely put the fourth server and everything after that into a separate cluster, it just means you wouldn't be able to vMotion or failover between the Essentials cluster and the Standard cluster. It just makes management a little more difficult. If that's not a big deal for you, then you're totally fine going down that route.    Essentials requires maintenance for the first year, and you can choose to renew the maintenance each year after that. Aside from that, you only have to buy the license once and you own it forever. With maintenance, you're entitled to upgrades and technical support. The maintenance is pretty cheap if I recall correctly, so if this is for a production environment I'd absolutely recommend it."
vmware,3dmu2b,GutGenug,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:01:41 2015 UTC,"The vCenter Essentials that comes with Essential plus only allows management of up to 3 hosts.

vmware,3dmlh1,crymson7,2,Fri Jul 17 16:18:52 2015 UTC,I'd make the core redundant and create at least one dedicated iSCSI VLAN and do not create a SVI so the network is non routable.

vmware,3dk5yh,ic3b3rg,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:40:23 2015 UTC,"It's really designed to be more app centric. If you're not using the multi cloud features, the app blue printing and auto scaling you're using a vra without some of the vra features that make it strong for IaaS.  Things like workflow engine, advanced service designer, etc. entitlements aren't that hard if you think them out in advance.   Do a POC on both.

vmware,3dketf,vmwdnv,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:57:37 2015 UTC,"""Polluting the environment"" may or may not be a problem here, mostly depending on the other circumstances you never listed. For one, it will certainly increase disk I/O, and if you're close to hitting any limit on that, doing this effectively halves your speed. From your post, however, it seems this is not the case, as doing seems akin to holding the (TCP) window open.  Have you checked for concurrence problems? Other jobs on the TSM server, other workloads concurrently on the same ESX host (sharing disk or network)? Bottlenecks on ToR switch uplinks?  Also, can you post kernel version, TSM version and the types of nic and scsi adapter you're using on the VM?"

Which is exactly what's happening here.  Unfortunately, the TSM/RHEL installs are a bit of a black box to me, but I can grab that. I do know that there aren't any other concurrency issues. They are using the Paravirtual SCSI adapter with VMXNET3 NIC.   There are some bottlenecks on the FC SAN side, for sure - but when they have been doing these restores, we aren't getting alerts on latency.

vmware,3deh3f,SkullduggeryUK,4,Thu Jul 16 02:01:47 2015 UTC,"Are you using thin provisioning and dedupe?  The netapp will only offline the lun if it is thin provisioned and there is a write it is unable to commit into the volume because it is full, there is no option to autogrow and no snapshots it can auto delete. The reason to offline the volume is actually to prevent against data corruption, if it acknowledges the write when it didn't happen you are more likely to corrupt a data set.  You might have a 100gb lun in a 100gb volume but if you are using dedupe that will also create a fingerprint database of blocks inside the volume, hence you are probably better off creating the volume slightly larger. Dedupe is supposed to take 2% so in this example the dedupe would require 2gb, since dedupe is post-processing on netapp that would mean it could potentially require 102gb until dedupe savings are realised or if its not able to actually provide any savings  We had an issue in recent weeks which may or may not apply to you in that we were using an ontap version that had a bug in dedupe and stale fingerprint data was not being removed. Hence in volume that was 400gb and containing a 300gb thin provisioned lun we had the lun going offline due to there being too much dedupe data in the volume, you can check this using putty with the command 'sis status -l <vol>' and look at the stale fingerprint percentage, if its >20% then you need to look at upgrading your ontap and reinitialising the dedupe on the volume from fresh with 'sis start -s <vol>'"
vmware,3deh3f,dieth,3,Wed Jul 15 23:05:13 2015 UTC,"99% of the time that I've seen this is due to the NetApp LUNs being thin provisioned, and the real storage has been exhausted.  Never trust a Thin Provisioned LUNs reported free space. It LIES."
vmware,3deh3f,Hussod,3,Wed Jul 15 20:06:24 2015 UTC,"If the lun thought there was free space, but it went offline, you may want to check the volume on the NetApp. Where are you thin provisioning? On the vmdks? Lun? Volume? What about snapshots? Not just vm but also NetApp. Snapshots in NetApp are often on by default on volume creation and these won't be visible from the vm side.  Somewhere, something used more space than was actually available. I do agree with the idea to have the volume larger than the lun. That was my standard when I ran a NetApp. I personally ran a VMware environment on NetApp storage for quite a while, though I migrated it from FC to NFS. It proved quite reliable for the years I was at that company. It can require a bit of a different thought process from other more traditional block vendors, though.  Edit: I also want to comment on the storage vmotion thing. When you're using a block protocol on a NetApp device, it is essentially creating a file similar to a vmdk within the volume that you create it. If you thick provision the lun, it doesn't matter what happens inside that file, it's the same size within that volume. Vmware owns the file system within and controls it, but if it is thick and smaller than the volume, it can never go beyond that. However, a NetApp snapshot also lives in that same volume and can take up more space than you lun file and fill up the volume. So I don't think it is necessarily related to the vmotions, unless those caused large changes on the lun resulting in a large snapshot or thin provisioning.  Now, if you thin provision the lun, it's going to take the required amount and grow the file as needed. But NetApp can never shrink a thin provisioned block file on its own, as the remote system owns the file system and knows what is free or not. There are tools (like the VSC for vmware) that can analyze what vmware has showing as free, then shrink the actual file on the NetApp. The only way NetApp (or any array) can know what is free or not is if it owns the file system, using a file based protocol like NFS. Giving more space to the volume than the lun would be best practice and helps avoid hitting capacity between scans in this case."

If you did decide to clone the machine 'hot' you would then power down the current VM, and power up the 'new' cloned vm, and you start fresh without snapshots.  I would say that I have dealt with cleaning up a lot of infrastructure where folks have created some crazy snapshot schedules, leaving lots of nested useless snapshots. The steps I outlined above are usually how I go about resolving this as a first step.

Config: 4 hosts, 4 disk groups each with 1- 400 GB SSD and 3- 1.2 TB 10K.  2- 10 GB Links.  I did my homework (maybe not well enough) on alarms and set most of everything even following this link: http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2091347  Had a vSAN cluster maybe 20 VM's some very large one of them being LogInsight which adds A LOT of data since we have 350 hosts 4 vCenters and our View environment dumping to it.  One day noticed our LogInsight appliance was showing the warning unable to write.  Looked at the vSAN datastore and noticed it was showing 1 TB free.  After digging in with the ruby vsphere console and running vsan.disks_stats, one of the drives containing LogInsight was in fact showing 100% used.  I proceeded to add 1 more 1.2 TB drive to each disk group.  Looked at stats again and it was not dropping.  Ran vsan.resync_dashboard and there was  A LOT of data re syncing.  Based on calculation could have taken 2-3 days to complete.  So there I was with my LogInsight box down and unable to bring back up.  I decided just to blow away the LogInsight data since we were still also dumping to another syslog collector.  I reached out to support and they explained you just have to wait it out or try to delete VM's/data that were on that same disk.

There's frugal and then there's stupidly cheap. Don't be stupidly cheap."
vmware,3d73k4,cr0ft,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:10:17 2015 UTC,"I thought esx won't use a USB disk as a datastore? Are you talking about doing the copy from the shell level?  I completely agree on how stupid this is. I recently inherited this very poorly designed environment at a public school so everything was done for free. I'm slowly but surely trying to move toward a proper environment. Believe me, I express my concerns to management frequently. But unfortunately I can't write my own POs."
vmware,3d73k4,ibDennis,2,Tue Jul 14 09:54:17 2015 UTC,"Come to think of it, I guess USB datastores aren't doable, just USB as a boot drive, my bad.   The easiest way would probably be to have another machine - laptop or something - on the same network and then and creating an NFS share to the external drive, then mounting that over the network as a datastore and copying the files datastore-to-datastore. So you'll need to find some hard drive space somehow, somewhere. Fortunately hard drives are pretty darn cheap, and having an external drive around for various stuff later can be helpful. You can get an external 6TB USB drive for a little over $200."
vmware,3d73k4,mike-foley,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:36:09 2015 UTC,"That's the setup I tried. I dug up a desktop machine that I could take to the remote sites. I installed Ubuntu on a 2TB sata disk and set up an NFS server. I put it on the same switch as the ESX host, mounted the NFS share and started the copy through the vSphere client. For some reason though it ignores thin provisioning and copies the full sized -flat file and it took over 12 hours to copy 256GB, I still have another terabyte to go and it's just not going to fit in my maint window to copy over and back. Just an ugly situation all around."
vmware,3d73k4,Kennocha,3,Tue Jul 14 12:09:41 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately you are looking at down time in this scenario. The only real workaround for this would be the following(and there are alot of ifs here):  1.) Use personal hardware. Get a tower and install 4.1 on it(same build) Please be aware that as 4.1 is end of life, access to the image from vmware is only possible through certain channels.  Minimum requirements are here: http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1003661  If you have at least the minimum requirements, then there are 2 possible workarounds.  On the slim chance you have the same processor in the tower (I know it's a very slim chance, but worth mentioning just incase) you could present the storage to the ESXi, download a trial version of vCenter 5.x and live migrate the vm's across to the temporary ESXi.  Failing this then you might be able to work around this with vm converter if you do not have the same processor. This will allow you to ""live"" copy the vm's across hosts.   I know both of these options are long shots, but they are the only way to not have an interruption in your running state.   Other than these, the only way would be to power off all VM's. Copy them to an external storage for back up if the upgrade process goes wrong.   Once copied over to the storage, remove all vm's from inventory and A clean install of 5.x on your ESXi would be the best as long as the host is on the HCL:   http://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/search.php  I hope this helps, it certainly is a horrible situation to be in. I know you mentioned money isn't possible but as cr0ft said ""There's frugal and then there's stupidly cheap. Don't be stupidly cheap."" This 100 times over.   Otherwise you will have to inform your boss that this host will need routine maintenance. Monthly, if not weekly reboots and updates.   Without a second host anda proper back up policy, then VM clones are your best back up policy. Clone the critical VM's, rename them and leave them powered off. If anything happens to the primary you'll at least have these to fall back on. (If something happens at the storage level there is no real recovery without back-ups, or a very big bank account)"

We have two datacenters over moderate speed low latency WAN and I was considering VCSA w/ PSC on an external host per best practice. However, it just seemed like more management overhead and more headaches if the datacenter hosting the PSC has a disaster.   It seems like a decent topology for multi-cluster inside the same datacenter but not ideal over WAN."
vmware,3d1igh,binkbankb0nk,2,Mon Jul 13 01:08:10 2015 UTC,"Correct. At least one PSC per datacenter. External PSC just means that it's not on the same server as vCenter. He probably has two vCenter, each one with a PSC.  We have 4 vCenter, each with a PSC. It's really the way to go."

vmware,3d1igh,binkbankb0nk,2,Mon Jul 13 04:10:33 2015 UTC,We have it 1-to-1 and let the PSCs take care of the replication. If you wanted redundancy I would look at the VMware documentation on putting the PSC behind a load balancer. The only reason we use the external PSC is to separate the load. This is how I rationalized the switching from an external SQL database to the embedded Postgres database. Perhaps someone can speak to having it all on one server but from what I remember reading it is best to have it separated unless it is very small like 50 VMs. Our main site is 250 VMs and the other three are less than 100. We could do it all on one server at two of our sites but we just did it the same at all sites for simplicity.
vmware,3d1igh,itsbond,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:36:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a good idea, part of the reason I was looking to switch to VCSA was the SQL server licensing. My environment is a lot smaller than that but it seems to be more cost effective considering how MS is pricing SQL, it's ridiculous.   I guess what I'm looking at now is the benefit of external PSCs to support linked mode or internal PSCs and no linked mode; the VMware guides suggest internal PSCs w/ linked mode is not recommended deployment, I can't figure out why though.   Seems like you're just trading management overhead on two separate systems, I either need to deal with two additional servers or with one additional vCenter domain."

VMware has said again and again that they're going to kill off the thick client...

Granted, I started with vSphere in the 4.1/5.0 era (I'm in my 20s).  To be fair, there are still some things you (unfortunately) still need the thick client for: VUM, SRM, and other 3rd party extensions that haven't jumped the shark to the web client. I was honestly surprised that VMware hasn't sorted out how to place VUM services on the PSC - it sounded like they were really pushing for that to happen in v6.  Switching gears, the web client in v6 is pretty decent. I was not at all happy with the v5.5 web client - extremely slow and laggy. v6 is much improved, although there's still room for improvement.  An HTML5 interface would be quite welcome... I've heard murmurings that this may be on the horizon (no cross-product puns intended), but I've also heard murmurings that this may not hit until v7 to give vendors time to migrate to web client plugins before changing the architecture again.   Edit: SRM is actually part of the web client now. Oops."

vmware,3cvpsz,jmgc77,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:27:39 2015 UTC,"Those of us who ploughed through the vSphere 6 Beta 1 will remember an OS X client briefly existed.  Titled the ""Host Client"" it was designed to replace the fat client on both Windows and Mac OS X (and potentially Linux) by finally allowing direct ESXi management.  Did it work? Yes. Did it work well? Sadly no. Mainly due to the fact that it was actually a horrendous Apache Tomcat powered mini version of the vSphere Web Client and drained system resources like crazy. I still have it installed when I need a reminder it existed. Unfortunately VMware u-turned in the Beta 2 builds and reverted back to just the .Net fat client.  I honestly think a pure HTML5 client is the only way to go now for real cross-platform support. When I posed this question to CTO Joe Baguley at a recent VMUG in London his response was to look at the work in the vROps and EVO:RAIL interfaces for an answer (pure HTML with no Flash). A well designed Node.js solution should easily match the perceived faster performance of the fat client."

At that point just copy everything out of the directory, let the install bomb, then copy everything back."

Outside of some bad ASIC's on 6610's (which support admitted and replaced overnight even though we didn't have that SLA). I've had nothing but great performance with iSCSI and them.  As far as VDX I hear the early days were rough for layer 3 functionality, but route bridges work fine now and outside of a few quirks (no RP for multi-cast which is easy enough to offload, not playing nice with Cisco WAC doing proxy arp) I've been pretty impressed with them."

NL-SAS shouldn't be used for production workloads unless you have something smarter to handle tiring (VSAN/Nimble etc) and doing that with De-dupe is potentially worse (You have basically low latency tape disks from a performance perspective and your cramming even more data into them)."

However SRM is now supported on VCSA 6 so there less of a reason to keep away from it for me. Also if I were to move to VCSA I would simply put VUM on a general IT utility VM.  In my experience and opinion (and also in my specific environments) some advantages of VCSA 6 would be: * I have had a very unique power issue where we lost power, UPS and generator and everything was shut off dirty. Getting things to come up in the right order was quite painful. vCenter Server has dependencies on DNS, AD and SQL which also had dependencies on AD and DNS. In this scenario a self contained VCSA would be advantageous due to less dependencies on other systems like SQL. * We have a lot of our functions like AD, AV and server patching moved and managed (begrudgingly) to our off-shored in-sourced IT. This always causes issues with Windows server patching and antivirus exceptions/scans and general AD/DNS issues. Having a Linux based appliance means we remove the vCenter server from all of those potential issues and further dependencies.  Either way I'm still researching options as to which way I go."

Super micro doesn't really have anything to do with the LSI health pass through.   I had to go through the same problem with our previous generation LSI RAID controller on SuperMicro servers. You might need to wait for the vib update from VMware or LSI.   You should definitely check for an update vSphere 6 vib on the LSI web site for the 9361-8i. You have the secondary issue of being able to manage the controller using the LSI MegaRAID Storage Manager which I originally thought was slow and not responsive only to find out the LSI management software was some of the best available. The others must really be bad.   The CIM vib is going to get you the health pass though while the SAS vib update is going to get you the MegaRAID capability.   Check the LSI website for their model and chipset (SAS3108).

Zerto takes the cake, if you can afford it. Veeam is still great, if you can afford it, but Zerto's failover mechanism and RPO from VCD <-> VCD can't be touched. Jesus, they probably even give you long enough of a trial to pull this off, depending on the size, and how well you prepare yourself.  EDIT: And you can schedule with each customer."

You can try to schedule maintenance windows with customers and then just clone VMs, add to inventory in the new/chosen vCenter, then re-import into the vCloud instance.  You could also look into using vCloud Connector to bridge the two instances. It may streamline some of that migration process for you. But either way, it involves downtime."

It should be a collection of objects considering its being used in a foreach statement, but given that you use it in the first statement of the foreach code block leads me to believe that its just a single object, which would mean the foreach statement isn't really doing anything.  Also you are assigning the N-th value of the $testVM collection (assuming it even is a collection) to the $Testvm.Name value which just doesn't make any sense.    I'm honestly just guessing here, but i think this is what you are looking for.  $myReport = @()  get-vm | %{  $dummy = """" | Select Name,Param0,Filter1Name  $testvm = $_ | Get-View  $dummy.name = $testvm.Name  $dummy.Param0 = ($testvm.Config.ExtraConfig | where {$_.Key -eq ""ethernet0.filter1.param0""}).Value  $dummy.Filter1Name = ($testvm.Config.ExtraConfig | where {$_.Key -eq ""ethernet0.filter1.name""}).Value  $myReport += $dummy  $dummy = $null  }  $myReport"

Our database is highly transactional, averaging 800 to 1200 transactions a second.

Additionally if these sites are easily accessible, you can always put the vmkernel port on a private network and plug in when you need to manage it (stupidly huge pain, I'm a huge proponent for remote access especially in foreign locations).

The issue does affect throughput, ive been watching the speeds with Rsync (ubuntu) as well as terracopy or just the windows explorer copy on windows. It starts out around 70-80 MB/s which is what I would expect but then will slow down to under 1 MB/s for a couple seconds and then jump back up to 70-80, sometimes pausing in the middle around 20 or 50 MB/s. It affects how long the file transfers take significantly, you can see the progress bars almost stop.  I dont think this makes a difference but I'm mostly moving 2-10GB .mkv files to the NAS.

vmware,3ck6pl,sillymaniac,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:50:45 2015 UTC,"Also have a look at the CPU Ready time for the VM to see if it's getting a lot of contention. I'd guess with 8 cores you are probably seeing quite a bit of ready time, which definitely could be the cause."
vmware,3ck6pl,Ghan_04,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:38:46 2015 UTC,What is a normal amount of ready time? I assume a small amount would be normal  Thanks
vmware,3ck6pl,AncientsofMumu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:53:51 2015 UTC,Depends. VMware says 5 percent per vCPU is OK but I really like to have around 2-3 percent for 2 vCPUs and 4-5 percent for 4 vCPU machines at max.  You should really downsize the VM. Try 4 cores.
vmware,3ck6pl,ser_rhaegar,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:03:33 2015 UTC,"I would try to keep it lower than 5% if possible, but it does vary somewhat based on the environment and the workload. 10% or more starts to be very concerning.  The best thing you can do is start new VMs at 1 vCPU and then only increase as necessary based on the workload."

vmware,3chv6a,miniman,7,Wed Jul 8 01:40:15 2015 UTC,i feel the same way about vsan.  I remember reading a post on yellow-bricks where Duncan was showing how low the BOM was and the comment that caught my eye was someone calling him out about the extreme licensing costs.  http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2015/03/31/all-flash-vsan-configuration-example/
vmware,3chv6a,whinner,5,Wed Jul 8 02:17:03 2015 UTC,Love VSAN as a technology. The price point is a giant turn-off.
vmware,3chv6a,vmwdnv,0,Wed Jul 8 17:14:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, VSAN is not really for the lower end. I think it does have great value, but you need to be willing to drop some serious money into each individual server in order to load them with enough drives to make the licensing cost worth it. In that linked post, I really don't see the point in going VSAN there since you are talking such a small amount of space per node. I suppose it only makes sense if for some reason you are hard limited by your available rack space and have to use the highest density you can get."
vmware,3chv6a,Ghan_04,0,Wed Jul 8 02:39:09 2015 UTC,I see some possible value in test environments.  We're building a test environment and are going to be using our VMware Eval licenses from the VMUG advantage to run it which comes with VSAN licenses.

vmware,3cfioe,Thats_a_lot_of_nuts,2,Tue Jul 7 22:23:38 2015 UTC,"LACP as a certain... randomness.  It balences based on hash's, so a connection from an iSCSI imitator to a single target isn't going to use multiple links.  This gets more fun as you might have one path completely saturated out, and 20% on the other link (actually this is common on LACP).  iSCSI MPIO meanwhile will try to actually balance every xxx amount of bytes between paths.    This gets annoying when you need to hop multiple switches, or want to run converged networking.  In this case I can't recommend enough Brocade's VDX/VCS Ethernet fabric, as it will form a layer 1 link bond automatically and perfectly load balance (with zero configuration required, just plug them in and they figure it out at the ASIC level)."
vmware,3cfioe,lost_signal,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:36:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this. Was only thinking of LACP for connecting the switches together for a high bandwidth inter-switch connection (which happens to carry the iSCSI vLAN) - but I take your point.  I agree MPIO is the best way for iSCSI, but why then do lots of vendors of iSCSI SANs advocate using LACP to connect the controllers to switches in reference architectures? Is it right to use in this scenario, just not at the ESXi host to switch layer?"

You can use LDAP accounts in the same way.. Best way though is what another user posted.. by Using Folders..  Create a folder (Name it MOM'S VM's).  And add permissions to that folder.  Then they will only be able to see those.   Better than VM Specific permissions.

vmware,3cfjve,tastefulcardigan,2,Tue Jul 7 14:57:56 2015 UTC,"My question relates to moving some of the existing workloads from the current AMD hosts to the Intel ones, within the confines of the vCloud Director installation. This isn't documented anywhere, and I can think of several nasty hacks and time consuming workarounds to achieve it - but I can't think of an elegant way to move workloads in vCD between AMD and Intel compute resources.   Going to require downtime unless you really wanna go rogue on it. Easiest way would be to take the VMs you're looking to migrate, power off their vApp and then export to a template in a catalog that is shared among the multiple OvDCs. Then, just deploy from the new template in the OvDC that is backed by the Intel PvDC.   As you mentioned...there are other ways to go about it. But it's so unsupported/theoretical I'd be scared to do it in a lab environment let alone prod. Just for reference, migrating live would require the CPU compatibility check to be disabled in VC (yup...), XvMotion the VMs to the new storage and new hosts while keeping your fingers crossed that the VMs don't panic due to the new PCPU architecture they would be running on then dive into the vCD DB to change a handful of MOIDs and let vCD know where the VMs new home is."

From the 2 hosts above though with both hosts at 80%+ usage, I don't think DRS would even be able to make any recommendations to act on, you really need a 3rd host, or get these 2 more RAM and the same GB capacity for an N+1 should a failure occur. If you don't have the license for DRS, I don't think VCOPS is going to work properly even when you bring it back into the cluster.  With your environment, I'm not sure what VCOPS is really going to do for you, you already know you are pretty limited on everything.

I suggested we move the vCPU's down but the software began to spit out errors.   That being said - the only way I can stop these guys from running away with 15+ Ghz (as far as I see) is to throttle them down with limits. I just spent some time watching coStop and %ready and found a ""sweat"" spot where the coStop drops but the host isn't tapped out for resources.   I'm trying to understand how the limiting is effecting the vCPU, and consequently effecting coStop/Ready. Am I hard limiting each vCPU to 1ghz in the above example? Or can one vCPU use 2Ghz leaving another vCPU with .500Ghz to use? I'm also trying to get a good understanding of how this is effecting theoretical scheduling, costop  indicates to me  that there's a high skew between each vCPU correct? Is this worse because of the limiting?"
vmware,3cb6kr,admin_all_the_things,2,Mon Jul 6 17:43:04 2015 UTC,Read the link I posted in the above thread.  If the software needs 4 CPUs then give it 4 single core sockets.  Let ESXi handle the NUMA allocation.  By giving it to many CPUs you're actually either locking up resources and chocking other VMs or it will sit ready for way to long.

vmware,3cb6kr,admin_all_the_things,0,Mon Jul 6 18:08:44 2015 UTC,"Another thing, even if you did limit the CPU clock cycles given to the VM it still needs to schedule the vCPU calls to the pCPUs.  In this case if you don't have 6 threads open at the same time on the pCPU it will wait and wait and wait, so with mhz cap you're degrading the performance even more."
vmware,3cb6kr,godzilr1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:25:45 2015 UTC,Which is very very possible since I now I have 2-6vCPU and 2-4vCPU on an isolated host with 12pCPUs.
vmware,3cb6kr,admin_all_the_things,0,Tue Jul 7 01:48:19 2015 UTC,"So here is a very simplified explanation of how CPU scheduling works in ESXi.  If you have 12 pCPUs (Be it 6 cores and 2 threads or 12 cores or do you have 12 cores and 24 threads?) and you right now have 4 VMs over subscribed at a 1.6:1 ratio (Assuming you actually only have 12 CPU threads) which in itself isn't bad it's how you've done it.  When ESXi schedules your CPU tasks it needs to have space for all the vCPUs of a particular VM at a certain time.  So in this case if you have one 6 CPU VM running and one 4 CPU running you only have 2 available pCPUs left and you don't actually have enough space left to run any other VMs so what happens so is those VMs sit there.  While they are sitting there they are in a state of CPU Ready (Read more on it here and here)  On the flip side if you you had those two 4 vCPU VM running you would be able to not run any of the 6 vCPU VMs since they would only have 4 pCPUs available.  This is why it is far better to start small and add CPUs as needed and backed up by metrics.  The VMware best practices are to create VMs as 1 socket and 1 core, now very few OS' can happily run on that so I recommend 2 sockets and 1 core for all VMs as a base.  I am currently over subscribed about 3:1 for vCPUs to pCPUs but 95% of my VMs are two sockets and one core each so this gives me a lot of flexibility in my scheduling.  Talk to your developers, I have found that they don't really understand how virtualizing works and think virtual maps at a 1:1 ratio in how hardware used to do it but it doesn't.  See if you can convince them to do a beta run of some of those VMs (You determine the most viable candidate based on actual resource usage shown in the resource monitor and their feed back.) on either two sockets or 4 sockets and see if that improves your performance."
vmware,3cb6kr,godzilr1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:04:28 2015 UTC,"I had a good understanding of this, however I'm left with one question.  Does a VM have a automatic limit of Ghz compared to the vCPU's that are placed in the vm, or does it have no theoretical limit.  For example, a virtual NIC in a vm has no clock speed, so while the Nic is rated at 10Gbe - it can (theoretically) produce enough traffic to saturate all the physical nics on the host.  Could a VM with 2 vCPU produce more than 5Ghz ( 2x my pCPU@2.5ghz ), in which cause I would still need to place a hard cpu limit on the vm to make sure it doesn't use more?   Or does giving the VM 2vCPU then cap the VM from using more than 2x2.5Ghz of the pCPU's Ghz?"

It is limited by the physical processor it is scheduled to run on. If it is given two sockets and those sockets are 2.5Ghz it would have an aggregate of 5Ghz but each thread would only be 2.5Ghz, it can't exceed this since that would require more clock cycles from a processor it isn't assigned.   Or does giving the VM 2vCPU then cap the VM from using more than 2x2.5Ghz of the pCPU's Ghz?    Lets say you have a 10 core socket with each core running at 2.5 Ghz and no hyper threading.  This gives you an aggregate of 25Ghz but no one process could actually perform at 25Ghz since each core only runs at 2.5 Ghz.

Without a VC, you're fairly limited.  One option that comes to mind would be to shut down the VM's, manually make a copy, power up the VM and copy the 'copy' to a USB/physical drive.  Worry about delta changes later (or if possible, communicate NO changes will be replicated until the new instance is online elsewhere, etc.).  If you're unable to copy 250 GB of a 'clone' at 1Gbps I'd be suspicious of your topology, NAS, etc.  EDIT:  I'd also be using rsync to get the data from the 'clone' to USB/physical/etc.  Other options to consider would be Ghetto backup scripts, Unitrends (I believe) still has a free version of their VM backup which does not require ESX licensing, etc.  Good luck!"

In order to prepare for this, a few days ago I P2V'd one of our servers (it was just running straight Win2k8r2) so that I could run all the leave-behind VMs on that host.  The P2V went great, and I now have a blank host running Vsphere 6.  Both of our hosts have hardware RAID local storage (RAID 1 or RAID 10 w/ 7200 rpm drives).  The idea was that operating systems and databases get stored on the local storage, and bulk data stored out on the NASes.  Unfortunately, someone gave a PFY the passwords, and he moved a bunch of the VMs to live on an NFS share on the NAS so they could be backed up.  The Evac plan basically has us grabbing the NAS holding the VMs (and all our other data) along with the host that holds our databases, and packing them out.  That part of it is fairly straight forward.  The trouble is prying out the two VMs that I need to leave behind to maintain a functional network."

The only thing I can think of is that the host that I'm trying to push the stay-behind VMs to is a fresh installation (It used to be 2k8r2 which I p2v'd to the other host), and I haven't installed any of the VIBs from HP on it yet, so the 410 raid controller might not be operating optimally?"

It is pretty consistent here, it gets about 2GB into the write, then slows right now.

vmware,3c0cfy,ditka,3,Fri Jul 3 17:09:18 2015 UTC,"(This isn't a VMWare-specific answer, but hopefully I can still be helpful.)  Using dd isn't going to help: that produces a block-by-block copy.  Also, what (exactly) is your goal?  Do you want the actual disk usage of the virtual disk to reflect the amount of data stored, or do you want to change the logical/virtual size of the disk to 10 GiB?  What does the partition layout of the 20 GiB disk look like?  Is it the usual Ubuntu default of an ext2 filesystem for /boot and an ext4 filesystem for /?  Are you using LVM?  In any case, it sounds like you are willing to turn the guest off, which makes this much easier.  If you want to zero unused blocks and sparsify the virtual disk to reduce actual disk usage (from the host's perspective), look at a tool like virt-sparsify.  If you just want to zero unused blocks (something like what fstrim does for SSDs), take a look at zerofree.  (I use this to reduce the size of compressed snapshots, which can be helpful e.g. when moving snapshots over the network, since zeroes compress very nicely.)  If you want to reduce the logical size of the disk (so that the guest sees a 10 GiB disk), then back up the guest's disk (just in case), boot the guest from a live CD (or anything other than its disk) and   Use resize2fs to shrink the filesystem (e.g. resize2fs /dev/sda2 9G).  You can figure out exactly how large you need the filesystem to be so that you wind up with a 10 GiB disk, or you can ""over-shrink"" it here and re-expand it slightly later. Then you need to shrink the partition that contains the filesystem.  Use parted (or gparted, if you prefer a GUI) to delete the existing partition and then create a new partition that is identical to the old one (same start sector, same type, etc.) except for being smaller.  It needs to be big enough to hold the resized filesystem from the previous step. Now you should be able to resize the actual disk image.  (Double-check your partition table: everything should be in the first half of the disk now.)  You can do this from the host side using whatever tools are appropriate to the disk format you're using (e.g. vmdk, vdi, qcow2, etc.); or, you can use a tool like dd to just copy the first 10 GiB of the 20 GiB disk to a new 10 GiB disk. If you ""over-shrunk"" the partition, expand it to fill the entire 10 GiB disk.  Then, if you ""over-shrunk"" the filesystem, expand it to fill the entire partition. Use e2fsck (assuming you're using ext2/3/4) to verify that the filesystem hasn't been damaged.   Good luck!"

vmware,3c0cfy,lunarsunrise,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:28:53 2015 UTC,"Well, now, a disk can't have a ""type"" like ext4; it probably has a label (aka a partition table), which will be either MBR or GPT; and then it has one or more partitions, which each contain a filesystem (such as an ext4 filesystem).  If you're sure that you'd just rather the disk be smaller, you can try the list of steps at the end of my comment above.  I might be tempted, though, to suggest that you just try virt-sparsify.  You don't need to mess with shrinking or enlarging partitions, and the guest won't notice that anything has changed.  The actual host-side disk usage of the disk image will reflect the number of disk sectors that actually have something on them.  This will be, approximately, the size of the files stored on the disk plus the size of the guest filesystem's metadata.  For example, here is an image that contains a clean, minimal install of Ubuntu 15.04:  Usage  Logical  File 498M   1.3G     bases/ubuntu15.04_min_2015.06.21_2.qcow2   (This is not preallocated, so the guest sees this is as an 8 GiB disk.  If you used ls, or du -b, on the host, you'd see it as 1.3 GiB.  However, it's a sparse file, so there are ""holes"" in the 1.3 GiB file that are treated as all zeroes, and only 498 MiB of the host's disk space is occupied.)"
vmware,3c0cfy,RulerOf,2,Fri Jul 3 17:43:41 2015 UTC,"Well, now, a disk can't have a ""type"" like ext4; it probably has a label (aka a partition table), which will be either MBR or GPT; and then it has one or more partitions, which each contain a filesystem (such as an ext4 filesystem).   I like you ;)"
vmware,3c0cfy,MisterIT,0,Sat Jul 4 00:10:45 2015 UTC,"A partition table isn't a label at all, and GPT v. MBR merely describes the scheme in which the disk is partitioned. In the case of MBR, the partition table itself is chainloaded from the MBR and describes the layout of primary and logical partitions on the disk. It can also have flags that do things like set it as bootable."
vmware,3c0cfy,lunarsunrise,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:29:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you for trying to help, but I think that most of your information is incorrect.   A partition table isn't a label at all   It literally is.  See e.g. the parted manual's description of the mklabel command, which is how you create a partition table.  The footnote explicitly mentions that ""everyone seems to have a different word for 'disk label' — these are all the same thing: partition table, partition map.""   GPT v. MBR merely describes the scheme in which the disk is partitioned   Yes; they are types of disk labels (aka partition tables).   In the case of MBR, the partition table itself is chainloaded from the MBR   No.  Wikipedia has a very thorough description of what a Master Boot Record looks like.  Chainloading is something entirely separate.  Wikipedia also describes it: ""chain loading replaces the currently executing program in its entirety.""  In the context of booting a computer, you could chainload the MBR (which is an imprecise way of talking about chainloading the bootloader that the MBR typically contains, which is executable); this involves some other program (probably some other bootloader) transfering control to that bootloader.  As an example, you see chainloading sometimes when you're using PXE or iPXE to boot a disk image.  The partition table is also part of the MBR (on an MBR-labeled disk) but cannot be chainloaded because it is not executable.    In any event, your response ignores the context of my comment, which is that it is relatively rare for disks to directly contain filesystems.  Generally, the disk is partitioned, and each partition contains a filesystem."

Sometimes, for testing purposes, i will install a new vm, snapshot, setup services, snapshot, and run a test. That way i can revert back to post install/pre services so i can set them up differently. Or i can rerun a test from a good, known state.  However, my use cases revolve around testing. So, maybe your are thinking about production systems.

vmware,3byzu7,ikiris04,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:23:11 2015 UTC,its all a management preference. Dvswitch helps you to avoid configuring port groups on individual hosts so the more hosts that are managed under it the better. If a host does not have all of the same port groups then you should probably spin up a new dvswitch.
vmware,3byzu7,krissey,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:55:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I have split mine because of network design such as LACP in one cluster and/or 1G vs 10G. Otherwise if both clusters have the same portgroups there's no reason to split, unless you want to."

vmware,3byzu7,trueg50,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:11:29 2015 UTC,"Depends on your needs. If you are using something like vShield Edge, then you will have to have the clusters share a dvSwitch.  If the clusters don't share every port group, you should be very careful with your documentation so you can know what can/cannot run at each site.   In conversations with VMware I've been told that the only real restriction is that dvSwitch updates you make in vCenter can take several additional milliseconds to update your more remote hosts."

If you had an ESXi host with exposure to both dvswitches you can potentially move the Edge device, or if you did some funky work with designating alternate ports as ""management"" on a host with both dvswitches, but its not an easy/painless/zero downtime move.  A more recommended remediation step is to use the same dvswitch across clusters.   Also if you are in a DR situation and wish to recover your edges at another site, you can't just have the edges ""undeployed"" and pick different port groups you need those original dvswitches.  vShield Edges also can only be deployed into one datacenter, and cannot be moved to another, and that is a hard restriction without a work around."

I've been aware, through several contacts of mine that they're in the process of corporate shenanigans of ""cutting the fat"", where a very good, nice to work for company becomes more like a modern version of a sweatshop.  Outsourcing departments to ""low cost centers"" for no good reason, laying off hundreds of workers because they're in the wrong demographic area.  All this corporate 'slimming' doesn't suit me and the company has been going down this road for longer than I think anyone would like to admit.  Management seems content to rely on inane metrics generated by people with no concept of what the ground-level workers actually do; then proceed to pass judgement on their lowest-end workers based on these made up metrics that have little, if anything to do with the actual job performance of the workers.  I can't state it strongly enough: what management THINKS you should do, isn't necessarily the best thing for the customer.  Every customer is different, and having a support team, and customer service team, that's flexible and able to bend to accommodate the customer in your market segment to give them the best possible experience, well, those skills are not something you can measure by call time, tickets resolved or time to resolution.  These metrics mean less than what the customers really want; and it's not always a ""lean mean"" machine of workers placating management with metrics."
vmware,3bpa5m,MystikIncarnate,10,Wed Jul 1 05:51:20 2015 UTC,"Is anyone surprised?  I've worked for VARs, MSPs, Consulting companies, and various other jobs that employed a multitude of charlatans and honest people on a great many levels and on all sides of the spectrum.  If the proverbial client ""bites"" when a salesperson throws out the first line, then it's on the salesperson to make sure that the client gets what they've been told they're paying for, or to make sure the client understands what they're getting before they sign on the bottom line.  Most MSP's I've been with, and CERTAINLY the VAR resellers, manually adjusted prices on the fly based on how much effort they thought the buyer was going to engage them on.  This all has to be done at the quote stage, before a site survey. You're being ""shopped"".  That's almost impossible to do with a MAS deal for something like VMWare which has a lot of security options and therefore loopholes that could impact various institutions.  Sales usually come with support contracts.   The trick is to make sure you can retain their business.  It's why the whole enterprise software industry doesn't provide prices up front.  It's shitty, but it's easy to discount someone who is almost zero overhead and raise prices on serious problem clients.  That being said, with the number of government regulations involved in anything, I'd overprice the fuck out of it too.  Not to rip off taxpayers, but for the pure fact of MASSIVE SLOW RED TAPE for EVERY SINGLE DECISION.  If they really thought VMWare overcharged, for that work, VMWare is usually pretty good about discounts on next year's licensing.  Interesting that they let it go to judgement.  Also, it's worth noting that the DoJ hits up HANDFULS of companies every year for a great many reasons.  Most of their investigations are not speedy either and require e-mail holds (blech, don't miss doing those).  You don't have to be in the wrong for a DoJ investigation, but if you don't file your paperwork in their idea of a timely fashion, you're going to be in for a lot of faxing and other secure mailings if your stuff is still on paper.  $75 million is a pittance compared to what taxpayers spend on government software."

While it would be nice to incorporate your hosts into a larger cluster so you can more effectively use your compute, you are far better off just leaving Oracle on its own as their licensing auditors tend to be stupid and will try to get you for licensing the whole cluster regardless of the affinity rules you put in place.  Having gone through a couple true ups, I can tell you it isn't fun and they are the most unforgiving set of henchmen/women ever devised to do licensing audits...I am betting Ellison had them genetically engineered to be as nitpicky as he could..."
vmware,3bqc2z,crymson7,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:06:00 2015 UTC,"It seems that it is OK to use affinity rules, but I would love to get an answer to my question above anyway. Better safe than sorry etc.   From white paper Understanding Oracle Certification, Supportand Licensing for VMware Environments   Scenario B: Partially Licensed Clusters  When a customer does not have enough Oracle application instances to justify creating a dedicated cluster for those applications, only a subset of the hosts in the cluster are licensed for the Oracle application. In this situation, the customer must be careful to restrict the movement of Oracle application instances and virtual machines to only those hosts that are licensed to run the product.  In this case, DRS Host Affinity rules can be used to appropriately restrict the movement of virtual machines within the cluster. DRS Host Affinity is a vSphere feature that enables you to ensure that your Oracle applications are restricted to move only between a subset of the hosts—that is, not all hardware in the cluster is “available” to the Oracle software. DRS Host Affinity is a clustering technology, not a mechanism for soft or hard partitioning of individual servers, and it enables you to design your environment such that the Oracle workloads are free to run on fully licensed hosts inside the cluster. Customers can easily maintain records for compliance purposes as explained in section 2.3.  The advantages of this approach are similar to the advantages achieved with a fully licensed cluster. Because customers are typically able to increase the utilization of licensed processors, they reduce license requirements. However, consolidation ratios tend to be lower, because advanced vSphere features can be employed only on a smaller subset of the hosts."
vmware,3bqc2z,hulagalula,2,Wed Jul 1 08:11:30 2015 UTC,"First, read you contract with Oracle, this is really the only document that really matters.  Using DRS rules is usually a valid approach as you only need to pay for licensing hosts where Oracle is installed or has run. You can also consider mounting the datastores to only the relevant hosts in the cluster as well (this is in contrast to my normal preference for a homogenous mapping of datastores to hosts in a cluster).  If you go down this route and are audited you should remain firm and refer to the legal contract you have with Oracle. If you have never run the Oracle VM on a host then you don't need to license it for Oracle. I would also advise you to consider the hassle of justifying this to the auditor and fighting any misconceptions on their side, in the end it may just be less hassle and less risk to your time to keep it set up as a separate cluster. There is an opportunity cost to haggling with licensing auditors when you could be doing more productive things with your time."

vmware,3bnb8q,Piwosz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:17:23 2015 UTC,"Hi Piwosz, thanks so much for your reply!!!  I am still learning something everyday about the product so I might not have followed the best path.  When I am referring to the need to utilize more than one logic path, I am referring to vCAC Designer vs vCO Workflow Stubs, with vCAC designer, every machine that gets built/provisioned with vCAC will utilize the vCAC designer .NET logic path, whereas if you utilize vCO WFStubs with blueprint specific assigned workflows, you can tailor each blueprint to a different build/provision/unprovision/delete process by associating a Workflow Stub with a specific blueprint and unique workflow.  Our customer levied a requirement to utilize vCAC in such a way that utilizing vCAC designer for changes to machine provisioning would lead to long and arduous logic paths when we needed to update or adjust individual blueprints so the course of action that I took ( I hope ) is logical.  Like I said before though, I am still learning everyday so I definitely open to suggestions.  To your second point, some of it could be and is done via the guest scripts kicked off via the vCloud machine agent ( gugent package ), but other things, like creating AD Objects and keytabs for our linux machines still must be via vCO workflow at provisioning.  I may have misread the error, so I double-checked what you asked on the vCO server, but I show a green light and a functioning vCO PostGRE SQL database.  I think the error is on the IAAS SQL instance.  In this case, we are utilizing the built-in PostgreSQL database instance in the vCO appliance, the trouble I am having is with the MSSQL Express instance on the IAAS Windows Server that serves as the DEM worker host for vCAC worker threads.  In vCloud 5.5, this is a Windows systems running an IIS instance due to .NET requirements."

AFAIK running the ""Update vCAC workflow stubs to run vCO workflows"" workflow in vCO just wipes the current state of the wf stubs  of your choosing (that you have created using the vCO Customization workflow) and ups the revision number. During that it uses the model manager data component to access the DB... has the service account which you use to run the iaas services all the required permissions on the sql server?"

vmware,3bnb88,Robulus,2,Tue Jun 30 19:39:04 2015 UTC,"Seconded, /u/sryan2k1 is right on the money.  The folder will only change when a VM's datastore changes.  The GUID will be updated with the new file names when you SvMotion because there are locks on the files while the VM is running that lock in the name.  The reason SvMotion can change the name is because the new files have no locks on them until the compute is moved over to use them to run.  This also includes the folder name, which doesn't change either, because of said locks...  To make it a metaphor...would you rename explorer.exe while your Windows was up and running?"

vmware,3blnhe,AArleo,2,Tue Jun 30 06:23:14 2015 UTC,"I would add to this that if possible I would recommend just doing clean installs of ESXi 6.0.

So long as the network names are the same VMs should just run fine."

vmware,3blnhe,admin_all_the_things,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:22:55 2015 UTC,vCenter is a bit more annoying. You're pretty much stuck with upgrading it unless you want to rebuild all of your permissions and historical data. I was more referring to the ESXi systems.
vmware,3blnhe,friedrice5005,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:15:07 2015 UTC,Not necessarily.  You can easily set up another VM for vcenter and just point the DSN to the existing database.

If you're just wanting to cap the test resources so you can still run your test albeit at a potentially degraded level you could implement resource pools.  You would basically carve up your CPU and Memory into shares that each pool can take from, you only see degradation when there is system contention so if there is none everyone runs at 100%, when there is some the lower shares take a hit as they wait for resources.  For disk and network IO depending on your license and version you could use Storage I/O Control and Network I/O Control to cap your test environment so it doesn't hit prod.  You could also carve off a seperate LUN or seperate storage, all depends on your environment and IO needs.  So this is general advice, more detailed advice would require more detailed information."

vmware,3bjct7,IArgueWithAtheists,3,Mon Jun 29 18:25:03 2015 UTC,Is this just a proof of concept? The Mac mini are not on the VMware HCL so there is zero guarantee for device drivers or support from VMware at all.  You're probably going to instantly run into memory contention right away and likely too see page swapping which is going to make the VMs run pretty slow.   Having only one spindle disk for the direct connected VM data stores is also going to cause high disk latency when the VMs are actively using the disks.   Make sure you start with 1vcpu on each of the VMs except for vCenter which will be two vCPU minimum. With that tiny of hardware your going to hit cpu contention quickly.   How are you licensing vCenter? The essentials pack?
vmware,3bjct7,ragingpanda,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:02:17 2015 UTC,"Is this just a proof of concept?   I am actually trying to create something usable, as well as educate myself (summer is my time for experimentation). But if not successful, I can give up and just throw all of those services onto one OS on each machine. Googling tells me that I shouldn't have too many problems with ESXi 6.0 on these models of Mac Mini.   You're probably going to instantly run into memory contention right away   So probably should have fewer guests. Do you think two per machine would be safe? It means doubling up on services, but most of these services are not very demanding.   Having only one spindle disk for the direct connected VM data stores is also going to cause high disk latency when the VMs are actively using the disks.   Well, most of the disk activity is going to be utilizing the RAID array: user directories, network shares, netboot, and deploy studio. Apart from that, I don't anticipate too many problems. Testing will reveal all.   How are you licensing vCenter? The essentials pack?   You know, after I wrote the initial post, I learned that vCenter is not part of the free license.

Overall, what you're suggesting is basically employment suicide.  the 1st day one of your two vm hosts melts down, you're going to be SOL until you get new hardware.  This will eventually happen.  What you SHOULD do: Get two completely identical servers that can handle the full load of all VM servers with ease and room for expansion.  RAID1 for ESXi OS.  Lease for 5 years, with matching same-day hardware support.  get a storage solution that is as redundant as possible, with same-day hardware support.  the storage solution should be able to handle RAID10 as much space as you need, with hotspares and preferably ssd tiering if it's not fully ssd to begin with.

It could also potentially happen if vmauthd is loading a different version of OpenSSL than it is expecting (though I can't imagine how this would happen without you knowing about it).

My biggest advice when deploying view in a scale out system (where you might not be able to add just storage, or just compute)  is make sure you know what your Memory/CPU ratio is for your workload.    Also, its 2016, don't deploy View without seriously Nvidia GRID cards.

SRM may power them down when you clean up the test but as they are no longer located on the test snapshot they will still be at the recovery site (you may need to remove the managedBy SRM config from the VMs afterwards so SRM doesn't think they are placeholders, see KB 2032366). I don't believe SRM allows you to make any modifications to the protection groups or recovery plans while they are under test, so you can't break them out that way.  To answer question 2, yes if you do a forced failover with SRM then it only performs the recovery site operations and does not affect the production site at all. In this case you would be responsible for both sites running the same workloads and ensuring they don't step on each others toes.  * I don't know if this would actually work so it would be worth trying on a few test VMs."
vmware,3bisyx,VirtuallyMikeB,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:12:42 2015 UTC,"To answer question 1, simply remove the VM you want to permanently move to your test lab from its Protection Group. This will relinquish control from SRM. SRM still sees the VM because SRM can see what vSphere Replication is replicating, but it doesn't control it. Then sold failover the VM using vSphere Replication.  And for question 2, there is no production failover (outside of a test recovery) of VMs while you keep the other VMs up and running.  If SRM can communicate with the prod vCenter,  it will initiate a shutdown of the VMs. If SRM cannot communicate with the prod vCenter...now that I think about it, you could shutdown the prod SRM and vCenter servers and initiate a prod failover. That way the test lab vCenter can't initiate a shutdown of the prod VMs because the prod vCenter is down."

That's fine - put mixed workload on the host, as others have pointed out here it is safe to do so.  However, still - go fix your management network.  Get a VLAN or two provisioned for your vmkernel interface(s), call it management network, and stop providing access to your ESXi host through the prod & test networks.  That is an actual security risk.  This won't cost you any additional hardware or rackspace.  And then in your next job, you can put on your resume that you have experience securing vSphere ;)"

To answer your question, no, you can't execute the update from a Windows VM if it is trying to directly upgrade the BIOS. HP usually provides images that you install on Windows and then it asks you whether you want to create an iso / usb installation.

vmware,3b31zb,TnTBass,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:15:52 2015 UTC,"While you make good points, it really depends on the situation.  If you have your entire environment running on NFS storage, a vDS mistake can bring down your environment in a hurry (disconnected storage can really suck).  In a situation like that, you need to take a host off a vDS, get your NFS network restored and get your vCenter back up before you can fix your vDS.  An outage like this can be longer and recovery more difficult than if NFS was on a standard switch.  If its a vDS, you can take down your entire environment with one fat finger mistake.  If you make the same mistake on a vSwitch you basically take down whatever is on that one host.    I don't see many good reasons to use a vDS on a basic environment.  Its relatively easy to deploy identical vSwitches on each host for vMotion/HA/DRS.  On the other hand, if you need to use pvlans, you have to use a vDS."

Having everything on a vDS isn't bad when things go well, or mistakes don't happen.  Having supported many large environments myself and dealing with the exact scenario I mentioned above does give me reason to try to minimize those scenarios.  Its not that the environment becomes unrecoverable, its just the outage duration one has to face if it does happen.

vmware,3b31zb,jshiplett,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:29:30 2015 UTC,"A script to set configuration isn't configuration management. There's no ongoing assurance configuration is consistent across hosts. Not to mention the learning curve for scripting network config is much higher than configuring a vDS. I've run into multiple customers with configuration drift/inconsistency with their vSwitch infrastructure.  At this point in the game, if you have vSphere Enterprise Plus, you'd better have a pretty good reason not to use vDS. Arguing the opposite isn't going to fly 99% of the time - too much benefit to go to waste considering the investment."

vmware,3b2vu4,useratlocalhost,2,Thu Jun 25 15:04:25 2015 UTC,"Unless you are using 10GbE hardware throughout, LACP will NOT give you more ""bandwidth"" in the terms of what a normal bonded/teamed LAG would give you.   My firewall has only two interfaces and I just decided to set them up as an LACP LAGG on the two interfaces and run it as a router-on-a-stick to increase my bandwidth... but that's only because my dual WANs are 75d/75u and 50d/5u which means if I dedicate one NIC on the firewall to WAN and one to LAN, at max download capacity I can only ever use 125Mbps of bandwidth and I can only ever push up 80Mbps. Using one interface dedicated to the WAN and one dedicated to LAN/VLANs would have sidelined about 875Mbps or 87.5% of the available bandwidth from that WAN interface while my LAN and VLANs would have been limited to 1GbE which is just about maxed out fairly often. By running both em0 and em1 on my firewall as an LACP LAGG, I now have a total available bandwidth for my WANs, LANs and VLANs of 2Gbps or 4Gbps in duplex, rather than half of that. I hope that makes sense. Even though my network has almost doubled its effective ""bandwidth"", each WAN, LAN and VLAN is still only running at gigabit speeds, I just have a bigger pipe (2GbE) to run all that through.   I don't know how many NICs you have or how many switch ports you have available but you could try running a quad-card and bonding interfaces 0+1 and 2+3. Then just run those into your vDS as two 2GbE LAGs, or, alternatively, just run everything as a non-LACP LAG. As soon as you introduce LACP you are limiting each connection to the individual speed of your hardware. LACP is NOT LAG. I am in the process of adding a quad-card to a development 5.5u2 box to see if I can accomplish what I mention above, LAG0 = em0+em1 and LAG1 = em2+em3, then just plug them into the vDS and set them as ""route based on physical NIC load"" and see what happens. If it works, each connection made will be at a 2Gbps speed vs. 1Gbps.   Hope that helps and I hope if my logic is flawed someone else will correct it ASAP."

How is your Synology DS1513+ configured? In order to take advantage of LAG each end-device, and everything in-between, will need to be configured the same way. Is your Synology DS1513+ configured as LAG or LACP? Can your switch support throughput of greater than 1Gbps? What is between the Synology DS1513+ and your ESXi host? You need to configure your Synology DS1513+ as a NON-LACP LAG and then you need to configure your switch where the uplinks from the Synology DS1513+ plug in also as a NON-LACP LAG, and then you need to configure your switch ports that connect to the ESXi host as NON-LACP LAG and then you need to get rid of all the LACP settings on your ESXi host and then that's where I am doing this same exact thing myself. I am just about to plug the uplinks back into my ESXi test host so I'm not sure how exactly to configure the vDS uplinks so that it sees the LAG as a 2GbE connection vs. 2x 1GbE connections. I'll update when I figure it out.   FYI, you could upgrade to 10GbE NICs and switches and then run LACP because then each connection would be over a 10GbE link and that would give you more bandwidth but the network will always default to the least common denominator (10/100/1000/10,000) and LACP is not LAG."

This will give you lower latency while utilising your link (but not higher transfer speeds either)."
vmware,3b2vu4,MystikIncarnate,2,Fri Jun 26 10:53:09 2015 UTC,"If anyone else reads this and cares to comment, I am stuck. ESXi 5.5u2, Cisco SG300 switch in L3 mode, Intel Pro 1000 PT dual NIC. I have created a non-LACP LAG at the switch. It is configured as a trunk. I have assigned VLAN1 as untagged+pvid, and VLANs 10xx-10xx are also assigned to the non-LACP LAG... so essentially I am trying to send untagged packets on VLAN1 and tagged packets on 9 VLANs 10xx-10xx to my ESXi 5.5u2 host/vDS over a 2GbE LAG. ESXi host uplinks and vDS port groups are set to ""route based on physical NIC load."" Each vDS port group has been assigned both uplinks vmnic1 and vmnic2 but I have done nothing else.   I have jumbo frames enabled on the SG300 and don't know if that is messing things up  I have a NAS (FreeNas) with an Intel Pro 1000 MT dual-nic in a 2GbE LAG going to the same switch which I am testing against. When I plug in a Server 2012r2 bare metal box also with a 2GbE LAG/Team I can sustain about 1500-1600Mbit/sec throughput on a file transfer job using EMCopy.   At the SG300 switch, when I change the LAG/VLANs back over to trunk mode and plug it into my ESXi host I'm dead in the water. The ESXi host sees that the uplinks are connected but none of my Guest VMs (64-bit CentOS) are able to pull a DHCP address and connect.   What am I screwing up?   EDIT: I will add that as a non-LAG, I can configure and connect two switch ports as uplinks to my ESXi host and trunk every VLAN to each port-group as needed. The only thing that breaks everything is when I try to connect a 2-port LAG into the ESXi host/vDS."
vmware,3b2vu4,vmuser123,2,Thu Jun 25 18:03:16 2015 UTC,"I used to work quite intensely with ESXi in regards to networking using vSS and vDS vSwitches; I make this clarification so you know this isn't coming from a place of ignorance, but rather that of experience.  Working on problems near exactly like yours on various customer environments for ~1year will give you some know-how.  ESXi DOES NOT support LAG.  At all.  Even slightly.  Certain configurations of vSwitch load balancing and Physical switch teaming CAN WORK, but it is not actual LAG.  Certain configurations of dvSwitches can be configured to use LACP via the WEB CLIENT ONLY.  Additionally, unless you're using the absolute newest standard of LACP to perform the link aggregation, you will never have a single-stream of data flow (essentially, communication between two networked nodes) ever EXCEED the bandwidth of one of the aggregated links. - to clarify, if you have 4x1GbE on one end (for example, to a storage device) and the other end is 1x10GbE, then the fastest single-stream data transfer sustainable beween the 10GbE server and the 4x1GbE device will be 1GbE.  I believe the newest form of LACP is made to load balance packets, not connections, so it is able to exceed the limitations for single-stream transfers.  I haven't done all my reading on it so I'm not 100% sure.  Either way, Link Aggregation is less recommended than other options for increasing bandwidth.  Link Aggregation's primary use in most environments is to provide redundancy, which it does quite well.  A secondary benefit is that it can improve one-to-many bandwidth in some situations.  Eg. 4x1GbE LAG on a storage device to 4xservers, each with at least 1GbE: each server can sustain 1Gb, but never exceed 1Gb.  My recommendation is twofold:   you want to keep LAG (for some reason): look for guides on how to configure ESXi for the type of LAG you're using.  I believe for Cisco's particular brand of LAG (typically Etherchannel), you use a different load balancing method; I'm not sure how this differs based on your SG300 (Typical scenarios involved a Catalyst, which is far more robust), but it may be similar.  I believe the load balancing method is ""route based on source mac"" or something similar.... but honestly, I don't 100% remember, look it up if you're making these changes to a production system. abandon LAG: ESXi already will load balance VM's across active uplinks.  If you have multiple active uplinks, then as VM's are powered on, ESXi will randomly assign the VM to use one of the available uplinks, and the VM will ""stick"" there unless there's a problem (link goes down, for example).  In the event of a problem; ESXi will quickly, and seamlessly, with no interaction, 'move' the VM to an active, working, uplink.  The downside with the default 'route by originating virtual port ID' is that, if a single uplink is randomly assigned a few data-heavy servers, it can severely impact performance.  In the case of a vDS, you can probably switch to ""least utilized"" or similar and avoid this problem for the most part.   ESXi doesn't often shift VM's around between interfaces unless required.  In option #2, you would need to DISABLE LAG entirely on the switch-side.  Option #3, which is viable, but not my recommendation, based on your switches: Use LACP.  If the switch has an LACP option and you're using vDS's, you can enable LACP in the vDS uplink group configuration in the web client.  It's possible, but I'm not sure I would recommend this with Cisco SGxxx switches."
vmware,3b2vu4,MystikIncarnate,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:18:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply. So the problem really comes down to money :) If I could only get the budget approved to buy 10GbE hardware I'd just run things properly.   In the meantime, what I was attempting to do was turn 4x1GbE into 2x2GbE uplinks or ideally, 8x1GbE uplinks into 4x2GbE uplinks. Not ideal, it ads a ton of complexity... but it would make a huge difference in the short-term until we bump up to all 10GbE networking. For all I know this could be a fairly normal situation that admins run into but for me this is all new. The VMs use 10GbE NICs because it makes a HUGE difference with VM-to-VM transfers. The problem or downside with that is that the hosts use 1GbE uplinks and almost all of the VMs can easily saturate a 1GbE connection and we have four external NAS/SANs with a total of about 250TB of data.   I have one 24-port 10GbE switch and one 2x10GbE NIC. When I tried to replicate this in a lab environment using the 10GbE hardware I found that with a bit of traffic shaping at the firewall, a 2GbE uplink would almost completely resolve the problem in the current production environment.   I'm not wild about eBay for hardware but even if I got lucky, upgrading to 10GbE is still a $10k project. This was an attempt at a band aid (free) until we upgrade."

When I tried to replicate this in a lab environment using the 10GbE hardware I found that with a bit of traffic shaping at the firewall, a 2GbE uplink would almost completely resolve the problem in the current production environment.   Proposal (and this will depend largely on what you have currently in the environment, if you can get 10GbE into any of the client access switches): if you have a 10GbE uplink on any existing switch, use that to connect the 10GbE switch, use the one 2x10GbE NIC to connect into the new switch.  Connect this NIC to one of the hosts (put it in maintenance mode, etc etc).  After configuring the new network ports, migrate your high demand servers to the system with the new NIC.  Add a DRS rule for those high-demand VMs to prefer that system - 'prefer' is the keyword here; that way if the systems are not available, the VMs will still be, even at diminished capacity.  Of course, if you're only using 1x10GbE connection, you might be able to plug the NIC directly into an existing switch without adding the 10GbE switch (though, adding the full 10GbE switch would help with future migrations).  This is entirely dependent on having a faster-than-1GbE connection into the current production environment (either through switch to switch teaming, a SFP+ or similar port, or some kind of stacking).  Just a thought, and maybe you don't have any of these things available; I don't know, I was just thinking about it and decided I should share my thought-vomit with you."
