Planetside,3e3a6t,Vocith,0,Tue Jul 21 18:18:46 2015 UTC,It has to do with the removal of the beach ball collision that the grenades have before.  Burness said they can revert to the beach ball but then grenades won't always react the way you expect them too because of the environment not being perfectly aligned and the hit box for the grenade not being centered.
Planetside,3e3a6t,dahazeyniinja,2,Tue Jul 21 18:58:40 2015 UTC,"How about instead of reverting the grenades to beach ball size, they make the shields thicker instead. Nobody would care if shields extended inside the spawn rooms about a foot."

Planetside,3e3a6t,gagahhag,-5,Tue Jul 21 17:50:24 2015 UTC,"To be more specific, it has to do with the way the current version of PhysX that PS2 uses handles thin objects (like spawn shields).

The only other way to fix it that the devs have mentioned is to upgrade the version of PhysX, which is not easy to do, and I would imagine has the potential to break anything that has physics."

Planetside,3e2erw,xSPYXEx,4,Tue Jul 21 17:35:19 2015 UTC,"The base turrets right now are really powerful, but have limited range and are weak to pretty much every sort of attack. IMO, they should get a buff to armor or HP or something to make them more survivable, and it would take infiltrators longer to hack them. Right now it's too easy to hack a turret, kill planetmens operating turret (usually a brN00b) and then use the turret til it dies from enemy fire. (Which is usually really fast, now that the archer is out)    Seeing powerful turrets would be awesome and add lots more variety to the game."
Planetside,3e2erw,Dunamisbeam,4,Tue Jul 21 14:54:00 2015 UTC,"The idea is excellent, although I didn't see a method for the actual method it would be applicable.  Possible implimentation suggestions:   Turrets are only temporarily upgraded, and revert back to being a Tier-0/Base model upon either base loss (e.g. another faction takes control of the base), or turret destruction (the turret is destroyed); In order to actually upgrade a turret, it would require a hefty Nanite cost (375) per upgrade; A Tier-0/Base model turret can be upgraded to any other type of turret, but any other type of turret must be reverted to being Tier-0/Base in order for it to be changed to any other type of turret (e.g. you can't turn a Flak turret directly into a Missile turret, you'd need to use the Base model as a stepping stone).   That all being said, while I love the idea, I suspect DBG's support for this game is going to be on the rapid decline: The game is simply losing too many players to remain profitable for much longer. In another year, maybe two, the game will likely enter into ""necessary maintained only"" and we'll get some sort of announcement from DBG saying that they feel like the ""game is complete,"" or some other way to relay that they won't be adding anymore meaningful content, so as to focus on other projects."
Planetside,3e2erw,FM4k,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:26 2015 UTC,"Just for context, Planetside 1 had a tree you would cert into and utilized alternate ammo for your glue gun. Upgrading turrets could only begin while the turret was at 100% health, took ~10 seconds to accomplish, and locked people out of using the turret during the task. I could see a similar time-based, health-dependent system implemented. The 100% health requirement makes it nearly impossible to accomplish while the turret is in the midst of an active firefight; keeping the upgraded turret repaired became a high-priority objective since it was so hard to re-upgrade once destroyed, and so useful during a siege."

Planetside,3e2erw,Jason_Webb,2,Tue Jul 21 15:33:22 2015 UTC,"I think up to 3 modes is good, but the Flak one is not a good idea, there's already Flak turrets on each base and Skyguards, FLAK Maxes kind of take care of that. I think if we over-diversify it inflates the amount of choice and makes too many features redundant.  I'm sure there is a good reason we don't have flame throwers in the game, it feels like a very vague weapon in terms of how it does damage, and it would be frustrating when your'e running with a tiny bit of health left and the ground kills you unexpectedly. Since the game is a military type, I think it's fair to assume that if the Geneva convention prohibits it, it's better not to have it. This is just my opinion though.  Turrets after repair from dead should become basic basilisk style weapons (4 cannons though), then they can be upgraded for anti-armor (1 cannon) or anti-infantry (same as amp style). The AP should have a tiny splash like any other, and the Anti-Infantry should not damage armor, while the default can damage everything equally.  I really love the idea of having a shield turret as well, really neat, but I think it should take a very long time to upgrade, same amount as it takes for a turret to build from scratch- like when a squad is preparing to lose a base and go on the defensive.  Turrets are too easy to kill IMO."
Planetside,3e2erw,justheretoreadtnx,2,Tue Jul 21 15:48:16 2015 UTC,"I really like this, both the idea of automatic defenses and the ability for Engineers to install a second target-specific weapon alongside the general-purpose main weapon. This makes base turrets far more versatile and useful."

Planetside,3e2erw,D0nkey69,2,Tue Jul 21 16:56:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think turrets need any upgrades at all and personally I'd prefer turrets being not overly complicated and just a quick hop-in shoot some stuff hop-out thing.    I only read through the first three pages and skimmed through the rest and i get the feeling that you are taking turrets a little too serious.    I get that turrets are not perfect; I wish we had some AA turrets with exploding grenades in proximity to an aircraft (WW2 style) but all in all IMO turrets are pretty alright and in favor of simplicity I'd just leave them the way they are honestely. Nonetheless I admire your dedication to turrents, don't get me wrong the concept is alright but it does not really seem necessairy."
Planetside,3e2erw,Isrslylikecutegirls,2,Tue Jul 21 17:08:00 2015 UTC,At this point I'd be happy if they just added automated turret upgrades. The biggest issue with wall turrets if they're destroyed before the fight even begins. That said even that is probably a year away.

Either you've snuck up behind me while I'm taking fire and I reverse and run you over. Or, I hook a u-turn and run for cover only to have a well meaning engineer pull out a repair gun and dive under my wheels.  Engineers, especially if you're new to the game or the class, PLEASE understand that you will NOT be able to repair tanks faster than they are receiving damage. All too often, when I start to disengage the enemy a well meaning engineer comes running at with their repair tool drawn. Usually they are right in the path I need to take to get to safety and so I have to dodge them while I'm running for cover and I often run them over by accident.   Your services would be greatly appreciated if you'd just hang back in cover and let me come to you. I LOVE engineers who set up a Repair Sundy and then stand next to it with their tool at the ready. That's the absolute best and I will return to that engineer again and again.

(Yes, ironic, I provide cover for the tank, not the other way around. Somehow the magical shields on those turrets can even block vanguard ap rounds without taking a scratch.) If I am under heavy fire I might temporarily use a vehicle as cover, but I don't need to stay glued to the vehicle to use it as cover. Tanks are big, you can stay 15m away from them and they still block most of the bullets headed for you. Something I do as a vehicle (generally battlebus): If I'm taking damage and people are repairing me, first I move back 1-2m to give them a heads up, stop for a half second to give them time to react, and then start moving back at full speed."

Planetside,3e22z7,-The_Blazer-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:32:52 2015 UTC,Art devs can sometimes be bored at odd times when the rest of the team is hard at work. It wouldn't surprise me if one of them has been working on the next weapon-class remodel in his/her spare time.
Planetside,3e22z7,VSDeggy,4,Tue Jul 21 17:37:43 2015 UTC,"To be honest, i would also love to see revamps of some vehicles also. I don't like for example that all three factions share many of them -- sundy, flash, lightning -- to name a few. Lore wise the factions have some similar background but have evolved in different ways after that, something which is apparent if you look at many of the weapons. The vehicles should have clear differences too in my opinion."
Planetside,3e22z7,hdnine,3,Tue Jul 21 14:21:14 2015 UTC,Nanite Systems provide those vehicles to the three factions.
Planetside,3e22z7,ama_reddit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:40:21 2015 UTC,Though I wouldn't mind an upgrade system that would make the base vehicles upgrade into something more in line with the faction aesthetics.
Planetside,3e22z7,SoberPandaren,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:35:22 2015 UTC,The Empires could still customize them to better suit their ideology (and they already do at least on firmware level as the vehicles have faction-specific HUDs).
Planetside,3e22z7,Besra,2,Tue Jul 21 17:06:03 2015 UTC,That I agree with. The concept for the VS Lib looks quite nice.
Planetside,3e22z7,ama_reddit,2,Tue Jul 21 18:47:02 2015 UTC,There definitely would be a great market for PlayerStudio weapon skins and attachments like scopes (someone please give me a NV scope that doesn't look so ugly) and even buttstocks (I want one for my default carbine!). In a game that is all about guns & shooting there simply can't be enough customization options. But plans for this are longer term afaik. Coming up next is PlayerStudio infantry armor I think.
Planetside,3e22z7,rolfski,4,Tue Jul 21 14:52:04 2015 UTC,I freaking HATE the fact that the shotguns look like any other gun. :/

Planetside,3e22z7,FuzzBuket,5,Tue Jul 21 12:55:40 2015 UTC,"I've seen gmod weapon packs where weapons look and sound as good as and sometimes even better than the stuff in PS2. And if they asked the community, they wouldn't even need to model the weapons.   This may not be very easy, but the art team's job is to make this game look as good as possible and PS2 is an MMO fps where most of the weapons of each faction look almost if not exactly the same. With the relaunch coming up it's a good time to do something about this and I'm sure the community would be willing to help out."
Planetside,3e22z7,Radar_X,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:13:07 2015 UTC,"Absolutely no one here would question the communities willingness to help.  What I know about how we do art could fill at least a two sentence paragraph.  Once the models are done that is just beginning as it needs to be hooked up (rigged), balanced internally, put on PTS, balanced again, depot data input, etc...    Certainly not saying what you are suggesting is impossible but I want to impart this portion of it is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to new weapons."

It's pretty important since most players will have that huge gun model in front of their faces during most of their time playing the game.  On top of that, it has some importance to gameplay as well (one example is: shotguns look almost the same as carbines, so you won't know that you should have stayed further away from an enemy until he/she has already filled your face with buckshot)"
Planetside,3e22z7,PS2-Bishop,5,Tue Jul 21 17:24:00 2015 UTC,"How about just clones of existing weapons for visual variety? Then you don't need to do balancing or such, just the art side of it."
Planetside,3e22z7,MrUnimport,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:57:11 2015 UTC,"The problem with cosmetic weapons is much like cosmetic scopes/cosmetic turrets. Not that they cannot be done. But how would they be implemented.  Right now, I would argue, that our marketplace is already confusing to look at, its almost impossible to tell which weapons are better for what. The last thing we'd want to add is a bunch of clone of the exact same weapons, just with different appearances. Just like we we do with black/gold weapons. This is also why we haven't pulled the trigger on doing black/gold versions of every weapon.  That would just be poor design.  The correct way to do it would be to select the weapon you want to use, then use a drop down or customization slot to change the appearance. But currently, we have no support for that. Its the same way turrets and scopes should be done, if we ever have custom versions of those.  This all takes large amounts of time from code and UI. The marketplace wasn't really created with these concepts in mind, unfortunately. So we work with what we've got and hope that in the future we have the time to update it."
Planetside,3e22z7,-The_Blazer-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that we should add different looking clones of existing weapons, just make the current weapons look more distinct.  That drop down menu for weapon customization sounds pretty neat, though."
Planetside,3e22z7,MasonSTL,2,Tue Jul 21 18:15:57 2015 UTC,"One suggestion I've heard making the rounds is to treat special weapon models as taking up the camo slot. I know you guys probably don't want to do that, because it means you can't sell someone a camo for their cosmetic weapon, but it seems like it'd be pretty intuitive."
Planetside,3e22z7,-The_Blazer-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:12:24 2015 UTC,"This would be amazing. However, weapon models would probably not be quite as simple as things like vehicle cosmetics, because each weapon needs several attachments points (barrel, underbarrel etc), and each attachment possible would need to be tested to make sure it doesn't look retarded by clipping through the model or floating. In addition, each weapon would also need to be tested for animations (idle, reload, etc) to, make sure they interact correctly with the player model. There probably isn't a streamlined pipeline to do this currently.  That said, player studio models would definitely be great and I think they are possible, but the devs would probably need to set up a proper infrastructure first, which would take time and resources."
Planetside,3e22z7,deadstick80,2,Tue Jul 21 12:13:17 2015 UTC,"Well, actually if it works like vehicle cosmetics we would just have to set the model up to have the attachments, mag, and bolt in the same place as another model ingame. Basically we could, say like the Gauss Saw, have all that stuff in the same place but change the model of the gun. wouldn't be as exciting as having totally different animations, but just a quick work around idea."
Planetside,3e22z7,Rhaxus,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:50:42 2015 UTC,I think it would be worth it. The game would look a lot more polished and people would be more likely to buy weapons when they all don't look the same.

Planetside,3e39t8,Layne_Staley33,2,Tue Jul 21 16:58:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know how it works on console, but on PC you can filter the map to show enemy pop. Bright red hexes are what you want.  Roll a medic and start healing/rezzing your way to early cert retirement.  You overload shield gens. Get close and activate it with the default use button.  All fighters cannot hover 100%. The hover upgrade makes it easier but never 100%. You used to be able to flip upside down and thrust ""down"" to hold alt perfectly but I'm not sure if you can still do it"
Planetside,3e39t8,deadstick80,2,Tue Jul 21 17:10:18 2015 UTC,"This is similar to the situation at launch with PC, as at launch there are way more servers than necessary later on. Because of the low population and unbalance, servers will be merged, probably quite soon, so you should have more population on the server and better fights. If you are looking for good fights, look at the map and the number of people in each area. Choosing fights takes time to learn but you will soon be able to judge where the fun is. Also, continents are locked during alerts when a faction wins, and grants them bonuses. These unlock in rotation after every alert (if it isn't a draw)."
Planetside,3e39t8,PaulAtre1des,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:19:04 2015 UTC,"If you team up with others (join a squad/public platoon) you'll have an easier time finding good fights as there's someone else finding them for you. Examining your map more carefully should help as well. Best and fastest way to level up in this game is to join an outfit/clan asap and play the support classes. Be sure to max out your heal or repair gun. You can interact with generators to overheat them, shooting won't work. The same button you use for jumping will make you hover in a jetfighter. You can't really stand still mid-air though and going backwards requires advanced manoeuvring techniques. Nothing stops you from making an additional character on another server. You can always revisit you current one at a later stage. Populations tend to shift over time, but we'll have to wait how that plays out on PS4."
Planetside,3e39t8,rolfski,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:26 2015 UTC,"but it is something like 60% controlled by TR there   seeing as Genudine (the big US server) and Ceres (big EU one) both only have 35-40% TR, you probably are on a dead server with very low populations. nothing you can do but switch to a more populated server or hope for DBG to merge the servers  with ESFs you have to hold the ascend button and pull back on your stick to slow down, at which point you will start to hover. its not perfect and has still some momentum, but its hovering  also on the bigger servers you can reach the same rank in a day"

He's stopped playing now, probably because (as others have said) the leadership part of the game is unrewarding. Particularly after lattice (which I still hate).   In the Woodman glory days he and the other KOTV leaders coordinated often 5 full platoons in alerts. That's what PS2 is about - massive coordination, 5 platoons working under a single leadership to fight as one army across a battlefield. It was epic, and ChickenCurrys was a large part of it.  Every platoon/alert he lead was great fun, well directed and entertaining.  He made loads of people keep on playing. Gave them a great reason to log on and find his platoons."

Planetside,3e1erc,TheLazySamurai4,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:17:24 2015 UTC,The Unity is really good. Betelgeuse isn't an upgrade at all. Only the heat mechanic makes this weapon usable at all. Otherwise it's an orion without the grip which isn't very preferable. Godsaw and Butcher are pretty much on the same level sidegrade wise.
Planetside,3e1erc,hotbox4u,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:50:36 2015 UTC,"Not always true, and depends on your definition of sidegrades. Also it's better for balance if they're sidegrades.  Take a default carbine with laser sight or its ""S"" variant with an UB shotgun and SPA: directive carbine is unquestionably a direct upgrade over them (same for all directive carbines).  Of course since there's this general opinion that the foregrip is the be-all end-all attachment, nobody looks twice at those. With the same logic a slightly inferior grip (directive ARs) makes people consider them downgrades though it has to be mentioned that DBG fucked them up pretty nicely (HVA penalties for the same velocity on Gauss Prime = quasi-useless compensator attachment, useless compensator on Darkstar, and Unity has one less attachment than the others -comp-).  If the Betelgeuse is deemed too powerful despite the lack of of grip, that's mostly because LMGs, particularly CQC LMGs, are balanced around their capacity& clip size, which matters on a very survivable class. But if it had .5 movement, it wouldn't be very different from the current Butcher, which is widely considered as bad.  There's also the case of the directive NC-TR BRs which are very, very, very slight upgrades over the default one with grip+comp+HVA: they get 10m more on range drop-off (95m to 85). VS version was nerfed by DBG because ""reasons"" (no rail attachment despite grip showing on the model)."
Planetside,3e1erc,nehylen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:04:57 2015 UTC,The Darkstar isn't bad.  At least it wouldn't be bad if it were based on a weapon with more firepower.

The directive reward sniper rifles have always felt really, really weird, and having Auraxed my Parsec before the bolt action drop reduction, I can safely say it's only gotten worse over time. It's a shame because I'd really like to carry the glowy purple gun to match my glowy purple armor, but the Parallax is arguably better without as weird recoil- or hell, nowadays I just stick with the Ghost and a 4x scope."

Planetside,3e1erc,trit0Ch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:28:29 2015 UTC,"I'm just afraid that after finally going for some objective completion, for the first time, you're going to be disappointed and frustrated by the Shurikken. Even more, since you'll be an experienced SMG user.   If there's one directive weapon I'm angry about, it's the Shurikken. How can you name a weapon with such an epic, sharp and intimidating name and  fail at making what it deserves to be ?  At first, you see the obvious : 40 bullets. You feel super TR. But then you notice the problem. You've achieved 4 auraxyum medals hipfiring like a dirty bastard and notice that the Shurikken has not an Advanved Laser. This on a weapon that has one of the highest fire rate of the game and is one of the most shaking SMG.   Oh but DBG was thoughtful, they've improved the ADS accuracy. It's worse then a laser-sighted Cyclone or Eridiani. So basically, it's only good in CQB, except that you're being forced to ADS at ranges where you could still hipfire with all your SMGs. And when it comes to ADS as infiltrator, you're being utterly outgunned by a lot of classes and weapons.   So, 50% of the time, when you're not wasting those 10 extra bullets with bad hipfire, you can't use them because you're already dead.   Now, the Shurikken ain't as bad as I sound. You'll still nail to the wall any mofo who's in shotgun range. But, it's just with that name, that freaking awesome name, you'd expect more of a specialized weapon, then some all-rounder.   So painful to auraxyum, specially if you use it after an SMG auraxyum."
Planetside,3e1erc,Jupilaire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:48:14 2015 UTC,I ADS with the Armistice so when I got the Shuriken it was a step up. The problem is not having the fucking silencer.

Planetside,3e1erc,trit0Ch,2,Tue Jul 21 11:23:20 2015 UTC,"Well for ADS, I'm more satisfied  with an SOAS or other weapons when I'm not infil. If you're used to ADS with the TR SMGs, you must be feeling like a god when using other weapons classes."
Planetside,3e1erc,Jupilaire,2,Tue Jul 21 11:41:25 2015 UTC,"Nope. I am special case. The armisitice is really just good at that first 3-4 bullets, aim for the head while ads-ing and its a guaranteed quad ping headshot. I suck at everything else though.

Planetside,3e1erc,JirachiWishmaker,2,Tue Jul 21 12:14:46 2015 UTC,"Lol yeah, hs always work with that fire rate. Shurikken is better for ranged target, though. Bursts are also more manageable. But that low TTK with that damage drop."

Planetside,3e1erc,Bazino,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:59:35 2015 UTC,"IMO, directive SMG's should get a silencer with 0 velocity loss, but one tier off the max damage range (6m to 5m on the Tempest/Shuriken, 10m to 8m on the Skorpios) to make them truly unique.  The directive pistols get a silencer with zero max damage range loss, so it's not without precedent."

I love the shit out of the Shuriken  Sure, it's not as good in CQC as my dedicated CQC Armistice. But it's also the closest thing I have to a Lynx on my Infiltrator, and I really can notice that accuracy improvement. IMO it's an upgrade to ext. mags Armistice.  Word of advice: Separate the NS SMG auraxiums, unlike what I did. They feel kind of similar, but the MKV has this tiny edge to it that made me REALLY hate the NS-7.

Planetside,3e186b,WalrusJones,11,Tue Jul 21 04:21:56 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty silly how tanks in Planetside 2 are far less dangerous than tanks in PS1 which had a much higher TTK.  Lets see   Prowler 1 hit on impact and near splash, had fairly equal firerate to the current Prowler and had 3 man crew, had very large HP pool relative to PS2 in terms of TTK Vanguard 1 hit with a large radius, had very large HP pool relative to TTK compared to PS2 Magrider 1 hit on impact, had very low drop weapon, had interesting mechanic to allow it to evade the dreaded bridge meat grinders (Amphibious) and was sturdier than current Magrider   Not only that but tanks had a reason to exist, most AV was close range with the exception of the Lancer, however you would not get instagibbed (Tanks were far tougher in PS1). You also could not sit out of render range in PS1 and render distance was far lower (300m  around I believe) so OP infantry nests did not exist  Tanks dominated open ground whereas tanks are pretty awful in open ground in PS2 due to render range issues and air power. Infantry had survivability in urban situations due to high power close in AV and EMP Grenades jamming vehicle weapons (Which made sense since Infantry should be stronger in entrenched positions)  All this meant we had inbetween base battles in PS1 (Also because the map design/flow was better, capture mechanics were better and tanks were actually tanky) and base sieges.  Effectively tanks need to be harder to use and as a result more rewarding.  Personally I would rather have MBT's become 3 man vehicles, get significant buffs to survivability in return and infantry AV should get a slight lethality increase but a significant range reduction. Infantry have no reason to be not only holding their ground but destroying vehicle fights in open terrain at 700m range, it's not as bad as it used to be but tanks have also been nerfed to shit in the time inbetween.  The Sunderer APC's should be dealing with infantry upclose and the MBT should be the tanky frontliner to push up to bases."
Planetside,3e186b,ScienceGaveMeAHadron,2,Tue Jul 21 11:03:46 2015 UTC,"PS1 was combined arms done right. Footzerging between bases was suicide, you had to participate in the vehicle combat.

Planetside,3e186b,obuw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:47:34 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, infantry in my memories of PS1 never fought in the fields like they do in PS2. If they did they got absolutely farmed by ground. In Planetside 2 the only thing that stopped infantry demolishing everything was crazy farm fights and airpower.  When we assaulted bases in PS1 we mounted up in APC's (Why else would you put an Armored PERSONNEL carrier in the game if not to transport people) with armor support and move up. Infantry could hold certain strategic locations like hills or forests but combined arms was king until you breached the front door of a base."

Planetside 1 was back in a golden age when K/D didn't exist and therefore didn't matter.  Now the only measure of success (and fun) for most players is getting as many kills as possible while dying as few times as possible.  It's obviously easier to add creative and interesting mechanics into the game (like tanks getting screwed by EMP at close-range, but dominating long-range) when you don't have crowds of whiners complaining about their K/D and cheering on every nerf."
Planetside,3e186b,Sattorin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:37:15 2015 UTC,"I think it helped that K/D wasn't publicized but the issues really come down to game design.  PS2 Caters to a far more casual crowd whereas you were pretty much screwed in PS1 if you weren't inherently very gifted unless you joined an outfit and got organized.  PS1 was back when gaming was actually not filled with 90% morons who can't put 1+1 together, as a result it had a more complex system.  I could rant for hours about how many mistakes the devs made with tossing out cert system/loadouts/BR and CR/Base cap mechanics and spawn mechanics in favour of muh CoD fast action.  I think Buzz summed it up pretty well, by doing this it's no longer a large game. It's just an instanced server and you look at the map and see the 'Biolab Server' so you redeploy there and enjoy your fight, when that ends you redeploy to the 'Tower stomp server'. It's completely meaningless.  I remember in PS1 launching huge campaigns to take a continent (Not possible nowadays due to base design, capture and permanent footholds) Sure it sucked for new confused people but due to the nature of the game outfits were more than willing to train up new guys and combined arms, well organized play had a much higher skill/effectiveness ceiling meaning those organized groups kept playing and got rewarded for it. In the end outfits are what make the game fun even in this neutered more lone wolf style Planetside 2, if the game isn't rewarding for them all you have is a shitty Battlefield with somehow worse netcode and hit detection."

I don't think any of that would help as much as you might hope.  Tanks would still be locked out of meaningfully contributing to most fights on Hossin, Esamir and Amerish.  Field battles would still be rare considering how rare the long uninterrupted sight lines necessary for the Lancer to really be that game breaking thing is outside of Indar.  Infantry would still have massive numbers to grind slowly away at tank populations.  Really you wouldn't be making tanks relevant or field battles more likely with this change - you'd just be giving tankers a slightly safer and more efficient farm wagon.    Tanks are rendered irrelevant because of map design more than anything else as far as I'm concerned.  Trying to force them to relevance through sturdiness and lethality upgrades just makes them obnoxious at best.  They still have little to contribute to most fights because the quite literally have nothing of note to do unless the base lets them shell the spawn or capture point."

So long as max fighting range (but not render range) is reduced somewhat on vehicles guns and infantry AV/flak, then I think force multipliers and their lasting power can be a lot higher.

Even if a guy runs up behind you and plants 1 C4, any non-tunnel vision tank driver will notice it and get away before the second can be planted.  You have ample view if your sides, giving you even more escape time as well as additional peripheral vision of any dumb-fire heavies looking to hit you from the sides.     Granted. The way 3rd person view on tanks are right now, it'll be a pain to see what you're trying to aim at even with the reticule. My criticism is lowered in that regard.  However, if 3rd person view gets modified so your view doesn't get blocked as much by your tank - then I have a problem with it."

This is extremely advantageous in close quarters fighting. I also have my 3rd person camera switch on my primary mouse thumb button because i go into and out of 3rd person so frequently.  I am well versed in how ""awesome"" a 3rd person targeting reticle would be, and that is exactly why I am against it.     3rd person shooting is awesome and everyone should learn it  everyone should practice how to hip fire their tanks accurately or go through the hassle of a ""mostly accurate"" 3rd party overlay and learn it's quirks and limitations. It will provide you with a valuable skill and advantage during 1v1's and close quarters vehicle combat.     However, there is no way to balance this.  Providing an official targeting reticle would be counter productive to the balance of vehicle combat. 3rd person is the virtual equivalent of taking our eyes out of the sites to look around in the real world.  We expect when infantry ""hip"" fire instead of ADS that the CoF and bloom makes up for the increased movement and situational awareness that hip fire provides, at the expense of the accuracy that ADS provides. Indeed we have entire infantry arsenals that are designed around this concept, and it is one of the more important balancing acts when making changes to weapons.   Keeping this in mind, it is not appropriate to add a ""CoF"" to a fixed weapon like a tank turret as a tank needs to be always accurate and always hit where the barrel is pointed; that is the point of a tank in the first place, that it can deploy a long barrel, large caliber weapon into combat where it is unreasonable for infantry to deploy and man effectively. The CoF and bloom on hip fire infantry weapons is only appropriate to mimic the real life varied movements of infantry, not a fixed turret barrel weapon.  Without the balance that bloom and CoF provides the infantry, this would be a straight buff to vehicle combat, and devalue 1st person view significantly. Even considering optics only being available in 1st person view.  Therefore, I submit it is inappropriate to give us an official 3rd person reticle."

If you made tanks less accurate when moving it'd be a huge step backwards, especially considering that the majority of the AV weapons people complain about have no accuracy requirement.  We've got the Lancer, which is point and click, the Ravens and Phoenix, which are guided, and the MANA AV Turret, which is guided. Then there are mines and lock-ons, neither of which actually requires the player to aim and compensate for drop and motion."

Planetside,3dyoug,coldcoffeereddit,3,Mon Jul 20 23:43:30 2015 UTC,"I think u/coldcoffeereddit provided all my opinions save one, which is that vehicle combat typically has a steeper learning curve at the beginning (air especially) and a 3rd person reticle would lower that curve. There's already a lot of people who pull tanks en masse and explode like the 1812 overture from the av brigade that sees them coming. I am not sure how much of a benefit to the game having a 3rd person reticle will have, except for maybe making tanks more easily playable and fun for those who need it to play tanks and libs decently. It would also have the aforementioned effect of making stealth flashes with that grenade launcher gun much much much more prevalent... of which the number of people who enjoy that playstyle are heavily outnumbered by their victims.  I do think that base design has come a long way to stop the zerg tank swarm blockade of spawn points, but there's still plenty of base work itself to provide fun and meaningful tank-play. Imagine Indar with outbuildings that provide some level of cover for both sides. Something to think about."

I don't feel this flows well with the spirit of the tank.  If anything, I would ""nerf"" 3rd person and immobalize the turret while in 3rd person mode, allowing the turret to ""quickly"" spin to where you were looking when you go back into first person.  Such a change would likely see a ruckas raised by other tankers not seen since they changed the flight controls, but I honestly think it is already too easy to target in 3rd person and completely dominate less proficient drivers. Helping the less proficient be better at 3rd person view is going to exacerbate the vehicle dominance issue imho.

Planetside,3dyoug,Armedine,4,Mon Jul 20 21:15:06 2015 UTC,I don't really like that change. Let me explain why.  IMO currently there are two reasons to switch to 1st person view in a vehicle.   1) Precise shooting.  2) Increased immersion.   Going into 1st person view makes you lose a big chunk of situational awareness. This trade-off makes it a fun mechanic and it is necessary for mastering the vehicle.  Removing this mechanic reduces the fun and skill-ceiling in both air and ground vehicles. A (better) 3rd person vehicle reticule would IMO practically remove this mechanic because switching to 1PV would then be strictly inferior.

Unfortunately outside of /u/BBurness telling me he doesn't want to make vehicles I win buttons, which let me go on the record and say Phase 2 absolutely wouldn't do, I've never gotten a good in depth answer on the full reasoning behind leaving out phase 2 while leaving in phase 1.

The problem is that people have differing views on how well things are working based on their skill levels as a user of said nanites. For instance, some folks pull an MBT with radar and a heat turret and a kobalt and rain pain on infantry for hours on end without much fear as they are adept at their jobs and can turn 450 nanites into 450 certs. Then some other folks will pull the same combo and put themselves into a situation where they have heavies darting from behind trees and rocketing them dead in a matter of seconds. I'm not saying that tanks need a big boost, but for some nearly strictly vehicle bound, those things are moving cert printing machines that run on the tears of their victims."

Esamir bonus makes that tank cost only 375 nanites. When you combine this with what would be immense survivability and power, alongside membership resource boost(8 minute wait -> 5 minutes), you'd have people spamming them like crazy, steamrolling everyone. When you finally kill one they could just pull another.

The AV mana turret was also a very imbalanced addition to the game that took over a year to correct, by significantly cutting its range and correcting the rendering issues.

I lean towards PLEASE DON'T do this because it's not really broken in my opinion and without it, it creates a skill for players to learn and enjoy (or hate lol)  P.S.  for all those saying about 3rd person infantry.

Planetside,3dyoug,archont,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:50:36 2015 UTC,Complete Prowler whore here and not in favour of this. Think it gives too much of an advantage to vehicle drivers against anyone sneaking up - should only be able to man a tank effectively in 1st person.

Solution 0: Leave it as it is Problem: Players are feeling a reticule is missing so they're using 3rd party tools, the feature is already effectively ""there"", just for a subset of players and not in a very nice way.   Solution 1: Just add a reticule Problem: 3rd person becomes the new default short/medium view as tanks can now aim without inertia, OR 3rd person becomes useless as it's movement is locked to match turret inertia  Solution 2: Add a secondary reticule that lags behind your inertialess camera reticule and shows where the gun is actually aiming Problem:It's a lot of work"

It helps substantially because you never feel pressured to make the shot as you're aiming, which can mess you up easily.  Besides that, have a low enough sensitivity so that it's not difficult to make fine adjustments.  The rest is practice, and positioning yourself to get at targets who feel safe enough to not move so much."

Like in a year or so when everyone calmed down even more and PS2 was relaunched from DBG. I think it would be interesting to hear a fair assessment from someone who was responsible and why PS2 is so far away from PS1. I mean hell even the company doesn't even belong to sony anymore. And I think the PS2 Community would really like to know.

Planetside,3dz9i3,tinnedwaffles,3,Mon Jul 20 20:27:53 2015 UTC,MMOFPS are just too rare. Too unusual and untested for the business side of things. Investors like to have numbers to go off. PS2 could have flopped day 1 for all they knew.   Launching was just testing the waters in so many different ways. In the end I hope some devs see PS2 and try to one up it. Let it be a stepping stone to something crazier.  Only some dev with a ridiculous reputation or name that carries enough weight (eg Bungie with Destiny) that would carry them through such a financial risk.

Planetside,3dz9i3,PurelyGumbo,0,Tue Jul 21 07:23:03 2015 UTC,"Nah, this is assuming there will be a mix of sunderers of various builds with attackers coming from more directions.  Cloak cannot compete directly with a shield sunderer as a primary spawn point, instead it will serve as a backup spawn or for small units who don't want to charge into the farm.  Railroading spawn placement into predefined structures is lazy level design and kills a lot of tactical options for squad and platoon leaders.  This could be really cool, but without some open space to place the cloak sunderers it's going to turn into more of the same ""enemy sunderer is probably here... again""."

Planetside,3dz9i3,PurelyGumbo,3,Mon Jul 20 22:11:37 2015 UTC,"You're probably just ""trolling"" but just in case, please do start standing still since movement speed doesn't matter. Orion and sva have no compensation for their movement speed multiplier that completely negates the only downside the heavy assault overshield should give. Lower movement speed= easier headshots. A .75 ads weapon with overshield will strafe just as fast as a .5 ads without overshield. It is not as dominant at high level play but since your average planetside player is not a high level player balancing the game for the average player is important."
Planetside,3dz9i3,Davin_,3,Mon Jul 20 22:30:44 2015 UTC,"I'm actually pretty serious.   please do start standing still since movement speed doesn't matter.    I didn't say ADS strafe moving didn't matter- I just said that 0.75ADS isn't all Doomsday OP as /r/Planetside makes it out to be.   A .75 ads weapon with overshield will strafe just as fast as a .5 ads without overshield.   Ok, then think of an Orion HA moving as fast as, say, a trac-5 LA. Any average player who focuses on headshots would be able to aim for the head and land headshots with ease against an Orion HA as well as they do against a trac-5 LA- not counting the extra health from the overshield, of course.  Why would it be so hard to aim at a player who is moving at the typical/average 0.5ADS speed?   To be honest, the weapons you 0.75 haters should be complaining about are the 0.75ADS weapons on non-HA classes (I don't think they're OP, it's just that if you're going to complain about 0.75ADS, complain about the weapons that actually become outstanding from it). The TAR, HV-45, Jaguar, All SMGs and Carnage AR are some examples of weapons that are great 0.75 weapons that no one seems to complain even a wink about. The players who use these weapons are moving at actual 0.75 ADS speed, unlike the Orion HA's fake 0.75 who moves at 0.5. They're are much harder to hit headshots on.  Complaining solely about the ""PrOrion"" is ridiculous- you're complaining about this one gun out of all 0.75ADS guns- and it just happens to actually be used at only 0.5ADS because of the HA's overshield. It's not actually the 0.75ADS you're complaining about, rather it's the HA's overshield."
Planetside,3dz9i3,Isokon,2,Tue Jul 21 00:11:12 2015 UTC,"The reason people pick the orion to complain about over say, the NS15-M (which also has 0.75ADS), is because it's a damn good gun, even without the 0.75. The problem isn't so much 0.75ADS speed, but it's the fact it's tacked onto a 750/143 weapon. Also, people like to complain about heavies, so other classes aren't targeted. You're right though, those other weapons you mentioned are just as good, if not better, than the orion (TAR is bae <3)"
Planetside,3dz9i3,Davin_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:33:01 2015 UTC,"(Orion) is because it's a damn good gun, even without the 0.75.   Without its 0.75ADS, it becomes the worse CQC Oriented LMG in the game. The MSWR, Anchor, CARV and maybe even the GD22S would be better than the Orion. The Orion is not actually that good of a gun without its 0.75ADS Speed.   The problem isn't so much 0.75ADS speed, but it's the fact it's tacked onto a 750/143 weapon.   The TAR, HV-45, Jaguar, All SMGs and Carnage AR are some examples of weapons that are great 0.75 weapons. The 750/143 damage model isn't the problem.

Planetside,3dz9i3,HadesRequiem,2,Tue Jul 21 02:21:43 2015 UTC,Why would it be so hard to aim at a player who is moving at the typical/average 0.5ADS speed?   No one said it is harder but the heavy has a 500hp extra shield. This aim difference comes most importantly to play with heavy assault vs heavy assault. While a MSW-R heavy is nearly completely still during ads the prorion heavies can still do some movement hopefully making you miss one or two crucial headshots thus having the edge on it. It is most noticable on cqc but does indeed lose effectiveness at medium/long range. Nevertheless it makes your average VS heavy more effective than any other faction.
Planetside,3dz9i3,Knopty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:10:38 2015 UTC,"That difference between the movement speeds is completely negligible in terms of an actual 1v1 between heavies. There would be so many factors in play that are much more significant than the diff in movment speeds that ultimately it does not matter.  Sure the movement diff may make a bigger impact in high levels of play where every shot is important- but in average/live server play, everyone misses shots and most people don't even go for headshots. There is often a significant skill difference between two players at any given 1v1 between two heavies that nullifies the Orion's speed advantage- the higher-skill player will always win."

Planetside,3e2hc5,Dark_Jinouga,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:28:35 2015 UTC,"When i was still main-ing VS i wouldn't even touch the Sirius without a foregrip anymore. Which is amusing considering i tend to put LS more often than most on non-SMGs.  Sirius is actually the auto gun with the absolute worst horizontal arc (Hrecoil/HTolerance ratio) in the entire game, with grip it's like a Blitz without grip (NC smgs...), and becomes very workable. So i advise you try that.  The only reason i'd pick the Artemis over it was for noise exclusively. You're right in stating it's a bit more efficient (Sirius drops below second tier at only 21m), but considering the Artemis effective range with the suppressor, it's not that big of deal in my experience."
Planetside,3e2hc5,FuzzBuket,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:11:58 2015 UTC,"very true, the foregrip helps, but i still hate it (wish i had gotten the NS7 tbh, this game isnt very close range from my experience anyways). Wrel's video on sirius vs eridani made the sirius seem great, especially since i was new to PS2 and have been wanting to go smg infiltrator ever since i heard of PS2. turns out im not a bad shot, i hate recoil and dont mind lower RoF. NS7 would have been great, and im probably just gonna buy that with battlecash soon just to have it permanantly  Its effective range isnt the best, but on still stnading targets/moving away from you it has a good 30-40m range from my experience  EDIT: what made you switch to TR?"

Having said that, there are lots of handguns I like - the Cerberus, Rebel, Magshot and even the Emperor are all guns I like to use.

Planetside,3e2etv,sumguy720,3,Tue Jul 21 12:57:41 2015 UTC,I try to avoid telling people about having multiple wraith flashes grouped together because it is one of the most OP things in the game currently and I don't want it to be over nerfed as everything that gets discovered to be OP does.
Planetside,3e2etv,VSWanter,2,Tue Jul 21 15:24:55 2015 UTC,"Hah, yeah it really is a glass cannon if you use in properly. Unfortunately the level of organization required to get an effective flash group going seems to be beyond public play.   I think the flash is really powerful against infantry on open terrain, but I think that's kind of the intended role of the vehicle. If you cross a field in a sunderer, no problem. If you do it on foot you're going to get shot, sniped, run over, etc.   My biggest problem with the wraith flash is invisible roadkilling. I don't think it's remotely fair to allow the flash to do so much physical damage to maxes and infantry. Not that it's easy to hit moving targets, but it's still killing while invisible. Maybe infantry need tank traps - or road blocks or something.  However antivehicle flashing is really really awesome. Even with max level composite armor plating you get instagibbed by main tank guns, so it's a very high risk style of gameplay."

Some guy in /yell was asking something along the lines of whether of not you got a free copy of ""Poke'mans or Battle Toads"" with the new PS2 gamestop cards (I assume in reference to the prank call jokes from 2007, and the only reason I remember this in such detail).

Weekly updates are unsustainable, there is no time for quality code QA, no time to soak on PTS and it plays right into the hands of the programmers who, till time stops, will always want to push forward with the latest shiny rather than fix whats going wrong from the last. Now there is iteration time, time to react to patch issues and stabilise before the next.  The only problem I see now is how we still havnt found the UI guys who, apparently, have been sent to find the missing link in the Amazon basin with orders never to return till they find it."

(I especially like how it handles.) Maybe break features down into different certifications so it's not too overpowered.   (Option 1) Destroys enemy equipment and explosives at range. Limited projectiles. (Option 2) EMP which causes self destruction. A stronger one that can shut down base turrets and the like. (Option 3) Proximity Radar (Option 4) Remote hacking ability with cooldown. Must be fairly close to terminal or turret.   If left uncerted, you could still use it to fly around and manually spot people.  Other balance ideas:   Spitfire turrets should be able to shoot it down. Shuts down after 2 minutes. Can have up to 3 in inventory. Cannot go farther than 125m from controller (player). Not affected by flak and cannot be locked on by rocket launchers.  Goes in tool slot, replacing Motion Spotter or Recon Detect Device."

It's not going to have more killing power than infantry, and not going to have a larger radius of detection, or better detection.   The only things I see happening that would make it feasible, are either being able to let it hover and have its view replace your minimap. This would destroy lower end computers. Or, let it see through walls, or show a ping on the minimap even if they aren't moving, or if they are crouch walking. But those would all be a bit too op. So I don't see it happening at this point."

I would be okay seeing proximity radar, maybe, but I don't think an equipment slot scout radar would be fair.  Liked the other ideas though.  maybe even a target designator, so if you fire the designator (like a hitscan laser) at a target it will show up on other people's huds with a special mark.

Planetside,3e0fyf,sumguy720,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:59:18 2015 UTC,"that's ridiculous. Oh, I got 23 xp for spending 12 seconds pointing this laser at somebody until they died by an allies hands. Yes, this is an efficient way to spend my infiltration time.  No. Give it a static cooldown, give it a timer before the mark that expires, and allow that timer to be increased by keeping the laser on the target longer, but do not make me manually follow an enemy around continuously for an extended period of time, waiting until they die, and god forbid they just turn around and but a bullet or two into the drone and waste your effort.   Also, I'd imagine that infiltrators wouldn't get to cloak while doing this. After all, we can't even stab people, because knives stop being swingable when we cloak, so how the fuck would we be able to actively pilot a drone?  Also, this thing would take up our tool slot? Seriously? No. I want this fucking thing to be in my utility slot, I don't care how many fucking nanites it costs, I am tired and sick of this shit. Unless it's perks can outweigh the loss of motion detection so I can actually have a chance of killing enemies with the ridiculous fucking knife mechanics, It needs to go in the goddamn utility slot."
Planetside,3e0fyf,trickyboy21,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:51:43 2015 UTC,"23xp might be too low. I was imagining a reward that scaled with the target's score.  Also you would laser designate tanks, sunderers and groups of infantry. Having a manual pointer would also let you designate terrain and direct troop movement as a commander.   Yes it would take up the tool slot. The thing gives you a birds eye view of the battlefield. It's not supposed to rake in certs by itself, you have to still be an infiltrator. Personally if I had this I'd be able to dramatically increase my cert gain just from knowing where enemies are."

Unless I'm really missing something here, a Sunderer cloak seems...pointless, not to mention outclassed by the shield.   Nah, you will be able to hide a sundie very well with it in relatively small fights (since stream or freshly spawned people will  the best hint as to where the sundie is). I think if placed well, they will be almost impossible to find. And it's always better to avoid damage than being more sturdy."
Planetside,3dzsq1,CzerwonyKolorNicku,5,Mon Jul 20 21:28:25 2015 UTC,How does that work with IR/NV scopes?  Is the cloak effect exactly like an infils?  Does a infil cloak stack with it?
Planetside,3dzsq1,CzerwonyKolorNicku,4,Mon Jul 20 21:33:29 2015 UTC,"No idea No No, everyone inside is in a deep cloak, you have to either get in the cloak bubble or break the cloak to see them. Ah, yeh, if the sundie cloak is broken and you (infil) cloak yourself, then you are still cloaked."
Planetside,3dzsq1,jackblac00,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:47:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answers!  Few more questions though.  Do EMP nades disrupt the cloak?  The Sunderer doesn't have less ""health"" with a cloak equipped, right?  Do motion spotters/recon darts mark moving enemies in the cloak bubble?  Can you shoot out of the cloak bubble?  Can you turn the cloak on and off when the Sunderer is deployed?"
Planetside,3dzsq1,Jyk7,4,Mon Jul 20 21:55:22 2015 UTC,Atleast about a month ago an emp nade took the shield off for about 15 seconds compared to 2-3 seconds for normal damage. So they are powerful against it

AMS cloaks in PS1 weren't anything special.  Much like PS1, there are only a few viable sunderer locations per base.  You simply need experience to know where they are likely to be at and you can narrow it down very simply by looking at the direction the enemies are running at you from.    Shield is straight up better than cloak in every way."
Planetside,3dzsq1,partack,7,Tue Jul 21 10:34:25 2015 UTC,I think the main advantage is that it'll be harder to spot from the air.So a lone lib can't just parkon it and nuke the spawns.

Planetside,3dzsq1,bobbertmiller,3,Tue Jul 21 16:36:29 2015 UTC,If you could lock it to spawning squad members only it would be a lot easier to hide. Mostly though if you have enough cover to hide infantry from appearing from nowhere when they leave the cloak it would make it a lot easier to deploy in more locations that normally require hiding the entire sunderer.
Planetside,3dzsq1,Jason_Webb,4,Mon Jul 20 22:39:18 2015 UTC,it sounds OP in Hossin

Planetside,3dzsq1,9xInfinity,2,Tue Jul 21 07:32:00 2015 UTC,That's assuming you can find it.  Half the difficulty in small-mid fights is finding the damn sundy to plug the stream of incoming troops.
Planetside,3dzsq1,Atakx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:49:31 2015 UTC,Maybe but it can go both ways. Zerg never bothers using sundy during defense though.
Planetside,3dzsq1,0verloader,3,Mon Jul 20 22:48:00 2015 UTC,"It'll be mainly useful for small fights, and for back-up AMSs in large fights. Cloaked sundies actively being used by a lot of people will not really benefit from it, because it'll be easy to figure out where they are, but it'll help keep secondary (not-much-in-use) sundies safe in big fights. And in small battles, there won't be a stream of bodies to give away its position, so enemies will have a much harder time finding it.  It's going to be a pretty good change, especially because it won't invalidate spawn shield."
Planetside,3dzsq1,Tearloch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:45:18 2015 UTC,And it will help with the bases that have no viable parking spots for a sundy by having some hidden away so you have time to regroup before they all get wiped.

In large engagements, you are not wrong.  However, in small fights where you have half a squad and a handful of blues assaulting a lightly defended base, a well placed cloaked sundie will offer a significant advantage to the attackers.  Think of all the tree'd areas on hossin where you could park a sundie in obvious line of sight of the base, but that would offer those departing the cloak bubble some cover and concealment to hide where they came from a bit.  It's obviously up to the driver/placement as to how aggressive they want get when deploying, but a sundie parked in an un-typical ""safe"" area will be nearly undetectable at the expense of a longer hike for infantry.  One parked closer is going to be a little easier to triangulate."
Planetside,3dzsq1,Vladmur,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:45:31 2015 UTC,Can you shoot out of the cloak bubble though? I kind of hope not.  And Hossin seems like a place where Sundy cloaks are frankly OP. Indar and Esamir generally seem to have the shield be more useful. amerish will vary
Planetside,3dzsq1,Terafir,2,Mon Jul 20 22:55:03 2015 UTC,"my understanding is that the cloak will be very ""fragile"" and easily broken by just ""blowing"" on it.  firing out of the cloak will likely be very frowned upon, and yet another reason coordinated squads will be the only ones to really make use of it.  To be honest, I half expected this change to come with a ""squad locking"" ability for the sunderer to only be available as a spawn to squad/platoon when locked to ""squad only"".  With the tendancy of random blues to ""fuck shit up"", I think cloaking is not going to be nearly as useful as people are  hyping it to be."
Planetside,3dzsq1,Tucos_cousin,2,Mon Jul 20 23:11:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you can shoot out of it but it disrupts the cloak, it's useless. I'd rather have it disable all weapons, including turrets"

EDIT:  There is no delay when entering or exiting the vehicle in PS2.  The only delay that occurs is when you try entering and exiting the vehicle within a short time span.  Or when you try switching seats rapidly.  Whenever you first enter or exit from a vehicle, there is no delay."
Planetside,3dxr46,obuw,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:35:59 2015 UTC,"You do realize that PS1 enter/exit animations took a similar amount of time as the current PS2 ""delays"" you get when you enter or exit a vehicle, right?

Planetside,3dxr46,VSDeggy,2,Mon Jul 20 14:57:59 2015 UTC,"PS2 wouldn't work well with animations for other reasons though. If you've ever payed a game with prefab animations and entering and water vehicles (like GTA5) you can probably remember how much... fun it was to try to get into a Seashark in water.  Every time you touched it, it would move, and the animation would reset."
Planetside,3dxr46,obuw,2,Mon Jul 20 16:22:03 2015 UTC,"Well, first PS2 infantry can't actually apply physics (e.g. push vehicles) so I don't think what you describe would be an issue.  Also, in PS1 as far as I recall the vehicle had to be stationary for you to enter it, and you could only enter each part of the vehicle from a specific location (no magical teleporting between seats while inside either, sorry solo libs). I'd expect that to be the case with PS2 as well if entry/exit animations were to be added.  At any rate, getting enter/exit animations in PS2 is about as likely as getting voice macros, and slightly less likely than getting BFR's."

Planetside,3dxse4,Vindicore,8,Mon Jul 20 12:22:51 2015 UTC,Following the great feedback on the work in progress image here is my completed version which solves the problem of population limits by having an empires last remaining warpgate link protected so that they always have two continents to fight on.  This combined with giving a beaten back empire higher population proportion on their last continents would mean that they would have enough places for all their people even if they have higher numbers than the current servers player base.

Planetside,3dxse4,lilmissclicks,2,Mon Jul 20 20:25:30 2015 UTC,Context on that is that we'd be using the hex/lattice hybrid so they'd more than likely be only 1 large outpost between the facilities (at least 2 of the 3) and the WG.
Planetside,3dxse4,Rhaxus,3,Mon Jul 20 20:35:11 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, makes sense then.  If we go over to Territory 2.0 I would hope that the devs add a lot to outposts to make them effect the region - powerful AA batteries on certain bases is an example Higby mentioned.

Planetside,3dxse4,Trojanbp,15,Mon Jul 20 21:46:09 2015 UTC,"Adjacent territory ownership for securing warp gate control has always seemed like a fairly straightforward solution for warpgate capture. I dislike the inherent potential race conditions though. TR are capturing the SW Esamir VS gate adjacent territories while the NC are capturing the northern Indar VS gate adjacent territories, TR finish first and all the bases under contention by the VS/NC around Indar north flip to TR? Could be pretty jarring, could definitely ""steal"" perceived progress. There are a lot of ways to mitigate these problems, starting with some really good UI/ communication, flexible exclusion rules (bases in process of capture don't auto-flip with warpgate, or some similar variation), or new capture mechanics. That's where the feature starts to get pretty expensive."
Planetside,3dxse4,Gimpylung,6,Mon Jul 20 15:46:17 2015 UTC,"Anytime I see a dev(or an insightful ex-dev) refer to a potential new feature as being expensive all I see is a big 'Nope, never gonna happen'  I.E. There's only money in the budget for tweaks and platform ports.  I'm not resentful or anything, it is the nature of business after all, just makes the gamer in me a bit sad."
Planetside,3dxse4,shockwave414,4,Mon Jul 20 16:37:55 2015 UTC,"Nah, when i say ""more expensive"" features just means that it needs to compete for long time resource budgeting a lot more than a feature like say, sunderer cloak, or a new weapon.  Those kind of long term additions to the game are happening, but rather than having 2-3 going across the team at once they're probably more focused on one at a time, which means they take longer - but they are happening.   As a non-producer ""expensive"" always means ""time"" to me."

Planetside,3dxse4,Scrinrusher,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:32:19 2015 UTC,"I did a bit on this idea a while ago here. I liked the idea of the warpgate being capturable as a base itself. How hard do you recall if you can would it be to enable/disable the warpgate shield, or change it's state/rules?  Alternatively make it so the 3 adjacent bases have to be owned by a single faction? Can it be that the other side needs to be uncontested. More of a king of the hill at that point.  Also you haven't snuck me in a while. :'("

I think the better solution would be control points (example values): 1/3 - no timer, contested (f.e. delay spawning on that continent for that faction unless it has more than 1 Warpgate); 2/3 - 30 minutes timer; 3/3 10 minutes timer. When the timer reaches 0 Warpgate changes hands."
Planetside,3dxse4,troj7c8,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:34:06 2015 UTC,"What if those 3 adjacent bases to each Warpgate would act as control points?   Each one should instead have a ""super shield generator"" that if all 3 are taken down the WG shields come down."
Planetside,3dxse4,Malorn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:57:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that would require WG rework"
Planetside,3dxse4,xWarMachineTE,0,Mon Jul 20 16:06:33 2015 UTC,Not really.  The Kolytr WG design combined with various control point placements around/in the WG itself would do.  Also WG's are technically giant vehicle shields. So Infantry & GSD vehicles would be able to get through.
Planetside,3dxse4,Malorn,7,Mon Jul 20 16:41:10 2015 UTC,"I think we've been discussing this since 2011 PSU, Vind!  It's not a coincidence that all the continents have 3 links from each warpgate. When revamping the continents for lattice that was one of the principles discussed with the level design lead. We were redoing the continent so fixing up warpgate connectivity to be consistent was an easy thing to do. The thinking was that someday we may want more warpgate gameplay and make sure level design wasn't a bottleneck for that by making them all consistent.   I've always been a fan of the idea of capturing a gate by taking the territory around it. It makes sense. Though I like a two-state system where if you own one side the gate is neutral like a PS1 gate (both sides can use it for transit and lattice is granted to allow attacking the 3 adjacent territories). If you own both sides then the gate becomes a foothold and operates exactly as it does today.  That's how I think it could work well were it decided to be done.  The real issue is not how it could work, but rather whether it is a good thing for the game. It definitely adds to persistence, but it also destabilizes population balance and play space. Locks would only logically happen when an empire controls all gates. With 4 continents that can only ever happen for one continent, so more play space, which is bad for off peak (density is a whole fun topic by itself). The other challenge is population matching. The bad side of x-cont in PS1 was the double teaming and being locked out of a good fight on a continent to which your empire does not have access. Of course double teaming happens now, but it was far worse in PS1, with commanders actively trying to do it constantly because that's the only way to avoid it on you. Then there's the fun aspect of continents being pushed where empires give up and go to another cont because they don't have the pop to defend two. That leads to ghost capping by attackers which also isn't fun.  Then there's the only-have-access-to-one-cont problem where an entire empire needs to be crammed into one continent because that's all they have access to. Then there's the special casing to prevent an empire from having no spawns anywhere.   There are a lot of problems with x-cont warfare, and it has significant risk to result in much less fun gameplay than is enjoyed now. As much as I love the depth of gameplay it might bring I wouldn't do it, even if resources weren't an issue. It's too much risk and too much destabilization.  That's not to say warpgate capture couldn't have meaning though; I just don't think x-cont is the right meaning for PS2."
Planetside,3dxse4,BigBlueWookiee,3,Mon Jul 20 17:00:37 2015 UTC,"Good to see you Malorn and great points as always.  Your concerns are obviously valid and population density really is the core problem with this system.  However compared to PS1 we have fewer continents so we have less risk of low density being the problem as there are far fewer continents to ghostcap (and no horrendous 15 minute base timers either).  We also have the reinforcements needed system to allow players to get to fights instantly which PS1 did not have.  On the flip side is the problem of everyone wanting to get onto one continent and no others being available due to other empires controlling all of them but with the system and links shown that will never be the case - there will always be at least two fronts between an empire and another faction.  Of course that does mean that if you have a servers population above two continents worth then you could be in trouble.  Perhaps in that rare case you give that empire a temporary pass to the other continents to go hack any base and then spawn there, with drop pods landing them on the target (say any random base).  Special casing I know but it is a way around it and could be interesting."

Planetside,3dxse4,D0nkey69,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:58:50 2015 UTC,"I think the real ""need"" for this intercontinental lattice to work is more conts... It's nearly impossible to balance and be feasible with 4 conts.   Malorn, I never understood why cloning the conts wasn't a option. Clone all four we currently have, change the skybox so they look different and you can add some strategy to the game with intercontinental warfare. Seems easy enough to me, but im no developer."
Planetside,3dxse4,lilmissclicks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:03:26 2015 UTC,It's less about the 'how' and more about the 'why.'
Planetside,3dxse4,D0nkey69,3,Tue Jul 21 01:22:42 2015 UTC,"At first glance, this looked quite good. But, after further review, I am left with the fact that in order to accomplish this - the effort required could be wasted and this a flop. Hear me out.   We all have heard of the proposed changes from the Lattice to either the old Hex or a Hybrid Hex/Lattice system. Those changes, along with the supposed promised resource revamp would have a significant and important change to how the game is played - the Meta. I don't think anyone disagrees with that statement.Also, I believe that most people want those changes implement more than the intercontinental lattice.   Why it is important to mention this is a two fold reason: First, the effort required for either update is significant. Second, the resource/lattice revamp that has been proposed will change the meta - which might change how the lattice should work/function. In that end, I think it's a bit premature to look at changes to that, when there are proposed (Smed's September promise... yeah yeah, I know, I know) changes in the works, we need to take a good hard look at those before implementing/working on something that in essence is directly related to that."
Planetside,3dxse4,lilmissclicks,2,Mon Jul 20 14:07:20 2015 UTC,"They should go hand in hand, but the resource and hex/lattice changes are more important. I'd love for them to keep the intercontinental lattice in mind during the planning and implementation of them so that they don't run into issues later. Measure twice, cut once."
Planetside,3dxse4,D0nkey69,2,Mon Jul 20 15:46:42 2015 UTC,Oh I totally agree with both of you that the resource system and perhaps Territory 2.0 (if it is done right) would be much more important.    I've already done some concepts for those though ;)

How has it helped the Stalkers on the PTS? I haven't heard any of them talking about how the new system has advantaged them.  I am all for improving the ability of the cloak, but I want to see a real solution to the current problem. Darklights already counter all forms of visibility flawlessly, and experienced players loudly tout that they don't even need a darklight to see us. Has anything been done to solve this?  I am very curious to read feedback from players who have used the new cloaking mechanics on the PTS, and what it did for their play. As it stands, I am (justifiably, I believe) not confident that multiple visibility tiers are the solution to the problem, if our most stealthed tier is still visible to experienced players.  EDIT: To add to this, multiple players have noted that the human eye is attracted to movement more than anything else, and believe that movement in the current deep cloak tier would be easily visible. Is the crouch-walking visibility tier actually viable for sneaking around, or do we still stand out to any player with eyes? Do you feel that the multi-tiered cloak has helped close the gap between Stalkers and other classes, or is that still To Be Seen?"
Planetside,3dyrsj,Nikye_VS,0,Mon Jul 20 21:51:54 2015 UTC,You gotta cloak against a blank surface. Straight lines in the background + player that's looking = you're dead.
Planetside,3dyrsj,Zeiban,7,Mon Jul 20 23:12:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about just standing against patterned backgrounds (despite the rarity of non-patterned backgrounds in most bases). I'm talking about sitting in open fields, or crouching randomly on a mountain's edge (not in a corner). I have tested many hiding spots by having a second account follow me around, and looking at the cloak through the other computer. There are places where no player should be able to see the cloak, and yet they do (often the same player over and over, while all other players walk past oblivious), and when asked, they always respond that the cloak is easy to see for any experienced player.  It's a consistent pattern, which is why I bring it up. I definitely understand that there's some things which are dead giveaways if you stand in front of them, like patterned backgrounds or anything glowing. Similarly, standing in a Contested point and hiding in a corner is a great way to have a bad time. That being said, a few hundred hours worth of Stalker experience plus about a dozen hours of testing between two accounts, and I have a generally good idea of what places serve as decent deepcloak spots. That hasn't stopped certain players from snap-targeting to my location as if they have ESP. That, is what I want to see addressed."

Very easy to spot and pretty much expected movement. I'd suggest trying to think like a light assault - get away fast and go in an unexpected direction.

It really should only reset once combat starts again after 10-15 minutes of no activity or players in the base region and always track during activity.  They you have stuff like: wow this battle has been going on for 2 hours now and ___ got x kills so far.  Not:  man, the scoreboard reset 37 times so far during this battle and now it's not even tracking anything because we lost control of the point.

First it was CoF, now it's damage dropoff.  Tanks are not infantry weapons. They're designed around being pinpoint-accurate, highly skill-based high-damage weapons. Why would you punish players for landing shots at extreme range? That's extremely hard to do!  And why does everyone keep trying to make HEAT useful by giving it some other niche? Give it back its infantry-killing power. That's how you make HEAT useful. You undo the nerf that was done in the name of ""excessive lethality"" and you let it kill something it lands within 1 meter of. Then, because 1 meter is the current lethal splash range of HE, you raise HE's lethal splash to 1.5 meters.  Stop trying to redesign the entire game around tanks with no teeth. Just give the tanks their damn teeth back."

Sadly, that does not apply right now to PS2 and, therefore, HEAT does not have a role.  Your suggestion makes sense  though, I approve of it."

Planetside,3e20my,TrumXReddit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:30:13 2015 UTC,"That's not what HEAT is for in real life.  In real life, canister rounds are anti-infantry weapons. They're massive shotgun shells.  HE rounds are designed to kill the crew of a tank that has armor too heavy to penetrate. It works by propagating a blast wave through the vehicle, damaging fragile components (like human brains) without having to penetrate the exterior.  HEAT rounds are designed to melt through armor. They detonate in a stream of molten copper, which then jets through the target.  AP rounds are pure penetration. They go in, they come out. They don't generally explode. However, modern AP rounds are moving so fast they're basically liquid metal when they hit."
Planetside,3e20my,TinfoilHatMan420,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:59 2015 UTC,"No. Ap should be the best long range shell. And should be the best against armor. Its called ARMOR PENETRATION. If you want to nerf it long range, you have to make it hilariously OP close range. Thats never a good idea.   And if you make heat a anit tank shrll, you gotta nerf it against infantry.   Btw, never do dmg dropoff in tank shells, because that's a direct nerf to the prowler and buff to vanguard."
Planetside,3e20my,TrumXReddit,3,Tue Jul 21 10:42:29 2015 UTC,"Btw, never do dmg dropoff in tank shells, because that's a direct nerf to the prowler and buff to vanguard.   Exactly what I think. Actually, it's just common sense."

Planetside,3e20my,TrumXReddit,4,Tue Jul 21 11:19:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly. But AP shells would have damage dropoff, thats retarded.   And you clearly arent an experienced tanker, you cant seem to understand all the consequences your changes would have. That's no insult, but you gotta think out of the picture here.   Buffing ap to be stronger close combat, is a buff to the vanguard, because the vanguard is mainly close combat focused.   And its a nerf to the prowler, because the prowler is mainly long range combat focused. Imagine all prowler drivers beeing forced to use heat, because long range is their primary role (lockdown). And now imagine the already very strong vanguard using the close range buffed AP, that already do more damage than heat.   Boom, you actually rekt the very very shaky tank balancing in the game.   Ans thats just for making heat more viable...   No. Keep heat as it is, as all round noob weapon. People who arent good enough to reliably do direct hits on infantry but dont want to be totally fucked in tank combat."
Planetside,3e20my,obuw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:49:34 2015 UTC,"very very shaky tank balancing    You mean nonexistant?    Imagine all prowler drivers beeing forced to use heat    Then you buff prowler heat. Problem solved by changing a single number.  But you are not even seeing the big picture. If anything, this change would be a significant buff to prowlers, as you wouldn't have to worry about ap vanguards wrecking you at long range anymore, and you are already completely screwed vs them at short range as it is.  (PS. I absolutely wouldn't advocate actually buffing AP guns at short range. Actually I wouldn't advocate any AP buffs of any kind. I'd assume under the proposed suggestion they'd do the same damage up to, say, 80m, and then damage drops linearly, becoming as low as the current HE values at, say, 200m)"
Planetside,3e20my,TrumXReddit,-1,Tue Jul 21 12:58:50 2015 UTC,You were rekt by vanguards long range? Then you're doing something wrong in a prowler (no cover etc)   What you guys all want to change just to make heat more viable o.O
Planetside,3e20my,TrumXReddit,2,Tue Jul 21 13:14:02 2015 UTC,"Eh, I never actually used a lockdown prowler. Just going by what numbers and people tell me. Afaik a vanguard is at equal odds against a lockdown prowler at long range. Which is a bit ridiculous as that's supposedly the prowler's strong suit.  So yeah, even when you're facing them at long range, you need to be careful, if they slam you with their alpha damage before you spot them, you are likely to be at a disadvantage by the time you react."

Planetside,3e19n4,OperatorScorch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:25:06 2015 UTC,The experience thing doesn't really sound relevant since new players joining the PC version still face that disparity.   PS4 can use mouse and KB if they feel like it.   Not every PC player is using a good PC so hardware isn't relevant either. Lots of people playing with lowest settings possible just to get 60 fps.   The only real reason I can agree with is that the PS4 version isn't as stable as the PC version yet.
Planetside,3e19n4,verrukt,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:46:07 2015 UTC,"Your point on experience is true. A console kit for mouse and keyboard still won't function as well nor be as accurate. You can bet the relevant PC players are running hardware to get 60+fps. I don't really mean the people running 30-60fps, I mean the difference between any ps4 player is still going to get stomped most of the time by someone running a logtech g502, mechanical keyboard and a 144hz monitor and 120+fps in game."

Plus, longer TTKs just make the players who can aim good (read: people with expensive mice, rigs, and monitors) even stronger. The 2.0 headshot multiplier combined with the current TTK makes for an entertaining shooter as is. I think it's in a happy place at the moment."

Damage per mag would become more important, LMGs much more powerful for that reason, would give  more time to activate ""healing"" abilities: medkits/aoe heal/overshield, so having like 20% theoretical TTK would result in effectively higher than +20% TTK.

Planetside,3e17im,TheRandomnatrix,4,Tue Jul 21 18:24:20 2015 UTC,"It's already pretty long for a FPS (as you mention in the OP).  I think we're in a great place from a fundamental shooting standpoint.  In fact, I think the shooting mechanics are my favorite part of this game - weapons handle great, feel powerful, yet they still require good aim and tracking to kill targets.  The TTK is long enough to give your target a chance to skill their way past you if you get the jump on them.    In a game this massive longer TTK's would lead to too many bodies shooting at each other without killing.  And all that for no real gain.    TLDR - gunplay in this game is great, no need to change TTK."
Planetside,3e17im,ChillyPhilly27,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:40:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. I agree with you about the gun handling in this game, but some weapons would probably feel better if they sounded stronger."
Planetside,3e17im,TheRandomnatrix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:52:22 2015 UTC,"I love longer ttks. If you want twitch shooters go play CoD or CS:GO. I like medium-long range gunplay because it more often than not comes down to who can aim better and position better, not who can react faster and hipfire ADAD the most. It also feels like you're fighting people instead of ""round a corner kill or be killed by netcode"".  But that's like, just my opinion man."
Planetside,3e17im,ChillyPhilly27,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:37:51 2015 UTC,"What are your thoughts on CS? TTK is close to zero if you can aim properly, but if you can't they can be 10 seconds or more"
Planetside,3e17im,DJCzerny,2,Tue Jul 21 10:20:22 2015 UTC,"Personally I hate the gunplay, and my attempts to get into it have been met with failure. I know it has a pretty high skill curve and you can be incredibly accurate with enough practice, but I just can't stand a game where you need to burst to hit a target 10 meters away. In planetside bursting is done to maximize accuracy. In CS you can't hit the broad side of a barn with most of the guns unless you burst. It doesn't help that planetside is all about moving, whereas CS is stop, burst, move, stop etc. Other than that I can't provide an in depth critique on it."

If the TTK was increased, there would need to be a strong rebalance to much of the game.  That being said, if A2G TTK was lowered, I don't think it would hurt much. Whole groups of players can rarely react quickly enough to counter A2G rocket spam. There's no other weapon in the game that can score so many kills with such little effort."

A longer TTK would make this even more possible and I'm not sure I'd like for my enemies to get away that easily. This would also make longer range combat impossible - people would just duck away.

With SPA you're hitting max damage all to way to 15m and anything beyond 25m is outside of SMG territory anyway. You're basically getting the same DPS at range and much more up-front.  The downside is the 25 bullet mag and how fast you empty it, but if you're emptying 25 bullets into someone and not getting a kill, you have bigger problems to deal with.  Statistically the NS-7 isn't the greatest gun and the better falloff damage really doesn't compare to what you can do with a scout rifle or CQC sniper if you're pushing its range - honestly the best thing the NS-7 has going for it is the reload animation."

I have no problem with the Medkits on other classes. The likelihood of them surviving long enough to use one is far less than a HA.  As for the Assault rifle (medic), its one of the better guns no doubt and it could be argued that it needs balancing, but I dont think its necessary at this point. If medic's were significantly out preforming other classes I'd be more concerned."
Planetside,3dxcxv,Divenity,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:21:26 2015 UTC,"Every non-HA class has advantages other than the overshield that makes it easier to medkit tank (engi being the exception).  Some assault rifles are good enough that you can go against heavies no problem. Even carbines like the Jaguar, GD-7F, VX6-7 and the Serpent are all proficient at killing heavies. And then there's the Cyclone. Go for headshots with these guns against HAs and you will be able to win provided you aren't bad at aiming.  Heavies' LMGs get outclassed by other weapons- so the overshield is a buffer against the LMGs' downside."
Planetside,3dxcxv,gnome08,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:00:34 2015 UTC,"advantages other than the overshield that makes it easier to medkit tank   They may be able to hide better while poping a medkit, But they still have to survive the initial trade of bullets. The Infiltrator is at a disadvantage having 100 less health in that sense. Everyone else is on equal footing except a HA with his shield up.   So if the the overshield is a buffer for the LMG downside, is it a buffer for the Shotty too? what about rocket primary?"
Planetside,3dxcxv,SpiroAgnewTR,26,Tue Jul 21 16:56:15 2015 UTC,"i like all those ""just aim for the head and you will win"" comments. non-heavy classes have no heads?"
Planetside,3dxcxv,Divenity,14,Mon Jul 20 10:16:35 2015 UTC,"No, the point is if you aim for the head they won't have time to react, pop their shield, and turn and kill you, since headshot TTK is faster than most people's reaction time, and even if they do react, they still have almost no hp left by the time their shield is up... which means they have less total health than you do when they turn."
Planetside,3dxcxv,gnome08,6,Mon Jul 20 10:29:17 2015 UTC,"This exact argument can be applied to any class. No class has time to react when they are surprised with headshots and has to 180. It's not as though every class gets the jump on the heavy for all of planetsides past and future events either.

I mistakenly lumped your ""needs more headshots from behind"" comment in with the the other comments that assume all is equal and fair  if both a HA and a non-HA get headshots against each other, which it's not by design, for better or worse.  On the topic, I still don't think that the ability to receive head shots from behind in anyway justifies anykind of balance. Any class can get headshots against any class from behind or otherwise, this is not unique to the heavy assault, which is what I believe the commenter was saying."

Light Assaults and Infiltrators reasonably should get the drop as their class ability specifically allows for easy flanks.  Medics, meanwhile, are extremely well armed for a 1v1 but are neither particularly durable nor well suited to flank.  Their necromancy powers are easily fair justification for this.  Engineers should just hide behind the max they're babysitting or hide in a corner and cry while getting their meager XP dole from the ammo they're handing out."

That's what I did, had a HS/K ratio of about 14% 4 months ago, now it's well over 30.  Also I do play heavy, it's the only class with viable counters to maxes that don't require you to be in it's face with C4 or sacrifice your primary weapon - Until that changes, I play heavy almost exclusively, because maxes are the devil...  That being said, I do have my medic and assault rifle directives done on 2 factions, I know full well what playing from the other side is like, and even when I was putting around with a 15% HS/K ratio (most of that was probly from sniper rifle kills), I had no trouble killing the average heavy when I caught them off guard."

Jetpack, cloak, and sprint are all loud enough to let someone know you're coming from a ways off, and the first reaction of a heavy caught by surprise isn't going to be to 180 and return fire standing in the open. Most will just sprint behind cover, medkit, and regen.   You're now caught in the situation of being on even-footing with a class designed to be stronger than it than anyone, and unless you gung-ho and hope to charge them before their shield regens you've done nothing except to let them know where you are."

Planetside,3dxcxv,pulley999,2,Mon Jul 20 20:11:52 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really ""protect"" against headshots so much as it just absorbs damage.  A headshot against an overshield does double damage but the heavy shield still absorbs it fine.  TTK is still cut in half, shield or no.  TTK of a rapid headshot is incredibly brief, though, and even a very good player is unlikely to so much as turn on the shield if you ambush them with headshots at close range."
Planetside,3dxcxv,SpiroAgnewTR,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:28:33 2015 UTC,"It does, Nanoweave doesn't. Nanoweave either needs to or it needs to be removed from overshield. Preferably the latter."
Planetside,3dxcxv,Divenity,3,Mon Jul 20 16:08:20 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay. Nanoweave needs to be removed from overshield? I was under the impression that Nanoweave/Flak definitely didn't stack with at least one type of the shield.  I want to say that NMG doesn't stack with Nanoweave/Flak, so people often go with Advanced Shield Capacitor, but Resist Shield did, so they often combine those together? Except that the only reference I found on some Wiki said neither shield stacked with either type of armor.  Any idea what the actual current state of these rules says?"
Planetside,3dxcxv,EclecticDreck,5,Mon Jul 20 16:46:31 2015 UTC,"I think what you said is correct in terms of stacking, my point was overshield protects against headshots. Nanoweave doesn't. Either Nanoweave gets it back (which was awful to begin with) or Overshield gets it removed.   Because at the moment the ""argument"" is other classes should dump headshots and they will win. Which isn't true if you consider two equal skill players dumping headshots the heavy will always win because the other class has no way to protect against HS. As for rear ambush headshots, the way the flinch animation works you're missing shots # 2, 3 and probably 4 because the character model flinches forward quite heavily. More than enough time to react.  Heavy mains out there, if you want overshield to protect your head, it should also obscure your vision.  By not protecting the head, it nerfs it against small arms & git gud while maintaining the likely intended role of better survivability against armor who don't aim for the head on purpose at all."
Planetside,3dxcxv,tommo_95,2,Mon Jul 20 17:02:26 2015 UTC,"Nanoweave doesn't stack with NMG, but it doesn't have to. Nanoweave protects you before and after the 700 NMG hitpoints have been spent, so you still get a bonus 200 HP running nano. With resist shield, you're better off running ASC because Nano will do nothing for you there."
Planetside,3dxcxv,FischiPiSti,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:12:17 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it does, flak does as well, they only don't stack with resist.  a player with nano and NMG/ADR has an EHP of 2071 without headshots, without nano it's only 1657(because of the activation cost).. if it only applied to health after the overshield went down it would only be 1907."
Planetside,3dxcxv,Helghost,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:30:35 2015 UTC,"Heavies have, at most, a 950 EHP advantage over an infiltrator.  That's a lot.  Lucky for everyone who isn't a heavy, there are things working in your favor.  Supposing you used your cloak and your sensors to get behind the heavy then your first ally in your proud struggle is simple first shot advantage.  That isn't much but it is bolstered by clientside.  That heavy doesn't know he's been shot - not until your packet hits the server and the server passes along the heads up to the heavy.  Clientside easily gets you 200 ms.  That still isn't a lot of time until you remember people have a reaction time.  If we're generous and assume or theoretical Heavy has near superhuman reactions that tacks on another tenth of a second.    So what can you do with three tenths of a second?  Why fire an NS-7 four times and deliver between 500 and 1,000 damage of course!  If you are lucky enough to be an NC infiltrator, that's enough time to put 3 cyclone rounds into the heavy - enough to kill if they're all headshots at max damage range!  And it must be said that we're being remarkably generous to the heavy by only giving them a .3 second disadvantage since we assume he manages to instantly turn, acquire the target, ADS and then chain headshot his way to victory all while turning on his i-win shield!"

Planetside,3dxcxv,ZhiaoChi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:37:57 2015 UTC,Typically i dont bother with nanoweave. I prefer the emp bando.  Good has are still going to crush you since headshots arent effected.  Ns 7 is a good weapon. It suffers from mediocre damage output without headshots though. I know headshots are a pita as a cloaker because of the wonky hit boxes from the side and back. Still life gets better if you focus on that.  Still the top has will do well if they get their shields up. They can pop the shield mid kit tank your magazine then go for a pistol kill. Thus is life as a cloaker.   I assume you are abusing the crap out of dildar as well. Its amazing. Gives 100% position and direction. Reveals maxes.
Planetside,3dxcxv,ZhiaoChi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:03:53 2015 UTC,"against a heavy with a shield can still win, just aim for the head   That only works if the HA has worse aim than you. If he/she has equal or better aim, then you're dead."

See, I find a heavy that's not looking at me, start firing, big damage markers coming up constantly and then one of two things happen. They turn and instantly down me with headshots or they spazz out, jam in a medkit and live to kill me a few seconds later.  I absolutely hate seeing a ton of damage markers only to see someone spazz in circles away from it.  And god damn infantry move fast in this game. You'd think the speed of a soldier would reflect what that soldier is, class wise. Rocket launchers and LMGs shouldn't weigh down HA more than a light assaults kit, eh?  The balance of power if way off in this game but ... I guess if land and air vehicles are also unbalanced, infantry need two unbalanced classes to even things out, even if other infantry who support have to suffer losing just about every fire fight.  But hey, there's other terribly unbalanced things in this game."
Planetside,3dxcxv,Ridiculisk1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:48:43 2015 UTC,"is this what you experience most often when you fight heavies?  Because I can tell you that when i play engi/la heavies are very easy to deal with except the top tier players.  With a jaguar engi you have literally a betelgeuse without the shield.  This means you can .75 strafe at medium range and even just hipfire with full speed in cqc. There is a reason for 2x headshot multipliers in this game, it rewards skill.  While I do agree that heavies should probably have their regular movement speed reduced, it probably won't affect top tier players who can turn around and dumpster you. Watch Vonic's or Fleischwolf's streams, they don't heavy primary, yet they still do exceptionally well.  I actually enjoy watching them play much more than your typical MLGheadshots4dayz heavy. I have spent the majority of my playtime on HA, but now that im starting to pretty much main engi, I can tell you that although the shield does help a lot in 1v1 versus a non-shielded class, being able to get good positioning and headshots makes the shield quite negligible. If you think non-heavy classes are meant to fight on par with heavies in honorabru 1v1, then you are sorely mistaken.  The heavy gets a shield which can save them from burst damage.  However, every other class has better weapons and tools.  The LA's advantage comes in the form of superior flanking mechanics, the infiltrator has his EMP nades and ESP motion spotter/darts, and the engi has unlimited ammo, stickies, and a turret that can also be used for cover. Hopefully I highlighted some reasonable ideas Helghost, but if you want to discuss it further, hmu ingame and/or just chat about it with sam or kiddy, they understand what I'm talking about(hopefully) and can help you improve in any area of infantry you are in need of  polishing."
Planetside,3dxcxv,SpiroAgnewTR,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:19:29 2015 UTC,"also need to mention that I typically do not run nanoweave on engi, medic, or la because I'm an impatient bastard and can't wait for shields for an entire 10 seconds. And I can still dumpster 90% or so of the heavies I come across :/"

Planetside,3dxcxv,SpiroAgnewTR,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:16:37 2015 UTC,"I'm at least 90% sure my aim is good enough. But then again I am TR so... maybe not.  I see hit markets, lots of them, and they spray me down immediately UNLESS I'm a heavy.   When I'm heavy, I'm the one who is spraying down others. I'm the one who uses positioning as well as my shield to facetank damage and wipe out three people unfortunate enough to be seen by me.   And when I'm not heavy... I'm one of those three people getting wiped out.   Let me be real here. I just got the Butcher LMG recently, and now that that is done, I'm playing classes I actually like to play and this game is just abysmal when I do. Just... nothing but glowing enemies with more health and me... with the normal amount of health/protection.   Honestly I don't even like the butcher either. It's hard to even try to burst with to hit enemies not within 10m of you. Though occasionally I play LA and flank them and win, but if they see me, it's always over."
Planetside,3dxcxv,TheRandomnatrix,3,Mon Jul 20 21:10:28 2015 UTC,As an CQC INF the only time I engage a HA is if I can kill them instantly with a bolt and a knife to the back. Once they pop the shield it's an instant 1 vs 1 win for them. Basically any HA with a little experience will always kill a non-HA 1 vs 1. Doesn't matter if you ambush them. Once the shield is popped you have lost. There is no counter. Yes EMP grenades work but they are not practical unless I can carry a box of them with me.
Planetside,3dxcxv,SpiroAgnewTR,8,Mon Jul 20 16:32:18 2015 UTC,start unloading my NS-7 PDW magazine   Well there's your problem. Try the eridani or sirius. They eat heavies for breakfast.

Planetside,3dxcxv,SpiroAgnewTR,2,Mon Jul 20 10:43:41 2015 UTC,"As a close range infiltrator, you have two ways of killing a competent heavy. Headshots or EMP. EMP seems easy to those on the receiving end, but remember: there's a pretty significant delay between when you push the throw button, when the EMP hits the target and when you can use your gun again, so it is best to throw the EMP from cover or from around a corner or something. (Running the EMP shield implant helps, too because more often than not you accidentally find yourself caught in the blast radius).  As for headshots, well. Supposedly hitboxes are hitboxes regardless of class, but their head kinda gets (visually) buried between those huge shoulder pads. The key is to try. I find myself just aiming centermass all to often and it shows up in my stats and in my K/D. AIM FOR THE HEAD, you will probably miss a lot at first, but as it becomes habit, your close range attacks will become much more pleasant.  I have found that hipfiring is the way to go with SMG's at close range, an ADSing infiltrator is a slower target without much health. I have also found that a lot of heavies do that IDIOTIC duck-sidestep dance in cqc (dude, you already have 1900 health, you are not winning fights because of your dance moves, get a clue). Hipfiring helps against these jokers because it's easier to track them, your movements will still be faster than theirs and they often duck right into your cone of fire.  Engage from cover when you can, after all, with your motion spotter you usually get to be the one who chooses when and where to fight. Good heavies loiter near cover, so wait for them to transition from spot to spot (and are more than a few steps away from safety). Don't chase wounded heavies. I can't recall how many times Kabei has gotten me that way, as soon as they break line of sight with you, assume they're healed up and know where you are. If your ambush doesn't work, just move on and set up a new one, do not throw away your element of surprise by following some guy into a building where he can get the drop on you.  This is all anecdotal of course, but I hope you've found it helpful (or at least not moronic)."

I won't play heavy against infantry anymore. I won't use grenade bandolier with EMP. And so on...   But a few months back, I got killed by someone running a loadout that I really disapproved of and always avoided using. I told him so and he told me something that has both infuriated and changed me:  ""Never go half-cheese. It's a cheesy game and you might as well make the best of it,"" he said.   But, but rocket pods? H-E shells? Maxes? Cloaky Flash roadkills?! At first I dismissed it, but with more thought I realized something. The game will never be fair and deep down I didn't want it to be.  So I've started playing heavy again. I've started running a stalker cloak with a full EMP grenade bandolier. Sometimes, I even pull a chaingun Max! Have my stats improved? Not any more than usual, but I'm a lot less angry and having a lot more fun.

It isn't a problem, it's part of the appeal. Imagine all the kids telling their friends at school ""Yeah, and you can be this 8 foot tall robot with GATLING GUNS for arms..."" Sure, the game would be a lot more fair without Maxes, but they aren't going anywhere and a lot of people love playing as them.  On a personal note, multiplayer stealth was what hooked me. You can play Thief, Metal Gear, Elder Scrolls, etc. All of those games feature deep stealth game play, but they're all single player. Planetside was the first game where I could really be sneaky against other people. It scratched an itch I'd had for decades, and I love it. People call it ""cheesy"" but you know what? Fuck those people. They get their Rambo-masculine-fantasy-bullshit catered to in just about every other game, even in this one, but here I can do my thing and they can do theirs.  All the stuff in this thread doesn't add up to much. Heavy, Infiltrator, and Engineer all get stomped by the same zerg. They all get flattened by the same Raven Maxes. The game is at its very core utterly unfair. I'd love to see more combat parity between classes, but the devs have repeatedly demonstrated they are unwilling to make that happen. So be it."

Example: with 100%  headshots 143@750 kills a resist HA in 480ms, 167@600 kills in 500ms. Which are the same TTKs as 100% bodyshots. With CSHD it will kill trade.  The shield won't save a heavy if you get a stone cold drop on them and don't fuck up the shots. But in any sort of even or near even scenario the shield wins.  But if you're in the middle of the bell curve and it pushes you a bit more to the right you start winning a lot more fights.   Edit: Think about it like an Elo system. If HA overshield lets adds 200ish ""fake"" Elo the people who are at the extreme end don't notice. The overall shift is too small to make you take notice. You go from 97 percentile to 98 percentile.   If you're in the middle and you suddenly shift the same 200 points you go from 50th to 70th."
Planetside,3dxcxv,AffableAutomaton,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:24:36 2015 UTC,"As I've just finished the light assault directive I still think the heavy needs a nerf, not a major one, just a reduction to give the opponent a fair chance. I often find myself using NS-11C shooting a heavy and, yes I'm not amazing at headshotting I usually only land 1-2 of my shots as head shots but a lot of the times I can land at least 4-5 hits on the heavy at 10-40m and he just pops his shield on turns around and destroys me in 3 body hits and a lucky panic head shot. It is frustrating when heavies who either lack awareness or simply got outsmarted by a light assault get to just pop a shield and negate the kill the light assault deserved and instead get a kill himself. This doesn't really apply so much to resist shield primarily the nanite mesh generator as I feel like its the most commonly used and its synergy with nano weave and regen implant or battle hardened is redicilously"

Planetside,3dxcxv,Vocith,-1,Mon Jul 20 10:59:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's been suggested before, but I think the HA Shields should have weak spots, to shoot through for less damage reduction. When engaging an opponent in a skirmish, if they are wearing armour, you should aim for joints and other areas with less protection for comfort and manoeuvrabilities sake. This applies in medieval combat up to the heaviest suits of armour, it can also apply to kevlar vests and helmets in shooters such as counter strike, it already applies for vehicles in Planetside and I believe that it would be a logical element to incorporate into infantry combat.   At long ranges, the shields will still soak up most of the damage from automatic fire, with the odd lucky shot getting through. But having areas onto which accurate fire somewhat negates the effects of the shields (maybe vulnerable spots can get smaller or more protected with certs to require more precise shots) provides a skilful counter to these shields and removes somewhat the invulnerability in a 1v1.  Just my 2 certs."

Planetside,3dxcxv,thaumogenesis,0,Mon Jul 20 11:42:09 2015 UTC,"IMO the shields need to be turned into resistance based like the resist shield. This way a HA retains his totall effective health pool, but is much more vulnerable to being attacked from behind, his effective health pool determined by how quick he was able to hit his shield.  Make nanoweave a huge resist value, like 60-80%, but make it have a much longer recharge."
Planetside,3dxcxv,endeavourl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:59:03 2015 UTC,"Make nanoweave a huge resist value, like 60-80%, but make it have a much longer recharge.   I'm assuming you're talking about nanomesh/Adrenaline, and lol no thats the worst idea possible.   Believe it or not, HA used to be even more powerful. Back in the day, Resist Shield and Nanoweave used to stack with each other, and apply to the head, giving you a 65% resistance and more than doubling your health when shot anywhere. They removed that shit for good reason.   The current HA shields are perfectly fine. They never double your health, and are easily countered with aiming skill and good positioning/situational awareness. All your suggested change would do would be make them better than they already are. Good job."
Planetside,3dxcxv,AffableAutomaton,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:00:42 2015 UTC,"They never double your health,   True. By itself, NMG doesn't double your health. You need to also equip nanoweave to have more than double the effective HP of an infiltrator. NMG provides 700 HP, but doesn't stack with Nano. Once it goes down, Nano applies to the rest of your health and you have 1200 HP. 1900 hitpoints is more than double the 900 provided to baseline infiltrators, but of course they can get nanoweave themselves (boosting their HP to 1080).  I won't debate the fairness of this here, because infiltrators also get tools like EMP and dildars so that they can push the odds into their favor. I will say that infiltrators must use their tools as much as possible, or they are little more than fodder. An infiltrator that doesn't put down motion spotters is probably a useless infiltrator."

Planetside,3dx6bd,Guliensebb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:34:19 2015 UTC,"A year ago they were 700 sc : 7$ (where I live). I paid around 3.50$ for most of them on special deal. And then we had deal to buy a stack of stationcash for the third of the price. I was able and I still am, able to wear all of them with all my classes. Now the same helmets are 1000sc: 10$. And a lot of people then were complaining it was too expensive at 7$, they are even more expensive now. I don't understand why you say we can't complain now?!"
Planetside,3dx6bd,TorokFremen,3,Tue Jul 21 14:02:38 2015 UTC,"The people that would complain would have to be players which got affected by this, but as most of redditors and players with knowledge of the game are basically veterans, they aren't as influenced by this as much as you'd think, this is what I believe at least.

As far as I'm concerened, this game is not that much worse than AAA games, but with the benefit of being one of a kind. By all means, if you enjoy it, buy a boost or membership to support the company. And if you don't want to, grind dem certs. Your friend can consider himself lucky, he didn't play the game right after launch.  Besides, the default weapons are more than decent in many cases (except on the infil - as I'm being told). But you specifically mentioned G2A. If people would just shoot ESFs with their primaries however, they would be deterred just as quickly. Any other aircraft doesn't give a shit about single g2a launchers anyway.  Speaking for myself only: I have a certain rage budget for Planetside 2, but that's usually exhausted after an hour of gameplay. Which consists mostly of dodging friendlies running in front of you, friendlies running you over or friendlies shooting you, as you try to leave the spawnroom. Only very rarely, I have any rage left to waste on reddit or forumside.  That's because the major part of my life's rage budget goes into things like... That cunt that tried to copy my QEDII assignment, my government shepherding idiotic popular beliefs, regarding national energy production and immigration etc., or people in front of me in the queue, paying for a single bottle of beer with their EC cards (and then twice typing in their PIN wrongly)...  I suggest you budgetize your rage, too. This game's history has proven, that we can influence the current owners/developers decisions, when it comes to gameplay. Rarely however, regarding monetarization. And looking at performance and inter-faction balancing, I suggest you concentrate your efforts on goals within our reach."

EDIT: Yeah, I know the high cert prices aren't really related to the smedbucks drop of the cosmetics, but the two events are still tied together.

Planetside,3dx6bd,PTMC-Cattan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:50:05 2015 UTC,"Well technically no, they don't. But in fact it's a little different: If you were around back when the game launched, you might remember how horribly long it was to get any certs at all. Sure, we had 12 free certs a day, but XP gain was slow. Basically, only kills, support, point caps and facility caps gave XP. Now? Support give at least twice as much, assists have been buffed, vehicle kills have been buffed, point ""guarding"" is a thing, ribbons as well, etc... You get the idea. So even if the prices hadn't moved, the weapons in the depot were actually cheaper than they were at launch, and the game cannot be profitable to DGC in those conditions. Kinda like economy, really: if peoples have more money, prices must go up."

Planetside,3dx6bd,Kofilin,2,Mon Jul 20 16:47:40 2015 UTC,"There is nothing to forgive, yet even to be angry about.  This game has a cert inflation problem, and they obviously can't keep pumping on the content treadmill before running in circles. That's part of the reason why the implant system was introduced, to make people spend certs on implants.  So yeah, increasing prices is a bandaid, but it helps alleviate the problem."
Planetside,3dx6bd,MrUnimport,2,Mon Jul 20 09:38:32 2015 UTC,Cert inflation is insurmountable for vets and not even remotely a problem for newbies. BR100s already have everything and are not affected by price hikes. BR15s have nothing (except 1500 certs) and are crushed by price hikes aimed at those who're significantly higher level.

It's just that given the relatively high cert gain, there are more important things to complain about. Some are even related to the downsides of increasing cert costs, tackling the problems from a different angle. For example, informing new players how to wisely use their certs, instead of giving them more to waste when they don't know any better.  Of course, all of our suggestions regarding new player experience got ignored/passed over anyway, so we eventually got bored and moved onto a new topic. Right now it's leadership updates again. We'll get back to the rest once we're bored of this one, same as always."

Some of the guns that they changed to be more expensive probably SHOULD have been more expensive (tank buster), and there was a 125 cert price cut for most vehicle weapons.  They also gave new characters 1500 free certs, which I think balances out those price changes pretty nicely.  Yeah, I don't get the 1500 certs, but I already bought most of the discounted guns before the price change anyway."

I no longer had several other upgrades I had purchased for vehicles, but again I didn't receive enough certs back to pay for them all.

Planetside,3dx6bd,Jarcode,0,Tue Jul 21 00:18:26 2015 UTC,"The problem with buying weapons with DBG cash is that it's a waste, you can easily get even 1000 cert weapons allocating anywhere from a couple of days worth of game time to a couple of hours of farming . . . even grinding out the certs is more fun than opening my wallet to pay for something I can get just by playing the game. Mediocre and good players most often turn away at the thought of buying weapons with DB cash - it's a waste of money.  This is made even worse that new players now powerhouse out certs from br 1-20, those extra cert rewards will make gun prices even more ridiculous because of the amount of certs they are making when they first get into the game.  I seriously can't imagine that DBG makes much off of gun purchases anymore. Gold/black gun variants are really the only weapons worth buying with SC because you like the look of the gun, and then, in a way, you're really just buying cosmetics again. Paying to get past the grind in planetside is like paying 100 dollars to get past a few days (up to a week) worth of gameplay, which is not practical.  Cash prices for weapons need to be brought way down, and they need to focus on what will keep selling, cool cosmetics, voice packs, etc. I will continue to tell new players I run into to not buy weapons and to pimp out their character, because you can get every weapon by having fun in the game, and weapons are wayyy overpriced (in terms of DB cash)."

Now at least the newer guys might want to pay some cash for the gun instead of ""grinding"" for it - something I think most (at least a majority) are perfectly fine with (since those of us that have been around have all of the weapons we want anyway).

Planetside,3e123e,Edomek,4,Tue Jul 21 03:25:33 2015 UTC,Theoretical TTK for weapons would be faster than any animation to activate a shield so they become useless at CQC.  IF they didn't drain as fast or not at all that would be fine and they become precautionary abilities.  How that affects balance I don't know
Planetside,3e123e,Trojanbp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:26:57 2015 UTC,"That's a great point actually. Time to swap a weapon would have to be lowered as well which is probably too time and resources consuming to be made, especially with addition of other changes."
Planetside,3e123e,Nikye_VS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:32:23 2015 UTC,"This depends purely on the speed the shields would activate. Theoretical TTK is great for players with perfect accuracy, which are very few. Even so, the shield's uptime should be balanced between current TTK and player skill. The shields should that should be used preemptively should have longer charge-ups, while those intended for reactional use would have shorter charge-ups.  A half-second would allow Heavies who are caught completely offguard to be killed without retaliation, while those who realize they are under attack, or against less-than-accurate enemies (read: most of the playerbase) would still get the full advantage their shield should offer."
Planetside,3e123e,DJCzerny,3,Tue Jul 21 04:52:53 2015 UTC,Adding a small delay to shields would change absolutely nothing. Adding a larger delay automatically makes NMG and Adrenaline useless.

There was talk of this being placed on the PTS in March, but since then, I've heard no word of it. It hasn't come in on any patches, and the devs (to my knowledge) haven't said anything either. I've asked about it a couple of times, no answers."
Planetside,3e123e,CzerwonyKolorNicku,6,Tue Jul 21 03:27:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly this type of animation. Engineers has this moment of defenselessness when dropping ammo, LA are not even close to accurate when flying, infiltrator can't shoot while cloaking, medics can't do anything other than put shield device in that time, but HA has the biggest life changer in a matter of moment."
Planetside,3e123e,Atakx,2,Tue Jul 21 03:31:41 2015 UTC,It also halves the heavies move speed as it is and this stacks ontop of ads speed meaning a shielded heavy is incredibly slow
Planetside,3e123e,_AlliN_,3,Tue Jul 21 05:54:22 2015 UTC,It doesn't mean shit if the heavy isn't bad.
Planetside,3e123e,Atakx,2,Tue Jul 21 06:25:48 2015 UTC,"but it does if the guy the heavy is fighting isn't a scrub, Reaper+slow as shit target=one salty heavy and just another day as a medic."
Planetside,3e123e,CzerwonyKolorNicku,2,Tue Jul 21 09:32:39 2015 UTC,"So wait, are you actualy saying there are people winning HA 1vs1?  Impossibiru! Blasphemy!"
Planetside,3e123e,Atakx,3,Tue Jul 21 10:19:28 2015 UTC,"We've been saying it all along, if you get dunked by a heavy there is a good chance he would have dunked you regardless of class."
Planetside,3e123e,sikira1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:40:53 2015 UTC,A good player will hit his target regardless if it's moving at 0.25 speed or 1.0
Planetside,3e123e,Emperorpenguin5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:29:48 2015 UTC,Works both ways
Planetside,3e123e,Nikye_VS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:50:24 2015 UTC,"Will people for once understand: heavy assaults main role is killing shit, it is AI, AA, AT, AM. It cant revive and heal, cant fly, cant cloack, cant repair and drop ammo. Its main purpose is to kill and if you are dumb dont go 1v1 heavy with any class and learn how to aim."
Planetside,3e123e,Atakx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:10:01 2015 UTC,"I would agree to this if either A the Drain while on is Significantly Less, or B it was removed entirely."
Planetside,3e123e,endeavourl,5,Tue Jul 21 04:31:36 2015 UTC,I feel like both options are pretty good.
Planetside,3e123e,Atakx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:33:52 2015 UTC,"Removing the drain makes little sense as it removes the tactical side from using the shield. If there was no drain, a Heavy could activate the shield and literally never have to worry about turning it off. The only time it would drain is under enemy fire, and the new standard for Heavies would be to activate their shield the moment they spawn. That defeats the entire purpose of having a proverbial 'charge up' time to their shields."
Planetside,3e123e,Vocith,2,Tue Jul 21 04:46:06 2015 UTC,but the charge up makes two shields worthless and makes resist the only one remotely viable.
Planetside,3e123e,Nikye_VS,0,Tue Jul 21 05:52:39 2015 UTC,Worthless as in not winning when you were jumped and actually using it to breach?
Planetside,3e123e,Vocith,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:13:03 2015 UTC,"worthless as in it wouldn't last long enough to breach simply because i just drained half of it getting in the room since i now have to wait on it to activate first and then breach with activation cost i lost a decent chunk and every second i lose a bullet or so i could of soaked, in this case i would only need resist shield NMG and adrenaline would have no purpose and you cant put a delay on resist shield because it requires preemptive activation, also latency would make this a nightmare you think its bull shit getting killed around a corner, imagine getting taken out because latency+clientside+delay=your shield never works to begin with.  EDIT: This is why it didn't work last time it made resist the only shield viable, and meant the other two would need to be reworked entirely."
Planetside,3e123e,Emperorpenguin5,4,Tue Jul 21 09:30:29 2015 UTC,It was March of last year.   The developers received negative feedback from the player base and canceled the change.

Planetside,3e123e,_AlliN_,3,Tue Jul 21 04:32:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think that is the same.  The changes for Pilots were for PS2 on PS4. That was going to happen come Hell or High Water.

Planetside,3e123e,CzerwonyKolorNicku,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:36:58 2015 UTC,What pilot change? I'm sort of new and interested.
Planetside,3e123e,Emperorpenguin5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:19:41 2015 UTC,"Most flying controls were changed from digital to analog, casual pilots didn't even notice that, while the elites had difficulties with adjusting to new aiming acceleration and reverse maneuver changed behavior, some of them even quit the game because of this."
Planetside,3e123e,Atakx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:24:38 2015 UTC,"And MatiAce said that he sees the change, but he does not think it has any important impact after he tried it. I can almost bet this is becasue after the change emulation of keys could no longer be done by software to allow for joystick control or other think automating the process, like a reverse macro that no longer works after patch.  and In all essence, if anything I see more random pilots with amazing aim lately than before the patch. It's not really logical that veteran would struggle to learn something that casual can sort out so fast. It must be something else underneath the problem.  In the meantime, Yaw still can't be changed with roll on keybinds, joystick does not work - nothing changed in that regard, seems that's not worth fixing."

Planetside,3e123e,endeavourl,2,Tue Jul 21 04:10:56 2015 UTC,"That would make little sense in terms of balance, given that NMG/Adrenaline are primarily reactive in their function. They would have to be buffed pretty substantially to justify erasing the playstyle around them."
Planetside,3e123e,doombro,6,Tue Jul 21 04:06:35 2015 UTC,The playstyle of just pressing a button and having 150% of health?
Planetside,3e123e,endeavourl,3,Tue Jul 21 04:15:44 2015 UTC,"If you made this thread just to express your salt towards HA players, you should have just said so.  In short, yes. The playstyle of carefully choosing when to activate your shield is Resist's game. If there was a windup of any kind, NMG/Adrenaline would be pretty much null and void as viable options."
Planetside,3e123e,doombro,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:17:06 2015 UTC,"Oh, you might be right, this was a little bit salty, I'm sorry. I was pretty much curious about reasoning about it and I'm asking more experienced players how would it change HA if such thing was indeed a thing :-D"
Planetside,3e123e,RewmanG,3,Tue Jul 21 04:20:37 2015 UTC,"The easiest way to get your way would be to simply remove NMG/Adrenaline from the game.   NMG/Adrenaline are balanced around their ability to be used reactively, since they tank incoming damage directly. The downside is that they have very trashy uptime. Once they're drained (which can happen just from a stray EMP nade) they take a very long time to restore. In Adrenaline's case, you need well over 1 KPM to keep the meter on the fuller end.  Resist on the other hand only mitigates damage, so if you don't activate it ahead of time, you're getting far less benefit out of it. The upside is that resist has much better uptime, as taking direct damage doesn't drain the shield, and it refills much faster than the other shields.   So, if you had to play the same way with NMG/Adrenaline, they would pretty much be objectively worse than resist, as they would lose their greatest benefit."
Planetside,3e123e,MECHA_HARVESTER,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:25:42 2015 UTC,"Don't blame the guy using a hammer on a nail, its the job the shield currently serves, resist is guaranteed to outlive the user and its often used preemptively as it will always last the same amount always, NMG is very reactive and adrenaline dances between the two with its unique recharge, but NMG and adrenaline shield tick down very quickly on top of being drained while damaged, add a delay and i gave up more then half my ability just preparing for an engagement and am actually losing effectiveness as a whole from using it, with most of the changes that get mentioned resist shield remains the only viable one left of the three, imagine if your jet pack had to accelerate to full thrust before lifting you and drained half your tank just to get off the ground."

All this leading to the inevitable TK wars.  They are also heavily reliant on a pretty ugly mess of a tunnel system. In my experience from watching tech plants and amps, most casuals blithely ignore the tunnels and would rather run out the regular spawn doors or just sit inside shooting out through them.  You are far more likely to get frustrated with your own empire during an interlink fight than you are with the opposing one."

That is all he does, goes somewhere, drink the potion, become a tree and hope for some tiny amount of xp from others efforts.    Edit: I just remembered, he released a ""best of"" video from his adventures. It was more or less forty minutes with a tree in different spots, varying environments, night and day. Sometimes someone would run by, most times not. People spent a lot of time trying to figure out the ""best of"" parts to no avail.    Greatest troll on the sub that day :-)"

Planetside,3dw8yp,Ridiculisk1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:36:36 2015 UTC,That's for the Flash right? I prefer not to use vehicles. I do occasionally flank behind enemy lines to spot high threat targets (or place a waypoint on target). Thanks for the suggestion though.
Planetside,3dw8yp,Ridiculisk1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:50:34 2015 UTC,"Flash, ESFs and Valks have Scout Radar.

Highly recommended, extremely under utilized."

Planetside,3dw8yp,Korsakov829,4,Mon Jul 20 04:04:20 2015 UTC,Not Recon Darts. It always stays at 5 (Max rank). I run Ammo Belt so I can carry more Detect Bolt rounds for my Hunter QCX. Ammo Belt 4 gives me an extra 4 mags worth (16 extra Detect Bolts). Hope this makes some sense.

Also that a maxed out Scout Radar on a Valk/ESF will paint the entirety of a Amp station while parked in the vehicle bay?

This leads to weird shit where if you ram 2 vehicles at a 45-90 degree angle.  On your screen he is ramming your side and on his screen you are ramming his side.  As long as one of the two of you are driving, you will accelerate at a 45 degree angle.  When this happens to me I take my hands off the keyboard and start screaming on proxy for the other guy to do the same.  Otherwise his vehicle will push mine on my screen which is pushing his on his screen and we begin our journey to 88kph.  Screw these time warp lag compensation physics."

Planetside,3dxeyc,Astriania,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:46:39 2015 UTC,Yeah this is why. A vehicle ram needs to happen on one of the screens (which is why occasionally you get a 'ram' death when you missed by 50m on your screen).  Vehicles are also much bigger targets.
Planetside,3dxeyc,P5_Tempname19,7,Mon Jul 20 17:58:24 2015 UTC,"When you are trying to run over someone the hitdetection seems to be entirely on their side, you have to run them over on their screen, which can be quite hard especially because of lag.  Hitdetection between vehicles seems to be counted on either end, although I am not 100% sure about that, either way its not entirely on the other persons side (that wouldnt work anyway as you are both in vehicles), so there is some client-side influence, making it easier."

The XP are a bonus.  The only XP I try to ninja everytime with low BR char are the ones thrown at you when you sit on a flipping point. But that's about it.

Planetside,3dw68s,TheEyelander,4,Mon Jul 20 03:33:46 2015 UTC,Shh it's totally an original idea.   I'm actually going for a slightly different effect. The Recursion tracker will give you a callout for HE farming or for spamming a Phalanx turret at a Sunderer for free kills.  My goal is to reward risky behavior with more XP to encourage it over risk-free behavior. The idea that an MBT kill is worth 100 XP if you do it with your Lancer but it's worth 1100 if you do it with your crossbow might get more people using the crossbows.

Planetside,3dw68s,LitwinL,4,Mon Jul 20 17:42:13 2015 UTC,"That is plain stupid and unfair. As a heavy I need to land 5 rockets and an AV granade on a lightning and it still won't go down unless I'm close enough to drop a brick of c4 on it and if I do I'll get 200xp total? XP should be awarded based on levet of threat not because you want people to use something else against it as it will discourage players from playing how they like. Also at some point certs make no difference, as infantry only I've got around 25k certs and no clue what to spend them on and already have nicely certed vehicles.   As for the part about additional situational bonuses I think it will screw up new players as they won't be able to get them and cost of things will go up since it's easier to earn them"
Planetside,3dw68s,spambot5546,2,Mon Jul 20 10:26:26 2015 UTC,"XP should be awarded based on levet of threat   This right here is why OP is a bad idea. We reward XP to encourage players to do things that help their faction. Things they might not otherwise do.  That's why it's important that actions like repping get recognized. Otherwise no one would bother repairing friendly stuff.  Things that people would do anyway, like aim for the head, don't need an XP reward. You already get a benefit from headshots: you kill your target faster. It's also counterproductive to try to force people to work from a particular role. A kill is a kill, regardless of if you do it from a tank, an ESF, or with small arms. It has the same benefit for your team."
Planetside,3dw68s,LitwinL,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:14:28 2015 UTC,"You'd get a bonus for killing the Lightning with something that requires you to risk yourself to do it. 5 rockets and an AV grenade with a brick of C4 (first of all, that's enough for 2 Lightning kills) would get you the Present Bonus and the kill would be worth 300XP + whatever the driver's worth."

Planetside,3dw68s,LitwinL,0,Mon Jul 20 11:47:43 2015 UTC,Why? Last-hitting him with C4 costs more nanites and has more risk than any other method of killing him. It should be worth more.

Planetside,3dw68s,Mustarde,0,Mon Jul 20 12:04:14 2015 UTC,It's not like a MANA turret or a Raven MAX has to risk himself. C4 you risk getting spotted if nothing else.
Planetside,3dw68s,Mustarde,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:17:12 2015 UTC,"AV MANA turret is a sniper bait, as for long range MAX nests I can't comment since I'm TR but last time I tried something similar I ended up dead after being shot by 4 archers. So from my point of view there are threats to both of those options."
Planetside,3dw68s,LitwinL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:01:24 2015 UTC,"Some of the latter ideas you mentioned are pretty neat.  But all the stuff in your main paragraph, trying to reconfigure XP rewards so only domain vs. domain gets rewarded I do not agree with.  I mean, we could take this to its logical conclusion - if a tank kills infantry, it is rewarded 25 XP...  hmmm, maybe it's not such a bad idea"
Planetside,3dw68s,LitwinL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:41:38 2015 UTC,"That's not what I'm trying to do at all.  A tank killing infantry with long-range HE spam would get the normal (or, using your example with kills that are worth 25XP, highly reduced) XP reward. But a tank that gets in close, getting roadkills and taking hits, would earn 100 per kill because it's risking itself to do it.  It's not domain-versus-domain, it's risk-versus-reward."
Planetside,3dw68s,NookNookNook,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:46:53 2015 UTC,"So you want c4 to give 200xp, so now instead of 600xp for killing an MBT, you get 100 + 200 = 300.  Yet tank v tank is still 600 + 100 superiority bonus.  Again, it's not a terrible idea but your specifics seem pretty biased towards your preferred playstyle.  Also there's only so much that you can do to quantify risk.  A range-based XP system that punishes distance and rewards CQC tanking is silly since that could be the exact opposite of what is smart for the player in that scenario.  Sometimes tanks are completely safe shelling a spawn room, other times they are engaging the same distances but at high risk of being flanked or dropped on.  I guess I'm just not sure why you think if an infantry kills a tank it should only get 100XP.  I don't think I saw an XP reward idea to make up for that."

That being said, I still think it is worth 500 XP - if you died from a lancer, it was due to coordinated fire.  I suppose that I actually prefer the current XP reward system we have in place.  I would like to see some tweaks to XP - get rid of the caps for ammo resupply and repair.  Find a way to reward terminal hacking (small xp for each time the terminal is used?  probably hard to do/exploitable though).  Otherwise, I don't have a lot of issues with the current XP system to be honest.  Your ideas are kind of cool, but I feel like you are trying to use them to disincentivize or punish certain types of kills that in particular are hostile to your playstyle as a tanker."
Planetside,3dw68s,DJCzerny,0,Mon Jul 20 14:16:38 2015 UTC,"The numbers are honestly irrelevant. The C4 bonus can be 500 f that fixes the problem you have with the idea.

The spawn XP changes were designed to give less XP for freshly-spawned players no matter how you killed them. So, killing one with a sniper hit to the head or a tank round to the gut made no difference.  In this system, you simply get increased rewards for doing your killing in a way that allows counterplay. You can still do the killing."

Planetside,3dxx8a,GhostAvatar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:13:06 2015 UTC,"The 5820k most likely won't OC better since it's already putting out WAY more heat, and that's usually where overclocking hits its limits. Any CPU from an i5 up (REAL quad core i5) is plenty for PS2 and gaming in general. Since you're talking about crossfiring, the 5820k is better for it since it supports more PCIe lanes than any LGA 1150 CPU, which will benefit your crossfire plans. Just keep in mind that pcie 2.0 x16 OR pcie 3.0 x8 is enough to run any card up to a GTX 780 and likely beyond without being a bottleneck, so the extra lanes aren't really needed right now. For reference, my i7 @ 4.8GHz doesn't limit my framerate, my GTX 780 SC on Ultra does. I usually hover at 60FPS dropping down to 40 in large fights and some weird spots on Hossin."

Planetside,3dxx8a,Wobberjockey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:14:52 2015 UTC,If the rig is purely for gaming. Then I would suggest neither (even with future proofing taken into consideration). 4690K will be more than enough. And the money you save could be saved towards upgrading other parts down the line. I am confused about the WD black series HDD. Is this part a upgrade or existing?
Planetside,3dxx8a,BreakfastDeluxe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:29:08 2015 UTC,"I was also wanting to start dabbling in video editing too, so if I didn't go with the 5820k, then I still feel like the 4790k would be good for giving me that ability to play around with editing, compression, etc.  The WD black is part of the upgrade. I figured I'd run Windows off the SSD and keep all my other files on the WD black, getting additional storage as needed. Is there a better option for that while still being a bit price conscious?"
Planetside,3dxx8a,Polystigma,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:53:54 2015 UTC,"When paired with a SSD, you are paying a premium for the black that isn't beneficial. In fact, the blue will perform better than the black when used for pure mass storage. The black is only beneficial for users running storage and OS on a single drive (due to the higher endurance when constantly accessing OS files etc.). I would only consider using the black for mass storage, when paired with a SSD, on 2 TB and above (simply because the blue only goes up to 1 TB max, due to the single platter design). Otherwise save your money. On a side note, if you are considering dabbling in video editing. I would probably suggest a larger HDD capacity. They can get full fairly quickly, especially if it is gaming video you are considering doing.  As for the CPU. I would probably stick with the 4790K. The performance advantage on the 5820K is marginal at present. And the accompanying DDR4 it really expensive for almost identical performance as DDR3. The 4790K will stand you in good stead for a few years to come. As for future proofing, that always a hard one to tell. Because no one knows what going to happen in the future. But most developers will not make full use of hardware improvements for a while after release. Its not normally worth there time to invest resources and money optimizing/utilizing for such tech, when only a small portion of there user base utilizes it and will gain benefits from it (especially in gaming). And by the time the software developers have caught up, the chip will mostly likely be superseded by a few generations.  And one last thing, I would OC the 4790K. With that cooler, you should easily get 4.4 GHz with no issue (which is what I am running my 4690K at). PS2 will thank you for it."
Planetside,3dxx8a,Wobberjockey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:52:12 2015 UTC,"Ok, I understand what you're saying about the drives. But for the CPU and DDR4, I've seen prices that are on par with DDR3 but of course the CAS latency is much higher. Doing some quick google fu, it seems like I might not notice a huge impact for most applications. A lot of the older reviews and Q&As about the 5820k talk about expensive RAM and mobo being a reason to stick with the 4970k, but at this point I feel those price differences are no longer extreme and probably as close to equal as they can get until DDR3 is completely phased out years and years from now."
Planetside,3dxx8a,Polystigma,2,Mon Jul 20 23:18:50 2015 UTC,"I can understand why you would want to go for that.

Planetside,3dxvqf,Dumbleass,2,Mon Jul 20 14:03:27 2015 UTC,Too many bases + too many links = nonexistent battle flow .  This is the case 80% of the time.The system they have in place only works for peak hour pops. Other than that its bad for the game.

Planetside,3dukej,Peptuck,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:52:06 2015 UTC,"So essentially it's mainly for snipers, as opposed to stealth flanking. Right?"
Planetside,3dukej,Gav1n_,4,Sun Jul 19 22:56:59 2015 UTC,"Stalker Cloak is used for recon, infiltration, fucking around with other players in the most dickish ways possible, and sniping with high-powered pistol. You can't use your primary weapon with it equipped, though, so you're stuck with your knife and pistol. I generally switch to it when I want to sneak into a base and flip enemy equipment or ghost-cap to screw with the enemy.  Its also really, really useful for when you want to do recon work for your team by marking targets. If you have a squad or platoon, you can keep them updated on enemy positions and movements through squad and platoon speak or a teamspeak server."
Planetside,3dukej,Wobberjockey,3,Sun Jul 19 23:36:28 2015 UTC,"No not for snipers, you can only use a pistol with it"
Planetside,3dukej,Teoke,2,Mon Jul 20 01:17:20 2015 UTC,"Stalker cloak locks out your primary weapon slot.   if you want to snipe with it, it's the Blackhand or the crossbow."
Planetside,3dukej,ToMuchShineOut,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:48:53 2015 UTC,"It is for people who enjoy sniping, but I wouldn't say it isn't for flanking. I can't count the number of times when I got behind enemy lines and merrily sniped their heads off while their attention was focused elsewhere. Just make sure you keep some distance from them since you do not want a CQC engagement. Always go for headshots. As Faxon commented, an easy way to get into position is using a taxi ESF (or valk if the air is clear)."

I know you said no sights suggestions but personally, I'd stick with 1x and 2x for 99% of the weapons in the beginning until you get a good feel for them.

Planetside,3dxi2v,CuteBeaver,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:40:36 2015 UTC,"For crossbow knife antics you want to choose the older style knives which do not have the delay.  Secondly you should probably look at your keybindings because that matters more then anything.  Consider what your hands are actually doing while you play. Weed out inefficient bindings. For example I use:  Left Hand: (Keyboard)  Pinky: crouch or sprint  Left Ring: Left movement  Left Mid: Forwards  or Backwards  Left Index : Right movement  Thumb :  Nades  Right Hand: (Mouse)  Thumb: selects weapons / motion / mines / spotting and is also dedicated to quick-knife.   Fingers: Fire / ADS / Jump / Mini map zoom using the wheel.   I most certainly want to be able to press fire and knife nearly instantaneously. Assigning the knife key to to my thumb duties makes this very easy since its tasks are related  to weapon swaps, cloaking and decloaking ect. There should never be a situation where I need press something else using my thumb at the same exact moment in time. If i want to decloak and knife , the keys on the mouse are right next to each other allowing for a rapid press.   Look at your keybindings? Is there anything you could do to increase your reaction time? A new layout you could try? Are you depending too much on one finger, or hand and running into problems from that?"
Planetside,3dxi2v,lespretend,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:03:04 2015 UTC,I use a standard knife and have no problems with a shoot+knife combo. There's a delay if you try and knife someone then knife again though. They always run away before the second knife goes off so use a regular knife
Planetside,3duq2l,Vindicore,21,Sun Jul 19 17:42:40 2015 UTC,"As a warpgate capture mechanic, I'd suggest that capping the three adjoining territories would begin a 10 minute capture countdown after which the warpgate changes ownership. This allows defenders to organize a counter-attack while not forcing the entire population to converge on a single location.  Optionally, when the capture is 70% complete (3 mins left), the warpgate shield can come down and allow the battle to proceed to the warpgate itself.  I can see one glaring issue with the warpgate capture though - the other side of the link. I don't like the idea of flipping the three territories on the other side automatically. I think it would be better if the battle carried on to the other side.  The best case scenario for that would be if soldiers and vehicles could actually travel through warpgates to the other side. Then you could just declare the warpgate neutral at this point, disable spawning on both sides, and let people duke it out with sunderer spawns and etc.  If warpgate travel is not a possibility, the attacking side can be given temporary control of the warpgate for, say, 30 minutes to gain a permanent foothold. So they basically find themselves in a reversed situation, with a countdown timer at the end of which the warpgate changes ownership again, ping ponging between two sides until one side manages to push out on the other side while it's their turn.  Another possibility is to only allow warpgate capture if the faction secures both sides of the warpgate first. That is, push towards the warpgates on both continents with a 2-pronged attack, and capture all 6 bases. This would make it a very difficult challenge, only possible with excellent coordination. Capturing a warpgate would be a true achievement.  The only thing left to address would be being zero-based. I guess the simplest solution would be to simply disallow the capture of a faction's last warpgate (on both sides, so the faction has 2 continents to fight on), and give them a ""last stand"" buff that gives them triple xp and -90% resource cost on everything. Possibly starting the bonuses at lower values and increasing over time.  Looking forward to your finalized version!"
Planetside,3duq2l,obuw,4,Sun Jul 19 18:56:33 2015 UTC,"Another possibility is to only allow warpgate capture if the faction secures both sides of the warpgate first.   I'm not sure this would work. For example, in the posted pic how would NC get to esamir to cap a sister warpgate?"
Planetside,3duq2l,TurboVodka,5,Sun Jul 19 20:56:18 2015 UTC,"Well, it's obvious. They'd need to, ... uhm ... ok ... good point. I knew I was missing something. :P  Back to the drawing board."
Planetside,3duq2l,obuw,3,Sun Jul 19 21:21:07 2015 UTC,"The problem I was trying to avoid by flipping the adjoining three regions automatically was that of having to fight within the warpgate after spawning into it immediately (likely dying before you get your bearings, let alone see how much weaponry is pointing at you).  I mean we could have a protected center point you would just have a PS1 style problem where the defenders just camp the shield bubble with everything they have."
Planetside,3duq2l,obuw,2,Sun Jul 19 21:10:29 2015 UTC,"Well, you have to consider the fact that unlike PS1, numbers are everything in PS2. And if you have the numbers to take a warpgate, you'll have the numbers to push through from the other side. ( The side losing their warpgate would probably be severely outnumbered to begin with ).  But it would be a good idea to make a few tweaks to sanctuaries to alleviate the problem of course. Shielded doors for the main spawn building, teleporters to the towers, etc.  Edit:  If you want to keep it simple, your suggestion of flipping the regions automatically could work, but I think it would be better if there was a 10 minute countdown like I suggested on both sides of the warpgate, with the territory blinking on the map to indicate it's being capped from the other side.  The thing I don't like about the auto-flipping is that it's a land grant without any battle to show for it. Basically the big problem is that the defenders can just set up sunderers at the bases on the other side, wait for them to flip to the enemy, and immediately (within a few minutes) capture them back without giving the attackers time to organize, switch continents and secure their newly granted land."
Planetside,3duq2l,MacroCode,2,Sun Jul 19 21:18:27 2015 UTC,I like your 10 minute timer idea and I've got a slight change I think might work.  Warpgates are big and important they oughta take a while to capture.  Maybe a 7-10 minute timer when you've captured the three surrounding territories.  When that runs out the shield bubble drops.  I think this gives plenty of time to organize a defense in the bubble or make a mad rush to capture a poorly defended territory.  (Really cool looking towers can be added with lasers hacking the shield during this time)  With the bubble down the fight moves into the warpgates territory.  The buildings will need to be changed to allow for real combat in that zone.  3-4 points basic capture mechanics a timer about 10 minutes. With the setup timer of 7-10 minutes it should be a fairly good/well defended fight.  Since the Warpgate is so large already the points can be really far apart with room for all forms of combined arms between them. Defenders will need mobility advantages I guess though.  Now that we've capped the warpgate the corresponding one should switch to our side.  Then a 10-15 minute timer should start giving both sides time to switch continents. Then the new warpgate owners have time to cap one of the nearby territories. If they fail the shield comes down and the attackers get a chance to retake it.  All told it should take about an hour to get through the gate to the other side.  Then maybe another hour to take all 3 surrounding territories.  And yes I aware if the fight converges on the warpgate it could (and probably will) turn into a biolab lag fest but bigger because its a warpgate.  TL:DR cap 3 adjacent territories 10 minutes later shield drops.  cap points in warpgate itself 10 minute timer or more to cap warpgate.  Cap a territory on the other continent in 15 minutes to solidify your hold on the new warpgate.
Planetside,3duq2l,obuw,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:00:01 2015 UTC,"I didn't want to change the warpgate structure too much as that's a lot of work, so I wanted to encourage the fights to occur in the adjacent bases instead, basically making the adjacent bases the [A] [B] [C] points for the warpgate. It would of course be cool to fight in the actual warpgates, with proper defensive structures and such."
Planetside,3duq2l,MacroCode,2,Sun Jul 19 22:17:26 2015 UTC,I agree.  We can still add the towers with the lasers though right? please?  And I feel like there ought to be multiple phases to the battle.  More than just cap the adjacent territories and cap one on the other side.  A third phase would make it really rewarding and progressive to take a warpgate.
Planetside,3duq2l,obuw,2,Sun Jul 19 22:24:00 2015 UTC,"I kinda also thought about lasers drilling into the warpgate shield when I was typing out my original post. Would definitely be pretty cool. :P  As for multiple phases to the battle, I think we are pretty much suggesting very similar things. It's just a matter of weighing the work required."

Since numbers and teamwork are such a critical component to success in PS2, what if we gave the masses a single objective to focus on?  Whenever someone brings up the topic of continent lattice and capturable warpgates, I like to think that this EVE Online trailer could be used as a model.   -->https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDVEHE10nHc<--   Enemy controls the 3 surrounding bases, Warpgate shield enters a ""Vulnerable"" state Concentrated firepower (Think the DPS that 50+ 2/2 AP Vanguards put out with continuous fire) on the shield is able to destablilize the shield to the point where infantry and GSD-equipped vehicles can pass through it (However this firepower needs to be maintained, otherwise the shield begins to regenerate) To allow smaller groups the same capability, generators around the outside (Small outposts just past the current warpgate defenses) can create small, temporary, regional vulnerabilities in the shield that can allow small groups to enter (No more that ~48 persons, or 4 Sunderers, before the nanite pipe connected to the base regenerates the destroyed generator (~1min repair time) While this is happening, people on the lattice-continent connected to that base are mobilizing a counter-attack, and using the inter-continent link, move their infantry and vehicles through the link, showing up in the contested warpgate in a staging garage/hanger-like area (Picture ESF's pouring out of launch-tube like structures, Star Wars style) <- NO SHOOTING OUT OF IT THOUGH Meanwhile in the contested warpgate, the defenders are using any and all means to keep people out of their warpgate, since the repercussions are severe. The main set of 4 generators need to be kept stable to prevent the Warpgate shield from dropping. Even destabilizing a generator creates a vulnerability in the shield along that cardinal point, allowing certain larger projectiles, as well as the above mentioned items, to enter. Additionally, by disrupting the enemy firepower to the shield, the remaining enemies inside the Warpgate can be cleared out, and a retaliation can commence. Finally, should all of the 4 Primary internal generators be destroyed, a 5 minute countdown commences, and if the defenders are unable to repair 2/4 generators in that time, their connection to the continent via that lattice is severed, as well as the warpgate in the next continent over. They are given a respawn option at any of the 3 surrounding bases, and now have the option to attempt to retake their warpgate.   Things that are missing from Warpgates to facilitate this system: - Tactically-oriented spawn points - Teleporters/tubes - Transport garage/hangers linking both continents - Primary internal generators - Secondary external generators  Let me know what you think!"

Planetside,3duq2l,9xInfinity,7,Mon Jul 20 07:40:59 2015 UTC,"Until people care about capturing bases and capturing continents, an intercontinental lattice is worthless. Territory is meaningless beyond alerts, and making continent rotation based on a lattice arrangement rather than arbitrary based on alert results will not get people anymore interested in taking territory, or result in any greater strategic depth, than the game currently has. We know this, because PS1 had an intercontinental lattice, and people were similarly apathetic about taking/losing territory.  The first step to strategic depth is making base ownership actually mean something in terms of gameplay. There needs to be real effects for taking territory, for winning continents. What we have now is garbage that people couldn't care less about. There will never be strategic depth to this game when there's nothing for empires to compete over."
Planetside,3duq2l,TheRandomnatrix,4,Sun Jul 19 19:50:55 2015 UTC,"Tech Plants matter.  Well.  The first one does.  Three point bases are great to defend but beyond that you are very, very correct.  We need base perks that mean something and have a real affect over the region."

People don't like Eisa tech because it denies them MBTs if they don't have it(there's always warpgate road trip, but that's boring). But then they similarly complain about territory not mattering. If we had stuff like Biolabs giving medkits, and towers air access or any other form of benefit they have to work to keep then there'd be nonstop bitching because their playstyles get threatened.

Planetside,3duq2l,9xInfinity,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:34:04 2015 UTC,I think the key to territory bonuses are regional benefits. So you take say Eisa Southern Camp and in the Eisa region you get faster respawn timers or automated base turrets for example
Planetside,3duq2l,alexm42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:47:48 2015 UTC,"Don't agree. Benefits for your empire doing well need to be global. Taking territory should have benefits that span continents. Benefits which affect both ground and air, vehicle and infantry gameplay. Stuff like automated base turrets would be unnoticed by 99% of players. People aren't going to be interested in vague strategic gain which won't affect their gameplay at all personally.  The problem is how to give things benefits that a) don't piss off people who wish the game had no MAXs and only one class and were a totally egalitarian deathmatch FPS, and b) doesn't involve too much work for DBG's itty bitty dev team. Stuff like +exp or -spawn timers are boring and irrelevant, but stuff like enhanced MBT armor or the ability to call down vehicles away from vehicle spawn points takes more effort and has real balance implications. The stuff that people would notice and appreciate is the stuff that's more time consuming and could cause balance problems."

Planetside,3duq2l,VSWanter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:46:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah but that's just one small area, and presumably you'd not have automated phalanx turrets shooting everyone/thing out to max range, right? That'd be a bit excessive. In PS1, for instance, base turret automation was highly range-restrictive, only targeted enemy vehicles (unless they owned an Interlink facility? I forget), and they also fired more slowly than when players used the turrets. They deterred enemy vehicles from getting too close, but couldn't defend a base themselves. That wouldn't be unreasonable for PS2 stuff. Anything automated should be very weak (e.g. spitfires). But what I'm getting at is that   What I actually wanted to add was that these aren't mutually exclusive ideas. I like the idea of turret automation, of spawn timer flexibility, and these being local features tied to generators or hackable panels. I'd love to see many more features and assets that can be utilized by attackers or defenders. My only issue was that you're not going to change anything by making base ownership benefits simply be local factors like that."

Please also point out any features that would have to be added to make it better for players, such as players and their vehicles travelling through the warpgates to the other continents."
Planetside,3duq2l,frizbee2,10,Sun Jul 19 17:46:09 2015 UTC,"I believe there are fundamental problems with intercontinental lattice regarding performance for larger battles.  Having intercontinental lattice would make territory more important, and it would concentrate entire populations at more centralized fights.  Your image does not yet depict home WG.  How do you imagine this would work?  Would there be home WG at all or continuously dynamic?  What happens when a faction is pushed to be on only one or two continents and their population demands more playable space?  I believe that part of the problem with intercontinental lattice is a lack of continents.  At the very least we would need like 6 battle islands, and acceptable home continents and sanctuaries if we are to have home WGs.  I don't believe any of the current continent WGs are acceptable as a home WG, but most especially the NW WG on Esamir, which is undeniably the worst WG in the game.  Turning WGs into captuable territory I don't think would be much of a problem, but there would certainly be a problem performance wise unless battle and objectives were way spread out over the whole WG territory, and even that probably still wouldn't solve the issue."
Planetside,3duq2l,The-Magic-Sword,5,Sun Jul 19 18:04:17 2015 UTC,"I believe there are fundamental problems with intercontinental lattice regarding performance for larger battles. Having intercontinental lattice would make territory more important, and it would concentrate entire populations at more centralized fights.   Because it's not just a continental lattice problem, it's also territory mechanics that suck, there is currently no mechanics that incentivize spread troops around.  Everything is centralized on large facilities. Small outposts have nothing to offer, they're just speedbumps in the lattice. Large bases have the most connections, the biggest vehicle terminals, the Benefits, and the defenses.  Should the small fights affect the big fight and not the other way around, the dynamic would be different and population density less of a factor. Higby understood this, and this is why he has proposed Territory 2.0:  A lattice that links bigger Regions, centered around Large facilities, with freeform capture (like the Hex system). Control of outposts has a direct impact on the facility in some way, either through a logistical (air pad, MBT terminal, spawnroom) or technological (shield gen, turret power source) benefit of some sort; or even the Influence system for that matter.  This would be something like this or this"
Planetside,3duq2l,The-Magic-Sword,2,Sun Jul 19 19:44:44 2015 UTC,"I really want Territory 2.0 but I have real concerns that it would end up with the small bases basically being ignored by everyone unless they are vital for the capture of the main base - which is what we already have essentially.  I mean what benefit would small bases have that make them perfectly balanced so that not everyone goes there, but some do?"
Planetside,3duq2l,PuuperttiRuma,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:15:43 2015 UTC,"It's easy to think about meaningful benefits.  Make a list of what a big facility offers:   Hard spawn(s) MBT terminals Aircraft terminals AV/AA Turrets Base Shields Resources   Now keep in mind that not every outposts needs to have a Spawnroom, not every outpost needs to have vehicle terminals, etc... Just like PS1 had three different kind of towers, I can think of several types of outposts; some that offer attackers benefits, some that take defender assets away:   Bunker: a spawnroom, sundy terminal and AV turrets Air tower, with air terminals, airpads and AA turrets Vehicle factory, with dedicated MBT spawns Defense link, disables external turrets and shields Nanite silo, increases defenders resource cost   Note that you don't need to design new bases, those are just archetypes you can slap onto existing outposts. If that's not enough, you can extend the nanite cost increase to every outpost in the region, or even recycle the Influence system to affect the main facility only  Even if it's just two squads going for secondary outposts, it'll eventually escalate and we'll see some meaningful action going on around the larger bases. Logistical restrictions can be significant enough to consider capturing territory around the facility.   Influence really was a great system, because defenders couldn't just hole up inside their Biolab. Attackers could turn a base with a single control point if they owned surrounding territory, forcing defenders to get out and launch a counterattack. Heck you could bring back the whole fucking Hex system, cause it actually works as long as you don't have more than 30 bases per continent, unlike fucking Indar."
Planetside,3duq2l,troj7c8,2,Mon Jul 20 00:08:14 2015 UTC,"This version shows a fully dynamic system without home continents or gates of any kind.  It has real problems potentially when it comes to how to deal with the population limits of continents.  The alternative version I will make is one where each faction has two safe warp gates on separate continents, with one neutral continent in the middle.  To mix things up I would have weekly shufflings of the continents with winners announced after each weeks play."
Planetside,3duq2l,PuuperttiRuma,3,Sun Jul 19 21:13:14 2015 UTC,"any major problems that you foresee with a system like this.   Under the system you've drawn, with the warpgates looped in on themselves, It would be theoretically possible to eliminate one, and, even more theoretically possible, two, faction(s) from the map in wholecloth by backing a faction up to a single warpgate, taking the warpgate, and allowing the pain field to kill them off, leaving them nowhere to respawn. I'm not necessarily convinced that this is a bad thing, but it would certainly be unpredicated."
Planetside,3duq2l,mrsmegz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:33:04 2015 UTC,They would have to spawn at any remaining territories.  The real problem comes when they are backed onto a single continent and have more players wanting to play than that single continent can support.  Potentially you make it so that the beaten down empire simply gets a higher proportion of the population pie but that could have its own problems.
Planetside,3duq2l,mrsmegz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:17:23 2015 UTC,"They would have to spawn at any remaining territories.   Frankly, I think it's far more likely that they wouldn't have any territories available to spawn at. Firstly, under lattice, the front lines of each faction's territory ownership tend to flatten themselves out (a la Indar T), and, secondly, if one faction was  truly attempting to eliminate another, they're far more likely to leave the warpaget for last. Not only would it prevent a devestating flank of enemies halfway through your capture, but making the warpgate the final blow, as opposed to whatever bases they have left, would feel far more satisfying. In addition, you run into a bit of a problem with the ""no respawning at cutoff territories"" rule when you don't own any warpgates."
Planetside,3duq2l,PuuperttiRuma,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:34:40 2015 UTC,"That rule should be 'no spawning at territories you are not linked to', not the warp gate is not linked to."
Planetside,3duq2l,jeneleth,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:37:37 2015 UTC,"I really think that we'd nned at least double the number of our continents as well as a different, more fluent and flexible handling of the continents hardware-wise. A hard-capped population is going to cause trouble at some point, and more continents would help spreading forces.  Additionally I think that some form of Battle Island could be the solution for warpgate capture. Two warpgates are linked through a Battle Island, if one is captured, a fight on the Island occurs, and the winner gets the other warpgate. You could potentially also alter the gamemode (e.g. something like rush with dedicated defenders and attackers teams)."

It seems weird that capping certain bases would also grant you another base (the WG) at the same time. Instead, capping all territory adjacent to the two connected warpgates could just destroy the shield and the painfield, so that the battle for the warpgates is then fought inside the WG structure. The main building could be redefined into a spawroom and several capture points put into the different buildings surrounding it.  Another issue is that you´d have to make sure that every faction has at least one warpgate to spawn at at all time, so the last WG of a faction would actually be uncappable.  Last but not least, you´d have to convince DBG that a change like this is worth the efford - and I´m not even sure if it is."

Planetside,3duq2l,Scrinrusher,2,Sun Jul 19 21:11:56 2015 UTC,I think the first thing you should do is trying to figure out how it would work if half the continents are locked. I can't remember the last time I've seen all four continents unlocked on emerald.
Planetside,3duq2l,Scrinrusher,2,Sun Jul 19 18:08:10 2015 UTC,"If a faction captured all three WGs on a continent, the continent is naturally locked. To manage that the server has to be relatively empty, as usually a serious overpop is needed to achieve such a feat. So IMHO the locking isn't an issue with Intercontinental Lattice."
Planetside,3duq2l,Falnor,2,Sun Jul 19 20:26:40 2015 UTC,That is the key; empires can lock their own continents by pushing the other empires off it.  If they do not have enough population to defend then they will be pushed back however this could just be boring ghost capping sadly but there would be fights of all different sizes.
Planetside,3duq2l,Fellidae,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:19:41 2015 UTC,"i fully support this good idea . but this is lacking of continets that was in ps1 , there was finished working and self-sufficient model , which is lacking in current ps2"

WG siege should require 2 adjacent bases each WG adjacent base would have a gen   1 would have a ground gen: this would disable the sheild around the rim of the WG, but a umbrealla sheild would appear to guard the WG from air 1 would have the air gen: this would disable the top of the sheild, but would have a large sheild become generated from the WG defence towers  cap point in the centre of the WG   WG fights would be mad meatgrinder HE/Air spam. and thatd be fine, as to kick someone off a map it should be a insane last stand that makes NSA look fun.   the more hexes you own the more resource you gain on that map. so you could gain momentum to push through the WG, but getting through the nexus would be hard and breaking out of their next WG would be even harder."
Planetside,3duq2l,DeltaWidow,2,Mon Jul 20 00:53:13 2015 UTC,"Another potential problem, at least right now, is that the warpgates rotate with a continent unlock.  Continent locking would either need to be completely reworked or each faction would need a Sanctuary of sorts that would allow them to go to any owned warpgate, or something like that."
Planetside,3duq2l,frx_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:21:27 2015 UTC,Oh you'd totally scrap alerts as they are now - they were originally put in I believe simply to give you some way to lock a continent and stop fighting on it.  This system would let players do that for themselves fluidly.  You could still have alerts if really needed but I see little point with this system.
Planetside,3duq2l,Mersh21,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:26:21 2015 UTC,they were originally put in as a pseudo meta game in an attempt to make players care about taking territory
Planetside,3duq2l,tupendous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:24:04 2015 UTC,Alerts could be set up similar to the WDS system. Holding certain territory types after a certain amount of time would award points. Could also borrow from the Conquest stuff and use kills to award points as well. Locked continents won't count towards territory ownership.  Faction with the most points at the end wins and gets XP reward.
Planetside,3duq2l,tupendous,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:53:31 2015 UTC,Kills shouldn't ever be a factor - simply because it encourages farming of players and not playing the actual objective of capturing and holding territory.
Planetside,3duq2l,MasonSTL,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:39:02 2015 UTC,"You could at this point get crazy with creating sideobjectives, likes automized ants, a meteor with plenty  goods in it crashed somewhere, and so forth."
Planetside,3duq2l,boobers3,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:45:11 2015 UTC,"The main two issues I see is that there isn't a 'home warpgate', and the combination of alerts and locking becomes a problem.  I'll explain why I said there needs to be a 'home gate'. Imagine the NC own Indar on your map. Say the VS start conquering Hossin and Amerish. They push the NC off of both continents by taking their warpgates. The TR start taking Esamir, and push the NC off of Esamir by taking the NC warpgate. Now, the NC have no warpgates anywhere. They are slowly able to be whittled down by both factions. Generally, this will never happen, and would only be possible if two factions worked together or one faction had over 50% world pop for an extended period of time. I just think it's something quite important, as contingency plans must be made somehow.  Second; the combination of alerts anc continent locking is a problem. Imagine if an alert started on Esamir on your map. The NC would have to push the VS out of Indar Northgate. And they would easily be able to do this as most of the VS pop would bleed onto Esamir because of the alert. All of a sudden, the VS lose their warpgate. Two things can happen: The VS come and try and take on the NC and take their warpgate back. This allows the TR to make massive pushes. The VS can slowly get whittled down, and since the TR and NC have no chance of fighting one another, the VS get kicked off of the continent.  Now, the VS have to get back on the continent, so they start kicking the TR off of Hossin. And the cycle starts again.  TL:DR They'd have to scrap alerts in their current form for this to work (which I am all for) and technically one faction could be left with no warpgate (although this is unlikely to happen)."
Planetside,3duq2l,MachinegunPsycho,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:28:29 2015 UTC,Yeah scrap the alert system.    Did you play PS1?  Because almost 100% of the time two empires teamed up on the third.  This is a core problem with this system which has a number of solutions.  First as troj7c8 mentions you could have an empires last warpgate link be safe and not capturable so in the example image if the VS lost the Hossin - Amerish link the Indar - Esamir link would become safe from attack with big obvious UI indicators on peoples maps.  Second you could make it so that if an empire  is beaten back they get say 50% or perhaps greater population on their last continent so they should be fools to lose it.  You could even make it so that if an empire is totally wiped the maps reset or alternatively they can drop pod in anywhere and hack territories without any links needed.
Planetside,3duq2l,fatfreddy01,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:34:00 2015 UTC,"I never played PS1 but I do have some knowledge about it from hanging around with PS1 vets.  Also, how would 'cut off' territories work? Let's say that on your map the VS used to own Amerish South and Indar North. Say the NC then cut them right in half. Which territories, the North or the South ones on Indar, would be 'cut off'? Obviously you could simply say that any territory not connected to a warp gate is cut off, but theoretically the battle lines would never end up the way you've drawn it, correct?  Extra thoughts:  Do you think it would be any easier to say, 'VS home warpgate is Esamir South, TR is Indar North, and NC is Amerish NorthWest'?  Only problem with that is you'd have skewed lock bonuses and you'd need another warpgate on each of the three home continents to link to all the others..."
Planetside,3duq2l,Strottinglemon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:53:10 2015 UTC,"I'd simply have it only matter if you are not linked to a warp gate, although if the resource system ever gets completed That would be different.   Having hard gates that give each empire one home continent doesn't work because of high population, you need to have two.   Lock bonuses and all territory bonuses need a total overhaul if you ask me."
Planetside,3duq2l,fatfreddy01,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:29:41 2015 UTC,"Well they've already shown how they are going to do that.  No idea when they'll actually do it though. Pretty sure its more than 2 years since they revealed that, and it seems it hasn't been implemented yet."

Possibly also a timer would start when a faction doesn't own all three warpgate territories on continent A, which would make the warpgate in continent B act as if the SCU is destroyed (No spawns or shields)."

On the flip side you'll get better at positioning and your teammates will appreciate the res/ammo/repair/spotting support!    I'd actually suggest some time as a LA to get a nice big dose of git gud in your positioning skill, plus it can do a lot more funny shenanigans than the Default Infantry Classtm."
Planetside,3duyhb,MrIDoK,8,Sun Jul 19 19:09:02 2015 UTC,ye I believe LA is the best class to sharpen your overall combat skills. you are forced to think of flanking routes and know when to disengage or engage.

Planetside,3duyhb,Divenity,11,Sun Jul 19 22:05:56 2015 UTC,"The headshot thing just means you are overcompensating for recoil on other class' guns... You get more HS on heavy because their weapons have more recoil, and due to muscle memory you are pulling down the same amount you normally do, thus your shots more often than not land higher. So that one at least isn't HA making you bad, you just need to pay more attention to how much you are pulling down when using carbines and assault rifles, and do it less."

Yet, your own stats with the Orion don't really reflect a big change in performance, and furthermore - you still only have a 1.3 KDR with it, which means you are winning far less 1v1's than you seem to imply.  Maybe playing HA really clicked with you and you do better with it than other classes - that's fine and you should embrace and explore this side of the game more!  Personally I have always been more effective as an infiltrator, and also as a LA.  I just do much better as a flanker than a straight up gunfighter.  Use the VX6-7 if you want to play engineer and 1v1 dumpster other classes in the game."
Planetside,3duyhb,Mustarde,11,Sun Jul 19 20:30:59 2015 UTC,"I found myself to be more effective at light assault and, once I dedicated myself to it, medic than as heavy. When I play heavy, I feel less mobile and more inclined to play like a retarded bull on a rampage, but when I play LA I'm more mobile and evasive while when I play medic I'm more cautious and pay attention to positioning more. However, one thing I didn't stop doing as a light assault or medic was 1v1 heavy assaults, especially in CQC. I found myself dedicating more to a 1v1 against a heavy because with the higher DPS and accuracy of my weapons, as long as I didn't fuck up I would very likely win against the average heavy assault user. Note that this isn't the case against the top 1%, which I had to be sneakier around."
Planetside,3duyhb,stroff,13,Sun Jul 19 20:51:02 2015 UTC,"Flanking classes definitely require more finesse and positioning to do well.  If you master them, they translate into better overall gameplay, even when you go back to HA.    But in general, people know where you are as an HA and they know where to expect you from.  You might surprise a few but overall you are using the shield and LMG to muscle through lanes of fire.  With LA especially, you can dispatch so many people before they even react, and they will never really know where you came from.    But no, let's nerf the overshield /s"

Make sure your fps is always above 30fps and lock it at 30fps for the final export. Is graphics quality important to you?! Maybe you can squeeze out some extra performance by lowering some settings. Do you want to upload in 720p or 1080p?! 40k bitrate will produce huge files that will take forever to upload. On the other hand, the higher to video quality is, the better Youtube's abysmal encoder can produce acceptable results. And because PS2 is very fast paced, higher bitrate is usually better. Youtube recommends only 8k for 1080p videos, I for example upload my longer videos at 16k. Hope this helps."

I feel like everybody has that problem, but with the TRAC-5, I just hate the inaccuracy and how quickly it's spread becomes extremely unmanageable. I can't fatally hit people beyond around 45m with all 15-20 rounds, the cone becomes massively inaccurate around 12 rounds in, I have to fire in massively controlled bursts, far too many targets get away because of the heavy delay on my killtime due to accuracy constraints. All I get out of the enemy is 'lol i'm just gonna keep firing my Mercenary at you and you'll die before proper reaction is even possible kek' and it infuriates me because I don't experience the faction's weapons, and I don't want to, because the NC voiceovers are annoying and lasers are stupid, but I have to because these weapons all have to be perfectly balanced, I can't seriously have the worst starting carbine ever, of course, can I?

But if you really hate it then try T5 AMC, it's like Trac with 13% less DPS (not that big difference since you can easily counter this with higher accuracy) and with much easier recoil pattern."
Planetside,3dwhxr,CzerwonyKolorNicku,2,Mon Jul 20 10:30:09 2015 UTC,"It is pretty widely accepted that the TRAC5 is the best starting carbine, and one of the best carbines in the game.  If you really want to focus on mid/long range ADS style gameplay, get a T5-AMC, a Cougar, or even the NS11-C (beware super low muzzle velocity- this is not a long range carbine).  TRAC5 is superbly balanced; a great weapon for most situations, the only ""generalised"" carbines I prefer, across all factions are the Jaguar and the TRAC Shot: both of these are super similar to the TRAC5."

I can get 2 kills out of 2 full health enemies in a combat scenario, if other factors come into play, I can kill them will a number of bullets left in the clip that would not normally be sufficient. But it takes too long to eject the bullet to 'they're-dead' ratio, and the bullets spread too heavily for me to kill them in any state besides ADS at close range, and the problem there is that it is hard to hit people in ADS when they're just 2 to 4 knife ranges away from you.   I love the TRAC-5 to death, but the forward grip has done very little to help with inaccuracy, it's not a recoil issue, it's just straight up the spread of the bullets in comparision to how many bullets it takes to kill someone, and how long it takes to meet that bullet requirement, and how many bullets are in a clip, and the enemy and their bullet requirement/clip size/speed at which they can expend a fatal number of bullets.

I love the TRAC-5 to death, but the forward grip has done very little to help with inaccuracy, it's not a recoil issue, it's just straight up the spread of the bullets in comparision to how many bullets it takes to kill someone, and how long it takes to meet that bullet requirement, and how many bullets are in a clip, and the enemy and their bullet requirement/clip size/speed at which they can expend a fatal number of bullets.   Shorter bursts. If you're running into the brickwall that is the T-5's spread, you're bursting for far too long.  What kind of ranges are you playing at?  TR LAs, especially those using the T-5, really need to stick to CQB to have an advantage. Either exclusively fight in CQB with a laser equipped T-5 and ADAD hipfire at dem heads, or really work on your burst control to have a bit of range."

You're making the same mistake I made when I tried this: the ear flaps and the forehead piece are actually attached to the Ushanka. They're not just stuck onto the sides of the hat. Forehead piece looks puny. Needs to be wider! Earflap is too skinny. That'd be horrible to actually keep one's ear warm! The top of the hat there really needs some modelled-in cloth detail. It looks like a lump of clay with clay flaps stuck on the sides. It might take a lot of time, but seeing small semi-random changes in shadow can really boost the appeal.   Side note: this is kinda making me want to return to my own (which had the clay issue too) xD. I've gotten a lot better since then!

Planetside,3dw5qn,ddraig-au,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:29:07 2015 UTC,The color shift is bad enough when you enter TR turf on Indar and makes it borderline unplayable for me as I can't see jack shit in front of me at night time. It's like a dark sky that's suddenly dark and deep red. :(  I'd rather not have the game darker than it already is though I like the suggestion.
Planetside,3dw5qn,TurtleYo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:47:07 2015 UTC,Play on ultra with 0 gamma and you have your dark nights. Literally can't see shit. Looks great tho
Planetside,3dw5qn,Davin_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:25:26 2015 UTC,People play the game with very low quality monitors and TVs. The engine doesn't support any kind of contrasting for dark values so they scrapped darkness. It was kind of hilarious. You'd have people posting images complaining and others with color calibrated graphics monitors wondering what they were complaining about. Same thing happened in H1Z1.
Planetside,3dw5qn,Sirisian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:34:03 2015 UTC,"In other games i love Nighttime but in planetside it's just an annoyance to me meanwhile.  First of all, it is already very dark on a proper calibrated monitor. When playing during RL daytime and it's a bit bright in the room, you can't see SHIT. It hurts my eyes and i have to concentrate really hard to see things. For a long time i tried to keep the immersion a little bit and 'only' put the brightness scale to about 40, meanwhile when i enter an area where its Nighttime i dont hesitate anymore and push it straight to 100. The visibility increase is so big its ridiculous.   Secondly, it's way to frequent! That is because on most continents the circle is 50/50 afaik and if you're unfortunate you hop from one Nighttime fight to another for 1 1/2 hours straight until i wanna shut the game down.   Thridly and lastly, like in all shooters it's bad for competitive play. If you fight against someone outside of a building who has brightness set to 100 you will lose mostly because he can see 4× better then you so at some point you will put it up as well because losing isn't as much fun as winning..."

Planetside,3e0611,TheRandomnatrix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:04:35 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between challenge and tedium. Yes. I can kill tanks with my AV turret.

Those are just examples mind you, not specific gripes I have personally."
Planetside,3e0611,Nhauv,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:05:30 2015 UTC,"Side note, now that vehicles count as kills towards araxium medals does that mean they count towards directives?

Planetside,3e0611,TheRandomnatrix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:18:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, they do. A lot of players take to blowing up turrets on locked continents for directives. AV turret, max punch, valk weapons, HE/HEAT, and some lib weapons are the ones I see people admit to those most"
Planetside,3e0611,Knopty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:22:10 2015 UTC,"Yes vehicle kills count, and people use Phalanx Turrets for grinding directives, like ""Kills with a weapon"", ""Top Gun kills"", ""Rumble seat kills"". Some other directives ignore the turrets, like ""Vehicle destruction""."

Hence the name: Light Infiltrator :)  The main idea is to get lots of knife kills fast. I've tried Stalker Infiltrator, and it felt too slow-paced to me. So I figured out a way to do the same with Light Assault using smoke."

Planetside,3dtuor,xPaffDaddyx,29,Sun Jul 19 12:13:24 2015 UTC,"That's a really great example of the scythe's broken ramming box.  Your scythe had less health, and takes less half the damage."
Planetside,3dtuor,Aleph_Zed,14,Sun Jul 19 12:46:00 2015 UTC,"Because of this, on live scythes go for rams a lot more than other ESFs. I got rammed 14 times on Wednesday and every single one was a scythe, don't think a reaver even tried to do it.  Scythe: Best muzzle velocity and hitbox from in front so it's the best A2A ESF and it can ram to its heart's content."
Planetside,3dtuor,0verkillgaming,3,Sun Jul 19 14:51:04 2015 UTC,It's funny how everyone is on a crusade about the Orion while only a couple people mention the Scythe. LMGs are far more balanced than ESFs.
Planetside,3dtuor,stroff,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:37:03 2015 UTC,Because more people face the orion than a scythe. I have issues with both.
Planetside,3dtuor,TGangsti,2,Mon Jul 20 11:26:59 2015 UTC,Friggen Connery's resident KamikazeSycthe... He never fired at you while he flew directly into your ESF. Though I haven't seen him in a while.
Planetside,3dtuor,ld115,2,Sun Jul 19 17:24:35 2015 UTC,"Yup. It's the only ESF that can ram a nearly full health Lib and kill it, the Reaver and Mossie will make it spin like crazy but will do very little damage."
Planetside,3dtuor,stroff,3,Sun Jul 19 22:29:43 2015 UTC,"Actually the scythe can ram a full health gal and kill it if you hit it in the right spot. No joke, just gotta juke it so that your debris cuts off one of the galaxies wings right where the pivot point for its VTOL engines are. Same technique works on liberators it's just that you have to hit the cockpit dead on typically for it to work, and 99% of the time you glance off instead and leave the lib in a tailspin but otherwise alive. Any ESF can take out any other air vehicle with its own debris if you hit it the right way, its just that the scythe is the only one that explodes in such a manner that if your two engine pylons are both encircling an enemy vehicle anywhere, your explosion causes them to scissor and literally cut the enemy vehicle in half with surface to air damage. Very easy to pull off too"

In vehicle-to-vehicle ramming, the person who sees the ramming on their client takes full damage but the other person takes half if they see it as a miss. In this gif, the player moved upwards so the mosquito barely missed for them, but for the mosquito the vehicle was still lower and so it was a hit for them."
Planetside,3dtuor,jwapplephobia,2,Sun Jul 19 16:37:47 2015 UTC,"Regardless of how it works, it's an issue.  For example I've been killed by 638 scythe roadkills and only 300 mosquito roadkills in my main character's history."

It's quite simple; getting auraxium metals for guns that need a second, third, fourth, (etc.) seat to operate would advance this directives tree. Your progress with the Kobalts, Furies, Bulldogs, Faction specific gunner mounts (Proton PPA/Saron, Vulcan/Marauder, Enforcer/Canister), Liberator tail guns, and such others would go here.  This excludes all of the weapons the pilot seats have access to which would still be on that specific vehicle's tree. Examples of that include all of the ESFs' weapons, the Supernova-class weapons for the Magrider, Titan-class cannons for the Vanguard, the P2-120 class of dual-barrel guns for the Prowler. Liberator belly guns are the one exception to this rule because its weapons are unique to that vehicle despite needing a second seat to operate them."

Planetside,3dzme1,McKvack11,-2,Mon Jul 20 20:46:01 2015 UTC,"But if it has stupid slow muzzle velocity it will still make it very difficult to land a hit even at medium ranges. With an increased reload time and decreased rate of fire it will be useless close range still but it would make more sense to call it an anti-material rifle. Let's say this gun fires 50 cal rounds, It wouldn't really make sense for it to do less damage then a smaller calibre round. It would make it more unique of a rifle to do what I say then to keep it as a niche gun that can only effectively do 3 things, kill flashes, maxes and harass heavy vehicles. I am ok with it harassing vehicles although it would be cool if they put a spot on every vehicle that was really small so it could be used as a weak spot to do more damage with the archer. That would be pretty cool. It wouldn't be possible though to do a system like War Thunder though, too much load on servers I would think."

After that it would require 2 HS in order to drop a target regardless of range . This change would make it somewhat more viable against infantry , while still not making it better than the other Infil bolt action alternatives due to its long rechamber time."
Planetside,3dzme1,SpiroAgnewTR,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:27:54 2015 UTC,OK that makes sense. I could live with that. But I still don't get how the gun works. Is it using some kind of HEAT round to penetrate through armor but not do all that much damage.
Planetside,3dzme1,OnceIsawthisthing,4,Mon Jul 20 21:36:04 2015 UTC,Just get yourself a sniper rifle and leave the game designing to the game designers.
Planetside,3dzme1,OnceIsawthisthing,3,Mon Jul 20 22:35:18 2015 UTC,I shoot infantry all day with the archer. It's just fine.  The main role is anti-Max where it excells. It can also do damage to armor; my favorite is 2 shoting a lighting with a squad of archer engis xD
Planetside,3dzme1,Terafir,0,Mon Jul 20 20:59:11 2015 UTC,"yea that would be cool, it doesn't happen often on Miller at the moment though. Maybe it will catch on. And every Platoon will have an archer squad."

Planetside,3dzme1,zepius,0,Mon Jul 20 21:19:25 2015 UTC,I think it would be cool if it was like a cannon. Firing a HEAT projectile which explains why it damages everything but still having a low velocity.

I would say nothing above or equal to 500, in order to keep it from being a single shot knife combo to kill."
Planetside,3dzme1,TestPilotBeta,0,Mon Jul 20 20:55:28 2015 UTC,"Ok then it should nearly one shot all infantry. Or at least make it not be affected by shielding like heavy shields, nano weaving and anything else.

I just want it to be more useful for when there are no maxes around is all."

Planetside,3dzme1,FLESHPOPSICLE,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:19:02 2015 UTC,its designed to be a trade off. you can destroy maxes and light vehicles but you suck vs infantry.  stop trying to make the archer the king of engineer weapons.
Planetside,3dzme1,TestPilotBeta,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:33:54 2015 UTC,"The Archer is more of a throwback to the PS1 days, where you had standard ammo and AP ammo. AP worked well against MAXes and vehicles, but did little damage against infantry. Standard ammo worked the opposite way.  Regardless, in the same sense that we don't give the infiltrator a grappling hook because that is the LA's domain, we can't be giving other classes weapons that are as good as snipers and letting them intrude upon that domain.  Can an Archer be used as a countersniper? Yes. A terrible one though, and that's the way it's meant to be. An effective sniper is a designated sniper rifle, put on the sniper class. You can't take a class that uses close-medium range carbines and give it a weapon that can one shot headshot kill from 300 meters."

Planetside,3dwx05,Loudanddeadly,5,Mon Jul 20 05:23:49 2015 UTC,"The amount of bullshit in this thread is alarming.  First off, the Inquisitor and the T4 AMP are both garbage, steer clear of them. The Inquisitor has extremely bad effective DPS due to requiring an inhumane trigger finger. 9 times per second is insane, there are websites where you can see how many times you can click per second if you want to test it. The Emperor is always better than the Inquisitor. The T4 AMP has an effective range of about 5m and has a very, very small DPM that will often get you killed, the Repeater is always better than the T4 AMP.  The NS Pistols are both solid choices. Both do require some trigger discipline though, considering they have a lot of bloom, especially on hipfire. They also don't have access to a suppressor which is definitely a problem for stalkers. The Repeater is a very good choice, although it lacks in the range department (certainly not as much as the AMP however). If you want something suppressed like the Repeater but with much better effective range, go with the Emperor. It has the 167 damage model up close which lets you kill people with three headshots, at the price of some DPS compared to the Repeater. It's also a semi-auto but unlike with the Inquisitor, humans can reach its effective RPM."

Personally, i find crossbow being better at sniping for stalker infil than blackhand  AMP: equip it if you want to go full CQC with knife. This is actually the greatest ""weapon of last resort"" in game, because you can outgun even heavy with shield, if he found you. The drawback - you can't shoot anything distant. And by distance i mean knife distance.  Repeater: Same as AMP, but better at range  Emperor: If you are good at aiming and want to kill from low-medium range  Inquisitor just sucks, and i find other NS pistols not fitting the role of stalker, which is quiet killer (except for blackhand)"

Planetside,3dwx05,FuzzBuket,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:06:48 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with Kofilin.  3 main ones to use: TX2 Emperor TX1 Repeater NS Commissioner or Underboss  Emperor: Silenced with Darklight is great.  You can find cloaked infils trying to play hide and seek and the damage model is good.  Not as high damage as other faction pistols but with a fire rate that's forgiving for misses.  I like it a lot.  Repeater: Silenced with Laser Sight.  Tap tap tap dead.  This thing is like a mini smg.  NS Commissioner or Underboss: Up to you which one but both are good.  Great power and better range than most TR pistols.  Just beware that going from either back to TR pistols or vice versa will be weird at first because you'll try to take measured shots (a la NS) or dakka dakka (a la TR)  AMP: no range and piddling magazine.  It's possible to use it but you better aim well and use it at close close range cause if you don't you're fucked.  Inquisitor: ....See I like it but wouldn't suggest it.  Low damage and like has been said before, insanely high clicking necessary on your part to get the full potential out of the weapon makes it tough to be competitive with."

Planetside,3dwx05,Plastikfrosch,2,Mon Jul 20 05:31:19 2015 UTC,repeater is the best default pistol and one of the best choices for the stalker. its the only ES sidearm that can compete with the NS revolvers when it comes to ttk and its possible to put a silencer on it. the inquisitor is another very good choice (if you have a fast trigger finger) because of the 143/30 damage profile. there is no other pistol with such a high damage per mag in the game and because of the big magazine it will not hurt to miss a few shots and its the only pistol where i nearly never aim downsight so it gives also a speed advantage. Emperor is ......reliable but not as good as repeater and inquisitor.

PS2 is my favorite game due to its unique factions, combined arms gameplay and huge continents. but once a similar game with more ""realistic"" art style arrives, i will be gone. that said, i have always dreamed of a Battlefield game with authentic armies/equipment and maps as huge as Planetside's. sadly, it doesnt look like something similar is in the works right now."

By getting a thousand kills with five different LMGs, a VS can unlock the Betelgeuse, which is an Orion that uses a heat mechanic instead of the usual battery pack, letting it fire indefinitely as long as the user controls their bursts- and it also cools off when you're using your sidearm/rocket launcher/utility slot.

Planetside,3dswqf,Khall95,18,Sun Jul 19 03:34:33 2015 UTC,"For the most part I completely agree, while my experience with valks lies mostly within the transport aspect, where I feel the valk absolutely excels, I have been flying more and more battle-valks recently to work on the directives.  I personally think a pilot should be able to cert the valk for two completely different roles, transport and CAS. Transport as it is right now needs little change other than making squad spawn passive, other than that I'd say it's pretty much perfect. A slight speed boost would be nice too, currently I can manage to push the valk to 205 for short bursts, but maintain an average speed of 195. Increasing that by 10-15kph would be rather nice but is definitely not necessary. Survivabilty-wise I have absolutely no problems, evasiveness is fantastic at keeping you alive in even the biggest of cluster-fucks. Dodging dumbfires and ducking out of sight of bursters and lock-ons while dropping a point remains one of the biggest thrills in the game for me and I wouldn't trade it for the world (although I have the feeling some of my outfitmates would)  CAS is sadly where the valkyrie falls laughably short, hover frame is useless because the valk simply won't survive long without it's evasive prowess. Personally I'd even out the PTS changes so that bottom armour is at 40% (75% for composite) and side armour at 20% (45% for composite). This change alone would actually give composite armour a use and allow valks to function as CAS, with a few buffs to the CAS-14 and pelters of course.   I would even go so far as to make hover frame force the valk into hover-mode indefinately, with a large speed increase of course so it would be able to maintain about 120kph. Give it incredibly powerful vertical and downward thrust and some manoeverability boosts (not as much as evasiveness though), as well as even greater deceleration and yaw and you'd have what is functionally a very different vehicle that'd be able to perform CAS brilliantly as well as functioning as a short range transport. It'd certainly be interesting to fly.   Rumble seats need roll stabilisation. There was a bug a while ago that meant rumble seat passengers were always upright. Naturally this was a bit disorientating when the valk was upside down, but you could actually aim at stuff. Obviously, I don't want that back, just want my aim not affected by rolling.   I'd love some version of that bug back, as long as they fix the horribly misalligned aiming problems. (that was a fun weekend to work on rumble seat kills)."

Planetside,3dswqf,Seukonnen,3,Sun Jul 19 04:43:34 2015 UTC,"My experiences in a valk are somewhat different I guess. In my 4 days, 17 hours total time of flying the valk, Ive had very little luck with the Wyvern, but great luck with the CAS-14, VLG and Pelters. The hellion is hit and miss with most gunners. They either have no idea how to use it or we dont find suitable targets, its not bad, I just never get a chance to make it shine unless im solo valking.  Which is what I mostly do. I run maxed scout radar, stealth, and hover frame. For me, evasive frame doesnt do anything worth using over hover, and my personal flying style matches with the controls of the hover alot better.  Unlike what Im seeing from you guys who actually get gunners, most of the time, I dont have any one to gun for me. Even in full squads, with squad spawn, I only get gunners...when I dont need nor want gunners. I wish I could actually REMOVE the gun from valk altogether for something else, something functional, like a spotlight or something, because I rarely, if ever, use the valk as a gunship.  Almost all my Valk kills are from roadkills. Infact, Im quickly catching up to Seb for the #1 spot game-wide for roadkills in it. I just dont see the valk as a gunship, so I almost never use it as one. This isnt to say it cant do damage, when I bother to actually do gun-runs, I can do good work, but I much prefer using the valk for recon, logistics and other behind the lines work. I might not get as much kills, but a scout valk in an amp station hangar can really help.  I think the 75% armor buff coming is a bit too much because it would almost remove all risk from smushing people, aside from the ground impacts, and that wouldnt really be fair.  I think the valk needs more utility and gadgets for support roles. Beefing the guns is fun and all, but I see a better place for the valk supporting troops and armor.   Of the list of things I'd want to see for the valk:  -Pilot ""weapon"": Anything really, just so I can equip a damn optic. I'd be content with a smoke grenade launcher.  -Gunner: Darklight Spotlight: To give people less incentive to camp in my gun slot instead of jumping out, while also providing a unique and useful role.  -Squad spawn default: I often feel conflicted when running scout radar because while its useful for everyone, it almost feels like Im letting my squad down, if this was default, then I could be useful for my squad AND empire. This would also free up additional room for more equipment  -More equipment choices: For utility slots, being able to for example, drop (3?) deployable ammo crates, or spawn a (1) flash, or some other, unique logistical tools. For defensive slot, passenger bubble shields and triage bays, and afterburners would give me more options than just running stealth or armor, and would give more interesting combos for the valk.  I would love to work towards auraxium for the valk, but I would have to change my entire thought process of ""logistical support transport"" to gunship to do it, so I doubt Ill be getting anywhere with that any time soon. Enough rambling though..."
Planetside,3dswqf,BurntDevil,6,Sun Jul 19 11:47:14 2015 UTC,"First of all: Khall you are my god.  This is exactly what I wrote a few days ago. I didn't auraxium anything but I spend A LOT of time in the Valkyrie.   Engineer repair must be changed because 4 Engineers repairing make the vehicle almost unkillable, but without repair the Valkyrie is extremely fragile. This vehicle depends too much on the crew composition, no discussion. If you carry a random squad including Medics, Infiltrators, Light Assault or HA without lock on rocket launchers, then you are basically handicapping yourself and giving the enemy free easy kills. The Valkyrie takes too much damage from ESF. Bburness can make all the changes he wants but as long as a Valkyrie can be 2-clipped by the most common ESF weapons this vehicle will always remain unpopular. Hover Frame is completely sub-optimal: there is no reason to include it in the loadout in the place of Evasive Frame. Without the Agility boost coming from Evasive Frame it's impossible to dodge incoming hits and escape from ESF: they start shooting your tail and you simply cannot turn fast enough to make the gunner counterfire.  Flying without Squad Logistic System is frustrating: if the pilot doesn't make it to land in time everyone dies tragically. On live server players can still get multiple kills by shooting a Valkyrie a few shots with a carbine. A few days ago I killed both gunner and pilot with 3 shots of Trac5-burst. There is still no single reason to spawn Valkyries instead of a Galaxy.  The belly armor does not protect from all shots coming from below, tail and nose of the Valkyrie seem to be uncovered. At the same time this additional feature does not protect against the 1st treat: ESF.   Personally the only change I would to weapons is to give them a 360° turning radius. That would suddely make them very effective. I mean... even a Flash passenger can shoot in every direction, why does the turret of the Valkyrie has to be locked in a certain position?"
Planetside,3dswqf,OldMaster80,0,Sun Jul 19 05:49:25 2015 UTC,"Personally the only change I would to weapons is to give them a 360° turning radius. That would suddely make them very effective.   Are you sure though that you wouldn't change damage profiles for weapons?. Granted with further buffs to survivability even pelters can become sort of passable but half of the valkyrie arsenal is lackluster to say the least.  VLG is awesome to use but lacks acceleration/velocity to a point where it becomes useless in actual combat. Our guys auraxiumed it by parking the valk over infantry fights somewhere in cover and picking off clueless meatwalkers one by one with only the valk nose sticking out of cover. Well for the most part at least.  Pelters need to have at least 18-20 missiles per magazine to become decent in AV role without any nerfs to reload speed either. The overal ammo capacity likewise needs to be increased at least two fold. As they are right now they are literary the worst vehicle weapon in the game.  Helion has way to long of a spin up time and low for it's type of weapon damage profile. The Valkyrie is extremely vulnerable to ground fire and for such a close encounters of the kek type weapon as Helion the damage should be frontloaded more. So that the valkyrie can come in fast, one clip or at least do massive damage in very short pass and leave for an extended reload period. I guess vulcan would fit. We need a valk vulcan."
Planetside,3dswqf,RetOld,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:40:25 2015 UTC,"Well I'm not sure weapons are perfect they way they are. But some are actually quite ok: Wyvern and Hellion for instance do exactly what they are supposed to do.  I would change the turning radius because 80% of times I do not die to ground troops, but I get killed by ESF. Composite Armor + Fire Suppression grants a decent protection against firearms and if this belly armor goes live it will be even better.  But I don't think this is enough: a Valkyrie that can resist tons of G2A damage but still gets 2-clipped by ESF will never be a success. I'm trying to fly Hover Frame on live and I've tested a lot on PTS and I can just cofirm everything Khall95 wrote: it's just too slow to outmaneuver ESF. I simply cannot get them away from my tail so I can just wait until I die, or bail out. 2 clips of Vortek Rotary and the Valkyrie is gone.  Making the gunner able to fire BEHIND the Valkyrie would make things slightly better."
Planetside,3dswqf,OldMaster80,0,Sun Jul 19 19:35:05 2015 UTC,"Me and Khall spend around 45-50% of time fighting ESF with pelters of all things on our road to auraxium and i've never felt that valk lacked in maneuverability. Posted a small video of it in this thread.  On the contrary with evasive against an ESF it's an extremely potent aircraft because you can maneuver as you wish without loosing DPS advantage since the gunner keeps on target almost regardless of what you do. Very few pilot actually realise the threat that valk poses to them and very few valk pilots know that they need to stay very close and maneuver like crazy to achieve success. A many ESF lost because they got wyvern one clipped in CQC.  The moment someone starts shooting you do an analog point turn, bind it to your mouse or something. By the time they've got 1/3 of clip into you you're already facing them and within 100 meters usuallyor they're already past you which gives you both breathing space, time to do severe damage and close in faster on them than they're able to do a reverse back at you. The closer you are the more pilot has to maneuver to fix his aim and keep on target while your gunner only needs to point and hold mouse one while you're busy with maneuvers. Granted i'm oversimplifying things but valkyrie is extremely potent in air combat with wyvern, composite and fire sup even with two people.  Add a full valkyrie and you can go against couple of ace pilots without breaking a sweat. Add two valkyries with 6 people and i wish i had the recordings still but my HDD decided to die before i could make a video. It was us fly into a group of 8 and massacre every single one of them by just forcing people of each others tail and keeping it very close and personal.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2K2lI7Axos Us fighting against RihnoSRB on his alt.  https://youtu.be/K8acKen-P8Q?t=691 Don't mind the chit chat, the whole video is about one of our crazy germans telling stories if you can call them that but the footage is solid valk combat."
Planetside,3dswqf,RetOld,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:23:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying the Valkyrie lacks maneuvrability in general: it lacks maneuvrability with Hover Frame, which is what also Khall wrote in the initial message. With Evasive Frame you can outmanuever ESF. But with Hover Frame you simply can't turn quickly enough: by the time you managed to have the enemy in firing angle you're already burning. That's why I say 360° turning radius for the turret would be a nice change.   But Hover Frame is still not a good choice. The best benefit of Hover Frame is you can stay perfectly immobile in the air without losing height. Which is a suicide for such a fragile vehicle.  Your first vehicle shows exactly what's the problem with the Valkyrie: it's a great vehicle, as long as you have Engineers and maybe a HA with rocket launchers. And according to your speed I bet you have Evasive Frame. That's the condition to make this vehicle rock but let's be honest, that's the only loadout and combination that makes it effective.  Try to fly with Auto Repair, Hover Frame, Scout Radar, and carry Infiltrators and Medics. What would you manage to do?  The problem is this vehicle is so fragile it completely depends on the crew and Evasive Frame to surivive. As long as it remains like this it will never be a valid alternative to the Galaxy. The Galaxy is superior from any point of view, in particular because it's always effective regardless the mix of classes you're carrying."

Take all the A/G weapons from the valk, give them to the ESF.   The Valk is a big, slow, shitty target, and it requires two people to operate. It deserves the heavier weapons. The ESF is a one-man cowboy killmobile. It doesn't deserve anything."
Planetside,3dswqf,MrUnimport,2,Sun Jul 19 09:44:29 2015 UTC,"The fact is the Valkyrie is not meant to be an A2G farmer. It's mainly meant to quickly relocate soldiers on the battlefield while providing CAS and being a flying platform for infantry combat. But it cannot fulfill this role because it's not fast, resistent and agile (with Hover Frame) enough.  The top issue still remains the same: the Valkyrie is too fragile. It doesn't survive enough to have a significant effect on the battle. Unless you have a full crew of Engineers."
Planetside,3dswqf,OldMaster80,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:34:38 2015 UTC,"The Valk's extreme fragility is precisely what allows it to carry A2G farmcannons, IMO. There is still no real need to transport four soldiers anywhere in this game."
Planetside,3dswqf,MrUnimport,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:00:50 2015 UTC,"Lol if great A2G farming weapons should be balanced by fragility then we have a problem called Liberator =P  Seriously, the need to transport people does exist. But the fact is it is still much better to use one single Galaxy than spawning 2 Valkyries. Valkyries should be an alternative to the Galaxy, and today they are not. Because Galaxies are more resistent, they have good weapons covering almost every angle of the vehicle, Squad Logistic System is built in, and they fly more or less at the same speed as a Valkyrie.   Bburness must realize that the Valkyrie has to be designed to compete with Galaxies. As long as it remains made of paper it doesn't make any sense. No one wants to be passenger in a vehicle that can be exploded in 5 seconds by the first ESF passing by and doesn't get any chance to survive because maybe the pilot didn't fit Squad Logistic System."

Planetside,3dswqf,9xInfinity,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:14:22 2015 UTC,The cumulative effect of rumble seat repairing needs to be reduced. You can't balance both a 2/6 valk and a nigh unkillable 6/6 valk. Make multiple engies give diminishing returns.   This is the first thing that needs to happen before any meaningful balancing can actually start.
Planetside,3dswqf,ManeiDomini,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:25:24 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with the bit about how the valkyrie needs to be balanced and useful as a combat vehicle with 2/6 passengers.

Planetside,3dswqf,ManeiDomini,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:37:47 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything here. I've been flying battle Valk a lot recently and am absolutely loving it. Such a fun vehicle to fly!  I'll take what you've said into account as I fly, but I wanted to ask something. How good is Composite actually? I'm running Auto Repair now, because I wasn't sure if Composite really helped. Is it worth it or should i stick to Auto Repair?  I think it would be cool if the pilot had a gun too, like a Liberator. Dunno if it would help much but it would make flying a Valk even more fun!"
Planetside,3dswqf,NATESOR,2,Sun Jul 19 14:01:24 2015 UTC,"Composite increases your resistance to flak and the valkyrie's worst enemy: Basilisks. I really recommend taking composite for most scenarios.  I don't use autorep for 3 reasons, small arms fire resets the cooldown, it only takes a second to quickly land and repair major damage, and for minor damage you have a built in autorep in the form of your gunner, who should be rumble repairing if he's not gunning."

Planetside,3dswqf,Fawksyyy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:01:16 2015 UTC,"I agree on the resistance value changes and the diminishing returns on multiple Engineers, as well as the rumble seat roll stabilization.  Default SLS would be an instant boon, and has been asked for time and time again. If the devs do finally get around to adding it, having the slot open will immediately boost the Valk's versatility by a lot.  I approve of having a front armor buff along with the bottom armor buff - it gives the Valk a bit more durability in skirmish situations. I would, however, also buff the side armor the same or slightly less than the front armor, to give protection when the Valkyrie's angled 45 degrees and moving sideways to strafe a target (something I know I do A LOT.)  I HEAVILY approve of better acceleration/deceleration in Hover mode - this would give it a really noticeable role. 190 kmph with vertical thrust should be the stock speed, and evasiveness should boost it to something like 215. I imagine the Valkyrie as a sort of airborne Harasser - get in, wreck faces, get out before you get blown up.  Additionally, I had another idea relevant to hover frame: Allow maxed hover to stay in place without a pilot if there is still someone in the vehicle. This would allow you to repair your vehicle or snipe people in midair, providing a neat extra bonus to max rank hover."

They're certainly above average, but the majority of JUGA's top end have either moved on to other outfits or quit the game entirely. Their strength stems from their coordination and calls, not from their aiming ability.   To quote keilos:   JUGA are killable, but when you get one of them, 5 medics with TAR's come around the corner to rez him and kill you   The only reason to ever accept a rez is either it's too hard to reposition, or you can't be bothered to. When you respawn, you get a resupply of consumables, ammo, and the opportunity to come in from a fresh angle. If you accept a rez, you run the risk of just being gunned down for no benefit unless you're in a really good spot - however if you died you probably aren't"

Planetside,3du6up,Rifter7,3,Sun Jul 19 14:44:01 2015 UTC,"In addition to the excellent suggestions by /u/VSWanter, you can also use many class abilities to complement your loadout.   Going dual fury and need an AA deterrent? Drive as a HA with a G2A equipped. To defend against C4 fairies and pizza delivery, play as infiltrator and plant a motion spotter nearby. If you have loads of spare certs to throw away, cert up triage and sit in the sunderer to continually heal everyone (including maxes) within 20m of the sunderer. Combine with a shield bubble (the medic one) for maximum protection. As an engineer, place a spitfire turret nearby as an early warning against C4 fairies and pizza delivery. Keep in mind that while the deployment shield is better than blockade armor against burst damage, blockade armor is better overall if you're babysitting your sunderer repairing it and can spot pizza deliverers before they do their thing."
Planetside,3du6up,obuw,2,Sun Jul 19 16:48:20 2015 UTC,"Very good points about class selection as a driver. I usually start out as an engineer, but switch to infil once I park so I can put out a dildar so I can babysit my spawn. I can always switch back if I need too."

I like to have what looks like an easy target Sunderer bait Air and then have Burster Maxes and lock on HA pop out.  This also works with Gals if you have a good pilot, and it works against most small ground groups with AV as well.  Driver having EOD is a must, not that it always works properly."
Planetside,3du6up,VSWanter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:59:40 2015 UTC,"Walker > Ranger but both AA should have zoom over thermals or NV.  Furies > Bulldogs because the Sunderer Bulldogs were nerfed back when the galaxy and lib bulldogs were.  Thermals or zoom depending on your taste and where you will be fighting.  Outside I prefer zoom, but inside I prefer thermal.  Proximity ammo and repair are great to support other friendly vehicles and also work on aircraft.  These usually are not the best front line spawns and make better reserve spawns for when the front lines go down.  Blockade armor is what all the battle buses use.  If you want to be killing the stuff, then this is your best option to stay alive longer.  This is also the best if you want to block capture point from spawn room while attacking.  Deployment shield will allow you to survive the best for an AMS and will eliminate most single dudes trying to kill it, and force a team attack.  Deployment shield is the best choice if you want to provide the sweet spot spawns.  Mine guard is recommended on any vehicle you plan to pull where the spawn pad might be mined.  It is also very useful when crashing through shields at Tech Plants and Amp Stations.  Racer vs Rival is a matter of taste.  If you want to get there fast then racer, but if you want to fight and maneuver then rival.  I think rival makes it slightly easier to Sunderer Parkour up steps and into interesting places, but Racer makes it easier to climb hills with momentum."
Planetside,3du6up,VSWanter,2,Sun Jul 19 15:17:09 2015 UTC,"I'd just like to make a note that vehicle mine guard also blocks C4 damage (from any direction) and has worked this way on all vehicles for a while. Also, the Sunderer currently has a cloaking option (while deployed with a deploy shield) on test right now, if your sunderer has max rank stealth. This could very soon MASSIVELY change the dynamic of how sunderers are used in the future."

Planetside,3du6up,VSWanter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:19:56 2015 UTC,"It depends on the situation for me.  I usually like to always have at least one Fury, unless I know I'm going to be sitting somewhere only doing AA, like the cliffs above Broken Arch.  Usually I keep a fury and a walker so that I can switch to whichever I need if I don't have a gunner.  If there are gunners though, then I will usually switch the walker to another fury, a basilisk, or a kobolt.  I also don't use AA when I plan to be inside, and will most often use the kobolt.  I also didn't mention that kobolts are the best AI weaponry especially if you are parking a battle bus directly between capture point and the spawn room.  I like zoom for the kobolt personally, but others prefer thermal."
Planetside,3du6up,VSWanter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:26:48 2015 UTC,"okay, i was going to use a kobalt on the front.  should i use two kobalts in any situation?  i'm also making a mental note to use only walkers, kobalts and furys.  i also always run from tanks and try to avoid getting into too much shit. i tend to jump out and run when things go south and hide in the bushes with a light assault or infiltrator."
Planetside,3du6up,VSWanter,2,Sun Jul 19 15:28:11 2015 UTC,"Remember that the starter Basalisks are the most versatile.  If you don't know what you will be facing then having one of these can be of benefit.  When players get into your vehicle the front gun will be where they go, and many players don't realize they can use the function keys to switch seats.  Make sure the gun you want manned the most is in the front.  I also noticed you said you don't spawn into others' Sunderers.  You should.  They need the gunner, and it's a good way for you to get the directive gunner kills.  Players in this game don't gun for drivers/pilots enough.  Two kobalts are good for indoor point holds, but you will not be able to kill armor.  Many bases defenders can place a defensive AMS directly on the capture point, and these are often duel kobalts."

I usually use this one as my front line spawn and try to pace it as close to the capture point as the NDZ will allow, while being on the opposite side of the spawn so my guys don't have to run past enemies to get to point.  2) My armor support build is usually proximity ammo, or repair with the same Fury/Walker config.  I usually use fire sup with this one because it doesn't often need to go through shields.  I try to avoid deploying these too close to the front, and instead look for vehicles to symbiotically support.  3) Battle Bus is mainly used for combat and will always have a gunner crew.  Double furies both with zoom, and rival combat for maneuvering.  Usually GSD so I can play with enemies by shield walls and go where I want, but Fire Sup will give that extra health and keep you alive longer;  It's a tough choice.  4) Point defender is any AMS I place defensively on a capture point, or in a place I know enemies are going to try to put their own AMS.  Always the deployment shield so that one random ghost caper can't take you out.  Fury and Kobalt or double Kobalts.  Thermals are usually better for indoor work.  Rival will let you get into position better than racer will.  Fire sup, as GSD serves no use here.  5) Gate crasher is any Sunderer I use to breach an AMP station, or a Tech Plant.  I don't intent do deploy these as they will be inside the NDZ, but any of my squad members will be able to use it as a squad spawn as long as they die within 600m.  GSD is a must, and Mine guard is usually the best for front line.  Followup should have Blockade if there are more than one crashing in.  Weaponry always includes at least one Fury and no AA, the second weapon is optional as long as it isn't AA.  Load up the Sundy with Maxes, at least one infiltrator for hacking, and some supporting infantry before the crash.  Once you are inside have your passengers sans gunners hop out and get to point without ever having to take down the shield generators.  After the GSD wears off, park your vehicle right up against the shield wall so that infantry stuck outside can get inside.  Even though there is a shield wall blocking, infantry can enter a vehicle through them, and then when they exit they have glitched inside the shield."

It's really not though, because Planetside is one of those rare games where you can plan for anything and still be surprised/ROFLstomped with no warning.  You've said elsewhere that you usually avoid getting into fights while driving, so that does narrow down things a bit.  You could give vehicle stealth a try, especially since it's supposed to be getting a deployable cloak added to it at some point I think. Not showing up on radar may be exactly what you need.  For convenience, HERE is a link to the wiki's info on the sunderer."
Planetside,3du6up,ComeOnYouApes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:58:47 2015 UTC,"Dual Kobalts is only useful if you want to farm Infantry at some range.  One can also make a point to using dual Basilisk when fighting armor at range, Furies are better otherwise."
Planetside,3du6up,VSWanter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:34:11 2015 UTC,"should i use two kobalts in any situation?   I would only use one, and either keep a basilisk or get a fury. If you have two kobalts and come across any armor on the way to where you are going your gunners wont be able to do anything about it unless they bail and use infantry based AV.   i'm also making a mental note to use only walkers, kobalts and furys   Of the three the fury is the hardest to use at range (especially on the move), so keep that in mind. Some players are wizards with them but it seems like the majority of the gunners I had over the 2 years I've been playing can't hit the broad side of a barn with one. Hence why I usually just use the basilisk."
Planetside,3du6up,ComeOnYouApes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:50:36 2015 UTC,"As long as the goal isn't to deal with aircraft, I prefer to keep the default basilisks. They don't have the close range killing power of the fury vs armor, but are much easier to aim and have a reasonably long effective range (a miss with a basilisk bullet isn't nearly as punishing as a miss with the fury). Having 2 gunners firing basilisks at the same target will rek them in short order. I'd use the certs you save from keeping them to upgrade the ammo capacity/reload speed and give them a 1.25x or 1.5x zoom. The kobalt is pretty good vs infantry, but you give up a lot since it doesn't damage armor at all. The bulldog has the same problems as the fury, just that it is more meant to kill infantry than armor.  For AA the walker is king. I would still keep one basilisk though, unless you are in the middle of a big armor convoy.  If I'm running a support bus, I usually use the ammo dispenser over the repair module, since I usually only see repair buses running around. I use the Deployment shield the most though. Sometimes I'll use blockade if I'm having trouble keeping the sunderer alive long enough to get to where I want to deploy, or if I'm in the mood for tank hunting.  I prefer the tighter turning radius of rival over the speed boost of racer. It makes it a lot easier to get into tight spaces, and you can use it to dodge shots at longer range since you turn so much faster (duck and weave).   edit: i do not fight with the sunderer. as soon as i see tanks i run. i will stop the car to shoot at infantry, though.   Let people ride with you to gun. The sunderer is mucho powerful if you have gunners."
Planetside,3du6up,BCKrogoth,2,Sun Jul 19 16:40:13 2015 UTC,"Let people ride with you to gun. The sunderer is mucho powerful if you have gunners.   This right here, or gun for others.  Squad spawning gunners is one of the most OP things in the game, but so few use it.  Even with the 600m restriction, because of redeploy hop you can always get there, and should be fighting with your group anyway."
Planetside,3du6up,SpaceHippoDE,2,Sun Jul 19 16:51:34 2015 UTC,Squad spawning gunners is one of the most OP things in the game   It really can be. Especially if they are spawning in as AV heavies and engineers so they can bail as more potential gunners spawn in. One 3/12 Sunderer can very quickly become a 3/12 + 9 AV ground pounders if everyone in a squad is on the same page.
Planetside,3du6up,Mario-C,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:06:30 2015 UTC,I'd use the certs you save from keeping them to upgrade the ammo capacity/reload speed and give them a 1.25x or 1.5x zoom   always ammo capacity. DPS over 2+ mags are nearly equal between the two but ammo lets you put more damage downfield earlier
Planetside,3du6up,VSWanter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:54:48 2015 UTC,"Double Kobalt D:  I wouldn't use 2 flaks, they have a limited angle, can't shoot ground targets with it most of the time. I recommend 1 flak in the back and another gun of your choice in the front (I wouldn't take the Kobalt, but it's your decision. Basilisk, Fury are good.)."
Planetside,3du6up,Diesl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:48:19 2015 UTC,"I once planned to become the air wrecker of the server and got a double walker (walker>ranger btw) sunderer. Was great in theory and once you get an ESF focused with both guns it's a gonna get rekt but in practival use it's too situational imo...i always end up in a situation where i need a gun for ground...I rarely use it at all, really a waste of cash for me. Btw there is not really a zoom needed for walkers imo...some ppl like thermals mainly for spotting.   When i go aggressive (BattleBus) i usually do double furies or sometimes double basilisks (all with thermals). If i do ammo or repair support or regular deployment i usually mix up depending on the battle. Kobalt+Walker can be very cool for a deployed sundy or generally a walker on the back with a second gun of your choice. The only thing i personally don't like is a single basilisk, imo it only shines when doubled."
Planetside,3du6up,Faxon,2,Sun Jul 19 16:56:25 2015 UTC,"My favorite time with double walkers required a bit of setup, but was pretty worth it.  It was before the proxy repair and ammo Galaxy update, but we got an AMS deployed on top of the skybridge on, i think it was Tawrich Tech plant.  We drove it off the bridge by Scared mesa onto a Gal and then flew it there.  Was also before deployment shield, but not before proximity repair on the sundy.  The neat part was more the AMS up their and the proxy repair on the turrets than the double walkers, but both ran out of ammo.  The enemy finally destroyed it before we could fly the Ammo dispenser up there.  We also got one on top of douche bag mountain, but that one didn't last long.  There's some neat places you can get them on Amerish and Hossin too.  I haven't played with this much recently though, and will have to revisit it once the stealth module arrives.  Perhaps as part of my outfits shenanigans we can introduce Gal vehicle carrying competitions or something.  I miss driving over Gal bridges from early release/beta, and while I understand why they needed to nerf that fun, it is much more difficult to do now, but not impossible."

Planetside,3du6up,WarOtter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:57:26 2015 UTC,Walker definitely needs the zoom. It has a 1KM/s velocity and can engage targets farther out than any other vehicle based weapon in the game with perfect accuracy. I use a 2.5 or 3x zoom on it regularly because it's just so capable of continuing to pelt on your target if you can keep yourself on target. more than half my kills with it have been outside the range at which tracers stop rendering in 1x mode. Put it on the back of a lib and you will be able to keep swarms and swarms of ESFs at bay if you've got a competent pilot and underbelly gunner.
Planetside,3du6up,trit0Ch,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:33:26 2015 UTC,"I run multiple sunderers variants, but all of them run dual Furies or dual Walkers.  For point whoring as an AMS, the deploy shield is by the far the best. You're more durable than a Blockade Sunderer and don't have to babysit it to repair minor damage every time some jackass plinks at it with a Basilisk.  Battlebuses always have Blockade and Furies, but sometimes I swap out a Fury for a Kobalt for a laugh."

Planetside,3dspqg,Alien51,3,Sun Jul 19 10:58:30 2015 UTC,Thermal kobalt is amazing. Much easier to notice targets and i just snap to their heads and shoot(not aimbot). 1 second debating if it is a person could be the death of me.
Planetside,3dspqg,Geshman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:05:56 2015 UTC,"Easier to notice, not easier to kill.  Also Kobalts can easily kill targets past the range that Thermals can see. So why inhibit yourself?"
Planetside,3dspqg,Steelering,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:06:08 2015 UTC,Quite often you can simply q spot an enemy and use that to find them instead of using your thermals. You aren't locked to using your thermals so you can just kill them with no zoom.
Planetside,3dspqg,Alien51,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:53:47 2015 UTC,"kobalt is understandable, it has some range but its really not much beyond a 1.5x; I've found that I can't aim well at a target without zoom I'm  not going to reliably take it down anyway because the random spread of bullets will miss too much and the target will just bail for cover before he dies, and thus the vastly superior awareness afforded from thermals has its place for acquiring targets out of the visual noise."
Planetside,3dspqg,Steelering,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:45:12 2015 UTC,"Totally disagree.  Zoom is needed to take down targets reliably past 100m. Or I suppose you could just lower your sensitivity, but that has it's own drawbacks."
Planetside,3dspqg,Alien51,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:57:20 2015 UTC,"I'd argue if you're relying on zoom to improve control at range that its probably time to reign in your sensitivity settings and/or get a mouse that can toggle between different settings.  I can take down targets just fine beyond the range of thermals with my setup, and I almost never I find myself wishing I had equipped a ranged optic, because I know even in those situations I'm not going to be scoring many more kills because targets will just move before you can finish them off at ranges beyond ~150m, the kobalt is just too inaccurate without treating it like a semi auto weapon."
Planetside,3dspqg,Steelering,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:08:30 2015 UTC,Killing Infantry is chaotic. The amount of times you'd have to switch sensitivities would be too high. Literally targeting and killing 3 guys within 1 sec wouldn't be possible.

And if killing infantry is so chaotic you're not going to have to worry about trying to engage targets that are 100+m away because you're going to be focusing on the ones that are close, and thermals will help you out far more than zoom in such instances"
Planetside,3dspqg,Steelering,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:38:15 2015 UTC,I was trying to explain the need to switch rapidly between 100m shots and targets with 20m.  If I turned my sensitivity down I couldn't traverse fast enough to other targets.
Planetside,3dspqg,Alien51,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:43:53 2015 UTC,"sure you could, I can do it  and even if you didn't want to change to a single setting there are options where you can change your sensitivity while holding a button down and then when you release it the sensitivity goes back to normal  relying on zoom optics to get a handle on the tracking is a pretty sloppy solution"
Planetside,3dspqg,Steelering,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:15:16 2015 UTC,"Zoom also helps you see your COF letting you know how long to burst.  And if you pick up randoms, it'll help them more."

Planetside,3dta8t,wycliffslim,7,Sun Jul 19 06:19:11 2015 UTC,"That's what I've been saying since forever. Respawning should have been offering more options, not less. The issue of massive zergs, be it on offense or defense, is ultimately caused by the timer-based capture mechanics. The ease of redeploying was merely a tool to satisfy this strategic need.  If the reason why platoons jump between bases was eliminated then we'd be free to not restrict spawning so drastically, which would help lone-wolfs (and noobs are almost always lone-wolfs) tremendously. Noobs already don't have the experience to identify when the fight they are at is bad or read the map to find good ones. Making it hard for them to get to where they want to be isn't productive.  That said, the current limited respawn distance has increased the amount of transport vehicles being used which is great. I think that in conjunction with a more lenient spawn system we should downgrade most smaller bases on every continent to hackable relays with no spawn room. That would increase the space between bases hence giving more space for vehicle fights and transport.  I don't think meddling with XP rewards is such a great idea though. Many of those people redeploying en masse to crash good fights do not really care about XP all that much. Otherwise they'd be doing something else, wouldn't they? Change base layouts, make base capture organic and not timer-based, and these problems would disappear. The issues stem from the reversal of roles that happens after attackers have turned every control point: attackers have to defend the points and defenders have to capture them from within. I'd rather have each base with a layered design where attackers advance linearly up to some hackable thing that would turn the base in a few seconds. That way, defenders would be defenders for the whole time of the attack and a base without a defending force comparable to the attacking force would get taken almost immediately. That last thing alone practically ensures that people would stay ""in their lane""."

Yeah... other base capture mechanics could work as well. If they implemented a version of the PS1 power system one faction could simply just siege another out of a base in large enough fights.

Planetside,3dta8t,HaemoglobinUK,11,Sun Jul 19 21:18:49 2015 UTC,"Just as a counter argument:  The problem with only bringing a knife to a gun fight is that any minute GOKU will redeploy 3 squads and 20 maxes on your head and at that point you're fucked because you weren't able to prepare properly.  Often times overpop is just a pre-emptive measure against the inevitable redeploy, not to say that redeploy is bad, just that this is what the game design has created."

Planetside,3dta8t,mrsmegz,3,Sun Jul 19 14:01:15 2015 UTC,"I comprehend this incredibly well. I ran a fairly small outfit. We rarely had more than 1 squad on. So, I spent a lot of time getting crushed by a platoon dropping on us. But, it was still pretty fun and it helped my players improve dramatically. In the month or so that we were doing regular ops 2-3 days a week the increase in average skill of the guys playing was huge."
Planetside,3dta8t,InMedeasRage,3,Sun Jul 19 14:15:24 2015 UTC,"When I lead and go on the offensive with say 2 squads. Its pointless to try a 3 cap base, so we mainly stick with the single point bases.  Most of the time you are out populated in the last 90 seconds (even after redeploy changes, just not as bad), but sometimes get a good even fight.  Speaking of efficiency that /u/Rozhestvensky mentions. Lets say I wrangle the herd of 24, load up Sunderers move out and get to the next base where there are only 4 ppl defending.  It takes at least 3-5 min get from ""ok guys lets go"" to ""Sunderers setup moving to point."" Assuming no resistance it takes another minute to point, 3 minutes on cap and one of three things happen.   A balanced back and forth fight for the base. (Fun/Efficient) No enemies show up and we spent 10min looking at spawn rooms and choke points, but at least you win. (NotFun/NotEfficient)  Overpopped in the last minute and swarmed on point with grenades and MAX's then dissipate moments later. (Bad/NotEfficient)   When attacking, having a positive outcome for your group is in the minority, but when it happens, it feels great.  Its harder to keep your group having fun and staying online when you are on the attack. There needs to be some kind of incentive for attempting to attack or else the game just turns into a bunch of ""redeploy squads"" looking for he next defense to farm.  TLDR: Planetside 2 makes it very difficult to cultivate fun fights in the open world with efficient use of forces."
Planetside,3dta8t,Mustarde,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:41:46 2015 UTC,Or we do.  There's one base getting zerged.  One base getting crushed.  Five fucking lanes open to the fucking fuck enemy fucking bads who can't fucking split squads to save their goddamn fucking lives.  And so zerg meets or passes zerg until the alert ends instead of every base being pushed in (sorta like Server Smash... wonder why we're so fucking effective at that...).

Sometimes it makes sense to divide forces.  But a smart PL will anticipate which bases they are likely to see resistance at, and will set up accordingly - with population, battle buses on the point and various force multipliers to hold off the inevitable push.  After joining GOKU, I can't even count the number of times we have ghost capped a tech plant or biolab down to 1 minute and then won the base by the threads of our spandex as the enemy redeployed or gal dropped twice our number.  And lets be real - as a commander, when you see a 96+ zerg marching down a lane, the smart thing to do is let them go until they hit a hard point.  Then, spam /orders, get everyone ready and crush the zerg at whatever 3 point tower they were dumb enough to push, and watch it dissipate after you get your farm.  Then, more often than not, you can reclaim the lost ground while that zerg runs off to the other front because they ignored it too long."

I'm too lazy to do it and I have no excuses, but there's not enough predictions like that in command chat. ""Defend X!"" is ok, but often you can tell if it's just wasting more mans for a lost base.  ""TR will redeploy to X after securing Y, pull stuff and go to X/Y as soon as they move"" or ""don't defend X, they'll zerg this lane until we stop them at Y""  That's the heads-up new players don't know and gives busy players time to react."

Planetside,3dta8t,Ares149,4,Sun Jul 19 13:58:31 2015 UTC,"Using smaller numbers is a long term better way to play. I'm going to say that I believe this is objectively true. Using smaller numbers forces your players to improve and your leaders to improve. When players see improvement as a general trend they're much more likely to have fun and want to keep playing, and keep improving.    Just ask any of the old Waterson VS vets who were around during the dark days of the Red Biscuit Tide and then the later NC'ening about this...they will concur immediately.   Playing with small numbers is the best way to increase selection pressure on your playstyle, tactics, et. al.   Instead DBG in all their wisdom of trying to remake the game as MilSimSide2 decided to incentivize the zerg by making it even harder to redeploy somewhere else and/or operate flexibly.

Of course there's a trade-off, but anyway that's the game part.  We can help by being nice, changing our playstyle, giving help, etc. etc. Problem is, people enjoy different things. Lazy is one thing, playing but not having fun is another. So it's probably correct to say that for the majority of them there's a trade-off. That's the community part.

Planetside,3dta8t,rolfski,2,Sun Jul 19 13:16:08 2015 UTC,"The big issue that makes it a pain in the rear for new players are that there is no balanced fights and if you find one while looking at the map they are usually extremely over popped by one side once you get there. For us who have been playing for a while we can easily figure out which fights will turn into god fights in a couple of minutes and get there before that. The fact that the general meta still seems to be shifting all organized people between zerg defending one base on one front and spread out attack on the other is making this even worse.  Players in squads and platoons still have much more spawn options to help relocate cross continent that is not available to solo players. The squad spawn range limitation was a good change and it made things better for a while, but with the unlimited squad spawn range within uncontested friendly territory it will not make much of a difference once people adapt to the changes.  The only thing keeping this from getting totally out of control right now is the very unreliable spawning that randomly puts you in a completely random location instead of in the vehicle you tried to spawn in and the fact that you can't see which vehicle you spawn on if you have multiple squad Galaxies/Sunderers/Valkyries up."

Planetside,3dta8t,Jmoseph,2,Sun Jul 19 12:06:30 2015 UTC,You're confusing easy with effective and efficient.  It's easy to zerg bases. It's the best way to take ONE base.

But you are being borderline schizophrenic with this post.  On one hand, you would rather have ""a good fight at a base for 10 hours"" than see a zerg take territory unopposed.  Yet you repeatedly emphasize that the point of the game is to take territory.    You bemoan laziness, yet beg for instant action and redeploy to be reverted to their previous states.  I would support you if I could, but I literally have no idea what I would be supporting.  Am I in favor of taking territory or farming?  Should I max crash to win a fight or redeploy across the map and kill a fight there?  The things you are asking for and advocating for are at odds with one another.  Here's the reality: Planetside has a rather harsh learning curve.  There's no PVE content to ease a player in.  It's 100% PVP, without any instances or new player zones (unless we see a PC Koltyr).  There's no ranking system to keep elite players vs elites, etc.  There is literally no realistic way to shield them from the hellfuck they have coming when GOKU drops a platoon on their heads, or when AOD rolls up with 3 platoons and crushes a base.   And to, with a straight face, ask the players of this game to stop winning fights, under the guise of ""getting good"", you have to be out of your god damned mind.  DBG does need to redo the tutorial system.  Ultimately, outfits and leaders are the solution to bringing new players in and helping them make sense out of the chaos.  You criticize zergfits for steamrolling bases and giving new players little to do, but for many, that is exactly what they need to ease into the game.  As they advance in skill and experience, they will start looking for more challenge and better teammates - so many players I know in high end outfits started out in AOD or a similar group.  Once they outgrew it, they moved on.  Factions who can't manage their overpop will ultimately pay for it during alerts.  If you hell march a single lane unopposed, there are other population vulnerabilities that can be exploited and often are.  Sometimes, the best strategy is to pop-dump a single hex to take a difficult base, then spread back out.   I empathize with the sentiment of your post and want more new players to learn this game and love it - but your suggestions and tone of ""elitism"" is so wrong and out of touch - I'm surprised you read this whole thing and still decided to hit enter."
Planetside,3dta8t,-Pin_Cushion-,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:14:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the time to respond. I think you're misinterpreting a few of the things I'm trying to say. And, it's quite possibly my fault for the way I wrote it. I'll try to address your points.   On one hand, you would rather have ""a good fight at a base for 10 hours"" than see a zerg take territory unopposed. Yet you repeatedly emphasize that the point of the game is to take territory.   The point of the game IS to take territory but at the end of the day that territory doesn't matter. The only time territory matters is during an alert and since alerts usually have max population on either side massive overpop is SLIGHTLY punished. If there's no alert on the continent the difference in what you can do with 1 base vs 20 is absolutely nothing.   If territory had actual significant value I would be much more okay with rolling over valuable bases to get them. But, since bases don't matter, I personally, would rather have fun fights than steamroll bases since that's much more entertaining.   You bemoan laziness, yet beg for instant action and redeploy to be reverted to their previous states.   I'm talking about two different types of laziness here. The problem I have is the lack of desire to improve or do anything but the, smash hammer into face, approach to playing. To many outfits, the tactic for taking a base that they got pushed out of is, ""pull more MAX's, pull more vehicle spam, outpop more heavily"". That's a lazy way of playing that doesn't give players an incentive to ever try and improve. Nor does it help leaders.   All I want out of instant action is for it to work reliably. Honestly, if instant action worked well and they made a few tweaks to squad spawning and the like I would be very happy with the spawning system. At least then you would always have a way to get to A fight. Right now it's fairly easy as a solo player or small squad to be in a position where there's no immediate spawn at any type of fight and your ONLY option is to pull a sunderer or galaxy and spend a few minutes flying to get to a fight. That's FINE, sometimes. But, many players just want to hop on and play the game for 30 minutes or an hour during some freetime. Currently it's difficult for a veteran to do that easily much less a new player.   And to, with a straight face, ask the players of this game to stop winning fights, under the guise of ""getting good"", you have to be out of your god damned mind.   I'm not asking anyone to stop winning fights? Nowhere did I ever say, ""Stop winning fights"". I'm suggesting that the game would be better overall if players didn't create situations where a fight isn't a fight. 96+ dropping on 12-24 isn't a fight. It's just a very short wipe and then a spawnroom camp and a few minutes of frustration for the defenders and boredom for the attackers.  Drop 24-36 on that fight with 24 defenders and everything changes. You've still got a decent population advantage, however the defenders now have a chance to at least fight back and your attackers will actually be able to shoot at people and play the game. Everyone wins.   so many players I know in high end outfits started out in AOD or a similar group. Once they outgrew it, they moved on   Yes and no. Sure, a lot of players started in large outfits. But for every Mustarde, or Painballa, or DaysofDoom, there's probably 30+ unknownVSplayers who joined SSGO during one of their mass WG outfits invites. Then they spent the next couple of days rolling around in a giant ball of players. Probably barely got any kills but died repeatedly, usually out of nowhere to a DA/AC/TIW player farming the zerg. Thought, this is what the game was all about and just never came back. All you have to do is look at the outfit roster of zergfits. A huge percentage of their players are sub BR10 and haven't logged on in months.  The players that claw their way out often do it because of their own desire and are the minority.   Factions who can't manage their overpop will ultimately pay for it during alerts. If you hell march a single lane unopposed, there are other population vulnerabilities that can be exploited and often are. Sometimes, the best strategy is to pop-dump a single hex to take a difficult base, then spread back out.   Alerts are a slightly different matter, I agree. However, alerts are a small part of the game and it's pretty easy to play and just not manage to get into an alert continent or not even play while an alert is going on if you only play for an hour or so a few times a week.    I empathize with the sentiment of your post and want more new players to learn this game and love it - but your suggestions and tone of ""elitism"" is so wrong and out of touch - I'm surprised you read this whole thing and still decided to hit enter.   Honestly, the idea of the post was to be a bit inflammatory. Elitist... not intended. I'd just much rather see players be pushed to improve and grow. I've known too many friends that tried this game, got stuck in shitty fights and just refused to come back because they had THAT bad of a first experience in the game."
Planetside,3dta8t,Jmoseph,2,Sun Jul 19 19:31:37 2015 UTC,"I can't point-by-point respond, but if you are asking outfits like AOD or PHX to bring less people to a fight, you are essentially setting them up to be destroyed when someone like AC/GOKU/BAX/D117/L/TIW shows up.  There is no amount of ""getting good"" that can turn <1 KDR players into coordinated squads that can stand up to entire groups of 3+ KDR infantry focused players.  Those groups survive and succeed by bringing numbers.  Over time, they can become more skilled, but the fact remains - teamwork will always be OP.  Want to counter that zerg?  Bring your own.  I agree that the respawn/instant action system needs tweaking - but that is more a solo player gripe than what your larger post is getting at.  But the solution is not bemoaning the fact that someone is rocking battle gals, or max crashing, or using some other tactic to overwhelm the enemy.   The answer is to counter it."
Planetside,3dta8t,Vindicore,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:16:26 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest. Most fights DON'T get crashed by groups of 3+ K/D infantry players anymore. Most of the top outfits don't play in any type of organized sense anymore. And even when they do it's only 12 guys at most. You don't need 48 zerglings to take a base from 6-12 AC.  And, just counter the zerg and battle gals is a flawed argument. For two reasons.  The biggest is that without an equally sized group there's nothing you can do. And you can't just summon 40 players out of thin air for your own personal use. Your zerg is probably ""busy"" following an empty lattice land somewhere else.

From what I understand, gathering a huge mass of mindless flesh to throw at the enemy until they were battered into submission was giving him a real dead space vibe... But I digress, by spamming invites and liberal kicking you too can be a br 25 and br 11 with a full platoon of Necromorphs players."

A game which is a hundred times more complex and had a far far worse NPE for a decade; yet newbie groups attracted and retained thousands of new players a year."
Planetside,3dta8t,VSWanter,2,Sun Jul 19 10:38:52 2015 UTC,"Yet the mantra in EVE is ""HTFU"" - something the OP is literally arguing the opposite of.

Planetside,3dta8t,VSWanter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:19:39 2015 UTC,I'm not asking veterans to stop winning fights. I would never suggest that because it's stupid. I'm suggesting that if people didn't overpop fights to a massive degree then new players would have a much better introduction to the game.  You don't need to gal drop 96 players on the 18 guys held up on A point taking your base.
Planetside,3dta8t,VSWanter,0,Sun Jul 19 19:34:31 2015 UTC,"While true, I don't think this detracts from my argument of EVE corporations outperforming PS2 outfits in recruitment of new players.  The reality is there's a lot of veteran players in EVE who do stop winning fights and being effective for the sake of the new guys they're leading and teaching.  For them it's about having a fun op or whatever and involving everyone.  I'm sure there are veteran PS2 players who might choose similar path."
Planetside,3dta8t,VSWanter,2,Sun Jul 19 20:04:51 2015 UTC,"The difference is that EVE is really difficult to play solo, whereas PS2 is really easy.  Press the green thing.  Shoot at the bad guys.  Die.  Do it again.  In EVE you need a corp to access some of the most basic parts of the game."
Planetside,3dta8t,Ares149,-1,Sun Jul 19 16:23:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, but like EVE it's  far more enjoyable with a group.  Differences abound but the similarities are enough I believe for PS2 outfits to take a page from EVE corporations in this area."

Nothing in the past gives us any indication that anything will change enough to bring people back or give long terms meaning.

Planetside,3dta8t,AngerMacFadden,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:01:25 2015 UTC,If you don't punish players for zerging or reward leaders for breaking up the zerg they'll never stop doing it as a whole.  It's easy for leaders to simply steamroll bases because then they require absolutely zero ability at leading to pull it off. It's easy for players to be part of that steamroll because they get to think they're a lot better at the game than they are.
Planetside,3dta8t,Winsstons,5,Sun Jul 19 13:55:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think the zerging happens intentionally nearly as much as it happens by accident.  I often see several groups respond to the same fight when only one was needed, but no one bothered to communicate.  The only way zerging will be solved is to provide development to the leadership game so that leadership improves in both quality and quantity.  Veteran leaders don't lead anymore, because they want to have fun too.  I used to care about winning and playing objectives when I was willing to lead, but directive farming is what has been intentionally marketed to me, and so that's where the ""fun"" is."

I dare say MOST leaders have been burnt out like a squirrel caught in a power main because of how bad the leadership tools have been and how bad the incentives for good leading have been gameplay wise."
Planetside,3dta8t,Winsstons,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:01:13 2015 UTC,I would say it's honestly a compound issue.  The game makes it harder to communicate and play in a less lazy manner. And then people use that as an excuse to just not care.  When the game launched and everyone was full of energy and optimism leader chat was usually filled with leads coordinating and trying to keep populations balanced.  No one cares enough to do this anymore and since there are no systems in place to facilitate doing it easily the whole situation basically snowballs out of control.
Planetside,3dta8t,Aloysyus,3,Sun Jul 19 14:30:08 2015 UTC,"Leading at the games release was actually more enjoyable than it has become.  Part of that was the optimism of things that could be, but another part is that strategic options have gotten more shallow when they needed more depth.  The job has also become more work and less game, which has always seemed like a lack of foresight.  When good leaders are leading well, then there isn't that much of an issue with wasted resources, but the problem is there aren't many leaders, and the few that are don't really know how to lead well because there are no tools other than wisdom currently that will teach them.  Then when you get an outfit like mine who is willing to give anyone who wants to learn leadership, the opportunity to learn it, a bunch of other idiot general outfit leaders want to make their learning experience toxic for them through command chat or other methods.  You are right when you say ""No one cares enough to do this anymore"" but the only people that can change that are the devs.  They won't though."
Planetside,3dta8t,Emperorpenguin5,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:47:32 2015 UTC,"Also, the game doesn't encourage starting smaller fights at more lattice links, and keeping them going. Not sure if there needs to be ""Passive XP tick while in enemy hex with point flipping"" XP (kind of like standing on capture point XP) but you often see at least 1/2 the lattice lanes on an alert continent being completely ignored.

When I was a new player I had NO problem getting killed by people in a 1v1 because they were better or because I put myself in bad positioning. I still have no problem with that.  What is absolutely frustrating is a fight where there are simply so many enemies that you can't DO anything. As a new player that frustration is 500 times worse because you probably don't have the skill to at least get a decent amount of kills out of it. And, you probably don't have the knowledge to know that you need to pack in the tower and go somewhere else nor even how to do that."

Planetside,3dta8t,iSchwak,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:59:18 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem I see with the NC on Emerald (as an example) is a lot of noobs sprinkled with the jaded veterans who don't give a shit anymore.  Sure, they like to play, but rarely, do I see them doing anything constructive. Hell, most of 'em don't even complain any longer as it does absolutely no good.  Most have found a few long term PS2 friends, made an outfit and console themselves with terrorizing noobs and lesser players for an hour or so then log off. Or are content to solo, helping out in small ways battle by battle.  But, I guess, the real question is why did they get that way in the first place?  It's the game.   There isn't anything to build for. There is very little to do except grind certs or Directives to keep the attention of new players. Couple that with the multitude of other issues the game has and, well, most veterans are just beaten down by the time the get a few years in.  Most veterans I know have tried their hands at leading squads or outfits, but it's almost always short term as there are very few rewards for all the hard work.  You can blame Sony and the devs for much of that. They took the focus off of the epic game experience and turned it into a farming exercise with the focus squarely on promoting individual accomplishments. It's all about stats, Directives and the cert grind. Almost zero focus on the team or the faction.  Those things do not promote PS2's difference from every other FPS on the market. Its size.  Promoting that epic experience which just screams outfit creation, requires new blood to fill those ranks, strategy and planning and leadership should have been the core of PS2 gameplay.  None of these things were promoted and are just barely encouraged in PS2.   There are many arguments to be made about the core gameplay and what it would take to change this situation, but we all know it isn't going to happen, the game will still bleed players.  The thing is, I'm not certain the engine can handle the epic gameplay the game advertises and needs to set itself apart. One only needs to fight in a battle with two zergs in it for any length of time to see what I mean.  Those who have stuck it out are those who have invested financially and can't let go, those who like the game as a drop-in for the lack of something else to do, those who really like the game-play as it is, or those who still have faith, hope and are sticking it out. Or a bit of all these things.  I'm in that last category.   I want the game to be something more than it is, but every passing month, every passing year I get a little bit more of the who gives a crap attitude that many of my fellow gamers have fallen prey to.  I am becoming THAT veteran.  I truly wish it wasn't this way, but as it is, I'll keep playing solo and do what I can in those small moments during a battle."
Planetside,3dta8t,raiedite,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:24:42 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Strongly. The developers is responsible for how the game works, even if the game is mostly player-driven.  Let's be realistic, a post on Reddit or a minority of outfit leaders taking up the ideal will not change anything. The majority doesn't read Reddit, doesn't give a shit about being ""lazy"" or ""unfair"" to new players, and won't play in x or y way if it is not more convenient and easier for them to do so. It's the cost-benefit logic.  If being player-driven is detrimental to the game, then players should either be deprived of the freedom to do ""unfair"" things that make the game unfun for new players, or be encouraged/forced to play in a way that is beneficial to newbies instead. The latter is the best option of course.  Example: If bringing 5 battlegals to a 12-12 fight seems unfair, then the devs should create a system where battlegals in this situation are permanently spotted and visible on the map, and give a 3x XP bonus to who shoots them down and to relative assists. Perhaps it could even be a mini-mission given to every ESF in a 4000 meters radius.  That's how you fix the game. I don't like the ""we don't want to nerf fun""/""it's emergent gameplay"" attitude that the devs sometimes adopt. Yeah, may be a two Liberator skygod guys flying their glorious sky chariot in a frontline that is not even theirs (EGTR lib in VS-NC frontline) may be fun for those two people, but it's only fun for them. Everyone else is getting frustrated and newbies are getting more inclined to leave the game, so if nerfing the fun of those two guys can improve the situation, so be it."

We choose to bring 5 battle gals to a 12-24 fight making it impossible for the other side to fight back even though we already have population.

(And it's not just on new players. :-/ )  Lattice The way it's set up atm it simply forces big fights. In a perfectly evened out scenario there may be overall ""okay"" fights but that's just theory. The system needs to give enough room for fluctuation and spreading out. I'd like to see the Lattice changes for the conquest mode go live on all continents (and the game mode can stay in Phase 0.5). Maybe not the final answer but it would give much more possibility to have smaller fights - so helping the community make it happen.   New Player Zones Most MMOs have zones where new players are among themselves and can make their first steps in the game. PS2 got Kolyr on the PS4 release, but that's not really an adequate equivalent. On top of that you will still be stomped if you get out of them as you still have to learn whats really going on the hard way if you like it or not. With DBG having up-ed the cert cost for essential tool like G/A lock-on it's even harder for new players. I have no answer/suggestion for this, sadly."
Planetside,3dta8t,VSWanter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:02:44 2015 UTC,Essentially fully agree with both of these statements.  Lattice is a partial dev problem that players use as an excuse for their playstyle.  New Player Zones will always be a problem with PS2 and I dunno if you can really fix that since it is an open world game with no instancing.

What I disagree with you on is the title of your post.  It is offensive to the few remaining leaders who do nothing but teach newer players how to have fun here and not rage quit.  The developers are completely responsible for the state of the new player experience at this point, not the community.  The community is the way it is, because of the bad prioritization choices the Devs made.  If leadership received literally any development attention, then perhaps they might still be here willing to lead and teach.  The community will not fix this problem, they are incapable of it.

Go somewhere else.   Unless the spawn shack's got a great view, being a spawn-room warrior does little of value.  Now, if you don't care about the strategy and just want certs that's fine. Being a spawn-room warrior makes sense. But I don't think you have the right to try and hamstring other people's attempts to play the game ""properly"", even if their efforts are largely futile.

Calling for a max crash over open terrain, while being camped by air and ground vehicles, is not Genius. It's really stupid. As you stated, the other person did indeed waste resources. He also gave the opposing force a large amount of what I like to call ""free kills"".  The only correct response for this situation, assuming people are trying to play the objective and not just get kills/exp, is to redeploy to the next base, and set up anti-vehicle and anti-air before the opposing force moves in.   If you want someone on your side to give out bad tactical advice then please, take the guy. That's one less person to argue with me when I recommend to people that they should leave the base and not give the zerg any kills."

It doesn't matter that the plan was poor,  what matters was the intent to do something.  I'd also disagree with your solution tbh (in a very hypothetical sense as we don't know any specifics base, continent force composition etc). The best way to deal with such a high disparity in numbers is always going to be through spawn denial to disperse the zerg rather than a direct defence that is unlikely to succeed,  but that's off topic."

Planetside,3dt60t,dayofmone,0,Sun Jul 19 10:30:53 2015 UTC,"So, you chose to be a spawnroom warrior and you are complaining about someone actually playing the game?  And no, you are wrong, sometimes there are tons of vehicles spamming at spawn but very little infantry on the actual point in the buildings.  And what's the actual benefit of staying in the spawn? Free kills until the base is lost? Seriously dude... this is the best you can come up with, you are a perfect example of braindead people in PS2."
Planetside,3dt60t,Cmndr_Duke,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:40:35 2015 UTC,"So many times I have made the run from spawn to point at a camped base to find maybe 5 guys there just waiting on the timer not actually watching anything, while the platoon just shot at spawn shields."
Planetside,3dt60t,CountOneInterrupt,0,Mon Jul 20 07:06:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly, you can save the base in most unlikely circumstances. Many times I used Light Assault to get to the flag, killing 3-4 guys on it and finally being overwhelmed by an extra one or two. Sure, even if I manage to recap enemies will start swarming in, but that might give people from spawn a chance to break out and join the flag.  And those sudden reverses are the most fun and spectacular moments of Planetside. If I die, well, It's not like I need to uninstall after that. Playing for K/D for the sake of K/D itself, bailing out of ESF's and redeploying, spawnroom warrioring are really, really bad habits."

Planetside,3duld2,EclecticDreck,2,Sun Jul 19 21:42:21 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of Monthly Events, but I believe there are things of higher priority, and don't believe that even those will actually happen.  Many of us are so bored and jaded with how stale things have become that we are happy to complain about any change as long as there is change.  The Devs seem equally cynical and are completely unwilling to communicate regarding larger issues, for a variety of legitimate reasons.  They also do have the Halloween and Winter Holiday events that they could just expand on a bit more, but all that Dev work is needed in other places that they either can't or won't touch for reasons.  Crates sounds interesting if done right, but they can't just give Daybreak Cash.  The more they give out stuff for free, the more they cheapen their already mostly free product.  Giving away free stuff can work as a promotional tool, but at a certain point product saturation starts to work against you, and this is especially true if you give a currency instead of items.  What always gets brought up regarding ideas for them to work on, is how much resources it will take vs how much benefit will be received ie money will they make.  You know my feelings are strongly with the need to make this game better for leaders, but even that is always met with resistance, because most players don't feel the leadership experience impacts them.  The devs also believe this too."
Planetside,3duld2,VSWanter,2,Sun Jul 19 17:44:11 2015 UTC,"Usually games suffer from people complaining and praising one particular thing. Take the autoban feature for example.  I personally love it, and love the fact that they are sticking to their guns about it. Just because a few players tried to break the system and get banned doesn't mean it isn't performing the function it was created and designed to do.  Devs will be planetman-handled either way, if they implement or if they don't.   Crates sounds interesting if done right, but they can't just give Daybreak Cash.   What I mean is it would cost 250 DBC, not reward DBC."

Planetside,3dsc1c,fatfreddy01,2,Sun Jul 19 00:38:29 2015 UTC,"being class locked once you place the turret is my biggest complaint also. if you could just drop the turret and go do something else, i'd use it way more. but then i guess we'll have to deal with point guards with turret/deployables/heavy."
Planetside,3dsc1c,NethChild,4,Sun Jul 19 06:57:04 2015 UTC,"I think its absurd you have to resupply spitfire turrets. At the very least, be able to replace your turret after 10-15 seconds w/o resupply."
Planetside,3dsc1c,Tearloch,7,Sun Jul 19 06:49:19 2015 UTC,I honestly doubt that replaceable spitfires would be so game breaking in a game of many... many broken features.

Planetside,3dsc1c,kazzah9,2,Sun Jul 19 01:00:01 2015 UTC,"If you were to limit the AV turret in some way like this, I'd limit the amount of ammo you can hold per resupply at a terminal (not affected by ammo packs), not the placement of the turret itself.  Everything else the same.  For the spitfire, you should be able to carry more than one but only keep one active at a time."
Planetside,3dsc1c,RailFury,4,Sun Jul 19 01:46:11 2015 UTC,"Easiest way to fix the AV turret is to make it go dumbfire after 100m or so. Suddenly vehicles would be able to avoid most shots by just staying mobile, but turret operators would also have a second or two to make minor corrections.  The ability to track targets and consistently land shots @ 400m away is what makes them so powerful."

Planetside,3dsc1c,ld115,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:44:35 2015 UTC,"Just let them have refillable ammo or cost nanites in a similar fashion as grenades or mines. Low cost, like 10-50 depending on the turret. You could carry up to 2 at any one time (through use of utility pouch maybe 5).   Though in reality, the spitfire is great in battles where your turret can overlook choke points with people backing it up. The few bases where a point is in the center of a room with pathways looking down to entrances, it excels well there because it does wonders as a support. The construction sites on Hossin are a good example."

It's max damage range should be 10-12m, and it should get the GODSaw super HVA treatment that stretches its minimum damage waaaaaaaaaay out there and bumps its velocity significantly.

In every case most of the playerbase ignored the weapon class and considered it inferior to automatics and sniper rifles. PS2 is no exception.  IMO that means PS2 should get creative with balancing and try to break the mold for its battle rifles. One way to do that in a cool sci-fi fashion would be to give BRs a ""smartlink"" attachment  that would let both ADS and hipfire COF shrink all the way to zero (bloom would still exist and the attachment would make hipfire bloom even more severe). That way players with good twitch reflexes would be able to compete with automatics and sniper rifles despite inferior DPS by skipping the ADS animation. If balanced properly it would create a cool new playstyle niche."

Part of the difficulty with using them using them is the really-pretty harsh recoil angle and its effect while moving on ADS, especially against moving targets, making it tough to pick up and use.

Planetside,3druke,Wobberjockey,3,Sun Jul 19 01:33:04 2015 UTC,"The main deal with battle rifles is that they just aren't accurate enough to be worth it compared to automatic guns - both the starting/moving COF and especially the per-shot bloom are too high. (this is also the factor that makes the high-zoom semi auto snipers so terrible.)   They're supposed to be light marksman weapons, so they should be precise and stay accurate when fired on the move. The shot pacing currently required to manage their high bloom absolutely destroys their damage output, and firing at a usefully high pace causes shots to fly everywhere around your target.  Personally I wish they had more velocity and a longer max damage range too, but that'd just be icing."

Planetside,3druke,MacroCode,7,Sat Jul 18 21:38:45 2015 UTC,"God, NO.  Battle rifles are all around a more inferior class of weapon compared to the Semi auto scout rifles we have access to already.  The only points they have in advantage are a faster ROF and more ammo /mag, but in exchange you do less damage/shot. Which means a 2 headshot distance out to 8 meters as opposed to a 2 headshot kill at ALL ranges.   Currently the COF bloom is atrocious for a semi-auto weapon, as is the FSRM (frankly FSRM is on all semi-auto weapons, IMO, because you are ALWAYS experiencing it), and you are going to need to let the sights settle back on your target to hit multiple headshots - something that directly removes the benefit of having a faster ROF for the battle rifles.  Battle rifles currently have no place in the infiltrators arsenal. the Full auto scouts are better at close range simply because they are full auto capable, and the semi scouts far outshine them at longer range.  the only way that they could possibly fit in the infiltrators arsenal is if they were given a 3 round burst functionality, and they were tuned so that you could reliably land 2-3 of those rounds on a target about 25-30m away i.e. midrange  but that would then force the rebalancing of the TR ESSR (The Trap), and I'm pretty sure that they are not going to want to do that because    it has been commented many times before that no matter how the devs rebalance the weapon, SOMEONE is going to prefer how it was. it doesn't help the game's bottom line. a new weapon, or class of weapon, or weapon in an existing class is going to produce new revenue for the team, while fixing old weapons, or rebalancing them so that they no longer have gaps, is something that does not. The bullet velocity buffs the weapons need would likely make them faster than most sniper rifles... which means that you are either going to make a sanity pass on those - changing the ballistic curve on every single one, and messing up potentially thousands of kills worth of practice for every sniper, or have BR join the Rhino which already has a faster bullet velocity than sniper rifles (I mean why snipe with a rifle when you have an LMG has a BASE bullet velocity that is 10m/s less than the T3 'long range' sniper rifles?)

The problem with battle rifles, and a number of other long range guns in this game, is that it's much easier to take a gun that performs well at close range, fire in controlled bursts, and kill people at a distance, than it is to take these guns and survive the close range fights that inevitably ensue when you're trying to reposition or get jumped by smg infil.  The second problem is that if you're fighting at ranges the BR is designed for, your biggest enemy is invisible, and will kill you instantly if you stand still, which means eating the atrocious moving COF on top of the guns somewhat unpredictable recoil."

(using them as scout rifles with a 2x or 3.4x really makes them shine) sadly there aint much you can do about that.  First change that needs done is the VS directive one needs a forward grip, it is there visually but the benefit isnt. also removing HV from the directive ones would be grand.  now onto making them good with simple stat buffs   Decrease COF and moving COF. having 'accuracy weapons' to be inaccurate is a joke. (currently the BR's have more COF than the gauss saw!) slight velocity increase (this would improve its lacking ranged performance and make them easier to use) a improvement on their damage drop off (without the HV penalty) would be excellent. Softpoint acess could be intresting, but isnt needed. (improve versatility)   Other potential changes   Allow infils to acess them. sure scout rifles are better in most ways, but the nice mag size is cool, and they would benefit from the infils flanking ability. LA acsess might be intresting, or might be wonky. baron with slugs already works quite well, as does the pulsarC/AC11X (which outperform the BR for many players). However i understand people dont want legions of rooftop snipers. If possible scopes that toggle zooms would make them more versatile without buffing stats Removal of 6x scopes would be intresting: as it means less people would attempt to use them as a SA sniper and then complain that they dont snipe well, of course they dont, they are weak scout rifles!

Planetside,3druke,ChillyPhilly27,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:32:06 2015 UTC,Get rid of the horizontal recoil and ADS cone of fire. Semi-automatic rifles shouldn't have any cone of fire when aiming down sights and should always have their projectile go exactly where you're aiming. This should be the main benefit of not being an automatic or burst weapon.
Planetside,3druke,Selerox,5,Sat Jul 18 23:10:42 2015 UTC,"I don't use them because they're overshadowed by pretty much everything. Automatics are just as effective at longer ranges on top of being way easier to use at close range. A Gauss SAW is such a huge upgrade over the BRs that I felt hilariously overpowered when I swapped back after auraxiuming the Warden. Even the TMG/SAW S/Flare class of LMGs feels so much more powerful. And then of course ARs are even more accurate.  If you want to improve them the CoF bloom needs a reduction, as it does with any semi-auto, so balance that first. Then you guys could either reduce the recoil enough that it's super easy to control sustained fire at longer ranges, increase their projectile velocity or make them have no damage drop off so that they have a 2 shot headshot. If you want them to be really good combine two of those to make them one of the best long range weapons in game.   Also crossing my fingers that you'll look at the scout rifles and semi-auto snipers. They're all at least as broken as the Battle Rifles and in dire need of some balancing love."
Planetside,3druke,Semmarv,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:26:20 2015 UTC,LMGs are more lethal at range than battle rifles.  The COF bloom and FSRM prevent actual success at long range compared to bursting an LMG.

As an HA I wouldn't even bother with a Battle Rifle in the first place. Battle Rifles just don't do anything that other weapons do better, and they're flat-out worse in most situations.  Battle Rifles need to be weapons that beat the long range Carbine/AR/LMGs in all areas of long range combat to make them worth using.  There needs to be a real spectrum of weapons, right now it just stops at ""Long Range"" Carbine/AR/LMG because there's nothing that beats it at long range.   SMG (Eridani)/Shotgun (Thanatos) > Short Range (VX6-7) > Mid Range (Zenith) > Long Range (Pulsar C) > Battle Rifle (Eidolon)  Right now, no-one in their right mind would take the Eidolon.

Then tweak the CoF and FSM so it's more usable at range.  Something also needs to be done about the whole scout rifle/battle rifle thing as far as directives go.
Planetside,3druke,CzerwonyKolorNicku,2,Sun Jul 19 01:39:44 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think the Battle Rifles shouldn't be class restricted. Heavy, Engineer, and Medic already have them, but Infiltrator and Light Assault could use them.  For Infiltrator, it just makes sense. The Scout Rifle directive requires earning the Auraxium medal for 4 weapons, 75% of which are Infiltrator exclusive, but then gives a weapon that can't be used by the Infiltrator? It's absolutely ridiculous. Now, the Battle Rifles do feel a bit inferior to the semi-auto Scout Rifles, but being allowed to use a directive weapon on the class you spent 75%+ of your time earning is worth it.  As for giving the Battle Rifle to the Light Assault, that one's certainly going to be a little more controversial. But the HC1, Pulsar C, and ACX-11 can compete with the Battle Rifle at all but the most extreme ranges, so I personally don't see the problem. The Battle Rifles aren't very strong, so even though Light Assault can shoot from angles unavailable to other classes, it's really not going to cause any more of a balance problem than Light Assaults using the ACX-11 from unexpected angles.  As for what they could do to make the Battle Rifles into a weapon worth choosing for reasons other than medal farming/directives-  First of all, the first-shot, non-moving ADS cone of fire should be 0. The NC's 200 damage guns have that, why shouldn't a weapon even more specialized for long range have that advantage?  Maybe giving them a 25 damage buff to the maximum damage would help too. Not enough to kill a shot sooner in close range, but it would give it a longer range before you start needing an additional shot to kill, especially with HV ammo."

Aim-Down-Sights, and fire at one of the target dummies with whatever you feel is a decent speed. Note where the bullets impact.  Now swap to the most inaccurate LMG of your faction, and repeat (To your best ability) the same inputs.

It's not like battle rifles are bad weapons, no, they are good, but overshadowed by most long range focused automatic weapons, especially by NC's 200 damage tier.   At maximum damage range (up to 8 meters) you can do kinda well provided that you score at least 1 head shot on your target. Unless he is HA with Overshields, then you will lose even if you chain-headshot him (ekhm, not when he is bad, obviously, but you get the point). Up to ~50 meters, the same story - you either headshot a lot, take cover and flank or you die. Above 100 meters you may actually have an upper hand against infantry if you aim well and they are not very good at controlling their weapons. Oh, also you are forced to stand still and wait after each shot for CoF reset to actually hit anything. Battle rifles are still worthless compared to f.e. Reaper or A-Tross at that range. Above 150-200 meters you have a clear advantage against non-snipers. Counter-sniping? Well, if you get the drop on them and they are noobs or sleepy, yeah, it works decently. Two quick headshots and they die. But if after first hit they cloak and move away you will notice them again when their instakilling bullets are half-way to your forehead.   Ok, so what's wrong?   Semi-automatic trigger is much harder to use than fully automatic, but that's OK, let's not change this. Maximum damage range of... 8 meters? Way too short. Since at CQC your only saving grace with a BR are headshots, headshots and headshots, why is the 2HSK range so short? It should be at least 15 meters, 20-25 would be perfect. Crouch/standing CoF - 0.1. It's acceptable, but CoF bloom is too high for that. Really. Go to VR and try to land 3 shots at targets' heads while firing at max speed, unless they are closer than 20m your third shot will almost always miss. For comparison: with Reaper you can easily chain 3 headshots even at 50 meters, and the Reaper is fully automatic. Angled recoil pattern only make already hard to use weapon even more tiresome. Also too much horizontal shake.   What do I think that needs to be done?   Maximum damage range of 20 meters. Decrease CoF bloom to 0.03-0.05 (currently 0.1) Increase fire rate to 360-400, it will boost DPS to 1500-1666, and a DPS boost is really needed for the weapon to be actually viable at short-mid range. Straight upward recoil, slightly less horizontal recoil SPA as an attachment Faster recoil decrease HVA boost should be bigger, let's say that it would up velocity to 750m/s and vertical recoil to 0.8 from 0.6"

Planetside,3druke,Epix_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:55:03 2015 UTC,"Ok let's talk about them.    Sometimes, very rarely, i break out my AMR-66 for my engy because i want some extra punch while playing ammo whore or enjoying some AI MANA shenanigans, otherwise i even forget i can use it on other classes.    I kinda like it on Engy because it allows me to score a few kills without making me too much of a target while i'm supporting my team from behind; with the advent of the Archer, however, the AMR has lost this position as i get a lot of versatility and the Blackhand can easily fill in as a pseudo battle rifle to finish off an enemy or two.    The main reason why i don't use it on other classes is that i can easily send more damage downrange with other long-range options, from the SABR to the TMG-50 and sometimes even carbines like the Cougar. And this is coming from TR, imagine how it must feel as an NC with all those sweet 200-damage automatic weapons that fill the same role. Now, in theory it's normal that powerful+accurate guns take a hit in their dps, but in the BRs' case their accuracy isn't anything special when compared to their competitors; their damage is also lackluster: 5 shots to kill is very close to the 7 required by any 167-143 weapon, with the added disadvantage of having a really low rate of fire. At that point, might as well take a more versatile weapon that can still perform well at range thanks to the sheer amount of bullets you can fire with it.    Compared to the other semi-auto weapons in the game (""close-range"" semi-auto sniper rifles and semi-auto scout rifles), the disadvantage in bullets to kill is deceptively small. The scouts kill in 4 shots, which seems close enough to not matter but actually means that a target has very little time to react and getting the 2 headshots required to score the fastest kill is possible even at medium and close range, but even a headshot+2-bodyshots combo is very quick. The added bodyshot or more that the battle rifles need to score may seem a non-issue, but most of the time that has given to the opponent enough time to fill you with bullets or simply move away, while with the scouts you would've at most been wounded. I find that in this game weapons accurate but with less dps need to be able to dispatch an opponent before he's able to respond to work well. An NS-11A is loved because you can easily chain headshots with it while staying on the move, eliminating an enemy very quickly without a significant reaction. However battle rifles are slow and tend to give far too much time to the opponent to react to them, especially if the user messes up a shot after the first or doesn't get 2 headshots asap.    Now, let's go onto the suggestion part. There are a couple of ways of approaching a theoretical buff to this category of weapons, imo.    The first is to make it closer to other long-range automatic options by improving their rof (from 333rpm to something like 400-450 at most) and making them fully automatic. As long as their recoil is kept higher than other autos (like the current 0.6 with 1x fsrm) i feel this would make them into more versatile weapons that shine in accuracy and power but that aren't easy to keep on target.  The second is to go more towards other semi-automatics like the scout rifles by improving their accuracy (to 0 again) and changing their damage curve; instead of going 250-225 it would go 300-225, which could allow BRs to gain a 2-headshot-kill at up to medium range, making them faster than the scout rifles at dispatching enemies who are within a certain range while keeping the scouts superior for more sniper-oriented work.    The second would probably be easier to implement due to being a simple damage change, but personally i'm more hoping for the first because it makes BRs a more palatable choice on all classes. A more ""snipey"" BR can work for engineers who already tend to shy away from the front of an assault, but for HAs or Medics it would be only used as a novelty or during the occasional AV Nest situation, those aren't classes suited for that kind of gameplay. Something more versatile would instead still be good to get extra range out of your engy while allowing Medics and HAs to remain closer to their usual roles in battle but with extra punch against ranged targets. I can kinda see a problem with BRs taking over long range ARs, but those are so versatile and easier to control that i don't find it a big possibility.  This is it, enjoy the wall of text <3"
Planetside,3druke,ChillyPhilly27,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:21:09 2015 UTC,I think they could use a slight velocity buff and a significant CoF bloom reduction.  Plus maybe one or two unique Battle-Rifle-only attachments.

In fact, what about a damage profile reversal? More damage at range, because rocket bullets that need to accelerate or something.  A dual-mode scope (reflex/4x) would also go a long way towards improving their versatility."
Planetside,3druke,kun4L,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:29:06 2015 UTC,"Lower FSRM, decreased CoF bloom per shot, increased bullet velocity, increased max damage range (probably to a point competitive with the AC-X11?), vertical-only recoil.  Other QoL features: better moving ADS CoF, 0.75x ADS movement. This makes it better as a counter-Infiltrator weapon and just a nicer gun to use overall."
Planetside,3druke,InMedeasRage,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:36:39 2015 UTC,Just do something about the scout rifle directive.  It's annoying to people who play a lot of infiltrator... I could literally complete that directive with nothing but scout rifles and still get a weapon that infil can't use.
Planetside,3druke,SpiroAgnewTR,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:18:00 2015 UTC,"There are at least 4 full auto NC weapons which have an initial ADS COF of zero. There's at least a dozen other full auto weapons which have ADS COF's smaller than the battle rifles, along with the blackhand.   Why is it that a supposed DMR has accuracy on par with guns like the orion, CARV, MSW-R, and Solstice? I'm literally better off tap firing a pulsar C than using a battle rifle"

Planetside,3druke,boobers3,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:25:38 2015 UTC,Moving COF and overall bloom is the worst feature IMO. The recoil and the low velocity/DPS is workable but stray shots on a rifle that arguably should be the most accurate weapon available to the Medic/Engie/Heavy is silly.  While no where near as important at it's accuracy it's weapon class and availability makes little sense. The Current BR is a direct downgrade over the Semi Auto Scouts on the infil and for some reason shares a directive tree with the scout rifles. I think merging Scouts and Battle rifles into one weapon tree making them all available to all classes while re-purposing the current BR so that it isn't a direct downgrade of the SASR and has it's own niche in the scout rifle tree.
Planetside,3druke,BlueberryFruitshake,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:09:03 2015 UTC,"Truthfully they're crap, absolute crap   Lower the bloom, lower the fsm, lower the recoil and boost the damage"

Planetside,3druke,1NieMamPomyslu1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:03:52 2015 UTC,IMO the bullet velocity is too low for battle rifles to be useful for regular infantry.
Planetside,3druke,P2-120_AP,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:56:06 2015 UTC,"I like the concept of them, but the fact that you can only 2 shot people up to 8m makes them feel very weak imo. I'd rather have a carbine, AR, or LMG than a battle rifle 9/10 times, and the 1/10 times I could just swap to playing infil.  Also the recoil on them is atrocious. For a precision weapon they're a pain in the arse to keep on target.  Overall I'd like to see the max damage range bumped out a bit and the recoil toned down. Currently there's no reason to use them outside of getting directives."
Planetside,3druke,Erendil,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:10:12 2015 UTC,the recoils fine with compensator and grip (and NO HV) but the COF is absurd. why would it have higher COF than the SAW is beyond me
Planetside,3druke,Joshua102097,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:43:03 2015 UTC,"What ABOUT battle rifles? They don't have much of anything going for them and they wear out my index finger. A buff to damage or COF would work wonders, right now I just can't be bothered to use them.  Battle rifles ought to feel powerful compared to assault rifles, and they really really don't."
Planetside,3druke,FuzzBuket,2,Sat Jul 18 23:49:47 2015 UTC,"Moving COF. It's terrible, and in ranges you would find yoursefl using one (50-70m is what I find the best for Warden) you absolutely need to keep strafing. I just think battle rifles and scout rifles should be in one category (DMRs), then buff BR's ROF and people who want more close range suitability will pick up battle rifles, and people who want to go for long range will pick up scouts. the only problem I can see with it, is Heavy's access to scouts. But since weapon availability when it comes to HA need serious rework (yes I mean cyclone) maybe take DMRs away from them."

Unless you're planning to release an NS battle rifle that capitalizes on this in the near future that is."
Planetside,3druke,FuzzBuket,3,Sat Jul 18 22:58:52 2015 UTC,"Not a fan.  I haven't exactly used them much, but after getting the scout rifle directive I figured I'd play with the reward a little bit.  They don't seem to offer any real advantage over anything else for medics or heavies, the extra reach is aright on an engineer I guess?  They're definitely worse than the scout rifles I used to get the directive reward.  So, look into that."
Planetside,3druke,NickaNak,-1,Sat Jul 18 23:37:21 2015 UTC,"On heavies, why use them when the Flare/TMG-50 do the job and can hold up in closer ranges?  On medics, the Corvus, CME, NS-11A, A-Tross, and TORQ fill the role excellently, and they can hold up at other ranges.  On Engineers, the only reason I'd engage at the range where the battle rifles work is because I'm supporting MAXes or vehicles. If I'm supporting MAXes or vehicles, there's enough ranged AI capability already. What we'd need is mid range MAX and vehicle deterrence. Therefore, I'd choose an Archer over the battle rifles. The Archer can function for contributing damage to soldiers at range, too. That means it totally eclipses the battle rifles in every category but close range hip fire spamming.  So, I don't see any point to the things."
Planetside,3druke,Armedine,-1,Sat Jul 18 23:53:57 2015 UTC,"I made a post about semi-auto sniper rifles a while back, detailing all of the problems I had with them. The battle rifles are rather similar to the semi-autos, so much of it is applicable here, as well. As a TL;DR, the weapons are too inaccurate to be a viable mid/long range weapon and too unwieldy to be viable as a mid/short range weapon. Pushing them to be more uniformly one or the other would increase their power within their niche without making them too powerful outside it.  Subtext: If you end up deciding to look into the battle rifles, please do the semi-auto snipers at the same time. DBG pls.  EDIT: -1 points, 0 comments. Please, if you disagree with me, let me know why.

Planetside,3druke,phukka,-1,Sat Jul 18 22:37:32 2015 UTC,"They're better than most players give them credit for.   They could use some tweaks though. Stand and especially Crouch ADS CoF could be reduced to ~0.05 down from 0.1 and horiz recoil should be fixed value so it's more consistent - from .18/.22 to .20 - and tolerance accordingly reduced from .5 to .4. And then let's go from there.  Also the Revenant does not benefit from a grip despite there being one on the model and having the equip time of a gripped BR. So either give it the grip benefit (it already has lower bullet velocity to make up for the No Bullet Drop) or remove the grip from the model and adjust the equip time accordingly. Oh, and the iron sights don't get removed when you put a scope on it (the Guardian and DMR both had the same bug)."

Hellfires are 400 with 300 RPM = 2000 DPS Photons are 475 with 253 RPM = 2003 DPS   So, Photons not only have less shots to kill, but also higher DPS (marginally, but still).

It just has different rules then all other guns in the game. You need to stand still and fire 2-3 shot bursts. Very high skill weapon.

Planetside,3dsmqy,DawnofWar11,2,Sun Jul 19 01:48:32 2015 UTC,I think this has the potential to be really good. But you need to seperate the vehicles from the infantry more efficient otherwise i guess would most of these vehicles that just capped a point start to farm infantry. And that wouldnt be nice. The easiest way to seperate them would propably walls like those around amp stations. The points itself could not only be something that reduces the time to actually cap the base but also something that opens more ways into the base. Ways like these garage like things you can find at some bases. They could be integrated into the wall closed with a shield that only defenders can pass. The points would make these shields disappear and you would gain more places to place sunderers from where infantry could start to attack the base itself. I would like to see a this kind of combined arms. Vehicles make the base attackable by infantry and the infantry captures the base without having to be afraid to get farmed by vehicles. My interpretation of your idea is of cause nothing that is easy to implement and has propably lots of mistakes im not thinking of but i like the idea to give vehicle users something to do as long as you make sure that they arent able to farm infantry after they completed their job.
Planetside,3dsmqy,TRSR_JANMID,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:08:07 2015 UTC,"This is also sounds very good - this would fit the support role of vehicles.  But I think you could add both. At some bases, where it makes sense, access points for vehicles to allow infantry to capture points, and at some bases points, which cut the timer. Because more speed = more flow.  If 3 of 4 points in e.g. Allatum are held, it's still 14 min to go, so that wouldn't be too short."
Planetside,3drj0k,PKwolf,7,Sat Jul 18 19:34:09 2015 UTC,Why do tracers have those weird... splash lines?
Planetside,3drj0k,Czarinov,10,Sat Jul 18 22:14:20 2015 UTC,"Also the VS and NC tracers look the exact same.   Can we please have Shredder/Drake tracers? We already have no ammo which has never been looked into because there are only like 5 Shredder gunners in existence.  Can we at least have one ""buff"" (that isn't really a buff)?"
Planetside,3drj0k,Brahmax,3,Sat Jul 18 19:41:21 2015 UTC,"No ammo along with removal of AoE was a deliberate nerf that was 'motivated' in the patch that gutted all lib guns. But yeah I agree the ammo nerf should be reverted, the AoE aswell imo. Even in its previous state most lib crews will prefer Dalton."
Planetside,3drj0k,qwedfgh,6,Sat Jul 18 19:47:10 2015 UTC,patch that gutted all lib guns   Don't forget non-AP tank cannons aswell.
Planetside,3drj0k,Scrinrusher,3,Sat Jul 18 19:49:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, might as well call it the 'welcome to infantryside' patch."
Planetside,3drj0k,qwedfgh,5,Sat Jul 18 19:53:18 2015 UTC,"oh I almost forgot....  In that same patch(with the tank cannons) they nerfed Rockets.  They even nerfed the NS Annihilator, a rocket that cannot be fired at infantry."
Planetside,3drj0k,Scrinrusher,4,Sat Jul 18 20:01:32 2015 UTC,"Well... you're wrong about splash. Giving us any AOE will lead to massive, massive death for infantry on a scale that non-Shredder gunners cannot even comprehend.  More ammo would be nice, but if they're retooling tracers, there's no reason the other tracer air weapons shouldn't be as well. Probably just an oversight, but sometimes DGC needs a reminder."
Planetside,3drj0k,Brahmax,3,Sat Jul 18 19:54:04 2015 UTC,"No one says it has to be a strong aoe. It could be like 20 damage. Just enough to have the default gun be at least a little useful against infantry so that newbs in default libs don't get discouraged.   There's no way a good player is going to miss so many shots that 20 splash damage would make a difference, but to some of the people I've let gun my lib, that would be the difference between a kill and zero damage when they somehow manage to whiff an entire shredder magazine trying to shoot a guy running around <100m below the lib."
Planetside,3drj0k,DeityFC,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:30:19 2015 UTC,"Well... you're wrong. Giving us any AOE will lead to massive, massive death for infantry on a scale that non-Shredder gunners cannot even comprehend.   Pre-nerfs I almost always flew with shredder, I know what it did to infantry. Even if it got the hugo ammo back there's almost zero reason to pick shredder over dalton (assuming a high skill gunner), it needs some AoE back, otherwise you pick Zephyr for AI farming and Dalton for everything else."
Planetside,3drj0k,qwedfgh,6,Sat Jul 18 19:58:01 2015 UTC,"Or, if you're not a god-tier dalton gunner, you still pick the shredder for AA duty.  But then, at this stage of the PS2 airgame, anyone who isn't god-tier at what they do have zero chances of survival, so I guess you are right."
Planetside,3drj0k,obuw,0,Sat Jul 18 20:03:01 2015 UTC,"For AA you just need to be 'decent' at dalton for it to beat shredder vs Libs/Galaxies imo, although I may be 'biased' by the high skill of most gunners in air at this stage, as you said. So the only real purpose of shredder is to kill ESFs when  you're not good enough with dalton or for longer range AA. Considering how much better dalton is versus ground vehicles as well I really think shredder needs some AI capabilities to compete, make shredder the jack of all trades as far as lib guns go."
Planetside,3drj0k,qwedfgh,2,Sat Jul 18 20:07:50 2015 UTC,"Indeed, I'm certainly not against giving shredder its splash radius back. I feel the nerf was completely uncalled for, as very few people even used the weapon to begin with."

Planetside,3drj0k,NerfDragonhawks,3,Sat Jul 18 20:58:12 2015 UTC,"The problem with VS tracers is that the contrast scales to the day/night cycle.  If you have them as a dark purple, it looks good in the day, but really hard to see at night.  And if you have it a light purple, easy to see at night, more difficult than day.  And even if you went a medium, there would still be plenty of instances where it's difficult to see regardless."

I cannot connect to DBG servers on my phone while connected through home WiFi, but turning phone's WiFi off allowed access through 3g data. Clearly the problem is 'upstream' from the device-router connection. Could be router, could be ISP. Curiously, when I tried to confirm my ISP and exchange, I found that www.speedtest.net was also inaccessible, though I could reach it from my phone's 3g capability.  Enter phone tethering. Stuffed around for a bit, never having done this before, eventually got my PC running off phone's 3g via a WiFi tether. And whaddya know, now that the router/ISP is bypassed it all works. DBG.com loads, launcher loads, game loads, but of course actual gameplay is next to impossible.  Dear Talan:  My router is Netcomm ADSL2+ WiFi n300 Gateway. My ISP is TPG, and I believe my connection is through the Swanbank Telstra exchange in South East QLD."

The Bolt Driver-equivalent M77-B/XM98 were only 100 certs, so you could pick them up quickly.  There was also a beginner's quiz that allowed you to pick a weapon, one of which was the CQC bolt action SAS-R/TSAR/Ghost.  In other words, the imbalance was there for about 10 minutes until the quiz popped up.  Now, all those quicky solutions are gone thanks to the DBC revamp.  No more newb quiz, and the starter bolts are now jacked up to 325 certs.  While 325 is a simple three-level jump with the new character bonus certs, it's 325 that the NC snipers don't have to spend."
Planetside,3dqhof,UGoBoy,16,Sat Jul 18 15:56:37 2015 UTC,Infiltrators should not even start with a sniper rifle. They should start with the auto scout rifle. It is a better weapon for the class and actually endorses Infiltrators be useful to the team as opposed to all sitting huddled behind a rock 200 meters away missing most of their shots anyway and not really doing a whole lot of anything
Planetside,3dqhof,CheloniaMydas,3,Sat Jul 18 21:18:18 2015 UTC,"I don't totally disagree, but I also don't totally agree either.  The auto scout is a very skill-heavy weapon because of the low DPS and short magazine.    What I would like to see most is for everyone to get the low-scope semis or semi scouts as starter weapons.  Then buff the velocity of the high-scope semis considerably.  It would give the infil a good most-range weapon while also making the semis more interesting."
Planetside,3dqhof,UGoBoy,6,Sun Jul 19 02:30:48 2015 UTC,"You summed it up pretty good. Back when the TR/VS bolt actions were cheap, you could just spend a little time grinding people out and then grab one really quickly. 325 certs is a LOT more, and like you said, the NC's lack of having to spend it means they come out on top."

Planetside,3dqhof,thesmarm,9,Sat Jul 18 14:05:53 2015 UTC,The advantage of the SR-7 is you spend less time rechambering the next bullet compared to the RAMS. I personally prefer the SR-7 for this.

Planetside,3dqhof,tim-o-matic,4,Sat Jul 18 16:58:57 2015 UTC,"thing is for beginners its extremely hard to use BASRs up close and they are forced to buy another weapon if they want to start earning some certs without sitting on a hill. this is made worse by the TR/VS infiltrators getting the worst guns ingame as starting weapons.  full auto scouts fit the bill of starting weapons: versatile, not too hard to learn how to use. you can then specialize into long range (BASR, 375c for the cheapest) mid range (scout rifle/low zoom semi sniper) or short range (SMG) as you prefer."
Planetside,3dqhof,Dark_Jinouga,2,Sat Jul 18 17:04:30 2015 UTC,"Id keep it as stalker, pistol and EMPs as default with BASR as alternate. The point of infil is not so much to frag/kill as it is to be support - emp, recon, hacking. Stalker emphasizes the support and survivability portions. BASR gives them some killing potential for simple fun. Then, when they want to spec in killing power, they do as you say - smgs, scouts, other basrs as they see fit."
Planetside,3dqhof,tim-o-matic,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:12:40 2015 UTC,"interesting view, also sounds good.  issue is the pistols though. at least for the VS (on PS4) the beamer is utter horseshit, mainly due to its low damage and RoF thats extremely hard to maintain on consoles. Im still all for the full auto scout rifle though, as starting with them and then getting a BASR is a lot cheaper then the other way around (and they would be infinitely better then the starting weapons VS/TR get atm, as well as balance out all 3 factions on the infiltrator starting standpoint. getting a BASR as NC is just an unfair advantage IMO)"
Planetside,3dqhof,Dark_Jinouga,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:31:15 2015 UTC,"Beg to differ, 3 beamer headshots is a kill. By far my favourite default pistol, and the best non-revolver pistol because of its irons (essentially a dot sight), excellent RoF, excellent damage, good mag size, and best in class hipfire.

Planetside,3dqhof,PigOverloard,3,Sat Jul 18 15:34:10 2015 UTC,"Have you tried out the KSR? It's the same damage model as our starting rifle, but it can use low-power optics.

Such is life.        I like to engage targets at closer ranges and there are a lot more moving targets than standing still ones, so the semi auto fire helps with that. I know people actually try to improve their aim to headshot moving targets, but what can I say, I find repeated fire to be more reliable at something like 40 meters.  At the end of the day, I think it's much more about playstyles than what's better or worse, but that's just me."

Planetside,3dqhof,elusiveone2007,4,Sun Jul 19 00:06:45 2015 UTC,"NC get the Bolt Driver by default, which is the Tier 1 bolt-action sniper rifle. The TSAR is a CQC bolt-action rifle, which takes lower power scopes and has no scope sway.  Generally, the CQC rifles are better than the T1 rifles, because you can use the CQC ones to pretty damn good range and past that you're better off with a high end T3 rifle (for TR, that would be the RAMS).   P.S. - Is it normal to love the TSAR? I almost feel guilty because it drops enemies so fast. Maybe I'm just not used to the OHK mechanic for some weird reason (wink wink), but it feels great.    Close range sniping is fun as hell, but generally requires you to have pretty good twitch reflexes and not miss a shot if the enemy is already shooting. Resist-shielded Heavy Assaults can tank a point blank headshot and keep shooting, moreso if they start chugging medkits, so watch for those.   P.P.S. - I am by no standards an experienced sniper, so I would just like to state that my opinions have not come from thousands of hours of MLG gameplay. I also have not extensively used the NC's default sniper rifle, so it might have downsides that I am not aware of.   Only downsides to the T1 rifles is having to manage scope sway and learning what distance you stop being able to one-shot-kill enemies at. Bullet drop is noticeable but not severe unless you attach a suppressor in which case you might as well be lobbing water balloons.   P.P.P.S. - PLZ DEVS WHY DO NC GET THE BEST DEFAULT RIFLE   Ancient hold-over of NC's ""higher damage, lower fire rate"" traits. When the default kits were made, the only thing that could be given to the NC other than the semi auto rifles was the slower, harder hitting bolt action.   EDIT: A question for TR snipers: do the M77-B and SR-7 have any advantages over the Rams .50? I am debating over what rifle I should get next.   Not a TR sniper, but to answer your question the M77-B is the cheapest (Tier 1) 6x+ bolt action rifle and the SR-7 is the Tier 2 rifle, if I remember correctly. The only advantage they have over the Tier 3 (the RAMS) is refire and reload speed, which is usually inconsequential for distance sniping, so go for the RAMS- T3 rifles have the fastest projectile velocity and highest damage of the purchasable non-empire-specific sniper rifles, beat only by NC's unique Railjack and the directive reward sniper rifles in terms of damage and velocity."
Planetside,3dqhof,thesmarm,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:53:51 2015 UTC,Those faction traits. are they still a thing that DGC wants to be a thing?   Seems like a lot of stuff has been homogenized to the same for balance.

I think all infiltrators should begin the game with access to both the semi-auto and the bolt-action rifles.   If the semi-auto rifles are to stay as they are, they should not be starter weapons. The 1x-4x ones should be starter weapons (to compliment the starter bolt-action rifles).  I believe if scope sway was completely removed from the high-mag semi-auto rifles, they would still not be overpowered by any means, and they would finally find a use as niche weapons with clear pros and cons."

I can comfortably use it at 50m and still tag out to 250m.  If I know i'll be on a cliff or something, I'll bring my directive or tier 3 rifle out.

The default 6x-12x scope semi-autos (useless):   99SV, VA39 Spectre, Gauss SPR The 'default' 6x-12x scope bolt-actions (are great):   M77-B, XM98, NC14 Bolt Driver The closer range 1x-4x scope semi-autos (sort of a less-good scout rifle):   KSR-35, Phantom VA23, Impetus and the closer range 1x-4x scope bolt-actions (are great):  TSAR-42, Ghost, SAS-R   I think ideally all infiltrators should start with the 2nd or 4th class of sniper rifles, so they can actually snipe effectively; and should also start with the full-auto scout rifles (SOAS-20, Artemis VX26, AF-18 Stalker) to introduce new players to the close-to-medium-range playstyle for infiltrators."

Also, I like Smedley, but whenever he gives out a date, don't take it seriously. Like, at all. It might happen, but it certainly won't happen whenever he says so. A lot of other bugs have been fixed in the meantime. The standing of current bugs is inevitable. They will be fixed. In time. Hopefully soon, but who knows. I like to keep my expectations low so that I am happily surprised every time. I'm not sure I understand what you mean here with the vehicle info. Again, they have to allocate dev resources to fix stuff currently. I'm pretty sure that they also don't want to repeat the same mistake made in SOE where they put out a fancy roadmap, and 70% of that stuff never made it past the concept phase.

Planetside,3dpx9k,st0mpeh,3,Sat Jul 18 12:28:45 2015 UTC,"yeah i had to, had only fragged ~200 ppl since launch before directives, you need to recognise when spam time is and make sure youre in your bandoleer loadout as much as possible when that happens, itll be a super long time throwing single frags, thats for sure.  Nanite subterranian analysis (aka, the pit of spam) on amerish is named that for a reason, if there is ever a fight there rush to throw nades at the hole, doesnt matter if defending or attacking, it just means throwing at a different hole, doesnt matter if frag or sticky, just means a different approach, different angle, more risk.  Otherwise use rangefinder implant, get ~50m from a sundy, throw throw throw....and when its busy throw them all, one or two are far less likely, #3 and #4 are the kill getters (if there are kills to be got).  Always load up your bando guy at a terminal when you have 750 resource to put 4 in the pocket for later, consider buying a few months of membership, the extra resource lengthens your spam window as well as shortens your downtime but either way when you do inevitably run out, switch to something like a medic, throw no nades and help up the other spammers while you resources regen.  Any close in-base fight can be great but those moments are fleeting so all u can do is get boosted and just carry the bando all the time, redeploy to frame crushers with a static infantry standoffs, remember the good spots and keep throwing!

Planetside,3dqtoj,lespretend,15,Sat Jul 18 22:04:29 2015 UTC,"If you are NC don't listen to these shits.  This post may seem a bit like bitter sarcasm but it's how the Max suit is designed and it definitely works for me.  If you know what you are doing you can easily get 80+ KDR in a max suit as AI MAX or pull you max to guarantee charge revenge on a specific enemy before you die.   I always have my load outs set up as the following:  First slot:  Grinder - Extended Mags (close range) Mattock - NO EXTENDED MAGS (longer range)  People are stupid and go ""WHY NOT EXTEND BOTH!"".  One arm is enough to instakill someone with a headshot up close.   Seriously, Think. Other than enemy maxes, there is no target that requires that you fully dump 2 arms of extended mags.  2 arms always synced is overkill and then they are stuck reloading both arms while the enemy is shooting back.  You want asynchronous reloads when you are firing both arms so that there is little to no downtime between each arm reload and you don't have to think hard about what arms is shooting what or how much ammo you have.   I would recommend that you always reload before engaging an enemy max, but once you are within 5 meters and full health you (the NC MAX) always win regardless of ammo unless he has friends and you don't.  Shoot the head.  Always use charge.  Being able to quickly run away like a little school girl from any danger is a total god-send.  Even if you aren't hit yet, if you see a squad of enemy HA's running in your direction it's far better to get a head start and try to find a position where you can take the out one at a time or your teammates can engage them.  Running away from C4 before they can detonate it is also amazing.  Never use charge to get closer to the enemy UNLESS they are completely alone and you don't expect to see anyone for a good half a minute.  Charge is part of your strong defensive abilities that can on occasion be used offensively (also good for dodging rockets from a HA if you charge them, but don't waste it!  It is better to run away from a mob and live to fight another day then to kill only 1 person!).  Scares the shit out of people from what they /tell me.  Flack Armor and Kenetic Armor AI max is for teamwork and squad drops.  You have to rely on other people to repair you which is worthless in most other cases.  Flack Armor might save you if you are blind and can't see C4 or are godawful at dodging rockets, but 2 decimators will still kill you and the other rockets barely don't.  If you are being hit by 2 rockets so quickly you are either out of position, wasted your charge on shit, or bad at dodging.   If you are going to max solo, ALWAYS use Auto-Repair and keep a safe-erish area in mind that you can fall back to on.  To serpantine and dodge shit, press D and look to the right then press A and look to the left repeat.    Always wear explosives implant.  There is no excuse for you to be running into a C4 or tank mine trap.  My other slots have like the same setup only Kenetic to charge into enemies and suicide kill that one person I don't like who is using max and doesn't have a medic with them or  busters and full flack, or ravens and full flack.  All load outs have charge, the shield is WORTHLESS.  Only pull bursters or ravens if you have access to a terminal within 150 meters.  And now you know exactly why I think the max suit is an OP awful game ""class"".  But whatever you can play however you want.  I have the most fun with my max setup."

Planetside,3dqtoj,obuw,5,Sat Jul 18 16:02:26 2015 UTC,"I really shouldn't be encouraging another NC to pick up a MAX suit... but sigh, here we go. (at least I hope you don't play on Cobalt :P)  Like the other people I recommend flak armor. You will at least be able to survive a single C4 brick. And hopefully eventually (say, in 3 years) it'll start reducing tank mine damage as well.  Against aircraft, you really shouldn't have much trouble. As a rule of thumb, always stick to cover, keep moving, strafe while firing, and play with a maxed out minimap. Most good ESF farmers have typical flight patterns and habits, e.g. there are common approach paths where airhammer farmers like to fly below radar and come up at the last second, while many banshee farmers like to dive straight down from flight ceiling.  Against vehicles, it depends a lot on the weapon, but as a general rule of thumb you should hide like a little girl and only shoot when they aren't looking your way. Most tank users nowadays have been using those weapons for millenia and can consistently land direct hits on you with 100% accuracy even from 200m+ away, so make sure you don't give them that chance. Or you can abuse things like render distance to shoot stuff from 400m away using ravens.  Against infantry, well it's pretty simple. Just stick to tight enclosed spaces, and camp in safe spots like a pro mlg champ, always have enough health to survive a rocket / c4, and charge back to safety immediately when you fall below the threshold. You should have no trouble keeping a 40:1 KDR in a biolab if you play like a pansy."

Planetside,3dqtoj,GamerDJ,4,Sat Jul 18 17:06:50 2015 UTC,"There's a large cert investment to get your MAX up and running. If you're going NC MAX, Mattocks with extended mags and slugs are a pretty good choice. They'll give you decent AI range without sacrificing much of your insanely good CQC abilities. I'm a fan of the longest range weapons on all three though (Blueshifts for VS, Mercies for TR, all with extended mags).   Maxed out flak armor is definitely a must. The better you get at positioning and health management, the more likely it is that someone with explosives will be the one to take you out so nanoweave isn't really ideal. Auto-repair can be nice but you'll end up wasting a lot of your time crouched in a corner or a spawn room waiting for it to finish since it leaves you so much more vulnerable to taking damage in the first place. If you don't have engineer support, you're not going to last long in any big fight anyway. Spam V3 for all it's worth and if you die, do your part and come back as an engineer sometimes if there's a lot of other MAXes doing the same.  I haven't tried Aegis much but it does look kind of cool. More useful than ZOE, not as powerful offensively but way less situational than Lockdown. Charge is always useful though. It's usually best used as an escape tool (once you get down below half health or start getting hit by a heavy weapon of any kind). If you use it to charge towards the enemy, you'll often find yourself unable to get back to friendlies before you die.   There are some weapons (like Airhammer) that might not give you time to activate it before dying, depending on latency, but if your reflexes are good you usually have a chance to at least throw off their aim. Most burster work should be done from near the spawn room or a building to retreat to if need be, otherwise a group of air focused on taking out all AA sources can squish you pretty fast.  As for AV work, be aware that though you do a lot of damage, especially from the rear, but you're much more fragile than the tank. Try and mitigate this by using cover, popping out long enough to do some damage, then hiding once they see you and return fire. When going up against other MAXes, keep in mind that AV will beat AI most of the time. An AI NC MAX with extended mags can one clip you but with proper range management and aim, you can still beat him with most AV weapons.   Last thing I can think of to mention is to pay attention to all those ways people take you out, learn from them and use them when you're not playing MAX. A lot of people who don't play MAXes because they think they're a skill-less ""easy mode"" are a lot worse at taking them out than people that do because they haven't spent enough time learning their weaknesses the hard way. Don't fall into the other trap of thinking they're too OP because you play them a lot and can get 50+ killstreaks with them. Playing cautiously enough to get those kind of killstreaks is way less useful to your team than leading the charge towards an objective, getting 8-10 kills and dying in a hail of bombs and bullets."

Planetside,3dqtoj,florbagast,2,Sun Jul 19 16:03:31 2015 UTC,"I've left some similar replies in threads like this before, but I'll just repeat myself.  If you want to use the MAX effectively, remember not to overextend yourself in big fights, especially if you're playing solo. If you have friends playing, make sure one of them is an engineer and keeps you repaired, you'll be infinitely more powerful. Rank 1 flak armour will keep you alive from surprise bricks of C4 and is also useful now that tank mines are triggered by MAXes. I don't think Flak protects from direct rocket or tank shell hits, though, or AV grenades that get stuck to you. Kinetic armour is also a powerful option, and I always use it whenever I expect to fight a lot of infantry. The effects are only really noticeable at the third level or higher, and it's expensive to fully upgrade, but an extra 6000 health is nothing to stick your nose up at. To start out, stick with the first rank of Flak, then move to Kinetic once you've got it to rank 3 or 4. If you plan on using MAXes a lot, you want those suit slots maxed out regardless, but you have to start somewhere.  Try not to stick out in the open too long. MAXes will be quickly whittled down from sustained fire from multiple people. This goes double for NC MAXes, since their lethal range is shorter than the other factions. The high accuracy/range AI weapons are some of the best investments you can make for a MAX (Mattock/Blueshift/Mercy). They let you reach out and make friends at much safer distances, and you can land consistent headshots at closer ranges, which drastically lowers TTK. Indoor fights are your best friend, but you should still be careful. If someone comes around a corner, sees you, then runs back, don't chase them right away. Players used to fighting MAXes will usually put down a C4 trap, so always check doorways and corners, and try not to rush into a new area unless you need to. I don't have any experience with the Aegis shield, but from what I've heard, it doesn't provide as much protection as it should. It's still effective for blocking chokepoints or fighting other MAXes, but not for much else. Putting certs into a few ranks of Charge can always be useful, it will usually get you out of immediate danger, but you want to be in a safe place when it runs out, especially if you have low health.  Until you feel much more comfortable in a MAX, avoid using one of each weapon type. An unskilled MAX with one AV and one AI arm won't be effective against either. Stick to specializing with two of each weapon type. AV weapons are usually required to deal with an enemy MAX, but two of the NC shotguns will tear through enemy MAXes at close range. The Hacksaws are brutal anti-MAX weapons. For the TR and VS MAXes, if you're fighting another MAX and don't have AV equipped, always go for headshots. They do actually do more damage."
Planetside,3dqtoj,sumguy720,2,Sat Jul 18 20:26:56 2015 UTC,"Considering FLAK doesn't help with direct shoulder-fired hits and isn't strong enough to make Tank Mines survivable, I'd suggest going kinetic armor. Clear doorways and blind-spots as fast as you can (Charge is preferable to lockdown for AI work by far) and just keep stacking up kills. You rely on friendlies for repairs / revives, but you shouldn't have much trouble mowing through infantry between repairs.   Lockdown is really only useful for clearing sunderers, bad tank commanders, and ESF. Libs will kill you if you sit still for too long, considering how little bursters do to libs, and any decent tank commander will pick you off if you try to sit there and go head to head.   One nice thing about the pounders is that they arc, so you can lob shots over a cliff edge / wall while being clear of their direct line of fire."

The VS zealot overdrive is worthless, the TR anchor mode is situational and only good if you're not being shot at,  and the NC shield is pretty useful.  I like having a max that can sprint when needed.  It will be the difference between life and death.   If you're going solo,  regen armor is useful.   Don't go solo.  Find an engi to be your best friend, add flak armor, and youre going to do just fine.   It's worth noting that maxes are much more  vulnerable these days.   You can get owned in 2-4 shots by one guy with an archer, and you also need to be aware of anti vehicle mines"
Planetside,3dqtoj,Dunamisbeam,2,Mon Jul 20 13:00:58 2015 UTC,"It can be tempting to soak damage with reckless abandon as a max since you have so much health. I treat damage the same way as a max as I treat it as normal infantry. If I take a bullet or two I get to cover as quickly as I can.   Also I try to stay back from doorways. Once the enemies know where you are you are going to want to make it hard for them to hit you, but if you just stand next to the door it's going to be a cakewalk for them.  Finally, for AI I equip different guns on each arm. I have the high accuracy on one arm and the default on the other. This naturally leads to asynchronous reloads (due to ROF and mag size) and gives me a more even DPS over a wider set of ranges."

You will survive at least 2-4 dumbfires. *  ^ Edit: In my experience. People say this doesn't actually protect against the rocket, but the splash damage it inflicts afterwards  Now that tank mines trigger on maxes, flak armor is more useful than ever. 1 brick of C4 won't kill you if you run maximum flak.  Charge is a good option, but I run nearly full ZOE. I find the TTK on a max is a bit too low for my playstyle, so I use it.   Close quarters, scatterguns or whatever shotgun you want for an NC is ridiculous.  VS use Quasar double, Blueshift double, or Nebula double. I use a Quasar and a Blueshift.  ZOE and double comets you will decimate tanks close up.  No earthly clue how to cert into a TR max. :(  GL"

And is the shield a charge-based thing like Resist shield where it just runs out after a while? Or does it completely absorb damage that drains it too? EDIT: I looked online for this and couldn't find much.
Planetside,3dqtoj,ChillyPhilly27,3,Sat Jul 18 17:04:36 2015 UTC,"It completely absorbs damage and ""breaks"" when depleted, just like a HA overshield. This might be wrong, just in my experience this is how it works I guess. You can unload your weapons, start reloading, and switch to your shield. While you are shielding your weapons are still reloading, so you can unequip shield to find a full clip.  I think charge is probably better solo, but in a group, aegis shields are pretty good for point holds.  My most used weapon is probably a lasher. Having an Aegis shield max w/ maximum flak armor, will take me upwards of 100 rounds to kill you. That is a direct counter to the weapon, and a HA in general.  Mostly if you use an Aegis shield, you are taunting enemies into attacking you, so your allies can flank."

Figure out what works best for: Point Holds, Point Crashes, AV and AA. Each requires a different load out, has different strengths. That said, while playing, you also have to remember the MAXs key weakness - speed, or lack thereof. Charge helps, but it is limited use and a fairly slow recharge.   So, like any force multiplier, they work best when coordinating with the rest of your squad or barring that the rest of your faction within the hex."

Planetside,3drmqb,Mytiske,7,Sat Jul 18 20:15:06 2015 UTC,"currently have over 400 kills with it so i've kinda learned its strengths and weaknesses over time.  the Archer is great for taking out Maxes and that's its primary role. noob Max users dont expect it to have such an amazing punch so if you see Maxes who stand in the open for too long and dont move, always go for the head since it decreases TTK drastically.   advanced Max users (recognizable by their ADADAD movement, camo and armor cosmetic) require a bit more finesse to defeat. from far away, you definitely need support to take him down since one Archer hit will only wound him if he has full health and then he will dive into cover to get repaired. never try to headshot a moving Max as it isnt worth the miss, better land a less damaging hit than no hit.   the best opportunity to kill a Max is if he is running for cover or charges away, that usually means he is critically damaged so a takedown is easy. if a dead Max that is being revived is in your clear line of sight, always go for a shot right as he stands up since this will always give you a(nother) kill. also if an NC Max activates Aegis dont be hesitant to shoot it as it will still deal solid damage.  apart from that if you see a burning vehicle very very far away, dont hesitate to give it a shot. i killed entire vanguard and liberator crews who didnt expect to get sniped by an AMR from 400+ meters away. the Archer is amazing at what it does but it's terrible against infantry. however, if you still want to ""farm"" (lol) infantry kills with it look for an opportunity where:    lots of enemy infantry are at one spot and the direction they are coming from is predictable infiltrators with snipers wont countersnipe you so easily teammates are between you and the enemy to soak up the primary damage you're otherwise safe from vehicle interference since tunnel vision makes you very vulnerable   situations like these are pretty rare. but whenever i've found them they netted me ""quite"" some Archer kills. dont fool yourself though, the Archer is NOT a gun to have amazing killstreaks with. and it's NOT a weapon to charge into battle with. if you need a challenge, try killing enemies with this gun. dont come here to tell us the gun sucks though, we warned you! ;)"

If he's running for cover and being repaired, he's not wrecking your team.

Planetside,3drmqb,iAmQuantum,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:53:06 2015 UTC,"For Vanu, I'd recommend the Commissioner. If you can consistently land double headshots, it can consistently take down hostiles in close range even from the front. Watch the mag size, though. It'll give you three kills with headshots, 2 kills with no misses.  Edit, I should note that the Underboss can theoretically get the same performance as a Commissioner in close quarters, with a faster refire rate and tighter hip fire. However, I find the Underboss most useful when I get jumped while vulnerable and need to spam hip fire in hopes of killing only one target. If I'm running secondary as primary, as you should when you're using an Archer, I prefer the greater reach of the Comish and ADS with it."
Planetside,3drmqb,Jyk7,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:59:11 2015 UTC,"Commissioner/Underboss is never wrong but i for one prefer the Spiker (VS burstfire sidearm) which has great damage output at closequarters and is a good ""panic"" weapon when someone manages to surprise you around a corner"

Planetside,3drmqb,pulley999,4,Sat Jul 18 22:14:56 2015 UTC,"This. When you think about it, it's a weapon purpose-built for tankers and other vehicle operators.  Who suffers the worst from long-distance MAX cheese spam? Tankers.  What class is a tanker most likely to be? Engineer.  Do tankers often find themselves out of their metal chariots when engaging infantry? No. No need for a competitive primary.  The Archer was specifically designed as a way for armor players to counter long-range MAX AV, but most players take it as face value as being for an Engineer infantry player where it comes off as expensive gimmickry."

Unless you have tons of surplus certs its probably not worth the purchase right now over other critical things.  If you were spending DBC$$ because you have money to burn and are looking for something fun and different, then go nuts.

I'm slowly working towards the Archer auraxium (only got about 980 kills to go...), and I find most nights my weapon kills are something like this:  For every 1 Archer kill, I get 3-4 pistol kills, and 2-3 sticky nade kills. It also encourages you to use your personal turrets, and I will often get just as many turret kills as I do Archer.  As such, the Archer is a fantastic weapon when you want to work towards auraxiuming everything else the engineer has. Just accept that you will be taking a hit with your combat ability."

Planetside,3drmqb,StillMostlyClueless,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:52:39 2015 UTC,"its mostly a toy, and not a very fun toy unless you have a vendetta against MAXes  so many engineers will plink away at vehicles as if they think they're actually doing something, or that they might actually be helping, but it really isn't, they'd be 10x more of a threat to simply deploy an AV mana turret because that is actually a credible threat, most vehicles can pretty much straight up ignore ignore a single Archer (flashes and ESFs might have to be a bit concerned, solo Harassers as well).  its most effective/fun when used en masse with coordinated focus fire, but the same could be said for just about any similarly niche weapon, such as lock-on RLs, etc...  other than killing MAXes you might be fortunate enough to kill steal juicier targets like burning Liberators/tanks, etc, but that requires some pretty dedicated play that could very well be more punishing than it is rewarding  and considering how new you're likely to be considering PS2 for PS4 is still very new, you're probably much better off spending any money or certs elsewhere before spending on the Archer"

Redeploy hopping has always been, and still is, the fastest way to get from fight to fight, and it never takes more than three hops for me to get to where I want to be, when I want to be there.  You can hit the 'U' redeploy key as soon as the loading screen starts too, and you will hear the redeployment alarm sound effect.  Doing this will cut your redeployment hop time in half.  It sucks that the mechanics are poorly designed in this way, but if you don't currently know how to redeploy hop, and refuse to learn, then you are effectively nerfing yourself and your team."

The longer your whole group spends at WG the more time they aren't fighting, and the more time your front lines are short reinforcements.  All that is needed is for at least one Gal per squad that everyone else can directly spawn into while it is on its way to combat.  The only other people who need to meet the Gals is anyone pulling a Max unit.  WG isn't the only place to pull a Gal either, and I often see newer or bad PLs calling for gal pulls from WG when any Tech plant or Towered base will do, and are closer to the action.  There was a time when people needed to regroup at the WG, but that time is gone now, and now it's a mark of a bad or new leader."

The revive one is a horrible idea, see sparks in Dirty Bomb, and how horrendously op her revive gun is... being able to revive from range and perfect safety (out of LOS of hostiles, but in LOS of friendlies) is bad enough in DB where downed players can be finished and made impossible to revive, but in planetside where people can be revived infinitely without a mechanic to prevent the revive, this would be stupidly broken.

Planetside,3dqc2r,enenra,17,Sat Jul 18 17:12:42 2015 UTC,"Good luck!  Koreans, if you want to participate in server smashes, join Briggs after your server shuts down. Briggs server smash teams have a lot of open spots.  Briggs has a very high concentration of experienced infantry players.   Playing on Briggs during the evening is the closest thing to fighting in a Server Smash match. In every fight there will be BR100 players on your team and on the opposition. Often, there will be squads of BR100 players in each fight. Fights are fast paced, and a variety of tactics are used. Want proof? The recursion hardmode leaderboard is dominated by Briggs players, showing we have a very high concentration of veterans."

Their air force was very deadly and outnumbered us, but they stayed grouped up and we were able to work around them to complete a few objectives. Once you could lure a couple away from their air ball they were pretty susceptible to the peel: they would get so focused on going for the kill they weren't noticing the trap they were flying into.   They were also utilizing their higher lag to their favor by sticking with the Vortek and doing better burst damage. (Not a complaint, just an observation of them playing smart).  Towards the end we decided to just pull some walker harasser and have fun, rather than lose esf after ESF next to their warp gate."

Planetside,3dscao,AngerMacFadden,9,Sun Jul 19 00:52:59 2015 UTC,"Things that I thought were neat, but were nerfed/limited/removed.   Defending the continent tag:  Before continent locking and even before alerts the first meta involved capping a whole continent for no other benefit than bragging rights.  Once you locked the continent by grabbing every territory, it would have your factions tag on it even though you could still fight there.  The only way for the other factions to remove your tag was if they took all your territory.  This led to great lasting stands defending Scared Mesa Skydock on Mattherson Indar.  Over 2k players in one hex crashed the server more than once. Cross continental facility alerts:  Leaders had to call everyone to this continent or that.  Ghost capping with a small group to get adjacency to the next facility gave everyone a role.  It was impossible to not participate in the alert, only participate poorly.  It was especially fun when Amerish didn't yet have lattice and that's where most facility alerts were won or lost. Pre-lattice in general:  The lattice was designed to address the ghost capping issue, but like most of the games ""fixes"" it's a band aid when surgery was needed.  Several features of territory capture were better when they were more complex in my opinion, although I totally understand why they were changed.   The Hex system:  Anywhere that touched would let you start the cap so many of the choke point farmy bases weren't the problem they are.  This did lead to lots of small groups and solo players going to empty bases, but it gave a lot more strategic options too. Territory influence:  The more territory you owned touching a base, the faster it would cap.  I liked this a lot, but it was removed to make the cap timers more standard so people could mount appropriate counter attacks.  I still think it was more interesting when it was more dynamic.  It gave reason to surround, and not let your stuff get surrounded. Control point Influence:  This was also removed to make the cap timers more standardized, but it encouraged either 2/2 at three points or 6/6 as single points, to make the territory cap faster.  The Resource system:  While I'm glad the timers were removed, having different resources and resource incomes gave a slight reason to fight over particular territories.  It also encouraged resource rotation, and higher BR players would give their stuff to lower rank players who didn't yet have vehicles certed.  The timers and different resources also made killing enemy feel more valuable because you knew they couldn't just pull another whatever you killed instantly.  It made pilots and drivers better as well when they knew they had to ration and place a higher value on staying alive. Facility Outposts:  Biolabs, Techplants, and Amp stations used to have small outpost bases with a capture point that would flip instant control with cap timer in a similar way to how the capture points at new style amp stations grant a spawn.  These outposts are where the original teleporters were to the biolabs, and would allow an attacking faction from any direction to gain access to all the external teleporters if they held all the outposts.  Outposts would allow attackers to completely surround facilities with spawns, and provided extra interesting objectives. Original ZOE:  Yes it was overpowered, but man was it fun and missed.  Current ZOE is by far the least useful of all the Max abilities.  Manuverability OP and that's the basic design flaw with ZOE, and why it was abused so much when it was awesome.  ZOE max going backwards with strafe could outpace an infantry sprinting forwards. Original Galaxy carry and Galaxy bridging:  It used to be very easy to carry ground vehicles on top of a Gal and get them to interesting places.  There were also times where Gals were used as mobile bridges in the Indar Canyons.  I always felt that this nerf was a nerf to fun.   Original flash super turbo and jump distances:  Another nerf to fun, the original flash turbo would let you fly to some crazy places. Back hack flank spawning:  This has more recently been removed because of the squad spawn limitations.  It basically involved hacking a vehicle terminal behind the enemy front lines and deploying an AMS as close as possible to the hacked vehicle terminal.  Then you would spawnvertise and have the whole squad or platoon spawn in and pull vehicles from an advantageous flanking position.  Hit the enemy from behind where they aren't all set up to farm you. WG nesting:  This is another thing made much more difficult for leaders to do, to the point where it isn't really done much anymore.  Spawn beacons and other squad spawns would be used to run AA and AV far away from capable territories to farm enemy vehicle kills and overall piss off the enemy factions. Steel Rain:  Squad deploy and Instant action used to be much more viable, and using them would spawn you in drop pod style.  Drop pods used to come down slightly slower and allow you to guide them into air and ground vehicles to kill them.  Whole platoons could coordinate their drops together and the mass of drop pods was known as steel rain.  This was a nerf to fun because team work tactics OP. Mid air ADS:  LA could aim down scope when in the air, HA could bail from an ESF and lock on in mid air, or fire aimed rockets while in the middle of a jump pad jump. Viable A2G on the Lib:  The duster is still broken bad and isn't ever likely to be improved.  When the shredder had splash it was awesome. I'm glad that the original striker was removed so the NC and VS could have air groups.  I would be for the striker buffs because they are deserved, but the TR DGAF about ZOE, so I DGAF about their striker complaints. The thing I miss the most is the hope for and anticipation of things to come:  I believed for a long time this game would have a leadership experience at least as enjoyable as BF2 was, but I realize how foolish that expectation was now.  It's apparent that the Devs don't care about leadership at all, and make more money from directive grinders than they do from objective teamer players."

Planetside,3drs7k,DracoAdvigilat,5,Sat Jul 18 20:55:43 2015 UTC,"EMP grenades are nice because they take away effectively half HP of an opponent (or yourself) via downing shields.  I believe this downs a heavy assault's overshields as well.  You can also get a knife that once switched on does 1,000 damage, and is an instakill to most classes. However, these emit a fair amount of noise, but aren't really noticeable in large scale fights with lots of movement and distractions.  Infiltrators have numerous playstyles, ranging from stalker cloak (if you stop moving your cloak recharges, cannot equip a primary), to the basic cloak and a nano-mesh cloak.  SMGs are nice, scout rifles are sort of like battle rifles, except they are automatic.  Personally I play as a Bandolier Stalker, running 3 emp grenades, a Blackhand pistol (comes with 4x scope), and motion darts.   The way I play with this loadout is totally NOT a viable option for a stealthy assassin, but more of a stealthy commander sort. This playstyle is used for marking everything, spotting things with darts, and taking out targets from a considerable distance.  Big reminder if you play as infiltrator, your cloak doesn't fully make you invisible while moving/running. If you want to be nearly completely hidden, crouching while cloaked will put you into ""deep cloak"" which makes it nearly impossible for you to be spotted.   An exception of this is someone with a dark-light flashlight, which will reveal your silhouette."
Planetside,3drs7k,Dunamisbeam,3,Sat Jul 18 21:04:33 2015 UTC,I believe this downs a heavy assault's overshields as well.   It does take down the HA shield and also disables LA jump jets.   On top of all of that they also work through wall's and other objects.

I only wish the stalker cloak didn't have to give up a primary weapon... But then it wouldn't be very balanced, I suppose.

Halo as a fairly slow TTK compared to planet sides very fast one. Assassinations are pretty much nonexistent Withe the exception of the activateble ones which are expensive, requre to be equipped and activated. However it is two melee kill so you can do the old melee headshot trick. Classes play pretty much like the reach style ones, jet pack with light assault, heavy with oversheild infiltrator has cloak. On the note of infiltrators, they play very differnetly than halo sniping. Bolt action is requires for OHK headshots and there is bullet drop and no aim assist. Overall I wouldn't recoment starting on it as it requires investment to be good. Otherwise vehicle combat is similar, by default the harrasaer is a warthog with a backwards facing passenger seat, flash is a mongoose, lightning is a scorpion. Air is similar but harder, your esf is the banshee (equip ES rocket pods for the secondary) and the galaxy is a pelican"

Planetside,3dsvw9,Wisdomcube1,5,Sun Jul 19 03:25:04 2015 UTC,"Look through the submission history of /u/Vindicore and there is a plethora of quality content that would make leading less of a burden and get it closer to the fun side.  This post was related to a bunch of suggestions that various veteran leaders requested.  How about when they change things like squad spawn limitations,  they include tools for the leaders to mitigate the extra hassle?  The problem is that absolutely no consideration goes towards leadership regarding development.  I think the most helpful thing to leadership would be adding more to the command structure.  A squad of 12 is often too much, and for many players and leaders both, one platoon isn't enough when you need to compete against a zergfit that can field several full platoons already.  Adding more tiers to the command system with Fire Teams and Companies will spread the leadership burden around more as well as help mitigate the orphantoon problems.  Speaking of Orphantoons.  Why aren't there any good in game mechanics to mitigate that problem yet.  Leadership, or lack there of, make all the difference to player session experience, especially new player experience.  While this game has many more players not in outfits than in them, the players who do join public groups and outfits early have a higher chance of passing that BR8 new player quit wall.  There should be built in management of groups to handle the orphantoon issues as well as some sort of mutiny system like other, older, games have.  Since leadership often spends much of their time looking at the map, why not give them a leader UI that is better than the standard map.  It could be a reason players want to lead, and a tool that actually allows the leader to benefit their team while they play the lack luster strategy or tactical game.  Many older FPS games that have a leadership experience would allow the leader to lead completely without using a mic.  They could convey information, suggest orders, and receive information all with scripted voice macros.  Leaders in PS2 must use a mic to be of any worth, and that limits anyone who would receive harassment because of their voice regardless of their competency at the game.  Why don't the Platoon leaders have access to all the leadership cert stuff like the squad leaders do when they aren't leading?  This is something that has been asked for, for a long time now.  It makes no sense that the PL has less tools to utilize than the SL does.  Seriously how can you say the PL experience doesn't still feel like it is in perpetual beta, more than 3 years in now.  Why doesn't each hypothetical tier of leadership (FT, S, P, C) each have tools appropriate to their power level?  I'm hesitant on command level weaponry, but surely we could include vehicle drops, supply drops, and better intelligence tools.  The more time passes without progress, the more i'm all for providing toys that make players want to lead, even if it's to abuse those toys.  It sucks that ""Who wants lead, I'm getting off"", clears the coms better than ""Clear Coms"" does.  How about in the management UI including buttons for the /platoon and /squad commands.  Most leaders don't know you can swap players in different squads even though the platoon is full.  Players also don't often know that if they are SL and don't like the PL, then they can leave and take their whole squad with them.  They can also have their whole squad join a different platoon if there is a squad spot empty for them.  This stuff should be GUI, not chat command.  Team management could be overall better too.  Players should be able to see full groups and set alerts for when space becomes available.  Similarly leaders who don't yet have full groups should be able to look for smaller groups to invite to join up.  The same management system could be used to see where these groups were fighting without joining them, to better plan joint operations.  Most importantly the game needs some form of leadership metrics so that quality of leadership can be established and made competitive.  In older games like Battlefield2 I could see who my enemy commanders were, but in PS2 they are largely unknown.  Leadership should be just as competitive as the shooter parts.  There is even simple QoL stuff, like letting players remove a single way point at a time instead of always having to clear and reset.  The main problem with leadership is that it has gotten nothing to improve it, and it was always in a barely more than beta state.  Everything leadership development in this game thus far has been an afterthought, and I would love to be proven wrong with this last statement."

Vindicore has some really great stuff on leadership, well illustrated and thought out, so I have to give him a plug.  As for mine, here are a few things off the top of my head.    Additional inter-squad markers/waypoints (or) finished mission system  Much like offensive/defensive requests, but for more specialized purposes, so the other squads/platoons looking at it know what the damn thing is for. This would include Sunderer locations, requests for air strikes, anti-tank, reinforcements, etc.  The mission system would have handled this beautifully if it was built to spec, as it would provide both incentive to play ball and a way to get blueberries and leaders interacting; that second point is a huge one, and would have been a critical part to keeping leadership thriving.  Additional squad waypoint types  Much like the above point, there should also be more waypoint types for in-squad use, such as ""Defend location"" and ""Assault location"". Just allowing us to set the type of our singular generic waypoint would allow us to visually convey far more information than we currently can.  Care would have to be taken with how it's implemented though, as squad leaders don't have time to fiddle around with menus.  Inter-platoon Waypoint  A waypoint which platoon leaders can place on the map that anyone in their faction can see, and includes some form of identification for the platoon. This would allow leaders to visually broadcast where their platoon is heading, if/when they want to.  This could be further expanded to include squads, which would be desirable when splitting up your squads to multiple bases.   This request is largely to improve inter-platoon awareness, something which is almost non-existent and a severe problem for coordination.  Improved leader Q menu  The thing's damn near useless, a lot of people don't even know it exists, and those that do rarely if ever use it. The only time I ever use it myself is when I want to mark a capture point to prioritize without taking away my squad waypoint. This would also allow the setting of waypoints indoors, which isn't currently possible.  Remove individual waypoints  I shouldn't need to explain why this is important.  Company Support  Mhmm. I'm just going to say, why the hell can't I see the other platoon we're running a joint up with, and leave it at that.  Leader Comms  As you said yourself, comms for a platoon/company's leaders. Every decent outfit uses external programs for this, but why? The reason is because Planetside 2's comms are insufficient, so we need to use our own solutions; a recurring theme with leadership."
Planetside,3dsvw9,Azurebolt,2,Sun Jul 19 06:57:42 2015 UTC,"You don't see anything either because you didn't read threads 18 months ago or you forgot about them already. This topic has been regurgitated over and over and over again. /u/Vindicore writes a lot of things about it. I posted a few myself, including this one that suggests mainly waypoint stuff. A new tool would be a target designator of some sorts (differently coloured dorito maybe). My perspective is that of an outfit player. I do not play open platoons, ever. I play team speak only. I've been leading squads for a long time now.     The problem is the massive difference in gameplay between a PL and SL vs normal shootmanside. Yet, for some reason, you have the same interface. The SL needs an overview over classes, nanites and positions (distance from you). He needs to go to the map screen to do the last, taking him out of the game. Nobody but the PL for everyone or SL for the squad can communicate ANYTHING to ANYONE. There are no globally visible mark options to designate any targets (""Sunderer by the tree by the stone no not that one""). You can't give movement orders from the normal fighting view. A ""waypoint gun as a hotkey"" that just puts one on the first intersection of projectile and solid non-player object would help. PL somehow doesn't have an overview over the platoon in normal view. Right now, he has to go to the menu to even realize they're wiped. He needs a WoW raid-style view OPTION of his whole platoon on the side somewhere. If health is too much information flow, just give us alive/dead, class, name. The map does not show where capture points/terminals are before you're in the hex. What the fuck!?. I don't necessarily need up to date information about the status, but I need to know where they are Oo. These are all options to get more information. Newbies might get overwhelmed, so there should be an option to turn it off. But I am invested enough that I'd absolutely learn how to use it all."

Of course that came with the wonderful benefit in the first one of upping your command level just to be able to draw penises apparently.  Voice macros that lead to points or certain objectives. Especially this considering in game coms fail very often.  With the missions system: Override what the game tells you with commands from your squad lead. So your squad lead could tell you to attack point A or defend a gen and it would show up as an objective.  Specialized platoon lead weapons that need to be certed into, for example an orbital strike beacon that could be destroy fairly easily from direct gunfire (EMPs wouldn't work).

The amount of people playing the game decreases. Because of that servers get merged. Until now this caused no that much trouble cause every region still has a server available to it. But in future threre will be problems. If both american servers get merged into each other or the australian one gets shut down. In these cases players would have to play on servers that are quite far away from there location which causes high ping. So implementing such a system does not really makes sense. It would just make players who do not have a server close to them completely unable to play the game.

Planetside,3dstp0,MrUnimport,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:39:32 2015 UTC,"So that TR minimap icons are red, and line up with the red of TR facilities on the minimap."
Planetside,3dstp0,VSDeggy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:54:23 2015 UTC,"Well, there are several reasons.  First off, the default setting for facility color is faction colors. That means that it doesn't match the default ally-enemy color scheme. Some people want them to match.  Secondly (and embarrassingly)...  I sometimes forget which faction I'm fighting when it's set to ally-enemy. This is kind of a big deal when pushing a point (if you're fighting NC walk in with your rocket out) or pulling a tank (if you're fighting NC don't bother).  It's also harder to tell if a faction is crashing a fight with things set to ally-enemy. Galaxies under most lighting conditions don't have quite enough faction-color brightness to tell red from blue from purple, so it's useful to know whether the guys dropping in will be fighting the guys you're fighting or not."
Planetside,3dstp0,YellChatWarrior,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:57:53 2015 UTC,"I don't see the need for empire colours for IFF; my set-up is a modified ally/enemy IFF.  When I play TR, I have allied players as green and enemy players as red. In my opinion, ally/enemy IFF reduces the options for the brain (in a good way):  Green = don't shoot; Red = shoot  vs  e.g. Red = don't shoot; Blue = shoot; Purple = shoot  (Does the brain work as if-then-else or something similar?)  There are so many elements available for easy IFF outside of the coloured doritos: sound & look of ES weapons/vehicles, enemy voice-packs, ES armours, your own IFF call-outs - I'm not sure why anyone but really new players would have a problem with this.  The other factor in this is readability of colours depending on the time of day and environment (snow, forest, desert etc.)."
Planetside,3dstp0,TheRandomnatrix,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:35:11 2015 UTC,More information the better. When switching fights all the time sometimes it's easy to forget which faction you're fighting. When I see purple on my minimap I know to expect crab people and floating tanks. When I see red I know I'll be fighting dakka. It's more of a subconscious thing for me at least
Planetside,3dstp0,Bulllets,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:38:39 2015 UTC,I've had it where the enemy is red and my team is blue...is there any reason behind this?    I'm playing on several characters at the moment. If I see red on the map or above a spotted enemy this means I can go ahead and kill. If I used 3 colours then every time I would have to stop and think whether or not to shoot and only then shoot. Seems alot faster to just shoot the red ones than get confused every time I swap to another alt.

I'd prefer magburner over fire supression. Burn away, jump out, repair. That's your fire supression ;)  You won't be able to take stealth to good use without a decent gunner with whom you can communicate with. If you're going solo, your damage output won't be high enough to take down a rival tank in close combat in most of the cases. I'd go for auto repair. Will help you a lot, especially when going solo. Don't bother with reinforced armor.  You should buy and upgrade the FPC as soon as you can. The magrider has the lowest damage output of all tanks so you should avoid giving up any damage with the PC. Don't put too many certs into it (except for when you plan on auraxium it ;)) You won't get any kind of vehicle down in reasonable time with the VPC, use it for infantry only.

Planetside,3dtkd4,bobbertmiller,3,Sun Jul 19 11:03:07 2015 UTC,"Here you go:  I've seen more than 1 post now about ranged AV and thought I'd throw my 2 cents in since AV is my primary activity in the game. My credentials so that it is known that I don't solely have other faction bias when I urine all over the Lancer and Vortex. My NC and TR exist pretty much for the different AV experiences and are for when I want to run solo, so they are hidden even from those I know!  I have become a bit resentful of the Lancer and Vortex. I spent a lot of time getting the hang of hitting moving targets a decent distance away with the S1 and Decimator, and enjoyed using the Annihilator so much that it influenced my outfit name. All that was wiped away when the straight line AV guns and the NC/TR counterparts appeared. Vehicles were getting picked apart by MAXes and/or Lancer squads sitting up on the highest hills they could find. Fast forward, Archer, tank zergs.  Now, where do I stand on the AV argument? That's a tough call as I'm not very fond of the easy win ranged AV, but I'm less fond of the 40+ vehicle zergs... especially those armored Sunderers in them that can exploit base designs to park on top of the point with dual Fury's... 1 second while I sweep up this salt.  Anyhow. My take is that the damage should be based on 2 things: How close you need to be to to use the damage dealing device, or how easy is is to hit a target from range.  Point 1 is easy: C4. You need to get up close and personal (unless you're LA) to plant those on the sucker. Two C4 on the back of even the most decked out MBT will destroy it outright. That's fine.  Point 2 is demonstrated perfectly by the Decimator, Default Dumb-Fires, and G2G Lock-ons.  Lock-ons: Look at your target, wait for the signal, it flies towards the target. Does the least damage. Dumb-Fire: Good velocity, manageable drop, requires timing and/or angle adjustment. Does more damage. Decimator: Less velocity, more drop, requires more timing and/or angle adjustment. Highest damage. Also note that the damage that the weapon says it does is not the damage it's doing to most vehicles. Consult this chart for rather accurate bonus percentages. You can hover over the Damage Type to see which weapons fall into which category.  Our other rocket launcher friends break this trend quite a bit. The Lancer is the prime example of unfair. In its two 3-charge shots per battery, the Lancer does slightly more damage than the Decimator out to 400m. How many rockets do you think it'd take you to find the angle on a parked vehicle 400m away with the Decimator? Now, how about it moving? Two Vortex is equal to 1 Lancer. Difference is more spam and way more ammo. Sit a few of these guys on high ground and watch the enemy tanks disappear. (Fun fact. These were actually buffed because there were complaints they weren't performing well enough. How times change.)  Things are a little better on the NC's side of town. The Phoenix is in an acceptable state. The Ravens, however, are still a bit powerful even after the nerfs they received. Not as broken as the Vortex to be sure but can still easily solo several vehicles.  The TR. The TR have the Striker which is....... The TR have the Striker whi........ They have the Fracture! Which is... a... surprisingly... balanced weapon... compared to the other factions default MAX AV weapons....  Speaking of the Striker! Its form on the PTS fits perfectly with my scale! Its 6 shots per mag deal more damage than the Decimator. The drawbacks are what we know from before. You need to deal with drop as well as CoF that become increasingly apparent at 100m+. Any missed rockets will result is lower DPS. If you get killed before fully emptying your mag after jumping out of some bushes behind an MBT, less damage than a dumb-fire. Risk vs reward.  If I had the power to make changes, what changes would I make?  This is purely hypothetical of course.  I would remove the Vortex, Raven and Pounder and have the Fracture as the TR's default MAX AV weapon. It matches up surprisingly well with the Comet and Falcon on DPS, velocity and drop.  Getting rid of weapons would require new one's in their place though. Which I would take advantage of the MAXes higher durability and go the CQC AV weapon route. Plasma Cutter, Metal Cutting Circle Saw, Metal Drill. Much like C4, if you manage to get up to a vehicle, obliterate it. And if that isn't appealing: Short range AV projectiles, like mini Vulcan's on each arm.  The Lancer has multiple options.  If you want to keep the accuracy and velocity the same, have higher damage drop-off. I'd go a similar way as the Striker myself. The Lancer will do more damage than the Decimator with its 2 shots within 50m. Beyond that the drop-off kicks in to where the Sunderer being attacked by a Lancer squad at 300-400m can be comfortably repaired by 2 Engineers.  Another option is to give the velocity a hit or increase the charge time.  I do agree that AV could use review and this is just my take and suggestions. In no way to I declare that these are the best suggestions or that my opinions reflect that of everyone."
Planetside,3dtkd4,LordMcze,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:42:49 2015 UTC,Correction: 2 C4 on the ground 2m from the front of the most decked-out tank will destroy it. C4 ignores directional armor and has a massive blast radius.
Planetside,3dtkd4,VSDeggy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:58:07 2015 UTC,"Essentially...  Note that, AV weapon damage scales with range, C4 extremely good, lock-ons bad. Exceptions with long-range AV launchers and MAX.  Solution: Make fractures the TR default, replace pounders, ravens and vortexes with either super-close melee-esque really high damage weapons or with vulcan-esque CQC AV options."
Planetside,3dtkd4,Sharpish101,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:47:23 2015 UTC,"The reason I showed my log in screen was to show that I mainly use VS and that my main activity is AV. I've spent a lot of time on the Lancer and Vortex. I don't jest when I say that an entire enemy vehicle push can be thwarted as few as 2 Vortex MAXes. Get distance, get height, focus down.  As stated, a number of my suggestions were purely hypothetical, such as removing the MAX weapons. The Vortex could use the same sort of modifying I suggested for the Lancer.  Realistically though, the solutions for everything are already present in game. They have MAXes and other long range AV up on a hill? Pull snipers and Archer Engi's. People just have to be willing to swap to that role for a bit to deal with the threat."
Planetside,3dtkd4,VSDeggy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:47:22 2015 UTC,"Swapping roles isn't realistic with tanks as expensive as they are. You can't expect me to get a tank, get out of the tanks whenever I see a MAX (which will get my tank blown up >50% of the time by something other than the MAX) and then get a new tank. The MAX has effectively cost me my vehicle."
Planetside,3dtkd4,VSDeggy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:56:40 2015 UTC,"I suppose I didn't word it accurately. I meant the little goons running along side the tanks. A lot of the time there's a Sunderer deployed behind some rock or tree on the route. Many times I see infantry try to shoot at the MAXes with their small arms, fail, shrug it off and ignore them.  I don't know if it's because I have no in-game credibility or not but when I call out in region chat that there are MAXes on a hill with Engineer's, they get left untouched except for my and maybe a couple of other guys feeble attempts.  VS deal with them a bit better, but holy crap TR and NC assume someone else will deal with it.  This, of course, is from my experience on Emerald."
Planetside,3dtkd4,VSDeggy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:03:18 2015 UTC,"This would be solved if infantry actually ever needed armor.  AV weapons are so, so bad against infantry that they're non-threats. As a result, infantry don't care about that AV nest on the hill. And since infantry don't need armor support to push forward, they ignore it completely."
Planetside,3dtkd4,McKvack11,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:08:04 2015 UTC,A plausible statement.  One thing I would like to see is incentive to bring vehicles of your own to deal with vehicle columns rather than long range AV nests.

And the SAW only beats the Anchor at very long range, but that's not much of an issue if you're good at compensating for the Anchor's directional recoil.

I actually encountered people who said that out of render range AV works as intended and  if it didn't exist, Infantry would get farmed by vehicles.  I don't waste my time to argue with these people, since they lack any kind of knowledge of balance in a game, and common sense too.  The sad thing is that Devs seem to be in the same boat for a long time.

And that's what I don't get about the argument on capping infantry AV range to 300. Tanks are a giant target, they should be able to be hit from a longer range than an infantryman who is 1/10th their size. In exchange for that, the infantry guns do way less damage to them than their guns would do to that infantry unit. Yea, sometimes 6 infantry will get together and wreck that tank in one go but there aren't many 1v6 battles in this game that you can regularly expect to win."

Trying to blitz that hill as a solo ESF was pure suicide.  I liked the mechanics of the PS1 lancer in contrast; no charge up shot mechanic, about a .66 second refire time, projectile speed was about 66% of what it is in PS2, and a slight, ever so slight constant COF.

Now that that is irrelevant, we just want to fight at these bases we never get to see.  Some very broad fixes to Indar I would like to see aside from what you mentioned, and individual base fixes are:   A few more ""flanking"" lattice links. Better roads between bases and around choke-points, especially across ""The Wall."" Garages at more bases, even if they are not integrated well yet, just add them. North - Less Flak turrets at bases, its already wide open w/o much turrain, pull your own AA if you need it.  Southeast - more paths that go across the tops of the Mesas, that don't require everything get caught up in canyon choke-points. Southwest - Best vehicle terrain in the game but some of the worst bases for infantry."

He had less than 2 hours in any vehicle last time I checked, yet he had every LMG and Assault Rifle in the game purpled.  Tankers have been offering realistic solutions to this problem for the last year, but every time, we get shouted down by arena-deathmatch types who hate everything that 4 Orion headshots can't kill.

Planetside,3dnvm3,VSDeggy,7,Fri Jul 17 20:26:30 2015 UTC,"I think during his last few weeks before his leaving Higby kinda got more sensible towards vehicles, as he was introducing the AV secondary revamp (which actually made to live), experimenting with tank health buffs, and actually considered a Tomcat change.  He couldn´t have known how much of that would make it through the company sell. But I had the feeling that time was the only time when the devs actually cared about vehicles/aircraft at all."
Planetside,3dnvm3,raiedite,7,Fri Jul 17 20:37:12 2015 UTC,"You can't have vehicles for everyone and strong vehicles at the same time. If the game was less infantry oriented, with less ""arena"" type bases and more open ground (which it should be), you'd have a fucking horde of MBTs who can soak up rocket after rocket between every single fight. Imagine it just rolling towards your base and shrugging off all the damage; doesn't matter if half of the horde dies, the other half will already be knocking at your door.  It has been said since beta, pulling a vehicle needs to be DELIBERATE, and not your own personal armored taxi to the next base.   The resource system has done jack shit in that regard. Ok, maybe people who are retarded enough to burn all their nanites as grenades won't have enough resources when the base is captured, but vehicle zergs still exist because 1-man MBTs are a thing  But putting that aside, there is something else:  Vehicles in PS2 are so fucking easy to use. Compare with other more ""realistic"" games. You can't dick around with a tank in ArmA, BF2,or even in fucking PS1. What matters is that they have what could be called the inconvenience factor: This can be low maneuvrability, reduced field of view, lack of radar awareness, limited ammo, downed states, scarcity, communicating with the DEDICATED DRIVER, enter/exit delay...  Compare to PS2/BF2 where you can just hop in and out of your vehicle under enemy fire, tank a few rockets with your repair tool and hop back in instantly at the press of a button in case some SMG infiltrator tries to kill you. You even have fucking Thermal vision which generously highlights every ground peasant and Third person view.   Vehicules in PS2 are super safe and convenient.

Honestly part of me wonders how tank balance would have worked out if we only had AP and HEAT - I bet a lot of balance changes over the years wouldn't have been needed.    And the crux of my argument is that we need to see more survivability for armor and less lethality from infantry AV - not a buff to armor lethality."
Planetside,3dnvm3,Radar_X,4,Fri Jul 17 21:02:31 2015 UTC,"Vehicle weapons, especially those for tanks, cannot be situational. It's impossible to ensure the proper conditions for one since it's so painful to get a tank to a fight. Tanks have to have a measure of deterrence against non-intended targets to be able to survive because they can't swap weapons.  This is the reason HEAT was so popular before the tank armor buffs. Only a very few dedicated tankers ran AP, while most people ran HEAT, since it was capable versus vehicles and could still kill infantry on a very close miss.  After those armor buffs, HEAT became notably worse at AV work. More people switched to AP. Then HEAT and HE got nerfed to hell, so no one runs HEAT and no one runs HE.  All AI vehicle weapons should follow the Viper's model. It's effective, but it requires a bit of aim. Sort of a rapid-mini-HEAT.  There's a reason the Prowler has always been better at AI than the Vanguard was. Number of shots > Damage per Shot for anti-infantry work."

There's so fucking much anti-vehicle shit going on all the time that tanks are constantly getting rocked. In close quarters you also can couple C4 with that.  Two things should've been done with this game (well, three) to make it play much better:  1) Create a dedicated anti-vehicle class that carries the AV launchers in their second slot (no sidearms) and are restricted to shotguns and battle rifles in the primary slot.  2) Two-man MBTs.  3) Restrict in some fashion how much armor can be pulled. The timer was kind of shitty sometimes, but it was better than nothing.   I don't have an issue with tanks being really good at killing infantry if tanks are pretty rare. You know how in that scene at the end of Saving Private Ryan where the Tiger tank rolls up and everyone goes 'oh shit'? I want that. I want armor to be by-and-large a rarity that actually matters when it shows up.

Hossin and Amerish are hostile to ground vehicles (less so Amerish, but it's still a pain in the ass). Esamir is my favorite continent by far, because it's not as hostile for ground vehicles to move around in and most of the base designs prevent camping spawn with tanks (there are a number of exceptions of course), however the walls on Esamir bases are lazy. If you took some of the base design concepts of Hossin and put it on Esamir, you'd probably have the best of both worlds.  Base design is convoluted and complicated and actually slows down the process for developers churning out new continents. Not every base has to be a unique snowflake. I'm a veteran FPS player, and even I can't remember the layouts of all of the bases on all of the continents.

As TE collapsed, outfits shrank and alerts became a thing, the highly coordinated outfits on Mattherson began using and abusing group mechanics to dance in circles around less organized enemies.  From redeployside to random AA nests, lancers, bursters and hyper IVI outfits, the infantry oriented mindset of the server dominated.  Vehicles and air generally get killed or deterred away from all fights within moments leaving the infantry combat to itself.  Fast forward to the Waterson merge and within weeks entire outfits died as they were farmed right off the server.

There's not really any effective organization, it's just plant waypoint, go here, farm or be farmed. It's all about who brings the biggest stick and almost no finesse. This is partly why I feel we saw the dwindling of Recursion from the Platoon of Doom to just a handful of people playing. There isn't anything to compete with an organized platoon on a regular basis. The best we could hope for was for a zerg of another faction to form which had the numbers to give us enough people to shoot at.  Emerald actually surprised me when I was playing there during the Spring and Fall since one of the odd things I would see were AV nests and coordinated flak. It sounds so simple, but seeing 2-3 burster MAXes or half a squad of engis with AV turrets working together is a level of coordination I just never see on Connery with any sort of frequency."

Planetside,3dnvm3,mpchebe,3,Fri Jul 17 21:54:04 2015 UTC,"Hossin is a continent in which the three different aspects fight each other.  The trees make it difficult for aircraft to attack vehicles and infantry, so you can get some amazing air to air fights going on. The trees also add to it as running isn't a 100% death sentence, if you can outmanoeuvre the other pilot through the dense foliage.  Vehicles have plenty of area between bases to fight each other, but the trees and design of the bases make them near impossible to attack other targets. There is enough bushes and rocks to add to sneak attacks, while also being able to have all out swamp brawls between two lines of tanks.  Infantry are secluded, and largely don't have to worry about the vehicles or aircraft. The open areas where aircraft can engage infantry can easily be covered with one or two burster MAXes. The elevated designs of most of the bases, along with plenty of small amounts of cover around the bases themselves force vehicles to stay out of the way.  I believe that Hossin is one of the better continents in terms of overall design. One of the main issues between the interaction of all three is the forced seclusion. Tech plants are actually a good example on how to allow combined arms to work properly. You have enough buildings to provide infantry cover, enough open areas for vehicles to interrupt battles, and enough open airspace for aircraft to do their work. That's not to say they are perfect either.  Another good example is Crux HQ, as it generally has the same principle as tech plants in terms of interaction."

They're the counter to everything and are impossible to kill outside of 3 scenarios:   There is a massive skill differential between the max user and the one on the receiving end They're massively outnumbered and don't have convenient cover for them to charge away to People forego the ability to kill anything else and pull archers to hunt them   They're the counter to everything and are hard-countered by nothing. Platoon and squad leads realise this, and therefore use Maxes to their fullest possible extent. There's no reason to ever pull vehicles other than sundies or gals, given the current power of maxes.   Here's a couple of scenarios that we commonly see. I'll go through what happens with and without maxes:    With maxes Without maxes    Lolpodder comes on the horizon, starts farming infantry Lolpodder comes on the horizon, starts farming infantry   Someone pulls bursters, ducks in and out of spawnroom so he's impossible to kill Someone pulls a skyguard, and is vulnerable to other tanks   Stalemate Others pull tanks to kill the skyguard. All of a sudden you have a tank battle      With maxes Without maxes    Someone drives a sundy from one base to another Someone drives a sundy from one base to another   The enemy pulls vortexes/ravens The enemy pulls tanks and/or aircraft to kill the sundy   Stalemate over an open field Lively combined arms field battle    In both these scenarios, it's maxes that remove the need for any other unit to exist, and therefore cause brutal stalemates and remove the ability for other units to participate. Maxes are far too versatile, and are able to switch to counter any unit for free as long as they're near and infantry terminal. I personally think the game would be a better place if MAXes were removed altogether, but for now I'd probably settle with nanite costs being associated with changing loadouts, along with vortexes and ravens being brought down to a fracture level of effectiveness"

There needs to be some way to limit the number of MAXes that can be pulled per squad, either with a hard limit or by making MAX-heavy squads unwieldy. Charge also needs to be removed, full stop, because it allows MAXes to compensate for being outmaneuvered when their low speed is their chief vulnerability."

Trying to nerf every weapon that is actually good at it's niche role is what got us to this point, I'm surprised that you think that it's the solution to get us out. Infantry are much smaller than tanks. Therefore they should have an easier time hitting tanks at the longest ranges in this game. Dial it back too much and the good tankers will be able to one shot them before they can do enough damage to even weaken it. Bring back HE weapons or give tanks more health but nerfing more weapons is not the answer. Harassers are the natural vehicle counter to long range infantry AV anyway, the speed is enough for a good driver to dodge, get in close, or flank. MBTs are slow, easy to hit, and weak against tiny targets at long range but they should be a big, beastly threat once they get close. Too bad every single AI weapon on the platform got nerfed to the point that they're weak at every range instead. Fix that before breaking something else."

I'm an exclusively IVI person as well but I still like to see vehicles/combined arms stuff making a difference. It is depressing that a couple MAXs or some lancers can totally end armor pushes as long as they have ammo and a medic behind them.  Infantry AV should be designed to be close range. Tanks at long range are not a major risk to infantry with how much HEAT/HE has been nerfed, so what exactly is the point in infantry being incredibly lethal even beyond render range?

The chokepoint bases and the death traps (NS abandonded offices etc.) could really use some work and then the terrain between bases has always been a bit neglected. A pass to fix those bases, and add some better field battle positions for the worst offending terrain (Northern Indar/Esamir for wide open deathfields, Hossin/SE Indar for excessive chokepoints), would improve this game far more than any sort of mission system or resource revamp. There needs to be a good mix of strong sunderer placement locations to provide staging areas. Gentle cover for both infantry and vehicles between sunderer points and bases so that they don't have to make dashes of 50-100m+ across open ground. And of course, the chokepoints need to be opened up a bit and have at least a couple routes so that each side has a room to maneuver.   If the fights are fun, the game is fun, and I think map design is probably the biggest thing DGC could do to improve the fights we have now.

Planetside,3dnvm3,MrUnimport,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:17:24 2015 UTC,"One semi-easy solution could be removing all the tiny outposts from the lattice and as spawnable locations. Basically remove the capture point, lattice link, and spawn room. Keep terminals and turrets (as neutral hackables) and the physical facility, including Sundy garages.  That way if one force has a powerful armor column going, they can just advance steamroll-style and destroy the enemy Sunderer and keep the vehicular war going. Currently the reason why infantry is so good at everything is that they have hard spawns every 700 meters, and these spawns can only be contested by other infantry, leaving vehicles completely out of the gameplay flow. Your Sundy got blown up? No problem, 700 meters behind you there is an indestructible spawn that you can use to mass AV infantry units and instantly destroy those tanks that blew up your own Sundy. Then pull a Sundy yourself, rinse and repeat. No need to even protect Sunderers on the move since they only have 700 meters to traverse.  Instead, by making hard spawns a (relative) rare resource and forcing infantry to rely on vehicles only for a good fraction of their push (say, 4000 meters), you give the armor column the ability to deny infantry and win a big stretch of territory by blowing up their Sundy... that infantry will then have to do the 4000-meter push all over again, creating a new, exciting fight that does not take place in a walled base, if not for short periods of time (due to less hard spawns). What if the enemy has Sundies every 600 meters you ask? Sundies are not like spawn rooms. They can be destroyed. Flank one with a few MBTs, send a swarm of fighter jets to Hornet it or have a gunship nuke it from orbit. Done. You know what infantry can't do better than vehicles? Moving. Sundies are immobile targets. It takes a really short time for your armor to get to that Sundy. On the other hand, right now it also takes a really short time to get to that base... except that once you get there, you have to park your tank and wait for 6 minutes every time."

Otherwise you get insta-gibbed by pretty much every noob with a G2A / A2A lockon cheese missile.   If you ever want to have survivability, cert into it.  Consider this:   2 G2A rockets slam into you 1k damage each~, you recover 30% HP over 5 seconds with Fire Suppression. 30 heavies with locks all fire, you decoy flares. Potential damage mitigation = over 9,000. Quite literally saves your ass.   Survivability is priority #1, killing enemies is second. Still important but you'd rather be alive first."

Hossin in particular is great for this, in terms of unique bases as well. It's a real shame Xander is gone and Searhus never came to be- it would be great to see what sorts of creations could be made on a whole new, full size continent without having to worry about existing base links or the infamous Battle Islands/Koltyr's two/three way balancing acts, especially with a volcanic environment that would allow for all sorts of environmental hazards and landscapes without the ""Why does this water kill me instantly?"" question that pervades the greener continents."

Planetside,3dp2op,VSDeggy,9,Sat Jul 18 02:22:16 2015 UTC,"I think instead of having ammo types be your tank 'primary', you should be able to swap between entirely different turret setups that change your tank's functionality.  You could have a HE magrider that, instead of just having more splash, would instead have a weaker, traditional turret-style primary  gun instead of the normal fixed-hull cannon.  The AP vanguard could have a fancy new railgun with a higher velocity than the HEAT vanguard's tank cannon, but lack the later's co-axial autocannon, making it weaker in close combat, especially against infantry.  The HE prowler could downgrade to a viper cannon, but gain extra side and rear armor, as well as a passenger compartment. It would be similar to a traditional dual-fury bangbus, only with more range and maneuverability."
Planetside,3dp2op,BBQBaconPizza,3,Sat Jul 18 04:08:22 2015 UTC,But that would take effort on DBG part......and we all know how that works.

Planetside,3dp2op,iRhuel,8,Sat Jul 18 15:23:22 2015 UTC,Why not just make a brand new Main Cannon for the MBT's that functions like the Viper?  Also HE  just needs some  buffs to the radius's.  HEAT.... needs more splash damage.
Planetside,3dp2op,Scrinrusher,3,Sat Jul 18 02:45:29 2015 UTC,"Splash damage, especially radius, is cancer in video games. Nobody likes getting killed from around a corner or killed even though the enemy missed."
Planetside,3dp2op,TheRandomnatrix,14,Sat Jul 18 06:52:58 2015 UTC,why not give the effect of concussion grenade when hit by he canons splash.
Planetside,3dp2op,thatswierd2,8,Sat Jul 18 08:25:19 2015 UTC,That's an creative and elegant idea and it's the kind of thinking that is needed.  As long as HE shells have to do splash damage to apply the effect. Otherwise it's going to be hell inside spawn shacks and behind base walls.  On the other hand I don't think it's a big enough incentive to make HE viable. Not on its own.
Planetside,3dp2op,D16_Nichevo,2,Sat Jul 18 08:52:32 2015 UTC,So how do you feel about vehicles getting cornered by infantry? Vehicles would be completely unable to retaliate without splash and current splash isn't enough to be seriously threatening.   And I don't mind dying to splash in tf2. I know I would've died a lot faster if he directed me. Splash just needs to be less rewarding than directs...which it would be if everything was like the viper or p2 guns.
Planetside,3dp2op,P2-120_AP,0,Sat Jul 18 15:47:37 2015 UTC,"While I don't spend ALL my time in a tank(infantry side shitter here), I have had my fair share of gunning a vanny and solo AP lightning. The only times I find myself cornered by infantry are when they make a concerted effort to flank me specifically, or more commonly when I overextend.   The first one is teamwork and coordination being OP. The second is complety my fault. In either of those cases, a direct hit with a highly accurate AP shell is an instagib. If I'm in an MBT then the gunner should be running AI support to deter would be infantry. You sacrifice AV potential, but that's the tradeoff.  I think vehicles need more things to do than farm infantry and kill other tanks. They need a bigger role in the game that let's them play some sort of objective or counter support.   I find it funny though that you list the viper as an example of good AI. That thing is all about killing people with splash damage. The only thing making it semi balanced is the high dropoff and only 6 shots per reload, which means I can only kill ~2 people in a mag."
Planetside,3dp2op,TheRandomnatrix,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:08:12 2015 UTC,"I meant cornered as in the infantry shoot the corners of the vehicle that are visible, without exposing themselves. You don't have to go in front of the guns to hit it. Vanguard gets fucked the most because of it."
Planetside,3dp2op,P2-120_AP,3,Sat Jul 18 19:21:58 2015 UTC,"you get killed behind corners in this game anyways because of how the registry works, not to mention the lasher."
Planetside,3dp2op,cockboydota,0,Sat Jul 18 07:56:15 2015 UTC,I never said getting killed around corners was good either. It sucks. But it's an inevitably when dealing with lag and client side hitreg.  The lasher would be downright OP if it got even a slight buff. It can be dangerous in the right hands as an area denial weapon. If anything it makes a good case for the difficulty of AoE balance.  Just because it exists already in some parts of the game doesn't need we need to bring back more of it
Planetside,3dp2op,TheRandomnatrix,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:07:38 2015 UTC,"By this logic, every player must hate the Lasher."

Planetside,3dp2op,Scrinrusher,-1,Sat Jul 18 15:11:07 2015 UTC,If the game is designed with it in mind(almost always fast paced arena shooters) then it can be fun.

Also Splash has actually a important role.  Crowd control(group destroying) & suppression.   You need to look at PS2 from a RTS perspective abit not just a FPS perspective."
Planetside,3dp2op,Scrinrusher,-2,Sat Jul 18 15:58:23 2015 UTC,"Your point? Splash damage sucks in this game. There are videos all over of splash damage being OP or at least cheesy. Rocket pods, Dalton's/zephyrs, furies, bulldogs(on battlegals/libs), pre nerf HE, stickies, vipers."
Planetside,3dp2op,TheRandomnatrix,4,Sat Jul 18 16:21:07 2015 UTC,"Your point? Splash damage sucks in this game.

So AI weapons killing Infantry(which is there job) in situations is cheesy?(Keeping in mind those same infantry could have fought back/fallen back  to pull stuff. But of course the ""learned helplessness"" effect always happens.)  Then AP/AV weapons killing Vehicles in situations must not be cheesy?"
Planetside,3dp2op,Scrinrusher,2,Sat Jul 18 16:35:39 2015 UTC,"There are videos all over of splash damage being OP or at least cheesy. Rocket pods, Dalton's/zephyrs, furies, bulldogs(on battlegals/libs), pre nerf HE, stickies, vipers.   This is the attitude that has condemned us to infantryside instead of having more awesome combined arms gameplay.  My vision would be a model where it's like a rock-paper-scissors deal.  MBTs should be very strong against infantry, because who would see a tank and not have a twinge of fear?  MBTs are (and should be) easily countered by aircraft, meaning that dedicated AA platforms are a must.  Lightnings should be precision strike vehicles that can perform evenly well against infantry and armor, but not particularly strong against either one. Infantry should be weak to armor, though not defenseless, with C4 being a strong option, but rockets should either take a primary slot, or be a deterrent to armor rather than outright destroying it.  I think a lot of the problems we have with vehicles/maxes/other things people complain about could be solved by the resource revamp we have been promised for months, or even reverting to the original resource structure so that they actually matter."
Planetside,3dp2op,pwrlvlonme,2,Sat Jul 18 19:00:17 2015 UTC,"Believe me, I want vehicles to matter in this game. I don't want them to be farming machines that they've been in the past though. It's boring at best, and at worst creates horrible gameplay for the people getting blasted. But whatever, I'm done with this conversation. Getting down voted for not thinking sitting on a hill shelling spawn for easy kills is good gameplay."
Planetside,3dp2op,TheRandomnatrix,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:11:57 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, but something in me says that HE rounds should be more effective at their job, especially how considerably powerful infantry is against heavy armor.  They are good for suppression, but good luck getting any kills with them.  In old planetside, I never found that I was getting massively farmed by armor even with HE, because other people would pull vehicles due to them not being useless (ok I don't think they are useless).  I think part of the problem is too many people worry about infantryside becoming tankside, when they neglect the fact that inherently, you will always need infantry due to how the game is set up.  I think we just need fewer COD players and more Planetside players.  Just my two cents."
Planetside,3dp2op,pwrlvlonme,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:13:40 2015 UTC,"The Dalton hasn't been viable for anything other than A2A and AV in quite some time. All splash damage has had significant radius reductions and increased damage dropoff. Pretty much the only HE style weapon who still has a moderately decent profile is the Duster, which doesn't get a torchfork brigade simply because of how seldom it is used. Though I can say it is my go to for removing particularly aggravating nests of AA/AV. All other weapons require direct hits or within 1m for it to do anything significant. As far as sticky grenades goes, that was a bug that I believe has been fixed. It was applying damage twice."

Make it so newer players have more shots to learn the mechanics of the weapon better and adjust for things like drop more quickly. Ideally it'd either shoot fast enough that it's much easier to use than larger cannons against armor while only being OK against infantry or it'd be given a very small speed advantage, but retain the 1 hit kill against infantry making its advantage over AP the potential for better infantry farming."

Planetside,3dp2op,Faxon,3,Sat Jul 18 06:21:05 2015 UTC,"This is a great Idea. The Lightning HE serves literally no purpose since the Viper got a buff ages ago, since you can actually still kill infantry decently with it due to its 6 round magazine, despite it not getting 1hk on infantry unless you score a headshot (and good luck doing that consistently). It's easier to chain 2 shots for a quick kill and get 3 kills guaranteed per mag, or just go for large clusters of infantry at once and take advantage of the guaranteed inconsistent fire pattern and decent splash damage that 6 rounds can do. If they're near a sunderer you will be able to take everyone defending it down and suppress the deploy shield from the splash alone for long enough for another tank to punch through it, or for you to slowly blow it up yourself.   Giving us a Phalanx tank with limited AA ability would fill the role of a joint function point defense turret similar to a skyguard, but with less punch and no burst (like the walker to the ranger), but with a lower max angle so it takes some skill to use, only damages ESFs, and is primarily geared for shooting infantry similar to a kobalt or a pair of max chainguns. The Xipos turret is an excellent damage model for this vehicle gun IMO, and as an aside they REALLY need to use that base turret more consistently as well. every major facility with turrets of any type should have one or two besides the ones that are always right next to spawns or hanging off certain amp station spawns."

Planetside,3dp2op,trickyboy21,2,Sun Jul 19 06:18:22 2015 UTC,"my favorite way to kill people is with wide arcing shells that scream and then land in an explosion. Mortars and Artillery are a favorite of mine. There is a reason I suck at StarCraft, it's because I build too many Siege Tanks. I played the TR because my friend told me that the Prowler was, by design, a mobile artillery platform. After certing into the Lockdown, I enjoyed the shot arc it still had on the shots, I thought the velocity buff would make the shells have little drop at all. It allows you to do target painting more than anything, unless it's a deployed sunderer you aren't really going to actually hit anything too accurately.  The HE rounds are very small in explosive power for what they do. That is okay, nobody really likes dying to something they can't really fight back against. It also shouldn't have a larger explosive radius.   If the Prowler is a mobile artillery platform, it cannot fulfill the true role of a piece of artilley, which is to designate a killzone, and then lay fire into it until the lethality rate goes above 50%. One Prowler cannot achieve this. To effectively paint an area with explosive fire, say, a larger outpost, you'd probably need a really good vantage point overlooking the base, and 3 - 6 Prowlers. They would also have high allied death rates. This is all besides the point.  HE is fine where it is. You need multiple HE tanks in order to accomplish saturation of an area with explosive fire. This is good, it means one tank can't rack up a fuckton of kills, but a small armor column fitted specifically for the role of supportive fire can still actively scare the infantry into their spawn rooms and protective buildings."

I know they would be pretty hard to balance what with the potential for hitting aircraft... I think how it should function is a very slow moving projectile with relatively low velocity with high effective range.  Also, limit the platform's ability to aim at ground targets close by, almost like the walker's firing angle when on top of a sunderer."

Planetside,3dp2op,9xInfinity,2,Sat Jul 18 23:28:36 2015 UTC,"HE should retain its current damage against infantry, but its velocity/RoF should be HEAT equivalent. So, slightly better AI compared to now. Its job should be better-than-HEAT AI ability (still not great though) and also anti-light vehicles. Harassers, sunderers, buggies (when/if they come out) should take more damage from HE hits than AP/HEAT. HE should be better, somehow, against light vehicles than AP and HEAT, and also be better at AI. Either through resists, and/or making HE splash damage these vehicles, or whatever.  Bottom line though, don't make MBTs about farming infantry again. Make HE be a specialized anti-vehicle gun which is also a bit better at AI, but go the other way, and make it better against light vehicles where AP is better against heavy vehicles."
Planetside,3dp2op,D16_Nichevo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:43:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think this is the right approach. It makes these weapons useful against infantry without making them one-hit-unfun and it shouldn't be terribly hard to implement.  Another alternative in the same vein would be to make HE cannons the same as anti-tank cannons, but slightly less powerful, then add a coaxial machinegun. Something somewhere between heavy LMG and Harasser-mounted Kobold. Yes: this probably requires a bit more effort than the above solution because tank drivers will need to be able to swap weapons (like an ESF).  Or even use both ideas. Turn HEAT into slightly-nerfed-AT-with-coaxial and HE into the Viper-like weapon."

I don't think the current HE weapons should be repurposed like that though. Those viper-like weapons should be new alternatives.  I think the current HE weapons can go in a different direction, that fills a different niche; very wide splash, but low damage. Say, 500 damage @ 2m (inner radius), going down to 200 damage at 10m for the vanguard HE. 400@2m, 200@8m for magrider. etc.  That way they can at least have a role of area supression, and be useful in numbers. Being damaged by a HE shell can also possibly apply a mild concussion effect (visual-only, no slowdown, emphasis on mild). Severity dependent on damage taken.  There are a lot of ways to make HE useful without pissing everyone off. Unfortunately, I don't think we will see much in the way of vehicle-related changes until PS3."
Planetside,3dp2op,FLESHPOPSICLE,0,Sat Jul 18 19:55:03 2015 UTC,"Interesting concept. I would be more in favor of this rework if you could choose between this and the current mode. Similar to how you can work with the HE cannon or the C75 if you so choose. Adding stuff is great, especially if it gives you a new angle or way of playing, but why remove a potential sidegrade if you aren't buffing or nerfing the overall killing power?"

Not to mention tanks get hit out side of render range with several things like Ravens, Vortex, AV turrets, Lancers, etc.  Infantry don't fear vehicles.... at all. You're better off destroying a tank with infantry than pulling back and actually pulling armor to counter the HE."

Planetside,3dq7e2,hdnine,2,Sat Jul 18 15:09:15 2015 UTC,"NC basically got a huge buff after they toned down the screenshaking. Now, they're the kings of headshots.  Scat Maxes got a few nerfs down the line and recently, the Max class as a whole has become much easier to counter, with tank mine vulnerability and the new anti-material rifle.  As for tanks and ESF's, balance hasn't changed dramatically."
Planetside,3dq7e2,rolfski,3,Sat Jul 18 20:20:14 2015 UTC,"Infantry Weapons - When I was playing TR seemed to have fastest TTK and NC couldn't hit a barn. I've heard this has been nerfed with a hip fire patch.   I don't think this was ever true unless you are talking about the days back when aimpunch was so terrible that high ROF would basically win you any gunfight (and that was a LONG time ago). You're going to have to specify on a specific weapon class, because a handful of things have been tweaked (especially on the LMG side) in the past year. The anchor, for example, is probably the go-to weapon for NC heavies aside from medium-to-long range fights with the SAW.  A lot has changed in terms of individual weapon balance so you're going to have to ask particular questions about the playstyles/classes you use.   Tanks - Vanguard wins all 1v1, prowlers farm spawns, magriders are cool but underpowered?   Madriders have never been underpowered and have always performed well statistically and in practise... I used to drive mine quite a bit and it is by far the most powerful tank. They have barely touched the mag and it's been doing better than ever, especially since they nerfed the vanguard.  The overshield on the vanguard now just soaks up 2k damage instead of 3k, so that is a big blow to it and you'll find a bit less vangaurds winning 1v1 tank fights. AP has been buffed all around in velocity and damage (slightly), HEAT buffed in damage but nerfed in AOE, and HE nerfed overall.  Prowlers still farm, but with AP, because HE is useless according to most tankers. Magriders are very good tanks with maxed out magburner because of its flanking and strafing ability. Magriders do very well in long range tank duels (due to strafing) and can often get flanks behind enemy tanks without much effort.   MAX - NC still own the close game with their shottys?   Yes, ZOE was also nerfed a long time ago but I assume you know that. NC maxes still are in the same state, and all the max weapons have new (and much better looking) models.  However, tank mines are now triggered by MAXes and there is an anti-max weapon for the engineer that will take them out pretty fast (sniper rifle). Those extra counters are nice to have.   ESF - Never really delved into the balance of these back in the day.   My advice is to not touch ESF combat. Liberators can still be a lot of fun, but depending on the server you play in, being a dedicated ESF pilot can get pretty hectic, especially when you have to deal with the new A2AM missiles (more effective then when you played, although you have to maintain lock now), and Coyotes (close range heat seeking missiles, pretty annoying). You'll find a lot more people grouping up and a lot more hate amongst pilots in most servers . . . not a lot of dueling / skilled combat going on in live servers anymore.  EDITED: edited with more edits"

In very few cases did I pick up additional infantry weapons - for example I have no idea what the Anchor is.   You now start with a free shotgun, but otherwise you have the same starter weapons (CARV, SAW, Orion for LMGs). The CARV and Orion are both great and easy to learn weapons, but the SAW is much tougher to use and needs proper burst control and suffers heavily when strafing. If you're playing NC, the EM6, GD22S, and Anchor are all guns you'd probably rather invest into, but for the other factions you should stay with the defaults (maybe MSW-R for TR LMG)  ARs did get a few balance passes, I didn't pay too much attention to them but it was mostly changes to the TAR and some other tiny tweaks (bloom, teeny changes to accuracy, etc). TR have a very solid default AR.  Carbines are pretty great all around for starters... the solstice and mercenary are very balanced and versatile weapons, the TR has TRAC-5 which, again, has a decent reputation like TR's AR.   ZOE?   ZOE was VS's MAX ability that was extremely broken and overpowered, far worse than NC maxes... allowed for increased damage output, movement speed faster than infantry, EXTREMELY fast strafing, all at a tiny cost of a little damage resistance. I remember how broken it was (and used it a ton), I'm glad they nerfed it (although now it's useless haha).  If you played shortly after it went F2P, you'll notice a lot has changed. I don't think it's possible to cover everything, not even resources work the same way anymore, there's a new continent, new air vehicle... lots of balance changes, new weapons, better performance."

VS is second here thanks to several solid 167-damage weapons and generally a lot of accurate and controllable weapons. They have also a small advantage in their semi-auto weapons thanks to the lack of drop which makes ranged shots a tad easier.  TR is third, imo, because we only have a few that are good for that. The SABR and TMG-50 are among the best in class for long range, but aside from those and maybe the Cougar and T5-AMC we tend to lack when it comes to long ranged effectiveness. We make it up with serious medium range firepower in all weapon classes, so we aren't at a disadvantage in most common situations, but i'd sure as hell not pick TR if i wanted to fight from far away."

Well...VS whined so hard that Higby gave in...they got the same damage falloff as TR guns with some accuracy nerfs (but they were still more accurate then a comparable TR gun)...which lead to the VS bias shit the game still suffers from atm.  So the ""heavier damage falloff"" is gone since nearly 2 years now.  Same goes for the bullet sped. Out of the Top 10 bulletspeed LMGs 4 are VS (Ursa, SVA-88, PulsarLSW and Polaris, 3 are NC (EM1, SAW-S, GD 22) and only 2 are TR (Bull, Rhino ) and 1 is NS (NS-15) Same if we look at the ARs...again in the Top10 we have 5 VS (CME, Equinox Burst, Equinox, Pulsar and Corvus), 2 NC (Gauss and Gauss Burst), 2 TR (TORQ and SABR) and 1 NS (NS-11) And again the same with Carbines...under the Top 10 fastest bulletspeed we have 4 VS (Pulsar, Sosltice, Solstice SF and Solstice Burst), 4 NC (Mercenary, Razor, Gauss Compact S and Gauss Compact Burst) and again only 2 TR (T5 AMC and Cougar)  so if you try again to tell some stories get the facts before"

I HIGHLY recommend making a full set of characters (1 for each Faction) on both Emerald and Connery. It takes some work to get them all Certed up (Membership w/ it's daily login helps), but when you do, it gives you AMAZING options.  I have 1 Character of each Faction on both Emerald and Connery (6 characters total). You get Characters 4-6 by doing a 1-Month Membership (you keep them even after the Membership ends). Having this means I can check both Servers and cherry pick the best situation to play in.  Which Server has better population, Continent I want Unlocked, Alerts going, or great fights going at specific bases. Which Faction has better population (for me that means balanced) or great fights going at specific bases.  Having these play options keeps me sane, and able to play almost whenever I want, with (usually) some combination option for good gameplay."

VS is very dominant in organized outfits, and alert performance.  TR is somewhere in the middle, leaning closer to ""good"" than ""bad"".  Our server enjoys generally very even populations during prime time then goes extremely VS heavy at night when the Asian players show up in force (this has changed to be a little more even as we got alot of new Korean players on all factions recently).  All in all - timezone relative to you (being on during prime time), and proximity to your location (ping) should still be your primary concern when selecting a server, with outfit ties being a very close second.  From what I'm reading, no; you should just stick it out on Emerald. I don't think that moving to Connery will fix the problems you speak of on Emerald."

Planetside,3dp4i7,AyresTargayren,0,Sat Jul 18 09:33:00 2015 UTC,"It's basically how the (old) F2P model works, isn't it? Quick progression for the first couple hours, followed by a giant grind wall.  Unfortunately DBG is still behind the times and using this outdated business model instead of the modern F2P model (aka the real money maker); only selling cosmetics for $ instead of shitting on the game experience trying to squeeze money out of players by boring them to death."

Planetside,3dp4i7,MrUnimport,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:07:18 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you mean. You mean the whole F2P concept is relatively new to begin with (aka a few years old)? Or are you just talking about the recent cert price changes?  I'm talking about the entire PS2 system of ""pay for convenience / pay to not grind"" being outdated and inferior to the new ""only pay for cosmetics"" style of F2P, exemplified by games like DOTA and PoE, as the latter model does not need to butcher the game in order to make money - quite the opposite - it relies on the game to be fun to attract customers, who then stay and purchase cosmetic stuff."
Planetside,3dp4i7,obuw,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:19:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, I was talking about the recent changes. Before the newbie bonus there was no early period of easy grind, which in my opinion itself makes the game seem cheap and deceptive in the eyes of prospective players."
Planetside,3dp4i7,MrUnimport,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:40:29 2015 UTC,"I agree, especially since there is no explanation of any kind about how these 100 certs per level only happen up to BR15, they should be careful where they spend them, etc.  If I was a new player now, after reaching BR16 I'd probably think ""hey I didn't get 100 certs this time, is that a bug?

As of posting this, I've got 281,431 certs.  Most of my weapons I paid smedbucks for and my certs have gone into certing out class/vehicles.  I am STILL unlocking stuff, and a long way away from having everything unlocked (that takes about 500,000 certs, which is 125,000,000 XP worth).  Trust me, EVERYONE should have gotten retroactive certs for this kind of thing.  We might not be as hard up for certs to put into basic gear as new players are, but at one point we were, and we had to grind with far more difficulty.  (I remember hating having to grind for certs back when an ESF kill only gave 75 XP, and an MBT kill only gave 100 XP! Trust me, a belated 1,500 cert grant now for going through the old cert acquisition speed would be merely a consolation prize, but a well deserved one.)  ""Better late than never"" really applies here, and it's upsetting that DBG is essentially telling it's loyal customers ""You're not new income, so f**k you, we don't care about fairness"" simply because we're not still newbies."

Warframe is the perfect example of why someone will spend money on a game. It has ""grind walls"" that take a considerable amount of time to work through. It could take a week or longer to gather the right materials for a single item, let alone push it through the actual creation process, which can also take a couple of days.  Contrast that with PlanetSide 2.  PlanetSide 2's ""grind walls"" are wicked low for players who know what they're doing. You can knock out a 1000 certs in a few days if you really wanted to, and from a business perspective, that's no good. Now, in comes 100/200/250/500 cert weapons. Those are basically weapons you will rarely ever make money from, because you're basically giving them away for free.  The cert cost increase was to inconvenience you more so that you spend cash.

The cert cost increase was to inconvenience you more so that you spend cash.   I'm not against DBG make some money, but lack of essential weapon like AA lock-on for new players is ridiculous. And there no way to justify it's increased price.  Because seriously newbie players farmed by air hard anyway and now they have no weapon to counter it. MAX aren't solution because most of times you take lock-on it's when you just got farmed on vehicle and don't have nanites."

Planetside,3dp4i7,joevector,2,Sat Jul 18 03:38:18 2015 UTC,"Then make the cosmetics feel at a reasonable price and leave the guns the way they are.   People are VERY happy to make their things look cool, but in this environment, why would I spend $10 on a helmet or a camo when I can spent $10 and get something that changes how I play the game? But then I feel less inclined to do so because I can play the game and get the gun I could have paid $10 for.   This is coming from the guy with the $2,000 CS:GO inventory, and while no, I barely spent that much on CS:GO cosmetics (I only spent about $150, the rest was time, trading, investment, and luck), I feel less inclined to put a whole ton of money into PS2 for the reason I stated before.   There are a ton of better ways the PS2 cosmetics could be set up to make more money, but they just haven't done that. :/  Now, there's less of a way for newer players to have ANY sense of weapon diversity, which makes them look at the cost in DC, get disgusted, and leave. Not to mention that a fully useable gun isn't just the cert/DC cash on the buy tag, you need to drop generally at least 230 additional certs on it to make it worthwhile.   But just look at some of the cosmetics:  Why would I EVER buy composite armor for a class I love playing, especially since I can get the shiny auraxium armor by playing the class a lot.  Additionally, why would I buy armor in general since I can't see my player model aside from menu screens  Just seems silly. I do have a few camos though."
Planetside,3dp4i7,joevector,2,Sat Jul 18 03:41:12 2015 UTC,A few days? You could literally just spend an hour on the right planets dark sector and get 10x what you need for most weapons.

The only people who're still thinking about buying guns with SC are new players, and they're more likely to get disgusted and leave when they find out each one is seven bucks, IMO.  100-200-250 cert weapons exist to make the game itself more fun, more playable, more profitable in the long run.

And the only one I use these days is the Exceptional directive reward Black Camo.

Of course, that's not counting my single use camos left over from the WDS rewards.  And every time I go to change camos across all weapons/infantry/vehicles, I have to cycle through them via an incredibly slow, unintuitive click-spam list. THAT ticks me off. Assuming I only paid $2 per camo (which is being generous at that, considering only about half were on sale when I bought them), that's $210 in camos alone (In reality, I probably have paid about $350 for said camos over the past ~2.5 years).

Ive stopped buying camos, not because I cant afford or dont want them just their system to use and apply them is unwieldy, time consuming, scales badly the more we own and has almost no time saving or support routines coded in.

Since launch ive been asking for, lobbying, posting about needing a Continental Camo system, a small panel to set our choice to automatically change when we gate through, not just to be lazy but it would help DBG sell more camo too. As we know maximising revenue from their IP is not something which interests them so I guess we will never see it.  This is all down to one thing. DBG being too tight to hire enough damn UI programmers to go around. What is it? Are their UI tools only operable by people with 6 fingers per hand? Do they really not care about the mountain of UI bugs, niggles and feature improvements needing attention?  I already have a list of the top 30 UI elements that piss me off and it isnt finished yet (ill make a post out of it when it is). Why is UI such a problem?

Planetside,3dq5l9,CzerwonyKolorNicku,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:51:19 2015 UTC,Makes safe fall implant kinda essential.
Planetside,3dq5l9,Jerthy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:20:17 2015 UTC,Drifters are more for going forwards than down.
Planetside,3dq5l9,Spudtron98,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:18:08 2015 UTC,"They're useless for bailing out of aircraft or jumping off huge cliffs like on Indar because it's impossible to save yourself from extremely high drops.   If you jump off buildings or towers then you can slow yourself down pretty easily, you just have to stop yourself building up too much speed. Since they recharge really fast, you can tap it on and off as soon as you start to fall to slow you down. Only hold them on if you're about to hit the ground and you need as much thrust as possible to slow you to a stop without hurting yourself.  It's better to keep your fall distances as small as possible, on towers you can jump down from ledge to ledge. If you're on the very top, then don't jump all the way to the ground, drop to the top level with the landing pads and immediately jump down again. That way you can control your falls enough to avoid taking damage and still move fast.  With the other jets, your objective might be to stay on the rooftops and float from building to building you get to a high point and stay in high places. With Icarus, don't be afraid to get on the ground, the strength is in your ability to move upwards fast the movement is a lot more vertical than the others as you can constantly jump down and jet back up. You'll probably do more running than with the other jets.   I exclusively use the Icarus jets now because the others feel too slow, it's probably the fastest paced infantry gameplay. Think of yourself as a freerunner rather than someone who can fly."

Planetside,3dld68,AlexanderTheGreatly,32,Fri Jul 17 08:03:11 2015 UTC,"Dakka, it's the sound a gun makes.  It's from Warhammer 40k, one of the things Orks say. Aiming is too slow and makes it harder to see the explosions so to make up for that they just ramp up the volume. To be more accurate you need to shoot more.  Thus, NEVA ENUF DAKKA"
Planetside,3dld68,xSPYXEx,7,Fri Jul 17 08:13:06 2015 UTC,If you look at accuracy as your chances of hitting your target overall (i.e. munitions fired per volume vs. area target occupies) as opposed to efficiency of ammunition use to targets hit (which is how it's traditionally seen) this makes a lot of sense.

Planetside,3dmr6p,Erendil,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:45:10 2015 UTC,"Considering the fact that you got roadkilled by multiple different vehicles, I would say you weren't very far away from the fight.  I used to accept dumb rezzes too. . .and my non-rez KDR is way lower than my regular KDR because of it. Rez, die almost instantly. . .tack on hundreds of cheap deaths to my KDR with barely any kills to show for it after said rezzes, to lower my KD by more than half a point over what it would've been otherwise. Deaths I could have easily avoided by simply not taking the rezzes.  I guess if you don't care about KDR it doesn't matter, but considering you're running stat tracker I would assume you at least care a little bit. I'd suggest never taking a rez unless you are sure you are not in the line of sight of any enemies. Such as, you were running into a building with friendlies in it and no enemies, turned a corner and someone lagged some bullets onto you for a kill. Accepting a rez there is safe. But. . .if you died well outside the door to bullets, accepting that rez is likely to just get you killed again."

Smaller fights = less targets = lower KPH.  Plus, CQC fighters who throw themselves into the meat grinder will have a naturally higher KPH than flankers, marksmen, support players, people who stop ghost hacks, etc.  Also, spending time in VR, the Warpgate, the redeploy screen, etc can also drastically affect KPH."

Imo though, higher ACC and HSR are merely a means to getting KDR and KPH. ACC and HSR by itself with low KDR/KPH doesn't mean anything. You can simply be very selective and bullet count and only fire when you will get high acc/hsr, and sacrifice KDR/KPH over it. Which, imo, makes the high ACC/HSR not really worth anything."

I think in a lot of cases thankfully not most cases, but still a lot of them, the answer is no, this weapon is not very fun, and I would have been better served using another weapon.  At least certain guns you could argue are able to do something in the right niche, but after that no air lock ons if they have rank 1 stealth or higher, the striker definitely falls into that category.  In every situation that the you might want to use the striker, the grounder (our air lock on launcher) is just better.  It's better at killing tanks due to speed of unloading the rocket, range, and cone of fire.  Its better at shooting at air because less air have flares, and it has more range to lock on with.  It's also much better at shooting at maxes or infantry as both of those have some weird resist values to the striker due to its ability to spam.  So TL;DR the striker is really a poor choice in every circumstance currently the grounder is just better.  However I do agree that many weapons need fixing to make them the best in at least 1 situation."

The amount of correction needed at even medium ranges with Fractures makes them useless against moving targets.

Planetside,3dni37,Aurelius9,2,Fri Jul 17 21:41:29 2015 UTC,"The problem is that those 450 nanites go much further in a MAX than in a tank ATM. With a tank you get very good AV, moderately competent AI, and limited AA. With a MAX, you get AV that, for Ravens and to a lesser extent Vortexes, is bullshit-tier good, bullshit-tier AI, and arguably the best AA weapon in the game, all while being able to go places tanks could never dream of. Sure, MAXs have less health, but they're also a hugely smaller target for anyone not using an Archer or C4. MAXs are already far, far too versatile and buffing their AV capabilities only makes tanks further obsolete."

Planetside,3dni37,EclecticDreck,8,Fri Jul 17 18:58:00 2015 UTC,I don't think they should be worthless. But I also don't think that a raven max 600 meters away should be a bigger threat than an entire tank column.
Planetside,3dni37,Aurelius9,5,Fri Jul 17 19:21:32 2015 UTC,"I agree. Ravens are overtuned, Fractures are undertuned. There's a healthy medium to be found.

Planetside,3dni37,EclecticDreck,4,Fri Jul 17 19:38:16 2015 UTC,"I hate the whole Idea of Long range AV MAX weapons because of the balance problems it caused. MAX are mostly an infantry class, Infantry is supposed to be devastating at close range, but not a huge threat a long range.  Giving infantry long range supremacy made approaching bases almost impossible, and required the invention of a new weapon (The AMR) as a viable counter.  I would rather have Ravens/Vortex/Fractures been turned into something like a different type side-grade of short range AV, a specific Anti-MAX weapon, or some kind of short range Anti-Armor/Infantry hybrid weapon."
Planetside,3dni37,SpiroAgnewTR,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:44:08 2015 UTC,How does this make any sense?  Max costs as much to pull as a MBT. Should it not be able to fight back then?
Planetside,3dni37,EclecticDreck,5,Fri Jul 17 19:00:25 2015 UTC,A max with Ravens or Vortex can attack MBTs at ranges where the MBTs are powerless to stop them.  Fractures cannot.  Extremely potent long range AV carried by maxes is part of why Indar is constantly locked in that stupid T you see every time you log in.  The combination of being a small target that is highly durable and quickly repaired while being armed with weapons nearly as potent as what the MBT is armed with is bad.  Trying to exchange fire with such a target at 200+ meters is an extremely difficult feat.
Planetside,3dni37,Aurelius9,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:05:40 2015 UTC,"I guess most of my experience as AV max is less than 100 meters and probably mostly less than 50 meters. At those ranges it almost feels like tanks are too strong against maxes, as they kill in 2 shots and a max cannot even damage 1/2 a tank in that time."
Planetside,3dni37,EclecticDreck,2,Fri Jul 17 19:12:27 2015 UTC,"Up close, the fight between a tank and a max certainly favors the tank crew in a strict max versus tank fight.  The MAX still justifies its cost in this because it far more flexible in close quarters."
Planetside,3dni37,mostlyslylent,3,Fri Jul 17 19:21:32 2015 UTC,"Dreck's got a point. If I pull a skyguard, I might get a few kills before the cowardly farmers brave pilots make it over the horizon. But once they do, I might as well get out and leave the tank to rust. Not the case with Maxes, changing loadouts is no problemo there. Of course that's not reason enough to justify the nanite cost by itself, but it contributes."
Planetside,3dni37,VSDeggy,3,Fri Jul 17 20:08:54 2015 UTC,"You can pull bursters and once that problem is resolved, pull pounders and clear spawns or enemy maxes or mercies and butcher infantry.  It is pretty easy to make sure those nanites were spent well in a max - at least as far as I'm concerned.  I'm just guessing about the Mercies, though - I've not used a pure AI max in a real fight in nearly two years."
Planetside,3dni37,OldMaster80,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:54:30 2015 UTC,"If it is against a crew I absolutely believe they should have the advantage, but against a lightning or a MBT without a crew the max just feels weak."
Planetside,3dni37,nameredacted,2,Fri Jul 17 20:12:05 2015 UTC,"I've killed lots of lightnings in a pure 1v1 at under 50m with comets.  2/2 MBTs are trickier but given cover I simply need to avoid actually trading fire.  Being basically infantry gives you a lot of options for where you pop out and shoot after all.  Sure, a max in the open up close against a tank is doomed but why would you make that comparison?  A max is going to fight that tank from cover where it hits harder than a heavy and can shrug off a direct hit from AP."

I'm sure it's golden at mid range though. Now the albatross on the other hand, pfft that thing is nice. I can't compare the default to the carnage in live trials though.

Reaper for melting infantry at any range. Tross for very easy medium-long range kills. Carnage, probably the best close-medium weapon in the game, but horizontal recoil kinda limits its range. GR-22, powerhose version of Carnage, rather shit outside of CQC. Gauss Burst, currently weak, but on PTS it's even better than SABR in my opinion. Gauss Compact, don't go for this weapon, unless you want Gauss Rifle with SPA and shitty recoil pattern.   And, well, compared to TR and VS, TR may have easier to use close-medium ranged weapons with higher DPS, but their ARs are weak at range (SABR is the only exception), and VS with either low DPS weapons or short ranged (HV-45, Terminus)."

Planetside,3dpt1j,autosnakes,2,Sat Jul 18 07:29:43 2015 UTC,"I have a confession to make. I always run Compensator/1x/Grip and no SPA on my Armistice... And I primarily ADS. The reason is that up close it's still going to kill in 1 clip or slightly less. I just need it to be viable a bit farther out and it actually is, with this set up. With Laser/SPA and hip fire I had trouble even in Bio labs, where enemies can find partial cover all over the place... And I wasn't impressed while contesting the more open areas there either."
Planetside,3dpt1j,Kunavi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:19:15 2015 UTC,"they're on different ends of the spectrum. the armistice is good for spray and pray close range. on the other hand, the ns smgs are pretty damn accurate when hip firing so you get better range. /u/Renuse-Sol-Ex is one of the more famous players who abuses the range of the NS smgs"
Planetside,3dpt1j,captainpyotr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:38:06 2015 UTC,Why is it abuse when its hard to move fast and get headshots at the same time?  The NS-7 PDW is great with ranged hipefire headshots. Adv laser and Soft point is all you need for the MKV or the NS-7.   Armistace is a good CQC body shot SMG. Silencers help too.   GLHF.
Planetside,3dpt1j,Renuse-Sol-Ex,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:15:29 2015 UTC,"The Armistice is a bullet hose, while the NS SMGs are more like a light carbine."
Planetside,3dpt1j,fredrikpedersen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:15:00 2015 UTC,"Quoting Besaba from here   SMG-46 Armistice is also known as ""Farmistice"", while the PDW 16 Hailstorm was dubbed by players ""Failstorm"". This should give you a general idea of how these two guns relate to each other.   Armistice has highest DPS among SMGs, but due to crazy rate fire, any misses are punished severely. Shoot past the target for a second, and there goes half of your magazine. Armistice also has the shortest range, because - as all 125 damage weapons - it still has the same CoF bloom per shot as 143 damage weapons, so during sustained fire it grows inaccurate quite fast. Consequences: Out of all SMGs, Armistice gets the most benefit from ALS, and the least benefit from Extended Mags. ALS recommended.  Among 1st gen SMGs, Armistice is hurt the least by the Suppressor due to highest in class rate of fire.  Failstorm, on the other hand, has lowest DPS among SMGs, and it's not compensated in any way except for highest damage per magazine. In good faith, I cannot recommend using this weapon, for anyone, ever, for any reason. But if you do - keep in mind that it isn't suited for direct engagements, so using it for flanking is recommended.   (at the end there he's talking about the Hailstorm)"
Planetside,3dpt1j,fredrikpedersen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:05:37 2015 UTC,slap on a suppressor and go full infiltrate. pick your engagements and position yourself for maximum headshot capability. the armistice will reward you.
Planetside,3dpt1j,trit0Ch,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:03:28 2015 UTC,"It's excellent for CQB, but count on using the compensator + extended mags if you want to kill anything beyond 20m."

If, for example, you can only spawn at the warpgate, you'd see much more tactical play across the board with very deliberate and skilled play dominating the rest.    Currently though we're in casualshitter/CoD territory where its run'n'gun, deaths dont matter and numbers mean more than tactics - nowadays, killing someone removes them from the fight for a whopping 15s of respawn delay and running back to the frontline."
Planetside,3dr5gg,tim-o-matic,3,Sat Jul 18 17:42:00 2015 UTC,That would be great but there is too many people who hop in for quick shooting session or fun. It'd make the game rather... unpleasant for them.

I also wanted every frontline base to not have a spawnroom unless it were a major facility; defenders and attackers would be able to leverage armour to destroy each other's spawns. If the only way to spawn was to die within the hex, and the only way to get into the hex was via vehicles, you'd see 12/12 sunderers rolling down the road escorted by MBTs, actual ambush meta, AMAZING serversmash strats, incredible depth of play especially between bases, hossin foot-infiltration.

Planetside,3dr5gg,FuzzBuket,2,Sat Jul 18 18:50:25 2015 UTC,"Are you for real? In a game this large, with so many unpredictable ways to die and such a short TTK, you would have all spawn options other than the warpgate eliminated? The game looks pretty, but not pretty enough to persuade me to sit through 5-15 minute driving/flying sessions every time I die. Not to mention the fact that if your horrible suggestion were to be implemented the resource system would have to be changed considerably: both the tic per minute and total pool would need a substantial increase. Finally, you should know this would be the death of the game. The vast, vast majority of people playing Planetside 2 are in it for the instant fun they can get out of it. You do not want to alienate them. If that's the kind of game you wanna play you already have several you can pick out of without trying to force this one into that mold."
Planetside,3dr5gg,0vidius,-1,Sat Jul 18 19:00:10 2015 UTC,"so many unpredictable ways to die     If you are running in an organised squad/outfit with a carefully planned route of advance, with advance forces including but not limited to a vanguard and scout elements, an unexpected death means you either fucked up in planning, analysis and intelligence collection, or your enemy outplayed you by evading detection and coming from an unexpected direction. You also failed to plan for contingencies and should fire your S3.     The game looks pretty, but not pretty enough to persuade me to sit through 5-15 minute driving/flying sessions every time I die.     A well developed transport and logistics train will only take at most a minute to fly you to a forward staging area where you dismount and load up land based transport for infiltration or join the main effort. Max 2mins and most likely much less - IF a medic failed to revive you.     The vast, vast majority of people playing Planetside 2 are in it for the instant fun they can get out of it. You do not want to alienate them.     You are very right in saying how most of these kids only want instant gratification - this is the CoD generation. 'More shooty, less thinky' is the formula for success as of late. Which is why this will never work in todays' world, that much is clear. It would be amazing if it did; think of the amount of depth of strategy and tactics that would factor into the outcome of a game. Where a 3:1 can be lost to skilled players and genius commanders. Where a group of 12 elites can shut down a horde of idiots in a raid on their logistics support. Where serversmash would actually be exciting to watch.    Lastly, there is no other game like Planetside 2. ArmA can go suck a dick with its abysmal player count. BF is not any better than PS2. CoD can die in a house fire.    So, if all thats just a pipe dream, why bother? Well because i think a compromise between that extreme and our current state of affairs can be a pragmatic choice:    No need to remove AMS.    I've always advocated for armour pushes to be a necessary step in attacking the next base. Hence my extreme hate for redeployside, the 1km beacon, and overly forgiving spawns.

I'm 26, never played CoD online and grew up with fast paced shooters such as Quake and UT. I like games that require good movement and aiming. Im not interested in milsim games, nor the strategic aspect of carefully planning and executing an attack plan, beyond the very basics of flanking and taking priority objectives. I'm in it for the core FPS gameplay. I don't like leading and I often disagree with orders given by others. I don't want my enjoyment of the game to be strictly tied to other people. Individual effectiveness is essential to me. I want to be able to log in at 2 am and have fun. I daresay most players also enjoy this type of freedom. You might yet get your MMO version of Arma some day, but I think the direction the game went was the right one.

I am in the top 0.5% or higher according to my stats in terms of aim (hsr, acc, kpm, kdr, whatnot - and i dont intentionally pad them). I love the core FPS mechanic of this game. Its pretty solid. I just feel that it lacks the wrapper and meta that gives intelligence an importance.      I also dont think a full on ArmA fuckfest is the way to go. Its too dry. CS is a good in between - you need good (read:sick) aim to play in the highest tiers of gameplay, but that alone wont be enough by far - good planning, execution, game knowlege, map knowledge, flow control, gamesense, and most importantly teamwork&communication is vital. PS2 lacks in that portion, where nothing matters but basic gamesense and aim. Theres no game environment that justifies complicated strats, no depth at all. And that's boring and not challenging. So, in removing some convenience factors, im hoping that it would open up room for much deeper meta and strategy. Things that require a good brain to execute."

The issue with Planetside is that you can't compartmentalize the game at all since it's one persistent world, so you are left with a choice: keep things as they are or remove convenience at the risk of alienating players and thus potential customers? To what extent can they remove convenience without reaching that point? This is why they hesitate to make any drastic changes although the vocal minority might be clamoring for them. They need to gauge how far they can go and the only way of doing so is through very slight changes that are bound to leave people unsatisfied."

Planetside,3dpk2w,autosnakes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:41:50 2015 UTC,"um well, most everyone runs a tank buster, i personally run max vehicle stealth (very expensive for the last rank but i dont show up on the minimap at all so its very useful) and afterburners, a TON of people run afterburners, they get pricey but rank 1 is still very viable. and the runs all depend on the situation. i run a tank buster/thermals duster/walker when i do infantry fly bys, or a tankbuster/dahlton/walker when i do vehicle combat. i used to run the bulldog and its still viable, if the belly gunner can be super accurate (aka a crazy good shot with the dahlton). but preferably get the walker. once you get more certs and more progress u can tweak it how ever u want.   tldr: TB with belly gun of choice (situational), walker, high G, afterburners, and utility slot of choice."

Planetside,3dpk2w,DntKilMe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:26:58 2015 UTC,"I find Precision frame's more maneuverable, High G is better in that you won't necessarily crash when on fire... But the idea is to not get to that point too often ;P  TankBuster is a must, max mag size obviously. I always mount Drake as AA and instead of evading, the pilot and I attempt to keep only a small gap between us and the ESF intercepting. I did try the Walker but at the range at which I am effective with it, the Drake is more reliable. You'd think I could drive ESFs closing in away with the Walker but the Drake is better up close, and at range I have no idea where my Walker's bullets are going, no matter how I lead I hit nothing. I used to rely on Hyenas but expert pilots will only be hit by 1/3 of the missiles. Stealth negates its lock too, and we're not talking serious damage or even deterring at 1/3 of its mag. It's also useless against ground. If the tail gunner is pro, use BullDog. Obvious advantages include better ground farming. Basically I suggest Drake or BullDog if you're good.  If you've spotted an infantry farm, bring a Duster(There, I said it). You don't have to worry about aiming, your pilot won't have to maneuver above the target area as much, and you're getting random kills you don't deserve, IF you find clusters of infantry and Sunderers where everyone keeps spawning there, despite you dumping bombs blindly all over. Be warned, the Duster is absolutely USELESS in any other scenario. If you want to go vehicle hunting, use a Dalton or Zepher and work with your pilot softening them up(If not outright killing them). I'd pick the Zepher for that, I've no idea what they've done with the Dalton but I can no longer snipe reliably with it - Compensating for bullet drop and leading in any direction depending on what your pilot is doing is not what I want to do 80% of my belly gun time, just to get that one shot on an ESF or smoking MBT. I know Dalton is excellent against ESF if you can snipe with it, I know you can TB+Dalton more reliably than TB+Zepher against vehicles but I can't bother and Zepher is more versatile in the end.  As for the rest, we use a mix of ABs, Flares, Stealth, Comp Armour. The pilot is not comfortable enough in the Lib yet, for us to use the fabled Fire Suppression+AutoRep combo. We've tried it but all it did for us at this skill level is help get up in the air faster... But the way we play is all about staying near a populated target area as long as possible and farm ground.  Wish I could help more but we're not too skilled yet so I have nothing else to add- And I do know some of the things me and my pilot prefer to use are the exact opposite of what experts will tell you but I feel in the end if the other Lib sees you first and doesn't miss, then it doesn't matter. Same for sloped MBTs which you didn't spot or 2-3 Burster MAX(Because population). Or an ESF gang.  One last thing about the Duster - There'll be instances where you will get no kills at all, don't be discouraged. Instead just make another pass quickly, keep at it. Also there's a certain sweet spot when it comes to how close to the ground your pilot should fly but it's easy to find and not too risky."
Planetside,3dpk2w,Alien51,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:41:39 2015 UTC,"Any opinions on the Shredder? Been certing into it a little since I haven't unlocked the Dalton yet.

Unless you can keep your back absolutely upright (as in a safety squat), which most likely you cant, there is way to much torque and strain put on to your lower spine, including your hips flexors. Lots of strength and conditioning coaches are actual getting away from them. Front squats and safety squats would be a better alternative.  Im assuming OP is referring to free bb back squats.

Also essentially means you can not spawn and instantly swap to a max... You will always use more resources than your numbers because of nades and things.  Can I suggest you play the game for a bit longer before you try to change everything? You have only played for a total of about 150 hours over 3 characters, you can't really judge the game on that.  Also, infi at BR 10 to teach the cod kiddies sniping isn't cool? New snipers are useless... If they kill you a lot then you are just inexperienced or bad... Move more it is fine.   There is no reason for your idea apart from ""I hate heavys and infis so I want to dress this idea up as something constructive so I see less of them""  Rest assured this idea is fucking awful  Don't worry if you play more you will learn to counter snipers, heavys, smg infis and everything else you rage from."

Planetside,3dlem3,KixSix,2,Fri Jul 17 13:30:39 2015 UTC,well if you are going to classify behaviour that merely annoys other players as an exploit... oi
Planetside,3dlem3,Define_It,-4,Fri Jul 17 13:53:22 2015 UTC,"so the full spectrum banner (pride banner) is an exploit since it made some people log out of the game due to the annoyance?   no, because the banner was implemented by devs intentionally.   Also, how does it benefit anyone to have players log out?   uh, less enemies?   Did the developers intend for the existence of the reverse maneuver? I highly doubt it. So is that an exploit then?   they probably did not intend it, but then they clarified that they want to keep it that way, and that thus it is fine to use it"
Planetside,3dlem3,shaql,0,Fri Jul 17 14:00:16 2015 UTC,"uh, less enemies?   so you feel a benefit when there are less enemies to fight against?  that just sounds boring.   they probably did not intend it, but then they clarified that they want to keep it that way, and that thus it is fine to use it   which makes that part of their definition of an exploit inconsistent in application.

Then youll get another charger drop in 1-2h anyway.  They did increase the amount of charge given on a single drop, from 800, to 1800.  A Tier1 at half per second now gives you an hour per charger.  Thing is, youll be getting multiple T1s and T2s you dont need drop as you play, you only need x1 of each skill on any tier, so you can x5 every single spare T1 you have into T2s, then x5 spare T2s you have to T3s, then do 1xT3 + 1xT2 to make an ultra charger. This you supplements your charger drops with 24000 energy each time and both together you can sustain easily T1 24/7 even if you live in a tent on amerish for most of your time. T2 24/7 shouldnt be hard with sustained play and even T3 can be balanced if you are a well equipped and higher XP generating class.  Use the boring time in between caps to craft up these spare T1-2. Keep stocks of T3s so you can see when you are ahead and maybe can afford a T4 (but they chew up dat energy, its best not to use them unless you really have to, are near mlgpro levels of xp to make enough ultras or buy energy top ups with certs/dc).  As you go through your loadouts try and think of the best for each different role, they will vary but if all else fails one of the most useful general purpose ones is actually the default T1 they give to start, enhanced targeting, and its the cheapest to run too."

I typically dump in a few when an alert pops up and I know I will be around for the full time period.  I can pretty much run T1's full time w/o thinking about it off of dropped chargers.  Over the past 2mo, I've managed to unlock all but two of the T3 implants.   After that, all of my extras will go into making ultra chargers.

If don't play only as HA you will get tons of implants and chargers, combine T2 and T3 implants for Ultra Charges, boom - infinite energy.  On Live the only implants worth using though, are:   Regen if you don't carry med-kits (tier 1 is more than enough) Battle hardened for medics with self-heal and HA with medkits (it helps a lot in gunfights) Hold breath for sniping with weapons with 6x-12x zoom (self-explanatory I guess) EOD hud if you hate stepping on AP mines, extremely useful for MAXes, useful for ground vehicles Sensor shield for sneaky infiltrators and LAs (just remember that sprinting and jumping will still reveal you to recon tools) Enhanced targeting for dedicated AV infantry, AV MAXes, pilots, gunners Safe fall when you use Icarus jump jets (it's really easy to die while using those :D) Awareness for pilots (there is nothing better when you are jumped by full stealth ESF)"
Planetside,3dml9e,CzerwonyKolorNicku,2,Fri Jul 17 15:26:36 2015 UTC,You forgot the EMP shield that makes EMP-filtrators godlike. Tier4 negates 90% of the effect. So you can throw it on yourself for extra magic.

Nope, Safe Fall 3 or 4 will do that trick as well; hosed them down as they break themselves in the air because I  beat them to the ground."

Just about anyone can keep a T1 going indefinitely without investing certs/DC, and most can keep T2s relatively easily. I consider myself slightly above average, and I can sustain a mix of T2/T3 without crafting chargers (could easily do a T3/T4 mix with charger crafting, but T4s aren't worth the energy drain).    None of the implants are ""game breaking"" or entirely necessary, but if they're free the fact that people refuse to use them blows my mind. even just regen 1...."
Planetside,3dml9e,BCKrogoth,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:59:35 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  The edge implants provide is, at best, a small one.  Even if you're good it will rarely be the reason you won a fight.  Having said that, they do offer enough utility to be worth running.  Regeneration frees light assaults and infiltrators to carry explosives rather than medkits, for example."
Planetside,3dml9e,EclecticDreck,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:11:27 2015 UTC,"Very much so. About the only two implants I run are Awareness, which is T3, and the highest level of Battle Hardened I currently own. Awareness is handy whenever you're flying or running armor, since it auto-spots anything that damages you, but it most definitely isn't mandatory. Battle Hardened on my Medium and Heavy Assault classes makes it easier to chain headshots because it reduces flinch, but again it's just a slight convenience. I've recently been playing on a new character and have no implants and I'm doing fine."
Planetside,3dml9e,Mytiske,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:29:12 2015 UTC,Never run implants myself. You'll be fine without it. I do however suggest you putting on safe fall on your engi if you like driving your harasser/flash to deployed sunderer. That's how I farmed my tank mine and deployed ams kills.

Even if you're not a killing machine with an auraxium membership, you earn plenty of implants through regular play, which you can craft into chargers to keep you constantly topped up (as long as you stick to rank 1 implants which have cheap upkeep).  I'd say, ignore them for now until you collect a couple dozen, then combine them into super chargers and get 90000+ energy, at that point you can start toying with them and see if you find one that helps your playstyles."

Lately I've been using Regen 4 on every load out just to see if it's even possible to run out of energy. Still have 64 chargers left after a month or so of doing that so we'll see how long it takes."
Planetside,3dml9e,PGxFrotang,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:43:08 2015 UTC,"there are several T1 implants that can be extremely useful and their energy sipping nature makes them arguably more desirable than their higher tier ""upgrades"" as it allows a capable player to equip them almost indefinitely as it is possible to earn/craft chargers faster than you use the energy.   Enhanced Targeting, the default implant, very useful for engaging vehicles/MAX as it's ability to show remaining health can tell you how to engage various targets.  Also useful for kill stealing :P EOD1 highlights mines/C4 from 10m away, plenty of distance to react as infantry, except for maybe a charging MAX.  Higher tiers of EOD, such as EOD4 only become necessary when you're in a vehicle and need that extra distance to either swerve to avoid or come to a stop, and even then the 25m of EOD4 might not be enough if you're going full speed. Regeneration 1 with the only difference in tiers being 4% at 1, 5% at 2, 6% at 3, and 7% at 4, this means its only a matter of seconds in total heal time difference, Regen 1 will fully heal you in less than 25 seconds once it kicks in.  This implant can help mitigate the loss of med kits in favor of explosives, very useful for engineers playing a support role with vehicles. Battle Hardened 1 makes a ton of sense to run if you're in a combat loadout and are carrying med kits, the higher tiers are tangibly better, but not necessarily worth the extra cost of energy."
Planetside,3dml9e,Steelering,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:07:45 2015 UTC,"I just run the lvl 1 health regeneration implant on every class (except MAX), thats always useful and enough. And it never drains on your energy ressources, still have about 500 chargers and they dont run low."
Planetside,3dml9e,Weltenstuermer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:10:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think they've changed. I didn't use implants for over a year after they came out. I didn't believe in them. Then one day I decided to craft all my implants in one go, and ended up with all of them. 99% of the time I just run regen 1 or enhanced targeting for a nice little bonus.  Like others have said, it's mostly situational. Clear vision can be a life-saver when you're defending a crowded point room that is getting nuked with concs and flashbangs. Same for the EMP one. EOD HUD 3 is nice if you drive around a lot, especially in Hossin swamps or behind gate shields you're about to bust through where you can't see mines.  What no one should ever do is spend money on implants/chargers. I think a good rule of thumb is this: if you're running tier 3 implants all the time, you need to average about 300xp/minute (18,000 xp/hour). Then you are usually getting enough charger and implant drops to sustain the energy usage. Craft one tier 2 charger and one tier 3 charger occasionally to get an ultra charger, which provides 24,000 energy."
Planetside,3dml9e,klaproth,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:26:54 2015 UTC,"yep, I still don't use them and manage to do rather well."
Planetside,3dml9e,kna5041,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:34:34 2015 UTC,Implants are entirely optional and most only benefit narrow situations.   The hubbub from last year was entirely unjustified. Do everyone a favor and put the pay to win concerns in a bag. Now drown those concerns in a river.   Drops are common. Energy is.common. The playing field is level.
Planetside,3dml9e,GetYourAssToSpace,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:38:45 2015 UTC,"Implants are great. They're not needed in a lot of cases, but they can enhance you greatly. If you suck, they won't be very useful, but if you're decent or good the benefits are sizeable enough to notice.   EoD 2 on infantry will save you over and over again from mines. Don't bother running it on vehicles as mines are still buggy as far as rendering goes last I checked. Battlehardened will help you get chain headshots more easily. You'll usually notice the difference pretty quick when going from a high rank of BH to a different implant. Regen is good if you don't plan on using medkits. Tier 1 is okay, but kinda meh. 2 and 3 are great. 4 is basically infinite resto kits. Safe landing: you'll pretty much never need more than rank  2 unless you're just planning on being silly and jumping off buildings for fun and other crazy stuff. If you're a pilot you can get some benifit from the higher ranks if you want to bail. Enhanced targeting: not terribly useful as infantry as the ttk is so low that someone at half health.is no different than someone at full, but it's amazing on vehicle playstyles. Can't say much for awareness, but I hear some say it's good. Marker, EMP shield, and clear vision are basically worthless IMO due to how little use they get. The opportunity cost is too high to run them. EMP shield can be good on an infiltrator with EMP brando though.   Even a complete newb can maintain a tier 1. Just make sure to only craft ultra chargers and not regular or supers. Higher ranks are definitely useful though, but aren't going to make youb invincible or anything."

Planetside,3do1q9,hdnine,6,Fri Jul 17 21:01:37 2015 UTC,"It is possible to get 5 exceptional weapons right now, it would just cost a lot of money.  Weapons:   NS-11P: Buy a J!NX shirt.  Included will be a code for an NS-11P and a J!NX decal Cost: $21.99 plus shipping Golden SMG (Eridani, Armistice, & Cyclone): EU physical edition. Actually a pretty good deal, includes three guns, and some DBC.  Cost: Whatever the seller wants.  Good luck. Golden Pistol (Beamer, Repeater, & Mag-shot): Codes given out at various events. Includes SOE Live, PAX, and other events.  Very scalper heavy, so very expensive.  Cost: Good luck. Campion: $5 in depot Harrower: ""               ""   So it is possible to get 5 exceptional weapons right now without waiting for promotions, but waiting for promotions might be a better idea.  The anniversary bundles are usually pretty good, so check those out in November.  I would be surprised if you got all that I listed for under $75, but you might get lucky."
Planetside,3do1q9,Ultimatestormer,5,Fri Jul 17 23:14:27 2015 UTC,"I feel that Exceptional weapons should all give credit toward both the black camo and the directive of the weapon's type.  For example: I auraxiumed the Phoenix AE. I feel that because it's an Exceptional Directive weapon, it should give me credit toward the Rocket Launcher directive, as well as the current benefit that it gave me to unlock my black camo.  This would have 4 major benefits, all without creating balance issues, and it would make both the players and DBG happy.   1) Players who don't yet have the black camo currently have to choose what they want to go for, even though they're using the exact same weapon type (SMG, AR, LMG, Pistol, etc).   They must ask themselves: ""Do I use my NS-11A for the AR directive, or do I  use a perfect duplicate for my black camo and have to aurax multiple versions of the same weapon type?""  This forces you to choose between simple reskins, even though they are the same exact weapon with a different letter or so in the name and an alternate skin, essentially forcing them to do extra work on that weapon category.   2)  Players who do already have the black camo have absolutely zero reason to purchase or use new Exceptional weapons.  They no longer serve a purpose other than to junk up your inventory with move variants of the same old weapon.   If they did count toward each given weapon's directive category as well, players who don't have to worry about the exceptional directive could once again find use for them (IE, if you need just one more SMG, but don't like the feel to the PDW and the MKV, the gold SMG removes the need to do one of them and you're free to only need one, rather than both.  As the exceptional weapons are now, I avoid using the ones that I do have that are not auraxed so I can instead use the exact same weapons that will give me directive credit. (IE, I used and auraxed the NS-44 over my 44P so I could get my Sidearm directive done, even though I would have prefered to use the platinum version because of it's beautiful special pattern on the sides.)   3) Because they would be reducing strain on your requirements, they would be far more valuable to players, both as a shiny swag item, and as a valuable weapon to use on the field as they would ""kill two birds with one stone"" so to speak. This would no doubt greatly increase sales of them, as they would obviously be highly desirable. 4) Exceptional weapons practically NEVER go on sale.   There was that whole ""2x station cash event unintentionally crossing over with the PS2 anniversary bundle sale"" that effectively allowed you to purchase the 2 year AE bundle for half off, but other than that, Exceptional weapons are generally ""Buy it full price, or don't get it at all. You have X amount of days to decide"".  And these bundles/deals/sales generally represent a significant investment (certainly the primary weapon ones do!)  The Anniversary bundles cost $40 US each (so you're paying a minimum of $40 into the game), the NS-11P currently costs a +$20 payment on your end to get it. The SMG's cost somewhere around $15 originally when it was coming straight from SOE, and the gold pistols required you either recuit a significant number of players to the game (and only those that spent a minimum of $10 into the game counted) or you attend a triple digit entrance fee at PAX (plus travel fees, and finally the purchase costs of the cards once you were there).  So they are rarely cheap. (There are some that are available for certs, but those have all been gimped pistols (flare/snowball/candy guns), or knives (Icikill)."

Planetside,3do1q9,theducksReddit,2,Sat Jul 18 02:06:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the flare/snowball guns are painfully bad.  IMO, they should go up from the Underbosses damage model to the crossbow's damage model (375 max damage to 625).  That would make them more viable, without being quite as competitive as normal sidearms."
Planetside,3do1q9,TheKhopesh,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:31:07 2015 UTC,"yeah, imo they should at least be able to shot knife cause they cant even do that now and they have a 2 second reload. the shot kinfe made it at least possible to get the titles and stuff but not super good."
Planetside,3do1q9,theducksReddit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:49:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figure:  The crossbow has a 1 second rechamber time between each shot of it's 4 round mag, plus a couple seconds reload and better range.  The flare/snowball guns have a 2 second reload between each shot, and everything else is far far worse.  So I can't see it having any issues with getting the 625 damage tier.  At least that would allow for EMP+shot and shot+knife use."

Planetside,3dkchc,SpiroAgnewTR,2,Fri Jul 17 11:03:50 2015 UTC,"I'm getting kind of tired of this justification. 650 for an anti-air rocket launcher is an enormous depletion from starter certs that should go towards other things, like suit slots, abilities, medkits, scopes and attachments, et cetera.  And even with that, the AA rocket launcher is more of a deterrence tool than anything - any fairly good ESF pilot can fly away before you can obtain a lock, and even if you DO get the lock they can still run the missile into terrain.  That said, it is a very important tool - it's a sidegrade, but it's a REALLY important one. Jacking up the price to 650 means you can't get a vehicle weapon, or a few more ranks of Nanoweave or ASC, or your bolt action sniper rifle (which is ALSO more expensive)."

Planetside,3dkchc,SpiroAgnewTR,3,Fri Jul 17 08:04:38 2015 UTC,I still use the stock vanu sniper as a dmr at slightly longer ranges than the midrange semi sniper. It fits a good niche for rapid followup shots and picking off injured enemies.   It really comes down to how you use it imo.
Planetside,3dkchc,Korsakov829,2,Fri Jul 17 04:15:00 2015 UTC,"I personally see the semiscouts as saying ""anything you can do, I can do better"" to the default TR/VS weapons. Yes, they have a very slight niche, but that niche is so slight that you're generally better off using a lighter BSAR"

Planetside,3dkchc,Mustarde,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:17:16 2015 UTC,the issue isnt that it is completely unusable. the issue is that its completely unusable for new players. honestly most of the players that could use it well have enough time in the game that they have enough certs to buy something else.

Planetside,3dkchc,SinJackal,2,Fri Jul 17 02:38:22 2015 UTC,SemiScouts and the low-zoom SemiSnipers do that better and more consistently.   Scope sway+too much recoil fucks you over.
Planetside,3dkchc,SinJackal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:07:27 2015 UTC,"as i have pointed out many, times before.  the semi auto snipers ( both high and low zoom) are designated marksman weapons designed for accurate support fire.  on a wounded target they have more kills/mag than their BASR counterparts, while maintaining the same amount of kills per mag on unwounded targets."
Planetside,3dkchc,SinJackal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:54:03 2015 UTC,"potential kills/mag doesn't make the gun any better.   For the sake of similarity, I will compare the 99SV to the SR-7  The SR-7's damage ends where the 99SV's starts. This means that the target can have more HP than the 99SV and still be dropped by the SR-7.  Headshot arguments go completely out the window when one has the potential to one-shot and the other does not.   The 99SV will never outshine the SR-7 except in two situations: you see a group of 10 enemies who are all inches from death, or you somehow ran out of ammo for your pistol and need to spam-fire to kill the guy who just found you.  Buuut since you're generally really removed from the fight (as you generally will be with a 6x scope or higher), the magazine size hardly matters since you'll only be taking out one or two enemies at a time.   The M77-B has a decent niche due to its lower zoom and lack of scope sway, so I'm fine with it."
Planetside,3dkchc,TinfoilHatMan420,2,Fri Jul 17 05:13:09 2015 UTC,"I'd rather use a scout rifle in that situation, scope sway on the 99SV and pitiful damage make it stink."
Planetside,3dkchc,Dimitri0029,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:09:24 2015 UTC,"Regardless, the 99SV hits harder and has faster bullets more suitable for distant, moving enemies. It is also useful at harassing maxes (assuming those maxes are not Raven maxes). Again, I am not saying it's a great gun, I'm just saying that it can be used and is occasionally useful."
Planetside,3dkchc,trit0Ch,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:34:30 2015 UTC,It would be suitable for more distant enemies if the recoil wasn't so high on it.
Planetside,3dkchc,Mustarde,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:09:58 2015 UTC,"Again, the recoil is a non-issue. The scope resettles on the exact same spot, all you have to do is allow it to. The only thing that the recoil affects is the rate of fire because you have to time your shots. Because the 6x scope recoils so visibly, it actually makes it less confusing to use at long range than medium."
Planetside,3dkchc,AyresTargayren,2,Fri Jul 17 07:07:50 2015 UTC,"I thoroughly enjoyed my time battle rifling with the 99SV. It's not a long range brain surgeon, get stuck in."
Planetside,3dkchc,Mustarde,7,Fri Jul 17 01:23:36 2015 UTC,Well there's the KSR-35 which is the same exact gun but much more useable since it can equip optics 1x -> 4x.  But needing to buy a whole other gun just to use different optics is really fucking stupid IMO.
Planetside,3dkchc,DemolitionCowboyX,2,Fri Jul 17 01:26:48 2015 UTC,"The KSR actually sacrifices a bit of damage and a considerable amount of velocity for the no-sway optics. I think this is probably why they are separate guns, more than anything else."
Planetside,3dkchc,TheFullCologne,3,Fri Jul 17 01:56:11 2015 UTC,"The damage is the same, but the velocity is only a tiny bit slower (500m/s vs 550m/s). It doesn't make a noticeable difference."

The base design knowledge, the fact that infiltration relies on knowing 'player flow' towards objectives, and excellent aim/game knowledge/awareness of enemy loadouts (dont try to tackle heavies without good aim, for example) would make it a frustrating experience.

Unless it really is 500 per level on PC; it should only take around 200 until the upper tiers.
Planetside,3dmbqh,Epix_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:22:37 2015 UTC,"i hope so, but i wont risk my next 500c on the theory :P it should only cost 30c for rank 2, 50 for rank 3 and 100 for rank 4 (all of them i would have bought by now if it were so)"
Planetside,3dmbqh,Epix_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:31:10 2015 UTC,"Well I know this how it works with Engineer for a fact. I suspect it's the same for infiltrator, but I feel you."
Planetside,3dmbqh,thesmarm,3,Fri Jul 17 15:38:44 2015 UTC,Because cloak is clearly OP so we have to nerf infil at every other corner.
Planetside,3dmbqh,steele83,3,Fri Jul 17 13:28:18 2015 UTC,"cloak deserves a buff IMO (and is getting one IIRC, (crouch) walking less visible then sprinting? yes please), and the 100 less HP is insulting, we already have worse weapons then other classes except for very long range. but we are ""lower armored"" so i guess it fits :/  more annoying is only a half blind moron cant see you while outside of deepcloak, everyone else lights you up instantly. im 4 scout rifle kills from completing the infiltrator expert directive and im still regularely frustrated by the near useless cloak, weaker weapons (they arent horrible, but outclassed in a lot of situations) and lower HP (though nanoweave fixes that somewhat)"
Planetside,3dmbqh,dahazeyniinja,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:23:46 2015 UTC,Cloak is getting a buff on PC soon.  The changes were made to the test server.  I'm assuming PS4 will get these as well at some point.
Planetside,3dmbqh,VSWanter,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:28:00 2015 UTC,"They already did, especially in this regard- remember when most bases had at least one extra infantry weapons terminal outside the defender's spawn, and how most of them were removed for 'optimization' with no regards to gameplay effects?"

Planetside,3dmbqh,EclecticDreck,4,Fri Jul 17 13:46:58 2015 UTC,I'm surprised they haven't tried to make money by selling an implant for that.
Planetside,3dmbqh,BiotykNC,3,Fri Jul 17 13:05:49 2015 UTC,It absolutely does need to be obvious.  Infiltrators get motion sensors to cover themselves with and given how important a terminal hack can be for a successful attack or defense the people on the other side of the hack need to know that it's happening.
Planetside,3dmbqh,0rex,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:17:13 2015 UTC,"my issue with motion sensor its a bigger giveaway then the hacking animation :/ but i understand where you are coming from, guess it makes sense"
Planetside,3dmbqh,Nikye_VS,3,Fri Jul 17 14:25:04 2015 UTC,The motion sensor is your single biggest asset as an infiltrator.  It isn't your cloak or your gun or your hacking tools.  Information is your weapon.    Yes it lets people know an infiltrator is operating in the area but that is vague nonspecific non-actionable information.  And with up to 50m worth of advanced warning you have a fair chance to defend yourself.  SMGs do a hell of a lot of damage very quickly after all.
Planetside,3dmbqh,Nikye_VS,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:28:33 2015 UTC,"im still stuck at half that range, the upgrades are pricy. guess ill dump 200c to get it to 35m range and 180s duration"
Planetside,3dmbqh,Nikye_VS,2,Fri Jul 17 14:32:47 2015 UTC,"Level 3 is where the motion sensor gets enough range to really become a critically important tool.  The last level upgrade is one of those painful 1000c investments which, sadly, is extremely valuable.  Without resupply you have enough sensor time (in theory) to last through a long cap of any base and the 50m radius means you can blanket virtually all of any single point base with a single sensor!"
Planetside,3dmbqh,Nhauv,2,Fri Jul 17 14:38:34 2015 UTC,I've finished Objective Support with it and it wasn't that hard. Bigger issue was the timer between the hacks so you need to use stop watch to not miss any exp :D
Planetside,3dmbqh,Nhauv,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:41:44 2015 UTC,"Actually hacking on PC won't trigger from time to time. Sometimes i have to press 'E' for 3-5 times and to move mouse to hit ""the right place"" on terminal/turret. This shit is frustrating, because for squishy infiltrator time is always of the essence. But it used to be worse like half a year ago, so thx DBG that hacking is working at least somehow. Idk if there is such a problem on PS4."
Planetside,3dmbqh,KixSix,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:55:29 2015 UTC,"we have something similar, pressing square normally slowly fills a circle aroudn the square symbol while hacking, but often the first 1-3 tries it just fills up instantly and does nothing, making me take at least 50% longer per hack"
Planetside,3dmb40,andy2671,5,Fri Jul 17 12:48:27 2015 UTC,I think that is the idea if they follow up on the naval expansion. Bunch of small islands to play on with a lot of sea and then play on ships/frigates/carriers etc.

Planetside,3dm6w1,thereckoning723,8,Fri Jul 17 12:00:17 2015 UTC,Ouch. Baffling why it isn't more popular (PC included) as it's one of a kind in a sea of boring claustrophobic arena shooters.  As others have said there will be server mergers which will help. It will be worth the wait once you are on a server with enough players to make the big fights possible.
Planetside,3dm6w1,evilsooty,10,Fri Jul 17 13:08:19 2015 UTC,"people like being told they are good, and they like feeling special and important.  in planetmans unless you know what your doing your not a special little snowflake and if you dont know  what your doing you will be farmed hard  also pubs who think you can walk to a battle."
Planetside,3dm6w1,FuzzBuket,2,Fri Jul 17 13:12:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, probably has a lot to do with it. It's a shame the instant-gratification mindset encouraged by most recent shooters is so prevalent.

Planetside,3dm6w1,FuzzBuket,3,Fri Jul 17 13:20:33 2015 UTC,"*dark souls aint hard, its just a mix of pattern learning and utter BS     both games are about learning through observation: you can avoid a lot of the shit in Dark Souls by paying close attention to your surroundings, and you can avoid meat grinders in Planetside by watching the map and looking for unguarded paths. They also treat death as a temporary setback as respawns are free in both cases (aside from resetting boss fights etc), but while Dark Souls doesn't punish your deaths Planetside keeps dangling useless numbers like KD in front of players, which reinforces the notion that dying a lot = playing badly."

All 5 platoons need leaders, and there's also an FC involved. AFAIK, PS4 doesn't even have platoon or outfit support yet.

Planetside,3dlmt9,TheFullCologne,2,Fri Jul 17 07:50:17 2015 UTC,"Great idea, that way we can always be sure of it's range."
Planetside,3dlmt9,xdcAlzir,2,Fri Jul 17 09:55:25 2015 UTC,"For what purpose?  Do they have a special squad-only purpose? Do they give your squad extra information? Does it give you special points if it helps a squad member rather than a ""mere"" ally?  I just don't see how this change would make a difference for anyone. I guess it could allow a squad leader to see a squad colored dildar, and think ""oh wow that guy is contributing, good job"" and give him a pat him in the back. Sure, that's something that could happen."
Planetside,3dlmt9,obuw,2,Fri Jul 17 15:32:01 2015 UTC,"or you can be 100% sure of the range of that dildar without having to clutter comms asking if they've dropped one or not.    QoL, of course, but certainly a nice to have."
Planetside,3dlmt9,BCKrogoth,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:42:08 2015 UTC,"Ah I see, so you just want to know which one is the max rank dildar dropped by your squadmate, and which one is potentially a low rank dildar dropped by a scrub. Makes sense.  Would make more sense to have a different icon for each rank of dildar or some way to see their range, but I guess that's probably too much to ask."
Planetside,3dlmt9,obuw,2,Fri Jul 17 15:52:01 2015 UTC,"I almost think different icons would be ""lost in the mud"" tbh - it's so small on the minimap, any slight changes would be difficult to see."

Planetside,3dhwk9,Vraccas24,3,Thu Jul 16 18:07:59 2015 UTC,I have practice with both and use them interchangeably. Only difference is PPA can go farther out and requires more aim. The AH is great if you do a high speed low altitude swoop in and grab a quick kill.

Planetside,3dhwk9,hungry0212,4,Fri Jul 17 01:30:07 2015 UTC,"Now that were at it, is it logical to use a secondary weapon against Infantry or should i buy one for anti-vehicle/aircraft use? Do you have a list of upgrades that tells me when it's most logical to buy something?"
Planetside,3dhwk9,RobXIII,7,Thu Jul 16 19:46:42 2015 UTC,"Well, it's all a matter of personal preference really. For most people, flying is mostly about having fun than anything else. Some people have fun by killing lots of infantry or tanks. Some people have fun by engaging in air to air combat.  A jack of all trades but master of none loadout would be to get the default nosegun and get rocketpods. You'll be able to defend yourself in air engagements, and with the rocket pods, you can kill a fair amount of infantry or a few tanks.  I recommend that getting at least 1-2 levels into Nanite auto repair and Fire Suppression should be on top of your list, as these upgrades will highly increase your survivability no matter what type of flying you do."
Planetside,3dhwk9,Amarsir,3,Thu Jul 16 19:55:53 2015 UTC,"Alright, that seems like a good idea. Thanks."
Planetside,3dhwk9,boobers3,2,Thu Jul 16 20:05:02 2015 UTC,"I run with a nearly maxxed out AH with thermals, racer frame and fully certed afterburners.

Planetside,3dhwk9,TheRTiger,7,Thu Jul 16 17:48:49 2015 UTC,"Not really, it just takes awhile to get used to this game's flight controls. Try learning how to hover in place, then use hover (spacebar) to strafe side to side like OP does in this gif. Eventually try to fly backwards, using hover. Using the spacebar effectively is the most important skill needed to maneuver well in an ESF. I've also found that binding pitch up and pitch down to my mouse thumb buttons helps (I have a Logitech G402)."
Planetside,3dhwk9,_BurntToast_,3,Thu Jul 16 18:01:00 2015 UTC,"You ought to be able to maneuver and fly with only wads and mouse. I find what helped me a ton was assigning pitch down and pitch up to the side buttons of my mouse (five button type, so I pitch up with my ring finger and pitch down with my thumb or vice versa, can't remember) This enables you to keep your hand on the mouse and still pull rapid maneuvers. Also tune your sensitivities, generally all sensitivities in the game should end up lower that default. Also a great all around tip is make sure you have a lot of room to move your mouse around, at least the size of two oldschool mousepads, this is critical to being able to do fine maneuvers and aiming in addition to evasive actions/180 turns.  OH AND immediately rebind the 'exit vehicle' key under the air vehicle controls. I rebound mine to ~, so i have easy access to it but i'm never going to hit it accidentally."
Planetside,3dhwk9,TheRTiger,2,Thu Jul 16 20:40:49 2015 UTC,Make sure you bind manual throttle (I use 'E' ) as it isn't automatically bound.   I suggest 6 for vehicle exit. ~ is better for autorun.
Planetside,3dhwk9,clippist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:48:22 2015 UTC,Analog throttle isn't strictly necessary. I learned how to fly without it and I feel like I have much better control over my velocity when slowing down as a result.
Planetside,3dhwk9,TheRTiger,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:27:32 2015 UTC,I mostly fly Galaxies so the faster stopping speed is a huge advantage for tight drops where you can't just do a flyby.

Planetside,3dhwk9,StriKejk,3,Fri Jul 17 05:40:59 2015 UTC,Banshee isn't ridiculously overpowered anymore. It's thankfully lost some of the stupid mode farming potential still in the Airhammer and PPA.

Estimated kills with Banshee: 3-4, then you need to reload, due to the obnoxious loud sound and constant stream of bullets you would be noticed and dead before finishing your reload.

You'd probably have enough time to get 2 more clips off after that and get at least 5 kills with each.   The banshee isn't that bad. It's worse than the other options, yes, but far from useless."

Many people prefers Hover, but after getting used to it, i much prefer Racer, even for dogfights.  b) Nah, i use KB+M, and so does almost everyone. Joystick support is sadly not very well handled in this game.  Yeah, trees get even the best of us from time to time. My best advice if you wanna get into flying, is to start in the VR zone, and just fly around the terrain in the middle of the map, getting closer to the mountains and going faster and faster the more confident you get."
Planetside,3dhwk9,EclecticDreck,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:57:38 2015 UTC,"a) I see...  b) Really? Is there a way to set it up properly? Because I find turning to be an absolute PITA.

Planetside,3dhwk9,Alien51,4,Thu Jul 16 14:00:36 2015 UTC,"I recommend having a look at this video for tips on how to get better with KB+M.

Also, if you're used to joystick, i recommend inverting the pitch of your mouse (can be done in settings) - i helped me out a lot"
Planetside,3dhwk9,pragomatic,2,Thu Jul 16 14:14:50 2015 UTC,"That is incredibly helpful, that analog thrust thing and the spacebar tapping alone are going to be so worth it.  EDIT: does analog thrust do anything besides hover? seems weird that it would just do the one thing."
Planetside,3dhwk9,EclecticDreck,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:56:00 2015 UTC,"Well, the analog thrust is a bit of a weird one. I expect that it was left in game by mistake to be honest, as it has no default keybind, and serves no other purpose than to stop the aircraft. The only difference between it and just decelerating is that you only have to press it once, instead of holding down decelerate. And it slows you down ever so slightly faster."
Planetside,3dhwk9,k0bra3eak,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:15:59 2015 UTC,"My setup (at tad unorthodox):  Rebind pitch up and down to W and S. Accel / Decel to mouse thumb buttons. Analog throttle to C (you live and die by analog throttle). I have weapon selection bound to the scrollwheel for when not using AB. It's a bit annoying since I have my map zoom bound there as well, but it works best for me since using the number row keys is less easy when maneuvering with WS pitch (and I only have two thumb buttons on my mouse)."

Most all of the in-game VS equipment (bar formerly unique guns like the VX6-7) originally had simple, space-themed names (or paranormal-themed for the sniper rifles), but a few years back or so they all got alphanumeric designations tacked on so they'd seem more tacticool along with the Great Blackening."

As a Medic, I know to engage one but not the other; and in this case, I don't know which it is.  Otherwise, all I really need to be able to do is distinguish whether the gunfire is friendly or not, and it's easy enough to distinguish VS weapons from the other two factions."
Planetside,3dl5r8,CapitaFK,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:32:06 2015 UTC,"Planetside 2 could really benefit from some Battlefield-esque audio processing, something to make distant sounds seem far away, rather than just lower in volume, and to make close sounds seem way too close.   Also, more satisfying explosion sounds.  The NC's rockets are like fucking nerf guns."
Planetside,3dl5r8,ViceAdmiralVidya,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:28:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with the explosion sounds thing. Explosions in general just sound kind of lackluster, and it never sounds like there's a pressure wave being created - they lack any ""thump"".  As to the audio processing thing?

Can you give me the name of another modern online shooter where it's normal to take damage whole seconds after ducking behind cover? And finally, the title was not false.

Eliminate latency? When did I suggest that? No, PS2's implementation of multiplayer sync is very bad. When latency can be in the thousands of milliseconds despite having a great ping, a call for improvement is NOT a call to ""eliminate latency."" Yes, the fact that this is an MMO is undoubtedly the reason why things are the way they are. But the average player doesn't care. They only care about the experience. The person who linked to the population stats showed my point perfectly. I think that graph showed a 50% loss in a little over a year. That is easily considered 'catastrophic'. Especially since the total count is so low to begin with. When a game has hundreds of thousands of players, large losses are less of a surprise. But when there are only a few thousand remaining, these should be your core group of fans. To lose half of them in a single year is disastrous for any game, but especially for an online-only f2p mmo."

Maybe its unfixable. Maybe Planetside was doomed to this painful death from day one. But I do have a lot of game development experience, and I sincerely don't think fixing this is impossible.

Planetside,3dpurg,shaql,5,Sat Jul 18 22:03:00 2015 UTC,"I really do not think the sync issues are as bad as you make them seem.  The game just has a very diverse playerbase on most servers despite having regional servers.  Connery is full of people with 150-200 ms ping from Asia/Australia and Emerald and EU exchange players during primetimes on a regular basis.  Other FPS games tend to maintain their regional boundaries due to ping issues, but people are willing to deal with higher pings here due to the sheer number of players required to fill the terrain with action.  That said I definitely agree with you that the community is in denial.  The numbers on rebelscum do not lie, the game is shedding players faster than most other f2ps many with a much lesser pedigree (Warframe, War Thunder, Unturned etc), but this game is also very different from them so it is difficult to compare.  I do not think people ridicule on purpose so much though, it seems to be mostly blind love for the game and their blinders are on.    In addition I would agree the community is very toxic, I actually play League of Legends and Battlefield 4 when I want community and Planetside 2 when I want my favorite core game.  Anyone who plays games knows, when people are saying your game's community is worse than LoL, it's a rather toxic place.  I regularly see players tell new players to ""kill themselves"" or ""go play CS:GO nobody wants you here"" when they ask basic questions on public chat like what the difference between a heavy assault and a ight assault is."

Planetside,3dm3sw,BiotykNC,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:14:12 2015 UTC,Ad. 1. There is implant that let people know when they are spotted. But all of them will hear you and experienced infiltrator will find you very quickly. At least I love to hunt for enemy infiltrators. Safe distance? Maybe 50-60 meters? The sounds beginning to fade out.  Ad. 2. Sound is the same + sound of cloaking/decloaking. So also quite easy to look for experienced players.  On the other hand spotting is compromising your position and you give away your kill :)

This has been very successful in preventing a number of individuals from regularly disrupting gameplay on our servers through cheating, excessive teamkilling, etc.. A very small number of highly skilled players, on new accounts and in specific situations claim to have reached thresholds designed to alert us of abuse from new accounts. Our intention of course is not to catch legitimate players and we have set parameters we feel will accomplish this.  We want to ensure it’s understood that adjusting your play style to intentionally trip our system, although extremely difficult to do, will result in the inability to play on that account until a review has been made by the Customer Support team. Done on enough accounts there is a possibility you could lose access to your main account as well, so play such accounts at your own risk.  To be clear this only affects new accounts and the chances of reaching these parameters unintentionally without cheating is extremely low.  As always we appreciate everyone’s support for keeping PlanetSide 2 free of cheating and other malicious activity. If you notice such activity, please utilize our report system."

The VS1 just isn't a particularly good gun for a medic.  Fine for an auraxium but not worth using for anything serious.  Skorpios - HVA on an SMG is stupid.  The Eridani is already a weapon with substantial problems at anything approaching long range and HVA just doesn't do anything meaningful compared to SPA.  I personally ran the Eridani with a grip so that more or less compounded my issue with the gun.  Tempest - Same issue as the Skorpios except one thing.  Were it not for the fact that the cyclone exists, the Tempest would easily be one of the bets weapons in the game.  Basically its just a worse cyclone.

Planetside,3dkory,Noktaj,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:30:44 2015 UTC,"This.  They are all ""Auraxium and forget"" guns. Well some are not even worthy of an auraxium medal (eg. skorpios, eclipse, chaos).

Planetside,3dkory,MacroCode,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:00:20 2015 UTC,"So based on what I've been hearing, the auraxium weapons are basically the default weapons with a heat mechanic?"
Planetside,3dkory,EclecticDreck,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:44:49 2015 UTC,"Sort of.  The Darkstar is a VS1 with a compensator and a few other little niggling differences.  Heat and hipfire are the big differences between it and the default.  Betelgeuse is an orion without a grip and a heat mechanic.  You trade mid range potential for pocket reloads and unlimited reserve ammo.  Because it maintains enough range most of the time and heat resolves the two pressing issues with the Orion (constantly needing to reload, small reserve ammo supply) it is one of the few directive guns that's really worth using.  Assuming you like the orion of course.  Skorpios - This is an Eridani with HVA and extended mags.  More recoil, slightly higher velocity and irrelevant extension to falloff range.  HVA is literally useless on an SMG and so it is flatly inferior (and less flexible) to the Eridani.  Limited ammo.  I've never used the VS directive carbine.  It does have heat but I can't comment on how it stacks up to other options."
Planetside,3dkory,Noktaj,2,Fri Jul 17 14:47:57 2015 UTC,"It has a built-in laser sight and an UB shotgun.  Like the battlegoose-orion, you'll trade some long-range effectiveness which, in my opinion, goes against the purpose of having infinte ammo on LA.  As LA you'll want to find a nice spot and flank the enemy without having to get too close, relying on your infinite ammo capability.  Eclipse perform poorly from range negating you the only advantage you have in chosing it over, let's say Pulsar C, your to-go weapon of choice for long range fights.   Yes, you can stay in your position for a longer period of time without having to think about ammo, but you'll be less effective because the thing can't hit jack over 40m without you struggling to control your bursts."

It charges passively and maybe only charges when the weapon is out. When the capacitor is out of power it would have worse dmg most weapons in its class. Edit:I'm thinking it would work well with shotguns and battle rifles."
Planetside,3dkory,Nikye_VS,3,Fri Jul 17 06:36:46 2015 UTC,I think devs said once that its not that easy to give the TR the mechanic you are suggesting. It would need extra coding to make it happen. I would suggest to just make sure the spin up mechanic they are planing for the butcher works. Then also give it to the other TR directive weapons too. Of cause only if it makes sense. A sniperrifle with that mechanic does not make sense. For the NC i dont have a good idea.
Planetside,3dkory,TRSR_JANMID,4,Fri Jul 17 01:45:11 2015 UTC,"Is the difficult implementation because of how ammo packs work, in that they resupply reserve ammo and not the current clip?

Planetside,3dkory,LintGrazOr8,2,Fri Jul 17 01:58:27 2015 UTC,"Yep, in the moment its not possible to resupply ammo from an ammo pack directly to the current clip. Unfortunatly. Bypassing this by splitting the total amount of ammo into two large clips is a good idea and could be actually the solution for this. I mean for the butcher it does not make that much sense because the magsize is allready quite high but for the Trac-shot or T1A- Unityfor example a 100 round mag would be quite cool. Maybe a bit overkill but cool."

Planetside,3dkory,Divenity,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:22:37 2015 UTC,"Like that it would be easy to give the TR a belt fed mechanic. Just reduce reload to 0.08 seconds (750rpm), remove reload animation (to not let us twitch around) and add the straight pull bolt to the weapons so that we ar able to aim while we are reloading a.k.a. running through our ammo belt. You should really post the idea to the front page so that   the devs can find it easier and think about it again."
Planetside,3dkory,TRSR_JANMID,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:32:27 2015 UTC,"that is absurdly overcomplicated... A far more simple, and better design would be to simply put the full pool in your magazine, and your ""spare"" pool increases as you fire, so you can only hold as much spare ammo as you have missing from your current ""belt""... and then just give it an average reload.  This 1 shot mag stupid fast reload idea is abusable as hell, just sit a bunch of TR with directive weapons on a point with an ammo pack and unload on the doors without ever having to let off the trigger(bursting properly to maintain COF, obviously)... anyone who attempts to enter the room dies the moment their shoulder enters the line of fire, and the volume of fire never ceases, never allowing a good opportunity to breach."
Planetside,3dkory,FuzzBuket,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:12:28 2015 UTC,It might be overcomplicated but you wouldnt need to code anything new. Of cause its easy to abuse without restrictions but you only need to increase the cooldown timer of ammo packs for weapons with this mechanic. Like a normal gun gets one mag every three seconds but with belt fed mechanic it could be like 100 rounds every 30 seconds. You wouldnt be able to shoot without breaks like that. You could shoot like 40 seconds nonstop but then you would have a 20 seconds cooldown after every 10 seconds of shooting unless you are able to resupply on a terminal. And you could also decrease the max amount of ammo in reserve to make it even less abuseable (for example 1/300 instead of 1/400).

Planetside,3dkory,Syfoon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:23:04 2015 UTC,You start with 750 rpm like you would normaly do but after 0.4 seconds you get additional 30rpm.

Planetside,3dkory,TRSR_JANMID,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:10:33 2015 UTC,"Because it'll massively affect CoF and spread.  It'll reduce the effectiveness of players who burst fire religiously to get around the CoF and spread increases - they won't be able to put out the max DPS the weapon can provide without dealing with the uncounterable CoF and spread.  And you mentioned ~0.4s to spin up. That's around the TTK in CQB anyway, so it'd be pretty useless for 1v1s."
Planetside,3dkory,Nessevi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:35:33 2015 UTC,As long as you burst fire you will be not effected by the changes at all because bursts generaly dont last longer than 0.4 seconds. Within these 0.4 seconds your stats will exactly be the same as they are now. After it you start shooting at a firerate of 780rpm which of cause effects your accuracy but you wont use it in situations in which this could effect you anyways. Only cqc.

It wouldn't make any difference in 1v1's, but with clusters, you could line up one enemy behind another and wipe out multiple enemies with the same 2-3 bursts.  It fits with NC's ""high powered/hard hitting bullets"" theme, without causing balance concerns for smaller engagements. It also would require skill to line up your targets in order to maximize the weapon's potential.  (Plus, with the excessive numbers of idiots on NC, we really could use a leg up on killing potential when outpopped.)  And the icing on the cake:  They don't have to write any extra coding! They only have to remove sections of the collision coding for the specific directive weapons that they want the feature on!  Plus, such a removal is so simple that they don't need their best people on it. Practically anyone who can read code could do it in just a few minutes (certainly under a single hour, and that's accounting for sluggishness of someone coming in bleary eyed bright and early on a slow monday morning using one hand to finish their morning coffee and a donut.

Planetside,3dkory,_Hwaiting,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:57:56 2015 UTC,"I don't fully understand what you mean by ""maintaining the same bloom if there are fewer bullets in the magazine"". Could you elaborate on that?  Also, the higher damage thing really would be better and more understandable if it started out at higher damage (along with higher bloom to accompany it), dying down to the standard damage tier and bloom as the extra power source imparting additional energy into each round slowly lost it's charge.  (Say there's an extra battery in the magazines that allows additional energy to be imparted into the magnetic acceleration coils, and as that disposable power source depletes, the damage drops down to the standard weapon's damage.)  Both your idea and my alteration to it would be fairly difficult to balance around the original weapons though.  Adding extra damage would be difficult to keep from having a virtually useless effect (in the case of a gentle climb in damage between damage tiers), to being blatantly overpowered (increasing damage by tiers).  That said, here's an idea that would definately be of NC origin, and fairly well balanced:  There's a type of 12 gauge shotgun ""slug"" ammo for home defense that fires a rifled slug dead center, but also has three #00 (AKA, ""double Ought"") buckshot in with it.  So when you shoot it, the slug goes where you aim, and the shot ensures that if you miss by a little bit, you will still at least have a decent chance of grazing the target and potentially do significant to possibly even fatal damage.  It's called PDX1-12.  So this concept of a small amount of shot being added to an accurately centered projectile could easily be adapted to NC directive weapons.  A single projectile fires just like they do now, and a few shotgun pellets (with decent accuracy, so they actually serve a purpose) fly about around each shot to up the chances of hitting an enemy with little extra damage in close ranges to the inner fringes of mid range combat.  It wouldn't have to be much, but just having a few pellets to generate that hail of ""Oh shit!"" tracer rain that shotguns often benefit from and the threat of the enemy also being able to actually still do significant damage outside close quarters beyond that would certainly be a worthy trait.  Even just three pellets doing 15 @ 5m, 5 @ 42m per round would be enough to generate a solid advantage without being too powerful or too weak at any given range."

The amount of damage you do is enough to panic people into making a mistake a lot of the time so body shots are ok.  Remember it is a maximum of two bullets to kill so despite the low ammo count it can do a lot of damage with it.  The bullet velocity isn't an issue because you use at close ranges 90% of the time the centre of the crosshair will be on the head (there is 1 4x crosshair scope and one that is chevrons if you hate the chevrons make sure and read carefully when buying) also it is about the same velocity as the vandal you won't notice much of a difference.

EMP grenades are great, removes shields and drains the ability of all targets it hits (in line of sight they shields stay drained for a while depending on how close they are, if behind cover they start regening instantly), f.e. turning a heavy with NMG which has 1700 HP over all into a 500 HP easy kill. On top of that, the more useful part, is that it destroys all enemy deployables caught in its huge blast radius (even through cover, you can hit the ceiling and destroy stuff 2 floors above you), detonating C4, proximity mines and anti tank mines which can and will net you kills. it also overheats enemy turrets/disables enemy spitfires for a time. well worth the certs and a great tool to have  final note, id recommend using the motion spotter over the recon device. try to get it to rank 3, it will give you 3 radar stick thingies with 3min duration and 35m radius, showing enemy position and the direction they are facing in real time. super powerful tool, especially compared to the ping of the recon devices darts that only shows an enemies postion once every few seconds but nothing else"

The vast majority of the time I'm using the PDW. It's not quite as good at point plank as the MKV or ES SMG's, but has solid performance out past 20 meters up to about 40 meters. You can be very aggressive with it. The Full-Auto Scout reaches out farther, but is still decent up close. I prefer it if I'm assaulting a base from a spawn that requires some hiking to get on point. I usually pull out the Vandal if I know the area will be target rich and I'll have the high ground (like a tower defense or assaulting from a elevated spawn). I rarely use the low zoom bolt, and only to counter snipe. I prefer it so I don't have to deal with scope sway.  More specific to your post, I'd say you could check out the low zoom bolts, or one of the empire specific semi-auto scout rifles. One of the scouts hits harder than the other, but has fewer shots per magazine. That's probably the one you'll want to try, but I personally think the Vandal is just as good as either one."

It felt like the early fights for the crown on PC, and even if you are a jaded vet who has been playing for years, it might be worth a watch.  Medic runs over your corpse without stopping..... yup some things never change  P.s High velocity ammo is a trap!"
Planetside,3dld8v,pirate-cat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:29:04 2015 UTC,Medics forever running past me ha. Ive been playing Planetside since the ps4 beta so ive been enjoying it for a while now. One of my favorite games from PS3 was MAG which was pretty much the console version of Planetside at the time. So I was extra stoked when I found out  PS2 was coming to PS4. Why is HV ammo a trap? I havent really used it up until this video.
Planetside,3dld8v,k0bra3eak,3,Fri Jul 17 08:10:28 2015 UTC,"It only gives a reasonable benefit to 2 or 3 guns for each faction and 1 NS gun, so you're literally just giving yourself the downside of HVA most of the time and my lord you're using a Battle Rifle, you'd have better luck with the TMG-50.P.S when hitting the side of an engineer turret shield you do little to no damage."

Planetside,3dld8v,Zandoray,2,Fri Jul 17 11:49:38 2015 UTC,"Aah, the good old crown. Certainly brings back some memories, in good and bad :D  A few tips.   upgrade your suit and ability slots, I saw you had NMG rank one and nanoweave rank 2. Rank them up (or alternatively other suit slots) You are spamming shots with AMR-66 way too fast and not letting the cone of fire reset. See your shots going everywhere even when your target is in your sights? That is the cone of fire screwing you up. With battle rifles it is very important to pace your shots, let the cof reset to stay accurate. (And many will rightly argue that battle rifles are not particulary good guns and in reality you would be better with a LMG on heavy than a battle rifle). You have medical kit certed, remember to use it! Use your overshield when you are taking damage. I understand it might be a little hard to activate it while aiming down sights and moving, but if you are getting shot by someone, just pop the shield, disengage and take cover."
Planetside,3dld8v,k0bra3eak,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:25:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tips! I had actually just started using the battle rifle that day so im still getting used to it. I dont know, I really like it, had some nice sprees going on but ill def take off the HV ammo then. I usually play as a medic or engineer so I have a lot of my cert points invested into those classes."
Planetside,3dld8v,k0bra3eak,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:56:27 2015 UTC,"Crown?  Good thing you guys never saw old Crown though.  Damn the game is far slower paced, on PC it's more hectic just simply, because the pace is so much quicker.I'm also surprised by the lack of Sky Whale horns."

Planetside,3dld8v,k0bra3eak,3,Fri Jul 17 08:11:24 2015 UTC,"That was partially due to the love created in old Crown, all 3 capture points were on top of that hill and there wasn't a stone bridge to Ti, Alloys or an SCU and the fact that no lattice or continent lock meant you could constantly fight there."

That is not entirely true. There are some cosmetics for sundy, harasser etc. that carry over to other factions but the cool stuff is ES for no reason. (e.g. the Foxhound grill for the sundy is ES). For some there is some ES colour so that is kinda reasonable, others look exactly the same on all factions (at least for me) and still count as ES."
