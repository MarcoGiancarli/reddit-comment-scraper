Theatre,3dpju6,StarrHrdgr,3,Sat Jul 18 05:16:03 2015 UTC,"The industry's dirty little secret is that one of the biggest live-entertainment towns in America is Branson, Missouri.  I know, right?  The city's year-round population is only about 10,000, but those people support over 100,000 hotel rooms (for comparison, the Vegas strip only has about 60,000), which are full of guests visiting the local attractions. None of them are in any sense world-famous, and very few of them map onto the skills and experiences we teach in BFA programs, but these dinner theatres, rodeo shows, passion plays and interactive experiences employ more actors, technicians, writers, designers and stage managers than the whole entertainment industries of certain other states. Indeed, if you want to work as a dancer or singer or actor, your odds of earning a living wage are way better in Branson than they are in New York or Chicago.  Thing is, it sucks. It's pretty much Chuck-E-Cheese for a slightly older audience: same songs every night (and there are always songs), same movement track, same kooky hijinx, shows running for years without changes other than slotting in a Celebrity Visitor of the Month. (Most of whom are one-hit-wonder country singers performing their one hit.) Never anything even halfway-serious, never an audience open to being challenged, and most of the time the writers don't even want credit for the shit they have to churn out to fill a 90-minute slot. (But not a minute longer, because if we don't end the 6:00 show at precisely 7:30, we won't have time to turn the tables over before the 8:00 seating...)  I'm being a curmudgeon. There can still definitely be something fulfilling in performing at this level and for that type of crowd (applause! spectacle! autographs! children with twinkling eyes! free drinks!), but -- again -- it's not what we think of when we think of theatre, right? This isn't why we send people off to conservatories and make them read Mamet and Aristophanes and think Reel Deep Thots about acting methods.  Yet this is what you have to do if you want to become a theatre centre.  Insofar as people want ""serious"" theatre, they're already going to New York. (More open-minded theatregoers and -- most of all -- working artists who can afford to take vacations might swing by Chicago instead, but in general, when someone from ""flyover country"" decides to take a trip to see a show, they're thinking Broadway.) And I don't care how big Paducah or Grand Rapids or Anchorage gets as a theatre town: you will still be a tiny wee minnow sharing a pond with the Great White Whale.  The only niche which can support a local economy and theatrical ecosystem and generate real tourist dollars is the Branson-style good-clean-family-fun market, and it's a profitable niche. But is that really what you want your local scene to turn into?  (That's not a trick question: for all that I'm holding my nose, if I were a working actor -- or, more accurately, an actor trying to find work -- I might very well prefer a year-long $50k-a-year contract to play in the chorus line of a dinner theatre [""Miss Kitty's Two-Gun Saloon and Steakhouse""] over a two-week run of The Sisters Rosensweig in a crappy storefront on a profit-share model.)"
Theatre,3dpju6,adminbeast,2,Sat Jul 18 07:55:24 2015 UTC,"Unlike the the worlds biggest ball of yarn, or the biggest snowman on the equator, the theater is a destination rather than an attraction. People travel from all over to see good theater, and not just to New York and Chicago but to regional theaters as well. And they spend big bucks for the privilege. Then they try to plug their phones in on stage, but thats a discussion for another thread.  I don't really know what you mean by tourism dollars though. Do you mean where a state or cities tourism department helps underwrite the productions?   That may help theaters with the overhead and free up resources to put into productions but I don't think that alone is the key to getting people into the theater.  I was formerly of the mindset that if theaters were able to lower the cost of admission it would allow them to be more competitive with other forms of entertainment. After working in a theater that was largely attended by tourists and school groups I've learned that audiences that don't have an investment or interest in what they are seeing do not make good audience members. This leads to a bad audience experience, not just for the guy who realized the outlet on stage is fake, but for everyone in the house.   I don't know how many great productions I've been to that were thoroughly ruined by terrible audiences. Someone who is less attached to live theater than you or I takes bad experiences like this into account and may decide not to visit that theater or forgo live theater altogether because of it.  Its true though, that even the most successful theater companies are struggling with declining attendance and as a result lower box office revenues. This is due to a number of factors though and not just crappy audiences including the rising cost of travel, lodging and amenities.  That is where cities can help the most in terms of promoting tourism. Rather than the trip being an ordeal to be put up with in exchange for a few hours of quality theater, cities should focus on supporting the theater by helping in improving the experience of the overall visit.   By focusing on these things you'll build an audience base that actually wants to come back. Not only to watch a three hour Chekov play but to enjoy what the city has to offer as a whole. They will be more attentive audiences who are there to share an experience rather than thinking about how far of a walk it is back to their car or hotel.  TLDR; put the money into making the over all experience of visiting a city better. This will not only make the city's theaters a more appealing destination but will be boon to the cities infrastructure and supporting industries."

Theatre,3d7vhy,sweet26,2,Wed Jul 15 04:23:00 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend George F. Walker - a great Canadian playwright. Criminals in Love is my personal favourite but Love and Anger, Problem Child and Risk Everything are all really good. His plays are episodic and occasionally he has sequels (Risk Everything is a sequel to Problem Child) but all of his plays stand alone."
Theatre,3d7vhy,LonesomeCrowdedEast,2,Wed Jul 15 12:42:51 2015 UTC,"After you've read Waiting for Godot, I'd recommend you give some of Sarah Kane's plays a go. She's my favourite playwright, she writes as a sort of contemporary version of Beckett with incredibly depraved characters and situations but also a beautiful glimmer of humanity underneath all the shit. Her early stuff like Blasted has extreme violence and sexuality, until her later stuff like 4.48 Psychosis has a complete stripping away of characters, narrative, etc. She only wrote five plays, I think they're all well worth reading but I'd recommend starting with Blasted, it should more than satisfy your desire for edgy. My other recommendations would be Simon Stephens as somebody else recommended, Punk Rock and On the Shore of the Wide World are great, as well as Proof by David Auburn and Angels in America by Tony Kushner."
Theatre,3d7vhy,GRRRRaffe,2,Sat Jul 18 09:11:44 2015 UTC,I saw a production of 4.48 Psychosis in college. I had completely forgotten about it until I read that. I need to pick up a copy of that piece... So good.

Theatre,3d5oq4,adminbeast,2,Wed Jul 15 01:19:37 2015 UTC,"So long as the beverage isn't carbonated (carbonation = burps, coughing, inability to ""chug"", etc.) and the actors find it palatable, you've got nothing to worry about.  It also makes life easier if you serve diet soft drinks. (If you spill Coke on a costume, you're spilling sugar water all over it, with all the problems this implies: stickiness, insects, etc. If you spill a sugar-free drink, you're pretty much just spilling water and can safely wipe/rinse it off.) But lots of actors don't care for the taste of artificial sweeteners, so this can put you in a bind.  In all cases, to make a soft drink go flat, two easy options:   Open a can and leave it in the fridge for an hour or two. If you're in a hurry, open a can, pour into a glass, add a teaspoon of sugar, and stir. This will make it go flat lickety-split, but also defeats the purpose of serving diet soda, right?   In all cases, you can safely default back to tap water with food colouring. And if you want some carbonation (champagne looks fake if it doesn't have a little fizz), substitute seltzer for the tap water. (I suggest buying seltzer in plastic bottles, adding food colouring to the bottle, then putting the cap back on and shaking to mix. If you stir, you'll lose the carbonation.)"

Theatre,3d1njf,xthekid,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:33:41 2015 UTC,I was about just about to the second turn with my wrench and all of a sudden it just broke. It oh most hit me in the face.
Theatre,3d1njf,p1ccard,9,Wed Jul 15 18:46:26 2015 UTC,Fun fact: C-clamps aren't rated hardware.  Even more fun fact: Safety cables are really inadequate to resist the shock load of a leko falling a few inches.
Theatre,3d1njf,Kryzm,8,Mon Jul 13 02:44:33 2015 UTC,"I might be wrong, but I don't think that's true... Nicropress sleeves are supposedly 100%+ efficient in terms of SWL, and from what I gather, 1/8"" aircraft cable supports 400lbs safely.  Shock load is calculated by S=((WxDf)/Ds)+W where S is shock load, W is weight, Df is fall distance and Ds is Stopping Distance. Also I'm drunk and have no idea how to calculate that. This diagram in my rigging handbook looks pretty convincing. Physics will save me."
Theatre,3d1njf,p1ccard,2,Mon Jul 13 04:01:55 2015 UTC,"That absolutely is the calculations for shock load - so lets say, for instance, a 17lb leko falls 6"" and then has a hard stop (hard stop represented by .1""). That becomes:  S=((17x6)/.1)+17 S=((102/.1)+17 S=1020+17 S=1037   Which is 600lbs over the WLL of a 1/8"" aircraft cable. If you run it reverse and have S = 400lb and solve for Df, you get a maximum allowable fall distance of 2.25"""
Theatre,3d1njf,Kryzm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:38:52 2015 UTC,"That is assuming the stopping distance is .1. Like, I don't even know what units that equation wants. If you change it to .2 you are almost in workable range. Just saying you can't rough something like that out. Do you know the elasticity of aircraft? I definitely don't."
Theatre,3d1njf,p1ccard,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:21:16 2015 UTC,"Little bit of google-fu gives me a 1/4% to 3/4% stretch, depending on load. 18"" GAC + .0075 stretch = stopping distance of .135"". And that's assuming a heavy load on the cable, of which a 17lb leko is not."
Theatre,3d1njf,Jakakan5,3,Tue Jul 14 02:04:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've never really doubted that a safety cable is strong enough to catch any falling light.    Nicopress are 100% the strength of the cable, and I was pretty sure most 1/8"" is more like 1500lb break test."
Theatre,3d1njf,p1ccard,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:01:08 2015 UTC,"Break strength does not equal working load limit. You have to factor in the 5:1 safety factor. 1/8"" GAC is rated for 400lb WLL usually.  Also - the spring clips we use on safety cables are not locking, which is a huge no-no in most rigging situations."
Theatre,3d1njf,timokay,8,Mon Jul 13 11:41:27 2015 UTC,I can see that happening pretty easily if someone is really turning that pipe bolt (especially with cheap clamps).

Write a nice e-mail (with correct spelling and punctuation) and let them know that you're interested in learning more about theatre with the hopes of perhaps acting in the future.  Ask if they have anything that you could help out with.  Also, don't discount high school!  There are lots of things you can do there too!  A/V crew, tech crew, drama club, oftentimes schools will have a morning news show, get involved with that, etc.  Also... READ.

As far as theory books go, most theatre courses start with The Actor Prepares by Stanislavski.

She Stoops to Conquer (Goldsmith), The Rivals (Sheridan) both offer false identities and stage combat, as well as incredibly foolish old dames.  Feydeau is hilarious - french farce, lots of doors and running, but I'm not sure how rights work with translations.

It is a strange world unlike anything most people have ever heard of. Required spaces are, green room (basically a gathering room for preshow prep, not a dressing room) at least 4 dressing rooms, 2-3 offices and a storage area hopefully just behind the stage at least 2/3 of the area if the stage. Next extra storage is never a bad thing to have. If you are more than a road house you will need some some space for set construction (could be the storage area off stage)."

Playwrights live in dreamland, TD's and money people live in the real world.   The cost of installing a sound system, lighting system, and scene shop may negate costs of rental depending on your location. If you decide to turn it into a concert venue, you will want to look at noise-proofing between the apartments above and the theater below. You will want to use those offices as dressing rooms or tour offices if you want to bring acts through, as a place with no dressing rooms is not a very good place at all in my mind. Look at your fire code stuff and see what it would take to bring your theater to code, as well as ADA requirements that are stuck to any building after a large renovation. A theater is a huge money pit if you don't manage it right...like a massive huge money pit that eats all your money."

Noise issues are at the forefront of my mind, soundproofing practicality is a major factor of the make or break for this idea. If that fails then I will pursue other ideas for the space.

Theatre,3cyeb7,CapitanJack,2,Sat Jul 11 23:35:44 2015 UTC,"Unless your scene shop is offsite, you'll need a space able to inhabit possible materials and constructed pieces. Other than that, dressing rooms and a lobby area are essential, as well as a booth and possible backstage areas."

Edit: Forgot to mention there is an existing tech booth"
Theatre,3cyeb7,jupiterkansas,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:18:47 2015 UTC,"If the storage rooms are adjacent to one another, consider removing the wall between them just to create a larger space. A couple of the offices could be used as dressing rooms. I'm assuming here that the theatre is more like a black box, which means small spaces are needed. A men and women dressing room with maybe a storage office for props and things, you could be able to utilize the rest of the space as you go."

Theatre,3cyeb7,a_leprechaun,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:43:30 2015 UTC,"If you want to renovate the building, it would be a good idea to consult a theater professional. A few thoughts:  It sounds like you're thinking about changing rooms and maybe a green room already, which is good. A professional can help you decide if you need to update/replace/install any systems- electrics, rigging, sound, fire, etc. - and how much space those might need. You'll need a tech booth, of course. You'll almost certainly need some amount of storage space- how much depends on how much equipment you will have. Will you maintain a lighting inventory? Sound equipment? Soft goods? From your description, it doesn't sound like you'll be storing any costumes, props, or set pieces. Will set pieces be built in-house or brought in? Both? If built on-site, you'll need shop space. Either way, you'll need to make sure there is a way to load-in sets and other equipment from trucks, especially if you hope to book any touring acts.   This doesn't completely answer your question, but hopefully it helps your thinking. Don't forget about noise- residents won't want to hear a concert or play going on next door, nor will an audience want to hear someone flushing their toilet during a poignant moment. My best advice is to work with an architect/designer with experience in theaters."
Theatre,3cyeb7,a_leprechaun,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:23:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I will take heed yours and all comments here.   Those points on noise are in the front of my mind already.

She is JUST as responsible for ruining the magic with her breaking of character in order to prove a point about her elitist views of theater. Yes, phones are bothering, but this is why you inform an usher to take care of the situation quietly with class. That would interrupt the product only for a moment for a few people around the man  not an entire theatre of people who now have been sucked out of the world that they are creating. She is amazingly talented, but her talent is getting to her head and has made her a diva. Maybe it really is time for her to take a break, be self-reflecting, and decide if theatre is really what's good for her right now."
Theatre,3cp9fh,inceptor123,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:18:49 2015 UTC,"I believe she stayed in character the whole time. She just took less than a minute to yank the phone from someone that had been texting throughout the whole show and brought it to an attendant in the hallway, while doing her performance.  Also, as this a two person show, there is a good chance she was going to be on stage for a while. It's not like she is going behind the curtain every few minutes here. Are you familiar with this theater? It's tiny and the lady was sitting right next to the hallway so patti only had to walk 10 or so feet. not even off of a stage as there is no elevated stage in this theater. In fact, I believe that she would have had to walk down the same hallway right past the woman to get an attendant anyhow.  I would much rather ushers confiscate phones but that will never happen."

A theater is not your living room."

I wouldn't mind being surrounded by raucous and out of control people at a show, than by a bunch of people just sitting still in their seats and silently watching and paying attention to the action on stage.

Theatre,3cp9fh,Jakakan5,15,Thu Jul 9 21:41:58 2015 UTC,"While you may think so, and I wouldn't even disagree with you about a lot of it, that has nothing to do with this issue.      If that's how you feel about a theatre then don't go, or I'd rather an audience member get up bored in the middle of the show and leave than be on their phone.         If I'm at a movie that I think sucks I'm still not just going to pull out my phone and text, purely as a consideration for other audience members.  With live performers as well it's just even more fucking rude."
Theatre,3cp9fh,BoogieDownBX,7,Thu Jul 9 22:01:14 2015 UTC,This.  It's completely reasonable to excuse oneself to go to text in the hallway. Then one can spend as much time as they like texting.

There's so much I could say about this piece simply from watching the video (I've never seen it, sadly). Foreman, who wrote the libretto, directed, and designed the opera, is a master of blocking, in my opinion.   He has a wonderful book of essays and manifestos that I think anyone interested in theatre should read. His imagery and words are not inherently ""random"", although he does embrace a sense of improvisation in his writing and rehearsal methods.  He's also a smart mother fucker. He is extremely well read on psychology and philosophy, and incorporates a lot of these elements into his plays — although he makes a strong effort not to be pretentious, and ensure that audiences have a ""good night at the theatre"".  edit: Michael Gordon is the composer."

I find it odd that so many people in theatre have such a tremendously low opinion of the people who buy tickets.  Yes, audiences can be stupid, but this action goes against the grain of what we generally know to be true about the intelligence of our audiences. They ain't that dumb.  I see both sides. I truly believe this was a brillant publicity stunt. And very effective it has been.  I've had people tell me about this show who don't have an interest in theatre, because of this incident."

Do you look down on them because they tried to create an novel entertainment that could reach a very broad audience?   Low art is more popular than high art and it always has been. While you or I might see Spider-man as an absolute dog and pony show, the fact remains that it is a property that a larger share of ticket buyers want to see."
Theatre,3cjne3,WhiskersMcMitten,2,Thu Jul 9 19:35:47 2015 UTC,"Reaching a broad audience and being quality material are not mutually exclusive.   Even so, while the show was more of a fascinating side show, it certainly wasn't the biggest money maker in the long term. It simply relied on a gimmick, a number of gimmicks in fact. When you compare it to something like Book of Mormon, a smart, entertaining show which has great quality, it's ridiculous to say you need to do something like Spiderman."

We are not the gatekeepers of art, nor do we determine what constitutes quality art, thank Jebus.  That's the job of the audience.  And to circle back around to my point, let's not act like we are smarter than the audience. That's the business model that regional theatres have been chasing and look how well it's working out for them.  Maybe if we harbor such contempt for our audiences, it might be time to move into another field."

Theatre,3c6b9d,Ppooffoonn,5,Mon Jul 6 06:22:10 2015 UTC,If this is something that you want to take seriously then I would highly recommend learning how to read music. It makes the learning process go faster and people are more likely to take you seriously. I don't know what your plans for theatre are but if this is something that you really want to do and do well taking the time to learn music will do nothing but help you. Trying to do a musical with out knowing how to read music is like doing a play and not knowing how to read. You can do it but it will make it way harder.
Theatre,3c6b9d,Trifax,3,Sun Jul 5 17:01:13 2015 UTC,"Most people have taken at least a few basic piano classes, and piano lessons alone can prepare you with a basic understanding of theory and the workings of musical scales. All that good stuff.  Knowing basic theory, range, etc... is pretty important, and will be expected. More than whether or not they'll be okay with it, YOU will feel better about the process and be more productive/better at your craft if you understand these things."
Theatre,3c6b9d,NicitaGreeneye,5,Sun Jul 5 23:39:54 2015 UTC,"I think it will matter, as someone who understands the musical jargon will be easier to rehearse with and quicker to understand stage directions.  That said, it is nothing you can't easily fix. Just get a few lessons with a qualified singing teacher (he or she will also be able to tell you your range), buy a book about the history of opera and musical (I had one as a child and the most common musical terms are usually explained in there) and learn to read notes- it is a very useful skill anyhow.  If you invest a little time, it will be really worth it."
Theatre,3c6b9d,TPHRyan,2,Sun Jul 5 08:26:35 2015 UTC,"You can literally spend an hour or two just to learn the notes of a scale. This can be used to find your range (some nuance / common sense might be needed to work out things like which octave it is, but as long as you know what notes they are most people will be able to tell what you mean)  If you want, you can also learn how to read bass and treble clef. This will always be useful for learning notes etc, and it's not too hard. I'm sure there's resources available online.  As far as bass vs tenor or whatever other vocal part (I am assuming you're male because tenor is the part you mentioned?), I grew up in a musical family and I have a hard time distinguishing which is which. It's more complicated than you might think, but usually people just want to know your range. If you find your range is like B2 - F4 or something similar, say you're a tenor, but if it's more like G2 - D4 then say you're a baritone / bass. As long as you're honest about how little you know, and know you have a comparatively high/low voice, you're fine.  EDIT: I probably should have mentioned that this can all be fast-tracked by getting a couple of singing lessons. Side-effect: You will be able to sing better"

A few lords join her, and they leave. -Rosalind breaks out of the crowd, and the goons stop her. Everyone leaves except the three De Boys brothers and Adam. -Jacques de Boys, in school uniform, is led away by Oliver. -Orlando tries to hug Jacques goodbye, but Oliver won't let him.

You're a person in a space living and breathing and existing and saying things. Once you begin playing that, your body will take care of itself.  You are under-experienced. It's okay. You're a young student. You're here to learn. It's important now that you stop comparing yourself to others and just focus on what you're doing and what you're learning.

Don't face a screen toward the stage.  It also can screw things.   Don't wear headphones over or in both ears, someone will call for you.   Whatever you are doing at least 60% of your attention needs to be on the show because things happen all the time and you don't want to miss them.   Other than that go ahead, I've done this a long time...Used to read a book while board op, now if I have to op (I'm the boss now so I never have to) I'm reading my phone."

Theatre,3bgi0r,katoninetales,7,Mon Jun 29 11:44:12 2015 UTC,"Director and Stage Manager here: As long as you know your lines, and don't miss your cues/entrances it's pretty much fine. Nothing that makes noise obviously, and nothing  that can't be put down immediately - also watch for the amount of light your generating if the theater is dark.   During tech and such I'd keep phones in dressing rooms, definitely not backstage. If you have enough downtime to hang out in the green room/ dressing room, using a phone is fine.   Echoing others in the thread though, if I see someone always on their phone and then they call for line (a bunch, once can happen to anyone) I'll judge them for not using their time wisely."

As some others said, if your phone can be seen as the cause of you screwing something up, anything, even once, that will make you look really bad.  That said, most people use phones most of the time these days, and if there isn't an expectation your time is being utilized elsewhere somehow, I think you're fine.  If you are actually getting paid for your time (and I mean paid, not just some stipend), might worthwhile looking into what the expectations are like any other workplace."
Theatre,3bgi0r,delventhalz,5,Mon Jun 29 03:21:39 2015 UTC,"It's mostly seen as a distraction depending on the level of the production.

Theatre,3bgi0r,16note,4,Mon Jun 29 00:57:12 2015 UTC,"I'm of two minds about this. Me, personally, as an actor, I would never. I want to have my attention dedicated to the show. I want to see the flow of the story, the build of the characters, and the usage of the set, because if, God forbid, something goes wrong during a performance, I want to be able to help course correct in a way that keeps the show on track. If we're at a point where the actors are removed from the house, at the very least I'm going to socialize with my castmates rather than playing online or texting others. You practice what you perform, so if I'm only in character while I'm on stage I've already let down the show.  On the other hand, as a director, I wouldn't berate or forbid phone usage, so long as the performer has their shit tight. I would reiterate the speeches about being part of the show and about avoiding the hubris of ""good enough"" mentality, that there's always something to improve, but I'm going to give those speeches a couple times during the rehearsal run anyway   What it comes down to is what kind of person do you want the others to think of you as: the kind who tunes out the second they're offstage or the kind who is prescient and attentive for the whole production?"

Theatre,3bgi0r,Mdb8900,4,Mon Jun 29 14:31:38 2015 UTC,"It is considered rude and unprofessional.    If you are not onstage, and you don't have an upcoming entrance, you should be either paying attention to what's happening onstage, or working on something else related to the show, like memorizing lines, blocking, dance steps, etc.    If, for example, you are seen backstage on your phone from time to time and you end up calling for lines after everyone else is off book, people will know about your inability to focus and honor your commitment to the production, and you won't have to worry about being cast in future shows.  You should probably ask yourself, How committed to the show are you?  This counts for both paid and volunteer work in theatre."
Theatre,3bgi0r,Thedoc9,16,Mon Jun 29 01:22:05 2015 UTC,"From my experience working on Broadway, this is simply not true. It depends largely on context. There are many situations in which it would completely fine to be on your phone or laptop. There are also many situations in which you're supposed to be paying attention and being on your phone would indeed seem rude.  It completely depends on context. I can say with 100% certainty and with photos to back it up, that plenty of Broadway professionals are on their phones during down time.  I'm not saying that there aren't better ways to spend your time than on your phone, but I am saying that status quo definitely indicates that people are using their phones."
Theatre,3bgi0r,idledebonair,7,Mon Jun 29 03:43:50 2015 UTC,"I was going to type essentially the exact same first sentence. Professionally, if it doesn't affect your work or the work of anyone else, your time is your own.

Theatre,3bgi0r,scarybari,7,Mon Jun 29 05:04:35 2015 UTC,"In my experience, this is only true in volunteer/community theatre, and in education. In the 13 shows I've done in NYC, that was never the protocol. Take care of your shit, and as long as your shit is taken care of and you're not messing up, I've never seen anyone care otherwise. I've seen union actors playing games on their cell phones and even DS consoles and such.   I did tech and design work, and I took my Nook to every show. Nobody ever cared, including directors and SMs."
Theatre,3bgi0r,theamazingronathon,-2,Mon Jun 29 09:45:42 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about the feelings of several of my directors from volunteer and equity theatres.

Theatre,3bgi0r,Thedoc9,3,Wed Jul 1 00:03:57 2015 UTC,"I've worked off and off-off Broadway, and never saw a no cell phones policy. And like I said, equity actors were using cell phones and tablets all the time. I can only give my experience, but that's it."
Theatre,3bgi0r,theamazingronathon,3,Wed Jul 1 01:15:43 2015 UTC,"I think you're just fetishizing your idea of what theatre and art is ""supposed to be."" I think that you're idealizing things that are simply much more practical than you think they are. Theatre is art, but it's also a job, a real job where real people work. Real people who have lives and emails to attend to and people who get bored during the many hours you might be in rehearsal. If you're the lead in a show, then no, you don't spend a lot of time on your phone, you don't have time to do that. If you're in a tight-knit ensemble cast where everyone's energy is important in the room, then no, you don't have time to be on your phone. But if you're in a big cast or a giant musical and you have hours of down time, then it's fine to be on your devices.   Also, many theatres are big buildings. A director can't know what every cast member is doing at all times, their attention is on the stage. I'm far more dismayed that there are directors that are even concerning themselves with what the rest of the company is doing during their downtime. They have more important work to be doing in the room, on the stage. If cell phone use causes a problem, then put a stop to it, no problem. It's also fine if a director wants to announce, ""this rehearsal process is going to take a lot of focus, so I'm going to ask you to not be on your phones and things while in the room."" There is nothing wrong with that, but your blanket statement ""it is considered rude and unprofessional"" is just not true. Acting rudely on your phone by missing your entrances or causing a distraction is rude and unprofessional, not the act of being on your phone altogether.  I think theatre gets this undeserved reputation that it is incredibly strict and uncompromising. There are lots of things that people say about professional theatre that just aren't actually true. I'll give you another example. Being late. Yes, being consistently late is extremely bad. But being late one time doesn't get you fired. Accidents happen, people are late. No one is getting screamed at unless it happens over and over, kind of like a regular job."

Hopefully, if you stay interested in theatre, this post will put some interesting stuff on your radar for later. Plus, any of the plays or playwrights I mention are well worth reading just for awesomeness.    My suggestion is: Try to see plays and production styles in the context of history. Take a theatre history course or at least when you read a play read a bit about the time in which it was written, so you understand the pressures on the artists and the audience.   The more an actor knows about history the better informed their roles will be. And the more a theatre-goer knows about this stuff the more they will understand the strength (or lameness) of any given production.  If you know a bit about   what Shakespeare and Marlowe had in common and what was different about them,   What is the relationship of theater performance to religious ritual going all the way from the Dionysian and Apollonian rites of the ancient Greeks -- to the medieval mystery plays -- to the megachurches, tent revivals, gospel plays, Christmas Nativity plays and Hell Houses of today,  who Aristophanes was and why are we still doing his plays,   what the deal was with the English Restoration and why there was a boom in bawdy sex comedies at that time! --  Why Strindberg was a big deal and why were his plays so weird and tortured,   who Hedda Gabler was and why her play gets done over and over each generation with certain adjustments,   That ""The Crucible"" was set in colonial America but written in the 20th Century -- so in the context of political grandstanders hunting down and exiling ""Communists"" in the theatre and movie industry during the 1950s, why was that play such a lightning rod for audiences and so viscerally, desperately important to performers --  What is the difference between the Theatre of Cruelty and the Theatre de Complicite,  Why Brecht didn't use much scenery or set-dressing, why he never wanted you to experience ""immersion"" in his plays and why did he write plays about British gangsters to illuminate 1920s German politics, and why do we still give a darn,  Who Peter Brook was and why he and his actors at times used almost NO props or costumes or scenery, but his productions of Shakespeare are considered some of the best ever,  Why Chekhov (my personal hero btw, the guy was a legit baller) insisted his gloomy housebound family ensemble plays were meant to be comedies,  Can Medea,) written 400 years BC, have any relationship to Mother Courage and her Children, written in 1939?  What the fuck is Mamet's -- I mean, what is his goddamn, you know, problem? Can't his fucking characters just -- you know -- if they could just finish a sentence. Jesus.  And speaking of Mamet, What is the relationship of Tennessee Williams, Elia Kazan and Marlon Brando to the early years of Hollywood and why did styles of performance and playwriting change so much after a camera started to replace a proscenium stage,  And here's a great one, Why Hamlet is to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead as Romeo and Juliet is to Shakespeare in Love,  You will be a more successful, interested actor or audience member.

Other good reads are ""Waiting for Godot"" by Samuel Becket (Or any play he did) ""Caucasian Chalk Circle"" (and any play) by Bertoltd Brecht, ""The Seagull"" by Anton Chekhov, and if you're feeling adventerous, try some eastern theatre, like ""The Orphan of Zhao"".  Brecht, Godot and Chekhov are all the most famous writers of their own styles of theatre; Epic/political, Absurdism and Naturalism respectively. Honestly, there's no real ""Best play"" to read, just read any damn play you can find!"
Theatre,3b5zpr,smapplejacs,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:58:57 2015 UTC,"Private Lives by Noel Coward is a fun read, as is anything by Chekhov as long as you read his work under a lens of dark comedy as opposed to melodrama. There's some debate as to how to interpret his statement that his plays are comedies (some people take that quote very seriously, some people talk about translation issues), but I think it's universally agreeable that as melodrama, to an American audience, his work is pretty flat and boring. Much better when viewed as comedic social commentary, and very current given the atmosphere of the struggling middle class in the United States today.   Mamet and Shepard are amazing if you're looking for modern American playwriting. Notable works include Speed the Plow and Glengarry Glen Ross for Mamet, and Buried Child and True West for Shepard.   If you want some weirdness, the ""classic"" absurdists include Ionesco, Adamov, Beckett, and Genet. But if you want some really messed up shit, I recommend Sarah Kane, particularly Cleansed.   Finally, if you're looking for some very current playwrights with really awesome themes and witty-as-hell dialogue, I suggest Neil LaBute (Reasons to Be Pretty and Fat Pig) and Stephen Adley Gurgis (Jesus Hopped the A Train and The Last Days of Judas Iscariot)   Edit: Geez, reading over other comments, I've realized there's so many I left out. Williams, Wilde, Miller, Sarte, O'Neil, Parks... The world is your theatre oyster."

Poor schmuck just wants his rent from his lazy friends. And its not like they don't have a choice. Mark has his parents he could live with, and Roger obviously can do fine on his own since he moves to California and then back again in the course of the show. So it seems that the real reason they don't pay rent isn't because they can't but because they don't want to, which just makes them seem like entitle brats."

Theatre,3b15ji,Mdb8900,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:52:10 2015 UTC,"It had a workshop at NYTW in '94. That gave Larson more than a year to do rewrites. For the off-Broadway production (also NYTW) in '96, he died after the last preview. Meaning he died on the last day he or the director (Michael Greif) could make significant cuts. Because of Equity rules, once a show opens, significant changes are hard to make. So Larson was probably 95% finished ""fine-tuning,"" though he could have made cuts/additions once they went into rehearsals for the Broadway run three months later."

Theatre,3b15ji,King-Slime,8,Thu Jun 25 20:40:05 2015 UTC,"While the opening song does talk about the paying of rent, the title fits more of the definition of the word meaning torn and broken, whether physically torn, or emotionally torn.  The line ""cause everything is rent"" illustrates this.  Their lives and relationships are torn due to breaking up, disease, death, etc.  Mark and Maureen have broken up, Roger's girlfriend committed suicide and he has AIDS, Collins was fired from his job and has AIDS. All of these things have torn their worlds apart, and the show is about how they try to put things back together.  Mark trying to do his film, Roger trying to write his song and get over his ""baggage"" and have a life with someone else (Mimi), Collins falls in love with Angel only to lose her to the same disease he has.  By then end though, they (somewhat) are able to piece things together, with Mark realizing he doesn't want to become a corporate shill and stay an artist true to himself, Roger finally writes his song and realizes that the love he has for Mimi is more important than worrying about the baggage he has been carrying, and Collins comes to grips with the loss of Angel by (granted, illegally) hacking the ATM to give free money to those that need it as an honorarium to Angel and her positive, upbeat, help the world regardless of what bad stuff is going on in my life attitude.  Is it a bit dated, yes, but mainly because AIDS isn't the death sentence it was 1995 when the show was written.  The themes however still resonate with many people, young and old, and for that reason it will be a popular show for many more years to come."

Your article is engaging when it's snarky and insulting, but more interesting and more approachable when you get serious later on.   A story about a bunch of narcissistic people living hedonistically until they die.    It's natural that as you get older, you're going to agree more with the establishment/mainstream view of the bohemian society.  Why can't they just get over themselves, get a haircut, get a real job, pay their taxes?  From the kids' perspective though:  they're trying to change the world and make great art.  Are they very good at it?  Probably not, in this case, but surely it's an intentional sendup (c'mon, ""Moo with me people""?  How is that supposed to be anything but a satire of performance art?)  But I think their ultimate success is not the point-- they're trying.  And if they had been really good-- if Mark's film was amazing and Roger was Jeff Buckley, would that change your view of either the musical or their lifestyle?   You wanna know what it was never about? A bunch of middle-class teenagers in the 21st century who are sad sometimes.   Mark's a middle-class kid from Westchester; he fits the bill pretty well.  I think your view of the musical, and the views of a lot of commenters here, is being shaped by your distaste for current trustafarian fashions.  It's easy to forget how utterly revolutionary both the content and the style of this show were, in the mid-nineties.  And how much the society has changed, in terms of acceptance of LGBT people and non-mainstream identities and stories in general.  Watching that show, I thought-- maybe we'll be able to do this in high schools, without getting fired, in like 20 years.  It got there-- we got there-- in more like 10 years, maybe less.

A cross-dresser who murders dogs. A bad performance artist who's really slutty. And then there's the normal guy. And they're all singing about how they won't pay rent because the owner, who's their old friend, just wants to clean up the neighborhood and raise property values... There's even a point where he tells them, that if they agree to stop the protest, and let him fix up the area, then he'd let them live there FOR FREE. But they, for some ungodly reason, hate the idea of a nice block to live on... That about sums it up, yeah?

Leads do carry more of the show, yes, but they also get more notes from the director, and their job is to get you to where they want the show to be. If you're not doing something right, they will tell you; the ensemble can sometimes get a pass on that front because there are bigger things to worry about and ""they're only ensemble"" (I don't really agree with that for what it's worth), but leads will get much more specific treatment.  Also, if the director cast you, then they obviously think you were the most suited out of all the auditionees. You might be nervous, but they saw something in you that made them want to put you up there.  The biggest thing is to ask for help and clarification on direction if you need it."

Or are you going straight from tech to lead role?  It's phenomenal that you gained the courage to do this and hopefully it'll pay off for you.  My advice is to not worry about it. Practice makes perfect. If you memorize your lines quickly it will only make practice easier. Also seek advice from any veteran actors and the directors. What makes an actor great is when they set aside their arrogance and listen to what other people have to say. Soak it all in. Don't worry about stepping on stage. Practice as if your'e doing a show and doing a show will be as easy as practice. I can tell you all this but it's most important to make it your own and have a ton of fun!

The earlier you are solid in these things will allow you to 1) be more confident in your performance 2) experiment in rehearsals 3) give the director the ability to ask you to do things and try things 4) push other performers to be off book early, too.    Having directed and performed in community, college, and professional theatre, I can't overstate how important this one thing is.  Most community theatre performers tend to be slack in this area, at least as compared to professionals, but you don't have to be.

They can be a great way to get more comfortable with performing.  The main thing for Fester is to have fun. Seriously. He's so dementedly gleeful. And he's not naturalistic.

Theatre,3ark7t,adminbeast,2,Tue Jun 23 04:12:00 2015 UTC,"And theatre, as an industry, talks a big game about that: casting the right person for the role, considering anyone and everyone, taking a race-blind approach, etc.  So how about you give me a call when they hire a black man to play Stanley in Streetcar, barring an all-black production?"
Theatre,3ark7t,TPHRyan,2,Tue Jun 23 05:03:03 2015 UTC,"So how about you give me a call when they hire a black man to play Stanley in Streetcar, barring an all-black production?   I'm confused as to why you bring that up. I'm not familiar with the show, but if there's nothing in the script as to Stanley's race, then a black man can definitely play him if he's the better actor. (Even if the script did say something he could, particularly if there's a shortage of decent actors that fit the profile)"
Theatre,3ark7t,TPHRyan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:17:16 2015 UTC,"But please, let's pretend like there is no racism in our society and we need to start giving white actors a ""fair shot"" at ""black roles"".   I understand your plight and I really do not want to come across like I want anything but this situation to not be a thing.  It's just the same as my stance on feminism and similar issues, though. I believe that in order for an idea to work you need to not lose sight of the idea at its core, irrespective of current circumstances. This means instead of saying subjective things (such as ""women get paid 75% of men, that's not cool"") the situation should be looked at objectively (""should women get paid fairly for the work they do? Yes!"" ""should men get paid fairly for the work they do? Yes!""). This removes the ""them vs us"" mentality and enables us to get shit done on a case-by-case basis, IMO.  Phrasing it like that, my stance is ""people should be able to play any role that they can convincingly play"". I feel that it's kinda the point of acting, and to say otherwise will unfairly penalise people arbitrarily for whatever properties of themselves that they can't change, as I'm sure you can identify with yourself from what you've told me.   So, what I'm saying is, if ""people getting the opportunity to play who they want"", the objective statement, works for black people (I honestly would rather just not call people anything other than what they are but we need a generalisation here), then it needs to be applied to everyone across the board to be effective."
Theatre,3ark7t,xenoxero,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:43:29 2015 UTC,"...you need to not lose sight of the idea at its core, irrespective of current circumstances.   But my point is precisely that there ARE circumstances-- which aren't just current, but actually over 100 years old and built into the fabric of American society-- which make it impossible at THIS point in time to flip a switch and start treating EVERYONE equally and fairly. You can pretend as if treating white actors ""fairly"" moves us in the right direction. But as a system, theaters (especially theaters with large WHITE subscriber bases) will not simply collectively erase-- over night-- their prejudice (intentional or unintentional under the guise of ""Creative freedom"") towards black actors. You can't discuss this topic without also accepting that as objective observable fact.   Thought experiment: If 8 of of 10 directors would choose an actor who is white for a traditionally ""white"" role so as to NOT distract from a story, but only 5 out of 10 directors would choose a black actor for a traditionally ""black"" role so as to NOT distract from the story, then in our ""fair"" world black actors actually still would be underrepresented at the hands of racial bias.  Black actors are already at a handicap because we can't win roles which build the resume as easily as someone who is white. So if a black actor wants to win a ""white"" role, we're already the underdog because of our blackness. We have to PROVE that we can play the role well enough to make audiences forget that blackness. Being the better actor isn't simply enough- one has to be X% better than the best white actor. This means that over time, on average, it's easier for white actors to build credits, experience, and proven range. If we then start saying that black actors have to ALSO compete for roles traditionally played by black actors with white actors who have benefitted unjustly because of this system which they had no hand in creating, they would then be at even MORE of a handicap. Because on paper, the white actors would be the ""better, more experienced"" actors, however that doesn't take into account the systemic prejudice which was (primarily, but NOT necessarily ONLY) the cause of the black actor not having the same reputation, experience, range, etc.   people should be able to play any role that they can convincingly play   Obviously, anyone who is truly objective would agree with this statement, both ways, as do I. And when we live in a society where representation on stage and in the media is ACTUALLY equal, then I will fully support white actors competing for whatever roles they want. But you can't de-contextualize this conversation. That is not just.  I often refer people back to the Ta-Nehisi Coates ""The Case for Reparations"" article to understand this issue deeper. I've pulled a quote below. But in short, in our world of theater, we have to be prepared to UNDO the EXISTING damage we've done to a class of artists BEFORE we can truly be FAIRLY OBJECTIVE BOTH ways. (and I realize the original post targeted a UK audience, but systemic prejudice against POC is worldwide, although the WORST in the US. In fairness, I would feel less strongly about my case in the UK, because black actors actually ARE represented more fairly in the UK-- but STILL not fully equally represented)  FTA: ""...white supremacy is not merely the work of hotheaded demagogues, or a matter of false consciousness, but a force so fundamental to America that it is difficult to imagine the country without it.  And so we must imagine a new country. Reparations—by which I mean the full acceptance of our collective biography and its consequences—is the price we must pay to see ourselves squarely. The recovering alcoholic may well have to live with his illness for the rest of his life. But at least he is not living a drunken lie. Reparations beckons us to reject the intoxication of hubris and see America as it is—the work of fallible humans."" http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-reparations/361631/  Edited for Grammar"

Why does theatre only ever enforce historicity of this type when we want to justify either casting a black actor as a subordinate or servant, or not casting a black actor to play a lead?  Stanley can't be black, because it was the 1930s and a black person in New Orleans in the 1930s is crazy talk!  But Joseph can be white (and not even, like, olive-toned swarthy Italian white: we're talking Donny-Osmond Mormon-from-Utah white), because mumble mumble mumble."
Theatre,3ark7t,Tsiyeria,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:43:30 2015 UTC,"That's not what I said at all. The question was why a black man cast as Stanley in a non-black (read: otherwise white) production of Streetcar wouldn't work. Interracial marriages weren't a thing in the 1930's, most especially not in the South. The other part of my argument addressed the perpetuation of anti-black stereotypes (alcoholic, abusive).   As to your Donny Osmond example, I don't get it. I guess he's playing Jesus in some show somewhere? I certainly didn't advocate it. You have a valid point, but the problem is that the White Jesus is firmly entrenched in Western ideology. No one alive now was alive then, and there's no evidence (that I know of) that Jesus as an actual person existed. I'm not argue ng his existence. I'm saying that it's not in society's mind that Jesus shouldn't be played by a white man. On the other hand, the 1930's is still first and memory to a few people. And we know for a fact how people reacted on the subject of interracial marriage: violently."
Theatre,3ark7t,adminbeast,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:33:32 2015 UTC,"My point is that people only raise this objection (""But it's unrealistic!"") when it comes to casting black actors in white roles.

Someone asked a question, I posted a reasonable response, and suddenly I'm a racist because you know everything about me from one dramaturgical answer? The reason I only talked about a black actor is because the question was about a black actor!   Okay, here's one since you seem so anxious to see it. I personally don't believe that white people should perform in August Wilson plays. And I think it's a little ridiculous to cast a white man as the moor of Venice. Since white men aren't moors. But technically just being a black man doesn't make you a moor either. Moors were black Muslims from North Africa. So, what, Othello should be a Middle Easterner, yeah?  Edit: I also never said that Stanley couldn't be black. But historically speaking, if Stanley us black, Stella can't be white. Or Asian."

Theatre,3aqv5d,McGrumpy,2,Tue Jun 23 14:09:54 2015 UTC,"I have an MA in Theatre and am currently working on the PhD - however I am in the USA. That is a vastly different academic experience (coursework, qualifying exams, etc). However...  In the USA - of what I've seen so far - the norm is for people to come back to school to get their MAs. While some people do go straight from undergraduate, more people tend to have real life experience. What is the norm at your new program? Do you have alumnus you could speak to? Current students?  Unfortunately, I'm not sure what else to tell you because my experiences are likely to be very different due to the USA/UK gulf in just how graduate studies are constructed. However, keep in mind that universities have no interest in students (especially graduate students) being unable to complete their program of study. It's a bad investment from the school. If you're worried about going back to school, check out what resources Exeter itself (outside of your specific program) might have.   Finally, I wouldn't recommend you reading other students completed Master's Theses. Those pieces of writing are a testament to the experience and knowledge gained during the course of a Masters. It is not your level at the beginning of the course. At best, you'll intimidate yourself just as you are beginning."
Theatre,3aivf3,bennyfx32,8,Sat Jun 20 16:55:44 2015 UTC,"It's a completely different animal-- just about the only similarity is that both happen inside a theater.  You will be much less concerned about finding practical sound effects and creating ambiance through adding music and effects, and much more concerned with making sure the actors and the orchestra can be heard appropriately.  Sound design for a play can be extremely technically complicated, or it can be done with just a laptop and a boombox-- or heck, a few pots and pans and wooden spoons.  Sound for musicals can rarely be accomplished without a lot more technology.  Find a copy of the book ""Mixing a Musical"" by Shannon Slaton.  This walks you through the process of designing and mixing on Broadway, and you'll probably find some useful information there.  If at all possible, find someone who has done this before and ask to shadow/assist them for a show before jumping into it on your own.  Good luck!"

On the one hand, in cases where race is central to the role, then I agree that an actor of whatever particular race probably ought to be cast, or else a deliberate and specific choice to the contrary might be made. Casting black men as Othello, or Patrick Stewart as a white Othello in a reverse race cast is a good example.   On the other hand, should every actor of color have to always be used in ways that make their race a central part of the role? That seems limiting at best, and cruel at worst. If there were a black James Bond, should the entire movie be about how shocked people are at his blackness? Should the entire story be reshaped to make it a commentary on race? Or could you simply have a very good black actor portray James Bond to the best of his abilities? For comparison, consider Ellen Ripley in the first Alien movie. The Ripley role was originally written as a man, but the role went to Sigourney Weaver. They didn't rewrite the script to have her explicitly conquering gender prejudice and waving the flag of female empowerment, they simply had her do an incredible job with the character at hand, and the result was both a brilliant movie and a portrayal that still stands as an excellent example of a powerful female character.   We shouldn't ignore racial problems, but at the same time, if every time a person of color is onstage it has to be about their color, then that carries with it huge problems of its own."
Theatre,3admjk,Granite-M,0,Fri Jun 19 15:18:40 2015 UTC,"No. The point of color blind casting is to open up traditionally white roles -- or just new roles where race is not specified -- to actors of color, who are traditionally blocked from those roles. However, giving roles already written for a POC to white actors is terrible and racist, given how few roles are written explicitly for actors of color. People like to argue that colorblind casting should go both ways (allow white actors to have roles of color) because they don't understand the purpose of colorblind casting.   The article isn't about actors of color always playing roles where race is a central aspect."

Theatre,3aa2ar,Annicus,2,Fri Jun 19 20:27:47 2015 UTC,"There's a band of John Abbott College graduates from Montreal that's going.  They are doing A Day In December.  It's about the shooting that took place here at the Polytechnique way back when.  I'm a graduate from Abbott's Theatre Acting program myself (2013) and we've gotten quite a few good actors out of the program throughout the years, :)  I can't go support them myself but it would be great if some of you at Edinburgh could!"
Theatre,3aa2ar,tgonz510,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:00:06 2015 UTC,"From my experience going a couple of years ago, just go out and see as much as you can.   Talk to people in town or at other shows you go to word of mouth is some of the best way to find great shows to see,especially small ones in church basements that may not get much promotion."
Theatre,3aa2ar,Katurian42,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:05:46 2015 UTC,"I think Kitson is sold out now as you might expect.I saw him in tree with Tim key earlier this year, it was phenomenal. I've just looked the Summerhall website and it does indeed look great. I can recommend almost everything Northern Stage is bringing. There are a few companies I'm not aware of but I'm sure they,ll be great. Chris Thorpe is in two shows there as well as Every brilliant thing and whatever Forced entitainment are up to. The latter might be a little 'arty'. So basically you could spend a month there. I'm going to be up for two days, never going to fit it all in, especially as I'm a big stand up comedy fan as well.."
