GamerVideos,3dr3ok,X_DeadWalker_X,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:49:02 2015 UTC,"not at all! Basically my perspective was from steam's mission statement. That the badges are signs of good qualities not bad ones. Since most users recognize badges on quick glace as positive mentions, I argue that TB's approach of 30FPS badges would be better if instead he gave 60FPS badges."
GamerVideos,3dr3ok,chowdig,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:09:32 2015 UTC,I really don't mind if a game is 30fps or 60fps. Obviously the higher framerate the better but if the gameplay is good and playable then I'm not going to lose sleep over a sub sixty frame rate.

GamerVideos,3cd1qq,PsienceWins,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:24:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback :) Do you think, it would be a good idea to say a keyword? Like, ummm ""Now we move on"". Not sure if other people have a keyword that I should be aware of.  Condemned is a game that I saw people talk about, but never got around to playing till now. It's cool with their combat and I like the feeling of fights being ""messy"". However, I find the level areas to be kinda boring. The problem is that everywhere looks the same, and that's a shame....plus it gets kinda...supernatural?  Still, I'm finding it fun :)"
GamerVideos,3cd1qq,PsienceWins,2,Tue Jul 7 12:04:09 2015 UTC,"No. It feels forced. And really saying, ""Now we move on."" makes me think it's going to be an educational/informative let's play. There is some dead air during the video, but I don't feel it took away from the experience."

If I decide to get a game capture, I might pick it up for 360. Although, it's more supernatural from what I hear. Personally I find fighting drugged up people to be more scary than ghouls, or ghosts."

GamerVideos,3cc7sh,PsienceWins,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:57:21 2015 UTC,"I can see that. The start of the video was a lot of apologies and ""blah blah blah""s.

You had good reactions when crazy stuff did happen and the time you took a sip of your soda made me laugh since it wasn't exactly something that fit the mood of ""creepy shit just happened."""

GamerVideos,3c861j,OzzyVaz,3,Sun Jul 5 20:21:12 2015 UTC,"Constructive critiscisms for you:  You need to get audio balance and quality down. The video you linked for example, good quality audio but very quiet, then you video in MW2   this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QyI9MHlNwU  Your audio is a much better voulme but very peaky and poppy. So thats something to experiment with, download audacity and use some of its cleanup tools, they're all pretty simple, give it a go.  As for actual content, I understand people can't afford the latest and greatest games, but you're playing Modern Warfare 2. That game came out 6 years ago now, you need to try and keep your library of games semi-up-to-date if you're intending to carry on the post commentary style.  When it comes to lets plays age of the game is still a big issue, if you're playing a triple A game from the past few years only the latest videos will get a large amount of interest unless you can make them truly interesting. See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ud_Yn_xHXg  But on the flipside, you can also play more obscure indie games and older games that you either have never touched before or have a near-expert insight on."
GamerVideos,3c861j,Snowy1257,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:08:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with your critiscisms.  But I think the age of a game with like CS:GO isnt comparable to a game like dishonored. CS:GO has a big community, and a large competitive scene. People are going to be more interested in video's of it regardles if it tends to the hardcore or more casual audience I believe. Making GOOD CS:GO videos should be a great way to grow your channel."
GamerVideos,3c861j,Bockstiegel,2,Mon Jul 6 15:34:49 2015 UTC,"I was linking dishonored as a way of showing an older game in a interesting and inventive way that people still want to see, and yes its only a year old but in the world of Youtube a week for triple A is old."

GamerVideos,3c861j,PsienceWins,2,Wed Jul 8 18:29:29 2015 UTC,"On this video the audio is a little hard to make out.  It's a combination of low volume and either enunciation or being too close to the mic.  It sounds like you have a story you want to tell, so I'd suggest practicing it a little.  Post commentary allows this.  Also, don't tell us it's your first few videos and you're feeling it out.  It comes off as unconfident.  Great job on the call to action at the end.  That's the ""Like, comment, subscribe"" part.  Letting us know the upload schedule is also very good.  It's good information to put into your page description too."

I'm not opposed to cussing when it adds something to the commentary, but it seems like you guys are using it a bit too much for my taste.  That's just me, though. I'm sure there are plenty of viewers who like that kind of dialogue. But for me? It's like I'm watching this kid's game that I associate with being 11 years old (that's how old I was when I first played Link's Awakening) and it's weird to hear such strong adult language while watching a kid's game being played.  Again, this is just my view. I may be totally off-base here. I was just sharing my initial reaction."
GamerVideos,3bl0x5,CraftyCanuck,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:26:29 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from and I can see how it's off putting. I understand that we swear a lot but that's how we talk normally. It's natural for us. Just like how we insult each other and we're okay with it. It's just how we are. We are not trying to create a persona with our videos, we just want to be ourselves.   But I understand when it's excessive. I noticed that sometimes I swear as a filler because I have nothing else to say. That's something I need to work on. Other than that I don't see it as too much of a problem. Thanks for the critique."
