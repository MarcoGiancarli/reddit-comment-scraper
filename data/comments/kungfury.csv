kungfury,3c3v9f,autowikibot,2,Sat Jul 4 19:38:59 2015 UTC,"Theodore Rex (film):       Theodore Rex, also known as T. Rex,   is a 1995  buddy cop/science fiction/family film written and directed by Jonathan Betuel and starring Whoopi Goldberg. Though originally intended for theatrical release, the film went direct-to-video, and consequently became the most expensive direct-to-video film ever made at the time of its release.     The film was not well received,   and saw Whoopi Goldberg being nominated for Worst Actress at the 1996 Golden Raspberry Awards (as well as for Bogus and Eddie), where she lost to Demi Moore for both The Juror and Striptease.  Despite this, it was listed on the Billboard ""Top Video Rentals"" list for three weeks in August 1996, peaking at #34.    It is the first, and so far only, direct-to-video movie to receive any sort of Razzie nomination.

kungfury,3a3imk,TeamRocketsWobbuffet,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:47:31 2015 UTC,And look at the date for the posters.  They keep changing around release dates for all the stuff in the shop delaying it even more too.  How in the hell can it be so hard to print a digital image on a piece of paper with the tech we have nowadays too?  I've seen the machines they use for this in usa too.  It's not that hard for even just any person to go to a office max or something and just have the image printed on a poster ourselves.  And yeah I still love the movie Kung Fury and the music so so so much.  Just they need to find a new store to sell there merchandise.

kungfury,39zsp8,Smirnoff86,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:45:32 2015 UTC,I wanted to get that too but for the rolled in the tube option it would have cost me $50 more in shipping from a courier.  Just because I'm from usa.
kungfury,39zsp8,The_Dream_Shake,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:40:49 2015 UTC,The triangle tube is fairly normal for shipping large posters.

kungfury,37wiom,Luke-The-Bard,7,Sun May 31 00:00:03 2015 UTC,"My favorite answer is that the movie is a time loop. See, when Cobra couldn't convince Kung Fury he was dead he just let him relive the last 48 hours of his life since those were the badassest 48 hours he or any other human had ever experienced. Thus Kung Fury spends eternity fighting the Kung Fuhrer over and over."
kungfury,37wiom,tehmlem,1 point,Sun May 31 04:10:18 2015 UTC,"No, you got it wrong. Kung Fury didn't relive those 48 hours over and over. A time loop means that an event from the future caused an event from the past, perpetuating itself.  See, the Kung Fury from 2 days ago fights the arcade machine and sees the Swastika. After Hitler attacks the police station, Kung Fury searches for Hitler in the past, where Thor accidentally sends Hitler to the future, 2 days ago.  See, if Hitler hadn't attacked the police station (or set up the killing arcade machine in the first place), Kung Fury would have had no reason to go back in time. So it's like a chicken-and-egg situation that never ends."
kungfury,37wiom,otakuman,7,Sun Jun 7 04:58:25 2015 UTC,"Short answer: like the rest of the movie, don't think about it too hard  Longer answer: Kung Fury's actions in Nazi Germany caused the events in Miami preceding the police chief's death to happen -- Kung Fury may have noticed the swastika the first time, but have not known what it meant. As for why he's going through this timeline a second time? See short answer."
kungfury,37wiom,swimfellow,3,Sun May 31 02:27:34 2015 UTC,The timeline changed a bit.  That piece that broke off the arcade machine didn't in the first run through the loop.  You see that piece and it's intact.
kungfury,37wiom,GeorgeAmberson,4,Sun May 31 18:02:30 2015 UTC,"Every movie does timetravel differently, so apparently it wasn't there the 1st time or something? yeah i dont even know don't listen to me"

""Who cares if it makes sense!  It's awesome!  Cut another line!"""
kungfury,37wiom,GeorgeAmberson,2,Sun May 31 18:03:45 2015 UTC,"Some options  A. Kung Fury just asked Thor to be sent forward in time to before Hitler killed his police force since he figured he changed the timeline, and they wouldn't be killed. Maybe he just wanted to destroy the arcade machine again for fun so he chose a little earlier.  B. Or that he just didn't notice that the machine was hitler's doing in the first place, and just had some kind of dejavu due to his Kung Fury powers, but the timeline will still be different because hitler came forward in time with the eagle this time, or he did last time also and it just didn't show it to not ruin the time loop effect. Anyway who cares"
kungfury,37wiom,argusromblei,2,Mon Jun 1 01:50:42 2015 UTC,"I thought perhaps it was misdirection.  The scene with the police chief never mentions robots before hitler shoots everyone, so maybe it was a different incident?  Maybe in the timeline that happens first, then the events of the movie, then the battle with the robot is both the beginning and the end."

I recommend it to anyone really, unless they live under a rock and think '80s was an era of bell bottoms and sideburns.  I've recently made a survey in an '80s-dedicated sub. Over 50% of people reading it were born in the '90s. It may seem strange, but I think it's because the appeal of the '80s doesn't seem to have generational boundaries."
kungfury,37ufu9,GeorgeAmberson,1 point,Sat May 30 19:29:21 2015 UTC,"'80s-dedicated sub. Over 50% of people reading it were born in the '90s.   I remember reading people complaining about kids claiming to be ""80's kids"" when they were born in the 80's and were like 7 when it ended.  This was on usenet in 1998."
kungfury,37ufu9,GeorgeAmberson,1 point,Sun May 31 18:06:36 2015 UTC,"Heh. Well, I'm not claiming to be an ""'80s kid"" because I'm just not one. I feel not nostalgia, but rather an appreciation for the bygone era. And to be frank, I think a lot of the popular movies, games and other stuff from the era didn't age so well on their own.  Reading the retro subs, I usually notice two different kinds of reactions: there is a strictly nostalgic one – like, ""I had this exact Trapper Keeper! Oh the memories!"", and the other one is more objective, just treating '80s as some big movement or something like that.   It's nearly impossible to describe what draws people of different ages to that decade. You either see it, or you don't.  Nostalgia can only be experienced for what one actually experienced at an earlier time. I feel nostalgic about some GameBoy Advance games, some '90s and early 2000s TV shows and music. I've seen someone describe the objects of nostalgia as containing ""canned emotions"". It's like that box of Tic Tac which has that smell after you have eaten all the drops. And I don't know if it's just me, but after some time experiencing nostalgia, it wears off. I have new memories attached to the old object."
kungfury,37ufu9,GeorgeAmberson,1 point,Sun May 31 19:38:04 2015 UTC,"Well put.  I wasn't accusing you of anything.  I was born in '82 so I'm most decisively a 90's kid.  The 80's though?  Well, it was the fucking 80's.  The popular culture was so rich and so freaking zany.  Something I'm surprised about is that the 90's were also rich and zany with popular culture (although a bit more subdued).  Living through it, everything was normal but now things can seem kind of insane.  For instance the north american SNES.  I swear to God that thing looked good when it came out.  I remember thinking it was super cool looking.  The way the power and reset switches were unique and the long controller ports.  Now it looks pretty terrible, but I remember when it was awesome.  I remember getting my first look in Nintendo Power #20 in 1991 and being stoked.  Hell, sometimes once in a great while I can feel the awesomeness that was Super Mario Bros on the NES and remember how cool it was that the ? blocks scrolled in SMB3."
kungfury,37ufu9,GeorgeAmberson,2,Sun May 31 20:34:23 2015 UTC,"I agree, in the '80s, sci-fi was on the rise, new romantic and metal was the hottest thing, and the design also was full of playful geometric patterns and bright colors. The craziest ideas got very popular.  North American SNES actually looks very good despite obviously aged. Personally, I prefer PAL version a little more though. Of course, nowadays the trends are radically different – devices have minimalistic look and aim for the thinnest profile, like iPhone or iPad, or something else, looking more ""modern"". But still, it clearly communicates something – it has clear geometric symmetry, for example. And the SNES joypad is just hands down one of the most beautiful things Nintendo has ever made. It deserves to be made into a keychain.  Interesting that you mention it. I think that truly good graphics don't age. Maybe part of the reason for this is that games have actual artists who make concepts and stuff actually used in the game. Old games prove that you don't really need advanced graphics to make amazing things, although it certainly can help. People still love pixel art, they make games and videos featuring it – nobody really told them to go back, they just did what they liked."
kungfury,37ufu9,MrTimmannen,1 point,Sun May 31 21:16:53 2015 UTC,"Yep.  SNES graphics are awesome I could play SMW all day long.  Once upon a time the graphics were amazing.  Hell, I still have a video of me sucking badly at it as a 9 year old.  I couldn't wrap my head around the spin-jump A and was just using it as my main jump.  Fast forward to now when I can beat it twice an hour and get all 96 goals in about 3.  You know what's interesting?  I watched an episode of Star trek TNG at the gym the other day on a 5 year old iPad.  This was ""The Bonding"" from season 3.  Kid lost his mom and was watching home videos on a PADD.  I was watching his 24th century memories on a PADD through my iPad.  It's like the same device minus a few controls on the bottom.  My old iPad was actually better.  How trippy is that?"
kungfury,37ufu9,Gimdir,1 point,Sun May 31 22:26:19 2015 UTC,"Oh yes. I guess it's just that as you get older, your coordination gets better. I used to play SMW on my friend's SNES and also sucked badly. I still haven't beaten it – I didn't play it long enough, I guess, but nowadays when I play it, I am by far better than I used to be. That said, I beat SMW2 and New Super Mario Bros for DS, collecting every secret etc.  By the way, I don't know if you heard about it, there are such things as TAS (Tool-Assisted Speedrun) videos. Basically, it's almost like playing games as a sport, trying to achieve the fastest possible speedrun using emulators and different tools, while still keeping it possible in theory to perform on an actual console. There's a wide community at tasvideos.org, and they have some amazing videos, e.g. SMW beaten in 1 hour 19 minutes with all 96 goals. There are also different runs which utilize game glitches, which can last 20 seconds or so.  And about iPads – yes, I'm also amazed that technology today is already ahead of some science fiction of the not so distant past. Nowadays most people have quite sophisticated personal digital assistants, we are interconnected by a computer network which holds an incomprehensible amount of information, and we also have Google Glass and Tesla S which if developed further can transform our life even further. It's also notable that tech which is 5 year old is considered outdated – I assume that it's more powerful than some supercomputers built back in the day."

Yep, I know about TAS.  I think the first one I saw was SMB3 and I actually believed someone was pulling it off.  This was before it was a common thing.  I'm wondering if the technology has started to become more of a menace than a tool.  I'm really not going to be digging hooking brains up to the internet.  That's my head-canon for where the Borg came from."
kungfury,37ufu9,thankyouforfu,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:58:36 2015 UTC,"Recently scientists have succeeded in reading nerve signals through a sensor implanted into a human brain and controlling a robotic arm through it. Right now it gives hope to paralyzed people.  Today millions of people work very tedious jobs. iPhone assembly line, for example, consists of a lot of people doing a very robot-like work. I assume such workers may be replaced with machines in the nearest future as automation might cross a new threshold, since computers get better in recognition of objects, while simultaneously becoming smaller and cheaper.   Previously in history, scientific advancements have freed people from routine work and allowed to allocate resources to more productive and creative jobs. If it wasn't fertilizers, medicine, transport, computers, modern building materials and other advancements, we'd be pretty much stuck in agrarian civilization struggling to feed ourselves and not to catch any diseases.   I think Maslow's hierarchy of needs is right. I think that democracy wouldn't be prevalent if people were still concerned with meeting their basic needs. So I think technology will bring us even more freedom and time than we've ever enjoyed.  So I consider technology more of a miracle than a threat.  As for brain implants, there's another interesting tendency: technology usually flows in the directions people want to pay for. People's concern with privacy and aversion to brain surgery will never allow for something like brain chips, especially in US. Various governmental institutions likely wouldn't approve such devices, too.   I think instead of technocratic 1984 we are heading to digital hedonism, because people want pleasures, and they will pay for them. Look at modern computers – I think it wouldn't be an overstatement that their power is used most widely for entertainment. Companies like Nvidia and such wouldn't really be as famous if it wasn't for video games. If anything else, we are heading to a time when we don't really have a need to leave our childhood. It is becoming more and more ""normal"" to play video games at an older age.   With video games, movies, internet communities, and, ahem, pornography, people have more and more ways to let off steam, anger, emotions, fulfill sex desires, etc. People won't go to war because there's nothing to do. They also feel interconnected with each other, can get advice and be heard much more often. This broadens their horizons and in essence gives them a fuller picture of the world. Thus, it becomes no longer possible to stuff their brains only with narrow-minded ideas like conspiracy theories, myths etc. Moreover, internet gives minorities a similar opportunity to have a platform for getting their message across. So what I'm saying is that web actually unites people into one big society with equal rights. People who feel in contact with the whole world realize that it is no longer acceptable to have aggression towards some other group simply because they are different. An argument like ""we have to wage war on someone because they are another nation and you must do it for your country"" no longer works.   I could continue for a long time, but TL;DR: technology is mostly good and people will know if it's bad."

The T-Rex alone looked almost as good as anything coming from Jurassic World, a film with a budget of at least $150 million. Obviously there aren't many practical effects in this film, and there are sequences like the side scrolling fight that were meant to be ridiculous looking (especially since it was built to imitate and lampoon things like Street Fighter), but it's also a film that was made on a shoestring budget with barely a handful of talented visual effects artists working on it.  The CGI in this film does look better than a great many films with a budget of $12.6 million. It looks better than several films with a $90 million budget.

Just call the police and shoot a few cops? Why? And before you say it doesn't matter, it does because the movie's story is very loosely hanging by threads, to the point of being almost non-existent. We were shown a Shaolin Temple in the trailer and then they just use that in a silly sequence that claims Kung Fury was hit by lightning and bit by a cobra in an alleyway, and passed out on his feet while being transported to the past and learning Kung Fury. This is so absurd that any comedic factor just flies out the window. So was his name Kung Fury or was that the name of the martial art he used? Who knows, who cares, right?

kungfury,37c8wp,Year3030,21,Wed May 27 14:58:17 2015 UTC,"Hitler continues to wreak havoc through space and time. He appears at specific times and events to alter the course of time in his favor. According to ancient Kung Fury prophecy Hackerman landed in the year 3005 to guide the seventh world army into battle against Hitler's galactic army of laser powered robotic space dinosaurs that he genetically engineered to obey his every command.  Hackerman wasn't just a beacon of hope for my people, he is my father. Shortly after arriving in the year 3005 he met my mother. After a major defeat at Titor's Ridge in the year 3030 Hitler's army of laser powered robotic space dinosaurs began to systematically destroy the world.  We were losing the war and we knew there was only one thing to do. My father gave me the glove of power and sent me back in time from the year 3030 to find Kung Fury and hack him back to the future to turn the tide against Hitler and win the war, or else.  If I do not complete my mission Hackerman, my father, will forever be stuck in the year 3030 and Hitler will rule time and space with his army of laser powered robotic space battle dinosaurs.

kungfury,37c8wp,acheleo,30,Sun May 31 00:10:20 2015 UTC,"Ok guys you won't believe me, but I've done some research. please hear me out.  Before we want to know where he went we need to understand, what time is it that we are talking about? well, I heard him say in the video that he requires about 256KBs of RAM. He also mentions that it requires a lot of money. I looked it up and turns out that in January 1982 256kbs of RAM were really expensive but affordable, and later they would plummet in price (source: http://www.jcmit.com/memoryprice.htm)  Hackerman said that he was about to warp to 2005, by looking at the workings of the device it did seem to work. So I assumed that he landed in January 2005. Being the person he is, he wouldn't just wallow in his misery, he'll hatch a plan and try to call for help and return to the past. There has to be somewhere he will try to get peoples attention.  I looked up to see what major events happened in 2005. At first I didn't see anything special, North Korea doing stuff with nuclear weapons, Pope John Paul 2 died, Requesting aid for tsunami hit in Indonesia... Nothing interesting. (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005)  I decided to delve deeper though. Since I assumed he made it at January I looked up what happened in Jan 2005. And that's where things started looking fishy, or maybe as Hackerman would say ""phishy"". (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2005)  We know that he went there with little to help him but himself and his super hacker mode glove (which he is seen wearing just before vanishing). So he should be able to hack into computers and hardware easily, however he probably didn't have his wallet on him (It's in his fanny pack probably, and who wears a fanny pack sitting on a chair?), So he needs money.  As a former connect the dots champion I could clearly see a pattern emerging here, Turns out that during Jan 2005 a lot of viruses and phishing scams were sent to people pleading for support regarding to the Tsunamis, these included also viruses and other hacky sketchy stuff.  (sources: http://money.cnn.com/2005/01/07/technology/tsunami_scams/ http://www.4law.co.il/zumani5.htm )  I looked up the internets, and this is what I came up with.  http://s23.postimg.org/sbz2ze1yz/help_tsunami_2005_stuck_in_future.jpg http://s24.postimg.org/6uxpcaet1/tsunami_2005_scam_hack_time_hackermann.jpg  Also looking at the metadata you can see in one photo that it was actually taken in Indonesia. This guy was really serious on going home. I hope he made it..."

kungfury,37c8wp,swierzakcris,3,Thu May 28 08:35:00 2015 UTC,"(TL;DR)  OK, so...  When I saw Hackerman, I knew i've seen this guy somewhere else BEFORE ""Kung Fury"". So I did some research, which involved a Star Wars marathon, 3 League of Legends matches and 7 eggs (thanks HowToBasic), I did found nothing however. But enlightening came right when I didn't expect it- I woke up at 3 AM just to find green goo all over my room. Watching 80's films prepared me for such things- I immidately caught my phone and hit 555-2368. Yeah, what I needed was a Ghostbusters squad!  As soon as they arrived, I noticed that their logo was changed a bit, featuring a fabulous guy standing next to a ghost. But i decided to ask about it later, as I needed their help first and foremost. Then reality hit me like a truck- right next to Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd, from the van descended Hackerman himself!  Riddle of the great computer guy began to solve itself, as I started to search for some informations about ""that 3rd ghostbuster"". According to the film, so called dr. Egon Spengler was a great mind and creator of all the stuff they had. Sounds familiar? It should, since Hackerman also was an inventor- of freakin' time hacking! Spengler also was world-anxious, totally like a computer man! By the way, I checked that logo I already mentioned- and guess what? After closer look I realised it was him- Hackerman!  To sum up, it seems that computers are not strong enough to warp a portal to the future (even with mind-blowing 256kB RAM!), but it is just enough to hack the time backwards- so instead of sending Hackerman 20 years forward, it sent him back to 1965. He then picked up parapsychologic studies, changed his name and shaved glorious mustache to avoid being found by Kung Furher himself. He knew however that he has to help saving the world, so after finishing his studies he found a job as scientist, and that's how idea of Ghostbusters was born. That also solves the great mystery why Ghostbusters 3 didn't involve Hackerman- they had to tell ppl actor is dead, but the truth is our favourite computer man finally found a way to get back to his universe!"

kungfury,37c8wp,OG-Slacker,2,Sun May 31 04:23:59 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, I made a tool a few months ago that may help find Hackerman, it's based on an idea from a xkcd comic.   It's a tool that lets you travel backwards in time, the basic premise of the app is that sliding the slider to the right will change the value of P as described in the formula:  T = (Current date) – (e20.3444p3+3 – e3)years  P is the percentage of time elapsed, and adjusting it will give you T, a year backwards in time from the current date.  Since Hackerman presumably went to 2005, we can find him based on our current year 2015 and travel backwards in time.  You can read more about it here: http://shahnewazkhan.ca/portfolio/xkcd/ and make sure to check out the video to get a better understanding of how it works. If you would like to use this tool, contact me through the comments in the video, good luck in your search!"

After compiling a web index search , utilizing a cross functional algorithm against the NSA database; I was able to triangulate a decent vector of his probable location. Simple Darwinian math.   After decrypting the data through the cloud interface app I created (at 12), I was able to use a hyper-visor to filter out abstract GPS data.   Finally after factoring in chonio-geometry, and allowing for the Da Vinci variable, I've come to the conclusions that he has broken the 4th dimensional wall, and is rapidly fluctuating in time and space.  The attached are the screen caps that I have been able to compile.   In order to view the images you will need at least an HD capable video card, capable of viewing 1040 x 420 images.  After downloading the images: use ENHANCE.exe to enlarge them images.   Warning viewing of these images at extremely high resolutions, or in very close proximity to your viewing device may cause eye strain.   Don't worry if you can't find him. It could mean that your computer isn't capable enlarging the image enough.   [Data Dump]  Note: no computer based image enhancement software was used in the creation of this image."

kungfury,37byv0,TeamRocketsWobbuffet,1 point,Wed May 27 09:34:18 2015 UTC,"This subreddit is very low in participation. If I didn't visit it, I wouldn't even know about the announcements. You can claim there's buzz, but I have a website and podcast and on social media, no one in my circles/friends lists are talking about it. That may be anecdotal, but that's what I'm seeing.   And what other 'bunch of major TV networks in the US' are premiering it apart from El Rey? (is that even a major network?)"

There have been a bunch of articles a while back across various sites due to the True Survivor music video...I wonder if maybe that should have been released closer to the actual release date.  I also feel at this point the release is just promotional as a feature film has been announced and KS funds + other stuff has probably paid for the short."

I'm sure blogs and websites will pick up on it after the fact, but for now it looks like people may be a bit forgetful of the initial hype. They shouldn't prioritize the backers so much with announcements, because they need to keep interest in the rest of the masses if they intend to make money selling it and getting revenue from Youtube."

Except perhaps the full length movie. ;)  You are truly very talented, David Sandberg. What 3d apps did you use, if any? (for dinosaur)  I was wondering, is it allowed to have a free showing of this movie in our local cinema here in Brønnøysund, Norway? Because, I know the person who runs that cinema, and I could probably get it in there. More audiences. :)"

kungfury,32tvfl,wrenagade419,15,Thu Apr 16 18:14:01 2015 UTC,"The transition from doing it all yourself to working with around 40 VFX artists have been the most challenging task in this project. Because the movie relies a lot on VFX because it was shot on green screen, you have to get all of these people to think the same way as you. A lot of the times, the VFX was 'too good' and modern, so it was a lot about getting everyone in on the 80s look. Very proud of the final result and can't wait to show it to everyone!"

kungfury,31owog,SleepyJ555,6,Tue Apr 7 00:19:32 2015 UTC,Apparently 30 minutes. Which is really short IMO. I feel like the plot is going to be too fast to enjoy.

kungfury,31kybe,TALQVIST,5,Mon Apr 6 02:32:38 2015 UTC,"Here's the latest post on their official website:    Kung Fury on Reddit! MAR 22, 2015 Hey guys!  One of our friends suggested that we should not only communicate one way, but also let you guys get to know each other a bit more. He said that Reddit is a good place to start. There is a sub reddit setup already for Kung Fury and we'll setup some threads there for those of you who would like to build on the project and get to know each other a bit more. We're really excited about this as Reddit played such an important part in Kung Fury's initial Kickstarter campaign.  You can find the sub reddit here - http://www.reddit.com/r/kungfury  Hope you like the last clip we posted. The story behind the behind the scenes is actually quite funny. We bought the VHS camera from a second hand outlet in Sweden. The only challenge was that we didn't get any tapes to record on. One of our friends called all the outlets in Sweden to find someone who had a few of them left. Once he found someone who actually still had them in stock he had been getting rejected for quite some time with a laugh and a sigh... so... all he found himself to say when the voice on the other end of the phone said that they had some was ""I'll take them all..."" .... The sales representative responded with ""so you'll take all two""... hmm... either way... Now that I write it, it doesn't seem as fun as it was at the time... perhaps because of the fatigue at that point. Anyways.  We're working on setting a final release date for Kung Fury and we'll announce it as soon as we do! Hang in there for a bit longer. In the meantime, here's a picture of two Viking girls and a telephone:  Cheers!**   As you can see, the official word is ""soon"". There are other discussions in the subreddit that go into a little more detail. Apparently their SFX work has taken slightly longer than they originally thought. My assumption/guess would likely be sometime in the next month or two."

Me and my wonderful team are testing our little setup in a couple weeks and an interesting question came up as we were talking about testing the trailer just to see how its going to look.  Now the film is finished, has it changed in format, in terms of sound and size? The trailer was funded by Sandbergs own pocket and the feature raised more on Kickstarter than anticipated, so we were curious as to whether it was enough to improve upon the techniques used in the trailer.  Would showing the feature be physically different compared to when we test the only two minutes we have at the moment?"

kungfury,3053ea,krakrakra,6,Wed Mar 25 00:17:31 2015 UTC,Also consider they they only wrapped shooting a few months ago and this film is largely VFX based. The post production on this could have easily taken a year.
