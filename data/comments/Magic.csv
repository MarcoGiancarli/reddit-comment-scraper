Magic,3e3sdu,Robert_B_Marks,3,Tue Jul 21 19:04:05 2015 UTC,Awesome article. I really enjoy that you explore the history of magic and cover so many awesome topics! Keep up the epic work!
Magic,3e3sdu,BrundageMagic,4,Tue Jul 21 23:34:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  The plan for next week is to talk about performing for magicians vs. performing for lay people...also known as an excuse for retelling the story of the trick that fooled Houdini... :D  And, please share it around if you like it!"
Magic,3e3sdu,RandyJackson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:41:22 2015 UTC,Did you notice Penn say to the duo that he disapproves of magic that is made to look dangerous? He seemed to not even want to talk to them and that's why I think he had Teller show the drawing. Penn does advocate for safety and everything. I have no doubt their magic bullet act is extremely safe.
Magic,3e1in6,antdude,2,Tue Jul 21 06:11:46 2015 UTC,Apologies to the folks across the pond. Here's the full episode.  Cleaner version of Brian Brushwood's performance.
Magic,3e1in6,gregantic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:00:51 2015 UTC,That second guy printing the selfie was pretty awesome.
Magic,3e1in6,thisdesignup,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:13:58 2015 UTC,"I felt he really missed the mark across the board, and everything felt super forced to me. The selfie gag seemed really obvious (and he really dropped the ball with the beer pour gimmick). I would love to see more magic in that style, but his stuff on the show fell flat for me."

It also lets you use other websites, the only issue is a small pop up when you start chrome up that you close by pressing cancel."
Magic,3e1qm0,semaxX,3,Tue Jul 21 07:50:30 2015 UTC,"Looking good! See if you can keep the hand where the spongeball is hidden just that little bit more relaxed, which will help it look that 10% more natural. Would be great if we could see your face too, half of misdirection is where you're gaze is focussed on. Looking forward to seeing more :)"
Magic,3e1qm0,windwaker9,3,Tue Jul 21 10:28:29 2015 UTC,"I second this. Not being able to see your face, I just immediately burn your hands. It looks like you're definitely on the right track though. Just relax a bit."
Magic,3e1qm0,Mattszat913,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:54:48 2015 UTC,thanks for the feedback. I tried to relax haha. Maybe it needs more practise:)

Definitely needs a bit more relaxation, but I would also suggest that you work on smoothness. When you do ""the move"", I'm noticing a slight pop of your hand. Logically, this probably wouldn't happen if you were actually putting the balls in your hand. PM me if you're confused or want some more advice, but it looks pretty good as is ðŸ˜Š"

Magic,3dza8q,DDKs_flow,2,Tue Jul 21 02:57:23 2015 UTC,Not sure which one you are referring too? Zach mueller - The Phanthom Change Ross Bertram - Tebe Change Ed Marlo - Snap Change
Magic,3dza8q,MattTheGreat2008,2,Tue Jul 21 12:25:27 2015 UTC,Oh yeah should said which one or ones I wanted to find. Well I basically wanted sources/names for each one of those except for the snap change. Makes me appreciate the video more that I didn't even recognize the snap change in the video before you said one of them was one and I was looking for it too. But yeah thanks I'll get to practicing I guess.
Magic,3dza8q,DDKs_flow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:40:34 2015 UTC,"No problem, yeah it looks as though the snap changes are also used for the ones where he raises the card and then brings it down. If not I'm stumped! They are done really smoothly though but it could just be the video quality making them look so smooth and soft. Either way, these changes are done really well and super smooth so good work OP.  Btw, the fan change looks like most fan changes to be honest so no one source for that)"

Magic,3dyahp,mahucharn,3,Mon Jul 20 18:13:42 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest you take a look at Michael Vincent. He isn't too funny, but his storytelling skills are top notch and chilling. Pop Hayden is a classic story teller, and quite a great comedian. Vernon is also with watching - beautiful stories with great effects. David Copperfield tells some wonderful stories with his magic, though they contain more of a serious story, as is the case with Derren Brown."

Magic,3dyahp,BigIdeaMagic,2,Mon Jul 20 16:56:34 2015 UTC,Dai Vernon is by far one of the best in my opinion. Get your hands on the dvd set of Dai Vernon - Revelations. A great deal of wisdom in his words.
Magic,3dyahp,FrothyD,4,Mon Jul 20 17:30:27 2015 UTC,I don't know that I would put Vernon as a storytelling magician in the effects he performed.
Magic,3dyahp,BigIdeaMagic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:09:11 2015 UTC,Just watch Revelations--you will be amazed. Some might say it's more important to pay attention to the spaces between the effects if you're looking for his best storytelling...

Magic,3e0yeq,harrylorayne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:00:05 2015 UTC,"What the hell is wrong with this guy. I got to the point in the video where he said ""Uhhh, Uh, I don't want to brag.""  THat's approximately 2 seconds in.  Uh, means you're stumped. He's stumped, 2 seconds into performing.  I can't watch this video. Its detrimental to my own views on magic to see someone in front of an audience, performing, that has no business performing."
Magic,3e0yeq,DogmaDog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:52:41 2015 UTC,"lol. You should see him performing in magic advertisements, e.g. Royalistic by Juan Tamariz.  It's 10x worse."

Magic,3dxw49,RandellX,4,Mon Jul 20 12:59:10 2015 UTC,"My personal favorite is Vanishing Inc Magic. Joshua Jay and Andy Gladwin spend a lot of time picking out the best material to put on their website. In fact, I bought three books from them last night. The only downside is that sometimes their inventory can be limited.  PenguinMagic is a great shop, though their advertisement e-mails can be a bit much at times. There's a lot of garbage to sift through (but you can always use internet reviews), but search hard enough and you'll be able to find some real gems with nearly unbeatable prices.  Theory11 is another decent online shop, though I'd avoid getting sucked into cardistry if I were you (especially with ""premium"" decks).  Ellusionist is the other big online magic shop. They've overhyped a lot of their things (I would NEVER join their exclusive club, seeing as how you'd need to spend well over $100 just for membership), but also put out some decent products. A few of my favorite purchases have been the Metal series by Eric Jones (coin magic) to the Messado Rings (they're like mini linking rings).  Whenever possible, I like to buy straight from the creator's website. If you know who invented the trick that you are buying, often they will receive a greater cut of the profits when you order directly from them.  Anyway, hope this helped. Feel free to ask more questions as you have them :)."
Magic,3dxw49,mahucharn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:15:09 2015 UTC,Are the Messado Rings worth it? I've been debating whether or not to get them. I'm a bit of a beginner and have never worked with rings before. Is it fairly simple to pick up?
Magic,3dxw49,flynnster50,2,Wed Jul 22 02:26:07 2015 UTC,"A lot of people will say that larger rings are easier. I started with the Messado Rings and have nothing but good things to say about them. When you first start practicing though, you'll likely hurt your hands a decent amount. Just gotta take things slowly & surely."

I am just as curious as to what the heck is going on, and can't wait for the release. I hope I offered some help!"

Magic,3dujut,I_can_vouch_for_that,2,Sun Jul 19 21:55:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you. The story goes, I contacted my older married brother for advice and he brought up how I probably shouldn't do magic as it may take away the moment from her and focus on me. So I knew how wise of a decision that was and I was hell bent on not doing magic at all.   The plan was to do this for Christmas, she was highly expecting it then so I thought I would surprise her for her birthday, this idea sprang to me the day before and I had to do so much, get the parent's blessing, think of what to do, what to say. Whilst getting the blessing from the parents they looked slightly confused when I said I wouldn't present the ring with magic, they told me it's part of who I am and my charm, so voila. She loves fire/flash paper, had to include it. I was so nervous my steal of the TT wasn't I had shown the flash paper. Worked out lovely."
Magic,3dujut,BrundageMagic,3,Mon Jul 20 19:25:46 2015 UTC,"She was looking at the ring most of the time thinking ' talk faster so I can say yes '....  Congrats, I wish you both a lifetime of happiness."

Magic,3duyj2,harrylorayne,2,Sun Jul 19 22:38:58 2015 UTC,During psy touch it would be better for the volunteer to say how many times they were touched instead of you asking them if they were touched twice
Magic,3duyj2,iFuJ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:24:41 2015 UTC,"Usually they do. This person flubbed and said she felt touches on her head and elbow; I had to quickly spin it into ""this area?"" and gesture around between her head and elbow. Normally I ask them ""how many"" and they say ""two taps""."
Magic,3duyj2,ksaj,2,Tue Jul 21 06:56:21 2015 UTC,"I think the patter is pretty entertaining, and you handled the psy touch flub pretty well.   But you didn't handle the swallow one very well at all. I don't want to expose it, so I have to be a bit delicate with my wording here. Since the person was probably drinking, you might fare better if you got him talking a bit first. It subtly creates the conditions you need for it to work. There is also an important step dealing with positioning that you completely missed.  You could use a bit more ""double speak"" to manage the audience perception. For example: with Emily, you could omit the word ""back"" because the effect is stronger if the audience doesn't realize the card was pre-folded. ""Fold the card into 4"" is better than ""fold the card back in 4""."
Magic,3duyj2,ksaj,2,Tue Jul 21 18:12:06 2015 UTC,"Oh! That is a great detail about folding the card! Thank you! Details like this, stacked up by the hundreds or thousands, are what come together to make a routine amazing. Thank you for adding to my stash! =)  The swallow one was my first attempt at performing this, and was meant to be a hypnotic induction into a loss of voice, then a forgetting of his name, then a collapse/ passing out on stage Derren Brown religious conversion-style. The induction totally flubbed so I went with the backup plan."
Magic,3duyj2,ksaj,2,Tue Jul 21 18:42:02 2015 UTC,"Back in the 90's I worked in an occult store and used the throat binding effect to freak out the pagans who really shouldn't be surprised at all by this sort of thing. As a hypnotic convincer, it is hugely more effective than the eye or hand lock because of how startling it is to the spectator.   I like the progression you were hoping for, since each step kinda reenforces the conditions needed for the ""passing out"" and you can simply scale it back if any part fails. You really needed a better out for the failed throat bind, though. Blaming the spec is a huge no-no.  The two things I mentioned will increase your hit rate big time. Since you completely overlooked the positioning aspect, I am convinced that was where it broke down. I'm assuming you know why it works, and should be able to decipher what I mean. If not, feel free to pm."
Magic,3duldn,RandomNerdGeek,4,Sun Jul 19 17:03:00 2015 UTC,"Technique-wise, I can only really speak for card magic, so my votes would be for Expert Card Technique and Encyclopedia of Card Tricks.  Expert Card Technique in particular is very much about refining your sleights and adding advanced techniques.  These books are not in your list, but you'll want them anyway, as they are about performance theory.  They are:   Magic and Showmanship, by Henning Nelms Strong Magic, by Darwin Ortiz   Those two books will help a LOT when it comes to refining your performance into something that is uniquely you.  Strong Magic in particular is something of a standard text when it comes to bumping performances up to the next level, but Nelms is quite good too, and they do work very nicely as companion volumes to each other.  (On a related note, regarding lucking into all those books for only $30 - HOLY SHIT!  That's one hell of a start to a magic library.  You may count me very jealous, sir - very jealous indeed.)"
Magic,3duldn,Robert_B_Marks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:13:31 2015 UTC,"I think I'll take your suggestion and read Expert Card Technique next, especially if it's similar to Royal Road. Encyclopedia of Card Tricks seems like a reference text, and after I skimmed it, I believe there are some generic ""tricks"" in there among some workable material.  I've heard great things about Strong Magic and plan on getting it soon. It's just a shame that that it's so expensive, but I sure it'll be worth it. :-/ Thanks for all your advice!"

Magic,3duldn,notsomethingcreative,2,Sun Jul 19 21:56:34 2015 UTC,"Damn, you're lucky. There are some great books there.    Expert at the Card Table: This is one of the greatest (and most influential) books ever written. You should really study this sometimes. But maybe not quite yet. I would save this until you've got a few good tricks and most of the basics down, and then read it for its historical value and to pick up some tricks to improve the things you know. It's packed full of small useful tips.  Scarne on Card Tricks: I actually really like this book. It's a true beginners book, with almost no sleights, but most of the tricks gets a lot better when you add in some false shuffles and cuts.    *Lorayne books: I really can't remember one from another, but generally his books are pretty solid. Whatever you think of him as a person he's one of the better card guys out there. The books generally contains at least a few tricks that really works, and a sleight or two that you can add to your arsenal.   *Hugard books: Those two are two of the best books out there. They are somewhat dated, but just full of great basics. Expert Card Technique is sort of like Royal Road advanced edition, as it contains some more advanced things.  *Modern Coin Magic: If you're into coins I'm lead to believe that this is the shit. It's the coin bible, all there is to say about this.  *Practical Mental Magic: This is more of an advanced book I feel. If in some years you want to explore mentalism you can read it, but 13 steps are better I think.   *Dai Vernon's Ultimate Secret of Card Magic: Another classic. This should also be studied sooner or later.   *Card Control: If you want to spend the next 15 years alone in your room practicing this book is great. It's full of technical sleights that will take a while to master.   Those are the ones I remember reading, and if I were you I would start with either Expert Card Technique (if you want more techniques to practice) or one you could leaf through some of the Lorayne books til you find something a routine you like."
Magic,3duldn,c4rlito,2,Sun Jul 19 20:08:26 2015 UTC,"All of those books will help you no matter which you choose to read first. As for starting/ending clean, check out some of Daryl's work.   Like previously mentioned by another, Magic and Showmanship by Henning Nelms can help you with presentation. The best way however, is simply by performing as much as you can. You'll see what works and what doesn't, then adjust accordingly. As for appealing to teenagers (or any age group, most tricks/routines can appeal with the right presentation.  But here are some suggestions from the list: With cards, if you want to work more on technique, start with Erdnase or Hugard's work. Erdnase is quite dense, but also humorous at times, which helps when reading. If you want to work on presentation, go with Karl Fulves' Self-Working Card tricks.   As for coins, Bobo's is the perfect place to begin. There's a plethora of gems in there and I refer to it frequently to find ""new"" ideas. Learn each of the sleights (ch. 1) with both hands. That'll help you in the long run."
Magic,3duldn,rmangaha,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:03:25 2015 UTC,"Two superb recommendations here. Daryl is a fantastic teacher and somehow makes everything seem totally achievable.   I also cannot stress the importance of presentation enough and so I also give two thumbs up to Magic and Showmanship by Nelms. Presentation is what elevates a trick to a piece of theatre. It may seem like some heavy thinking now because like me, at first you may just want to learn as many tricks as you can. But starting to give importance to showmanship will reward you exponentially in the long run. It is the secret to better fee's and more prestigious and high profile clients. Give each trick the work it dedication it deserves before moving on to the next.  Best of luck and enjoy the journey my friend!"
Magic,3duldn,Robert_B_Marks,2,Tue Jul 21 17:15:58 2015 UTC,"What I am reading in your post is not a lack of material or magic. Instead your problem seems to be that you just don't want to ""be like everyone else."" Truthfully, you will probably NEVER get what you want out of a book, unless it's theory. In which case, you then have to work.""   Second, you've read Tarbell 1. There's 7 more volumes with more magic than you will ever use in your lifetime. There is magic in there nobody has ever performed except Professor Tarbell himself. You could be the one person to perform that effect and make a name for himself performing it.  If your magic feels generic, odds are you're the one making it generic. It's not magic's fault. And that's fine, you'll get better with practice, but you need to know you're generic to begin with and then work towards not being so. I'd try to point you in a particular direction, but it's really an issue only you can answer.  For inspiration, look outside of magic. What kind of music do you like and why? Movies and why? Books and why? What do you enjoy talking about with your friends, and why? All of those why's you end up answering, start putting it into your magic.  Next, learn to tell a story.   Check out this link and this one especially regarding Audience, Intent, and Message.  And lastly, check out this great workbook.  You may be asking what the hell does this have to do with magic? It's everything. Otherwise, you're just doing a demo... and there's nothing wrong with aiming for that either."
Magic,3duldn,peaceandlovehomies,2,Mon Jul 20 03:12:24 2015 UTC,"It suddenly occurs to me that this is a link you should really read: http://shwood.squarespace.com/news/2009/9/21/14-years-ago-the-day-teller-gave-me-the-secret-to-my-career.html  Very good advice from a master magician that can help you be, as you put it, something other than just another teen magician.  Edit: Just to add something about performance and identity...I'm now 38 years old, and I've been writing since I was a teenager.  I'm around 15 years into a writing career (plenty of time for an authorial ""voice"" to develop), and when I moved into magic as a hobby about a year ago, I thought I knew just the kind of magician I would be in performance - I'd take on this persona of the magician who magic hated...as in, ""holding a grudge so that any trick ends up being something different.""  I still have plans to do the first cups and balls trick involving a ransom note as the climax.  As for how much of this identity survived...well, it's a year later, and I'm still using playing cards.  That's it.  The occasional comic trick still stays in my head for when I want to be a bit silly, but I'm much more interested in magic as poetry.  Your performing style will develop on its own.  So long as you know who you are (and speaking as somebody who probably has at least 20 years on you, who you are now will possibly be very different than who you are in your 30s...but everybody goes through that), and you develop the essential skill and sound foundations, what makes your performance you will emerge.  Just give it time and practice, and remember that skill is the conduit for art."
Magic,3duldn,Robert_B_Marks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:45:54 2015 UTC,"Probably irrelevant, but as you mentioned cups and balls and a note - are you familiar with Craig Petty's Chop? It's a chop cup routine where you can use a borrowed cup and borrwed note as the ball (and still do chop cup moves) - I don't think it's necessarily any better than a traditional chop cup, but it allows for some interesting routines. The highlight (compared with a chop cup) is being able to place an empty face down cup on the spectators hand and they can feel the ball/note appear on their hand.  It also teaches a method to bill to lemon (used as the climax) if you don't currently have a method."

Expert coin technique will continue your education card sleights. Bobo's Modern Coin Magic will get you more well rounded. But this free ebook will get you making bigger impact with your magic. I read a couple pages every night regardless of whatever other magic media I am consuming.
Magic,3duldn,Ragesome,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:34:50 2015 UTC,"Bobo has some problems with it, and the material feels dated when you read it but the first time you see someone actually perform material out of Bobo well it can definitely sell you on it.    But as is, the use of sleeving, handkerchiefs and assumptions you're wearing shirts and coats can make it feel so irrelevant.  I recently bought Al Schneider's videos from L&L and he does a number of things straight out of Modern Coin Magic and it was clean and powerful stuff."

Magic,3dpx8s,seaneihm,6,Sat Jul 18 17:31:55 2015 UTC,Not everyone like him.   Some people are annoyed he repeatedly lies about faking demos for his magic releases.
Magic,3dpx8s,mrgoatypoos,2,Sat Jul 18 20:59:59 2015 UTC,That part was annoying. He used duplicate signatures in the trailer of a magic product he well selling... Now while that isn't the worse thing in the world... He blatantly lied about it when questioned on a forum. He later came back and apologized about lying to everyone.   Personally I think it's in the past and I believe he learned from his mistakes.
Magic,3dpx8s,BrundageMagic,3,Sat Jul 18 21:23:32 2015 UTC,There's no way he did a few of the transfers without a  dupe in that FISM performance.   But that being said good for him. He's blowing up right now.
Magic,3dpx8s,Mattszat913,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:59:23 2015 UTC,"It is unlikely that he did anything that would be considered ""cheating"" at FISM. He'd be crucified out of a career if the judges and presenters even suspected it. And they certainly wouldn't be accomplices.   In Shin's usual style, he will eventually sell the routine and then we'll know what method he used. In one comment he said he plans on it.  At this point, this discussion reminds of when ""experts"" insisted that the only way Yif could have made that bread appear was through mirrors and camera trickery. Then a video came out of him presenting the same trick on stage (unfortunately) showing the actual mechanism that was neither mirrors nor camera tricks, and there was no reason for the audience to be ""in on it.""  It's usually a good idea to shy away from statements about magic that begin with ""the only way this could..."""
