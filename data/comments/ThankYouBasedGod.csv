Frank Ocean of Odd Future mentions quotes from Lil B in the actual notes on Channel Orange too (the same ones where he came out as bi) http://frankocean.tumblr.com/post/26473689116/basedgod-was-right I don't know about the rest of OF I feel like maybe Domo also fucks with him but I can't remember any specific tweets.

ThankYouBasedGod,33c9ie,Sardonapalus,41,Tue Apr 21 10:29:35 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing, Lil B doesn't ask to be interpreted in any particular way. The subtle brilliance of his music lies in its ability to appeal to a broad range of people -- from ultra-critical music intelligentsia to casual listeners. One can simultaneously enjoy the satirical aspect of his songs and the beats that affect us in a very primal way. Thinking individuals will appreciate this multifaceted approach, while the average joe simply appreciates the hardness.  So when you write a post like this, it doesn't come across as a guy who ""gets it."" Rather, it appears as though you are seeking validation for recognizing something that 99% of the people in this sub already know. The reality is that people are going to celebrate Lil B in the same way he celebrates life: joyously, lightheartedly, satirically, and hilariously. By drawing a distinction between what you refer to as ""suburban guys"" and aficionados, perhaps it is you that doesn't understand. I suggest you reflect on the subject further and pray to the Based God so that your transgressions may be forgiven."

ThankYouBasedGod,33c9ie,woody20,6,Tue Apr 21 12:38:28 2015 UTC,"I'm so tired of discussion of Lil B being dominated by people who probably don't even listen to hip hop much normally, and who have little to no knowledge that would help them understand why he is probably one of the most influential and unique musicians out right now. Nobody is more modern. Lil B represents everything about modern music and pop culture that is particularly unique to contemporary times, i.e. his tireless work ethic and output of work being necessary to stay relevant to the ever-shortening attention span of consumers of popular culture, the good-natured absurdism and trollery that typifies comedy to this current generation of adolescents as compared to the irony embraced by my generation (I'm just shy of 30) and the cynicism more typical of the generation before mine. There is so much that is actually important to discuss about him and his career and influence that gets drowned out by the over-celebration of the corny meme bullshit. I know this post is going to be inundated with ""based god fucked your bitch"" responses, but if there is anybody reading this that understands what I mean, who knows that to the lifelong hip hop aficionado/connoisseur it just doesn't get any more entertaining than Lil B, who maybe even with extensive knowledge of rap lyric tropes and a sense of humor about the sillier aspects of the genre has had Eureka moments that came about due to B pointing something out (i.e. how he made me realize how god damn retarded the lines describing the way in which a rapper is ""switching lanes"" are when you think about them, or Lil B's arbitrary quantification of pretty much EVERYTHING making me realize how hilarious yet strangely integral this particular kind of braggadocio are to the rap lyricist, then hit me up. Ok suburban guys who only like B and Eminem when it comes to rap, go ahead and proceed to tell me about Based God fucking my bitch or me being ""fakebased."" ""Regulators"" was the first song I ever heard to blow my god damn mind when I w as 8 years old jumping on my friend's trampoline. I remember stopping jumping and standing as still as I could to hear the music that made me feel a way that I had never felt before, goosebumps and skin flushing euphorically...I remember it so very clearly. Now I'm a musician making beats and playing blues guitar like a badass, and thinking about how impactful this memory is makes me so happy, and Lil B is one of a handful of modern rappers that even makes me feel anywhere close to that day. But anyways yeah, tell me about how I'm fakebased, then post in r/makinghiphop asking how you can achieve that ""Tyler the Creator"" super slow-mo vocal effect."

ThankYouBasedGod,33c9ie,alvydavis,7,Tue Apr 21 11:37:03 2015 UTC,"I think what people fail to realize about Lil b is you have to actually work and respect all of his work to realize his brilliance. What I mean is you have to wade though the ""bull shit"" or goofy tracks to get to the meaningful stuff. The shell is there to wash away the people who won't put the effort in to find the beauty aka fake based. This is what people who just scratch the surface miss about him, you have to work to get the real art, the people that just listen to the meme tracks are fake based and the ones shouting ""based god fucked your bitch lol"" but if you really apriciate and stick with his music you discover the beauty.   I agree with op I get a little ticked off when people write him off as just a meme when they haven't put in the effort to really hear what he has to say."

I wouldn't really call myself a rap fan but definitely a fan of progressive music (yes, rush, btbam), classic rock, and post punk like the clash and talking heads. Without really being a fan of rap, the first time I heard Lil B i immediately understood it. The dude's a genius. It's like a form or satire so subtle that it could completely fly over your head and be mistaken for a regular rap song. Wish I had more to contribute from a hip-hop perspective, but either way the dude's a genius. I love the serious Lil B gems hidden out there. I believe his freestyles unleash a part of the inner psyche that any ego driven rapper would be afraid to talk about. Lil B is fearless. TYBG."

I'd love to discuss this further if you're interested, because I was just thinking about this today.  I was thinking too about how Weezer is also similar to Lil B and Ariel Pink lyrically in many ways, which may sound odd to some, but if you know the rock or rap genre's so well that you view them through a sociological impact/critical viewpoint then the trends they signify lyrically make a strong argument for what we can discern about the progression of art in popular culture."

If you like his thug shit listen to Blue Flame, Green Flame, #1 Bitch, Bitch Mob Respect Da Bitch Vol 1, 100% Gutta, and Crime Fetish. For more of his serious cloud rap work, listen to Illusions of Grandeur, Glass face, I Forgive You, and Obama Basedgod. Hope this helps #TaskForce."

ThankYouBasedGod,2zv7q0,dagoff,8,Sun Mar 22 02:23:39 2015 UTC,"There's really no telling what B's up to, pretty sure he is involved with a lot more than we know. He's probably helping a city official plan something or maybe he's been hanging out with the sac town mayor? Who knows? Maybe B and KD are figuring out their next move for the public?  Maybe Thugged Out Pissed Off is finished and he's conjuring up something major and unexpected and will blow our minds? Maybe he's been working on a project with Kanye? There is so much more to B than meets the eye and I believe that it's about to be seen"

ThankYouBasedGod,2zv7q0,cunderthunt69,2,Sun Mar 22 22:22:03 2015 UTC,I think he's been busy doing lectures. I'm sure he's also working hard on Thugged Out Pissed Off.

ThankYouBasedGod,2zv7q0,abezzilla99,3,Fri Mar 27 00:38:38 2015 UTC,I think you're all forgetting about how Lil B lost hours worth of music when his apartment complex caught fire a few months back I wouldn't be surprised if he had to remake or restart Thugged Out Pissed Off in this period his material has been better with more of a wait this past year so I'm expecting fire
ThankYouBasedGod,2zv7q0,peppersmith67,6,Mon Mar 23 12:59:44 2015 UTC,"Personally I think part of why Thugged Out Pissed Off is taking so long is because, when you look at the quality (recording-wise) of, say, 6-Kiss, compared to Hoop Life, it's getting a lot better, so I'm sure he's been spending more time in the studio mixing and mastering.   He also posted that pic with Frank Ocean awhile ago, so maybe there are some more features that he's waiting on, or maybe his schedule is getting complicated with all these glorious lectures he's been working on, as well as the unfortunate fire he had to deal with. That can take a lot out of someone, so I'm sure he's had a lot on his plate.  TOPO is going to be a masterpiece though if his latest material is any indication (just look at his verse on Rolling Stone... absolute fuego)."

ThankYouBasedGod,2x1gmp,sawalrath,26,Tue Feb 24 22:16:17 2015 UTC,"You know thank you for asking this question, yes thank you.  A few years ago I was lacking for cash, as I recently became unemployed from a minor dispute with a fellow employee and it put me  on the streets.  I had my clothes, my phone, a charger, and a suitcase with the rest of some assorted items and no where to turn.  I was considering taking a bus back to LA where I'm from, but I knew there was still something here in Oakland. What I didn't know was where my next meal was coming from.  I walked out of my building for the last time and walked around to the corner to a local fast food joint but it was only right before it was my turn at the cashier did I realize I couldn't pay.  Right there and then I knew I had to make a choice: do I steal the food? heck, could I even do that? Or do I walk out; look through the trash; get on  my knees and beg? I was looking up and down the menu seeing what the cheapest thing there was to buy and a tear came down from my eye.  I was defeated.  I was over. Then I heard a voice  Yes yes a wonderful voice  He said ""My friend, why are you crying?"" I opened up my eyes to find this harmonious harpy, this gallant graceful gleaming soul who decided to stop and talk to a young troglodyte like myself.  I looked left I looked right all I could see was the quiescent queue, each man and woman ready to order their meal and continue playing their part as a rotating cog in the machine of our society.  I looked down and I looked up and that's where I saw him.  He looked at me, and he looked so happy.  I said, ""I have nothing.  Who are you?"" He smiled and said ""ahhhh my friend... I am the Based God! yes yes!!""  and I could hear the music.  A choir sung his words with a divine delicacy, the violins echoed into eternity the rhythm and movement of the Based God, fulfilling my soul and maximizing the potential of the ability of living!  Every cell and neutron in my body tingled: I felt like I could fly! The Based God was here and he was my friend, his words sunk through the gaps of my pores and into my heart, and I became a new man; enlightened.  He said let me help you here and that was when I realized the heavenly hunk I thought to be a vivid hallucination was nothing of the sort, he was a mortal man standing still in front of me.  I stood still in a state of torpor and watched him cook up a feast for me and all of the people in the restaurant.  They closed the store and all we all ate like kings with the Based God, because he was our friend and must be protected, yes.  From that day I realized my purpose.  With a new vigor I had no idea existed within me I rebuilt my life from the bottom up and I now live happily.  What was my secret for success; my elixir for excellence?  I listened to the Based God everyday, because every word he speaks drips with the depth of the ocean with love and peace, and I know if everyone followed in this practice, all wars would end, all animals will speak, and all rocks will be nice.  That is why I listen to the Lil B.  Because he put me back on my feet and I have faith in his cooking."
ThankYouBasedGod,2x1gmp,the_ezra,-1,Tue Feb 24 23:09:05 2015 UTC,Cogs don't rotate they revolve you ignorant fuck. People like you make me sick.
ThankYouBasedGod,2x1gmp,senorkevino,7,Wed Feb 25 12:11:28 2015 UTC,Because I enjoy it a lot. I think it's mad funny.
ThankYouBasedGod,2x1gmp,Redrot,5,Wed Feb 25 02:12:14 2015 UTC,"Lil B has a little bit of everything I love, and massive collection of music to explore. He has his mixtapes like Basedworld Paradise that make me incredibly happy and based, and when I listen to it I just wanna hug my dogs! And then he has rare tapes like God's Father, and every time I hear ""I Own Swag"" it reminds me that the mighty Basedgod can actually rap circles around anybody in the game And he has tapes like Obama Basedgod where he tackles world issues and spreads information and positivity. No other artist has ever made me cry just with the pure beauty of their words (Age Of Information), but then minutes later made me wanna cook up a top-notch master chef meal (Ski Ski Basedgod). Lil B truly understands what it means to be human and I'm blessed to be alive right now and to have the opportunity to watch the Basedgod grow and develop as an artist and as a person. Amen🙏"
ThankYouBasedGod,2x1gmp,LiterallyABlunt,4,Wed Feb 25 03:28:36 2015 UTC,"The first time I heard Lil B, I was skeptical.  I remember seeing ""Wonton Soup"" on MTV late at night and I thought it wasn't that great.  I never listened to him much after that until about a year and a half ago when I found out my best friend's brother loved him.  He told me Lil B was a motivational speaker and his lyrics were actually deeper than what they seem.  I gave him a second chance downloading more recent mixtapes as well as some of his older ones as well.  Since then I really grew to appreciate the artist that is Lil B.  I can see that he is a true artist at heart that wants to make music to speak to everyone, and it has spoken to me.  The inspirational songs along with the hard hitting songs are all great.  I have since then downloaded every mixtape I can find and am finding myself just waiting for him to release the next.  He has become one of my favorite artists and I respect everything that he does.  TYBG"
ThankYouBasedGod,2x1gmp,gnewton17,3,Wed Feb 25 05:08:15 2015 UTC,Because Lil B music makes me a better person
ThankYouBasedGod,2x1gmp,Jokorare,2,Wed Feb 25 09:15:40 2015 UTC,"hmm.  i like how he tries new things. i like how he implements older legends/waves/genres/styles. i guess i just identify with lil b's music coming where im from, and gone through what i've gone through. i also like that b is unafraid and honest. i thought this would be easy to answer, but it's so many levels to based music."
