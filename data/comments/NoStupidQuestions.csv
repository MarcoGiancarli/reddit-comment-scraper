Maybe you think your part is to serve honorably in the military - good for you.  Maybe you think your part is to be a conscientious objector and work hard to end the war.  That's legitimate too.  But if you pull shenanigans (or strings) to avoid service and then spend your time partying instead of doing something meaningful, then that reflects selfishness and an unwillingness to help others."

Trump's ""bone spur"" argument is, on its face, acceptable, but the problem is that people don't trust him, and wonder if this was a legitimate reason for him to get a deferal. Did he play by the rules?  Ultimately it's about fairness. The draft was supposed to apply to everyone equally, and Americans get very touchy about people pulling strings to avoid the draft. During the Civil War, for example, both the Union and the Confederacy instituted the draft, but it was relatively easy for rich people in the Confederacy to hire substitutes. Hence the slogan, ""Rich man's war, poor man's fight."" There was a sense that rich men had started the war but they were forcing poor people to do all the dying."

Many people in the U.S. supported the Vietnam War, and were dismayed that it pulled out in the 1970s, leading to its immediate rule by communists.  Second, there's a pattern of people who did not serve in any military capacity in their 20s who are extremely militaristic years later, when they are not in personal danger.  This is hypocritical, and these people are sometime termed chickenhawks.  Rush Limbaugh apparently got one for an easily-operated-on cyst.  There are many, many other examples from the Vietnam War."

I dunno, West Country and Cornish, and if you grow up in the States you'll recognise the difference between Texas and Southern.  For people whose main exposure to the accents of another country is that country's media (with no context and no-one to really provide context), recognising those differences and maintaining a single accent from that country can be difficult.  It's why most Americans sound weird if they try almost anything but RP, and why most Brits sound weird if they try for an American accent.  And it's not just mixing up bits of accent from different parts of the country; it's also mixing up words and phrases from differing areas (for the Americans, think of 'you guys' vs 'youse guys' vs 'y'all' vs 'you folks', sub vs hoagie vs hero, soda vs pop vs Coke, etc)."

While I lived there, an American woman tourist came into the store that I worked in, and was telling me how Irish people dress so differently than Americans. And that I needed to go to America to see the differences. And that Florida, where she was from (and where my mother was from), was even more different.  Man, the girls I worked with were cracking up at that one. That I, obviously American to ALL Irish people, would be thought of as Irish! And all my American friends say ""Wow, your accent is SO STRONG"" when I come back from a trip.  The boys have lost their accents now that we're back in the US.

There was some form of time line involved such as adopt it in under six months or a year, but I also don't recall this detail. So it would seem if you lived in areas with differing accents in your young years, probably pretty quickly.  On a more anecdotal note, a female friend married a Brit and sounded like a right Brit within six months of moving there. Another friend met a Brit while there for six months for work. She came back with him and they married here six months later.

Near the ocean it's a very maritime climate; there is no sudden change with latitude.  Elevation changes have a bigger effect. Along the Peninsula, even a few hundred meters of elevation gain can mean the difference between melting and freezing cold. The combination of moving away from the ocean and to a higher altitude cause the Antarctic Plateau to be bitter cold."

The reasoning behind this is as follows - for the infinite monkey theorem, all the monkeys have to do is bash the keys.  No actual thought or unnatural (from their behaviour standpoint) behaviour is required to by chance create the works of shakespeare.  Whereas, as the other comment points out, for beavers to be able to create the Eiffel tower - for one they would have to change their behaviour and actually create their dams vertically with unnatural and unneeded spaces between them.  Beavers build dams for protection as well as easy access to food.  Two they would have to learn or know constructions methods to allow them to create a structure that survives.  An Eiffel tower dam would fail miserably at either of these purposes.  Therefore, it would go against natural beaver behaviour to create it.  That being said, if infinite beaver theorem takes into account infinite generations of beavers as well - we may see evolution take place and allow beavers to actually change their habits in order to lead to a production of the Eiffel tower."
NoStupidQuestions,3e3kxf,XeverSeven,3,Tue Jul 21 18:13:34 2015 UTC,In a manual you should do neither. Coasting with the engine engaged is much safer as you retain control of the vehicle - the engine controls the speed and you can quickly speed up if you need to. Here in the UK you can fail your driving test for doing it too much.

NoStupidQuestions,3e3kxf,mirozi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:41:46 2015 UTC,"You should do neither as long as the rpm are above a certain limit. Your engine has a overrun cut-off. As long as your wheels drive the engine, it will use zero fuel. Only if the rpm fall below a certain treshold (1100-1500 depending on the model) the engine will inject fuel to not get stalled.  And its better to never keep the clutch depressed. Disengage, shift (to neutral or another gear) and engage it. Keeping the clutch depressed adds wear on the release bearing asnd shortens the lifetime of the clutch. To be honest, this is nothing you will notice if you drive a car 3 or 5 years, but since you asked..."
NoStupidQuestions,3e3kxf,Natanael85,0,Tue Jul 21 19:38:30 2015 UTC,"There is no difference.  If the clutch is down, the transmission is not engaged.  If you do shift it into neutral, you can then let off the clutch to make it easier on your foot, but there is no difference mechanically."
NoStupidQuestions,3e3kxf,lukistke,4,Tue Jul 21 18:28:23 2015 UTC,"These things are not the same mechanically. Neutral means there's power coming in from the engine to the gearbox but not going out to the wheels, and when engaging the clutch you are disconnecting the gearbox from the engine using the flywheel. Better explained here. And to answer op: if you're stopping completely (red light/stop sign etc) it's less wear on the clutch if you pop into neutral. If you're just coasting it's better to use the clutch as you have more control over the car. Sorry for lengthy answer"
NoStupidQuestions,3e3kxf,sivi123,2,Tue Jul 21 19:27:53 2015 UTC,"There is one small difference mechanically speaking. With the clutch in you're putting wear and tear on your throwout bearing. Those bearings aren't really designed to be engaged for long periods of time. Whether you're coasting (not really the best idea, leave it in gear) or at a red light you should have your transmission in neutral with your foot off the clutch."

NoStupidQuestions,3e31lu,realised,2,Tue Jul 21 16:13:16 2015 UTC,"Don't be scared!  Seriously - well okay be scared but don't be intimidated. =)    Best jobs to have in college are something to do with your career.  For example, if you are going into Biology - ask profs if they are looking for research assistants in their labs.    Always start by asking your professors, because working with them not only pads your resume nicely but also helps in your coursework.  If there are no jobs available as such, most universities have a on-campus job fair / listing website.  Check it out!  In fact, start checking out the job listings as soon as you are accepted to the college/university you want to go to.  Start applying right then too for the ones you can.  Don't hestitate to take jobs that are different - housekeeping jobs are awesome for students because they tend to be at off-hours and good pay.  Same with security jobs.  They may not pad your resume, but they provide a nice income.  Take Resident Assistant positions are great too - I will warn you though, this is a tough job.  These individuals basically have to be the ""police/ombudsperson"" for residence dwellers.  So you can either get hated (most likely you will be) or be loved.  Probably a mix of both if you do your job well.  But they also pay well, and show you to be responsible.  First year - honestly just find any job and do it.  Toss the money into an account, use a small portion of it as allowance. (like 90% savings 10% allowance - that way it doesn't seem like all work and you get a reward!)  Second year, start asking profs if they have work you can do, even if it is just volunteer work - continue with your first year job at the same time.  Third year onwards, try to put more emphasis towards jobs that are relevant to your field, this is because companies will consider applicants especially recent graduates who have experience in the field over those who do not.  Finally - enjoy yourself.  Remember to take breaks and have time for yourself and friends.  College/University is an experience as much as it is work - if you burn out burning the candle at both ends, it won't be good for anybody.  So, don't overexert yourself! =)  Edit: Also don't be afraid to take jobs off-campus too; just be careful about the commute and such as if you are commuting a fair bit to get to your job and back it can get difficult.  There are also often times good opportunities available there as well.  Such as university affiliated businesses and such.  Or even retail!"

NoStupidQuestions,3e2wkj,SJHillman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:49:52 2015 UTC,It was probably due to the truck's air brakes failing. They are designed so that when they lose pressure the brakes engage so you don't have a runaway truck every time brakes fail.  The 'steam' you saw was from a pressurized gas (probably just air) returning to atmospheric pressure. When a gas goes from high pressure to low pressure it drops in temperature quite significantly. This drop in temperature caused water in the air to condense which is what you saw.  Tl;Dr: What you saw was the same thing as a cloud in the sky.

In North America the average adult weighs 180 lbs and an abortion is typically defined as having the fetus be less than 500g (1 lb), so that scales to about 2.5 lbs of CO2 per aborted fetus.  In the US there were 1.1 million abortions in 2011 and it looks like we're on pace for a similar number this year according to www.numberofabortions.com . So as a rough estimate, the US produces 2.8 million lbs (1270 metric tons) of CO2 disposing of aborted fetuses (assuming disposal is always cremation).   As a comparison, a single person flying from JFK to LAX produces .58 tonnes of CO2, so the total abortion carbon footprint would be equal to about 5 cross country flights of 500 people. This is also the equivalent to the yearly carbon output of 330 cars.  Man my search history looks fuckin' weird."

Gun:  It might've been possible for Roman blacksmiths to make a simple matchlock musket, but since gunpowder hadn't been invented they wouldn't be able to use it. Watch: If you're talking a mechanical watch with gears, they could've made a scaled-up version that probably wouldn't keep time as well, but the Romans didn't have the technology to make something small enough to fit on your wrist, or precise to keep time over several days.

Would it still work if they're a little too springy, or not springy enough, because the Romans couldn't figure out what material they're made out of?   How much would scaling up the pieces, or changing the material they're made of, change the accuracy of the mechanism? Would adding more mass to the gears slow them down?

We would pay them, maybe $500 up front, and promise to pay them more if they helped us instead of helping the Taliban.

Did we still pay people just because we thought they were maybe possibly trying to do the right thing, even if they might have been scamming us? We probably did. Because we really were trying to help in any way we could (building schools, teaching adults to read and write, creating jobs for the locals, giving food and water, and clearing the roads so people could travel and make a living buying and selling or whatever else they saw fit) -- as Soldiers even if we didn't agree with being in Afghanistan we do tend to believe in the American Dream and being a servant to the people.

For example, the families of Palestinian terrorists (especially suicide bombers) are paid in perpetuity by the Palestinian Authority and/or by Hamas.  Before the Second Iraq War, Saddam's regime also had a set amount of money he would pay Palestinian terrorists and their families based upon a number of factors.  Currently. Iran is the largest financial backer of Hamas and has reinstated money transfer to pay Hamas salaries since the nuclear deal was struck (they suspended transfers when they were cash struck).  Hezbollah is also a huge employer of Lebanese men and their income comes both from Iranian support and by their involvement illicit trade around the world.  Hezbollah is known to be involved in weapons procurement, the drug trade, and stolen goods in countries such as Canada.  I could go on and on to describe the financial situation of other terrorist groups such as the FARC, Irish terrorist groups, and the many other AQ and IS affiliated terrorist groups around the world, but I'd just be giving the same answer over and over again - yes, terrorist groups do pay their terrorists.  Edit: I should also make note that I am aware of other terrorist groups that specifically do not pay their members. For example, the leftist Palestinian terrorist group PFLP specifically chose not to pay or receive monetary compensation for their activity, as they viewed themselves as altruistic leftists"

TIVO and cable company DVRs even report when you go back and watch a commercial longer. It's extremely valuable for their ad targeting (since they also know who you are, what your household looks like, etc).  As mentioned previously though - first party data is really only useful for local ad insertion, anything bigger has to come through trusted 3rd party groups like Nielsen"

More info on Nielsen in another comment (from an actual Nielsen employee, better than what I would know).  Channel changes are mostly useful as a measure of how often you are ""engaged"" with your TV - that is are you watching it actively vs. just having it on in the background. When coupled with other information, they can tell advertisers when you're home and what you watch (as a household), as well as other information (like did you start channel surfing during commercials).   These days DVR stats are by far the most accurate (coupled with streaming stats from Hulu / OnDemand) for determining overall reach of a show, but stats on how many people watched live are still usually Nielsen."

NoStupidQuestions,3dyizi,WattsTolleDass,6,Tue Jul 21 06:27:35 2015 UTC,"This is a very interesting question.  After doing some quick research, the answer is still maybe?  Depending on the system that whatever program you are using collects viewership data.  For example, there are three methods:   Diaries - viewers actually fill out a diary of what they watched and viewership is based on that.  So, in this case, even if your cable box was on and you were not watching it - it wouldn't count as a view. Nielson rating - this one is interesting, as it uses diaries as well as meters to measure viewership.  The device would be connected to their TV, measuring what channels are being watched and when a channel is switched etc.  At a certain time (generally night) the data would be transmitted to be analysed and collated.  In your example, this would be a ""maybe"" scenario.  As if the device was connected to the cable box and not the TV - it would register as a Yes. Software - since DVR was introduced into the market, it became difficult to assess viewership as somebody could have their DVR record a show and watch it later.  This led to creation of software meters.  In this scenario, it is a bit more questionable whether it would be a Yes or No - I believe that if the software was located in the cable box - it would be a yes.  If it was located on the TV, it would be a no.  The software may also be able to recognise when the TV is off and still be on the cable box also making it a No.   There is another method called ""global television audience metering"" which I cannot find enough information on to comment. =(  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience_measurement"

NoStupidQuestions,3dyizi,slizzler,3,Tue Jul 21 05:47:06 2015 UTC,"This is actually one of the many issues with set-top box data. Most companies that provide this data for advertisers will have their own algorithms to control for this. For example, after a certain amount of time with no channel switches, the data is no longer included. Some providers go even further. For example, I have Verizon. When I haven't used the remote after a certain amount of time a message will pop up telling me it will go into sleep mode if I don't hit the okay button. Presumably, at this point Verizon is no longer counting my set-top box as a viewer for that channel.  Even with those controls, if you're in the business and deal with the data hands on, it's not odd to see some screwy things. Companies are always tweaking their algorithms to get either more accurate results, or (more likely) easier to sell results. For example, I once saw a claim that a company could provide consistent viewers (meaning they watch the entire program and see all commercial breaks, no channel flipping) and their example was... Inkmasters at 3am. Are there really that many people loyally watching all of Inkmasters at 3am, or did they go to sleep?  So, in short, if you turn your tv off but leave the cable box on, you will likely be counted as a viewer for a brief amount of time by your cable provider (not Nielsen, for reasons others have covered. Though they are moving into the set-top box arena.) Eventually various companies who work with the data will weed you out."

NoStupidQuestions,3dxy3g,RBMC,47,Mon Jul 20 16:50:43 2015 UTC,"There's scientific support for the idea that the human brain sees tools as an extension of the body.  Nothing proven or widely-accepted yet, but it's an idea that's out there.  If that is the case, then that, along with the opposable thumb, are two of humanity's biggest advantages over the rest of the animal kingdom, and are what led our species out of the trees to become great hunters, then farmers, then builders, etc.  So think of using a hammer to drive nails into wood.  When you first start, the hammer is an unwieldy object, and you probably spend more time damaging the nails, and your fingers, then actually successfully hammering in a nail.  But after some practice, you start to get a ""feel"" for the hammer.  When the hammer strikes the head of the nail, it feels like you're the one hitting the nail, though what's actually happening is that the shockwaves travel down the hammer and into your hand.  You get a sense for the hammer's size and weight.  You start to feel like you can be as accurate with the hammer as you can with your own two hands.  The hammer now feels like it's part of you.  Or to use another example, video games.  When you first start you're very conscious of the buttons you are pressing.  If you're playing Super Mario Bros. on the NES, and want Mario to jump, you push A.  If you want Mario to run, you have to hold B and push RIGHT.  But once you get used to having the controller in your hand, your brain stops being consciously aware of what your hands are doing.  If you want Mario to jump, you just make him jump, and he does.  You don't get the same tactile feedback that you do with the hammer, but you do get a springy sound.  Newer games introduce tactile feedback in the form of rumble.  When you peel out in GTA V, you don't feel the controller rumbling in your hands, you feel the tires dragging across the pavement.  So I don't know if any of this would apply to a foam #1 finger, I've never used one.  But by wearing the foam finger, you mentally picture yourself as actually doing the #1 sign, so I suspect you may actually feel like you are doing the #1 sign despite your hand being flat.  You view the foam finger as an extension of your body, so you become less conscious of what your real hand is doing.  That might all be bullshit, but your question was amusing and I felt it deserved at least an attempt at a real answer."

You can see a similar idea in old anti-suffragette imagery. Cats represented the domestic sphere (and being disobedient) as well as women in general.    The association between cats and women has been made for a very long time, and those who were anti-suffrage drew a connection between women wanting the vote and not being womanly enough- being ugly and unlovable. Over time it seems to have morphed into the stereotype that lonely women get cats, and that people who have cats only do so because they're lonely women or effeminate men. The idea that single women are crazy is also an old one, of course.   It's rooted in a very old idea."

As far as ignorance goes, my main suggestion would be to gauge how you react when presented with new information that challenges your opinions. Do you dismiss it outright as not possibly true? Do you not change your view but make a note that there is some evidence of the other side? Do you sometimes go and try to review the actual evidence you have for your side and see if it holds up as well as you previously thought? You want to be aiming for these latter things.   If you're interested in having well-informed opinions, you might want to check out the rationalist community. The writings of Scott Alexander and Eliezer Yudkowsky on LessWrong might be good places to start."

If you're already familiar with some of these concepts, congrats, you're further along than you thought!)  The fact that you even ask yourself this question is a sign of curiosity and a desire for self-knowledge. Those traits alone boost you into the top 25% of thinkers. But don't get comfortable.  An ignorant person is someone who doesn't know things that 'should' be common knowledge. As you can imagine, we're all ignorant about something. The best you can do is consume knowledge about subjects you care about, and ask questions about things that confuse you. Become a habitual Wiki-er and Google-er and Youtube-er and Google Image-er. Then, being confronted with your own ignorance won't be embarrassing, but exciting, because it's a chance to learn.  A stupid person doesn't think. It doesn't occur to them that they'll never fully understand another person's experience or know what it's like to be them. They don't stop to question why something is; they form an opinion about it and stand on that for the rest of their lives. But again, we all do this, mostly because constantly re-evaluating every single one of our beliefs would be exhausting. So learn to rethink your beliefs when certain triggers come up, such as when they upset others, or make your life harder.  I'm going to list some of my favorite resources below. But if you have to choose a single thread to search for in all of them, I hope you decide on compassion. Of all the perspectives and philosophies I've explored so far, it's the one that's boosted my well-being the most. It increases patience, kindness, and inner peace. I can't fully explain the meaning of 'compassion' here, because it's intensely personal and has to be felt out over the course of years. I just love to think about you looking for it.  Okay, resources. I suggest consuming these in small bites, a video/article or two a day, to give yourself something to think about.

If your intent when you went to the drive thru was to take the wrong meal in the first place and the fast food worker asks if you were the one who ordered the Double Quarter Pounder meal and you take it anyway because you planned to pull a bait & switch anyway, then you have committed grand theft fast food.  However, this crime would be hard to prove and would be a huge inconvenience for the fast food place to shut down the restaurant, call the police, and file criminal charges for grand theft fast food and result in loss of revenue for the time the place is shut down.  Luckily, fast food places have installed cameras at the drive thru line to match cars with orders. Workers are now increasingly confirming orders before giving it to you. They know that giving out the wrong food costs time and money for them.  So the point I'm making is don't be that asshole who knowingly takes the wrong order.

Here is how Theft Of Services is defined in my state, Oregon   § 164.125¹  Theft of services  (1) A person commits the crime of theft of services if:  (a) With intent to avoid payment therefor, the person obtains services that are available only for compensation, by force, threat, deception or other means to avoid payment for the services; or   So. If you have ordered Burger A (which costs 5$) And they ask you ""did you order burger B"" (which costs 10$) And you lie on purpose because you know that burger B is tastier and more expensive.

NoStupidQuestions,3e1mf0,Apocalypsze,4,Tue Jul 21 06:56:29 2015 UTC,"What could cause so many ants to enter my house in such a short period?   Ants leave an invisible chemical trail when they leave their nest. This lets them ""sniff"" their way home, but it also allows other ants in the colony to follow the trail. If one ant makes it to your house and finds whatever it is he was looking for (food, probably), he can signal to the rest of the colony that he's found it and they can follow his chemical trail right to your house. The food he finds, if that's what he found, doesn't have to be much. It could just have been some crumbs swept under the stove or fridge.  Another option is that they're some sort of ant that burrows into wood and they found your house to be a suitable location to set up shop.  You might want to have an exterminator come out and have a look around. If you can trap a couple of ants for the exterminator to look at then he can probably identify them for you and will have a better idea of how to handle the problem.   Are ants deadly to dogs or cats if my pets happen to eat a few while I'm at work?   No ant is dangerous to eat as far as I know. If they were stinging ants of some sort, which is probably very unlikely, then the danger would be from that. Most ants you're likely to encounter are probably pretty harmless unless they have a strong bite and if that's the case then one bite from an ant and your pets would probably leave them alone."

NoStupidQuestions,3e1z7k,mushroomstix,5,Tue Jul 21 09:49:19 2015 UTC,The latter. The audio is recorded then the animation is matched to it.
NoStupidQuestions,3e1z7k,SandyRegolith,-2,Tue Jul 21 12:31:05 2015 UTC,"It depends on the show. It's probably most common to do the former - the animation is all there, and the actors do their best to fit it. In some things, like dubbed anime, this can be very noticeable as an actor tries to match the lips (often leading to comically fast and staccato voiceovers). On the other hand, every once in a while a show will do things the other way around. It's a bit more natural and allows more freedom for the voice actors to play their roles, but it's hard work for the animators to sync everything just so.  The only show that springs to mind that might do that is Archer. I remember reading that many of the scenes are recorded with all the actors in the room together, which is how they achieve such a natural sound to some of the conversation - actors are actually interrupting each other mid-sentence and talking over one another. I can't recall whether they animate first or not, but given that format of recording I think it's a good candidate for an animated show that animates after audio recording."
NoStupidQuestions,3e1z7k,Mikegrann,4,Tue Jul 21 10:22:34 2015 UTC,This is completely wrong. Dubbing is different to creating the show originally.

As for liquors, I've never heard of a non-alcoholic spirit.  There are a number of non-alcoholic drink mixes (margarita, bloody mary, mudslide, etc.) available.    If you're concerned about using the liquor for cooking, when you cook with it, most of the alcohol burns off pretty quickly, and you're left with the rest of the flavors of the spirit in whatever you're adding it to.    It would be pretty costly to purchase a bottle of liquor and boil off the alcohol to just have the flavors left behind, but it's one way to go about it yourself."

NoStupidQuestions,3dz544,FekketCantenel,2,Mon Jul 20 18:39:31 2015 UTC,"Some wineries make grape juice with their wine grapes. It won't be overly sweet like Welches, but will have a more complex flavor. Non-alcoholic beer exists, but from what I've heard it's pretty gross, but maybe it's improved. I think it's actually ~0.5% alcohol. I've never heard of a non-alcoholic hard liquor. Things like ""rum extract"" exist for baking, but they typically have alcohol in them (but aren't a problem to buy if you're underage, as it's in the baking section).  Where to find it? It depends on where you live. If you're in the USA, each state has different liquor laws. Some states forbid selling non-alcoholic items at a liquor store (so you can't buy sodas or anything there either). If you're near wineries, you could call to see if they have the grape juice. A nicer liquor store might carry that as well.   If there's a particular reason you want to buy this, it might help. Are you underage and cooking? Hosting a party but wanting to be sensitive to alcoholics or other non-drinkers? Just curious?"

NoStupidQuestions,3dy7as,astrawnomore,30,Mon Jul 20 14:35:18 2015 UTC,"They are sometimes considered a binary system, because the barycentre is outside of Pluto. However, since the category of ""dwarf planet"" is pretty new, it seems like they're continuing to use the term ""moon"" for natural satelites of dwarf planets as well as planets, especially since before people knew about the extent of dwarf planets and the Kuiper Belt, Pluto was classified a planet, so there's a hangover of ""Pluto and its moon Charon"". It seems that Pluto and Charon are kind of both - Pluto is still the object that's classified as a dwarf planet, not Charon.  An interesting fact is that Triton, a moon of Neptune, might actually be a dwarf planet that got caught in Neptune's gravity, which may explain why it moves retrograde to Neptune's rotation."

Pluto still dominates that system, though - and there's the important fact that Charon isn't the only object orbiting Pluto - there's also Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. These moons are all much smaller but they are absolutely orbiting Pluto, not Pluto and Charon. So you could call Pluto and Charon a binary system, but at the same time, they're also a dwarf planet and one of its five moons."

The heads tend to carry with it a lot of the flavor of the mash and also have a bit of a bite to it.  The next section is the hearts, which mostly produces an alcohol that is flavorless. The tails section is next, but don't worry about that.  In whisky production the flavor from the heads portion is great because it's grains. But vodka is made with water, sugar and yeast, so that's not a very tasty combination of flavors.  Ideally a vodka will remove the foreshots and the heads portion of the run and only bottle the hearts section, leaving you with very little bite ""like water"" and with that, very little of that yeast flavor.  But making alcohol is expensive. Distilleries are taxed on every drop of alcohol made, including any stuff they throw away. So to offer a cheaper bottle of vodka, more of that heads section is included, and so you get that bite and some of that flavor. The smoother a vodka is, the more of the bad types of alcohol they've removed from the bottling process, which is why a good bottle is more expensive."

NoStupidQuestions,3dxmiv,ilovetoeatpoutine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:28:39 2015 UTC,"I would say mostly marketing, but you can definitely make the argument that games like LoL is a sport.  Personally I don't think it should qualify, but I can make the argument.   To qualify as a sport rather than a game, typically you have to have physical activity and an active defense.  There are obviously large gray areas here, but it's rare that something qualifies as a sport without both of these elements (even then, not everyone will agree).  A good example is golf.  Many people think of golf as a sport (highlights on ESPN etc.) even though there isn't an active defense.    In e-sports you definitely have an active defense, but there is little to no physical activity required by the players.  That is unless you take into consideration that the actual players are the characters in the games.  In a game like starcraft, the physical work that is being done is by the computerized team.  Without that, I don't think you could make a case for it being a sport.  I don't think anyone would argue that Civ5 would qualify as an e-sport because it's turn based and there isn't any actual physical activity by the video game characters."

A little bit more anecdotally, the Kickstarter process is a bit more... revealing for an undertaking which could take years to develop. Asking gamers to invest in your idea requires specifics and they will not be happy if you stray from those specifics.

If your dog was a bonded pair with this other dog, the shelter wouldn't let them be apart. Since they are not a bonded pair, there will probably be no actual physical reprecussions. Yes, your dog will miss his friend, but if you give him a happy home and new things to be friends with he will be okay.  You can't just reintroduce them, because the other dog owner may not approve. You need to respect their opinion.  Ideal situation? You become friends with their owner and let them be friends, but not living together caliber.

NoStupidQuestions,3dxd7x,etevian,81,Mon Jul 20 09:04:56 2015 UTC,"Semen doesn't instantly dissolve in warm liquids, as previous experiments conducted by a friend of mine have shown. So the semen would travel through your blood stream, with vessels becoming wider and wider at first. It will pass through the right atrium, through the right ventricle and then into the pulmonary artery. From there on, vessels will start getting smaller again, until eventually, the semen will get stuck, blocking the blood flow to a part of the lung. This is called a pulmonary embolism, a very serious and potentially lethal condition.   The same thing can happen when you have a large bone fracture and some bone marrow (which is mostly fat) enters the blood stream."

NoStupidQuestions,3dxygf,MereGirl,25,Mon Jul 20 13:21:14 2015 UTC,"A big component is that your example fare is a bit off. The per minute charge for Uber is nowhere near that expensive (it's actually around $0.25 for UberX), it ends up being a relatively small component of the overall trip, and a reasonable amount of traffic will not affect the overall rate too much. Your mileage rate is also a little higher than actual. Overall, that hypothetical trip would cost you $31.28 in San Francisco, and that includes the base fare and other fees. A cab ride would cost you a very similar amount.  The other thing to consider is how exactly do you think taxis come up with their fares? Cause it is almost exactly the same. Taxis use both mileage and time to calculate your fare, albeit slightly differently than Uber does. It's the slight differences in pricing models that make either Uber or taxis cheaper on any particular occasion.  I know you didn't ask this, but it seems a good follow up. I, and many other Uber supporters, will tell you is that the price is not why I prefer Uber. The thing is, Uber is probably more expensive on average but it's the level of service and convenience that gets my business."
NoStupidQuestions,3dxygf,schfourteen-teen,10,Mon Jul 20 14:44:02 2015 UTC,"Could not agree more with the last thing you said. I'm in Minneapolis and the cabs here are horrendous. They are always dirty, dingy and feel like they're going to fall apart. The driver will always tell you that their card reader is broken unless you tell them you only have a card and no cash and then it suddenly ""works"".   It's rare to have a bad experience with an Uber driver but if you do they will take care of it. I had a horrible driver a few weeks ago when I was in Milwaukee and they refunded me for the trip and gave me $10 to use for my next trip. Things like that is why Uber is exponentially better than any cab.   It's also incredibly convenient to have payment all sorted out beforehand and even being able to split the fare with other Uber users if they're riding with you."

If your cab/uber is going slow (threshold speed varies by service) or stopped (stopped at red light, stuck in slow moving traffic, waiting in a drive thru line, waiting for you when you go into a 7-Eleven, etc), then you are being charged by the minute.  To review, you are ONLY being charged for one or the other, but not both.  source:  I am a cabbie"

NoStupidQuestions,3dxygf,StuffDreamsAreMadeOf,4,Mon Jul 20 14:35:01 2015 UTC,"I really thought I was missing some massive piece of the puzzle.    One big piece of the puzzle that you may be missing, that a lot of people are missing, is that Taxis have a lot of rules and regulations they have to conform to. This limits there options for pricing.   One thing that people like is how available they are and the cars are nicer. Taxis are limited to how many there can be because their are limited licenses in a city. Those licenses can also cost 1 million dollars per car so the cars have to be cheap and driven into the ground.   I for one think what Uber is doing is totally illegal and should be put to a stop. That or the regulations on taxies should be lifted so that they can compete on equal terms.   Edit: Another important regulation is that regular Taxis have to maintain the same price at all hours on all days. Whereas Uber changes based on demand and other things, like New Years Eve. Sometimes Uber will be cheaper and sometimes not."
NoStupidQuestions,3dxygf,schfourteen-teen,3,Mon Jul 20 16:36:12 2015 UTC,"That or the regulations on taxies should be lifted so that they can compete on equal terms.   This is exactly what should happen. But you should be aware that it is precisely the opposite of what the taxi companies are lobbying for. They don't want the ""restrictions"" on themselves lifted, they are the ones that put that system in place to begin with.  What the taxi companies want is a government protected monopoly, and they want Uber to be subjected to it in order to force them out of business. Meanwhile all of us consumers get to suffer with the terrible service and quality of taxis.  I'm all for eliminating the medallions because the result of that would be to force taxis to up their game. Consumers in the end will benefit whether that is because taxis improve their level of service to compete, or whether they wither and die because they refuse to modernize."

It is not necessary to hail an Uber driver because you can just get on the app and one will be there in a few minutes. Taxi companies could do the same thing and it is somewhat their fault for not, however that level of tech requires a lot of money. Money that an international firm that operates in thousands of cities can afford while a small company in a single city cannot, again the cost of the medallions and conforming to other regulations does not help in that area either."

NoStupidQuestions,3dxygf,jjbibbings,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:57:33 2015 UTC,"actually, it is quite relevant. maybe i did not explain clearly enough: you cannot hail an uber, you must request it, which is where the regulations and extra costs come in with taxis. as i understand, taxis are subject to certain taxes/fees because they have the ability to be hailed, and are a slightly different service form a service where one must request a driver (there's a name for this that i can't think of right now). uber is not subject to these taxes or fees because they cannot be hailed. the technology has been available for years for taxi companies to develop some kind of request service via app, but they have failed to capitalize on this. the taxi companies and laws did not adapt to new technologies. uber filled a huge hole while keeping costs down. thus their success. it's that simple.  edit: also, you seem to think that uber does not have any regulations; this could not be further from the truth. drivers are subject to thorough background checks, vehicle inspections, etc. if they are not rated high enough, they are fired. users are forced to rate their driver after a ride, thus there is 100% immediate feedback. taxi drivers are not subject to this and it is much harder to lose your job for being a bad taxi driver since many companies are unionized. in my opinion, uber is vastly superior to taxi companies. if one business model is fucking terrible in comparison to another, it deserves to fail. i don't understand your need to sympathize with taxis."
NoStupidQuestions,3dxygf,StuffDreamsAreMadeOf,0,Mon Jul 20 20:13:27 2015 UTC,"One problem is that you cannot hail an Uber car because it is not distinct. I think it is also dependent on someone having the app as well.   The medallions are in place for several reasons. One being that infrastructure is built for a certain number of cars, additional care services increases this. Another being that a given place can only support so many drivers, much like needing to keep the number of wheat manufactured low or subsidized in order to keep farmers from going broke.    the taxi companies and laws did not adapt to new technologies. uber filled a huge hole while keeping costs down.   Again, they can do this because they have advantages over regular Taxis because they do not play by the same rules."

They're often run by a small number of highly entrenched companies that rule the local taxi networks, along with a few relatively small operators.  Taxi medallions used to sell for millions of dollars each because they guaranteed years upon years of future profits.

Generally a lot of the sorts of thing that taxi regulations were initially set up to avoid.  Their business lacks a really hard connection between themselves and their drivers, too. Places where the taxi monopoly has successfully been protected will have their share of former Uber driers with fancy cars they no longer need, because Uber can't operate there any more, and no way to recoup their investment.  Sure, that's not exactly Uber's fault, nobody forced those drivers to invest in becoming an Uber driver, but I doubt Uber led their advertising pitch with ""Hey, we're going to start operating a quasi-legal business in your city, which we can ditch at any time if things get too hot for us, leaving you completely out of pocket if we decide to do so"".  Different bastards to the taxi bastards, but still arguably bastards. It's a surprisingly common personality trait."

So by the time you've stopped, waited, and continued, you've done so in a spot a bit further back from where the cars ahead of you did, and so on.   As far as why traffic stopped, yeah, it definitely depends. Sometimes construction, sometimes an accident - and if it's not one of those, and the problem isn't obvious, it's commonly because someone went, ""oh shit, something interesting outside, let's slow down all of a sudden with absolutely no regard for the convoy of people behind me"". Then, the person behind that guy slows down, someone slows down too much, everyone brakes, and the end result is a mile long stoppage because some asshat couldn't leave cruise control on for a herd of idiot deer."

I've seen a few targeted Facebook ads and YouTube pre-rolls from the other parties - but you might not even see those if you aren't in the right demographic groups, since online ads can use your browser data to narrow that down a lot more narrowly.

Now, even on a smaller scale - the local mom and pop shop may also have their family members leave positive reviews for their business.  But overall, it isn't worth it for smaller businesses to waste too many resources in doing this simply because for them, their marketing and business strategy simply is not based on a single customer.  Whereas, larger industries have to do this because a single incident of bad publicity can lead them into a very sticky situation.

Your body would first have to convert the ferric into ferrous iron, which it can do, but that would reduce the amount of iron your system would absorb. Your iron absorption is pretty slapdash anyways, it's not a particularly effective system - at the absolute best you're absorbing max 35% of the iron you ingest.

Purely anecdotal, but this has happened to me before a few times, or at least something similar, if I'm misunderstanding the term.  The first time it happened, I was looking for my keys while visiting a distant relative's house, checking rooms -- I'd poke my head in, turn the lights on, look around, turn the lights off, then move on to the next room.   One room, however, I flipped the light on, didn't see keys, turned the light off and stepped back into the hallway, and bam -- there was a detail-perfect visual ""ghost"" image of the entire room still in vision, though the colors were faded enough to know that it wasn't my physical eyes seeing it (I was in the hallway anyway).  I was stunned. I stayed perfectly still, fearing any movement or light would trigger a visual ""garbage collection"" (in programmer terms). I could literally see every single detail of the room perfectly. It was so bizzarre, because I could feel my eyes physically moving, trying to look around the scene as if it were ""live"", but of course, the image stayed exactly in place. But I could definitely see everything in it, and even focused on particular details that I wanted to verify ""live"" afterward, wondering if maybe my mind was just filling in empty space with nothing like in a dream.  But nope, every bit of detail was there.  After 1-2 minutes, it gradually faded away. I quickly popped back into the room and turned the lines on, looking around at various spots of small detail to confirm detail -- it was all there, exactly as I had remembered it. Of course, I tried the whole thing all over again, flipping on/off the lights, however, it didn't happen again (this time).  Is this what you're referring to? Or is it something else?"

But not sure if this is what u are getting at...Assuming that it is, I offer the following. In a nutshell...To go directly to your question, as little as possible. Just something to the effect of ""Please accept my application for ..................My enclosed resume/application provides details of my background. I appreciate your evaluation of that with respect to this position. I look forward to exploring this application with you further....Sincerely...... Do not use a covering letter to highlight your thoughts on how your background relates to the position..Let the application/resume do that. Your evaluation in this regard is not important...their's is. Secondly, do not use a generic application/resume...research the position thoroughly. Especially discussing it with previous incumbents and supervisors of the position......IF POSSIBLE. Only then can you put yourself in the mindset of those who will review your application...Make their job easier...Some people are too lazy to customize their standard, work-of-art resume, and think they can use the covering letter to customize the application....To me covering letters were irrelevant...I went right to the Resume, seeking out background info. that I considered pertinent...With 50+ applications, I was not about to waste my time with self-aggrandizing drivel....I simply wanted to know type and length of education and experience that related to the position applied for. Only the resume provides that...which gets back to my point. You can only emphasize that which is applicable to the position applied for after you research the job and customize your resume accordingly....Getting back to my notion of talking to previous incumbents and/or supervisors may be difficult to do, but the following is an example. When I applied for my very first HR job, I was under-qualified. It was as a Personnel Officer for a shopping center chain...I spent an entire day sauntering through one of the shopping centers, talking to Department heads, employees, and anyone else I thought pertinent..Then I customized my Resume as much as I could given my less-than-stellar quals.....It worked....Can you see how that would beat out someone who submitted their standard resume, with obscure background linkages to the job applied for......An amateurish resume that is customized to the job applied for,  is better than some gilt-edged, unalterable professionally crafted masterpiece. One size does not fit all. Some people think that if I just get a really neat resume, it will be the magic bullet and can be submitted for all jobs in the future.....NOT!..In fact I looked at professional resume's suspiciously...Like someone trying to fool me with ""fluff and smoke"" over substance."
NoStupidQuestions,3e1k0t,Can-Thai,2,Tue Jul 21 06:47:09 2015 UTC,"A cover letter should be an introduction to yourself - your resume lists what you've done, and a cover letter says who you are. It should cover:   a little about your background, what you studied, what you're interested in, etc why you want to work for the company (do your homework and talk about that company in particular) why they would want you, how you feel you'd be a good fit for them, how your past experience is relevant   It should be polite and formal, but it should have a little personality to it. You want to get across a feel for who you are as a person - don't just reiterate your resume in prose. Above all it should be concise - a recruiter reads through hundreds of cover letters, so keep it to a 3 paragraphs or so!"

The famous one was Michaelangelo, which would silently spread throughout the year and then on the 6th or March it would damage your hard disk and stop your computer working. (It was repairable, but not simple).  These days there are a few reasons but they largely boil down to making money. Maybe they want control over your computer to make a botnet which they can lease to spammers or extort websites via DDOS.  Maybe they want to steal your passwords so they can get into your bank account or they want to steal your credit card details.  Maybe they want to steal files off your computer, like corporate espionage. If you know what the competition is doing then you can outmanoeuvre them.  There have been a couple of probably-government-produced viruses. One was designed to infect and break automatic controls systems for Iranian nuclear refineries to disrupt their ability to refine nuclear materials."

NoStupidQuestions,3dy1rr,Purple7up,5,Mon Jul 20 16:31:59 2015 UTC,"Sneakernet. A technology that is still at the forefront of data transmission.  A more familiar term would be floppy disks. Either the copying of infected binaries, and sometimes viruses deliberately targeted the software piracy scene, or by infecting the boot sector of the floppy disk and hoping it got left in the machine during a reboot. Maybe a combination of the two.  This was called sneakernet because you'd copy the data you wanted to transfer to another machine to a disk and walk (in your sneakers) over there. Allegedly when Google needs to transfer large amounts of data this will still just copy it to an external hard disc and drive it to its destination.  This wasn't as unreliable as you might imagine. There was a time when minimum specs on a computer game required the mere existence of a hard disc and a lot of people booted from floppy disks and swapped in their games. Leaving in the wrong disk was easy enough and not an obvious problem."

NoStupidQuestions,3dy1rr,Gertiel,4,Tue Jul 21 12:06:08 2015 UTC,"There's so many reasons, and I probably barely know half of them, and that list could constantly be added to. Hacking is its own world. I probably have a few viruses on my computer right now that my anti-virus could never pick up.  Here's a few reasons anyways, just for kicks.   Antivirus companies - these people create viruses for the same reason that fire fighters start fires. This should pointt an easy enough picture to understand. Fun - These people assert their dominance over you by destroying your shit since you don't know shit about how to protect your shit or stop it.  Data collection - this is probably the most popular choice, information is power, especially if is vital information, like your full credit card number or bank account numbers. Maybe it's a password to some trade secrets that you have. Whatever it is, there is a pot of gold that youre hiding that they want access to.  Enslavement - what's cheaper? Hiring 500 people to send advertisements 24/7 or infect 500 computers with a virus and let the computers do it for you?(that number of infected computers can reach thousands easily). I've worked in internet support and cannot tell you the amount of people's emails that have been enslaved and people are pretty unaware of it. Also, a virus can use your computer to mine bitcoins without your knowledge, using your computing power and footing you the electric bill. DDos attacks are accomplished by a server taking in too many requests at one time, like a freeway that is not moving because of an overflow of traffic .. maybe your computer is used to send request without your knowledge? Blackmail - This also applies with Data collection. You may not realize (or care) that everything you do can and probably is being recorded (even right now). You may care one day if it were ever to show up. A recent virus trend has been to infect computers and provide the only solution to removal--- a credit card payment to Mr. Hacker himself. They will not allow you to access files (which if you own a business or for any reason that the files are very important and can not be recovered, what choice do you have?).  Advertisements - Getting your name out there can be hard with so many voices. Some people use their skills in computer hacking to create ways for their name to be seen. Whether it's business or personal, they'll let you know probably too often. Whenever a commercial program is released requiring purchase/key, there is a race to be the first to break encryption. Hackers will boast and gain reputation for releasing these key generators and decryption to the public. We've all pirated before and saved hundreds ( or thousands) on software, I've never owned a legitimate copy of windows XP, but I sure as hell had windows XP thanks to the work of others who are playing. Power - This fits in all catagories, but do you have any idea why the NSA exists in the first place? Sure, the power is being abused, but the system was put in place by the people of the country to protect the country from foreign invaders. Corporations, banks, government, and army could be vulnerable to say .. some trained professionals in china who want data. It's a great way to spy for your country while appearing incognito and innocent.   This covers a few bases, but not all of them. Out of the box thinkers can obtain a lot of power with the use viruses.  Here's a list of some of the most notable viruses and what they have accomplished"
NoStupidQuestions,3dy1rr,ilovetoeatpoutine,4,Mon Jul 20 14:34:12 2015 UTC,"Sure, some viruses are written by assholes with too much time and coding experience, but most viruses today are part of one of several types of organized crime.  Many try to infect a computer with the ultimate aim of stealing user's information, either to steal their money directly (such as by recording banking information when you enter it into a browser) or to steal other information, such as social security numbers or other information that could be used in identity fraud. Others gain control of the target computer and use it for various purposes, such as distributing viruses to other computers, routing shady information practices (such as money laundering) through the computer, or networking the computer with thousands of others and using it for DDoS attacks.  Of course, there are other types of organizations that might use viruses, such as intelligence agencies or shady reporters, but that can also fit into one of those reasons.  TL;DR: Either to steal info from the computer or to use the computer remotely."
