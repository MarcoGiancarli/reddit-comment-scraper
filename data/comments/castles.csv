castles,3dwbol,Jzadek,3,Mon Jul 20 20:13:11 2015 UTC,I'm always curious whenever I see a picture / visit a seemingly very isolated castle like this; would there have been a village around / near this castle in the past? Or would this essentially be a remote palace of sorts for the nobility?

Miramare's gardens are well renown, but all the site is said to bring bad luck, especially to couples in love, giving the history of its owners, Emperor Maximilian of Hasburg first(he was executed in Mexico and his wife declared insane soon after) and Prince Amedeo of Savoy later(who died in Africa during WWII). It's absolutely beautiful nonetheless, bad luck and all."

They're doing some renovations, so a few paths are completely closed off and the heat made walking outside of the shade completely unbearable.

castles,3c48dx,mjconns,7,Sat Jul 4 16:55:45 2015 UTC,"Album Location via google maps    The name Aughnanure comes from the Gaelic Achadh na nIubhar - the field of yews, of which one old specimen remains nearby. Situated on the banks of the Drimneed River, which flows into the wester side of Lough Corrib, 3km from Oughterard, the site was well chosen, as the river flows gently beneath the low cliff on which the castle was built, allowing boats bringing supplies to come righ tup to the gate of the fortification.  The O'Flahertys had been temporarily expelled from their ancestral lands west of Lough Corrib in Connemara by the Norman family of De Burgos in 1256 and the original castle at Aughnanure may have been built by Walter de Burgo, first Earl of Ulster. However the expulsion of the O'Flahertys was only temporary and before the close of the 13th century and for the next three centuries, they were master of the entire territory of Iar-Connacht (West Connacht) extending from the west of bank of Lough Corrib to the sea. Aughnanure became their strongest bastion against their neighbours to the south and east, particularly the citizens of Galway who controlled access from the ocean to Lough Corrib.   -Source"

castles,3bqsrf,NouveauWealthy,4,Wed Jul 1 13:41:44 2015 UTC,"The sister site in the US was badly managed, and the french investors/owners expected the same amount of ""free labor"" in the way of volunteers that the one in France was having.  But being so far away from the tourist areas and lack of food and water services is what killed the project.   Seeing Guédelon in 2008 inspired Mr. Mirat to create a New World version of the castle on his land. Revenue would come from some of the eight million annual visitors to Branson, which is 30 miles north of the Mirats’ 1,000 acres of nearly pristine Ozark mountainside and valley.  He enlisted Mr. Guyot, who helped create a limited liability corporation of French investors who contributed an initial $1.5 million — money that was nearly gone by the time the land was cleared and a parking lot and a welcome center were created. Nevertheless, after its debut in May 2010, the castle garnered national headlines and a visit by Larry the Cable Guy for his show “Only in America.”  Investors expected 150,000 paying tourists that first year. Just 12,000 showed up. In 2011, the castle slashed its payroll and increased the admission fee to $18 from $12 per adult.  Tourism dropped still lower, and visitors complained of insufficient personnel. The castle offered neither food nor beverages to weary travelers, and the nearest restaurant was 12 miles away. Meanwhile, the site manager returned to France for personal matters. She was not replaced.  Many investors never visited, and the languishing project closed before the 2012 season. Jean Revault d’Allonnes, an investor who still believes in the castle’s viability, said in an e-mail that it “was underfunded from the beginning,” particularly its advertising budget.  Many of the investors “are not familiar with American culture and language,” he wrote, “and they tried to impose decisions from France without hearing American advice.”"
castles,3bqsrf,NouveauWealthy,5,Wed Jul 1 14:55:30 2015 UTC,"But being so far away from the tourist areas   Well Guédelon isn't exactly that near to tourist areas. The thing is that Guédelon was the first project so there was a lot of enthusiasm. If you see documentaries, workers are passionate about the castle. There are also archaeologists who advise people on the project. So Guédelon has kind of a unique thing, almost nobody thought it could work but it did. The American project seems more geared for profit, it uses a model that doesn't seems as crazy because it worked once. But I'm not sure. I'm still amazed that Guédelon was able to go that far."
castles,3bqsrf,blackadder1132,4,Wed Jul 1 15:44:33 2015 UTC,"Branson (the tourist area) is 30 miles away, with no public transport, no food (closest restaurant is 15 miles away) and a decidedly for profit attitude it seemed doomed to fail.  If it had been closer to town or anything really and not set in someones 1000 acre backyard (so it seemed as though some richguy was building a castle on the tourist dime and volunteer blood sweat and tears) it may have fared better."
castles,3bqsrf,maryveryveryvery,2,Wed Jul 1 17:52:20 2015 UTC,Orléans is 74 miles away from Guédelon  Auxerre (a town relatively small and that isn't touristic) is 30 miles away.  Bourges is 56 miles away.  Paris is 125 miles away.  This area wasn't for tourists before the castle. There was pretty much nothing in the very close area. That's one of the reason of this project. That's why I said I'm impressed it actually worked out.
castles,3bqsrf,NouveauWealthy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:01:12 2015 UTC,"do doubt, But the french people who help on the project feel a part of it, as though they are a part of history.  The one in Arkansas was "" oh wow.......part of a fake castle....call me when its built."""

castles,3bqsrf,robotwarlord,0,Wed Jul 1 23:39:22 2015 UTC,why don't they make these kind of castles somewhere in the US? Toss it up on a mountain somewhere like Neuschwanstein and make it a tourist attraction.

Of course with a bunch of tourists it was basically an orchestra."

castles,3aunqe,byehiday,3,Wed Jun 24 01:14:02 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly certain this castle was built during Sengoku, so its purpose was likely defense."
castles,3aunqe,nlax76,2,Wed Jun 24 01:36:47 2015 UTC,It was built for defense. The reason Japanese castles are generally made of wood is because stone castles would be too heavy and fall apart in an earthquake.

castles,3avagz,GrafSakula,2,Tue Jun 23 20:03:02 2015 UTC,"Neubrandenburg in northern Germany, called the Four-Gate-Town has a circular built historic old town (photo from 1943) with 4 typically northern german brick gothic gates and 25 Wiekhäuser (previously 54), which are a special form of fortifications mostly in north-eastern Germany. These are protrusions built in the city wall to substitute chemin de rondes and increase the height and stability. At the times of the Thirty Years' War these were built into simple half-timbered houses (Wohnbuden). Todays Wiekhäuser are mostly rebuilt and oversized."

castles,3ao1hh,arbili,3,Mon Jun 22 02:24:05 2015 UTC,Is this considered a castle and not a palace or something like that? Did this ever have any military significance?
castles,3ao1hh,Nathaniel_Higgers,2,Mon Jun 22 07:35:26 2015 UTC,"Château would be the term. So, indeed, a palace with no fortifications. It is an unfinished hunting lodge.  Relevant extract from Wikipedia distinguishing between palace/château/château-fort:   The word château is also used for castles in French, so where clarification is needed, the term château fort is used to describe a castle, such as Château fort de Roquetaillade. Care should be taken when translating the word château into English. It is not used in the same way as ""castle"", and most châteaux are described in English as ""palaces"" or ""country houses"" rather than ""castles"". For example, the Château de Versailles is so called because it was located in the countryside when it was built, but it does not bear any resemblance to a castle, so it is usually known in English as the Palace of Versailles."
castles,3ao1hh,Procrastine,2,Mon Jun 22 13:39:38 2015 UTC,That place is insane. It's absolutely massive and yet the king who built it almost never used it because it was just a hunting lodge.

I went there last year after visiting a lot of castles in the UK where the rule is, do NOT take pictures. If you forget and you take a picture, someone will politely tell you to stop (it happened to me). In Chambord, it's written everywhere not to take; What do the tourists do ? They take pictures.  If it was only for pictures, but no, some sub-humans (I'm not targeting anyone here, I saw French high school students do this as well as tourists) are carving their name in the walls and the security service does not give a damn."
