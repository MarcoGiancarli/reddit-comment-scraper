She has always done everything for me so me being on my own is still hard for her to fully grasp.  I'm married, have three kids, and the most handsome dog ever, and she still talks to me like I'm 15 and know nothing about how life actually works.  I guess she spent so much time and effort trying to shield me from life, it's her default mode.  I know she means well and that she won't be around forever so I just go with it.  I understand how she feels more now that I do have kids of my own, but not completely.  It's hard to watch them grow up and not need you anymore but part of me is relieved and proud of them for becoming more independent.  I don't think that's the case for her.  I think she didn't like losing her ability to control my life.  She had good intentions, but she doubted (and still does) my ability to lead my own life.  I'm not really sure where I'm going with this.  I guess I'm trying to say I see it as aggravating and all that, but I know she does it because she cares.  I'm thankful for that and have accepted that is just how she is.  On a related note, I hate when people tell me what I should have  done in certain situations.  Hindsight is always 20/20 and pointing out what I probably already know isn't helpful."
bipolar,3e2l2d,ContradictionMachine,5,Tue Jul 21 14:56:05 2015 UTC,"YES. YOU ARE NOT AN INVALID. And I'm sorry to hear that : / My advice as a professional ""dog person"":  FWIW: I am obsessed with dogs, and it sounds like your life is 100% compatible with dog ownership to me.  As long as you REALLY are gone for only 3 hours max each day. Dogs are pack animals and they hate being alone, especially when they're young.  Shelter animals are most compatible with highly experienced dog owners only IMO. Dog psychology isn't particularly complicated but if you're trying to learn it from a fucked up animal that can be hard. It's best to buy a puppy for your first dog so you can learn and grow together. That also gives you the opportunity to have a properly trained first dog.  Too many sappy idiots go to the shelter for their first dog expecting to bring home Lassie... which as you discovered is usually not in the cards. This awful couple I know has a young boxer they got from the shelter who sounds like an awesome dog, but they keep him in his cage ALL DAY while they are at work because they don't know SHIT about dogs. And they wonder why it is so out of control... maybe your friends also suck at dog ownership? No offense.   TLDR: If you're an experienced dog owner, go for the shelter dog because of course they will get killed after a set period of time :/ It sounds like you have the right amount of time to dedicate to a puppy though, so if you're inexperienced I'd say that route sounds good!"
bipolar,3e2l2d,tkdchic0405,2,Tue Jul 21 16:39:24 2015 UTC,"I also have the advantage of parents hat live in the same town that love the idea of a dog, just not in their house.  They're both retired so for the puppy length of time (and the rest) they will help out if something does arise.  My friends got rescue dogs and I'm sorry but I really don't like any of them. All out of control,  I also want to do professional training one he reaches hat age.  Edit-my friend cages his dog all day and I hate it everytime I see him do it.  I'm thinking kennel (no door locked) I guess they like kennels though, in my bedroom with the door closed.  Not much for cables or other trouble. Then free reign when I'm gone as he get gets older.  Also a cockapoo is the dog for me, everything I want in one, docile smart friendly."

And if you were psychotic, it would be wildly apparent to those around you.  But this is really rough. Do you have a partner to confide in? Also, you should know that people are not forced to take medications they are prescribed. So you can always go in and see what they say and do your own research about anything they suggest. It sounds like you have a lot of anxiety concerning seeking help.  Pregnancy is a weird time for emotions...It might help to post in /r/surviversofabuse and /r/pregnant.

It was right after I moved out of my abusive family's house and got married. He immediately became abusive. I no longer had a place to live so I tried to OD.  Instead of trying to actually help me, or talk to me about things, the psych hospital ""forced"" me to take meds or else they would keep me there longer since I had great insurance. I behaved myself other than taking the meds. They kept their word and kept me. I eventually took the meds so they would let me go. Also, a guy came into my room to try to have sex with me, and the staff got mad at me. Since then, I don't trust psych professionals.  Anyway, I am definitely not acting like the guy in the video, however, I know my thoughts are not based in reality which is what's scaring me."

But there are clinics that you can go to that I was referencing. You can get up and walk away if you get a bad doctor (like I just had recently). No forced medication.  I think what you are experience is very common for PTSD. You strongly want to avoid similar situations from what traumatized you, even if seemingly irrational, and psych professionals were trauma after the trauma. It's one of the big symptoms of PTSD, actually.  I know I already mentioned a couple subreddits, but have you tried /r/ptsd? They seem like a pleasant place that is reasonably active."

You're far more likely to start vomiting up pills and pass out(experienced this twice and completely lost memory of those days) long before reaching more serious symptoms,  but it can do some non-fatal damage that would be rather unpleasant to deal with:  Symptoms of BZD overdose may include the following:  Dizziness Confusion Drowsiness Blurred vision Unresponsiveness Anxiety Agitation  Findings on physical examination may include the following:  Nystagmus Hallucinations Slurred speech Ataxia Coma Hypotonia Weakness Altered mental status, impairment of cognition Amnesia Paradoxical agitation Respiratory depression Hypotension  Source: http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/813255-overview#showall  Not sure if that helps, but knowing that is certainly a deterrent for me. If sleep is a big issue, I'd suggest talking to your pdoc about possibly adding something for that or changing your dose a bit. My klonopin was increased for nights(also take it as needed for my gad) to help with that and the horrible nightmares I get while manic. It's helped a lot."
bipolar,3e3l98,flyinsquirrel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:30:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. This is actually one of the reasons that I misuse benzos. I'm aware that they won't kill me even if I down the whole bottle. Explaining this to the nurses/doctors at the hospital didn't seem to help though. I've unfortunately done a lot of research on what meds I can can and can not kill me. The misuse is more to escape...  trying to pass out for a day or two I guess. Uhg. It's lame. Thanks for your post though, good to hear someone else did similar things in depressive episodes, and managed to stop."

bipolar,3e4p3k,SO_knows_my_main,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:57:16 2015 UTC,"So is the nature of our disorder - ""is it my feelings or the bipolar feelings?"" It's one of my biggest concerns about having bipolar. I'm constantly asking my wife or therapist if it seems like I'm reacting in a ""normal"" way to the facts of a situation.  Do your feelings seem disproportionate to the stressors? I would feel pretty crappy too if my car had that much damage, and I could easily see it spilling over into my work. On the other hand, if you felt euphoric yesterday and now feel like absolute shit (I.e., depression), it could be rapid cycling. However, it is possible your just having a bad streak and not rapid cycling.   Do you have a pdoc or therapist you could talk about this with? I would mention it at your next appointment. Identifying whether or not this is rapid cycling is important in identifying triggers and looking for the warning signs."
bipolar,3e27ca,stupidandcontagious1,2,Tue Jul 21 11:40:11 2015 UTC,"You're not alone. A therapist told me I also had PTSD. I also find the thought of suicide a comfort . Don't ever worry about feeling as if you are complaining here or feel as if your feelings aren't justified because you are not as worse off then others. There is always someone worse off, but that doesn't mean your feelings aren't valid.   That said, I had a hard time when I was in college, I used a lot of drugs and alcohol to hide the mask of a person I felt like I was. Which, not surprisingly, didn't go well for me, I just didn't know how else to cope. My life got a lot better when I got on meds and stopped drinking. I still have times when I feel extremely irritable and say cruel things and I still have times that I feel I am completely separate from my body. Sometimes I say that I feel like I'm playing a video game in 1st person POV instead of actually living. But things are so much better and the periods of days where I'm happy are so much longer now.   Anyway I guess I don't really have any great advice but I more wanted to comment and say what you wrote resonated with me and that I could've wrote what you wrote. If there is any advice I'd say find a good therapist and a pdoc, stay away from too much alcohol and find a friend to talk to (there are plenty of friends here if you don't feel like you can talk to anyone you know). Also that things can get better."

I think those thoughts are more normal than anyone wants to believe, but you don't do it..  You're holding it together even though everything inside you wants to give it all up and run away.

If I ever did go out, it would usually end in a panic attack. It was fucking awful.   My doctor put me on lamictal and added Wellbutrin later for the same reasons. Those meds have been a godsend. I can actually function like a normal human being now. Hell, I'M the friendly guy who always introduces himself, makes new friends, keeps up with relationships, controls conversations, organizes group outings, BBQs, etc..  People actually look up to me now because I'm so friendly, outgoing and calm.  It's fucking nuts.  I'm in control now.

bipolar,3e0szf,pewpewpoopoo,2,Tue Jul 21 11:18:54 2015 UTC,"interesting. this is the first time i've heard of this. in my past, it's all rainbows and orgasms. shame usually sets in wayyy down the road.   i've noticed people's mood really depends on their hormone levels. once a man orgasms, it seems like our hormone levels drop drastically. i'm not informed enough about the biology of it, but guys know what i'm talking about. when one is manic, the hormone levels don't really drop (for me). i think this is generally why manic people are the best lovers. ;)  since you're prone to bipolar episodes, this 'down' stays with you and spirals you into an extended depression. my guess is you're more of a rapid cycler, so your mood is very fragile. you might also have been brought up conservatively, so any sexual 'faux pas' that you indulge in, can really take a toll on you, keeping you in the shame game for a month.  do all of the things to stay stable like meds, eat well, exercise, sleep, stay busy. if you do all of the little things right, you have the best chance at stability. with stability comes hormone stability. then you can get back to bustin' all kinds of nuts without shame, baby!  good luck!"

Had a primary physician for the last 16 years who treated my fibromyalgia,  ADD and took over med management from my therapist for bipolar disorder. I am in the process of fighting for disability for all of the above on appeal. Called my doctor to get my refills and was informed by his bitch assistant that due to new fda regulations,  they wouldn't be able to call in my refills over state lines. I was on pain meds and elavil for the fibro, Adderall for the add, Cymbalta and Lamictal for bipolar. Went cold turkey off all of them just like that.  I have to say the first week was literal hell. Cymbalta was the most brutal. Weird withdrawal symptoms. Two weeks in I was considering checking myself into the mental hospital. I literally felt like an open wound. I am 49 years old and I've been on some kind of antidepressants since I was 30. I was terrified! I'm lucky to have a very supportive SO and he has been watching my symptoms and mood swings. I've thrown myself into being in tune with nature, going for long walks and meditation which helps with the anxiety.  All in all,  the mood swings are fewer and farther between and I'm starting to feel normal again.  Whatever that is.  I'm not anti medication and may end up having to go back on them. We'll see :)"

If he is getting physically out of control, and refusing to see his doctor, it might be time to call authorities for help. He may need a brief stay in a safe, monitored place to get his meds back to where they need to be. It's not his fault, and it doesn't mean he's a bad person, but it's cruel to leave him suffering like this and potentially endangering those around him. In my personal experience of having had the police called on me (by my wife, out of concern), the cops usually have a bit of extra training on mental patients, and just want to get them safely into the ambulance so they can be evaluated or taken where they need to go. It doesn't mean anyone thinks badly of your father, or that he's a terrible person. They realize he's just sick.

Now - All that ammo and shit? Put trigger locks on them (after making sure it's empty), lock in a safe, and the ammo...find a safe place really.   Call the police, tell them you are in danger, he's threatening you (he is, right? fudge it.) AND THAT HE HAS GUNS AND AMMO IN THERE. He needs an ambulance, he is unsafe, guns and ammo (that points to being a danger to others or himself --- but they're as locked up as you can get at that point).

I should have sought treatment and chugged along. I lost direction and gave up.   However, I've known plenty of people through a forum with bipolar spectrum disorders who did take time off. They focused on stabilizing, and then went back. One story I read, it took the person something like 16 years to get through his/her masters with all the stopping/starting. But it's doable.   I guess one way to help decide is to look at how you were before becoming symptomatic. Were you a focused student, or did you struggle to be disciplined? That might give you a clue as to how you'll be when you're a little more stabilized.  Edit: punctuation"

If I had taken a semester off every time I had a bad semester, I would have just had a series of bad semesters because my depressions seemed to hit every other semester.

Based on what you've been through, you've more than earned the right to have some trust issues. I'm sorry that you've had to go through all of that. Keeping it in doesn't make it go away, though. Talk to somebody. Whether it's a mental health professional or your BF, get it out there. Don't struggle with this alone."

Hopefully you can find a therapist in that sort of environment who doesn't charge (and is worth a damn). I know it's tough to get friends/family/significant others to really understand what this illness is about. Are you taking your Seroquel regularly?

bipolar,3e1a6p,MrPoppagergio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:41:22 2015 UTC,"I transitioned from Abilify to Lamictal and Risperdal about a year ago. It was a rough transition for me personally because I was also going through a major depressive episode and experiencing a lot of interpersonal problems. That being said, about a month and a half after starting Lamictal, I woke up and just felt miles better. I don't know what else it could have been--I had all the same life problems, but they felt so much easier to deal with. Lamictal has been great for my mood (I'm primarily depressive) and has slowed down my rapid-cycling. It does take a while to work, and it does need to be titrated slowly to avoid The Rash, but I haven't had any problems with weight gain like I did on other meds. My only apparent side effect is a cognitive deficit, which is still bothersome, but there's no weight gain or anything like that, and I feel more stable than I ever have. Not sure how it'll hold up as monotherapy (I've only been on Lamictal as monotherapy for a few weeks) in terms of mania, considering that it's primarily anti-depressive, but some people find that it does help with their mania as well. YMMV."

That said, I do not believe you when you say that suicide is your only option. That's not an option, it's the removal of all options.  If you're going to kill yourself anyway, then you might as well check yourself into the hospital again first. You might change your mind, or you might still want it all to end after. One more visit isn't going to do you any harm if you're already killing yourself. (What's a few weeks in hospital compared to an eternity of being dead?)  Think about it before you leave this world a worse place than it already is because whether you know it or not, your suicide will have an impact on a lot of people you don't think it will. I'm sure you've heard of the butterfly effect. Your suicide will ripple through time.   It's possible that you don't give a shit. I seriously doubt it though because you took the time to write your post. I personally would like you to consider giving life another chance. You don't owe me anything.  I think you owe it to yourself."

You might be an awful person. I don't know. That's hard to tell over the Internet, but I doubt you're literally Hitler. You're probably not that bad. I guess you could be a serial killer or something.   Quality of life is always going to be an issue. I've found a psychiatrist who actually cares, and doesn't believe in over-medication. I hope you don't give up simply because so many psychiatrists and meds are shitty.   I doubt you've tried everything. It might feel like you have sometimes, but there's a lot of treatment options if you're willing to give them a chance.

Spent seven years pursuing two degrees in a field that is folding up.  So when I do find work, it has nothing to do with my passion.  I end up breaking apart, end up in the hospital for a few weeks, and the job inevitably fires me or makes me quit.  No one wants to help you unless you have the cash.  I am so bitter towards capitalism and it consumes me.  I stay inside, try to take my meds, and try to fight off the boredom.  This next part probably isn't the best advice, but your situation seems similar to mine in a few ways: I have learned how to express my moods and feelings to my psychiatrist in a way that works around suicidal tendencies.  Research drugs on your own, research symptoms, research everything.  When you educate yourself, you can sometimes get farther than relying on your doc.  I got lucky annd found a really good one.  But the ones in psych wards aren't so friendly and could literally give two shits if you feel any better.  One time I was in, they put me on a massive dose of lithium.  It broke me down to a numb core and I attempted suicide.  I AM NOT SAYING SELF DIAGNOSE.  don't WebMD your shit, you dig? Just get educated.  Find a hobby that isn't too frustrating...and expensive.  I do odd jobs for people to make money and live off food stamps.  I can't hold a job and I am currently waiting on a disability claim.  Just know that you aren't alone.

I'll have a can of coke maybe a few times a year if I'm expected to schmooze (all my meds slow me down).  This was after two cups (well 4, interesting fact a cup of tea or coffee is 6oz so am if is closer to two ""cups"" so when they say how much caffeine in coffee they don't mean the whole mug)of strong homemade drip coffee usually said to have 200mg of caffeine.  I was a coffee snob I have every thing short of a real espresso machine... Now in boxes.  When I quit I was tired a lot and had headaches, strong cravings, was irritable.  And I tapered off of it (I was almost exclusively a coffee drinker).  I'm definitely better off for it, it stopped stimulating me and turned into something I needed, it actually feels like a potent drug now.  I quit because of all the studies,  I take klonopin so a stimulant seems counterproductive.  I still like the taste and a local roaster has a decaf you can't tell apart, but now that I don't feed that addiction I never make it anymore.  I'd like to say it makes me sleep better but mine sleep schedule is all messed up.

The heat here has been brutal, and I've been out in it taking down trees and getting some serious tremors when I came in the house for lunch.  The headaches have been mild, probably because I haven't exactly quit yet.

Overall your muscles will be more relaxed, you'll have slightly less anxiety, but for me it doesn't make a huge difference in overall mental health in bipolar terms.    The impulse for quitting caffeine, for me, is the search for healing and redemption.  That making some incremental change might somehow transform me into someone else.  But caffeine just isn't a big enough factor to make it worth dealing with the hassle (caffeine is everywhere and its part of our culture too).  The only change I've found which comes close to that ideal is vigorous, extended cardio exercise.  My suggestion is to go for a 45 minute run, then enjoy an espresso afterwards.

Thats why its dangerous because i feel she might have slept with someone and this person is telling every other man in the area that my gf is an easy target which is causing more men to hit on her than usual.   She is afraid to go to the store now and wont tell she is afraid and also much less tell me WHY..she has been begging me to go with her for DAYS and thats not normal for her.   she deeply enjoys her alone time and riding her bike to the store is a part of that alone time. I knwo her well and know she always does everything for a reason. Also I have sisters and they always would ask me to accompany them when they felt afraid. this is humbling but then again if it's got to do with being fearful of having men persue her aggressively that's not alright and needs to address that openly"
bipolar,3dzdcs,vanityobscene,2,Mon Jul 20 21:33:28 2015 UTC,"Bits and bobs of this story don't add up for me. I originally wanted to address those things but between the multiple threads and the comments you make there's just too much noise and it's beyond me to even bother.  But I do want to say something to you, in a more productive way than I think I did with the comment I deleted.  What you did was not okay. It doesn't matter if the man is a convicted felon, it is still not okay. You made your partner infantile, and you made her feel that way in public. You spoke over her / for her. And then you forced her into a position where she would either have to side with the stranger and tell what was likely the truth from her perspective and hurt you, or lie to management for your sake, but also cause grief for the stranger who as far as anyone knew (including yourself) is entirely innocent of any wrong doing.  That is not fair on her, and you were wrong to behave that way. You owe her an apology big time.  When we're partnered with people with mental illness we always want to help them and look out for their best interests - but there are right and wrong ways to go about it. Any time you remove a person's independence, any time you put them in a position that exacerbates their insecurities and anxiety, any time you go on the attack, you are making things worse.  Your role, if you want to have her back and keep her safe, is not to forbid her from talking to people. It is not to insult people based on a ""vibe."" It is to stand with her as her partner as reassurance. If she was about to hand over personal details, since you live with her, you can say to her quietly that you'd rather not because it doesn't make you feel safe. But you do not willfully insult a person based on nothing. Your perception that ""men aggressively hit on her"" doesn't justify your behaviour.  The way you behaved was uncalled for, objectionable, and it made your partner feel worse instead of safe. And you need to talk to her about that. You need to admit that it was your fault and talk about the things that are important to you.  But most of all you need to come down from whatever pedestal you've put yourself on and know inside and out that you absolutely cannot belittle your partner like that ever again. She is an independent human being. She knows better than you ever will what she needs and when. You are her support, not her bouncer. Learn that for both of your sakes, 'cause if you don't this relationship of yours will tank absolutely and you'll be around long enough to become the abusive partner.  Edit: OP clarified below."
bipolar,3dzdcs,vanityobscene,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:08:06 2015 UTC,"/u/VanityObscene, There were a lot of details I left out because I didn't want to type out an overly long wall of text. So let me explain WHY I did what I did:  She is a heavy drinker. NO, her moods do NOT GET BETTER when she is sober so please save me the speech about how she would get better if she was sober. I know because last year she was sober for 6 months and her moods where exactly the same as they are now.   So let's move on to the event. You told me I should have taken her aside. Could I have taken her aside? NEGATIVE, nope. NOT AT ALL. Why you ask? Because she was already drunk. She normally doesn't listen to anything I have to say because she thinks she knows better and she knows everything and she thinks she knows best in all situations which is A LIE BECAUSE NO ONE KNOWS EVERYTHING OR KNOWS BEST AT ALL TIMES; That's just a fact.   On our bike ride to the store she started arguing with me. Do you want to know about what? Well, last week someone called animal control on us for having too many cats and the limit in our zoning area is 3 pets per household so the fact that we have 5 rescued kittens provoked the wrath of a neihboor and this person told animal control that we had too many pets but MY GIRLFRIEND THINKS OUR LANDLORD IS THE ONE WHO CALLED. She has no proof of this but for revenge is planning to call animal control on him and tell them he is abusing and neglecting his dog. So I disagreed with her idea because if she does it and he suspects that we did this or finds out it was us more than likely what will happen is he will ask us to MOVE OUT. Should I also take her aside and talk to her about that quietly? Lol, if I tried that I wouldn't even get a word in..it's impossible and I have tried many times to have a nice pleasant conversation with her or to let her cool off and talk about it when she is calm but that doesn't work either.   I HAVE NO IDEA WHY YOU ARE ASSUMING I CARELESSLY EMBARRASSED HER and IGNORANTLY OVERLOOKED SPEAKING TO HER PRIVATELY because I have tried probably thousands of times to do what you suggested and it has NEVER gotten past me saying ""I want to talk to you about what happened the other day, if that's okay with you......""  The response is always she cuts me off after I say ""If that's okay with you"" and says something similar to this: ""I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ALL YOU DO IS NAG. NAGGGG, NAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG! X10"" and then she WALKS AWAY and disappears for about an hour or two and I have no idea where she is or if she is okay.   This doesn't stop me from trying to talk to her calmly and in private but this particular event wasn't safe and this man looked very dangerous! I HAD TO SAY SOMETHING, I COULD NOT BE MEEK AND POLITE AND SHY about it because it was a very SERIOUS AND URGENT SITUATION!!!  Please try and understand that this man could have hurt us and maybe done who knows what else. We are WOMEN, he is a man and he's NOT taking no for an answer. What do I mean by he is not taking NO for an answer? Well, we told him we don't want to talk to him and we're gay (so basically we are not interested in him in that way), he says ""Woah, don't get mad girl. I just want to talk"" and winks at us. I SAID WE ARE NOT INTERESTED but he still wont leave us alone! That's him not taking NO for an answer. In my experience people who behave like this when they have just met you DO NOT HAVE GOOD INTENTIONS. EVERY MAN I HAVE ASKED ABOUT THIS INCIDENT TOLD ME I WAS RIGHT TO SPEAK UP.   I'M SORRY BUT IF I HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN me speaking to her privately and getting ignored and subsequently US GETTING RAPED/KIDNAPPED/DRUGGED -OR- me speaking up and MAKING MY GF FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE, I will always CHOOSE TO MAKE HER UNCOMFORTABLE. I even asked one of her friends (asked as a hypothetical question) and made sure to NOT disclose that this event happened between me and my gf and the response from the friend was ""THAT GIRL IS A B-TCH. WTF IS WRONG WITH HER"" and then the friend said ""F-CK THAT, SAFETY FIRST!"".  IT WAS A MATTER OF SAFETY.. oh sorry I wrote that in all caps, I meant to write it in lower cased letters"
bipolar,3dzdcs,vanityobscene,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:09:50 2015 UTC,"Alrighty, that is a lot of detail you left out.  I can tell you're passionate about this woman and can tell you've invested a great deal in your relationship with her. I can tell you want the best for the pair of you and want to find a resolution to these problems, but in this response you've shown exactly why that's not possible.   She is a heavy drinker. NO, her moods do NOT GET BETTER ...   You told me I should have taken her aside. Could I have taken her aside? NEGATIVE, nope. NOT AT ALL. Why you ask? Because she was already drunk. She normally doesn't listen to anything I have to say because she thinks she knows better and she knows everything and she thinks she knows best in all situations ...   I HAVE NO IDEA WHY YOU ARE ASSUMING I CARELESSLY EMBARRASSED HER and IGNORANTLY OVERLOOKED SPEAKING TO HER PRIVATELY because I have tried probably thousands of times to do what you suggested and it has NEVER gotten past me saying ""I want to talk to you about what happened the other day, if that's okay with you......""  The response is always she cuts me off after I say ""If that's okay with you"" and says something similar to this: ""I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ALL YOU DO IS NAG. NAGGGG, NAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG! X10""   Your partner has violent moodswings, she is a drunk and is self-medicating or is plainly an alcoholic and is not seeking help. She is paranoid. She doesn't value your input. She takes risks and cannot be reasoned with, and she is putting not only herself in harms way but you as well.  There is no easy to say it. This is a relationship that has already crossed that threshold of being doomed. Love is not enough to keep a relationship afloat. It takes communication, trust, patience. It takes self-improvement for your partner's sake as well as your own. It takes being equal.  And none of that appears to be the case here. And I get the impression by the passion layered in your comment that you know that too. I get the impression you want there to be that sliver of hope, that fixer answer to make things better. But there isn't one.  She needs help and it's more than you can give her. I'm saying this to you for exactly the same reason in my original comment. It isn't right for anyone to treat their partner like dogshit. And if it isn't you at fault, as I think you tried to explain, it's her.  Put yourself first. Look at your relationship carefully and ask yourself how much longer you think things will last if nothing changes. Ask yourself how much more you can give. Ask yourself whether she'll even engage you in that way and work on her problems.  I have been in situations where I've had to ask those questions. I have also been in the position of the person who someone else had to reflect upon the same way.  This isn't a lecture about her problems, so please don't take it that way. This is me trying to tell you that you need to get out of that toxic pit before it ruins you as well."

She is like you say unwilling to work on things it seems. I feel she is jst going through the motions of therapy and not really getting the full benefit.   There is always another shoe..and it could be that she is working very hard on this privately but just isn't receiving the tools she needs. All in all only time will tell.   I can't say I don't want to be with her because thats not where I'm at right now. But if I ever get to that point then that will be that.   I have never been able to understand why she behaves like this. The man we encountered seemed to behave just like her..he started arguing with me and I didnt even know him..i felt like i was arguing with her. I wonder now if she is bipolar or just a drug addict. I will never know and I dont care to know anymore.   I am working on rebuilding my life and if she isnt where she needs to be when I am where I need to be, she will either have to change OR get left behind.   -no regrets-"
bipolar,3dzdcs,marvin_da_martian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:48:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly it's entirely possible your partner is both bipolar and an addict. People with Bipolar, or any type of depression, have a tendency to self-medicate. We can quickly and easily develop addictions through that process.  It's just important to manage your expectations and know what you can and cannot do. As much as I'm sure you want to, you cannot be the saviour. Being someone's crutch is just as bad as leaving them to their own devices.  If she is going to get better it has to be from within herself with your support. It cannot be you dragging her by her ankles while simultaneously having her throw a world of shit at you.   The latter only happens in films and television. In the real world taking that tact will only crush you with its weight, and make your partner completely dependent on you instead of getting better.  I genuinely hope the best for you, I just don't see the best coming from this relationship. Not without significant changes soon."

SIDE NOTE: Last month we went to a concert and on our way there she told me over and over that if she got in a fight at the concert that I needed to say the other person started it even if it was a lie.  Yet when this man verbally insults me in front of her she turns around and starts telling everyone I STARTED THE ARGUMENT despite the fact that I DID NOT DO THAT!   I never asked ASKED HER TO LIE about what happened/NO ONE had ASKED HER WHAT HAPPENED but SHE willingly VOLUNTEERED THE FALSE INFORMATION.   So why would she ask me to lie if she starts a fight and then turn around and accuse me of starting an argument with a stranger? This seems like an UNFAIR EXCHANGE...So she asks me to have her back and take her side even when she is the aggressor BUT when I am NOT THE AGGRESSOR she volunteers to frame me? You know what they call someone like that? A BACKSTABBER, FAKE FRIEND or ""TWO FACED"".  Guess my girlfriend is a backstabber.  You have to understand that I was in danger and so was she. And that what she did was wrong because she is asking for loyalty yet isnt willing to return the favor. That's wrong on every single level.

You don't have to like his relationship, but it is his call who he partners with and how he lives.

bipolar,3dz7by,bluequail,2,Tue Jul 21 17:27:05 2015 UTC,Yea ..... See she didn't chose this disorder. The onset was probably a big surprise to her. My husband's sisters are a part of my support system. I literally drove my husband crazy during my onset episode. Obviously they got upset at first.... Then they started to go to family sessions w the doctors. Learn everything they could ... Because we do have 3 children and  we will always be connected . a great possibility that they may inherit this disorder and they need to know exactly how to handle this. O and the fact that my husband loves me and I love him .... I know we are stronger than a lot of couples because we have been through this and came out . suggestion if you don't want him to push u away and you value a relationship with the baby .... I would insert myself into that support system. The best way of helping him is ... Helping him. Letting him know he isn't alone in this . she didn't pick this .... I mean if you could only get a glimpse at what her mind goes through . if anything you need to have compassion and understanding . I'm very close to my husbands family... This took years of battling my illness together.
bipolar,3dz7by,Rosie_Martinez,2,Tue Jul 21 17:58:11 2015 UTC,O and I definitely have compassion for you .... My mother and aunt had this disorder. I was on the other side of this until my onset. It's so frustrating you wanna just shake the sense into them. I could never understand how people could act out like this and not think before they did things. How they hurt the people that loved them .... I had so much anger . I dedicated my life to learning how to treat and understand this disorder. Then I had a reaction to an antidippresent .... One that was given to me for my OCD . I lost everything that I hold dear. I don't remember but bits and pieces from a whole year of my life . I tried to take my life 6x just to make it stop . My mind moved so fast .... I hurt so many people . I finally came out of that fog . Now I actually understand what my own mother had to deal with ... Only she wasn't able to get the medical help I did . He probably watched her go from this women he once loved... To a complete stranger . This disorder can never be cured .... She will have to fight her own mind for the rest of her life. He seems to understand her torture and he may stick it out or he may not . But he will need his families support to make it through. Very sorry for you and your family.... This is a battle I wish no one ever had to fight.

bipolar,3dz7by,Rosie_Martinez,2,Tue Jul 21 18:34:31 2015 UTC,Well the thing about medication and bipolar disorder is .... Once they start working . You think we'll I'm normal .... I feel great ...maybe it was just a phase . Medication definitely works and it takes time to tweak it just right. Your not to low your not to high. So withe medication you have to have intense therapy . you can live a relatively normal life... But even if a medication is from a different company than the last ...different batch . it can throw you for a spin .... So yes relatively normal. No never completely normal.... Your mind is wired different. Or your chemical make up of your mind .... It's something you can't see in blood work really ...a MRI..eeg...X-ray . so that's why people just stop taken their meds or live in denial. I have a college degree ... I graduated hs ... I am a mother of 3 and married . So I do live pretty normal life .... But an episode can come out of nowhere and your support system has to be strong enough to lock it down and get you. Back in control . This is what makes my husband and his family amazing.
bipolar,3dz7by,Rosie_Martinez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:31 2015 UTC,"What you are saying here:   But even if a medication is from a different company than the last ...different batch . it can throw you for a spin   Makes so much sense.  It really does.  I see people on meds that live a ""good"" life (much like you), and yet where we used to live, I'd see a lot of people that would use being bipolar to just excuse their bad behavior, without even trying to take meds.  Kind of like when a drunk does bad things, but then use the excuse ""but I was drunk"".  For someone on meds, I can see them having a bad episode for reasons like you mentioned, and for that, support is needed and appreciated, I'm sure.  But when you get someone that has been repeatedly diagnosed (usually in the penal system), and still refuse to take medications, it makes it really hard to want to even acknowledge their existence.  May I ask you this?  How were you actually diagnosed, to where you could start on meds?  Perhaps if this young lady could be pointed in the direction of how to get her sister in for an evaluation, perhaps her sister in law might be receptive to it.  I do know that the undiagnosed/untreated bipolars I have seen in my life were not happy people.  They got to watch their lives unravel around them, they often have lengthy jail records from domestic issues... it is just a sad thing to see."
bipolar,3dyg3p,thegarbageflower,2,Mon Jul 20 15:41:48 2015 UTC,"It took me a loooong time to learn to even like myself. For me, that process involved many things, but mainly I had to stop trying to be the person other people wanted me to be. For example, I had been a Christian ever since I could remember. It was only when I stepped away from that - and all that came with it - that I could be honest with me and not believe something just because my family... expected it from me. I could probably give example after example, but the main gist of it is that it was a process that too a lot of time and a lot of honesty.    That said, my spouse had to put up with me throughout that whole time. But she didn't complain... much... and she never really had any expectations that I had to live up to.   This is just my opinion, but I don't think I'd want to be with someone who set conditions on our relationship. Living with someone who is self-loathing is difficult, but not impossible. And you'll never actually complete the transition to self love if you are doing it for someone else. Do it for you - if at all. And if that attracts him, so be it. But at least you'll be happy. My 2 cents."

But I continue and try to improve the things I can, slowly without resentment, and accept the things I can't change.   When, like now, I can barely leave the bed because my body feels like every movement means wading through quicksand and I hate everything about everything and just want to die. I accept that this is how I feel right now. I do not feel guilty or shameful for my thoughts. That just makes it worse.   This is my condition, this is what happens, someday it will subside and I'll feel better again. I always do. It may take awhile, and it may not last. But I always feel a bit better. I take it a little bit at a time.   The hardest part is comparing yourself to others, or thinking, how you should act. Those do nothing but making you hate yourself. You've got to let that go."

Sometimes I get where I just can't be around anyone, I feel super tense and can't think if I'm around anyone else and I feel like if they just prick me I'm gonna burst, or just become a sobbing mess on the floor, or something. All I try to do is just parry them, whatever they say I just try to deflect it, it never even enters my mind what it's about. I can't look anyone in the eye because I know I have no chance of making the right faces to make it seem as though I'm there and enjoying myself, if anyone gets a look there will only be horror and tears just about to break out.   It's a pretty normal state for me so far but I've just started lithium a month and a half ago and I think I'm getting better. When I get like that I usually keep my phone turned off, don't go out and don't go on facebook for 3-4 days. After that I usually feel more calm and collected and, I think, more like anyone else about it. It starts working again. I have a couple of very good friends that understand if I need to be off by myself for some time, that I know will always be there when I do want to hang out again so I'm not having very much trouble with loneliness thank god... It's taken quite some time to get good friends though, like 4 years ago I didn't really feel like I had anyone I felt good with and I did go so far as to ""break up"" with a couple of them. I don't know if it's relevant but I got to thinking about it because you said you come to doubt in your friendships.

Basically, you have to take the initiative to get your friends together in situations that don't  necessarily involve alcohol.  Whenever I'm around people who are drinking, the attention will eventually be brought my way because I'm not drinking.  I usually say I don't want to drink because it takes days for me to get over a hangover.  The common rebuttal is to ""just have one"".  I reply that we all know how that works and then I adamantly refuse to drink.  If they persist, then I turn it around and tell them to drink more and more.

My depression gets worse because I'm not being social, and I'm not being social because of my depression.. Eventually something switches and I feel more like myself again and I pull myself out of it. But it is very difficult to keep friends during that time, at least you can see who your real friends are that don't just abandon you because you disappeared for a while. At the same time, this can be very stressful to intimate relationships. Sometimes I feel like the more someone fights to be with me the more I push them away..

bipolar,3duq1y,coporob,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:36:09 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of in the same boat. Socialising can be both fun and stressful. When I'm not 100% enjoying it and get very self-conscious it works against its purpose.  For me it helps to socialise with those I'm most comfortable with. Where I can be myself and do things I love.   Socialising just to socialise feels forced and pointless. But sharing moments of happiness with people I know love me is truly therapeutic and a necessity for all humans, not just those of us with disorders and depression."

I wouldn't constantly hang out with anyone I didn't like. However, since they knew I would get these moods, they would give me my space til I was ready to come back into the fold.

Didn't happen until I were the lowest I've ever been and pretty much told many of my closest friends goodbye.  Second step was, believe it or not, doing positive stuff. But what positive stuff is varies from person to person. For me it was physical exercise 3-5 times a week. Along with me studying again and trying to do things each day that made me feel like I had progress was therapeutic enough in it self for me to become happier and more stable.

However, I will force myself to leave the house, if it's only to go out in the yard and mess around, see how the tomato plants are doing, see if anything is blooming.  I will usually duck back inside after 2 cars go by but at least I am trying.

Here is the abstract on a pilot study on marijuana and mood in people with bipolar disorder:  Patients with bipolar disorder (BP) often report subjective mood improvements after smoking marijuana (MJ); however, empirical studies supporting this claim have not been conducted. We conducted this study to determine if marijuana has an impact on mood in bipolar patients who smoke marijuana (MJBP), hypothesizing MJBP participants would experience improved mood after smoking MJ. All participants completed electronic mood ratings three times daily and recorded episodes of MJ use using Palm Pilot devices in their own environments in order to examine the impact of MJ use on mood in MJ-smoking bipolar patients (n = 12) and pure MJ smokers (MJ; n = 20). Difference scores were calculated between pre and post-MJ scales. Patients with BP (n = 11) who did not smoke MJ were also included as a comparison group. Significant mood improvement was observed in the MJBP group on a range of clinical scales after smoking MJ, while the MJ group reported a slight worsening of symptoms. Notably, total mood disturbance, a composite of the Profile of Mood States, was significantly reduced in the MJBP group, but increased in the MJ group after smoking. Further, while the MJBP group reported generally worse mood ratings than the BP group prior to smoking MJ, they demonstrated improvement on several scales post-MJ use as compared to BP participants. These data provide empirical support for anecdotal reports that MJ acts to alleviate mood-related symptoms in at least a subset of bipolar patients and underscore the importance of examining MJ use in this population.   This one is just pilot study and has a very small sample, but it shows some promise for future research.

Diehl, Alessandra;  Cruz Cordeiro, Daniel;  Laranjeira, Ronaldo  Revista Brasileira de Psiquiatria, Vol 32(Suppl 1), May 2010, S41-S45.

As you can see, there still isn't a lot known about the interaction between marijuana and manic episodes. I am bipolar and I smoke marijuana daily. I have found that it improves my moods and helps tremendously with anxiety and depression. However, this might not be the case with everyone or even most bipolar patients for that matter.   If you don't want to quit, I would just keep a very close eye on your symptoms if I were you. A lot of things such as caffeine, nicotine, sleep, and even the weather can interfere with bipolar disorder, so it is completely plausible that marijuana would too.   Stay safe."

Abstract  Cannabis use may increase the risk of psychotic disorders and result in a poor prognosis for those with an established vulnerability to psychosis. A 3-year follow-up (1997–1999) is reported of a general population of 4,045 psychosis-free persons and of 59 subjects in the Netherlands with a baseline diagnosis of psychotic disorder. Substance use was assessed at baseline, 1-year follow-up, and 3-year follow-up. Baseline cannabis use predicted the presence at follow-up of any level of psychotic symptoms (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.76, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18, 6.47), as well as a severe level of psychotic symptoms (OR = 24.17, 95% CI: 5.44, 107.46), and clinician assessment of the need for care for psychotic symptoms (OR = 12.01, 95% CI: 2.24, 64.34). The effect of baseline cannabis use was stronger than the effect at 1-year and 3-year follow-up, and more than 50% of the psychosis diagnoses could be attributed to cannabis use. On the additive scale, the effect of cannabis use was much stronger in those with a baseline diagnosis of psychotic disorder (risk difference, 54.7%) than in those without (risk difference, 2.2%; p for interaction = 0.001). Results confirm previous suggestions that cannabis use increases the risk of both the incidence of psychosis in psychosis-free persons and a poor prognosis for those with an established vulnerability to psychotic disorder.

If you've ever had any psychotic symptoms (delusions or hallucinations), then I would strongly advise not to overindulge."
bipolar,3dusj2,Kitteh_Puppeh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:59:24 2015 UTC,I haven't tried it since I've been on meds. Before I had my diagnosis it made me really anxious and just really fucked with my mood.
bipolar,3dusj2,madhatter1984,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:25:27 2015 UTC,"I'm a daily smoker. It calms me down. It doesn't interact with my meds at all. It just relaxes me. My psychiatrist knows I smoke. It's never really been mentioned before though. It's just a 'still smoke marijuana daily? ok,' kinda thing.  There are always outliers though. You know yourself. If you think you're becoming depressed or manic, stop and see if it helps."
bipolar,3dusj2,mizzlepizzle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:09:43 2015 UTC,"Weed can trigger psychosis,  so if you're on meds to counter psychosis then it's really ultimately going to be counter productive to smoke on top. You're rolling the dice here massively."
bipolar,3dvymo,spanishgianni,2,Mon Jul 20 00:01:04 2015 UTC,I can't remember where i read it. You basically start going to bed 30minutes earlier and getting up 30 minutes earlier until you are close to the time shift. However that's a pretty extreme change and might not be practical.
bipolar,3dvymo,grumblecakes1,2,Mon Jul 20 01:56:56 2015 UTC,"My sleep schedule changes drastically for work. I normally take meds at bedtime and when I eat breakfast. I continue to do that regardless of what time I go to bed or eat breakfast. Time changes are hard, but I think what I am doing makes sense. I can't say it works great, but it seems to work better than trying to go by the clock instead of my schedule. Does that make sense?"
bipolar,3dvymo,lilhoserchick,2,Mon Jul 20 13:28:29 2015 UTC,"Yes it does make sense, I think. Having a constant thing (medication) in your changing schedule eases the blow of change. Thanks for your comments, I'll keep it in mind :)"
bipolar,3dvymo,ThreadLocker,2,Mon Jul 20 19:33:38 2015 UTC,"Summertime eastward travel is an issue for me where wintertime westward travel isn't so much.  A very flexible schedule, with zero commitments the first few days, would be part of my plan.  Exercise so I'm exhausted when the sun goes down.  It depends on the timing but assuming it's an overnight flight, ambien or restoril on the plane (both short acting) and ambien cr or lunesta once I got there (longer acting).  I wouldn't hesitate taking a hypnotic every night and just dealing with the rebound insomnia when I returned."

bipolar,3dt7qz,chiliflakes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:57:06 2015 UTC,"That's amazing. How rewarding it must feel.  I used to have a channel speaking about BPD close to 10 years ago before the world was on YouTube. I used to have a lot of people message me and it was so good to communicate with them. Unfortunately I took it down as YouTube got more popular and I was afraid of my ""real life"" friends finding out.   I had one person that slowly stopped responding and then stopped all together. A year later I got a message from his account, but from his mother, saying he had left this world. She wrote that she knew that our talks had meant a lot to him. It was really heart breaking. I really wish I could have helped him further. I'm really happy you were able to do that for someone."
bipolar,3dt7qz,pressiegirl,2,Sun Jul 19 15:13:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing. I'm sure what you did helped countless people. When my sister took her life 12 years ago (she had BP as well), nobody really talked about it in my family or neighborhood. It was like this secret that made people uncomfortable. After everything that has happened to me, my attitude is now, ""fuck it."" I am completely open with everyone I see. Especially my facebook. You would be amazed at how many people come out of the woodwork to express their pain when you make that first step. Although it certainly isn't easy"
bipolar,3dt7qz,BiPolarizer,3,Sun Jul 19 15:27:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I wish I could be as free as that. Unfortunately I'm studying towards being a medical professional, and people can report you for disclosing these things. It's shit. I'm constantly paranoid at university too. I need assistance at times from the university, but if they know bipolar is affecting me, they too can stop me from being a medical professional. Frustrating. I'm glad you're able to talk about it freely. I can only imagine what it would be like to go through something like that with your sister, absolutely terrible, so I completely respect how you speak about this disorder."
bipolar,3dt7qz,BiPolarizer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:47:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks. And I totally understand the ramifications surrounding ""coming out"" with your mental illness in the health profession. It's certainly an interesting conversation to have. All the same though, good luck with everything :)"

bipolar,3dt7qz,tunnelsnakesrulee,2,Sun Jul 19 16:20:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I never thought I would get to this point in my life. Things were just so hopeless. I remember at one point I would pee the bed because of medication like trazadone and seroquel, and not even give a shit. I would wear the same clothes and sleep on the same sheets for months. I remember researching way to get cancer. As silly as it sounds, I wanted to die without having to do it myself.   But now life has taken such a dramatic turn. I have never been more fulfilled. More than anything, if you are reading this and feel utterly hopeless, just know that I understand. Also know that your life doesn't always have to be this way."

bipolar,3duuxb,HuayChivo,4,Sun Jul 19 18:23:45 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry, that sounds like it's really painful. I have no idea what that's like so I can't offer anything from experience, but it's strange to me that she misses the ""old you"" who was unstable. Maybe you could ask about the parts she misses. No need to apologize for the vent, we all need to sometimes. best of luck with your medication change!"
bipolar,3duuxb,daybats,2,Sun Jul 19 20:08:35 2015 UTC,As in any relationship communication is key. Let her know how you are feeling. Listen to what she has to say.   Sometimes the meds really zonk us out. Sometimes our moods goes bonkers. Sometimes we get depressed. But you have to keep communicating through all of it.
bipolar,3duuxb,Wattsherfayce,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:24:38 2015 UTC,"Wow, I can totally relate. My fiance and I got pregnant very early in our relationship, and I immediately went off all my meds. While doing so abruptly (without tapering) was definitely not the best idea, and led to some pretty extreme episodes, eventually I did level off to where my episodes have been mostly manageable, even without my usual meds. (I miscarried that baby, and we're currently trying for another, so I'm not on my typical meds). It gets rough at times, especially during depressive episodes, but I feel that he enjoys my manic phases nearly as much as I do, especially the increased productivity and hypersexuality... tho I'm sure he could do without the delusions and ridiculous overspending. I worry about what will happen to our relationship after we have our next child and I return to my regular meds, as my doctor is recommending. I've been off of them for so long, and for most of our relationship... I'm worried he's going to miss ""this me"" - the me who is a bit more wild, more productive, and almost always up for sex - not to mention able to orgasm! lol (I tend to have more manic episodes than phases of depression) vs the way I am when ""properly medicated"" - definitely much MUCH more subdued, especially emotionally and sexually.  I wish I had advice to give, but barring that, all I can say is that your situation definitely resonates with me, you are not alone. Best of luck to you, I hope you can find that happy medium where you're medicated enough to curb the worst of your symptoms, yet still close enough to the ""old you"" your wife is happily getting reacquainted with."

bipolar,3dwaa6,Riskebiscuit,2,Mon Jul 20 02:22:52 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a manic episode to be. I'd highly recommend taking to your psychiatrist about taking an SSRI and the possible episode causing effects. As far as I know, it's a bad idea taking uppers or downers."
