gaymers,3dzxka,Cthulhus_Madness,24,Mon Jul 20 22:39:34 2015 UTC,"It really was great! The hand-holding especially spoke to me as my boyfriend likes holding hands in public but I just immediately feel uncomfortable. It's true that it's just a part of my life that I always have to be conscious of: how I present myself and my relationship to the world, even when no-one's looking. I never thought of these feelings as temporary due to living in a homophobic society, but a fact of life that will never go away.  I'm 30 now, maybe when I'm 45 like the speaker I will no longer have to think about ""being gay"" in public, but just ""being me""."
gaymers,3dzxka,Bradasaur,13,Mon Jul 20 23:28:22 2015 UTC,"It was nice for me to hear her talk about that as well. I'm 30, as well. 10 years ago it was much worse, but for me I'm not sure how the gut response of doing something risky every time my boyfriend or I reach out to hold the other's hand will ever go away. Most of the time we're holding hands it's walking around the gayborhood, and very often it's in sight of other gay couples, but the vigilance is always a part of the equation unless we're at home.  I just became an uncle a week ago. Hopefully when we're 45 and I talk to my niece about stuff like this she won't believe me because she's never seen her gay friends treated differently enough for them to feel the same concern that we do."
gaymers,3dzxka,Lyaewen,11,Tue Jul 21 00:03:06 2015 UTC,"I'm 47 and I still look over my shoulder.. ""just in case"". And I am in California, so it SHOULD be something I don't give a second thought to. But it's far too ingrained that my very life could be in danger for simply kissing my husband. I can't shake that just because we ""should"" be more accepted now."
gaymers,3dzxka,celtcub,8,Tue Jul 21 01:54:02 2015 UTC,"I feel for you. Me and my bf just had our 9 anniversary together and we didn't hold hands at all in the beginning, moved to a different city and still don't. Like we were trained for it. One day we will but my palms get so sweaty when he grabs me. That's love right?"
gaymers,3dzxka,Levin1983,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:22:42 2015 UTC,"Can someone explain this fear to me? My partner of 9 years is uncomfortable holding hands in public. On the rare occasion that he does it, he'll look around to make sure no one is looking.  I really want to know: what are you guys afraid of? That someone will frown at you or something? Who the fuck cares? I haven't had a chance to watch the video yet, but by allowing strangers to have that kind of power over you, you're certainly not doing anything to make the world a more gay-friendly place. Just my thoughts..."
gaymers,3dzxka,commissionerofwine,8,Tue Jul 21 11:14:54 2015 UTC,"Watch the whole video. I found she explained this very well.  People are worried about violence, whether verbal or physical. But it is more than that. It is about being unable to celebrate the little things openly. It  is about 'making a statement' rather than a simple expression of love. It is about having to predict and put up with other people's reactions. It is always being on and this is draining.  I still hold hands in public but it is not always easy."

I'd kinda hope for someone to attack me in an airport.  Its an easy win in court and a massive lawsuit waiting to happen. There's plenty of security cameras to capture the evidence.  I'd happily take a punch to ruin a bigot's life.)

gaymers,3dzxka,Stonn,2,Tue Jul 21 12:17:57 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, I agree with that. I would rather take them on and get beaten up/die than live in a closeted way for my whole life.

gaymers,3dzxka,qidlo,10,Tue Jul 21 00:25:32 2015 UTC,"to be fair i notice straight people's PDA as well,  i think everyone does.  obviously when people see gay couples holding hands its thought on a little more,  but i think in this day and age its mostly just because it's a rarity to see gay people's PDA.  All im trying to say is i dont think gay PDA will never not be noticed because it's human for our species to make a note of who is mating with who.  it's a bit crazy of her to try to relinquish that human facet.  The best we can do is to show pda (not anything over the top no one likes to see anyone makeout on anyone else regardless of sexual orientation) more and more so the general public will see it as much of a common occurrence as straight people.  but even then itll still be noticed and im fine with that.    But then again that can only be said for some countries and only certain parts of others.  still have a long way to go my friends.  the uganda thing absolutely terrifies me"

gaymers,3dzxka,DeeperThanGlitz,4,Tue Jul 21 20:44:46 2015 UTC,I hadn't seen this thanks. Panti (the drag queen) was always popular in the Irish gay scene but exploded internationally after the Irish national broadcaster RTÉ was threatened with being sued for slander because during an interview Panti referred to a number of journalists/lobbyists as homophobes. They paid a heap of money to the journalists/lobbyists to stop the case going to court. She made another speech after that at the end of a play which also went viral and is also great: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXayhUzWnl0
gaymers,3dzxka,dirtywhitehat,3,Tue Jul 21 15:00:21 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of something from many years ago back in high school.  All the straight couples would make out at various places around campus and it was all quite obvious if you walked anywhere near.  I had a friend who is a lesbian and she would make out with her girlfriend in much the same way.  They would get called into the office over and over for doing the exact same thing as the straight couples, yet they were the only ones getting in trouble.  Kind of makes me angry just thinking about it."

gaymers,3dtuy6,Jonnyg42,22,Sun Jul 19 13:13:55 2015 UTC,It's my buddies place. He actually made them himself! His entire house is like a gaming shrine. It's incredible.

gaymers,3dtuy6,TheBadDingo,3,Sun Jul 19 21:32:46 2015 UTC,Please make him post a DIY of those mirrors! My place had a great spot on the wall where I can place them. It's across from giant floor to ceiling mirrors so the infinite reflection would be awesome.
gaymers,3dtuy6,Altiondsols,2,Mon Jul 20 01:02:17 2015 UTC,"It looks like it's just a regular oval-shaped mirror, remove the frame or border and line behind the edge with flex neon.  Adjust distance from the wall until the width of the light looks like a portal."

gaymers,3dxkjx,CrewSatyr,4,Mon Jul 20 19:52:06 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed Monster, although it has a very different feel to it than what you have watched so far.  But it's super good.  You might also want to check out some classics like Cowboy Bebop or Trigun."
gaymers,3dxkjx,Spikbot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:15:45 2015 UTC,"added to my list, thanks. i have seen a bit of an episode of  cowboy bebop and at the time i didn't think it to be worth my time but ill give it another go though."
gaymers,3dxkjx,atomicxblue,2,Mon Jul 20 12:40:49 2015 UTC,"I just started God Eater and Rokka: Braves of the Six Flowers. There aren't any gay characters (that we know of.. haha there seems to be that one younger guy who is infatuated with the leading man in most anime recently) but they were interesting.   Samurai Flamenco was amazing and I totally did not see the ending until it happened. <3 You should watch No. 6!! It's about two boys.. and yeah, I don't want to give away any more than that. Seriously, close reddit and go watch it! You'll also want to read the Beyond book that came out afterwards. (You will want to.. trust me. After watching the anime I went and read all 9 novels + Beyond. http://9th-ave.blogspot.nl/p/no-6.html)  I really loved Owari no Serah for the storyline and beautiful animation. There's a bit of a will he won't he question brewing, that's even commented on by a character. Second season is also greenlit for the fall. Hmmm.. K (Project) was really good if you like watching boys fight it out with magic. (Also another season later this year). Arslan Senki has beautiful animation and a very interesting story. It's set in a fictional version of Persia / Middle East in the ancient past. (The prince's main bodyguard... I wish I had a guy that protective of me.. let's just say..)  If you liked Samurai Flamenco, check out Binan Koukou Chikyuu Bouei Bu Love (Cute Highschool Earth Defense Club). The entire series is a huge parody on magical girl anime, but with boys. Even their transformations are timed to the second to the original Sailor Moon anime. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etjppBOyjO0) Oh, also check out Assassination Classroom. (I love love love love love this one!)  I know I'll probably think of tons more as soon as I click save but this should be enough to get you started."
gaymers,3dxkjx,atomicxblue,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:31:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks! i started watching Assassination Classroom and it was good but i was really on the mood for Fairy Tail, so i didn't watch any more but i might soon, i have written down all the suggestions and will get to watching them eventually(sooner rather than later). Thanks!"
gaymers,3dxkjx,atomicxblue,2,Mon Jul 20 11:45:59 2015 UTC,(I noticed I made a typo. Owari no Serah should be Owari no Seraph.)  I hope that you enjoy them! I wish I could draw characters like some in these series. (I'm curious to see what you think of Nagisa in Assassination Classroom when he meets Karma. All I'm saying...)
gaymers,3dxkjx,atomicxblue,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:10:43 2015 UTC,"i watched that episode today, i think that Nagisa might, just maybe, possibly, have a thing for Karma."
gaymers,3dxkjx,atomicxblue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:39:14 2015 UTC,So you saw it too then? haha I'm glad it wasn't just me reading too much into it.

I usually skip past the intros and outros after the first few times seeing it, but this is one series I watched it every single time. I'm just amazed at the timing it took to plan out all the movements and positions of the characters."

gaymers,3dxkjx,th3xile,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:44:53 2015 UTC,"oh and the ending for samurai flamenco was a good one, took me by surprise as well!"
gaymers,3dxkjx,CrewSatyr,2,Mon Jul 20 11:48:26 2015 UTC,"That reminds me. I need to seek out the manga so I can continue the story. We need more ""regular people"" anime like this. (I don't want to give away the ending in case someone hasn't seen it.)"

I'm usually not a fan of horror anime, but this one is definitely intriguing - the story line is enigmatic and gripping, and so I find myself wanting to watch more just to see what the writers are gonna throw at me next.  Character development isn't bad, but it's really the concept and the story line that are, for me, really captivating."
gaymers,3dxkjx,benrchee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:53:49 2015 UTC,"i have heard Tokyo Ghoul is good but i haven't had time to watch it, im going to have to make time now though, thanks!"

gaymers,3dwgva,Hybrid38,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:23:31 2015 UTC,out of curiosity why did u say add awakening as if people did not like it? awakening sold so well and was so well received that its the reason we are getting more fire emblem games. if it didn't do well the series would have been shut down.
gaymers,3dwgva,Hybrid38,2,Mon Jul 20 11:58:35 2015 UTC,"I assume you don't frequent FE discussion forums? ""Awakening ruining the series"" is a common complain from mostly old FE players and I kinda agree, it panders to casual crowd and a very special jap-like crowd. (Ahem, thanks to the waifus). While I don't like any of those, I don't get angry, but there is not common, a lot of people get angry at those  Sure, did awakening saved the series? Yes. Did Awakening exchanged neat core FE stuff for keep living? That too  Thankfully Fates sems to cater to both old and new public, so I'm excited!"

gaymers,3dwgva,CoalmineXIII,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:21:37 2015 UTC,"See.. Idk, i didn't think it ruined it because i still had all the old options.. being able to relevel myself for more stats did make it quite easy, especially since your avatar could become super broken. but in lunatic and lunatic+ that was a needed to survive. IDK, I am an old FE fan, I've palyed every NA FE release. and awakening was one of my favorites, blazing swords will always be number one tho.. =P"
gaymers,3dwgva,mijobell,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:40:49 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't think it ruined the series, but it is a controversial anyway.  Lunatic+ was reset the game until you get doable enemies and grind, as oposed to other Hard mdoes in the series wich relied in tactics and unit placement"

gaymers,3dsumf,DeeperThanGlitz,3,Sun Jul 19 06:04:26 2015 UTC,"Next time I wouldn't do a cold open with 'your hair is AMAZING'  Maybe he was taken? Maybe he lost his phone in an unfortunate stock pot incident...  Good lucky next time, though. You know what they say: if at first you don't succeed, get hungry, go out to eat and leave your number again!"
gaymers,3dsumf,captaincanuck89,4,Sun Jul 19 12:45:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe he was taken   Shit, dude, OP needs to use his very specific set of skills to save this guy, only then will they be together."

gaymers,3duhn7,YourPassportNumber,2,Sun Jul 19 16:30:00 2015 UTC,"A lot of 3ds games are casual or can be played casually. Tomodachi Life is a cute little game but gets boring quickly and doesn't have multi-player. Animal Crossing, Mario Kart, and SSB were the games I came here to recommend."
