Can we see the original version ? This one looks ""over-photoshoped""..."
CemeteryPorn,3dzyfy,RoxSpirit,2,Tue Jul 21 14:07:40 2015 UTC,"Here ya go   It was shot and processed on my phone. Used software to get the depth of field, and added a filter I thought fit the image. But I do like the unprocessed as well."
CemeteryPorn,3dzyfy,RoxSpirit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:13:14 2015 UTC,"I prefer this one.  The ""depth of field filter"" is odd on the other and the colour on the original are beautiful. The only ""filter"" deserved is maybe to play with the level.   Also, try to get a DSLR ! (I know, they're bigger than the HTC and are not free, but the photo are far far better !)"
CemeteryPorn,3dreme,deep_sea_fangly_fish,4,Sat Jul 18 18:56:42 2015 UTC,"Album of very un-professional pictures I snapped with my phone.  The church dates to the 1170s-80s, and is one of the oldest in Oxford. It's really in the middle of nowhere, just an idyllic suburb accessible by a long walk along the river from the city center. Lots of beautiful buildings on the way there, but the age of the church itself took my breath away.  Couldn't tell you how old the gravestones themselves are; the oldest legible ones went back to the 18th/17th century. Most were completely worn over."

CemeteryPorn,3dl161,Psandysdad,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:07:20 2015 UTC,"It is one of the  hallways of the mausoleum. It is an entirely amazing edifice. The glass fronted cabinets are individual 1'x1'x1' boxes for urns with personal photos and keepsakes, some very touching, all beautiful. The opening on the aside of the all are crypt vaults with  nice stained glass. The wood paneling is amazing, the lights are Jewish stars and the marble is loaded with fossils. Everything is spotless and near perfect. The variety of styles and materials is also incredible. Architects should visit to see how it's done, when it is done in this style."

No lie, there is no place more lovingly cared for or architecturally spectacular, and it is just plain beautiful. They have a directory of distinguished residents book (they gave me a copy), and will be using my photos on their website and Facebook page!"

This was cut from a 34 ton block of granite by Rock of Ages in Barre, VT. The cost of Ray Tse's Mercedes was $250,000. The stone car was cut using an actual Mercedes to ensure it was flawless and exactly to scale. The only things missing from this car are the hood ornament and the side mirrors as vandals could break off these parts and time could wear them away to breaking."

I didn't get to explore all the parts of the city, but I did stay in the downtown where tourists like myself flock to. So much stores dedicated to witchcraft and the history of the witch trials. Makes me wonder how those people during the trials would feel about their city becoming infamous due to the hangings."

I don't recall any non-English headstones - I looked through the photos I took there and didn't see any - but it wouldn't surprise me if there were some German or Dutch ones among them.  There were hundreds of headstones there - I only photographed a small number."
CemeteryPorn,38leq9,Tenchiro,2,Thu Jun 4 23:42:53 2015 UTC,Might have been a receiving tomb. Once upon a time before heavy machinery it was hard to dig graves in the winter - so bodies might be stored until spring allowed digging.
