insideJorahshead,3cw4up,idealistic723,59,Sat Jul 11 07:19:16 2015 UTC,"As much tin foil as there is here, I can totally see GRRM making this happen because he doesn't mind destroying (not killing per se, but destroying everything they stand for) our favorite characters. Picture this: Jon becomes the Night King (AKA Snow Wight) and Dani takes Westeros. In the panic of the 2nd Long Night, Dani becomes the Mad Queen and wants to burn the North or something to stop Jon and his army of Others. J-bear puts up with her shit for a while, then realises that it's too much and she's no longer the queen he vowed to serve, and that he has to kill her to stop her madness.   And Lightbringer? Well guess what family has a valyian steel sword? House Mormont does. Jon has longclaw right now, but if he's an Other now then he won't keep a sword of Dragon fire. So J-bear has to kill Dani with longclaw (thus bathing his family's sword in the blood of not only a dragon but his love for the good of westeros), then he beats Jon as the prince that was promised. Jon is still the song of ice and fire, Dani is still a targaryen, and J-bear and house Mormont are redeemed. I'd love to see Quaithe in there somewhere too, but I think Mel is our resident red priestess so I doubt she'll be in westeros. Tinfoil may be removed now."
insideJorahshead,3cw4up,XxdisfigurexX,6,Sat Jul 11 10:52:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know man. Multiple sources quite specifically state that Azor Ahai will wake dragons from stone. I figured it might be the case if Jorah was the one to light Drogo's pyre at Dany's command, but that's not how it happened. So far Jorah really doesn't fit the prophecy very well, nowhere near as well as Dany or Jon. Lightbringer might not even be a sword at all, according to Maester Aemon."

insideJorahshead,3cw4up,XxdisfigurexX,2,Sat Jul 11 23:45:27 2015 UTC,"-Crams tinfoil hat back on-  I always thought three half-grown dragons vs. a huge, ever-growing army of magic ice zombies were still pretty dubious odds... I personally think ""dragons from stone"" refers to volcanoes. Ajorah Hai (or lbr, more likely Jon) sacrifices Dany, releasing the magic in her Targ's blood. This ""wakes"" Westeros' volcanoes, causing eruptions both at Dragonstone and beyond the Wall, which destroys the Others for good. The Wall melts, and normal seasons return. Erryone else who didn't evacuate is dead, but Bran & the Children survive and rebuild Westeros lol."
