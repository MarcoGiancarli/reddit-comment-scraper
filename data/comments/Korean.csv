Korean,3e5qr8,b_author,2,Wed Jul 22 04:06:59 2015 UTC,"I don't have much experience in cover letters and such, but here's my opinion on the matter. I hope to see other people comment on it too.   1) Yes, the sentences should end in 다/까 for formality.   2) I feel like for the 저는 part, it all depends on the context. If it's too repetitive, you probably should take some out, combine the sentences and such else. (as an example, something like 저는 엑셀을 사용할 수 있습니다.  저는 포토샵에 능숙합니다. 저는 비디오 편집도 잘 합니다. - > 저는 엑셀을 사용할 수 있으며 포토샵에도 능숙합니다. 또한 비디오 편집도 잘 사용합니다.)   3) In my personal opinion, I think ""담당자님(께)"" sound better.   I hope it helps."

Korean,3e42u7,justsomeguyonreddit1,6,Tue Jul 21 20:15:08 2015 UTC,"Taken from Korean Grammar in Use: Intermediate:  When using 도록, ""the action stated in the preceding clause is the speaker's goal or reason for doing the action stated in the following clause. It's interchangeable with ~게.""  To me, it translates as ""in a way that"" or ""such that"".   음식이 모자라지 않도록 충분히 준비해라. Prepare enough food so that we don't run out.   On the other hand, 만큼 ""is used to indicate that the action or state described in the preceding clause is similar or equivalent to that stated in the following clause.""   To me, this is more ""as much as"". However, keep in mind that when translating both of these grammatical terms into English, there can be overlap.    돈을 많이 내는 만큼 좋은 서비스를 받을 수 있을 것이다. To the extent that you pay for it, you should receive good service.   The clear difference between these two is that 만큼 highlights a degree or extent while ~도록 highlights a goal or objective. Both however describe how an action proceeds.  EDIT: a word"
Korean,3e42u7,Wzzch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:21:15 2015 UTC,Thanks! That's very helpful!
Korean,3e42u7,Wzzch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:36:54 2015 UTC,What about sentences/phrases like:  바나나를 질리도록 먹었어요.  I ate so much banana to the point where I got sick of it.   and  목이 아프도록 노래를 불렀어요.  I sang until/to the point where my throat hurt.   Both of these use 도록 but indicate and extent (or result?)  How does this compare with 만큼?
Korean,3e42u7,b_author,4,Tue Jul 21 21:48:03 2015 UTC,"Ahh! Those sentences are from TTMIK. According to Lesson 7.29, extent is also a function of ~도록.   Welp, I'm stumped. Perhaps towards native speakers, some hidden nuances or implications are clear. However, that difference I indicated above is all I can say.   There is one other difference I can state. 만큼 can also be used with nouns, which 도록 can't.   나는 형만큼 축구를 잘한다."
Korean,3e42u7,Wzzch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:54:21 2015 UTC,"here, 형 is a noun, and 만큼 is a particle, forming ""as much as my brother"".  도록 does not work like this at all, i don't think.   if you said something like 형이 하도록 you could create ""to the extent that my brother does"" i guess, but you have to add that verb 하다 there for it to work."
Korean,3e42u7,MyJokesArentFunny,2,Wed Jul 22 06:53:30 2015 UTC,"형이 하도록 could work just as well. But according to MyJokesArentFunny, 도록's function of expressing extent is less common than its other functions. Therefore, in most cases it can mean ""so that 형 does it"" rather than ""to the extent that 형 does it"", indicating an objective more so than degree.   넌 형도 하도록 숙제를 규칙적으로 해라.  넌 형이 하는맘큰 숙제를 규칙적으로 해라.  (규칙적 might or might not be the right word here, but I think you get what I mean)  In this case, their meanings can't overlap. The first states to get 형 to do the work while the second states to do it just as often as 형."
Korean,3e42u7,b_author,2,Wed Jul 22 07:20:29 2015 UTC,This usage is not as common as the 도록 usage the guy above posted about. Using 정도 or 만큼 is much more common.
Korean,3e42u7,rsl12,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:38:18 2015 UTC,"can 만큼 attach directly to verbals?  my understanding is that 만큼 is a particle (or post-position) that attaches to noun (nominal) forms similarly to  만.  도록 is a clausal conjunction for linking verbs and verb clauses, meaning ""in order to"" or ""to the point of""...in fact, quite a different grammatical form entirely.  oh, and 만큼 also can act as a bound noun for the same kind of meaning of ""extent"" or ""degree""... (similar to 정도 in this kind of case, I believe..)"
Korean,3e2u84,Neivler,6,Tue Jul 21 15:07:35 2015 UTC,"I was recommended the ""Korean Grammar in Use"" series by someone else in the subreddit. I find it much easier to study from than the Integrated Korean books."
Korean,3e2u84,Gobluebro,2,Tue Jul 21 21:58:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Seems like the Yonsei book is best for now. I will go to some korean classes and get more speaking practice there, so a book that focuses on grammar and reading would be the best for me now I think. Also what Yonsei is famous for. I will look at the pdf files.  Planing to go to the big bookstore in Gangnam within the week. Can you get the Yonsei book outside of the Yonsei book store?   I really liked how the Sogang books had a little grammar leaflet on the side. Makes looking up the grammar so much easier and to do a fast review. Any similar for the Yonsei book, or anywhere else I can get anything similar? Good to have on the side while I read the main study book."
Korean,3e2u84,sandler425,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:59:49 2015 UTC,"Oh you're in Korea? I am too, in that case you could just do what I do and read the textbooks and copy notes from all of them while still in the bookstores in Korea and then never pay for them.  That's how I managed to read all these books, besides taking classes.  Yonsei books can be found in all the major bookstores, as can pretty much everything except Integrated Korean I guess.  There are many, many other textbook series as well. You should check out the bookstore and see, there are many to choose from with different styles. The Yonsei books have 6 levels, and each level has a book for reading, 2 books for grammar and general conversaion, and 2 workbooks. So they are rather expensive, but buying the reader and grammar book for each level is worth it. That's why they're so in depth.  They also explain the grammar concepts of each chapter at the end of each chapter, so you can flip to the last page of each chapter for review.  Books 1-3 are in English/Chinese/Japanese and books 4-6 are all in Korean. I believe they correlate with the TOPIK levels, approximately, but they are definitely intended for use in the Yonsei classrooms. Also note: there are other textbook series by Yonsei for Korean, but the one I and everyone else refers to is the one with 6 levels, etc., the main one most bookstores carry.  Another thing I should mention: The Seoul National University books might be worth checking out too.  I only kinda read one, for vocab. words only, but it seemed not bad.  Anyway bookstores have all these books so you can get whatever you need at any of them."
Korean,3e2u84,afreecaTV_Char,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:40:44 2015 UTC,"I am leaving soon, so I dont have time to look through that many now. I wanted to know what books to buy, so that I could bring them home and continue with my Korean and not have to pay a lot to import them.  I found the SNU books lacking in grammar explanation. And without a teacher they seemed lacking (only did 2A). But the 60 hour (night course books) SNU books seemed nice. Simple, good, and focusing on the most important in a condensed manner.  You know where I can get the Yonsei books the cheapest? Is it cheaper in the Yonsei book store, or is the price similar everywhere?"

Korean,3e3jtc,iamkoalafied,2,Wed Jul 22 02:46:21 2015 UTC,"That's... not true. 나/내 is 반말 and 저/제 + 요 is 존댓말. You aren't supposed to mix them. Maybe in some slightly informal situations it's ""okay"" but it still isn't grammatically correct. So I'd say it does matter."
Korean,3e3jtc,Pikmeir,-2,Wed Jul 22 03:07:58 2015 UTC,"Actually, no.  Once you get more into Korean and start speaking with people, you'll realize that the rules governing the politeness aren't as strict as you thought. An example of this is mixing 나/내 with 요."
Korean,3e3jtc,Pikmeir,3,Wed Jul 22 03:55:54 2015 UTC,"Just chiming in to let you know this is not correct. 나/내 are used when speaking down to a person younger than you (such as 반말) and 요 is used for showing respect (typically in polite speech, but not always). Using 나/내 with 요 isn't grammatically incorrect in certain situations (much older person speaking to a younger person, using 나/내 but wanting to sound polite with 요) but it is not a polite way to speak - more proper is 저/제 with 요. edit: spelling"

When I watch a TV show or a video where a korean is speaking naturally in his language, I can directly see that I can't speak like they do.  If I can understand what they say, one could think that I'd be able to adjust my speaking to speak like they do. Well, I guess I do do that, but the process is sooooo slow.  That's my 2원 for whatever it's worth."

Korean,3dwr71,Trevarr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:33:10 2015 UTC,"Yup. These are just shifts in modern Korean pronunciation. Most of them are very regular, though, so you only have to memorize the rules, not just a handful of words.   For example, the words you mentioned, 조건, 사건, and others like 효과 and 여권, 여과... These all go from ㄱ --> ㄲ because of the same rule. The rule is a ""new"" one, in that sticklers don't think it's proper yet despite widespread usage, though there is possibly a generational difference.   There are a ton of blogs and articles about these kinds of rules online, and some linguistics research, too. It's actually kind of fun to compare the descriptivist and prescriptivist perspectives. But I only know of Korean resources on this topic, I haven't looked in English before. I can link anyone who's interested but fair warning that most of it is full of 전문용어. If you want to probe around yourself, just start with ""효과 효꽈"" and you'll get alllll kinds of search results.

Korean,3dw1ib,s3nn8,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:51:50 2015 UTC,"I'm a new learner myself and here's what I've understood so far (I may be wrong): The sounds you have mentioned are in general an in-between sound, eg. ㄷ is not a strong d sound but neither a soft t sound it's in between like a really soft d sound. From word to word it may lean towards d or t more than it is in general depending on the word, for example what is the next letter or if it is the last consonant. After hearing a few words with these letters you will start to see some patterns and will be able to predict how it will sound. Have this in mind, the way they sound each time is not random, small things like this Koreans do for the flow of speech, so if it's more natural to pronounce ㄷ as t in a word that's probably what they will say. You will learn later (if you haven't already) that they even change letters to make the flow of sound when you speak more fluent. The first example I learned this, is when I came across some irregulars. An example is the word 걷다 which means to walk, 걷다 is in dictionary form as it is, if you change it in informal present tense it becomes 걸어. I don't know if the particular example is a good one but in some of these irregulars the teacher in the site I use to study says it's for the reason I stated above. To have flow in speech. I hope I helped and didn't confuse you."

Korean,3dwj9z,PvtUnternehmer,3,Mon Jul 20 03:06:37 2015 UTC,"I like Trevarrs explanation. Theyre super important until theyre not important, then it becomes super important to not use them. They show that you consider someone HIGHER than you, and if you dont use it you show that youre equal at best. Thats why people used to be killed for not addressing their king or whoever with this form of speech. But you cant just use them whever you want to be nice, if you use it on a friend theyre gonna feel distant. And youre fucked if youre with all friends but some are older and some are younger and you wanna talk to everyone. Then you need to be careful to use them but not use them at the same time!  Yeah its confusing. We cant just explain Korean culture just like that, and this is more of a cultural linguistic thing than a plain old linguistic thing.   If youre asking how to conjugate it? There are like six different forms. To koreans they are all called 존댓말. 요 is 존댓말. 습니다 is 존댓말. There are special words for them too like 말씀 instead of 말.  There are humble forms that you can only use for yourself like 드리다 instead of 주다. There is plain old 하시다 instead of 하다 and 하십니다 instead of 습니다. There is a lot to it dude.   If you want the most basic explanation, 하시다 aka 하십니다 or 하세요 is the basic honorific. Adding in 시 and conjugating properly is all it takes. Look up conjugation patterns and learn well. It is more important to learn context and proper usage though which Trevarr did nice and succinctly. Just be more clear about what you want next time instead of downvoting the poor 바보 트롤.  And why is 존댓말 a 걸음돌 to 한국어 becoming your 세번째 외국어?  EDIT: this is seriously the most difficult part of Korean both as a language and a country, by far. And having worked with many five year olds from Korea, those kids dont get it either and its their L1. it isnt something that can just be explained away. You need to figure out contexts and meanings. The best answer i can give you is that you add 시 to a verb but that just feels horribly 부족하다."

Additionally if you are speaking to a superior, some grammar patterns change to convey greater respect for the person with whom you are speaking.   In other words, the usage of honorifics varies on the topic at hand AND the person you're speaking to.

Korean,3dtebc,j_wi,6,Sun Jul 19 07:20:48 2015 UTC,"Oh boy do I have thoughts about that. At first I thought rules were stiff as well and I couldn't be more wrong. But after the initial confusion and getting better overall at Korean, I've got a few ideas to share :   Like another poster said, some situations are just clear cut and belong to both ends. Out with your school 동갑 ? 반말 all the way. But if there is a person you don't know even if this person might be of a similar age, don't forget your 높임말 on top of your 존댓말. Even for just the first bits of dialogue, it's just how I saw it go. It dropped as quickly as drinks were yet at the very beginning that's how it started.   I had an interview last week, it's mostly 격식체. But here's the catch, you can't actually go full 격식체 on a grammar perspective because all forms don't have a 격식체 equivalent. Of course you can change 해요 to 합니까 but you can't change 하죠 / 는데요 / 할까요 for example. I do concede that this argument is a little weak. My point is that grammar points you'll use to convince or have a livelier dialogue are usually ending with 요 (하죠 / 하잖아요 for super common ones). I was actually told by my teacher that as a guy adressing an older guy, I should try to pepper some 격식체 here and there if possible. Or to work on pronouncing my 요 like guys would do (that's a side effect of having only female teachers).   Another tidbit I noticed is that there are spoken words that aren't actually intended (for lack of a better word) to be used towards the other person. I've never, ever heard someone say 답답해요. The frustrated person would say 답답하다 in a smaller voice and other people would say towards the person stuff like 답답하겠죠. I keep forgetting how to use 구나 / 군요 as opposed to 네요 but the easy way out is using 네요 towards someone (with the infamous 한국말 잘 하시네요) and 구나 as if you were talking to yourself. Of course this kind of self exclamation doesn't occur in every situation but in my experience happens in situation when both 반말 and 존댓말 might be used seemingly interchangeably.   The common situation I see 반말 and 존댓말 used both in conjunction are events like a dinner but since you're with 오빠 and 언니, you're supposed to use 존댓말 towards them. Your normal setting should be that of sharpening your 요s. In this scenario I've noticed that the ""warmer"" it gets, the more 반말 gets used. But that state is fluid as can be the mood of a party. If after that you have to talk for some more random thing, then 존댓말 is better.   When I started learning, I lived with an old guy (legit my parent's age) and he'd use 반말 towards me. As a noobling I didn't get it and using what I know, I'd 반말 my way back to him. When I learned that I might have been impolite I apologized to him and he said ""duh we live together 반말 is fine !"". I don't have many friends but weirdly enough I've actually never heard people go by asking ""shall we use 반말 with each other ?"". At best, two koreans that didn't know themselves would ask each others' age (hence actually answering indirectly the question). But the confusing thing from what I've noticed is that even if they figured out who was older, doesn't mean that the older person has to 반말. He/She can, but what I've seen is mainly the 반말 and 존댓말 according to the current mood.   Then there's 높임말. From what I've seen, 높임말 and 반말 only get used if you're talking ""highly"" about someone to someone you use 반말 with. But even then, it's sometimes weird, why would you highlight to your friends that you're talking respectfully about your parents? I've been told I was overly polite when I did that, but is it a bad thing ? Frankly I don't know. As a white foreigner, I get my pass for anything so I crave these insights that I'm usually not given.  But ! I've encountered 높임말 with 존댓말 coming from a friend I usually 반말 my way with. Why ? He was asking if I could get her a coffee before meeting up and that she'll repay blabla, basically a request. I get the logic, you're ""lowering yourself"" because it's a request. But this ""lowering"" isn't permanent, it's politeness. Then combine it with negative questions and you get what girls say all the time (I don't have many guy friends to observe).   These are my thoughts. As a white foreigner I can't really upset people unless I go blatantly full retard so I had to observe a lot. I hope I'm not too much off. I don't have much thoughts about the uses of the ""neutral form"" in speech when it's not about adjectives, I can't figure that out except for reported speech (which can be your own thoughts that are ""reported""...). So I'll take any help on those."
Korean,3dtebc,Mimmiron,2,Sun Jul 19 12:20:28 2015 UTC,"Lots of great insight! On the point about 높임말+반말, in my personal experience I'd agree that it's a bit overkill to use it to talk respectfully about your own parents (althought I've still seen it done many, many times). But I'd say it's a lot more common to combine the two if you were talking to your 동갑 about their own parents, or grandparents, or other family members. Since I don't know my friend's parents/grandparents very closely at all, it only makes sense for me to respect them with 높임말 because it would be way too weird to disrespect them by not using it.   (You probably already know this, but I'm commenting for the sake of OP and other people who might be curious as to in what situations the combination would more likely be used.)"
Korean,3dtebc,ilaeriu,3,Sun Jul 19 21:45:23 2015 UTC,"I think you'll get a few different opinions here because everyone has different experiences, and many won't have genuine exposure like you do. Also many beginners may misunderstand when a speaker is talking to themselves as using 반말 to the other person. Just as you say, it's something that can depend on the relationship with others and especially with family it will be more flexible because you are so close. I don't want say too much but thought I'd just preface before others comment by adding that."
Korean,3dtebc,MotivatorNZ,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:32:27 2015 UTC,"yup! the amount of flexibility on the rules definitely depends on how close you are, since people are less likely to care how respectful you are to them.

Korean,3dtebc,kdkmmt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:20:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly. Same with formal/informal distinction.   Obviously in very clear cut occasions (meetings with the President, talking to your military commander) you stick to the most formal and most respectful form and tone. Vice versa for close friends/young children.   But in many situations mixing, to various degree, 격식체, 비격식체, 반말, 존댓말 is completely normal, depending on your closeness and the formality of the particular situation. I was very surprised too when I first observed it, but when I thought about it a little more it does make sense."
Korean,3dtebc,kdkmmt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:56:34 2015 UTC,"you're totally right. The use of language, just like in english if you think about it, changes constantly varying on the mood and setting and various other factors. if isn't not too much trouble, it would be nice if you or someone else could explain 격식체 and 비격식체?

Korean,3dtebc,gOwj2n8nQ,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:15:49 2015 UTC,"No problem haha. 격식체 is just the name for the ~ㅂ니다/습니다, ~ㅂ시다,~십시오 etc. conjugation. 비격식체 is usually the ~아/어/여요 and ~아/어/여 forms. For example, 갑니다 is in 격식체 and 가요 and 가 in 비격식체."

Korean,3dtebc,Korean_Anon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:34:58 2015 UTC,"yeah, I mean younger people tend to have more free mindsets (perhaps, like you said, having to do with western exposure) and the constant use of polite speech can sometimes be really restricting which young people like teenagers and little kids don't like."

Korean,3dtoj7,icecreamsmart,5,Sun Jul 19 10:36:29 2015 UTC,"in addition to that link you got earlier, i'd like to give a more general type of advice. when you're just starting out, since you're still excited about learning a new language, you might want to cram as much information as you can in a short amount of time. my advice would be to ignore that urge and take it slow but steady. this is because you'd get into the habit of studying only when you have motivation and if i'm honest, this is a very unreliable method. there will come a time where you'll want to give up because you're not seeing progress or because it's too hard, and absolutely nothing can power you through that except dedication. ok, so you might be thinking to yourself ""haha, no problem! i'm perceptive to languages so i'll probably see progress most of the time"". well, let me tell you, i'm exactly the same way and korean isn't a language that comes easily to anyone. even if you've studied japanese extensively before moving on to korean, the grammar is only similar on a surface level.  TL;DR would be: take it slow and steady and don't give up. everyone goes through growth pains, and you will too, and you gotta power through that if you're serious about the language. i wish you good luck and i hope you'll have fun with this new process <3"

Korean,3dtoj7,random117,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:32:29 2015 UTC,"Hi! Loved the article -- however, I've been falling into the opposite trap. I'm finding difficulty constructing sentences because I'm the linguist type, and I study grammatical structures far more than working to burn a word into my memory. Should I start to work on memorizing words, or just stick with what I've been doing and wait to comprehend the words through context?  Also, not sure if this is the right place to ask this - I'm new here."
Korean,3dtoj7,Somniantis27,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:12:59 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for reading.  You are on the right track being in the situation that you are. I think it is pretty common to feel that your vocabulary is lacking. As you learn more grammar, your sentences start to become longer and closer to how you would naturally express yourself, so you'll need more words under your belt to complete this.   I would keep learning through context no matter what. If you feel like you have enough grammar under your belt you should test this theory out and start chatting with natives. Use a dictonary to help you with words you don't know, and if you have a good handle on grammar you should be able to have a decent conversation (even if it will feel slow). When you get corrections from your mistakes, or if you see them using new words, make note of them and start to study them. This way you'll continue learning through context.  Committing lots of words to memory is difficult, so don't get discouraged if you aren't retaining everything you study... I think a goal of 5-10 new words a day on average is a pretty solid goal."

There's even rules for whether to use ㅔ or ㅐ that even I can't sometimes keep straight.  Writing foreign words in Korean is way less literal then you think. It's not what sounds the closest to the word; rather, it's what sounds the most natural to a Korean speaker. A good example of this is writing ""Batman"" in Korean. It would make the most sense to write it as 뱉맨, but this is pretty awkward to both read and speak. So it's written 배트맨 instead.  As for your comment, 이안 is most used. 이은, not so much."

Like to eat, to sleep, to learn , to teach , to study, to go, to come, to live, to write etc. Then to practice you can subtract the da ending  and place in the new grammar point you just learned to make a new meaning or tense."

Usually the lesson PDF will contain the extra vocabulary that they don't talk about. But to be honest I don't think we're expected to be speak the sample dialog. It's just there for listening practice to test if we can understand the gist of what they're talking about. The key expression track is designed for speaking practice."

Yeah there's tons, I wouldn't worry about them too much though, because if you know how to pronounce everything but still can't make the sentence ""I like cats"", what's the point of all that ""knowledge"". Get started here --> http://redd.it/18n2jv Gobilly Korean books also have a laundry list of pronunciation rules with slightly diff explanations, maybe that's more your style.  Anyway, best explanation I've ever heard for ㅅ is to rest the tip of your tongue right at the top of the gums of your bottom front teeth and go for the ""S"" (don't move your tongue). You'll notice that when you try to pronounce 시 the ""sh"" sound appears, but youll also notice that if you try to say ""사라"" versus ""Sarah"", the first S sound is softer. English S is actually closer to ㅆ imo.  But yeah don't worry about pronunciation too much before you can really even communicate at a basic level, saying it ~decently ok~ is more important than not being able to say anything at all with perfect pronunciation!"

Korean,3dq0hp,kortochgott,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:56:25 2015 UTC,"Seeing as I'm a native speaker, I can't offer much on how to adjust your pronunciation, but the English s is often too strong to be ㅅ. It's much more like ㅆ, especially in cases like ""so,"" ""sausage"", ""set"", etc. Non native speaker's pronunciation is often characterized by ㅆ instead of ㅅ. Snake IMO is not really a great word for comparison because the s is not attached to a vowel, but all consonants in Korean must come with a vowel."

The second covers a lot of the different nuances of Korean phonology and how different sounds interact.  To answer your question, though, by using English approximations (since others have already put some of the IPA symbols) ""ㅅ"" sounds like: * a very soft ""s"" as an initial consonant USUALLY. This is very difficult to explain and understand, so you really have to practice hearing it. * a ""sh"" sound when initial before a diphthong, e.g. 시, 쇼, 셔, 샤, 쉬, etc. * a ""t"" stop when at the end of a syllable USUALLY. It's not an aspirated ""t"", like most English final ""t""s would be. (see ""Some Phonological Notes, section 1"") * an ""n"" when final but preceding a nasal consonant. (see ""Some Phonological Notes, section 2.2"")  I think that covers at least the most common scenarios. Please correct me anyone if I made a mistake somewhere.

Can't we just go home?* These are both questions said while complaining.  The first sentence you provided sounds more polite, because the guy asking suggests that you can 안가요 to 등산, so it's more of a light suggestion(?) which you can decline unlike 등산 같이 갈래요.  I guess an example in English will be something like the differences between ""Want to join us?"" and ""Why don't you join us?"".

Korean,3dnmdn,rkgkseh,2,Fri Jul 17 21:14:23 2015 UTC,"I think the differences are subtle, like you have titled this post. I think 지요 indicates how we would say 'right?', 'isn't it?', 'of course' etc. at the end of a sentence. 'You did your homework, right?' - 숙제를 다 했지? Another example is if I said 김치찌개 아니지(?) There's a semblance of being unsure or perhaps wanting to be confirmed by the person you are talking to (when it's a question). You're maybe 70% sure about something. Or you may not require an answer at all and it's just a way of ending your sentence.   Then if you were to use the same sentence with 잖다, so 김치찌개 아니잖아. It has the feeling of telling someone something they already know. Like 'how can you not remember that you know this?' or 'you totally know this'. Therefore, you know that the person you are talking to is very aware of whatever you are saying. I think because of this, 잖다 would be less common in more formal situations, as it suggests some familiarity between those conversing."
Korean,3dnmdn,rollingkwangsai,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:35:10 2015 UTC,"From what has been explain to me:  지요 is basically an indirect question form, very casual.  어/아 잖아요 is almost contradictory in nature - responding to someone and implying ""it's this way, not that way"".

You are saying, in essence, ""of course you know this, right?"" or even like ""duh! this is common knowledge"" or ""how can you not know this????""  Use that one with care... only with friends, kids, and other intimate-level situations.  지요 is a better choice for polite use, in fact, it is considered ""soft and gentle"" and really can be used for any kind of sentence (declarative, propositive, imperative, exclamative, as well as interrogative)...very useful and super-common.    지 is on the same level as 어/아/해 but more indirect and probably softer.... 지요 likewise with 어요/아요/해요."

Korean,3dpne1,ScribbleBees,2,Sat Jul 18 06:09:27 2015 UTC,"The way you know the correct pronunciation is by listening to native examples and not relying on romanization to learn the sounds. Romanization is inaccurate and confusing (as you have found out). Try learning the sounds from Youtube videos that teach 한글 or something similar, but definitely not romanization.  EDIT: I forgot to add that you aren't looking at different pronunciations of ㅇ. You're looking at two different vowels, ㅣ and ㅜ. However, you can't write vowels alone like that, so you put them with ㅇ, which is a null consonant in those cases."

Korean,3dpne1,AngeloPreyas,-6,Sat Jul 18 06:15:24 2015 UTC,"In this case, I think his name was originally supposed to be 리, but some words in Korean that start with ㄹ were changed as time went on to start with ㅇ. So 리 became 이 eventually, and now that surname is written as 이. Thus why it's spelled Lee in Romanization but pronounced without an L sound.  And another thing is that you're conflating Romanization (which is often inaccurate) to the actual pronunciation. You need to try to avoid Romanization. Learn the alphabet by listening to native speakers say them over and over again rather than relying on unreliable Romanized approximations. 우 is always pronounced like wu/woo... I'm not sure where you got the idea that it sounds like a ""u.""  Oh, and yeah your understanding of ㅇis completely off. It's basically a filler when it's used in the beginning of these words like 이 우 아 어 오. Scribblebees' explanation is correct."

Korean,3dpne1,desperatechaos,3,Sat Jul 18 18:09:52 2015 UTC,우 is always pronounced like wu/woo   This is simply not true.
Korean,3dpne1,theghostofm,0,Sun Jul 19 14:08:40 2015 UTC,Could you provide an example where it isn't? I haven't been able to think of one.
Korean,3dpne1,theghostofm,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:44:06 2015 UTC,"Tons of examples, because it's almost universally pronounced without the w sound. ㅜ is a close back rounded vowel.  You can check this IPA guide for Korean if you want: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_Korean.  ㅇ doesn't change this for 우. 우편 is not ""woo편"" etc.  The name 현우 is commonly romanized to ""Hyun-woo"" but the w is misleading. It is pronounced 혀누, there is no w."
Korean,3dpne1,desperatechaos,2,Sun Jul 19 17:45:22 2015 UTC,"In this case, I think his name was originally supposed to be 리   The surname 이 is romanized in several different ways. Lee is most common.  이명박: Lee Myung-Bak  이승만: Rhee Syngman  이이: Yi I   우 is always pronounced like wu/woo   It's more like practically never. The ""w"" sound does appear in Korean, but in other contexts, like 왕 and 원."
Korean,3dpne1,theghostofm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:03:05 2015 UTC,"You're totally right. I can only think of one situation where 우 is pronounced with a ""w"" sound, and that's only by some koreans, not all.  Where 우 immediately follows another 우, there is sometimes an accidental w transition (such as for 우울하다) when spoken by some natives."
Korean,3dpne1,desperatechaos,0,Mon Jul 20 15:36:00 2015 UTC,"Regardless of romanization, the name was originally historically 리.  As far as the pronunciation of 우, I was using woo as a close approximation of the sound to demonstrate it doesn't sound like an English u."
Korean,3dpne1,theghostofm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:39:01 2015 UTC,"No, it doesn't. But it IS pronounced like the IPA character /u/. ""wu"" is just incorrect."
Korean,3dpne1,b_author,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:33:43 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm not familiar with IPA. And as far as wu I was sort of thinking of it from a Chinese pinyin perspective I guess.

She is Korean-American but both her parents are still Korean citizens, so from what I've read anyone born to a Korean parent is considered a Korean citizen up to a certain point.  Basically what she wants to do is ""Restore Korean Citizenship"" but the information on the Immigration website is different in English and Korean.  For example, the English version doesn't mention any of those dates in the above.  Thanks again."
Korean,3dmcsy,dlwhdgns10,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:09:29 2015 UTC,"Oh, it should be easier since she's female. Citizenship thing got a lot stricter due to draft system (and that's why you see those dates_numerous people tried to avoid draft with loop holes), so it's usually favorable to women. If she was born in USA, she should be an American citizen. Doesn't matter if her parents are Korean or not. So technically, she'd be considered foreigner to Korea. However, Korea does not accept dual citizenship as far as I know, since that's how people avoided draft. Don't quote me on that, since I'm not sure either. :\ She'd have to choose either US citizenship or KR citizenship."

Korean,3dk771,sqlepytt1,2,Thu Jul 16 23:05:32 2015 UTC,Not sure if intentional but there shouldn't be a space between 학생 and 인지. Since it comes from 이다 it should be attached to the noun.
Korean,3dk771,Glitch852,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:35:05 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure you wouldn't use 그가 to indicate a person. To me it sounds like you're referring to a person as ""that"", like an object.

Korean,3dhsos,jgfmondewc,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:59:26 2015 UTC,So what type of word would 상 be classified as without 자 if it's not a noun?
Korean,3dhsos,Pennwisedom,3,Thu Jul 16 19:29:58 2015 UTC,"It is not used alone. It is just a character. It is not a prefix nor a suffix.   In the word, 상자, 상 gives the meaning and 자 makes it a noun.   Like many words in English like completion, it got its meaning from complete and -tion makes it a noun. You can think that the role of 자 here is -tion in English. Those grammar rule characters are called 어조사(it is used a lot in 한자 classes, not Korean classes) as I wrote in my post."
Korean,3dhsos,Pennwisedom,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:04:20 2015 UTC,"Ah thanks, the -tion metaphor made a lot of sense to me! Yeah, when I think of 상 I normally just think of a prize so it was confusing."
Korean,3dhsos,theghostofm,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:06:54 2015 UTC,"The prize, 상 is 賞. They are different characters."
Korean,3dhsos,poopoodomo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:54:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that I'd call it a nominalization. There is no grammatical rule that I can think of in Chinese, or Classical Chinese that would imply this, and there are a handful of nouns that are just one character.   I think the answer actually in Prosody or Euphony. And that they were added more for their sound and how it affected the speaking language rather than as a grammatical tool."
Korean,3dhsos,Pikmeir,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:47:05 2015 UTC,"I used the word, ""nominalization,"" because many people said that 아들 자 in those nouns is used as a 어조사 that makes nouns.   It is hard to guess who and why 자 is added back to those words. Like you said, it is also related with sound(Prosody or Euphony), using single character is not frequent in Korean."

Korean,3djoov,vesamatti,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:28:30 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen an app like that before, so the only thing I could suggest is trying to make your own tests or looking online for an mp3 (probably pirated) from another language course. Were you looking to test your listening to spelling skills? So hearing 뜽 and not thinking it's 등? Or hearing a whole sentence and writing it out with near enough accuracy, like they have on duolingo?   I personally use anki cards, and there are already loads of preloaded options for learning korean words. It works pretty much just like a flashcard, but on your device. I've also used Koreanbuilder, the database of words isn't too plentiful, but they have a lot of basic words and phrases and because of the nature of the app, it's really helpful in building a sentence using different levels of speech and grammar. It's also really good because it has audio (that doesn't sound like a robot).   Other than that, I'm impartial to using google translate or naver dictionary with words I'm unsure about and then hoping for the best. Naver has audio as well, so you can hear the pronunciation of the word. Then I just put the new words in my anki flashcards and test myself.   I hope I helped in some way???"

Korean,3djoov,rollingkwangsai,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:08:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unfortunately Korean isn't on duolingo.   It's hard to come across listening to spelling tests as easily.

I suppose other language schools would also have this, but I only know about the Yonsei textbooks."
Korean,3djmcp,justsomeguyonreddit1,2,Thu Jul 16 20:18:38 2015 UTC,"Well, they all mean ""good"" or ""liked""   네(요) is a mild exclamation (sometimes very, very mild) 구나, 군(요) are also exclamations, but sometimes have other interpretations.  most grammar books call them exclamations, but some koreans say they can mean like kind of guesses in some situations... 좋다 is not really ""formal"" although i know some books call it that..it's just ""plain"" and used in writing a lot, by kids sometimes, and by adults similar to intimate style.  i hear 다고 used more often than just 다 endings..다고 is a shortened quotative style (where the reporting verb, such as ""think"" or ""say"" is left off) and can mean like ""I think..."" ""People(they) say...""  or ""It is said that~"" ...it's possible to add 요 to 다고 but not to just 다, by the way."

Korean,3de8a6,b_author,2,Wed Jul 15 17:04:27 2015 UTC,"Of course, nothing in language is black and white, and both make sense and a Korean would understand you. The difference between 는 것 and 기 is very difficult to explain. The more you practice, you can feel when one is better to use than the other. But the best I have for you is that 기 is often used as a fixed expression. Like 말하기, 달리기, etc. It comes more naturally with time! Good luck!"
Korean,3de8a6,b_author,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:39:24 2015 UTC,"In part, it has to do with the time frame involved...는 것 (or any other time you use 는 to form an adnominal from an AV) is usually something ongoing in the present moment...an ongoing activity.  기 is less specific, timeless instead of ongoing...  see what I mean?  Notice, I did qualify this with ""in part"" because this is not the end of the story, I don't think~~ :)  기 is like taking the essence of the activity, the activity itself...for example:  쓰기 writing, 읽기 reading...  that's what I mean by ""timeless"" ...more of a concept than an actual activity that is happening at the moment.  using the nominalizer (으)ㅁ is probably even more abstracted than that...a form like 믿음 means ""belief"" (as opposed to ""believing"")....   I'd look at it that way...levels of abstraction."
Korean,3de8a6,beenzinobenzino,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:12:30 2015 UTC,"so if you were making a general statement about ""speaking"" probably 기 is better, but if you were talking about like ""let's do this now"" maybe 는 것 would make more sense.  if you were actually describing something going on at the moment, like something you heard or saw, definitely 는 것 is better.  see what i mean?"

Korean,3de8a6,beenzinobenzino,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:38:49 2015 UTC,"Isn't ""Practice the korean language"" a little less specific?"
Korean,3de8a6,b_author,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:22:32 2015 UTC,"It sounds more like ""I want to practice my Korean"". It would be like comparing ""I want to practice my English vs I want to practice speaking English"". I guess if you really want to emphasize that you want to practice orally, you would include ""말하기"" but I thought that if you are saying that phrase to a Korean, it is assumed that you want to practice speaking it."

Korean,3dcia2,galacticleofin,7,Wed Jul 15 04:57:32 2015 UTC,"I have no sources, but we discussed our native languages as a lesson in our Korean language Institute class. There was a claim that English had about 3 times the amount of words seen in East Asian languages (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean). Despite the huge gap in amount of words. The teacher said that Korean has about 3 times as many verbs as the English language.   So the conclusion of all this is that to indicate what something is (noun) or how it looks (adjective), English clearly has more descriptive power. But when describing how something is done (verbs) English does not have the nuances of describing the method like Korean does.   For example. We 'close' doors, our eyes, bank accounts, lids, our minds, and games. But perhaps in these cases the verb 'to close' may be different in each.   Again completely unsubstantiated by facts but I'm interested if anyone would agree or has some science to back that up."

One other thing I've noticed from watching English movies with Korean subtitles is that English seems to have many more ways of saying the same thing differently. Although I really doubt this is true, it's probably just lazy translating in the subtitles (it just keeps saying the same thing, even though the person keeps changing what they're saying), plus my lack of exposure to really creative uses of Korean."

I wouldn't say it was formal as it's used among close friends and lovers etc. It suggests genuine curiosity more than 아니에요? which can be quite blunt and could almost be taken as an accusation (although this depends on the context and intonation a lot)."
Korean,3dc2ll,climb026,2,Wed Jul 15 08:13:32 2015 UTC,Very similar but 은가요 is a little more formal and 어요/에요 is a bit more casual.   그런가요? 행복한가요? 더운가요? 기쁜가요? 그래요? 행복해요? 더워요? 기뻐요?

If your level is anything other than beginner, you'll be put into an appropriate class (each week is a separate level-appropriate 'modular' unit of study, so there's no issue with starting halfway through what other people are doing).  If you are a complete beginner, you're put into a small class that focuses entirely on reading and writing in the mornings, followed by 'survival Korean' in the afternoon.  From the second week, you're placed into a low level class with other starting students.  You can study for as long or as short as your want.  They get some students literally just doing a week or so in the Summer, but I'd guess the average would be around 8-10 weeks.  I loved studying there - it was a fantastic experience.  Their website is a bit average, but they have a blog at www.lexisseoul.com and their FB page is pretty regularly updated."

I was doing some work in Korea and my company wanted me to get a little of the language down, which over 12 weeks of study I think I did reasonably well.  You'll have no problems at all in Korea.  There's a real customer service ethic to the place, and the staff at the school will walk over hot coals to make sure you have a good time and don't encounter problems.  I had a reason to call the Director at 10pm one evening, and he actually came over to my house to help me with some urgent paperwork I was struggling with.  It's that kind of place.  The other thing is that there are Korean students studying English programs at the school, too, and they'll buddy you up with someone if you'd like.  This is a seriously good idea, as you get an instant peer group (friends of friends, friends of friends of friends and so on), so there's always someone to show you around or take you out to some 'secret' location or another.

If I have to explain just for clarity, I would say 구경하다 focuses on the activity of ""구경"" (sightseeing/watching etc) itself while 구경가다 focuses more on the activity of ""going"" to somewhere to sightsee/watch. But again, the difference between these two are really negligible in terms of day-to-day use.   Just fyi, you can also say 구경하러가다 which combines 구경하다 and 구경가다."

It is usually used in response to someone's actions or attitude that are rather selfish or very profitable to that person, and I as the observer feel somewhat envious of that person's luck or skill (or shamelessness to pursue something to that extent). For example, if I am stuck on a level of Candy Crush Saga for days and I see my friend clear it the first try, I may say 얄밉다 to my friend. Or, if I'm working as a team with a group of people and the pretty girl in the group acts cute and needy so that other members volunteer to do her portion or assign her the least amount of work, I'd probably say she's 얄밉다. In a sense, when someone is behaving in a way that isn't exactly immoral but still rather selfish, your reaction to that person would be 얄밉다."

Korean,3d32zb,oicueio,14,Mon Jul 13 03:22:12 2015 UTC,"There are a few differences between 굶주린 and 배고파. The first difference is that 배고파 is fully conjugated in 반말, and 굶주린 is not a conjugated verb, but is an adjective. This means they're both in different forms.  So you can just say, ""배고파!"" and it works. But if you were to say, ""굶줄인!"" it would be nonsense, grammatically. To some Koreans, it might even sound like random syllables.  You can bring them to be the same grammatical form from their base verbs:   굶주리다 is the base form of 굶주린.   굶주려 is the 반말 conjugation, the same form as ""배고파"".  배고프다 is the base form of 배고파.   배고픈 is the adjective form, the same form as ""굶주린"".    Even though you can switch forms and they have very similar literal meanings, they're not the same and not really interchangeable.   굶주리다 expresses a state of starvation, having been unable to eat for a long time. (or alternatively, can be idiomatically used for things like ""to hunger for knowledge,"" where 배고프다 can't.) 배고프다 expresses a state of being hungry, but doesn't imply much more than that."

You have to be able to respond to what someone else says as fast as you could do it in your native tongue.  The only way to fully develop this skill is to interact with people in Korean.  I'll bet you know more than you give yourself credit for.  Just try not to overthink it and let the words pour out!  Whoever you're speaking with will correct you, and that really is the best way to learn.  Do you dislike talking to people? I was pretty shy before I started learning Korean, but it's made me a more outgoing person in English, too!  So embrace the opportunity to make new friends and just talk your head off.  Good luck!"
Korean,3d2tdf,Breadincaptivity,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:54:13 2015 UTC,"The only way to fully develop this skill is to interact with people in Korean.   I don't think that's necessary. I only use English for the occasional post on the Internet and I've only recently started speaking English around friends. They can understand me quite well thanks to their school English, but when they try to speak English as well, it is obvious that they didn't read and listen to as much English as I did since we left school.  I'm not saying the interactions I had in school didn't help my English at all. Knowing all that grammar and vocabulary certainly helped when I started actually learning English. But eight years of interacting with people like me, who saw English as just another stupid school subject, whose pronounciation and syntax was more German than English, are pretty much worthless as far as actual fluency goes. Classrooms being the worst possible place to learn a language is a true and proven fact.  Now, after seven years of very heavy exposure to English in my spare time, I would consider myself somewhat fluent. My writing could probably be better and I definitely need more practice speaking English, but none of that fluency originates from interactign with natives. Sure, I do have conversations, mostly written ones, but none of those are about teaching me English and correcting my mistakes. I'm the only one who checks what I write and say for correctness, and what others say to me directly isn't focusing more on improving my English than what some actor says in a TV series.  What I'm saying is that the number one factor in attaining fluency is massive and long-term exposure to native material of that language. It can be through conversations with actual natives, but reading and listening work just as well, as long as it is interestign to you and you have fun doing it. That way, the way the language works will slowly become hard-wired into your brain and you will be able to feel what is a valid construct and what isn't, and you will notice your own mistakes as soon as you make them and do better the next time."

Korean,3d2tdf,feedmefeces,3,Mon Jul 13 04:58:33 2015 UTC,"Hi there I'm from Australia, and I passed level 3 TOPIK, after just over a year of studying by myself (and no Korean friends) with textbooks, Youtube, and flashcards. After that, I came to Korea for 3 months, and just made friends (i.e. I didn't work or go to any formal class). I went back to Australia and used the new textbooks I bought, and did a chapter or two every week, along with ANKI flashcards, and rewatched all the Youtube videos. At that point, I made a couple of new Korean friends in Australia too. I then passed TOPIK level 4 (in the old format). I am now on my fourth year in, and I still haven't done any formal classes, received any tutoring, any homework, and I am passed TOPIK level 5, but I feel like I am learning too many useless things, so I am refocused on studying things like Webtoons, 일상표현, and TV shows for more fun. In terms of fluency, I was able to hold a fairly long conversation after a year, and after two years, I was able to live in a completely Korean environment without any stress, and after four years, I can finally flip between English and Korean.

Korean,3d2tdf,Nimora9,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:21:40 2015 UTC,"Just a note about what you said: There is a passive memory and an active memory. Passive memory involves listening and reading, and active memory involves writing and speaking. For example, if we have 4000 words in our passive memory, we only have 1000 words in our active memory. So when you learn a lot of words or phrases, they sit in your passive memory, and to push them into the active memory, you need to just practice and keep it using it actively (e.g. just write or speak).  So your experience is normal and natural. Now just try to push the stuff you learn into an active memory one by one. I used a lot of Facebook chatting and posting in Korean, and I always went to the nearest Korean shop or hairsalon to practice my new collection of phrases.

Korean,3d2k25,Barraca,10,Mon Jul 13 00:36:19 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't learn more than you're going to need. At a beginning level, I wouldn't recommend drilling vocabulary at all, beyond just a few needed to use the grammar forms you're studying. At a later level, only learn as many as you're going to need. For example, if you write down words you hear in a TV news show, and your goal is to watch TV news in Korean without subtitles, then you'll be able to make a large list every day of tons of words and you can benefit from learning as many of them as possible. However if your goal is to speak Korean in person fluently, then memorizing huge lists of words that will only appear on rare occasions won't work well since you'd end up forgetting them; in that case it'd be better to learn fewer, more useful words."
Korean,3d2k25,Pikmeir,2,Mon Jul 13 00:39:00 2015 UTC,"Hm, well at this point I'd classify myself as intermediate. I can hold conversations but I still can't watch programs that well. I've been studying a little over a year and a half.   I've been using the Anki deck ""1000 most common words"" as of recently, and most of them do seem like commonly used words (according to my girlfriend). I'm just not quite sure how to learn other words. While I can hold a conversation through Skype or the phone, I still have to use a dictionary a good amount, so my goal first is to be able to hold conversations without looking at a dictionary as much, then transition into things like watching the news in Korean or even dramas."
Korean,3d2k25,Wzzch,5,Mon Jul 13 01:06:45 2015 UTC,"I agree with Pikmeir in that whatever your goal is, the route to achieving it can vary. However I also think that as long as you don't tire yourself out, you can increase that cap of yours to however much you want. People are different, and some people have amazing brain capacities that make me feel bad as a personㅠㅠ.   In my experience, I started out memorizing a TON of vocabulary only to find myself exhausted reviewing and reviewing those words on the days following and onwards. So, for that, I made a huge mistake of wasting my time taking lists upon lists of words and cramming them into my head.  Do, however, understand this. If you're aiming to speak Korean conversationally fluently, sole memorization doesn't usually do the work. Practice those words routinely or enough to get a feel on how they fit into your sentences (But if you already do this, that's ok.)"
Korean,3d2k25,Wzzch,2,Mon Jul 13 01:01:00 2015 UTC,"Yep! I already try to memorize then incorporate words into my conversation. Sometimes if i see a words meaning but don't understand it, I'll ask a Korean speaker to use it in a sentence or two so that I can better understand it.   Also another method I use is in my Korean study book, and when speaking with Korean people, if there is a word I don't understand I'll quickly jot it down in my phone and then look it up later, and make notecards to study from. No better way to learn commonly used words in conversation than to pull them right out of conversations, I think!"

Another issue is that Koreans themselves don't usually have much actual writing experience..they don't write much in school, they NEVER write letters, and typically create things like resumes using a fill-in-the-blanks template or something.

Korean,3cx7zk,ezql,12,Sat Jul 11 16:05:52 2015 UTC,"KMS is an introductory book, so while it covers some of the forms you'll need to know how to use in business (more so in book 2), it's not a ""Business Korean"" book. You'll want to eventually purchase a business Korean book specifically for that, if that's your goal, which will probably mostly consist of idioms/vocabulary used in business, but that also depends on the kind of business you're looking at - there are lots of businesses where you're not going to need that kind of knowledge. I'd focus first on becoming conversationally fluent in Korean though, and then from there seeing if learning business Korean is even something that would benefit you."
Korean,3cx7zk,gobillykorean,4,Sat Jul 11 18:17:56 2015 UTC,"Spot on! If he is looking to improve relationships with Koreans, they will be very fond of him for using any friendly conversational phrases. If they already speak English to some degree, business will likely continue to be conducted in Korean.   So that last point needs emphasis. Learn some polite conversational phrases and it will go a long way."
Korean,3cx7zk,Paradoxa77,4,Sun Jul 12 00:46:56 2015 UTC,"I purchased the book, and honestly didn't expect it to have much related to ""business"", maybe a snippet explaining something regarding culture. I understand how important is to establish strong foundations - have been learning German for 2+ years.   Thanks for the advice."
Korean,3cx7zk,so_meta_account,7,Sun Jul 12 01:46:26 2015 UTC,"If you're still a beginner, which your flair and textbook choice both suggest, can I recommend that you avoid specializing in business related topics just yet? Until you have a firm foundation, it really doesn't make sense to specialize. Especially since the purpose of your learning is to improve your relationship with your partners/clients. Koreans, like Japanese and Chinese, tend to really value the relationship over other considerations like ROI, quality of product, etc. It's just assumed all those factors are top notch and so the emphasis falls on the relationship. That's why I think its' good to develop a real strong base in terms of listening and speaking. I think ""Talk to Me in Korean's"" Iyagi series is great to help out with listening and conversation skills. When you're ready to move up, try watching 24 hours news streams like this- (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HxN3ZHMbjc).  Here is the iyagi series (http://www.talktomeinkorean.com/category/shows/iyagi-intermediate/). Hope this helps! What specific type of business do you do?"
Korean,3cx7zk,so_meta_account,3,Sat Jul 11 18:21:17 2015 UTC,"I wasn't planning on jumping straight into business related topics just yet, I just like to plan in advance :).  Most of the contact will be written/typed, it is not often to have conversations over the phone. For the time being, I have a Korean business partner but he is leaving.   Specific type of business is distributor for electronic goods. The main issue is Korean manufacturing companies tapping into the international market (except Samsung, LG and KIA of course), but amount of critical information lost in translation is getting problematic."
Korean,3cx7zk,theghostofm,2,Sun Jul 12 01:41:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seems like you would actually want to focus on reading/writing then. Interesting stuff! Korean is a lot of fun to learn but anyone on this sub can tell you that it's not a light hobby; it's a missionquest! Don't expect immediate results. It took me three years to get to a real conversational level and it's not always smooth sailing. I can say that Koreans are incredibly generous and will definitely have patience for someone who shows dedication and respect for their language. They love to share their language like they love to share their food. Show em you're willing to go an inch and they'll go a mile to meet you in the middle."
Korean,3cx7zk,n1ll0,5,Sun Jul 12 04:49:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with gobilly and so_meta; it's a very, very good idea to invest time - from several months up to a few years - to get conversationally fluent. After that, specialize. This will be the best, and likely fastest, way to get what you need."
Korean,3cx7zk,n1ll0,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:36:01 2015 UTC,"there is a blog feed that I follow with my feedly rss reader app called Nojeok Hill, which is gear toward practical tips for english <-> korean translation and document construction.  It is not purely related to Korean/English speaking/reading/writing/interacting, but it is pretty useful in a business setting, especially when much of the interaction may happen long distance, i.e. via email, mail, fax, etc."

It's much more beneficial for you to post the entire letter here.  If it needs to be kept private, we understand. But unfortunately, you won't find many people willing to help. In this case, you may want to find a translator who will do the work for a fee.  This is the kind of situation people are afraid of: redditor_a decides to send you a PM but when you respond and give him the content, it turns out to be longer or harder than anticipated.

Korean,3cwcu5,Nebuleon,3,Sat Jul 11 09:54:53 2015 UTC,"The Korean language does not use the same ""that"" (or ""who"", as in ""the girl who is pretty"") here. I actually asked a similar question to the subreddit a bit ago. After corrections, we ended up with the following sentence:  한국어를 못하는 여자와 함께 여기 왔어요. = [[Korean language] <do not> -adjective woman] with together [here] came. / I came here with a woman who does not speak Korean.  The literal translation is way different from English. In Korean, to give a quality to something, you want to make an adjective out of the quality and place it before the thing.  ""The one who is pretty"" becomes ""The pretty one"". ""The one who speaks English"" becomes ""The English-speaking one"". ""The one who always looks at the stars"" becomes ""The always looking at the stars one""."

Korean,3cn2nf,HiImJan,3,Thu Jul 9 04:37:16 2015 UTC,"Let me try to answer this to the best of my abilities. Hopefully if I am wrong in any aspect, someone else can chime in.  The phrase 물 없어요. Simply means ""There is no water"" ""I/they/he/she doesn't have water"" ""Water doesn't exist."" (This is taken straight from here)  I suppose that you can say 이거 물없어요 ""This doesn't have water"" if you're specifically talking about a thing that doesn't have water (Perhaps like a potted plant?) Don't forget that 이거 means ""this/this thing/this thing right here""  물이 없어=물 없어 just with the particle 이/가 물은 없어요, I think of the particle 은/는 as starting a sentence with ""As for xxx"" ""As far as xxx is concerned.""   ""As for water, there is none."" ""As far as water is concerned, it doesn't exist.""  If the sentence is 물있어요, no you don't have to put 이거 / 그거 / 저거 unless you're specifically talking about a thing here, there, or way over there that  has water. (Like a water fountain maybe, but who would say that? Sounds dumb.) ""저거 물이 있어요, 엄마!"" ""알았어, 짐미야. 아, 내 불쌍한 새끼야.""  I think that the phrase ""I have everything, but water"" can be better explained with a future phrase that you'll learn in TTMIK, but basically using 물은 없어요 does give the connotation of ""I have everything, but water isn't one of those things.""   As for the TTMIK lessons, I recommend that you listen to them, but also read and WRITE down the pdf lessons in a notebook. (verbatim) Most of the time, the pdf lessons has more information than the podcast had. Sometimes its not enough to just listen and besides, I hear that your brain remembers stuff better if you actively write things down. That's the method I used to study Korean and it works perfectly."

Korean,3cn2nf,Adacore,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:28:44 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend getting some kind of beginner textbook to help you with the basic grammar. Stuff like the 이/가, 을/를 and 은/는 particles are much easier to learn by reading about them than from the TTMIK lessons, imo.   The difference between 물이 and 물은 is simply that one is using the 이/가 subject marker and the other is using the 은/는 topic marker. So:   물이 없어요 literally means ""water does not exist"" -> I don't have water  물은 없어요 literally means ""as for water, it does not exist"" -> I don't have water (with more of a nuance that while you might have other things, you don't have water in particular)   You are correct that 이거 물 없어요 doesn't really make sense. 이거 and 물 are both nouns, so the most natural interpretation would probably be that one is the topic and the other the subject, for example it could be interpreted as 이건 물이 없어요 meaning ""this thing does not have any water""."

Korean,3cj4ke,1950sbebop,9,Wed Jul 8 08:55:00 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, why did you skip the tones? From what I know the five tones are the first things you learn when you start learning Chinese.  But yeah. Some basis in Chinese might help you learn Korean vocab because many of the words come from the same roots. Knowing Korean helped me memorize many Chinese words so it should work the other way around too."
Korean,3cj4ke,oree94,6,Wed Jul 8 16:14:11 2015 UTC,"There are a number of reasons that people give for skipping tones; they're hard to wrap your head around when you haven't trained your ear for them, they're pretty boring, they seem 'useless' at first (when compared to learning a new grammar form or vocabulary that will allow you to make yourself understood), it's not something people are used to learning as part of a new word so it doesn't ""stick"". I've also seen some advice along the lines of not bothering to pick up tones, since you'll learn it through natural speech--this may or may not be a good idea, but many learners take it without following through on the 'speech' part, which is never good.  That said, I pretty much agree with /u/1950sbebop on his reasons for disliking Mandarin; the few things I would say having studied Chinese for a little over four years are: 1- after one year of in-country Mandarin, I was only around the ""simple conversations"" level. I also had a background in Japanese, so the characters came to me easier. The writing system is frustrating to learn, but it's not very frustrating to use once you've learned it. 2- You might give southern mandarin a try; whether in south-east China or in Taiwan, many people much prefer the way it sounds."

Korean,3cj4ke,vaporsnake,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:44:13 2015 UTC,"I was wondering that too. I know very little Mandarin but the first thing I focused on was the tones. I can hear them pretty well in slow speech and I can pronounce them (again, with slow speech).

I am by no means fluent because I refused to practice it at home (lol adolescence). What I have found was that I recognize random words or sounds that actually may not necessarily translate to the Korean sounding word. The only thing that knowing some Chinese would do is help you retain these words faster/easier.  My two cents is if you're super interested in a language, it's 100000000000x easier to put the effort into it. Sounds like you're done at the moment with Chinese, it isn't going anywhere, so go learn Korean  EDIT: GRAMMAR PLS."
Korean,3cj4ke,200dronerush,5,Wed Jul 8 13:40:14 2015 UTC,"Hi Hi! Long term student of Korean, who has also spent some time studying Chinese.   Chinese will greatly aid your Korean, about 80% of active Korean vocabulary has Chinese roots. You will find that a lot of the words you have learned easily convert to a Korean equivalent. You will have no hope, however, in the grammar. It's very complex and very different from chinese. There are no tones in standardized Korean (Seoul dialect) while some regional dialects make use of them, they are not common place. This is an inherit feature of the Korean language, they just don't happen. If people adjust pitch or tone, it's inflectional or endemic to the word used.   Korean is a beautiful language. It just is. The lack of tones leads to a greater deal of personal inflection and is why Korean music has a lot more acoustic variation (?)  The influence of the West on Korea is profound compared to other asian nations. As a result, a lot of Korean media and social exports have had the west to model and then develop their movies, media, music off of.  Korean is 99% pure phonetics. If you read into King Sejong the Great, you will learn that it was designed for everyone to be able to read and write. The koreans have a lot of pride in this. Hanguel-nal, or Korean Day is a national holiday in Korea.. as in the school, banks and gov. buildings close.    The benefits to learning Korean are profound. S. Korea has an ever growing economy and the business and cultural benefits are innumerable.   TL;DR Yes, your Chinese will help. Yes, Korean is awesome."

Through some classes i did learn about how the system was designed to be simpler so everyone can read and write, which that in itself stirs up some optimism towards learning. The only thing that will most likely stump me numerous times is the grammar :(.  Also side note, I think the word for three is similar to the word for three in Chinese, ""Sam"" ? In Chinese you would say ""San"""
Korean,3cj4ke,YouFeedTheFish,2,Thu Jul 9 05:13:38 2015 UTC,"Korean has two number systems, one is native Korean the other is sino Korean which is based off of Chinese numbers. One confusion between the sino Korean number system and the Mandarin Chinese number system is that 1 in Mandarin is yi but 2 in Korean is 이/ee."
Korean,3cj4ke,teachinginkoreanow,3,Thu Jul 9 20:35:24 2015 UTC,"I mean if you enjoy the music, the way the language sounds, how you'll at least be able to read things even if you can't understand it, then why not? Worst that'll happen is you grow to dislike it as you have Chinese. There might be some similarities between the two languages, as Korean uses borrowed Chinese characters called hanja. It's ultimately up to you whether you decide to start learning Korean or not."
Korean,3cj4ke,YouFeedTheFish,3,Wed Jul 8 09:44:34 2015 UTC,"Chinese is to Korean what Greek and Latin are to English. Or rather, Ancient Chinese is to Korean what Ancient Greek and Latin are to English, and Modern Chinese is to Korean what Modern Greek is to English. (Modern Latin = Spanish? French? Italian? Who knows.)  You're going to have a huge vocabulary once you figure out how Koreans pronounce Chinese. And realize that they borrowed the Chinese words hundreds of years ago back when Chinese pronounced them differently. And they made their own pronunciation changes as well. And they combine the Chinese in ways that will surprise the Chinese. But the basic elements are there and you'll get a big head start by knowing Chinese.  Unfortunately, the grammar is entirely different. We're told it's part of the Altaic group, which includes languages such as Norwegian and Japanese. Why Norwegian? I don't know, but if Norwegian is half as fun as Korean, I should probably learn it too.  Korean grammar is drop-dead simple. So simple, in fact, that even though you master it you'll still have no idea what they are saying.  Don't let me discourage you, though. Korean is fun. You'll probably like it a lot.  (Also: If you had a hard time with tones, you're going to find that aspiration in Korean may drive you a little crazy, too. Get over this as soon as possible, and you will be much happier for it.)"
Korean,3cj4ke,parmichili,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:50:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the solid and honest response, what are these aspiration tones you're talking about? For example, the sound that sounds like a mix of ""l"" and ""r"" ?   Sorry if this is really vague, I kinda looked up some stuff on Korean pronounciation before and I remember that sticking out a lot. It's a sound that you cannot find in English ?"
Korean,3cj4ke,robobob9000,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:16:17 2015 UTC,"No, it's the consonants. English consonants are distinguished by voiced and unvoiced: g/k, d/t, etc... This is pretty typical of most European languages and even some foreign ones like Japanese.  Korean consonants come in 3 varieties: aspirated, normal, and doubled. If you can't distinguish or pronounce the differences correctly, you'll never understand or be able to speak Korean. For instance, you might hear ""gim"" and ""kim"" and think they are different words but it's not --- they don't distinguish based on voice so it's the same to them. You'll hear ""ka"" and ""kha"" and you won't know the difference but to them, those are two completely different sounds. If you can't pronounc them properly, they'll never understand you, just like you wouldn't understand me if I said ""do pe or nod do pe""."
Korean,3ciulb,jiabi,5,Wed Jul 8 06:36:27 2015 UTC,"The 세 comes from the Korean honorific form -시다, which is used to put honorifics on the subject of the sentence. The basic idea is that you only use it when speaking about someone whom it is appropriate to honorify.  So for your example, you would indeed need to ask them, 뭐 하세요? But not when talking about yourself.  Some others will probably be able to give better advice. But for now, you may want to read up on Korean honorifics: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_honorifics"

Korean,3ciulb,kamakie,5,Wed Jul 8 15:10:31 2015 UTC,"I think it depends from person to person. Your friend might tell you how to address them, which could be anything from 어머님, (friends name)의 어머니 or 엄마 for the mother and for the father, the same or even by their profession. For example, if they are a professor it would be 교수님.   Your best bet is to ask your friend what to address them by (they'll probably say 아버님 and 어머님) and when you meet the parents, you could always ask them if they want you to address them differently. Some people might like formality, others might be happy with 엄마, especially if they like you.  In my experience, I called my friend's parents 어머님 and 교수님. :D"

Here are some thoughts on how to further improve the app: As of now, it's basically a list of grammars packed in a nice layout. Making it more interactive could make this app even more attractive.  I'd love to see a feature where you can check off and dismiss grammar structures you learned (maybe by adding to buttons on the bottom of each grammar page (dismiss / review again (add ""!"" next to grammar on overview page)) and/or swiping left / right for that in the overview page. This would really boost motivation to study. Features such as ""a grammar each day"", maybe with the option of pushing a notification or even a widget with that daily grammar can add to motivation too.  And how about a ""favourite"" or ""grammar to review"" tab?  As I am not a developer, maybe I'm suggesting too fancy stuff, but no matter what, it's a great app already... keep up the good work!"

Korean,3chyi7,Drustifer,2,Wed Jul 8 01:28:01 2015 UTC,"Most of the literature recommends learning languages by thinking up a mental image and linking L2 symbology to it. Direct translation from L1 to L2 is suboptimal because it requires more mental processing (mental imagery -> L1 -> L2 -> reconcile the cultural differences between L1 and L2).  This is why some people can become fluent in a language in X months. They're usually people who have already learned multiple languages, and most likely have already learned another language in the same language group.  They already have strong mental imagery so its easy to add new symbols to the existing mental framework."

The problem is that Korean doesn't really equivalent Latin characters like Japanese does. This is the main reason why we dislike romanized so much Korean here."
Korean,3chx76,theghostofm,2,Wed Jul 8 01:23:01 2015 UTC,"This is true. I'm concurrently learning Russian and I found it helpful having the phonetic keyboard, however it seems as though Korean may require me to memorise the new layout. Fair enough!"

Even more so for the associated chinese characters (幸福).  행복, meaning ""happiness"", is a perfectly fine, though very generic word for a tattoo.  The word does not remind me in any way, shape, or form, of Bigbang, but if all you are concerned about is the tattoo's personal meaning to yourself, have at it.    If you decide to do a 행쇼 tattoo (which I don't recommend, as it could be a flash-in-the-pan trend), make sure to make it pretty, and not like it was printed from a Microsoft Word document."

Most people find hangul tattoos ugly and tacky anyways so like another user said, look for some tasteful calligraphy if you must have a hangul tattoo.  Also, 행쇼 is already kind of becoming a cringe-y word to some people - when you get older it will look dumb, sort of like having a tattoo that says ""SWAG"" or another catch phrase.  I love BigBang (saw their show back when Alive came out) but I would definitely go with 행복, a phrase that will hold up a lot better than 행쇼!   At the end of the day I think it's really cool you're gonna get a tattoo of something that means something to you. Just be careful and pick a good parlour that will know how to give you what you want in a way that won't make you facepalm later!"
Korean,3cfuq3,gujayeon,2,Tue Jul 7 17:58:58 2015 UTC,"Perfect! This is exactly what I needed to hear. I was a bit worried since 행쇼 was noted as being a ""catchy phrase"" that the context would look odd. It's also easier to explain to a fellow BB fan that the idea is to get a simple crown shape with 5 points, and then the hangeul underneath. I was thinking ""be happy"", or as others have said ""happiness"" because of how I'm going to feel at this show. Watching the tour diaries on YouTube has me convinced that this is going to be the show of a lifetime! Thanks for your help, and Happy Cake Day!"
Korean,3cfuq3,FAP_2_SNSD,2,Tue Jul 7 18:32:45 2015 UTC,"If you want the phrase to read ""be happy"", then ""행복하세요"" would be okay to use.  Perhaps it's the best choice--there is pretty caligraphy of that phrase available off of google, and it sort of has a connection to Bigbang and 행쇼.  I can't imagine any tattoo artist would turn down foreign lettering if you actually provide an image of what you want.  I hope it turns out great!"

Korean,3cc39x,Tobias_Funke,5,Mon Jul 6 22:18:07 2015 UTC,"""빵빵터졌"" isn't a complete expression - it's missing an ending.  터졌다 is an informal way of saying 터졌습니다/터졌어요  e.g. 마셨다 (to drink) --> 마셨어요.  ""마셨"" would just be an incomplete verb such as ""터졌""  Might be reading too much into this, but when she is talking about how he makes her laugh, she is thinking it to herself.  When she is saying ""Maybe German humor is my style?"" she is kind of expressing that towards other people (quite possibly OP :P) so she uses the formal version of ""인가요..."" instead of ""이다..."""

There's a gov't sponsored language program for immigrants/migrant workers here in Korea and I'd like to be a teacher for it, since the biggest complaint among my fellow English-speaking expats is that they need basic grammar explained in English. They can't get that, so they give up.   I think your approach is good, but more interesting display (white screen with text is boring), a more colorful voice (as I said in an above comment--a bit dry, despite being informative) and some more sample sentences would go a long way.

This is a different spelling from 안 - which, combined with a verb, turns the verb into the negative. Notice that you can also turn verbs into negatives by attaching -지 않다, where 않다  is actually originally 아니하다.. if i remember correctly. And there's probably a relation between 안 the negatifier and 아니요, but I'm not sure what it is exactly and you probably don't need to worry about that now."

Korean,3cbpie,theghostofm,9,Fri Jul 10 22:56:31 2015 UTC,"Hey, that's my video :P And it's the study method I created in 2003, and used while living in Korea. And it worked well, but I only used it to learn words I'd already seen/heard in context - never random words from a list or dictionary. I also would throw off words that didn't seem useful because if there was a difficult or uncommon word it'd end up never being used and then forgotten.  So with that said, I don't recommend that you use that method when you're first learning Korean, but I might recommend it once you're an intermediate+ level. At the beginning levels, you really don't need to focus on learning that many vocabulary words. Just 5-10 vocabulary words a day is more than enough if you're studying for 30min to an hour a day. Grammar is a better focus at the beginning levels than vocabulary. edit: spelling"

Korean,3c92dc,desperatechaos,15,Mon Jul 6 01:09:58 2015 UTC,"Simply awesome. There are a number of really important points in this article, but here's one of the most important:   Never use English anywhere ever with anyone. For every Korean that wants to use you for language practice there are ten that don't, and there is no reason to spend one's time chatting with the former when you are the one who has made the effort to save up and make your way to the country. The person may be really nice, may want to hang out and buy you dinner, doesn't matter. You can hang out with that type of person after you've become fluent and have been in the country for years and don't particularly need the practice anymore.   Acutally, for this reason I think that once you get to a certain point, you should even avoid language exchanges. If you're living in the country and have an intermediate grasp of the language, you simply don't need them."

It's very, very common for English native speakers to try to compare 한글 letters directly to English letters. But the reality is that they're very different, and there are only very, very few situations where you can actually write a Korean word out in English letters and have it be an accurate transliteration.  It's much, much better to forget about English letters entirely when trying to learn Korean pronunciation. Instead of asking for ""what letter does [korean letter] sound like?"" I might suggest asking for recorded audio, or finding a video on Korean pronunciation for the bit you're looking for.  Another set of tools that can be helpful (if a bit wonky) are the  Text-To-Speech tools on lots of computers. There are also decent TTS on Google Translate and Naver Translate. Also, most full-featured dictionary apps for Android and iOS have native pronunciation samples (or at least decent TTS) for most words."

It's becoming more and more apparent that I've taken an incredibly bad approach in my learning thus far (still taking baby steps with this language) I've mostly learned by books and reading other things such as playing video games with the text and speech set to Korean (I figure any application is better than no application, right?) but I realize now that what I need to do is more listening in a slower and more calm environment, focusing on individual sentences and sounds, because it goes without saying that sentences a person would hear on a video game or on a song wouldn't translate to any real applicable learning at a stage this early."

Korean,3c8bwn,Busangod,10,Mon Jul 6 02:42:00 2015 UTC,"I like the pun!   But I feel that this is also an opportunity to address a very common pronunciation problem! (Sorry if I'm being a jerk!)  TL;DR: 네 is not /neɪ/ - it's close to /ne/  Many learners of Korean from the US tend to pronounce 네 the same as the pronounce ""neigh"" or ""nay"". This is, to be blunt, incorrect - and depending on the person, can even be closer to 네이 than to 네!  The proper pronunciation of 네 or any thing with ㅔ does not have the /eɪ/ sound transition that ""neigh"" and ""nay"" have. In American English, we have so many /eɪ/ sounds that it's hard for us to properly pronounce 네. For many of us, we'll even listen to someone say /e/ but internally understand it to be the same as /eɪ/ when in Korean, it's not the same.  So I guess I'm just saying, ""Always remember 네 isn't 'nay' or 'neigh'."""
Korean,3c8bwn,theghostofm,7,Mon Jul 6 00:34:23 2015 UTC,Yes I totally understand! I watch a lot of starcraft and the Korean casters always enthusiastically yell 네! during the game when discussing it.   Just thought it was a cute joke :-)

It's a good example of cultural differences.  If you translate it literally, almost nobody will get it. First, drug is not a joke material. Second, there's no Korean equivalence of ""need a life"". Finally, the subtle rhythm of the phrase goes away.   So, you have to completely change the wordings, while keeping the essence, or the feeling of the joke intact. I just couldn't make it work.

Korean,3c85if,Breadincaptivity,-1,Mon Jul 6 02:35:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, when talking about a third person's feelings, 하다 can be added to descriptive verbs.  예쁘다 becomes 예뻐하다.  슬프다 becomes 슬퍼하다.  You probably recognize these as to be pretty and to be sad. They get translated a little differently when you add 하다.    ""예뻐하다"" is ""to consider (something) pretty"" and is sometimes translated to ""to adore.""  슬퍼하다 is ""to consider (something) sad"" and sometimes is translated as ""To mourn.""   As you can see, it's pretty easy to tell what verb these come from, so you should be able to figure out the meaning as you encounter them.  And if you're trying to make a verb like this, look it up at Naver Dictionary to verify that it's a real word first.    Of course there are more ways to describe other peoples' feelings than just by using words like this, so it's not like you definitely have to do it this way.  EDIT: Please see w-esst's comment.  Because I was specifically asked, I brought up this grammar point, but it isn't very natural outside of 싶어하다. I've mostly seen it in translated stuff, should have mentioned that!"
Korean,3c85if,choihanam,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:13:20 2015 UTC,"Very informative, thanks. 싶어하다 came up very early in studying but then nothing else and I always found it kind of odd.  Is it always just 3rd person? For example, 나는 그여자 예뻐해요 wouldn't work?"
Korean,3c85if,w-esst,2,Mon Jul 6 05:32:47 2015 UTC,"While the 싶다 and 싶어하다 distinction is quite common,  the rule is not often applied to other verbs.  I can tell you that 예뻐해요 hits the ear wrong, well at least oddly.  내 생각에는 그 여자가 예뻐요. or 나는 그 여자가 예쁜다고 생각해요, would be more correct."

I know one of the first example sentences most people learn is something like ""저는 고양이가 좋아요."" Which basically is ""To me, cats are good.""    So I imagine you'd just say ""나는 그 여자 예쁘다."" Or really just ""그 여자 예쁘다.""    Or there are structures like ""제 생각에는..."" which is more like ""In my thought/opinion...""  Someone more advanced may know better than I do!"

Unfortunately if you don't know the word, you can have the best grammar in the world, but you won't be understood."
Korean,3c7yw7,dekme,3,Mon Jul 6 04:07:18 2015 UTC,"Korean is a category 5 language for English native speakers. That means that on average it takes about 2200 hours of classroom study to become proficient at the language. Not fluent at the language, just a communication ability roughly equivalent to a native 8-10 year old child. In comparison, a category 1 language such as French/Italian/Spanish only takes about 600 hours of classroom study.  So if you study Korean on average of one hour a day every day, it's going to take you about 6 years. You can try to accelerate the pace by isolating your study to gaming terminology, but the problem is that gaming evolves so quickly that by the time you learn something it will probably already be outdated.  This is why most people who are serious about Korean language learning enroll in a Korean language school full time for 1-3 years in order to kickstart their learning. The same goes for other category 5 languages such as Japanese, Mandarin, and Arabic.  I'm passionate about esports too and I'm living in Korea right now. But passion isn't enough to learn a language, you need lots of time. The people who say ""I learned X language in less than 3 months"" didn't get there in a vacuum. It's usually because they already have a lot of experience in learning new languages, and they do it via immersion."
Korean,3c7yw7,LieutenantKaiya,2,Mon Jul 6 10:51:09 2015 UTC,"I personally think this is a bad mindset to have when it comes to learning a new language, thinking in terms of how long it will take to achieve fluency/desired level of fluency. When learning a new language, you can't be pre-occupied with the end result, but you need to be immersed in the process; take your time. In regards to actually learning Korean, other users have said it well here, but Korean needs to somewhat become part of your daily life; listening to Korean music, watching Korean TV shows, learning about the culture and eventually thinking in the language. This is going to seem harsh, but you need to have a lot of motivation for this and be in it for the long haul, if not don't even bother starting. Last point, it's the amount of hours studied, not the months/years that matters."
Korean,3c7yw7,Pikmeir,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:18:40 2015 UTC,"Think about how long it took you to master your native language. All the verbs, nouns, various spellings that you know. Don't forget homonyms and homophones, idioms, figurative and literal phrases. Not only that, but you were in an environment where people were talking in your language constantly, everyday. So you were completely immersed and could use context clues to figure something out. Better yet, you had people to correct you when you were wrong. Reading/English homework and grammar workbooks.   If you are serious about learning Korean, I suggest you start with grammar (if you can already read Hangeul.) Talk to me in Korean is a great website for that. And don't just listen to the lesson or just skim over the lesson pdf. ACTIVELY write out the lessons and the practice sentences. Look up words you don't understand. It will take time. A LOT of time on your own, without the help of a face to face teacher, but you'll get there. In...3-6 years.    As for typing in Korean, buy one of these(As well as downloading microsoft Korean IME) to help you.  Good luck."

I personally learned english through gaming by playing games in english and guides and whatnot with movies helping quite a bit aswell i assume. Since i have certain games im invested into, do you think it would help me improve faster by changing my games into korean language and splitting some of my time between frequenting and reading actual korean boards/translations and the lesson material or should i focus on just the lessons? (this would be after i get familiar Hangeul)  Will take a look into the stickers though, they look like a big help to start out with even though i hate looking at my keyboard.  About the face to face teacher, since i cannot select korean as a course/class at uni as cheaper alternative with the path ive chosen, do you think they are worth the money (and how much money would that tend to be generally?) when i know i will most likely not or hardly be able to make anything back off of me learning korean?"
Korean,3c7yw7,LieutenantKaiya,5,Sun Jul 5 20:37:53 2015 UTC,"Generally language tutors can run anywhere from $10 to $50 per hour depending on who you get, but whether it's worth the money depends on how valuable it is to you. If you're wealthy enough to be able to afford several hours of tutoring per week, then it could be useful because it's another opportunity to use Korean, but it might not be something I'd recommend if you're strapped for cash because you could substitute a tutor with a native Korean penpal and hanging out in our /r/Korean chatroom."

The whole series from beginner to advanced is really good at helping you put the words you know together. It really explains the intricacies of grammar structures and compares them to other similar words/structures /uses.   You can find it on amazon or gmarket depending where you are. Good luck  Edit: I really think it should be added to the resource thread under grammar, cuase right now it grammar just has that really unorganized dictionary that's only good for searching."

But I love my Comprehensive, and I'd vouch for the quality of Routledge Grammars in general. My Chinese class requires one of their grammars, and I've bought a Japanese one for a friend, as well as a French one for my sister.

Also, 안녕하세요, 안녕하십니까 is used as a greeting, but 요 and 까 endings are used when asking a question.   There isn't really a rule on when you should use which one. But in interviews, where you are introducing yourself, you would use 까. At work, I use 요 to my immediate supervisor, but 까 when I'm speaking to an executive. When meeting someone for the first time, I would generally use 요.   까 ending is also used in the Korean military instead of the 요 ending."

Korean,3c2zra,b_author,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:10:10 2015 UTC,"It's actually pretty rare to use 안녕하십니까 in general situations.  This is both formal and honorific, and would be reserved for talking to people much older than you (maybe..) or much more important (like job seniority, maybe a judge, something of that nature).   When people who work for the government or large companies address the general public, they use formal language and honorific if it applies, like the announcer on a TV news program, on a train, etc. since they don't know who might be in the audience..(and because of who they represent, too..its not a personal thing!)  안녕하세요, while still being honorific (containing 시) is used all the time and not always in honorific situations at all.    Interestingly, I just today started my new youtube channel talking about 안녕하세요 then I saw this post.  So you might want to check this out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs8ox1iE0m0  I can see the poster isn't too worried about being ""formal"" or ""honorific"" with the group here, by starting with the most intimate form of this same expression being 안녕  ...nathan, I hope no one older than you, or sensitive, or important sees that...kkk  In fact, if you were Korean, that'd be pretty bad form, to say the least...."

And naturally, people like restaurant owners or servers in better places often greet older customers like that, and so on.  Nothing wrong with it, but it's not usually used in ""day to day"" life by ""regular people"" and those hiking situations seem to be kind of unique..a mutual understanding of just loving nature or something I don't fully understand."

""Are you doing well?"" Kind of an alternative to 잘 지넸어 I think. I would imagine you would use it when you haven't talked to someone in a while. Definitely not something you would say as the first time meeting someone. In either case, 안녕하십니까 is definitely more formal than 안녕하세요.  Again, I'm probably wrong. Please don't kill me."

Korean,3c23m7,Paccypacpac,8,Sat Jul 4 01:25:36 2015 UTC,"I end up concentrating on reading subtitles if I use them, so for me it's better to not use subtitles and focus on listening to the Korean."
Korean,3c23m7,iwantchumsticks,7,Sat Jul 4 02:10:19 2015 UTC,Use subtitles until you can understand 70-80% of the show with them off. Then turn them on only on the parts you dont understand
Korean,3c23m7,snsdfour3v3r,2,Sat Jul 4 02:24:57 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, I did the opposite. Listened first and then used subtitles to pick up things I didn't know. I think it all depends on what skill you're working on."
Korean,3c23m7,MotivatorNZ,4,Sat Jul 4 20:46:09 2015 UTC,"In my own experience, both can be very helpful. For a beginner, it's much more beneficial to have subtitles--both English and Korean--so that you have that crutch to go back to when you can't quite catch something being said. At the same time, watching without subtitles tests your listening comprehension. What I used to do when I started out watching movies and shows without subtitles is to repeat a section several times to catch a word I didn't know, and then hoping I'd be able to find it in the dictionary (which I fortunately was able to do!). It was a very tedious process, but I think that helped me improve my listening skills."
Korean,3c23m7,typecfl,3,Sat Jul 4 02:17:23 2015 UTC,"I'm at a point where I can tell if the translator is sticking very closely to what's being said or not.  And it's very frustrating when they're trying to make the dialog sound better in English.  Often, it really isn't necessary, and makes it harder to learn Korean from the subtitles.  Subtitles have helped me pick up the more common words, sentence structure, and a little bit of verb tense (when the translators stick to the script).  But I don't think I'm ever going to learn less-common vocabulary from the subtitles."
Korean,3c23m7,JosephineKDramaqueen,2,Sat Jul 4 16:35:54 2015 UTC,"Subtitles are a thing that can help very much at a certain point, and hinder very much at a certain point.  When you're trying to practice reading, or are still accumulating vocabulary, subtitles are great. They tell you how something is spelled, which helps if you want to write too, and can disambiguate between certain words.  When you've got enough vocabulary and you read faster than they speak, subtitles are a crutch, and you should turn them off to listen to the sound and make extra effort to understand.  At least this is how it was for me in English. Take your level of comprehension into account. :)"

Korean,3c23m7,feedmefeces,3,Sat Jul 4 12:22:47 2015 UTC,Definitely not English. Korean subtitles only when you are at a low intermediate level or lower.
Korean,3c0bnq,DTKsh2r,7,Fri Jul 3 16:41:33 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to agree with the other comments so far and add some of my thoughts, having majored in Korean many years ago. Simply taking a Korean class or even majoring in it won't necessarily make you a capable Korean speaker on its own. Most other students in my advanced class (all 5 of them) couldn't confidently hold conversations in Korean despite being at that level.  Nevertheless, as mentioned it can be a really good asset to your learning. Some reasons being:   Depending on the teacher/class, you're getting structured learning that covers the most important concepts which can be sometimes be missed when self-studying at first. You're investing more time learning and practising it. A lot of students don't often try hard, so it's a great opportunity to get good marks while doing something you love.   So if not the class, how do you become good at Korean?  There are so many things you can do but here are a few.   Practice and interact in Korean with native Koreans outside of class as much as you can — even if you're a beginner. This is really key, and something a lot of the other other students didn't do. (Pro tip: Hangout together with Koreans as a group. If your with one Korean friend who just speaks English to you, that's not much help.) In my case, I just moved in and shared a flat with Koreans. Similar to above - get lots of exposure to the language, even if you don't understand everything. Movies, music, tv programmes, what ever tickles your fancy. The catch? You need to pay attention to it and try to listen out for things you've learnt. Enjoy it! The most important thing in my opinion is that you actually love studying the language. Trying to use the language, getting exposure to it, and then finally being able to say or understand something will motivate you even more so they all tie in together.   Good luck!"

Plus, learning from a class makes pronunciation much better/easier, so go for it."
Korean,3c0bnq,kamakie,3,Fri Jul 3 16:44:15 2015 UTC,Use the Korean class as yet another resource in your own personal quest to learn Korean.  You will advance faster and get more out of the class.

How does Learning Korean at the University fit into my long-term goals?     This is oh, so personal. Do you want to become a translator? An interpreter? Do you want to date a Korean? Do you want to read books in Korean? (If so, what kind? Comic books? History books?) Do you just want to be able to speak to some Korean friends? Is this a personal goal or a professional goal?    Most importantly: Will Learning Korean at the University help me to become the kind of person I want to become?     Does this provide opportunities for you to build personal character?

My Korean learning efforts went extremely well for the first 24 months, after which Korean was simply a part of my life.  It was only in the last few years that I refocused my Korean study toward simultaneous interpretation. The simultaneous nature is less scary than sequential interpretation because there is less room for others to criticize you for less than perfect results. You just keep getting closer and closer to the most accurate meaning.  Now in my profession I provide interpretation for international business situations. It is immensely rewarding for me, but it did cost me ten years of my life to reach this level. Few people are willing to commit this much. If you're just in this to have fun, make sure you are having fun the whole time. If you have another goal, make sure to have fun along the way."

Korean,3c0bnq,Gobluebro,2,Fri Jul 3 21:07:03 2015 UTC,Would you think it's not worth it to study Korean at a Korean university to be able to hold conversations with Korean friends/people? Mainly personal but never hurts when it comes to business I guess. I'm asking because I am really passionate about learning Korean atm and I know I won't be later in life. But the costs + student loans are pretty heavy on me as well. I'm having a really difficult time finding a good solution to my problem.
Korean,3c0bnq,Sciar,3,Fri Jul 3 21:34:15 2015 UTC,"You are specifically talking about conversational fluency. I would be very critical of the school you attend. Look at the students before enrolling in the Korean courses and after leaving the Korean courses. As Mark Rosenfelder once wisely wrote:   People can learn languages in school... but most of the time they don't. To see this, simply look at American foreign language instruction. Many high schools and colleges require several years of a foreign language; the usual result is that students make the absolute minimum effort to pass, and five years later are unable to produce a sentence in the language.  These courses typically take 3 to 5 hours a week; one might expect more of bilingual or total-immersion schools. But even here the results are not perfect. Some Canadian schools teach French to anglophones by immersion; it's reported (François Grosjean, Life with Two Languages, p. 219) that the students do well enough academically, but have ""great difficulty"" communicating with French-speaking Canadians outside the school, and don't initiate conversations in French.  European schools have a better reputation than U.S. ones, but I'm not convinced that the situation is spectacularly different. After ten years of English, students may do quite well; but if they don't have ongoing opportunities to practice, their English may not last much more than the American students' French or Spanish.  The basic fallacy here is to take learning as an irreversible process. Because someone learned something in school, whether it's Latin or trigonometry or the exports of Venezuela, it doesn't mean that they still know it. An example is the father of a friend of mine, a Brazilian who studied in the US for a year. Forty years later, he can still read English, but he's quite unable to carry on a conversation in the language.   Examine very carefully why you want to learn this language. Be very clear with your goals. You may say you want to ""learn Korean"", but maybe what you really want is to be able to have meaningful five to fifteen minute conversational interactions with new people in Korean.  Then compare the university courses you are considering against your desired outcome. Are students coming out of that program able to achieve the outcome you desire?  Usually this is not the case.  Another commenter noted that you can't just be a foreigner in Korea and expect to learn Korean. This is very true. It's very easy, for example, for an English speaker to spend all of their time in Itaewon, interact only with other foreigners or Koreans who speak English well, and never learn the language or the culture. If you aren't doing something in the language, you will never learn it.  If you are attending school in Korea in a situation where English is not available, you will learn. Unfortunately, most people don't have the wherewithal to make this happen on their own.  In order for me to learn Korean, I gave up all of my non-Korean language social contacts for nearly ten years outside of my immediate family. When you have no choice but to use Korean when studying, working, worshiping, and recreating, you get a very solid base very quickly. (You also lose a considerable amount of fluency in your native languages and your other languages.)"
Korean,3c0bnq,Sciar,2,Fri Jul 3 22:34:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the lengthy response.   From what I gathered about your response is that it won't just come from schooling at least. I understand that. I know my passion is pretty great and I would be trying my best to use it with others. I do that pretty recently but I think a lot of my beginner knowledge is holding me back to be honest. I know my levels of how much I'm willing to work on this outside of school. I also know the negative impact of using another language outside of Korean. I truly believe that I would apply myself outside of the class. Of course I think there are areas I need to improve upon to strengthen it. The times that I have visited Korea it has felt like it was too short to really improve a lot (4-5 weeks). I'm confident I would be taking a lot out of living there for a year or two. I truly believe that I would be working harder than most of the students in those courses. I could go on about myself but I don't think that information is required.  Where exactly would I find a good / accurate representation of a school? I assume just purely off of student reviews. I don't have a lot of faith in the programs that work with my University (Sookmyung 숙명 and Hansung 한성). Purely based of the negative examples given to me from my friends who have went there.  Basically the case is for me that I'll be going there after I graduate college so I would still have student loans to pay off plus paying for the college and living expenses as well. I was trying to look for a home stay in Korea so I could stay with some Korean people and it would help me use Korean more often.  I have certainly been taking a lot in throughout this summer on this subreddit and from trying to explore a lot of my options. I think I could be spending my time better trying to incorporate studying after working full time at an internship that is unrelated to this. So I can really understand how difficult my goals will be and I'm prepared to try my best at it.   Also I don't think I mentioned but I was hoping to have a full typical kind of conversation, whether it's in a Korean business setting, drinking, being with friends, etc. I'm not looking for 15 minutes and done. I want to know what people are saying the entire time I'm with them."

Korean,3c0bnq,Philigreed,2,Fri Jul 3 21:04:13 2015 UTC,I spent a lot of time in Korea and I met a lot of foreigners. This is just my personal experience but not a damn one seemed to be even halfway competent in Korean unless they went to school to study in that type of environment.  I tried to learn on my own and I could communicate like an infant or perhaps a monkey by the end of a year. It's very hard to learn unless you have other people to practice speaking with and the best place to get that is in some educational format.
Korean,3c0bnq,Philigreed,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:53:56 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for that insight!
Korean,3c0bnq,Zekarus,2,Fri Jul 3 21:05:05 2015 UTC,Anytime hope you find what you're looking for. If you do go study you'll have a blast everybody seemed to absolutely love it.
Korean,3bxucn,mikwow,19,Fri Jul 3 01:26:31 2015 UTC,Nice write up. I added HelloTalk to the resource thread as well.
Korean,3bxucn,yoheist,15,Fri Jul 3 01:33:43 2015 UTC,"This app is amazing and probably the best language exchange resource out there but I want to warn people to be careful with this app, especially if you live in Korea. I've met many many girls who seem to be just looking to hook up with foreign guys and some of my female friends found the same to be true with Korean guys using the app. Of course this is the minority, but it still seems to be 1/10 people that contact me, especially if they live in my city."
Korean,3bxucn,Vihvillain,4,Fri Jul 3 01:51:30 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Obviously this wasn't the case with me since I live in Canada, but I guess this was bound to happen with this app somehow someway."

Korean,3bxucn,jrroelle,6,Fri Jul 3 15:07:02 2015 UTC,I've met 70% of my Korean friends through HelloTalk. It is perfect for linking you directly to native speakers.  The biggest issue is that the app itself is god awful. Don't try to message for long using it. Switch over to Kakao or another chat client as soon as possible. Too often messages don't go through (or are delayed).
Korean,3bxucn,Pikmeir,3,Sat Jul 4 17:00:19 2015 UTC,Switch over to Kakao or another chat client    This. I've lost a few conversations with HelloTalk crashing and not sending messages. Kakao is the way to go.
Korean,3bxucn,rkwlak,4,Fri Jul 3 14:58:59 2015 UTC,"When I first downloaded it, I knew some sentences to introduce myself, but I wasn't really able to make my own sentences.  A month or two later I was added by someone who I had the same small talk with as usual and then added to KakaoTalk.   Things changed when she started pushing me to use Korean and at least try, she'd correct me when necessary. Since then I've made enormous progress. Highly recommend the app!"
Korean,3bxucn,feedmefeces,5,Fri Jul 3 20:11:25 2015 UTC,"I found it to be a waste of time. I was bombarded constantly by people that had no interest in speaking Korean. The conversations were also all the same. ""Why do you study Korean? What was your major?"" etc. It might be helpful for beginners with no Korean friends, but if your Korean level is above basic self introduction and you know some Korean people, this app has nothing to offer."
Korean,3bxucn,random117,9,Fri Jul 3 08:54:26 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with you. It can be a lot of the same stuff, and there are lots of people who are not interested in letting you practice Korean with them. However, out of 100 people, if 1 or 2 can become a good language friend on a regular basis, I'd still say it's worth it because the app gives you a way to connect with people. It's also common for conversations to last only a few hours and then suddenly stop, so if you're talking to someone who seems to have no interest in helping, you can just stop replying and search for someone else."
Korean,3bxucn,feedmefeces,5,Fri Jul 3 02:46:08 2015 UTC,"I've been using this app since it was first released. I don't remember when, but it's been at least a few years by now. I completely agree with the conversations not being the best; a lot of the times it just feels like I'm interviewing the other person. Fortunately it doesn't bother me, I'm just here to practice and stuff.  However, in the years I've been using this app, I've never had the problem of meeting someone who doesn't want to use Korean. In fact, it's been the complete opposite for me. Every single conversation I've had through HelloTalk has resorted to 100% Korean after a few hours.  At times, it was even frustrating. I sometimes just wanted an English-speaking buddy for a nice change, you know? Anyway, as you can see by the replies in this thread, it really differs from person to person. I hope it doesn't discourage anyone reading from trying it out."

Korean,3bxucn,hoolaboris,4,Fri Jul 3 11:04:27 2015 UTC,"Have you tried it recently? Every person I talk to tries to speak English for the first one or two messages, but once they find out they can just speak Korean comfortably with me they give up speaking English right away."
Korean,3bxucn,TruKiller,2,Sat Jul 4 00:07:45 2015 UTC,"I used it when it first came out (so maybe things have changed), but even then this was a big problem - people simply weren't interested in speaking Korean (other than very superficial questions), and so I found the whole thing to be a waste of time. If I would ask a complicated question about politics or something in Korean, I would just get '한국말 잘 히시네요',  and then the actual reply in English. Perhaps it can be useful for beginners, but I can't see it being useful beyond that. I'm sure there are exceptions, but if you have to spend hours and hours trying to find them, then it just doesn't seem an efficient use of time.  I gained a lot of ground by focusing instead on English-free activities and situations in which I could practice Korean without having to reciprocate by providing people with English practice. To be honest, there comes a point where you have to avoid language exchanges (and indeed, avoid English altogether.)"
Korean,3bxucn,LieutenantKaiya,2,Fri Jul 3 15:01:09 2015 UTC,"You have to keep using Korean and not use any english. Also, talk to young people (they seem to be more enthusiastic). If your conversations are boring, then say something interesting"

When I was a beginner, I didn't get much out of the app. Now that I am actually able to converse in Korean, I feel like the conversations are much more interesting.   Of course, some people were obviously not interested in helping me learn Korean. These people never got a message back from me. Yes, sometimes I had to carry the conversations, but most of the time it was worth it.   Have you tried bringing up different subjects? Some of my favorites were:   Food: I don't know where you are from, but I had a lot of fun talking about poutine, maple syrup and Canadian bacon with Koreans. Also, Korean food is fascinating to me so my conversation partners often sent me pictures of their meals. Music: These days, I listen to a lot of Korean music to practice my listening comprehension. I've discovered some pretty good artists with HelloTalk. Politeness: I remember my friends being shocked when I told them I could address my teachers or my friend's parents by their first name. Games: Now's your time to get creative. One of my favorite game was to give them a French first name and have them guess if it's a boy name or a girl name. Then they'd do the same with Korean names. You can also try to guess their height from a picture they send you, or even just send voice messages instead of text messages. I've had a girl sing ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" because she had learned that at her English class during the day."

Korean,3bxucn,oree94,4,Tue Jul 7 01:48:30 2015 UTC,"This app is incredibly useless for high level speakers. I recently got back into using the app after forgetting about it for a while and after talking to a few people, they all asked me the same questions and freaked out when I typed a basic sentence. If you are a high level speaker and want to get some serious practice, there are other websites you can use or you can peruse where you live or your school for native speakers. If you are a beginner, this app is full of people for you."

As soon as you start using the app, they blast in your face what you can't do. That seems to me very extreme restrictions on what we can do on the app, though i canunderstand their intentions 100%. Hellotalk is a lang exchange app, not a dating one.  Secondly, the interactions you get there are pretty transactional. Boring conversation? No problem, lets ditch this one for now and find someone new to talk to. You always feel replacable at ghe beginning because its so easy to search for new frienda when you havent developed a bond with whoever youre talking to. Its just harder to make friends there."
Korean,3bw7ls,kdkmmt,12,Thu Jul 2 17:36:20 2015 UTC,"There are probably more advanced people who have had different stories. Pikmeir and MotivatorNZ are both extremely good and their input is probably going to be golden if they share it. For me, it was a combination of things. I'm not saying this is the best way, or even necessary for everyone. But i think it was necessary for me, individually.   Lived in Korea for an extended period of time (years, not months), and didn't speak English much while I was there. Studied Korean continually for a few hours every day during my time in Korea and after leaving. Established a circle of Korean friends in the US and abroad to help me keep improving.   I lived in Korea for a few years, not teaching English. I separated myself from every non-Korean person I possibly could and avoided using English at all. For myself, this is probably the crux, but in itself isn't really enough.  Structured Korean study was and is also extremely important. Hours every day, always with a focus on improving my weak points. I feel like identifying my weaknesses was the most important aspect of my studies, and learning to take criticism was really hard.  After leaving Korea, I've been lucky enough to live in areas with lots of Korean people, and my SO is a Korean citizen who I met at college in the US.  The whole story is a lot longer, but this is more or less the gist of it. Although I have certainly met people who are very good at Korean without ever spending any real time there, and everyone is different."

Korean,3bw7ls,theghostofm,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:51:24 2015 UTC,"This answer is spot on, and similar to mine except I'm an English teacher. I'm not advanced yet, more like high intermediate, but the key things were 1) time and 2) consistency.  I have been here for 3 years and from the very beginning I studied several hours a day, every day. No excuses. I also used structured textbooks and interacted with mostly Korean people. It helped immensely. In one week I would spend more than 60% of my free time completely immersed in Korean.  Another game changer for me was that I actively read books and newspapers as well--if you only stick to textbooks you won't get to the next level. You have to engage with realia to approach advanced level. Also, don't worry about knowing all the hanja but I recommend studying at least the most comon 50 or so hanja characters bevause it can help with understanding some words (and those pesky 4-character sayings)"
Korean,3bw7ls,nuguseyo,6,Fri Jul 3 06:26:10 2015 UTC,"First of all, 1 year of self-studying is not enough to make you even an intermediate level.   With that said, the little-known secret to getting from advanced to fluent is by making subtitles for variety shows/예능. It's very difficult to do, but it is the most intensive type of study possible. Without talking in real life to any Koreans for 6 months, I subtitled videos every day for hours. Then I visited Korea and was shocked at how fluent I was.   The reason this worked is because 예능 is the most difficult type of show to understand if you're not a native speaker. There are often 2-3 people talking at the same time, with text popping up on the screen and low-volume microphones where you have to strain to hear.   Translating sentences will give you a feel for the language and a sense of how dialogue is used naturally, unlike with scripted TV shows. I've never met a non-korean better than me at listening and speaking and I meet a lot of people (10-15 a week) learning Korean through work (though I'm sure there are some).   It took me 3.5 years since I took my first class to reach fluency. However, I was extremely motivated. Dunno how motivated you are."
Korean,3bw7ls,snsdfour3v3r,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:19:20 2015 UTC,1 year of self-studying is not enough to make you even an intermediate level.   I'd disagree with this. There are many people (and a few I know through this sub even) who went from nothing to an intermediate level in under a year doing nothing but self-studying and practicing in the /r/Korean chatroom (shout-out to our awesome chat!).
Korean,3bw7ls,Pikmeir,2,Sat Jul 4 02:24:20 2015 UTC,"You're right, it depends on how hard you study. My first year of self-study I didn't study very hard so I didn't progress much"
Korean,3bw7ls,snsdfour3v3r,7,Sat Jul 4 02:26:09 2015 UTC,"To be completely honest, it takes a lot of exposure. You need as much exposure to the language as possible. Books and lessons are necessary to learn how to properly use the grammar that you hear Koreans use, but that's only helpful when you have speaking/listening practice to use what you know. The same goes the other way - speaking/listening practice is only helpful when you have books and lessons to learn the language. The more that you can expose yourself to the language, the more that you'll pick up from it.  Time is also an important factor. Even if you're living in Korea, surrounded by only Koreans, and are only using the Korean language every single hour you're awake, you still need a lot of time to get to a level where you can read a book or watch a TV show without requiring English subtitles. This is a higher level than simply a standard ""advanced"" level, and I'd say this is closer to a level of ""fluency"" (but not as high as a ""native"" level).  But if you can't be in Korea, that also doesn't mean you won't be able to learn the language to an advanced level. It just means you have fewer opportunities to interact with the language and you have to work harder at it.  You need Korean friends who will use their language with you. This is even more important at higher levels as it can get more and more difficult to see noticeable improvement once you've passed the intermediate level. You should have a regular schedule for studying lessons, but speaking/reading/writing/listening in Korean should also have a schedule that's separate. As you go further, your studying schedule will slowly decrease as there are fewer major/daily-used concepts to learn, and your time spent using the language will increase in its place.  If you're still at a beginning level, then this might not apply to you. There are still plenty of books and resources out there with concepts you will need to learn and practice (at a desk, with a notebook) before preparing to deal with the long haul of moving to the advanced level. Even free web sites such as TTMIK will have plenty of material to keep you going to an intermediate level (assuming you're not only using one source to learn).  So, as a TL;DR, you need more exposure to the language to reach a higher level. Make native Korean friends and use Korean as much as you can, but also don't give up traditional studying or you won't be able to learn proper Korean."
Korean,3bw7ls,gobillykorean,8,Thu Jul 2 21:24:02 2015 UTC,i think this applies for all languages: living in that country/city will greatly and more rapidly improve your fluency
Korean,3bw7ls,rosicky7t,3,Thu Jul 2 19:53:22 2015 UTC,"I think that it is going to be very difficult to achieve that level of fluency without living in Korea for an extended period of time or surrounding yourself with Korean speakers.   Like u/theghostofm, I was a Mormon missionary in Korea for two years. I came home, got a degree in Korean and married a Korean. The time that I was closest to the level you described was while I was living in Korea and immersed in the language. In the six years I've been studying the language I don't know if I could ever have easily read a book or completely understood a TV show. I can understand the gist of things, but I definitely don't understand them completely."

And then after graduating college, I continued to meet and become friends with native speakers, eventually marrying a native speaker who's parents live in Pusan and don't speak English.   I can hold a conversation fine, which is probably due to the native speakers adjusting their speed and vocab down to my level. My reading level is only about 2nd or 3rd grade, so I can stumble through a newspaper article, but nothing scholarly. I can sort of understand gag show skits, but news anchors speak way too fast, and music is a garbled mess to me."

Korean,3bw7ls,gsd1234,2,Fri Jul 3 02:41:06 2015 UTC,"Last year in March I made the jump from english subs to raw kdramas. The first few months were frustrating--I understood most of it but sometimes the complicated relationship details were too much (i forgot who was friends and who was enemies and why they all hated each other). I also made the mistake of choosing a medical drama (Good Doctor) and the vocab flew right over my head. The more thriller or comedy type dramas were a better fit.  But slowly, I started picking up new words and interesting phrases. Now I watch variety shows, music shows, interviews and other tv with no problem. My favorite night of the week is sunday because my boyfriend (korean) and I cook dinner and stream all the shows we missed during the week.  I have also used kdramas to study korean and it absolutely improved my listening comprehension and speaking. I speak faster and more naturally now because I used to shadow the characters' lines.

I am an American-born Korean and I couldn't speak a lick of Korean except the usual answers. I got acquainted with a couple of Korean exchange students who soon become good friends. They'd watch American movies with Korean subtitles so O just tried to mix and match. I was constantly surrounded with the language and slowly I started to speak and practice daily, engaging in conversations and always asking questions and not being afraid of saying something wrong. I then immersed myself in the Korean language further by getting jobs that required me to speak the language. Honestly I am still learning but I have been able to sit-in ad a translator for couple of company affairs as a third-party.  Tl; dr I guess keep practicing, using, and excercising it as if it were a muscle. If there's a will, there's a way you just gotta push yourself"

One thing they do have in common though is a significant period of immersion (a number of years), very high motivation, and willingness to avoid English while in Seoul (this is, of course, not as easy as you might at first think, and actually requires a bit of stubbornness). All of them have also completed or gone to a very high level in a Korean language program - Yonsei, Sogang, etc. (It's debatable as to whether something like that is absolutely necessary, but as a point of fact all my friends who have mastered Korean have done so, including myself.)"

Korean,3bw18i,TheMcDucky,2,Sat Jul 4 05:07:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks both! Just to add to your comments, not sure about Japanese Sekai, but in Korean, while 세계 & 세상 can be used interchangeably in some instances, the usage of 세계 and 세상 are a bit different. 1) 세계적으로 유명한 가수 (the world's popular singer) 2) 세계시간, 세계날씨 (time around the world, weather around the world. Meanwhile, as for ""세상"", 1) 이 세상에는 두가지 부류의 사람이 있다. There are two types of persons in the world. 2) 세상에서 내가 가장 사랑하는 사람. The person that I love the most in the world. So, as you can see, both are interpreted as ""the world"" in English but in Korean context, they are a bit different. 세계 has a more literal meaning of ""the world"" and 세상 means a world as a metaphor. Hope this helps!"
Korean,3bwmf4,forceless_jedi,3,Thu Jul 2 19:25:31 2015 UTC,"I was in your position one month ago. Memrise worked the best for me. I tried the media route but my language level was too low to really understand the nuances of what I was learning. I think ultimate beginners can learn from media, but you really need a teacher with you to guide you through the material.  Why didn't Memrise work for you? The first couple Memrise courses I tried were crap, but eventually I found some good ones.  I train pronunciation here: http://www.memrise.com/course/365575/korean-pronunciation-skeleton/  I review TTMIK vocab here: http://www.memrise.com/course/47179/ttmik-book-1-talk-to-me-in-korean/  And I supplement the TTMIK vocab with this: http://www.memrise.com/course/1614/1000-most-common-korean-words/  I use TTMIK and KoreanClass101.com to train grammar.  I like Memrise because it helps me learn how to type in Korean. But if you don't care about typing and just want the vocabulary then you can use the mobile website."
Korean,3bwmf4,robobob9000,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:15:49 2015 UTC,"Memrise is a very solid system for learning, but I have a very weak memory so simply reading and repeating things over and over, which is the way that Memrise, Duolingo and such teaching methods are based upon, does me very little good. My academic grades suffer because of this issue too.   In case of languages, the only way I've been able to successfully learn new things was through observing interactions and slowly trying to participate myself, if situation allows that is. Korean isn't the first language I'm learning, so I've had the chance to experiment ^ ^ . And media has been a big help to me with the others. Which is why I was thinking of simply going through those right from the beginning. Not to mention it'd help me learn more about the culture, cause all I know about Korea is 강남스타일 and Wonderful Days Q.Q  Crap, sorry, I digress, the thing with Memrise, I tried it for a month or so when I started learning Thai. But since it just throws the vocabulary at you without any context, after a few days(at best) I'd forgot everything; and going back and revising over and over didn't do much good. Faced the same thing when I tried it for Japanese. I'll give another shot with the ones you suggested though, the typing practise would definitely be a plus and might even help me remember words this time :D Plus I'll have TTMIK as a context :D :D  Thanks a lot ^ ^  [Sorry if this was long ._.]"
Korean,3bwmf4,robobob9000,2,Sat Jul 4 11:07:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah I have terrible memory too. But there's no substitute for memorization. It sounds like you're a kinesthetic learner. Honestly I think Memrise would do you a lot of good because you'll learn vocabulary via typing, instead of just passively reading or listening. Yeah its gonna be slow at first, because you gotta learn how to type in addition to learning the vocabulary. But the investment does pay off.  I worked here in Korea for 8 months and only learned maybe 50 words of Korean. Yeah I was surrounded with Korean all day, but I wasn't learning anything because it was all too high level for me. However after one month of studying one hour a day (30 mins on grammar/pronunciation via podcasts, 30 mins on vocabulary/typing via Memrise), my vocabulary increased from 50 to 200."

Sad :( But yeah, I started out the typing exercises in Memrise and if nothing else I'm hoping it'll help me with my reading Hangul fluency. And it's a bit more fun as well :D   Ahh! I faced that problem as well. People would either speak too fast or very difficult things and I'd be completely lost, and Thai also has tones and stuff so it would be very difficult to make heads or tails of anything. But I'd keeping asking my classmates what the words meant and to speak slowly so that I could try and understand a bit. Though I guess that worked cause we were all 18 and they were ecstatic to have a foreigner with them xD Well, now that I look back I probably annoyed them a lot x_x Can't imagine something like that to be appropriate in a work environment…  But yeah, thanks a lot for the advice. I started the Mems you suggested and a few more. Hopefully typing would help me remember. Also, thanks for the new word(kinesthetic learner) ^ ^ I didn't know learning had different categorises. I always figured I was just horrible at it xD"
Korean,3bwmf4,marriedtoamazement,2,Sun Jul 5 08:47:51 2015 UTC,I have had better success with vocab using Quizlet and building my own lists. It forces you to type out the word (unlike Memrise on my device it will give you syllables but not allow you to type) and whenever you create a vocab list it auto detects the word (even in Korean) and so you will have audio of the pronunciation.
Korean,3bwmf4,robobob9000,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:46:05 2015 UTC,"Oooo new app to try! :D Would it be possible to share your lists, by any chance? Building my own at the moment is a bit difficult x_x  For Memrise, I noticed there's a dashed line right about the syllable list. Tapping there allows me to type the things out. Well, at least on the phone it's like that. I don't know how it works on their webapp."
Korean,3bwmf4,marriedtoamazement,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:51:29 2015 UTC,"I find it much easier to build lists via mobile just because the keyboard it much easier to contend with than my normal English [computer] one.

What I have done is gone to the search feature and you can find lists that others have created then save them to a folder you created. The ones in my ""study"" folder are those that I've found are useful for me right now or that looked like they may be useful in the future.   Currently I'm not studying any of those since I have created my own for an online Korean course I am taking...I did find that a few had errors BUT if I copied the set I could edit them to my own liking.

Korean,3bs2jl,Nebuleon,11,Thu Jul 2 02:03:02 2015 UTC,"So I'd like to explain how your initial guess was wrong. As this is your first post to /r/Korean, and it contained only one sentence, we can only use this sentence to assess your level of knowledge. So we don't know if this is literally your first and only sentence, or if you know some stuff already (like Hangeul, words, grammar, etc.)  So here's a breakdown of your first guess:  나 한국 다량 몰라요. = I Korea (country) not a great deal of know. / I don't know a great deal of Korea.  Firstly, the 나 (""I"", in casual conversation) and the ~요 ending clash a bit. It's like ordering an ice cream cone with ""I would like a cone of chocolate ice cream, yo!"" instead of ""I would like a cone of chocolate ice cream, please."" or ""I wanna get some chocolate ice cream, yo!"". But also, if it's clear from context, this ""I"" is usually omitted in Korean.  한국 is Korea, the country. For its language, you want 한국어 (Korean (language)). For its people, you want 한국인 (Korean (nationality)).  몰라요 (from the verb 모르다) seems to be more about lacking specific information (e.g. ""What is this?"" ""I don't know. / 몰라요."") than about lacking general information or ability (e.g. ""Can you drive a car?"" ""No, I can't."" / ""아니요, 못해요.""). In the Korean language, you would use 못해요 (Wiktionary: 못하다 to describe general inability.  Other commenters have already put down some sentences, which I broke down for you; they mostly vary in the level of knowledge of Korean that is guessed."

Korean,3bpnlo,gallemore,11,Wed Jul 1 07:23:38 2015 UTC,Might be too advanced.. But for a bonus skill I think some of the 4 character 한자 phrases would be cool.
Korean,3bpnlo,gallemore,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:48:37 2015 UTC,This is a great idea
Korean,3bpnlo,Octopuse,2,Wed Jul 1 16:12:16 2015 UTC,"How far away is it? I have followed this for two years. I have lived in Korea for two and a half. It's frustrating for me because I know a lot of vocabulary, but my sentence structure is lacking. I sound like a caveman when talking to Koreans."
Korean,3bpnlo,Nebuleon,3,Mon Jul 6 02:29:10 2015 UTC,From course release? Probably 6 to 8 months for En->Ko... if Duolingo decides to make it
Korean,3bpnlo,GiantRagingBurner,2,Mon Jul 6 04:13:43 2015 UTC,I hope they do.
Korean,3bpnlo,Rial91,24,Mon Jul 6 04:47:58 2015 UTC,Existance. I want it to exist.
Korean,3bpnlo,Nebuleon,2,Wed Jul 1 19:03:37 2015 UTC,있다? :)
Korean,3bpnlo,RandomKoreaFacts,12,Thu Jul 2 05:50:52 2015 UTC,"Words, idioms, grammar, etc. And a difficulty increase as you work through the course.  I'm almost done with the German tree, and at this point, I'm just reusing all the stuff from the beginning, but with new vocab. ""The woman goes to the grocery store."" Really basic stuff, to the point that I'm not really learning anything anymore."
Korean,3bpnlo,Jaqe,3,Wed Jul 1 06:33:41 2015 UTC,"Ja, we will make it sure it is challenging."
Korean,3bpnlo,gujayeon,4,Wed Jul 1 07:24:10 2015 UTC,"For me, the biggest advantage to Duolingo is that you don't just learn vocabulary, you learn sentence structure as well. Therefore I find it really annoying when much of the grammar isn't repeated outside of the skill focuising on it.  I really see no point in high-end skills that aren't much more than glorified one-word flash cards. That's not what I study all that grammar for."
Korean,3bpnlo,today2day,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:44:41 2015 UTC,"I agree. I don't want such a Korean course to just be new vocabulary in a basic sentence structure.  To be considered fluent in a language, you have to be able to use connectors, and in Korean they are especially difficult to learners because there are so many that are used in distinct circumstances.  The woman goes to the grocery store to (in order to, for the goal of) do what?  The woman goes to the grocery store because (for the reason) of what?  So a set of modules that would go over those connections (to/for/in order to, because, so/therefore, and/and then, or, if, that...) would be nice.  And then some more for auxiliary verbs (can, should, must/have to) and verb combinations (want to ..., like to ...).  And then you could say stuff like ""The woman had to go to the grocery store to get shampoo because she had only one bottle left."""
Korean,3bpnlo,ghettofabdelicious,10,Thu Jul 2 06:34:17 2015 UTC,"I would do anything for there to be a Korean Duolingo course. Anything to do with basic survival, navigation, customs and stuff."
Korean,3bpnlo,SwiftKick85,7,Wed Jul 1 07:22:07 2015 UTC,"Colors, seasons, days of the week, etc.  These would be pretty easy to learn.  Things like culture: food, holidays, common slang(vernacular), traditional clothing would be great for more advanced levels.  I've not taken any Duolingo courses that were not Spanish-related.  Would Hangeul be used on the courses?"
Korean,3bpnlo,MyJokesArentFunny,2,Wed Jul 1 08:34:17 2015 UTC,Hangeul will probably be used
Korean,3brh46,cadesert,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:40:21 2015 UTC,정발력 and 셋팅력 are both related to strength. 정발력 refers more to how well the wax can hold shape. 셋팅력 refers more to how long the wax will hold the style.  세정력 is how easy it is to wash off the wax.
Korean,3bpdn0,bukkakesasuke,10,Wed Jul 1 02:06:25 2015 UTC,"Korean here - a bit of editing for you:        Laundry - 빨래 not ""빨레""; synonym - 세탁; washing machine - 세탁기; to do the laundry - 빨래하다, 세탁하다; a pile of washing: 빨랫감 / 세탁물 (No real difference between 빨래 and 세탁. 빨래 is a pure Korean word, whereas 세탁 is from Chinese characters)       '탁자' usually refers to a coffee table of sorts. A dinner table is 식탁.       Things that you might want to add to your bathroom checklist:      Toothpaste - 치약; toothbrush - 칫솔   Tooth/teeth - as Adacore said it's 치아 but on second thought it sounds a little too formal/clinical to me - I've only heard/said it at my dentist or in a similar context like teeth whitening (치아미백, if you ever wonder). More casually known as 이빨 (no plural, consider it as uncountable. The same goes for 치아); hence ""to brush teeth"" - ""이빨을 닦다"".    Shampoo - 샴푸; conditioner - 린스   Towel - 수건   Restroom/bathroom is as you said 화장실. This usually refers to toilet as well, although the actual word for it is 변기. Don't use '변기' to say you want to go to toilet though, 화장실 covers that.   Shower - 샤워; bath - 목욕; the two are interchangeable; bathtub - 욕조        Random words that I just came across:        Heating - 난방; heater is indeed 히터 but its synonyms are also commonly used like - 라디에이터 (radiator read in Korean) and 난방기.   Air conditioning (air conditioner - 에어컨 as above) is 냉방.   Dishwasher (which I think is uncommon or isn't utilised much. We have one at home which is being used as an extra storage) - 식기세척기    Living room/sitting room/lounge -  거실 (I would actually use 마루 too but it seems like it isn't grammatically correct or something according to dictionary as it says it only means floor. Strange)   Front door - 현관문 (현관 meaning entry)    Keys - 열쇠   Vacuum cleaner - (진공)청소기, 진공 being vacuum; to clean - 청소하다         I seem to have forgotten the most obvious:        the Internet - 인터넷 (the English word read in Korean)       Well this has proven rather tricky (learning Korean is hard, but teaching it is equally challenging). I confess that I had to look up most of the words here. Any doubts/questions, leave a reply and I'll try to help as much as I can!      EDIT: corrected grammar & formatting (clearly new to reddit, sorry) and made some addition."
Korean,3bpdn0,thespurofthemoment,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:26:52 2015 UTC,"Ahh thank you so much!!  How about ""lights""? And if I wanted to put ""turn on the lights"" under my light switch, what verb would I use?"
Korean,3bpdn0,thespurofthemoment,2,Wed Jul 1 08:17:34 2015 UTC,"My pleasure.       There are two words that I think of when it comes to lights, which are ""불"" and ""등"" - the formal being more commonly used. In this case ""to turn on something"" is ""켜다""; antonym - ""끄다"", i.e. ""Turn on the lights"" - 불(등)을 켜다; ""turn off the lights"" - 불(등)을 끄다.        Fun (possibly useful too) facts: an electronic light is supposed to be ""전깃불"", but for the sake of convenience we often shorten it to ""불"". I assume this is originated from fire being lights before the introduction of electricity. Similarly, ""등"" is actually ""전등"" but shortened as ""등""."
Korean,3bpdn0,thespurofthemoment,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:17:55 2015 UTC,"Ah thank you so much! So 불 literally means 'fire'? And I am guessing 전깃불 means something like 'electric fire' literally?  Would the polite forms be:  불을 켜요  불을 끄요  What about floor and ceiling? And up and down?  Also, I noticed your edits. So would the polite form be:  이빨을 닦아요 ?  Thanks so much for your help!"
Korean,3bpdn0,Adacore,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:52:39 2015 UTC,"No problem.      RE: the polite forms for all three, yes that is correct - I should warn you though there are many variations for ""the polite forms"" but there is no need to know them now. I am sure you'll learn them once you get here.      Yep, 불 literally means fire - you're also correct in saying this is to lit, as in ""to lit cigarette"".       Floor - 바닥    Ceiling - 천장    Up & down - 위 & 아래; your comment almost instantly reminded me of this popular song of the girl group EXID. Quite fitting, isn't it?"
Korean,3bpdn0,Adacore,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:10:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks!! My list is complete!  That song has such a strange video, but I can't stop watching. O_o"
Korean,3bpdn0,Adacore,4,Thu Jul 2 23:57:21 2015 UTC,"I think these are the ones you're missing from the list, except for toilet, which I don't actually know!   Kitchen - 부엌 / 주방  Trash - 쓰레기 (a trash can would be 쓰레기통)  Mirror - 거울   Closet - 옷장 (if it's a wardrobe for clothes)  Heater - 히터  Air conditioner - 에어컨  Fan - 선풍기  Fridge - 냉장고  Freezer - 냉동실  Bedroom - 침실 (or commonly just 실)  Table - 탁자  Stove / Range - 가스 레인지 (assuming gas)  Sink - 싱크대  Clothing - 옷  Sofa - 소파  Chair - 의자  Take a shower - 샤워해요  Get dressed - 옷 입어요  Brush teeth - 치아 닦아요 (tooth - 치아)  Brush/comb hair - 머리 빗어요 (brush/comb - 빗)   Shave - 면도해요 (shaver - 면도기)  EDIT: Changed conjugation of verbs per your request in another comment."
Korean,3bpdn0,Adacore,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:57:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you!!   A few questions:  Is there a different word for electric stovetops?  Assuming I get an apartment with a closet, and I use it just for storing knick-nacks rather than clothes, is there a more general word?  부엌 / 주방  What is the difference in nuance between the two?  For the verb sentences you provided, are they infinitive or imperative, and which parts are the particles? Also, what politeness level did you choose?  Keep in mind I have literally studied no Korean beyond a little hangul, so I am mostly guessing what's going on based on my Japanese grammar knowledge.   As for toilet, that's not really necessary. I just thought it may have been interchangeable with ""bathroom"" like it is in Japanese. Since you don't know it, it clearly isn't as common of a word."
Korean,3bpdn0,Pikmeir,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:11:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about electric stovetops. Maybe 전기레인지, or just 레인지. Not 전자레인지 - that means microwave.   For a general closet, maybe 벽장, but I'm not really sure.   I think 주방 is maybe slightly less formal than 부엌, but they're basically entirely interchangeable.   I conjugated the sentences originally using dictionary form, then edited them to be in the polite (but not formal) level, which doesn't have distinctions for infinitive or imperative. The dictionary forms are: 샤워하다; 입다; 닦다; 빗다; 면도하다. The polite level conjugation from that involves removing the -다 and instead adding either -어요 or -아요 depending on the last vowel in the verb.   My Korean is only intermediate level, so if advanced or native speakers disagree/correct me then assume they're right!"
Korean,3bpdn0,TheSlyPig04,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:18:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Another poster was saying the dictionary form is almost never used, is this true?   [the polite form] doesn't have distinctions for infinitive or imperative   Can you explain more about this?   Does this mean that 옷 입어요 can mean ""brush (your) teeth!"" and also ""(I) brush (my) teeth""/ ""(to) brush (one's) teeth""?"
Korean,3bpdn0,kamakie,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:31:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, to both questions. The dictionary form is almost never used conversationally.   In the polite conjugation (""옷 입어요"", which incidentally is the getting dressed, not brushing teeth, sentence) the declarative ""I get dressed"", imperative ""get dressed!"", proposative ""let's get dressed"" and inquisitive ""do you get dressed?"" are all the same, and context/intonation is used to work out which meaning is intended. In the formal conjugation, these cases all have different conjugations: declarative would be ""옷 입습니다"", inquisitive ""옷 입습니까?"", proposative ""옷 입시다"" and imperative ""옷 입으십시오""."
Korean,3bpdn0,DecipherXCI,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:47:18 2015 UTC,"Wow. Ok. Thank you. That's very interesting. Can you give me a sloppy overview of the levels of speech and the context you'd use or hear them in?   which incidentally is the getting dressed   Yeah, I can't really read or write yet, sorry! Next week when I start seriously studying I'll be better I swear!"
Korean,3bpdn0,lemoluv22,2,Wed Jul 1 05:49:54 2015 UTC,"Very, very briefly (and I assume once you start studying seriously you'll learn this properly anyway): in spoken Korean as a non-native speaker, you only really need to know three speech levels. The formal level (the -읍니다 stuff), is used in formal settings like business meetings and speeches; the polite level (-어/아요) is used in everyday speech most of the time; the intimate level (-어/아) is used between close friends, or to people younger than you, and is easy once you've learnt the polite level, since it's identical, only without the ""-요"" bit.   For written Korean, you can use the same formal endings as for spoken, or you can use a different written informal level conjugation, which involves using endings like -는다."
Korean,3bpdn0,MrComedyHooligan,2,Wed Jul 1 06:01:43 2015 UTC,"three speech levels   You forgot honorifics, which work differently than the other levels (요, 니다, 반말)."

Korean,3bpdn0,Not_Ayn_Rand,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:35:48 2015 UTC,For a few £/$ to learn all that vocab in a different method than usual is fine imo. I'm sick of staring at books and flashcards.
Korean,3bpdn0,thespurofthemoment,3,Wed Jul 1 15:54:58 2015 UTC,I would love to start doing this as well! Great idea since Im moving to Seoul in August! :)
Korean,3bpdn0,Not_Ayn_Rand,4,Wed Jul 1 02:47:20 2015 UTC,"I noticed you speak some Japanese. I also learned Japanese before Korean, and because they're so similar (at the beginner level) I would recommend downloading (I think someone has already made them) Anki cards with JLPT words in Japanese and their Korean equivalent on the otherside. You'll be surprised at how close the onyomi is to the Korean reading in a lot of the words."
Korean,3bpdn0,thespurofthemoment,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:10:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Do you have a link to the deck? Also, how far does the grammar diverge at the intermediate levels?"
Korean,3bpdn0,thegigglepuss,2,Wed Jul 1 03:39:31 2015 UTC,"I unfortunately lost the decks, though I just did a search and found something similar: http://www.memrise.com/course/573398/n5-9/  These are the N5 words, good for a start.  I'm barely intermediate in Korean so I don't think I'm the right person to ask. You'll notice divergence even at the novice level, where a construct in one language might have two nuanced constructs in the other. But the foundation is the same, and I haven't found anything super confusing yet."
Korean,3bqs3p,chickenandliver,2,Wed Jul 1 11:53:55 2015 UTC,"The correct word is actually 새시 coming from the word sash. Other spellings and pronunciations are officially ""wrong"". I don't know any more than that sorry but I hope that helps."

Korean,3bosz6,random117,5,Tue Jun 30 22:51:18 2015 UTC,I like lang-8 once you get to the point where you can understand the corrections. A lot of the time people will give corrections (especially at the beginner level) that end up changing the meaning from what you wanted it to mean. So as a beginner that can be frustrating. If I can think of an example I'll edit and post it below.
Korean,3bosz6,CourageNA,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:02:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Sometimes they changed it to sound more natural but it ends up not saying what I meant to say.  Also it's hit or miss if they explain why they changed it.  Overall I think it's a very useful tool. But it's best to be sure you are also correcting others. I end up getting so many friend requests but I never get to correcting all their journals in the end, I usually do the people who post most often because it appears on the recent friends entry list."
Korean,3bosz6,today2day,3,Wed Jul 1 23:11:32 2015 UTC,"My thing with it is just my own laziness. I have a lot of problem with the level i have to write something interesting for me (in the sense of practising what i already know but not making something too basic to be useful to learn). I know some conjunctions and structures for making a text but i get frustrated to what to write about or to be consulting the dictionary every 3 words because i don't a lot of vocabulary so i cross out making a text. But making phrases (like 10 interesting different ones) while useful is very time consuming. As a student by hobby i go from phases of complete dedication to phases of demotivation + other real studies so i go long periods of time without studying korean. When i come back i feel the obligation of reviewing all my notes and vocabulary so it's like a great mountain to surmount every time. Also, just studying is easier and less time consuming so i never get to make practise phrases. It's that thing that i have on my head constantly but i never get to do because i feel i have to do other things first every day.   Surprisingly enough when it comes to correcting things in my language i do it a lot more. I think it's because as a native speaker it's kind of a challenge to correct things and to guess what they were trying to say. Taking a text completely broken and rebuild it while giving tips on the correct form.  Most people just do it to gain positions on the correct queue to get more people to correct them so they do it half-assed very quickly to be the first and gain the points. In the other hand a lot of the people who want a correction is to make for them their own homework or to translate huge walls of text for some professional endeavour. Btw, obviously no one wants to translate them so if you take your time to do it you will be first and gain enough points to have a good position.   About the corrections, i haven't had a bad experience myself. As more people correct you, you will see what is the correct translation more and more people ask you about what you mean that try to make their own version. The problem is when they talk to you in korean to give you a tip because you don't understand them, obviously."

Korean,3blzhc,Tamagogo,3,Tue Jun 30 08:19:09 2015 UTC,"Hmm, since you say you are 중급..with your flair; id say watching shows without subtitles is a good idea, even if you cant understand everything. I think i started watching shows with no subs initially being only to understand about 60% of what was being said..depending on the contents of the show; but it has increased a lot since I started.  Weening yourself off of subtitles trains your ear and brain to better listen to the language being spoken and to try to understand it."
Korean,3blzhc,imbrad91,3,Tue Jun 30 09:47:50 2015 UTC,"Just to add to this, I think this is a good technique and especially because I also think it is important to make sure you hear a lot of different voices, rather than just your teacher's and other student's.  My entire social circle is basically aged 20-35, fairly young. I can understand those people fine. However, older individuals (my friends' parents, politicians, professors, etc.) are much more difficult. This manifested most clearly when I wrote the TOPIK II and had an incredibly difficult time deciphering the dialogue with older speakers.  Both the accent and 말투 of the older generation tends to be different, and while most young people converge to Seoul dialect (if that's where you live), that is less common amongst the older generation, many of whom grew up outside of Seoul or Gyeongi-do.  It took me an entire semester to even begin to consistently understand one professor despite listening to him every week."

They have free MP3 files and scripts that go along with them. It really helped me with my listening as well as hearing how people speak conversationally. They speak a little slower and more simply than Koreans usually speak, but it is still natural speech."
Korean,3blzhc,mickeybell3,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:01:25 2015 UTC,"If you already built strong vocabulary and are an intermediate-level, you may want to try dictation practice with Youtube videos that reflect real conversation - listening and writing down line by line and go back to your own writing to compare it against subtitles. Do one short video clip like 1-2 minutes per day consistently. You'll see that your listening comprehension will gradually increase after a few months later.  You could do that at viki.com. If you feel that dictation with Viki is challenging for you, laughingbeans.com can be an alternative -it's focused on listening and vocabulary."
Korean,3bk2t0,ralphplzgo,11,Mon Jun 29 21:32:09 2015 UTC,"A랑 B is a colloquial form of A와 B. 요 adds a bit of politeness on top of it. It may slightly sound like childish if used like this;  Mother: 생일 선물로 뭐 사줄까?  Son: 뽀로로 인형이랑요 자전거랑요 변신로봇 사주세요.   Since ~랑요 is polite and soft it works well when ordering a food. If you take out 요, you can stay in adult tone, still more colloquial than 와 though.  햄버거랑 우유를 같이 먹는 게 햄버거랑 콜라를 같이 먹는 것 보다 몸에 더 좋습니다.   Yes. A하고 B하세요. means Please A and then B. It suggests that the speaker wants listener to do A and then B. So 드시고 → 가세요 implies that the speaker wants you to have some before leaving. A low form equivalent would be 먹고 가.  밥 안 먹고 지금 가게? 먹고 가."

If you really want to learn Korean, then the best way to achieve it is to set personal goals and not tell anybody about them. You need to link the social rewards of learning Korean with the actual work of learning Korean.  If you simply announce that you're learning Korean then you receive some social/psychological reward without putting in any work. Since you've already won that benefit by announcing it, there's even less reason to do the work.  See more here:  http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_keep_your_goals_to_yourself?language=en"

But it was lucky I did that, because I now know that if I'd told everyone I was doing it, I wouldn't have done it.

Korean,3bj9x6,HiImJan,37,Mon Jun 29 18:04:30 2015 UTC,The actual words are 언니 and 형. Romanizations don't mean anything. They're just a handicap for people who can't read 한글. Don't rely on them to be helpful or accurate.
Korean,3bj9x6,klangs,8,Mon Jun 29 18:11:07 2015 UTC,"Just to go off of what the other person said, romanization is supposed to help people who can't read Korean to be able to somewhat pronounce the words. It isn't a 1:1 conversion or anything.  어 is one of those sounds that doesn't translate easy to English or a lot of other languages. It is romanized as ""eo"" technically. But just take 언니 and 형 for example. How would most English speakers pronounce ""eonni""? Ee-oh-knee. How would most English speakers pronounce ""hyeong""? Hyee-ohng. So people sometimes decide to write them as unni (more likely to be pronounced uh-nee which is closer to the real pronunciation) and hyung (more likely to be pronounced hyuhng).  This does present problems for people who can read Korean but are trying to read romanization. If someone didn't know better, they might think they are pronounced like 운니 and 흉 like you said. If I read a new word (or, more typically, a new name) in romanization, I always look up the actual Korean spelling so I know if they are using ""u"" for 우 or 어 (and other common weird romanizations) so that I don't end up mispronouncing names/words."
Korean,3bj9x6,iamkoalafied,2,Mon Jun 29 18:21:50 2015 UTC,There are different romanization systems. Learn to read the three major ones but don't use them much yourself.
Korean,3bj9x6,rnoyfb,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:35:41 2015 UTC,"You can find a lot of romanisations for the same word. Indeed, many romanisations online are very haphazard; not everyone uses exactly the same system, the one recommended by the Government of South Korea.  For 언니, you can find:   ""eonni"", the Revised Romanisation; ""unni""; ""unnie"", with a mute e after ""unni"" to avoid English speakers pronouncing it /ʌn.nɑi/.   And then for another useful word you should meet soon, 감사합니다, you can find:   ""gamsahabnida"", a transcription-focused romanisation; ""kamsahamnida"", the Revised Romanisation; ""kamsamnida"", a pronunciation aid, because, most of the time, Korean people will shorten the 합 syllable.   For a while, you will read 한글 much slower than Latin letters, and that's fine. However, the romanisation you will meet until then will confuse you unless it's used perfectly consistently (e.g. same textbook for everything).   ㅋ is romanised as k. Up there, I gave the ㄱ of 감사합니다 as 'k' too sometimes. Seeing 'o', you cannot be certain it's for 오. Someone may have written 'o' for the sound in 'orange'. That sound would be 어, i.e. 'eo'. Think of the romanisation of 김정은 as Kim Jong-un, which a transcription-based system would render as Gim Jeong-eun. Seeing 'u', you cannot be certain it's for 우. Someone may have written 'u' when they meant to write 'uh', the best approximation for 어 in English. It could even be 으! In names, you will also see Jung and not know if it's 중 or 정.   Yep. However difficult, you will need to learn 한글 to more effectively read Korean. Don't despair!"

Korean,3bifg9,signfang,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:40:32 2015 UTC,"Formal and pointlessly mouth-filling speech is indeed her unique trait. But in a language learning process you may want to listen to those official speech lines to widen your vocabulary and study those sentences to your benefit. I found fascinating that -- regardless of its content -- Obama and former presidents' free speech uses quite robust structure and terse words. Just a fluff that it is not the case for this presidency in Korea.   There is no need to bash or anything; unless that is what you had expected in this /r/Korean thread. This is not related to her intent or political point of view. Rather to point out that unlike Shakespeare's weird but beautiful literature it is possible to lost in words in the middle of an official speech.   Long story short, don't mimic her free speech to learn anything. That's the point, not bashing. :p  A bit OT: If I wanted to bash anything there are so many dramas these days that I don't even have to mention it. Why should I bother?

Korean,3bdhwq,OlderThanGif,3,Sun Jun 28 05:01:51 2015 UTC,"Just went to my first Korean language exchange here. It was my first time trying to talk with native Koreans (who weren't my Korean professor). Can confirm that my pronunciation is worse than I thought and they had trouble understanding me sometimes. (Sorry, not to be discouraging, but it's the truth. Maybe you'll be better than me)  Chances are you can find someone who's friendly and willing to correct your pronunciation, though. E.g., if you're ordering something from a shop/restaurant, try it in Korean first, and if they give you a blank look, switch to English and say ""I was trying to say XXX"" and they'll probably tell you the right pronunciation."

I'm always told that I'm good, which I instantly ignore because all Koreans say that, but the main point is that they also say they understand perfectly. And that's the key. As long as you are understood. If you say something wrong they'll look super confused, so try enunciating until you get it.   It is hard though, especially when you have to talk to new people everyday.  It'll get easier though."

Korean,3baexl,dlwhdgns10,5,Sat Jun 27 09:45:36 2015 UTC,"I am going to say Anki, with this shared deck: Korean Vocabulary by Evita, for the following reasons:  a) Your English appears to be good, so you can actually use the reverse (English) side of the cards of this deck to help you make associations with the Korean written form you see on the front side.  b) The deck starts with basic words, and this being a spaced repetition program, you will continue seeing these basic words once in a while. Having a constant reminder of the spelling of those words will be good.  c) Your Korean is good enough to sound out the words in the first place. Upon seeing the written form, if you know enough Hangeul, you will probably be like ""Oh, that's how it's written!""    After the card is revealed, if it had a sound that confuses you (e.g. word-final edit: syllable-final ㅆ, ㅐ/ㅔ, ㅟ/ㅚ/ㅞ/ㅙ) you can write both sides of the card onto a sheet of paper (e.g.   네 - yes 있다 - to exist   ) and then just the Korean words on another. You would then be practicing your writing.  On the sheet where only the Korean words are written, take the nouns and verbs you've written and make sentences with them. Having written only the Korean words on this sheet, you will practice reading, writing, and solidifying your spelling.  Written grammar (e.g. how do I write this past tense I know how to say) is another thing; you might need something else for that."

Korean,3b69qm,Nebuleon,8,Fri Jun 26 08:55:52 2015 UTC,"About the first question.   ""여자과"" --> ""여자와"" While it makes sense, nobody will speak like that.    For literal translation you would want to say: ""이 분이 한국어를 못하셔서요. 기다리게 해서 죄송합니다."" which translate back to English as ""(I interpreted for her) Because this person cannot speak Korean. Sorry for the wait."" But I would say only ""이 분이 한국어를 못하셔서요."", because speaking the second sentence will make them wait even longer.  You wouldn't say ""여자"" or ""a woman"" to someone next to you. Nor ""그녀"" or ""her"". Those words are for someone who's not there(e.g. ""그 여자는 한국어를 못해요.""). To point at someone next to you, you would say your relationship between her. 이 분 is used for an acquaintance like a guest or a business partner. 제 친구 is used for male or female friend. 제 여자친구 is your girlfriend. For your family member you would specify who she is to you(제 어머니, 제 아내, 제 누나, 제 여동생...).  The wording ""말할 수 없다"" feels like she is not able to speak anything, or she is forbidden to speak Korean. That's why I used ""못하다""(not good at). You may use ""모르다""(don't know) as well.  You use ""지연하다"" when a plane, a train or a bus is delayed. In this case you would want to use ""기다리다"".  The second question is already explained and there's nothing to add."
Korean,3b69qm,tumnaselda,2,Fri Jun 26 13:21:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your answer. I had a hunch that the sentence could be simplified, but wanted to practice making an adjective for a person (""person who is ..."") for longer sentences later. Things like ""among us, there are some Korean-speaking people and some English-speaking people"". My situation was super bad for this, though.  Saying ""sorry for the wait"" does extend the wait, and so does explaining the interpretation, and they see the woman next to me, so ""... 여자"" doesn't fit. So the situation really is bad for this sentence! :( Maybe I should have introduced it in a different way, like ""I am responding to a phone call in what is, to people around me, a foreign language. After seeing this, they are a bit suspicious of me, so they ask me why that is. I explain it like so after hanging up: I came here with a woman who doesn't speak Korean."" Then the first sentence would make a bit more sense, except for grammar errors of course :)  [*여자과 / 여자와] Is it something simple like ~와 after a vowel and ~과 after a consonant? Though that would confuse me a bit at first, because of 는 and 를 following the opposite rule for 은 and 을. If it's something more complex than that, I'll pick it up with more learning material, don't worry.  [지연하다 / 기다리다] And I even used 지연하다 incorrectly! I guess the bus driver would say this, then:  지연하게 해서 죄송합니다. = Being-delayed so/because apologise. / We apologise for the delay.    I don't exactly want to delete the grammar practice from my sentence. With that in mind, would this be an appropriate correction?  한국어를 못하는 여자와 함께 여기 (한국에) 왔어요. = [[Korean language] <do not> woman] with together [here (Korea)] came. / I came here (to Korea) with a woman who does not speak Korean."
Korean,3b69qm,tumnaselda,2,Fri Jun 26 18:44:09 2015 UTC,"Your corrected sentence is grammatically correct. Your original sentence was also grammatically correct, except ""와/과"". The phone call situation is well fitting, and I would want to speak something like that.  와/과 problem is exactly something about what you're explaining. ex) 사과와(vowel)/계란과(consonant). Yes, it works the opposite way to 은/는 and 을/를. I didn't notice that myself until now... I think that's an exception.  EDIT: 지연하다 is to delay some event, presumably supposed to happen on a certain time, to later than that time. 기다리다 is to wait for an event to happen, or thing to come. In English you can say ""sorry for the delay"" instead of ""sorry for the waiting"", but in Korean you use them separately.  지연하다 is for a thing or event, 기다리다 is for a lifeform like animal or human. So, you would want to say: 버스(를) 기다리게 해서 죄송합니다 or 버스(가) 지연(되어) 죄송합니다. In your first situation, there was no event or thing to wait for, so you cannot say 지연하다 in that context. If they were waiting for you to do something for them, like taking them to somewhere, then you may say 지연하다. I don't know if your first use of 지연 is grammatically wrong, I'd rather say it was contextually wrong.  Another example: you're waiting for a 08:00 bus. It's 09:00 now. You are waiting for a bus, and it was delayed. Then: 버스가 지연되었습니다. 기다리게 해서 죄송합니다. 버스가 지연되어 죄송합니다.  It's quite hard to write, or create a new sentence. You may want to read a lot first. Maybe some stories for children. Because those stories tend to be short, use easier words, and grammatically correct."

From your description, it appears that both are for delays, but:   지연하다 is for the person who causes the delay, and 기다리다 is for the person who receives the delay.   I'll continue learning in any case. I'm saving your post for when I meet either of those words, so that I can re-read it. And I will definitely look up books and shows for children :)"

Korean,3b3bi9,Breadincaptivity,10,Thu Jun 25 17:06:26 2015 UTC,"Here's what I do, which I picked up from this sub somewhere.  Listen to Iyagi 1 once a day for two weeks. Then, look at the pdf and look up words/grammar until I understand it 100%.  Then listen to it again for the rest of the month.  I usually listen as I'm getting ready for bed.    Yes, it gets boring.  But it is very hard to forget those words and grammar rules after you've heard them over and over again for a month.  And they're not too long, so it's not too bad. Next month, move on to Iyagi 2 and so on!    To stop it from getting too boring, after I listen to that month's iyagi, I pick another one at random. I don't look it up or look at the pdf or anything, just listen to it.  Since doing this, my listening has improved leaps and bounds! Now I do 2 Iyagis a month, because 2 weeks is enough. Also, I find that I can understand about 60-70% of the random Iyagi on the first listen.    I still have a long way to go, but this has helped me out a lot. Maybe you'll find it useful, too. I've now started listening to Korean radio while I work, too. Most of the time I'm lost, but my skype partner has noticed a big improvement in my listening skills.  Good luck!"

Korean,3azpxg,OlderThanGif,7,Wed Jun 24 20:22:08 2015 UTC,"One thing to note:   I asked why the 늦다 is conjugated in past tense instead of 많다  ""I am late because there was traffic"" and ""I was late because there was traffic""   This is, to many learners, an apparent quirk in Korean. 늦다 in this context is not the adjective, ""to be late."" It is actually the action verb, ""to arrive late."" This is strange to a lot of English speakers who look it up in the dictionary; ""late"" is an adjective in English. So the translation that you often see: 늦다 = ""late"" is misleading.  Because 늦다 is an action verb in this context:   저는 늦습니다: I arrive late. 저는 늦었습니다: I arrived late.   If you were speaking in English, you wouldn't say ""I arrive late"" in the present tense (unless, for example, you were making a statement on your character, to say that you often arrive late to appointments)."
Korean,3azpxg,theghostofm,3,Wed Jun 24 20:32:14 2015 UTC,"Oh that's good to know! This was the first time we'd used 늦다 in class. I just assumed it was like ""being late""."
Korean,3azpxg,theghostofm,2,Wed Jun 24 20:39:32 2015 UTC,"It can be the adjective ""to be late"" as well! Just not in this case. It depends on the context!"
Korean,3azpxg,chantroll,4,Wed Jun 24 20:40:38 2015 UTC,"You cannot conjugate a word into the past tense and then use 어서.  It is not grammatically correct.    차가 많았습니다 + 그래서 늦었습니다 = 차가 많아서 늦었습니다. (차가 많았어서 늦었습니다. is not a grammatically correct sentence nor is anything else that has 았어서 in it.)    Only the second part of the sentence (늦었습니다) is possible to put in the past tense.  This is true for all verbs and adjectives.    배고파서 먹었습니다 (o) I was hunger, so I ate. 배고팠어서 먹었습니다 (x)    The first clause can be in the past even when the second clause is in the present.  As in:    점심을 안 먹어서 지금 먹고 있습니다. I didn't eat lunch, so I am eating now. (Not I am not eating lunch, so I am eating now)"
Korean,3azpxg,random117,2,Wed Jun 24 22:24:01 2015 UTC,"The final verb normally dictates the tense of the sentence.  사과 먹고 잤어요 (I ate an apple and then slept)  But you CAN throw past tense on the first clause if you want, it just may not be as natural.  사과 먹었고 잤어요 (same thing, but may not be as natural)  In the case of 아/어서 grammar these rules still apply. I'd recommend you always try and convey the tense of the sentence in the final verb unless it just isn't possible. For instance if you wanted to say something like ""I don't want to see that movie cause I already saw it"". It wouldn't really be natural to use 아/어서 here so I'd change up to the ~니까 grammar.  그 영화를 이미 봤으니까 보고 싶지 않아요 (good)  그 영화를 이미 봤어서 보고 싶지 않아요 (kinda weird... )"

Korean,3awv8b,perkinwarbeck,7,Wed Jun 24 03:41:49 2015 UTC,"I think 'hey' looks silly, in my opinion. Hae gets the pronunciation meaning across without seeming like you don't know 'hey' or childish or anything. To me, Sung is not so bad and is more effective for pronunciation for people who don't know how to pronounce things. Good luck, I can imagine how frustratingly tedious this might be!"
Korean,3awv8b,carolion9,4,Wed Jun 24 04:44:17 2015 UTC,"I think ""hey"" is silly as well. My personal opinion is that hye is the best way to go. It's not perfect, but it's the most true to the original. My SO also has 혜 in her name both of us think that ""hye"" is the clear choice. Hae is usually 해 so that could confuse people who are familiar with Korean names.  Sung is fine in my opinion, so ""Sung-hye"" and ""Sung (First name) Hye (Middle name)"" seem good to me.  But in the end, transliterating a name has no real science. Go with whatever you both feel most comfortable with."
Korean,3awv8b,theghostofm,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:15:43 2015 UTC,"I'd absolutely go with Sung-Hye but I guess it's her own name so she'll never chose that since you said she doesn't like it..  And then it'd have to be Sung Hye.   If simply avoiding gross mispronunciations (with small mispronunciations being fine) is the issue, it honestly might be best to just drop the H and go with Sungye. Like, if we take 10,000 Americans (I assume you live in America) and let them pronounce all the names in this thread I'd say on average Sungye would be closer than the others because there's no issue like the occasional person pronouncing ""hye"" as ""high"" or other such things. You'd have to be mental to interpret that as ""Sun-gye"" or something.  I don't know why you'd possibly go with ""hey"", don't do that.  But yeah, there's a good reason why the hyphen is the default/is very popular, especially with names where there are potential misinterpretations."
Korean,3awv8b,Areumdaun,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:23:21 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend going with Sunghye, Sunghay, or Sunghey. And then ditch the middle name, or pick up a new one. Hyphenating would add confusion because nowadays hyphens are becoming more popular among women as a way to retain their maiden names after marrying somebody.  In the west we usually stick to just first names.  But in Korea most people usually combine a persons' first and middle name when they name somebody. I think your wife would probably be more comfortable with strangers calling her ""Sung Hye"" instead of just ""Hye"". But it's really up to her."
Korean,3awv8b,robobob9000,0,Thu Jun 25 15:31:37 2015 UTC,"Sunghyae? Or Sunghae suggested elsewhere. I know a girl who's called Hye-, everyone in the UK called her High-.  I think a hyphen is the way to go, otherwise you could find people pronouncing it Sun-gay or sung-ay."
Korean,3awv8b,BruceJi,4,Wed Jun 24 10:27:27 2015 UTC,"You may already be aware of this, but I feel it's worth pointing out that ""hyae"" is usually used for 햬, not 혜, and ""hae"" for 해."

Korean,3avkxx,Darmang,14,Tue Jun 23 21:16:34 2015 UTC,"If you're good at 하다 verb, here's a really easy rule of thumb.  As an example, let's see which one's correct between ""어쩌다 이렇게 됐니?""/""어쩌다 이렇게 됬니?""   Isolate the word that has 되/돼 from the sentence. So here, 됐니 and 됬니 Change 되 into 하, and 돼 into 해. So 됐니 -> 했니, 됬니 -> 핬니 See which one makes sense(This is why you need to be good at 하다 verb to use this rule!). In this case, 했니 is the one that sounds alright. Substitute the correct one back and we have the answer. 했니 was correct, and since we changed 돼 into 해, if we put it back -- the proper one in this sentence is 됐니.   Therefore the correct sentence is ""어쩌다 이렇게 됐니?""  And if we apply this rule to your question, ""고용됐습니다"" is correct.  FYI, 됬 is NEVER CORRECT - since there's no such thing as 핬"
Korean,3avkxx,UidX,5,Tue Jun 23 23:17:10 2015 UTC,This. I always use this method.
Korean,3avkxx,oree94,3,Tue Jun 23 23:55:11 2015 UTC,"돼 is short for 되어(되다 + -어). So when you stick 되어 in where 돼 is, it should still make sense. For example, in 고용됐습니다, if you switch out 돼 with 되어, 고용되었습니다,it still makes sense. That's when you should use 돼. In contrast, in 나는 고용돼고 싶다, replacing 돼 with 되어 (나는 고용되어고 싶다) does not make sense, therefore this sentence is incorrect.  Many Korean speakers cannot distinguish between 되 and 돼, but it was distinguishable sometime in the 1930s, so that's why 되/돼 is confusing to many Koreans as well."
Korean,3avkxx,mujjingun,5,Tue Jun 23 23:02:14 2015 UTC,I once wrote about an article about 되 and 돼. You can see the link here.   http://wiseinit.com/2015/05/13/%EB%90%98%EB%8F%BC-korean-grammar-vs-grammar-6/

Korean,3avkxx,japrappp,5,Tue Jun 23 22:32:09 2015 UTC,고용됐는다   I think you meant to write 고용됐다.
Korean,3avkxx,Pikmeir,2,Tue Jun 23 22:35:01 2015 UTC,되다 is the unconjugated word  돼 is 되 + ㅓ (even the picture matches up); that's the conjugated word. there is no 돼다  So if you want to use it in past-tense it'd be 됐습니다  Using 됬습니다 would be like saying 핬습니다 ~ it's just simple incorrect conjugation :D  If you wanted to use present tense 되다 it'd be 됩니다.

Hopefully you remember that the present tense polite form is 던지 + 어 + 요, which in contracted form becomes 던져요.   For the exact same reason...  던지다 in past tense = 던지 + 었 + 다, which becomes 던졌다.

This little trick may be incomplete, but I found so far that 있다 is used when you want to describe the existence of something, and 이다 is used to describe the quality of something, if a more descriptive verb is not available (for example, 춥다, to be cold; 작다, to be small; ...)."
Korean,3amml4,Nebuleon,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:12:53 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the the first part. What do you mean ""to describe the existence of something? Can you give me an example?"

Despite using ""is"" in English, you would use the verb for ""be small"" in Korean.  b) ""The book is in my bag."" This use of ""is"" describes the existence of an object and qualifies its location. You would use 있다 here.  c) ""I am a student."" This use of ""is"" describes the quality of a person, as if by the equation me = student. You would use 이다 here.  Try making the sentences I just made in Korean :) Or some others, if you don't know the words for the objects I used as examples."

However, don't let that confuse you. 그러다 is not the verb base of the adjective 그런 - that is 그렇다."
Korean,3alju7,theghostofm,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:14:47 2015 UTC,"So 그러다 is kind of like saying 'to do smth like that', and it's conjugated form 그래요 is a way of saying 'Yeah! (like that)' right?

If you are saying “거실에 [텔레비전 한 대, 식탁 한 개, 의자 여섯 개]가 있어요.”, you are grouping 텔레비전, 식탁, 의자. In other words, you are putting more emphasis on list of items.  If you are saying “거실에 [텔레비전]이 한 대, [식탁]이 한 개, [의자]가 여섯 개 있어요.”, you are listing 텔레비전, 식탁, 의자 separately. In other words, you are putting more emphasis on the individual items.

Korean,3afjl7,lipglosschaos,12,Fri Jun 19 18:46:45 2015 UTC,"It's a little hard to give a direct answer to this question because it varies. Somewhere about 60%-70% of Korean Vocabulary is Sino in origin. Some portion of that is Sino-Japanese in origin, in that they're Chinese words borrowed into Korean through Japanese. (I should also note I'm not sure how much of that 60%-70% is commonly spoken words)   So what's worth noting here, is that that percentage is not borrowings from MODERN Chinese, but mostly from Middle Chinese. And in the past 1500 years or so, a lot has changed.  Basically, what I'm trying to say here is that you will see some words that are the same, some other words you can guess at, some words that look similar but are different, some characters that you don't recognize at all because they are either Chinese specific or either the Chinese or Hanja was simplified in one way, and some words that have the same characters but the character means something else.  So this is why ""some"" is the best answer I can give you. Though I think it'd be easier if you were looking at Sino-Japanese words instead of Chinese because the Sino words in Japanese are from a similar time period (and the earliest words were borrowed from China to Japan THROUGH Korea)."
Korean,3afjl7,Pennwisedom,2,Fri Jun 19 19:06:42 2015 UTC,But if you know your Classical Chinese even at a basic level it will help. Most of the borrowed words will be obvious to anyone who knows Chinese if you show them the hanja even if it's no longer used in modern Chinese or was coined outside China.

The past tests can be found on the TOPIK website (topik.go.kr) or on various other bligs about it. I would just google topik test 38 answer sheet and it should give you some result on where to find it. Also, there's a couple new good books for the test. Make sure they say ""new TOPIK"" though.   After studying for a year somewhat hard, I was about 24 points away from a level 2 comfortably. Could I have done better? Probably if I hadn't blown off the test in the final weeks and done some good studying. Take it once as a baseline, and improve from there!"

I've swapped the 나 to 저 and formed the sentences in a respectful form.   저는 꽃을 사랑합니다 - This is a literal/direct translation based on your sentence. However, 사랑 is more often used to imply romantic love. 저는 꽃을 좋아합니다 - This is closer to ""I like flowers"" - you can use adjectives later to make it more powerful if you want.   There are more ways to do it; these two are just examples."

Korean,3a79hk,Nebuleon,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:23:19 2015 UTC,"SO, 를, is to make the noun the object of the verb, and, 는, is to talk about the object?"
Korean,3a79hk,theghostofm,2,Wed Jun 17 20:35:47 2015 UTC,"를 ends the object, and 는 ends the subject, or topic. However, after a noun that ends with a consonant, 를 becomes 을, and 는 becomes 은.  저는 꽃을 좋아합니다. = I-subject flowers-object like (think are nice). / I like flowers.  저를 고양이는 좋아합니다. = I-object cat(s)-subject like (think is nice). / Cats like me.  고양이는 나를 사랑해. = Cat(s)-subject I-object love (do love). / Cats love me."
Korean,3a79hk,theghostofm,3,Wed Jun 17 21:01:59 2015 UTC,"I added the 을 object particle. In grammar (English as well as Korean) the object is the target of the verb. In this case, ""Flowers"" is the object and gets the 을 particle.  The 하 in 사랑합니다 comes from the verb for ""love,"" 사랑하다. The ㅂ니다 part is how you conjugate 하다 verbs in the respectful form."
Korean,3a79hk,Nebuleon,2,Wed Jun 17 20:23:23 2015 UTC,"Most institutions teach the ㅂ니다 form first and encourage it for a few reasons. I think the two biggest reasons are:   ㅂ니다 is the easiest conjugation to do for beginners. This is because it is ㅂ니다/습니다 for all verbs and there's no need to work out 해 vs 어/아 (not to mention diphthong conjugations). when ㅂ니다 is the habit you first learned, it's helpful because it becomes your default when you mess up. It's much better to risk accidentally saying ""합니다"" to a close friend than it is to risk saying ""해"" to your boss."
Korean,3a79hk,hiimbears,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:39:32 2015 UTC,"I'll agree with you there. Just for the simple fact that ""I like/love flowers"" isn't something you really say to someone without knowing them well! :D  Anyway, for other sentences, it will become important for the submitter to distinguish 나 from 저, and use the proper one for the ""verb politeness"". *[나는 꽃을 좋습니다] is just as incorrect as *[저는 꽃을 좋아해], for example.  This comment by kokoyaya keeps the 나 and and changes the noun 사랑 to the verb 사랑해, from the basic form 사랑하다. And that's fine. theghostofm decided to go the other way, to keep the intent of the sentence but discard the 나, changing the noun 사랑 to the verbs 사랑합니다 and 좋아합니다. That's also fine.  Those are two directions the sentence went with corrections, but as long as /u/PlanetFlyTrap is able to know what's different about the two corrections, then nothing is lost; if anything, now the submitter knows that there are at least three ways to conjugate a verb in Korean for politeness, that the difference is very important, and that *[나는 꽃을 좋습니다] and *[저는 꽃을 좋아해] are incorrect. These are all very good starting points for further learning."
Korean,3a79hk,theghostofm,14,Thu Jun 18 16:21:59 2015 UTC,"You used 사랑 as a noun, not as a verb which is what I believe you intended to do. ""To love"" is 사랑하다.  Edit: Why was I downvoted....? lmao"
Korean,3a79hk,oree94,4,Thu Jun 18 18:18:38 2015 UTC,This is incorrect.    사랑 is the noun. 사랑하다 is the verb. 사랑하 is the verb stem.  사랑하는 것 and 사랑하기 are gerunds.   Unfortunately 사랑는 것 is nothing. It is grammatically incorrect because 사랑다 is not a verb.
Korean,3a79hk,theghostofm,4,Wed Jun 17 20:05:53 2015 UTC,No I'm pretty sure 사랑 is a noun. To love would be 사랑하다 like hiimbears said. 사랑하는 것 could mean 'to love' but it could also mean 'A thing that a person loves'.
Korean,3a79hk,oree94,3,Thu Jun 18 08:52:36 2015 UTC,Verb stem in most grammar books I've seen.   Verb stem is the verb with the 다 removed. So for 하다 verbs (such as 사랑하다) the verb stem is -하.  https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Korean/Verbs#Verb_stems
Korean,3a79hk,kokoyaya,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:06:25 2015 UTC,http://goo.gl/D3ODhD  That's the link to the naver definition of 사랑 and here it's categorized as a noun. I'm confused now...
Korean,3a79hk,hypountalentless,3,Thu Jun 18 09:09:55 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have a verb in it yet. I assume you're trying to say ""I love flowers"" which would be 나는 꽃 사랑해. 사랑 by itself just means love (noun)"
Korean,3a79hk,yoheist,3,Thu Jun 18 09:18:07 2015 UTC,"As everyone else said, you would want to use the verb form. But, on the other hand, I am flower love. Isn't so bad."

And then the script thinks the page is just blank and serves no font. :/  Though, yes, this is nice for pages that actually have the text on them and in which the script just helps with the font.  edit: Nope.

I used ""Korean Grammar in Use Intermediate"" and wrote extensively on lang-8.com to improve my writing. I also watch only korean tv and listen only to korean music. I took about 15~20 practice tests (actual past tests plus mock tests from a book). The mock tests will really help you work on using time effectively and give you an idea of what grammar will appear.  For level 4 and up you MUST cram vocabulary. The intermediate test uses lots of tricky synonyms to trip you up. You need to starting knowing business/political/ecenomics vocab."

Grammar in Use's intermediate book and an intermediate vocabulary book (2000+ words), accompanied by a lot of dialogue listening (ttmik 이야기 or just CD dialogues) is enough to breeze through a level 3 quite easily.

Korean,39z61a,something_clever2012,3,Tue Jun 16 00:03:25 2015 UTC,"I started with dramas. Even if you think they're cheesy (and so many of them are!) they're great practice. Watch them with subtitles, repeat after the actors when you can, and you'll start to pick up on vocabulary and context. But the biggest help, at least for me, is for pronunciation and intonation. Even as a gyopo, unless your parents talk to you constantly, you won't be able to mimic pronunciation and intonation well unless you practice it a lot. (I swear it works; people always assume I'm a Korean if I speak with them on the phone and are shocked when they blonde American me in person.)  Or, as other people have said, go to Korea. I was at Yonsei for a year and I loved it. There's no substitute for full immersion."
Korean,39z61a,cameliabadelia,2,Tue Jun 16 12:09:27 2015 UTC,"Had a Korean friend who lived in the US for almost 10 years and went to same high school and college as me but still had many, many grammar mistakes in her English.  She also had a dream to become a reporter for the news stations that broadcast in Korean in the US.  Every week I sent her a Naver article that I would find online and she would record with her ""recorder voice"" herself reading the article aloud at 3 speeds, slow, medium, and fast and send it back to me for practice. And in exchange I edited her English blog every week for grammar mistakes and to make it more natural.  I would read the news articles along with her recordings and practice learning like that.  After a year of this, my Korean seemed to get much much better from it."

My interest at that point was around Korean high-fantasy novels, as you can tell from the titles I've listed. Do not, however, limit yourself to books. Language is applicable to virtually anything, meaning that you can (and should) use it to your full extent. Browse web just like you would in English, read news, go on and on. (This applies to every language, of course.)  But novel is a good start.  I also need to remind you that these tips are somewhat exclusive to reading skills. Make sure you maintain your listening/speaking skills by using them frequently. Doesn't have to be with another person. Talking to yourself can do pretty good job on maintaining your speech. Yes, I know it sounds weird, but it works. You're thinking more while you talk to yourself."

Korean,39ylja,SolidSyco,23,Mon Jun 15 21:09:47 2015 UTC,"Welcome to /r/korean!  It's great that you're learning Korean and Japanese. You'll find that Korean, much like Japanese, has varying levels of speech. It also has rules for conjugating verbs when communicating.  For example, 안녕하세요. 리암입니다 is a fully conjugated statement, using a respectful form. However, 일본어 공부하다 is not conjugated - in order to keep the same conjugation from 라암입니다 and apply it here, you could write 일본어 공부합니다. The same goes for 한국어 모르다 => 한국어 모릅니다.  맘대로 해 is also conjugated, but is very informal and can be very rude if you're not saying it to (for example) a close friend. I'm not sure what you were trying to communicate here, to be honest, so I can't really suggest a solid alternative. However, a respectful conjugation and spelling would be 마음대로 하세요.  I hope you're having fun with Korean! What got you into it? (And Japanese as well? I've studied Japanese in the past and enjoy some anime)"

Korean,39ylja,theghostofm,5,Tue Jun 16 12:28:02 2015 UTC,"Typically you'd use 저도 rather than 나도 when using a '~ㅂ니다' ending. Also, 도 normally replaces 은/는.

Think:  (은/는): I drink coffee however TINTIN (emphasised) drinks milk.  = 저는 커피를 마셔요 그런데 Tintin은 우유를 머셔요.  (도): I drink coffee. Tintin ALSO drinks coffee.  저는 커피를 마셔요. Tintin도 커피를 마셔요.

You could also try to create a unique Korean name based off of the general vowels and consonants in your name. If that doesn't seem to work, try searching for similar name meanings? Or something completely unrelated to your name entirely!  Have fun with it, OP! There are no rules here. Think of it this way...the name ""Ivan"" will never sound Korean no matter how you spell it, pronounce it, etc...so take advantage of that and get creative."

Korean,39y5jm,gujayeon,6,Mon Jun 15 19:21:36 2015 UTC,아이완 Aeewan might be closer to the sound you want if you really want to avoid the ㅂ b sound.  이반 or 아이반 is probably your best bet though.
Korean,39y5jm,theghostofm,5,Mon Jun 15 21:13:59 2015 UTC,"Koreans usually use ""뷔"" to mean V so if you desperately wanted to emulate the V as much as possible, you could use the awkward-sounding ""아이봔"" but I definitely don't recommend that.  아이반 seems to be closest to your name without going too overboard. Edit: Korea has a pretty close tie with Russia which is why the suggested romanization sounds like Eevahn rather than aeevehn like in English."

Korean,39vzw5,calhix,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:12:48 2015 UTC,A lot of native speakers use the wrong words. There was a Korean girl in my high level class that always said 가르키다 instead of 가르치다. You can hear the words being misused on Korean TV shows as well.
Korean,39vzw5,calhix,2,Mon Jun 15 17:02:54 2015 UTC,"Using ""to indicate"" in your English translations to me sounds a bit unnatural, although it makes sense and is grammatically correct.    Usually, the subject of ""to indicate"" is implying a conclusion or meaning. For example, ""the stab wound on the victim's abdomen indicates a large knife was used"". Here, something observed leads us to a conclusion.  You wouldn't say ""the stab wound on the victim's abdomen indicates a knife"". Saying this begs the question, ""what about the knife?""  In your example ""그녀는 손가락으로 태양을 가리켰다."" I would translate it as ""she pointed out the sun with her finger"".  Here, she is merely drawing attention to the sun, but not making any further conclusions or meanings about the sun. ""To point out"" sounds more natural to me than ""to indicate"" for this reason.  왜 책상 위를 가리키고 있는 거야? to me would be ""Why are you pointing out the top of the desk?"" This is because, you are, once again, drawing peoples' attention to something, but not making a statement about it.  If anyone disagrees with me, let me know. I could probably make a few more examples that show more clearly why ""to indicate"" sounds weird here and how to better use it.  TL;DR ""To point out"" would be a more natural and better suited verb for 가리키다 in your examples rather than ""to indicate""."
Korean,39vzw5,Dhghomon,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:33:06 2015 UTC,"In the dictionary, indicate has the meaning of ""point out"" as the fourth definition. I first thought that it was the first meaning.   Thank you for correcting me. I learned a lot from you."

That second character not only has the meaning of etc., but it can also mean level, class, or kind. For example, 고등 학교 or 高等學校 means high school in Korean (literally, high level school). In this case though I believe it may also be referring to 登, which has many meanings as well, including to record, publish or even put forth.   For this sentence, I would translate it as follows:  The immediate response team was made up of 20 people: 10 were civilian experts and the Department of Health and Human Services put forth 6 from the (disease) Prevention Division, and 4 from the Epidemiology Research Division.

Korean,39olzq,UidX,5,Sat Jun 13 07:18:14 2015 UTC,"For adjectives (descriptive verbs) and the copulas (이다 / 아니다), what looks like ""past tense"" (for action verbs!) is actually just present tense. Past tense for adjectives and copula is 았/었+던. So you get 의사였던 사람, as per your example.  So while 똥 싼 사람 is past tense. 똥인 사람 is just ""person who is poop"" (disclaimer: the amount of sense that second one will actually make depends... on a lot of things, there's better ways to say someone's poopy).   So to recap: 똥싸는 사람 (present tense) ""Pooping person"" / ""person who is pooping"" 똥싼 사람 (past tense) ""person who pooped"" 구린 사람 (present tense) ""poopy person"" 구렸던 사람 (past tense) ""person who was poopy""  --> 구리다  --> If you don't quite get why it's 던 or where all that came from right now, don't worry, 더 will make a reappearance in a couple more grammar forms down the line, for now just remember 았/었던 for past tense adjectives."

Korean,39olzq,sy_park,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:52:01 2015 UTC,"인 is the conjugated, attached-to-a-noun form of the special adjective 이다, which is, naturally, conjugated as an adjective. When turning an adjective into a form that can go before a noun, we add ~ㄴ/은 after the adjective (아름답다 ~ 아름다운, 예쁘다 ~ 예쁜, sorry I couldn't think of any adjectives ending in 자음 that isn't 비읍 and would turn to ~은). While 이다 is still considered a special type of adjective, it's still conjugated as one, so it's conjugated form (when a noun follows it) would become ~인. When introducing yourself, you would normally say: 안녕하세요, 저는 [이름]입니다. The part where you say [이름]입니다 works just like the conjugated, noun-preceding form of 이다, which means you could put, or in other words attach, a noun, probably any noun, before 이다. In other words, you could also introduce yourself by saying: 안녕하세요, 제가 [이름]인 거예요. The form you mentioned is the kind of form I explained. While one could say ""그 사람은 의사예요."", you could turn it into a clause as in, 의사인 그 사람은.... and so and so. To turn an adjective that precedes a noun into the past form, you need to use ~았/었던, unlike in verbs where you only need to put ~ㄴ/은 after the verb. So to turn 의사인 사람, the present form, into its past form, all we do is conjugate 이다 and add ~았/었던 to it, so that it turns to: 의사였던 사람. We could now put that clause into a sentence like: 지금 의사였던 그 사람은 자기가 일한 병원에서 퇴직했어요. ~ The person who was a doctor has now retired from the hospital he worked in. The sentence sounds unnatural because I translated it as directly as I can^ I hope this helps~"

Related concepts are:   channeling (spiritual), a process by which someone can reportedly become a conduit for spiritual entities; mediums in a large sense, people with psychic powers, able to channel spirits and become conduits for them; in the context of God specifically, manifestations of God as physical entities, or being a prophet or messenger, someone who has received instruction and retells it for others.

My other question is about usage (I suppose). Take, for example, the character 何. While this character is a more formal word for ""what"" in Mandarin, it is a more informal word for ""what"" in Japanese (please correct me if I'm wrong, my understanding of Japanese is very limited). So, my question is, are there many characters like this when comparing Chinese and Korean?"
Korean,398qo7,sancho_bulge,3,Wed Jun 10 09:41:50 2015 UTC,"I know we are waiting for sainthkh to reply, but I do have some insights into this I can add. I know it's not directly what you asked, but maybe you'll find it interesting.  The biggest difference you'll notice between Chinese hanzi and Korean hanja is the simplification of characters (jiantizi 簡體字) used by mainland China and communities that lean culturally towards mainland China. While Korean has some shorthand characters, they were never made official; in other words, there is no direct equivalent to jiantizi in Korean.  To compare: In mainland China, one would write 汉语 (Hànyǔ) ""Chinese (language)"", whereas in Korea with hanja those characters could only be 漢語 한어 (Han-eo).  The closest equivalent in Chinese are the traditional characters (fántǐzi 繁體字) as used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and communities that culturally lean towards these three states. But it's not always identical. For example, take the syllable 위 wi. The hanja I want to highlight is 爲. In Taiwan, this is the proper hanzi. But most people casually write (and type) 為. (I prefer it myself.) But that is not what you would see in hanja. Taiwan has other variations; you can read about them here.  I'm not as familiar with Hong Kong's standard guidelines towards proper character depiction. But Hong Kong also has its own Cantonese-only characters to suit local words. You can find some of them across the ""border"" in Guangdong. For example, there's 𨋢 (lip1) which means elevator/lift -- a borrowing from UK English ""lift"". You won't find that in Mandarin and you definitely won't find it in a list of Korean hanja.  For more information I recommend:   Written Cantonese and how it differs from Mandarin in characters Hokkien (a Chinese language) and its issues with the vernacular being written with Chinese characters A hanja dictionary for Korean Kimchi and how Korea wants it written in Chinese   I can't answer the differing semantics. But there are probably many -- Korean hanja is basically the Kangxi dictionary but hanja themselves came much earlier, and the Sino-Korean words have had a very long time to drift in semantic value from when Classical Chinese was the literary language. And so too has Mandarin from Classical Chinese."

In English, when I am writing down a date, someone's address, expressing dollar amounts, phone numbers, or huge numbers, I almost NEVER will write them out.   For example:  It'd be very strange to see someone write: I live at twelve Maine St. Or, the date is set for fourteen June. You always always use the the number to express this. So, 12 Maine St, or 14 June.   It's very common to see someone say we have seven apples. Or, he's ""forty-seven years-old.""  And that's how sino-Korean vs other korean numbers work too.   The sino-korean (il, i, sam, sa, etc) numbers are used to express dates, money, addresses, phone numbers, and large numbers (usually over 100).   Other korean numbers (hana, tool, set,net, etc) are used to description number of ""things/items"" (1-99) and age.   We do this somewhat-naturally in English with use of written-out numbers versus using numerics, in Korean, there are just two elaborate ways to express it.

There isn't a whole lot of English writing in Korea (depends on the area) and you're going to struggle to get by if you can't at least read it. You can hold off on writing, it's not AS important, but should still be attempted. As for speaking and listening that is the harder part and takes practice by having conversations. When I was there, most Korean people were very understanding if I messed up when I was talking and were very helpful in communication. If I messed up, they could still understand what I meant and nothing went wrong. Learning basic grammar and vocabulary is where you should start.

However, when you arrive -- which is also after your current studying that leaves you no time for Hangeul --, it will be important to start learning. You will be surrounded by signs written in Hangeul, with or without romanization, and written information that you may need to consult soon after arriving, or mail that you need to answer. That will be very daunting. But, given that you'll have more time, you can always learn Hangeul by seeing a sign somewhere and asking someone to read it for you (with your presumably good enough spoken Korean, explaining that you can't read yet but are learning), or see the romanization and compare it with the Hangeul on a dual-language sign."

My point is that you have no excuses, there are people ten times more busy than you (not inc. me) and they can sort their time out. What makes you think /you/ can't?  EDIT: spelling"

Korean,393s1f,Shudai,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:21:18 2015 UTC,"Take this from someone with a degree in Chinese, learning to read and write Korean is nothing like learning to read or write Chinese or Japanese. Korean has got to be one of the easiest East Asian languages out there to read. I don't even speak Korean (yet), but if you show me a word, I can tell you how it's pronounced after only like 3 days of study.   Now, if you were wanting to learn Chinese without reading or writing, I'd still advise against it but it's more understandable to not want to put the time in. Chinese characters aren't phonetic, so the best you can do is take a guess at pronunciation based on the components. With Korean though, once you've spent a couple days learning the alphabet, the world becomes your oyster. You can recognize grammar patterns on signs and advertisements, you can ask your native buddy what a word means without having to point our where you saw it, and best of all, you have intelligible Korean staring you in the face all day. That's way better than what happens to some people when they come to China and are surrounded by learning material but can't utilize it because they haven't memorized the characters.   In short, it will take you all of a week. Just do it."

Korean,391vfo,Not_Ayn_Rand,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:16:22 2015 UTC,"정말 고마워요! Would you say that's just because it's kind of a set expression, like how in English one would say collect the garbage but not gather the garbage even though ""gather the garbage"" does make perfect sense? Or is it because of a nuance difference between the two verbs - like that one wouldn't 수집하다 garbage because it's just going to be disposed of/burned (or in Korea's case, recycled) and garbage doesn't actually need to be sought out, only collected?"
Korean,391vfo,Not_Ayn_Rand,3,Mon Jun 8 19:27:28 2015 UTC,I think 수집 means the things have some value to you. So it would be weird if you do 쓰레기 수집.

It's an easy rule too, just remove the ㅅ and then whatever you gotta do next gets it's own syllable. So 낫다 becomes ""나아요"" / ""나으면"", etc.  If you're not sure how to manipulate a verb, Naver Dictionary (my one true love) actually has basic conjugation examples on the page for that verb. Take 긋다 for example. Right under ""긋1"" you'll see ""활용"", and ""그어"", ""그으니"", and ""긋는 [근:는]"", (the brackets are pronunciation).

Korean,388rfv,gravevac,4,Wed Jun 3 02:24:05 2015 UTC,"That might be the joke, I think. According to here, the mean height for age 20-49 males is 172.1cm, the 95th percentile is 181.4, and the 99th percentile is 185.7cm.  If I narrow the sample to age 20-30 (more in line with today's celebrities) then the average is 173.5cm, 95th percentile is 182.9cm, 99th percentile is 186.4cm. 180cm is the 88th percentile.  By comparison, 167cm for women in the same age range (20-30) is approximately the 89th percentile. So assuming the stereotypes have some form of statistical consistency, then 180cm is a sensibly unreasonable expectation for male height based on the female celebrity height requirement.  edit: conclusion changed because of a calculator error :("

Korean,388h3x,Nebuleon,3,Tue Jun 2 16:36:29 2015 UTC,"Computer fonts often stretch Hangul letters (jamo) every which way when composing syllables, so that the syllables are all square. For certain syllables, that makes a big mess.  Consider these syllables:  a) 니 다 샤 태 서 에  b) 노 도 우 누 그 주  c) 면 한 않 먹 집 녕  d) 습 좋 공 온 믄 를  As I go along, the consonants get compressed vertically more and more, until the possibly most ugly-looking one, because it gets reduced into a stack of 7 large lines in most fonts: 를. To me, that is very difficult to focus on.  Because I don't know what features of Hangeul trouble you the most, I can't exactly make a recommendation, but to avoid the compressed shapes, I'd first suggest trying a handwriting-style font. There are some here: http://www.freekoreanfont.com/category/handwriting/  If you want, I can message you some large chunks of autogenerated Hangeul text* using the 4 kinds of syllables above so you can get to know what causes you headaches, and test out other fonts with it.    *: Yes, I know, Hangeul isn't a language, but I was more comparing it to Latin text like ""lorem ipsum""."

Korean,382p0f,ADSRelease,-23,Tue Jun 2 19:53:14 2015 UTC,it's the casual/friendly way of saying thanks
Korean,382p0f,tkdjdgrl,12,Mon Jun 1 16:40:54 2015 UTC,"I would not consider 고맙습니다 casual or friendly, considering it's a formal way of saying thank you. Casual/friendly, to me, would be more like 고마워."
Korean,382p0f,ADSRelease,-8,Mon Jun 1 17:33:19 2015 UTC,Both are less formal than 감사합니다 in my experience.
Korean,382p0f,tkdjdgrl,5,Tue Jun 2 00:55:35 2015 UTC,But 고맙습니다 still has the -ㅂ니다 ending. Just because it's less formal than a formal way of saying something does not make it casual.
Korean,382p0f,ADSRelease,-6,Tue Jun 2 02:00:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I'm saying 고맙다 is always more casual/intimate than 감사하다"
Korean,382p0f,tkdjdgrl,5,Tue Jun 2 02:01:15 2015 UTC,"Okay, but your original post implied that 고맙습니다 was simply casual and friendly, which it is not, and that is the overall point."
Korean,382p0f,Pikmeir,-10,Tue Jun 2 02:22:23 2015 UTC,"-습니다 is an obligation. While in the ""formal"" conjugation ""고맙다"" is the most casual/intimate way you can say it."
Korean,382p0f,ADSRelease,8,Tue Jun 2 02:29:16 2015 UTC,You are getting completely off track here. I don't understand why it's so hard for you to admit you were wrong and be done with it.
Korean,382p0f,Pikmeir,6,Tue Jun 2 03:03:12 2015 UTC,"This is true if it were in the form of 고맙다, but in this case it was already conjugated as 고맙습니다."
Korean,382p0f,tules,-7,Tue Jun 2 02:40:01 2015 UTC,"It's all relative. Sure, if you say 고맙습니다 to a friend, you're being formal, but if you say it to someone you would otherwise say 감사합니다 to you're being informal. I think you're taking ""formal tense"" too seriously."
Korean,382p0f,ADSRelease,9,Tue Jun 2 02:44:03 2015 UTC,"No, what you're saying is incorrect. 고맙습니다 isn't informal, it's simply less formal than 감사합니다, but being less formal than something else does not make it informal."
Korean,382p0f,tules,6,Tue Jun 2 02:46:46 2015 UTC,Dude stop. No offence but it's clear you don't know what you're talking about
Korean,382p0f,ADSRelease,-3,Tue Jun 2 08:03:21 2015 UTC,how? I'm saying that there are two main ways of saying thanks and one is more friendly regardless of honorific form
Korean,382p0f,catcatcat1122,9,Tue Jun 2 08:14:20 2015 UTC,No. It's formal

Korean,382p0f,Pikmeir,5,Tue Jun 2 08:03:57 2015 UTC,"I am an actual Korean native. This is 100% formal, what everyone else is saying to you is right."
Korean,382p0f,ADSRelease,-6,Tue Jun 2 11:04:37 2015 UTC,"I'm in Korea. I'm not saying that conjugation is formal, I'm saying it is the less formal option."
Korean,382p0f,ADSRelease,5,Tue Jun 2 12:45:32 2015 UTC,"OP's question:   Please help me as I need translating something.   The text from the image:   고맙습니다   Your original comment:   it's the casual/friendly way of saying thanks   Your comment above:   I'm saying it is the less formal option.   No, you said that it's casual/friendly. You didn't say it was the less formal option in your original comment. It doesn't say the word ""less formal"" anywhere in there. Nobody in here believes what you're saying because they can read your actual comment and see that it's already incorrect."
Korean,382p0f,theghostofm,-3,Tue Jun 2 12:57:48 2015 UTC,"yeah, if you're in the formal tense, it's the casual/friendly way of saying thanks, compared to 감사합니다"
Korean,382p0f,theghostofm,6,Tue Jun 2 13:13:54 2015 UTC,"Not only is that not what you said in your comment (which is why all of the downvotes and replies), but that's also incorrect. I'm not sure if you're trolling or if you enjoy being told you've made a mistake or if you're just incapable of recognizing a mistake, but you're in the wrong sub right now for any of those things. You're not being very respectful of everyone else who's trying to help you and are ignoring their replies and attempts to teach you, and your comments that add nothing new to the discussion aren't helpful at all. This is not what this subreddit is for and I'd ask that you stop, even if you still don't feel that you've made a mistake. This is a warning."
Korean,382p0f,ADSRelease,-2,Tue Jun 2 13:16:33 2015 UTC,What am I doing wrong? People don't say every bit of detail when they speak. So you can see from my expanded explanation the threads of thought that were simplified for my basic translation. I've explained how it is framed in my mind to which some people even slightly agreed. Since the first person disagreed I've checked my answer by multiple native Koreans and they've all agreed what I said made sense. What I said is verbatim how it was explained to me by native Koreans. I have implied and openly said I agree to disagree multiple times. I'm not trolling I just get replies and I'm open to dialogue.
Korean,382p0f,kpajamas,5,Tue Jun 2 13:27:08 2015 UTC,"People have commented more than enough about what you're doing wrong already so I won't add to that. You can re-read the comments in this thread but do not make any more comments in this thread. I'm giving you a warning now that if you continue arguing in this way (if you post one more single comment in this thread) you will be banned from this sub. If you disagree with banning people for something like this, then I'm sorry you feel that way, but /r/Korean is for the discussion of Korean and if you're not here to accept corrections from others, admit when you're wrong, learn the language, and only want to argue with people over semantics, then you're in the wrong subreddit. Normally when someone is told they're wrong by everyone in the thread, they re-read what they wrote and re-read what others wrote and simply move on, but you're continuing to comment the same things over and over, and aren't even trying to understand what everyone else's comments are saying.  Read the sub's rules (they're on the sidebar). Specifically read the first rule.  When someone says you're wrong, you're free to argue with that and focus on the topic (the Korean language). You're free to go back and forth as long as you're providing something to the conversation, such as evidence, or additional information, that gives some sort of a reason for the argument. But what you are doing is ignoring the evidence others are providing, and simply restating your comment, and even misquoting yourself and claiming to have said something you didn't even say. This is not how this sub works and this is not helpful or respectful of others who are putting their time into assisting others to actually learn the language. It is also confusing for beginners to see this.  Anyway, so this is your warning and you can accept it and participate another day or you can leave."
Korean,382p0f,ADSRelease,5,Tue Jun 2 13:39:31 2015 UTC,There is nothing about 고맙습니다 that is informal. 고맙다 is not an informal word at all; it is only incidentally a word that is commonly used in informal speech.
Korean,382p0f,theghostofm,10,Tue Jun 2 10:59:03 2015 UTC,"Nope, this is not the casual way - this is a formal way of saying ""Thank you"""

Korean,38138v,YouFeedTheFish,2,Thu Jun 4 02:24:43 2015 UTC,"It is a kind of idiomatic thing. It is OK to say 애플 워치를 드러냈다; there is no grammatical error about it, but it is rarely used like that.  Many Koreans add 모습(figure) when some product is first revealed."
Korean,38138v,YouFeedTheFish,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:06:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  These tips are really helpful.  A native speaker once told me that my Korean was ""awkward"".  I think that this is probably an example.."

Korean,380aam,ipullguard,5,Sun May 31 22:11:09 2015 UTC,"Both of them, the adverb ""병원에"" or the direct object ""병원을"", are correct. You can find the definition of this usage in Korean dictionary.   5 . ‘가다1’, ‘오다1’, ‘떠나다’ 따위의 동사들과 어울려 일정한 목적을 가지고 이동하고자 하는 곳을 나타내는 격 조사. ‘에4’보다 강조하는 뜻이 있다.   So in this case ""을"" is used to give emphasis on the locative case ""병원에"" or to show that you have certain reasons for it. For example, ""학교를 갔다"" implies that you are a student.

Korean,380aam,Eunseong,1 point,Sun May 31 22:26:01 2015 UTC,"Small tip, krdic.naver.com should be a resource in the arsenal of every Korean learner. If you go there then search for 가다 you'll find   가다1 play Record Pronunciation  동사 「…에/에게,…으로,…을」   That last bit confirms that it can go with 을 as well"
Korean,380aam,beorilgeoya,0,Mon Jun 1 10:12:04 2015 UTC,"Transitive= action so in either case of 을/를  or 에   it would be considered an action.  And with 을/를  in that situation, from what I've garnered for that use is it's a technically incorrect use (slang is awful) and makes where the subject is going be more important in the situation. So 가다 isn't literally taking an object, but in a highly contextual language like Korean when speaking you can tweak the rules a bit to get across what you need to.

Korean,380aam,maddragon710,3,Mon Jun 1 02:48:24 2015 UTC,"Well, it doesn't look to me like the usage is slang or technically incorrect. Here's another source that mentions it -- see point 6 all the way at the bottom of this page:  http://www.language.berkeley.edu/korean/10/lesson01/index.htm  It says ""b. Some verbs seem to be intransitive but require the direct object marker 을/를 in Korean: 가다 ""to go,"" 걷다 ""to walk,"" 날다 ""to fly,"" 다니다 ""to attend."""" but unfortunately doesn't give much other explanation."

Korean,37w5ii,KimchiTooSpicy,7,Sat May 30 22:12:48 2015 UTC,"I looked up these two words through Naver, which you should also do in circumstances like these^^.  창업하다  - (1) 나라나 왕조 따위를 처음으로 세우다, (2) 사업 따위를 처음으로 이루어 시작하다  to found, establish (as in countries, dynasties, and also businesses)  개업하다 - 영업이 처음 시작되다. 또는 영업을 처음 시작하다  to open up, set up, start up (a business)   I think the confusion here might be in how both words can relate to business. But 사업 in 창업하다's definition isn't the same as 영업 in 개업하다's.   사업 is, in general, a business/company/organization (that has goals and does management, etc...) whereas 영업 is a profit-driven 사업 or the actual act of obtaining profit.   (I also got these from Naver)   EDIT: spelling"
Korean,37w5ii,Wzzch,2,Sat May 30 23:26:37 2015 UTC,"It's used mostly indistinguishably, but 창업하다 has meaning more of starting and ""inventing"" a new type of business, whereas 개업하다 is used more for opening restaurant/store etc that deals directly with customers for sales. I hope this helped."

Korean,37uobj,theghostofm,4,Sat May 30 15:35:37 2015 UTC,"Translation is one of the most difficult things to do in language learning; it requires use of faculties that you do not generally engage in daily life, balancing preservation of meaning with normal expression in another language (which is very often impossible), and a strong command of both languages in order to be done properly.

Korean,37miwl,Wzzch,5,Fri May 29 13:14:50 2015 UTC,"The thing is 는데 has multiple grammatical functions, one of which is simply contrast. 지만 is said to be stronger because its main function IS contrast and emphasizing opposition. Two ideas like raining (the example says snowing but that's weird) and not using an umbrella are strongly contrasting thoughts. So 지만 would be appropriate.  This, however, is not so in 는데. 는데 is more flexible as it functions as a simple contrast. Not to mention it has another important function which is providing background information.  So really, the two grammar points have different focuses on their usages. Hope this helps!"

It is sometimes easy to translate it as a 'but' depending on the clause that comes after it.  어제 그 여자를 만났는데, 정말 예뻐요.   I met her yesterday, she's really beautiful."
Korean,37miwl,MistaMun,-1,Fri May 29 02:10:14 2015 UTC,"지만 is more or less can be translated to ""but"" in English. It also has contradicting, comparison, and in other words..., connotation.

Korean,37j4sz,sainthkh,2,Thu May 28 00:27:16 2015 UTC,So how is 싶다 different than 생각하다?  I'm still confused.
Korean,37j4sz,tkdjdgrl,2,Thu May 28 02:41:44 2015 UTC,"First of all, 싶다 is used to tell your wishes in the form of ~고 싶다. it is like want in English. It is like the difference between think and want.   나는 수박이 먹고 싶다. I want to eat watermelon.  생각하다 is not used for what you want.   Secondly, 싶다 is used for your guesses, worries or fears.   이렇게 하다간 혼 나겠다 싶어 집으로 돌아왔다. I thought that I will be scolded if I work like this, so I came back home.   In this case, you can change 싶어 with  생각이 들어 like below:  이렇게 하다간 혼 나겠다는 생각이 들어 집으로 돌아 왔다. (you cannot delete 는 after 나겠다)  In examples above, you can change 싶다 with 생각이 들어 like following:   상상도 못했던 선물을 받았다. 꿈인가 생각이 들었다. 비가 오는가 생각이 들어 빨래를 걷었다. 집에 있겠다 생각이 들어 전화했어. 이번이 마지막 기회다 생각이 들었는지 아주 열심히 한다.   Finally, you can use 싶다 with hard-to-be-realized wishes. It is a bit similar to the first example. It is used in the form of ~으면 싶다.   일이 좀 적었으면 싶다. I wish I had less works.   In this case, 생각하다 is not used.  To sum up, 싶다 and 생각이 들다 are interchangeable if you are telling your guesses. However, if you tell what you want, then they are not interchangeable."

Korean,37finj,shortcutkorean,8,Wed May 27 06:38:15 2015 UTC,Why not just use an already existing Anki deck? There are a bunch with pretty much the content you describe. Not sure you're going to be able to get many people to pay for this.
Korean,37finj,feedmefeces,1 point,Wed May 27 15:12:05 2015 UTC,"Great question.  Anki is an excellent application, there's no denying that, but it can be difficult to use and time consuming to setup.  Also, Anki does not develop content, it relies on the community to do so, which can be hit or miss. The decks you refer to are not of a high quality and lack images, as well as audio for example sentences.   With shortcutkorean.com we've tried to simplify the experience by developing all the content ourselves. We've recorded, all audio, including 2 example sentences, slow-motion and images. Eventually we will have the 5000 most common Korean Words uploaded. In addition, we use multiple choice questions during the beginning stages of learning the word. This helps users to learn the word before using our SRS. Also, since our app is online based, you will never experience annoying sync issues.   With that being said, the site is definitely not for everyone, advanced users may prefer the customization of Anki, but for users whose goal is to simply learn the core Korean vocabulary as quickly and pain-free as possible, we like to think it's a solid option."

The outdated design is not the problem : it's the editorial part that gives me chills in the back. From the unproven ""60% faster learning"" to the ""testimonials"" to the criticism of ""other free korean sites"" to the ""24/7 customer support""... everything smells bullshit.  I'm not saying you don't have a honest purpose here, just saying after checking your website as it is now, I would just leave with the feeling that this is yet another pay-site trying to repackage the topik list.  I like that you are trying to produce your own content, but then I need to know what makes you legitimate : did you work with korean natives to record phrases ? Is a korean teacher helping as a consultant ? You clients need to know those things to trust the quality of your content."

The thing is, in business, we go buy what converts. In your case, you would leave the site, never to return. However, the conversion rate for long sales letters is actually proven to be quite high. Unfortunately, that's why you'll quite often see a variation of these style of pages because of the high conversion rates. Personally, I don't like them myself. With that being said, I do agree it does cheapen the site quite a bit, and we might be better served without it.   In regard to the content, all of it has been produced by Korean natives who speak English fluently.

Harry Potter, Ender's Game, The Hunger Games, for example.  Aside from that, I typically walk around used bookstores and flip through the selection.  See what's on/near my level while keeping an eye out for things where I like the subject, but maybe can't read comfortably yet.  I just put those on my bookshelf at home and wait for my skills to ripen : )  It'll be a while before a new learner is ready to tackle native stories, so I think translations are a good way to build vocabulary in the mean time."
Korean,37finj,regaber,4,Thu May 28 03:07:16 2015 UTC,"A bit off topic, but as a native Korean I find it amusing that some people would use the Korean version of Harry Potter as a study tool because they're familiar with it,  when I used the original Harry Potter as a study tool learning English because I was familiar with the Korean version of Harry Potter.

Korean,37finj,secondaccountforme,2,Wed May 27 22:43:17 2015 UTC,"I tested it out a bit just to give some feedback on the interface. During the practice section when you are just learning a word, even if I type the word correctly, it doesn't move me on to the next thing. It should move me on after I press enter if it's correct, like it does later on.  Also, there should be a clear keyboard shortcut to move on for every single section. Maybe there is already keyboard shortcuts for that but I couldn't find them. It unnecessarily slows me down to have to go back and forth between keyboard and mouse. I should be able to press 1-4 for multiple choice answers, enter to move to next, etc.  edit: I tried one of the conversation ones. During the end when it is asking you to translate, I shouldn't have to wait for the timer to count down. There should just be a button so I can check. The timer was too long. Pressing skip didn't show me the correct answer either. This may not have been a problem if I wasn't doing the really easy lessons but I just feel like the user should have more control.  edit2: I was just testing it again and came across a problem. It doesn't let me type spaces, I have to manually press the space on the mini keyboard if I need to type a space."

I certainly agree with many of your suggestions and will look at getting some of them implemented, particularly the keyboard shortcuts and space bar issue.

Korean,37foup,lazyheroine,1 point,Fri May 29 11:40:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're correct. The original explanation isn't really sufficient in terms of actually using the words, because 얼마나 많이 and 몇 aren't really directly interchangeable in the question. It's incorrect to say ""우유 얼마나 잔 마실래?""  But at least in conversational Korean, 얼마나 can be answered with both discrete and non-discrete answers (I forgot if non-discrete is a word... I don't think the mathematical term continuous is really the point. Non-count-able maybe? I dunno, reply if you don't know what I mean haha). Ex: 우유 얼마나 마실래? the answer can be 3잔 (a discrete amount) or 많이 (non-discrete).  In contrast 우유 몇 잔 마실래? 3잔, 여러 잔, etc is fine as an answer. But if you say 많이, you'll be understood but you're not really answering the question and it would be... weird. It has to be a number answer.  tagging /u/gigajesus cuz this thread is old"

Korean,37ahcr,Choonsam,6,Tue May 26 04:35:33 2015 UTC,"잘 있어?   That's the only other one I can really think of but I think there's a reason for that. English is a very creative language - everyone tries to have their own way of saying something - individual-minded. But Korean is group focused and as a result they usually do what ""everyone else"" does. So although to us this may feel like being cliche or what have you, it is actually the best way. Instead you can try altering the way you say those things, but that is really dependent on the relationship so be careful with them:   밥 먹었니? sort of a cute way, usually when you're talking to someone younger or really close (gf/ bf) 잘 있니?   You can ask them about something specific if you remember whats going on in their life (this is really imptorant. they seem to remember EVERYTHING I tell them about my life, much more than my western friends do).  학교는 어때?  시험 봤지? 합격?  여친이랑 잘 만나고 있어?  바빠?"

If it's a job that requires Korean, then you will need to be functionally fluent in the language in order for it to matter. It's not good to make a perfectly written application letter, but then it turns out you're not so during the interview. If they found out someone else wrote it for you that would look like you lied about something on your resume.

Korean,377w2o,gabrieloc,9,Mon May 25 16:34:59 2015 UTC,"I've got a few questions I think people might be interested in knowing the answers to. Since it is a language exchange app, are the native Korean speakers people who want to practice English? Or are they instructors/people willing to help people with their Korean without getting English practice themselves? If they want to practice their English, what is the general procedure to make sure both sides get practice? A lot of language exchanges end up being one sided where only one person is really benefiting."
Korean,377w2o,iamkoalafied,3,Mon May 25 17:03:41 2015 UTC,"A lot of language exchanges end up being one sided where only one person is really benefiting.   This is very true and one of my biggest frustrations learning Korean. My speaking ability is making very little progress because every Korean I befriend wants to practice English. And because their English speaking in generally better than my Korean speaking, they usually win out."
Korean,377w2o,anothernewname123,1 point,Tue May 26 01:16:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the responses! Lots of questions, so let me respond one by one:   are the native Korean speakers people who want to practice English?    As it is now, the app chooses wether you're a Korean speaker or an English speaker based off the device's system locale.    Or are they instructors/people willing to help people with their Korean without getting English practice themselves?   An idea I'd like to explore post-launch will be how professional instructors and tutors could use the app for paying students.    A lot of language exchanges end up being one sided where only one person is really benefiting.   This is actually a huge issue which I identified early on! One of the first concepts I begun exploring when starting out was having a ""persona"" in the app moderate conversations, kind of like a referee. So for example, he'd say something like ""Ok, speak Korean now!"" at certain intervals, or if the summed duration of recorded messages hit a certain value, he'd go like ""you guys have been speaking Korean for 10 minutes now, let's switch to English!.  If you take a look at the screenshots, you can kind of see bits of this ""referee"" concept (""Sej""), albeit with much less presence than what I just described. This is because after prototyping and collecting early feedback, the overwhelming response was that Sej was way too annoying, plus — there isn't really much stopping people from just speaking in whatever language they'd like.  All that being said, I foresee this project evolving and iterating quite a bit over time, as I learn more about how language exchange could best work. That's why I'd like to launch my Minimum Viable Product as a super-basic voice-only messaging service, and continue to explore ways to improve the process as time goes by, using feedback from folks like you!  Hope that helps."

For me it has been the complete opposite from day one, I'm the one whose getting all the benefit and I've been using Hellotalk for a loooong time - although admittey I'm at a point where there's little left to be gained from more additional casual conversation practice. Youre just letting them win or something. They almost always stop typing English to me after the first 5 sentences I type in Korean. I'm sorry to be harsh but my sample size is large enough and it's consistent enough that I can confidently say this..  Sadly I don't have any tips apart from ""don't use English with them at all""."

Korean,376tjd,Choonsam,6,Mon May 25 10:20:16 2015 UTC,"the main difference is that -던 is ""used to"" and 았/었던 is a more solidified/specified past tense.  우리가 가던 곳 The place we used to go to (multiple times)  우리가 갔던 곳 The place we went to (that time)  우리가 갔었던 곳 The place we went to (back then, during that time, that day, etc)  았던/았었던 have virtually no difference in meaning but its more of a feeling. 던 is used only for ""used to"" phrases."
Korean,376tjd,rosedilly,2,Mon May 25 14:39:56 2015 UTC,"The difference Ive learnt is that 던 is more commonly used when describing something that happened repeatedly over a period of time, rather than a one time past occurrence or event.  For example:  내가 입던 옷 (the clothes I used to wear repeatedly over a time period)  내가 입었던 옷 (the clothes I wore on a specific day or event, could be used for the meaning above too though I think)"
Korean,3758pu,cellojake,10,Mon May 25 00:07:49 2015 UTC,"I think that's something that all language learners have to get over eventually. What works for some people won't work for others, but what works best for me is removing English from the equation entirely. Watching a show or movie? Try it with no subs (or if you can't understand without subs, watch once with subs and then again without so you know what will happen and can catch some words). Found a word that you don't know? Look it up in the Naver Korean dictionary instead of the KOR- ENG dictionary. If you're practicing reading or writing, don't get hung up on each word and grammar point- read or write as quickly as you can, trying not to give your brain time to translate, and then go over the passage or writing again to break it down if you couldn't understand with your fast read, or if you couldn't express what you wanted when writing quickly. If you make conscious efforts to push your native language out as much as you can, you'll gradually become more and more comfortable handling Korean (and any other language you want) IN that language."
Korean,3758pu,ScribbleBees,2,Mon May 25 00:15:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the thorough response, it makes a lot of sense. I guess for me its really hard to see it being possible to remove English (I mean I have been learning and using Spanish for at least half a decade and have been learning Korean for a bit), sort of how some people find it hard to see a physics concept. I think I will try out your advice and work towards making that idea ""click""."

Practice thinking about topics using Korean. Change your user settings (Facebook, Reddit, Gmail, etc.) to Korean.  Everyone deals with this, and it just takes time.  My second language is German. Many of my websites are set that way, and always have been. I sub to German language subs on reddit, too. Often when I'm reading German, I don't even realize it's not English, I'm just reading and understanding. I'm slowly making this transition for Korean, too. It's tough. But you're not alone in it."

Korean,3758pu,lswank,6,Mon May 25 01:15:28 2015 UTC,"Hello!  My native language is French, and English is a second language. I'll draw parallels between those two first.  When I didn't know the English grammar well enough, I had lots of trouble following a sentence with a different word order. I did indeed have to retranslate the sentence to French, then formulate my reply in French, then translate it to English. But as I learned more words and listened to people form sentences, I gradually made a vocabulary, both of words and of sentences, that I could think about directly in English.  Nowadays, I can think of pretty much anything I want in English. And if you tell me something and I recall it later, I won't remember what language you said it in. I can just as easily tell you what you said in French or in English.  What helps me the most is finding things that I make instant connections with as concepts. The concept of saying something to someone when I meet them, I can think of directly in Korean: 안녕하세요. The concept of saying something when it's time to go to sleep: 잘 자. The concept of not knowing the time: 몇시예요? If I follow those concepts, I also won't remember which language I used, so I may greet a Korean person and later think I spoke with them in English.  What also helps is doing mundane things like arithmetic in Korean. Five + four? Nine. 오 + 사? 구. edit: Also try telling the time to yourself in Korean when you look at a clock. Clock's at 5? 다섯시. When you look at the calendar, try recalling the day of the week and the name of the month. Look it up if you forgot. Make sure you know the name of the current month in English, Spanish and Korean. Etc.  Once you can think of a concept like a number in Korean, you'll start to ""get it""."

Korean,3758pu,vj_jovina,3,Tue May 26 05:55:35 2015 UTC,"Before you start learning, you don't know that you don't know. You are ""unconsciously incompetent."" After a while, you learn that you don't know many things. You are ""consciously incompetent"". Then you migrate into having to think while speaking. This is being ""consciously competent"".  Eventually it comes, and it doesn't come all at once for every topic. You learn concepts unique to that culture, and suddenly you have no way to express those topics outside of that language. From that, you move into ""unconscious competence"". That's the phase where you have fun experiences. You know you are there when you have a conversation with someone and later can't remember what language it was in!  The timing is different for each subject in each language that you speak, and it doesn't come all at once by any means. Just keep it up!  (This is a massive oversimplification, but hopefully it helps a little bit.)"
Korean,3758pu,ShinshinRenma,2,Mon May 25 07:38:29 2015 UTC,"I used to do that a lot too and I'm also learning spanish right now. I bet there are things in both langauges that actually come out naturally without you knowing. The words that are ""already floating on the surface of the water"" are the ones that come out easy. 네. 알았아요. 그래요. Si. no se. pero...   So if that is in fact the case, then why might that be? Number of uses. Those things have been used more, and so they fly out.   Try shadowing - listen to something and try to copy what they say (as much as you can and as fast as you can, but it DOES NOT matter if you miss stuff). This will strengthen the connection between your ear and mouth and it won't give your brain time to get in there and try to shove a rule in or do a translation. But even though I am totally fluent in Korean now, sometimes there are words that aren't so strong and the English word comes up first, then I have to struggle a bit to translate it. It's normal. Don't worry. Seeing it as a problem is in fact the problem. Sometimes the answer to our question is actually behind the question - the answer is to not ask the question.   Best of luck friend. creo que te poderlo!"
Korean,3758pu,ShinshinRenma,2,Tue May 26 05:52:38 2015 UTC,"Start talking to yourself in the language you're learning. Whenever you see something, think of what it is in that other language, but don't translate it to your language. Just understand it as what it is. Don't even think of what it is in English. When you're talking to yourself, do it in the language you're learning too. Even if you only know a few words and don't know how to structure it properly as a sentence. It might feel awkward at first when you barely know anything, but it's okay. Think of how babies first learn a language. They don't immediately know how to make sentences, and despite that, they still try to convey their message with the few words they know. You should do this along with other people's suggestions on movie subtitles, and using the language you're learning as the default language in everything. And read, A LOT. Whatever it is. If you don't like reading books, read anything on the web, such as news, blogs, etc."

What is it you don't understand? The second one in each case is the passive form (actually more like active if you think about it, but it's the same grammar structure which could be confusing)  Anyway here's a lesson on all the various conjugations for passive verbs."

Korean,372v5u,eotteoge,3,Sun May 24 10:15:44 2015 UTC,"To be honest, speaking is best worked on outside the classroom, in a 1-1 setting with a Korean native speaker. Even in Sogang (which people rave about), class sizes are typically 10-15, which means that at most you are going to get a few minutes of direct conversation with your teacher every hour. The overwhelming majority of the conversation time in class will be conversation with classmates, which while not worthless, has limited value (in my opinion.)   Class time, I think, is primarily good for asking questions and improving listening skills - there aren't so many opportunities to listen to someone for a few hours speaking Korean at precisely your level, and to have them patiently listen to and answer your questions.  Find a private tutor, a good language exchange partner or a good meetup group if you really want to work on conversation. Once you get to a certain level, make friends who don't speak English and build a social life around them. Things like that are the only ways to really improve your speaking skills."
Korean,372v5u,feedmefeces,2,Sun May 24 19:21:45 2015 UTC,I'm currently enrolled at Sogang and I can say that its reputation is well deserved. The first 4 levels are basically all speaking and conversation.

I also personally recommend designating a notebook for Korean learning so you can practice grammar and vocab by hand."

You can say 오늘은 아침 일곱시에 일어났어요 and still be correct, but the meaning is a little different than how /u/Mocking_Jae corrected it. If you put the 은, it implies difference from norm. (So yesterday, I got up at 6. Today, I got up at 7.)  Also, quick note: it's good to get into a habit of using pronouns (저는, 나는, 너는, etc) less frequently.

Korean,36xyg9,Mocking_Jae,3,Sat May 23 05:03:45 2015 UTC,"I have trouble hearing and pronouncing ㅗ and ㅓsounds.     A good way to think of these is just the English 'O' (""oh"") sound being split on two.    오 ""Oh"" Is your more standard O sound. Like the alphabetic pronunciation of the letter O. Used in words like cope, hope, soap, tone, loan, topaz etc    어 ""o"" Is more like the sound o makes in most English words, when it's used on it's own. Like: cop, hop, Ron, copy, rot, cod, etc. Generally just a shorter and snappier O.    if you think about it, you could divide the sound the English O makes into a few more letters if you wanted (and I'm sure many languages have):    Awe/Oar: Thorn, born, chore, lord  Aow/Au: Town, round, crown, noun  Un: London, tonne, shovel    Hope this clears things up a little :)"
Korean,36xyg9,CourageNA,1 point,Sat May 23 21:14:53 2015 UTC,"커피 마셨어 is still a correct sentence. If you use 마시고, 고 works like a conjunction so the two sentences you initially wrote become one."
Korean,36xyg9,climb026,2,Sat May 23 03:46:45 2015 UTC,I see. So is it understood that if i used past tense in 먹었어 the earlier 마시고 will be assumed as past tense too?  Another one.  대학교에서 -> 대학교에 Why only 에 and not 에서? I was taught that if there is an action done in a place I should use 에서.
Korean,36xyg9,secondaccountforme,2,Sat May 23 05:15:35 2015 UTC,"I believe it's 에 whenever it's a movement that ends at the location, and because 도착하다 is to arrive or reach, you are arriving at university, therefor requiring 에. Similarly to 가다 or other movement verbs."
Korean,36xyg9,japrappp,2,Sat May 23 05:23:03 2015 UTC,"That's right, the past tense of 마시다 is expressed at the end of the sentence in 먹었어"
Korean,36xyg9,theghostofm,2,Sat May 23 08:24:02 2015 UTC,"도착하다 is a ""going"" verb, so it didn't really all happen at school.   Like if I say ""I just arrived at school"", it's not like you were at school, and then you decided to arrive. But if I say ""I slept at my friends house last night"" that does mean you were at your friends house and you decided to sleep."

I also have serious problem memorizing anything, not just vocabulary, I mix up words that sounds the same, or have similar meaning etc.  I've been a beginner learner of Korean for 4 years now.  The best advice I can give you is never give up (never surrender!). Yeah, others might be fluent in 4 years, but I instead of comparing myself with others I compare myself with myself 4 years ago. I have about a thousand word vocabulary now, which is pittiful really, but better than knowing no Korean words, right?   As for more specific things I did to help me learn Korean:   I gave up on writing with pen and learned to touch type Korean. I feel like this switched the burden to muscle memory which seems to be working better in my case. When using spaced repetition like Memrise I don't wait for the program to count the timer down, I practice the words over and over and over again. I need my memory refreshed much more often than healthy people I pay attention to similar looking Korean words that I tend to mix up a lot and I make charts and then practice them over and over again I bought specific textbooks for practicing listening skill and pronunciation and I can confidently say that I can with more than 90% accuracy tell apart ㅊ,ㅈ,ㅉ and ㅋ,ㄱ,ㄲ, etc. even when spoken in normal conversation. This has helped me with learning immensily I edit audio from videos (drama, movies, whatever you like), cut out sentences, loop them and listen on repeat until they stop sounding like a language and sound more like rhytham (I'm not sure I explained this well)"

Korean,36vkb6,No_Fun_Not_Ever,4,Fri May 22 19:32:42 2015 UTC,"First of all, 다음에 is nonspecific in terms of time, so it means ""next time"". To specify a certain time (or location/thing) of XX, you need to say 다음XX.    다음 10년 = next 10 years 다음주 = next week 다음 버스 = next bus    Then you can add 에 (or any participle) to the end of 다음XX.    다음주에 봐요. = See you next week. 다음 버스에 타세요 = Get on the next bus.     Does this particle not have the expression of ""in?     에 can mean ""in"" in other places but not here. If you use 에 in the context of time, it loses the ""in the"" part of the phrase. To say ""in the next XX units of time"", you should use -은/는 or even 동안 (for/during).   다음 10년 동안 제가 도울 거예요. = I will help you for the next 10 years. / During the next 10 years, I will help you.

Both also mean ""after"" but... -고 implies a sequential relationship in the order the verbs are written. -고 나서 explicitly refers to the sequential order.     There's also -고 난 + (다음/후/뒤)에. I guess it emphasizes the past action a bit more?    돈을 모은 다음에 뭐 할 거예요? = After saving money, what will you do? / What will you do after saving money? 돈을 모은 후에 뭐 할 거예요? 돈을 모은 뒤에 뭐 할 거예요? 돈을 모으고 뭐 할 거예요? 돈을 모으고 나서 뭐 할 거예요? 돈을 모으고 난 다음에 뭐 할 거예요?    아침을 먹은 다음에 이를 닦아요. = After eating breakfast, brush [your] teeth. / Brush [your] teeth after eating breakfast. 아침을 먹은 후에 이를 닦아요. 아침을 먹은 뒤에 이를 닦아요. 아침을 먹고 이를 닦아요. 아침을 먹고 나서 이를 닦아요. 아침을 먹고 난 뒤에 이를 닦아요.     And another FYI. The ""true"" meanings of 다음에, 후에, and 뒤에 are completely different. So 다음에 and 뒤에 won't always mean ""after"".     다음(에) = next, next time 후(에) = after 뒤(에) = back, behind"

Let's say you are reading through the book and find the word 참여하다 and want to memorize it. It's in a sentence as:  참여하였고  The program makes a flashcard for you for ""참여하였고"". You can't edit the flash card. You can't change how it is represented in the database. Then later you find the same word as   참여할 것이다  You get a new flashcard for ""참여할"".  In fact, you'll get a new flashcard and an entry in the database for each word form, and there's no way to tie them together. One of the main points of the program is to have a visual indicator of how many words you know. When you mark the seventh or eighth conjugation of a word you already know, it really wears on you after a while.  If you remove the spacing, there is more potential for ambiguity.  Unfortunately, the answer is to use natural language processing algorithms to do the splitting, but those algorithms are different for each language, and I'm not sure anyone wants to do a Korean-specific fork of the project."

I don't know enough to give you an educated answer on it, sorry. Hopefully you find what you're looking for."

Korean,36k5ft,Bow_for_the_king,4,Wed May 20 18:05:32 2015 UTC,Wow. This should be in the sidebar or something.
Korean,36k5ft,blumpkin,12,Wed May 20 12:33:38 2015 UTC,At the beginning of the word it is pronounced ㅡ + ㅣ. With time you will learn to say it with more flow so it becomes more like one sound.  In the middle of the word in careful speech it can also be pronounced as ㅡ + ㅣ but actually most Koreans just say ㅣ.  At the end of the word it is pronounced as ㅔ ONLY if 의 is possesive ending. So you do have to know Korean vocabulary to be sure how to pronounce it.

Also, as someone has already mentioned, people say 제 and 내 not 저의 or 나의. The ㅔ in 제 is a combination of the ㅓin 저 and the ㅣin the 의. 어+이=에. Same for the ㅐ in 내. The ㅐis ㅏ in 나 plus the ㅣ in 의.

If she's your girlfriend, you could call her 자기야 like others suggested. However, if you've only started dating recently, stick to just her name.    If she's just your friend, don't call her anything like 자기야, 여보, 애기, etc.  That would be weird and would more than likely make her feel awkward. Just like with any friend, you develop nicknames over time, so it's best to get better at the language to make a real nickname rather than use the wrong one.  One thing you could do is think about what animal she looks like and learn the Korean word and use that.  Not suggested for 돼지, 코끼리, or other unattractive animals."

Also, I'm not 100% sure on this because all my 큰/작은아버지 were married before I was born, if your dad's (male) siblings are not married I think they're 삼촌. It might be good to note this somewhere.  You should consider making an in-law version of this (for me, lol!). I'm going completely crazy trying to remember the words, hahaha.... ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠ"
Korean,36icbk,lazyheroine,5,Tue May 19 16:51:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, generally unmarried uncles are called 삼촌, and once they're married, it's more polite to call them 큰아버지/백부 or 작은아버지/숙부, but depending on how close you are and the family atmosphere, you might still call them 삼촌.  Also, 삼촌(三寸) refers to the distance between you and your uncle. Married couples are 0 촌, parent-child relations are 1 촌, so siblings are 2촌 (1촌 up to parent 1촌 down to sibling), thus uncles/aunts are 3촌, first cousins are 4촌, 5촌 uncles (parent's first cousins) are called 당숙, and their children are 6촌, etc.   Generally for in-laws, if you're their daughter-in-law, you add '시' in front of most things. If you're their son-in-law, you add '처' in front of most things."

I figure I should learn it though, hahaha. I forgot I don't know all these words!)  I actually meant the chart for specific people that have completely different 호칭/지칭 like:  남편의 여동생 = 아가씨 남편의 여동생의 부인 = (? I forgot this one, I should look it up again) 오빠의 부인 = 새언니 (regardless of age difference) etc, etc."
Korean,36icbk,lazyheroine,6,Tue May 19 18:29:41 2015 UTC,"For your husband's sisters, you address them as 아가씨, but they are your 시누이. You can address your older brother's wife 새언니 or 올케 (올케언니), and your younger brother's wife is just 올케 if you're a girl. If you're a guy, you'd call your older brother's wife 형수(님) and your younger brother's wife 제수(씨). If your husband has married brothers, their wives are 동서 to you. (If your wife has married sisters, their husbands are also 동서 to you.) If their spouse is older than your spouse, you call them 형님, if their spouse is younger than your spouse, you call them 동서. Your wife's older sister is 처형, younger sister is 처제, brother is 처남. Your older sister's husband is 형부 if you're a girl and 매형/자형 if you're a guy. Your younger sister's husband is 제부 if you're a girl and 매부/매제 if you're a guy. Your wife's brother is 처남 regardless of age (and his wife would be 처남댁), but if he is older than your wife, you should call him 형님. Your husband's older brother is 아주버님 regardless of marriage. Your husband's younger brother is 도련님 if unmarried and 서방님 if married.  Edit: Oh and yes for other things like 이모, you can just add 시 in front.

If they do not have a 처형, they don't know the word. And so on and so forth.)  Is the 호칭/지칭 the same for most except 아가씨/시누이? Is 동서 호칭 or 지칭 or both?  [Edit] to all of you Korean learners, I'd recommend avoiding all of this by only marrying 외동딸/외아들 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ"
Korean,36icbk,lazyheroine,3,Tue May 19 19:07:04 2015 UTC,"동서 is both, but if the person 's spouse is older than your spouse, you use 형님 regardless of gender for 호칭. When in doubt, using 형님 for people older than your spouse is a safe bet. For people younger than your spouse, the 호칭 is often the same as 지칭 (except for the siblings of your husband).  Even on TV, people commonly get these confused. In an episode of Heard it Through the Geapevines, I heard a character incorrectly identify her boyfriend as ""자형"" instead of ""동서"" to the husband of her younger sister. If she were his real sister and not a sister-in-law, it would have been correct. It was rather sad because her character was supposed to be a TV anchor and know this kind of stuff."

When my mother was in college, she called her male 선배s 형 as well.   Today, when a woman calls another woman 형님, you can tell that their relationship falls under a strict hierarchy as in family relations. In a slightly older context, it is also possible that they are married to the same man, where the 형님 is the first wife.  Yes, it uses the same hanja 兄 + 님."

I've since left Mormonism behind but have held on to the one real thing it gave me: a love for international culture and language. Since then I've studied an insane amount, done some hobby translating work for comics and stuff, and generally had a lot of fun with the language.

Korean,36hiz3,ironyfree,3,Tue May 19 13:01:22 2015 UTC,Most excellent. I didn't know there were missionaries in Korea.
Korean,36hiz3,theghostofm,6,Tue May 19 13:26:01 2015 UTC,"That's totally understandable, since Korea has no need for missionaries in the traditional sense. Christianity is extremely strong and Korea is by and large a first-world nation with a strong economy, low crime, and impressive infrastructure. But the Mormons don't really send people on traditional missions; their goals are (understandably) not to strengthen Christianity nor to provide meaningful service, but to convert people to Mormonism.  That said, the Mormons are largely considered to be 이단 (Heretic) in Korea. Their reputation there is much worse than in the US (and it's pretty bad in the US). They're disliked somewhat universally, for many reasons with varying levels of fairness. Lots of Koreans, especially Christians, are told by their pastor or someone that Mormonism is a death/suicide cult, which is obviously untrue. But the Mormon church is guilty of some extremely questionable conversion practices in Korea, mostly during the 1980's.  Since I've already written this much, I might as well go on to say the Mormon religion is dwindling in Korea, with only a handful of strong congregations. There are probably less than 10,000 truly active Mormons there now (or something like 0.02% of the Korean population)."
Korean,36hiz3,jjskyo,3,Tue May 19 13:39:19 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I have seen a ton of Mormon missionaries where I'm located in the south-western area, so I assume there a lot in the other regions as well. Typical missionary question, how many people did you convert?"
Korean,36hiz3,theghostofm,3,Tue May 19 16:44:37 2015 UTC,"Hah, it's a bit embarrassing actually now that I'm not really religious. There are two answers to your question: the ""on paper"" answer and the ""real"" answer. On paper, I contributed to the conversion of 9 people. In reality though, only 2 were ""real,"" the rest were pretty weak conversions - most were mainly interested for the social aspect (Gotta admit, there's a real nice family-like feel with lots of 정) or were pressured by some peer/boss/teacher/someone who was a Mormon.  As far as the missionaries in Korea are concerned, most of them are having a really rough time dealing with things. The ones who really believe are stressed out because the church they love isn't well-loved in Korea. The ones who secretly don't believe are stressed out because they feel like they're being forced to lie. All of them are stressed out because they're held to unrealistic goals and it all boils down to a cynical numbers game. They do have free rent and utilities but literally everything else (transportation, food, bike repairs) comes from a budget of up to $300/mo (So they're certainly not starving, but since they're technically not allowed to save money month-to-month, sudden expenses might mean they're waiting until next month to go grocery shopping).  I guess I'm just trying to say a smile and friendly greeting always made my day, so if you ever see them feel free to be nice. No matter how I feel about the religion, I really feel sorry and try to be nice to the missionaries since they're just kids and are seriously under a ton of pressure."

At the time subtitles were so difficult to get and if someone were subbing them, it took a long wait (I'm not blaming subbers; I found out after participating in a subbing group that it's hard work!). Decided it would be awesome to just learn the language and understand it.  Several years later, I'm still learning and still loving it. :) Now that I can mostly get by without subtitles, I have a new goal: be proficient enough to read and understand books about Korean history, especially the Joseon dynasty (the Annals included!

I also have Korean family and two little cousins (3 and 5 years old) who know Korean and have lived in Korea for a small chunk of their lives, so I think it would be cool to talk to them in Korean someday.

Now living elsewhere, I'm constantly surrounded by Koreans.  The strange part is that when in Korea, I studied half-heartedly. I guess because it was more expected of me. I've recently start studying again (with a tutor) and I'm actually enjoying it now.  I'd say for my work, it's only marginally important as most things are in English.   Another factor in now being in a serious relationship with a Korean. So I want to make things easier for her and obviously her folks don't speak English either. I don't want to be the ass that married their daughter but never interacts with them. (She is also studying English for the the same reason)  I guess the main difference between when I started and now is that this time I actually want to learn for myself and loved ones."

I didn't want to spend years of my life studying a language just for the sake of it.  Then I got addicted to Kpop an Kdramas/movies so I decided to start learning. Met my girlfriend while studying Korean and now I travel to Korea 2-3 times per year which keeps me motivated.

They had traditional korean things all over the house and they were always having other korean families (generally from their korean church) for different celebrations, sometimes korean holidays. That and he got me into StarCraft 2. We quickly got into watching Korean starcraft at 2 to 6am. All of these things drove my curiosity up. (A bit of it was also just that I never REALLY had an idea what Korea was like, whereas I have a decent idea of what China and Japan are like.) After looking it up, it felt like everything I could dream of. Coming from Silicon Valley, Korea feels like the future. I like the history and modern culture of invention. Koreans are so genuinely giving and nice it feels unbelievable."

And K-Dramas are probably not the best tool for immersing in the language because most of what you hear isn't going to be practical (""real"") Korean.  But watching Korean TV and videos and stuff is really fun. And it's a great way to train your brain for listening once you're ready!

Korean,36guqi,hodex,5,Tue May 19 07:58:17 2015 UTC,"It's the same as 이렇다, though it is mostly used in formal writing as far as I know. The same goes for 그러하다, 저러하다, and 어떠하다.  edit: added 어떠하다."
Korean,36guqi,mieum,5,Tue May 19 11:02:41 2015 UTC,"Your usage sounds about right, except the full ""이러하다"" sounds extremely technical/formal. In conversation you would say (using your example),  그 남자는 이렇다. That guys is like this. 그렇다 (그러하다) would work as well, 그 남자는 그렇다.  That guys is like that.   On a related note if you said ""그 남자는 그저 그렇다."" You'd be saying ""he's aaight"" in a slightly insulting way lol.   Also p.s. use commas very sparingly in Korean -- in your first example you didn't need that comma after 그래서."
Korean,36guqi,littledazed,6,Tue May 19 21:38:30 2015 UTC,"I have only seen it so far as the adverbial form 이렇게 ""thusly""/like this/in this manner.  Example: 왜 이렇게 행복하지? = Why are you happy like this? (literally, why thusly be-happy?)"
Korean,36guqi,Nebuleon,3,Tue May 19 08:32:21 2015 UTC,"Your example implies that someone is asking himself a rhetorical question (why am I so happy [like this]). If you wanted to say ""why are you so happy [like this]?"" you would say, ""왜 이렇게 행복하니/행복해/행복하세요?""  Also, (I'm not sure), although 이러하다 and 이렇게 may sound similar, they are not the same words. 이러하다's contraction would be 이렇다 not 이렇게.  이렇다 is a verb and 이렇게 is a adjective/adverb. Be careful of conflating the two words."
Korean,36guqi,littledazed,1 point,Tue May 19 21:30:59 2015 UTC,"edit: this comment is replying to a removed portion of the parent comment  It does seem that 이러하다 and 이렇다 are alternative versions of each other.  Yes, 이렇다 would be a verb. Because 행복하다 is a verb, 이렇게 is an adverb for 행복하다.  In the English sentence:   Why are you happy like this?   ""like this"" is 이렇게, which is the adverb of ""are"" (to be), and ""happy"" is the adjective. But in Korean, ""are ... happy?"" is the ending verb (행복하다), so there's no adjective. Maybe the English grammar confuses you here.  Just to check if I understand the Korean way of doing things. Is this incorrect? -> ""왜 이렇해 행복하세요?"" (which is incorrect in English, as it would be saying ""Why are you happy be like this?"", and there cannot be two verbs in a row)"
Korean,36guqi,Nebuleon,1 point,Tue May 19 22:00:59 2015 UTC,"You don't need to translate a ""be"" verb into Korean except that when it shows a state of being, like ""이다"" or ""있다"".  If a sentence has ""이렇게"", I would say ""왜 이렇게 행복해해?/행복해해요?/행복해하세요?"" (adj. 행복하다 + aux. v. 아/어/여하다 = v. 행복해하다) because ""이렇게"" implies that you are watching one's action/response, not asking about one's state of mind."

Korean,36fjhu,Nebuleon,-2,Tue May 19 00:31:17 2015 UTC,"Seems to be along the lines of ""With every person I meet, it's always the same garbage""."
Korean,36fjhu,lazyheroine,4,Tue May 19 01:10:16 2015 UTC,"So the first part is a command, with the stuff in parenthesis implied 너랑 꼭 똑같은 사람(을) 만나(라). (Implied here is ""I hope you meet someone just like you, aka someone who is equally shitty"").  This is not an unusual remark to make when you're insulting someone.   Also, the subject/tense in the first sentence might seem ambiguous when you're trying to interpret this, but the 쓰레기 새꺄 (새꺄 is 새끼야 which means son of a bitch/bastard and often used in a derogatory way when directed at people) makes it so that the first part of the sentence is clearly directed to someone you hate, so you're speaking to that person.  For you and for /u/ph8ful: you both got the general feeling of the sentence. If you wanted to say ""every person I meet"" in a similar context, it would be 만나는 사람이 다 쓰레기 같네  I think what /u/ph8ful inferred is 너랑 꼭 똑같은 사람(을) 만(난다) or 만나(네), but it is a little clunky. To say ""I always meet people like you"" it would probably be more like 너같은 스레기 새끼를 계속 만나네 or something.  Also, I probably misspelled everything but whatevs, you get the point.  [edit] Ah, I had this open and reread it. I don't know why I wrote ""often used in a derogatory way when directed at people"". It's pretty much always insulting against people, lol. If you actually mean the child of someone, you should probably say 의 아들/딸/애기."

Try a Catholic 성서 I know they are slightly different but the translation is way more natural and easier to understand imo.

Unfortunately our Korean church uses this version and part of my goal with reading the bible in Korean is so that I can understand the sermons better when I'm in Korea. Why, bible language, why?

Korean,36dy7e,BruceQuillis,1 point,Tue May 19 13:59:56 2015 UTC,"This is purely a conspiracy theory..... but I heard the protestant Bibles were translated like that so many people cannot understand it and have to seek help from pastors and whatnot. (Authority!) Some words are unnecessarily made up words with Chinese characters to fit the meaning but people don't actually use the words.   But it's more likely that the translation was done decades ago, and languages evolve. So people no longer speak like that in the Bible.  Edit : maybe you can read an easier version along with the version your church uses to understand it better?"
Korean,36dy7e,skyhi14,1 point,Wed May 20 00:23:48 2015 UTC,"Haha, that is funny :)  This might be a good suggestion that makes it so that I don't depend too much on an English translation. If it's side by side with English, it's hard for me to focus on Korean since my brain kind of is either thinking in Korean or English but not back and forth.   A catholic bible probably will have endings that I understand and I can just compare them directly with the endings in the protestant version to better understand the nuances! I guess I can use it as a translation into more ""modern"" Korean, lol."

I found this to be really helpful to understand parts of the passages in Korean.  My bible is marked with a NIV sign (New International Version)
Korean,36dy7e,transparentink,3,Tue May 19 06:46:54 2015 UTC,"Modern Korean translation would be something like this:  창조하셨습니다. 하나님이 말씀하시길 빛이 있으라 하셨더니 빛이 있었고 빛과 어두움을 나누셔서...   As you could’ve guess those sentences use dead words a lot much like “thee” and “thou” so.. They are all descriptive forms and exaggerating dramatic and authentic nuances a lot, implying that “All I am saying is completely truthy and you shall not have any doubt about this” message.   You are very unlikely to see this form in real life other than Bibles."

Korean,36boik,sainthkh,3,Mon May 18 02:08:00 2015 UTC,"스크롤바의 압박 주의   Hehe, this kind of stuff is why I like clicking on your posts. Always learning something unexpected :)  I have a Korean question. ""심부름이요"" -- why would it be 이요? Do people sometimes colloquially say 심부름요?    Also, some English stuff for you: ""Everyone ready"" should be ""Get ready everyone!"" ""there wasn't the person I wanted to find."" --> ""the person I wanted to find wasn't there""    I think this part was a little confusing:     In the first sentence, the writer wanted to contrast many people and the person he wanted to find, so it was 은. It implies that there must be him if there were many people like that, but he wasn't there. In the second one, he just wanted to say it was not that crowded. That's why 이 is used there. It implies that you don't care about the number of the people, they were just there.   It might be good to number the example sentences, like 1A, 1B, etc. Also, I think using ""him""/""he"" is confusing so it might be easier if you gave the person a name or named him in your explanation and also gave the place a name in the sentence. For example, you can write ""the writer wanted to contrast the people (at the place) and the person he was looking for (let's call him 철수). This implies that because there were so many people, the writer expected 철수 to be there, but he wasn't.""   However, if you don't want to contrast many people and the person you want to find(I mean you just wanted to say there were many people for the listeners. You think that it is not important), then you can also use 이 there. Then, you are trying to say you don't care about the number of the people.   I'm not 100% sure here, but I think you mean ""However, if you just want to simply state that there are many people there without emphasizing the contrast between the large number of people and the person you are trying to find, then you can just use 이 instead of 는. It is grammatically correct both ways, but the meaning is slightly different."""
Korean,36boik,lazyheroine,2,Mon May 18 03:01:30 2015 UTC,"If you want me to answer why there is 이 in the middle, I think it should be my research topic. I am not sure why. As you said, many people also use 심부름요. Both 심부름이요 and 심부름요 are possible here.  In both cases, what you understood are correct, you phrased much better than me.  Thank you for your idea. I will use 철수 or names and specific places when explaining examples."

Korean,36boik,boredgirl543,2,Tue May 19 16:22:31 2015 UTC,Yeah i think that makes sense! For the sentence though if I were to answer 철수는 뭐해요? fully it would be (I'm on mobile so excuse typos)   철수는 심부름해요 not 심부름이에요.   [Edit] fixed typo oops. Phones.

Korean,36boik,boredgirl543,1 point,Mon May 18 13:18:24 2015 UTC,I dont think you can say either for this....  철수는 심부름이에요 doesn't make sense.   심부름이에요 is grammatically correct but it doesn't answer the sentence.  [Edit]  I think it wasn't clear the way I wrote it before... but I am not saying that 심부름이요 doesn't answer the question. I am saying that 심부름이에요 doesn't answer the question.
Korean,36boik,lazyheroine,1 point,Mon May 18 13:48:51 2015 UTC,"Sometimes 이다 is used in places that one doesn't expect or where it doesn't technically make sense. Like in a restaurant when one orders 2nd in a group--저는 만두이요 as sort of a shorthand form... I hear this all the time.

Korean,36boik,Nimora9,1 point,Mon May 18 14:02:07 2015 UTC,I am familiar with the phrase but I still don't think that the full phrase that is being shortened.  Also it would be 만두요 not 만두이요. You don't use 이 in this context for words without 받침.
Korean,36bjfl,CyCenpai,6,Mon May 18 01:19:01 2015 UTC,"Congrats on learning to type! It can be pretty frustrating without a Korean keyboard.  It should be 한글, not 한굴, btw.  Also, just some quick notes for people. I kind of just learned to type in Koraen intuitively when I was in middle school, when I was first allowed to use our family computer (ah I'm making my age obvious, oops lol).  Do you happen to know the reason why the different letters are in different places? I want to look it up but I'm not sure what I would even google.   I think it is interesting that:     All the vowels are going to be with your right hand and all consonants with left hand so you go back and forth between hands more or less equally. All the 쌍 words (ㅃ, ㅉ, ㄸ, ㄲ, ㅆ) are with your left hand at the top. They're done with shift (intuitive). ㅇ should pretty much always be under your middle finger of your left hand, which is convenient because it gets used a lot.   [edit] btw, the way my dad came up with to help me figure out where the letters are... he cut out every single letter with paper and used scotch tape to cover the keyboard. I already had learned English typing from school so he just covered up the alphabet haha. I don't recommend this, it makes your keyboard look like shit and I actually memorized the keyboard ASAP because it bothered me so much, lol. (Maybe this is good motivation?)"

You should spend some time making this look pretty because first impressions mean a lot. Your website looks like it was slapped together in 30 seconds. You what, downloaded bootstrap and then threw some text in and didn't bother optimizing it at all or making it look presentable.  Next, from what I've read about the software, it has the ability to lock out all the windows and make you focus on studying. I'm sorry but no. There are too many things wrong with this, especially from a developer that I know nothing about. Super super sketchy.  I haven't even seen how it actually works for learning, but from the comments in your other thread I can pretty much conclude that this would actually hurt more than it would help when learning 한글.  That's my impression."

If you don't feel good about it then of course you shouldn't download it  As far as claiming in a blanket statement it won't help anyone  just from looking at the comments. That's pretty unfair.

Korean,3696fj,lamalamalamalamalama,4,Sun May 17 13:25:18 2015 UTC,"Mine uses an entirely different algorithm than anki. Anki is based on a self reporting system where you push a button depending on how well you knew it and it combines that with how long its been since you have seen it.  Mine detects how long it took you to type in the answer, factors in answer length and then assigns a percentage mastery score to the card based on how many times you answered it correctly and how long each time took.  this determines spacing between reviews.   But anki decks WITHOUT current progress can easily be imported. I actually built a tool that can do this."

I believe Google Docs automatically does (or used to do) OCR when you upload a document, or try googling ""korean ocr"" and you should find some.  Your mom's handwriting looks very clean, so I think if you were to get a good scan (pdf seems to work best for OCR programs) you might have some success.

For example:    For 귀걸이, you can also use 끼다/빼다. For 속눈섭, I'd say it is more common to use 붙이다.  Also, for this part:     하다 is also used with cosmetics like 화장하다 or 화장을 하다, so we can change 바르다 with 하다 in our previous examples.   I think this isn't what you are saying, but it isn't super clear so I wanted to point it out. You can use 화장하다, but it sounds weird to me to say 립스틱을/볼터치를/로션을 하다 and only 바르다 works."

Korean,3631lp,patchate,1 point,Tue May 19 07:07:40 2015 UTC,"antman1111 has the right idea. Here's a simple phrase: ""I love you."" Aside from the fact that most Korean dudes won't say this (el oh el), the standard informal way to say it would be 너를 사랑해 or 널 사랑해. But then there are hundreds of different ways of saying this exact phrase depending on formality/context. For example:  (1) 당신을 사랑합니다. (more formal)  (2) 그대를 사랑합니다. (same expression)  (3) 그쪽을 사랑해요. (same expression)  (4) 니 사랑한다. (one version of Korean dialect)  etc.  In English, you can say ""I love you"" to anyone. Girlfriend, wife, son, husband, mom, dad, grandma, uncle, aunt, Bobba-Fet, Conan O'Brien, whoever. Doesn't matter, one expression fits all. In Korean, you can't, because it would be weird. Using #4 to your girlfriend would only be proper if you are within 10 miles of the province that uses that dialect, unless you wanted everyone to know that you were from that province. Using #1/2/3/4 to your grandma would be totally weird because they carry the connotation of romantic love, as written. But if you were to replace the word ""you"" with a proper noun and say the same exact phrase, it would be totally OK. i.e. saying ""엄마를 사랑해요"" or ""사랑해요"" to your mom.  So, nuanced. Hard to tell in the beginning, but everyone can get there eventually - it just requires a person to live in Korea/speak with a Korean for a few years. :)"
Korean,3631lp,ADSRelease,1 point,Tue May 19 11:01:52 2015 UTC,"yeah. i'm certainly beginning to see how word choice and grammar choice plays a heavy effect. certain ways of being nuanced in english don't translate at all, so when I was first learning korean it seemed to lack nuance. instead, i guess i'm finding it in other places. (additionally, my Korean friend that was very fluent in english would always translate my english to grammar froms that, if translate back, were almost awkwardly blunt and lacked flow.)  the grammar thing as a whole is one of the hardest things, conceptually. In English, you just add words. (there are some things analogous to this, like using 보다 tried/experienced.)

(It's kind of difficult to fix problems until you identify them and I have no good way of identifying problems, sigh.)  I tried to ""remedy"" my poor habits by going through all of the TTMIK lessons, but it was really difficult because they were all too easy for me and it was too difficult to actually listen to hours of audio to find the one grammar point that I had taught myself incorrectly. (They're super high quality so I was disappointed that the level wasn't the issue for me!) It's also compounded by the fact that in texting/writing on social media, most people won't use proper grammar and I don't know which things I write are improper and which are proper.

Let me be clear, i don't want to sound whiny, i think i'm doing kind of good now but here's a list:   Being constant: Now i study every weekday and try to study some days of the weekend but it's very easy to fall in laziness and see how an entire day passes and i haven't done anything. Some other times, i just feel unmotivated like i'm not advancing at all (without having a class, classmates and exams to measure how well i'm doing) or i should be doing something more important and because this i stopped studying for 3 months like a person who has the new year's resolution of going to the gym, goes twice and then nevermore. The worst part about it was having to start since the beginning to revise for a couple of weeks.  Having to get all the lessons out: That's just my study style but i like to make my own korean lessons written on a paper so i can take them with me to some places like when going in the metro to college (there isn't internet reception down there if you wonder) and is easier to remember. I also like to get the lessons from a couple of different places like the talk to me in korean podcast, the korean from zero book and a couple others so when i'm writing i have to look in a lot of places, understanding the lesson and writing it, which is a couple of hours for some chapters (4-5 lessons for every chapter + vocabulary.).  When all these sources decide to teach different words, expressions and structures for the same concepts. This has happened at least 5 times for sure. Now it's up to me to see if they're both correct, or what is the subtle difference between the two or if someone is teaching some outdated or way to formal expression.  Not having time or motivation to practise new phrases or having a language pen-pal."

Korean,3631lp,RCIX,14,Fri May 15 18:37:57 2015 UTC,"This will come across as being direct (I'm speaking to everyone in your situation and not just you) but I don't think ""not having time to study"" is a legitimate excuse in most cases. Unless you're working 2 full time jobs and have a kid, or have some other situation that truly physically prevents you from studying everyday, then you have plenty of time to study. You have time to call and meet friends, time to relax in the library and time for sports if you're a student, lunch breaks if you're a worker, and time to commute to work if you drive. You probably also have a Steam account with several completed games and are looking forward to playing some new ones during the Summer sale. You have time. There are many ways to study Korean and almost everyone has time for the things they truly want to do. Sometimes there are times that I might tell myself ""I wish I had time to do X"" but in reality I'm just trying to comfort myself for being too lazy about it. I should really tell myself ""I'm too lazy to learn X, and I wish I was good at it already so I wouldn't have to work at it."" If you want to learn, then you can probably find time, but if you think you want to learn but don't actually want to, then it just means your priorities are in a different place and Korean is not really something you want to devote your time to - you'd rather play games, meet friends, relax, and that's fine and nobody's forcing you to learn Korean, but that doesn't mean you don't have the time to do it. edit: spelling"

Korean,3619tp,BiteTheCookie,4,Fri May 15 06:35:25 2015 UTC,"This is pretty cool, but a little problem with the train of thought here is that 아쉽다 certainly isn't restricted to educational contexts. It can be used to describe a pretty wide range of situations where things are regrettable/a pity/lamentable/a bummer because things worked out the way they did when the more preferable outcome very much could have happened for only just missing out, etc. It's also not your only option in this context. For your example where someone only just came up short on a perfect score on a test, 안타깝다 or 안습 (眼濕 ""bringing mist/'wetness' to the eyes"") would work just as well.    Actually, could you give us the exact assignment and confirm whether or not you've covered 아쉽다 in class? Rereading your post got me wondering if she's just trying to steer you away from a word like 한 and instead towards 고유어 and their cultural history."
Korean,3619tp,shkencorebreaks,1 point,Fri May 15 10:43:35 2015 UTC,"I am aware that 아쉽다 isn't just for educational texts. My research question is ""Why are there some Korean words that don't have a direct translation in English and what do these words say about Korean culture and society?"" For example, 책 can be directly translated to ""book"", but with 한, there is a deeper cultural meaning to it.   Since my professor mentioned that 아쉽다 is a native Korean word, I am wondering if there are any cultural meaning that came about to the word. We use the book ""Korean Language in Culture and Society"" by Ho-min Sohn and there was a section for proverbs and how they reflect culture. It talked about how proverbs Korean proverbs can be divided into 3 categories, one of them optionality and opportunism. I thought that perhaps 아쉽다 could have stemmed from something like missing an opportunity."
Korean,3619tp,lemonfighter,1 point,Fri May 15 20:28:41 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the significance you're placing on 아쉽다 being a native Korean word. So is 먹다, and so are 나무 and 맛있다. That doesn't really mean anything.  In any case, I think you're focusing too much on 아쉽다 - I don't think it reflects anything about Korean culture and it's easily translateable to English. I think that 한 is a good example for what you want, though. Personally, rather than going the route of cherry picking words to fit the narrative of Korea being conformist and obsessed with appearances and whatever other stereotypes people have (not saying you're doing that, but I think most people given this question would), I'd be much more inclined to bring up things like how 먹다 can mean ""eat"" or ""drink"" which might indicate a looser distinction between consuming solids and liquids and by extension states of matter themselves than what we have in English (I'm reaching here), or that 물고기 contains the same word for ""meat"" found in the words for ""beef"" and ""pork"", which might indicate that fish is classified more strongly as animal meat that it is in Western societies (see pescetarianism, etc.). These aren't difficult to translate to English either though."
Korean,3619tp,littledazed,1 point,Sun May 17 09:55:56 2015 UTC,"I think 아쉽다 does have a cultural significance to it. The fact that I can't really explain it in English said a lot. All the examples you mentioned, they're concrete and straightforward. But 아쉽다 is a much more nuanced feeling you get, used to express disappointment over failed expectations (commonly in interpersonal relations).   Personally I think the example the teacher gave was not representative although it got the point across. But to say that it doesn't have a cultural significance is a gross oversimplification of the word (as is just concluding that it must be related to education)."
Korean,3619tp,theghostofm,1 point,Tue May 19 21:55:38 2015 UTC,"Which 한 are you focusing on? I'm guessing 限?   Koreans have suffered through the structure of social classes, and outside forces suppressing them   What does 限 (or whichever other 한) have to do with that? It seems like an arbitrary application of the meaning without a lot of actual correlation.  As for 아쉽다, it just expresses a feeling of ""that's too bad."" It doesn't have anything to do with education, and it's not a word with culturally significant etymology.

Korean,3619tp,Pikmeir,-4,Fri May 15 21:00:58 2015 UTC,"If I were to write about education in Korea I would focus on the words 교육열, 고삼병, and 시험지옥.    아쉽다 is perhaps difficult to translate but it is not really a cultural word.  It just means you wish you had more of something or that you are feeling the lack of something.    I'm not sure what you are talking about with 한 either.  Also I don't think it is correct to say that ""Koreans have suffered through the structure of social classes.""  Way to state your own way of thinking and your own culture as the correct way of doing things.    무궁화 means like ""indestructible"" which is pretty related to all of their invasions in my opinion.  I'd focus on that in that area."
Korean,3619tp,theghostofm,1 point,Fri May 15 14:16:50 2015 UTC,"As for 한, I wanted to say how it is a word that is specific towards Korean culture. Most definitions would be something like ""great suffering"" but there is a whole cultural aspect behind it. For example, with the social class, I meant to say that perhaps people felt suppressed by the rigid social class structure with the yangban class and how it was difficult to move up the ladder. Thus, because of that, people were suffering in poverty and held that resentment towards the upper-class.  My goal for this paper is to find words that don't have a direct English translation and how these words reflect the Korean culture and society. I just simply thought that because 아쉽다 is a native Korean word, there would be something that ties that word to the culture."
Korean,3619tp,chantroll,3,Fri May 15 20:48:42 2015 UTC,"words that don't have a direct English translation   There are no such words, but there are plenty of words in both Korean and English that don't translate 1:1 - or to/from any two languages that don't translate 1:1. 한 can be translated easily in context, although it doesn't have a 1:1 translation. But even basic words in English don't have 1:1 translations in Korean either, such as ""cool"" (since it can have so many translations), but in context there's always a way to translate them."

It might sound weird to say this with 좋아하다.)  In general, in sort of more formal situations, for some reason, 잘 먹다 feels like a more polite/reserved way of expressing that you like something. I tend to be less bubbly/dramatic with my word choice in more formal contexts (but I'm not sure if this is a cultural thing or a personal thing. I'm assuming it's at least in part cultural, because I've noticed my husband do the same thing when he speaks with his father.) In general, I've observed that Koreans (who have not spent extensive time in the US) tend to use more formal/reserved speech patterns with a wider group of people than people in the US, which might be why you're seeing very few people use 좋아하다.   These are just my observations though!"

So the fact that I use it to emphasize that more than just eating it a lot, I actually really like it, illustrates your point! Thanks so much for clarifying!"

If you notice, when people say the double consonants, they say them louder (or higher pitch? I'm not sure the proper term) compared to the single consonant. If you have access to forvo, listen to heechang2 pronounce 사 vs 싸 for a really good example.  사  싸"
Korean,35x3ie,arienzio,1 point,Thu May 14 16:13:09 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a pitch distinction between double and single consonants, which is the most obvious difference to me. Also it's common to see ㅅ analyzed as an aspirated, breathier [sʰ], so trying to gently say ""hsa"" is a fairly close approximation. ㅆ is basically just the English /s/, plus the higher pitch."
Korean,35x3ie,Pikmeir,1 point,Thu May 14 21:55:56 2015 UTC,"There isn't a pitch distinction - if there is between those two files, it's only because the speaker said them with different pitches. Modern Korean doesn't have pitch distinction."
Korean,35x3ie,arienzio,2,Thu May 14 21:59:27 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm not talking about the pitch accent system that only particular dialects have, but this one analysis of how younger speakers distinguish tense/lax/aspirated consonants. It's only a proposed idea I think, and I don't have the book I read the idea in at hand right now, so here's a lazy Wikipedia paste:  ""...the ""laxed"" sounds are voiced consonants which become devoiced initially; and ... the primary distinguishing feature between word-initial ""laxed"" and ""tensed"" consonants is that initial laxed sounds cause the following vowel to assume a low-to-high pitch contour – a feature reportedly associated with voiced consonants in many Asian languages – whereas tensed (and also aspirated) consonants are associated with a uniformly high pitch.""  It seems in line with how I perceive the consonants when I listen carefully, but what do you think?"
Korean,35x3ie,Pikmeir,1 point,Thu May 14 22:17:38 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay, I thought you meant different tones/pitch like Chinese has. I don't know about the theory of younger people distinguishing tense/lax/aspirated though that you're mentioning so I can't really give a good comment about that."
Korean,35x3ie,lazyheroine,4,Thu May 14 22:25:22 2015 UTC,"Hm, my comment below isn't visible because I think the poster deleted the comment (or maybe mods did?)  Here's the original comment:     I think I commented about this before somewhere (I forgot where) but as someone who grew up speaking Korean, I think that the differences do shift based on the words. It helps to think of (example) ㄱ/ㄲ/ㅋ as a spectrum rather than ""absolute"". So ㄱ is always less aspirated than ㄲ, ㅋ is always more nasal than ㄲ, etc. I'd say that the ""absolute"" sound is going to sound different depending on the vowel and the sound right before/after. So it's going to be a lot easier to hear the differences between something like 어디 가요/ 그럴까요 / 아메리카요 than 3 unrelated sounds like 가로수길 and 콜라.     I wanted to continue the discussion with /u/KEH_Linguist because it is pretty interesting but I can't see the followup comments in my browser because the original was deleted and it's really hard to see what's going on and which reply is to what, so I copied it here. His/her comment is here, you all should read it even though it isn't being shown in the thread.  I haven't really studied Korean academically, so my comment was written from observations from the point of a person who learned Korean naturally through sound. It's interesting to see how this fits with someone who is a linguist and has studied languages in a more academic context. (I'm assuming you have studied languages academically based on the word choice and other comments that I've seen here and there, but correct me if you aren't!)    For my original comment, after reading yours, I agree that laxness/tenseness for ㄱ ㄲ and aspiration for ㅋ are better descriptors. Thanks for the vocabulary correction there!    Anyways, I was curious about this one thing: How do you think the spectrum works for people who are learning? A couple of my IRL friends are dabbling in learning Korean and they have told me that ㄱ/ㅋ and ㄲ/ㅋ is just has difficult to hear for them as ㄱ/ㄲ, which would technically be closer on the spectrum. Do you think the aspiration makes it so that an average learner would pick up ㅋ more quickly than the difference between ㄱ/ㄲ?"
Korean,35x3ie,KEH_Linguist,3,Thu May 14 17:58:29 2015 UTC,"You're right, my academic background is in theoretical linguistics and Korean linguistics in particular. What people seem to be missing is that all languages distinguish and categorize sounds according to different phonetic features. I actually commented on it here a few days ago. As far as your friends, all three types of consonants will be difficult for a non-Korean speaker to distinguish because English has only a two-way distinction based on voicing, which is completely different than the three-way distinction based on laxness/tenseness and aspiration in Korean. As far as I know, this is unique to Korean. Most languages are either similar to English and make a voiced/voiceless distinction or make a different three-way distinction between voiced/voiceless/aspirated. Not sure if that really answered your question."

Korean,35x3ie,lazyheroine,6,Fri May 15 01:37:19 2015 UTC,"I'd like to add my voice behind this question, because I am also confused.  To start, I've noticed that in videos like (99Korean) Korean alphabet & reading 한국어 자음, 모음, 읽기, timestamp 20:32 minutes, whose purpose is to indicate what the sounds should be, many teachers will make different sounds for single, double and aspirated consonants. The differences will also be clear.  However, like OP, when hearing anything said by a native Korean speaker, where I learn that a syllable should have a double consonant as its initial sound, I hear nothing different. Either the speaker is making no different sound, or the speech is too fast to hear the different sound."
Korean,35x3ie,ADSRelease,3,Thu May 14 06:58:13 2015 UTC,"This might be due in part to lack of enunciation in casual speak.   I have spoken Korean since I can remember and to me, even though the single/double/aspirated consonants are very distinct when I hear them, the differences are extremely subtle unless someone is exaggerating the sound. (Or in other words, the differences are tiny but they are different.)   If you're speaking to a native speaker, the differences are definitely there. It sounds very strange if someone isn't making the differences at all. (Disclaimer: If the native speakers you are talking to have 사투리, some 사투리 sounds are different than 서울말.)  BTW, if you're speaking to native speakers often, it might be helpful to ask them to try to overexaggerate while your brain is learning the subtle differences!"

Of course, merely being in Korea on its own is not enough - working in an English speaking environment during the day and hanging out with expats in the evening won't do anything to improve your Korean. (You'll meet lots of people in that boat.) But if you are serious about learning, do your utmost to avoid English, take some classes and socialize with people with very limited English skills; in brief, if you really immerse yourself in every way you can, then your Korean will improve far quicker than were you not in Korea. I don't really see any way anyone could disagree with that."
Korean,35tz7u,feedmefeces,19,Wed May 13 14:54:24 2015 UTC,Even if you move to Korea you have to actively seek to improve your Korean and use it in your everyday life as much as possible as well as having focused study sessions. It's very possible to survive in Korea by only using English. Try your best to speak Korean as much as possible and make lots of Korean friends who can't speak very good English and you will learn quickly.

It's really hard to ""randomly"" meet someone in Korean (and as a result, blind dating is by far the most common way for men and women to meet each other). So if you move here, and follow your hobbies/ join a club/ study at a langauge exchange cafe, then you're bound to learn quicker than you would at home.   Language learning is all about total time spent with the language. If you're in Korean, the opportunities to spent time in and around Korean increase, therefore so do your chances of learning."
Korean,35tz7u,bigbirrrd,1 point,Thu May 14 00:33:11 2015 UTC,More than likely if there is a hobby there is a naver group. I joined my fixie club on naver.

After that I was their little bro. Man I miss those guys....

Korean,35qbmd,madmads,3,Tue May 12 21:00:58 2015 UTC,"너의 여자친구 가르쳐줘요.

In Korean, you usually don't use the word ""she"" as much as you would in English. I'd rephrase the sentences about the present so that ""she"" is implied and/or you use ""제 여자친구"". Using 그녀 sounds a little weird. For example, maybe something like 화이트데이에 여자친구에게 선물(을) 줬어요 or [object]을/를 선물했어요.   BTW, you're mixing the 나 and 저 forms between sentences. It sounds odd to flip, it would be better to just pick one (존댓말 아니면 반말) and go with it."
Korean,35qbmd,lazyheroine,2,Tue May 12 23:31:29 2015 UTC,"To be specific about the 나, 너 confusion as well as 존댓말 vs 반말, they are only somewhat related concepts. 존댓말 is used when showing respect to the person you are speaking about, where as 저 is used to humble yourself to the person you are speaking to. There is another aspect to Korean honorifics which is used when showing respect to the person you are speaking to, namely ending informally, ending with -요 or ending with -(스)ㅂ니다. There is also an ending which tends to be used more in writing and has no specified audience.  Now, it is possible to respect someone by using a more polite ending while still considering them your equal or below you, by using 나 to refer to yourself and ending with 요 for example. Use 저 when you want to not only be polite but also humble yourself. Correct me if I'm wrong but I can't think of a situation where you would use 저 but not also respect the person you're speaking to, other than perhaps a close friend who is older than you. In any case it's less common than  Last but not least if you're talking to your friend about your teacher or grandmother, you might saying like 내 선생님께서 수업을 취소하셨어. The use of ""내"" and ""었어"" are for your friend. The marker ""께서"" and verb ""취소하시다"" (as opposed to 취소하다) serve to honor your teacher.  Online it's really up to you, most people default to using 반말 with 나 (unless the subject is someone talked about with 존댓말). Change to 저 as appropriate for who you're communicating with, not just swapped around with 나 whenever."
Korean,35qbmd,shank86,1 point,Wed May 13 12:00:58 2015 UTC,"This was a great explanation of a complicated concept. :)   I should have probably clarified and written ""It sounds odd to flip, pick one, either is fine to this audience (internet).""

I have to say I can only thank my teacher for teaching this so well.   Just gonna put the rest of the nuances of honorifics here (directed at OP to this thread and anyone else who stumbles upon this). I forgot to mention there are also verbs for actions where an honored person is the recipient as opposed to the one doing the action such as 드리다 instead of 주시다. You never honor yourself by using an honorific verb like 내가 식사를 드셨어. Also, you can use 주세요 to request an honored person to do something, but to make a command there is the ending -십시오, for example you could say 할머님, 잠을 주무십시오. Finally (hopefully actually last) in 반말  you can say 가자 ""let's go"" but in 존댓말, (으)ㅂ시다 takes the place of 자, 갑시다."
Korean,35qbmd,shank86,1 point,Wed May 13 14:07:08 2015 UTC,"Yup! Just fyi, uou wouldn't say 잠을 주무시다. 잠 is implied in the word and you should just say 할머님, 주무세요."

I do, however, as a gyopo (technically native but haven't ""studied"" Korean) often use 저는/나는 at the beginning of the sentence for (1) clarity if subject isn't clear from context (2) to emphasize difference or (3) as a filler word when I haven't thought of how to reply, lol.  So an example text convo: Person 1: 야 우리 언제 만나? Person 2: 내일 저녁 괜찮아?  Person 1: 응, 그때 만나자. 7시 괜찮지? Person 3: 아... 나는 내일 선약있어. 금요일은 어때?

Korean,35k3le,vvitchbaby,4,Mon May 11 03:15:24 2015 UTC,"It seems like she's talking about assimilation, specifically resyllabifcation. It's not so much in writing, but in your pronunciation. Since there's no consonant at the beginning of the second syllable in your example, the consonant at the end of the first syllable is assimilated and sounds as though it is the first consonant of the second syllable.  So, you wouldn't pronounce it ""악...읻"" but ""아...긷""  Maybe she brought it up when you're talking about writing because it can make it difficult to correctly spell a word that you don't know if there is any assimilation."
Korean,35k3le,Nebuleon,1 point,Mon May 11 04:30:28 2015 UTC,"The rule, if you want to research it more, is called 연음화.  I learned about this last week in Korean Lessons for Beginners 002, timestamp 07:00 minutes. Basically, in a pair of syllables A + B, if A ends with a consonant and B starts with ㅇ, you move A's ending consonant into B's starting consonant for pronunciation purposes.  The example given in the video is 제이슨은 학생 이에요, ""Jason is a student"". For pronunciation purposes, 제이슨은 counts as [제이스는].  In a later unit, there is the word 저것, ""that thing"". In isolation, you'd pronounce the ending ㅅ like a ㄷ, but in a sentence like 저것은 저기 있습니다, ""That thing is over there"", you'd move the ㅅ into 은, so it counts as [저거슨]."

Korean,35klp4,sainthkh,5,Mon May 11 06:52:41 2015 UTC,"Alright, here's a classic example of natives explaining their own language pretty badly.  For those who want to understand nominalization (making verbs into nouns-- what he tried to explain in this post). I suggest clicking this super long link that I padded with words so that you can see it and click it.  As for the (으)ㅁ ending that he explained. He actually explained an informal speech trend that has gained more usage lately. Which is just ending your statements or questions with ㅁ. ((Note: this is not to be confused with the 사투리 of ""해주삼"" or ""해주셈"", that's different.)) Fun thing is, you can use it for more than just past tense! ""모[뭐]함"" isn't an uncommon thing to receive on your kakao or texts; there's present tense. I've gotten very flat, dry ""알았음""s before as well, there's past tense again. You can even say ""하겠음"", whoooa look at that future tense.  As for ""기"", if you watched that video I linked earlier, you'd notice that it's the same as ""(으)ㅁ"". Both of these (as well as 는 것) all mean ""~ing"". So ""doing"" can be either 하는 것, 하기, or 함. Where and when each is used depends on the grammar point being used, and/or simply convention of how it's used in the Hangooks. Temporal... emphasis really doesn't have much to do with it. You will, however, notice 기 in lists more, so I guess if you had to give it a nuance, that's it."

Korean,35klp4,tkdjdgrl,0,Tue May 12 00:48:45 2015 UTC,"I researched a little bit more after this comment. 하겠음(I will do it) can be future tense because of ""겠"" in the middle and the ending 음 is about the decision or your will. (It is kind of mixture of the two.)  However, explaining that 음 is used with past tense can make you confuse.  It sounds better if I phrased it like this.     -음/-ㅁ is used when something is decided or finished. In addition, it is sometimes used to show your will. As you can guess, if something is decided or finished, it is usually done in the past, so they are used a lot with past tenses. However, like in the case of ""하겠음,"" meaning I will do it, it is sometimes used with the future tense ""겠"" and showing your will.   With this, it might be much better if I showed you some more examples with useful phrases like ""~ 것임을 알다/모르다"" ""-기 전에"" ""-기 위해서.""     Thank you for your warm comment.

Because corner lyrics appear as the first syllable is being sung, you might lose a few. Fan lyric videos may or may not start the lyrics before they're being sung. If they show it before, that helps a lot.  I'm starting stage 3 after 3~4 months of practice with that, and reading and (hand)writing words from written lessons like this.

Obviously if you want to understand everything then you need to know every single word in every single sentence and understand all the grammar - this will not take a month, this will take years.

There's the one where you expect words. At this stage, you can start to read aloud while looking 1, 2 or 3 words ahead, so you don't hesitate between reading every word, but you're still reading sequentially.  Then there's the one where you read to yourself faster than you read aloud. You use this kind of reading when you're reading letters and mutter while skipping the boilerplate, not knowing where it ends so you're still reading everything: ""Dear Sir/Madam, we regret to inform la la la blah blah blah...""

I don't know exactly what he means by that, but I assume it means being able to read Korean at roughly the same pace as a Korean would read it if he read it out loud. This also includes having proper intonation and pauses between words of course, not just blurting out every sound as fast as one can. By extension this means that reading hangeul will not exhaust you the same way it does when you first learn it.  I assume being able to skim through a letter in a few seconds is a skill that would take years to learn.

Not all country names will end in 국, however. The Phillipines, for example, are 필리핀.  edit: revoked massive parts of this post due to there having been errors"
Korean,35gq5i,Nebuleon,10,Sun May 10 04:48:54 2015 UTC,"The “United States” in Korea (and Chinese for that matter) literally translates to “beautiful country.”   I should note that 美 wasn't chose necessarily because of its positive connotations. It's short for 阿美利加, a Chinese transliteration of America (pronounced Āměilìjiā in modern Mandarin).   That being said, the earliest transcription of ""America"" in Chinese was 亞墨利加 Yàmòlìjiā in 1602, but by 1858 the Qing Dynasty signed a treaty that referred to the U.S. as 亞美理駕合衆國 Yàměilǐjià Hézhòngguó, and the 美 abbreviation began to become used in common usage in Chinese and Korean after that.   (Japanese uses a different hanja, 米 as the hanzi/hanja/kanji abbreviation for America, a derivation from 米利堅 ""American"", which in turn comes from 弥利堅, attested to in the Chinese poem ""都中吟"")."
Korean,35gq5i,kungming2,4,Sun May 10 05:32:28 2015 UTC,"i was wondering about the exact origin. people know it comes from China, but thinking of it as ""beautiful country"" IS the common understanding among Koreans, at least the ones I know"
Korean,35gq5i,ADSRelease,5,Sun May 10 09:38:49 2015 UTC,"but thinking of it as ""beautiful country"" IS the common understanding among Koreans, at least the ones I know   Absolutely, same in Chinese, people think of it as ""beautiful"" now. But the origins are ultimately still phonetic, even if the people at the time tried to assign generally nice-meaning characters to the country. America is technically no more the ""beautiful country"" in Korean than Germany is the ""solitary country"" (독일, 獨逸)."
Korean,35gq5i,kungming2,3,Sun May 10 19:18:52 2015 UTC,"This comment (info from the site), and the post on this sub from earlier today about the sound of ㄹ, are just a couple of reasons why howtostudykorean isn't a recommended web site to learn from for beginners. Errors such as these are quite common there."
Korean,35gq5i,Pikmeir,2,Sun May 10 05:51:38 2015 UTC,Thank you for the comment. I'll try my best to avoid linking to their hanja and pronunciation sections in the future.  Are the Korean vocabulary and grammar units also full of errors?
Korean,35gq5i,Nebuleon,5,Sun May 10 05:59:14 2015 UTC,"I can't say for every chapter. Originally I'd sent the creator messages over Reddit suggesting fixes for the errors in sections 1-8 (mostly typos, but some incorrect grammar explanations), and he seemed to want to improve the site. But after each correction I sent, he responded something like ""Thanks for the suggestions, but they're not technically errors, they're just my different method of teaching"" so I stopped helping after going back and forth a few times with corrections and getting the same type of responses because I felt it was wasting my time. So I can say probably the first 1-8 lessons are fine for the most part, but beyond that I can't comment in detail as I haven't read all of them; though I'd assume they're not going to be much different. Every once in awhile someone posts a link to the site and I'll look at it, and there are always a few errors in it, so I stopped looking. Generally if you search that site on this sub you'll find plenty of confused learners asking questions, which is the reason I ultimately left it off of the resource thread on the sidebar."
Korean,35gq5i,Pikmeir,3,Sun May 10 06:09:23 2015 UTC,"When I started Pimsleur/Korean, they said 영어를 was the English language, without initially explaining that 영어 was the English language and 를 was the particle to end the object of a sentence, but this was explained in one of the later units.  You'd be able to tell me more than I could: On that site, are these actually errors (of spelling or meaning), or are they mostly-correct things that get fully explained in later units, like in Pimsleur?"
Korean,35gq5i,Nebuleon,3,Sun May 10 06:16:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's definitely a difference between common typos/mishaps (like 영어를 as ""English"") and actual errors (like saying ㄹ = /r/l and making up rules for when it's r and when it's l, or giving several incorrect definitions in the same section). I'm more concerned with the latter type and that's what I found on that site. edit: I should add that the third kind of errors, the ""Pimsleur"" ones you mention, also exist too, but actually all 3 types I've mentioned are on the site, so most people don't recommend it anymore."
Korean,35gq5i,Pikmeir,2,Sun May 10 06:29:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the origins of the word, but in the Naver dictionary, 미국 has the 한자 as 美國. I don't think the howtostudykorean site is necessarily incorrect about the word's 한자, just which meaning of the character is intended. Many 한자 characters have multiple meanings.  Anyways, for OP, many Korean words have sino-Korean origins. It can be very helpful to notice these patterns (though I recommend looking them up to verify if it is indeed a sino-Korean root) because it can help improve your vocabulary much faster. Examples of non-country-name words with 국 are 출국 (to leave a country), 입국 (to enter a country), 국민 (nation, a nation's people)."
Korean,35dfeu,Human-Chickenpede,9,Sat May 9 06:20:25 2015 UTC,"I asked this a while back and couldn't really find anything so I came up with some other ideas. What you can do is find a popular anime that is subbed in Korean and then play it at the same time as the English dub. Example: Sword Art Online has been dubbed in English and I know that Korean subs are easy to find for it. Open the English dub in one tab and play the Korean subbed video with the volume off.    OR  You can download episodes of any dubbed anime and then search for subs using ""anime name 자막"" and then display them on the video using VLC or something (GOM Player is good for this too). The subs may not be 100% accurate as they are for the original anime and some thing may get lost in translation.    You can try watching drama. After a long day of studying I try and kick back and watch an episode of drama. It's pretty fun and you pick up words pretty easily (it's like watching Anime with eng subtitles). Variety Shows are also good to watch too because they usually have captions of what's being said. Boys Over Flowers is a good drama and Weekly Idol is a fun variety show if you like the kpop stuff. The hosts are pretty funny, I can watch that show all day (just in case you needed recommendations). It's late, please excuse grammar mistakes :-)"

I like to force myself to go at least a little bit further than this. Ask about the food, what is in it, explain that you have an allergy for something, ask to move to somewhere with less of a draft, say you've been studying for x months, say you want to move to Korea, ask if they were born in Korea or where they are from.

Obviously as a beginner you will make mistakes and thats perfectly normal. Getting to talk to a native is a good way to practice your speaking skills. Often those mistakes you made will stick better in your head and can be of great learning experience. Talking in a new language is scary at first but its highly recommended to keep doing it ;).

Korean,34zt0s,imbrad91,12,Tue May 5 23:02:35 2015 UTC,I thought you were Korean until you read '인터넷' and said the f-word three times.
Korean,34zt0s,hatbeat,5,Wed May 6 05:01:36 2015 UTC,"Hey you're really good in terms of reading speed for you level. I think if you wanted to work on sound more natural, you could slow it down a bit and enunciate more. I found I had to look at the script to understand some of the words you were saying."
Korean,34zt0s,tttdph91,3,Thu May 7 00:44:28 2015 UTC,Your Korean is really good except for a slight accent. Keep up the good work!
Korean,34zt0s,Parktheredbus,6,Mon May 11 23:54:34 2015 UTC,"Hiyo, I'm the gyopo/hybrid native that randomly shows up on these threads because it's awesome for killing timeee.   This is going to sound like an odd comment but based on the way that you swear (lol the only English sample I have) I think your Korean needs to move.... back into your throat a little bit? I don't know if it makes sense, I'm not sure how to explain it. For the consonant sounds, a few of the ㅈ, ㄱ, and ㄷ sound a little bit nasal, but should be a little more open. Also, I noticed that sometimes you need to open more when you say words like 반찬 (the ㅏ sounds). It might help as a practice exercise to try a few sentences with super overexaggerated vowels to make sure you're getting the full openness in the vowel sound.  Small note: try to make sure you're not pronouncing English words like you would in English. For example, try to pronounce each syllable of 스티브 and 인터넷 instead of blending them together.   Great job overall!"
Korean,34zt0s,lazyheroine,2,Thu May 7 02:27:46 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for the advice.  What do you mean though by 'open' exactly? Do you mean opening my mouth more and back into my throat more?    I'm not very familiar with linguistics terms related to pronunciation/phonetics."
Korean,34zt0s,imbrad91,2,Thu May 7 02:37:29 2015 UTC,"No worries, I'm totally not using the right linguistic terms at all (ahh gyopo limitation!)   Yeah, I think focusing more on enunciating the vowels will make everything sound more ""open"". I think the difference with the vowels is probably like saying the vowel for like a milisecond more, but it makes a difference in the way the flow sounds.  Also, for the nasal/open for the consonant sounds, what I mean is try making the sounds more from throat rather than using your nose to get the sound? It's kind of hard to explain this concept in words and I don't know the linguistic words for this. I think for a lot of English speakers, the natural tendency is to make Korean more nasal, but for me, neither Korean nor English sounds nasal and it's more like breath/mouth shape differences. I can try to say the same sentence with more front/nasal sounds vs more natural ""back"" sounds to compare, in the morning but I think I'll have to practice overexaggerating the sound to make the difference clearer."
Korean,34zt0s,lazyheroine,3,Thu May 7 03:47:59 2015 UTC,"I think what /u/lazyheroine is referring to is the sounds of ㅈ,ㄱ, and ㄷ are more like a hybrid sound in English. We don't have that sound exactly in a written form. (I'm sure there are words that have those sounds though.) So that's why you see ㄱ written as ""g"" sometimes and ""k"" in other cases.  I think the advice to overexaggerate would be helpful too. You can also take it to another level by listening to a standard, Korean news/tv for example, and repeat words from there and record it and try to make it match."
Korean,34zt0s,tttdph91,3,Thu May 7 13:47:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think this is a good explanation :)  /u/imbrad91's pronunciation very understandable and fundamentally good, though, which is why phrasing this comment was a little difficult!    I also like the suggestion of repeating sentences from TV/news and recording to match. TV/news is very clearly enunciated, sometimes overenunciated, which makes the openness of all the sounds easier to hear and imitate.  [edit] I relistened to one of the recordings, and another thing that might help is overenunciating vowels but underenunciating consonants during a couple practices. Even sounds like ㄸ in Korean blend into the softness of the language, even though it's a ""hard"" sound. (Wow this sentence makes no sense. Maybe like the difference between pronouncing 어-떤 and something like 엇떤-blended together and overemphasizing ㄸ)"
Korean,34zt0s,lazyheroine,2,Thu May 7 15:24:22 2015 UTC,Wow thanks for taking so much time to help ㅋㅋ   Yeah I should probably watch more Korean news since it is so clearly spoken..I kind of crutched myself into watching too much 비정상회담 and I think its hurt my pronounciation listening to foreigners speak Korean so much..  I understand what you are saying though :)
Korean,34zt0s,imbrad91,2,Thu May 7 15:52:17 2015 UTC,"I think what they may be referring to is what I think of as the ""after the dentist"" Korean pronunciation. Korean loosen up their jaw and lips a lot when they speak. Try doing everything the same but pretend you just got a few teeth pulled and your jaw is loose. That improved my pronunciation almost immediately when it came to my attention."
Korean,34zt0s,bigbirrrd,7,Thu May 14 00:05:13 2015 UTC,"So, I'm a beginner and read really slowly, and don't know what half this means. Is that still okay to post?"

Korean,34zt0s,my-little-buttercup,3,Thu May 7 02:20:40 2015 UTC,"There was nothing extremely noticeable, like this need to be fixed. It seems right now all you need is more practice! The pronunciation and tones will come with it!"
Korean,34zt0s,tttdph91,2,Thu May 7 13:40:32 2015 UTC,"I agree! Your vowel sounds and pronunciation over all is really good! Sometimes you seemed to have trouble with the 를 but when you said 사람들을 it sounded really good! I tend to think of the 를 sometimes like the ending of the word little. I'm american so my pronunciation makes that tt sound into a fast d sound like in ""ready."" So rather than thinking that you have to pronounce a fast L sound, just try saying a fast d instead. The tongue and mouth position are ALMOST identical. Anyway, hope this helps."
Korean,34zt0s,bigbirrrd,3,Thu May 14 00:09:24 2015 UTC,Yes. It is great to practice reading and hear your own pronunciation. Getting more input for a new languages helps your increase your output!

Korean,34zt0s,bigbirrrd,2,Wed May 6 06:33:26 2015 UTC,"Very very good! Speed is good and pronunciation is great imo. But critical feedback is the only way we learn, so here are my only critiques:   At about 26 seconds when you say 외국어등을 I think you should put a little space in between 어 and 등. So it'd be like 외국어 __ 등을 . I'm not sure if this is a rule or not, but I tend to hear it like that when people list things. Otherwise is starts to sound like one word to me.   The other tip I have is a general one. In English, we tend to use the front upper part of our mouth a lot in pronunciation, while Korean is mostly in the lower back of the mouth. We have a lot more consonant-bunching in English (FYI most consonant sounds are made by the tongue, teeth and jaw while vowels are usually in the throat area) and so as a results our mental focus is in the frontal area of the mouth. In Korean, since the consonant/ vowel balance is a lot closer to equal, I think this translates into a more relaxed jaw and lower back mouth focus. This is just my theory tho.. I'm no linguist. We gotta get u/kjoonlee in here to find out for sure.   Long story short, try dropping your jaw when you pronounce things, as if you just got some teeth pulled at the dentist and your jaw is numb. I think that might help a lot."

Korean,34zt0s,desperatechaos,2,Tue May 5 22:51:46 2015 UTC,"Hi :X    Good job! Just a few comments for the 1st one (didn't have time to make an exhaustive list, but these are some of the basic ones)    다양한 취미 생활을 - Enunciate vowels more. I think one of the other times that 다양한 came up, it sounded kind of like 다영한, btw. 찍는 - the ㅉ should be more aspirated. It sounded closer to ㅊ to me. 또 - same comment, more aspirated. This one sounded more like ㄷ to me. 풀고 - this ㅍ should be like p as in pool or pooh bear (?? why are these my two p sound examples I have no idea)    [edit] comments on 2nd one 스티브~~~! Make sure you say this in a Korean way. I know it's weird but even people who fluently speak English will make English words sound super Korean, because it disrupts the flow of the sentence. Example at 1:10ish where 다라 says 스티번 instead of ""Steven"" even though she has pretty great English. 처음 in the 2nd one (~00:07), it sounds a little like 저음 which could be misunderstood as a different word ㄷ/ㄸ - 처음에 한국에 왔을 때는 문화가 많이 달라서 불편한 점도  - The first 때 and 달라서 were good. 점도 was more like the ㄸ pronunciation. So be careful which sound you are making! I heard this in other sentences as well, but these sounds were all together so this was the best place to point it out. I feel like your mouth is able to make the sounds but you are sometimes confusing which one goes where, which is a great place to be. Making the sounds in general is difficult for English speakers. 많다 - Should sound kind of like 만-타 instead of the 다 sound"

Korean,34ygwc,madmads,2,Tue May 5 16:39:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think you'll find it hard to naturally get better at speaking if you both talk in Korean.  General proficiency, though, is another story, if you only plan to learn through that one method.    There will get to a point where conversation is pretty natural between you, and you won't get as much out of it. It doesn't take too long because you'll get used to each other; you'll sort of meet in the middle, with you getting better at conversing and her coming to know what level of speech works between you.  Moreover, you can't get fully proficient at a language only through casual conversation. If that's your goal, then that isn't something to worry about, but if a more thorough proficiency is what you want, you need to go to other sources. For example, when I went over to Seoul University for the 5th level foreigners' Korean class after 10 months of all-day learning Korean, they were much better at conversation and interaction than me, but if it came to like talking about a news topic (politics, science, tech, economics, crime, etc.), they couldn't do it while I could pretty handily, and that class had people who had lived in Korea 2-3 years at that point. Or another one, I have friends who know Japanese from living there and going out meeting friends, well enough they could speak only Japanese and live there, but they had to study to pass business exams, and again can't talk on upper level topics in Japanese.  You can mix it up with your SO, though, trying different methods, to still have time with her while getting better. For example, sometimes we'll read fiction to each other in our own native language and pause when the other person doesn't understand something to explain it (in our partner's native language).  We like that because fiction is naturally harder than sources like news articles, with tone and metaphor playing a larger role, neither of which you'll understand on your own very well until you're quite proficient (and still then it's hard). For me, I'm hearing the fiction with the tone, pausing, etc., as a real Korean reads it, being explained what I don't understand, and when I read English fiction, I get practice through explaining in Korean.    We also will watch tv shows in both language and discuss topics in them afterwards that we wouldn't otherwise discuss. This is more helpful with supported-opinion type speech than like vocabulary, but it has its purpose.  Hope that helps. Feel free to ask any other questions, and I'll try to answer them. FWIW I'm married to a Korean and live in the U.S. with her now. In a couple years, we're going to move to Korea together. She's an English teacher, so both of us are motivated to get better at our second language and help each other, so we're in a similar situation."

Some SOs will correct the mistakes your making, and some SOs will just get used to your mistakes and never correct them.    The best of language partners are the ones that act as 'language parents' and slowly correct all the mistakes or unnatural sentences over time.    The best experience though is when you spend time with your SO's korean friends, and she has to 'translate' from your korean to natural korean. You learn so much!"

Korean,34ygwc,itsbrb,1 point,Thu May 7 17:09:57 2015 UTC,"I have this situation too and there are a lot of factors that are important to acknowledge. Your patience with yourself and her patience with you. If you're low level, it's really annoying to try to have a relationship in Korean (relationships are already hard work). Like imagine trying to figure out where you left your phone in Korean in the heat of walking out the door in the morning. So I found that trying to speak in Korean with my wife was quite difficult when I was low level. So I got a language exchange partner.   However, later on as I started to improve as a result of my own studies, I realized the benefits. You both have a walking dictionary sitting next to you all the time. And when you're able to have basic conversations, you have someone to practice with and provide feedback at all times. This aspect is really helpful.   But again, it all comes down to patience. I would caution you not to think that once you have your life together that everything will get easier and that you will just absorb all her Korean. Still need to put in the work! Anyway, good luck to you friend."

Does she use Korean when you guys text/talk on the phone? If she does it's basically the same thing. Maybe you're listening skills will benefit if you don't talk on the phone much.
Korean,34ygwc,knudi,1 point,Tue May 5 17:41:05 2015 UTC,"If your Korean is better than her English and your language of communcation is Korean, then yes - it will be incredibly helpful; I have experienced this first hand.  If, on the other hand, your language of communication is mostly English, then it won't be that helpful. You might think that it would be helpful because you have a free Korean teacher constantly on tap, but the student-teacher relationship and boyfriend-girlfriend relationship are really two quite different things. I've seen quite a few cases of this where the English speaker's Korean has stagnated, and very few cases in which the English speaker's Korean has improved at a faster rate than one would otherwise expect."

The thing that makes it ""above you in the hierarchy"" is the 신 and calling the person 분.  To someone in the same level or lower, you could, for example, say: (이름)아, 너 정말 대단한 것 같아  or 너 정말 대단하다 or 너 정말 대단한 사람이다.

Example: Mid Jax... ㄷㄷ...  ㅂㄷㅂㄷ – 부들부들 which can be shivering for fright but in gaming it's more commonly used for being upset. So upset that you're shaking with rage.   Instead of taking a buff or killing creep camps they would say to eat it. So something like baron 먹고싶어요 is I want to eat (kill) baron.  You will see a lot of cursing too. Even though most of it is filtered.  ㅅㅂ = 씨발  ㅂㅅ = 병신  You see them try to type it out using similar sounding words or trying to put a symbol in between the blocks like 씨1발.  You could try asking Cowsep too. He can tell pretty well what people are saying and if they are flaming him or not.

Maybe their selection is different for people taking courses directly through their language department, but as a graduate student we had the option of taking Korean 1 (absolute beginner), Korean 2 (future tense, 모모 하고 있다, that kind of stuff), Korean 3 (하려면, ~을것 같다, giving directions), and ""Advanced Korean Reading.""   The Advanced Korean Reading class was an absurd jump from the previous level of Korean 3. Korean 3 was stuff I had learned before, so I signed up for the Advanced Korean Reading class, and on the first day of class we were given a sheet of paper that discussed the history of stereotypical occupations in Korea. It discussed economic concepts, WIG FACTORIES, and all sorts of other stuff. The level was absolutely insane, and there is no way that someone coming from Korean 3 would have any chance of succeeding the Reading class.   But all that being said, if they have a better selection for non-graduate students, maybe it's fine! Teachers weren't a problem in my experience, only the ridiculous lack of selection."

Korean,34wu72,Neivler,1 point,Thu May 7 06:23:47 2015 UTC,"I have done SNU summer 1 month class level 2 A (not B as B is for the normal second month you study). It was OK. Teachers are generally quite good.  Text book was not that good. Plan and progress setup was bad. As in unnecessary grammar (bad to focus on that when there are more wiser things to cover at that level) and no real plan behind it. Just a lot of random different grammar points. Currently at Sogang. I feel it is much better. I like the focus on speaking. Textbooks and progress plan is far superior. Instead of learning a lot of different grammar points halfway, you learn them good and they incorporate them into the next grammar points you learn. So you learn how to use both with each other. But then you learn less grammar over the course. I have friends who did higher level, just intermediate though. All say Sogang is better than what they have done before, especially SNU I can say with certainty.  Yonsei as well, but I can only speak for the lower levels. I do know that the US Embassy picks Sogang for their people and recommends it. Ewha seems good as well. I liked SNU, but it simply can't compare to my and others experience with Sogang.  SNU brings some prestige, but the administration there is horrible to deal with if you are not there in person or maybe calls. They do not respond in emails to me.  SNU does have good students though. People with good Korean and hardworking go there since they hope it can help them get into the regular uni (it won't) and is known as the best uni so people who don't know better chooses it.  I liked it and it was good, but there are better alternatives. At least for beginner and intermediate. Level 4 and up I can't say to much about."

As far as books, Seoul Natl just updated their books and I've heard good things about them. I've glanced at them and I was actually between their books and the Ehwa books for my self study, but I decided to use Ehwa because their books become all Korean starting at level 3.

Use this to buy and eat snacks, you say, 까까 being baby-talk for 과자. The amount of pocket money in this case is most definitely a lot more than the price of snacks though. Also, the higher the amount of pocket money, the more likely it is for the money to ultimately go into a parent's wallet instead of the kid's.

When you want to know ""should I use 에 or 에서 when I want to say 'in' (as in ""I'm studying in Korea"")"", to me the clearest explanation is ""if the only thing that the verb tells you that something exists (or does not exist) somewhere, you use 에, in all other cases 에서"".

The (*) at 살다 is because whether 에 or 에서 is right with 살다 depends on how the verb is used. I don't know of any other verbs that are like this, maybe someone can fill me in on that.  Also, once again   none-Korean speaker student carelessly uses this location/place particles.   is a bit ironic when loads (and I'd even say the majority) of Koreans don't know how to properly use 에/에서 with 살다 and always use 에서, in situations where it should be 에. I guess this is getting so common that at some point 국립국어원 might accept 에서 in those cases as well.. but that isn't the case yet."

I think it's pretty clear that this isn't such a situation, though. This is a small grammar point.    I guess the question is: how common is it, exactly?   Why is that the question? That question doesn't determine whether something makes you sound like someone speaking ""Academic Korean"" in a casual situation or makes you sound unnatural.  In my experience more than 50% of Koreans in their early 20's actually think that ~ㄹ 거에요 is the correct way for the future grammar pattern and not ~ㄹ 거예요 (I'm not talking about people writing it 거에요 out of laziness but people actually thinking it's correct). That doesn't mean writing 거예요 will make you sound unnatural or that it's a good idea."

Korean,34t75x,hiimbears,1 point,Tue May 5 05:50:11 2015 UTC,"I'd say ""connotation"" is part of ""how a verb is used"". That could well be me personally though, maybe to others it isn't.  But it says (I know it's very easy for you to understand the explanation at your level, but just for clarity)   따라 ‘신촌에 살다’는 사는 장소가 신촌이라는 뜻   '신촌에 살다' carries the meaning of ""신촌 is the place where [one] lives""   신촌에서 살다’는 ‘살다’라는 행동이 이루어지고 있는 곳이 신촌이라는 뜻을 나타냅니다.    As for '신촌에서 살다', it carries the meaning that 신촌 is the place where the actions that compose ""living"" take place.  While they're indeed very similar, I'd say that when you're simply asking where someone lives (for instance when meeting someone for the first time) and they respond in a way like ""I live in Seoul"", then it pretty much always is about the simpler first meaning.    Both 에 and 에서 are correct, and it does not depend on how the verb is being used.   I thought about it for a bit, and I'm pretty sure that the sentence  제가 대학생이었을때 신촌에 방탕하게 살았어요 is incorrect and has to be  제가 대학생이었을때 신촌에서 방탕하게 살았어요. By ""incorrect"" I mean that with what the speaker is trying to say (which is very clear from the context in this sentence), ""에서"" should be used.   The reason why I wrote it in the first place because I had a conversation with a native who majors in Korean on this exact topic, and this is pretty much what they said - though I'm not saying that they can't be wrong. Along with that, I feel that it just makes sense, along with the explanation linked from 국립국어원 and the general usage of 에/에서. When you say 살다, you can mean 거주하다 (which always takes 에), or you can mean something closer (though not equivalent) to 생활하다 (which always takes 에서). Yet in the convo ""Where do you live? I live in Seoul"", you're 99% of the time talking about the former."

An example would be me messaging my boss - 오늘 차가 막혀서 좀 늦을것 같네요, 양해를 구합니다.  I would use 해줘/해주세요 for friends/coworkers/family/etc.  One of the most common times you will hear the IMO is when TV/radio gets interrupted due to some outages, you will hear a voice saying 방송상태가 고르지 못한점에 양해를 구합니다/양해를 부탁합니다.

Bisu also has a cute face according to his female fans which did help his popularity outside of BW but I'd still say his fame is limited to people who followed the game at some point between 2007 and 2012. This goes for all the 택뱅리쌍, including Flash.  I'd say the most popular Korean progamers were before this time - most notably 임요환(Boxer) and 이윤열(Nada). The other progamers that played during their reign like 홍진호(yellow) are also arguably more known than 택뱅리쌍 due to bw being practically a national sport at this time (120k+ spectators in attendance at 광안리 beach in 2005).  Boxer, nada and yellow still show up as guests at variety shows and other things even though their progaming days are over.  The most popular progamer might actually not even be a Korean. He won the first and is still the only foreigner to ever win an OSL. That is sadly not why he is famous though. Guillaume Patry (기욤 패트리) became popular as a panelist on the talk show 비정상회담 (non-summit?). That is still on-going and is still quite popular. Although some might not know him by name, most certainly everyone who has seen 비정상회담 will know who he is.  I kind of went off on a tangent there but I hope that answers your question."

Korean,34oruz,Helikaon242,5,Sun May 3 03:48:09 2015 UTC,"I already wrote the TOPIK II in March, but I've never spoken to another test-taker so I was curious what other people think.  I totally agree about the 듣기 section. I've lived in Korea for a while so I think my 듣기 marks are probably higher than the other sections, but the questions near the end still felt very hard. A few of them were similar to the sort of speeches you'd see on the news or in congress. In those later questions, the speakers often sounded older and had a 말투 that I wasn't very accustomed to hearing.  쓰기 was hard. I will admit that writing is by far my weakest skill. My short question was to summarize the tourist situation in Korea and briefly talk about Korean pop-culture popularity overseas. The longer question was to discuss the responsibilities that private companies have to Korean society at large (think education, pensions, hospitals, etc.)  And again, I agree with your opinion for 읽기. I actually had a difficult time finishing in time because of the complex essay-type questions like you described. A friend recommended that if you read the first and last sentences of the paragraph, you can often discern the meaning much clearer. However, like you, I often didn't understand the more complex words and found myself guessing on a number of questions.  I also agree completely on your overall opinion of the test. Like you, I feel quite comfortable speaking in Korean, and I'm disappointed that the test doesn't really allow any opportunity to exhibit that. However, universities recommend you have 4급 for taking classes in Korean, and now that I've taken the exam I feel like the test okayish for measuring that.  I'm just curious, what was your goal while writing the test? Mine was level 4, but I think I may have gotten level 3."
Korean,34oruz,Mimmiron,4,Sun May 3 07:55:05 2015 UTC,"To follow classes in Korean at a university I'm pretty sure it's 5급 (that's true for 서강 and 홍익, maybe others have lower requirements).   I think the requirement matches what university classes need but the main issue is that while you (and me) feel relatively at ease speaking and learning pattern of speech, all this casual speech learning goes out the window for topik where 한자말 is king. My pet peeve was instead of 방송 you'll get 방영. Things like that and while 방영 is still close enough, I've never ever seen it.  And of course since the test runs from level three to six the last ten get quite ridiculous but that's understandable, it's suppose to show a formal proficiency I don't have by a long shot."

Korean,34mjn7,theghostofm,6,Mon May 4 01:54:31 2015 UTC,"It's not strictly associated with love, and euphoria is too strong a word. It's more like getting butterflies often in anticipation of something. You can be 설레이다 about the upcoming spring, starting school, or going on a trip. Of course, you can also be 설레이다 when you are with your crush."

Korean,34oc3y,Jinjuajaaja,7,Sun May 3 00:42:55 2015 UTC,"You're mistaken. ""Let's go"" and ""Don't go,"" for example, are different sentences. Also, some words might sound the same but mean different things- same as how in English, we have homophones like ""pear"" and ""pair"" (ignore the difference in spelling, because orthography is purely arbitrary).   Part what's got you thinking this way is that you're reading subs. If the translators translated everything exactly, a lot of nuance would be missing, so they translate to what sounds natural in English and fits the meaning and not 100% with the literal meaning. It all comes down to natural differences between the languages that makes translating tricky business.  Also, please please PLEASE don't rely on romanization. The roman alphabet doesn't properly represent the sounds in Korean, and while I understand what you were going for, ""cumawonidah"" is incorrect not only in terms of standard romanization, but also grammatically."
Korean,34oc3y,ScribbleBees,1 point,Sun May 3 00:52:01 2015 UTC,"I am so sorry..   I definitely haven't even began to learn yet, hence why i said purely out of curiosity. I want to finish my final exams and then give my undivided attention to the korean language. It's just i love how it sounds so much and I've learnt so many phrases from watching kdramas that i end up saying them when speaking with native speakers. Unfortunately I don't know Hangul yet so i try to spell the words how they sound when i hear them and of course i mostly get what? or Oh are you trying to say this? Like i have no idea how i would say arrrresto (okayI understand?) and crayyy (yes?? (so sorry))   But Thank you i understand what you're saying and it makes sense because at the end of an episode the next episode would have completely different phrasing for the same scene..   Gamsahanidah! _^"
Korean,34oc3y,iamkoalafied,5,Sun May 3 01:03:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you don't have to use romanization even if you can't read hangul yet. You could have just said ""thanks"" you know? And that's part of why trying to learn from just kdramas alone is going to lead you down the wrong path, because ""arrrresto"" and ""crayyyy"" are not that close to what you're looking for :P I saw a post the other day from a guy who ""learned Japanese"" from watching anime alone and he made similar mistakes. It's not a good idea!  It's super easy to get the basics of reading Korean down so that's a good place to start, if you're interested in learning :D"
Korean,34oc3y,k3g,4,Sun May 3 01:25:00 2015 UTC,"For future references incase you still haven't learnt how to read/write in Hangul yet.   감사합니다: Gamsahapnida(pronounced as hum)/gamsahamnida is closer to the actual word.   Also, 고마워: gomawo  고맙다: gomapda  고맙습니다: gomapseumnida"

Like i said all i know is from kdramas, i haven't began to learn the language but i will after may. I hope to teach English there by march. It's just i love the way it sounds and I am such a spontaneous person that i want to do something right away, i.e say little korean phrases. I event went to a korean restaurant to taste the food and say ajhumma and ajhussi but i was disappointed when i said ""an nyeong ha se yo"" and the waiter response with ""I am not Japanese"" lmao XD ... Not a single person there was Korean and there hardly any koreans in my university (All chinese and a handful of Japanese).   Anyway I digress HA SE YO!"
Korean,34oc3y,tkdjdgrl,0,Mon May 4 17:06:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah... I think you should hold off trying to use Korean til you've learnt at least how to say hi/bye/yes/no/thankyou/here/there/that/this.   As someone who's constantly been harassed by people asking me ""how do i say this, how do i say that in your language?"" only for them to half ass it to every Asian that they meet, it does seem kinda disrespectful to the language and the listener (even though it wasn't their intention).   Might just be me, but I hope you keep this in mind and hopefully you won't offend."
Korean,34oc3y,Trevarr,0,Mon May 4 19:10:03 2015 UTC,"Then you should speak to google and get them to change their translations because i said it how google spelled it, but i guess now I know better. And no i wont stop.  Bye!"

Korean,34oc3y,Trevarr,5,Sun May 3 03:20:25 2015 UTC,"""it seems in many ways  Hangul can be quite simple [...] For example certain words can mean both the same and opposite meanings?""   Hangul is an alphabet, Korean is a language.  Romanization is bad, but that doesn't matter since I don't think you're actually trying to learn the language.  The korean language works differently than English, so sometimes translators need to put full sentences instead of a word or two, or move them around in the subs (change the order), so that it makes sense, because like I said, they're different.  ""Cumawonidah"" isn't a thing in any language on this earth."

If you put ""떡 줄 사람은 생각도 않는데"", then there must be someone or an object such as company or group who will make the something happen for the listener. Does it make sense?

Korean,34d5kl,moxiesmiley,8,Thu Apr 30 04:49:49 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on what level your Korean is. If you're not close to fluent, it might not be helpful because you wouldn't be able to understand enough to even follow along. Also the words you'd learn from it are more related to gaming than regular speaking (announcer style), so I'm not sure if I'd recommend it. Just my thoughts on it."
Korean,34d5kl,Pikmeir,7,Thu Apr 30 05:14:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I did this for a while. Go listen to a sports caster in english, they sound nothing like how people sound in real life; the same thing applies to the SC2 casters. Its fun to watch it for sure but its really not that helpful."
Korean,34d5kl,ReMiiX,3,Thu Apr 30 05:45:25 2015 UTC,"I play Clash of Clans in a Korean clan and I think my reading speed may have doubled over the past 4 months from chatting in the clan chat. I didn't realize this was happening until I was reading over an article recently and realized that my eyes were finally moving close to the speed of my brain. (I'm gyopo and my reading speed has always been annoyingly slow). I use this to justify my addiction.  I dunno if watching a show would have effects on your learning, but you'll probably be able to hold a decent and in-depth convo about Starcraft and you might be able to use it to reinforce some sentence patterns that you learn in your studies. I guess a caveat is that games sometimes have specific gaming language and you might not realize that they're not commonly used words."
Korean,34d5kl,lazyheroine,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:29:54 2015 UTC,you'll learn a lot of sc2 vocabulary that's for sure. lol not sure if it will be helpful outside of it. i watch sc2 and league casting sometimes for the heck of it and it feels like i am a beginner again.
Korean,34d5kl,cptchi,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:49:53 2015 UTC,"I tried the same thing with Korean Pro-League of Legends. I found that if you don't know regular Korean decently, gaming Korean will be very difficult to follow. The announcers (dont know about SC2) also speak very fast during the games. However, the player interviews were helpful since they were usually at an understandable pace."
Korean,34d5kl,Elytas,1 point,Thu Apr 30 07:19:38 2015 UTC,"I tried doing this too. Most of what I can grasp is only in the player interviews or coach interviews with GyuRi. The actual casting talks wayy too fast for me. I would recommend the 10q10answers with sojung though.  They caption those in both korean and English and ive been able to understand a lot of what they say.  Canata also does a series called ""Calling""  i think is called. It's for Starleague and he calls players that are about to play,  he tries to get them to talk trash and ask them how they feel about their matches. It's really fun, also captioned,  and you get to know the players a little."

Korean,34d5kl,ChikNoods,1 point,Thu Apr 30 12:52:50 2015 UTC,Depends on your vocabulary knowledge. I'm a beginner so I don't know a lot. When I watch Korean hearthstone I'll miss out on most of what they are saying but I can still understand the game. When I hear a word being said a lot I write it down and look it up or ask a Korean friend what it means. It's a slow but enjoyable way to learn for me.

Korean,34b4t4,ilangshot,3,Wed Apr 29 19:13:04 2015 UTC,"All Korean consonants are unreleased at the end. 꽃 is pronounced 꽅 precisely because you shouldn't be releasing the sound, and the place your tongue goes to is identical for the two sounds.  Because of the lack of release, there is assimilation when nasals occur nearby. causing the consonants to take on a nasal quality. ㅁ is the same sound as ㅂ, except that your nasal cavity is open. English also has similar forms of assimilation in normal speech for many speakers (where the words, say, ""ten bikes"" is not any different from ""*tem bikes"" when spoken at normal speed, because our nasals move to the place of articulation for the next consonant) so this is not something you necessarily need to learn, though you should practice it. With proper pronunciation of everything, however, it will come naturally and will be ""hard"" to do the other way."

I was thinking something like it's taking the last moment of the day to reflect.  But I'm confused by the literal meaning of the last part ""11시 59분 동안 고마웠다고"" (maybe it is a poetic way of saying stuff that I'm not familiar with because I don't read many poems?) If 시 is supposed to refer to 시간/hours, then why only the last 11h 59 mins. If it means 시 like telling time, then 동안 doesn't make sense to me."
Korean,34bcvp,lazyheroine,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:09:34 2015 UTC,"too deep for me  I posted the last part 11시 59분 동안 고마웠다고 to a native and they told me it was more or less just ""thanking someone for their time"" I was confused if the statement literally meant thanks during the last 11 hours and 59 minutes of that day, or just during that 1 minute period of ""11:59"".    Anyways, the part i dont really get about it is why they are saying to bid farewell to ""1 minute"".  is it a play on words with the honorific ""분"" for person? so bidding farewell to one person but using time as like an analogy.  idk, just a guess"
Korean,34bcvp,imbrad91,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:38:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean I'm a fluent gyopo and my husband is Korean and neither of us have any idea what that last sentence is supposed to mean.   I feeeeel like it's a typo and it's supposed to say 11시간 because 동안 is always used with a time frame (ie 5s, 10s, 5 mins, etc), not with a time of day (like noon, 2:35 AM, etc).  But then the figurative translation doesn't really make sense if it's supposed to be 11시 59분 동안.   The first half could be a play on words with 1분에게 meaning to one person, but the 2nd half doesn't make sense with it.  I dunno, maybe it is like a tumblr nonsense quote to me. Or it might be some sort of slang that neither of us know cuz we're untrendy."
Korean,34bcvp,lazyheroine,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:12:09 2015 UTC,"I think the thanking someone is a bit literal; it's more towards being thankful for the day/time you spent.

Korean,34bcvp,tawmc4t,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:56:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know. The thanking someone point was a direct response to /u/imbrad91's comment wondering if 분 could be a play on words.  But like I was saying before, 11시 59분 doesn't mean 11 hours and 59 minutes, it means 11:59."
Korean,34bcvp,lazyheroine,0,Thu Apr 30 04:02:50 2015 UTC,"because 동안 is always used with a time frame    Yes, it means a time frame here too so I don't think it's a typo but rather figuratively  11 hours and 59 minutes = the whole day, not just 12 hours."

Korean,34cua6,rgr555,28,Thu Apr 30 03:04:48 2015 UTC,"Hey rgr555,  First off, changing these ""phrases"" from romanized Korean to Hangul should be top priority for a new learner.  ""sip sum ni da"" = -싶습니다  ""si po yo"" = -싶어요  Both of these are formal forms of the grammar form ""- want to"". The former, 싶습니다, is from the -ㅂ니다 formality form, which, while common in beginner learning, is probably one of the least common ways you'll hear it used in conversation. The latter, 싶어요, is more common and comes from the 존댓말 formality form, which is slightly less formal, but still formal enough to be used with people of all ages. You'll hear this significantly more often, and as long as your other sentences are using ""요"" endings, you should stick to this one probably.  저는 가고 싶습니다 - I want to go.  저는 가고 싶어요 - I want to go.   In conclusion, they're both ""correct"", but the latter is much more common in conversation. For further reading on formality, follow this link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_speech_levels (Higher level vs middle level)  edits: Fixing reddit formatting."

Korean,34a0mx,theghostofm,7,Wed Apr 29 16:19:05 2015 UTC,"At the beginning of a syllable (the onset) it is silent and at the end (the coda) it makes the nasal [-ng] sound we associate with the letters ng in English.   Sounds like you need a better foundation for Hangul. Go back and learn it and practice it more, it gets easier!  I would recommend an app called PopPoppingKorean for learning Hangul, I found it really helpful."
Korean,34a0mx,nolenole,5,Wed Apr 29 14:20:57 2015 UTC,"An interesting note: originally two ㅇs were different. The onset (choseong) ㅇ was ㅇ (null), but the coda (jongseong) ㅇ was ㆁ (to write [-ng]).

Korean,34a0mx,JiminP,5,Wed Apr 29 14:37:04 2015 UTC,"Continuing on this point, I think a lot of first time second-language learners need to understand this:  Languages exist, then writing systems are invented after the fact, over top of it.  Korean as a language allows vowels to start a word, but the writing system that was developed doesn't allow for a vowel character to be written alone. So there's a consonant character that doesn't have an associated sound that is used. And then over time this character merged with another, as JiminP here stated.  But a big jump for many learners is that the default ""form"" of the language is the spoken part. Going from written to spoken is going to cause some weird problems."

But another comment mentioned that you can only use the plain form with descriptive verbs (i.e. adjectives like 예쁘다 or 맜있다) while for active verbs like 먹다 you must add ㄴ or 는, (ex. 지금 햄버거를 먹는다).  Can anyone give more info or details on the descriptive vs active verbs difference?"
Korean,349jar,secondaccountforme,2,Wed Apr 29 15:08:02 2015 UTC,"Descriptive verbs don't need ㄴ/는, action verbs do.   That's pretty much it.   Knowing plain form is important for indirect quoting.   And like I said before, the plain form and the dictionary from are not the same thing."
Korean,349jar,anders_,3,Wed Apr 29 15:18:57 2015 UTC,"The form you're referring to is the speech level called 해라체. From Korean: a comprehensive grammar by Jaehoon Yeon & Lucien Brown:   The plain style has two distinct usages. First, it is used when writing to a general audience in newspapers, textbooks, written announcements, etc., as a matter-of-fact and neutral style. Second, it is used in non-honorific speech when addressing intimates of similar or younger age, usually mixed with the intimate style [해체].  Although the intimate and the plain are often mixed in colloquial speech, their usages are not identical. First, the plain style is oftem felt to be ‘lower’ than the intimate, particularly in questions and orders. Thus, repeated use of the plain tends to be more appropriate in cases where the speaker is considerably older than the hearer (such as a father addressing his son). The plain may also be applied when the speaker intentionally wants his/her speech to sound colder.   The form of the 해라체's indicative is -다 for stative verbs only, and -ㄴ다 for non-stative. So it would indeed be 예쁘다, but 가다 > 간다.  For completeness, the 해라체's imperative is -어라/아라¹, the interrogative is -(으)냐 (stative) or -느냐 (non-stative)², and the hortative -자.  In places where the indicative you'd use is -어요/아요, the imperative (as well as the interrogative and hortative) is the same. This applies to -아/어 as well (which, therefore, is the 해체 mentioned above).  ¹ The names 해라체, 해체, etc., are in fact named after the imperative form of 하다 in that style. The ㅏ > ㅐ part is just because 하다 is irregular. ² Colloquially, they can both be -냐, or even -니."

Looks like I have some reading to do on stative and non-stative verbs.   The difference between adjectives in English, where we just toss 'to be' in front (to be beautiful), and Korean adjectives that are almost treated as verbs (예쁘다) has been one of my favourite things about the language so far."
Korean,349jar,yehet94,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:17:12 2015 UTC,"The stative/active (don't know why I couldn't think of that word before :p) distinction is almost in line with the adjective/non-adjective line, as you probably surmised. The only (half?-)exception I can think of offhand is 있다, which counts as stative in the meaning ‘to exist’, but active when it’s ‘to be at a location [etc.]’.  Another place the S/A distinction crops up is with the progressive form using 있다 as an auxiliary: if the main verb is active it takes -고 as a suffix, and if stative it takes -아/어."

And yea, these differences (ㄱ, ㄲ, ㅋ etc) are really quite difficult , to begin with, just try to make sure you understand the differences and be aware of them, but don't worry too much if you don't say it right every time."

I think the idea is that hearing the bad news causes them ""distress"". So it's not really an apology, but a statement about the speakers feelings.  I'm sorry to hear that. = I feel sorrow because of this.   So it's just a way to express sympathy for another person."

Korean,344j1e,froggyeatfrog,3,Tue Apr 28 06:12:11 2015 UTC,For a period of 6 months I can recommend level 5 and 6 at Yonsei. Assuming you know all the grammar already you'll be able to focus 100% on soaking up all the vocab. With the elective hanja classes you'll also be able to pick up 200-250 hanja letting you deduce the meaning of new words quite easily. In level 5 alone I filled my anki deck with more than 2500 new words.
Korean,344j1e,knudi,2,Tue Apr 28 08:02:23 2015 UTC,"Do you use commercially available textbooks at Yonsei or were they special books for just the language program? I'm trying to work on my hanja in self study, but I'm not sure what the best resources would be for this."
Korean,344j1e,lazyheroine,3,Tue Apr 28 15:01:04 2015 UTC,Their books are commercially available (see http://www.yskli.com/_en/pr/book.asp) though a little tricky to get in the USA.
Korean,344j1e,feedmefeces,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:07:30 2015 UTC,"Ooh, thanks! I can probably figure out a way to pick some up next time I'm in Korea. It's hard to find good materials in the US :)"
Korean,344j1e,lazyheroine,2,Tue Apr 28 15:17:46 2015 UTC,"You can find them at the big Kyobo in Gwanghwamun, for example. Also, if you actually go to the KLI at Yonsei, you can buy them in the basement for a small discount, if I remember."
Korean,344j1e,feedmefeces,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:08:07 2015 UTC,Yep. Or the Yonsei main bookstore sells them as well. I'm not sure how often the basement KLI sale is available...?!
Korean,344j1e,feedmefeces,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:52:57 2015 UTC,"I thought the sale was constant, though maybe I am misremembering."
Korean,344j1e,knudi,2,Tue Apr 28 23:39:47 2015 UTC,"Most language programs use their own textbooks written specifically for the course. This includes elective classes like the hanja ones, though you should realize a hanja-book is often kind of like a drawing book. You might as well buy a book with blank pages and follow a hanja course online. Hanja is divided into levels 8 to 1* with level 8 being the easiest. I'd recommend starting with a smartphone app like 한자공부Q and just memorizing meaning, pronunciation and strokes."
Korean,344j1e,lazyheroine,1 point,Wed Apr 29 06:56:53 2015 UTC,Oh that is a good point. I haven't taken a standalone hanja course before so I totally forgot this is a thing. Online and app sound like great options thanks!!

Korean,344rr1,alaksh,1 point,Tue Apr 28 11:39:03 2015 UTC,"semper   For anyone who is curious about how to import from Anki into Semper, here are the steps:  1.) In Anki, export your desired deck. Uncheck include media and anything else special. We want to export as simple of data as possible.  2.) Step one should have created a text file in your directory of choice. Go to excel, data tab, then ""from text""  3.) When importing your data, choose the delimited options. These should be default, so you don't really need to do anything here except click next next next.  4.) Depending on the type of cards you used in anki and how detailed your card's front / back sides are, you are going to have to delete some html. Just use find and replace for each piece of html you find and replace each piece of html with a space. For example, you would find and replace ""<br>"" with "" "".  5.) Copy and paste into the semper website.  With regards to step 4, I'm sure there is an easier way. I have heard of html strippers, but my cards only had about 4 pieces of html, so it was faster (probably) to just use find and replace.  Good luck!"

Korean,341f2e,joeyhemlock,8,Mon Apr 27 15:31:01 2015 UTC,"Letter abbreviations don't fly in Korean, so instead of ""P."", I used ""Purvis"".

Roscoe Purvis Coltraine     But this is also a play on a Korean commercial for a lotion called ""Skin Food"" that contained apples, cucumbers, etc. as ingredients.  The slogan was ""먹지마세요, 피부에 양보하세요."", which means ""Please don't eat.  Use it on your skin.""  However you translate it, I think you risk the chance of a Korean seeing it and being offended, since dog-eating in Korea can be a sensitive topic.  But who knows--I could be wrong on this issue.    If you're trying to do a South-Korean style poster, here are some examples to follow.  Note that the name (the big 3-character word) shows up in big print at the bottom, and there's usually a big number to indicate what number the candidate is on the ballot.  If you're trying to do a North-Korean style poster, I don't think campaign posters are used, since there's only one name on the ballot for all elections.  The closest thing I could find was this kind of thing, urging everyone to vote on election day."
Korean,341qfb,deoxix,7,Mon Apr 27 16:54:23 2015 UTC,"물을 있어요 is incorrect. 있다 is an intransitive verb, and therefore does not take an object.  물이 있어요 is exactly the same as 물 있어요. The 이 particle is often omitted.  Context surrounding the sentence is what gives it meanings such as ""I have water,"" or ""There is water."" However, if you don't have context (or don't want to provide context), you can also be more specific by saying something such as...   저는 물(이) 있어요 => I have water. 저에게(는) 물(이) 있어요 => I have water. 저기에(는) 물(이) 있어요 => There is water over there.

Korean,341qfb,theghostofm,2,Mon Apr 27 16:59:42 2015 UTC,"Wow, didn't know it at all. I assumed it was transitive because in english ""to have"" needs always an object.   I was saying that 은/는 doesn't give any information to distinguish between the phrases so it's ambiguous in that way."
Korean,341qfb,MotoHD,5,Mon Apr 27 18:30:06 2015 UTC,"That's a really common mistake a lot of people make. It's because 있다/없다 don't actually mean ""to have"" or ""to not have"", but rather ""to exist"" and ""to not exist"".   A person can't exist water. Water just exists. So while ""저는 물이 있어요"" is translated to and has the meaning of ""I have water"" it would literally mean ""As for me, water exists"""
Korean,341qfb,MotoHD,3,Mon Apr 27 18:50:28 2015 UTC,"That's interesting to know. So, ""물이 있어요"" literally means ""As for (the person who you're talking about), water exists (in a possessive sense in this case).""  No doubt why they call korean a very contextual language."

Korean,33x7h5,teadrinkit,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:15:32 2015 UTC,I've noticed that sometimes verbs are conjugated with 고 at the end but I don't understand how it is different. Could you maybe explain a bit? Thanks!
Korean,33x7h5,please_leave_soon,3,Sun Apr 26 20:47:41 2015 UTC,"From how I understand it, it's a form of ""after""  Ex. Blahblah고, muhmuh. After Blahblah, muhmuh. 자고, 밥 먹자 is basically ""After sleeping, let's eat food."""

Korean,33x7h5,please_leave_soon,4,Sun Apr 26 20:54:17 2015 UTC,고 following a verb is the same as 그리고 meaning 'and' or 'and then...'  in this case it means 잘 well 보고 see (saw) and then 가 go (went).  라면 먹고 갈래? Do you want to go and eat ramyeon? (used by females to males meaning that they wanna go back to your place for sexy time)

Korean,33x7h5,jamesdakrn,1 point,Mon Apr 27 08:21:28 2015 UTC,"There's not going to be exact 1:1 translations for anything from English to Korean either, or vice versa, because the languages work differently. But that's not to say that they can't be translated, or that there are things that are untranslatable, or that they can't be translated well."
Korean,33x7h5,Pikmeir,1 point,Mon Apr 27 09:35:53 2015 UTC,"there're a lot of 1:1 things. How ""like"" and ""좋아하다"" are used both for generally liking something and when expressing a love interest. How many ""_하다"" verbs are basically saying ""to do _"". (IE: My Korean friend understood what ""to do your hair"" meant when I said ""머리가라하다."")"
Korean,33x7h5,ADSRelease,1 point,Mon Apr 27 10:59:19 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't really call them 1:1 though. For example 좋아하다 can translate well to ""like,"" but so can 좋다. I guess by 1:1 I mean an exact translation that can fit in every situation it would in the other language. So actually, ""like"" wouldn't work either since English has other uses for ""like"" besides just the meaning in 좋아하다 - ""such as,"" and ""in a similar way as"" are two more meanings of ""like"" in English. edit: as for 하다, it doesn't translate to ""to do"" most of the time. For example, 좋아하다 isn't ""to do"" something, and any descriptive verb ending in 하다 also won't translate as ""to do."" Some action verbs ending in 하다 might translate to ""to do,"" but even simple ones like 공부하다 (""to study"") would translate better in other ways than ""to do."" Sorry I'm just trying to say that since Korean and English are different languages, there aren't going to be 1:1 translations either way. This isn't a response to you so much as it's a response to people who say that Korean has special words that can't be translated to English - because there are no such words - but there are plenty of words without 1:1 translations either way, simply due to the languages being different and unrelated to the culture."
Korean,33x7h5,Pikmeir,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:27:33 2015 UTC,"Well not even English dictionaries say one word is the embodiment of all its definitions. To like and being like are not the same word even in English. You're defining these terms in a way clearly different than how most people use them. 1:1 tends mean the literal and figurative meanings transfer over, which there are many things that do. Some words definitely don't translate fully because they're so tied to a unique part of Korean psychology or culture. Such as their word for fatigue, as it's more than fatigue but respected the same as a disease or virus."

We would just say ""goodbye"" over saying ""I ate well and now I'm going!"" haha   Same with when you leave a place where other people are:  다녀오겠습니다. Literally: I'll come back.

Korean,33uq7e,desperatechaos,9,Sat Apr 25 20:31:35 2015 UTC,"Hi! Native/gyopo here. Korean was my first language but I grew up in the US. I recorded so that you guys can have someone for comparison! I probably won't have time to comment on many this week, unfortunately.  I do tend to overenunciate some things (weird habit I picked up when I was working to improve my spelling) but you can get a good idea of sentence flow and vocal inflections that sound ""natural"". Also, keep in mind that a lot of the weird 받침 are going to vary from speaker to speaker. Yes, there's technically a ""correct"" way to say them, but the average Korean person doesn't enunciate like a TV announcer.  Actually, there's a couple words that when news announcers say them, they sound completely weird and very few native speakers pronounce correctly. For example, 맛있다 should technically be pronounced 마딛따, but if you said that out loud, people would probably correct you. Instead, most people will say 마씨따.  I split it into parts so that if you wanted to compare certain parts, you don't have to listen to the whole thing.    아름다운 우리 학교 저는 한국에 온 지 두 달 됐습니다. 제가 다니는 학교는 한국에서 유명한 대학교 중의 하나입니다. 우리 학교는 역사가 오래됐습니다. 그리고 캠퍼스도 넓고 아름답습니다. 학교 안에는 도서관과 학생회관과 병원이 있습니다. 도서관에는 컴퓨터실과 멀티미디어실이 있고 학생회관에는 식당과 은행, 음악감상실, 건강센터가 있습니다. 모두 가까이 있어서 이용하기가 편리합니다. - whyyy are there so many things in this school lol. I kind of sped through 음악감상실 because I was running out of breath, but hopefully the word is still clear 제가 한국말을 배우는 한국어학당에는 | 여러 나라에서 온 학생들이 많아서 | 다양한 친구들을 만날 수 있습니다. - this sentence is difficult because of the lonnng clauses. it sounds odd if you pause in the middle but it's kind of a lot of words. I put ""|"" between the clauses in the first sentence. Try to follow the pauses there, or else the meaning of the sentence is harder to understand. 저는 평일에 오전 9시부터 오후 1시까지 수업이 있습니다. 수업이 끝난 후에 저는 친구와 점심을 먹고 자주 컴퓨터실에 가서 인터넷을 합니다. 주말에는 학교 운동장에서 친구들과 같이 축구나 농구를 합니다.   한국어학당에 있으면 여러 나라를 여행하는 것 같습니다. 저는 날마다 넓고 큰 세계를 만납니다.   Feel free to reply, tag, or pm with questions :)  [edit] I now think 한국어학당 should probably be said without any emphasis on any syllable and with no pauses in the middle of the word. See link for description. [edit 2] Yay, I'm doing a million edits again. Here's the difference between the 3 versions 한국어|학당, 한국|어학당, 한국어학당 in case this is confusing :)"

Korean,33uq7e,lazyheroine,4,Sun Apr 26 03:17:41 2015 UTC,"Hi! Great job! Quick comments:    저는 - softer j sound here  한국에서 - watch out for the 서, you aspirated a bit and it sounded like 써 중 - long oo sound (it sounded like 종 or 정) 캠퍼스도 - agree with /u/desperatechaos here, make sure you're saying the ㅐ sound, it sounded more like compass than campus.  (btw, /u/desperatechaos, you have a typo in your comment, should be ㅋ, not ㄱ) 넓고 - pronounced ""널꼬"", rather than ""넙고"" 도서관과 학생회관과 - should be like g when it's the conjunction 과 but I'm not sure how to explain why. like 과 as in 과일. Maybe ㄴ and ㄹ are softer? 병원 - open up on the 원 sound more 컴퓨터실 - should be more of the open come sound for 컴 건강센터 - watch to not aspirate the ㄱ, should be soft g sound here 이용 - elongate the 용 sound, like saying the word 요 but ㅇ-ing the end (lol I am so great with words... not) 한국어학당 - Same comment as I gave for another user: I might be saying this weird but I think it should be 한국|어학당, instead of 한국어|학당. To my knowledge, the word is 어학당 (feel free to correct me if you disagree. I haven't heard this word recently, just 어학연수생 and other variations) 친구 - elongate 우 sound in 구 오전 - softer j sound on 전. also, make sure you're saying the correct vowel! 가서 - don't aspirate the ㅅ sound    [edit] I think I've changed my stance on 한국어학당, read here for more info"
Korean,33uq7e,bigbirrrd,2,Mon Apr 27 19:03:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thanks for making that thread last week! It was a great idea. Here are some of my thoughts as a fellow 초보.  It seems like you mispronounced 갬퍼스 as 검퍼스.  When you say 도서관과 학생회관과, I think you should tense the ㄱ sound in 과 so it sounds more like ㄲ , since it's immediately preceded by a consonant (ㄴ).  You said 9시 as 구시, but it should be 아홉시. But I think you already realized this.  ""컴퓨터실에 가서 인터넷을 합니다"": here you pronounced 가서 more like 카서, so watch out for that aspiration. 인터넷을 also sounded more like 인터넷으로 to me.  화이팅!"
Korean,33uq7e,typecfl,2,Sun Apr 26 04:03:31 2015 UTC,"Hmm, so I feel like 과 sound natural as 과, not 꽈, but I'm not sure what the exact rule is. If you say 책과, 꽈 is correct but with ㄴ and ㄹ, 꽈 sounds weird to me."
Korean,33uq7e,lazyheroine,2,Mon Apr 27 19:08:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other feedback for you here! One more thing I noticed (because I struggled a lot with this too) is the 어 sound. The best way I can describe it is: It is like ""call"" in American accent English, and falls directly in the middle of 오 and 아. So if you start saying 오~~~~~ then gradually transition into making the 아 sound, about halfway through you will make the correct 어 sound. Let me know if that helps. I'll try to post a little clip illustrating what I mean.   Edit: http://vocaroo.com/i/s0mf6ld0Cpv4 (While listening, imagine how ridiculous I looked while recording this)."

Korean,33uq7e,lazyheroine,3,Sun Apr 26 07:44:41 2015 UTC,"Hi again! Very nice, as usual. I'm going to be unnecessarily nitpicky, because overall you sound much like a native speaker to my ears, in terms of pronunciation.    유명한 대학교 중의 하나입니다 - the 중 sounded more like a t for some reason here, but it might be your audio quality, it sounded like it skipped 역사가 오래됐습니다 - the pausing here made it more like 역사 가오래 됐습니다, make sure you pause after 가 한국어학당 - I might be saying this weird but I think it should be 한국|어학당, instead of 한국어|학당. To my knowledge, the word is 어학당 (feel free to correct me if you disagree. I haven't heard this word recently, just 어학연수생 and other variations) 여러 나라에서 온 - don't pause after 서, it should sound like 여러-나라에서온, else it sounds like you're saying the word 온 (all, such as 온 나라) rather than the gerund (?) form of 오다 축구나 - this is probably the only true ""pronunciation"" note I have for you! emphasize the ㅊ sound a little more, I thought it sounded like 죽구나 (which is very 자닌해)"
Korean,33uq7e,bigbirrrd,3,Mon Apr 27 18:20:55 2015 UTC,"My audio quality ㅠㅠ haha last week I tried uploading an audio file I recorded from my phone but there was an error, so I just used the crappy recording from my laptop. And I like nitpicky critiques, because I know I have a lot to improve, and it's honestly difficult to know where I need to improve if no one corrects me. Ah, the limits of self-studying...  Oh, and I honestly thought it was 한국어 학당! OTL I didn't even know the term 어학당--I just remembered reading somewhere that 학당 was an old term for 학교 and went with it. I'll keep that word in mind!  Haha I think the difference between ㅈ and ㅊ is one of the more difficult things to grasp in Korean--well, among a ton of difficult pronunciation rules in this language! It makes it very challenging and I like challenges!  Thanks again for the comment! You're awesome for helping learners like us. :)"
Korean,33uq7e,typecfl,3,Tue Apr 28 01:05:45 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! ㅈ is usually more j, ㅊ is usually ch, so try over-enunciating for a while until it feels natural! I feel like you'll get it very quickly.   BTW, I was discussing w/ my husband (who is totally Korean) and we concluded that the best term would be 한국어학당 with no pauses anywhere. It's kind of a weird word that neither of us use but that probably makes the most sense to read it that way, given the 띄어쓰기.     Reasoning: 한국어 학당 makes sense as a phrase, but 학당 by itself isn't used very often in modern Korean 한국 어학당, which is the way I naturally said it, makes sense, but it means ""language school in Korea"" and doesn't specify Korean language, so it's not very precise to say it like this or it could also mean ""Korea language school"", where Korea is the name of the school.    Sooo that turned out to be an interesting illustration of why spacing/pausing and emphasis/inflections in Korean are important, haha.    Tl;dr all 3 possible ways of saying this word make sense, someone who went to 언대 한국어학당 should confirm, lol."

Anyway, the only things that stuck out to me were some vowels. Every vowel in Korean is basically one, unchanging (think freeze tag) mouth position. So it's kind of like pop-lock style dancing with your mouth. In the beginning, when you said 두 달 and 우리 학교는 I felt like your mouth was sort of waltzing through the vowel sounds instead of doing the robot. Haha I honestly don't know how to explain this in any other way. So when you say 오 make the O shape with your mouth. Same with 우, just more narrow. Let me know if this is thoroughly confusing, haha I'm sorry."

Korean,33uq7e,lazyheroine,3,Sun Apr 26 03:55:58 2015 UTC,"Hallo! Good job! :) Overall, make sure you are enunciating more with each sound. I think a couple of the words were blending a little, which made the pronunciation unclear in some parts.    Here are a couple more specific comments: 학교 - try to make it more of a softer g sound (yours sounded between ㄱ and ㄲ to me) 두 달 - vowel sound on 달 was more 댤 here! 제가, 중의 - use a softer j sound here. sometimes sounded a little ㅊ 도서관 - make sure that you're using the softer d sound on this word The Korean English words (캠퍼스, 멀티미디어) - make sure you're enunciating each syllable on these words and try to avoid falling into the trap of pronouncing them like in English 있어서, 많아서 enunciate more. I think it sounded a little like 있었어, which hasa different meaning 편리 - should be 펼리. your pronunciation was very close, but try to keep the first and second syllable from blending together"
Korean,33uq7e,imbrad91,2,Mon Apr 27 16:52:28 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for the feedback!   Can you explain the difference in pronunciation between 있어서 and 있었어? Is it just the tensification of ㅆ vs ㅅ?"
Korean,33uq7e,hatbeat,3,Mon Apr 27 17:05:34 2015 UTC,"No prob :) I have vocaroo open so I'll just record the difference cuz I'm not sure how to verbally explain! I yes, the ㅆ vs ㅅ is the main difference, but the second part of 있어서 (pronunciation 이써서) is more open/long.    있어서 - http://vocaroo.com/i/s0NnyGxshRib 있었어 - http://vocaroo.com/i/s1FUcbrUC1GS"

Korean,33uq7e,cptchi,3,Tue Apr 28 01:45:26 2015 UTC,"Yay, good job! Esp on the overall pace and tone of the sentences, it sounds very natural. Here are some comments:    저는 한국에 온 지 두 달 됐습니다 - Make the ㅈ sound softer here! It was bordering on ㅊ 하나입니다 - make sure you fully pronounce the 나 sound before you move on to 입니다 넓고 - should be ""널꼬"" (it will be easier to say this way, too!). The 2nd 넓고 sounded good though! 학교, 학생 - I think you might be slightly overemphasizing the ㅎ in 학 in most of the words through the text. It might sound this way because of volume or a slightly higher pitch... I can't quite put my finger on what's making it sound this way to me 병원 - second sound should be like English word one. It sounded like 완 은행 - pronounce the ㄴ a little more 컴퓨터 - to make this sound more ""Korean"", elongate the 퓨 sound a tiny bit more to make the pace more even  인터넷 - emphasize ㅌ sound (it sounded slightly like ㄷ) 친구들과 - should be 과, not 꽈 because the soft ㄹ sound before it    BTW, ""오전 9시부터 오후 1시까지"" was perfect. It sounded like I was watching the news, haha."
Korean,33uq7e,lazyheroine,2,Tue Apr 28 16:29:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you so so so so so much for the feedback. I listened back and noticed the things you mentioned. This was so helpful for me.

Korean,33uq7e,Donnielover,2,Sun Apr 26 04:11:45 2015 UTC,"Really really good pronunciation! Your intontation is very natural. I can tell you've practiced a lot!   One thing: Try loosening up your jaw a bit when you speak Korean. If pronunciation were the olympics, I feel like English would be the parallel bars while Korean would be the floor routine. English is mostly in the upper front of the mouth and Korean is mostly in the lower back of the mouth.   If this helps, this is the way I remembered it. I used to pretend that I just left the dentist and my whole jaw was numb. Then I tried talking. My pronunciation instantly sounded much more natural. (Side note: I've noticed a lot of Korean people have really dry lips - TOTALLY speculation but this could be because they mouth is left open more...... No just me? Alright.. I'll see myself out)."
Korean,33uq7e,Donnielover,3,Tue Apr 28 01:09:37 2015 UTC,if we could make this a weekly thing i think it would be great!! i love hearing everyone's audios and actually forcing myself into reading more than 2 sentences out loud. haha   http://vocaroo.com/i/s1F9y5NWo03e here's mine T_T i was too focused trying to make it flow correctly that i pronounced 꿑난  and other abominations LOL
Korean,33uq7e,lazyheroine,2,Sat Apr 25 22:21:36 2015 UTC,"Hi! :) Great job!  The flow on this was def hard, even for me as a fluent speaker because there were SOOO MANY WORDS. I felt out of breath the entire time because of all the long clauses. I think the flow on your recording is very good and sounds natural with good pause breaks overall.    One comment in tone, I'd say that you tend to inflect. So try to be flatter (if that makes sense), especially within words? Specific example: 건강센터 - I would pronounce this very flat, 건-강-센-터, same ""note"" on each syllable. Your intonation here was more like 건 강센테, with more of an emphasis on the first sound.  Comments: 저는 - Make more like a j-as-in-jello j sound, and overall softer. I think you tend to pronounce ㅈ as a cross between ㅈ and the aspirated ㅊ 두 달 됐습니다 - Softer d sound. For the ㄷ sounds here, similar English sounds are do/due (first one) and Dwayne (2nd and 3rd) 학교 - I think sometimes you pronounced this 하꼬 (correct), and sometimes it sounded more like 하교 or 하쿄. Make sure you pronounce both ㄱ sounds and don't blend them together! 캠퍼스 - to make this English word sound more Korean (weird goal, I know haha), elongate the 스 sound more 도서관  - same comment as above, should be somewhat similar to the English sound play-doh. Your pronunciation in ""도서관에는 컴퓨터실"" was good. 은행 - sounded like 응행, but it might have just been because of the long string of words! 가까이 - the first ㄱ sound is more g. the second ㄲ sound was very good though!  ga-까이, rather than ka-까이 만날 수 있습니다, 만납니다 - I think I didn't hear the bottom ㄴ on 만날. It should sound distinct from the ㄴ in 날, so you're pronouncing it twice. Pronounce 만날 instead of 마-날.  끝난 - Make sure you're making the hard ㄲ sound!"

Korean,33uq7e,lazyheroine,2,Sat Apr 25 22:51:18 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you're okay with a beginner critiquing you, but here are some things I personally heard!  You seem to be pronouncing the ㄲ more like a ㄱ in both 가까이 and 까지. I'd say to tense your glottis a little more.  You seem to have mispronounced 한국어학당 as 한국어학댕, but I'm sure that was just a mistake, especially since you got it right the second time.  When you say 끝난, I think it should be pronounced [끈난] due to consonant assimilation.  Overall, nice job! I like how you take your time to read things at your own pace and speak pretty clearly. If this was your first and only take it's pretty damn good--I had to do like three takes."

It has tons of samples of native handwriting that you might be interested in checking out.  It really helped me with reading tricky fonts and developing more natural handwriting!
Korean,33si18,Breadincaptivity,3,Sun Apr 26 04:22:18 2015 UTC,"Not strictly related but I'm really curious, how bad is mine? http://imgur.com/ZmghhuQ"
Korean,33si18,luciecrystal,2,Mon Apr 27 15:07:42 2015 UTC,"I could read it just fine, even if I couldn't understand all of the words because I am still a beginner. It looks a bit like my own style #4, with more pronounced curves for ㄷ and ㅌ. You can pretty much take all the advice in the rest of this thread before continuing to write faster, except for ""You write 워 strangely."" in this top-level comment by iamkoalafied because yours is written correctly."
Korean,33si18,luciecrystal,2,Mon Apr 27 18:54:43 2015 UTC,One of the first things I learned on writing hangeul is that the horizontal stick on ㅓgoes under the one on ㅜ. I didn't notice yours was wrong though cause it's still legible.  I tend to write really fast and messy even though I'm still a beginner. I think it's more important to get right what is being written than having a nice handwriting.
Korean,33si18,sqlepytt1,2,Tue Apr 28 15:45:42 2015 UTC,"Yey, I love the topic of korean handwriting! Wasted some hours discussing it when I should have been studying! hah... Anyways..   Like some have already pointed out, 1 and 2 seem a bit too robotic or stiff, while 3 and 4 some might find ""cute"", which I think is cause it resembles a kid's handwriting. They are all very legible but possibly quite slow? In order to develop faster writing you really need to look at how each character is written, as well as how certain character combinations/syllables can be combined into something that can be written faster. Like how 오,요,외,왜,와 can all be written super fast without even lifting the pencil. Same with 로, 노 etc, and a lot of Koreans combineㅏ+ㄴ in 한 for example, into what can almost resemble an E. (+a lot more examples which I can't think of right now. This is kinda hard to explain without showing examples but.. ehm. I can upload some more images maybe)    Also how ㅗ is often written almost like a ㄴ and ㅜ as a ㄱ, but because of how the consonant-vowel-consonant positioning works, even if the characters are written almost the same way, you know which one it is based on their positioning.    As for the ㄹ I prefer style 4 which is similar to how I write it.  Is it requried to respect the stroke order? If by that you mean the ""correct"" stroke order that you learn through textbooks? No. Koreans don't do it, it's usually really slow and not very efficient at all.   To wrap it up I'll show you a picture of mine and a Korean friend's handwriting (You can really tell the difference.. ㅜㅜ xD)   Mine: http://imgur.com/i1HhVYi&t8M3hmk#1  My friend's: http://imgur.com/i1HhVYi&t8M3hmk#0"
Korean,33si18,sqlepytt1,1 point,Sat Apr 25 19:25:42 2015 UTC,"Giving up a syllable after 15 seconds, I couldn't understand 4 syllables of your friend's handwriting, and 5 of yours. I can tell there's a big difference, though.  As for being slow or not, my style #4 is pretty fast for me. #1 was much slower. It's not a problem for me to keep writing faster while keeping the appearance of #4, though. I write daily (in English and French) like this at the rate of 3 letters per second (except for 'm' and 'w').    Do you mean something like this for 오, 요?  I wrote my pencil exit marks there, so you can see my number of strokes. One of the 요 looks like it could confuse me with ㄴ until I learned the syllable positioning well enough, and I'm not sure how readable it is.  I'm also not sure about the combinations, like:   and a lot of Koreans combineㅏ+ㄴ in 한 for example, into what can almost resemble an E   For example, I can see in your handwriting that you write your 국 a bit like the ㄹ in this comment by RCIX with a few lines below. That confuses me, and I could only read that syllable because of its surroundings (I knew there was supposed to be a language there). Hmm. :/  As always, thanks for your opinion :)"
Korean,33si18,iamkoalafied,1 point,Sat Apr 25 22:34:52 2015 UTC,"I meant the difference between my friend's and mine, but also just native Koreans and foreigners in general tbh  Anyway, here's what I meant with the different combinations etc.   In case it's unclear;  오 요 외 왜 와  어 에   한  로 노 조 초 소   All kinda stuck together and thus written faster, its just something I've seen a lot.   Which syllables did you not understand though? But like you said, knowing the surroundings is important. Sometimes I even have a hard time reading computer fonts just cause I don't know the actual words."
Korean,33si18,sqlepytt1,2,Sun Apr 26 01:48:55 2015 UTC,"Oh boy. That second line of ""here's what I meant..."" is something I have no idea how to read at all, let alone fast. 미안해요.    Here's your prose, annotated to show what I can't read.   Line 1 syllable 5: Looks like 'Mi'. Line 2 syllable 5: This is your 국, from 한국어, but to me it looks like a cursive vertical ㄱㄱㄱ. Line 2 syllable 8: Looks like it could be 끔, 좀 or 츰. Line 2 syllable 10: Looks like ㄴㄱ, which has no vowel. Line 3 syllable 1: This is your 만, from 만나서, but to me it looks like 안, or cursive 12 + ㅏㄴ. I saw this form elsewhere while searching /r/Korean, though, so I'll have to practice it. Line 3 syllable 9: Takes me over 15 seconds to realise that it's a 화, because it looks like ㄴㅇㅡㅏ. Line 3 syllable 11: Looks like 'CJ', 'tJ', 팅, 녕 or 덩, depending on how long I stare at it.   edit:   Which syllables did you not understand though? But like you said, knowing the surroundings is important. Sometimes I even have a hard time reading computer fonts just cause I don't know the actual words.   I also agree with this. A lot of my quick English and French reading, and bad handwriting deciphering, has to do with the context."
Korean,33si18,luciecrystal,4,Sun Apr 26 02:29:01 2015 UTC,"You have to use context clues. You know it's not ""Mi"" because the person is clearly writing in Korean. So wipe the Mi from your brain and try to find the Korean letters instead. You know it's not a vertical ㄱㄱㄱ because that makes no sense, there has to be a vowel in there. I can understand confusing ㄲ and ㅈ in this one but it is definitely 좀. I'm not sure where you get 츰 from. You know it's not ㄴㄱ because there has to be a vowel. This one would have made me stop for a couple of seconds, too, though. Compare their ㅁ with ㅇ and you can easily tell the difference. Also, this is where stroke order really comes in handy. You can see they have a straight line down and then they lift the pencil to make the rest of the ㅁ. There is no way that is a ㅇ. Of course it's not a 12 because it's Korean. You just need to be used to how the syllable blocks are formed for this sort of thing. There is nothing else it could be besides ㅎ. I can understand not being able to see the dash turning it to ㅗ rather than ㅡ (but it's there). Again, you know they are writing Korean, so there is no way it's CJ/tJ. 녕 and 덩 don't really make sense because the middle dash in ㅌ is connected to ㅌ and not to ㅣ. I guess if you ignore the extra bit of lines you could say it looks like ㄴ or ㄷ but then the dash on ㅓ is up really high which isn't common. For 녕 or 덩 the dash would be on the middle, not the top.   You will get better with more practice! I even came across a sign posted on here a while back that I could not figure out what in the world the first syllable was supposed to be, but it became clear when someone posted what it was. Also, it really really helps if you actually know the word. Like, you knew they wrote 한국어 from context, you know what that word is, too, so seeing ㄱㄱㄱ shouldn't have made you get stuck for long. I'm not sure if you know the word 화이팅 but if you did, you would be able to figure out what they are saying at the end much quicker.  Just keep reminding yourself that you are reading Korean. You aren't reading some other language. Keep in mind how the syllable blocks are formed and the different ways to write different letters. You are still new to reading Korean so it's okay if you can't read different handwriting perfectly yet."
Korean,33si18,iamkoalafied,1 point,Sun Apr 26 03:17:55 2015 UTC,"화이팅   You are correct. I don't know that word. But trying to pronounce it, [hway tiŋ], is that the Korean rendition of that word I see in comments everywhere, ""Fighting!""? That would explain some things..."
Korean,33si18,Qichin,2,Sun Apr 26 03:32:45 2015 UTC,"Haha, that's interesting. I mean, Koreans seem to understand it cause this is how I used to write for my assignments and I never got any complaints from any of my teachers :P   I'll try to go more in depth;   Idd, it does look like 'Mi' xD But as I'm sure you could figure out it's supposed to be a 세, Its just the 2nd line of the ㅅ is super tiny and almost fully connected to the ㅓ, which is also unusually long. Usually it would look more like in the picture.  This is also like u said, written as if it were cursive vertical ㄱㄱㄱ, which does seem weird since with the ㅗ you are supposed to write the ㄱ straight, but doing it the correct way would take significantly longer, and from context and knowing the middle is a vowel I've found this to be perfectly fine xD  좀 is correct. The easy way to see it's not 끔 is since the supposed ㄱ's aren't lined up. I don't quite see how you can make it out to be 츰 though.  It's a 수 which does look like ㄴ ㄱ, but you can differentiate them in that the left-side 'edge' is very sharp in ㅅ while for ㄴ it's round. And since the second character is a vowel, you read it as a ㅜ, since no other vowels look similar to a ㄱ. Although it may look kinda like an ㅇ you can see there's two strokes there, which seperates it from an ㅇ which would just be a circle written from left to round in a single stroke. I usually tend to write ㅁ a bit clearer but seriously a lot of ppl write it as a 12, which was also something I had to get used to myself. Yea, as you can see I tend to write the thing above the ㅎ as a ㄴ cause it's faster and when it's followed directly by a ㅇ you know it's not actually a ㄴ but an ㅎ, if that makes sense xD. Also, if it was suppoesd to be a ㅡ and not ㅗ there would have to be a space between the ㅎ and ㅡ.  It's supposed to be 팅, but it could definitely resemble both 녕 and 덩. But for those cases the strokes of the vowels would be written lower in positioning than the consonant. The two strokes in 녕 would be closer attached to the vowel, and in 덩 the stroke in ㅓ would be inbetween the ㄷ and not above it.   EDIT: I figured it's easier to just write out the differences :P   Nr. 3. is 좀, 끔, 촘 and 7. 팅, 녕, 덩.   EDIT2: so just realized iamkoalafield said pretty much everything I just wrote here xD oh well, double explanations!"
Korean,33si18,iamkoalafied,1 point,Sun Apr 26 03:44:00 2015 UTC,"Not completely redundant, as of your EDIT.  I appreciate you taking the time to write the syllables I thought yours were, all as you'd write them. The differences are very subtle, but now with that picture, I can refer back to them if I'm confused."

Korean,33si18,Qichin,1 point,Mon Apr 27 14:30:45 2015 UTC,"Three and four both have their merits. I have some opinions on your handwriting in four below. One and two look too robotic. You write 워 strangely. The horizontal line on ㅓ should go below ㅜ not above. So every time you write 워 it looks weird to me. Also, I used to write my ㄹ like you do in four but a native speaker told me it looked strange to them, so I altered it to be 2 strokes instead of 1. Still quicker than the ""correct"" 3 but it looks better now imo. I don't personally have a problem with it, but just letting you know what someone else said to me. I don't think I've ever even come across 룰 or 롤 so honestly I wouldn't worry about it because they don't seem to be common syllables. I can read your 를 in all the styles. Stroke order helps with legibility especially if you are writing really fast. But if you're already reducing the number of strokes, of course the stroke order is going to be a little strange. Personally, even though I have reduced ㅂ to 2 strokes and ㄹ to 2 strokes, the only letter I write that doesn't follow stroke order is ㅁ and it looks the worst out of all my letters (imo) so I might change it.   You really should write ㅅ as 2 strokes. It already looks a bit strange how you write it, and when you start writing faster it is going to look even stranger being only 1 stroke. You should write it similar to your ㅈ just without the little bit at the top. Part of why it looks weird is due to ㅅ and ㅈ following 2 different styles, too.  ㄷ is another than really should be 2 strokes. The faster you write, the stranger it is going to look. It'll end up looking like a C.  That is a really interesting way of writing ㅍ. Again, I'd be careful for when you start writing faster.  I don't recommend using that way of writing ㅆ. It looks really weird.  I really like your ㅎ though!  Here's my handwriting if you want to compare. I wrote basically the same thing you wrote for easier comparison.  edit: One thing you can do when you are trying to see if it's a good way to write a letter is try to write it multiple times, getting faster every time. If it becomes unrecognizable, you might want to try writing it another way. Your ㅅ is a good one to show this. If you write it fast, it becomes curved at the top, and eventually almost flattens to a straight line depending on how fast you go. That wouldn't happen if you used 2 strokes. This isn't a perfect method but I think it might help."
Korean,33si18,RCIX,1 point,Sat Apr 25 07:49:02 2015 UTC,"정말 감사합니다 for the comments! You had a lot to say, so I'll reply to each one.   About #1 and #2: Yes, they look very robotic. #1 and #2 represent the first steps taken by people I've seen on /r/Korean. I already thought #1 was going to look odd when handwritten, as well as take a very long time, especially for wide or tall ㅇ, as well as wide ㄹ. So I started with #2. Thanks for ignoring #1 and #2 ;) [워] I didn't even notice it was wrong. According to your picture, it looks like the horizontal line of ㅓ in ㅝ should be centered between the ㅜ and the bottom of the ㅓ itself. Thanks for correcting my mistake! -- [ㄹ] In the picture, you seem to write ㄹ as ㄱ (stroke 1) + a reversed 's' like I did. Is that right? [룰/롤] Rolls (롤)? A rendition of the word roleplay? I have no idea. [를] Cool! At least I'm not that bad still :) I guess I was asking about my 2-stroke ㅂ being illegible versus incorrect. I'm sure there will be some purists insisting on a 4-stroke ㅂ while I don't think my 2-stroke ㅂ can become less legible, for example. But my 2-stroke ㅁ could look like ㅇ sometime, and be actually illegible in addition to incorrect if I'm writing too fast.   As for ㅅ being 2 strokes, well to me it looks like an upside-down V, so I started writing it like that. I'll continue practicing with the 2-stroke ㅅ, because you're right that it could become smooshed and then people would mistake it for a really short ㄱ... I'm not sure if I'll want to extend the / diagonal further than the \ diagonal, though.  As for ㄷ looking like a C, it took me the longest time to think of ㄷ as a D, because I always saw people write it curved, and it has the general shape of a C. And in my #3, I think the ㄷ in 다 looks like a Greek τ! In your picture, you seem to write that ㄷ as - from left to right, then going back with a sort of C shape. I guess that's because the top stroke is important.  ㅍ: Yeah, I'm not so sure of my 'u in the middle' there, but I worry that a 4-stroke ㅍ can look like ㅁ, which my 3-stroke one can't. Oh, the confusion.  As for ㅆ of #4 being written like a slashed ㅅ, I don't know. I saw that in a native speaker's handwriting once, and it makes sense to me as long as ㅆ isn't being crossed by a vowel.  ㅎ: Thanks!  I'm sure I'll get other comments on my ㄹ. Thanks for weighing in with your opinion and your picture!"
Korean,33si18,lazyheroine,3,Sat Apr 25 09:40:03 2015 UTC,"The way I understand it, if you stay with the accepted stroke order, then your writing will stay legible even if you don't write out ""computer-shapes"". While I'm only a beginner in Korean, I'm native in Chinese, and AFAIK it's the same principle. Which is why you shouldn't make up your own stroke order until you know how the writing is supposed to flow.  As an example, /u/RCIX linked an image of a ㄹ that doesn't look like the printed version, but still follows the stroke order, and as such remains legible.  The whole point of the stroke order is to keep the shapes legible and separable when writing quickly."
Korean,33si18,sqlepytt1,2,Sat Apr 25 13:03:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah! That's exactly what I was trying to get across. My handwriting isn't perfect by any means. It suffers from the same problem I have when writing English, my letters have a bit of a lift to them (which gets worse the faster I write) but it isn't something I'm concerned with fixing because I know it is remains legible even if I'm writing fast (except for maybe my ㅁ).  OP's handwriting is legible when written slowly, but once they start getting faster it is only going to get harder to read unless they change it up to follow closer to proper stroke order. So it is better to fix it now before they get too much into the habit of writing like that."
Korean,33si18,RCIX,1 point,Sat Apr 25 17:17:32 2015 UTC,"I can see how it follows the stroke order.  I mean, I get it: it starts out with a ㄱ from the top-left to the middle-left, then - in the middle, then ㄴ from the middle-right to the bottom-right. And so does the one in my style #3, where I intentionally exaggerated the middle line to demonstrate that it was the stroke order in action.  But to me it looks like it could be a variety of things.  As a more extreme example, do you think http://imgur.com/0Ce5ztm is legible? It follows the stroke order of ㅂ, but to me it's not legible, because of the extra baggage as I joined the ends of strokes."
Korean,33si18,BackedBean,3,Sat Apr 25 18:03:12 2015 UTC,"As a more extreme example, do you think http://imgur.com/0Ce5ztm is legible?   No, not at all. Sorry. :("
Korean,33si18,RCIX,2,Sat Apr 25 18:34:25 2015 UTC,"Following the stroke order ensures that any changes that creep in from fast writing follow a specific pattern that allows the letters to remain legible. Essentially, you learn the printed shape, and you learn the basic handwritten variant which is typically relatively consistent thanks to the stroke order.  Your ㅂ is not really legible, because stroke order also includes when you should lift the pen/break lines. The 3 and 4 lines can conceivably be written like a quick Z, but the first two lines are separate from that."

Korean,33peyw,cryptosan,8,Fri Apr 24 12:43:27 2015 UTC,"Focusing on vocab works well if you're learning a language that has similar grammar structures, such as English > Spanish, Spanish > Italian, etc.  The thing with Korean is that while vocabulary is important, you can't just plug your vocabulary into a sentence based of English's grammar structure and make it work. I feel that I've spent much much longer working on grammar concepts when learning Korean than I ever bothered when learning Spanish (and Spanish is known for having a fairly complex verb tense/conjugation system).  I've seen the opposite a lot: tons of kids attend hagwons for years and years, and can't speak a lick of English, even if they know thousands of words. This is for several reasons, but the top ones in my mind are:   They don't authentically use the language in speaking. In order to get the vastly different grammar/vocab down, you absolutely need to be speaking. It doesn't matter if you're speaking to a Korean, or with a study partner who's also learning Korean, or if you're speaking to the mirror or your dog or making recordings to post on your Youtube channel, but you absolutely have to be speaking. Note: this does not mean you are doing grammar/direct translations. This means you are talking about your day, or telling a story, or describing things in your apartment, or whatever, as long as it's authentic. Don't just rely on materials that are made for learning a language. Use a variety of authentic materials and mix that into your studying as well. Materials made for language learning miss soooo much everyday, important language (I think this is mostly because language learning has always been seen as an educational endeavor and materials have been developed to be ""proper"" and ""educational"": thus, no curse words, no slang, outdated idioms, etc.) I've taught lots of ESL books series to students, and not once have a seen ""cool"" as in ""That's cool"" taught, or ""sucks"" as in ""That sucks"", yet both are used extensively (if you're under 40). So, if you can find a couple TV shows that interest you, or if you're into music in your target language, or maybe comic books or whatever, try to mix it in, according to your interests and level. If you like webtoons, but the one you found is too hard, look around and try to find something less wordy. Same goes with movies/tv, songs, etc. Regardless, you'll end up covering shit that's been sorely missed in your grammar materials, and as an added bonus you'll come across things that you've studied, which will reinforce what you've already learned."
Korean,33peyw,rybeardj,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:06:45 2015 UTC,"The top one which you wrote, i really really agree..! The problem of Korean school is that they don't teach about Listening/Speaking. it's a big problem. So this days... i'm learning Speaking/Listening everyday, reading a story books/voca book loudly, or watching american drama. It's so hard, because i've never learnt/studied Speaking/Listening for last 23 years...:// I've been learning Speaking/Listening for 3? or 4 months."
Korean,33peyw,rybeardj,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:37:13 2015 UTC,Cool! I'm glad you started working on Speaking/Listening. I feel sorry for so many students in Korea who just study a grammar book for so many years and then realize they can't say anything. It's really sad that teachers think grammar books will teach them how to speak.

Korean,33peyw,rybeardj,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:52:08 2015 UTC,"I also believe many of the grammar points in Korean are, for us English speakers, vocabulary. Because when you translate them you need to add things in English to convey the meaning. So neglecting grammar is neglecting in a way vocabulary. And alongside speaking a bigger vocabulary helps you get around explaining things you don't know the word for, thus expanding your communication skills."
Korean,33peyw,MyJokesArentFunny,2,Sat Apr 25 03:03:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I see what you're saying. Guess the lines are pretty blurred between grammar/vocabulary in regards to the two languages. Never really thought about it before :)"
Korean,33peyw,oegukeen_LK,6,Sat Apr 25 03:22:07 2015 UTC,"Hahaha. I wouldnt say intermediate is all about the vocabulary. I find the main thing with improving at that level is speaking more quickly and accurately.  As for finding a Korean bf or gf, dont count on it giving too much of an advantage. It's helpful, but barely for most."
Korean,33peyw,gujayeon,8,Fri Apr 24 12:51:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, there is limit to improve with bf/gf. but in beginner level, it makes motivation to be intermediate. The point of this article is to make motivations."
Korean,33peyw,MyJokesArentFunny,1 point,Fri Apr 24 14:51:36 2015 UTC,I agree. Having Korean boyfriend is what got me to start learning Korean in the first place.

I don't force what I learned on my gf on a daily basis but will say things like ""oh have you seen the news about ..."" using the complicated vocabulary i just saw on the news. But if the conversation doesn't continue naturally, then I stop. It's meant to be natural, if she's not interested it's over.  Sometimes I'll be able to use the words I've just seen entirely and sometimes none. That's how it is.   Sometimes I'll try my hardest to be more precise when explaining something because that's the whole point of advanced vocabulary. But there's a fine line to thread because it's a relationship, not a classroom. There's a lot of tact involved to not make it look like I'm a trying hard (but totally am)"
Korean,33peyw,lumaga,6,Sat Apr 25 02:52:15 2015 UTC,"Hehe, the bf/gf thing made me giggle because that's probably what improved my Korean the most, in college. That said, I was already fluent (gyopo) and am really only working on expanding my vocab.   Anyways, it's probably helpful for advanced intermediate speakers or gyopo (who may be beginner/intermediate but still fluent, since fluency is somewhat independent of skill). However, the fact that someone is a native speaker doesn't mean that they're going to be a good teacher. For example, I ask my husband (native speaker, but he was 이과, not 문과) if X in word XY is the 한자 for [definition], he's usually just like err maybe probably iono look it up yourself.   The other tips sound pretty useful. I'd add that it is helpful as a beginner to really learn simple grammar constructions, so that you can have basic phrases that you can say very very comfortably and then use them all the time (even if it's just mumbling to yourself). This is the easiest way to practice your vocab in appropriate context."

Korean,33qikg,Inyolight,3,Fri Apr 24 22:01:21 2015 UTC,"When I was a beginner I studied a couple hours everyday (ttmik) and listened to Korean music quite s bit (버스커 버스커 , 10cm, Acoustic Collabo,etc).  I always made flash cards of any words I didn't know from the chapters and studied them until I was down with the first 7 or so volumes.  After that I practiced writing my own sentences and familiarizing myself with the sentence structure.  Nowadays I usually read a couple chapters of a web toon or watch a tv show in Korean. I always have my phone on hand to write down new words. Eventually I put these words into anki and study that when in bored.  My advice is to not study grammar too much. Just learn the present tense, past tense and future. Pick up the more common connectors like -서, (으)니까, -고, -ㄴ/는데, etc and study vocab a lot. I learned I wasted too much time studying straight grammar that is not often used. You'd be surprised how much of a conversation those grammar forms I mentioned above will cover."
Korean,33qikg,Breadincaptivity,3,Fri Apr 24 18:10:21 2015 UTC,"I try to do at least this every day:  45 minutes of studying (right now I'm using 바른 한국어 but when I'm done with that, I'll probably get another text book) and listen to two TTMIK 이야기.  That's about an hour right there.    Most nights I also watch a Kdrama and/or variety show and try to pick up new words.  Throughout the day I usually chat with my penpal a little bit.  While watching TV I practice 한자 or vocab flash cards... When cleaning I'll listen to some TTMIK lessons or watch Go Billy videos...  I try to translate short news articles regularly and read books.  And then twice a week I talk with my penpal for an hour or two.  So I think it's good to try to set a minimum goal and then if you do extra... Yay!  Tl;dr - At least an hour each day. Once you figure in the fun extra stuff, I probably average two hours a day."
Korean,33qikg,CourageNA,2,Fri Apr 24 20:20:09 2015 UTC,"Back when I was initially cramming information (TTMIK/KMS lessons and over a thousand vocab words) I would study 1.5 hours a day minimum. Now that I've established a decent base, I no longer set hours, instead I just read/practice conversation in the IRC daily to make reading/writing feel more natural."
Korean,33qikg,typecfl,2,Fri Apr 24 19:05:19 2015 UTC,"When I started out learning Korean, I had a pretty set schedule, just going through my beginner textbooks and studied around 3-4 hours a day (with breaks). I zipped through two beginner textbooks in 2-3 weeks and I thought I learned a lot at that time.  Nowadays it would depend on how much time I've got. Although I don't consider watching dramas ""studying"", I spend 1-2 hours a day watching dramas/variety shows. I used to watch with subtitles until at one point the subtitles were taking too long that I decided to watch an episode raw and found that I could understand 50-60% of what they were saying. Now I can understand most trendy dramas but I need my trusty online dictionaries for historical ones and ones that use a lot of specific terminologies (e.g. medical/legal dramas). Variety shows are fun because you get to listen to real-time talk, but you have captions as a crutch since they caption a ton of things.  I also read a few webtoons, which are pretty fun. Depending on what the content is, I could either read through them without ever using a dictionary or may need it for heavy dialogues. Also, radio shows. I used to listen to Yoo Inna's Volume Up radio, but ever since Tablo went back to DJing for Dreaming Radio I mostly listen to him.  Part of my daily routine involves journal writing too, and I always make it a point to write something in Korean. I look back at my old entries and I cringe at the wrong grammar and how bad it sounds, but making mistakes is a huge part of learning.  tl; dr: most of my Korean study hours are not ""studying"" at all--it's just me having fun and being entertained and learning at the side. It's probably a slower method than just all-out studying textbooks and grammar, but I'm having fun and that's important for me. :)"

Korean,33qikg,Nebuleon,1 point,Sun Apr 26 10:25:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I could tell you the average time I set aside per day for Korean language study. It varies a lot.  Sometimes, I go through many Pimsleur units in a day, each being 30 minutes (so maybe 1 hour 30). I mostly go through 1 at a time, though.  Other days, I just read random Korean text to myself to see how fast I can read it and pick up patterns, including how well I can skip ㅇ at the start of syllables and read ㅇ at the end. Because I have so much Korean music in my YouTube watch history, and recently 먹방 (mukbangs/let's-eat shows) and Talk to Me in Korean units, I am often surprised by new text on YouTube. But I also sometimes search for song lyrics, news articles and other things in Korean, including the proper spelling of words I learned through Pimsleur.  I can also work on my handwriting by looking up consonant and vowel practice sheets, as well as trying to write tall syllables like 좋 in 좋아해요, and copying random things. I may set aside a block of 2 hours for this every so often.  And some other days, I do nothing specific, but I reinforce the learning by playing back some words in my head. Sometimes the words will be accompanied by thinking of the 한글 rendering of the word as if it were on some sort of brain billboard.  Hope this helps!"

And yes, there are people who are shallow/materialistic. This is also true for America and for Europe and so on and so forth.  Also, you do realize that many (not all, obviously, and the numbers are going to be lower for younger generations) East Asians are somewhat ""racist"" against other East Asian countries? There are both recent historical and current events that cause these negative sentiments. It's not surprising that you got a loaded response when asking a Korean/Japanese/Chinese person about what they think about Korean/Japanese/Chinese people.

You already seem biased against Korea and Korean people so I don't know why you are even considering it. Just go with Japanese or Mandarin where you already have experience. Even if we told you Korean is used all the time in business situations and such, that isn't going to wipe away your prejudices.  If you want to interact with actual Korean people and see if your opinions change, find some of those apps where you can talk to random people, like maybe HelloTalk? You don't have to speak Korean to them, but instead help them practice their English. And then you will realize Korean people are just like everyone else.

Korean,33nv17,Eggplantsauce,5,Fri Apr 24 01:23:21 2015 UTC,"The thing with language learning, in my opinion, is it's hard to juggle many languages all at once, especially if you're a beginner at most, if not all, of them. There are, of course, cases where people do this and become very successful at it, but my advice would be to stick to one language at a time (or two, if you're at an intermediate/advanced level in one).  Also, if you're looking to study Japanese and Korean, maybe try and get more proficient in Japanese and then use Japanese as a way to learn Korean by using Korean language textbooks written in Japanese. That way you keep improving (or at least maintain your proficiency) in Japanese while building your Korean language skills.  Language learning is never meant to be easy--you're learning an entirely different way to say everything and with it comes an entirely different culture from the one you grew up with. That said, it doesn't mean it can't be fun. :) And I've had my share of language love affairs from Spanish and French to Arabic and Thai, so I can understand where you're coming from.

I think you may need to focus on just one for a while and get it really solid before developing another.  I've been really tempted to start another language lately, but I know that (for me) it would most likely be detrimental to my Korean right now.  There are definitely people who have a bigger capacity for these things, though, and maybe you are one!    It's true that it will be difficult, but don't be discouraged. If you stick with it, you'll have a very unique skill by the time you finish high school! And mentoring people who want to learn English would probably look pretty good on college applications.  Just remember, it's like playing an instrument.  It takes a ton of regular practice! I hope you stick with one of your languages and can then add more!

Korean,33nv17,infringement153,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:23:43 2015 UTC,"I learned a tiny bit of Japanese, but I ended up not going too deep because the class I was taking (in Korea when I was visiting family) moved too quickly, as the Korean students already knew hanja which translated very quickly to kanji, and I hadn't really learned hanja because I haven't gone to school in Korea.  Anyways, the main similarities that I noticed were:   Kanji and Hanja have about a 80%+ overlap in meaning. However, the sounds are often not the same.  There are few Japanese-loan words that are used directly in Korean, but these are falling out of favor (because of historical context)  Some Japanese words and Korean words (especially the ones with Chinese roots) sound similar, but it's about the same as the overlap between Spanish and English The basic sentence order was similar and the grammar patterns were similar    That said I really really really do not recommend learning both Japanese and Korean at the same time. Most of these similarities are only going to confuse you, rather than help you, unless you're already fluent in one. If you're really hoping to learn both, the best thing would be to learn Korean once you're at an advanced intermediate stage in Japanese, and from a Japanese -> Korean textbook."

She'll need a lot of patience, but don't count on her for everything.  Read books, ask questions here, use dic.naver.com to its full potential.  The main thing is, just keep studying... you'll be conversational enough (not perfect by any means) in 1 year, so you can talk to her mom about a lot, and from there you'll keep getting better. In 3 years, if you devoted a great portion of your life to this language, you should be real good."

Korean,33l8bo,Areumdaun,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:49:13 2015 UTC,"You can learn to speak to your GF's mother without stumbling a lot in a year, you won't even need lessons. Be ambitious, there's no need for that to take 3 years at all. The biggest thing is that you need to find contacts who you're going to be talking with in Korean. Whether that's your gf and someone else. I often hear people making the excuse ""yeah but Koreans want to practice their English so they don't want to talk in Korean with me"". Well, I have loads of experience with this and if you're at least half-way decent they'll have no problem talking with you in Korean. Out of 100 there'll be maybe 1 who keeps trying to use English, really. Here I'm not talking about random people on the street, though, they do want to take that opportunity to practice English. I'm talking about online or real-life social contacts. It would for sure be easiest if that person would be your gf but that might actually be hard, because.. she's your gf, so you want to express your thoughts easily and accurately.  Edit: Oh, you don't live in Korea. Bit harder then, make full use of internet contacts then."
Korean,33l8bo,Areumdaun,2,Fri Apr 24 02:21:25 2015 UTC,"There are only very few people who can pull that off.   Especially since he lives in Korea, no. You're really underestimating how quick people (and not just very few) can learn. I don't blame you though since it's a very prevalent thought. It doesn't help that there are very few people who actually put in the effort and stay at it for more than a year though, that's probably what causes this line of thinking. There's not many who actually practice every day, meaning 365 days a year.  In 1 year anyone can learn ~2000 words + all the grammar listed here, with 45 minutes a day (365 days per year) spent on that - especially with the amount of Korean that he sees while being in Korea. Then along with that, spend another 45 minutes conversing in Korean, either through typing or through actual speech, in order to apply the stuff you're learning and such (imo it's better to start off with typing and only move to speaking later on when you're better because you can look up stuff while typing, which you can't while speaking). And of course, if you're in Korea, apply it in daily life. After that start watching Korean TV, etc etc, after 3 years you'd be what I'd call ""advanced"".  I've seen people who can watch drama's without missing anything after 2 years of self-study and who can also converse with Koreans on the same level as that in the drama's and by that I mean very naturally, understanding the nuances and 98% of the grammar and words used. Sure, they won't have a clue what's going on in the economy or politics section of the newspaper, but honestly there's many younger Koreans who wouldn't understand those things very well either..  Edit: Oh, OP doesn't live in Korea. Bit harder then, still doable."

I became advanced level in 3 years mostly due to help from my (ex) boyfriend, he just always spoke with me and forced me to practice (mostly because his english was impossible).  hopefully your gf's mom changes her mind! good luck and also i recommend just watching some talk shows and repeating after the people, even if you don't understand what they say.  Sounding fluent is sometimes more influential than knowing a ton of vocab."
Korean,33l8bo,rageygirl123,6,Thu Apr 23 14:23:22 2015 UTC,"My SO is Korean but speaks fluent English. Similarly, the parents are also concerned.    In the first year we were together, I soon came to realise that I absolutely had to learn the language after visiting his country. So, I spent most of my time making sure that I was mentally prepared to learn a new language. Moreover I just wanted to be sure that in the case that we break up, I will continue learning it because it's just time wasted to me. I wanted our relationship to be slightly separate from my Korean learning.   In 2012: I took lessons for 2 months. 2 times a week. In 2013, I took lessons for 2 months, once a week  In 2014, I took lessons more consistently for most of the year (2 hours once a week)    In between my bursts of language learning, I tried to self study to no avail (with Talk to me in Korean, link below) because it was hard to motivate myself. The lack of communication with a native Korean teacher was similarly frustrating and difficult. I gave up and invested in regular lessons. I showed a lot of improvement once I started doing that.   In your case, it is possible to be advanced in 3 years, but you have to go for class once a week and really make yourself learn the language.    Now, in 2015, I am at Intermediate level, probably somewhere between TOPIK 3 and 4. It's good enough for the SO's parents to notice the improvements. I know I have to eventually become very good at the language (group lessons were too slow with too many 'recreational' learners who were not as serious as me) so I hired a private tutor instead, who goes through my Sogang textbooks with me.  In my opinion, Sogang textbooks are quite well paced. I complete 1 chapter in two weeks (ie every single page is not left untouched, all exercises are answered in complete sentences etc.). 1 book has about 8 chapters. That's approximately one TOPIK level in one year, which is around the pace of improvements that you are expecting.  I hired a Korean undergraduate as my private tutor. Tip for you- the Korean community is quite tight knit so you can try asking around if someone is willing to tutor you privately.    Personally, I hired a tutor instead of just relying on the SO, because I feel like my relationship would be less healthy if we communicate less in English (for e.g. you mentioned it was weird for your girlfriend to see you speaking Korean. Same here with my SO).   Moreover, I am paying my tutor so she puts in extra effort to teach and explain confusing grammar and vocab to me, unlike my SO. I would strongly recommend paying someone to teach you instead of just relying on your girlfriend because that will add a lot of pressure onto her. Not everyone can teach their native language either, and will have a lot of confusing questions that will irritate both you and her (personal experience!)   But there's no hard and fast rule about this and it is really up to you.    Also after some years studying Korean I started to know people who became very fluent at it, so I tried to surround myself with them and try to motivate myself to study more.  Singing helps too. Try listening to simple songs that are catchy and repetitive (e.g. SNSD songs can be quite simple to listen to with discernible lyrics). Soon you will be able to hum and even sing the lyrics. Because Korean has its own rhythmic flow, you will get a better rhythm and feel for the language. Moreover when you start to recognise basic vocab or expressions, it can give you that confidence boost too!     That said I think there's still one final thing I've realised but feel free to disagree with me   The goal of learning Korean is not (just) to speak perfectly, because Koreans communicate via a very hierarchical language system that acts as social signalling on who should be given respect- i.e. whose opinions matter and so who gets to speak the most. One should eventually know how to speak respectfully to your elders, especially if you aim to impress the girlfriend's mom. It's a totally different ballgame from English which is more egalitarian. If you meet her and you don't bow, if your tone is too casual and you are not deemed respectful enough, learning grammar and vocab perfectly can't save you!   Hope these helped and good luck! Here's some links for you that helped me a lot:   Useful resources:    TTMK - For listening and clarifying grammar, but it is not enough to become better at Korean KBS on Youtube - For listening, watching subbed dramas or documentaries (check out their documentaries, you won't regret it). You can watch an interesting show with your girlfriend too and learn something along the way!    For news and other culture I like to read:    Korea Bang - For translated Korean news Ask a Korean - For insights into Korean culture. He wrote his own piece on how he learnt English too."

Has his parents given into you no that you have been with him a while??? Im learning this for my self (my job has pay raises for each language I know) so thats my motivation and being in the korean heavy area in Georgia I know koreans are tight knit group. I was going to get lessons but she said no, so I may learn from her. (she is an esol teacher) and then when I feel like I want to be advanced quicker or I can feel a fight coming on ill go to paid tutors. Lucky for me I have about 2 hours of work time free because I can finish early so im going to use that time to study too."
Korean,33l8bo,kpauburn,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:44:30 2015 UTC,"No worries! I just thought I could give you a helping hand. When I started out I also read tons of advice online too and I understand how you feel.   Yes, his parents were more 'resigned' to it since I haven't gone away after four years :p but I suspect it is also partly because I am a Chinese girl who can pass off as a Korean, and that I showed improvements in Korean each time I meet them.   I am sure there are still many dormant issues between us that may only blow up if we are set to be married. In your case perhaps the parental opposition is showing up earlier because she is a girl... If her parents are ultra traditional (I assume they are from what I know of Koreans in that age group), they may start to feel insecure when she starts dating. I am assuming that her parents may hold the belief that a girl's marriage worth decreases with age and every guy she dates, like most Asians do, and so feel more paranoid when she is in a relationship. If you can overcome this hurdle, I don't think there will be as much opposition the longer you date your girlfriend. Your girlfriend may disagree with me vehemently and I don't know your situation/her parents, but that's what I feel after reading what you said, please take this with a pinch of salt.   Good luck with your studying and your relationship! :)"

It took me 1 year and 2 months of self study from scratch, everyday without fail after work, to pass TOPIK level 4, which is basically finishing the intermediate stage and starting the advanced stage (in my opinion). So if I can do it, you can too, easily within 3 years. Just try hard to study whenever you have free time. I learned in this order: hangeul, common expressions, grammar, more grammar, vocab, speaking. I did listening practices throughout this once I finished a grammar book by listening to dialogue online."

I've left now, but planned to study super hard for the next 11 months, before attempting the TOPIK. My vocabulary is so varied, but my writing and especially grammar are so bad.  My aim is level 4, possibly 5. Then I could apply to a Korean university for a scholarship for a Masters.   I have a Korean girlfriend who I live with now.

I personally think knowing grammar is more important from the start, and youll naturally learn vocab while studying grammar books. After grammar, you can buy a vocab book and do some memorizing. If you just learn vocab first, you wont be able to make use of it, and vocab is harder to retain than grammar patterns."

Korean,33l8bo,kpauburn,2,Mon Apr 27 11:55:39 2015 UTC,"Personally, I found grammar the better place to start. I found success with a brown book called ""Korean Grammar in Use"". At first I would say ""먹어요 means eat, but said 먹었어요 means eat"" and I would be confused. But, once I was able to realize the different forms of the word, I improved.   Be aware of how difficult it will be for both you and your girlfriend. And while your girlfriend can speak to you in Korean to help you learn, she will probably want to speak English more often, perhaps until she can understand your level of comfortability with being immersed.  Hope I helped. Good luck."

Etc etc. Part of learning a new language is experimenting to figure out what works for you. Yeah, there's a pretty good chance you're going to end up wasting your time with something that doesn't help you, but you won't know until you try it (or at least research it, if there's a bunch of people saying X method is very bad then you might just want to avoid it)."
Korean,33ksiv,iamkoalafied,2,Thu Apr 23 21:02:59 2015 UTC,"I understand that but I wanted other people's experiences learning it to see if it gave me other ideas. I'm not very inventive when it comes to learning and I've always struggled when it came to methods of revision, so I wondered if anyone had any advice."
Korean,33ksiv,nvoidz,0,Thu Apr 23 21:09:51 2015 UTC,"I understand you want advice. I'm just saying if your goal is to learn in ""the best possible way"" well, that isn't exactly possible because such a thing doesn't exist. Hearing ideas from other people could give you ideas of what to try, but you are likely to still end up doing something that doesn't work out well for you."
Korean,33ksiv,nvoidz,2,Thu Apr 23 23:35:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry, maybe I'm not explaining myself correctly. I'm not talking about the absolute best way that everybody has to go through to learn Korean or any other way is redundant - I know that's not possible with the inherent differences in all human beings. It would just be nice if there was an indication on where you might want to start. I've ordered the Go Billy books from Amazon because, after a quick preview of the book, I see it explains things from the beginning - things about Korea as a country, the language, how the written form developed, the different forms of writing, what ""Hangul"" is, etc. The resources in the sidebar are brilliant but without looking through a lot of them, not knowing exactly where to start, like you said there's a chance I'll try learning things that are too advanced or things that aren't really teaching me anything. For example, I used the TTMIK website for a few lessons before realising I was only getting phrasebook style knowledge. I know how to say hello, goodbye, thank you, yes, no, etc but I don't know how those words are broken up into the language.  You're right, a lot of this is trial and error and maybe I'm being lazy posting this on here rather than just going through it myself. I'm just looking for advice on where to start. I'm the type of person who likes to have some sort of plan going into things so you waste less time figuring out where to go next and more time actually learning. I get that everybody learns differently but there's no way that people who are teaching Korean have different starting points for different types of learners (non-native). Things along the way are likely to differ - some people might have exposure to speaking Korean regularly which is a great learning tool. However, I don't, so people that have this opportunity might learn differently. They have the advantage of speaking Korean regularly but they still need to start somewhere and have a general idea of where they'll go next.  Maybe I'm asking for too much or being lazy, as a self-learner, but I thought it would be worth asking. :)"
Korean,33k2gc,TteokToMe,4,Thu Apr 23 03:44:34 2015 UTC,I've heard that the University of Hawaii has a good Korean program from some people who went there. I know they offer up to a Masters in Korean so you might want to research that.
Korean,33k2gc,Pikmeir,2,Thu Apr 23 04:07:23 2015 UTC,"I'll definitely look into it! My current first choice is the University of Texas at Austin, they seem to have a fairly comprehensive 3.5ish year Korean language concentration."
Korean,33k2gc,Agent117,1 point,Thu Apr 23 04:22:15 2015 UTC,"Currently taking Korean at UTA (though I am a Computer Science major so I'm not entirely sure how relevant this is). While I am only in the second semester of year 1 right now, it appears that our class is much like other language courses. We move slowly, answer questions in class slowly, and I'm overall not impressed with the speed with which we are learning. I wouldn't say the curriculum is entirely to blame as the general attitude of our class also influences our pace. This could also be due to the fact that as a year 1 course some are taking it simply to fulfill a foreign language requirement, not for fluency.   Another thing to note is that UTA currently only holds 2 classes for Korean 506 & 507 (semesters 1 & 2 of the first year) and one class for every year following so securing a spot is actually quite competitive. In our class we have 1 freshman and ~4 sophomores in a class of about 20.   If there is anything that I could help with or any questions regarding the class you have, don't hesitate to ask through the comments here or pm-ing me."
Korean,33k2gc,Agent117,1 point,Thu Apr 23 11:32:31 2015 UTC,"By one class a year, do you mean actually one class a year, or one per semester?"
Korean,33k2gc,ShinshinRenma,2,Thu Apr 23 13:46:40 2015 UTC,"That was poorly worded by me.   The way Korean works for UT at Austin is there is a class for the first semester and a class for the second semester. Technically they are two separate classes as you must register for them individually, but the second semester is a continuation of the first. It is required to take the fall semester course to take the spring semester course. So effectively, the system is broken into years. I don't know of any other language here that does it this way.   What I was trying to say there is that there is one instructor and one timeslot for every semester past the 2nd semester course. I believe the course I'm taking next year is 4-5:30 and that is the only first semester of year 2 Korean offered."

Korean,33i9d9,lazyheroine,5,Wed Apr 22 20:40:36 2015 UTC,"Other Fun Facts: Pesquería is a municipality in the Greater Metro Area of Monterrey, in the State of Nuevo León. The chief executive of a municipality in Mexico is called ""Mayor"".  A municipality in Mexico is sort of a mix between county and town in the US. So, a Municipality can be big in area and have several small villages or towns in it, or the municipality can be small in area and densely urbanized, in which case it is considered a city (Officially defined as a municipality that is more than 90% urbanized). Several municipalities that are geographically near, and economically symbiotic can be linked in public services such as infrastructure, law enforcement, water works, etc..., to form a metropolitan area.  In the State of Nuevo León, the largest metro Area is the Monterrey metro area, composed of the cities of Monterrey, Guadalupe, San Nicolás, Apodaca, Santa Catarina, and the municipalities of Juarez, García, Santiago, Salinas Victoria, and Pesquería (where this ad came from). The Monterrey metro area has a population of about 4 million and is the 3rd largest in Mexico by population and area, and 2nd in economic importance.  In Mexico, the largest Metro Area is the ""Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico"", made of over 150 cities and municipalities in the States of Mexico and Hidalgo, and all of the boroughs in the Federal District (whose urban districts are collectively known as Mexico City). The Valley of Mexico Metro Zone has an estimated population of over 22 million people, which would mean that 1/5th of the population of Mexico lives in this area.  Finally, it's not the first time that Mexican candidate advertise in foreign languages. A few years ago, in the State of Guanajuato, where a lot of Japanese car companies have settled, bringing an influx of nearly 2,000 Japanese immigrants, a candidate advertised in Japanese. The State of Guanajuato has public road signs in Spanish, English and Japanese, and Pesquería is starting to adopt dual Spanish / Korean signs as well, now that Kia is coming to town. The neighbouring Apodaca municipality is exploring doing the same thing, as many businesses have taken the lead."

For the developers, it's very easy to implement. All they do is stick the card into a web page and it runs without issue. And for the users, statistically speaking, the people who are most likely to do anything more than a simple change (like making the entire card bigger, bold, etc) are much more likely to have experience doing this or something like it already. And, of course, it's more extensible, so just about anything you can do when making a website you can do in Anki.  For getting the font used on a website, in Firefox or Chrome:   Press F12. Click the button circled here (in Firefox, same spot, different icon). Mouse over the text you want the font for and click it. Scroll down on the right side of the panel that was opened with F12 until you see the last instance of font or font-style. The font is listed there.   If there are more than 1 font listed (as is the case in that image), it's a fall-through list and will pick the first font that you have on your computer. In my case, I have Verdana so it picked that, next it would have tried Arial, and then Helvetica."

It's a bit repetitive, but it's a good effort and will get the information across.  외국어를 잘 배우려면 꼭 연습해야 합니다. 매주 한 번에 3시간씩 공부하는 것보다 매일 15분씩 공부하는 것이 훨씬 도움이 됩니다. 외국어는 바로 습득되는 것이 아니라서 지속적으로 영어를 사용해야 합니다. 그렇게 안 하면은 공부했던 것을 쉽게 잊어버리고 그냥 또 다시 배워야 합니다. 시간 뿐만 아니라 돈도 낭비됩니다."
Korean,33fbop,KEH_Linguist,2,Wed Apr 22 04:33:49 2015 UTC,Curious: are 습득 and 지속 common words? Never seen them before until now.
Korean,33fbop,MyJokesArentFunny,2,Wed Apr 22 12:35:29 2015 UTC,"I think 지속 is fairly common, but 습득 I believe is primarily academic in usage. It probably stands out quite a bit here."

Korean,33fbop,MyJokesArentFunny,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:06:40 2015 UTC,"I think this is good, but culturally, my gut feeling is that it would be better to frame things as suggestions, rather than telling parents how to make their kids study. For example ""시간 뿐만 아니라 돈도 낭비됩니다."" is very true, but it kind of implies that the parents are currently wasting their kids time, so I would probably leave that out.    Also, you can change some of the endings to ""...을/를 추천드립니다""    I haven't been a teacher in Korea, though, so this might not be a concern in this context! (Maybe someone else can confirm)."
Korean,33fbop,lazyheroine,2,Wed Apr 22 16:00:40 2015 UTC,These are some good suggestions. Although I think it should be safe enough given that the teacher is foreign and teachers in Korea usually have a decent amount of authority. I actually purposely used the passive 낭비되다 to lessen the implication of the parents actively wasting time and money.
Korean,33fbop,KEH_Linguist,7,Wed Apr 22 16:34:19 2015 UTC,"These are just my suggestions based off of the little I know.   In the first sentence, 떼 is spelled 때 btw, but I would probably use some other grammar instead. Maybe 언어를 잘 배우려면... or 공부하면서...  을 때 is probably fine too to get your point across. But I am unsure what would be the most natural in this context.   I think for the second sentence making use of the -씩 particle would make sense. Although I can't say exactly how.. maybe something like;  일주일에 한번 3시간씩 공부하는 것보다 매일 15분씩 공부하는 게 더 좋을 거예요.  But really, I don't know this stuff well enough, so if someone who actually knows what they are talking about could step in that'd be great! :D  Edit: OH, just noticed this is to the parents! Maybe you should write it more formally? Like with the ㅂ니다/습니다 endings."

Korean,33e1bm,KoreanPhiladelphian,5,Tue Apr 21 19:38:26 2015 UTC,Do you mean writing 한글? Or forming grammar patterns that express your thoughts and writing them down? Or spelling? Or 띄어쓰기?  I think how to improve on each of these things is quite different.
Korean,33e1bm,lazyheroine,1 point,Tue Apr 21 22:47:49 2015 UTC,Spelling and 띄어쯔기
Korean,33e1bm,lazyheroine,3,Tue Apr 21 23:41:47 2015 UTC,"Ok! I'm gyopo, so spelling and 띄어쓰기 have always been my weaknesses because I tend to write things the way they sound (oops).    The thing that helped me the most was installing the Korean spelling/grammar checker in Word and basically doing all my writing in there. Turn off autocorrect (because the point is to learn). Spell check isn't perfect, but it will catch most of your 띄어쓰기 mistakes and  most common words. If you have office 365, it should be free. If you have 2010 or 2013, it's about ~$25 so it's not that expensive. This is probably the best way to improve quickly, because you get real time feedback.    For spacing, I actually memorized some of the rules. It seems complicated at first, but most of the rules are pretty straightforward. To help apply/memorize the rules, there's sometimes apps... For example, 띄어쓰기 in the Android store that looks pretty good.     For spelling, I've found that the easiest way to improve is by just reading a lot. But you have to be actively thinking ""oh I didn't realize that was spelled that way"" and write it into a vocab list, for any real improvement to happen."

Korean,338hjj,Qichin,11,Mon Apr 20 14:54:11 2015 UTC,"So, 10 Korean phrases and their translations?  If their meaning can be explained in a single short paragraph (in those instances where there isn't an actual translation present), I'd hardly call that ""defy translation""."
Korean,338hjj,Qichin,3,Mon Apr 20 14:53:25 2015 UTC,Fair enough. How would you phrase it then? Phrases that are tricky to translate? Phrases that don't exist in English?
Korean,338hjj,feedmefeces,5,Mon Apr 20 19:43:47 2015 UTC,"Tricky to translate can work, or perhaps phrases that don't have a direct translation into English. Anything can be translated somehow."
Korean,338hjj,feedmefeces,3,Mon Apr 20 19:53:06 2015 UTC,Maybe. But it's never going to have the same nuances to it. I like 'tricky to translate' though. Has a nice ring to it.
Korean,338hjj,feedmefeces,5,Mon Apr 20 20:18:51 2015 UTC,What nuance is missing when '치맥' is translated as 'fried chicken and beer'?
Korean,338hjj,bigbirrrd,2,Mon Apr 20 21:20:50 2015 UTC,"I guess because in Korean, they've actually made a new word that's more like chi-beer. Similar to how in English they say 'cronuts,' except that's a new food item, and chi-mek refers to a whole culture surrounding the lifestyle of going out, having fried chicken and beer. Simply saying fried chicken and beer takes away from how Koreans use their language to refer to things."
Korean,338hjj,bigbirrrd,4,Mon Apr 20 21:54:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know. If in English I were to say 'let's go out and have fried chicken and beer', I would also be typically referring not just to what we would be ingesting, but also to the kind of atmosphere of the evening. I think you're viewing English a bit too literally here."
Korean,338hjj,bigbirrrd,1 point,Mon Apr 20 22:18:21 2015 UTC,I see. I've actually edited the post to elaborate on why I think there's more to it than the English version. But it's certainly very interesting to think about.
Korean,338hjj,bigbirrrd,4,Mon Apr 20 22:36:12 2015 UTC,"I've read what you added, and it still seems to me that you are being too literal with your understanding of the English term, and very non-literal with your understanding of the Korean term. I think the mismatch you point out is due to that, and nothing more. They are perfectly inter-translatable."
Korean,338hjj,Qichin,2,Tue Apr 21 00:27:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's possible. I grew up speaking both English and Korean and am certainly biased in my own way. English just seems like a more literal language to me than Korean, but I could be wrong."
Korean,338hjj,bigbirrrd,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:38:02 2015 UTC,"IMO these phrases do defy translation because you can't simply use one word quickly to communicate the same meaning. This seems to be a difference in our definition of translation. If you define it as ""the ability to use one language to define a word in another"" then you're right. These don't defy such a rule. However, if you define it as ""moving meaning from one mind to the other through words"" then these sort of do. 얼짱 for example does not translate to ""Ohhhh great face!"" If you say that in English, you will get a very strange reaction. To make the same kind of remark in English, it would be better to say something like ""great outfit!"" to which the other person is likely to smile. I see translation as a transfer of meaning.     A reverse example is ""makes sense."" Whenever I'm speaking Korean with my wife who speaks both languages fluently, we tend to say things like ""아 그래? makes sense해."" Communicating that same meaning in Korean is totally possible, but the fact that is isn't contained in one simple expression makes it easier to use the English version.   This post I think is meant to highlight these words in comparison to words that translate directly like 행복하다, 어제, 경제 등등."
Korean,338hjj,coriandres,2,Tue Apr 21 00:38:45 2015 UTC,"Wow. You perfectly encapsulated my thoughts here. I think it's also probably hard to understand why these words are not 'directly' translatable if you've never used them in the right, Korean context. Obviously I can try to explain what these words mean, and even do it well, but that doesn't mean there's a direct translation, because the words simply do not exist in English, period. The examples you've provided are perfect."

Korean,338hjj,Crys368,1 point,Tue Apr 21 07:16:17 2015 UTC,"Just to get it right, your definition is a direct, word-for-word translation?  To my understanding, that is very narrow, and it immediately conjures up all sorts of connotations of ""language defines thought OMG!"" and that speakers of one language can't imagine or understand certain concepts. Yes, some languages express some concepts more succinctly, but ind the end, virtually anything can be expressed in any language."
Korean,338hjj,bigbirrrd,0,Tue Apr 21 06:58:07 2015 UTC,"Not really. I mean ""translation"" as in ""the mental process one has to perform in order to convert a thought that originally occurs in their brain in one language but has to be filtered and expressed in another."" This task is so incredibly important for those who can speak both Korean and English because the gaps between so many words and expressions are so large. Although I am a native English speaker and speak Korean quite well, I often have trouble properly translating words... even in English. I was talking to my Dad yesterday and 확실하지 않다 was what I wanted to say but the English phrase for that specific meaning took me ten seconds to get out correct. This is a heavy operation for the brain to perform, and for that reason I believe OP was trying to communicate this meaning through the title used (although I'd like to think we're debating something more important that word choice in the title).   More so than word-for-word I would say meaning-for-meaning is what I mean. For example, the w2w translation of ""meet"" into Korean is ""만나다."" Problem is, Koreans use that verb to communicate some very different meanings that what it means in English. They use it to mean: meet, date, hang out, see, etc. So for them, when they do a w2w translation of the 만나다, they say something like ""Yesterday I met my wife."" A native English speaker hears that and is immediately confused. It implies that they met and married a new woman within the last 24 hours. So in that sense, there are a lot of words that are difficult to translate K <--> E.   The words mentioned in this post are examples of words that are so hard to translate in this way that it's pretty much not even worth trying because what comes out on the other end is noticeably not the same as what the speaker originally intended.   I mean not to be argumentative here but seeing as I live in between these two languages now, I can relate to OP and wanted to contribute to their point."

In my book's first draft, the complete sound change rules appendix came directly after the ""Introduction to Sound Changes"" chapter, but I moved it to the back because it felt really... intense, lol. It probably would've made a lot of people throw the book down and give up if they had to see/learn all of that before even learning the first chapter, so I pushed it to the back :P For the time being though I'd say don't worry much about how the syllables sound together yet - trust me that you'll become an expert at those sound change rules after reviewing them and once you're done with the book. Grammar is the real thing to focus on in the beginning. There are a lot of sound change rules but they're all very intuitive (they are the way they are because it makes words easier to say), but in the beginning are pretty tricky."

Literally, ""the horse of an old man near the frontier,"" while idiomatically representing such pessimism that fortunes and misfortunes are hard to foresee, as of that man, as illustrated as follows:  Fortune and misfortune alternate and complement, being hard to foresee the irony.   Near the frontier there lived a father good at divination. A horse of his accidentally went into the barbarian land; all consoled. The father said, ""Why could this not suddenly go fortunate?"" After several months, the horse came back together with a fine horse from the barbarian land; all congratulated. The father said, ""Why could this not suddenly go unfortunate?""   The house had many fine horses; so his son liked riding them, but at last fell off his horse and had his leg broken; all consoled. The father said, ""Why could this not suddenly go fortunate?"" One year later, the barbarians invaded the frontier, and all able-bodied men took up arms and went to war.   Of those men from the frontier, nine out of ten were killed. It is owing to the broken leg that the father had the son survived. Accordingly, fortune begets misfortune, and vice versa. This goes on forever, its depth being unfathomable.

''우리 아들! 나중에 꼭 대통령이 되세요''. http://vocaroo.com/i/s0mIqrYenYC2  The ㄸ sound and the ㄸ sound, illustrated by the words 때 and 꿈: 그래서 그 때부터 제 꿈은 대통령이었습니다. http://vocaroo.com/i/s0VPzAQn5f27  [Edit] Oh gosh, listening to recordings of myself is really weird. o_o [Edit 2] If you post an audio and you don't get a response in over a day or so, feel free to mention me by putting /u/lazyheroine or PM me so it shows up in my inbox! I'm happy to provide more feedback :) [Edit 3] I suck at not editing my posts, oops. I wrote before that there was a minor typo but I got distracted and wrote the wrong thing. 10년 전의 제 꿈과 지금의 꿈을 많이 다릅니다 <-- X과 Y은/는 많이 다릅니다. It should be 은, not 을, here. [Edit 4] Ahh this deep thinking about pronouncing things is confusing me LOL. I stand by my comments about  ""hmm that sounds off"", but some of my ""do this instead"" comments are probably not clear. So if other users (who have studied the actual pronunciation rules vs being learning from sound) can chime in with better corrections, that would be good! Feel free to reply to comments if you don't know what I mean, I can record audio to demonstrate, which is probably better.  Also, just a note that someone pointed out. My pronunciation of 대통령 in this audio should be more 녕 than the ㄹ/ㄴ hybrid I used.

Not sure how many people will read this but will put this out there in case anyone is browsing the thread later.    I've listened to most (all?) of the speaking on this thread, and I just wanted to comment that most of the people in this thread are very good with pronunciation (except for some of the harder things like ㄱ/ㄲ and ㄹ sounds, which are just fundamentally difficult to make). For many of the advanced people on the thread, the biggest ""clue"" that the person isn't a native speaker is more from the cadence and the way that the sentences flow overall.   So for all of you, to give yourself the extra ""oomph"" that will make everyone go 한국말 잘 하시네요 (heart eyes), try to pay close attention to how the sentences of native speakers ebb/flow. Also, make sure you're paying attention to where you're pausing in your sentences, so that the pauses come in between ideas instead of in the middle of the idea! After listening to a bunch of these, I'm getting the feeling that after you hit a certain level of pronunciation proficiency, I'd argue that this is actually the most important thing that makes someone sound like they are speaking well."

Most foreigners learning Korean, including myself at first, then to equate the following:  ㅈ- j ㅊ -ch ㄱ - g  ㅋ - k ㅂ - b ㅍ -p  But this is actually not the case. These sounds actually fall in between the two english letters sounds. So ㄱ is actually between g and k, I would call it a soft k.   What I did to practice this was record myself saying a word, then have a native record the same word, then listen to them back to back. This helps a LOT. In fact, GoBilly has some audio downloads on his website that you can do this with. Check them out!"

Also, in terms of intonation, although Korean isn't tonal, it sound more natural if you go down to up, rather than up to down 꿈 - your pronunciation of this word is quite good! There are a few times where it sounded a little more like the ㅋ sound, so keep that in mind! 10년 전의 제 꿈과 지금의 꿈 -  for the spacing here, you're going to want to put the pause after the 꿈과 instead of the 의 꼭 - emphasize the ㄲ, like you did for 꿈! 되세요 - elongate the 세 sound to be more like ""say"" 그 때부터 - stronger ㄸ sound 대통령이었습니다 - might be the recording, but sounded like there was a tiny pause between 대통령이 and 었습니다. Try to make the whole phrase without stopping 그래서 - Make the 래 sound a little longer. Sounded a little like 그랬어 here     Overall, I think your pronunciation is quite good. No major issues there. Also, I was wondering, do you happen to talk to a lot of people from 경상도/부산 area? Your intonations/spacing are more like that for some reason! (Keep in mind, I am commenting from a 서울 accent perspective).    In terms of other stuff, I think your spacing of words was sometimes a little bit off. However, this may be because you are reading and getting distracted/nervous from the recording. In general, when you pause in a sentence, try to pause between the actual phrases/clauses, rather than when you need a ""break"".  Great job!"

I can't speak for the intonations but the spacing issues are definitely due to a mixture of distraction, second-guessing, and maybe some dyslexia but I'm going to work on it!

(Well, at least for me it's like that...!)     여러분은 꿈이 있습니까? - Try to enunciate each syllable of 여러분은. They blended into what sounded more like ""열부는"", probably because you are speaking quickly. For 꿈, you're doing great on the ㄲ sound, but make sure you elongate the ㅜ sound and make it more... round (I have no idea if this makes any sense). Your pronunciation sounded more like 끔, with a short ㅡ sound. ---까? - The pronunciation on this syllable is great, but make sure you make it sound like a question! Inflect upattheend! 10년 전의 - This is perfect pronunciation here. For spacing, try not to pause right after this phrase, though. If you want to take a breath, it sound more natural if you say it after ""10년 전의 제 꿈과"" space ""지금의 꿈을"" because the ""10년 전의 제"" are all modifiers for the first 꿈. 제 - This should sound more like ""jeh"", aka shorter vowel. I think your pronunciation is more like ""지"" (jee). 말씀하셨습니다 - enunciate each syllable a little more. I think the 셧 is the part that needs to be enunciated the most (and don't forget the bottom ㅅ sound there!) 꼭 - stronger ㄲ sound here! I think you did it well in 께서 (from the previous line), so try to follow that one! 그 때부터 - 때 should be a harder ㄸ sound. 말했습니다 - make sure you enunciate the ㄹ in 말 제 꿈을 듣고 - for 듣고, more like a ""d"" sound than a ""t"" sound here! 잘 못합니다 - for the pacing here, put a pause after 잘 instead of 못, or else it sounds like 잘못합니다 (to be sorry) 저는 고민을 - Great pronunciation here but make sure you pronounce 을!

Korean,331mwg,lazyheroine,4,Sun Apr 19 04:10:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, casually, I might not use 을 for that context. :) So you can drop it without confusing the listener.     고민을 하다 and 고민하다 are both fine grammatically, but since 많이 is in there, 고민을 많이 하다 is technically more correct.

It should be a little flatter in the Seoul accent 우리 아들 - elongate the 우 대통령 - the last vowel should sound like the english word young, but with a l/r sound in front. It might help if you try to say lllllll (just make the L sound) and then say young, really fast. llll young. lllyoung. lyoung. I think you said it with a ""룡"" or a ""렁"" sound in the audio at some points, which is a different vowel sound. 공부, 고민  - should be more of a g sound than a k sound here! 잘 못합니다 - for the pacing here, put a pause after 잘 instead of 못, or else it sounds like 잘못합니다 (to be sorry)  With the speed, I would slow down on the words so that the spaces in between the words aren't so long. Alternatively, you could just pause less between the words! This will help with the flow and make it sound more conversational. Obviously, no one speaks with a perfectly spaced cadence, but I also noticed that you slowed down in parts of words but sped up in other parts--this changes the way that the word sounds to the listener so try to use the same pace, even if it means slowing down a lot!  Great job!"
Korean,331mwg,lazyheroine,2,Wed Apr 22 00:39:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your help!   For 대통령, I was pronouncing the ㄹ as an 'r' sound, but I gather I should have been doing an 'l'. I've always just guessed when to use r/l so I suppose it's probably worth learning when that distinction should be made! I'll google that now.   I'm hoping that my timing should improve over time as I get more experienced with all the words, at the moment I'm saying the words I know really fast, as I can recognise the 'shape' of the word, but the words I don't know I basically have to read out phonetically, slowing me down - hence the weird fast/slow portions.   Again, thank you so much! I really appreciate it!"
Korean,331mwg,typecfl,3,Wed Apr 22 19:48:47 2015 UTC,re: 대통령  It should be said like 대통녕 due to consonant assimilation (ㅇ 받침 followed by ㄹ results in the ㄹ changing to a ㄴ). That should make it easier to pronounce correctly.
Korean,331mwg,iamkoalafied,3,Wed Apr 22 20:18:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's kind of weird because ㄹ is almost halfway between r and l. I think it's not quite L, but it's more L than R when it's with 려. Grr, it's like the worst letter to explain, ever!!!  [Edit] also if you say it fast it is more like nyoung?   Ah /u/iamkoalafied cited the actual pronunciation rule here!"

The only comment I have is that every time that you said 대통령, you added a bit of an inflection into the word (like 통 is a little.. higher pitched? Not sure how to explain it). It sound be a little more ""flat"".    Be more confident! You sound great :)"
Korean,331mwg,bigbirrrd,2,Tue Apr 21 17:54:23 2015 UTC,"Now that I'm listening to it again, I do say 통 with a bit of an inflection, and...I have no idea where it's coming from, haha.  Thanks for the help!"
Korean,331mwg,iamkoalafied,5,Wed Apr 22 02:20:52 2015 UTC,"My accent's really bad but I tried. Also the passage is pretty long and I got distracted toward the end but I didn't want to rerecord it, haha."
Korean,331mwg,bigbirrrd,3,Mon Apr 20 00:25:56 2015 UTC,"I think /u/bigbirrrd's comments are good here.    I wanted to point 2 things that aren't addressed by that comment: 잘 못합니다 - for the pacing here, put a pause after 잘 instead of 못, or else it sounds like 잘못합니다 (to be sorry) You tend to underenunciate ㄹ 받침. For example, when you say 아들, the ㄹ sound should be clearer. The other place I heard this was 말을 잘 못합니다  Otherwise, your pronunciation is clear and pretty good overall!"
Korean,331mwg,desperatechaos,2,Wed Apr 22 00:44:58 2015 UTC,Thank you! I'll pay more attention to how I say ㄹ 받침 in the future.
Korean,331mwg,lazyheroine,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:08:18 2015 UTC,"I think your pronunciation is fundamentally very good and correct. But there's one thing I notice that could be fixed. Korean's often sort of relax their jaw when speaking. Where as in English, we use the front portion of our mouths a lot (tongue/ lips/ ""ss"" sounds etc.) But relatively speaking, I think Korean is more in the back portion of your mouth.   So you know when you try to suck a milkshake through a straw? Your cheeks suck in and your tongue touches the roof of your mouth. All the free space in your mouth sort of disappears and the ""room"" in your mouth gets smaller. If you do the opposite, and try to blow back into the milkshake, the ""room"" gets larger and your jaw/ tongue muscles are sort of forced to relax as a result. This is the way that I think Korean's speak.  If that was totally confusing, I'm sorry. haha   Another way to do this is simply to touch your jaw muscles on the sides of your face when speaking Korean and make sure they're relaxed as much as possible while still allowing you to make the necessary sounds.   Let me know if this makes sense. _^"
Korean,331mwg,desperatechaos,2,Tue Apr 21 01:15:06 2015 UTC,I'll try it! I'm not positive I understand 100% what you mean but it's something I'm going to try to pay attention to in the future. I also think I should practice shadowing more. I used to do it as a kid and picked up a lot of accents that way. I know it won't be as easy now (especially in Korean instead of English) but if I spent more time doing it my accent should improve. It's weird because I can easily picture a good 서울 accent in my head but I can't make my mouth do it :X
Korean,331mwg,bigbirrrd,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:06:31 2015 UTC,Yea that's okay. That's always the case. It's easy to see that a ballerina is great without being able to dance at all. Shadowing is awesome but recording yourself shadowing is better! Message me sometime if you want to practice these things more specifically. Hope all is well!
Korean,331mwg,NoMarkeu,3,Sun Apr 26 07:50:13 2015 UTC,Here's mine. Reading it was harder than I anticipated. This was like my fourth take lol. Please give me critique!  http://vocaroo.com/i/s0YVqGgL4Uae
Korean,331mwg,lazyheroine,6,Sun Apr 19 00:42:49 2015 UTC,"This post is awesome for procrastinating on my work, haha. :) My comments:     꿈 - The ㄲ sound is very clear in the first and 2nd pronunciation of this! You pronounced it more like 끔. It should have a little more of the 우 sound. Elongate the vowel a little bit more. 10년 전의 제 꿈과 지금의 꿈을 많이 다릅니다 - Enunciate more on the 받침 of the 십 sound, here. Also you pronounced 전 more like 천, so use the softer ""j"" sound. It sounded like you said ""많은"" instead of 많이, but I think that may have just been nerves from recording. 나중에 꼭 대통령이 되세요 - Enunciate more on the bottom sound of 나중에. Elongate more on the 세 of 되세요 (sounds more like 됐어요 the way you said it here). 세 should sound just like the English word ""say"". 그 때부터 - use more of a ""d"" sound for 때, instead of a ""t"" sound 사람 - I think it's because you speak quickly but make sure you're saying each syllable of 사람. Both of these syllables should have a pretty open sound. 저를 - same comment with 사람, make sure you pronounce each syllable 열심히 - enunciate more on the bottom sound of 열 공부 - use a softer ""g"" sound, rather than a ""k"" sound 잘 못합니다 - for the pacing here, put a pause after 잘 instead of 못, or else it sounds like 잘못합니다 (to be sorry) 고민 - elongate the 오 sound     Overall, I think this is quite good as well! I think most of my comments are with enunciating the vowels a little more--you tend to shorten the vowels, especially ones like 우. Also, I think you can definitely make all of the ㄲ, ㄸ, type of sounds, but you sometimes mix up the ㄱ/ㅋ/ㄲ when you're speaking quickly! BTW, this comment looks long, but most of the comments are basically the same comment on different words. So don't freak out at the length!!"
Korean,331mwg,iamkoalafied,3,Sun Apr 19 01:52:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for the detailed answer! 정말 고맙습니다! I'll work on making my vowels more clear and slowing down a little.
Korean,331mwg,lazyheroine,2,Sun Apr 19 02:16:00 2015 UTC,"Hey there. I struggled a lot with the j ch g k b p consonant sounds in Korean too and so I helped with the development of this little listening tool. It's not ""fun"" in that is only shows you your weaknesses, but it's good for training your ear of the differences between these sounds. Give it a shot and let me know what you think:  http://www.mykoreancoach.com/korean-listening-training/"

Korean,331mwg,iamkoalafied,4,Sun Apr 19 02:56:06 2015 UTC,"Hi! Good job! :) 꿈 - make sure you use a hard ㄲ sound! I think the way you pronounce 꿈 is a little between a ㄱ and a ㅋ, depending on which time you say it. You use the ㄲ sound very well when you say ""까"" and ""께서"", so try to apply that same sound with the ㅜ verb ---까? - The pronunciation on this syllable is great, but make sure you make it sound like a question! Inflect upattheend!  10년 전에 - Enunciate ㅂ of 십 more clearly 아주 컸습니다 - Great pronunciation here! 칭찬 - I think you got distracted here :) It should be a ""Ch"" sound, like ching-chan. 열심히 - Enunciate more on the ㄹ    I think most of my comments have to do with making sure you pronounce the bottom sounds and making 꿈 sound more ㄲ~! But really great job overall, there were a few parts where pronunciation-wise, you sounded very close to a native speaker.    In terms of sounding more natural, it will be helpful for you to practice where to ""pause"" in the sentences so that your pauses don't mess with the phrasing of the sentence. This will also come naturally as you study more (you have the 초 flair, so this is not a huge concern right now)  [edit] See the comment thread below about 십년 pronunciation! I think I wrote it kind of confusingly in this critique :x"
Korean,331mwg,lazyheroine,3,Sun Apr 19 04:09:36 2015 UTC,10년 전에 - Enunciate ㅂ of 십 more clearly   Isn't it pronounced like 심년?
Korean,331mwg,iamkoalafied,2,Sun Apr 19 04:45:44 2015 UTC,"In casual convo, yes, you can pronounce it somewhere between a ㅁ and a ㅂ. Since this is a pronunciation exercise, we're going for the ""announcer"" pronunciation so the ㅂ should be stronger. :) But like no one enunciates QUITE that much in normal convo!"
Korean,331mwg,NoMarkeu,2,Sun Apr 19 05:46:59 2015 UTC,Hey! So I was thinking about your comment and relistened and I think the amount of ㅁ in your 심년 is fine. I tend to do a little more in between ㅁ and ㅂ than a straight ㅂ but I was listening to a songs that happened to have 십년  and the singer varied between the two pronunciations (it's a little subtle). So dont worry about that particular comment!
Korean,331mwg,lazyheroine,2,Tue Apr 21 04:37:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the further info (I'm not actually the person who you commented to originally, I was just reading through your replies!). I listened to your audio recording and it really just sounds like 심년 to me, personally (maybe there's a small difference? but it sounds the same to me! haha). 십 년 (with ㅂ being more pronounced/not switching to more of a ㅁ sound) seems like it would be really hard to say while keeping up the flow. I wasn't sure if I was just misunderstanding your reply or not."
Korean,331mwg,random117,2,Wed Apr 22 20:11:37 2015 UTC,"I'm probably just confusing myself because I usually don't speak slowly, haha!   You do want to make an ㅁ sound, but you don't want to exaggerate it, like a full ""m"", which is what I mean by the ""cross"" between an ㅁ and a ㅂ. I think that was what was throwing me off about some of the ㅁ pronunciations in this a few of the audios, but I wasn't sure what it was that was making it sound slightly ""off"" to me.   I hope I didn't confuse a bunch of people with my non-standard explanations! Since I learned Korean at home, rather than in an academic setting, my explanations are probably not as clear as they could be :P For a bunch of my comments, I was like hmm this sounds... a little bit different than how I would say it, but I have no idea how to explain how the more natural way is. Let me just spew out a bunch of words and maybe they'll understand what I mean, haha."
Korean,331mwg,lazyheroine,2,Wed Apr 22 20:28:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can understand it's hard to explain, especially when you didn't really study the language and just learned it naturally. You just meant don't stress/put emphasis on/exaggerate the ㅁ sound, or something along those lines, but I really misunderstood you at first, haha."
Korean,331mwg,random117,3,Wed Apr 22 20:32:08 2015 UTC,진짜 감사합니다! Learning to talk well is quite a difficult front for me due to the dearth of Korean audiobooks. Does audien.com actually sell audiobooks in Korean? When I tried to register it seemed it needs a Korean phone number.
Korean,331mwg,imbrad91,2,Sun Apr 19 05:13:00 2015 UTC,"I haven't really listened to any audiobooks in Korean so I can't help with that site. One thing that might be useful for picking up the pace/tone of speaking naturally would be to watch Korean variety shows and dramas and sort of ""parroting"" back parts of phrases. Also, Korean variety shows often have like phrases that are highlighted and put forward (err I'm not sure how to explain this but it's like they'll have cartoony text of funny things people said on the show) that can really help with learning listening/speaking."

Here are some comments: 꿈 - needs to be pronounced with a harder ㄲ sound 제 꿈과 part - the 제 is more like the j as in jello sound 다릅니다 was pronounced a little like a different word in your version. I think it might have just been an enunciation thing though! 부모님께서 - 께 also needs to be more nasal/hard 꼭 - nasal! hard! 그때 - the ㄸ is a very hard d sound 사람들 앞에서 말을 잘 못합니다 - Enunciate the ""말을"" more  The ㄲ sound is really difficult for non-native speakers to make, so don't worry too much!

Korean,331mwg,cptchi,5,Mon Apr 20 13:16:25 2015 UTC,"Hello! Great job!    꿈, 꼭 - should be more of a hard G sound. Your pronunciation sounds more like ㅋ to me. Remember, in Korean, you have the ㄱ/ㄲ/ㅋ series--the ㄲ is kind of in between ㄱ and ㅋ. 저에게 말씀하셨습니다 - Make sure you say the proper vowels! I think you said something else for 저 and 하셨 here. 대통령 - This is a hard word to pronounce! The last vowel should sound like the english word young, but with a l/r sound in front. It might help if you try to say lllllll (just make the L sound) and then say young quickly. llll young. lllyoung. lyoung.  그때 - the 그  should be the long ㅡ sound, not  ㅜ. Also, 때. Similar to ㄱ/ㄲ/ㅋ, you should remember ㄷ/ㄸ/ㅌ. It should be a harder/sharper ㄸ sound! 정말 - Enunciate more on the ㄹ sound 잘 못합니다 - for the pacing here, put a pause after 잘 instead of 못, or else it sounds like 잘못합니다 (to be sorry) 고민 - should be more like the g sound like ""go""    I think with flow, it was a little choppy, but the flow will come more naturally with time.

Korean,32yxd2,KoreaCat,9,Fri Apr 17 22:36:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. In translation, you miss a lot of the nuances and I'm assuming since she's your mother, she has a pretty good idea of your Korean ability and will know that someone else wrote the words (even if they came from you heart).     It might be good if you started off the letter with ""어머님,"" and then write out the bulk of your apology in English, and then wrap up with a simple ""죄송합니다"". Write what you wrote here but in as simple sentence structure as possible. At the very least, it will set the tone for your letter and she'll understand what you're trying to say, even if she does not understand all of the words.     If you can write some Korean at all (even if it is not at a high level), I would recommend writing a short part of the letter in the Korean that you know. Someone on this sub could then check it for cultural nuances and clarity afterwards, without putting words into your mouth.    Good luck. I hope things work out for you and your mom."

Korean,32xdco,AnaxDenisa,6,Fri Apr 17 14:33:57 2015 UTC,"People already answered your questions, but I'd like to point out that people do not use ""사랑하다"" to say they really really like something. In English, we use ""to love"" for this function, but in Korean you'd use something like 아주/너무/되게/진짜/etc. + 좋아하다."
Korean,32xdco,Inyolight,3,Fri Apr 17 17:22:21 2015 UTC,건 is short for 것은
Korean,32xdco,mujjingun,1 point,Sat Apr 18 02:11:02 2015 UTC,"건 is a thing. 사랑한 is describing the thing. 너를 만나고 is to meet with you. Putting it together is like saying that meeting with you is a thing that I love.  For your second part, 마치 and 처럼 are actually a grammatical construction. So when you see 마치 you can assume that you will see ~듯이, 같다, or 처럼 following it. Rather than thinking of it as 'like .... like' think of them as just being the same grammatical pattern. I would agree with your translation, though. I also found this link on more information on the grammatical use of 마치."
Korean,32xdco,uponaworld,5,Fri Apr 17 15:17:29 2015 UTC,"건 is the shortened version of 것은, which is why it means ""thing""    The feeling of the first line you translated is correct, but the subject/object/tenses are a little off. It's not a complete sentence. Essentially, it means ""meeting and loving you"". 만나고 isn't in past tense, but it should be interpreted as happening before falling in love with the person. ""You"" is implied as the object of the thing that the person loves.    If you wanted to make it a full sentence, you'd have to add something. For example, it looks like from this song, the full sentence is: 너를 만나고 사랑한 건... 운명 같은 일이었지. (Meeting and loving you was like fate/destiny).    [edit] typo"
Korean,32xdco,lazyheroine,2,Fri Apr 17 15:33:21 2015 UTC,"감사합니다! Yeah that's the right song, a great one innit? ;]"
Korean,32xdco,uponaworld,2,Fri Apr 17 15:39:33 2015 UTC,"I can see where you is implied, but I don't think it sounds like he's saying he's falling in love. 사랑을 빠지다 is to fall in love, 사랑한건/사랑한것은 is still a thing that he loves. So wouldn't the previous verb, 만나고 mean that meeting with her could be the thing that he loves, rather than falling in love with her?   Edit: I didn't realise this was from a song! I thought this was through a text - which is why it seemed to be clipped off."
Korean,32xdco,lazyheroine,2,Fri Apr 17 15:40:09 2015 UTC,"In this context, 사랑한 건 is ""the fact that I/he/she loves"" or the ""act of him loving"". It's not really used as a verb, it's a gerund (is that the right word?)     If he loves meeting her, ""meeting"" would be in the direct object so it would have to be ""만나는 것을 사랑한는"" (or choose your favorite ending to this sentence)"
Korean,32xdco,uponaworld,5,Fri Apr 17 15:43:13 2015 UTC,"Okay! I understand that, thank you very much! :)"
Korean,32xdco,lemonfighter,1 point,Fri Apr 17 15:45:49 2015 UTC,"Essentially, it means ""meeting and loving you"".   Isn't it ""Having met and loved you"" (i.e. past tense)? Present tense would be 사랑하는 건."
Korean,32xdco,lazyheroine,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:39:23 2015 UTC,"Yes technically. I wrote it as present because a direct translation is not very precise because 사랑 is the verb and because of the context of the rest of the song.      Having met and loved you could be interpreted to mean in English that they no longer love the person, but in Korean that would be 사랑했던 것. vs a continual action that is implied by 사랑한 것. Example sentence that might be more clear: 그때 부터 사랑한 내 여자친구 would be I loved my girlfrield from that time and implied that I still do     In comparison, if it was 먹은 것, this would be thing that you ate (past tense) and there wouldn't be any confusion in the translation because it is already done eaten (discrete end to the action)      Hope that makes sense!"
Korean,32xdco,ADSRelease,1 point,Fri Apr 17 22:51:28 2015 UTC,"why is it put in that order? like if you said something ""건 사랑한 너를 만나요."" that would be a direct way of saying what /u/uponaworld translated"
Korean,32xdco,lazyheroine,1 point,Mon Apr 20 12:02:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I understand your question. Are you translating English back to Korean?   First the order of your words doesn't make sense for Korean. The word order for sentences isn't the same as in English.    Also, the tense of your verbs doesn't make sense."
Korean,32xdco,ADSRelease,1 point,Mon Apr 20 12:28:37 2015 UTC,"No. 사랑한 is in noun modifier form. It might not be exactly proper, but the form overall is correct. I was going for ""The thing I love is meeting you.""  For example, a sentence I know that is proper (though I'm doing this from memory so it might be a bit off) is ""아침에 먹을 음식은 만들어요."""
Korean,32xdco,lazyheroine,1 point,Mon Apr 20 13:54:42 2015 UTC,"I'm still not 100% sure if I understand your question but I'll try to answer.       건 사랑한 너를 만나요    This does not make any sense at all. The form is neither correct nor proper. It's a list of random words. A similar phrase in English would read like ""love you thing meet"". All of those are words but they don't form a sentence or a phrase. If you take ""건"", then ""사랑한 너를 만나요"" would be okay, but kind of a weird sentence. It would mean I meet you who loved (object of loves is unclear in this sentence).         The way that you would say 만나는 것을 사랑해요 would be the way to say ""the thing that I love is meeting you"". However, in Korean, you wouldn't use ""사랑해요"" to describe this because 사랑해요 should only be used for people. Instead, the phrase with the same meaning that is correct is 만나는 것을 진짜 좋아해요 (with the 진짜 emphasizing 좋아 --> love)        아침에 먹을 음식은 만들어요.     This should be 아침에 먹을 음식을 만들어요 but it's otherwise grammatically correct. I'm not sure what this has to do with the other thing you posted earlier, though."
Korean,32xdco,ADSRelease,1 point,Mon Apr 20 15:50:27 2015 UTC,"they both involve a ㄴ/은, 는, or ㄹ/을 noun modifier. i'm still sometimes unclear on which verb needs to be on what side sometimes with this form, so yeah, we understand each other now.  in general your approach to critique isn't particularly constructive, IMO."
Korean,32xdco,lazyheroine,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:08:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry if I offended you somehow. You argued to me that ""It might not be exactly proper, but the form overall is correct"". I wanted to make it really clear that your answer doesn't work and pointed out why it does not make sense. This isn't a grey area issue and since it's the internet, I wanted to give you a strong response because if you thought that it was correct, it would make your future Korean studies a lot more difficult.  (Your flair identifies you as ""초"")       I'm not sure how I could have been more constructive without being wishy washy on my answer. Also, again, your question wasn't really clear, which is why I corrected the grammar on all of your answer."

Korean,32xdco,uponaworld,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:36:50 2015 UTC,"English is an SVO language. Korean is SOV. This means that verbs always come at the end. Another user mentioned that 사랑한건 in this case is acting like a verb - a gerund. Even so, it was a fragment of a sentence but still understandable. You can't translate English directly into korean with our grammatical patterns because it won't make sense.   So in this case the subject was blank because it was implied beforehand. Korean has a flexibility to it that English does not. It then went to the object (너를) verb 만나고 사랑한건.   I'm on mobile but hopefully this makes sense."
Korean,32xdco,ADSRelease,1 point,Mon Apr 20 13:44:46 2015 UTC,I know Korean is SOV. That's why there's a verb at the end of my proposed change.  The example sentence did not end in a verb. It ended with a noun modifier.
Korean,32xdco,lazyheroine,1 point,Mon Apr 20 13:51:25 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay I saw this other post and I think I might understand your question better.    So your question is why does  ""너를 만나고 사랑한 건"" make sense as a sentence?    ""너를 만나고 사랑한 건"" is actually NOT a sentence. It's a noun clause with a bunch of gerund modifiers, etc. The entire phrase ""너를 만나고 사랑한 건"" is the subject of the rest of the sentence.     I posted this above too, but the full sentence is ""너를 만나고 사랑한 건 운명 같은 일이었지"". The verb in the sentence is 이다 in past tense."

So here it is.  It's about 60/30/10 directly from the site/tts/missing audio. I no longer have the original so this is my slightly modified version of it, sans romanization (which you shouldn't use anyway), slightly changed note format, and a few missing explanations from the original cards since I completely reformat any card I use. All of my additions have been removed because they're not likely to help other people.  Regarding your method, though. My only warning would be to make sure the sentence that you write yourself actually makes sense, especially if you're a beginner. Otherwise you'll end up developing bad habits early on."

I can tell you my chatting has improved since I've used this because I'm recalling all my vocabulary better so I'm not sitting scratching my head and having to double check myself with a dictionary.   Even words I could completely remember when tested (forward and reverse and in sentences) I would completely forget when it came time to use it with my friends, but when it came up on Anki I was a master at it. Generally the more you personally invest in something the more it pays off, vocabulary is my worst area by far so I need to invest more time into it and this has been the most effective thing for me."

Korean,32uw24,Areumdaun,1 point,Fri Apr 17 10:53:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not the original author of the deck but it's a mix of about 3k sentence cards, some vocab and suffixes from the lessons. I'm not exactly sure how to import that directly into Ankidroid, I did the roundabout way of adding it to Anki on my desktop, syncing to my ankiweb account and then pulling it down to my phone from there since I wanted it in both places anyway.

Korean,32q53t,Taehoon,10,Wed Apr 15 20:35:43 2015 UTC,"안녕하세요!  As for 저는 and other pronouns, as long as the topic doesn't move away from you, you can omit it from follow-up sentnces.  Example:   저는 Courage입니다. -I'm Courage 학생입니다. -I'm a student 대학교에 다닙니다. -I attend college.   As for -ㅂ니다 endings, you can create one big sentence by using -고 attached to the stem(in your case, 이) to combine sentences with ""and"".  Example:   저는 Courage이고, 학생이고, 대학교에 다닙니다. My name's Courage, I'm a student, and I attend college.   EDIT: It's important to note that being worried about endings like -ㅂ니다 getting repetitive isn't very important, especially as a beginner. Getting your ideas out should be first priority, especially when greeting/introducing yourself."
Korean,32q53t,CourageNA,3,Wed Apr 15 20:56:03 2015 UTC,"Endings can't get repetitive because that's how the language functions. If you listen to the news in Korea all you will hear is "".....입니다,"" ""....입니다"" and so on."
Korean,32q53t,Unibrow69,3,Thu Apr 16 14:51:49 2015 UTC,"The answer to your question is learn more grammar. In the basics they teach you like this.    저는 ㅇㅇ입니다. 미국에서 왔습니다. 한국에서 삼년동안 살았습니다. 영어를 가르칩니다.    All of this can be combined into one sentence.    저는 미국에서 온 ㅇㅇ인데 한국에서 삼년동안 살면서 영어를 가르쳤습니다.    Common basic connectors are: ~서 ~니까 ~면서 ~는데 ~고 ~을때 ~때문에 ~ㄴ/은/는    There are also a ton of others, but these will give you a good start.  If you need help expressing something specific, let us know."

Korean,32q53t,usemayonaise,2,Thu Apr 16 14:17:10 2015 UTC,"I suggest you look in a grammar book or search the internet for a detailed answer to that question, but:    서, 니까 and 때문데 are like so/because in English.  서 can sometimes be like ""and then"". 을때 and 면서 are kind like while or when. 고 is like and. ㄴ/은/는 is how you make a relative clause in English. 는데 has many meanings sometimes and sometimes but et. al.    There are plenty of other sources that will give you a much better explanation than I can.  I also suggest the website www.lang-8.com .  Posting on their and receiving the feedback will give you a good indication of when you are using things correctly and when you aren't."

Korean,32k4xk,Paradoxa77,44,Tue Apr 14 13:10:49 2015 UTC,"Wow. As a native Korean speaker, I am quite shocked by the sentiments in this thread. TIL. I can now see how it'd be annoying, but I encourage you all to please just respond in a BRIEF, POLITE MANNER (e.g. 감사합니다, 잘 하기는요) and move on, rather than causing the complimenter discomfort that's uncalled for.   I am so sick of hearing this shitty backhanded compliment   I have personally complimented many non-native speakers in this fashion and never meant it in a disingenuous way. Compared to Chinese and Japanese, Korean attracts far fewer learners, so Korean people tend to get very excited to meet foreigners who have working knowledge of our language. Korean people love 칭찬, giving and receiving, so we naturally want to compliment them.  The fact that the OP is seeking to respond in a smartass way makes me think that while she/he may have a good grasp of the language, perhaps she/he doesn't have a very good grasp of our culture. It will just come across as weird and 건방져. If that's your style, I can't stop you, but you will probably experience less Korean hospitality as a result."
Korean,32k4xk,koaladoodoo,14,Tue Apr 14 20:09:46 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on this one. It's better than a grumpy face and ""lol wut..."" It's the little encouragements that help you break out of your shell and become less afraid of speaking.  That said, unless it was really obviously a snarky ironic comment, she was probably just trying to encourage you and was maybe even honored that a foreigner is trying to learn her relatively minor country's culture or language.  OP remember Korea doesn't have anywhere near as many foreigners as the USA. It's possible she really just hasn't seen many foreigners, let alone someone who is trying to learn and speak Korean.   What I'd do is just smile and say ""아~ 아니예요... 감사합니다"" and move on. And heck, maybe even compliment other foreigners with little to no Korean ability for trying"
Korean,32k4xk,prodikl,9,Tue Apr 14 22:24:34 2015 UTC,"Yea I'm kinda surprised too, though I might have missed something haha. Personally I get really happy if a native speaker compliments my Korean! But yea, maybe I am not as good as these other guys haha"
Korean,32k4xk,madmads,11,Tue Apr 14 20:51:55 2015 UTC,"Well, the issue is that in a lot of situations, you have said one or two words, and you're already getting praise. Feels pretty empty. Imagine if someone said 'Hi' to you. Would you immediately say ""Wow, your English is really good!""?"
Korean,32k4xk,rkgkseh,4,Tue Apr 14 21:22:20 2015 UTC,"This is exactly the point I wanted to make. I would really love the praise after more than just 안녕하세요. 반가워요.   I wish it was just more like, ""I'm really touched to hear you using Korean"" or something like that. Because that seems like the real reason why they say that."
Korean,32k4xk,Gobluebro,2,Tue Apr 14 23:55:14 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I can't even imagine how nice it would be to hear anything like that. That would be the best compliment. But they never get creative with it. It's always the same condescending garbage."

Korean,32k4xk,lazyheroine,6,Wed Apr 15 03:16:45 2015 UTC,"I feel like I need to qualify this with my background. I'm gyopo but grew up speaking only Korean at home (literally was not allowed to speak in English) and was sent to Korea pretty much every summer from birth. So culturally, I'm a weird mix of Korean and American.     You make a lot of great points, but this topic is a lot more nuanced than the way you're laying it out here. I don't think that OP is saying that all compliments on his/her Korean ability are ""backhanded"". Instead, the point is that in certain situations, it really doesn't make sense to get complimented and it can be received as being insulting. And OP wants a light hearted way to joke back at the person to relieve his/her annoyance.     You make a fair point about the intention of the compliment-giver. In my experience, the people who will say this type of stuff (to people with whom they have only exchanged ""감사합니다"" and not an actual convo) just have not encountered people outside of Korea who bothered to learn any Korean. Even though more non-Koreans are learning Korean now and encountering someone who looks like a tourist but has actually spent quite a bit of time in Korea is not unusual any more, it's still a novelty. I get why people are like WoWOWOWOwowow! It's definitely not malicious on their part and sometimes I do it if I meet someone with really great pronunciation or who can carry a really intense convo in Korean because multilingualism is impressive.       But you're allowed to have a personality and you're also allowed to have bad days and snap at people. And it's okay to be annoyed at the fact that the compliment is coming from a place where they think you're to silly to know even basic words. Is it polite to snap back? Nah. But heyyyy, we're all people with feelings.          The other point I wanted to make is that sometimes, people are just kind of mean but hide things in ""compliments"". For example, my cousin, who was born and raised in Korea but came to the US for grad school, will openly say things that are totally rude. He's actually said to my husband... ""lazyheroine 정말 한국말 잘 하죠? 신기하죠? ... 옛날에는 진짜 못 했는데. 어렸을 때 이렇게 들렸어요: '안.늉.하.시.유? 나눈 우유 줘.' 근데 이제는 대화할만하네요 호호호"". This is technically 칭찬 but it's also extremely insulting. I'm not just going to say ""아 오빠, 내가 뭘 잘한다고! 나 한국말 잘 못해 히히히"" just because ""culture"".       [Edit] After writing my longwinded response, I just realized what was bothering me about your comment. The way you phrased this, you're making it seem like it's just a cultural thing, you should be flattered, etc, etc. You're ignoring the fact that some people are simply jerks (I mean, there's jerks and impolite people in every culture) and mean it in a malicious way."

Wow, lazy heroine, this is quite an excellent response. Thank you for sharing this. I have always had a hard time expressing my feelings on this issue (hence my rather aloof and snarky tone in the OP) but I think you've helped me a lot. I'm glad you picked up on the nuances of my feelings despite a rather sophomoric post. I'm sure any irritation these comments make me feel is felt threefold by you, being caught midway between both cultures.   /u/koaladoodoo's comment has had me thinking about what ""culture"" even is in this context, and if that ""culture"" is even worth upholding and preserving. It's definitely important to keep a clear distinction between what is an actual cultural background and what is ""simply being a jerk""."
Korean,32k4xk,chantroll,2,Thu Apr 16 10:35:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think you really realise just how many people say this line after only ""안녕하세요"" and ""반가워요"".

I'm sure OP is well aware of all of this and it's naive to assume that he isn't. He's probably asking for situations where he doesnt mind coming across as weird and impolite."
Korean,32k4xk,rkgkseh,2,Thu Apr 16 09:15:38 2015 UTC,"Dude I'm not sure that you get it.  There is complimenting and then there is this annoying crap frequently happens really often any time you speak Korean or know anything about Korea.  Imagine if you said ""Hello"" and several times a day people would compliment you on how good your English is and then immediately try to start speaking to you in Chinese or something.  You would probably feel, as several foreigners in Korea do, that you are not an idiot and it took you about 5 seconds to learn the word ""Hello"" when in fact you have been studying this language for years to get to the level that you are.    Additionally, a lot of the time this comes at a moment when I sucked.  Immediately after completely flubbing the pronunciation a Korean person goes, ""발음이 되게 잘 하시네"".  I suppose they are trying to be encouraging, I really don't know.  If that is their goal then they should compliment me on what I am good at...    Then to add to this, they often continually respond to you English regardless of how what your Korean level actually is.  Commonly I feel as though the person I am talking to is waiting for me to make a mistake just so they can get in with their English.  Again this is completely different depending upon the person.  Sometimes I genuinely can't understand and the person is being helpful, other times I guess they are trying to practice or something.  I don't really get it to be honest.  And honestly, if they were so excited to meet a foreigner who is speaking Korean, then why do they continuously respond in English or show me the receipt rather than say the price?    It is the same when I tell them that I have lived here for years and then they tell me that I probably don't know where their hometown is when it is 홍대 or ask me if I know how to use chopsticks or if I have ever tried Kimchi.  The reason this kind of behavior is insulting is because I am a foreigner.  Despite that, I am not retarded.  Of course I know all of the major districts of the city I have lived in for years, know how to use the eating utensils and have eaten the food that is provided at every restaurant.  None of this is ""신기해"".    Don't get me wrong I get these people are trying to be nice.  I love many things about Korea.  One thing I do not like so much about it is the fact that it is difficult to socially integrate.  Although I am nowhere near the level of being able to do it people always tell me I should go on 비정상회담.  Even if I were at that level, I would never do it because I wish that being a foreigner who could speak Korean was not something that would get you on TV.    Edit: OP don't respond negatively.  Here are some responses you can use. 잘 하기는요. 아직도 많이 부족해요. 아닌 것 같아요. 아직까지 익숙하지 않아요. 아니요. 네, 고마워요. I usually do this while looking down.  If you can make it seem normal, it is easier to move away from them dwelling on it for a long time.    2nd Edit: I think part of it is a language/cultural difference as well.  Koreans will often tell me, ""잘 먹네요"".  Where as if you told someone, ""Wow, you eat really well"", in English it would sound like you thought they were retarded or something."
Korean,32k4xk,chantroll,3,Wed Apr 15 06:43:56 2015 UTC,"Although I am nowhere near the level of being able to do it people always tell me I should go on 비정상회담.   Are they still saying that? Back in August, every one of my Korean friends was saying I should go on that show, but I dunno if it has tanked since the whole 에네스 카야 thing."
Korean,32k4xk,Gobluebro,1 point,Wed Apr 15 12:27:32 2015 UTC,"They say it less than the used to.  There was a period of time when I'd hear it at least once a day, and that has decreased like once a week.  They still often ask me if I've seen it though."
Korean,32k4xk,210493,2,Wed Apr 15 13:33:38 2015 UTC,"Hahahahaha, 잘 먹네요 is more like ""You have a great appetite!"" or perhaps ""You must really like this stuff, huh!""   Otherwise, excellent response. Thank you for your insights. I think you're really spot on here. What it comes down to is that Korea is still getting used to having an international community. Even though they've been open for years, it's always been in a rather segregated way. Very few foreigners came to Korea just to make a new life here, because hey, why would they? It was a developing post-war nation for decades. But now that they've been a major world power (or something to that effect -- not looking for a poly sci debate) for much longer, the number of people starting fresh out here is growing.  Maybe in 20 years we wont have to deal with it as much, hah!"
Korean,32k4xk,MyJokesArentFunny,1 point,Thu Apr 16 10:42:57 2015 UTC,I also agree with this. I saw this video about the topic a while back. The OP could try using 별말씀 이에요 like he says to in the video. I don't believe people would react exactly how he said they will though.
Korean,32k4xk,lazyheroine,-2,Tue Apr 14 23:57:25 2015 UTC,"I think it's hard for Koreans to understand the alienation felt on a daily basis. I don't mind getting the compliment. I actually quite enjoy it, on one condition: I actually display some ability. I love when I get into a taxi, have a lengthy conversation, and just hear the driver casually throw in  ""well, because your Korean is SO good, you'll do great!"" or something like that.  Do you see how I'm talking to you right now? I'm responding to your comment. Imagine if I answered your question with, ""Wow, you're saying words! Good job!"" How rude would that be? Koreans often just ignore what you say because they look at your face. Do they think I'm a 병신?  I'm sure they dont, but they act like it when they get shocked that a non-Korean can learn Korean. I get it, not a lot of foreigners speak Korean, but come on. It's not a private language.   Also I should add the answer does not necessarily need to be rude. Just witty. ""You speak Korean really well."" ""You too"" is not rude, and rather clever. The times I will get rude is when I ask someone a question, and instead of answering me they just say 'Your Korean is good'. I just think, ""Fuck, that's not a compliment, you're just ignoring me""  /u/lazyheroine hit the nail on the head:    OP is asking about how to respond to this comment in inappropriate situations. For example, if you say 3 words at a store and the clerk responds with 한국말 잘 하시네요!!, they're basically expressing surprise at the fact that you, if you're clearly 외국인, even know 3 words and it's super condescending and probably gets old really fast.   So I really want to emphasize this point: it is not about the compliment itself. It is about the OVERWHELMING style in which it is used. Compliments are great, but this phrase is generally not used in a very complimentary way."
Korean,32k4xk,rkgkseh,6,Wed Apr 15 02:56:09 2015 UTC,"My Korean teacher told us to reply with ""잘 하기는요"" I think it's meant to sort of be a polite way of denying the compliment so as not to sound cocky. I'm not sure if it's useable in all situations but I always get a good response when I use it!"
Korean,32k4xk,madmads,2,Tue Apr 14 14:25:33 2015 UTC,"You are correct, although I think OP is looking for more of a smartass remark because hearing ""잘하시네요!"" over and over from simple words does indeed get annoying."
Korean,32k4xk,RPShep,3,Tue Apr 14 15:17:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Korean on that and your teacher's explanation of the connotation is correct. However, OP is asking about how to respond to this comment in inappropriate situations. For example, if you say 3 words at a store and the clerk responds with 한국말 잘 하시네요!!, they're basically expressing surprise at the fact that you, if you're clearly 외국인, even know 3 words and it's super condescending and probably gets old really fast."
Korean,32k4xk,uponaworld,14,Tue Apr 14 15:26:00 2015 UTC,"5/5, would read again  ㄷㄷ ;; Join the chatroom  '한국말 너무 잘하시네요' a running gag in there  One time, I said something like 감사합니다 or whatever to the cashier at a GS25, so she (naturally~_~) replied ""한국말 잘하시네요"". She rang up the change, and read it out in English (I guess she wanted to practice in front of a 외국인), so I told her ""영어 잘하시네요."" She gave me a slightly flustered face while muttering in Korean something like ""I barely said anything... "" (별로 안 했는데요...something like that)  So, perhaps compliment them on the first thing they say in English? ㅋㅋ"

Korean,32ihg5,xxyrana,5,Tue Apr 14 10:47:03 2015 UTC,Wow - North Korea. Just thought I'd add that 이딴/저딴/그딴 is very common in normal Korean. It's not just 이런/저런/그런 but adds a negative meaning to the words. 빤쯔 I definitely still hear (admittedly more often from older people) as well as 프로.

Although now my Korean is vastly superior to my Mandarin, there are still occasional holes in my vocabulary that I fill with Hanja usage.  Sometimes it makes me sound well educated, but usually it's something embarrassingly simple like forgetting the word for something like ""ice"", ""flower"", etc. (얼음, 꽃) and using the Hanja instead (氷(빙), 花(화)).

Also 프로 instead of 퍼센트 seems like an old person word.   Idk if it's like this in 서울, but in 부산 I also rarely here younger people say 전철. It's almost always 지하철."
Korean,32ihg5,secondaccountforme,8,Tue Apr 14 04:25:38 2015 UTC,"Actually, 프로(not 프루) is a loan word originated from Dutch word ""Procent"", meaning Percent. Japan took this Dutch word and Korea took it from Japan.  Also, 전철 and 지하철 are different words. 전철 consists of 電 (Electricity) and 鐵 (Iron), meaning Electric Railway. 지하철 consists of 地 (Ground), 下(Below/Under), and 鐵(Iron) - It's subway."
Korean,32ihg5,dlwhdgns10,2,Tue Apr 14 05:30:38 2015 UTC,"전철 and 지하철 are indeed different words but they're sometimes used interchangeably because the subway system in Seoul is a 전철 that happens to also be a 지하철. (Or at least I think it's electric? It looks electric, haha.)"
Korean,32ihg5,StandardToast,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:51:11 2015 UTC,"it's indeed electric but my understanding was that 전철 refers to the above-ground segments such as most of line one and some of the eastern parts of line two, which you clearly wouldn't call a subway"
Korean,32ihg5,rkgkseh,2,Tue Apr 14 06:16:07 2015 UTC,"Okay, so 전철 is the shortened version of 전기철도 (electric train), whereas 지하철 is the shorted version of 지하철도 (underground train). Therefore, all of the ""subway system"", since they run on electric trains, are 전철. There are parts that can be called 지하철. However, it's acceptable to call all subway system 지하철 in normal speech because saying something like line 1 is sometimes above ground is going into semantics. If you want a very proper and more precise term, it would be 도시 철도 (city train), but this is the type of term you would use on the official government transportation website and it would sound kind of stilted if you used it in normal conversations.    전철 is a larger category because it can include the commuter rail type trains that are used for longer distance travel. In modern cities, all 지하철 fall under the category of 전철 (unless you happen to know of steam powered subway line or something) and all 전철 fall under the category of 기차/철도, which can include non-electric trains.  It's like how city-transport-trains are colloquially called subway systems in English, though parts can be above ground. And it's like how all of the Chicago trains are called the L (short for elevated), even though a lot of the trains actually go underground at various points on their tracks."
Korean,32ihg5,secondaccountforme,2,Tue Apr 14 06:32:15 2015 UTC,"On a somewhat related note, elevated trains (like the ones is Chicago!) are called 고가철도   현재 'L'이라는 이름으로 통칭되는데, 이는 고가철도를 뜻하는 elevated에서 나온 말이다."

Korean,32ihg5,MotivatorNZ,2,Tue Apr 14 05:27:36 2015 UTC,"I guess when I say ""younger"" I probably mean 20-28 year olds because that's the age group of most of the people I associate with. Maybe younger people who are older than that use them a lot, but I rarely hear 억수로 from the younger people I talk to. 프로 maybe sometimes, but not very often."
Korean,32ihg5,UidX,2,Tue Apr 14 09:57:52 2015 UTC,This was based in 1997 but I don't think that would have had an effect on the 사투리. Here's a kid who wrote it in his video. As the guy who is a Korean from 경상도 said below it's still used a lot whether even between young people.

I used to call attention to myself by saying my friend's name followed by ""ya"".  It was kind of a cute way to get their attention.

Korean,32j0b1,KimchiTooSpicy,8,Tue Apr 14 04:21:08 2015 UTC,"For 잊어 버렸어요, I'd say it just means ""I forgot"". I don't feel the ""against my intentions"" connotation, there. Also, 잊어 버렸어 sounds more natural and more casual (for regular situations).    I'm trying to figure out how to generalize the 아/어 버리다 concept, but I'm not sure. Some examples of how to write out the words: 팔아 버리다 - Gone and sold it 먹어 버리다 - Ate it 써 버리다 - wrote it    To me, all of these phrases kind of have undertones of someone going throwing up their hands and being like YOLO or f*** this s*** or fully of 귀찮이즘. Or at least for me, I end up using it when I want to make whatever the verb is sound more dramatic.    Some examples in context: ""차 그냥 팔아 버렸어"" - I sold the car but it kind of has like a sort of ""I was sick of dealing with it"" tone to it. In comparison, 차 팔았어 is more objectively saying I sold the car. ""참고 참았는데... 결국에 그냥 다 먹어 버렸어"", which means I tried to resist but I ended up eating it anyways."
Korean,32j0b1,lazyheroine,2,Tue Apr 14 05:47:48 2015 UTC,"I agree! Naver Korean dictionary says, ""(동사 뒤에서 ‘-어 버리다’ 구성으로 쓰여) 앞말이 나타내는 행동이 이미 끝났음을 나타내는 말. 그 행동이 이루어진 결과, 말하는 이가 아쉬운 감정을 갖게 되었거나 또는 반대로 부담을 덜게 되었음을 나타낼 때 쓴다."" rough translation: (following verbs in ""-어 버리다"" form) 버리다 is used to express a finished action that a preceding verb refers to. As a result, speakers either get to have regrets or become relieved of burdens."
Korean,32j0b1,jayjnu,1 point,Tue Apr 14 06:29:12 2015 UTC,"버리다 is used after verbs to show that the action is completely finished. It is also used to show a kind of happy or sad emotion relating to the verb, which can be picked up through context. It kind of has that ""completely/totally did ______"" undertone to it.   Examples:  쿠키 한만 먹고 싶지만 다 먹어버렸어. I wanted to eat only one cookie, but I ate them all. :(  아! 우산을 잊어버렸어! Ah! I totally forgot my umbrella!  그 타자는 야구공을 날려버렸어! The batter made the baseball go flying (through the air)!  These kind of examples work when you want to show your emotions through 버리다. However, it can also simply mean  an action is thoroughly finished and nothing remains, which doesn't necessarily need to show emotion."

(I can't sleep back again when I wake up at 6~7 due to the noises) And I apologize for being noisy as I sing(성악 : like opera singing), thank you and I request you once again politely!

The alternative interpretation of this is ""오빠, 우리집 비어"" (Koreanization* of the English word Beer), which is like oppa, our house is empty.    *Is Koreanization a word? I mean the opposite of romanization, haha.     [edit] upon further thought, I think the first one is probably the meaning of the joke because saying our house is empty doesn't sound like a good name for a bar. If you say ""오빠, 우리집 비어"" quickly, it's actually pronounced the same as ""우리집이어"" (the slang version of 우리집이야"") because the ㅂ is pronounced with the 이 since 이 is an empty vowel sound. Also, this could have a sexual connotation (ie hey make your self at home, wink wink)."

Let's say someone wants to conjugate 쉽다 into 아/어/여 + 요 form. First they think maybe it's 쉽어요 but it doesn't seem right or they remember there's some other way you're supposed to conjugate that but can't remember exactly how. So they type in 쉽다, scroll to the one that fits the form they are trying to use, and realize it is actually 쉬워요. They don't need to pay attention to the names to do that. Used in that way, it can be helpful imo.  I think dongsa.net is better though. It doesn't have all the clutter nor does it have romanization and it can help you find the dictionary form using the conjugated verb."

Korean,32b81z,kjoonlee,0,Sun Apr 12 22:03:51 2015 UTC,Well in that case all you need is a list of the 6 or so irregular forms and a couple of conjugations each. Probably everything you need can be kept to a grand total of 20 or 30 Korean words. Anything else is overkill. Korean verb conjugations are extremely regular as far as these things go.
Korean,32aftu,QuariYune,9,Sun Apr 12 01:28:40 2015 UTC,"저는 선생님이 있(었)어요 <-- dis fine 저는 선생님을 이에요 <-- dis not  For starters, you cannot ""을"" with 이다. Neither 이다 nor 있다 take the object marker (을/를).  So for your sentences we get ""저는 선생님이었어요"" as the proper grammicalicityness. 이다 attaches right onto the noun, like so: ""저는 선생님이에요"" ""I am a teacher"" 저는 컴퓨터예요"" ""I am a computer.""  When you want to add the honorific, 시, all you do for 이다 is combine it to ""이시다"", so you'd get. ""우리 아버지는 선생님이세요"" ""My father is a teacher."".  Adding 시 to 있다 a different matter, however. There are some verbs that completely change form when you want to add the honorific to them, one of them is 있다. ""있다"" becomes ""계시다"" when you want to add the honorific. ""지금 어디 계세요?"" ""Where are you right now?""    As for 이다 vs 있다 and their meanings--  이다 is ""to be"" as in ""I am a cat"" or ""I am a teapot short and stout"". 있다 is ""to exist"" as in ""I exist on planet Earth"".  So why is 있다 used for ""having"" in Korean? Well the short answer is because Korean is not English, things are different welcome to learning a different language, not all the things are the same. In Korean you would say ""저는 연필이 있어요"" for ""I have a pencil""-- notice that in Korean, the subject of the sentence is the pencil, but in English the pencil is the object... But they mean the same thing! Crazy huh.  This whole topic / subject marker thing is going to be quite confusing for a while, I'm not gonna lie, but keep at it, and don't forget to watch this video. Learn Korean Ep. 9: Topic and Subject Markers  P.S. Oh, also you should switch to TTMIK, there's a reason that we don't have howtobebadatkorean in the beginners resource thread, and it's because he explains things weird.

Oh and for the last question, I wasn't really wondering about why 있다 and 이다 were different. I was just wondering why 이다 is used mainly as (이+에)요 rather than like most others (이+어 / 여)요. Sorry for the confusion!"
Korean,32aftu,Trevarr,2,Sun Apr 12 01:50:07 2015 UTC,"시 is completely different than 요 and ~ㅂ니다. When you say ""honorifics"" in Korean you are referring to things like 있다 becoming 계시다. When you say ""politeness"" and ""formality"" it refers to things like the 요 ending (polite ending) and ~ㅂ니다 (formal ending).  이다 and 아니다 just do that. They're technically copulas, rather than ""verbs"", if that helps you remember that they're different. 이다 becomes 이에요 or 입니다 and 아니다 becomes 아니에요 or 아닙니다  If you really really want to say ""여"" with 이다 then you're either going have to get to a more advanced grammar point or start speaking dialect, but we'll worry about that later, haha~"

Korean,32aftu,hnkim0602,1 point,Sun Apr 12 02:06:35 2015 UTC,Trevarr already pointed it out but I just want to make sure it's clear that honorifics are not what you seem to think it is.

It's basically a linguistic phenomenon in which the speaker shifts his or her normal spatial point of reference. English allows this for verbs of movement but Korean does not.  Both 'come'/오다 indicate movement toward the speaker. However, in English, I can say ""I'm coming (to you)"" because I've shifted the reference point to you. It's as if you were the speaker. I cannot say *(너에게) 오고 있다 because the reference point can only be me. Any movement must be movement toward the speaker. I know this might be a bit confusing, but I think it's interesting."

Korean,323ayf,justanotherotaku,9,Fri Apr 10 05:58:40 2015 UTC,"What you've given there is the formal conjugated form of 하다.  Korean has variable speech levels and politeness based on status of the speaker and listener(s). For instance, if a speaker is older they don't necessarily have to be as polite to a younger audience listening; whereas the younger audience would probably have to be more polite to the speaker in their conjugation.  What do I mean by this?  If you're speaking to an elder you may use 합니다 whereas that same elder may use 해요 back to you, or less.  Now I sprinkled ""necessarily"" and ""probably"" into my answer because these factors can be negated by intimacy, or perpetuated by it.  Certain endings show how intimate you are with someone. You aren't formal to your friends, so using a formal ending can seem distancing (even though it shows respect). Likewise you wouldn't use an intimate ending with someone you don't know. However, you aren't really formal to your family in English are you? Well, you must be in Korean. There is a cultural aspect too (plus it's not really that present in English to begin with).  So now we have two factors, and more: age, intimacy, social status etc... coming into play to determine what kind of ending you should use with someone. The general rule is that if you are polite (~요 endings) everything will be okay so if in doubt use that.  This concept may sound complicated but it's nothing you should focus on learning the rules of, but rather learning it in practice. See how people talk to other, copy it. It's going to be the same (most of the time).  TTMIK has a nice episode on it and you can Google the terms 반말 (casual and polite) and 존댓말 (formal) to discover more.  There's also a nice site you can use to check your conjugations (it has most verbs on it): http://dongsa.net/  But like I said please do not sit down and learn that ""oh okay talking to someone higher than me at a company that I kind of don't know so I must be polite or formal"". This is not a hard concept to learn if you just learn to write and speak the language, and let it naturally develop through the examples of, and material you absorb."

Korean,321peb,Paradoxa77,9,Thu Apr 9 21:36:10 2015 UTC,"To my understanding, it's like being aware of others in an interactive situation, like being socially awake and socially keen.   So in this situation, the OP lacked 눈치 because he didn't pick-up on/conform to the working late thing. I wouldn't call his lack of conforming the 눈치 issue, but the fact that he chose to ignore it and didn't think that sticking out this way would get him in trouble.   It's like telling a joke in a crowd you know is offensive, and assuming that you still won't get in trouble."
Korean,321peb,tkdjdgrl,3,Thu Apr 9 21:55:44 2015 UTC,"In addition to your valid comment, 눈치 may have non literal meanings when combined with certain verbs. When it comes to the linked post, the 눈치 in working environment carries a meaning of social or organizational intimidation, while 눈치 of 눈치 채다 simply has something to do with ""awareness"". We need to take a look at an expression ""눈치 주다"". 눈치 of 눈치 주다 stands for giving a oppressive gesture that prevents one from doing sth. For example, when you want to say something stupid to a crying women, a wise friend of yours can give you a 눈치 to stop you. Therefore, when the OP's colleagues mentioned 눈치, they were worried of his inability to take notice of the 눈치 given by their boss and colleagues."
Korean,321peb,jayjnu,2,Fri Apr 10 07:06:20 2015 UTC,"So I feel like people talking about ""the noonchi problem"" really don't get what they're talking about.  For what it's worth, though, that overtime problem really sucks and makes me want to leave Korea as well."
Korean,321peb,rkgkseh,5,Fri Apr 10 00:03:30 2015 UTC,"Hmm, it's kind of stupid because people seem to be accusing the OP of having bad 눈치, but the OP was clearly aware that no one was happy with him not staying for overtime. The OP simply did not care that they were mad at him. So, it wasn't a 눈치 problem, it was just a nonconformity problem."

Korean,321peb,EkoKorean,4,Thu Apr 9 22:37:11 2015 UTC,"I agree that 눈치 is social awareness or social intelligence, but there's something missing: that's the willingness not only to take social hints, but to act on them.  When the fellow in the other thread was said to lack 눈치, what they were saying was that his unwillingness to act on social queues was equivalent to being entirely unaware of those social queues.  I would venture to say that the constant vigilance that requires one to behave according to perceived 눈치 is one of the main reasons Korean people tend to report dissatisfaction in their working and (extended) family lives.  The fellow in the thread OP referenced is well aware that the rules of 눈치 say he should pretend to be super-busy and swamped at work all the time, stay late, and kvetch with coworkers at every opportunity. He chose consciously not to do this. Did he lack 눈치? No, he had enough 눈치 to know he was going against the grain.  His biggest error in judgement was misunderstanding that his bosses and coworkers in Korea care at all about the quality of his work relative to the 눈치 problem. When you behave contrary to 눈치, everything else takes a back seat.  The expression ""be so good they can't ignore you"" hardly applies in Korea if you break the rules of 눈치."

Korean,321peb,Night-watcher,3,Fri Apr 10 08:25:58 2015 UTC,I always thought that tact would be a good word for 눈치
Korean,321peb,KEH_Linguist,2,Thu Apr 9 23:50:07 2015 UTC,"It is and it isn't. I like that word too, but 눈치 is slightly different. Tact is more about being tactFUL, as in acting appropriately for a situation. So a 눈치 빠른 사람 would be tactful. When people say ""눈치 빠르다"" they seem to be talking about understanding the situation at hand.   Furthermore, tact is more about being polite, not stepping out of line, etc. 눈치 can be as simple as filling up someone's water glass at just the right time."
Korean,321peb,MyJokesArentFunny,3,Fri Apr 10 00:13:01 2015 UTC,Social-awareness
Korean,321peb,MyJokesArentFunny,3,Fri Apr 10 03:02:59 2015 UTC,"There are actually two different meanings of 눈치. The first is a social awareness. The second is an attitude that represents the expression of a hidden emotion or thought. References to 눈치 채다 or 눈치 빠르다 are the first meaning. The references in the post in r/Korea seem to mostly be the second meaning. The 눈치 problem isn't a problem with the person's lack of 눈치 (awareness), it's a problem with the 눈치 (attitude) of others. In this context, it can be understood as a negative or critical attitude."
Korean,321peb,OptimusYale,5,Fri Apr 10 18:41:26 2015 UTC,"People always overthink this word and make it out to have some magical, mysterious, difficult meaning.  In actuality, it just refers to your ability to recognize the situation properly and also to take hints."

However, our levels seem to be much different in that Koreans were completely comfortable having full conversation with me in Korean that they didnt care as much to use English (unless they were already fairly fluent in it).  So..keeping in touch with those you know and just using Korean with them as much as you can is a big help, especially if there aren't many Koreans in your hometown back home; you will have people to practice with."

Korean,321j7h,gizmo327,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:57:22 2015 UTC,If you're just trying to find a Korean language partner I highly recommend the app HelloTalk. It's on iOS and Android. Friend as many Korean people on that app as you can until you find the right partner. It took me a while but I eventually found some native Korean speakers that were willing and able to communicate in both English and Korean. Once you've made friends on HelloTalk it's probably easier to switch over to KakaoTalk to continue communicating.   TL;DR - Use the HelloTalk app to find a decent language partner. But it takes time to find a good partner.

Korean,321j7h,chococrisp,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:59:40 2015 UTC,"After I got back from my year abroad last summer I continued studying on my own through various textbooks & memrise and have been able to slowly improve over the past year. Of course, the pace at which I have been picking it up is much slower than it was when I was actually using the language every day and going to intensive courses, but it has improved nonetheless.  I made sure to stock up on Korean textbooks before I left and have been using Ewha Korean 5 and 6 to practice. Last semester I had a tutor who was a Korean exchange student from Seoul National Univ who worked with me through the Ewha 5 book. I offered to pay him but he said he would do it for free as long as I helped him w/ English, so it was a pretty good deal. We met 3 times a week, 2 times for Korean tutoring 1 time for English; usually 2 hours of study for Korean. I don't have a tutor this semester but haven't had much time anyway, unfortunately. I'm slowly working through the Ewha Korean 6 book on my own.  I also use memrise for vocab, and some other books like TOPIK Master, Korean reading workbooks, webtoons, etc. As for speaking, I meet with two friends for language exchanges and often talk to my boyfriend in Korean - usually nothing too complicated, though, so my speaking abilities have kind of stagnated while my reading has definitely gone up. Writing and listening..eh...still working on it."
Korean,321j7h,feedmefeces,1 point,Fri Apr 10 04:37:30 2015 UTC,"I did level 1A at Sogang a couple of years ago through their summer program, so I feel like I can offer some advice. Before leaving Korea I bought the 1B books so that I would be able to finish the level on my own. The most difficult part for me was setting up a study schedule and sticking to it. I ended up going through the books at a pace that was similar to the pace in which the books are taught at Sogang, mainly because that's what I had gotten used to and I happened to have enough spare time to do it. Sogang places a lot of focus on conversational skills, but I didn't have a tutor so I'd just do the dialogues in written form and/or speak to myself. Answer keys for the workbooks can be found online with a bit of googling. For the writing/essay sections you might want to try lang-8.com. I continued with the Sogang books up to level 3A before I got bored, and then I switched to the Korean Grammar in Use books. The first book in the series is for beginner and early intermediate students, so I reckon it would be a good way for you to refresh your memory. Most textbooks come with audio CDs and I would recommend that you utilize those in your studies for listening practice! Then there are smartphone apps like HiNative and HelloTalk that are really useful for practicing a little on the go, so have a look at those. Hmm, yeah.. Like I said, the most difficult part for me was setting up a schedule and sticking to it. As a self-instructed learner you have to be your own teacher in a way, so you need to have an idea of where you want to go and what you want to accomplish. You'll be fine as long as you can figure that part out for yourself. Let me know if you have any questions! :)"

Korean,320gkl,Paradoxa77,0,Fri Apr 10 00:48:19 2015 UTC,"I suppose so. But there's a difference between saying ""Hmm..."" and ""Well..."" versus ""Uhhh..."".  Fillers come from starting to say something but not having a proper train of thought first. So if you just say 그... 그... you want to say ""That's... (blahblahblah!)"" but you don't have anything to say yet. It's better to stay quiet until you're ready to speak. These are just good speaking habits in general.  If you really want a filler, you can say ""글쎄요..."" which essentially means ""Hmm, let's see..."" or ""Let me think about it...""  It's more of an actual response that gives you thinking time without sounding disorganized. Again, these are just good speech habits, which should be valued especially when learning a foreign language. You will sound more natural, not less, if you have well-thought and eloquent responses versus appearing to be conjugating verbs in your head."
Korean,320gkl,durand101,2,Fri Apr 10 03:03:03 2015 UTC,"Well, I count things like 글쎄요 as a filler. Umms, uhhs and ""like""s are not appealing en masse but they still make you sound more natural if you use them conservatively. If you are constantly silent, the conversation will probably sound very stifled... (That's just my opinion.)"

We have a few koreans who are in American time zones too so it also evens out sometimes..
Korean,31voga,imbrad91,2,Wed Apr 8 16:13:47 2015 UTC,Your timing is just bad :-) It can get extremely busy and the #korean chatroom will become just a giant wall of Korean text on some days.

When the movie ""엽기적인 그녀"" came out, the English translation was ""My sassy girl"". So, ""엽기적이다"" could work, even though I don't really agree with. How about ""튄다"", as in ""아, 쟤는 좀 튀는데? (남다른데가 있는데)?""? Or, you could use ""발랄하다"", meaning ""very positive"".  If you are looking for an equivalent from sexual side of the meaning, ""관능적이다"" may work, even though it might translate into ""sexy"".  That's all I can think of, for now."

Why is Hanguk written like it is? In the photo, the left is correct and the right is incorrect, but whenever I first was starting I thought that the 'k' sound was made with the 'double-bar g'."
Korean,31iyhp,ChaoChai,2,Fri May 8 20:12:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because the bottom ㄱ isn't really a K at all. ㅋ's are aspirated and they are romanized as K. It's easy to learn to basics of Korean phonics, but actually surprisingly difficult to master, because there are all kinds of ""hidden"" rules that you gradually stumble into. Consonant assimilation is a big one that catches a lot of people out, and there are several individual rules, so here's a link on that. What you're referring to is basically 받침, whereby consonants sound different when they occur on the ""bottom"" or at the end of a syllable block. Here's another link for that, but the gist is that consonants ""stop dead"" when they have no subsequent vowel to ""sound into"". It's really hard to communicate this effectively in text, I really need to be sat in front of you, but just bare this in mind, listen out for it and you will gradually get it."

Korean,31gtcf,IIFiredlyz,8,Sat Apr 4 23:11:58 2015 UTC,Practice. Find a penpal/conversation partner. Hellotalk is a good app for this.
Korean,31gtcf,dj_pocketchange,4,Sat Apr 4 23:23:40 2015 UTC,Commit yourself fully to only speaking Korean.  If people try to talk to you in English tell them you don't speak it.
Korean,31gtcf,chunklight,3,Sun Apr 5 13:55:38 2015 UTC,Hellotalk was already mentioned so I recommend downloading the memrise app to your smartphone (if you bring it to Korea). Even if you have no data there you can still download the courses you choose for offline access.  It was nice for me because I had something to do in the subway instead of looking at the people who were staring at me.   I also recommend if you had the extra time to sign up for some kind of Academy or Institute for learning Korean more if you really want to learn Korean faster and you're passionate about it. For me there is no other classes I can take at my University after Korean 102 and tutors and Academies are hard to come by. So I would really love to go to an Academy or Institute in Korea. Everyone that I have heard about going there has improved a lot.
Korean,31gtcf,Gobluebro,3,Sun Apr 5 01:14:30 2015 UTC,"Memrise is pretty solid for vocabulary. Actually someone mapped out my entire textbook that I'm using in my college course in there, so it comes in super handy for me. (http://www.memrise.com/course/44714/integrated-korean-beginning-1/)  Conversation partners are super important though. I haven't had a regular one, but I noticed when I'm able to go to my 선생님's office hours, it really helps. Pronunciation, memory and everything. Plus, with one-on-one, you learn a lot more vocab than what is just in the book. HelloTalk is really nice, but try to find a korean partner irl if it's possible."
Korean,31gtcf,thegigglepuss,3,Sun Apr 5 05:39:57 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm using the same memrise course for my college class haha.

Don't bother with the general 'langauge exchange' meetups, as you'll just be swamped by people looking to practice English there.  Also, when people on the street or in shops start speaking English to you (as they absolutely will), say 'sorry, I'm Hungarian, I don't speak English well.'

Korean,319uxv,secondaccountforme,-6,Fri Apr 3 04:48:26 2015 UTC,Honestly spacing isn't that necessary with 한글 either. It hardly aids comprehension for me. Whenever I write an essay I usually add most of the spaces after I finish.
Korean,319uxv,kpajamas,6,Fri Apr 3 05:57:43 2015 UTC,"Well the examples in ops post affect comprehension. But as with pronouns, Koreans tend to rely on context clues so it's not an issue if spacing is off"
Korean,319uxv,secondaccountforme,-6,Fri Apr 3 06:27:58 2015 UTC,I mean you really don't need that much context to figure out the meaning even in the examples. I think it's a stretch to say it affects comprehension.
Korean,319uxv,zaggeh,4,Fri Apr 3 06:46:09 2015 UTC,"That sounds completely like a gigantic waste of time. Adding spaces AFTER you finish? Why not just do it right from the start?

Korean,319uxv,secondaccountforme,0,Fri Apr 3 13:24:43 2015 UTC,"I don't mean like all the spaces. I type all the logical ones.

By that I mean I type my essays with texting style spacing, relatively minimal, and then add in the rest after."

This website is decent for verb conjugations like what you're doing. Also, this website is decent for looking up vocabulary words. Keep in mind, a lot of words are used differently. For example, in English we might say ""when I was younger I had dogs"" but in Korean the equivalent phrase would use the word that literally translates to raised i.e. ""when I was younger I raised dogs"" Therefore, in addition to your korean studies of grammar, I highly suggest finding a Korean language exchange partner to help you along.

Korean,316sek,ScatmanKyle,4,Thu Apr 2 13:16:47 2015 UTC,"I've seen a couple of pronunciation remarks come up in the past, so here's a link to a quick rundown on the different pronunciation rules for Korean.  To answer your question,   Is there a way to tell if something is silent, or is it learn as you go?   the only time anything is silent is when a double consonant appears in a syllable: 읽다, 밝다, 옮다, 값. In these words, one of the consonants in a 받침 pair is omitted. This isn't always true for things like 많다, 않다 since another rule supercedes this ""silent-ness"". In any other case, no syllable is rendered silent or unspoken.  In your example, 학년 doesn't have a silent syllable but rather follows a rule (found in the website I linked) called nasal assimilation. 학년 isn't pronounced phonetically as hak-nyeon but rather as hang-nyeon since ㄱ in 학 immediately follows ㄴ, a nasal consonant. This rule is also active in jabe1127's example 감사합니다.   EDIT: a word"
Korean,316sek,Wzzch,1 point,Thu Apr 2 15:09:57 2015 UTC,"That's a nice link. I just want to point out that a lot of these rules make a lot of sense when you try to say words smoothly and quickly. Saying 학년 syllable by syllable is really awkward because at the ㄱ you have to stop making a sound and then move your tongue for the ㄴ, whereas pronouncing 항년 is basically the same movement in the tongue but smoothed out. Same for most of the other rules.  I guess its a bit confusing writing syllables so explicitly (which comes from Chinese) even though Korean speech blends fluidly with the next syllable or work (unlike Chinese)."
Korean,316sek,climb026,1 point,Fri Apr 3 05:07:12 2015 UTC,"The funny thing is that a lot of these pronunciation rules come very naturally, given that you practice with a native speaker or some similar situation. For example, I don't think about tensifying ㅂ to ㅃ in 몇번. But you're definitely right that most of them ease pronunciation very well.  The great thing about Korean is that there's hardly any exceptions outside of the pronunciation rules. Given that there are some that exist, Korean isn't phonetically perfect. But the fact that you only need to learn a couple of rules to be able to pronounce 99% of the words is pretty damn convenient. Makes English seem like Chinese in terms of all the different exceptions and sorts. ㅎㅎㅎㅎ"
Korean,316sek,Wzzch,1 point,Fri Apr 3 11:41:16 2015 UTC,"I am very new to my Korean studies, but from what little I have learned so far, I have just assumed(or figured) that most of the time you wouldn't be actually incorrect in pronouncing the silent consonant in most words, it is just silent in speech because it would require more mouth movement.  So I just assumed that over time, words that could be shortened, were so because it makes it easier to say in a sentence.  Like in the phrase Thank you, 감사합니다 . The 합니다 to mean would read Hab(or Hap) Ni Da. But when I hear Koreans speak it I hear Ham ni da. So I just assumed that the m/n sound comes from your mouth preparing the next syllable.  I would take someone more experienced advice though, This is just how I am wrapping my head around it. I hope I'm not entirely wrong.  EDIT: Would brought me to this conclusion really was listening to Korean News Broadcasts. Just like in the U.S most people on the news speak very clearly and enunciate very well. I find it easier to pick out words I have learned  in Korean from the Korean news casts, as they tend to be a tad bit slower and enunciate very clearly(at least from what I can tell)"
Korean,316sek,jabe1127,2,Thu Apr 2 14:48:26 2015 UTC,"You're partially correct. I believe the pronunciation of 합니다 as 함니다 is called consonant assimilation, and it's very common in Korean. In OP's example of 학년 too, it's pronounced 항년 as a result of this assimilation so it's not actually silent. If you pronounce these the way they're actually written, it would sound weird."
Korean,316sek,desperatechaos,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:20:04 2015 UTC,"Not only is it common in Korean, it's quite common in many, many languages. Even English has its fair share of it: dogs is pronounced like ""dogz"" and not how its written, despite the plural marker being the sound -s.   But we have it all over everywhere else, as well. ""this shoe"" becomes ""thish shoe"" (it's tough to say this shoe!) - but all of this feels so natural, and isn't a ""rule"" we learn. But anybody who speaks a language where s->sh is normal might have trouble remembering to do this! Just as we'd have trouble doing nasal assimilation naturally... (Even though we often have it as well... ""good night"" in most speech is a good example, I think.)"
Korean,316sek,mysticrudnin,1 point,Thu Apr 2 21:16:59 2015 UTC,"There are no silent consonants by rule. Only by modern omission on personal or regional levels. (eg 감사합니다 ☞ 감쌈니다).  However when two are on the bottom 받침 and the next is a consonant, you cannot say all of them. You need to pick one.  옮다 ▶ 옴다   읽다 ▶ 익다  But 옮아 is still 올마. 읽어 is 일거. Even though English speakers have no problem saying ""milked"" ㄹㄱㄷ cannot all be said together in Korean."

Korean,315417,Paradoxa77,2,Thu Apr 2 05:47:35 2015 UTC,And where does 개발 fit into all this?  Thank you for posting this. I can never ever get these words straight in my head even though I learned them a year ago.  Now if only I could sort out 발견 분명 and 발명
Korean,315417,shank86,7,Thu Apr 2 04:25:24 2015 UTC,"If it helps: 開發(개발), 發見(발견), 分明(분명), 發明(발명)  Knowing Hanja really helps to sort some of these differences out, because you are able to know the meaning of individual characters.   발(發): This actually has many meanings, but in general, think of something coming about, and yes, developing.  개(開): This means to open and/or start.  The difference between 개발(開發) and 발전(發展) is the connotation of something starting, or more specifically focusing on undertaking an action, developing. In Chinese there is 開發人員 (개발 인원, not sure if this word is used in Korean often) which means ""developer"". Read more of /u/sainthkh for a better description.  견(見): this means sight or vision.  When something comes about, into your sight, you discover it. A more natural word in Chinese is 發現(발현), though 현(現) refers to the present, putting the emphasis on when it is discovered, commonly used to mean newly discovered.  분(分): This means to separate. It can also mean piece or part.  명(明): This means bright, as the character contains both the sun and the moon. It can also mean bright in terms of intelligence.  When put together as 분명(分明), it means clear in the sense that it is clearly defined and understood. In a literal sense, it is split in to it's parts and it is bright.  Last but not least, 발명(發明) is invention (and like all of these words can be used with 하다, in this case meaning invent). Generally speaking, it means that something bright, intelligent (even just an idea) has come about.   Hope this helped. I understand if you don't want to learn Chinese characters, but just taking the time to break down Sino-Korean words can help quite a bit with helping definitions become easier to distinguish, especially between similar sounding words."

The one confusion I have is that I see inventions (발명) as new insights, and discoveries (발견) as a new space coming to light. You could understand either word as either charactee. 견 and 명 are so close, but ill try and remember 발명 as that 분명한 ""Eureka!"" moment."
Korean,315417,MyJokesArentFunny,1 point,Thu Apr 2 14:18:44 2015 UTC,"I see, I guess my understanding was that you can 발견 a new continent or something if you're an explorer, and you can 발명 a new way to navigate on a boat (say, more accurate than GPS currently is), but you can't 발견 this new way to navigate, just as you don't really 발명 a new continent, it was there to begin with. Does that help?"
Korean,310z71,princetonwu,7,Wed Apr 1 06:30:40 2015 UTC,"On the beginner level, you shouldn't need to worry about stresses. Korean is mostly stress-free in terms of proper pronunciation. However, incorporating the accent, speech patterns, and other nuances will create the sense of requiring stresses on certain parts of your sentences. The language's cadence will make it appear so.  I guess the best way to go about it is to first try to pronounce the words all monotone (even/level tone). It might sound awkward at first, but I think that will get you going for the reading portion. Once that's taken care of, listen in on some conversations and attempt to replicate the accents and pronunciations you hear. That will set you onto sounding more natural and Korean-y^^"
Korean,310z71,Wzzch,1 point,Wed Apr 1 06:49:41 2015 UTC,"i tried doing monotone , but it became awkward when I have a long sentence (sounded like a robot). I'll try to practice more"
Korean,310z71,Wzzch,2,Wed Apr 1 16:10:21 2015 UTC,"I know how that sounds, trust me. I have a Chinese friend who happens to be fluent in Korean but wanted to get his language requirement out of the way. So he took a Korean beginner course and faked his inability to speak by chopping up his rhythm and pronouncing every syllable monotonically. I'm going to guess that the way you spoke those sentences is almost identical to his. It was hilarious because it sounded way too awkward for anyone, but the point shouldn't be to sound Korean. Not yet at least. As long as you can get out of the tonal mindset, any method you find comfortable should be fine."
Korean,310z71,jrroelle,7,Wed Apr 1 18:25:06 2015 UTC,Don't stress any syllable within a word and you'll sound more natural than 90% of English native speakers.
Korean,310z71,climb026,3,Wed Apr 1 14:14:57 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about analyzing it too much. Listen to a lot of Korean on TV or whatever just to get the sounds in your head. Then try to copy specific sentences. Some books come with a recording of the dialogue, copying their stress is really good practice."
Korean,310z71,signfang,2,Wed Apr 1 10:05:40 2015 UTC,"There are some cases like 헌법, which you should pronounce as 헌뻡, that you should be aware of. But this is mostly a matter of perfection rather than a learning process."

Korean,30z2nv,please_leave_soon,17,Tue Mar 31 21:25:20 2015 UTC,"Compared to Spanish, Korean is a nightmare. A fun, addictive nightmare  edit: Actually, to elaborate. What I find the hardest is actually the vocabulary. The grammar is complicated, the pronunciation is ""weird"", but learning all the words just feels impossible. Apart from the obvious loan words you have no help coming from English as they're mostly based on hanja. In Spanish I had a rough 6 months where I had to learn all the basic words and grammar, but after that everything just clicked. I'm never gonna have that click in Korean, because even after 2 years of learning it I'll still hear a word I've never heard before and I'll have to go ""sigh what does that mean?""."
Korean,30z2nv,sgebb,3,Tue Mar 31 22:50:05 2015 UTC,"Actually, my understanding – and I could be very wrong here, so bear with me and please feel free to correct me – is that learning the Chinese ""roots"" of some Korean words can really help. Even if you don't know the hanja of it, you can still learn to recognize common hangul characters between words.  For example, in some places 자 (hanja 者) means ""person"" (especially a person who does something).  So from ""응답자"", in which ""응답"" means ""response"", you might be able to guess a meaning of ""respondent [i.e. person who responds]"".  From ""봉사자"", in which ""봉사"" means ""[public] service"", you might guess a meaning of ""someone who provides a service"" (in this case, a volunteer).  By extension, even if you were also unfamiliar with ""응답"", you might be able to guess its meaning, too, since 답 (答) means ""answer"" (see ""대답[하다]"" or ""답하다"").  Another, perhaps simpler, example is 남 (男) and 여 (女). You might see one of these tacked on to the front of nouns to indicate someone's gender.  ""남학생"" would mean ""male student"", and ""여학생"" would mean ""female student."" If you know the word ""성별"" (""gender""), you might even be able to guess that ""남성"" means ""male/the male gender"" and ""여성"" means ""female/the female gender.""  This will not work in every situation (note that the 자 [子] in ""남자/여자"" is not actually the same 자 [者] as in ""응답자/봉사자""), but it can still be quite useful. You may even find yourself naturally noticing (rather than intentionally learning or studying) more and more of these common characters on your own as you progress in your studies over time.  TL;DR After a long time of learning, especially if one familiarizes themself with ""root characters"" (for lack of a better word), it could be completely plausible that they could learn to guess or approximate a Korean word's meaning, similar to how native English speakers are sometimes able to guess the meaning of new Spanish or French words, or even unfamiliar English words, based on common Latin (or other language) roots."
Korean,30z2nv,isometimeseatpizza,12,Fri Apr 3 23:30:33 2015 UTC,"If I take the semantics and phonology of Korean and compare them to other languages (that aren't FSI Category 5), I'd say that Korean is ""frikken"" hard. Here we go: 받침's and zero-consonant resyllabilification, all those assimilations and palatalizations and whatnot, 쌍자음 and aspirations, free word order, culture differences in speech including honorifics, particles (and the fact they get dropped in colloquialisms), many things are not as easily translatable from Korean to English and vice versa, and of course three billion conjugations including forty thousand ways to say ""because"". I think Korean is much more difficult because of all this.   But I NEVER EVER think about any of them when I study, practice, and listen in on stuff. I think only:   Wow. This language is awesome. Korean is just awesome. I love it.   And that's why I think Korean is way easier to me than Spanish, Filipino, Russian, or any other language I've ever tried to learn, mostly because those other languages I decided to learn were required by schools or popular opinion argued the usefulness of those languages; never was I interested learning them."
Korean,30z2nv,Wzzch,6,Wed Apr 1 00:09:48 2015 UTC,"Regardless of the vocabulary or syntax and all that, the hangul alphabet is probably the most sensible on this planet.   Definitely gets points for that."
Korean,30z2nv,slappymcnutface,7,Wed Apr 1 07:38:47 2015 UTC,I'm a native speaker in a dialect of Chinese.  I learned Japanese extensively before learning Korean.  Korean pronunciation was no problem.  Korean grammar was no problem.

I'll try to think of examples. Pronunciation in Korean isn't easy, but there are no tones, which is the hardest part of Chinese for me still."

Korean,30z2nv,BruceJi,2,Wed Apr 1 14:15:59 2015 UTC,"I learned German for 3 years, then dropped it for Russian that I've been learning since September and I've been learning English since I was like 7 (and I consider myself to be pretty fluent in it) and to be honest I can't really compare learning these three to learning Korean. I absolutely hated German and I think because I didn't like the language it was hard for me to learn it. After these 3 years I can only say what my name is.  I like Russian and it's easier for me than German (mainly because it's very similar to my first language) and the learning experience is the most similar (in my opinion) to Korean as I had to learn a new alphabet (cyrillic was harder than hangul, in cyrillic there are a lot of letters that are similar to Latin alphabet but have a different sound so it's easy to get them mixed up).   So basically, in terms of difficulty - German>Korean>Russian>English for me. Korean grammar is quite hard but since I'm passionate about it I have an easier time learning it than German (which is considered easier than Korean)."
Korean,30z2nv,Darkbloomy,2,Tue Mar 31 23:09:45 2015 UTC,"I study mostly classical Latin and ancient Greek, and I find that just having the good understanding of grammar that comes with those languages helps a lot in Korean, even if the way of rendering those ideas are vastly different.

Korean,30z2nv,klangs,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:54:30 2015 UTC,"I second this.  I have a background in Latin, and just the foundation it gave me in grammatical terminology has been really helpful in my learning other languages."

Korean,30z2nv,gujayeon,2,Wed Apr 1 17:08:35 2015 UTC,"Korean has been a long and hard journey, but it has been very rewarding (e.g. through the grammar, Japanese makes a lot more sense, through the vocab [and learning hanja along the way], a lot of Sino- vocabulary has been opened to my eyes). As for something easy, at least in retrospect now that I've tried learning Russian, is that at least with a completely different alphabet, I just have to set my mind to ""Ok, this is how this is pronounced"", rather than ""Wait, even though that looks like 'e', it's actually 'ye'."" I learned French before learning Korean, and it was incredibly frustrating not being able to use clues like cognates (being fluent in English and Spanish made French a breeze in that regard, not to mention not finding the verb conjugation system alien at all) was definitely hard.  Recognizing hanja vocab has been a god-send, though, now for learning new vocab in Korean.   I learned Korean through having a very, very friendly and helpful group of native Korean speaker friends in college, and three years of Korean classes at a university. I can't imagine trying to have learned such a different language myself."
Korean,30z2nv,rkgkseh,2,Wed Apr 1 20:05:24 2015 UTC,Im decently conversational in both Japanese and Korean. I learned Japanese first. So Korean was super yes. I found Japanese easier to pronounce and Korean easier to read and write.

Korean has odd words that don't have direct (or similar) translations, and the markers they used aren't found in French or English (in much the same manner) and the sentences structure is vastly different.   But good lord if it isn't fun to write, listen and speak though. Hangul is fascinating."

I learned French in school for 4 years and it was easy at first, but started to get harder over time, and I wasn't conversational at all. I could probably only understand what we learned in class. But I've been learning Korean for 5 years now, and it's so much easier for me than French was. I'm a lot more conversational in Korean and can understand a lot more things."
Korean,30z2nv,Saekki10,1 point,Wed Apr 1 02:59:12 2015 UTC,"I studied Spanish for a while and although English is my native language and I should in theory have found Spanish really easy in comparison, nothing ever made sense to me. It could be that I only studied for about a year or so but could never get past phrasebook language and maybe a few simple sentences. I also could never do the rolling r.  I studied Japanese and had an easier time to get the basics of the grammar but got stuck with kanji. Pronunciation was also pretty easy for me to pick up. After studying in high school for 4 years, and taking up to 3rd year Japanese in college, I was decent at reading and could have some conversations (albeit nothing like the economics and politics we studied in my Japanese courses). By now my reading has deteriorated to that of a small child but I think that conversation still comes easier for me than in Korean... I haven't used Japanese in about a year so that may change soon, though.  Having learned Japanese before Korean, I had a pretty easy time with grammar and particles; when I didn't know something, I could say it in Japanese and translate little by little and it'd be pretty close. But vocabulary doesn't stick as well and pronunciation is harder for me than in Japanese. As a result, I'm incredibly self conscious about speaking Korean and can't hold conversations very well.  A bit unrelated, but I really wanted to learn French in the past but was scared off by the pronunciation and male/female nouns (probably because of my experience with Spanish ;n;)"
Korean,30z2nv,alaksh,1 point,Wed Apr 1 03:55:32 2015 UTC,"It really varies depending on individual experience. In French class my vocab was horrible but I was more confident speaking because all my friends took French with me and we would practice with each other. But then with Korean, ability to read is pretty good, but I lack communication skills because I don't live in an area where I have easy access to people who speak Korean. It doesn't help that I communicate easier in person than over the phone or mic,  which makes using online options more difficult for me.  On the other hand, when I try to learn some things in other languages, I find myself comparing them to Korean constantly. For example, I have a friend from the Netherlands and I was trying to learn some Dutch just for fun, and I found myself constantly saying, ""Wow I'm glad that doesn't exist in Korean."" Since I have the basics of Korean down, it's been pretty hard for me to do begin with another language just because I get frustrated since I could easily say what I'm trying to say in Korean rather than the new language. When I study Mandarin for fun I also end up filling in Korean when I don't know the Mandarin word, too, like ""他是학생"" and things like that.  Overall, I think if you're interested in something and have people to communicate with, it's going to be ""easier"" than a language you aren't fond of where you don't want to communicate with anyone, just because it will keep you interested for longer. In the case of in school vs self study, it really comes down to how long you spend with the languages. If the only time you care about French is the 3 hours or so a week you spend in French class, then of course it will be easier to learn a language where you are spending, for example, 1 hour per day learning or practicing."

Korean,30z2nv,kjoonlee,1 point,Tue Mar 31 23:36:45 2015 UTC,"The main sense in which they are useful are as a comparison - e.g., language X will take 2 times as long to get to a fixed point of proficiency as language Y. Their courses (some are available online) stress general proficiency and there is little reason to think that the fact that they are aiming towards government work invalidates these sorts of inferences. You are right that they assume that a speaker is a native English speaker; the OP's question is not really meaningful unless one makes some sort of assumption of this sort. In the absence of further information, it's reasonable to assume that the OP is interested in the viewpoints of native English speakers.  Also, the fact that a certain statistic only applies to a certain subpopulation (in this, case, native English speakers of a certain sort) doesn't make it subjective. That's not what the subjective / objective distinction means."

Korean,30xd87,mysticrudnin,2,Tue Mar 31 15:10:23 2015 UTC,"You see 하다 used a lot in Korean because of its function as a light verb. It has no substantial meaning by itself, but rather is attached to a noun to create a verb. This includes both action verbs (ex: 공부-하다) and descriptive verbs (ex: 명백-하다), which are actually predicate adjectives in English. In addition, loanwords that are verbs or predicate adjectives are always borrowed as nouns and then combined with 하다.  Because Korean historically borrowed heavily from Chinese and more recently from English, many of the words in the lexicon are nouns attached to 하다. I know this is a bet technical, but hopefully it makes sense."

Korean,30wamd,Noiru,2,Tue Mar 31 14:28:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah like mentioned above, sometimes for 한자어 you can guess one pronunciation based on the other language. But other times it's harder.  E.g. ""t"" is sometimes ""ㅈ"" and sometimes ""ㅅ"":   toàn bộ = 전부 tài sản = 재산 đối tượng = 대상 thủ tục = 수속   And ""d"" corresponds to ""ㅁ"" sometimes and ""요"" or ""여"" other times:   dân tộc = 민족 nội dung = 내용   ""ia"" is usually just ""ㅣ"", like   chủ nghĩa = 주의 địa phương = 지방   And from the ""địa phương"" vs ""đối tượng"" examples you can also see ""đ"" sometimes becomes ""ㄷ"" and sometimes ""ㅈ""."

Korean,30wamd,k3g,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:39:28 2015 UTC,"준비 = chuẩn bị   학생 = học sinh  국가 = quốc gia   These come from Chinese roots. 準備, 學生 and 國家 respectively.  An estimated ~40-60% of all Vietnamese, Korean and Japanese words have their roots from Chinese due to historical and cultural reasons. Classical Chinese was the ""Latin"" of East Asia back in the day.   Bread = 빵 =bánh (mì)   This is just a coincidence. 빵 (bbang) comes via Japanese パン (pan) which is ultimately from Portuguese pão and Latin panem.  The word bánh (also: bính) comes from the Chinese 餅."

Korean,30szk0,UngratefulPeon,6,Mon Mar 30 13:39:31 2015 UTC,"But do you understand grammar well and construct sentences? Is your vocab various enough? I personally believe that alphabet+basic reading level = beginner. Intermediate is when you have a basic understanding of grammar and are able to create sentences without taking too much time.   With that being said, what should you do? Study vocab and grammar, mainly. What should you use for this? Vocab, you can easily use SRS methods like Memrise and Anki. They should be available on app store. However, grammar, you see, needs acquisition and application. This, you should use textbook and/or any other well-written resources instead of using an app. This is due to the fact that writing the sentence out yourself works the best in acquiring grammar."

These are only the summer programs I was interested in. However, my situation changed and I am looking at language programs for the summer, instead of international summer university programs.  I've looked at the language programs at Seoul National, Korea U, Sogang, Yonsei, and Ewha, and am leaning towards Sogang and Yonsei.   I'm at work right now, so I can't upload my comparisons, but when I get home, I'll edit with a link. Hopefully, what I have for now will give you an idea.  EDIT Still not home yet, but this site helped me out. Check it out. It has university reviews, and Lexis.  EDIT 2 Home. Here. Hopefully this will help somewhat help.

Korean,30p08h,jojo4400,3,Mon Mar 30 07:28:59 2015 UTC,"I did a full time Korean course at Lexis near Gangnam station last year and I can definitely recommend them. It is rather expensive but worth the money. I also did a course at a public uni but during the 200h there I didn't even learn half as much as during the 50h at the private language school. At Lexis you can choose different levels for grammar and speaking so you don't have to stick to the same level if your speaking is not as good as your writing for example. You can find cheap accommodations from 12,000 Won for a dorm in a hostel or 15,000 Won for a single room in a Koshiwon."
Korean,30p08h,feedmefeces,1 point,Sun Mar 29 18:05:42 2015 UTC,"Lexis looks quite overpriced. I met a few of their students last summer and was not impressed. Ironically, Sogang and Yonsei are actually cheaper, but deliver much better results in my experience."
Korean,30p08h,Pikmeir,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:07:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can fault a language school for not bringing someone up to an impressive level in a very short amount of time though. Even if it were the best school in the world for teaching (I don't know anything about Lexis), it wouldn't be possible to bring someone to an impressive level in just 50hrs anyway. I can't comment on price though."
Korean,30p08h,feedmefeces,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:40:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess I meant that in comparison with the Yonsei / Sogang students, they didn't seem very impressive. I agree that there is only so much that can be accomplished in a short time and that one needs to be realistic. I remember comparing Korean language hagwon prices at one time, and realizing that they were over twice as expensive as Ganada, which I had always thought was the 'premiere' Korean language hagwon in Seoul. I'm not sure how they justify that sort of premium."
Korean,30p08h,Pikmeir,2,Mon Mar 30 02:54:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe someone can make a post about all of the language hagwons in Korea someday with their prices and people can post reviews, like the resource thread or something."

You can expect to pay around 400,000W per month for an average goshiwon near these universities. You can find cheaper accommodations if you don't mind commuting a little.  Source: I study Korean at Sogang University right now."
Korean,30p08h,Honestiago5,1 point,Mon Mar 30 13:42:00 2015 UTC,These prices are for the schooling alone right? No housing or anything else added?

Using one's position as moderator to run an advertisement ring outside of reddit's own advertising, so as to not pay reddit for advertising, and astroturf the links as ""legitimate content"" is quite a bit different."

Korean,30o5u8,Potstickerlele,4,Sun Mar 29 04:14:07 2015 UTC,Here's a wiki page that lists animated shows made in Korea.
Korean,30o5u8,Pikmeir,2,Sun Mar 29 07:35:43 2015 UTC,"Well, the thing is- Animation industry in Korea isn't that big. The reason is that the community doesn't support it due to conservative people. Hence most of the Korean animations you'd see on TV channels would be targeted to children, unlike those from Japan. However, did you know? Currently, huge portion of Japanese Anime industry is outsourced to Korea. So technically you could say they're Korean ""Anime"". If you're truly looking for Anime-style original Korean Animation, look up Ghost Messenger (고스트 메신저). They had first episode on BD out few years ago, but I don't know if they have been continuing the series or not."
Korean,30o5u8,dlwhdgns10,4,Sun Mar 29 07:33:24 2015 UTC,Also huge amounts of American animation is draw in Korea.  Korea's animation industry is arguably larger than the U.S.s or Japan's.

Korean,30mhit,infringement153,5,Sat Mar 28 19:01:52 2015 UTC,"There's no real 'supposed way of using them'.  They're just there to give you a chance of practicing your listening comprehension. When I was learning English in school, we had similar lessons where we just listened to some prerecorded dialogue.  The idea is to give you a controlled environment to practice your listening by using mostly limited vocabulary that you should be familiar with. If you listen to the radio or TV shows, you might get overwhelmed because they use a lot of vocabulary you don't know.  I personally think you should just listen to it once and see how much you understand. Then write down some points about what the dialogue is about. Then listen again and see if your points match up.  Of course it's not wrong to go into every detail of the dialogue and transcribe it. But when you learn a new language and you're trying to understand what people are talking about it's more important to first get their general point. For that you won't have to understand each and every word. I think transcribing it helps to get the gist of Korean pronunciation but not necessarily the meaning.   I'm fluent in English now and I never felt the need to transcribe anything or analyze dialogue in such detail. Looking up things you don't understand is important though.  But don't forget that everyone is different."
Korean,30mhit,parmichili,2,Sat Mar 28 20:44:31 2015 UTC,"For what you're ""supposed"" to do with TTMIK Iyagi's, I strongly believe it varies by person. When I listen to Iyagis, for example, I like to take them apart and transcribe the dialogue section by section. I constantly check whether I heard them right or not by comparing what I write down with the posted script and repeat the process until I finish the dialogue. It's similar your approach, but some people might rather listen to the whole thing and summarize before reading the script and analyzing.   So, I guess what you're doing is great as long as you feel that you're progressing at a nice pace. Remember, everyone is different. So work at your comfort. Do you constantly lose track of what sentences are expressing? Are their pronunciations/accents too difficult or their speech too fast? Is the amount of new vocabulary and grammatical items too overwhelming for you? Would you be able to summarize/paraphrase what has just been said in Korean? Ask yourself these questions and you should be able to determine whether you're approaching Iyagis the right way, or any audio source in general. Take it down a notch or increase the difficulty of your approach based on that kind of evaluation.  As for being the only listening source at those levels, I can suggest to you another website, KLEAR textbooks. This website is a supplement to the Integrated Korean book series.  You might not have the textbook and workbook that goes along with the audio exercises, but the audio exercises (well, most of it) are online. If you don't have the books, I think you can find the vocabulary at least at Memrise. Most of the grammar found in these exercises are also in TTMIK, but if you need them from a specific chapter they're on the KLEAR website.   Anyways, take a look at their Beginner 1 and 2 listening exercises (perhaps Intermediate 1 and 2 if you're feeling for it). The problem with these is that you'd need the books in order to find the actual scripts and translations of these dialogues. Otherwise, you might find them easier to follow than Iyagis, except in a few instances where I found their pronunciation to be somewhat difficult to process.  I hope this helps!!^^"
Korean,30mhit,Wzzch,1 point,Sat Mar 28 20:28:32 2015 UTC,"The grammar/vocabulary in the iyagi's (at least the first few) is simple, it's just when I try to understand the audio my comprehension the first time through is nearly zero. I""ll check out KLEAR"
Korean,30mhit,Wzzch,1 point,Tue Mar 31 05:34:08 2015 UTC,"Sounds about right if you're just starting out audio exercises, especially Iyagi.  There's a fine line between knowing the relevant vocabulary and hearing them used in all sorts of ways. So, think of it as you're not used to it. If you don't hear it all the first time, it's the fact that you haven't done enough practice to get to that level. Perhaps dividing the Iyagi into sections might help. The point is to get you readily aware of how sentences come out in their conversation. So, if you can't hear much in a first run through, do another take by sections. If that's too hard, increase the amount of times you have to listen to each section. And so on.   But don't worry. Comprehension comes in due time^^. As long as you do this everyday (or however frequent you'd like to do it), you'll start to catch more sentences. Then blocks of sentences.Then entire conversations.   I think another supplement is Korean music (of any genre, really) unless you already listen to that stuff. K-Pop might not help as much since in my experience I just end up singing along without knowing what the hell I'm saying (ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ). But do listen to ballads, R&B, and other material with a higher focus on lyrics."

Korean,30l3tx,killer_drug_lord,10,Sat Mar 28 09:22:26 2015 UTC,"You've got the particles in the sentences backwards.  Is this an error in the textbook?    The short answer is that 좋아요 is the verb that means ""to like"" but takes the thing that's liked as its subject, while 좋아해요 is the verb that means ""to like"" but takes the thing that's liked as its object.    Here's the slightly longer answer.  For the sake of explanation, I'm going to add 저는 in front of your sentences.    (저는) 봄이 좋아요 More literal translation: (As for me,) spring is good. More natural translation: I like spring.  (저는) 봄을 좋아해요 More literal translation: (As for me, I) regard spring as good. More natural translation:  I like spring.  Once you reach a higher level, you will almost certainly encounter another lesson about adding -해요 to descriptive verbs.  Until then, just think of the two as being identical in meaning for all practical purposes, with the following caveat.  You might think ""I like spring"" is more literally translated in Korean as ""제가 봄을 좋아해요"", since ""I"" is the subject and ""spring"" is the object.  Even though that's not a wrong translation, the more widely-used, more natural version in Korean is ""저는 봄이  좋아요."""

Korean,30l3tx,sqlepytt1,0,Sat Mar 28 10:36:13 2015 UTC,"Like rsl12 mentioned, the lesson about adding 하다 to descriptive verbs is that when speaking about a third person u add 하다 to the descriptive verb. For example; 그녀는 사과를 좋아해요. 그는 아이스크림을 먹고 싶어 해요.   So, if talking about a third person u should use 좋아하다, otherwise the difference is mainly the use of particles."

Some cards might be too hard / bad translation or something so you can just delete them since you will be able to easily generate thousands of cards.

But after finishing 2 episodes of full house I was recognizing words that I made zero attempt to learn just because I had seen them used multiple times in different contexts. This post has the first episode of full house I uploaded for someone  Cyber University of Korea has video lectures and online tests to make sure you know what you learned from the video lectures.

Korean,30gek4,gujayeon,2,Fri Mar 27 16:52:47 2015 UTC,That's correct. It was an error on my part to be pairing speaker honorific 저 with the plain form. You'd either have to switch to 존댓말 to use 저 OR use 나 if you'd want to use the plain form.
Korean,30gek4,Wzzch,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:24:25 2015 UTC,ok great thanks for clearing it up!  i didn't even notice that reading through your post :)
Korean,30ev63,Wzzch,6,Thu Mar 26 20:21:08 2015 UTC,"How does -다 affect the meaning of a sentence in these cases?    There are two main speech forms/styles that you will encounter which end in ~다. The first is 합쇼체 which is a polite/deferential level of speech. In some cases, you can use it towards strangers, but it's mostly used in speech where formality is of utmost importance, i.e., in business and military settings.   Examples: (Basic expressions) 감사합니다. 처음 뵙겠습니다. 반갑습니다.  Conjugation into this style of speech is done by adding ㅂ니다 to vowel and ㄹ-irregular endings, 습니다 to consonant endings.  하다 --> 합니다.  알다 --> 압니다.  좋다 --> 좋습니다.  In your case of 갑시다, that is a form in 합쇼체 that suggests/proposes an idea.  가다 + ㅂ시다 갑시다 --> Let's go  Another common form you will encounter is the 해라체 level of speech, commonly referred to as plain style, which you've somewhat encountered already after finding the dictionary form of words. Plain style is the total opposite of 합쇼체 as it is informal/반말 level of speech. It is commonly used among intimates, spouses, and other similar relationships. But it's mostly found in reported speech (i.e., ""He/She/They said that ....""), diary entries, articles, etc..  For adjectives, conjugation into plain style is identical to their dictionary forms. For verbs, add a ㄴ to vowel endings and 는 to consonant endings.  Examples: 나는 개를 좋아한다. I like dogs. 지금 햄버거를 먹는다. I [am] eat[ing] a hamburger.  이 커피가 참 맛있다. This coffee is quite good.  So,    Is it just a speech level thing?   It sure is!"
Korean,30ev63,desperatechaos,2,Thu Mar 26 21:53:54 2015 UTC,"Pretty much just as I posted this I remembered it could be from the 슴니다 ending, but I've definitely never heard of plain style before. Thanks a ton! :D"

Korean,30ev63,km00000,1 point,Thu Mar 26 23:50:07 2015 UTC,What does going from 하다 to 합니다 mean? What is the difference between the two?
Korean,30ev63,Wzzch,1 point,Wed Apr 1 05:56:56 2015 UTC,"What does going from 하다 to 합니다 mean?   Since 하다 is plain style, you're going from a speech form only colloquially used between intimates and to yourself to a speech level widely used in business settings and in the military. Normally, you wouldn't need to transition between those two forms in most contexts. However, the transition is analogous to adding 요 after 해체 level conjugations (해-->해요, 돼-->돼요).   What is the difference between the two?   합니다(합쇼체/높임말) is the politeness level ubiquitous in settings where formality is of utmost importance. Usually, you wouldn't need to use this form when talking to strangers, clerks, or even people older with you; that's when 해요체 (해요, 하세요) comes in. But in the military, to your boss, maybe to a client or patient, etc... in those cases you'd use 합쇼체. It's interesting to note that women tend to use 해요체 over 합쇼체 even in the workplace because 합쇼체 is regarded as sort of ""men's talk"".  하다/한다 (해라체) is used colloquially between intimates or to yourself. It's also commonly used as a reaction to something (짱이다! - Cool!, 다쳤겠다 - That must've hurt!), but only among people that you are able to speak at that level with. But most importantly, you'd see 해라체 in impersonal literature such as articles, narratives, diary entries, etc... where formality is unnecessary since a wall of text rather than a person is speaking to you. This ISN'T the case in places like online news or broadcasted news where 합쇼체 would be the more appropriate form to use  I hope this answers your question!"
Korean,30ev63,DefVirtus,1 point,Wed Apr 1 06:31:29 2015 UTC,So 합니다 is used when it is more formal than normal (most formal?). 하다 is used with everyone else. And if it is casual talk with friends you can remove the 요 ending from verbs.   I think I got it. I haven't been to concerned about the levels of formality yet but I keep seeing both 하다 and 합니다 and they mean the same thing so I was confused if perhaps they are used in different context depending on what the sentence is saying. It isn't the context of the sentence but the level of formality the sentence is spoken in.   Thank you.
Korean,30ev63,hleighthree,1 point,Wed Apr 1 22:46:26 2015 UTC,"No problem! Keep in mind that 하다/한다 and 해 styles tend to be mixed together in familiar/informal speech. Usually, 해 is used more often.  And yes, currently 합쇼체 is the most formal. There used to be something called 하소서체 but that kind of formality is archaic."

Korean,30biez,rkgkseh,1 point,Thu Mar 26 12:16:38 2015 UTC,"According to Naver,    어원 : ←잇-+-다가  ‘이따가’의 의미로 ‘잇다가’를 쓰는 경우가 있으나 ‘이따가’만 표준어로 삼는다.   So, it came from 잇다(to connect)+다가, not 있다+다가(=있다가). The above explanation reads as following:   As 이따가 came to be often written with the meaning of 잇다가, 이따가 was made 표준어 (standard language)."
Korean,30bpku,Areumdaun,2,Thu Mar 26 01:40:59 2015 UTC,"Ah, without specific sentences/context, I'm getting confused but I'll try to answer more generally. 시 is used when you're applying the honorific to the subject of the verb. For example, I could be talking about my grandmother to my friend and I'd say something like 드셧다고 했어 which applies to honorific to my grandmother but not to my friend. Also, 시 is sort of the ""full"" honorific form of the language that would be used when talking to/about elders and/or when speaking formally. ""있어요"" is polite but not quite the full version.    For your second question:     한국에 살아요? 한국어 배우고 있어요? 한국어 잘하시네요!     I'm assuming the context is talking to strangers or acquaintances that are about the same age, right? The first two aren't very formal, despite the -요. For the 3rd one, I want to say that the reason is because 한국어 잘하네요 sounds kind of condescending (it sounds like the way that adults on children's shows talk) but I can't explain why it sounds that way to me."
Korean,30bpku,Roskandy,2,Thu Mar 26 01:59:55 2015 UTC,"I've always used 계세요 when it's the honorific person existing and 있으세요 when it's some possession of the honorific person existing. 있으시나요 is another conjugation of 있으세요 adding 나 (or...) which you can do in 계세요 to 계시나요, so it's something else unrelated to your main question.  examples:  집에 계세요? Are you at home? (honoric you existing at home)  개 있으세요? Do you have a dog? (dog existing that belongs to honorific you)"

Korean,30bpku,sgebb,1 point,Thu Mar 26 21:23:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% sure, but I feel like I've mostly heard 하실 수 있다. I suspect a reason for this is that you only use the honorific form when the subject is someone you need to be respectful to.  In the question 한국어 할 수 있다?, the subject is you, and the verb you do is 하다. The ㄹ 수 있다 part is talking about the existence of a certain skill, so the subject is the skill, meaning you don't have to be respectful to it."

Korean,309zdz,Yiseul,2,Wed Mar 25 18:01:21 2015 UTC,"You should definitely at least use 요 form with people you don't know or have just met for the first time. If you are older, you can suggest ""lowering your language"" meaning to drop the polite endings. If they are older, they can use less polite language to you without your permission. They may invite you to lower your language too. Until they do, you should speak to them more formally if they are older. You don't have to use honorifics unless they are much older than you (for example, you would use honorifics to your parents). You can use honorifics with strangers if you want to be really polite."
Korean,309zdz,thesi1entk,2,Wed Mar 25 18:11:56 2015 UTC,"go with 요 endings always if they're older, or with strangers to be polite.  Honorific verbs, again, older people or strangers will find it super polite. But if you're kind of meeting someone ""on the same plane"" so to speak, like writing to a penpal, there's no need to get too fancy with it. In fact their lack of those things is probably an attempt to feel more open/cordial towards you. they don't wanna talk to a penpal the same way they would their mother-in-law! for example if you were in a dorm and turned to your new roommate and said ""저녁에 뭐 드시겠습니까?"" It might sound a bit silly. You can drop the super high level formality in situations like that."
Korean,309zdz,gOwj2n8nQ,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:26:40 2015 UTC,"As others suggested already, you should at least use 요 if you are meeting someone for the first time. Dropping 요 completely would most likely be considered rude. Even if you and the other person are both the same age, droping 요 completely would be little awkward, unless of course one of you suggests that you drop honorifics and use 반말. Be carefull though because many people might feel uncomfortable dropping honorifics completely (when they first meet someone) even if they are the same age.  Speaking of 씨 and 님. Only older people can call younger people by their names without using 씨 etc. It is considered rude the other way around. If they are older than you you could address them as 오빠, 누나, 형 and 언니. This is actually very common. Keep in mind that if you are unsure how to address someone, you can always ask them using this phrase. 제가 어떻게 불러야 될까요 = How can I address you? / How can I call you?  Some people might use honorifics when talking to you (address you with 씨 and keep the 요s) but refuse to talk about themselves using 저. They use 나 instead. This is because in reality 저 is the more humble version of 나. So, people will be polite talking to you, keep using 존댓말, but they dont want to ""lower"" themselves and feel inferior to you. So they use 나. This is something not very popular though and personally I wouldn't mind it if someone talking to me did this.  TTMIK has a great lesson about 존댓말 and 반말.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8DmI6s4vBQ"
Korean,309zdz,gOwj2n8nQ,1 point,Wed Mar 25 19:41:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the response. I just found it a little odd for people to address me directly like that in a first message. Also you say it's not very popular, but it feels like everyone writes to me like that, older or younger. So I'm wondering if I should just do it too to sound more natural."
Korean,309zdz,mikwow,1 point,Wed Mar 25 20:15:19 2015 UTC,"If they are younger than you, you can call them by their name, even if you just met. If you are the same age and you just started talking to eachother, using 씨 is the safe way to address them. However, if they call you by your name already, that doesn't necessarily mean that they are being rude to you. It could also mean that they want to break the barrier between you and come closer to eachother. In this case, you could call them by their name too without worrying too much. However, if you don't want this to happen for whatever reason (let's say you want to keep a professional relationship with a co-worker), you can tell them to stop calling you by your name. Now, if they are older than you and they already call you by your name, you simply can't do anything about it. You are still obliged to use 씨 (or as I said earlier,  오빠, 누나, 형 and 언니) unless they tell you to ""lower your words"" and talk casually.  Keep in mind that people online (in forums, blogs, comments, video games etc) tend to drop honorifics and address eachother by their names, usernames etc.  I also noticed that some Koreans tend to drop honorifics when talking to foreigners. My guess would be that this happens because they acknowledge the fact that people don't use honorifics in the western countries and they maybe feel that they dont have to use them when talking to you, since you already dont care about it and you wouldn't find it offensive anyway. To answer your question in a sentence: If you don't mind getting closer to them and they already call you by your name, you can call them by their name too. It won't be considered rude or impolite."
Korean,309zdz,gOwj2n8nQ,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:04:35 2015 UTC,"Just to add on this. I currently have five ""Korean friends"" I regularly speak with on the Internet and they all are older than me. All five of them asked me to only call them by their name. They felt like 씨 and 님 were way too polite, and they didn't really like being called 누나.  Maybe this only happens with girls, but funnily enough all five of them said it made them feel older and they wanted me to only call them by their name. We also started using 반말 after maybe 30 minutes of speaking with each other. Our age differences are between 1 year and 6 years.  Basically, I think a lot of Koreans don't really give a crap about their penpal's age and they just want to speak casually with a friend."
Korean,309zdz,mikwow,2,Wed Mar 25 22:04:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah. This is true. Many young koreans (late teen - early 20s) like the ""American style"" (they really say that). They don't like using 존댓말 at all. They want to talk casually to both older and younger people, and they want to be treated the same way too. I guess the west has really infleunced them.  I really find it odd though that they didn't like being called 누나. Especially with an age difference of 6 years. Generally 누나 is pretty safe when talking to older (2-3+) girls Of course this depends on the individuals' preferences."
Korean,309zdz,Paradoxa77,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:27:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I found it odd too. My guess is that since I'm a foreigner they know these words don't really mean anything to me and they just want to simplify things a little bit."
Korean,309zdz,princetonwu,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:39:31 2015 UTC,Ask any teacher and they will tell you that 난 해요 is incorrect but people still do it anyway. It is just more casual (나) without being impolite (요). In person people generally dont do this but on occasion it happens. For example when a boy and girl want to start becoming closer but havent dropped 존댓말 해요체 yet they might just say 나 해요. But be careful of 너. Thats generally less acceptable than 나.

If a tour guide said something interesting, I think ""어, 정말이에요?"" (""Oh, really?"") would be more appropriate as ""정말"" seems to hold a ""softer"" connotation.   Another ""synonym"" is 너무 which is more similar to ""a lot."" Example: ""비빔밥 너무 맛있어요."" ""Bibimbap is really delicious.""   To make things more confusing... ;) If I'm really appreciative of something someone has done for me, I might say, ""정말 감사합니다. 진짜요."" ""Thank you so--정말--much. Really (I mean it).""   Regarding when to use which, the guidelines given by desperatechaos are accurate. I think you'll learn when to use 진짜, 정말, 너무, etc. as you read/listen/speak more Korean.

Korean,2zz9mq,bathroom_thoughts,2,Mon Mar 23 04:40:27 2015 UTC,"Dont take my word as gospel because I'm only an intermediate speaker, but ""으려고"" is used to say ""intend,"" or ""plan.""

Korean,2zz9mq,bathroom_thoughts,2,Mon Mar 23 04:47:04 2015 UTC,Yes 려고 is more common. I guess it's easier on the tongue..and less..heavy in the meaning.
Korean,2zz9mq,StandardToast,1 point,Mon Mar 23 04:51:34 2015 UTC,"from my understanding ~(으)려고 is a verb conjugation and means something like ""in order to [verb]"" whereas 위하다 is a verb in-of-itself and is usually proceeded by a noun. ""[동사] 위해서"" loosely translates to ""for the sake of [noun],"" and is sometimes a bit heavy-handed in common speech"
Korean,2zz9mq,CowboyRocksteady,-2,Mon Mar 23 05:34:38 2015 UTC,"In other words, they are quite different."
Korean,2zz9mq,bigbirrrd,0,Mon Mar 23 07:11:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with the consensus here. To illustrate more:  숙제 하려고 했는데 못했어요.  I was gonna do my homework but I couldn't.   I think it translates quite well as ""gonna"" and I use it a lot in that exact phrasing above - 하려고 했는데  위해 / 위해서 is extremely different. It loosely translates to ""for"" or ""in order to"" ""for the sake of"" as others have said. (Check the example sentences out here and you'll see why this can be confusing: http://endic.naver.com/search.nhn?sLn=kr&isOnlyViewEE=N&query=%EC%9C%84%ED%95%98%EB%8B%A4)   So it's not attached to verbs in the way that 려고 is so that should be a clear distinction you make right off the bat. To add to what others have said, I honestly don't use this very much in conversation. It feels a bit more like formal speech or written language. Like when people are being all patriotic and talking about doing something for the sake of Korea ""대한민국을 위해 최선을 다 하겠습니다."" Just note that it's not always that way.   However, I've noticed a lot of English speakers who learn Korean (including myself at one point) try to use it as a translation of ""for"" in the following sense:   엄마 위해 선물을 샀어요.  I bought a present ""for"" my mom.  In actuality, that sentence would be 엄마한테 선물을 샀어요.   Now where this gets confusing, and still ties me up sometimes, is that 한테 can mean both ""for"" and ""to"" in English.   I was talking to her.  그녀한테 얘기했어요.   I think in time, with more exposure, you'll get more sensitive to these differences and it will get easier with time. That's how it has been for me. In your studies and practice, start using 하려고 more and don't worry so much about 위해. If you are aware of this while watching/ listening to Korean, you'll start to notice how the two are used."
Korean,2zwk96,Klejac143,9,Sun Mar 22 14:12:10 2015 UTC,"It matters. For a while, people were having a hard time understanding what I was saying when I spoke Korean. Then I started to totally exaggerate aspirated consonants - almost to the point that I worried people might think I was mocking them. To my ear, it sounded absurd, but interestingly enough I actually found people understood me a lot better - no-one batted an eyelid at what I worried was a ridiculous level of over-exaggeration.  Bear in mind that most Korean words are short (one, two or three syllables), and so very small differences in pronunciation are likely to produce a word with an entirely different meaning. For this reason (amongst others) precision is important in pronunciation.  Now I don't deliberately exaggerate them as much, but my pronunciation is otherwise precise enough that it seems ok. But I think it is especially important for beginners to take these distinctions seriously."
Korean,2zwk96,feedmefeces,14,Sun Mar 22 14:17:02 2015 UTC,"Very much this. I personally experienced what happens when you don't fully grasp aspirated consonants.

Korean,2zwk96,Wzzch,9,Sun Mar 22 14:47:51 2015 UTC,"That is hilarious.  This reminds me of a conversation I had with a friend. I meant to say 친구들중에 찾는거...

Korean,2zwk96,gOwj2n8nQ,5,Mon Mar 23 08:59:10 2015 UTC,"Think of it like this. Sometimes when Koreans speak English they have a hard time making ""si"" because, in Korean, s+i sounds like ""shi"" instead. So they accidentally say shi instead of si. Now imagine the sentence ""I am sitting on a chair"" being pronounced ""I am shitting on a chair"" instead. You will probably understand what they mean, but it is something they definitely need to correct."
Korean,2zwk96,iamkoalafied,2,Mon Mar 23 09:17:48 2015 UTC,"Yes. Of course it doesn't mean that it's correct but people will most likely understand you. I find really surprising what @feedmefeces said earlier, that he had hard time people understanding him. Maybe he didn't sound like a native speaker, obviously, but people didn't understand him at all? I find it a little weird."
Korean,2zwk96,gOwj2n8nQ,2,Mon Mar 23 10:08:23 2015 UTC,"Messing up one word is one thing. Although, when I messed up, I used the term by itself versus in a sentence. So technically, she DID know the context, but it was more so that I randomly called her a slut in the middle of a conversation about learning Korean.  Constantly messing up in a pronunciation-sensitive language is another. Making one or two mistakes is manageable for the listener. However making it here, there, and over there creates holes in your meaning.  You'd want to cover up any holes for multiple interpretations as to one. And as a conversation progresses, you want to make sure that both interlocutors are on the same track."
Korean,2zwk96,Wzzch,1 point,Mon Mar 23 11:10:18 2015 UTC,"Well I don't know for sure, but I'd guess it would have to do with consistently messing up. Mispronounce one word and people can usually figure out what you mean, mispronounce a lot of words and it becomes a lot harder especially if they aren't used to speaking to people who aren't native speakers."
Korean,2zwk96,iamkoalafied,2,Mon Mar 23 10:11:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you both, very helpful. I'm very familiar with languages with strict pronunciation changes (Chinese), so I was curious about Korean. Looks like I'll put in the extra hours to practice aspiration!"
Korean,2zwk96,mysticrudnin,6,Sun Mar 22 16:06:15 2015 UTC,"A lot? Not quite as much as English fortis-lenis, but still quite a bit.*  What language are you coming from? For speakers of most romance languages, this should be easy, as we have aspirated consonants. The harder part is doing the non-aspirated consonants (and that's without getting started on the ""tense"" ones)  These consonants are probably the least of your worries. Just go a little harder than English and you'll be okay.  * (English ""pit"" vs. ""bit"" differs in two places, and so even when foreigners have trouble with them, they usually get at least one of the differences, so we can still distinguish although it sounds weird. For the most part, in Korean, this isn't a thing, although there are some intervocalic sound changes that affect this... still, as I said, you ""probably"" have no problems with aspiration?)"
Korean,2zwk96,mikwow,3,Sun Mar 22 20:50:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you got downvoted, you are right that native English speakers usually have a lot more trouble with non-aspirated consonants.   Maybe people are getting the impression that you are calling English a ""Romance language"". As a French speaker who fluently speaks English, non-aspirated and aspirated sounds didn't bother me too much. I pronounce ㄱ like the French ""k"" and I pronounce ㅋ like the English ""k"".   This little tip really helped me master the aspirated or non-aspirated sounds in Korean. Double consonants are giving me a lot more trouble."
Korean,2zwk96,mysticrudnin,2,Sun Mar 22 23:50:28 2015 UTC,I didn't know what the OP speaks natively but statistically it's either English or a romance language (or Chinese...) but I suppose I could have worded it a bit better.

Korean,2zwk96,mikwow,2,Mon Mar 23 21:30:47 2015 UTC,"That's right, French consonants are not aspirated at all.

You are right that the statement of the poster above me was a bit strange when he said ""Romance languages have aspirated consonants"".   Yeah I still have trouble really nailing the pronounciation of ㅂ. I don't know if I need to do a French ""b"" or a ""p"". For the moment I do something kind of in between those two letters."
Korean,2zwk96,kitchenmaniac111,1 point,Mon Mar 23 21:41:49 2015 UTC,"if it comes at the beginning of a word like 방식 it is voiceless, so like the french p.

That said, I question the idea that you can really express ""Choice"" as a concept in Korean the same way you can in English. 선택, while being a literal translation, doesn't carry the same concept or nuance at all.  I would almost suggest picking a different theme for your tattoo."

Korean,2zunz0,hatbeat,2,Sun Mar 22 05:22:45 2015 UTC,it is it is really interesting.  I have always wondered how the chinese pronunciations have affected the korean ones... and it seems like it did to a certain extent .  words like 문　文. Their　  pronunciations are similar to the then spoken chinese.. Which would be something along the mix of modern day  Hokkien and Teochew.. and maybe a little cantonese.

I'm not holding my breath here since they probably have to code a portion to teach people Hangul first but it'd be cool to see it finished sooner than later.

I am a student.  아름답다 on the other hand is a descriptive verb. Yes, it does have the copular in the definition (""to BE beautiful""), but its meaning revolves around describing the subject rather than simply linking subject with predicate.  나는 아름답다.

Korea picked up 癌 too, and the Korean pronunciation was 암.  Another source says the 癌 letter already meant cancer in the 1200s in China but to be honest, I have no way to verify either of these claims."

In that case the radical brings a hint about the meaning, and the phonetic brings a hint about how the letter is pronounced.

Korean,2zosu6,MyJokesArentFunny,2,Fri Mar 20 19:05:15 2015 UTC,"The Chinese pronunciation is ""yan"". So I would say kjoonlee correct. Also it's important for Korean learners to relate words to Chinese first, as not many words derive from Japanese compared to Chinese obviously. Nobody can explain how specific words exactly changed over the centuries, though, since nobody was there throughout the entire transformation of the word and transformations are not often documented. It's almost analogous to fossils and evolution."
Korean,2zosu6,RICHUNCLEPENNYBAGS,1 point,Fri Mar 20 12:27:06 2015 UTC,Actually linguists spend a lot of time and have methods for answering these sorts of questions. Many Chinese characters came to Japan by way of Korea anyway.
Korean,2zosu6,MyAssTakesMastercard,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:54:51 2015 UTC,"Is that Mandarin?  There's a bunch of different dialects and the Chinese languages have evolved a tremendous deal over time.   In fact, when you look up some Chinese characters, you'll find the Japanese Chinese-based pronunciations could be numerous because they come from multiple Chinese dialects. Korean seems to have stuck with just one and it's one where syllables can end in consonants other than ""ng"" and ""n"" unlike Mandarin and more like Cantonese and other dialects. What became the Mandarin language, would have more complex syllables however."
Korean,2zosu6,MyAssTakesMastercard,1 point,Fri Mar 20 13:10:19 2015 UTC,"It seems straightforward enough. Let's hope an actual linguist comes into this thread, but whatever dialect of Chinese this word entered Japanese from, probably began with a consonant that was easier approximated to ""g"" than any other and ""n"" is pretty much the only other consonant Japanese syllables can end in.   The time it entered Korean, the initial consonant probably was reduced or not present anymore, but it still retained the consonant at the end.   ""n"" at the end of Mandarin and Sino-Japanese words will usually end up as a bilabial consonant like ""m"" or ""b"" in Korean. Again, someone who knows their linguistics would have a more elegant answer.  A lot of times you'll see the ""h"" consonant at the beginning of a Sino-Korean or Mandarin word that ends of becoming ""k"" in Sino-Japanese, like Hanguo (Mandarin), Hanguk (Korean), Kankoku (Japanese). Again, this probably stems from some consonant that was easier approximated using the ""k"" consonant."

Korean,2zielh,punkrockbuddyholly,15,Wed Mar 18 20:55:38 2015 UTC,"The problem with your translations is that nobody would ever say ""Today I study Korean"". A translation has to be valid in the language you're translating to.  Like /u/RPShep said, present tense has different meanings in different languages. The construction ""I am ...-ing"" is basically the normal present tense in Korean. The tense ""I do"" is what we usually call the present tense but in reality it is never really used to describe the present. The ""하고 있다"" construction is an even more present tense called the present progressive, you wouldn't use it unless you're actually doing the thing right now.  Basically the two sentences mean the same thing, but you could imagine a question with them as a response to see how they are a little different. ""오늘 뭐해요?"" (what are you doing today?) - I would respond to this with ""오늘 한국어를 공부해요."" and it would say something about what my plan for the day is but nothing about what you're doing right now. On the other hand if the question is ""(지금) 뭐해요/뭐하고 있어요?"" then you could respond ""오늘 공부하고 있어요"" meaning you're doing it right now and you'll keep doing it. If you remove the 오늘 then you're only talking about right now."
Korean,2zielh,sgebb,3,Wed Mar 18 22:47:25 2015 UTC,"This is one of the best comments I've read here.   The problem with your translations is that nobody would ever say ""Today I study Korean"". A translation has to be valid in the language you're translating to.   This is very true. English is weird in this in that I can't think of any other language where this is the case, where the -ing form is used so disproportionately often and the""basic"" form is used so little."
Korean,2zielh,Areumdaun,1 point,Thu Mar 19 00:06:12 2015 UTC,"This is what was confusing me. When I first leaned to conjugate I knew that 공부해요 was present tense so in my head I translated it as ""I am studying korean"". But then I leaned the ~고 있다 conjugation and I thought ""Well if that means I am ~ing what does the present tense mean??"" But after that explanation it makes a lot more sense and I can see where you would use the two versions."
Korean,2zielh,RCIX,5,Thu Mar 19 14:45:26 2015 UTC,-고 있다 (어요) is a progressive tense. It indicates that you are currently doing something at the moment - normal verb conjugation doesn't do this. So you were correct in your translation :P  Let me know if you want any more detailed information.
Korean,2zielh,Crys368,2,Wed Mar 18 21:24:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, 'studying' and 'study' would probably be the best translations."
Korean,2zielh,RPShep,2,Wed Mar 18 21:20:21 2015 UTC,"Others, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but I think Google got it right on this one. Present tense in Korean is used differently than it is in English, and it's more similar to ""am -ing.""   I'm at work, so I can't type in Korea, but the ""ha-go issaw"" ending is used much more often for something you are currently engaged in. So in your first example, you don't actually need ""Oh-nul"" because you are doing it right now. In the second example, you do need it, because it could be either ""today"" or ""these days."" Does that make sense?  More fluent folks, feel free to clarify."

Korean,2zk5l5,dunedain441,4,Thu Mar 19 06:12:14 2015 UTC,"The easy way to think of it is the long versions 가지고 가다 and 가지고 오다. The first being ""to have and go"" and the second ""to have and come"". So consequently, the first is bringing something to a place, and the second is bringing something from a place.  If someone's leaving and they should bring something with them, you say 가져가다. If you arrived somewhere but forgot to bring something, you'd use 안 가져오다. If you will go somewhere and bring your umbrella with you, you'll say 우산을 가져갈게. Etc. Etc."

Remember that there's no real wrong reason to learn Korean. I'm learning Korean just to be able to impress my girlfriend's family and know what they're saying when they make fun of me. I also wanna be able to know my girlfriend better on a linguistic and cultural level.   Whatever reason you choose to learn Korean, just stick with it. When there's a will, there's a way."

I feel embarrassed just nodding like an idiot when I visit my in-laws so I'm trying to learn some.
Korean,2zebne,RICHUNCLEPENNYBAGS,5,Fri Mar 20 03:13:57 2015 UTC,"All the people here would probably say it is worth it, considering we're all learning it... Haha.  I started learning because I wanted a hobby that was also productive.  I was sick of wasting time online or watching TV. Heard some Kpop around the same time I decided to learn a new language, thought Korean sounded cool, so I started learning.  Friends and family thought that it was kinda weird and that I'd never use it, I live in a super small town.  But once you get familiar with a language, you kinda start seeing it everywhere.  Unexpectedly on TV.  Or someone shows you something online and it turns out you can understand it.   Through learning Korean I met my penpal, who is now a close friend.  I also made a friend who brought me along when she went back to Korea to visit her family! I've been able to get to know a new culture and help people understand my own. I've had tons of great experiences that I never would have had otherwise!   It helps me with job interviews if they ask me about my hobbies - a white person learning Korean really sticks in peoples' minds, haha. Not to mention it's just good exercise for your brain.  Worst case scenario:  You only use it with penpals.  That's still really rewarding!    Learning another language will never close any doors on you, and all it really costs is time. I'd say it's worth it!"
Korean,2zebne,Breadincaptivity,2,Tue Mar 17 23:01:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I guess i'll give it a try, doubt I will make any friends because of it as I'm awful with talking to people, no matter what language it is (I'd love to say that I'm fluent in English but I'm not sure about it, I'm also fluent in my native language), but as you said, learning a new language will never close any doors for me so there is no reason to not try it"

Korean,2zebne,Sciar,2,Wed Mar 18 23:02:16 2015 UTC,Honestly if you aren't in Korea it's got extremely limited uses and you're probably better off learning another language or a different skill altogether.   However you can learn because you enjoy it. Life isn't always about min maxing usefulness from every single thing. For example was replying on Reddit here the best use of my time? Fuck no! But I enjoyed it regardless so here I am.

It's casual:너 but other than that:   generally speak in third person. if the other person has a title like 형, 오빠, 어머니, 선생님, 사장님, 부장님, 고객님 use that. If not, you usually just omit the noun and go about the sentence~ 본인 is a more business-y word, but is unoffensive. it has some nuances (technically means ""original person"" or ""really you"" when confirming identity) but it's pretty safe 선생님 can be used often towards a person who does something (contexually relevant) better than you. e.g. your mechanic or something 당신 is a crazy word, don't attempt it. it can be overly affectionate or straight up rude if used in the wrong context.   If you can't decide on a word, just omit the noun completely. If you need to get their attention in a conversation, you could use ""혹시요"" (by the way/by chance)  I'll often just ask how I should address them ""어떻게 부르면 될까요?"""

Me and You could be any number of things depending on the context, and formality is big issue here... followed by slangs  Kind of like Greek and Latin roots in European languages Korean kind of has those things..   저 and 나 and formal and informal versions of me and they can be modified to and number of things depending the on sentence.   님, 니, 너, 그, and etc(I'm sure I'm forgetting something here) the first is formal with the last two being informal. Same as above these can be modified to fit the context. There is also 놈 and 년 for male version of bitch and just female form of bitch. (eg 이년 or 니년 is ""this bitch"" and 그년 or 저년 is ""that bitch""<-- note that 저 in this context isn't me but rather that... like how minute could mean small or length of time)"
Korean,2zbmu2,DrLuciferZ,1 point,Tue Mar 17 06:35:25 2015 UTC,"Your point holds, but just FYI the last example you give (minute - small and minute - length of time) doesn't really work. They started out as the same word, but with time have evolved into two separate words with completely different pronunciations, even if their spelling has stayed the same.  Minute (length of time) is pronounced (very) roughly like 민이트 and minute (small) is pronounced roughly 마이뉴트. A better example might be ""right"" - could mean ""correct"" or a direction.

Korean,2zbmu2,DrLuciferZ,2,Thu Mar 19 03:04:52 2015 UTC,"This was very hard to wrap my head around at first. Before getting too deep, there are generally two forms of each. There is ""humble speech"" and ""casual speech"" although there are a million different ways to describe these forms in English, none of which actually capture it quite right. For now, let's go with these.   In Humble form, 저 is me (제가 / 저는). Casual form is 나 (내가 / 나는). But these aren't used NEARLY as much as they are in English. If I had to guess, I would say we use ""me"" and ""I"" about 50 times more in English than they do in Korean, maybe even more.   As for you, they leave it out a lot too, here's a video to explain: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eUonS7knec&list=PLXqTnagA7889Of1EtwpOF0s0kq1SOUQGv&index=2"
Korean,2zbmu2,bigbirrrd,1 point,Tue Mar 17 06:13:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a simple question in Korean. I'm not that knowledgeable, but here is what I understand, so somebody correct me if I'm wrong:  Me: 저 is polite speech ""I"". 나 is casual speech ""I"".  And these forms can change depending on the marker. For example 나 + 는 can become 난.  You: 너 is casual form, but ""you"" is trickier because there isn't really a polite form.   I've heard ""당신"" is a direct translation, but it translates more like ""darling"" or ""dear""  ""여러분"" can mean something like ""you all"" but isn't singular.  When directly addressing someone, you should probably do something like talking about them in the 3rd person. So use their name or their title.  사장님: agentlemanscholar씨는 한국어를 잘 못 하지요.  ""You are not very good at Korean, are you?""  Me: 네, 맞아요. 사장님은 저보다 더 잘 해요.  ""Yes, that's right. You are better at [Korean] than me""  So the 사장 (president, CEO) used my name to talk to me directly, and I used his title (사장님) to talk to him directly."

Korean,2zak4e,wannaridebikes,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:11:14 2015 UTC,"This is the correct attitude, by the way. The stickers become a crutch. If you are a touch typist in English and want to do the same in Korean, then you need to force yourself to learn where the keys are without referencing them over and over again.  For what it's worth, I did it the way you're doing (basically going blind and hitting keys until I got the one I wanted) and now have a decent command of touch typing in Korean. I think you just need to do it frequently enough.  Also, while this isn't so much a tutoring program, it'll still work for practice: http://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/korean"
Korean,2zak4e,desperatechaos,2,Tue Mar 17 02:48:54 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks.  Yeah, I'm starting to learn Korean with a textbook and I'm making Anki flashcards and it's still kind of slow going.  But I guess I ought to just keep at it.    I think I've sussed out some of the rules:  the left hand is consonants; right is vowels.  The top row of consonants is all the ones that can be tensed, the bottom is aspirated consonants, the middle is neither.  On the right side, the top is diphthongs, the middle is a/eo, the bottom is u/eu kind of stuff.  I think.  I might be missing more rules.  Anyway that narrows down the number of guesses I need to make.  Thank God more thought went into this system than QWERTY."

When I think about it, I didn't learn the QWERTY keyboard blind and yet I can blind type with it,  and  I learned how to type Korean faster when I got stickers -- it seemed like a waste of mental energy to locate the characters blind, and that energy could've been spent on better hand-eye coordination (to eventual mental layout memorization, like with a game controller)."
Korean,2zak4e,ChipPhoenix,2,Tue Mar 17 07:12:59 2015 UTC,"You have a point. Most touch typists probably didn't learn completely blind, but at the same time being able to look at the keys probably is a reason why many people still suck at typing. I think it depends on the individual's attitude and motivation."

Piano is considered percussive in a way, because the sound is made by hammers hitting the strings rather than using fingers or a bow. Guitar could also be percussive in the sense that you hit the strings to strum.  Is there a difference for guitar based on how you are playing it? In other words, could I say 치다 for strumming, but 타다 for finger picking/plucking the strings? I guess the question would apply to other stringed instruments, too. Could you likewise say 켜다 while using the bow and 타다 while plucking the strings?"

One of the reasons is the bad quality of audio that phones have which isn't very useful when trying to listen accurately to another language. My suggestions would be moving from phone to online (hangouts, Skype, kakaotalk) for better quality first off - it doesn't have to be video you can keep it audio. If that's not possible then I recommend that you also communicate via instant message online or on your phone while talking for when you need to confirm spelling or pronunciation of words to each other. Hope that helps!"

Korean,2z7e5n,bigbirrrd,3,Tue Mar 17 20:53:17 2015 UTC,"I agree that switching to video chat would be best. Seeing the other person's mouth when they speak is so incredibly valuable. Even now, talking on the phone is significantly harder for me than talking in person.   Other than that, I would suggest preparing questions to discuss with them before the meeting. I have learned strictly through language exchange (for 3.5 years) without ever taking classes. So my knowledge of the language is all a result of questions I asked or something the other person decided to tell me. This means that my vocabulary and knowledge of the language is customized and relevant to me.   Seeing that you label yourself as a beginner, I'm assuming full on conversation is still hard. So that means that you need to ""download"" a lot more input before you can have a conversation. The best way to do so is through rich, dense experiences (someone trying really hard to explain a word to you - a funny story they tell you about an expression - the fact that you were eating a sandwich while they were explaining that word to you) all these tidbits of memory will come up later on when you remember that word/phrase. To this day I can still recall the place I was, person who taught me, and story through which I learned A LOT of words. This is how our brain works best. So use it to your advantage!   Good luck!"

Something I noticed in my experience, was that Koreans will often work very hard to make it seem like they understand what you're saying. If you ask them if they understand, they will often say ""Yes!"" immediately. This is how it is when they speak in Korean too. It's sometimes rude to tell the other person that you don't understand (especially when that person is above you in the hierarchy) because it's like saying ""You messed up and didn't make this clear to me. I don't want to be rude and make you feel like you messed up so I'll just say ""네."" Just something to be aware of. If she speaks ""no english at all"" and the conversations go for that long, she may be more confused than you think. Sometimes going over the same point multiple times can help them to understand and since they won't ask you to do so, you may have to do it yourself. I spend all day everyday teaching Korean people English so I'm VERY used to this phenomenon.   Keep cruising HelloTalk for someone with a bit higher English level and I'm sure there will be someone who's happy to help."

I think this shouldn't be taken so contextually, the sentence simply means, ""please take a good-care for / good-look at me""   I was saying it would be proper to do ""드리겠-습니다"" because it's just more formal / respectful.

Korean,2z37z0,ilaeriu,3,Sun Mar 15 03:30:11 2015 UTC,"People in the Seoul/Gyeonggi area tend to pronounce their verb endings that way.   같아 becomes 가테 바라 becomes 바레   Note I wrote 가테 because people (especially young people) in the area pronounce 가태 as 가테.  This difference in pronunciation only affects some verb endings:   막아 does not become 마게   But then it also affects some nouns as well:   아기 becomes 에기 for most people in the area   And it differs from region to region   Can't think of an example but in Incheon some verb roots undergo this change as well Don't know if this is from Incheon but some people pronounce 학교 as 헤꾜   What do you call this change? It doesn't have a name but it's classified as ""vowel fronting."" Vowels like 이, 에, 애 are called ""front vowels"" in linguistics. Something that wasn't one has changed into one for some people with some words.  Is it related to the vowel fronting in 네 (which moves 네 even more to the front to become 니)? I don't know."

Besides 바라다 and 같다, as you mentioned 막다 doesn't, but maybe others that aren't as common?  Oh and you're writing ""에기"" because that's how it's pronounced, right? Even tho it's written 애기 or 같애 everywhere."
Korean,2z37z0,Trevarr,3,Mon Mar 16 15:57:52 2015 UTC,I'm not really sure...  I found a 국립국어원 article... but it didn't fully explain 가태/가테.

Korean,2z37z0,Trevarr,2,Mon Mar 16 19:54:50 2015 UTC,"http://www.korean.go.kr/nkview/nklife/1999_3/9_9.html  This doesn't seem to explain 같아/같애, but it seems to explain 아기/애기.    Vowel fronting can only be seen when there's a consonant between a back vowel (which is fronted) and the /이/ vowel. The consonant is most probably labial or velar. (ㅁㅂㅍ are labial. ㄱㅋㄲㅇ are velar.)   하필>해필 남비>냄비 왕겨>왱겨 막히다>맥히다>매키다 먹히다>멕히다>메키다 먹이다>멕이다>메기다   But when the consonant in between is alveolar like ㄴㄷㅌㄸㅅ or palatal like ㅈㅊㅉ then vowel fronting is restricted. The reason 모기, 거미 don't show vowel fronting is because when vowel fronting would have happened historicaly, the words had been 모긔, 거믜 which don't satisfy the conditions for vowel fronting. However, there are cases in some dialects where the liquid ㄹ shows vowel fronting.   나리다>내리다 다리다>대리다 버리다>베리다 차리다>채리다   Another condition that restricts vowel fronting is vowel length. Even when a labial or velar consonant is between vowels, vowel fronting is unlikely to happen in phrases like:   밤이 (chestnut) doesn't change to 뱀이 감이 (persimmon) ditto 곰이 (bear) ditto 숨이 (breath) ditto 농이 ditto 중이 ditto   I don't understand the following part very well so I can't translate it; but in the following cases, where vowel fronting has happened after ㅅㅈ, it can be considered that the restrictions have been weakened and vowel fronting has been expanded:  움라우트 규칙의 적용을 제약하는 또 하나의 조건은 음장이다. 앞에서 언급한 움라우트의 실현 조건인 동화주와 피동화주 사이에 순자음이나 연구개자음이 개재되어 있더라도 피동화주의 모음이 음장을 가지고 있으면 '밤:-이→뱀:이[栗], 감:-이→갬:이[柿], 곰:-이→굄:이[熊], 숨:-이→*쉼:이[呼吸] ; 농:-이→농:이～뇡이 중:-이→중:이～쥥이' 등에서와 같이 움라우트가 일어나기 어렵다. 장모음은 한 단어나 한 발음 단락의 첫 음절에서만 실현되고 용언의 경우는 어간에만 적용되는 규칙인데 모음어미 앞에서는 그 음장이 소거되기 때문에 주로 단음절어의 체언에서 관찰되는 것이지만, 형태소 내부에서는 동화주와 피동화주 사이에 음장이 개재하더라도 '소:경>쇠:경, 소:견>쇠:견' 등에서와 같이 피동화주 모음에 ㅅ이나 ㅈ 등의 자음이 선행할 때는 움라우트가 실현되는 경우가 있는데 이는 움라우트의 제약이 약화되어 움라우트가 확장된 것으로 볼 수 있다.   소ː경>쇠ː경 소ː견>쇠ː견   But in some cases you can see vowel fronting even with alveolar and palatal sounds:   맡기다>맏기다>막기다>마끼다>매끼다 쫓기다>쫃기다>쪽기다>쪼끼다>쬐끼다 안기다>앙기다>앵기다   These cases involve consonant assimilation where the alveolar and palatal sounds have been assimilated to labial or velar sounds before vowel fronting rules applied, satisfying the rules for vowel fronting. You can see consonant assimilation rules apply before vowel fronting rules.  And when there are consonant clusters that include ㄹ in between vowel fronting can also be observed. This is the result of consonant cluster reduction rules applying before vowel fronting rules, satisfying the conditions of vowel fronting.   옮기다>옴기다>옹기다>욍기다 곪기다>곰기다>공기다>굉기다"

So i guess the question that arises from this is... what gives? What made 내리다 become the 표준어 but 대리다 and 베리다 stayed 다리다 and 버리다    Alright so, without deleting what I wrote up there, it looks like we're not just talking about 서울/경기도 anymore? Again i can only go off basically what naver has in it's 오픈국어 section, but at the bottom, looking up 욍기다 gives me both 강원도 and 제주도.  However I'm still not sure how 아기 becomes 애기[에기] based on these rules, which one does it fall under? The first one? Seeing as stuff like 먹이다 getting fronted to 멕이다 could follow that... 악이 --> 액이  But that might be a different 이론 for a different time, where everything in Korean has hidden 사람을 뜻하는 ""이""s everywhere.    Oh and as a final thought, 안기다 becoming 앵기다... That's 안기다 as in 안다의 사동사 as in hug, right?"

I mean, a lot of the pronunciation changes I've noticed (and had to adapt to myself) like  하려고 ---> 할려고 for instance, just seem to be a result of making it easier on the mouth to say - aka laziness. Perhaps that's why there doesn't seem to be a clear linguistic theory as to why this is.   I also notice that these kind of changes usually occur with the most commonly spoken words - 하려고 / 애기 / 같애 all fitting that description.   Anyway, that's just my 2 원. ㅋㅋ"

Well... can't really give you a /why/, and in that same vein we're not really looking as to ""what caused it"", but rather a ""why"" as in a rule that explains ""why x does y"".  You can see that kjoonlee found rules explaining how back vowels can get pushed halfway between 이 --> but these rules are only being applied within the words themselves, like 나리다>내리다 and 하필>해필. But! These rules don't explain 같아>같애 and 바라>바래. Seeing as we don't really have any examples besides these two, and this is happening in conjugation, rather than pre-conjugation like all the examples kjoonlee found.

I'd be interesed in seeing if this change starts to occure in other verbs in the future. My layman's theory (after giving it some thought for like 10 minutes) is that the back vowel proceeding the alveolar consonant in 같아 changes the back vowel to a front vowel, because the tongue is already near the front to pronounce the alveolar ㅌ? But then we'd expect to start seeing this in a lot of other words with similar environments as well..."

Korean,2z37z0,Trevarr,1 point,Wed Mar 18 16:06:50 2015 UTC,Actually 바래 and 같애 are wrong grammar. Especially many koreans confuse 바라 and 바래 because there is verb ending '-래' in korean that means 'say to do'. Also there is another verb 바래다 that has similar pronounce with 바라다. So many koreans think that 바래 is probable to be right.
Korean,2z37z0,KangM,2,Sun Mar 15 06:09:33 2015 UTC,"I would argue this, because if you were to confuse ""바래"" as ""~라고 해"", it would mean that the verb is ""바다"" (which is a noun, not a verb), and a 줄임말 of 바라고 해.  It's much more likely that the sounds just came out of some extra ""이"" from some 사투리 somewhere, and became widespread. ""애"" is ""아이"" and both 같아 and 바라 with an added ""이"" could easily be shortened to ""같애 (같아이)"" and ""바래 (바라이)"".  You could also say that they're simply getting ""바래다"" and ""바라다"" confused. Naver dictionary even lists 바래다 as a 잘못 of 바라다-- but that's a bit of a stretch (in my opinion) as you aren't very likely to see ""바랩니다"" very many places in my experience, but ""바랍니다"" is quite common, esp in the metro, etc."
Korean,2z37z0,Trevarr,0,Mon Mar 16 15:38:19 2015 UTC,"There are two different verbs '바래다' and '바라다' ('바다' means sea). As you know '바라다' means 'wish' but '바래다' means  'fade', 'lose color'. People are rarely confused  '바랩니다' and '바랍니다'. But really many people use '바래요', '바래' as 'wish', tough they mean 'fade' ('바라요', 바라' mean 'wish'). So '바라다', '바라(요)' and '바랍니다' mean 'wish' and '바래다', '바래(요)'and '바랩니다' mean 'fade'."
Korean,2z37z0,KangM,1 point,Tue Mar 17 04:20:38 2015 UTC,"You're basically getting at what I was saying.  Yes, people use 바래요 for 바라요-- but it has nothing to do with ~라고 해, and no, they are not confusing the ""real"" 바래다 with 바라다. 바래요 is just an acceptable 구어체 version of 바라요 in modern korean.

Korean,2yzvl8,TowelieMcTowel07,22,Sat Mar 14 06:09:45 2015 UTC,"Hmm why not start TTMIK lessons. Some people say that they are just Koreans practicing their English, but if you actually complete even up to level 8, you can learn some pretty handy grammar rules as well as vocabulary here and there. Coupled with your own study, you should be able to have some good basic conversation after that.  You should also find ""Using Korean: A guide to Contemporary Usage"" by Miho Choo handy to learn and brush up on Korean grammar.  When I began learning, I also downloaded the 4000 most common words (may or may not be the most common depending on who says so) then start to learn 10 per day and highlight remembered words.  Try to obtain the book called ""Handbook of Korean Vocabulary: A Resource for Word Recognition and Comprehension"" which comes in handy for more vocab acquisition. I used to enjoy reading this book if I had leisure time.  Once your skill begins to improve, check out the website: https://sites.google.com/site/matthewpluskoreanequalsfun/ it has some handy phrases that demonstrate the use of live korean vocab and grammar, learn the phrases, then begin to experiment with changing the words.  Once your skill is somewhat basic and you can talk about simple things just start pushing Korean out even if it is wrong, as the meaning will still be conveyed, and Koreans can help correct you, or as you continue studying you will realise that you made some errors and will remember for next time.  I think it is key to try to speak some words, phrases--anything, to help with remembering words.  Try to listen to Korean media, tv shows, radio programs etc to help your listening skill.   Try to not translate into english as much as you can. For example 고양이 translates to 'cat' in english, but try to get into the mindset of 고양이 is 고양이.  The ""Integrated Korean"" series is pretty fun and good to use, my only problem with that was each lesson was painfully slow for me, and the beginners volume 1 and 2 i think should have been condensed into one book.  Once your skill is beginning to improve, use language exchange apps (HelloTalk is not too bad) and any other language exchange site. I live in Sydney and there are language exchange groups on meetup.com and facebook which have a high attendance rate which i thought was surprising.  Other resources include - Korean dictionary   Read korean blogs on naver, or daum, they are usually easier for beginners to read than news papers Use your local library for Korean childrens books (my library also has korean movies with korean subs.) If you watch american movies or drama and cannot find subs for them, usually if you have korean friends or exchange buddy you have been using for a while then sometimes they may get the subs for you if you do not know where to get them from. Living Language: Korean is also a cool resource Korean Grammar in Use is also a good book Korean, A comprehensive Grammar is a nice book to read casually in leisure time. http://koreangrammaticalforms.com/ is a nice site to use to look up grammar that is new to you and for grammar you are unsure of. Naver and Daum dictionaries for looking up unknown words if you do not have a dictionary on hand. dongsa.net is a great tool for beginners to learn conjugations.   If i think of any more, then I will add to it."

Korean,2yzvl8,andresAKU,6,Sat Mar 14 16:56:23 2015 UTC,"Neither of them means please.  하십시오 is the politer, the more formal way of saying ""Do!"" This word is 하다 (verb; to do) + 십시오 (polite/formal command verb-ending)  좀 is the contraction of 조금 which literally means ""a lil bit."" If this adverb is used in a request or a command, it's likely that the person is trying to sound nicer.  tl;dr. They can be translated to ""please"" in English, but neither of them actually means ""please."" In fact, there is no literal equivalence to ""please"" in Korean as sentences are structured differently.

Is one just informal and one is formal? Why are there so many ways to say one thing? If i dont say the ""right"" version is that forgivable? or will i seem rude if i use the wrong version?   Its so confusing when watching a movie in Korean then having to stop because they said a sentence i know but in a different way, and i have to look it up or pop on subtitles quickly, its so frustrating, is there a simply logical way to tell different meanings apart?   Also in one of the movies i was watching(Public Enemy) there was a super market, but the way it was written was one of the symbols was inside a ㅁ but in a way i have never seen written before, what does this mean?   I also noticed in movies the fluent speakers either skip or bunch up a bunch of words, for example i have heard 안녕하세요 being pronounced just 안녕하세 is this just because they are speaking fast, or are they using ""slang""?  Much appreciated thank you."
Korean,2yzvl8,andresAKU,1 point,Sun Mar 15 13:53:50 2015 UTC,"Since you are just starting to learn Korean, I'd just answer it briefly and not delve too much into the mechanics. (I don't think it'll help in this stage of learning.)  There are many ways to express the same idea. For instance in English, one can say ""Excuse me,"" ""I beg your pardon,"" ""Pardon me,"" ""If you'll excuse me,"" ""Sorry,"" etc. There may be subtle differences among those expressions based on the formality, situations, context, or the people that are involved in the dialogue. Likewise, one can say ""Would you slow down, please,"" or ""Please speak slowly"" again based on the context (or they may be completely same things but the speaker at the time decided to use one expression over others.)  So there is no real single right expression in any language. (Except that 속도가 느린 말할 수있다 is just wrong grammar and the wrong expression.)  I'm afraid if you're completely ignoring grammar and simply decided to memorize expressions, which can help you get by in the beginning. But in the long run, without grammar, you will not understand why and how the expressions are structured in certain ways. For instance, -겠, (from 실례하겠습니다) connotes the notion of expectation/uncertainty/future. And as long as you speak the certain way (i.e. end the sentences with 하십시오체 or 해요체), you will not come across as rude in most cases.  Regards to the shape of the symbol inside ㅁ, in the movie, I wouldn't know without seeing the symbol myself. But I have a strong feeling that you are looking at a Hanja. Some of the hanja that you could have seen from the movie could be 囚, 圓, 固, 國, 園, 回 (Again, not having seen the movie, I'm not at all sure.)  Koreans tend to slur words when they speak. Sometimes the speed at which they speak the words are not adapt to new listeners and you just need to get used to the sounds to really hear what they are saying. Again, I'm not familiar with the movie so I can't really say much."
Korean,2yzvl8,iamkoalafied,2,Mon Mar 16 06:36:44 2015 UTC,"god damnit, this is so damn confusing, i keep doing so good then coming to a stop once i try to test myself and correct it, i tried to write myself ""I have a chair"". So i write, 나는 의자를있다 but then i go to a translator to see if i got it right and it comes up as 나는 의자를 가지고.  if 이다 to be/are/am/was/were?  and 있다 is to have or be at?  then what is 가지고?"
Korean,2yzvl8,Vega_IRon,2,Mon Mar 16 23:43:12 2015 UTC,"In this case, translator is wrong as well. FYI, Google translator or the similar online translators almost never gives a correct translation. Get away from them as much as possible :)  However, the correct way to say ""I have a chair"" would be either [Topic clause] 의자가 있다 or (나는) 의자를 가지고 있다.   Now, 이다 is equal sign.  i.e. ) 나는 사람이다 (I am a human) 나 = 사람; I = human.  있다 means to exist   의자가 있다 - A chair exists : There is a chair 나는 의자가 있다 - As for me, a chair exists : the chair exists to me (I have a chair) (내가) 의자를 가지고 있다 - I own/have a chair.   가지다 is a verb to own and it usually forms a compound 가지고 있다 to emphasize the subject's possession of the object."
Korean,2yzvl8,Gouko,1 point,Tue Mar 17 03:45:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you, i think im starting to get a lot of this stuff now, can you use 가지고 on its own without the  있다 to say i have ownership over said chair, like 나는 의자를있다, is this correct at all? or do i have to inlcude 가지고?   Also i finally got some Korean learning books and now im trying to learn them with the lessons, all the sudden im at a complete hault, i thought i knew how to read it and now it just throws a curve ball at me and i have no idea how to continue. So apparently when half of the god damn letters appear at the end of a syllable its changed all the sudden to a different sound? With absolutely no logic behind it, where as i was following before because Hangul had a lot of simple logic to it, it just completely threw all that logic out the window and caused a lot of frustrations.  So if a lot of the letters change the sound at the end of a syllable why dont they just write the letter for the sound it will become instead? example: why is ㅅ pronounced as ㄷ at the end of a syllable? why dont they just use ㄷ? It would be like if all the sudden D in english sometimes means Z..WHY?"

(edit: may be earlier or later - the name was famous in the eighties.)  The max length for names (5 except for the family name, not ""under five"") was established in 1993, but people can still have 2-letter family names, so people can probably still have 7 letters in their full name, I think.  서수한무거북이와두루미삼천갑자동방삭치치카포사리사리센타워리워리세브리깡무두셀라구름이허리케인에담벼락담벼락에서생원서생원에고양이고양이엔바둑이바둑이는돌돌이 was a fake name used in a comedy skit.

I couldn't find the original sketch or its revivals on YouTube or Naver.  Basically the skit is about a father who wanted his son to live long, so he had a fortune teller come up with a long and auspicious name. However, the fortune teller warned that the child would die if this happened: ""빠트리면 죽는다."" The father interpreted it as ""leave out a letter and the child dies"" so everyone in the whole village was very careful to pronounce the kid's name in full.  But one day the child fell into water and when someone tried to report the accident, the kid's name was so long that it took ages to get things sorted out and before anything could be done, the kid drowned. Turned out 빠트리다 meant ""to let fall into water,"" not ""skip a letter."""

I think yours is grammatically correct.  But ""미안해 하지마"" sounds better to me  and Google search gives me   6,280 results for ""미안하지마"" and  73,600 results for ""미안해 하지마"".

The asterisk describes something that doesn't make sense. *크지 말아라. ""Don't be big."" Ditto. *미안하지 말아라. ""Don't be sorry."" Ditto.   So to use a command you naturally have to use an action verb. To turn 미안하다 into an action verb you say 미안해 하다. And to turn that into a negative command you say 미안해 하지마.  Special cases:   크지 말아라. ""Don't grow."" 크다 here is an action verb, not a descriptive verb. 제발 작아라. ""Please please please let it be small."" Hoping for something to be small."

I'm also studying Korean at my university so getting some practice down was really important, and I love the language in general.  Basically I'd just ask people ""what's up"" or anything rudimentary. You don't need a magic opening line, and I found it especially easy around 홍대입구 and other university areas where people are more inclined to be social.  I can't give you anecdotes on what I said at the start but it was nothing magical as I mentioned before, be genuine. Are they wearing a cool watch? Say something about it. Cool hair? Ask them about their product.  I did this constantly and made a lot of friends and had a lot of fleeting conversations with store clerks and strangers alike. Just do the same thing you'd do in English but in Korean instead.  Just be confident in what you say, laugh at your mistakes (there will be many) and be genuine. Don't try and put on a face for the sake of talking to someone!!  Side note:  There is this stigma about talking to people in the street for the sake of talking to them, or so I have heard (Talk To Me In Korean and Seoulistic mentioned it I believe). However, I found that to be a load of bollocks with regards to my experience, so don't let that demotivate you.  It's the same with America, or Australia, or wherever being ""all Christian"" it's not true and its a sweeping generalisation.  It's a rather vague explanation but I'm on my phone now, and I can't type as fast as I think on this device; so when I am at my PC I'll flesh this out in more detail if you'd like."

""Nice weather today"" for example.  But I think what he's saying is that thinking all Koreans dislike small talk is similar to thinking all Americans are Christian - not true. ...But I could be wrong.    Anyway, when I went to Korea, people on the street did not seem quite as open to small talk, but people in convenience stores or people working at restaurants would definitely strike up a conversation.  But I was not there for very long, so I definitely can't speak to trends as a whole."

Really it works with anyone who is listening to music that you can also hear. You can find some neat new music this way as well!

So while it might be great to find random people on the street to talk to, you might end up with more luck and longer conversations with people like storekeepers, taxi drivers, etc who you can approach under some ordinary context.

End of the day, the 천자문 and similar kinds of works are going to be disappointing for students looking for practical, immediately usable information. These are less concerned with teaching characters and more about increasing familiarity with classical reference and literary concepts. Unless you're looking to start reading ancient texts, it might just be best to go over Sino-korean vocabulary you're already comfortable with, associate Hanja with things you know, put 도덕/덕분 type connections together then build from there. Or, for a heritage speaker/advanced student situation, the first section of Miho Choo and William O'Grady's ""Handbook of Korean Vocabulary"" has its use for accelerating that connection building process."

When learning the Korean keyboard layout, people often will pull up a picture of the keyboard layout so they have something to look at, or they will buy a new keyboard or stickers for their keyboard to help them out. So if you find being able to look at the keyboard to be helpful, just try pulling up a picture :)"

For example:  Rules:  -20 On 20 Off: 20 Minutes all Korean. 20 Minutes English.  -During the Korean time, Beginners' task is to jot down things that spark their interest, or that they are unsure about. Don't write everything you don't know.  -During English time, questions are asked and answered.  -Advanceds' task: stay on topic and try to be as accurate as possible.

Group voice calls would be awesome to learn about pronunciation and listening to people speak.  However, I don't agree with this:   One thing that happens is everyone ends up speaking English. So I suggest if this were to happen, you have a conversation chat where you can't speak English except for clarifying things, and a general discussion chat where you can ask out of context questions about stuff like grammar.   Having two chats would make things pretty segregated for such a small-ish community, and I don't know if everyone would like to constantly check through two chats. I would rather just have everything in one chat, I don't particularly care if people are speaking English as long as it relates to Korean language learning."

So having 2 chats would give us room to talk about the language, and room to practice speaking with each other, in addition to people speaking with each other in the Skype calls. It's not necessarily segregation, it's just having 2 areas for different purposes. No one would be refused entrance to one of the chats."

Korean,2ybohw,gamer2028,6,Sun Mar 8 09:15:09 2015 UTC,"Hangul is a great script and, in my opinion, it is very easy to learn the basics of it if you put your mind to it. To remember the individual phonetic sounds is fairly easy!     It is does however get more complex the deeper you get into learning. Firstly because while the letters may have similar ways of expressing the sounds in English it is not exactly the same. So for example ""으"" is usually romanized as ""eu"" or just ""u"" however these romanizations are not perfect translations so you do need to actually hear it rather than just through English romanizations.  The second issue is while the sounds are simple to learn in isolation, when they are put in combination with other letters the sounds may change. So I will use the simple example of ""입니다"" which is made up of ㅣ= ee/I ㅂ= b/p ㄴ= n 이= ee ㄷ= d/t ㅏ= a    So combining that it should sound something like ""ipnida"" if we were doing it purely directly from the sounds you will be taught. In reality it sounds closer to ""imnida"" due to a grammar rule involving the combination of ㅂ and ㄴ in 입니다. I hope this makes sense. I also really hope I didn't put you off Hangul. It is so rewarding to learn and you can really pick it up quickly! You should learn from today if possible! I just wanted to prepare you for frustration or confusion once you get deeper into learning the language! Good luck with all your studies mate =)"

Korean,2y9iim,thecrazycatman,6,Sat Mar 7 19:04:40 2015 UTC,"Greetings all,  I'm using GoBilly's Korean study book and in one of the practise questions he asks us to translate from ENG to KOR:     Who is Mr. Park?   So I wrote:  박 씨는 누구입니까?  But, the textbook says the correct way to say it is:  박 씨가 누구입니까?   How come we aren't using the topic market 는? Aren't we talking about Mr. Park and asking ""who is he?"", same way when we talk about ourselves, we use (for example) 서는?     Another question asks:   Who do you love?   So I wrote:  누가 사랑합니까? (where 누구+가 = 누가)  But the correct way is: 누구를 사랑합니까?     Why? From what I read, you use the subject marker to mark something that is doing something (like dog eating food, or cat liking human). But in the first example, Mr. Park isn't doing anything, he simply exists. We are asking ourselves/others the question, but since we aren't directly asking YOU specifically, there is no reason to put the subject marker?  Would love some clarification. Thanks!   I am still not advanced so take what I say with a pinch of salt. So for the first sentence I will briefly talk about 이/가. This particle is basically put after what is 'active' in terms of the verb. So the verb in the sentence is the ""입니다"" which is the verb for 'being'. So when it is 가 in this case it is put after the noun of who 'is'.  So the noun is the 'subject' of the verb 'being'. If you were asking in terms of comparing with other people possibly you could use 는.     In terms.of the use of 를 in the second sentence it is because it is the object being loved rather than the subject doing the loving.  Sorry if this is confusing the particles are but eventually it will click trust me =)"

Korean,2y9iim,gobillykorean,5,Sat Mar 7 23:35:31 2015 UTC,"Hi~ I personally wouldn't stress so much about the first one, at least until you've had a chance to read through the complete lesson about 는/은 vs. 이/가. They're not simple to understand when to use each one, and often both can be correct in a sentence. However I would worry about the second question you have since the uses of 이/가 (Subject Marker) and 을/를 (Object Marker) are more different.  I think there are already some great answers here so I'll make mine a short version. 누구 stays as 누구 when it's being used as the object (whenever any verb is doing anything to it). So if someone ""loves"" 누구, or ""is looking for"" 누구, then something is being done to 누구 and it stays as 누구. If, however, 누구 is the one doing something, then you'd add 가 and it becomes 누가 as you wrote. So if 누구 ""loves"" someone, or if 누구 ""is not here"" then that 누구 is doing something and therefore becomes the subject of the verb and needs 가, becoming 누가."

Korean,2y9iim,Breadincaptivity,5,Tue Mar 10 03:00:07 2015 UTC,"With textbook examples, it's sometimes hard because you're not having a conversation, you're just reading isolated sentences. These particles get a lot more intuitive in longer conversations!  For your second question:  You basically wrote ""Who loves?""  사랑하다's subject is the person who loves. The object is the person being loved.  Which is why the answer is 누구를 사랑합니까?   For your first question: we are asking who someone is.  But what person are we asking that about? Which person is doing 누구입니까? Mr. Park is.  So the way to identify that is by using 박 씨가.    For what you wrote, imagine you and I are about to meet with two people that I don't really know, you just told me they are called Mr. Park and Mr. Lee.  ""박 씨가 누구예요?"" Who is Mr. Park?   ""우리 한국어 선생님이에요.""  He's my Korean teacher.  ""아, 그렇군요.  이 씨는 누구예요?"" Oh, I see. Then who is Mr. Lee?  ""우리 수학 선생님이에요."" He's my math teacher.  For the first person I asked you about, I just use 가.  I'm saying, ""hey, at the end of my sentence, there's gonna be a verb, and this guy is the one who is doing that verb, okay?""  (Because he IS doing something. He is being 'who.')    And then, since we just established who Mr. Park is, now I want to find out who Mr. Lee is.  So when I use 는, I'm saying, ""Okay, as for Mr. Lee, who is he?""  I'm emphasizing that we've changed who we're talking about.  Hope that helps! Also, side note - I think I've heard in a few different sources that it's rude to use 씨 with just someone's last name... Or am I crazy? I know you didn't write the book, but that seemed weird to me."
Korean,2y9iim,Breadincaptivity,1 point,Sat Mar 7 20:32:56 2015 UTC,"헉... 저는 이해합니다... i think.  I watched GoBilly's video on the subject marker and topic marker, read a TTMIK lesson and then read your two comments. From what I understand is:  Using 은/는 is basically saying ""as for ____"".  For the first example:   박 씨가 누구입니까?   It wouldn't make sense to use 박 씨는 누구입니까? because we aren't asking Mr. Park himself who he is, but rather the reader (or in your example, your friend). This way your friend can answer that    ""Mr. Park is ____"".    The ""가"" example TTMIK lesson used was that if someone were to come up to you and ask you, from a basket of fruits, which one was an apple, you'd use the 가/이 particle on the Apple, implying that ""THIS is an apple"".  Also, I understand the ""who do you love"" question, because without the 를 you can't really answer the question since the question isn't clear (right?).  EDIT: TBH it still isn't 100% clear to me, but I think I will practise it on HelloTalk and see how it works. From my understanding a lot of Koreans don't know how to explain the usage of the two markers (source: TTMIK lesson, GoBilly video), so I shouldn't really get discouraged by not understanding this right away."
Korean,2y9iim,Enigmers,3,Sat Mar 7 23:30:27 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, it is definitely something that comes with practice, and then when you get use to them, you start dropping them anyway, haha.  Consider this: If I came up to you out of the blue and said, ""Speaking of Mr. Park, who is he?""  It would be a little weird, right? Weirder than if I came up and just said, ""Who's Mr. Park?""    Maybe it will help to keep in mind that the topic marker also can be used to make broader statements.  사과는 빨개요.  Apples are red.  Vs. 사과가 빨개요.  (The) apple is red. Now, you might say what about 사과들이 빨개요. But this would be (The) apples are red.  So when you ask who someone is, you're making a pretty specific inquiry, right? You're asking about one specific guy.  So the subject marker is very natural to use. 박 씨가 누구예요?   Like I said, with these isolated textbook examples, it can be a little frustrating.  You definitely can be understood if you use 는 in that case, it's just that it might be putting a little unintended emphasis on that part of your sentence."
Korean,2y9iim,gobillykorean,3,Sun Mar 8 00:15:44 2015 UTC,"I'm posting again because 1. I'm on mobile and can't reply to myself for some reason... 2. While answering your questions, I was thinking about WHY this is so confusing at first...  Caution:  This is just me thinking out loud, kinda, so just stop reading if you don't like it, and ignore me!    I think there are two things that throw people off in cases like this:  1. The Subject vs Topic relationship and 2. What an interrogative word really is.  For subject/topic: Imagine a kid's essay in English.  ""Cupcakes.  I love cupcakes.  My mom makes them. My dad eats them.  I help eat and make them. Cupcakes are great.""    Cupcakes were not actually the grammatical subject of any of those sentences until the last one. But they are still the topic the entire time. So you can see how subjects and topics relate.    Subject and object are all about clearing up what's going on with your verbs.  Topic is more like the topic sentence of a paragraph to me. If I threw in some random sentence about bananas in my cupcake paragraph, I'd get scolded by my teacher. I'd have to transition to bananas first.  As for interrogative words:  They are just filler words that request information. Pretend we're robots and you have to turn everything into a math statement.  ""Who are you?""  Change that to a statement.  ""You are who.""  Change it to what it really is: ""You are x."" (In cases like this, you use 누구)  ""Who ate my lunch?""  ""Who ate my lunch."" ""X ate my lunch."" (In cases like this, you'd use 누가)  And then our ? just requests that the listener input the value of x. You can do this for all of our interrogative words (though some more easily than others).  Once I thought of interrogative words in this way, it really helped me. I'd been taking their function for granted because I don't have to think about them in English, but I was having trouble as I startled learning Korean.  Anyway, ignore this if it's confusing.  Just kinda wondering aloud, maybe it'll help, maybe not.  Particles can be rough at first, but remember all the trouble people have diagramming sentences in English? Particles definitely make that easier..."
Korean,2y9iim,Jean_Cut_Offs,2,Sat Mar 7 20:54:19 2015 UTC,"For ""Who do you love"", the ""who"" is actually the object, not the subject (the subject is ""you"", but that's typically left out). That's why 를 is there."
Korean,2y9iim,CapitalOneBanksy,3,Sat Mar 7 20:12:52 2015 UTC,How would I include the subject marker in that sentence then (Who do YOU love?)  당신이 누구를 사랑합니까?
Korean,2y8od5,marriedtoamazement,54,Sat Mar 7 14:17:16 2015 UTC,"Not learning korean but learning japanese and french here.   Just consider yourself as a baby learning a new language. What do you think when you see a baby making a mistake? ""Boy, that baby is dumb as hell""? Nope, you just see a cute baby trying to learn the world. Being a baby frees you from all the social pressures that adults has to consider when having a conversation. Everyone understands you're still in a learning process, no one will laugh at you for trying to learn.  Now go and ba ba boo boo my friend."
Korean,2y8od5,qria,3,Sat Mar 7 14:40:42 2015 UTC,"This is very good advice. For the most part, people aren't mean, and if they understand your circumstances, they will take their time to listen. It's been 3 years since learning Japanese and I still make mistakes daily but everyone has been supportive and didn't judge me based on how bad my Japanese was.   Like they say, without mistakes, there is no way you'd get better(I feel like most Japanese trying to learn English is the same way) , so keep on trying, it wouldn't hurt."

Korean,2y8od5,bigbirrrd,9,Tue Mar 10 01:48:57 2015 UTC,"Part of learning a language is simply learning not to be so shy. Don't take yourself too seriously. Learning a language involves repeatedly making an idiot of yourself thousands of times in front of others. Learn to deal with it - every adult language learner goes through exactly the same thing. The shier you are, the more scared you are of making mistakes, the slower you'll learn. If you are super timid, you simply won't learn the language at all."
Korean,2y8od5,feedmefeces,5,Sat Mar 7 14:48:39 2015 UTC,"When I started learning I was shy as hell myself. I'm not even good at expressing myself in my native language, so the thought of putting myself out there in a foreign one was just too scary for me. For the longest time I just listened to Korean, refusing to post on Lang-8 or reach out to any natives, (not that there were any in my area), because I was so worried about making silly mistakes.  One thing I learned after my first few posts on Lang-8, though, was that yeah, it can get a bit embarrassing at first when you make silly mistakes and your post is riddled with corrections, but it's also the fastest way to learn. Now anymore I try and make mistakes even though I hated it at first, because it solidifies for me what's correct about what I'm trying to say and what's not. Also, I started to realize any laughs over something I'd said weren't necessarily to make fun of me, but because the sentence itself was just quite silly. After a while you start to be able to laugh at your funny sentences as well, (for example, when I told a Korean I would boil some water, and accidentally said I would boil the door). In my experience, no one's making fun of you and they legitimately want to help. Also, like qria said, you really are like a baby. This means no one expects it of you to be able to speak the language at a high level with no mistakes, but when you can it's extra surprising for them. Nothing is better than when you speak to a new Korean for the first time and their face lights up, and they start rattling off about how surprised they are and happy you're interested in their language :)"
Korean,2y8od5,rubberlover,5,Sat Mar 7 18:14:08 2015 UTC,"I am teaching Korean myself, but I sometimes find my own language hard. I learned a lot about my mother tongue.  In addition, we all make mistakes in our mother tongue. I don't know what your mother tongue is, but native English speakers make a lot of mistakes, too. These are examples:   Peruse - read thoroughly or lightly? You need to get some lie down or lay down?   If your mother tongue is not English, then find out about them. I know that there are many common mistakes native speakers make.   Then, why so serious about the mistakes? We used our mother tongue for a long time and still make mistakes, it is natural to make them if you are learning now.   Finally, many Korean think that it is really great of you to study Korean. Most of them are having hard time to learn English, they know how hard it is to learn a new language. They don't tease you or think you are strange even if you make a lot of mistakes. They would think it is cute and awesome.   Don't be so serious about your mistakes. Just have fun with Korean."

Most Korean people are just happy that we're learning, they'll be very encouraging!  I was pretty shy about actually speaking during my trip to Korea until I drank a little with the family I stayed with.  I really don't drink ever, but that actually was a pretty good way to stop caring about whether I made mistakes!   Obviously there's a point of diminishing returns, though... Drink too much and you won't speak either language well, haha.  If you start putting yourself out there now, in a month you'll wonder what you were so worried about! Good luck!

However, I have found that Lang-8 is a great place to practice. I honestly don't feel any pressure to get it right! Everyone there is learning a language, and they certainly expect us to make mistakes. Don't worry about it, really!

Korean,2y8783,waeguk_oppa,28,Sat Mar 7 09:14:28 2015 UTC,"The oldest text written in Korean (not Hangul) is from the 6th century(not very old), written with Hyangchal (Linguists can decode it). The first Hangul record is from 1443. Although linguists can decode the meanings from the documents from 1443, listening would be a lot more difficult. This video shows you the reconstructed speech of the 15th century Korean (Middle Korean). The biggest differences between back then and now is that Middle Korean had tones (Yes, Hangul had tone marks), that ㅅ-ends and ㄷ-ends were different, and that ㅐ, ㅔ were diphthongs and they had 'are-a', a lost vowel (maybe a schwa) and many other unused sounds in the modern language. Also, the vocabulary was a lot different (example: 하다 in 15th century meant ""many""). So yeah, if modern Koreans went back to the 15th century Joseon Dynasty, they won't understand a thing.  What about the 16th century? in 1592, Japanese envaded Korea, and took milions of lives. The nominative marker '가' was adopted from Japanese, 'are-a' sound disappears, vowel shifts take place, and tones disappear.   Then in the 17th-18th century, palatalization occurs, a lot of changes occur. ㅐ, ㅔ become monophthongs, '-겠-' appear, etc. Maybe at this time, spoken language becomes partially understandable to normal modern Koreans."
Korean,2y8783,mujjingun,5,Sat Mar 7 11:22:20 2015 UTC,The nominative marker '가' was adopted from Japanese   Could you suggest further reading on this topic?
Korean,2y8783,nichtschleppend,2,Sat Mar 7 14:50:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm interested in this, too. What are you basing this on? I thought that the evidence for this having been due to language contact was kind of tenuous.   Not calling anyone out, just curious about the source."
Korean,2y8783,bazilman,2,Sat Mar 7 16:35:03 2015 UTC,"I'm interested in this, too. As for the 가, Japanese affecting Korean sounds not very convincing, considering the fact that there wouldn't have been that much of a chance for the two languages to be melted together. The war you mentioned only lasted for 5 years. Is 5 years enough to affect a language that much? Care to share supporting materials?"
Korean,2y8783,jyp_,5,Sat Mar 7 23:59:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry, i was mistaken. The first written usage of 가 is from 20 years before the war."
Korean,2y8783,mujjingun,2,Sun Mar 8 01:49:52 2015 UTC,"I've been googling about this topic since I read your comment. it seems like the theory about the 가 coming from Japanese isn't a widely accepted theory. Many sources say the origin of the 가 조사 is unknown, albeit it's convenient to think that way and it kind of makes sense, assuming with or without the war, Japan and Korea would've had a cultural sharing in any form."
Korean,2y8783,jyp_,1 point,Sun Mar 8 03:01:01 2015 UTC,"Fascinating! From what I've heard, during the Japanese occupation of Korea, there were harsh punishments (sometimes execution) if one was caught using Korean. As a result, the spoken language was only used in secret, usually inside the home and Japanese became the language of schooling. It seems intuitive then that, since grammar is something we learn in school and not naturally through daily life, that Japanese grammar rules would take hold and continue to be used today. This was explained to me as a potential reason for why 문어체 and 구어체 are so incredibly different.  Anyway, this is all just speculation and hearsay, but nonetheless I wanted to share to see what you all think."
Korean,2y8783,bigbirrrd,1 point,Tue Mar 10 01:59:20 2015 UTC,"I think you're referring to a different war.  There were two Japanese invasions, one was in 16c and the other was in 19c. I believe you're referring to the recent one but we are talking about the 16c one.  But yes, definitely, the recent invasion had a tremendous impact on the Korean language at that time and the residual effect still remains until now."
Korean,2y8783,jyp_,0,Tue Mar 10 03:16:15 2015 UTC,"Wow I didn't know that. Being sandwiched between Japan and China, combined with their small land mass, it seems no wonder Korea was invaded so much. Do you think this made it sort of inevitable that some ""big rich country"" would come in, set up a military base, and ""protect"" them?"
Korean,2y8783,bigbirrrd,1 point,Tue Mar 10 04:21:46 2015 UTC,"It's kind of off-topic and I don't know how you came up with that idea, but I don't think it's a ""big rich country"" ""protecting"" a relatively weaker country because it's inevitable. It's more of allies fighting together for what is right, based on our common belief that freedom must be protected -- and that, I believe, is our highest value. I personally think it'd be insulting to those who died protecting freedom in Korea if we say it that way. :p"

For fun, if you view my ""outsider learning Korean"" perspective as a constant, one could say that there would be a point not too far beyond the tail end of the current bell curve in which even young native Koreans wouldn't be able to communicate with elders. Just the other day I tried to imagine what it would be like to talk to my wife's grandma's parents. 맨붕. The importance of certain words and topics shift over time.

The way the textbook used 그리고  was to link two different clauses of a sentence together: ""저는 한국어를 공부해요. 그리고 러시아어를 공부해요"", ""I study Korean, and I study Russian"". The textbook hasn't introduced (이)랑 or 와/과 yet, but once it does I'll probably incorporate them more. The consensus seems to be that 와/과 is more formal though.  Thanks again for the help!"
Korean,2y7xg4,Wzzch,1 point,Tue Mar 10 02:15:57 2015 UTC,"In order to conjoin more than two elements in any given sentence, you would actually have to attach 하고 to all nouns but the last one.  So, in that case, it would be: Noun1하고 Noun2하고 Noun3 etc..  Just a side note: there are actually multiple ways to say ""and"" in Korean. And 하고 actually seems to be the least occurring among the others that I've seen and heard. The other ways are by affixing either (이)랑 or 와/과 in the same fashion as 하고.   I think I'd be more inclined to use the other two, to be honest. 하고 can conjoin nouns, but if you haven't learned already, ~고 actually serves as one of the clausal connectives which connect clauses together instead of nouns.   Ex: 내가 공부를 하고 영화를 보는다(봐요).  I study and watch movies."
Korean,2y7xg4,snsdfour3v3r,0,Sat Mar 7 07:10:40 2015 UTC,You can say 하고 but -랑/이랑 is more common.   Example: 빵이랑 우유를 샀어요

They also use 그리고 which comes before the last item in the list 빵, 홍차 그리고 오렌지.

Korean,2y4mmw,hatbeat,1 point,Sat Mar 7 04:33:41 2015 UTC,Thank you very much! Now I will try to find their emails )))) May I ask you how Email or contact us looks in Korean? Google Translate is not helpful.
Korean,2y4mmw,Not_Ayn_Rand,0,Thu Mar 12 15:36:00 2015 UTC,"It's just my opinion but babies and toddlers should probably be learning Korean instead of English. I know, crazy idea. But it's just much harder to be good at Korean (even for Koreans) than English. Very few people can write well in Korean, but it's not hard to be a decent writer in English."
Korean,2y4mmw,iamkoalafied,1 point,Sat Mar 7 15:34:31 2015 UTC,Even though I'm not overly fond of this question (it feels kinda rude to seek out parents to try to get them to use something to teach their kid a foreign language unless they have expressed interest in doing so) do you have any proof to back up what you said? It doesn't make sense to me that it'd somehow be easier to learn/be good at a foreign language compared to your native language.
Korean,2y4mmw,iamkoalafied,1 point,Sat Mar 7 22:55:00 2015 UTC,"I hear what you're saying but it's just about offering tools to those who wish to let their kids learn a foreign language. People read blogs to find out news, and so if they read a blog, I can imply they are seeking for information."
Korean,2y4mmw,Not_Ayn_Rand,1 point,Thu Mar 12 15:37:39 2015 UTC,"That's all fine and dandy but unless the people are actually making posts about how they want to teach their children English, then it still seems rude to me. Making and keeping a blog is not the same thing as asking for someone to send them ""advice"" on stuff they aren't even blogging about."
Korean,2y4mmw,iamkoalafied,-1,Thu Mar 12 19:35:00 2015 UTC,"That's from my experience. I've personally found it to be easier to learn English grammar and writing rules than Korean equivalents. The sheer number of Koreans who can't even spell things right (e.g. 되/돼, 안/않) should also be telling. Besides, the difference between writing and speaking is bigger in Korean than in English."
Korean,2y4mmw,Not_Ayn_Rand,1 point,Sat Mar 7 23:09:16 2015 UTC,"What's your native language, just curious? English speakers have a huge problem with spelling too. I'm a fairly decent speller but I still rely way too much on spell check, and there's still a big problem with people not knowing the difference between you're/your etc. Spoken and written English aren't too different, you're right. But words aren't spelled like how they sound, so if someone doesn't practice writing enough they are going to have a terrible time making sense when they write."
Korean,2y4mmw,iamkoalafied,1 point,Sat Mar 7 23:14:15 2015 UTC,"I'm a native Korean speaker, hence the flair. Just to be clear, what I mean by ""decent writing"" isn't even New York Times or anything. It's being free of spelling errors and generally free of grammatical errors. Most reddit comments would fit into that category.  The rules for English are usually cut and clear, like ""match the plurality your verb to the number of your subjects."" There are a lot of resources full of rules like this too. Not so much for Korean--the ""writing"" lesson kids take to get into colleges mostly focus on how to unfold arguments, not how to write good sentences.   As for the link between sound and spelling, it's definitely harder for Korean because there are many related and unrelated words that share the same spelling and vice versa. For example, the grammatical explanation behind the your/you're distinction is not complicated (yaknow... big difference in meaning). 되/돼 and 안/않 are seriously basic mistakes for native speakers to make and scream ""HEY I DON'T READ VERY MUCH"", but if you actually look into the difference, it's pretty subtle.  Also, spacing is part of the grammar in Korean. Very few literate English speakers have problem figuring out where to put spaces (other than a few notable mistakes like alot vs. a lot). In Korean, basically nobody puts all their spaces correctly unless they have advanced degrees in Korean language."
Korean,2y4mmw,Not_Ayn_Rand,1 point,Sat Mar 7 23:38:27 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I didn't even realize I had somehow disabled flairs on here so I thought you didn't have one. You can think that the rules are clear cut, but native speakers mess them up all the time. It could be a failure of our school systems or it could be a lack of caring on the person's part, I don't know. Even when I was in high school, our teacher had to tell us to not use chat speak and ""lol"" in our essays because enough people would do that sort of thing that it became a problem. Maybe a better example would be affect and effect, which is much more subtle and I know I have to actively think about which one I'm using pretty often. There's also ensure and insure, and a lot of other examples like that.  Also, I don't know how well spell checkers are in Korean or how frequently people use them, but the ones for English can be really advanced. They can even check your grammar or suggest fixes for common misused words. So even if it seems like people are writing perfectly to you, a lot of people do rely on tools to point out their mistakes for them."

Using a bought account is usually a bannable offense in games like that, I don't think they police it very strictly but it's a possibility. I didn't need a VPN or anything to connect, it might vary game to game but that's usually not a big deal."

Korean,2y1xl3,itsapraxis,2,Thu Mar 5 20:47:41 2015 UTC,"FYI I live in Korea and meet a lot of people who study/ have studied Korean. IMHO, 95% of the people I meet who start studying Korean quit before getting to basic fluency. Arguably there are hundreds of reason why this is, but I think it's mainly a result of the fact that Korean is much harder than people expect. If you bought a chocolate bar, took a bite, and it tasted like wasabi, you'd probably be pretty unhappy. Expectations are really important.   Of those I know who have reach a certain level of fluency in Korean, most of them have a very strong commitment to the language (either a close friend/ significant other who is Korean, or a general love for languages/ cultures - personally I fall into both these categories). If you are one of these people, then you will likely fair well. More still, those who learn the fastest, often tend to be people who like to talk (these people simply end up speaking more as a result and learn faster - judging by my long-winded comment you can probably tell I am one of these people as well).   So the fact that you're commenting here, I'm just speculating of course, seems to indicate that you are looking for a ""faster"" or ""better"" way. Aside from a set of decent resources and some basic advice, by far the most important factor is time. If you're committed to the language, you'll spend the time, and your language ability will blossom before your eyes. As if walking in the dark, you simply have to trust that there is light ahead of you and keep going.   I mean not to demotivate you, it's just that these are things I wish I knew when I started out. Best of luck to you. Welcome to r/Korean."

Korean,2xxs27,dlwhdgns10,2,Wed Mar 4 20:52:41 2015 UTC,"Well, I personally use a Brute-force/Integrate method when it comes to learning a language.  I initially brute-force information memorization to myself, then immediately put them in use so that I retain the information. Also, exposure is the key to complete sophisticated rehearsal for LTM integration. So SRS is always your friend.   Ofc, I'm not using this for Korean or English. It's for Japanese, but the method has been serving me well. I would try getting any kind of resources to pick up words from. Could be a novel, simple magazine, or even articles. In my case, I just happen to read a lot of Japanese websites and magazines. I also sometimes purchase a raw-untranslated book and try to read as much as I can. This allows me to actually look into dictionary and re-use the word whenever it comes back up in the book.   Following the textbook is also a good choice, since it is after all written by people who know how to teach. (If not, oh well.)  Feeling adventurous? Try out my method. Too hard core? Go back to textbook and/or figure out something that works better for you.  Hope it helped."
Korean,2xv6w4,thecrazycatman,6,Wed Mar 4 03:13:09 2015 UTC,"Looking things up using Naver or other sources isn't cheating! In fact, it's absolutely normal and appropriate to do so. It may feel like you're cheating your way through a conversation, but you shouldn't feel bad if you're looking up words you absolutely don't know.   I, too, am a fellow HelloTalk user. And I look up words all the time. But don't fret. Simple conversations that you do generally take time to get used to, especially for beginners.   Here's what I do: any word I come across that I don't know, have to look up, or even find amusing I jot down and review after the conversation's over. To me, using HelloTalk isn't simply just talking. I read what I write over and over again, making sure that sentences look good. If they look good but they aren't, I ask my partner to tell me if it sounds wrong or unnatural. If there's an expression that I think of but can't do in Korean, I write it in English on paper and try to translate it later. If it's an expression I needed to say, I try to find other ways to say it or circumvent needing to say it completely.   Forgetting is also fine. You may not have the best memory in town, but you can try to retain as much as you can in one sitting. But don't over exert yourself. Just keep practicing/talking with them and you'll get there! ^"

Google Translate's Android app can read handwriting. It's pretty neat! (And a good method for 한글 practice with a stylus) :)"

Korean,2xs2ul,lemonfighter,2,Tue Mar 3 14:05:06 2015 UTC,"The Naver ""app"" is shit because it's just a webpage and is therefore online only. It's also buggy and horribly designed. I used it for a long time before reaching the limit of frustration at it crashing all the time and requiring me to have an internet connection, and sought out a new dictionary. I was looking for something similar to the EDICT Japanese dictionaries (like Midori) for iOS too, but I also wanted Japanese<->Korean with full hanja support. The best I found was 프라임일본어. Unfortunately it isn't as extensive as Naver but it generally gets the job done."

Most of us have not studied Japanese or have not used Midori (especially if it is for iOS only) so asking for something ""like Midori"" is hard to answer when we don't know what it's like :P Hopefully the options presented here are good enough for you, though."

Korean,2xk6w3,Tamagogo,3,Sun Mar 1 14:01:45 2015 UTC,"To put it this way, it's like making bread.   Gathering Vocab is making the dough.  Studying it is kneading the dough.  Grammar study is rolling it out.  After you can produce the word/ sentence through recall, then you've put it in the oven.  In my experience, the rate at which those words come out of the oven varies greatly but is always correlated to noticing it in context. Occasionally I force it, open the oven and pull it out, but I don't always get it right and sometimes the bread is still a little doughy. However, when I hear a Korean person use it in a real life context, DING. Fresh bread."
Korean,2xk6w3,bigbirrrd,2,Mon Mar 2 12:02:55 2015 UTC,Damn. This is a pretty good analogy. Hats off to you sir.
Korean,2xk6w3,Wzzch,2,Mon Mar 2 14:46:38 2015 UTC,"The way I'm seeing it, you're putting yourself on a great track for Korean. Utilization for several books, audio help, journal entries, etc.. But, I do understand how you feel about HelloTalk and not being able to carry a conversation well enough.  That said, I think everyone memorizes and learns words in their own way. I do it oddly enough. I take vocabulary words (in huge amounts or as little as 4), stick them into a notebook, and read them out aloud in as many sentences I can think of. I'm not suggesting this as an effective method for learning, but I know others who tend to study through study sheets/vocab sheets and stuff, all in bulk like they're cramming for a test which is also fine if it helps them retain words easily.   I guess to answer your question: if you're lacking in vocabulary (including grammar points/conjugations), stick to one book or source that has a constant stream of vocabulary. I utilize several sources for vocabulary, but only because I finished taking up the basics of a series I put myself to follow (Integrated Korean series). Once you've gotten yourself a decent pile of words, then you can move onto other sources to pull more vocabulary: sites, blogs, articles, other books, etc.. However, learn moderately slowly. You need to let words sink into your head once you've taken them in. You don't need to learn at most 10; you can learn 50 if that's small enough. But I find it necessary to use any learned words in as many sentences possible so I recognize it's usage/meaning much more readily in making more complex sentences and more importantly in conversation. So, as long as you can make the same amount of sentences with those words the next day like the day you learned them, I'd say that's good enough for effective memorization.  So, several hours of study is impressive (as a college student, I wish I could use the bulk of my time to learning Korean ㅠㅠ). But your habits look good, and I think you'll be able to do fine in a matter of months. Don't worry about the small vocabulary. I'm assuming you're wicked at Japanese, so you already have enough vocabulary to worry about! Just take it slow (like I said, 50 words CAN be slow if you want :D) but thoroughly slow. You have to ingest them properly before you can regurgitate them back out.  Sorry for the long haul, I couldn't help myself ㅎㅎ. I hope this helps!"
Korean,2xk6w3,Wzzch,1 point,Sun Mar 1 15:26:14 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar boat as you. I had studied Korean on and off for about two years, studied mostly grammar, but had a small vocabulary. I then spent a few months making a vocabulary course on memrise for myself. It's roughly 5,400 words divided by category and difficulty. In addition to your other study methods, I would suggest checking it out. http://www.memrise.com/course/296418/ultimate-korean-vocabulary/"
Korean,2xj6f5,infringement153,6,Sun Mar 1 04:34:13 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Memrise doesn't really help you much in terms of learning a language. It's a nice review tool, perhaps. But learning is a two-step process: trying to understand a word and saving it into your memory bank, then applying that word in speech and parsing it from sources like articles, videos, conversations, etc. So, memorizing the word does probably a third (or even a fourth) of the actual work.  With that said, I think that your goal for September is pretty realistic. 1-2 hours a day may be enough for you to get onto the intermediate level by that time, but I recommend trying to find a language partner, Korean friend, tutor, etc. I haven't had experience with iTalki, but I've seen that their rates are pretty good. You need a good speech partner to train you in the one aspect of language that depends solely on interaction. I'd say it's not only for your pronunciation, accent, and ear for conversation but also your responsiveness and fluidity. I've had a tutor (native Speaker) when I first started learning Korean, and I've learned so much from the one-on-one interactions with him that I considered him just as indispensable as any other primary learning source. So, there's that.   And then there's places like here, TTMIK, and other language forums that will definitely assist you in your language learning journey. So good luck and work hard! 화이팅!"
Korean,2xj6f5,Wzzch,1 point,Sun Mar 1 06:58:47 2015 UTC,"I agree, Memrise isn't ideal. My theory, however, is that at some point I'll have memorized a basic definition of a critical mass of words at which I'll begin being able to read and learn about the language using it. Until then, I'm probably going to keep doing what I'm doing and get the tutor."
Korean,2xj6f5,Wzzch,1 point,Sun Mar 1 20:50:36 2015 UTC,"I actually thought the exact same thing when I started to learn Korean. I wanted to amass a compendium in my head before many things. I learned a bunch of conjugations, idiomatic expressions, and other neat stuff only to find out that I was still at the level of crafting sentences like 음식을 좋아해요! and such. Just be sure that when those words are taken in, you readily practice them.  To be honest, you seem pretty determined to learning. I think you'll do just fine once you get a speech partner of some sort. Keep doing what you do!"

Korean,2xj6f5,Wzzch,2,Sun Mar 1 22:37:43 2015 UTC,"And I thought I was the only one to had studied like that ㅋㅋㅋ.

After 7-10 hours a day for 11 months, I went to Korea and could handle myself doing what I needed or wanted to do. I sat in on a level five Korean class for foreigners at Seoul Uni, though, and would say I was better at intellectual and news topics from my studies but nowhere near as fluent at speaking or good at more abstract daily-life topics as some foreigners who live there (among the friends I made, some Japanese people who had been there a couple months and a Canadian dude who had been there a year for grad school were accurate to that comparison).  I agree with what people have said about getting a partner to use Korean. Even without the immersion, actually experiencing it is what's going to get you confident enough and adjusted enough to conversational phrases and speaking in general to reach the goal of 'comfortable conversations about everyday subjects'. It will be the active study that gets you there, not passive like memorizing vocab and looking at grammar."

Haha, at best (toward the end of my two week trip) I understood about 60% of the conversations around me.  My pronunciation and grammar were fine enough, but my vocabulary is still pretty small, so there just were a lot of words I hadn't heard before.  I definitely could get by on my own (as far as buying stuff, asking for directions), but every conversation felt like a battle at first and required a lot of patience from whomever I was speaking with.  That being said, your vocab sounds a lot more developed than mine and it sounds like you're doing well with your studies.  So don't be discouraged, I just wanted to share my experience.  To keep up my listening and speaking, I just do what you said, watch korean TV and read Korean books... I have a language partner and use the hello talk app.  Good luck!"

Korean,2xj6f5,Grafeno,2,Sun Mar 1 16:26:13 2015 UTC,"""Proficiency"", like ""fluent"" and ""knowing/speaking a language"" is always a hard-to-define term. That being said, I studied Korean for three or so years before getting to Korea, and while it was by no means perfect or easy I was able to communicate prety comfortably in every day topics. News and fast conversation still eluded me but I like to say I was conversational.  Like others have said, Memrise is not ideal for just learning a language, especially Korean which is so grammatically different from English or other European languages. I can know what every word in a Korean sentence means but sometimes I have no idea what the sentence is trying to say. The way words fit together and are used in context is a huge part of ""knowing"" a language. Not to mention the speaking and listening aspect is hard with self-study methods like Memrise or Anki, and those are often the weakest points and the most obviously lacking when you attempt spoken communication.  Once you get to university, use your new Korean-American friends as resources -- they'll be invaluable in helping you sound natural and getting comfortable with speaking."
Korean,2xj6f5,Grafeno,2,Sun Mar 1 20:29:32 2015 UTC,"By proficiency I usually mean something along the lines of ""can read basically all everyday material (except technical stuff/news), understand most conversations and express 98% of what you want to say, if not always naturally."" If you don't mind me asking, what did those 3 years consist of? University courses? And yeah, I should probably be viewing the university as more of a means than an end (I'm going to take Korean classes anyway), but I'm impatient :P  I want to hit the ground running."
Korean,2xj6f5,Grafeno,1 point,Sun Mar 1 20:57:10 2015 UTC,"Just studying with Talk To Me in Korean, listening to too much K-Pop, and going to high school with a lot of Korean-Canadians who I could practice with haha.  That's a good mindset to have though! The more conversational you can be once you get to university, the easier it will be to make friends who are willing to help you through the language. From your Korean friends' point of view, t's not always fun having to explain to your friend very basic grammar rules; it's a lot more interesting to be able to hold a conversation with a friend, and then point out different ways they could phrase it, for example. So keep at it!"
Korean,2xj6f5,ShinshinRenma,2,Sun Mar 1 21:18:18 2015 UTC,"I'll just give you my experience since all of my learning has been self-study outside of Korea   Hi, I've been learning on my own since October    That's not very long.   Has anyone reached proficiency through self-study outside of Korea?    Yes. Though what does ""proficiency"" exactly entail?   What did you do to expose yourself to the language?   I've learned through: Daily Anki + Daily chatting with Koreans online. And by daily I mean 365 days a year. And by daily chatting with Koreans online I don't mean a few sentences a day, but quite a lot with often conversing for hours and even Saturdays where I basically spent 8 hours doing nothing but chatting to people.   I've been doing this for about 1.5 years. I haven't taken a single class, tutor, etc; I've paid $0 with regards to studying Korean. Haven't used any books. Unlike some others here though who write stuff like ""I've dedicated 2 hours a day to learning Korean over X years"", I've never done anything like that; my ""learning"" has simply been chatting. When I see a new word, I look it up and add it to Anki. Same with grammar. That's it.    My main goal is to be able to have comfortable (not overly strained) conversations about everyday subjects by September,   This is very achievable. I think this took me about 6 months, so seeing how September is 11 months it should be fine.   Nowadays after 1.5 years I barely ever look up a word or grammar pattern anymore when chatting online. You only need to know like, 2000-3000 words or so to capture >99.9% of what's used in general chatting. And the thing is that when you know every word but 1 in a sentence it's usually easy to just derive from the context what it means. A lot of words being based on Hanja also helps with recognising part of the meaning of new words.  My listening is weak though due to barely having practised it so that's a big drawback. If you want to be all-round you gotta supplement it with listening (which iyagi/drama's are of course good for). Speaking is fine for me simply because I have a knack for it when learning foreign languages.  Another side-effect is that to me the way people write on this subreddit looks very formal and ""bookish"". An example would be someone here writing ""연습이지요"" which I wouldn't think of doing (I'd write 연습이죠) unless, say, I'm writing to the 국립국어원 or in a formal setting (not on a website like Reddit). Of course this isn't a bad thing considering that this is in fact a language learning subreddit!   still can't read anything but the most basic material despite Memrise saying I know 3400 words.    To me that says you've been learning the wrong words.  http://comic.naver.com/webtoon/list.nhn?titleId=61731  Do you have any issues reading this? I have none, and I'm pretty sure I don't know more than 3000 words which would mean my vocabulary is smaller than yours."

How did you do this before you understood enough? I can do text chats/send kakao texts pretty comfortably but cannot do voice chats at all because my listening is dirt. How did you deal with this when you were beginning?  And I can't read the comic at all, which is kind of disappointing. :/  I guess I am learning the wrong words, although if you've been doing this for 1.5 years you can probably passively recognize way more than 3000 words."

I can do text chats/send kakao texts pretty comfortably but cannot do voice chats at all because my listening is dirt. How did you deal with this when you were beginning?   Oh, when I said ""chatting"", I meant kakao texting.   But yeah. I started chatting while knowing only minimal of grammar/vocab. I knew maybe 300 words and grammar-wise basic conjugation - 가다 -> 가요/갔어요, 책이다 -> 책이에요, ~는데, ~지만, ~고, ~에, ~에서, ~이/가, ~을/를. That's all the grammar I knew. So yeah, that meant that at the start, it went painfully slow, every sentence I was looking up words. Naturally I only looked up grammar that I saw often because you just can't learn everything at the same time and I wanted to be sure I started with the most common stuff. I'm doing alrightish with voice chats these days, but I had the same problem for a long time. But the thing is, even just getting super fluent at texting will improve your listening simply because your brain will be so used to the patterns that naturally arise in speech that it will know what to expect. I noticed that without listening practice at all, my listening still improved because of that. All I can say is, try asking them to speak a bit slowly/clearly, watch Korean shows that have Korean subtitles, read along with song lyrics. My weakest point by far is listening as well but it has automatically improved as my writing has.   I can do text chats/send kakao texts pretty comfortably   I can't really match that with the ""And I can't read the comic at all"", unless I'm misenterpreting ""pretty comfortably"". Is it the grammar or is it the vocab in the comic?   although if you've been doing this for 1.5 years you can probably passively recognize way more than 3000 words.   I really don't think so. My Anki deck only has ~1300 words. I'm looking through Kakao conversations right now and while I must say I didn't realise that there's almost none of the very common stuff in my Anki deck (받다, 수업, 방, 열심하다 to name some examples), there's not many of those words I feel. Maybe it'd be around 3000, but not more than that.    And I can't read the comic at all, which is kind of disappointing. :/   Hmm.. for me this is hard to match with ""I can do text chats/send kakao texts pretty comfortably"". As in.. it could be that the Koreans are intentionally simplifying things or something. To me, if you can send them comfortably, you should be able to read 판다독.   Actually, scratch that. I probably would've said the same thing about ~5 months in while I wouldn't have had much of a clue reading the comic.   CARE: Noisy link, maybe mute in advance How do you do reading this convo?"

The guy on the right was searching for people to draw him a picture for his profile, but he wanted to see some prior work of the guy on the left, but the picture was too young to be useful. And then something about practicing while studying? And then they started talking about if the one on the left is pretty and her friends are pretty for some reason. Then he yelled at her for sending pictures to strangers. And then they began to discuss how many people were signing up for classes?  I knew most of the words but it was still pretty hard and there's still a bunch I don't get."
Korean,2xj6f5,BruceJi,1 point,Thu Mar 5 01:49:35 2015 UTC,"It's kinda different.   ~플래시카페 (is this a cafe somewhere?)   I don't know how much you know about Korean internet culture but considering that you're learning Korean (unless you're doing it just for business purposes or something of the likes, in which case never mind) I'd guess you'd be interested in it. Basically in Korea there's ""cafe's""/카페 that are like online clubs. So I'm almost certain that this is like an online drawing club, and the name of it is apparently ""Flashy cafe"".   So if you aren't familiar with this it's understandable that you wouldn't understand it.   프사   프로필사진 -> 프사 줄임말  Basically what the convo is:  Girl asks ""so you're the person of 플래시카페 who's looking for people who draw persons right?""   So he says yes, asks for prior work, girl shows, it's obviously not good and the guy asks how old she is, she's 12 so he rejects her. He says like ""later when you've practiced more we can draw together"", so she asks like ""can't we practice together"" and he says like ""I just [draw] do it as a hobby, it's not to the extent that I want to teach others"" and then she sends him pics, first the guys says that they're all ugly, then later on he says she's pretty (prolly so she'll stop sending him pics) and as you said he tells her off for sending pics to strangers.   The ""joke"" is at the end of the pic.   He: 공부안하면 나처럼 된다 - if you don't study you'll end up like me  She: ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 저 반에서 7등이에요 - hahahaha I'm (ranked) 7th in my class  He: There's 7 people in your class?  She: No hahahaha 25 people  He: yeah ㅎㅎ I'm gonna sleep early (actually this is the only part I'm not sure about; I'm not sure whether the guy is saying ""I'm going to sleep early"" or he's telling the girl ""you should sleep early"")  She: I go to sleep at midnight  You could try to read it with this translation next to it and see if you understand it then.   Personally I'd recommend chatting (i.e. texting) more with Koreans until you're at a point where you'd understand pretty much all of it like me. Reason is that to me, pretty much every word in that convo is pretty common and there's no complicated grammar patterns either - do note that their grammar is wrong some of the tie so don't use it as study material apart from vocab (e.g. ""안되요"" where it should be ""안돼요"") - and if you don't know the words there's no point to listening."

After that, I watch Korean dramas or Korean versions of movies I'm already familiar with.    I'm not very creative yet in Korean, though the spark is starting to show at this point now that my vocab is starting to hit a critical mass, but I do understand a lot that is thrown my way, and picking up words from the dramas here and there has also been fun.

Same goes for ""ㅡ.""  This is also the same reason why I discourage learning from Romanization; what you're doing is akin to trying to force a puzzle piece (Korean) into a whole another puzzle (English).

Korean,2xcwwy,ilaeriu,2,Mon Mar 2 03:29:59 2015 UTC,"As many have said, focus on Hangul and the sounds that match the sounds in Hangul; romanization will only confuse you the longer you try to use it.  That being said, there is a linguistic explanation for why many learners hear ""b"" when Koreans pronounce ""m"".  The following explanation is long and uses some linguistic terms, which I try very hard to explain and keep simple, and use only when necessary.  In languages, we differentiate between consonants based on many different things. Let me briefly go over two of them to illustrate my point.  Place (of articulation) is where the sound is made. ex: b, p, and m are made on your lips; t, d and n are made on your teeth, etc.  Manner (of articulation) is how the sound is made. ex. b, p, t and d are all made by blocking the flow of air from leaving your mouth. Meanwhile, m and n are made by redirecting that air through your nose. You can try this - try plugging your nose and saying ""mmmm"" or ""nnnnn"". You can't.  Okay, with me? Those two will become important in a little bit, but the most important one to understand the ㅁ/b controversy is voice.  Voice means whether they are voiced or voiceless. For example, in English (and your native German) ""b"" is voiced, whereas ""p"" is voiceless. This means that when we pronounce ""b"", our vocal cords vibrate; when we pronounce ""b"", our vocal cords do not vibrate. Try it with ""pin"" and ""bin"".   Meanwhile, Korean differentiates between ㅍ and ㅂ in a different way. Technically, both ㅍ and ㅂ are voiceless. Instead, they differentiate based on aspiration. Aspiration is basically making a little puff of air while pronouncing the consonant. I am not sure about the use of aspiration in German (wiki is telling me that your ""p"" is aspirated, although in some southern dialects the p is not aspirated and you're from Vienna) but I'm going to use English examples.  Compare ""spin"" and ""pin"". The p in spin is unaspirated, but the p in pin is aspirated. You can test this by holding a scrap of paper above your lips and pronouncing the two words. When you say spin, the paper shouldn't move, but when you say pin, you'll notice the paper flutter.   Now, lets bring this to b and ㅁ. b and ㅁ are pronounced in the same place, on the lips. And, they are also both voiced. Say ""mmmmm"" and put your fingers on your vocal cords -- they will vibrate. Thus, b can be acceptable substitute (an allophone) of ㅁ in Korean.    Characteristic ㅁ b1 ㅂ    Place lips lips lips   Manner nasal stop stop   Voice yes yes no   Aspiration no no no    This table shows the similarities between the three sounds: and look, ""b"" shares three qualities with both ㅁ and ㅂ. Thus, linguistically, it is roughly equally2 similar to both ㅁ and ㅂ.  TLDR: ㅁ is really similar to ""b"". Because Korean doesn't have the sound ""b"", sometimes they will use it to as a substitute for ㅁ, because it sounds similar enough linguistically to be a decent subsititute.  Pedantic linguistic footnotes:  1 Here and in general throughout, I'm using ""b"" as in /b/ of IPA, the voiced bilabial stop. Similarly, I refer to ""m"" as /m/ the labial nasal -- linguistically, <m> of English/German and <ㅁ> of Korean are identical to this /m/.  2 Yes, I know, not equally, some things used to distinguish phonemes from one another carry stronger weight, but generally you get what I mean."

Koreans don't typically agree with this. But don't worry about it, it's not exactly an ㅁ or a ㅂ, it's somewhere in between, so just pronounce it like you think it should.  The reason has to do with why I feel like it's natural to say an ㅁ and a ㅂ. The ㅁ is voiced, but it's not supposed to be in the start of a word so it ends up sounding like ㅂ.  As for the ㅡ vowel - it doesn't really change into an ㅔ sound. I would never say it's supposed to be like the ü though, but I don't know the german alphabet good enough to suggest a better letter.

Korean,2xcwwy,iamkoalafied,6,Fri Feb 27 15:59:48 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is with saying ""ㅁ sounds like ㅂ"" because that's not what is happening. ㅁ can sound like it has a little bit of a ""b"" sound at the start of a word depending on the speaker and the listener and such, but it still sounds distinctly different from ㅂ at the beginning of a word. That's likely why Koreans don't seem to notice it, because there isn't any way they would confuse that sound for ㅂ, and why people who are just learning Korean notice it a lot more, because what they consider to be ㅂ is still largely based on their native language.

This came up in a frontpage thread yesterday I think; a comparison can be made with Spanish/Portuguese speakers who don't know English not distinguishing the words ""beach"" and ""bitch"", because in Spanish they don't distinguish those different vowels, just like how in Korean they don't distinguish the ""ㄷ-sounding ㄴ"" and "" ㄴ-sounding ㄴ"" and ""ㅂ-sounding ㅁ"" and ""ㅁ-sounding ㅁ""."

The ""i"" in ""bitch"" sounds ""ea-ish"", but not ""ea-ish"" enough to actually be an ""ea"". But a Spanish speaker might think that it sounds ""ea-ish enough"" to be an ""ea"", because their threshold is too low. That's what I was saying.  Of course the ""ㅂ-ish ㅁ"" is still ""the ㅁ sound"" considering it's Koreans pronouncing a word with the ㅁ 자모 like that. That's literally the definition of ""the sound of ㅁ""."

Korean,2xcwwy,Rial91,1 point,Fri Feb 27 20:13:48 2015 UTC,"Don't worry,  I can hear what you're hearing. I think it's the way the speaker's lips part at the end of 무 that kinda gives of a sense of a B being there. Now it is not supposed to have any b sound, and you shouldn't build any expectations from this example for future  ㅁ's.   To get deeper into why you may hear a b sound,  when pronouncing ㅁ you use the same lip structure as a b except that you don't build up any pressure like you would a b. The pressure behind the lips is what makes bad and mad sound different.  Try it yourself and you can see how you can get an almost b sound by adding too much pressure behind the word."

I was amazed when I asked a friend who said that she's saying 막상. I don't understand how someone could not acknowledge that that sounds like a mid-word ㅂ (so, 전부 but not 부산)."
Korean,2xcwwy,Pikmeir,1 point,Sat Feb 28 18:28:00 2015 UTC,"First of all I never said that it's ""supposed"" to sound like anything - so there's nothing for you to disagree with. Also: How is it incorrect[to pronounce it that way]? Linguistically whatever reflects how people actually speak is the most correct, the fact that some people (including most Koreans) believe that they pronounce it exactly the way it is written doesn't make it more ""correct"".  It's not slang, it's simply a natural way to pronounce a sound when a word, or more so a sentence, starts with those two consonants. Typically if someone responds 네 repeatedly in a conversation to show interest or agreement the sound will get more nasal and ㄷ like.  Everything a language learner does is try to copy whatever patterns one is able to find in the language. Nothing is ""correct"" - it's either used or not used. If this were to be an even more common phenomenon I would consider putting time into learning it, but since it's not really that important I recommend ignoring it. That doesn't mean you have to pretend that it doesn't exist."
Korean,2xcwwy,Pikmeir,1 point,Fri Feb 27 18:06:06 2015 UTC,"it doesn't really change into an ㅔ sound.   If OP is German, he might interpret it that way, since the letter e in German represents both the ㅔ (in stressed syllables) and  ㅡ  (in unstressed syllables) sounds.   I would never say it's supposed to be like the ü though,   There are definitely instances in which ㅡ has a distinct ü-ish sound to it, but they are, in my experience, too rare to be anything but an exception. Maybe it's part of a dialect."

Korean,2xb1pe,graup,4,Fri Feb 27 07:22:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this post!  Still, 신기하다 feels closer to ""amazing"" than ""interesting"" to me.  How can I say something like ""The movie yesterday was really interesting?"" 어제 본 영화가 진짜 신기했어/재미있었어 both don't seem to capture the meaning of ""interesting"" that I intent. With ""interesting"" in this sentence I don't mean ""fun"" or ""entertaining"" or ""amazing"", but rather something like ""brain stimulating"". Something that arouses interest is making me think about it, that's all. Is there really no (commonly used) way in Korean to say this?  Edit: to put it another way, in English negative things can still be ""interesting"", e.g. ""even if I don't like it, it's interesting to think about""."
Korean,2xb1pe,Trevarr,2,Fri Feb 27 07:39:26 2015 UTC,"Hm..I would say ""어제 본 영화(가) 진짜 특이했어/독특했어."" and then explain why I think like that.

Korean,2xb6vt,Not_Ayn_Rand,3,Sat Feb 28 02:51:23 2015 UTC,"Welcome!  This is a bit of a tricky one. In linguistics, you would be classified as a ""False Beginner"".  This is because you aren't quite at the intermediate level yet. I'm assuming. Essentially, false beginners are people like you, who have a background in another language but haven't had the need to use it due to living in an environment that is filled with another language causing the other language to pretty much go away.  For example: I used to be fluent in Vietnamese as a child. Going to school and living in an English speaking country caused my Vietnamese to become a basic level of speaking but a very high level of listening and understanding.  Good news. As you are a false beginner,  it gives you a head start as you start learning Korean, you will probably have a time where your Korean skills will advance quickly as your brain regains access to the section that once used Korean.  If I am off please correct me as it has been years since I studied linguistics.  As for making friends, I feel it is a culture difference. In a more western country, you can pretty much talk to the guy sitting next to you on the bus and become friends. If you are entering a university, I suggest joining a 동아리! Like a school club for soccer, dance, games, music and more. If you have some friends in Korea already, try meeting them and some of their Korean friends. If you wanna talk to guys, usually soccer and LoL works. Girls: dramas, fashion trendspr something like that.  You don't need to know the difference between ㅐ and ㅔ. Most Koreans don't even know ^  Feel free to pm if you have more questions"
Korean,2xb6vt,tttdph91,3,Fri Feb 27 07:00:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with the advice here. You would be classified as a false beginner. You will learn much faster than people like me with the same amount of effort. But you will have to pay conscious attention to your accent. When you're ready, try recording yourself saying a difficult word, then a perfect native speaking it (I'm assuming you will have access to one.. 엄마 부탁할게!!!)   As for the cultural things, you might experience some judgements and things. But as a foreigner in Korean, I do too. It's not good or bad, just part of the experience. You will be okay. Follow your heart my friend. 열심히 살고 행복하게 살기 바래~"

Korean,2xaqzt,kkaebsongs,6,Fri Feb 27 00:51:53 2015 UTC,"~ㄹ게(요) and ~ㄹ거다(거예요/거야) both translate to ""will"" in English. I will do my homework. I will call you later.  ~ㄹ 거다 is the way most people encounter the future tense in Korean. It means that the action/state involved will ""probably"" happen in the future.  Example: 이번 주말에 야구경기에 내 친구랑 같이 갈 거다. I will go with my friend to the baseball game this weekend.   This statement is just a standard ""I will"". It's still possible that plans change in the future and I am unable to go to the game, which makes going to the game a probable event. But the likelihood is high enough.  The subject also doesn't have to be you (first person).  우리 아버지는 어머니가 퇴근한 후에 어머니랑 저녁을 먹으러 음식점에 갈 거다. My dad is going to a restaurant to eat dinner with my mom after she leaves work.   It also can be interrogative, not just a plain statement.  숙제를 할 거야? Are you going to do your homework?  However, ~ㄹ게(요) doesn't have much emphasis in terms of time. In fact, there are two big differences. First, it's a declarative, first-person statement. You cannot use it in a question, nor can you use it with a subject other than yourself. Second, the meaning doesn't focus on time as ~ㄹ 거다 does. It relates more to promise, intent, voluntary will, volition, or something that involves your will to do something [for someone].  아버지: 나중에 네(니) 방을 청소해. 너무 더러워니까.  나: 네. 내 방을 청소할게요.  This statement isn't really trying to convey a time in the future (even though it will occur in the future), so much as a promise to do it later.   친구: 아이고. 생물학 숙제가 너무 어렵네. Man, biology homework is really hard.  나: 걱정 하지마. 내가 [너에게] 숙제를 도와 줄게. Don't worry. I'll help you with it :D  This also has no emphasis on time. It is more so on the intent to help a friend.  I've also read on TalkToMeInKorean another point on ~ㄹ 게(요) that involves doing as a reaction to someone. So, here's more on that   I hope this helps!"

I personally suggest Korean Made Simple. Great self-study resource for beginners: http://www.gobillykorean.com/p/learn-korean-with-korean-made-simple.html  Good luck!  Edit: Forgot to add: If what you're looking for is just learning individual words/vocabulary (which is a bit strange, but to each their own) you can start with a user-friendly study tool like Memrise (http://www.memrise.com). After signing up, you can pick one of the many Korean courses (the one that corresponds with the book above is found here (http://www.memrise.com/course/283033/korean-made-simple-go-billy-korean/) and includes a total of 1000 words.)"

Korean,2x0phd,BangPang,15,Tue Feb 24 19:07:49 2015 UTC,"For listening practice, find the Yonsei books 'Korean Listening in a Month' (vols 1 and 2) and work through them slowly. To further improve listening, try transcribing the dialgoues there, the TTMIK iyagis, and so on. Language exchanges can be hard. You need to find a quiet place and a really suitable partner. When it comes to language partners; the following is very important - the worse they are at English, the better. Language exchanges with people who are very good at English are very rarely productive. Someone who is also struggling to understand English will be much more understanding of your needs than someone merely needing advanced conversation practice. The beginner at English will also want somewhere quiet to practice, won't lapse into English, will understand the need to speak slowly, and so on. So choose your language partner accordingly. Bear in mind that most people are not good language exchange partners, and expect to have to 'fire' a lot of people before finding someone suitable. You should feel no guilt about this; you need to take care of your own interests first. Don't confuse a language exchange with a social sort of friendship, or you'll likely start to compromise where you shouldn't. Think of it as a business-like bartering transaction where you are each exchanging goods that the other desires. (Side note: I have actually found online skype language exchanges to be more productive and time efficient than in-person language exchanges. That will also help with the noise problem. The drawback, however, is that unless you both have excellent internet connections and good mike-headsets, it won't work.) You might even consider finding a cheap Korean tutor on a site like italki for quiet, online, controlled Korean conversation practice. Some things are worth spending a bit of money on. It is perhaps less expensive than you think. Above all, expect progress to be slow. It takes a long time to adjust your ear to Korean. Don't be too hard on yourself. You are much closer to the beginning of your journey than the end. Accept this, and enjoy the ride. Don't compare yourself to others - people will be very keen to show you their success, hiding all the work that went into it. This can be misleading and can create unrealistic expectations. Focus on yourself and yourself only, and enjoy the experience."

Korean,2x1ulk,Wzzch,1 point,Wed Feb 25 00:32:53 2015 UTC,"The way I learned 침체, it's sort of similar to a weird or burden. I get the feeling of being stuck to the floor, almost unable to move, because of some heavy thing on my bad. Would you say this is accurate?   If so, then this might be different from ""recession."" To ""recess"" is to go back or to retract from the norm. And this seems like a different nuance to me. I'm fully aware this happens all the time with these kind of translations. Just wondering what others think."
Korean,2x1ulk,bigbirrrd,1 point,Fri Feb 27 15:06:36 2015 UTC,"(From Naver) 침체 - 어떤 현상이나 사물이 진전하지 못하고 제자리에 머무름.  If I translate that correctly, 침체 does not mean to go back or retract but to halt or impede progress (and stay still from there). So you're very correct about 침체's definition.  Now that you've mentioned it, I'm extremely curious as to why that is. Maybe because the view of a recession as a halt to progress is more important than the actual movement (of retracting/receding) itself. Although, I could be wrong. That's my take on it.  Thanks for pointing that out!"
Korean,2x1ulk,Wzzch,2,Fri Feb 27 16:30:06 2015 UTC,"Interesting point! Perhaps it is a collective effort to put a positive spin on the situation. Perhaps ""slump"" would be a better translation here.

Korean,2wy0im,mujjingun,3,Tue Feb 24 03:37:30 2015 UTC,I'd say both are correct. Personally I've seen 아카이브 used many times and I think it's the more used word. 기록보관소 to me sound a bit quaint and I think it's because it's used in rpg games a lot.
Korean,2wy0im,yeonpill,2,Tue Feb 24 03:55:45 2015 UTC,"Both is correct. 아카이브 is written as we hear the sound of ""Archive"".  However, I'd personally say neither 아카이브 nor 기록보관소 though and old people might find it hard to guess the meaning of 아카이브 because it's not a Korean word. Instead, I prefer saying a specific word such as blogs, Tumblr, files, a diary, etc. (usually in case of the Internet-based) I'd say 기록보관소 in case you talk about a storage facility accumulating official documents or tangible documents like old history books. Hope it helps."
Korean,2wy0im,brightsmile92,1 point,Tue Feb 24 03:26:20 2015 UTC,"very helpful, thanks! I definitely mean a physical storage facility.  If you don't mind, how would I say ""Our Archives"" ? It's the title of a book."

Well, I think I think they are interchangeable. If you want to translate the title liberally, you can say 우리의 나날들, 우리의 기억들, etc. It means our days, our memories, etc. I'm not sure if you meant these kind of words."
