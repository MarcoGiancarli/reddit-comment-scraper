The Superlight 2 he's carrying came out in 81, but I think this might be a few years after that judging by the Nike Sharks in the one photo.    Yes, I'm an old school gear dork."

lacrosse,3e4b5q,RunninOnStalin,4,Wed Jul 22 02:08:33 2015 UTC,Can confirm. Over the past ten years the size of the baseball team at my high school went from 35 to 20 while the lacrosse team went from nonexistent to 54
lacrosse,3e4b5q,EastSaintBoogieMan,3,Wed Jul 22 01:43:14 2015 UTC,"It could be.   I don't think it will be any time soon, though. It's been the fastest growing sport for years now, which is a good sign.   Unfortunately, baseball is still huge. Doesn't mean there isn't room for lacrosse also.  I think in order for it to ever become a ""real professional sport"" it would need strong financial backing, which it probably doesn't have at the moment. That being said, i'm personally shocked at how big the MLS has become over the years - it gives me hope that maybe the MLL will get to there at some point during my lifetime."
lacrosse,3e4b5q,OdistCo,2,Wed Jul 22 01:49:40 2015 UTC,"125 Boys Varsity teams played in Ohio in 2015.  OHSAA will sanction the sport in 2016 and play will begin in 2017.  The state sidestepped the 150 minimum team requirement to accept the sport as ""emerging"".  Many small colleges in the Great Lakes region has supported the sport and started programs.  The biggest obstacle to growth is qualified officiating for both.  It's a big time commitment and the money isn't great.  It's a difficult sport to officiate because of the size of the field and the amount of players.  The rules are complicated as well.  It doesn't help that colleges are playing outside mid-February in Ohio, where temperatures are in the teens.  If you are interested in the sport growing, we need people like you to officiate."

He blamed it on not enough fan and media support yet did nothing to help get the boys out there. Northlands Entertainment offered him a one year contract while they waited for the new arena, Urban never got in contact or refused.  The contract would have been set to expire when the new arena was built, leaving the boys with plenty of room to play. Instead they choose to leave Edmonton for a smaller location and even smaller fan base. Using almost all of the same product, name and logos for the new team.  The fact that he would cast a shadow over the valuable season ticket holders is disgusting. He cared more about himself then his fans and in the end his greed took over.  I only hope that Sass. can see through the lies."

Another thing I would do if the guy I was guarding refused to talk would be to stand about 6 inches directly behind him any time the ball was at the other end.

The next year we played them again and my brother got matched on the same guy again. Lil bro went 2 and 3 and absolutely broke the kid's ankles a couple of times. Be prepared to make some enemies.   As a goalie, I was constantly trying to get into my opponent's heads. The best way for a goalie to do this is to make a save when someone shoots as hard as they can or when they think they for sure have a goal. The shooter will begin to question themselves and you've already won. I've never been one for chirping but rather getting back at kids who would chirp me with good, solid, fundamental, physical ass whooping on the field.

lacrosse,3dnaaw,ShadowNightLion,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:01:56 2015 UTC,Good move by your captains. A few years ago we had a bad egg on my team and myself and the other captain told our coach that the team didn't want him after he walked out of a players only meeting. Our coach didn't listen and he sucked one person in to his selfish play and shitty attitude at a time until there were like 5-7 people that cared. Needless to say we went 3-10 that year

I feel like I have some relevance in this area. First thing you gotta do is command respect. Your first couple practices you need to take control, be barking out orders from the cage, and take more of a leadership role than you have in years past. This means talking with your other captains and your coach on how the team is doing pretty frequently. (I did it on almost a daily basis) We held captains practices on the weekends for fall ball that were mandatory but pretty easy going. This involved extra drills, light conditioning, mainly a practice that was laid back enough for the guys to have fun but still get in some work, plus when you lead it, it helps lead your leadership role on the team. Also after conditioning at the end of every other practice or so we would have a little huddle just players, no coaches, I would reinforce what coach had said, consult with the other captains and give our own opinions and instructions, and talk to the guys on an even base so that they hear a friend but also leader talk to them instead of a coach every time. Team dinners before games are a good idea to lead as a captain, have a few at your house and get your guys comfortable with you. Anyway it's all about respect and being a good leader, not to harsh, never too soft. Hope it helps!"

lacrosse,3dkjif,garrett_ada,5,Fri Jul 17 00:38:16 2015 UTC,"Not too late.  Start now.  Remember, stick skills are important.  Strength is important.  You will get stronger as you get older, but you can have amazing stick skills now.  Having great stick skills as a young player will get you recognized more.    With that said, practice on the wall.  Right hand, left hand, over and under, opposite-sided, one-handed - all the ways you could possibly have to throw your ball and catch the ball.    You need to be fast on your feet.  Agility drills will be something you love.  Use ladders and time yourself.    If you cannot run long distances, you need to start practicing.  Agility is great, but there's no point in dodging a defense-man only to have you out of breath when you're crossing the mid field line.  Practice your dodges and your throwing technique.  TECHNIQUE.  Do everything slowly and properly to start... you will get faster as time comes and you constantly do it.  Soon it will be second nature to throw, catch and dodge and that will allow you to focus your attention on the opponent and your team.  Now you are prepared physically, have the skills required... but you're not done.  You need to have a proper mindset.  You need to have a sense of what to do on the field.  Watch games!  Watch a lot of games, and take very close notice of what the players do.  Notice their positioning against other players, the way they read the field, the ball movement, how defense slides.  Coaches will teach you this but it's up to you to perfect the ideas.  Sorry, I don't know of any clubs in Arizona.  Good luck!"

lacrosse,3diuaw,SgtChancey,5,Thu Jul 16 16:55:22 2015 UTC,"im guessing its the pocket/stringing of the head that is the issue.  a properly strung head will throw the ball on its own.  for example, with my stick, i could balance it on the back of my hand, creating a fulcrum, then i could just press down on the end of the handle (the force of the lever) and the ball will come out perfectly with a complete follow-through (as the stick falls to the ground).  the stick will, of course, end up on the ground in this scenario (it was on the back of my hand) but the ball will release perfectly... because my stick is near-perfect!  one of the best ways to learn (or that ive found to teach this) is to play one-handed.  it almost forces proper-top-hand-fundamentals when throwing.  (it is very hard to throw side-arm and to not follow-though when one-handed)  now, when a player gets more advanced, they will have control over their release and will string a stick to thier liking... usually it ""throws down"" or has what we call ""whip.""  but for a NEW player, you want the stick to be strung like IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE.  if you were given this stick by an experienced player, it might be strung to their preference."
lacrosse,3diuaw,SapienChavez,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:11:13 2015 UTC,"I bought the stick pre-strung from lax.com, the pocket might be a little bit deep, causing a late launch. But I don't know, I might just need to get used to it and go play tree ball and catch with a friend. I don't have a problem not following through, it's just that it causes the ball to go low :/"
lacrosse,3diuaw,beers_gears_sneers,3,Thu Jul 16 19:25:59 2015 UTC,"as you prepare to throw, adjust the distance between your core and the stick. For example, you're standing sideways to your target, ready to throw. As you reach behind you and begin to take a step forward, make sure your arms are pushed out in front of your face rather than behind your ear. I also tell small kids to pretend there is a bar height countertop under your arms. Also, keep your dominant arm's elbow off your rib cage, like a chicken wing. The tighter your arms are to your core the more the whip in your stick will take effect.  Also, make sure your pocket isn't too deep our has too much whip. Many beginners think deeper pockets are better but don't realize it will only worsen their game"
lacrosse,3diuaw,desnudopenguino,2,Thu Jul 16 17:06:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/beers_gears_sneers. Also the power comes from your feet up through your body and out of your hands, so make sure you are stepping and pushing with your legs like when you throw any other typo of ball (baseball, football, basketball). A good way to start learning to throw is to put your dominant hand on the throwing position, take your other hand off the bottom of the stick and throw one-handed. This will help you develop better mechanics.  If your pocket is too deep, or has too much whip, it can cause some problems while throwing as well. Make sure your shooters have a nice ""step"" feel with the lowest one being the loosest, and the top one being the tightest. This should help move the ball out of your pocket as well.   Find a brick/block wall and throw and catch off of it for 10-20 mins every day. That will help you get used to it as well."
lacrosse,3diuaw,Estandy,2,Thu Jul 16 17:27:55 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I bet you're throwing by just extending your top hand with your tricep. This is how a ton of new guys throw, because it's a simple motion. The thing about it though is that you can't get any kind of power behind your throws unless you use your wrists. The throwing motion uses 80% wrist and 20% arm (estimation)."
lacrosse,3diuaw,Estandy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:04:21 2015 UTC,"I've been using more of my forearm/wrist, but I may still be doing it the wrong way. When you throw what muscles are activated mainly?"
lacrosse,3diuaw,bamflax8,2,Thu Jul 16 21:44:54 2015 UTC,"On the top hand it's almost entirely forearms. Most of the movement is completed by pulling the bottom hand downward though, not sure what muscle does that. But it can't be overstated how helpful wall ball, in any form, is. Every new player goes through this same awkward phase and with practice the motion will become second nature."

lacrosse,3diuaw,JeffoMcSpeffo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:58:30 2015 UTC,You want the head of your stick to point towards the target when you release the ball. Find a wall and get to work!  I played D1 for 4 years and wall ball is by far the best thing you can do to improve your skills if you don't have anyone else to toss around with.
lacrosse,3diuaw,JeffoMcSpeffo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:16:58 2015 UTC,You might be playing with a stick with lots of whip. I like to have as little as possible on mine and if I play on a stick with lots I have a similar problem you can restring your  stick or try to adjust how you throw.

lacrosse,3dfst8,IBiteMyThumbAtYou,0,Wed Jul 15 22:50:47 2015 UTC,Restring the bottom shooter if you're a high school player. U and V stings are no longer allowed. They think that making it easier to check a ball out of a pocket will reduce hard hits and injuries.
lacrosse,3dfst8,flowgod,3,Thu Jul 16 00:15:54 2015 UTC,It won't. If you're good at stringing you can get good hold without a U. Imo the rule is pointless.
lacrosse,3dfst8,flowgod,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:22:44 2015 UTC,"I'm going to nitpick because I use to string professionally (I worked at an equipment shop and it was part of my job). Your shooters should go around the plastic, not just the mesh. This will help keep you're passing consistent as the pocket breaks in. You also have a little too much slack in your sidewall. You really gotta pull those tight. The mesh should touch the plastic; the gap by your top shooter shouldn't exist. But those things aside it's a decent looking job, and pretty good for an early attempt, better than my first pockets were at least. Keep practicing and you'll find yourself appointed as your teams stick doctor."
lacrosse,3dfst8,Kingkern,2,Thu Jul 16 04:21:34 2015 UTC,"Shooters needing to go around plastic is a myth.  As long as the sidewall strings are pulled tight, the shooters will stay consistent."

lacrosse,3dgnud,jayhawk1141,4,Thu Jul 16 03:07:13 2015 UTC,As a current coach- learn to find space and move without the ball.  When you have the ball be decisive in your decision making/don't hold on to it too long

lacrosse,3dgnud,Runeon12,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:14:38 2015 UTC,"I can't stress enough the importance of being conditioned. Any one can rip sidearm man up but what separates the stars from the joe schmos is being quick and agile, especially at the attack position. Heres what i love to do for conditioning: I sprint full field length, then jog back, then repeat this for a total of 10 reps. I'd push for 2 sets of this, but 1 set can suffice. Make sure u do this every day. I also like to practice dodging. Just basically sprint and face dodge both directions, and definitely practice the roll dodge off the sprint as well. Hit the weights every other day if you do feel so obliged, but at the jv level, as long as you're quick, strength shouldn't be an issue. And of course, keep up the wall ball for at least an hour every day.  Hope this helps, FK"

So while you're arriving late to the party, LB3 can make it happen IF you are willing to put in the travel. Summer is half over, but it's worth a try I suppose.  Can't speak for the others one way or the other."
lacrosse,3czlyc,NewYorkerinGeorgia,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:55:41 2015 UTC,"While LB3 will get you looks, I wouldn't recommend it. Why? because their main objective from my perspective is money. The Lb3 organization has been notorious for charging a substantial amount of money for a spot on their team, a spot that might not even get you looks, if you don't start/play often. What I would do, like Someone said earlier, is play on a small travel team, one that is run by people you can see face to face, not by an office. Then if you are as good as you say you are (rather arrogant) you will be able to put together a quality highlight reel to send to whatever coaches you would like to impress. That my experience with Lb3, having countless friends play for them throughout the years, none of them have came away with a nice feeling in their stomach."

You get to play in front of the coaches; talk to the coaches; play at the school; and depending on the camp, stay in the dorms and eat in the caf. A campus visit, experience, and showcase in one. If you show out, you can expect lots of attention. This is coming from a committed high school senior in a non-traditional lax area with experience in the money grabbing club programs."

Bear in mind that no matter the circumstance, your defender is likely to be in a slight crouch to lower his center of gravity and improve lateral motion and stability, which only makes it easier to see the field when you're looking to feed inside.  Height advantages tend to also come with reach advantages.  Your stick can be further from your body (and your defender) when you're driving."

However, I committed last winter to a D2 school contending for a ring without my club program being a part of it by going to college prospect camps on my own. I recommend you go to the prospect camps of realistic schools you're interested in because you can play in front of the coaches, talk in person to the coaches, and stay at and/or tour the school. Recruiting websites can hurt the wallet, but definitely promote yourself by at least making seasonal highlight videos. e.g. spring season, summer ball tourneys, fall ball tourneys. If you can have a parent record your games on an iPad while you're on the field it will serve as a great learning tool and method to save and compile highlights to put on youtube. Much cheaper than buying it from the tournament itself.   Playing for a club cant hurt. If not a way to get looks it will at least offer some competitive offseason play and another platform to promote yourself on."

Unless you have really good footwork you will not be able to recover from checks quick enough and some kids will burn you for it.  Compared to a lighter metal pole that will let you throw faster checks and give you moe time to recover.  But I don't know, that is just my bro science on wood vs metal poles."

lacrosse,3cptpv,Samfd4,3,Thu Jul 9 20:33:07 2015 UTC,"So a ""bull dodge"" is not strictly illegal.  There are two ways that a poorly executed one can be deemed illegal, and one is not so fun.  ** Warding:**   Rule 6.1.1   A player in possession of the ball shall not use his free hand or arm or any other part of his body to hold, push or control the direction of the movement of the crosse or body of the player applying the check. A player in possession of the ball may protect his crosse with his hand, arm or other part of his body when his opponent makes a play to check his crosse.   Essentially, you can't push the defender away.  If the official deems that you used your arm or shoulder to push the defender away, you could get knocked with a warding call and you'll loose possession.  No big deal, and this is the most common call that is made with over-eager bull dodges.  Unnecessary Roughness  Rule 5.9.3   Any avoidable act on the part of a player that is deliberate and ­excessively violent, whether it be with the body or crosse. This may include a legal body check.   If the official deems that your dodge was excessive and violent, you may be whacked with this, which is a time-serving personal foul.  If they decide you initiated contact with or at the head or shoulders, you could be looking at 2-3 minutes, unreleasable.  This is a rare call.  I've only made this in youth games."

lacrosse,3cptpv,NewYorkerinGeorgia,2,Fri Jul 10 20:20:45 2015 UTC,"good question!  im going to research!  couple things come to mind without looking...  a true Bull Dodge, as i understand it, should not involve a body/shoulder check.  it should just be forceful, like a regular drive to the cage.  the main thing, the stick stays in front (dangerous if not strong or skilled).  As i was taught, and used MANY times as a goalie, your stick is almost the vanguard or tip-of-your-spear, so to speak.  its a strong cradle that keeps the ball in and almost blasts the opposing stick out of their hands if they try to stick-check it.  it is essentially a face-dodge with a ton of force.  as for the ruling in your scenario, it might be ""a push with possession"" and would result in a loss of possession.  however, you are body checking within 5ft of the ball... and that all good.  depends on the ref.  i think only women's lax has rules for charging.  im not up on those rules though.  edit: so, i did some research.  either the definition of this dodge has changed or the nature of the sport.  when did this become running a guy over?  isnt this a finesse game?  i must be too far out of the loop on this stuff now!  every youtube video i saw was some bullshit, in my opinion.  i havent even reread the rulebook yet.  sheesh!  good luck!"
lacrosse,3cptpv,SapienChavez,2,Thu Jul 9 20:36:34 2015 UTC,The only things I'm looking for are what are you leading with and what is your intent.  I've had kids lead with the helmet looking to spear the defender.  Very dangerous and we've called the offensive player for unnecessary roughness and given them a 2 min non-releasable.   The other thing we look at is intent.  If you're making a play to the goal and there is contact I'm not usually concerned.  The big offensive lineman looking long stick that picks up a ground ball and is now head hunting trying to run through smaller players gets a lot less of the benefit of the doubt.
lacrosse,3cptpv,Reg_Hartner,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:27:31 2015 UTC,If you keep your arm in tight or even on your stick and don't lead with your helmet it is legal
lacrosse,3cptpv,Flowsociety8,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:56:28 2015 UTC,"Yes. Just don't lead with your head (spearing). High school level and above you should be fine, but sometimes it gets called as Unnecessary Roughness at junior levels with limited contact."
lacrosse,3cptpv,LovesTheLadies,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:53:50 2015 UTC,"I would bull dodge in college. Two hands on stick and just power up the best I could. I never got called for it and I plowed through some players.  Best I ever did was two on one play when I brought it up from defense. One guy at midfield, he yard saled, and the other between mid and box. I got greedy and tried to bring it all the way in...didn't work. I was then pulled off field, grabbed by mask, and told that was stupid. Assistant coach didn't think my ""stating my dominance"" excuse was a valid excuse."
lacrosse,3cptpv,Eagle_Arm,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:19:12 2015 UTC,TL/DR  Bull Dodge is legal.  Spearing is not.
lacrosse,3cptpv,BaconBob,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:14:07 2015 UTC,"As long as you don't lead with your head and don't ward, you should be fine. The best way I've found to use pure strength has been to do a spin dodge and crash into the defender, that way you can protect your stick better."
lacrosse,3cptpv,abcdefghij1234543,0,Wed Jul 15 06:13:43 2015 UTC,"I think once you lower your shoulder it gets called as a ward, not sure though"
lacrosse,3cptpv,RedditINator70,0,Thu Jul 9 20:33:10 2015 UTC,The way i've come to understand it is: as long as both you'r hands remain on the stick then you really shouldn't be called for warding. I've done it loads of times vs skinny/small defenders. I just keep both hands on my stick and run through them.
lacrosse,3cotxw,Lax__,6,Thu Jul 9 16:03:41 2015 UTC,"First off pick a school not a program. Find a campus, a town, and academic program you are actually interested in because if you don't and only base your college choice off of a lacrosse program you may find yourself very unhappy. I hope you find the right fit whether it is D1, MCLA, or somewhere in between."
lacrosse,3cotxw,Sconnieworker,5,Thu Jul 9 18:06:11 2015 UTC,"This is by far the best advice I've read on this subreddit. I wish somebody would have told me this (somebody probably did, and my dumb ass ignored it lol) when I was looking at schools.   I was getting looks for low-end D1 schools (Hartford, Mount Saint Mary's, Etc) and top 20 D-3 schools. To cut a long story short, I fucked off in high school too much and couldn't pass the NCAA clearing house, so all D1 and D2 schools weren't an option for me.  I ended up committing to a top 20 D3 school that I honestly had no interest in other than for it's lacrosse program. Pressure from coaches, parents, teammates, etc. led me to choose this school over some ""lesser"" programs.  I got to said school and the team was full of ass holes, I didn't care for either of the assistant coaches, and could have cared less about my major. On top of this, the college was about half the size of my high school. I hated almost everything about this place except for the few close friends i made while I was there. Fast forward a couple of months and I found myself withdrawing from all my classes and heading back to live with mom and dad.   The story has somewhat of a happy ending, though, as the next year I went to a college I actually liked and had cool team mates. I didn't care for the coach, but that's another story best left for another day!  Listen to /u/sconnieworker 's advice."
lacrosse,3cotxw,EastSaintBoogieMan,2,Fri Jul 10 04:11:22 2015 UTC,"This is great advice. Really, really great advice."
lacrosse,3cotxw,NewYorkerinGeorgia,6,Fri Jul 10 12:29:15 2015 UTC,"At this point, D1 classes are pretty much full. Seeing as we're pretty much near the end of the summer season, I'm assuming you don't play club. If your heart is set on D1, contact coaches about walking on, but even that is unlikely. Look for D3 schools to commit in the fall."
lacrosse,3cotxw,merkmerthews,3,Thu Jul 9 16:50:41 2015 UTC,"Definitely going to need more context. Where are you from? Do you play for a club team? Give us a bit more details and we may be able to help you better.  At this point for D1, a walk on might be your best bet, but its not yet your senior season so there is still some time, but not much. Second best bet for D1 is to go the Junior College route and transfer in. If not D1, D2 and D3 are also options, and MCLA is also a great way to play in college."
lacrosse,3cn7oc,Fallicies,6,Thu Jul 9 05:28:10 2015 UTC,"Get yourself in front of a mirror.  Practice dodging with the stick in different ways, and practice protecting the stick as you ""run"".  Mimic the same position you would and make sure everything with your body is positioned exactly how you want it.  Agility training with ladders and on-the-go shots are very important as well.  Anyone can shoot standing still, but you need to be able to handle your weight while running as well, just as effectively as standing.    If you play defense, take your stick and practice doing pokes as well as doing strength training like constantly moving your stick up and down on two different surfaces, and see how fast you can do a certain number before getting tired.  Keep practicing and raising that number.  I'm just rambling now but you get the idea: position-specific drills with repetition and consistency!"
lacrosse,3cn7oc,Bausse,3,Thu Jul 9 06:41:49 2015 UTC,"FOOTWORK!  it is everything!  each step needs to be deliberate and never wasted.  practice dodging on poles/trees.  very slowly.  work on each. step. you. take.  one of the most cringe-worthy things for me to see is a guy doing a confused-stutter-step before a dodge.  its so awkward, telegraphed, and leaves you open.  jump-rope and those speed-ladders (i never used one, but did do some tire-running, back in the day) should help with the speed and agility of your steps, but not the intelligence (again, work on each dodge slowly until the footwork is perfect).  next thing as an attack:  practice craddling in the mirror.  if you can see the ball, so could a defenseman!  use this to practice switching hands, keeping the stick on the outside, and hiding the ball.  sorry for the stream-of-consciousness rant and lack of organization... if i missed anything or jumped to conclusions."
lacrosse,3cn7oc,SapienChavez,3,Thu Jul 9 17:34:25 2015 UTC,I just go for a run out with my stick and cradle in different manners that I would in a game.

lacrosse,3cn7oc,P4P4JEW,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:24:50 2015 UTC,I do this too but with my equipment on as well. Running with just a stick as opposed to both a stick and equipment is different.
lacrosse,3cn7oc,Runeon12,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:09:53 2015 UTC,"What position are you? * Conditioning is very important: sprints, change of speed, change direction (even backwards especially if you're D), different dodges. All this while cradling, do both hands too... * Accuracy: shoot at water bottles, increasing distance as you get dialed-in, then hit-em on the move, going both direction. * Strength: hit the gym... * Ask the school's coach/trainers for their fav drills and get in their good books before tryouts! They might have summer conditioning events you can get in on? Are you playing this summer?"
lacrosse,3cn7oc,dawtcalm,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:29:49 2015 UTC,I played attack in highschool since everyone but one guy were playing for their first time and my stick skills just happened to develop faster than most of the new guys but I feel like I'll definitely be at the bottom end when I go to uni and might get switched to mid.
lacrosse,3cn7oc,dawtcalm,2,Thu Jul 9 14:53:49 2015 UTC,"If you're changing position record games and rewatch them. Take mental notes of what good middies do to control tempo, communicate, and find the right men to start the play on offence, or manage the attack coming at you (Positioning!). Definitely work a lot on passing on the run.     If you're going to a GTA University, will it be tough to make a team since there's so many kids that have played box since youth?"
lacrosse,3cn7oc,wkfink,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:31:43 2015 UTC,Sounds like some pretty good advice. I'm going to uOttawa but yea a lot of guys have played box but it's a new program and a walk on team which makes it even more intimidating because I have to be able to keep up with the guys who have been playing forever.

lacrosse,3ci5mx,Firasissex,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:59:14 2015 UTC,Just stay with them. As D-mid you will have people dodging from up high and you have to stay on his hips and push him away from the goal. If he gets past you make sure you get back and cover  a different man
lacrosse,3ci5mx,BreadSpace,4,Wed Jul 8 21:07:44 2015 UTC,It's never too late.  I grew up playing in NoVA and played in high school with a guy who started jr year and 2 who started sr year.  The guy who started as a jr even played in college.  I would recommend playing middie rather than attack as middie relies a lot more on athleticism and attack requires the best stick skills on the team (which you wont have by the spring).
lacrosse,3ci5mx,smilli02,3,Wed Jul 8 13:50:26 2015 UTC,"its never too late to start, go for it; like the others have said, just keep up the stick skills and the rest can be picked up later with practice."

The guys on the team already are usually more than willing to help a new guy out (at least they were for me)
lacrosse,3ci5mx,hockeycam1344,2,Wed Jul 8 14:28:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's never too late, plus do you bro. Follow your heart, just keep working on stick skills, that's one of the most important things, because even if you're athletic stick skills will be a liability if you don't work with them. You're doing wall ball which is good, just keep working at it bro."

I'd also say go with middie, as you can still get good playing time while developing your stick skills.  Attack takes a lot of lacrosse IQ"

Find some other guys and play around with them for the summer. Watch some summer league games, and always keep the stick in your hands  I played summer league after graduating HS with guys who started playing in college on club teams, or started playing because their kids got into it. We have a great sport with an amazing community.   Take a trip to Ocean City, MD in mid Aug for the OC Lacrosse Classic tourney and watch the players there.

lacrosse,3c4dw4,NewYorkerinGeorgia,5,Sat Jul 4 18:29:43 2015 UTC,"Pretty darrn good shooter. Moves off ball quite well. Finishes well in close. Good passer.  Not a great dodger, no ground balls, little defense (o mid, I get it), weak left hand, and did more of his damage in man up than I would have liked.  There's potential here, but based on this video he's fairly one dimensional. He's very good at that one dimension, though."
lacrosse,3c4dw4,newaccoutn1,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:43:23 2015 UTC,Yeah definitely working on the left hand. We purposefully didn't put in much defense. In retrospect more should have definitely been included. I believe he is playing some d middie at the under armour underclassmen event this weekend. Thanks for the feedback!

lacrosse,3c4dw4,newaccoutn1,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:39:59 2015 UTC,This. The video seems like a highlight video put together more to show to his friends than to college coaches.
lacrosse,3c4dw4,the_swimsuit_edition,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:00:57 2015 UTC,"Not just defense. Ground balls, clearing, riding are all part of the game too.  Also, not every good play by your brother has to result in a goal to be included. The purpose of the video is to make your brother look good not his teammates, so if he has a great dodge and feed, but a teammate doesn't score because the goalie makes the save, that can be included in the video too. Hockey assists are worth including too if it's a good play. Just because he isn't credited with the assist doesn't mean he didn't contribute to the goal."
lacrosse,3c4dw4,LAWLzzzzz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:00:08 2015 UTC,"Also no hockey assists or clears. Honestly, the length of this video almost hurts by emphasizing how one dimensional he is as a player.  Seems like you just put together every goal and assist he had during the season plus 2 or 3 big hits and 1 defensive play in what appears to be chronological order. I would trim it down to only the 2 or 3 best goals or assists of each type (even outside shots, even inside finishes, even dodges / assists, man-up outside shots, man-up feeds, etc.) and arrange them so that they're either grouped by type of play or by order of importance with the best plays coming first. Done that way it makes him look like a much more well rounded player. Including every goal almost paints too accurate a picture of what he does."
lacrosse,3c4dw4,villejeff,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:55:27 2015 UTC,"I think he was actively trying to emphasize this dimension of his play. I just helped him put together the clips he wanted because he hasn't been home for more than two days so far this summer. He really seems to have copied his teammate Mac O'Keefe video style. Probably not the best example, but they're kids right?"

lacrosse,3bwj3f,brinkley26,5,Fri Jul 3 06:44:45 2015 UTC,"I have a short temper when I play lacrosse so it's very easily for me to get fired up over little things. It was the last game of my freshman year on JV and we were up 7-6 with a minute left so I was just pumped up. I was on defense and one of the middies came through a pick and roll and started driving towards the net, I noticed he was dangling his stick too much so I basically did a baseball swing to knock it out of his hand, which caused it to spin in the air. The ball rolled out and one of my teammates scooped it and we ended up with a transition goal to seal the win and finish the season with one single win."

I kept getting matched up with the same middie, and I kept slap checking his stick and forcing him to drop the ball. Eventually he ended up taking a shift on attack. Coincidentally, this was around the same time I was taking a shift on close D (one of our poles wanted a run at LSM). This kid was pissed that he kept getting matched up with me. He started getting more and more aggressive, he kept backing into me and trying to back into me, leading with his elbow and shoulder. So I started using the butt-end of my stick to fuck with him. I held my stick firmly so he kept driving his kidney into my butt-end. After a few rounds of this, and a little bit of chirping from both of us, he took a step forward, wound up, and took a baseball swing at my head. I started laughing and he got ejected immediately. We were only halfway through the game, and it continued to get even more chippy. We ended up winning by three. Still one of my favorite games.

I'm backup and we were playing against a farely easy team so I was probably going to go in some time during the game. Well the starting goalie and another starting attackmen decided to rip on me from 15 yards out. These were pretty easy  for me normally but that day was different. I ended up taking 4 shots to the nuts before the game even started. Last one had me on the ground. Thank god for the Nutty Buddy.

It was my first year playing lacrosse (I was on jv) and my two teammates were both 2nd year players who were on varsity. The teams were split up into two brackets, and my team went undefeated somehow.  In the finals, we got matched up against 3 of the best players on the team. I, being the only D-pole, played man defense on their best player. His team kept feeding him the ball and he just kept ripping right away, usually right into my groin area. Luckily I had a cup and he usually missed my nuts.  They needed one more goal to win, we needed two. They got the ball and fed it to  my man. As soon as possible I threw a poke right at his nuts for revenge. He decided not to wear cup at practice, and he buckled over in pain. I picked up the ball and cleared it myself. I went end to end and completely missed the tying shot.  They picked up the ball and scored a minute later. We lost and all I got were bruises."

Hurt so bad I vomited in my helmet. Now one ball is definitely smaller than the other. Not really sure if that did it. But it's a cool story to tell when drinking.

First game of my life I'd gone through tryouts playing shorty stick and all the practices leading up to it, on GameDay my coach tells me I'm playing dpole cause one of our dpoles was sick.  So the game starts and I'm beyond lost but things are going okay.   Then all of a sudden I experience getting hit by a shot, not any shot but a shot straight to my cup (which I wasn't sure about wearing orginally) the shot hit my cup so hard it broke it and I had plastic cut the shaft of my penis.  And that's the story of my first game and why I always wear a cup"

When I was in college, we flew to California or Florida every year to play some non-local teams for spring break and that was how we transported our poles.

USLacrosse is a business and a part of their model (the major part I would argue) is Growing the Game... without giving chapters some carrot (AAs) there's less/no investment or buy-in from the chapters and that hurts the bottom line of expansion. It makes total sense if you stop looking at it from an egocentric and isolated viewpoint.   It appears that Alabama actually shares its chapter with Mississippi... so probably they get many AA but I wouldn't want to be in that meeting - deciding all the AA's across 2 states has got to end in a shitshow with a lot of regional butthurt.

lacrosse,3brdj5,TheJonosaurusRex,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:34:43 2015 UTC,That is the best advice for any high school kid.   My advice is find some trees and practice dodging around them. You get cardio work and you will increase your ball handling. Focus on getting your steps and timing down exactly. Make sure you're practicing your stick protection. Keep your stick as close to your body as you can and get it up into a triple threat position as you as finish your dodge. Now add GB's.  Do this all until you find a wall. Having a solid question mark dodge or full speed face dodge is invaluable.

If you're looking for the basic concept behind the drill, try this video: LINK  If you'd like to get the offensive concept, this video does a fine job: LINK  If you'd like to get the defensive rotation, this video is decent: LINK  IMO, your defensive keys are:    Establish ""Point, Left, Right"" before the fast break is upon you and make sure you're all communicating it as the Mid is bringing the ball down (""I got point"" .... ""I'm here left"" ... ""I'm here right"") If you are ""Point,"" you need to know whether you're sliding early or late .... there are advantages to both but the most prevalent school of thought seems to be hold until the last moment and then slide to the middie.... obviously LEFT and RIGHT need to know their responsibilites (as the 2 slide and splitting 2) Point D needs to remember to slide back down (as he then becomes support and would likely rather give up the Middie shot than the Attack on crease).

Second responsibility is to play the ""lane and take away the pass straight down to the crease on your side. If you are in the lane the ball should go high either to your side or the other this depends on which side the top attack man sets up on.    If the ball goes high to your side then you slide to the ball and the other defender fill and form up the triangle behind you. If the ball goes high to the opposite side then you coma slide to the attack man on the other side of the crease.   Remember the goal of the drill is not to stop the fast break it is to slow it down so the offense has to pull the ball out and you get numbers to equalize."
lacrosse,3boojr,newswilson,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:47:45 2015 UTC,"Here is the breakdown:  As O4 brings the ball down, the goalie calls out fast break and D1 calls out that he has point.  All 3 defenders drop into the triangle as shown in the diagram.  Slightly before O4 approaches shooting range (usually a step or two inside the box, but depends on skill and age), D1 moves laterally to him to force a pass.  At the same time, D2 take a couple steps towards the middle of the field.  D2 is cutting off the passing lane to O2 and preparing to slide to O1.  O4s first passing look is to O2, but since D2 is cutting off that passing lane, the pass almost always goes to O1.  As O4 passes to O1: D2 moves up to cover O1; D3 take a couple steps towards the middle of the field, cutting off the passing lane to O3 and preparing to slide to O2; and D1 turns towards the ball before dropping back towards the near pipe in preparation to pick up O3."
lacrosse,3boojr,smilli02,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:31:23 2015 UTC,"A lot of people posted some good stuff in there so I'll just add my $.02  -knowing where you're supposed to be and communicating that before the break happens is 1/3 the battle in fast break play  -getting to your spot is another 1/3 (keep the triangle small)  -rotating and recovery are the last 3rd.    Misc:  There it no such thing as a halfway slide.  Go all the way or not at all. full speed but under control.    You're always rotating the opposite direction of ball rotation.  If it changes direction, make sure you do too.  Have your goalie set a fire spot before the game.  Fire spot is a scuff mark he puts in the field where he wants the point guy on break to make O4 make his pass or shoot.  Any shots outside of that are goalies problem.    Sticks up in passing lanes at all times to cut down on skip passes."

Lots of guys think they only do it during down time, or whatever, but it ultimately enters into game play. I see you were a goalie, i know y'all spin your sticks more. it took me like a year or two into college before an assistant coach turned to me during a groundball drill and said, ""you know, you spin your stick quickly every time you pick up a ball"". I had no idea. It takes a LONG time to work out of the habit... just saying. Also the low to high is a decent shot, but nothing you could really do on the run, and thats when a lot of opportunities come."

They hurt like a bitch when you hit yourself on a mis-jump, (and believe me, you will) but it's great motivation to get better and not mis-jump."
lacrosse,3bikao,drdriedel,3,Mon Jun 29 16:03:58 2015 UTC,Jumping robe is the obvious answer. I'd also recommend running shuttle drills like 5-10-5s. Another way to keep up is to force the offense to start their dodge earlier in order to give you more time to react.  Throw a poke dropstep at the big inning of a dodge will help a lot with this

NO WASTED STEPS EVER!!!  whats more, this is the most universal advice i can give for all sports (cept maybe horse or water polo).  footwork can make an average athlete look like a star and its not a product of athleticism, but intelligence/wisdom. (second would be, ""keep your eye on the ball"" generic advice for all sports)  the only quick way i can think to teach this, is to tie your legs together so your steps are shorter and force you to be more conscious of them.  this could work against you, if not done right... as i said, this is a hard this to ""say"" and not ""show"""

All three a very footwork intensive and will help you speed your legs up.  Try weighted standing high jumps (not box jumps since those are terrible for your Achilles' tendons) to build explosive power in your legs, and some yoga to improve flexibility.

Players and coaches can't fully devote 100% to the teams until the pro sport is bigger / the pro sport won't get bigger if the players and coaches can't fully devote 100%.

lacrosse,3bdf36,TheChickenOwner,11,Sun Jun 28 04:11:14 2015 UTC,"I'll be one of the hundreds to tell you, wallball is key, do lots of wallball, practice cradling and learning to hold the ball, how to windup on shots and passes, these are crucial parts of the game unless you are planning to play defense, for workouts you want to work on everything, legs for running, core for good twists while shooting, and arms/wrists for passing and shooting to increase speeds and accuracy. If you can't do either at a certain moment, pickup a stick and a ball and just work on cradling inside, different styles, situations, and techniques will all be important. To recap - Wallball, wallball, and more wallball"
lacrosse,3bdf36,redditor36,3,Sun Jun 28 04:51:37 2015 UTC,"i think redditor36 forgot to emphasize how important wallball is - wallball, wallball and  more wallball."

lacrosse,3bdf36,redditor36,2,Wed Jul 1 17:10:35 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice!!
lacrosse,3bdf36,Bogolog,3,Sun Jun 28 05:07:42 2015 UTC,"First, tons of wall ball like redditor36 said. Focus on accuracy and consistancy. Get some chalk and mark a 3"" by 3"" square on the wall and try to hit it every time. Also, watch tons of youtube videos on specific skills such as dodges/shooting on the run/footwork. The key to getting on the field is having skills that your team needs. Find out what your team needs and practice accordingly. Goodluck!"

Cradle while you walk around your house and get used to the ball in your stick the same way a basketball player learns to be comfortable dribbling. Also try to find another lacrosse player to work out with/play catch with, it helps a lot to have a buddy who's experienced and has had some coaching in the sport."
lacrosse,3bdf36,NewYorkerinGeorgia,2,Sun Jun 28 21:19:07 2015 UTC,"Looks like nobody else has really touched on your gym membership. I like to do all the main lifts, bench, overhead press, squat, and deadlift. But also focus a lot on core strength and explosiveness in your legs and upper body. Hack squats are good, resistance push ups. Something I've done to get my shot speed up is putting a cable about chest high, locking my feet perpendicular to it, grabbing the cable with both hands, and pulling it across my body with as much control as possible while barely moving my hips. Use your core to move and it'll really help."

Play wallball at least 30 minutes a day, if possible(good routine is repeating 50 right to right, 50 left to left, 50 right to left, 50 left to right, 25 right behind the back, 25 left behind the back). Buy a helmet, arm pads/guards, and gloves to practice with. You need to get used to the feel of these. Get a practice net and practice hitting the corners. To get in shape, run a lot, lift weights, really just work on getting endurance. For lacrosse, work on doing 10 reps of a smaller weights, not 1 or 2 of a heavier weight."

lacrosse,3bcl67,abcdefghij1234543,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:44:22 2015 UTC,"For an attackman I would recommend first a Lakota U, with a close second being an Optik U. Other options(I'm not sure if they would have the right holes) Brine RP3, Brine Clutch 3 X, Brine King X, STX Surgeon 10 500, or a Warrior Evo 4X. Double check to make sure the holes line up before buying. It's all about personal preference.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND Nike Lakota or Maverik Optik (the only noticeable difference between the heads is that the Optik is designed for a low pocket and the Lakota for a high pocket)"

lacrosse,3beems,comic-gamer,8,Sun Jun 28 13:22:36 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be 100% honest even though this sub seems to hate honesty on highlight tapes. You have pretty much no left. The teams you played against looked horrible. You are very selfish shooting from 20 out and dodging 2 slides and still holding the ball. (at least that's the way the highlights make you look). I don't think I saw a single assist. Pretty bad shooting form. Some of those shots should not have gone in and wouldn't have on a decent goalie. Good faceoffs but again, your competition didn't look that tough (not that you can control that). There is a lot to be worked on. If you keep working on faceoffs, it can really take you places. Just work and work and work and it will open doors for you. Because I think it's very clear you are a fogo, or faceoff mid with those hands. Remember, never get complacent with how you're playing. Keep working."

lacrosse,3ay4bd,2manylemons,27,Wed Jun 24 12:59:18 2015 UTC,"I'd be more than happy to answer any questions you may have.  I think there are several things that are 'different' at the college level, and since the HS experience can vary wildly, I'm not going to focus on the differences per se, but rather what's important on defense (at all levels - but especially at the Division 1 NCAA level):  1) On-Ball Defense: Different teams take different approaches. In general covering your man at this level does not mean taking the ball away. Stick technology and the players have become too good to rely on take away checks. A coach is looking for a player who will always be in the correct position, who will not ever get beat top side, who will hound the offensive players hands and make every exchange a little difficult, applying pressure when and where it makes sense. It means great footwork and positioning as you guard around GLE, trail through X, as you take away the top side and the good angle. Individual defense is not about taking the ball away, I cannot reiterate this enough. It's great to do it, in High School it is very easy, but really what you want at the next level is a guy who will take an excellent approach - stick down, short, choppy steps - and play the ball, forcing offensive players to advantageous spots on the field (for the d) and low angles to feed and score.  2) Off the Ball: Defense doesn't begin or end with on the ball. Most important is positioning and communication for the 5/6 of the time you're not on the ball. As a close defensemen there are some basic rules you can follow. Be in the 'paint' (you're either on the ball, in a passing lane, 1 slide or 2) and ready to slide, provide assistance for the slide man and direct recovery, or simply in passing lanes. COMMUNICATE. Cannot stress this enough. Don't talk for the sake of talking. Don't yell random things. But you must be able to direct your teammates in recovery. You must know who the 1 slide is and who has his back.  3) Stick Handling: The job of a defense-men does not solely rely on stopping the other team from scoring, it does not end with a save or a takeaway or a nugget. We must clear the ball. We must be great off the ground (once you pick up a GB.. get to space. Sidelines, end line, rarely up field.. take space.. stick low and away from pressure), we must clear 80+% of the time ( 7 on 6 after all). You must be able to throw and catch, on the run, with both hands consistently. Practice over passes, practice slinging the ball to middies on the move. You're stick skills should be as good or better than the offensive guys.. fuck 'em.  This day in age lacrosse has also become a full 10 man game. Defense-men can start transition. They can finish transition. Once you cross the midfield line you're a player. 6 foot pole or otherwise.  I think this is a good start, but feel free to fire any questions."
lacrosse,3ay4bd,BBBelmont,3,Wed Jun 24 15:04:33 2015 UTC,"Great post man.  I'd emphasize what you said about on ball positioning, and go so far as to say you want to try and dictate where the ball carrier goes.  Force them down into the slide, or to a spot where they have to move the ball.    Could you discuss initial contact on a dodge?"
lacrosse,3ay4bd,rufioherpderp,3,Thu Jun 25 02:30:43 2015 UTC,"Think it will vary depending where you are on the field and how the attackmen or midfielder plays it;  Either way it starts before the initial contact, with what we used to call the approach. As an lsm we're probably forcing our player down the alley, or perhaps his weak hand. As a close defender you're probably edging out to your attackmen as the ball circles or comes down the alley. You should be low to the ground in an atheltic position, short, choppy steps breaking down a few yards. We're taking an angle with a purpose, we're forcing our midfiedler down the alley to weak anglles or we're funneling our attackmen to x. We're going to get there with our stick out and low, as he goes in that direction we'll stay slightly on his hip, shading him so there's no roll backs or him getting top side. Trailing to x or the wing, we can start to get our hands on them as they get towards x or near gle or in shooting range. We're still athletic on hands on the gloves and as he gets into our body maintain that stance, bench press him.. either get a pop and get back into great position and apprroach again, or maintain your hands and drive him out of a dodging area. You can pop him as he goes to shoot as a lsm, or get under him and get your hands on him as he question marks or tries to turn the corner or establish near the crease, slot.  I'd say our initial approach to the ball carrier doesn't begin with contact, but you shoudl be focusing on footwork to drive him where the defense dictactes, either into a slide or out of harms way. When you do get your hands on him, stay low, maintain lleverage. Good place to pop is x, as you get towards gle you're engaging and driving out of there. Hands on him is nevelr bad, getting your hands on early works just don't lunge or get out of position to force it."

lacrosse,3ay4bd,buzzkillichuck,5,Wed Jun 24 13:21:36 2015 UTC,"I would respectfully disagree, the number one priority is to make them pass the ball, getting beat is going to happen, no defenseman is so talented that they never get beat.

lacrosse,3ay4bd,LookinStr8Grizzly,3,Mon Jun 29 01:43:19 2015 UTC,"Number one thing you should work on is body positioning. If you watch college lacrosse d poles never chase sticks on ball. They stay between man ball goal and use their stick to push attackmen away from the net. Usually d poles keep their stick on the back of their attackmen to defend against inside rolls. Stay low and use your legs to push attackmen out. Another thing you should work on is your slide package. Know where to be when people move. Get in the middle of the play and take away open men. Learn to compensate correctly for your other defenders. A lot of d poles will compensate too much and slide too early or have too much faith in their teammates and leave them on an island alone to get beat. You have to know your teammates and know when to help and when to stay. Last but not least is communication. Lacrosse is one of the view sports televised that you can hear the players speak. Be the loudest on the field call your slides, man, ball, switch, cutters and more."
lacrosse,3ay4bd,buzzkillichuck,2,Wed Jun 24 16:38:57 2015 UTC,"Simple answer: play defense with the feet and not with the stick, so many young players think stick checks are the way to go, they are indeed not   Long answer: I don't feel like typing it on my phone"

The ""I wanna fuck this guy up"" mentality is exactly what youth sports administrators are trying to get rid of. Until you change your attitude and play style they will have to continue to implement rules to stop you from doing it.  I'm 6'5 230 and believe me I hate the recent rule changes, but they exist for the players who want to head hunt. This is why the college referees allow so much more physical play, because the players at that level know how to do it under control."

Doesn't mean that if the helmets make contact there is a penalty  2) ""not allowing one person to knock someone else on their ass fighting over a groundball that neither of the involved parties had yet to win""... wrong again.  If it is a legal hit (from the front, not low or high, hands together, not initiated with the head, they have both feet on the ground) and within 5 yards of a loose ball than this is not a penalty.  The only ""new"" rule here would be the defenseless player, and that would be if you blow someone up as they are coming up from scooping a ball.  You want to hit people.  You can still hit people.

In college players will be bigger, faster and more skilled. You might blindside a few guys and lay them out but good attack men and mids will get into your hands and bait you to use your body and leave you in the dust.

lacrosse,3awq5w,newswilson,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:47:24 2015 UTC,"While true, it also makes it way too easy for an offensive player to run past defenders untouched, and if that player is struck, the large majority of the time the defender is penalized   If this is an issue in 1v1 defense, you need better footwork and body position. No one is getting lit up by a body check by their primary defender at the start of the dodge, so I'm not sure how the tighter rules make that harder for you.  If this is about sliding, well, if your intention is simply to blast someone, your form is probably shit.  It's a physical sport, but it is 100% a finesse game. If you're only out there to headhunt, you've missed out on a lot of the finer points that make lacrosse so great."
lacrosse,3awq5w,theheadcoach,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:34:31 2015 UTC,"I commented already on this but as a coach I wanted to add a little more. There will likely be no changes in the foreseeable future that favor the defense. Once a shot clock eventually gets down to high school and youth leagues in the next decade the game will be very different than it is today.   Sure there will be top teams that will learn to 'miss' shots in a calculated way in order retain possession as some college teams have already learned to thwart ""timer on."" But the game is going to keep opening up and with more shots and scoring will go up overall as teams will be kept from killing the ball as Canada did against the US in the Worlds last year.  In all likelihood the era of the big plodding close defender will all but end much the same way most NBA and college basketball teams are more likely to have centers who run the court and take jump shots instead of banging away under the basket full time.   I guess eventually you will need to adapt or die/not play very much."

lacrosse,3awq7v,lacrosse4hirer,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:43:58 2015 UTC,Depends on your play style. If you cradle vertically a lot you dont want a high pocket but if you cradle two hands and dodge with thwo hands then a high locket might not be too bad. I recommend a mid high with ecm hard mesh. It shifts lower for vertical craning and shifts back up high when cranking for a shot. Stray away from soft mesh as it gives better hold but hinders your release time.

I've faced as many as 60 shots in a single game when we played the top team, they had an all american taking faceoffs and spent 90% of the game with numbers on a fast break. Fun fact we were the only team all year to hold a lead against them after we got a garbage goal early to make it 1-0. Best game I ever played and we still lost 1-16."

lacrosse,3at4tt,Nomsensus,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:30:44 2015 UTC,"Stay home. You belong in the crease. As awesome as it is to come out and throw a check, once you leave the crease to hit someone you leave the goal wide open.   It also can can lead to blindsiding someone and getting hit with a penalty. Your coach will not be impressed if his goalie takes a meaningless penalty that costs the team a goal. Also it has been my experience that goalies who take dumb penalties are also the same guys who get run for arguing with the ref and retaliation.  If you become a goalie who routinely comes out to ""mix things up"" be prepared to be the goalie who also gives up an empty net goal when things go wrong."
lacrosse,3at4tt,newswilson,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:22:38 2015 UTC,Be careful when you do come out to hit an attackman though.  I love when a goalie comes out and i get the shot off right before they hit me.

Just be careful when you come out. You'll be leaving your net open and once you start hitting people, some players start to ignore the old unwritten rule of ""don't hit the goalie""."

lacrosse,3ajfli,Oggdogg87,4,Thu Jun 25 05:43:28 2015 UTC,"Didnt get a ton of play time in college, but had a great play during a practice. Caught a bad pass around the corner of the box and had to make a big reach while sprinting to snag it. Dirty defenseman sees I'm off balance reaching for it and shoves me in the back and I start to go down, so I take one last step before getting sideways and rip one sidearm. Saw our keeper in slowmo bring the stick low and across his body for the lower corner and bring pull up to his offhip. Too slow. The ball ricochets off the middle of the right pipe behind the keeper and hits the left pipe before reaching the net. Coach blows a long whistle and we all go home 10 minutes early. I was nearly worthless on the team, but some of the other rookies called me Mikey Powell for the rest of the week.  Also had a game in offseason in highschool where I had 7 goals and 2 assists. We won 9-2. Best part was our keeper was subbing in for the other team and I got to poop on him all day. On one of the goals, I could tell the guy defending me was frustrated so he was way tight on me outside the box. I start running away from the goal to catch a pass and he's too close for me to get my hands free, so I take a single cradle and shoot it behind the back the second I get it and immediately get decked. The ball bounces and hits top corner. I ran over and gave my keeper a high five afterwards and a bunch of parents started clapping like it was Wimbledon or something.  I'm pretty sure I peaked ages ago. Its all downhill from then."
lacrosse,3ajfli,laxatives,3,Sun Jun 21 00:03:48 2015 UTC,"For me, it's a save. Score is 10-9 my team, with 15 seconds left. This is the tournament final for my city, and the guy at X has cored on me 3 times that day. He beats his defender and goes around the crease to take a wide open shot at me. I step out from the crease and knock his 105 lbs. ass on the ground, I pick up the ball and hurl it towards my attack men, and the clock expires."

lacrosse,3ajfli,Shampoozled,4,Sat Jun 20 21:58:46 2015 UTC,"Playing attack and the ball being brought up ended up getting disrupted and was dribbling across the midline.  I attacked it like I was going to scoop it and felt my defender along with the left side defenseman closing to close off my perceived route and double team upon pick up.  Instead of scooping, I catapulted the ball up behind me, rolled back behind my defenseman, caught my own 'pass' in stride while the two defensemen were wondering where I and the ball went.  Took it right at goal and parked it on the hapless goalie.  I don't think I embarrassed two players like that at the same time ever again."

I'm roughly at GLE and heading east-west cause I have an attacker and an opposing middie wacking the shit out of my arms, but I manage to get a look up field.  Our attack and their D had been chilling up at mid-field while they were on attack, but as soon as I scooped the ball, our one, fast-as-shit attacker had turned and started burning toward their goal and about a half second before I get crushed by another one of their attackers (I'm not that big a guy for D), I heave a wild, cross-body 60 yard bomb that drops right into our attacker's stick mid-stride. At this point he's about 20 yards behind their D, and I, lying on the ground, watch him prance up to their crease and dump a little bounce-shot past their goalie."
lacrosse,3ajfli,NewYorkerinGeorgia,2,Sun Jun 21 00:01:50 2015 UTC,"Mine was a high school game against a school I still can't stand. Guilderland, you suck. Every game we played against them was chippy, and we had lost a particularly chippy game by one a few weeks before. In the hand shake line I made sure to remind them that we would see them soon. Coach chewed me out for it, but I was determined that the next time would be different.  So the next game was also close. In fact, it went to OT, and then we got a penalty. Crap. I was playing LSM, so I was at the top of the zone. Their middie was staring at the attackman behind me, so I started moving lower. He threw it anyway, and I picked it off. I bolted upfield. One of their middies was in my way. I gave him a fake, he bit, and then I went the other way. He tries the Hail Mary check but hits me on the head. Flag down, and no one between me and their box.  My attack set up the fast break L, and I'm running fast as I can. The point defender slides before I step into the box to release the penalty. I know what that means. Sure enough, the other defenders also went early, leaving the near side attackman wide open. I make a perfect pass, he takes a step, fires a shot and PING! Hits the pipe.  Good thing we have a man up...except we fail to score, give up a fast break, and they score to win the game without me ever getting back on the field.  But I did everything I could, that's for sure."
lacrosse,3ajfli,i_get_sarcastic,2,Sun Jun 21 00:40:18 2015 UTC,"I played attack and was waiting at the midfield. It was almost halftime and we were up by 7-6 but we only had a few seconds to score. One of our long poles made a great poke check, scooped the ball and threw it high and far(guillotine esc) and it flew over all of our heads. I turned sprinted as fast as I could to the ball, heard the countdown from the sidelines and we two seconds left I hockey slapped that son-of-a- bitch into the goal...best goal of my life!"
lacrosse,3ajfli,DartsandFarts,2,Sun Jun 21 03:12:46 2015 UTC,"Not my best play, but it was my favourite.  Start of third period (minor box lacrosse) my team was down 6-5 in our semifinal match. We set up at centre for the face off and one of my good buddies is taking the draw so we've practice quite a few plays together.   Right as the ref is about to blow the whistle I sprint towards the other teams net and get a head start on the defender. My buddy wins the draw and no-look passes it straight down the middle towards their goalie (we had talked about this beforehand, if he were to win the draw he would toss it down the floor as quickly as possible), I snag it, pull a fake to the left and shoot right and it goes in. It wasn't all that special of a play besides scoring within max 5 seconds after the draw, but the part that makes it my favourite is the fact we did the exact same play on the following draw. I gave my buddy a nod, and that was it. My defender didn't attempt to cheat back as he thought I was going for the loose ball off the draw. We went from losing 6-5 to being up 7-6 within all of maybe 8 seconds. Funny thing was we tried it a third time later in the period but I rung it off the post. You'd think the other team would clue into it but I guess not.   Definitely helped that I had confidence in my buddy on the draw so I could make a play like this without putting myself way out of position on most occasions. We did this play probably 15 times throughout the season successfully with 4 or 5 more posts/cross bars."

Conversely, I still get nauseous remembering the first time I hit someone hard enough that he got a concussion when the back of his head hit the ground.  I was 15, playing JV and terrified that I'd really really hurt another kid in what was a totally meaningless game.  It's weird.

lacrosse,3aigwf,adamn45,8,Sat Jun 20 14:33:22 2015 UTC,It all starts with wall ball. Play wall ball every single day. Get comfortable with your left hand.
lacrosse,3aigwf,Wac-Arnolds,2,Sat Jun 20 17:19:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, I can't stress this enough. You can play wall ball all you want with your dominant hand, but it takes switching your hands successfully to truly have great stick skills."
lacrosse,3aigwf,Runeon12,6,Sat Jun 20 22:00:17 2015 UTC,"Wall ball, then wall ball some more and after that wall ball again. Don't get stuck in the same routine. A good routine to start out with would be   25 Righty  25 Lefty  50 Catch right, throw left - Catch left, throw right  25 Quick stick left   25 Quick stick right  25 over the shoulder left  25 over the shoulder right.  And do four sets of that. 5 days a week if you can."
lacrosse,3aigwf,concussed_cowboy,4,Sun Jun 21 02:17:54 2015 UTC,Wall ball wall ball wall ball.
lacrosse,3aigwf,hawkin5,3,Sat Jun 20 17:21:19 2015 UTC,"Get an agility ladder and a jump rope. Get your feet moving quick. It's a huge part of lacrosse that people rarely think about. Watch games. Watch your position not the ball. Watch where they're standing, where they're looking, what they're saying. For example I play defense on the crease. I watch that teams defenseman like a hawk. I turn the volume as loud as I can to hear their calls. Who's hot and who has your two are huge. Notice who is what and at what time. If you can find some pick up games to play in. You can hit the wall and work out as much as you want but nothing compares to actually playing. Find a friend and give him a stick. Get all geared up and have him hit the shit out of you while you work on cradling. If you drop the ball shout ball down and scoop through it. DO NOT RAKE! If you can't find a pick up game I suggest playing basketball. Defense is lacrosse is just like playing defense in basketball. You use positioning and your body. Hope this helps. Hit the wall like crazy. Find someone with a goal and take some shots. Lax players are everywhere so find someone and practice with them. Good luck!"
lacrosse,3aigwf,DeeeezNuuuutz420,2,Sat Jun 20 15:49:44 2015 UTC,"May need a bit more context, such as what position you plan to play, what college and level of competition you'll be engaging in.  Obviously wall ball for 30 mins to an hour everyday should get you the fundamentals you need. Other than that, watch games to understand the game and try to see if you can find other guys to play pickup with."
lacrosse,3aigwf,dirtydan2423,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:11:48 2015 UTC,"This. The word ""club"" for college lacrosse is a very loaded term. If you're talking about a national ranked contender in the MCLA or NCLL, you are probably not going to stand much chance. But if you're going to a school with a small team/new club then you have plenty of opportunities.  Stick skills ""Lax IQ"" Hustle/Hard Work Athleticism  in that order. You can be fat and slow if you have great stick skills and are smart. I know defensemen in college who are some of the least athletic people but make up for it by having a good stick, being smart, and working hard. I have also seen superb athletes with a great work ethic who make up for a lack of stick skills or smarts by being tenacious on ground balls and riding hard.  We need a better context to answer this better."
lacrosse,3aigwf,theheadcoach,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:40:25 2015 UTC,Pick up hoops for basic one on one offense and defense. Wall ball for stick skills.
lacrosse,3aigwf,Looks_Like_Twain,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:11:11 2015 UTC,"On top of wall ball, ground balls are important, roll the ball out run and scoop, repeat.  Being able to pick the ball up is important"
lacrosse,3aigwf,lxdawg25,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:49:48 2015 UTC,"Everyone is on wall ball, which is important, but if you want to play, you need to throw on the run.  Move when you throw.  If you aren't a goalie, you will rarely throw with your feet planted, and I would say movement is more important than a left hand when you're starting."
lacrosse,3aigwf,ShakeAlake,0,Sun Jun 21 04:07:49 2015 UTC,Each day play wall ball lefty and righty and practice running and getting low on ground balls. Also shoot lefty and righty each day doing all bounce shots until you can comfortably crank with each hand. Lastly watch lacrosse and look at the different dodges and notice the defensive positioning. It also might help if you play in an indoor league for preseason

lacrosse,3afoml,Super_Schwa,6,Fri Jun 19 19:26:27 2015 UTC,It all is kind of your personal preference. All heads fit on all shafts(although you may have to drill a hole for the screw). I personally love warrior shafts(krypto and dolomite) but I hate their heads. So I use a brine eraser 2 and an STX hammer.
lacrosse,3afoml,Turtwig476,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:52:48 2015 UTC,"I found out that my green Warrior Kryptolyte Krypto Alloy shaft, doesn't fit on my friend's STX Stinger head. The STX Stinger head has a straight edged hexagon end on it, the Warrior Kryptolyte Krypto Alloy shaft has a wavy edged and rounded points on it's end. That kinda killed my idea of buying the STX Stinger head, restringing it, and putting it on my Warrior Kryptolyte Krypto Alloy Shaft."

lacrosse,3achsc,Chafed_HotDog,2,Fri Jun 19 03:03:38 2015 UTC,"St. Ignatius is the best school on the west coast. This year they traveled back east and beat Landon by 2 and then lost to Gonzaga by 3 the next day if I remember correctly.  Pretty great considering those schools finished 2/3 in the rankings. Amazing program they run over there, hopefully setting an example for some other west coast schools to follow."
lacrosse,3achsc,Sargeypoo,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:14:43 2015 UTC,Ugh don't remind me about that game vs St Ignatius. Bad memory.
lacrosse,3achsc,Mboydee02,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:33:41 2015 UTC,"Judging by your reaction I'm going to assume you played for Landon this past year. Honest question, how did your team view the game against SI in the days leading up? Did you expect a good team that you would ultimately win against or did you expect to beat up on them?  I grew up, played, and coached here on the west coast so I wonder how the east coast powerhouses view games against us."
lacrosse,3achsc,Sargeypoo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:44:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly we didn't take you guys over on the west coast that seriously. We studied film on Ignatius from when they played other West coast teams but we didn't think it'd be an accurate representation of how they'd play against us.   We were coming off a 10+ game winning streak, beating Gilman, Calverton, and a very good Mccallie by a considerable margin, so we didn't expect a huge fight out of Ignatius. We paid the price.   Props to them though, they played as if it was a superbowl game. It really pissed us off that they went on to lose to gonzaga who we beat by one in a huge game.   In terms of West coast lax, I have lots of respect for you all. Coronado was as good as many of the first ten teams we played, and they weren't any pushovers."
lacrosse,3achsc,Mboydee02,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:54:44 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the honesty. That can definitely happy when you are a great team that is already playing well, sometimes those games can sneak up on you.   I know it kinda sucks because it's at your expense but when west coast teams get big wins like that it does huge things for us out here. It's hopefully going to motivate some schools out here to fund a NCAA div 1 team in the near future. I want to see more top west teams going back east for spring break and vice versa."

lacrosse,3aba8l,ClearSearchHistory,5,Thu Jun 18 18:27:47 2015 UTC,"Just teach him to catch and throw, pick up GBs, and cradling. No need for defense, if they want more lessons teach him game scenarios things like defense and dodging. But keep it simple for the most part and keep to the fundementals."
lacrosse,3aba8l,thelaxative,2,Thu Jun 18 18:44:57 2015 UTC,"How do i teach how to catch and throw? Like, i'm in high school. I have no memory of my first days. Should i have him like flip a ball in the air and try to catch it?"
lacrosse,3aba8l,dj_bpayne,4,Thu Jun 18 18:46:37 2015 UTC,"1st make sure he has a helmet, or use like a tennis ball. Teach him to catch by moving his top hand to the throat and giving with the ball rather than snatching at it (both hands!). You'll be better off showing him, but don't choke down on your catches until he's ready to learn that as well. On passes just make sure he's learning overhand throws (both hands!) and that he's consistent. Take the whip out of his stick until he's ready. Cradling is really just watch and repeat. Show him how to cradle (both hands!) and then ask him to combine catch-cradle-throw and then switch hands.   Give him a stick he can 'have' and tell him to pick it up every day. If you have multiple starter sticks lying around, give him 2. Once he gets invested his parents will buy him a decent one and you can get your loaner back. If you get him hooked, he'll want to play catch every day, and get his friends/family involved. Some kids are great about that  The most important thing is to make it fun. With 10 year olds their attention span isn't going to last 1 straight hour, or even 30 minutes straight, so break up the exercises with water breaks and talk to him about other sports he plays and see if you can relate some mechanics/positions to lacrosse. Good luck!"
lacrosse,3aba8l,dj_bpayne,3,Thu Jun 18 19:22:00 2015 UTC,"Alright, i just finished up day two. I played some more catch, both hands with cradling. I taught him the split and roll dodges, he picked them up quick. I want to show him some lacrosse videos, but idk what. Got any highlight tapes you can link me?"
lacrosse,3aba8l,thelaxative,2,Fri Jun 19 15:42:33 2015 UTC,"I love this video - it shows how hard you have to be moving to dodge in lacrosse, how to properly switch hands and how to really crank back and shoot   Emphasizing quick release on catch-and-shoot  If his parents are willing you can sit down at their house and watch this video with his family. It's a little dry (but aren't all educational videos?) but it's got a ton of great information.   Defense - Zink gives great advice on positioning and hands, but doesn't really demonstrate in this vid - thankfully you're there to show him!   This was just a quick look over my bookmarks, let me know if you need anything else man!"

You can prevent some of the warping by stringing it such that little tension is put on the head ( STX Superpower Pattern: https://youtu.be/nweO8LgZsmk).  The Super Power Plus looks like it is far more warp-proof than the OG SP and if you haven't checked them out yet, the Nike CEO, Nike Lakota (HS and U), and Warrior Evo 4 (HS and X) were popular heads among the attackmen on my high school team this past spring."

Back in 10th grade I had a sweet Turbo with a five diamond pocket and three hockey lace shooting strings that cupped the ball like it was checking for hernias.  The thing was stolen out of my room at camp while me and my roommate were off hitting on the tennis girls we were sharing the campus with.  Fortunately, my backup head was another Turbo, and after staying up all night restringing, I was good to go the next morning.  The pocket was never quite the same, but it taught me a valuable lesson about lacrosse camp.  Take your stick with you EVERYWHERE."

lacrosse,39yi9d,jewunit,3,Tue Jun 16 17:42:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know man, it looks pretty similar to what actually happened. The goalie isn't even out of position, he's where any goalie would have been when the ball is behind the cage.  Interestingly though it's backwards."
lacrosse,39yi9d,SapienChavez,2,Tue Jun 16 19:30:49 2015 UTC,"similar, oh yea.  i did chose my word very intentionally, ""romanticized.""  when a guy starts to drive, you should be prepared to step to the pipe, for the shot or the assist.  i understand im playing some ""monday morning QB"" here...and i never played D1!  but i do know proper goal-tending footwork and i would never use this video as an example of what to do!  i would use it so show why protecting the pipe is so important.  (its one trick that can make almost anyone look like a good goalie.  hold that pipe!).   one step would have done more than swatting at the attack's stick.  but again, playing in goal changed because of this and i may have gotten my cart in front of my historical-horse! (and to clarify, its the statue that is making th goalie look worse!)  i did watch the video for a refresher before commenting...  the Defender is not even close to what really happened."

lacrosse,39t88z,JackJonJonny,3,Sun Jun 14 16:28:54 2015 UTC,"I know it's not much compared to New York/Maryland, but Houston has almost 60 youth programs, each with multiple teams at each grade level. It's really cool to see at big tournaments all the different corners of the city come together. We have about 20 men's league teams as well so we get the parents of the kids involved, as well as alumni and coaches. 10,000 would barely fill one side of the Dynamo stadium (capacity 22,000) so it looked kind of empty, but every suite was sold out and the president's club was about 3/4 full which is more than normal Dynamo games get!   And yeah I'm sure the Chron pushed this article to like a C-team writer who slapped this together immediately after the game haha"
lacrosse,39t88z,henerydods,3,Sun Jun 14 17:13:57 2015 UTC,"I think pro will do better in non hotbed areas anyway. Too many people in the northeast don't watch MLL because college had been the top level for so long and tradition means that people don't want to go watch MLL over college. People don't like change. You don't have that in places like Texas, Cali, Washington, Colorado, or a more field friendly Canadian city if they were ever to come back to Canada. I hope they start exploring non hotbed areas a little more, plus Texas is cool and when they get a pro sports team they usually roll with it and go hard."
lacrosse,39t88z,newswilson,2,Sun Jun 14 20:37:29 2015 UTC,"Louisiana reporting in, it was a great weekend of lacrosse. My club sent over our high school team to the Casey Powell Shootout and the All Star game. I would love to see MLL down on the gulf coast in Houston. Our kids only get to see MCLA down here and MLL on TV. Having a pro team closer than a 12 hour drive would do wonders for camps and clinics eventually too."

lacrosse,39thbf,usernamecomingsoo,3,Sun Jun 14 16:52:42 2015 UTC,"Maverick Optik, thompson i6, Warrior rabil 2, Clutch 3, Warrior Burn, and Nike Lakota are all good middle heads. The stiffest of these heads is the i6, but it's all up to your personal preference. Check out some reviews on youtube for these heads."
lacrosse,39thbf,Oggdogg87,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:35:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks, do you think it's worth waiting for the Metrik instead of the optik?"
lacrosse,39thbf,Oggdogg87,3,Sun Jun 14 19:12:28 2015 UTC,"The Metrik has been out a while, so I assume you're talking about the centrik. If you really want a middle maverik head I would wait a few weeks for the centrik. Although from some of the stuff I've watched, the centrik isn't the best option available. If you've been playing D the last few years you should probably use the i6 because it will be the easiest for you to adjust from a D head like the Hammer. You'll also probably being playing some defensive middie, so you'll want a stiffer head. I would advise a rabil 2 or an i6. But I would probably see about talking to your coach/local lax store(if you have one) about what you should use for your play style. Everyone is different when it come to lax heads."

Following the same idea, just include the summer team you play for on the slide with your coaches' emails.  Finally, on the slide with the summer tournaments, there was like 3 typos so I'd just quickly fix those if you are going to include what I suggested above.

Considering everyone looks like they are wearing football shoulder pads and the skill isn't all that great, I am assuming this is high school or maybe even club level.  I love the dark teams defensive strategy which is guard your attackman and let him suck you right out of the play so that any kind of slide package is impossible.  I usually hate ripping apart peoples talent level but after playing college ball and dabbling in coaching I just can't remain silent about this one."

The noz has always flexed great, also noticed that CEOs and lakotas snap a lot.  I played fogo for 4 years and I'm playing D3 ball next year."
lacrosse,39nb0z,davidbemis22,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:49:01 2015 UTC,"fogo here, the blade og is by far the best face off head ever, so thats always a good one to try, but if the price is too much the blade pro and the brine houdini have both served me well, however the houdini can be a little too narrow and instead of pinching and topping with it, sometimes you do more of a pinch and punch the shit out of your stick till it comes out the back. Also it depends on what type of a face off guy your are, what moves you use, and how long you want it to last. The blade pro lasted me about half a season, longest a head has lasted me, but i could not pinch and pop for the life of me due to the warping that happened about half of the way through its life cycle. Here's a list of dank heads courtesy of the face off academy  Tribe 7 Ghost Tribe 7 Sceptre  Warrior OG Blade Warrior Blade 2.0 Warrior Blade Pro Warrior Noz Warrior Rabil X STX Super Power STX Proton Power Brine Clutch Brine Houdini  Gait Recon XLU Gait Torque Under Armour Charge Nike CEO"
lacrosse,39nb0z,Lax4Evr,0,Fri Jun 19 02:07:25 2015 UTC,"IMO, the CEO is the best faceoff head out right now. It's a good enough field head that plenty of attackmen use, but also has a great flex point for faceoffs. If you want a similar flex but at a lower price point, then the Sceptre7 by Tribe7 is the way to go.   Edit: Grammar"
lacrosse,39nb0z,benches48,-3,Sun Jun 14 12:11:29 2015 UTC,"I played more of a wing/supporting position than a guy who would take face-offs. Honestly, a head that has a good pocket and is fluid enough to feel easy when you're taking face-offs is a good head. As long as you can hold onto the ball and pick it up quickly without the head flying off, you should be fine.  EDIT: I'd listen to /u/Tkee16, he definitely knows better than I do."

It was a sloppy mess until Jefferson took over in the 2nd quarter.  Lakeville looked TERRIBLE.  Flat-footed on offense and the keeper was completely outclassed.  Finals predictions:  Consolation Final: Mahtomedi 11- 6 Blaine.... Zephyrs have looked pretty good this tournament.  Gave BJ a solid game and then beat Blake.  Blaine got rocked by EP and then beat a MG team that really shouldn't have been there and they played like it.  3rd Place: Lakeville North 9- 6 Eden Prairie... This doesn't make sense if you look at the body of work, but you have to understand the team dynamics.  EP has won back-to-back state titles, they don't want to be playing in this game while for LN, 3rd would be the best finish in their school's history.  They have much more to play for and will be angry after getting embarrassed today.    Championship: Bloomington Jefferson 10-7 White Bear Lake... I'd love to see the title come to the east-side but the Jags are a team of destiny and this is their year.  If WBL get a face-off run like yesterday, they could make it interesting, but BJ's grinding defense will pull it out."

lacrosse,39gtmp,themalvado,3,Thu Jun 11 16:57:37 2015 UTC,"What the Thompsons are teaching in those clips are what we call ""step shooting"". Basically you catch, step, and shoot all in one quick and smooth motion. We actually work on it a lot in box so that's why you see box guys are so good at it. It's fundamental to us.   There is actually a progression based way of learning this. It needs to start at the wall when you play wall ball, this is where you get out of the bad habit of over cradling all the time. We tend to be able to see three levels of lacrosse player when you first see someone play, the beginner who can hardly cradle and barely moves their stick, then the guy who has some years under his belt and is pretty good but over cradles like crazy when he has the ball and always does at least three cradles in his crop step before he shoots. Then you have the expert, just the perfect level of cradling, you can never tell exactly when he wants to release that ball but you know he can release it at any point, guys like Mark Matthews look like that, and it looks effortless, am I right?   Anyway, the drill for getting into that habit is simple. Go to the wall and play wallball, but I want you to focus on something very specific. You need to do no cradle passes, what this means is you need to pass, then catch, then without cradling again you pass again. You need to repeat this a ton. Here is how I do it, I start of slow and with a pause. So I pass it, catch it, pause for 2 seconds, then pass it again, then catch it, pause for 2 second. Repeat WITHOUT cradling at any time in there. It will look funny at first but it's effective. Slowly you begin to speed up, which means you pause for less time. So then you pause for one second for a few passes, then half a second, then you stop pausing but aren't going fast yet, then you go super fast, then you go as fast and hard as you can until you drop it, then you start over again, typically when I play wall ball I do this about 3-4 times, but as a newbie I would do it more. I do this every single warm up in box lacrosse and field when I can find a wall to throw against too. So by the end of the ""drill"" you are doing very fast and hard quick sticks and trust me, you should feel the burn. This will, without a doubt, get you into the habit of being able to release that ball without all that ""noise"" we like to call excessive cradling. If you can do this really well then congratulations, you're about 75% there. As you get more experienced I would work on making those passes really hard and crisp, remember though to start at your level. Start simple and work your way up.   You mentioned ""how do they get it to that sweet spot in the stick,"" but here's the thing... They don't. Look at the second vine of the Thompson brothers, he literally pauses there with the ball in his stick, then just shoots. He can pause like that and shoot with his stick at any angle. You need to get out of the habit of needing that ball in the perfect spot. Don't worry, the previous drill should help with that feeling.   Next is actually step shooting. This is pretty simple and progress based again when it comes to the drill, but I'll explain the actual shot first. There are three components, the catch, the step, and the shot, nothing else, no crop hop, no cradle, and no nonsense. You just catch, step, then shoot. First the catch, ideally you catch the pass with your arms and hands out and away from your body. Look at that second Thompson vine again and look how they catch with their arms out extended and ready to shoot, this is where the power comes from. Remember though that these guys are powerful enough to shoot hard even without their arms fully extended and you can be to, just practice.   Next is the step. Ideally you step AT THE SAME TIME as you catch, but when you are first starting out DO NOT DO THAT. This is part of the progression. When you first start practicing this you need to catch the ball, THEN step to the target with ONLY your front foot, THEN shoot. This isn't a crop hop, it's a single step, it's simple. As you get better and practice more you slowly speed those three things up, start your step a little sooner, throw with less pause, etc.   Lastly is the shot. You need to look at the target and follow through with your shot, it's simple. No cradling between catching and shooting, NONE!  Now let's get to the drill. Here's what you need to do, have a friend throw you a ball just like the Thompsons were doing there, or pass you one if you like. Have him put the ball a little outside so you have to extend your arms a bit to catch it, this is normal and how it should be. Now you catch it WITHOUT stabbing at the ball or cradling, just absorb the ball in. Now I want you to step, look at the target, and pause. Don't shoot right away, just pause and wait a second just like in the wall ball routine. I want you to visualize (or if you're in practice actually watch) a goalie moving cross crease to follow that pass to you, and watching where he stop or how fast he is moving. It's at this point you shoot based off the goalies reactions and I want you to shoot to one of two locations. Either you beat the goalie ""short side"" (to the post he is moving towards on this pass) or you shoot around him ""far side"". These are your only two options now, and you will score a lot if you can do this.   Now I want you to start this SLOW, almost excessively slow. But this is how you developed good habits so take it easy at first. Start standing still first too. Keep it simple, catch, step, pause, shoot, catch, step, pause, shoot, simple. Now after a few reps I want you to shorten the pause, then take out the pause. Once you can do it nicely without the pause (remember, at no point are you cradling), start stepping earlier a little before you catch the ball. Then start stepping earlier. Ideally you catch the ball just before you finish your step and you start ripping it ASAP. But remember, that's the end goal and you should progressing to that, not trying to start there.   After you can do it pretty decently standing still you need to start adding in some movement. Start by doing it in a slow walk, then a light jog, then a harder run. Progress up to the big stuff man, it's how you develop good habits and strong fundamentals.   Hope this isn't too much of a wall of text. I practice this just about every other day so it's pretty normal for me, haha. It's an incredibly useful skill to have in both box and field, but while it's a luxury to have in field it's fundamental to have in box so that's why we practice it so much."
lacrosse,39gtmp,henerydods,2,Sat Jun 13 03:16:11 2015 UTC,"this is awesome. My box coach told me when I was younger that if he knows he has some space, he'll shoot with a normal grip. Bottom hand near bottom of shaft, top hand a forearm length away. Then he said if he knows he has to get a shot off quick, whether it be a quick slide or off a dodge, he puts his bottom 6-8 inches from the bottom and then his top hand just a hand's length away. Do you think this would help? I'm going to try to not cradle at all for all my ball drills now and see how it goes. This is something I really want to develop, something to become my niche. Thanks for giving me a progression. Very useful since I'm an articulate guy when it comes to form. Like to do things slowly and habitually.  Also, do you think this could apply on the run as well? Maybe if I'm shooting right down the alley, stand only 3-5 yards away at an angle, take one step with left, take one step with right, wind up without a cradle, then push off my right leg to shoot? For that drill you mentioned where I add movement, is this catching and then movement without cradling the ball? Because I could see how the habit helps a quick release on the run; not needing to cradle before you shoot after a dodge"
lacrosse,39gtmp,henerydods,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:19:31 2015 UTC,"Id say 90% of people put their bottom hand at the bottom and it never moves. I don't think sliding your bottom hand up is a good idea as I think it limits you in options on what you can do. Nobody I know moves their bottom hand at all, that one stays glued to the bottom of their stick. Moving the top hand is good though, the closer to the head your top hand is the easier it will be to catch, but the less power you get in the throw. I would practice with your top hand at all the levels when playing wall ball and then you're prepared for anything, but keep your bottom hand glued to the bottom of your stick.   The one where you add movement would be catching while on the run, not running after you catch. Think as if you are cutting up from GLE in a big arc to the top middle about 15' in front of the net, then you get a pass at the middle as you're running in, then you catch on the run, and take a shot on the run ASAP (meaning without a cradle and in 1 step or less). This has progression too in that you start by walking it, then light jog, then hard job, then if you can try it at a sprint or game speed run.   Any time you're moving you will need to be cradling though, it's next to impossible to dodge without cradling and still keep possession of the ball. But there is an excessive amount of cradling and the guys you are talking about are kings of finding that perfect balance and I already think you're a step ahead by being able to identify that as a strong skill to have. The keys to this aren't so much the cradle though, but stick position. Those guys get their sticks into the ""triple threat"" position as soon and as much as possible and it makes then really hard to defend against. And they can shoot bullets from very little wind up (which is what you will be working on with quick sticking on the wall and in the drill you seen).   As I said, it's awesome that you identified this, this is one of those ""box style"" things that translates so amazingly well to the field game and I love that field guys are identifying this now and trying to practice it themselves."
lacrosse,39gtmp,henerydods,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:26:05 2015 UTC,"worked on it today and felt like I wasn't missing a beat. I did about 40 reps slowly then used a wall as a feeder and I was naturally catching a split second before I step to the net. It sucks I've just now realized the important of quick releases and being able to shoot bullets with just a flick of the wrist considering I'm going into my senior year of college. I feel if I work on this every other day, I'll be prepared by fall ball, let alone when spring comes. Just need to get rid of the habit of noise. Thanks!"
lacrosse,39gtmp,spinosaurus7,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:52:43 2015 UTC,"Dont feel bad about the late start. Take it from this ""old timer."" Lacrosse doesn't stop when university stops, it might slow down a bit, but it never stops. I play men's leagues now that I have far far more fun with than I ever did in Jr/college. I still train just as hard myself because that's what I find fun, and when I get on the floor I play to win, but at the end of the day it's always been about having fun for me. And the fun only got better as I got older. I would even say that while I was more athletic when I was younger, I'm a far far better player now even without the athleticism.   Sounds like you're having fun with it and that's key. Keep up that good work and don't get too discouraged that college ball is coming to an end. Hell I even play the odd masters rules (no contact type rules for old people) tournaments and have a blast. It's all about the friends you make and the lacrosse world is full of great ones."

lacrosse,39gtmp,MJR215,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:02:41 2015 UTC,One of the keys to a quick release is being able to receive the ball exactly where you need it to be to shoot accurately.
lacrosse,39gtmp,newswilson,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:49:38 2015 UTC,"I feel like strength, especially wrist strength, learning to keep a quiet/relatively motionless stick when you want to shoot, including not having your arms and hands ""lag"" behind the rest of your upper body rotation and not winding up much beyond having your stick point like an arrow at your target, having your entire upper body rotate (more like the manner in which would you swing a bat and not a typical overhand shot where there is downwards crunching) at once your leg drive hits (as in your glutes fire and hips start to rotate) your hips, hands pretty tight to body, and really driving the head of your stick forward with your top hand with your elbow pointed back (I'm thinking have your elbow pointed and drive it like you are punching something across your body, starting with the upper back and shoulder muscles on the side of your top hand activated like you would when rowing), and having a low to three quarters release same points go for are some key points.  The same points would go for an overhand release except you would do a twist/crunch with your torso and probably can get the ball out of your stick faster with more accuracy but less speed.  As for some drills, I'd say practice those things and getting the ball out of your stick as fast as possible once you decide to shoot, whether you are on the run or doing a catch and shoot, probably from inside 10 yards.  Perfect practice makes perfect!"
lacrosse,39gtmp,newswilson,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:48:13 2015 UTC,"Great post! This is something I work on with offensive players I coach especially players who get chances in tight to the goal. The way we break it down for them is stripping away steps from your normal shot process. An analogy that some kids get is pitching from the stretch in baseball vs, pitching from the wind up.   You are essentially cutting down your motion to speed it up by not reaching back and using either a torque or settling cradle in your motion. You are also not depending as much on driving using your legs. You are deriving the force of you shot with you hips ad torso.   The speed in which the shot comes makes up for any loss of velocity and cuts down on the potential reaction time of the defender and goalie. It can be a tough skill for younger player to pick up because they are usually taught from a young age to really rear back and explode their feet, hips and shoulders and hands through the (zone) shooting motion. The quicker release cuts much of that muscle memory out and makes it tough for many kids to learn.   Box players excel at this as you have noted because they learn and experience the need for quicker shots in tighter quarters."

lacrosse,39937l,theanuranking,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:18:25 2015 UTC,"I missed the late hit the first time too, cause I was ball watching (hey, I wasn't the single-side ref!) but it was pretty blatant the first time.  If I were that ref, I would have flagged them both.  They both get to sit for the rest of the game with no real impact.  But it sends a message."

lacrosse,39873p,timhortons000,9,Tue Jun 9 23:22:37 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of dissent in this thread.  Some comes from a differing view of the situation and some comes from just a general ignorance of the rules.   First we need to know what level we are dealing with and under what rules.  I'm guessing that it's a high school (above U15) therefore we don't have to worry about the ""take-out check"" wording. Secondly let's discuss the timing of the hit.  It's important to note that there is zero language about late hits in the NFHS rulebook. It is in the youth rules, but not the standard NFHS rulebook for HS.  That doesn't that we can't call it, that just means that there aren't strict guidelines outlining it.  The general rule of thumb with late hits is when the hit was initiated, not when it landed.  In watching this films several times, it seems as though Black initiated the hit when Green still had the ball.  I would hesitate to flag this for it being late.  It's borderline, and I wouldn't be unhappy with a partner for flagging it as late though. Next is to determine where contact was initiated on yellow and what part of black's body initiated the contact.  It seems as though Black's hands and forearms as Green's lower chest is the point of contact.  Yes, the helmets made contact, as you can hear, but that does not automatically earn a flag.  It's about initiation:   Rule 5.4.1   A player shall not initiate contact to an opponent's head or neck with a cross-check, or with any part of his body (head, elbow, shoulder, etc.). Any follow-through that contacts the head or neck shall also be considered a violation of this rule.   Rule 5.4.3   A player, including an offensive player in possession of the ball, shall not block an opponent with the head or initiate contact with the head (known as spearing).   So, I don't see how we can flag him for any of this.  In the front, not with the crosse (not cross-checking) and contact with the head was secondary and not where the hit initiated.   In conclusion, I don't see a flag here.  It's certainly borderline and if this player had been playing reckless and dangerously, I would consider penalizing him to send a message to settle down.  I could see a 1 min Unnecessary Roughness or 1 min Illegal Body-Check.  Anything more would be excessive unless there have been other major issue throughout the game.  No hit occurs in a vacuum and it's important to understand the context.  But going off of purely this clip, I am saying no flag."
lacrosse,39873p,theanuranking,5,Wed Jun 10 17:57:38 2015 UTC,"I've got no flag on this.  It's definitely not late.  From this angle, there is not enough evidence of spearing.  He doesn't seem to be purposely leading with the head, if he did at all, but then again, the other side of the field would be better able to tell.  Both hands are on his crosse.  He doesn't use the portion between his hands to initiate the check.  I'm not sure why so many are bent out of shape on this."
lacrosse,39873p,MrWermHatsWormHat,3,Wed Jun 10 19:09:26 2015 UTC,"Great post, thanks for coming in with facts instead of ""oohhhh, but it sounded so bad and the footwork!""   contact with the head was secondary and not where the hit initiated.    That is also missing from a lot of these responses. Just because the helmets touch doesn't mean it's ""head to head contact"" as the rules outline.  I'll repost my gif of the hit here for people to look at without having to go back to the video."

lacrosse,39873p,VexAndSilence,6,Wed Jun 10 01:46:28 2015 UTC,"Out of the 250 youth lacrosse games I have watched over the past few years this hit gets flagged maybe 1 out of 20.  I am sure technically you could call it illegal because he does lower his shoulders and it does sound like there might be helmet to helmet contact, but overall this is a legal, though not very elegant, hit on a shooter."
lacrosse,39873p,jlarrison,-1,Wed Jun 10 15:51:22 2015 UTC,My counter to that is that it is just as much possible it isn't called because of the lack of experience on the part of a lot of the referees.  Inconsistency among the refs knowing the rules is a common problem in our area.
lacrosse,39873p,LaTuFu,5,Wed Jun 10 17:41:43 2015 UTC,"I find that often times this will get called, and incorrectly, because of inexperience.  Often times newer officials will flag things because it ""looks bad."" I usually have them pick up their flags."

lacrosse,39873p,TheBrockGage,7,Tue Jun 9 23:42:23 2015 UTC,Agreed. This is an absolutely legal hit.  I'm assuming its in the U.S.A or England and that's why everyone is so upset about it.
lacrosse,39873p,rodionbonaparte,-1,Wed Jun 10 02:17:32 2015 UTC,Leading with the head is not legal.
lacrosse,39873p,LaTuFu,5,Wed Jun 10 10:34:08 2015 UTC,He doesn't lead with the head. He leans into a much smaller player. The alternative would have been a hit to the head.
lacrosse,39873p,rodionbonaparte,-3,Wed Jun 10 16:26:07 2015 UTC,"I think you need to watch it again.  He lowers his shoulder and drops his head down as he makes contact.  His body is already leaning in.  The combination of these moves puts his head in the leading position going in, instead of his shoulders.  You can clearly hear the sound of their helmets make contact as a result.  The offensive player grabs his helmet lying on the ground.  It doesn't get much more clear than that."

lacrosse,39873p,concussed_cowboy,12,Wed Jun 10 16:07:05 2015 UTC,"As a ref I have to say there is nothing legal about this at all, except for the fact that it's not in the back....  Well to start off with, before we even dive into any rules, that's absolutely terrible defense. He is very clearly just looking for the hit. You can see he is incredibly choked up on his stick, implying that he's not even trying to freaking play defense, just hit.  Secondly, he lowers his shoulder into it, which is something you never do. Even though its just a small dip, its still quite noticeable, and very dangerous. Please keep the football hits in football.   Thirdly as a result of lowering his shoulder into it, he starts to lead with his head, I'm not sure if that crack you hear is helmet on helmet or not, but that's pushing into some dangerous territory.  Lastly, its kind of late. It's not blatantly late, but you can see the other play has very clearly lost possession of the ball by that point. Which just kind of reinforces my first statement that he's not looking to turnover the ball, he's just looking for the hit.   I know it's very hard to drill into some football player's skulls that defense is a lot different than they are used to, but try and work with him on just staying on the hip, breaking down and getting low. Defense in lacrosse is all just about footwork and deterring your opponent from doing what they want to do, not blowing people up to try and strip the ball.   Most coaches can agree, ""I don't want a highlight reel hit, I want the ball back."""
lacrosse,39873p,PhreshWater,5,Tue Jun 9 23:43:47 2015 UTC,"Hi, I am a US Lacrosse Level 1 certified coach and would like to know where in the USL materials it says that ""defense is just all about footwork""  Quoting from USL's ""Making Proper Contact"":    Head Location: With the eyes and chin of the player initiating contact in an upright and almost vertical position, the head should be located no lower than the shoulder of the opponent.  Hand/Arm Location: Palms are to be wrapped around the shaft and placed vertically in-line with the center of the chest. Proper hand location will place the arms in a 90 deg angle with close proximity to the body.  Stick Location: With the palms wrapped around the shaft and placed vertically in line with the center of the player’s body the stick will also be vertical with the head placed just above the shoulder.  Footwork: Footwork is to be controlled though the entire motion. Feet are positioned at a hip width distance when contact is made and continue to move though the contact to remain in control.   GIF of the hit  Compare to the USL video of youth lacrosse"
lacrosse,39873p,exlaxbros,-4,Wed Jun 10 17:26:23 2015 UTC,"Ok That was a side point of playing defense, you're not even talking about the fact that it was late or lowering the head, which are the bad things I pointed out about it. You even linked something that goes against what you're saying.   ""Feet.... continue to move through the contact to remain in control""   There was no control of the other player about this.   Also HOLY FUCKING SHIT YOU TOOL going around saying ""US LAX LEVEL 1"" when all that is is one fucking clinic, that doesn't make you an expert on anything, don't lead your reasoning with that as if it has anything to do with anything.

One last note: his original post was mostly fine with me.  I disagree on his philosophy of flagging it because it's an unsafe way of playing defense, but I completely understand his point.

That's not an appropriate way to officiate.  I could see you maybe giving this a 1 min UR and you'd really have to sell that to the coach.  You flag when the rules have been broken.  Want to send a message in a game that is getting out of control?  Up the severity.  Give them 2 minutes or lock them in.  But you better be doing it on something illegal.  If not, when the illegal hit comes, you'll have to throw the book at them to keep consistent."
lacrosse,39873p,theanuranking,7,Wed Jun 10 22:13:14 2015 UTC,"It's kinda funny that I had the exact opposite reaction to you while watching it. Just about everything you said, I said the opposite of to myself. Sure that defence wasn't technically sound, but he did a good job given the situation at hand.   He takes a quick shuffle step into the hit, that's it. So he's not sprinting into it looking for a bone crushing football spear tackle. He sees the middy is on full sprint and can't dodge/wants to shoot so he plays the body. The defenders size does all the work. I think it was a good choice to lay the hit vs ""play textbook D and get your hands on his hips to force him outside."" Sometimes you need a hit, for a momentum changer, or to send a message.   He doesn't cross check or push with his arms. He drops his shoulder ever so slightly, but who doesn't on a hit? He keeps his stick in tight as to keep control of it and not get any wild high sticking or dangerous penalties like that. Also with his height advantage he has to crouch a little or else it becomes a shoulder to head hit. The biggest thing to me is that he doesn't run into it. He takes a step to get in front of his man to lay him down, he made the choice to play the body and he played it well and to me safely. Not too aggressively and most of the force comes from the middy running full tilt into him. He fishes the hit in a safe manner, it's just unfortunate that the size match up was so one sided.  I don't think the hit is even close to late. He was committed to the hit before the ball was shot. If you commit to a hit and the ball is thrown after the point of no return, then you finish the hit. If you commit to a hit after the ball has been thrown, then it's a late hit. He was in front of the guy, about to hit him as he was shooting/throwing. That's not a late hit in the rules books I've read.   Also, I don't know what you guys were taught, but I was taught that no shot ever goes unpunished (and I learned that lesson because I play offence...). He's committing to that hit because he wants that kid to hesitate next time he thinks about shooting or dodging through traffic. He wants him to expect that slide, and be scared of it. Like it or not, those mind games are a part of lacrosse.   I didn't play lacrosse with any football players growing up and we seen hits like this all the time. Granted this is box and field lacrosse in Canada that I experienced, where the rules and the helicopter parents are a little different. He didn't look like your stereo typical big football bruit looking to lay the hurt down to me. But as I said, it's interesting how we had such polar opposite narratives when watching that hit. Not saying you or I are 100% right or wrong, that's what I think is so interesting about it, because I'm sure the reality of it lays somewhere in the middle because we have no context of the history of these teams or players from this video."
lacrosse,39873p,henerydods,5,Wed Jun 10 09:30:24 2015 UTC,"I had the same reaction as you. I went back and counted, and he's less than 2 steps away when the middie gives up the ball, so it's really not late. When making contact, you only have 3 options for bodypart that you contact from. Head, shoulders, or hands. Hands you're in bad defensive position lunging out and you might get called for a crosscheck, it's also not going to have any effect on the offender. Head is a no go, so it's gotta be shoulders.  Add to this that it looked like he was the slide guy and that makes it a decent hit given the circumstance. Defender #1 got burned with shit positioning, so the slide guy comes in from the crease and that's exactly what is supposed to happen.  Ugh the guy above is one of these refs   Defense in lacrosse is all just about footwork   Lame. Let's just play girls lacrosse then."
lacrosse,39873p,exlaxbros,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:11:11 2015 UTC,"Lame. Let's just play girls lacrosse then.   Nobody is saying you can't hit.  Good footwork=solid, clean hits that don't involve the head."

lacrosse,39873p,exlaxbros,-5,Wed Jun 10 17:42:21 2015 UTC,"Are you serious...?   I've already elaborated the points on the lateness of the hit and the lowering of the body which we seem to disagree with, which is fine because a lot of it IS up to personal interpretation of if it was enough or not.  That being said....  Punshing the offense? No shot ever goes unpunished? That's an awful rule of thumb to follow. Maybe something along the lines of ""no shot goes uncontested"" but purposefully trying to hit someone harder than necessary to dislodge the ball or deter them is awful practice. That's like giving someone a black eye so they hesitate walking through your neighborhood again.   Necessary force is force needed to dislodge the ball, anything further is unnecessary, and also unsafe."
lacrosse,39873p,PhreshWater,3,Wed Jun 10 21:47:01 2015 UTC,"Well the whole black eye concept is the thing. If attack men get hit they will be more hesitant, but that's me"
lacrosse,39873p,dmcmd81,2,Wed Jun 10 22:05:54 2015 UTC,"Dude, why so bitter? It's just a discussion about a hit with Internet strangers, take it easy.   This is lacrosse man, hits are a part of the game an always have been. This isn't even a particularly excessive amount of force. And how do you know the necessary amount of force to dislodge the ball? I have seen guys get smoked way harder than this, yet they still hold onto the ball. Also sometimes defence isn't about dislodging the ball, it's about disrupting the play, which a hit like this accomplishes.   Also you take my expression of no shot goes unpunished to an extreme man. It doesn't mean that every shot a guy takes he should be hit as hard as humanly possible. It means that you don't give away freebies, weather that means a hit, or a check.   And of course you want them to be scared. You ever watch playoff hockey? They don't finish their checks because thats how you play technically sound defence, they finish their checks because they want you to hesitate next time you think about going into the corner to fight for a loose puck. I want the goalie to be scared of my shot, I want the defence to be scared of my pick and roll game. It's one way to force errors and it literally happens ever game.   Also people give other people much worse than black eyes to deters them from coming around every single day, haha."

lacrosse,39873p,theanuranking,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:04:49 2015 UTC,"Sorry that was rude   Its just frustrating because my league makes us wear all this protective gear i.e. helmets, arm pads, chest protectors, and we don't ever get any utility out of them.  Every fucking hit is a flag and its like ""wtf is point of me wearing all this gear if were basically playing womens rules""  Like at least allow me to take my arm and shoulder pads off if were playing lacrosse like a pillow fight.  I wish it were more like hockey.  Where people just suck it up and play for the sake of the game."
lacrosse,39873p,Passatpanther,2,Thu Jun 11 14:08:55 2015 UTC,"First things first get #52 some extra time on running with his man instead of letting him run right past him, but no that was not a legal hit."
lacrosse,39873p,XleaDrof,2,Wed Jun 10 03:12:51 2015 UTC,Well did the ref call it or not
lacrosse,39873p,concussed_cowboy,3,Wed Jun 10 05:11:13 2015 UTC,Yeah for obvious reasons that is terrible defense and it was bit late but I would never call that as ref. That age group looks like they're in hs. You can't clean people out but light body checking like that is allowed. Where I play (eastern ma) they wouldn't call that.

Bad defense for sure on defender #1 taking a poor angle."

lacrosse,39873p,EddyJ87,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:56:26 2015 UTC,I should've read your comment before posting mine. Agree completely. This is an engaging problem
lacrosse,39873p,Marconan,-1,Wed Jun 10 14:00:08 2015 UTC,I agree penalty but that's because it looks and sounds helmet to helmet
lacrosse,39873p,Gedzfew,0,Wed Jun 10 11:18:19 2015 UTC,If it looks and sounds helmet to helmet that is probably helmet to helmet and a penalty.
lacrosse,39873p,theanuranking,2,Wed Jun 10 11:42:31 2015 UTC,This is really not a good rule of thumb to go by.  That noise can be caused by lots of different kinds of contact.  Plus just because the helmets make contact does not mean it's a penalty.  The hit has to be initiated at or by the head/neck for it to fall into that category.  You can initiate contact in the chest and have the helmets collide and that's a legal hit.
lacrosse,39873p,Gedzfew,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:07:01 2015 UTC,"Thus why I said probably helmet to helmet, and from what this hit looks like its a shoulder to a head."

lacrosse,39873p,EddyJ87,-1,Wed Jun 10 14:38:16 2015 UTC,"Ah, so you know him. I thought the hit was trash but it's part of the game. He could've stepped up field and extended his hands and stick to force the middle outside. Given the first defender gets destroyed as well, I think the D may have a problem breaking down and engaging the offense. Consider this for those who are saying ""given the situation"", what's the situation? The middie is movin quickly? Welcome to decent ball, where things happen fast. High level Defenders don't resort to body checks because they get toasted when they do. You will almost never see them lower their shoulder and take their line of site out of play."

lacrosse,39873p,TheJonosaurusRex,4,Wed Jun 10 02:05:31 2015 UTC,Legal Hits =/= Solid Defense
lacrosse,39873p,duncanmb,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:38:44 2015 UTC,"The wretched defense is actually my biggest issue.  He doesn't look to force the offensive player to make a decision, or dictate any sort of field position to him.  He stands there like a tree, watching the play happen then throws a questionable body check after the play has passed him by.  If he'd laid the kid out before he released the ball, I'd feel differently, but any time you hit someone on the outside after they've gotten rid of the ball, you're only hurting your team."
lacrosse,39873p,Marconan,0,Wed Jun 10 14:06:32 2015 UTC,Thank you all. Sounds like it was definitely leaning towards the negative. Will continue to work to keep him representing this awesome sport for the positive!
lacrosse,39873p,Musclesjones,3,Wed Jun 10 00:36:46 2015 UTC,"Dude, it was a legal hit, just consult a rulebook, although how tight refs call games can be found out in about 5 minutes of play, when you think you have a decent idea of how the ref is calling it, tell your players. I've had games where if you knock a guy down legally they'll call it a foul, but also games where you can do literally anything you want. I don't think from the angle he hit the head, but I could be wrong, also not quite a late hit."
lacrosse,39873p,dmcmd81,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:14:38 2015 UTC,Where we disagree is the head contact. If there was none I would agree that the timing was fine and it wasn't from the back. However I do think it was helmet to helmet which is an automatic penalty. It's especially hard when a tall guy slides to a short guy but we all have to adjust.
lacrosse,39873p,duncanmb,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:26:07 2015 UTC,"I didn't see any head to head contact, but if it was head to head it is a penalty."

lacrosse,39873p,Marconan,2,Wed Jun 10 04:59:18 2015 UTC,So mean 😂😂
lacrosse,39873p,LaTuFu,-1,Wed Jun 10 22:15:08 2015 UTC,"It's a bad hit and a late hit at the wrong time, and shows a major lack of fundamentals.  He never stepped up to challenge the all carrier, so all he did by delivering that hit was draw himself away from the fast break, leaving his teammates hanging.  If he's going to body someone, he needs to keep his head up, drop his center of gravity a lot, and get there a lot sooner.  Aside from it being a dirty hit, my big issue is that it didn't actually help his team since he wasn't able to actually separate the other kid from the ball."
lacrosse,39873p,concussed_cowboy,-2,Wed Jun 10 00:50:26 2015 UTC,"I can't really say it much better than /u/PhreshWater.   As a coach, if it were my player that got hit, I'd be pushing for a USC NR. He made no attempt to play defense, he just went for the takeout check, leading with his head.   If it was my kid playing like that, I'd take the D pole out of his hand and make him play with a shorty until he figured out the Golden Rule of feet first, stick second. For every situation like this where he managed to lay some kid out, I'm willing to bet there are a dozen that looked like the first defender in the clip. Bad feet and body position which leads to watching the back of the kid's Jersey as he dodges by."
lacrosse,39873p,LaTuFu,2,Wed Jun 10 02:23:06 2015 UTC,Disagree in this situation. My big problem is leading with the head. I find it especially hard to teach taller guys to keep good form when sliding with body to a smaller player. Kid needs to bend his knees and get his head to the side so the contact is shoulder to shoulder. It will still ground the offensive player but is safer for both parties.  You aren't getting a USC there unless lacrosse is new to your area. IBC or UR but should still be 2min NR.
lacrosse,39873p,concussed_cowboy,2,Wed Jun 10 11:23:39 2015 UTC,"I should have paid more attention to what I was writing, instead of typing quickly on my phone.  In my head I was thinking illegal body check, my fingers swyped USC and I didn't think twice about it.    You and I definitely agree with the problem of the hit."
lacrosse,39873p,LaTuFu,3,Wed Jun 10 12:10:39 2015 UTC,Way over reacting. Never left his feet and wasn't to the head. Say what you will about his defensive technique but that was a good hard slide to the body.
lacrosse,39873p,concussed_cowboy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:09:53 2015 UTC,"He doesn't leave his feet, but he leads with his head. Not legal.   You're right, the offensive player will learn how to move past that."
lacrosse,39873p,LaTuFu,2,Wed Jun 10 10:40:41 2015 UTC,His head never makes contact with any part of his opponent
lacrosse,39873p,concussed_cowboy,0,Wed Jun 10 14:34:25 2015 UTC,"I think you need to watch it again.  He lowers his shoulder and drops his head down as he makes contact.  His body is already leaning in.  The combination of these moves puts his head in the leading position going in, instead of his shoulders.  You can clearly hear the sound of their helmets make contact as a result.  The offensive player grabs his helmet lying on the ground.  It doesn't get much more clear than that."
lacrosse,39873p,LaTuFu,2,Wed Jun 10 17:30:42 2015 UTC,Nah man. You clearly see him lower his shoulder
lacrosse,39873p,concussed_cowboy,0,Wed Jun 10 18:17:54 2015 UTC,"Yep.  And his head, which makes contact first, with the opponent's helmet."
lacrosse,39873p,the_cleve_believes,2,Wed Jun 10 18:51:47 2015 UTC,Considering his opponent is a head shorter than him.. No. Obviously you don't watch hockey or football. When you deliver a hit your shoulder you lower yourself. Watch the video my man. Hits with his shoulder. legal clean hit.  Probably shouldn't be making calls with your eyes closed.
lacrosse,39873p,LaTuFu,-2,Wed Jun 10 18:54:39 2015 UTC,"Ahh, the old ""I have to be a douche bag when I know I'm wrong"" guy.  No need to be a dick because you don't agree.  The kid made a hit with his head.  Plain and simple.  You don't agree?  Not my problem.  Just don't be that guy."
lacrosse,39873p,Justin12334,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:10:40 2015 UTC,"Yup, I'm being that guy... Look at yourself man.   The kid did not make contact with his head, so yeah there's that. Just don't be that ref."
lacrosse,39873p,harroldhino,2,Wed Jun 10 19:33:40 2015 UTC,"He didn't leave his feet and he didn't make contact with the head, I say legal. That offensive player will learn to dodge past a kid like that."
lacrosse,39873p,LaTuFu,2,Wed Jun 10 04:33:03 2015 UTC,"He lead with his head, and he made contact with the offensive player's head. You can hear their helmets collide in the video. That's an automatic call at almost any level, but especially at the youth levels."
lacrosse,39873p,LaTuFu,0,Wed Jun 10 10:37:40 2015 UTC,But did he score?
lacrosse,39873p,smilli02,-2,Wed Jun 10 00:15:18 2015 UTC,I can't even wrap my head around how bad the black team probably is.
lacrosse,39873p,theanuranking,-4,Wed Jun 10 12:00:05 2015 UTC,"Should be legal because it is not too blatantly after the play and he didn't hit in the back. That being said, it is horrible technique and the pussy refs of today will call that a lot."
lacrosse,39873p,concussed_cowboy,-1,Wed Jun 10 04:11:00 2015 UTC,Because leading with the head is not legal in any sport any more. At least not in the US.

They won their sectional games by 22, 9, and 17 (Champ) and now win their state opener by 17.  And it's not because they are THAT elite, the competition has just been garbage.  I'm gonna go to the games tomorrow.  I've seen all 4 and this is a really good quartet (only missing Prior Lake, who was unfortunate to be in BJ's section).

lacrosse,396t27,exlaxbros,4,Tue Jun 9 17:49:32 2015 UTC,"Agility, for sure.  I would recommend something that would work regardless of what sport you play: jog and sprint up every hill you come across to get the feeling of the game. It works for soccer, it works for rugby, basically, it works for any game that does not stop that often (lacrosse would definitely be one, especially field). As well, staying active and warm, even during the off season, helps prevent the shitty feeling you get if you don't stay active during the off season. Plus, you don't get as balls tired during a game as you would if you didn't focus on agility.  Anyways, my two cents, hope it helps.  EDIT: I'd drop some hand-eye in there too."

lacrosse,396t27,LaTuFu,2,Tue Jun 9 20:48:48 2015 UTC,"As a youth coach, my biggest recommend is don't let them specialize.  I think specialization is killing youth sports today.  We're teaching kids that its a job when they're 7.  This is supposed to be fun.    Give them a basic diet/nutrition plan to follow, and general fitness goals to maintain during the summer.  (Basic goal of running 4-6 miles 4x week, core workouts they can do without weights, pullups/pushups, etc.  A package of things they can do in an hour a day in addition to a run at home with little or no equipment.)  For the kids who show signs of dedication/work ethic, give them more focused attention and goals.  A more prescribed workout program.  Those kids might have access to a family gym membership, take advantage of that.  After that, make sure you encourage them to play other sports in the fall.  If they don't want to play soccer or football, have them run cross country.  If they don't play basketball/hockey in the winter, encourage them to wrestle.  Our best faceoff guys are our wrestlers.  The workout and practice routine they'll have in wrestling will help their core strength and flexibility a lot.  Oh yeah, and wall ball.  Can't do enough wall ball.  The kids with good sticks should be doing 30 min a day on the wall, emphasizing their off hand, working both.  The developing kids should spend 30 min a day working both hands.    I really like /u/benches48's suggestion about hill running, too.  I'm gonna steal that one."
lacrosse,396t27,LaTuFu,2,Wed Jun 10 12:22:08 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. I would never even use the word ""diet"" with youths, it's all healthy eating and stuff. Even with my HS guys, unless there's a guy who is way overweight, I'm not telling them anything besides limit fast food and soda, eat plenty of meat and vegetables. If there is a guy way overweight, I'm referring it out."
lacrosse,396t27,Oggdogg87,2,Wed Jun 10 15:11:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed, diet is a poor choice of words given the potential negative way it is heard.  In the context of what I'm suggesting, its not calorie counting or weight loss, but rather paying attention to what those calories are, i.e. healthy fats, lean proteins, higher percentage of calories from protein and fats than carbs, etc.  Avoid sugar, processed foods, junk food, sodas, etc.  Overall focus on good nutrition and healthy eating.  If you can get them to buy into that kind of eating, you'll be suprised at how much weight loss you don't have to refer out.  It'll just happen as a result of making better food choices."

In some positions you will need to push them at their hips to knock them off their course, and others you may just need to run with them and get on their hands. The best way to learn is by watching college and pro games and seeing how the defensemen line up and react and then try to emulate them in your play. It's all about practice, but seeing what you should be doing is crucial. So my advise to you is to just watch a lot of lacrosse. Here's a couple clips to get you started bud.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA66O8Mn9X8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trY0DowmSmU"
lacrosse,393xea,head_space_cadet,4,Tue Jun 9 03:13:56 2015 UTC,I'm experienced but this is a great refresher after a huge brain fart. Thanks
lacrosse,393xea,benches48,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:39:02 2015 UTC,"Also, if you can keep up with your attacker, try ""boxing"" him out, forcing him to either make a bad run or a bad pass. This both lowers his chances of breaking through you and up's your chances of either getting possession back or absolutely mauling the guy.  Even though I've only played defence once or twice, and that was when I was first learning how to play, I can say that having a strong physical side is just as important as being able to catch up and phase an attacker out (me being ~5""3, 110-ish pounds when I first started playing, I wasn't the best at defence).  Hope this helps!"
lacrosse,393xea,KlondikeChill,5,Wed Jun 10 01:34:47 2015 UTC,"The best way is to just lance your attackman's ankles. Just hurl your stick 300 style right when your enemy is making it's break. The back of the knees is also an acceptably effective target. As soon as the bone snaps, you can remove the ball from his stick for your personal stats and his scalp from his head for your personal collection."

lacrosse,393xea,dj_bpayne,2,Fri Jun 12 01:47:42 2015 UTC,"What dodges are you having the most problem with? What side of the field? Are you lefty or righty normally? What defense are you playing, with what kind of slide packages?"
lacrosse,393xea,dj_bpayne,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:19:50 2015 UTC,"Textbook slides, crease with creaseman and two coming from 2nd. creaseman(if there) and backside adjacent.   Im having trouble defending the wing. This is a recent problem now that summer ball is starting because my team is better than my HS team. I often allow top side from the low wing."
lacrosse,393xea,pirates1868,5,Tue Jun 9 03:31:49 2015 UTC,"Talk with your teammates and have a couple of different verbal cues that basically mean 'he's getting me on an island, i might need help'. Your teammates will be 1 step closer to sliding, and you can work on just keeping your feet under you and harassing. Plus the mental aspect of knowing your teammates have your back could give you a boost in takeaways. Work on getting him to X and put in a coma slide. Next time the player dodges he'll be looking to pull out when he sees that pole coming for his head.   How's your V hold? Work on some forearm and wrist strength exercises so you can v hold for like 2 seconds and then turn him and poke. If they roll inside, ride their back hip and guide them gently until you can introduce them to the dirt of the crease. Don't go for a takeaway check if they roll inside, if they tuck their stick you're 2 steps behind and it's already over.   Also, not sure how your coach wants you to be playing, but if the guy you're guarding at practice is a stud and wants some game scenario work, completely lock him off off-ball."
lacrosse,393xea,duncanmb,3,Tue Jun 9 03:39:38 2015 UTC,If someone is rolling around GLE towards goal and you have to slide from the crease.. HIT THEM! I preach to my players to use their body daily. If it's not an appropriate situation to body the attackman up than get on his hips and drive him away from the goal
lacrosse,393xea,Gradyr121,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:51:24 2015 UTC,"Get comfortable with how fast the rest of your line is and how well they slide and rotate behind you.  If you're really confident in them, overplay your man to the high side.  Giving up the low roll is head and shoulders better than getting beaten to the high side so focus on staying high and keeping your stick on his hands to make him turn back towards GLE to shoot or feed.  If he's looking to move from the wing, he's probably also looking to get inside your stick and into your body where he can slip a quick feed in, so you need to maintain your separation.  Meet him, drive him out, and get back on his hands.     Keep lifting.  Playing close D is extremely physical and your time under a bench press bar and in the squat rack will not only give you more control when you're trying to re-establish separation.  It'll also help stave off the injuries that come from using your body as a blunt object to bludgeon other players.  When you're off the field, talk to your teammates.  The attackmen will benefit tremendously from understanding your decision making loop just like knowing theirs will help you.  Find out where he'd press an advantage and where he wouldn't, and why.  Take some time outside practice, swap sticks with an attackman, and do some one on one work.  Odds are, he'll hack the snot out of you, but spending a little more time seeing the game from the other side always helps build a sense of the big picture."

lacrosse,393syp,hoopiedont,4,Tue Jun 9 01:36:39 2015 UTC,"1) Jr. A is top level lacrosse and comparable to Div 1 in the US. Jr. B has quite a few more teams in more communities, usually this is because of money, but it is still some very good lacrosse. Jr. C is (at times) not much better than intermediate (which is kind of a competitive feeder league for Jr with the same age restrictions).   2) No. In most places you pay to play, even if its relatively small, like buying your own helmet/gloves to match the team or to tryout. Though my knowledge of that is based on the Jr. B level.   3) Not that I really know of. The Ontario league bleeds into Quebec a little bit in places (Kahnawake for example) which kind of shows that there isn't anything comparable in Quebec, which is where I would assume such a league would be. Other than that though, there is a Sr (mens) league in Ontario that is also a very high level of lacrosse.  4) I would say that the game has grown in spurts. Being from the Ottawa area, I have many friends that only started playing because they went to an NLL game, when we had a team. Since then, I'd say it's been growing but not particularly fast. That being said, the game is much more popular in southern Ontario where the game has continued to grow for many years now.  5) Attendance really varies from community to community. Once again, being from Ottawa, games usually have anywhere between 40-80 people. But in lacrosse focused communities like, say, Orangeville, they can be packed to the rafters.   Hope that answers your questions!"
lacrosse,393syp,Parnio,2,Tue Jun 9 04:04:52 2015 UTC,Alberta has had Junior A since the 90's and has competed in minto every year.
lacrosse,393syp,Tron22,1 point,Tue Jun 9 07:16:32 2015 UTC,Most provinces now have competitive leagues (mostly considered Jr. B) but are still not at the same level as their peirs in Ontario and BC
lacrosse,393syp,laxlife5,2,Tue Jun 9 08:27:46 2015 UTC,"I agree, most provinces now have competitive B leagues.  But talking A ball, you put either Calgary team in either league and they'll be competing for the top.  Every year they're losing to either league winners by a goal.  Look at Dan Taylor, a product of the mounties, nothing to scoff at."
lacrosse,393syp,Tron22,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:56:42 2015 UTC,"Yup, Jr.A in Alberta is pretty damn close to the Ontario and bc boys now, I wouldn't be surprised if they win a minto in the next couple of years. I play Sr.B here now myself and there is some very good talent in the jr.A league here. Calgary winter and elev8 have done a great job of putting Calgary on the map of producing great lacrosse talent. Were also hosting the founders cup and the female box nationals this year.   I'm told by my few Ontario friends who play here with me that our jr.b isn't at the same level of depth as ontarios though, which is fair giving the number of players they have compared to us. We will see at this years founders though."

lacrosse,393syp,ionlyjunglena,2,Fri Jun 26 00:54:29 2015 UTC,"We have what's called a draft. If you're a really good midget aged player (14-16 iirc) just aging out of minor lacrosse you are automatically put into this draft, no matter how good or bad you are. Then a Jr.A draft happens where, if you're really good, you get drafted to whichever team happens to pick you. If you get drafted by a team in Jr.A you must play for that team unless you are traded, they have your rights and can do with you as they please. This means you might get drafted by them, but never actually make the full team. This sucks, but it happens. If the draft is over and you don't get picked you have the right to play for any team you want and they all usually have an open tryout of some sort. If you don't make Jr.A you can then go play for any Jr.B or Jr.C team you want, but it's usually the closest one to home. As soon as you play for a Jr.B or Jr.C team though, they have your rights and you need to be ""released"" to play for any other team (with the exception of a Jr.B player getting called up to Jr.A)  This sounds bad, like the teams own you, but you have to remember that the lacrosse community in Canada is pretty small and very friendly. If you want to go play for another team it usually only takes a quick and simple talk with your coach/team manager. These rules are like this so we can spread out the top top talent around the league so you don't end up with one crazy dominant team and a bunch of stupid politics like buying your way into that team or something.   To touch a bit on the part where ""where do you live if you play on a team in a different town."" While it does happen, it's pretty rare. You can get drafted to a team not in your home town, but most teams aren't going to draft you to get billeted in a town a few hours away from home unless you are really worth it. So coaches in the draft will pick top talent first (the guys worth the trouble), then top ""area"" talent where you're only an hour or so drive from home so you don't need to billet, then top home talent. Sometimes home talent gets picked over area talent because it's easier to deal with rather than someone who lives an hour away and has to drive in for every practice.   Sometimes a guy will get drafted by a team and say ""I'm not playing there, it's too far from home."" And will play a year of Jr.B before getting traded the next year, but that's pretty rare too.   I'm pretty old now, but as far as I know everyone pays to play. Pretty sure even the Jr.A guy are paying, but I was never good enough to make Jr.A growing up so what do I know there. I know our JR.B guys were paying.   Alberta has some very good lacrosse in Calgary, Edmonton, and Lethbridge. Saskatoon used to have a Jr.A team that played in the Alberta Jr.A system, but I'm pretty sure they along with Winnipeg play in the Alberta Jr.B system now. I'm not 100% versed on how ""Jr.A"" works in those provinces, but they aren't on Alberta's Jr.A level any more as Alberta stepped up their game a lot in the last few years.   Everything else has been touched on very well by other people already. I can talk about field here though and it's popularity. Field has grown a ton here because kids have started to learn that they can be a valuable asset to an American college lacrosse team. With more and more Canadians getting recruited to go play in the states I have seen more and more kids playing field and trying to get recruited. It's cool to see a small change in the eyes of our community. When I was growing up field lacrosse was not really played. We would mess around with it in the summer, but it was never taken seriously. A few guys would go to the states and we always thought it was cool when they did, but nobody really put in a ton of effort to get recruited, it usually happened through a friend you played with growing up, or their older brother who went to that university and told the coach about you ripping it up in box back home. Now that more and more Canadians are getting recruited it's seen in a whole different light. Guys want to get scholarships to go down, they are practicing dodging against a long poll, or even better yet using said long pole. You're still missing out on a lot of talented Canadians who can't afford to go down south without a full ride, we're still considered international students after all and that means tuition is even more expensive than your already ridiculously high tuition rates. $10,000-$15,000 a year gets me an engineering degree in the best universities in Canada. Now maybe I'm good enough to make the team but not good enough for a big scholarship, what do I do? Do I go to the states and pay a bunch of tuition just to play lacrosse and end up with the same degree, but end up with hundreds of thousands in debt? I could hope for academic scholarships too, but for a lot of Canadian lacrosse players that very difficult because those scholarships usually go to Americans first.   Anyway I've just destroyed your thread with a huge wall of text, sorry about that. Hopefully you enjoy reading it, if not then oh well. I can talk about Canadian and American lacrosse and their strengths and weaknesses for days. I love this topic. I'm one of those guys that thinks you guys use your off hands TOO much. I bet you've never heard that before.   Tldr;   If your really really good you get drafted and play where you got drafted to, otherwise you play where ever you like, or in my case where ever you can make a team, haha.   You don't usually play far from home but if you're really really good you might have to and you get billeted or live with an aunt and uncle.   Everyone pays to play usually.   Alberta is on the same level as BC and Ontario now when looking at Jr.A, Sask. and Manitoba are ok, and will get there eventually I'm sure.   Canadians playing field."

lacrosse,393syp,tilldeathdoiparty,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:14:18 2015 UTC,"Same as what /u/Parnio said For the different levels of play. You usually play for your hometown team for Jr B and Jr C. For Jr A some players play for their hometown teams if they have one, others play for the team they got drafted for. Those who play for a team  that's not in their hometown are usually billeted. No. The team fees for my Jr B team are ~$400 and this includes a team helmet. Shorts and jerseys are provided before each game. There are however the two most competitive are Ontario and BC who play in the Minto Cup to decide the national champion. It's growed steadily however not as rapidly as it has in the US. My Jr B averages about 150 people at a game however Jr A teams like Peterborough and Six Nations can average more than 300 people a game."

lacrosse,394b22,Lax4Evr,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:35:08 2015 UTC,"You're generally going to want to try to take him to his right so that he has to rotate further to keep his stick on your hands.  Take that with a grain of salt though, since every other long pole I know was taught to keep his head pointed up field and playing close D with your off hand has a pretty minimal learning curve."
lacrosse,394b22,duncanmb,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:30:32 2015 UTC,"I play LSM. Sometimes I move down to close, in which I play the left side of your facing the crease. Its easier to keep them at X, because if they try to roll back the stick will keep with them even if you don't, so it gives you room to recover if you mess up."

lacrosse,38x6q9,kidfood,3,Sun Jun 7 16:35:18 2015 UTC,"/u/NamekessElectro1 has some good ones. I would also highly recommend getting a middie/attack to play offense against you while play D without a stick. Really helps you work on your footwork and body position and getting those solid without getting lured into bad positions thinking your extra stick length will bail you out.   That said, it takes active effort to not let all that footwork/body positioning go out the window the second you get the stick back in your hand."
lacrosse,38x6q9,DocCalculus,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:31:51 2015 UTC,"Like I said to /u/NamekessElectro1, I think that how I use my stick is the biggest emphasis that I have. I can keep up with my guy most of the time, but using my stick to defend is difficult for me. I find myself at times wishing I used a short stick instead of a pole for easier defending. Thanks for the suggestions!"
lacrosse,38x6q9,NamelessElectro1,0,Sun Jun 7 20:06:06 2015 UTC,"My coach often made the defenders run a drill where they were only allowed to talk and body check, they had to leave their sticks on the ground. Is that what you mean? (I'm more than willing to learn any drills I could try as well)"

lacrosse,38x6q9,duncanmb,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:19:00 2015 UTC,"We did something similar, though we got foot long sections of handle that we had to keep both hands on.  Nothing forces you to focus on your footwork quite like not having that five foot cushion anymore."
lacrosse,38x6q9,NamelessElectro1,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:22:07 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat except for the fact that I'm an incoming Junior. From what I can tell based on watching defensive players on my team and listening to our defensive coach the biggest things are footwork, communication, and handling your stick. I personally would like to try out for the LSM position next season so it would be my first year playing pole. I've been working on keeping my stick under control and just generally learning to deal with the added length. So what I recommend (and take this with a grain of salt because I could be totally full of shit) is to set up cones and practice moving from point a to point b with your stick in your hand as if you were defending someone. Have a friend play a sort of relaxed offense on you so you can get a feel for checking his stick and keeping up with him and as you get more comfortable have him become more aggressive. Talk to a defender on your team if you can and learn how to communicate especially if you plan on playing close d and if you know who your goalie is going to be and can come into contact with him that would probably be another great asset because if you don't play good defense then he's going to go through hell. See if you can get your pokes, slaps and lifts down really well before the start of the season and run as much as possible (you don't dictate the speed on defense, the person you're guarding does) Lastly check Youtube, even if you can't find specific tutorials just watching people play can be such a big help! You don't have to be all flashy like you're in the MLL, just having your basics down is all you really need to keep an aggressive offender covered! I hope this helped some, and if not I'm sorry for wasting your time haha!  Edit: Just so people don't think I'm pulling all of this out of my ass, last season I was an offensive middy who was caught back on defense quite a bit and I let a few goals go because I wasn't experienced enough. It pissed me off to no end so after those experiences I tried to rectify the situation by talking to my defensive coach, and getting as many tips as possible from the veterans on my team."
lacrosse,38x6q9,NamelessElectro1,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:10:20 2015 UTC,"This has definitely helped and I feel like the problem I have is not my footwork, but what I do with my stick. I think I can usually keep up with my guy and get in front of him, but my stick is kind of a nuisance for me so I need to get used to the extra length. Plus, my last stick I borrowed from my friend and there was tape all over it so it was VERY difficult to poke check."

Also getting used to the extra length is just something to get used to, I've been working at it for a few months and it's become much easier!"
lacrosse,38x6q9,duncanmb,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:07:26 2015 UTC,"For better footwork, I'd suggest doing side shuffles on a treadmill.  Do the shuffles on low speeds or whatever you're comfortable with.  I'd recommend doing this in private as you might look stupid.  Also this might not be the safest thing but I haven't gotten hurt so just use caution."

lacrosse,38y1ae,smilli02,3,Sun Jun 7 21:46:06 2015 UTC,Club teams are generally better teams because they only take the best players they can get. Your sons development will really depend on his coach and there's no way know which would be better just base on club vs rec league. At the end of the day he's 9; just have him play on the team where he has more friends and would have more fun.
lacrosse,38y1ae,NewYorkerinGeorgia,3,Sun Jun 7 22:20:49 2015 UTC,"We have a club ""all star"" team near me in that age group. They pull together the best players from local feeder teams and stomp regular feeder teams like mine. Interestingly, their coaches all also coach one of the feeder teams, and we swept those teams this year. So is that team better because of the coaching, or the players they pull together?  It's not hard to figure out, but parents pay $1200 for their kid to be on that team because they see a team doing so well that they just assume that the caliber of coaching must be high. It is not. It's a money making scam.  We have a different strategy in our program.  In our program, we value relationships. We want our boys to be friends on and off the field. We do that so that they will keep playing together. Not only will they have more success than they would by splitting up, but the value of sports is not measured in trophies. It's the personal growth, accomplishment, relationships and memories we make together that matter most. That's the real value. So in my program, we would say that taking him away from his friends to improve his play is short sighted. And since I developed those values in our program, I agree with them. :-)"

Also, the hit where he lays his shoulder into the kid looking the other way was really high... And then he gets up and cross checks yet another kid.

He uses his hands to apply leverage while they're on his stick...better I've seen anyone do it at his age. I'm glad the refs aren't throwing flags for it, because that's how it's done.  Switching hands to play D? Not a great idea, for a multitude of reasons.  Switching hands while clearing? Maybe, but even that's a stretch. Drive up to Albany 2 years ago and tell the Thompsons that they need to switch hands more. The point I'm making is this: if you can do it right with one hand, why does it matter?"

When an attacker gets a half step, he legally pushes, as he should, and those aren't cross checks. They are good solid defense, and he does it going both directions with a push and a V. When he body checks, his hands are close enough together that it's not a penalty. I think you all are not being fair on this point.  His stick does need work. Left hand, GB's, and better passes. Also more takeaway checks. That's a fair criticism.  But he plays solid 1v1 defense, can slide, and shows decent positioning. He's a sophomore playing varsity.

lacrosse,38l1qz,wkfink,8,Fri Jun 5 02:06:28 2015 UTC,"Dude, you need more time on video. He only recovers because he's a foot taller than the guys he's guarding. He also has no left hand, can't throw a decent pass (he throws rainbows on a fast break), and his footwork is super poor.  He would be benched on any team I coached for, simply because he's far too aggressive and sloppy.  Source: 21 years of playing, 18 as LSM, 3 as close D.

Checks were decent, mostly on point in turn with an attacker but hes so big I feel he could be dealing heavier checks. Best thing going for him is his speed and his overall height."
lacrosse,38l1qz,wkfink,4,Thu Jun 4 22:48:31 2015 UTC,"His footwork is terrible. Go back and watch again. He was regularly letting attackmen get one or two steps ahead of him, and only recovered because one of his strides is one and a half of theirs.  Great athlete, but he needs to spend way more time checking his aggression and learning the fundamentals of defense."
lacrosse,38l1qz,peebsunz,2,Fri Jun 5 07:32:39 2015 UTC,Was more impressed that he wasn't just slashing away.  He's probably aware that refs love to throw flags against bigger guys and is more technical with his checking.
lacrosse,38l1qz,henerydods,0,Thu Jun 4 23:07:37 2015 UTC,"I agree. I loved his simple and small checks. He was playing a really good body game against guys, textbook body if you ask me. As soon as he starts throwing heavy checks he is going to lose that, those small pestering checks were just perfect. Keeping guys out of good shooting position is 10x more important at the higher levels than hitting their stick with a stick check is, because even if you do it probably won't dislodge the ball."

lacrosse,38l158,goldenprune,7,Thu Jun 4 22:14:07 2015 UTC,"If you are facing someone who keeps getting fast break after fast break and is considerably better than your fogo, then the purpose of having an LSM on the x is solely to stop the fast break. That being said if you have an lsm that is great at face offs, put him there."
lacrosse,38l158,ShnanignFlanign,8,Thu Jun 4 23:11:52 2015 UTC,"This, basically. I was back up face off since I could do it well with a long pole. I didnt always get the ball from the get go, infact I hardly ever did if I wasn't on shorty. The goal isnt necessarily to beat the other guy as LSM face off though, its to make the other guys life a living hell after he wins it. You have a D pole not because youre gonna win and go score, but because youre gonna lose, beat up the other guy, turn over, and settle your offense.  It was a lot of fun. The other guy is about to go balls to the wall to fight you on the ball, you just kinda knock him around, let him get it, be ready to sprint to the ball, and unleash 6 feet of lacrosse whirl wind fury.  All of this completely changes if you always run a LSM face off though. I only went in when we were expecting to not get the face, and needed more time to steal and settle."
lacrosse,38l158,Lebowskii,2,Thu Jun 4 23:51:27 2015 UTC,"I hate having to face off as an LSM. It's just tougher with a pole.  I was always there because I was fast (every LSM should be if not the fastest, then one of the fastest on their team), and we'd put me on the wing that the other team would try to pull the ball to if they won it clean.  As more teams got talented FOGOs that could win a face-off to themselves, I was there to get in front of them and make them pull up short. You start on the very end of the wing line closest to your goal because you're taking an angle to cut off their FOGO and stop the fast break.  On my current club team, I'm more often than not having to do this because we don't have a good FOGO.  The whole point of having a LSM is to either get the GB, or break up a fast break. If you're in the face-off, it's super tough to do that because when you lose the face-off, you're usually the last one back to your defensive end."
lacrosse,38l158,wkfink,1 point,Fri Jun 5 07:51:48 2015 UTC,"It doesn't make a lot of sense in my mind.  Even if you win cleanly, It's much easier for the opposing middie to tie up your stick while fighting for the ground ball, killing a potential fast break and letting his guys get in to support him.  If the opposing middie is winning the faceoffs cleanly, you've now got a LSM behind him, potentially on his knees, while the middie is leading a fast break.  I think you're better off, if the opposing team is consistently winning them cleanly, having the LSM lining up to your FOGO's left on the wing, and immeditaly breaking towards the hole on the whistle to cut off any potential fast breaks."

lacrosse,38k065,grandmasterfun,4,Thu Jun 4 18:54:21 2015 UTC,Fake and finish.  Goals are earned a bit more in box given the goal and goalie size.  Practice interior finishing like faking high near pipe then shooting low opposite pipe.  Same thing all around the goal.  Look to pull goalies out of position to open up the net.  Getting quick shots after the ball swings from one end  to the other is a great way to catch a goalie out of position.  Basically you need to work on more inside skills.  Quick steps and quick releases.
lacrosse,38k065,popsac,2,Thu Jun 4 20:13:01 2015 UTC,Outside shots and ones from an angle are easily stopped by the goalie because it's all just positioning. The big thing is to get the goalie moving. If you can tell that the goalie goes down a lot you can fake low and put it over him as he drops. It's more about reading the goalie and knowing his weakness than outdoors.   I've played a lot of box and even some goalie and my harder thing to stop in goal was when they got me moving a lot. A lower angle shot that might be easy outdoors was very easy to stop. Cross crease passes or dodges across the middle were a bit harder.
lacrosse,38k065,blu333,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:50:49 2015 UTC,"Get some time in playing wall ball, follow through with your whole body on shots, don't play with a ridiculous amount of whip in your pocket, and take the extra step to the middle of the field. Make sure your hips are rotating through your shots and don't keep your elbows too tight to your ribs.   Without more detail on how you're missing, hard to give advice. Also helps to aim better. ;-)  Focus on the fundamentals - the back of the net will follow. There is no substitute for putting in work."
lacrosse,38k065,beers_gears_sneers,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:14:04 2015 UTC,"Your best chances for scoring on a box goalie are shooting on the post at about hip level. When I shoot I don't aim for corners, I aim for posts. I'll aim high post or low post, but it's almost always to the post.   The biggest key on beating a box goalie for an outside shot is making him move laterally. This means that you shouldn't be moving straight at the goalie or standing still when you shoot. You want to be moving right to left or left to right across the floor some way. This forces him to move with you across his crease. Now you need to watch him and choose one of 2 options.  1: he doesn't move far enough and you beat him to the outside post.   2: he moves to far and you shoot and sneak it past on the inside post.  This is the basics of how you outside shoot on a box goalie, there are some more advance techniques like shooting over his shoulders if he drops and others, but you will score 90% of your goals with that simple strategy of beating him to the far post, or shooting short side. Make him move and react to him.   Inside shooting is the same thing, but you get to make him move with fakes now. Don't over fake. A fake should be quick and concise. The stick doesn't go infront of your head when you fake. Just a quick snap of the wrist and closing of your grip a bit. The reason it needs to be quick is because you need to be able to shoot really quick. Fake far and shoot close side, or fake close side and shoot far. That's how's it's done. Don't fake more than 2 times, and 90% of the time it should be 1 fake and a shot. There isn't the time in box to stand there and fake 3-5 times.   Also if you beat your guy, try not to run straight at the net. Because if you do that you are giving the advantage back to the goalie. Every step you take straight at the goal you are giving up angle. You need to run at an angle some how to force that goalie to move laterally again, thus opening up angle again. Remember, you score on box goalies by making them move side to side, it's very difficult to beat them up/down.   Don't sweat it too much. We had a guy come up here from Texas and it took him about 5 games or so to get his first goal, and he is pretty good at field so it can take some time. It's hard to get used to it, but once you do and you can bring that skill to field you become a whole new beast. Also, masters box is a ton of fun. Good luck man!"
lacrosse,38k065,henerydods,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:51:59 2015 UTC,"As a goalie with 5 years experience (including 4 of those as a box keep in the fall) I have to tell you that your biggest chance at scoring comes from hitting upper corners and getting lucky. It's difficult for many of us keeps to appropriately move our shoulders in the way of a shot, and when we do it's usually too slow for the shot. Every other shooting spot is usually completely or near completely shielded by our pads and your chances of scoring are lower. Faking sometimes works, but the majority of us aren't taught to move much at all/react to shots, rather stay cool and stay big."

lacrosse,38gflq,insertawesomename29,7,Thu Jun 4 01:13:34 2015 UTC,"Traditional is the best thing ever. /u/dirtedan has an arguable point on the hold a pocket can have. It depends on what you want personally. I am able to get a decent amount of hold in my sticks but I also like a decent amount of whip. The reason why I use traditional is because of the unrivaled amount of feel I can get from a pocket. I have tried everything on the market, the only thing that comes close to the feel of a traditional pocket is Stringking 1/2 S mesh, which I use in a back up stick. I think that's the main focus as to why most people use traditional in the game nowadays. It's not because they want to be the one guy on the team that is different, my high schools teammates would joke with me that I was the ""lacrosse hipster"" of the team because I used traditional. People use trad because of the feel. Most people are turned off to traditional because they try to string it themselves, and it becomes a painful mess of self loathing and knotted crosselace. To really understand the full benefits of traditional, I would suggest having a professional string you a pocket and then if you like it, start shelling out the money to practice the art form and pick up tools of the trade from YouTube videos and e-lacrosse forums.Your first pockets are going to be the most ugly thing you will ever see. Practice makes perfect, just like every other skill you've learned in the game. If you want to get into the knitty gritty of learning how to do a proper traditional I suggest checking out SpawnOfPipo's video series called Trad Method Monday. Phil is a trad genius and an all around gnarly dude. Also, as I read this back to myself, I noticed that I sound like an old guy that played his college ball back in the 80's, but I'm a college sophomore and have been using traditional since I was a sophomore in high school.   Edit:Sorry /u/dirtehdan I misspelled your name."
lacrosse,38gflq,Forever_Abomination,2,Thu Jun 4 04:03:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything, but I want to touch on the negatives more. I am a Canadian who mainly plays indoor, and as such I rarely had to deal with the elements. I loved traditional because when you don't have to deal with rain or snow the maintenance levels are much more reasonable. But recently I have been playing more field, and last summer I had the opportunity to go down to Mexico and play there. After that experience I will probably never use trad again, unless it's a for fun pickup game or one of my masters games, and that's after many many years of stringing my own. Outdoor conditions and traditional sticks do not perform at the same level as wax mesh sticks do.   Traditional is great when it's dry and clean. As soon as you add moisture to the equation it becomes a disaster waiting to happen. Way too many field games have I gone from starting with a perfectly throwing pocket, to having to adjust things as fast as I can at half time, only to have it throw terribly again by the end of the game when the pressure is on to perform. You can ""weather proof"" a trady to an extent, but it will never perform in any adverse weather conditions to the extent that wax or rubber mesh will.   You can string a pocket very similarly to a trady pocket pretty easily, and we have been doing it for a long time here in Canada. Americans seem to call it ""the Canadian box pocket"", but it's not that we tailor it to box, we use it for field too. We just use a big mid bag, very similar to what a trady ends up being after break in, 3 or 4 straight shooters to feel the ball roll off of, much the same as trady, and soft mesh because it's the closest thing to trady. Add all that and boom, you've got yourself a trady in mesh form.   I use my mesh pocket for faceoffs, which I could never do with my trady. I use my mesh pocket in the winter to play wall ball, which my trady never enjoyed, I use it in the mud and rain and it throws the same for weeks at a time. After at least 5 years of using a trady for box, as soon as I started playing field I had to give up on it. The maintenance levels on it go through the roof, and even then you cant adjust it mid game if the rain is killing it. Even watching guys like stanwick use his trady, something about his game changes when it rains hard for a game, and I can't play like that.   So as a trady lover who I would say is pretty good at stringing and maintaining trady, even I choose to use mesh. It's just not worth the trouble to me any more. When I was playing only box it was worth it, but now that I play field too it's not even close to worth it for me."
lacrosse,38gflq,henerydods,2,Thu Jun 4 17:28:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you for adding more of the negatives, really, you are absolutely right. Many people on this sub will understand the strain of the weather when living in Maryland, including this week when most high schools are starting summer break and the weather is 60 degrees and raining when last week it was 90 degrees and not a cloud in the sky. Water is the ultimate downfall of traditional and the reason why I always have a back up stick with me. LaxAllStars had a post about ""weather-proofing"" leathers with baby oil, and even though it may help prevent leathers from absorbing as much water as the could, it still isn't perfect.I have had a few rare pockets that I have strung that seem to be absolutely perfect. They could even play in the rain. I can't seem to consciously replicate whatever I did to get it to that point though. The best leathers I've used are StringersShack Beaver Leathers. They are the best (shameless plug). They work well enough against the elements but I also tend to restring my sticks twice a year to keep everything fresh."
lacrosse,38gflq,Forever_Abomination,2,Thu Jun 4 22:13:44 2015 UTC,"I'm a pretty good stringer myself and I loved using my trad this school year (freshman in hs) but I hated how the pocket was so crazy shifty. If I wasn't using 4 straight shooters then the pocket would shift higher then the scoop while I was shooting. This was a stick that was strung by someone else when i tried stringing my first real ""I might actually use this as a gamer if it comes out right"", I made sure to put a bunch of tiny tight diamonds on the top and larger and looser ones towards the bottom. This allowed for a better pocket definition, but there was no smooth release as the ball would just hook on the tight diamonds. Is an overly shifty pocket just inevitable with trad/pita? I currently use mesh  so I could make a more defined pocket with smooth release because I didn't like how my trad shot. Any tips would be awesome, thanks."
lacrosse,38gflq,Bigmac0636,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:12:27 2015 UTC,"Overly shifty, no, but shifty and baggy, IMO yes. A trady will always end up bagging out in some way. Some manage to bag out lower, others higher, but they all bag. When I was using trad I aimed for a deep mid bag with little whip. You went from one extreme to the next though, which happens to people new at traditions. You just over corrected a bit, that's all. Personally my diamonds are a little bigger at the top, but still tight. I use three or four straight shooters in all my sticks, trad or not, but it's extra important to have that in a trad because it allows you to tweak the whip and release point really well at the last second. Remember though that shooters don't fix a bad pocket, they make a good pocket a little better. If it doesn't throw very good without shooters it probably won't throw very good with them."
lacrosse,38gflq,henerydods,2,Fri Jun 5 01:22:59 2015 UTC,"Love it. High maintenance though. As a general rule...If you can't string it, don't use it. That said, there are tons of tutorials online. Traditional isn't too difficult to string."
lacrosse,38gflq,PM-ME-SMILES-PLZ,2,Thu Jun 4 10:24:07 2015 UTC,"I love traditionals, they are at once art and function all in one.  I am always impressed by a well done traddy.  As far as tools of the trade go, they are great pockets in the hands of a player with good stick skills.  No other pocket can be fine tuned to an individual's preferences as well as a traddy.  That being said, everything that makes a traddy a great pocket is also what makes it a terrible pocket for someone who isn't ready for it.  It's like giving a semi-automatic rifle to a kid who has never shot before, or handing the keys to a brand new Ferrari to a 16 year old fresh out of driver's ed.  Sure, they might enjoy pulling the trigger or stepping on the gas, but they are ill equipped to understand the tool they've been handed.  If you're a player with a few seasons of experience under your belt, and have enough stringing experience that you know how to make pocket adjustments to correct throwing problems, then a traddy might be right for you.    If you're a youth player or just starting out, do yourself a favor and skip the traddy for a couple more years.  A badly tuned traddy can breed bad habits in your throwing motion that can take years to undo.  And if the only way you can get a trad right now is to buy one from a store, then you might want to wait.  There is nothing wrong with buying one, but if you have no idea how to maintain it, it has the potential to do more harm than good over time.  As a youth coach in a non-hotbed area, I deal with this issue every year.  I have players coming back in their second season with full size D poles and trads.  I used to try to be nice and simply discourage them.  Now I tell parents in the first team meeting ""no trads and D poles allowed.""  Trads, poles, and side arm shots are achievements you have to unlock on my teams.  I want you to learn how to drive the VW before you get the keys to the Ferrari."

Its like owning a classic muscle car. If you are able to restore and or work on it yourself you will probably be unhappy with it in the long run. As a coach in a wetter area of the country that is anon-lacrosse hot bed I strongly recommend against my players using traditional sticks. The take lots of work to tune and maintain."

lacrosse,38eyto,Wollastone,2,Thu Jun 4 02:24:57 2015 UTC,"Laxpower will give you a general idea of the quality of Lax teams at these prep schools. I'd just like to point out that these schools are also split into two leagues: Western New England (West I, which seems to be the schools you are interested in) and East/ISL (Mostly Boston Area day schools with a few Independant Boarding schools, like Andover and Exeter).  There is little crossover between the leagues so that should be taken into account when looking at Laxpower computer rankings for all of New England Prep Schools."

lacrosse,38b4ef,NewYorkerinGeorgia,7,Wed Jun 3 01:53:56 2015 UTC,"I definitely do not have the answer for solving this, but it has always really bothered me that the championships are on Memorial Day weekend. I know the games used to get better attendance and it was still on Memorial Day weekend so it's not like that's the cause of declining attendance, but many of us would like to go do things with families and friends that involve getting away from cities that weekend. I'm out west so it's not really practical for me to fly out there anyway, but I imagine plane tickets are more expensive that weekend too.  And the NFL stadiums thing is stupid. When 2/3 of the stadium is empty it just doesn't give the same vibe - not as much general lacrosse ruckus, which is a bummer because one of the things I love about our community is the fact that we're generally a loud, energetic, but very welcoming group."
lacrosse,38b4ef,PM-ME-SMILES-PLZ,3,Wed Jun 3 08:01:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with your second point completely.  I wish we could fill an entire NFL stadium, but it just isn't viable anymore."
lacrosse,38b4ef,peebsunz,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:19:04 2015 UTC,I went to Baltimore in 2011 and 2014. The first time it was pretty damn packed and we set in the upper level. It helped that Maryland was in the final game and they're campus is within sight of the stadium but it was still pretty packed for the whole weekend. Last year they didn't even sell the upper level seats.
lacrosse,38b4ef,blu333,4,Wed Jun 3 16:32:14 2015 UTC,I'd go every year but as a coach I'm always in season so I can't squeak out a trip to the East coast to make it happen.
lacrosse,38b4ef,andyLDN,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:48:54 2015 UTC,"This one!  I'd love to take my kids to a championship weekend, they'd have a blast.  But we're usually playing at the same time these guys are.  So we're recording the games and watching them when we're done."
lacrosse,38b4ef,LaTuFu,3,Wed Jun 3 18:20:23 2015 UTC,"I'd wager it is a bunch of factors.    Watching lacrosse on TV and online has never been easier, ESPN, ESPN-U and ESPN 3 not to mention Fox Sports and the regional sports and NCAA conference networks have a good amount of college and pro lacrosse on TV right now.  When I lived in prime lacrosse territory on the east coast in the 90's the best way to see the top teams was championship weekend. I was never going to see the top teams play unless it was in person or the championship game on ESPN, which was not promoted back then. It was a huge deal to be able to see Syracuse, Hopkins, Princeton etc. play. Lacrosse families now are playing more and longer seasons and on top of that most lacrosse parents now are new to the sport so parents/dads aren't as likely to be fans themselves and thus sacrificing Memorial Day weekend on top of all of the other time they spend on lacrosse is not as appealing.  Lacrosse is still a very affluent game and many families travel for vacations over that weekend."
lacrosse,38b4ef,newswilson,2,Wed Jun 3 12:02:15 2015 UTC,"I wonder if the lower numbers is actually related to the growth. When Denver and Notre Dame are in the semis, I'd imagine you're losing out on the Upstate/LI/NJ fans in a big way. They still show, but it's different. People will travel from out west, but if you have a Princeton v. MD and a SU v. Hopkins semi (as you might back when the championships were at MD or Rutgers) in Baltimore or Philly, I would think you'd get the most numbers. The sport is growing, but it will be a long time before a Richmond v. Marquette semi will a) happen and b) bring the numbers like a previously mentioned semi would bring.  And I'm sure the price of the tickets and TV access also affect the disparity between growth and attendance."
lacrosse,38b4ef,mjgialanella,2,Wed Jun 3 11:16:27 2015 UTC,"Glad they mentioned ticket pricing as an issue because the premium prices the NCAA charges are bullshit. I was unaware that they dropped the price this year and offered new packages, but the ticket prices over the last decade have been ridiculous. For less than the cost of one ticket to one single game on Memorial Day weekend 2-3 years ago (not to be confused with a pass for one person to all games), I bought 6 tickets to the MLL All-Star game and took friends. I'd rather watch college ball but not at those prices."
lacrosse,38b4ef,UNIBLAB,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:54:41 2015 UTC,"Ticket pricing probably isn't the issue, though, because they've lowered prices and tickets sold continue to fall."
lacrosse,38b4ef,peebsunz,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:19:52 2015 UTC,"They did a really poor job of marketing this, however.  I was completely unaware of the pricing changes until the tournament was over."
lacrosse,38b4ef,LaTuFu,2,Wed Jun 3 18:21:46 2015 UTC,"I think NCAA Lacrosse got duped by a bunch of ""sports consultants"" into thinking that they had a gold mine waiting for them.  They failed to recognize the same problem the NFL is having:  As the fan experience on TV continues to increase, the appeal of attending the game diminishes.  Therefore, if you want the fans to come, you have to make the experience at the stadium a reasonable value.  Nobody is going to pay $200 to watch a lacrosse game unless its a corporation.  If the games are going to be on TV then the demand to attend the game isn't going to be as great as years past.  This year, ESPN had the games in Traditional and ""Spider Cam"" format, giving you a choice of how to watch.  Spider Cam sucked, IMO, but kudos to ESPN for trying something new.  Lacrosse is still a marginal enough sport, like hockey to a degree, that once you get to a high enough price point, the average fan is not going to give it much thought.  The NCAA made a huge mistake thinking they could charge ridiculous prices like the March Madness tournaments.    Add on top of that the fact that the majority of fans today are youth players and their parents, due to the growth of the sport in the last 15 years.  Memorial Day weekend is either a tournament weekend for a lot of those kids, or it is the first weekend without lacrosse in it since early February.  Travel fatigue is a factor for many of them, so asking them to pack up the van one more time and get on 95, one of the worst interstates on the east coast, is another strike against it.  I love lacrosse, and have for most of my life.  I'd love to attend a championship weekend.  But at the prices they were charging up until this year, that was not going to happen.  Factor in that I'd also have to fight 95 through 4 major metro areas to get to the event, on a holiday weekend, and no [bleeping] thanks.  Last but not least, until my youth coaching career is over in a couple more years, it isn't an option even if it is free.  As long as the game is televised, that doesn't upset me.  I don't think I am the only one out there that thinks this way.  I think the NCAA would do well right now to lower the prices even further, and move the finals around.  Get it out of the hotbed area, at least every other year or every third year.  The B1G and ACC have made major investments in lacrosse in the last 5 years.  Why not move the championship weekend to Charlottesville, Research Triangle, Chicago or Charlotte a few times?  Those areas are tremendous growth areas for lacrosse.  Price the games right, and you'd get plenty of people who would jump at the chance to see the games."
lacrosse,38b4ef,LaTuFu,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:32:37 2015 UTC,"Good point coming from someone who lives in St. Louis(which despite being a massive baseball town has a massive lacrosse system in HS), I would never fly out to Baltimore to watch overpriced games when you can watch them on ESPN. However, if they would occasionally put them in Chicago, I could take a cheap flight/train there much easier. From my experience, flights to Baltimore are already hugely expensive no matter the distance, and who knows how much rates get jacked up memorial day weekend."

lacrosse,386gws,TheOnlyAlpha1,3,Tue Jun 2 04:49:44 2015 UTC,"I dont know a lot about the epoch shafts, but I can help answer 2 and 3 just from years of experience.   There really isnt a specific flex for each position, it's all preference, for example, I play with a lot of whip and hold, so I prefer a higher flex shaft to let me get those high to high releases and such, but it varies depending on how you play.  As for shaft shape, again it's all preference, when I first started playing I used a warrior alloy 2000 for a few years and I will never forget the feel of that shaft, and one day I hope to find a similar shaft, but until then I find ones that feel good in my hands.  TL;DR things like flex and shaft shape are all preference that changes from player to player."
lacrosse,386gws,laxbeast26,3,Tue Jun 2 07:11:37 2015 UTC,"1) The Firefly is an entry level carbon fiber shaft. It is cheaper and from what I've heard, a bit cheaper in quality.   2) See /u/laxbeast26 's reply  3) I use the Dragonfly E30, and I absolutely love it. I feel like you get a better feel and grip on the shaft with that. The C30/C60 is just a normal octagonal shaft design, and the X30/X60 is shaped like a Maverik Wonderboy shaft.  4) I have a Warrior Burn and had to drill a hole in the shaft because it wouldn't line up. Also, if you get the F-Series grip you will have a serious head rattle unless you put tape on/under it."
lacrosse,386gws,ILikeTheWiz,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:23:32 2015 UTC,"I've been running an r40 for the last 3 seasons and is possibly the best shaft I've owned. In terms of flex, I find it's marginal, even with the added bulk of a goalie head. That being said, it's still there. I'm not too knowledgeable about flex shafts and the variance in flex so that's the extend of info I can give you.  Shapes are preference based. If memory serves pretty much all of their handles are standard shaped.  Be prepared for these things to break. I'm not sure if it's just a part of being a keep, but I've broken 2 and my current one is slightly cracked. However, Epoch is like Apple when it comes to warranties. Call em up, send them a picture, and then they'll send you a new shaft if it's less than a year old.   In terms of heads, even tough it's an attack head, the Nike CEO is a great head that a bunch of people are using as a face-off head."
lacrosse,386gws,thewallspc,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:38:52 2015 UTC,"For FOs a ""flexy' shaft might not be good but, I don't think it will make a huge difference."
lacrosse,386gws,WornKey,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:14:02 2015 UTC,"1)The Dragonfly is an advanced to elite player shaft whereas the Firefly is geared more for a intermediate player who is not used to a carbon shaft. The firefly has more fiberglass inserted into it so bring the cost down, this also limits the variations of shape and flex.  2) Flex point is all personal, if you want to have more of that snap feeling when you shoot and pass choose a higher flex. If not, choose the lower flex. They also make a strictly face-off shaft should you ever specialize.  3) In my experience yes. However I have not used carbon nearly as long as alloy shafts. The C(concave) shape is your traditional shape that nearly every player would be familiar with. The X(xtreme) shape is defined as a stronger shape due to the increased surface area of the side of the shaft and the rounded cruves. The E(ergonomic) shape is designed to fit in your hands best.   4) Lastly yes, however every shaft that is not your basic aluminum shaft will go well with any face off head. Remember its not the gear that makes you the best. Practice practice practice."

It is probably that either they are the wrong size/are to narrow, or that it is a sole issue. I would recommend changing to a different type of sole. If that doesn't work maybe try a different shoe tie pattern. You can find a ton of them on google."

lacrosse,387sn9,kill619,2,Fri Jun 5 05:02:08 2015 UTC,"Huarache's run notoriously small and I wouldn't be surprised if you simply have the wrong the size. I wear a 9.5-10 in damn near every other shoe and had to get the 4's in a 10.5 and there's still not enough room to double sock them. If your toe is touching the end of the shoe when you put it on with 1 pair of socks on or it's really uncomfortable to bend your foot in it you probably need a bigger size.   As someone else recomemed, showering in them helps to."

If you're not already an elite scoring machine, you will most likely be a role filler, like scout defense or short stick defense.     Be Fast Work/Try harder than every single other person out there Get your stick skills to a level that don't immediately knock you out of the running. Both hands. Show up early, leave late.  Show the effort. Call ahead and ask the coach for the team's training regimen. Say you'd like to walk on and would like the running and lifting suggestions they give the rest of the guys.  If you show up in shape and have demonstrated an interest and effort, you'll be ahead of most other walk ons.   Good luck."

Use your stick to keep the muscle memory..  Also it never hurts to have all your gear on and sprint to an object (5-10 yards away) then pivot left or right and explode past that point. Lacrosse from what I teach is just pass pass score if you have legs and endurance over the other team it's hard to stop you

There's a long story behind my reasons for putting down the stick, but in the end it's best for me. I'll definitely be back at my high school to help coach and give reps when I'm in town."

I spent two years away from the game when I was 18 (started back up at 20), and have never regretted anything in my life more than that.  We're only on this earth for a short period of time, and our health is a super fragile thing. Enjoy the game you love, don't let work take away your ability to get out and run around.  (Sorry to get preachy, just have seen a lot of my buddies stop playing because of work, and it bums me out. No job is worth quitting something you really love.)"

lacrosse,37vlcn,wkfink,2,Sat May 30 22:40:46 2015 UTC,"Story time...  I quit for a couple years after getting cut in my senior year of HS. This is after being one of the top LSMs in the state for three years running, but the AD at my school fired the head coach, and the new coach wanted a bigger LSM (I was like 6'0"", 155 I think?).  Anyway, I quit for two years, and in those two years I basically started partying too much and ended up failing out of college.  I moved out to the west coast where my family had moved to, and started coaching my younger brother's high school team. I finished college at the Art Institute of Seattle, and have been playing ever since.  Sometimes time away from the sport is what you think you need. Just make sure you're doing it for the right reasons, and not because you're butthurt like I was.  I wouldn't change anything in my life; I've got a great home, great fiancée, I play in men's league and in a pickup game every weekend, and I've got two awesome dogs. But lacrosse is one thing that will never be left behind, and I'm sure that when I eventually can't even play close D, I'll be on the sidelines coaching."

lacrosse,37w0bc,ThrocktheRock,4,Sat May 30 22:14:48 2015 UTC,"I play soccer in the fall. It helps soooo much with conditioning and footwork, which are really important if you play defense or goalie.  For the winter I would play ice hockey if you could. The way the rink is set up is a lot like a lacrosse field, and most of the mechanics are pretty similar."

lacrosse,37w0bc,Dgbrad8,1 point,Sat May 30 23:03:45 2015 UTC,I personally played football through my middle school and high school years. I found that the way I trained for football as a linebacker and lacrosse were pretty much the same. Reflex and reaction is a big part of playing defense in football and I'm sure that it would roll over into goalie skills. Plus the conditioning of football and swimming will definitely keep you in shape for lax season
lacrosse,37w0bc,tastypb21,1 point,Sun May 31 19:01:14 2015 UTC,I play Football and wrestling as well as lacrosse. It really helps on my explosiveness and speed/strength.
lacrosse,37w0bc,seemyhighlighttape,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:13:00 2015 UTC,"As a goalie, I've always felt that football is better than soccer because frankly, when you're a goalie you don't really run a lot unless you run some crazy defense. In football, you take so many hits(coming from a left tackle/nose guard) that you kind of lose fear of the pain of the ball. In terms of skill with a stick, neither will really directly help you, but the reactions needed for football will help more for lacrosse."

lacrosse,37v7so,msupz,3,Sun May 31 00:02:06 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge the lightest shafts are the gait ice and the maverik union. After those, you don't really notice a huge difference between any scandium or scandium+titanium shafts.   Think about it like this: when you cut weight out of a shaft, you take structural integrity out of the shaft. Lightest isn't always best, but if it's what you want, go for it."
lacrosse,37v7so,jongajuice,0,Sun May 31 00:04:28 2015 UTC,Stx katana is the lightest I believe
lacrosse,37tccc,ProfaneTank,13,Sat May 30 05:49:22 2015 UTC,"Good for the pros, makes it more interesting.     I'd like to see college stay the way it is.  It would be a horrible idea in hs and lower.  Just in courage bad shots and coach would lose their minds."
lacrosse,37tccc,Tokened,3,Sat May 30 08:26:53 2015 UTC,"I love the idea. It rewards good long-range shooters, and I think that's a good thing.   However, my problem with it is that it (and some other differences in the rules/field) make pro lacrosse too different from college. I don't think this is a bad thing in and of itself, but I do believe that having continuity through all levels of a sport really helps its appeal and growth. For example, the rules of soccer are exactly the same whether it's men's or women's, from youth up to the pros. Basketball has slight differences, such as how much time on the the shot clock, and how far the 3-point arc is, but the rules are generally very consistent from youth to the pros. Same with football. Really, the biggest difference is the placement of hash marks. Lacrosse, however, has massive differences between not only men's and women's fields, but the rules from youth to the pros. What that ends up meaning is that the player who is successful in college isn't as likely to be successful in the pros. Look at guys like Matt Abbott and Jeremy Sieverts. Were they good in college? Absolutely. But, they are STUDS in the MLL. Now look at guys like the Brattons. Studs in college, and not doing much in the MLL.  Basically what I'm saying is that the game needs consistency across all levels to help facilitate growth."

lacrosse,37tccc,meppsman,0,Sat May 30 16:16:30 2015 UTC,"Sure, but not to the same extent. It's much easier to identify talent in CFB that will succeed at the pro level. Though I will say that most of that probably has to do with the amount of money invested in that process for pro football."
lacrosse,37tccc,MrWermHatsWormHat,3,Sat May 30 20:04:38 2015 UTC,"I like the two point arc in the pros.  I just went to the Hounds Lizards game and going in to the 4th the Lizards were making it look easy, it was 20-7. The game seemed pretty much over. Then the hounds got some momentum, made a few 2 pointers, and were back into it 20-16 with 8 minutes left. The hounds didn't win, but the comeback at the end made the crowd go wild and gave hope. With out those two pointers the game wouldve just been a lost hope, but it was kept interesting till the last few minutes because of the arc."

lacrosse,37qey4,NewYorkerinGeorgia,6,Fri May 29 17:56:42 2015 UTC,"I think the reason I stopped following the NLL for so long was because none of the teams were really that stable. Everyone's always moving or folding. The Swarm seemed like one of those teams that was relatively stable and now even they have to change cities. Yet they still wonder why they can't seem to get professional lacrosse off the ground. Lacrosse is still a relatively small sport in much of the country, so it's hard to acquire new fans when it's uncertain as to what the future of the team will be. Then there's the argument that they can't become a stable team without fan support. And it just goes around in circles because they can't be stable without fans and the fans are hesitant to invest themselves in an uncertain team.  All that said, I think in a number of years, once lacrosse gains more popularity, we might see a better level of professional play with more stable teams."
lacrosse,37qey4,ProfaneTank,5,Fri May 29 17:57:12 2015 UTC,"You're looking at it way oversimplified. The problem with the current NLL teams that are getting jogged around isn't the fan base numbers, it's the fact that these teams are getting the shaft when it comes to arena time. The swarm were waiting like 3-4 weeks between home games because the venue they had a contract with wouldn't give them any priority, and then if they did get a home game they were Sunday afternoons. Compare that to a team like the Calgary roughnecks who play all of their games on either a Friday or Saturday night, and have only a few weeks of road games in a row a year. Edmonton rush is also having venue problems right now and is rumoured to be going to Saskatoon, and it has nothing to do with the fan base. Edmonton can support a team if that team could get the time of day in the venues eyes. Unfortunately a Friday night Taylor swift concert is going to make more money in a venue 100% of the time so it will always take priority.   I'm pretty lucky to live in Calgary where the roughnecks are owned by the flames. They get venue time, they get good management, and they get advertisement opportunities out of it. It's a pretty unique system in the league and it clearly is working for them. Now if only we could bring home another championship."
lacrosse,37qey4,henerydods,1 point,Fri May 29 19:28:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that my statement was the only problem, it's just a significant portion of the problem. Take the Chicago Shamrox, for example. They shared the Sear's Center with a few other teams including the Chicago Rush as well as some shows that would occasionally perform there. They never seemed to have an issue with scheduling, but their ownership was hesitant to spend money and they didn't have that many people coming to watch towards the end of their existence. They just weren't generating enough revenue. I'd say having the backing of the Flames is a fantastic way to spread the word about the NLL and to get people in the door. It's clearly not just scheduling that's an issue and not just the fan base/ownership. It's a number of things."

lacrosse,37qey4,Kylekub,2,Sat May 30 05:17:17 2015 UTC,A point of ignorance on my part... Do many lacrosse players play both NLL and MLL?
lacrosse,37qey4,NewYorkerinGeorgia,7,Fri May 29 16:16:39 2015 UTC,"Twelve (or so) years ago I was on the practice team of the Columbus Landsharks. None of the top players lived in Columbus. The top players were both MLL and NLL. However, the mid tier players were NLL only, and the bottom tier were the best players who lived in Columbus. Don't know how things have changed, but that's how it was back then."
lacrosse,37qey4,henerydods,2,Fri May 29 17:58:18 2015 UTC,"I can speak for Calgary currently as I play on the same summer box team as a few of the roughnecks. Most guys get flown in and out for us. A good group of the necks are from BC so they fly in from there. Some choose to live in the city though because Calgary is pretty easy to find a well paying job in that still let's you work the awkward hours that a pro athlete will need.   But it's basically as you said, most of the best guys get flown in and play both MLL and NLL (Dickson and Snider for Calgary, but both actually live in Calgary during the season, Snider was born and raised there and runs a lacrosse camp in town), the mid level guys only play NLL because they don't want to commit to playing field in the states too and they are flown in and out, and the low/practice roster guys are either the best from the area, or the best that are willing to move in to the city so they don't have to be flown in and out."

He was one of my favourite players growing up and I got to watch him win a champions cup in Calgary, but I was much to young to have an opportunity to play with him. Him and Toth are pretty big reasons as to why I fell in love with lacrosse and pretty big reasons lacrosse is so big in Calgary. Those guys were amazing at the game and did a ton of work for the game in the community. I was lucky to be able to watch them growing up though, that's for sure."

Also, since I played with him, I'm officially old. But I've suspected this for awhile now, lol."
lacrosse,37qey4,MinnieFan,2,Fri May 29 23:38:25 2015 UTC,"I know the better ones do, I've always wondered how they do this unless they some how get to play for a city that has both NLL and MLL."
lacrosse,37qey4,henerydods,3,Fri May 29 16:25:42 2015 UTC,"Most in the NLL at least don't actually live in the city that they play in. They get flown in and out for every game. They practice the morning of the game, or night before, and maybe the day after and then fly home. Some still do live in the town they play in, but most don't. They will have a training camp for a few weeks durring pre season where everyone stays in hotels for that time in the city they are staying in. I know the same is true for most of the big name guys in the MLL although I don't know to what extent they practice and fly in and out."
lacrosse,37qey4,MinnieFan,3,Fri May 29 16:45:27 2015 UTC,interesting but I guess that makes a lot of sense since they don't get paid enough to live of their salary and need to have another job.

I know in my old highschool lacrosse was the last on the priority list to get any time on the turf to practice nor anything in that matter. Finally seeing a change in Ohio lacrosse and can't wait to see more and more schools introduce lacrosse.
lacrosse,37qeej,BrokenWild,1 point,Sun May 31 04:34:18 2015 UTC,"Article text:  COLUMBUS - The Ohio High School Athletic Association Board of Directors will vote June 4 on whether lacrosse will be adopted as a sanctioned sport starting in the 2016-17 school year.  OHSAA Commissioner Dr. Dan Ross told a media advisory committee this morning that the OHSAA has a recommendation to sanction boys' and girls' lacrosse starting for competition in spring 2017.  Entering this spring, there were 120 boys' varsity teams and 112 girls' teams, according to the OHSAA. That does not include the club teams at the respective schools.  The state lacrosse association sponsors a club division championship for boys.  ""If adopted, our hope is that the club teams would become school teams (and the OHSAA would not sponsor a club division),"" OHSAA Associate Commissioner Bob Goldring said.  The location for the state lacrosse finals, if adopted, is yet to be determined, Dr. Ross said.  Bowling was the most recent sport to be adopted by the OHSAA. This past winter was the ninth year for the sanctioned sport."

The thing is really nice, if I had to get a carbon fiber shaft it would probably be one of theirs. I am not a huge fan of CF so I'd like to see their alloys shafts. I know I used to love when they did STX's scandium shafts way back when. I don't remember if it says it on their website or not but they have been supplying lacrosse handles to different companies for a while now. I guess they decided to go direct to customer which is cool."

lacrosse,37oclo,TheStonedLaxer,2,Fri May 29 03:03:00 2015 UTC,"the top looks good.  nice and clean stringing (im anal!)  but about the bottom, does that create a good channel for the ball?  or is that to force/guide the ball into you mid/high pocket?  from the picture, and my experience, would such a bunched knot mess with the pocket?  it kind looks like a place-holder stringing... are you finished?  anyway, you asked about the top and it does look great.  and to answer your question, i dont usually double string the top as my default/go-to, but i have... and i have never used that particular head :)"
lacrosse,37oclo,SapienChavez,6,Fri May 29 15:28:21 2015 UTC,Thank you! The bottom string doesn't really have much of a purpose in this head. It doesn't affect the pocket one way or another. The whole thing is pretty much for the hell of it as I'm never going to actually use it.   Am I finished? Never. Next week there might be something completely different in there. I'm always stringing something different just because I can.

lacrosse,37oclo,ProfaneTank,2,Fri May 29 15:50:30 2015 UTC,"I've found that two different kinds of bottom string make a difference. When I string a mid/high pocket, I come up through the bottom of the mesh, skip 4 holes, go down through the 5 diamond, down the bottom string hole, up through the very next bottom string hole (on a four hole setup), up through the 6th diamond, skip 4 diamonds, then back down through the 10th diamond. This keeps the mesh flat at the bottom and keeps it relatively tight, pushing the pocket higher. If I'm going for a lower pocket, I just go up and down every hole. Even when I pull the bottom string as tight as possible, I find that these two methods still make a difference. I don't know, it's all just theory. Maybe try it out and see if you get similar results?"

lacrosse,37nfc1,nsbruno,3,Thu May 28 22:36:52 2015 UTC,"I play for a club college team and we condition with the NCAA trainer. We begin with an active stretch then we do starts (X6) at 5 and 20 yd intervals, cone work involving shuffles into sprints, sprints into shuffles, sprints --> cuts, sprint and run around the cone frontwards, sprint and run around the cone backwards. We then do ladder work; single, double foot (high-knee and regular), and jingle-jangle (two feet in and two feet out). I personally incorporate a GB in at then end of the ladder after a short sprint. Finally, we do 3-4 sets of 25 yd shuttle runs. If you do this a couple of times a week you'll be prime for the season.  Edit: make sure for the starts (since they're for speed and not endurance) that you recover fully before each one. Youre not going to get faster if youre not performing at 100% each time."

However this is like a mix between early season cross country speed work outs and track sprinter workouts so you will probably want to include some agility with cones or something. btw dont do all of these together at once several days in a row, do every other day or do a hard day then an easy.

It's like a cross between basketball and hockey, with the rink and line changes almost exactly like hockey, but the movement patterns of basketball. There is a 30 second shot clock like in basketball. There are very few stoppages in play, unlike hockey where they have faceoffs all the time, instead of faceoffs teams either gain or lose possession of the ball based on the call and play continues on the fly, this will be confusing at first but you will get the hang of it fast. Penalties are similar to hockey, although the specifics of each call will be a little different. There are 4 - 15 min quarters. It's actually a very simple and flowing game, the hardest part for a new watcher is following where the ball is, but just like in hockey you will get used to watching body language and stuff like that.   Most importantly is to have fun, the guy is taking you because it's important to him. Have fun with it and don't be stressed about it, he wouldn't be taking you if he didn't think it was going to be fun to take you. And I'm sure he will be more than willing to explain a few calls for you, we lacrosse players tend to be very friendly and welcoming to new people in our sport, we want as many people to love it like we do as possible."

There's stuff from this week as well as a game preview for Gm 1 coming tomorrow"

lacrosse,37my03,henerydods,2,Fri May 29 15:24:40 2015 UTC,"Ha, well given that I am an editor at Lacrosse Magazine, one would HOPE that I would recognize the difference."
lacrosse,37my03,Burnsiah,0,Fri May 29 19:42:25 2015 UTC,"on either side, the boundaries make it 6v6 with a goalie, and if one of the 6 on either side does their job right, there's either a goal or it heads back downfield.  After a missed shot, whichever player is closest to the line wins possession for their team.  That's all I've got!"
lacrosse,37my03,Katsuichi,3,Fri May 29 00:41:49 2015 UTC,Isn't it closer to where the ball went out not the line? Sorry to be knit picky but this came up in a highschool game of mine and my coach got a personal for yelling at the ref
lacrosse,37my03,omicron_persei_m8,3,Fri May 29 03:35:53 2015 UTC,"No worries, I don't know nearly as much about the game as most on this sub, I just was involved in starting a team at the school where we work... 5 years later, there's still plenty to learn!"
lacrosse,37my03,Katsuichi,1 point,Fri May 29 12:05:27 2015 UTC,This is a common misconception. Possession should be awarded to the closest to the ball at the time and point it went out of bounds. Most players run directly to the line because the line is the easier call to make.

lacrosse,37nm4e,TateEight,5,Thu May 28 23:28:49 2015 UTC,"The best advice I can offer you is this: don't go to Dick's Sporting Goods for a stick. I'm not sure where you live, but if you're able, go to your local lacrosse specialty store, ideally a Lacrosse Unlimited, Universal Lacrosse, or LaxWorld. Buy your stick piece meal (as in piece by piece). That way you can make it exactly how you like it, and won't be constrained by ready-made options at the store. Also, have it custom strung. Lacrosse Unlimited and Universal Lacrosse do a pretty decent job with custom stringing as well. The best option for straining would be to send it to one of the ""Instagram famous"" stringers. (I'm friends with several of them and can suggest one for you if you'd like).   If you're unable to go to a physical store, I'd recommend buying your setup from a site like lax.com (great selection and prices), and then sending it out to one of those ""Instagram famous"" stringers to have it strung."
lacrosse,37nm4e,drdriedel,2,Fri May 29 01:39:06 2015 UTC,"I understand, but what stick would you recommend?"
lacrosse,37nm4e,BearGryllsUrine,2,Fri May 29 03:50:12 2015 UTC,"The Vandal is a good set up, simple and clean and a good head. Go to your local store and PLEASE have them string it once you get it however, it cannot remain factory strung."
lacrosse,37nm4e,drdriedel,2,Fri May 29 03:52:28 2015 UTC,"None of those heads. Personally I'm a fan of the Warrior Evo 4X. That and maybe a warrior kryptolyte shaft or Nike Vapor shaft.   As far as mesh/stringing goes, I'd recommend either StringKing or EastCoastDyes new HeroMesh. Both are weatherproof, non-bagging and non-wax coated. Also, don't get wax mesh."

lacrosse,37j4m2,Adam2uBer,4,Thu May 28 19:12:38 2015 UTC,Congrats on the big W! Just curious how MCLA DII compares to MCLA D! etc!?
lacrosse,37j4m2,rick_rolled_you,4,Thu May 28 01:37:17 2015 UTC,"I played in both D1 (half season) and D2 (two seasons). However, this was from 2009 to 2011. I still follow MCLA ball and would say the top 5 in D2 could probably beat or have close games with most of the top 25 in D1. As proof of that Grand Canyon, Westminster, Liberty, and Davenport are in the top 25 of D1 and made the jump from D2 within the past two years. Only thing about Grand Canyon is that they used to be NCAA before."
lacrosse,37j4m2,darthsparkle,5,Thu May 28 08:12:12 2015 UTC,I'd say the top 5 teams in D II are comparable to the the teams that get knocked out in the first round of MCLA D I playoffs.
lacrosse,37j4m2,notnicholas,4,Thu May 28 01:39:58 2015 UTC,"MCLA D1 ftw, but in all seriousness congrats on the win man thats gotta feel good"
lacrosse,37j4m2,rick_rolled_you,2,Thu May 28 03:29:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. At the conference level there is a lot of overlap between DI and DII schedules. Most games are evenly matched, but the top DII teams usually whomp the lower DI teams on a local level.   Notably: St. John's (DII) won every game against the local DI schools (U of Minn, Mankato, St. Cloud State, Iowa State), and most of them were blowouts."
lacrosse,37j4m2,andyLDN,1 point,Thu May 28 16:47:31 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the top teams in DI destroy those teams. Like, double digits in the first half, and maybe 3 against. U of Minn is decent if I remember. I played on one of the top teams, so I have personal experience."

lacrosse,37ekoh,ionlyjunglena,1 point,Wed May 27 01:33:11 2015 UTC,"Do not quit Jr.A box to play some random men's field league. You should learn far far more from Jr.A box than Ulax, and the level should be higher. Plus if you're playing Jr.A box I have a feeling you are being recruited to fit a certain role, don't just abandon that. As Canadians our box lacrosse skills are beginning to be what American college coaches are looking for. They like the fact that we can catch, run, and pass in pressure and in tight. They like our two man game and how we bring it to their field game, and after DU winning the D1 championship I have a feeling more and more coaches are going to be flocking to Canada to pick up as many players as possible.   Anyway, as far as being intimidated, well I feel I can help there. I just made a Sr.B squad out where I am, and it's supporting some pretty serious talent, including current NLL players, past NLL players, and current NLL draft picks/ recruits. It's crazy how intimidating a team like that can be to play on for a lowly little guy like me who never even made it out of Jr.B. What I found worked best is to not alter your habits. Continue to hit the wall the same way you always did, suit up for practice and warm up the same way you always did. Play your game your way, you've made the team for a reason, don't wander away from that reason.   As far as off season workouts, I think playing lacrosse is far more important than taking time off to lift weights. That doesn't mean ignore the weight room, but don't drop lacrosse to focus on it. And don't over focus on the weights either. There's a lot of running in field lacrosse and no breaks on the bench like we get in box. Box is far more sprint than it is endurance like field, so keep that endurance up so when you get to your uni for fall ball you are prepared."
lacrosse,37ekoh,henerydods,1 point,Wed May 27 19:22:06 2015 UTC,My only issue is that I play at prep school.  I made junior A in Toronto for March (the coach was interested in me playing and I had a 3 and a half week break) so I made the team and played 3 exhibition games before i left back for school.  I am currently just finishing a season of springball and I really have no choice considering by the time I get back (June 21st) my box season is almost done and no new players are allowed to enter in the playoffs so I would get little to no games played rather in the Ulax at least I'm practicing with a couple NLL practice squad guys on my team at least.  I'm going to be playing as much as I can but I feel really inadequate size-wise compared to some players which is the big thing I want to focus on.  I am 6'1 and 1/2 weighing 183ish so I feel like bulking a little would be good for me over the summer. Do you have any suggestions for other leagues or practice schedules I could follow to keep up with the skill?
lacrosse,37ekoh,henerydods,1 point,Wed May 27 23:56:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly it's very normal for guys to come into the box season pretty late because of school reasons. I still have D1 guys showing up to my practices on my team slowly. And Guys on our roster still away for school. I wouldn't give up on Jr.A dude, it's some of the best lacrosse in the world and not many people get the chance to be a part of it. And you will probably play after you come back from your first year or two of uni too.   I'm assuming you're from the Toronto area and I don't know much about the options for you in that area, but if you can commit to both leagues that would be a pretty good deal for you I think. You're pretty young yet, your body can handle it. But I would personally commit more to jr a than to Ulax.   Honestly size wise you are pretty big for your age. Bigger than most kids your age going into uni so I wouldn't worry too much. You will come into your size with the lifting coach you have a school. I wouldn't stress too much, but lifting and bulking won't be bad if that's what you want."

lacrosse,37ec1v,Jhson17,3,Wed May 27 00:28:09 2015 UTC,"Don't worry too much about it. Since it's your first time playing, you're not going to know what you like. I would recommend not spending too much money on it because there is a pretty good chance you will figure out something you don't like about it once you start playing and will want to replace it.  Don't get a complete stick if you are older than about 10 or 11. The shafts that they come with are cheap and you will break or dent them very quickly. Spend a little bit more to get a 7050 or 7075 alloy shaft.  Since you can't string, what you want is a strung head. It doesn't need to come with a shaft. If you can use a screwdriver, you can attach a head to a shaft."
lacrosse,37ec1v,newaccoutn1,2,Wed May 27 02:34:56 2015 UTC,"Considering you're new, you'll want to buy a head that is a little wider than what most experienced players would use. Besides that, it honestly doesn't matter. There are zero noticeable differences between heads besides width, weight, and durability. Since you're just playing wall ball and new to the sport, you'll just want to get something thats wide. The shaft does not matter at all. Once you start playing, you'll want a decently strong shaft (depending on your age, older players hit your stick harder, so if it's weak, it will break)."
lacrosse,37ec1v,rick_rolled_you,1 point,Thu May 28 03:52:25 2015 UTC,Just because you can't string doesn't mean you should get a complete. You can have the store string for you. As for specific sticks I can't really help you

Think of it like sheathing a sword at first and once you feel comfortable doing that you can move on to different dodges based on that change of hand. I really can't emphasize enough how important this is because just practicing that change of hand will make you so much more comfortable with a stick.

lacrosse,377d3l,newswilson,1 point,Tue May 26 12:26:09 2015 UTC,I think there might be rules within the NLL about the size of the arena the team has to play in.  I recall when the Blazers folded a few years back saying they were trying to work out a move to Agganis Arena (a smaller arena in Boston) and the NLL didn't allow that to happen. But I could be mistaken

lacrosse,375xi5,SparkIeFarts,6,Mon May 25 03:54:30 2015 UTC,"Think of it like you're catching an egg. Don't snap at the ball when it comes towards you. Instead, give with it and ease it into your stick. Best of luck"
lacrosse,375xi5,Gasper_Jaspers,6,Mon May 25 04:05:28 2015 UTC,To add onto what you said there is a good way to practice this too:  Find a wall with no/minimum windows on it. Stand a comfortable distance from the wall that you don't have to throw too hard for the ball to come back to you at stick level or so it bounces back at a comfortable height.  As you start to catch you can build up your speed to recognize how to catch harder passes. This is going to build the muscle memory you need but it's all about practice and taking mental notes of what is working and what isn't working.
lacrosse,375xi5,mightybst999,3,Mon May 25 04:55:59 2015 UTC,"This...  it is the best way to describe teaching yourself to have soft hands.  Also, since you're new, you won't have to unlearn any bad habits so start with good ones: Throw and catch all your passes in your ear/box area. What does this mean? Imagine a square or box framed by the top of your shoulder, up the side of your head, across and back down to your shoulder again (one on each side of your head). When catching the ball, present the head of your stick slightly in front and to the side of your face, above your shoulder in this ""box"" area. Cushion the ball as you catch it slightly behind your head (""in your ear"").  This will allow you to throw the ball quickly and from a fundamentally sound position. You want to always aim to catch and throw the ball from this area.  Also, try not to stand square to the wall. Have your body and feet set like your are throwing a baseball. The biomechanics of throwing with a lacrosse stick are all the same as if you were throwing the ball with your hand.   One of the ways to starting training your muscle memory to throw the same way is to start throwing one-handed. With your top hand about halfway up the shaft, and the ball in your stick. Practice using the EXACT same throwing motion you use in throwing a ball bare handed. It will feel weird at first - and don't worry so much about catching it at first - but once you have that mechanic down, you can concentrate on throwing for accuracy. As I say above, focus on trying to throw a ball against a spot on the wall where it comes back to you in the spot behind your ear. if you can master this, with each hand, you are well on your way to improving each day!"
lacrosse,375xi5,Zoos27,3,Mon May 25 13:35:02 2015 UTC,"Make sure you hold the shaft near the head, this way it's almost like catching with your hand. Also wallball lots and you'll get used to the movement."
lacrosse,375xi5,EcentricNoodle,3,Mon May 25 04:57:07 2015 UTC,"Keep your eye on the ball. Your body has an amazing ability to know where it is in relationship to itself (aka proprioception). When the ball comes to you, accept the pass, don't catch it. Let your stick give with the ball as it arrives.   God I hope you've seen Mighty Ducks, or that last part won't make sense.   Hope this helps!"
lacrosse,375xi5,drdriedel,2,Mon May 25 13:00:49 2015 UTC,"The way I found resinated the best with kids is get behind the ball. Practically have it come at your face so you can see it all the way into your stick. Also you don't want to get hit in the face with a lacrosse ball! It forces you to catch the ball as well as allows you to see what mistakes you might be making like turning your head, snatching at the ball or not giving enough. All of these other posts are right on the money, I couldn't agree with them more. This will just help YOU see what you might be doing and force you to catch the ball or get a solid bump on the noggin. Don't ever get discouraged you'll get the hang of it soon enough just stick with it!!"

lacrosse,375xi5,thatkidzach,1 point,Mon May 25 16:05:42 2015 UTC,O absolutely it's all about moving at your own speed. Actually a tennis ball may be more challenging since its lighter you have to give a little more. Who knows you might find a lacrosse ball to be a piece of cake now. Just keep practicing and you'll have it down in no time.
lacrosse,375xi5,newswilson,2,Mon May 25 16:09:29 2015 UTC,"Choke up. I coach youth and the biggest mistake I see from older beginners is not choking up to catch. Some of it is they want to look iike the other kids, kill that noise and focus on the basics. Placing your top hand just below the head will give you  far more control and a better feel for catching the ball. Once you get some experience and you are able to catch and throw without thinking about it you will be able to slide your hand down and catch like more experienced players."

The tank is lighter, but the hammer holds up better for checks (I don't throw a lot of pokes, I prefer to play body). If you get a hold of the ball a lot I'd go with hammer as it's a little more pinched; and easier to pinch. Overall I love both but would pick the hammer.

lacrosse,371fo5,newswilson,1 point,Sun May 24 14:50:07 2015 UTC,If you can heft it the mass can may your shot harder but you have to have the strength to compensate. Kind of the reason why most baseball players use super light bats with thin wooden handles that always break. Bat in the day the bats were thicker and heavier. If you are a stronger D-Mid a wood shaft would be a weapon.
lacrosse,371fo5,peebsunz,4,Sun May 24 20:46:54 2015 UTC,I honestly hate wooden shafts just because they cause more injuries.  If you're a D-pole or D-middy that uses a wooden shaft just because you want to inflict more damage with your checks you need to reevaluate how you play.
lacrosse,371fo5,newswilson,1 point,Sun May 24 23:11:50 2015 UTC,"Well again, I played in a different era from where the game is now. As a youth coach I think bam shafts should be illegal because of the combined flex/mass, As for regular wooden shafts I don;t have a problem as a kid strong enough to do damage with one will do damage with anything which is not allowed in youth rules. To me its like my kids wanting a traditional pockets, I advise strongly against them because most non-HS players won;t tune or take care of a traditional pocket."

lacrosse,36x1ph,LongSchlongDon,10,Fri May 22 20:43:52 2015 UTC,"Great catch.  Basically, it's an additional torque arm, whose force is eventually converted to a linear force...if my physics isn't too rusty."
lacrosse,36x1ph,MrWermHatsWormHat,3,Fri May 22 21:14:45 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr-jgw0N3pk  The cradle is just there to keep the ball right where you want to it in your pocket when you throw and for rhythm. The best example of this is when shooting underhand, where that cranking motion is only that keeps the ball in your stick as it turns upside down right before you fire.  In the same way that its really hard to sprint without cradling because ball will just dribble out of your stick, it works the same way with the shooting motion."
lacrosse,36x1ph,kill619,2,Sat May 23 06:09:15 2015 UTC,"This was mentioned in an article that broke down Rabil's shot in lax magazine maybe a year back... MrWemHatsWormHat is correct, attempting to face the head of your stick to the opposite goal while winding up to shoot is common practice among the sports elite, it forces the shooter to emphasize the torque and twist of the torso and ads forearm torque as well!"

lacrosse,36sft8,blu333,1 point,Fri May 22 00:51:25 2015 UTC,"Ahhh. The Brine Prophecy.  The ""top of the line"" Brine head from 2004.  I remember a pole on my team had one and it was the most flexible head I've ever seen.  Or the STX Hype, where you strung the lower half of the pocket from the top of the sidewall.  And finally, the STX Liquid, where the middle of the sidewall itself was supposed to swing as you cradled."
lacrosse,36sft8,tholmes23,1 point,Fri May 22 19:54:34 2015 UTC,The liquid was what I was thinking of. I ditched the little hanging pieces because they were pointless. That head was also VERY flexible. I remember I pinched it into a box-like shape just using my hands and it stayed.   I think I might have had the hype as well unless there was another similar head by brine and that sucked too. I just ignored the top holes but the thing weighed a ton and I could never get a good pocket.   I messed around with those weird heads for a while but I never found anything to sufficiently replace my answer/answer pro. I've been using those for about 10 years now.

lacrosse,36s493,henerydods,1 point,Fri May 22 14:27:17 2015 UTC,"Personally I would pinch it down to more of a surgeon face shape, but that's because I play offence and attack. If you play two way at all in either box or field I would almost keep it as is because it still has a very good face shape.   As far as pinching it with the mesh in, I wouldn't. Just take it out and re string it afterwards. You're going to want the pocket to be a bit different anyway after pinching. If you really want to try to pinch it with the mesh in I would try and boil it while keeping the mesh out of the water as best as possible. You will need a very large pot to even try that though. I boil any head that I pinch anyway, so it's not like boiling them isn't normal."

Secondly, I suggest working on a pinch n' pop or variants such as a plunger.  There are many good videos on YouTube to learn how to actually face off. You can also youtube face off whistles on youtube to practice in your home. Reaction times are key, form, muscle memory, and lacrosse iq all go into face offs. It's a very mental aspect of the game."

lacrosse,36tm46,Ezvy,1 point,Fri May 22 02:16:01 2015 UTC,"While I respect your request, I have to say from experience being a FOGO isn't that fun. You either win and get off or lose and play defense. Say goodbye to your heads, as you'll be guaranteed to break at least one per season. If you're playing either on or against a team with a good offense you'll be so tired you can't see straight from all the constant sprinting. If you are doing great, be prepared to get viciously attached by either the other face off guy or the lsm. If you're losing, well yeah it sucks. With that being said I'd consider being a FO middi that plays and takes about 40-50% of the faceoffs. If you insist on fogoing however, download the whistle files from fogolacrossse.com and do these exercises every day. The average exercises like chops dont do it for me and are overrated imo. Get a good head, I use the blade pro when I'm a FO Middi and an OG Blade when I FOGO. also, a lot of fogos use really small pads but I find my arms get torn up very bad when I win a lot so you may want to look into better equipment also. Good luck, you can always pm me if you have any more questions"
lacrosse,36tm46,A_Brown_Bear,0,Fri May 22 02:31:51 2015 UTC,"Yo HS fogo checking in.  No one should choose to be a fogo, you should be chosen for the position.  I got stuck here because my offensive skills are sub par, I'm a great defender, very scrappy on the GBs and the only good face off man on the team.  While it may suck at first, I now enjoy my craft.  If on the other hand if you still want to, there is no one stopping.  YOU MUST DRILL EVERY DAY! I suggest https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gw-1dyM6CvM.  Also have a routine getting down. I start perpendicular to the line, when the ref says down i drop to one knee (inside) and hit the backside of my stick on the ground than line it up.  It's intimidating looks bad ass, and gets me focused. Make sure to look at your stance in the mirror, try to get as low and centered over the ball as possible.    For me, I started to win face offs not because i was quick, but I was strong, dirty and never gave up.  Quite frequently if i find an opponent was faster than me, i could win by driving back their stick while working my way around the ball until I could alligator finger (using your three middle fingers to rake into their stick to dislodge or even grab the ball) the ball out.  Also make sure you always have 2-3 sticks.  I break about 1-2 heads per season or warp the shit out of it still its always illegal. I prefer the blade pro, I've had 4 of them since I started playing."
lacrosse,36tm46,Lax4Evr,1 point,Sat May 23 17:20:30 2015 UTC,"Sound advice, except for the finger part. Using any part of your hand or finger to dislodge the ball from your opponent's stick is illegal and could result in a one minute non-releasable misconduct penalty. Thay being said, you can use your fist to push the opponent's head back as you punch down the line.

I have some great lacrosse players that I have coached who either refuse or are incapable of listening to offensive and defensive schemes that we coaches spend a lot of time putting together.   If I tell my defender that the #1 rule of our defense is never get beat top side, then that has to be your absolute priority above all else. I have started less ""skilled"" players because they are willing to buy into the system that I am teaching when others won't."
lacrosse,36nrvr,Sargeypoo,3,Wed May 20 19:52:06 2015 UTC,"Being coachable is probably the number one thing any player can be. If you are the best player on the field but you can't or won't play within the system or do what the coaches ask you to do, you aren't going to be effective. As a coach, I am trying to put the best TEAM on the field, not the best group of top players. There is a vast difference between the two."
lacrosse,36nrvr,Zoos27,3,Wed May 20 20:45:06 2015 UTC,"Coach-ability and effort. Nothing worse than seeing a ""Good Player"" dog it. No matter how good your stick is, no matter how wicked the shot I can not stand taking plays off. Also where I coach in a non-hotbed area lacrosse I.Q. is HUGE. Kids who understand the game and can deal with a situation on the fly because they understand the rules and the concepts of the game is an immense positive that can overcome size, speed and sometimes even skill."
lacrosse,36nrvr,newswilson,2,Wed May 20 22:18:29 2015 UTC,"Not a coach but I can vouch for the IQ part of this comment. I got playing time and was the head of my varsity's man down squad just for being the smartest on the field and constantly talking. Not sure if it matters as much on offense but as a defender, communication was just as, if not more important than talent on my team."
lacrosse,36nrvr,A_Random_Sloth,2,Fri May 22 17:33:20 2015 UTC,"Varsity coach here. 4 things get near equal consideration for me (3 of which are taken directly from PCA training):  Effort, Learning, Mastery, Attitude  So basically show up and try hard, learn what you are supposed to do, understand and improve your skill set, and don't be a shithead."
lacrosse,36nrvr,Sun-Ghoti,1 point,Thu May 21 02:51:30 2015 UTC,"For the JV team I used to coach, it was all about hustle and drive to be the best.   I often chose motivated and driven players who hustled 110% on the field over someone who was better but clearly wasn't there to play and would rather be somewhere else. Determined and driven players are often the most coachable players because they want to become better.   And like Sun-Ghoti said, don't be a shithead. I once got heat from two parents for not giving their kid more playing time, their reason being ""he was obviously the best out there"" and they would pull him from the team. I knew the kid as being a hothead, but talked it over with the rest of the staff, and we put him in the starting 10 for the next game. And surely, within 5 minutes of opening face-off, he had been on the bench for a minute for a slash and then 3 minutes later, got a game suspension for fighting.   So yeah, don't be a hot/shithead if your coach doesn't play you as much. Take it in stride, show you hustle harder and earn your spot on the field. Don't expect to play just because you think you're the best, prove it and not just by having a bar down rocket, but by being coachable and a team player."

It isn't one specific thing. If you catch my eye with a good hustle play or a fundamentally sound move, I will be more apt to continue to look at you and evaluate you."

lacrosse,36kczu,LaTuFu,3,Wed May 20 01:28:15 2015 UTC,"Check out some YouTube videos on proper GB technique.  Work on scooping on the run.  If you can workout with someone else, that's even better.  Its important to have solid technique, but it is also important to know how to approach a loose ball in a crowd.  Body position and footwork is every bit as important in 2v1, 2v2, 3v2 as it is in defense.    The most consistent fundamental breakdowns I see in players who struggle with GBs is getting low.  Chant the term ""both butts down"" when you're working.  The butt end of your stick and your butt need to be low for proper form.  The other chant for your workouts is ""move your feet and you won't get beat."""
lacrosse,36kczu,jdrshal,1 point,Wed May 20 14:33:09 2015 UTC,I guess just throw the ball against the wall really low and practice getting the groundball. Practice getting your backhand low as well as protecting the head of your stick once you bring it up.
lacrosse,36kczu,LaTuFu,2,Wed May 20 15:52:45 2015 UTC,"You will never find a coach at any level who discounts the value of ground balls.  There is a reason why every coach from U9 to D1 builds their practice plans around GB fundamentals.  If your current coach is telling you to focus on GBs, then I would take that as gospel and build your summer workouts around it.  You might be the best shooter on your team, but if you can't scoop a GB in transition, you're not much help to the team if you're not standing next to the cage.  Guys who can hang out on the crease, catch and shoot are a dime a dozen.    Players who can win a tough ground ball and set up a transition are valuable assets to any team."
lacrosse,36iyo4,ctk05,2,Tue May 19 19:01:11 2015 UTC,"the games that caught my eyes the most was the ND and Albany and Ohio state and Denver game. Lyle Thompson showed me that he's unselfish and is a true team player, he draws a lot of attention for the defence drawing doubles and even triple teams. Which means someone on his team is open like Conner fields for who has 6 goals that game and 13th hat tricks over the season. On the ND end it showed me that more people other than Kavanagh and Ossello can score for them. 3 other people from there 2 mid group tallied at least 1 goal this could be trouble for Denver who i have winning the champ. Though Ohio state did give them a run for there money early in the half. Denver pulled out a W in a stylish comeback Wesley berg with 6 goal and Zach miller with 1 g and 3 A this attack unit will be the key to beating ND there defense on the same hand also Ryan Laplante with 13 saves keeps getting better. I have Denver beating notre Dame and John Hopkins beating Maryland"
lacrosse,36iyo4,jongajuice,1 point,Wed May 20 00:11:25 2015 UTC,"That Ohio State game was just painful for me to watch at the end. I've been meaning to go back and watch the Hopkins and the 'Cause games though. I'm disappointed Albany didn't make it through, but ND is extremely good this year. Can't wait to see how Denver performs against them.  On a related note, how did I know I'd find you in this thread, Jonga?"
lacrosse,36iyo4,ProfaneTank,3,Wed May 20 04:58:55 2015 UTC,I would highly recommend watching that Hop-Cuse game! Instant classic. And I think most of the lacrosse world is with you on the hope the Albany would have made it deeper with its once in a lifetime phenom.
lacrosse,36iyo4,jongajuice,2,Wed May 20 13:43:22 2015 UTC,Hahahah you know me too well Profane im always talking NCAA lacrosse
lacrosse,36iyo4,paperbandit,1 point,Thu May 21 01:54:31 2015 UTC,"My thoughts on on the Albany/ ND game were this: 1) Lyle is a team player, but did not play his best game like he needed to to overcome ND 2) Matt Landis is an elite cover man and will not have trouble limiting Berg and the Denver offense. ND plays the lanes and schemes on defense better than anyone in the country, so Denver's ""possess the ball, find the lay-up"" style isn't going to be as effective as it was on Ohio State  I have Notre Dame beating Denver because of the suffocating defense which matches up against the Denver offense well, Trevor Baptiste is not going to be able to overpower the ND faceoff unit like he does most units, and Ryan Laplante doesn't always looks as good as he did against Ohio. That being said, looking forward to two championship capable teams clashing. I also have Hopkins over Maryland (sorry for the wall of text)"
lacrosse,36jbqi,joekeegs,2,Tue May 19 20:26:36 2015 UTC,"Great write up actually. Now that the NLL is winding down you should start seeing the Canadian influence more and more. It will be interesting to see if guys like Dickson keep doing Sr.A ball in Canada or finally make the permanent switch to field instead of the ""only when there is an outdoor worlds do I go play field."" After last year I know he was thinking about it, Sr. A ball is a lot harder on the body than MLL is and I know some of the older guys really appreciate that, haha.   Interesting point on how to prevent the picks, the guy didn't even know what to do when the defender touched him. He just looked at him with all this confusion like ""you can touch me?"" I had a good laugh at that, you can't just give up when your defender pushes you a little, haha, fight through him and set that pick man! Problems arise there though when you start to get Canadians who are used to that and use it to their advantage in the pick and roll game. Over play that and you can't call the switch fast enough and the ball carrier gets half a step on you, under play it and the pick is too easy, it's a fine balance that requires some pretty good skill."
lacrosse,36jbqi,henerydods,2,Tue May 19 23:06:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for reading! I'd love to see Dickson back in MLL. Florida actually owns his rights now, so he'd be playing with Casey Powell, Lyle Thompson, Miles Thompson and Kieran McArdle. They have been running lots of box concepts without the Thompsons so far, I imagine they'd run even more with Dickson.  Picking rules in MLL are so confusing. 95% of the picks they set in NLL would be considered illegal, but the picker's defender can play it essentially the same as NLL? You're absolutely right -- teams and players need to start finding ways to counter aggressive pre-pick defense."
lacrosse,36jbqi,henerydods,1 point,Wed May 20 12:58:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think the aggressive defence is that bad. It nowhere close to how they play d in the NLL so we don't have to worry about that yet, a few offball pushes here and there are no big deal. Guys will start adapting to that pretty soon I think. And more and more box guys who are used to getting pushed around a little it won't affect them much. It's just the field only guys that are not used to that and get caught off guard by it right now. John Grant Jr. isn't bothered by it, I guaranty that, haha.   Plus add in the fact that if the defence starts playing too aggressive they start to give up their own 6' advantage. Combo the Thompsons with Dickson and Casey, none of those guys are bothered by a little push (and trust me when I say the MLL pushes there are much much lighter than the NLL ones). The Thompsons are box players before field players in many people's eyes so they can easily handle it, Casey is basically a converted box player and plays very well in that style, add Dickson to that and you've got a pretty insane offensive threat for both on and offball plays. That would be an exciting offence to watch."

My team signed up for the 2am to 3am slot so the place wasn't really super crowded and a lot of the vendors or whatever were shut down. But the actual playing lacrosse was a really great time. They split our team up and then added in some guys from Boys Latin or Calvert Hall that were there playing. Our team was nowhere near as good as those guys but it wasn't competive at all. Just a bunch of guys out there just playing lacrosse. All in all I had a great experience and it was cool playing at 2am

lacrosse,36eu3t,CommanderClunge,11,Mon May 18 20:57:37 2015 UTC,"You're not allowed to touch plastic if you have possession of the ball. With that being said, a ref is rarely going to actually call a penalty unless you are thumbing or obviously way too far up on the head. It's pretty common to cradle one handed with your thumb and forefinger resting against the plastic."
lacrosse,36eu3t,Sargeypoo,7,Mon May 18 22:04:14 2015 UTC,"Illegal to touch the plastic in any way. The only time a ref will call this is on a face-off or if you're obviously thumbing the ball.   Also, please re string that stick."
lacrosse,36eu3t,accidentlyaword,4,Tue May 19 03:25:52 2015 UTC,"It's illegal. You can't touch the plastic at all anytime you are in possession of the ball or engaged in a face off. Here is the exact rule:  Rule 6.13  Withholding Ball from Play SECTION 13. When a loose ball is on the ground, a player may not lie on the ball, trap it with his crosse longer than is necessary for him to control the ball and pick it up with one continuous motion, or withhold the ball from play in any other manner. No player may pick the ball up by jamming the reverse side of the crosse on top of the ball. All ground balls are to be picked up by scooping the ball with the front of the crosse. A player, players or team may not deliberately withhold the ball from play. Repeated actions of this nature may be ruled unsportsmanlike conduct. (See Rule 5-4-e.) Note: A player in possession of the ball who holds his crosse against any part of his body, thus preventing the normal dislodgment of the ball, is illegally withholding the ball from play. The glove hand cannot grasp any portion of the head of the crosse. This is intended to cover faceoffs and a player in possession of the ball who is “thumbing” the ball or choking up and grasping the plastic portion of the crosse."

lacrosse,36eu3t,Kingkern,1 point,Tue May 19 09:38:56 2015 UTC,Fairly sure you can't touch the head in any way while in play but the degree to which someone is touching it would be up to the ref.

lacrosse,36eu3t,ProfaneTank,-8,Wed May 20 02:15:41 2015 UTC,There is no rule against touching your head while cradling as long as you aren't touching the ball in any way while it's in your stick
lacrosse,36eu3t,ShellingWizard,1 point,Mon May 18 22:04:09 2015 UTC,Not true. You can't touch any plastic while cradling. Though you will pretty much never get called for it. You won't ever do it because you can't actually roll the shaft in your hand properly for a smooth cradle.

lacrosse,36ddtm,theheadcoach,4,Mon May 18 16:12:27 2015 UTC,"Arizona is really competitive and to my knowledge treats it like a varsity program (they went to nationals this year.) Most MCLA teams, especially DI MCLA teams, operate like virtual varsity programs despite the ""club"" label. about 30 MCLA programs are actually varsity teams in the NAIA or USCAA and since their governing body doesn't have lacrosse, they participate in the MCLA. Basically if your talent level is there you'll have a shot but Arizona is a competitive program, I believe the dues are expensive because they travel nationally, and I would not expect them to be ""club"" in their operation. Many MCLA programs are just as rigorous as NCAA DIII programs as far as talent and skill levels."
lacrosse,36ddtm,Whale_Poacher,3,Mon May 18 16:24:37 2015 UTC,"They did not go to the MCLA national tournament this year. They have over a 40 man roster and it's highly likely that if you want to play and have some experience they will let you on the team. Most teams accept tons of players/don't cut because they make money from dues, but they do not guarantee playing time.  For the second questions, if your ability is there, they don't care. They are looking for decent and committed players. You will not have to be recruited and you can ""walk on"". Just email the coach or fill out the questionnaire on their website."

lacrosse,36ddtm,ProfaneTank,1 point,Mon May 18 16:37:58 2015 UTC,"Arizona has a pretty deep roster. Like /u/thetagamma2 said, just fill out the recruit questionnaire. It will give the team an idea of what to expect for an incoming freshman class. Not that it really matters since it's club and you have to pay, any MCLA team could use more bodies just to collect more money.   But, if the team has more than 50 people interested, they'll have tryouts just to keep the roster a reasonable size.   EDIT: MCLA is club, the word recruit getting thrown around is kind of silly since there is no scholarship or the fact that they can't pull strings with admissions. The only exception really would be the smaller private schools.  Source: Played on two separate MCLA teams, D1 and D2."

If you want to get involved in some Latin American lacrosse I highly recommend you go. It's at the end of July and you can find info here @ FIL, and here @ Mexico lacrosse. Contact info for the tournament organizers is at the bottom there.   Individuals are welcome to go as they will be organizing pick up games or maybe even a pick up team if enough individuals go. There might even be a box lacrosse game if I can make it to the tournament. Highly recommend the tournament to anyone interested. It will be a ton of fun."

If you get cheap ones they fray, get holes and aren't as protective as some higher end gloves. You end up destroying them and buying another pair which, in the end, costs more than had you bought a quality pair once. I'm not all for aesthetics but you gotta admit the nicer gloves are way cooler too. I'd check out any of the Brine Kings, Warrior Regulators, STX Cells, and Romes.

lacrosse,367joc,IM_A_NINJA_AMA,3,Sat May 16 22:46:26 2015 UTC,I coach and FOGO I'm going to tell you the soft mesh complaint was idiotic. With the new NCAA a specs not using soft mesh is going to hurt you. Mis playing of the ball.
lacrosse,367joc,corregidorbataan,1 point,Sun May 17 02:00:50 2015 UTC,"I've never personally used it but everyone on my lacrosse team just complains and says to used waxed mesh or hard mesh, so I just go by what they say..."
lacrosse,367joc,corregidorbataan,3,Sun May 17 02:59:29 2015 UTC,Trust me soft mesh is awesome for FOGOs I can trap the ball super easy. Hard mesh is for those who play other positions besides facing off. Don't get me wrong it is good as well there but hard mesh just causes more misplays than anything.  Edit: Reread it and it looked stupid.
lacrosse,367joc,henerydods,1 point,Sun May 17 03:10:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not really a FOGO, I am a middie who takes faceoffs. Next year I want to switch to attack and then still do faceoffs"
lacrosse,367joc,henerydods,2,Sun May 17 03:44:35 2015 UTC,"Use a super soft wax mesh then. You don't want anything other than soft mesh in your faceoff head, and every person who is experienced with faceoffs will tell you that.   Also I think soft mesh is great outside of faceoffs too. I can't see why your team would be complaining. I use soft mesh in my gamer and I play attack."
lacrosse,367joc,theheadcoach,1 point,Sun May 17 04:10:54 2015 UTC,"All of the good faceoff players on my team say waxed or hard mesh, and one says traditional. I'm so confused!"
lacrosse,367joc,corregidorbataan,2,Sun May 17 04:56:20 2015 UTC,"Oh god no on hard mesh. That's the worst mesh to use for faceoffs. It doesn't pop back and forth when transitioning from holding the ball in the back of your stick to holding it in the front. It's ok if you're the type of faceoff guy who pops the ball out to a teammate every time, but it severely limits you to passing the ball off and beer being able to pick up a loose ball if your mesh is still pushes in backwards.   Traditional can work, but it's a lot of work to maintain. It gets extra beat up from the abuse that faceoffs bring it so it might break on you unexpectedly. If you are good with stringing traditional and willing to put in the time to maintain a pocket then it can work. Remember, traditional is like the softest of soft mesh.   They make some really soft wax mashes now adays, so go check one of those out. You don't have to worry about them bagging out too much in the rain and they are still soft enough to faceoff with."
lacrosse,367joc,WornKey,1 point,Sun May 17 05:19:15 2015 UTC,Thanks man. I will look into the soft waxed mesh!
lacrosse,367joc,KillerGoldfish10,1 point,Sun May 17 05:22:24 2015 UTC,I actually disagree. Its a matter of preference but I use an original blade(like from 2002)/blade pro with monster mesh that I break in enough to flex but still keep the hold. I like the monster mesh because I don't need to flex the head as much to make it stay in the back of the net but the big diamonds don't hold it so much that it gets stuck in position like a really hard mesh would. I also am a fan of the monster mesh for the hold it has while carrying down the alley in transition. Its also nice hold for dodging and then dumping to an attackman. As long as you break in the mesh it should be fine no matter what you're using it for. Its mostly preference anyway as long as you are effective at your moves with it.
lacrosse,367joc,WornKey,1 point,Sun May 17 05:52:54 2015 UTC,"I have string kings 2s or whatever it's called coming in on my 3rd face off head. I am excited about being able to test out a new soft waxed mesh. By the way I forgot to mention earlier. I have a clutch with soft wax mesh, it worked awesome for me in bad weather! It also performs well in the mud. But I'll give you a breakdown of my pockets.  Epoch Hawk- Soft mesh low pocket really it is a mid to high but I had it strung kinda weird til I redid it myself. It has a spot in the channel that with hold the ball thru almost any stick check. (Yes even when I get a clamp it stays as well.   Ghost7- paracord G web pocket. Low. Soft as well compared to leathers. A lot of success ""ninjaing"" the ball. Or basically losing by speed winning by strategy. Since the head is so flexy it pops it out really nice. Oh and shooting is awesome.   Brine Clutch 2x-ECM wax, totally awesome for many reasons but I put that above. Not my face off head I use it to play attack.  For now til I get my CEO that's it. Anyways if you have any questions PM me."

lacrosse,366mwn,jongajuice,3,Sun May 17 21:21:55 2015 UTC,"It's the second round of NCAA lacrosse and there is going to be good lacrosse all day long. Starting off with John Hopkins and cuse, I have cuse winning this one 12-7 they have all cylinders running right now, the face off X is going to be key for this game and they should dominate. UNC at Maryland, I have UNC winning this one 15-7 due to the fact that Maryland's defence didn't really impress me that though they are the best in the country, I feel like UNC's offence and Joey Sankey are going to point up a lot against them. Ohio state at Denver my pick is on Denver, 17-10 Denver has everything you want in a lacrosse package one of the top face off specialist in the game, a solid goalie and a veteran defence in front of him, and best attack units with Connor Cannizzaro. With all this it will be too much to handle for Ohio state but they will bite back with Jesse King. And finally the game, the rematch, the hype for all lacrosse fans. Notre Dame and Albany my pick will be Albany 17-16 OT in a classic back to back shootout. I feel like they need to win it all this year. An for all you club players like me don't forget there are two national championships game today! Colorado and grand crayon play 2:30 PM and Dayton and Concordia are playing right now you can watch on there website MCLA media"

If you are stationed via military lots of these guys play with German teams. Ask around when you arrive or check Facebook when you know where you are going. Some Universities offer a programme but the levels vary wildly. It is usually a segway into club play. Some clubs run b Teams and some have to cooperate with other clubs to field full teams.

lacrosse,362pic,Zoos27,2,Fri May 15 16:25:40 2015 UTC,"Good article.  Thanks.  My son is playing DIII next year at a school that is very good in their conference, but still is working to be a nationally competitive team.  It would be cool to see them get there while he is playing.    He never really focused on DII or DI schools.  He was getting calls this past late fall from DII schools I had never heard of primarily in the south.  But he had already verbally committed.  The kids in our section going to DI programs mostly were committed by junior year.  There is one excellent player my son played travel with that got recruited just last summer before senior year to a DI program.  His mom said she didn't really understand the process and could have been working earlier to get him more exposure.  Whatever level, I think it's important to realize that you can really help shape the process by filling out recruiting questionnaires and opening the dialogue with the coaches with emails.  They might not always be able to talk to you, but you can always reach out to them.  Another big help for my son was playing in the Orange Crush showcase that happens in Syracuse each year.  He did 2 years in a row and got a lot of interest (from DIII mostly) because of that I think.  I also agree with the comment from shdlax75 about some DIII programs.  There are a lot of noncompetitive teams out there.... but hey, you're still playing lacrosse!"
lacrosse,362pic,Silkdad,1 point,Fri May 15 23:16:33 2015 UTC,Good article. But I agree with the other comment on there saying that D1 is not everyone's top priority. I got recruited to a D1 program and turned it down because I wanted a college experience. And also the program wasn't that great.  But great article about practices and showing light on the recruitment at an early age. Isn't there a lot of recruitment from D3 to the D1 level now a days too?
lacrosse,362pic,drsquires,1 point,Fri May 15 18:05:34 2015 UTC,"There is but D1 is going MUCH younger than D3 is. This is the gist of the article because now it is opening doors for high quality players to go to D3 programs, and those programs to get those players.  Source: am a D3 coach, always looking for quality guys who want to play."
lacrosse,362pic,shdlax75,1 point,Fri May 15 18:32:44 2015 UTC,"I think once you get around the outside of the top 50 in lacrosse though you get a lot of people who treat D3 as almost a club sport with more benefits.  Yes people are serious about lacrosse but there is a vast difference between NESCAC schools and everyone else, I dont think it was a good example to be honest, its not your typical D3 experience."
lacrosse,362pic,NewYorkerinGeorgia,1 point,Fri May 15 22:47:47 2015 UTC,"I would argue somewhat against the idea the idea that it's NESCAC and everyone else. NESCAC schools do tend to be great academic schools on top of good athletic ones, but look at the landscape of all D3: There is very good lacrosse being played all over the country. Whittier was screwed out of the tourney 2 years in a row now, Midwest teams are stepping up, Sewanee, from the south had a great year, Lynchburg (VA), Gettysburg (PA) are in the final 4...  Outside the 32 teams in the NCAA Tourney, there's probably another 50+ that are capable of playing in it. That is a LOT of good lacrosse there. You have to find the school that best fits you."
lacrosse,362pic,strainerhat,1 point,Sat May 16 13:22:00 2015 UTC,"I played club at Syracuse twenty years ago, and most of the guys on the team were former varsity players. They chose club because the demands the varsity made on their time were incredibly high, and they weren't going to see the field much, so it simply wasn't worth it to them. To others it was. These are decisions everyone has to make for themselves."
lacrosse,362pic,strainerhat,1 point,Sat May 16 02:02:48 2015 UTC,"This is a PERFECT way to put it. It is also a great way to look at the D1 vs. D2 and D3 landscape too. For example, D1, Fall Ball is generally 2-3 days a week plus S&C training all fall. D2 has something like 24 fall practice days and can do 8 hours a week of S&C, all of it has to happen in a 45 day window. D3 you have 16 practices, that's it. S&C is voluntary outside of that (Pro-tip: though the powers that be - cough, NCAA, cough - say otherwise, as a general rule, nothing is *really voluntary if you want to be competitive).   The time commitment varies, but as I say to everyone I coach and see at recruiting camps and throughout summer ball: there is a college for you IF YOU WANT TO PLAY. Not everyone is D1 caliber and the older you get, the slimmer the chances of being picked up at the D1 and even D2."

lacrosse,360p67,drdriedel,1 point,Fri May 15 15:46:29 2015 UTC,"An x6 head is typically more pinched at the scoop than an x spec, though no real difference in use otherwise. If you're in high school you cant use an x6 head"
lacrosse,360p67,brinkley26,1 point,Fri May 15 03:43:43 2015 UTC,"The advantage that can come from an X6 (college only) head is almost exclusively offensively. The tighter pinch at the scoop gives a ""tighter"" release. The mesh is usually less tight up by the scoop allowing the channel to naturally form higher (to an exent) than it would at the standard 7"" scoop of a universal spec. The disadvantage is for ground balls, less surface area, more difficulty to scoop ground balls."

lacrosse,35zl9w,theguywhopickedkirby,2,Fri May 15 03:45:43 2015 UTC,"Hey I was going to make a separate past but I saw your comment so I figured I'd just ask you first. I played goal in high school and am now coaching a youth lacrosse goalie. What are some good drills to run with him? He's in fourth grade. One of his biggest issues is getting the angle right to not give up too much of one side. I've tried a few ways to show him, but it's not sticking. Any advice there?  Thanks!"
lacrosse,35zl9w,serfis,1 point,Fri May 15 14:13:39 2015 UTC,"As far as youth kids.  I think understanding their angles is the most important.  I'm not sure how familiar you are with the different types of arcs.  So, what you do is tell him he's only allowed to stand in five places.  Either holding the pipe, 45 degree, in the middle.  Opposite 45 and other post.  Those are the ONLY place he's allowed to stand.  This will help him from getting out of position and it'll teach him which spots of the nets he's given up depending where they are on the field.  Show him the arc.  Then make him step it.  And keep stepping it.  Start every practice with him just stepping around the arc.  Eventually he should be able to do it with his eyes closed."
lacrosse,35zl9w,theguywhopickedkirby,1 point,Fri May 15 14:23:22 2015 UTC,"That's a good one. I learned a triangle rather than an arc, and I was told to move along it rather than in just five spots. I think what I'll do is write down the numbers 1-5 and have him move from to another as I name them, or something like that. Now, he's pretty small even for his age, how far out of the net should he be?  Another issue I have is that during warm-ups he does a good job of stepping to the ball and stuff, but in games he seems to forget all that stuff. Is that just something that comes with experience, or is there something I can do that'll help?  Thanks again!"
lacrosse,35zl9w,serfis,1 point,Fri May 15 16:27:49 2015 UTC,"I like the five spots, just because the kids know exactly where they are in the net.  There is no guessing needed.  Stepping, I'd work on walking the line before warm ups too."

lacrosse,35zl9w,serfis,1 point,Fri May 15 17:13:43 2015 UTC,"Triangle is fine but I think at that age, arc is easier because you can introduce it through the clock method if you can -- 9 o'clock being left post, 3 o'clock being right post.    Now, he's pretty small even for his age, how far out of the net should he be?   The smaller you are, the more you need to come out in my opinion. I think it is better to play too far out than too far in -- you're losing some reaction time by playing too far out but you're cutting down how much goal the shooter has available to them. Your defense needs to be johnny on the spot with ground balls and passes to the far post, though, which isn't a strong spot on U10 teams. It all comes down to preference.   However at all levels, from beer league to pro there are great hockey, lacrosse, soccer, whatever goalies that play pretty tight to the net and some that are wild and play practically at midfield. It all comes down to what you're capable of and what you need to be a better goalie."
lacrosse,35zl9w,sydtron,1 point,Fri May 15 18:50:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know being smaller typically means coming out further, but I wasn't sure if that was a good idea for his age since he's not all that comfortable yet.

Don't take it personally, but I never understood these kinds of questions.  If you know the game of lacrosse and you have the requisite skill and physical ability, why ask?    If you never understood what the attackman was trying to do with the ball when you were defending him, can't hit the broad side of a barn with a short stick, and was just the big guy on your high school team who they handed a big stick for whacking the opposing players, then NO.

lacrosse,35xsvl,blu333,1 point,Fri May 15 16:30:23 2015 UTC,"There was some talk about goalie injuries, but the real reason was that it was tough to officiate.  For the goal to count, the shooter must have lept from outside the crease, not contacted the goalie in the space above the crease, and the ball must have passed the goal line before the player landed in the crease.  That's a lot of checks for the ref to do in a fraction of the second and the real reason it was banned."
lacrosse,35xsvl,smilli02,11,Fri May 15 16:56:12 2015 UTC,"A shot clock in the 4th quarter/second half.  This may be unnecessary if the pinched heads are eliminated from the game.  More open head designs, less pinch allowed.  Defenses should be rewarded for good footwork, body position and checks, especially at youth/HS levels where the HS pinched stuff practically locks the ball in the pocket.  It encourages too much ""hero ball"" iso garbage on offense.  It also creates rougher checks/potentially dangerous hits because so much force is required to dislodge the ball.      Get back to a game where ball movement is critical and defense can create turnovers with good technique."
lacrosse,35xsvl,LaTuFu,2,Thu May 14 12:31:44 2015 UTC,"Even with heads like the Gait's used I think you wouldn't get the offence defence battles you and I want to see. Add a shot clock to the whole game and playing solid fundamental defence becomes so much better. No need to worry about how pinched a guys stick is, if he can't get a good shot on the net because the defence won't let him that's way sexier than someone dropping the ball from a check any day of the week.   In box if a defence can hold an offence off from getting a solid shot off for the full 30 second shot clock the crowds and teams go wild. And for good reason, that is amazing defence. No need to even go for crazy aggressive and dangerous checks when the offence looses the ball anyway if you're playing good defence. Shot clock should be in the future of field in my opinion, longer than 30 seconds of course because that's crazy short for field, but something at least."
lacrosse,35xsvl,henerydods,3,Thu May 14 13:25:55 2015 UTC,"You may be right, and I'm certainly not opposed to a shot clock.  I just think less pinched heads will open up a lot of things.  It'll bring back transition offenses for one thing, and get rid of the set piece, specialized matchup garbageola that so many college and high school coaches want to create nowadays with the micro management coaching styles.  If the ball is on the carpet more often because defenders can dislodge the ball, then there should be greater opportunities for fast breaks.  That will keep the specialists off the field longer, which goes further towards opening things up.  If the shot clock will add even more to that, then by all means I'm in favor."
lacrosse,35xsvl,LaTuFu,6,Thu May 14 19:27:33 2015 UTC,"I wish manufacturers would stop making nfhs heads and only focus on universal heads.   Edit: I'd also like to see consistency with rules. If you change a rule for college, fucking make that change in high school as well the same year. It's been an absolute battle with my kids to get them to stop using v's and u's in their sticks this year so they are prepared for next season"
lacrosse,35xsvl,msupz,4,Thu May 14 15:52:38 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you on the consistency of rules across the board.  All lacrosse players should be basically playing the same game.  However, I want to point out that the blame falls largely on the NCAA — their game is changing way too much, way too quickly.  They'll change a rule and the next year revamp the entire section of the rulebook again because it didn't work out the way they intended (e.g. faceoffs).    They either need better foresight or more discussion and caution about the implementation of rule changes.  So far, much of the meddling has been reactionary based on what they see on the field during any given season.  Lacrosse has grown too fast for its own sake the past 15 years, but I still think the powers that be have been overly aggressive keeping the play in check.  While I'm all for keeping the original spirit of the game alive (transition, speed, fair play, etc.) and limiting the pervasive culture of advantage seeking (lacrosse players bend the rules as much as any Boston area based football team), just think about how many rule changes have occurred in the last few years alone...  1) Faceoffs (a.k.a. A brief history of time) a. elimination of the ""set"" call b. reintroduction of the ""set"" call c. Substitution of violator d. Repeat violations procedure e. Complete revamping of the mechanics f. Withholding using the back of crosse  2) 30 second rule  3) ""Back court rule""  4) Shot clock  5) Releasing of the shot before time expiration  These are just off the top of my head.  None of them exist in high school play.  Although rules should always account for, and therefore differ, with respect to the LEVEL of play, the gap between high school and college is mostly due to a rapid acceptance of reactionary rule changes that perhaps should be better thought out and more cautiously implemented."

lacrosse,35xsvl,Oggdogg87,1 point,Sat May 16 06:20:01 2015 UTC,"The game was once on a level playing field for attackers and defensemen.    Then, naturally, technology and advantage seekers found ways to gain an advantage.  The advantage swung heavily in favor of the attacking player.  The pockets got deeper.  The heads got smaller and narrower towards the throat.  The stringing techniques more elaborate, and so on.    Nowadays a defender is not always awarded for a great check on an attacking player.  One of the reasons, accurately identified, is the use of ""shooting strings"" down low in the pocket that basically act as a pocket within a pocket.  They help ensnare the ball.  In attempt to help level the playing field and return the game to its original spirit — that of a quick passing and transitioning game — the powers that be have decided, over the past few years, to alter some related rules.  At the NCAA level, the crosse dimensions were changed, rules were altered for withholding the ball, and this new shooting string rule has gone into effect.  The NFHS has adopted many of the NCAA changes a bit more slowly over time, and the shooting string rule is one of those becoming effective for the 2016 season."

lacrosse,35xsvl,dj_bpayne,1 point,Thu May 14 19:02:38 2015 UTC,"Here's my run-down of what I want to see at the High School level:   I don't want the NCAA faceoff mechanic or the one swift motion with no carrying in the back of the crosse.  I DO want to see the three violations lead to a 30 second penalty. I want the shot clock at the HS level, but no set time. I'd like to see an automatic stall warning for the end of quarters when man up/man down when it is decided the team is holding onto the ball for possession the next quarter.  This is stalling and should be recognized as such. Stricter dimension rules with pinching, thinking a mid-head measurement as well as the widest point.  Though I do think the roll-out tests catch a lot of illegal sticks. I'm almost to the point where I want the men's game to go to what the women have and have the officials check EVERY crosse before a game.  Illegal crosses seem to be an epidemic at all levels this year. I'd like to see the contact to the head rules re-worked.  As it stands now, any check (body or crosse) that initiates with the head is an automatic 2-3 min UR penalty.  While I get the intention, and it's a good enforcement tool to use with bad cross checks or illegal body checks, there are TONS of slashes called al the time that TECHNICALLY fall under this rule that are only called 1 minute.  An attackman is cutting the the crease and a D-pole attempts a trail check and clips the helmet.  That is nearly always called a 1 min slash (unless it is particularly violent) but should actually be a 2 min UR.  This language needs to be cleaned up. I'd like the NFHS to insert more direct language making the teams responsible for their spectators, especially visiting squads.   That's all I have right now."
lacrosse,35xsvl,theanuranking,1 point,Fri May 15 14:31:23 2015 UTC,"More requirements for goalie equiptment. Every time I bring this up I get called a pussy. By middies who whine when they get slashed too hard in practice. But why the fuck are goalies not more protected than the average player?   If the only reason is ""Goalies are tough! We have a tough goalie tradition!"" Then I don't want to fucking hear it. Every day I go out to a field and my friends and coaches physically torture me. Don't get me wrong, I don't complain about this on the field. I don't get hit with a ball and then go down for 15 minutes. I just wish playing this position didn't hurt as much as it does. It's gotta be the most painful position in any sport."
lacrosse,35xsvl,The_Hippopotamoose,2,Thu May 14 18:49:11 2015 UTC,"You know you are allowed to wear pads pretty much unless they make you wider.   Personal Equipment SECTION 21. a. Protective Equipment. All players shall wear protective gloves, shoes and jerseys. All players except the designated goalkeeper shall wear shoulder pads and arm pads. The designated goalkeeper shall wear protective goalkeeper equipment (see Rule 1-23-c). The altering of equipment is prohibited. All players on a team must wear gloves of the same dominant official team color unless safety reasons require a different color glove to be worn. Specialized goalkeeper gloves may be of any color. The throat protector and chest protector are required pieces of equipment for the goalkeeper, but the goalkeeper is not required to wear shoulder pads or arm pads."
lacrosse,35xsvl,newswilson,-2,Thu May 14 19:04:33 2015 UTC,But I want them to require more pads. So teams won't think I'm a noob when they play us.
lacrosse,35xsvl,The_Hippopotamoose,2,Thu May 14 19:59:37 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a personal issue, fuck what others say, they aren't brave enough to play the position. I prefer less pads due to the weather here in Florida"

You're given the option to wear more pads. Plus if the other team thinks you're a n00b then you should get some pretty easy saves for the first quarter."
lacrosse,35xsvl,The_Hippopotamoose,-2,Thu May 14 20:36:59 2015 UTC,Oh come on you know what I mean. Goalies with a lot of gear get chirpped and made fun of. I dont want that.

But if a goalie wants to wear more gear and doesn;t want to be called a noob then dress like a Canadian and wear sweats 2 or 3 sizes too big. You can practically hide hockey pants under those things and as the US national team can tell you from the world championships how you look wearing sweats has nothing to do with how you play. But with sweats on you could wear shin guards, thing and hip pads and no one will know. If guys give you guff just tell them you are from Ontario. :)"

By keeping it in the box, the offense is forced to be in closer proximity to the defenders and a turnover is more likely. It doesn't do much in games that aren't close, but it does add a bit more excitement to close games."

I love lacrosse, and it's an awesome thing. However, your brain and body are more important. While a concussion won't seriously harm you, it can still do some damage, especially if not treated properly. Don't return to lacrosse until you and your doctor agree it is time.  I've gotten a good amount of concussions, including two from lacrosse, and they suck ass, especially when you aren't fully recovered before you get the next one. Please see your doctor, and don't play lacrosse (outside of passing a ball around if you're feeling good) for a while. It isn't worth it."

lacrosse,35od2l,dj_bpayne,8,Tue May 12 04:38:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, its the first practice so I wouldn't worry about it too much. It will come with time. I see it all the time here in Canada with our summer & fall field teams. Since field is not even as close to as popular as box a lot of guys from different clubs around the city end up coming together and playing on the few select field teams we have. It's always a slow start, but as guys start to spend time together in dressing rooms and outside of practice and game times they will start to mesh more.  Give it time and maybe organize a few team bonding things unrelated to lacrosse.  Maybe when it comes to travel time you can organize the rooms to help with kids meshing together. Keeping the defence and offence together amongs themselves and communicating as a group will be important. So maybe work on some 2 on 2 pick and rolls where instead of matching kids from the same school together mix match the kids a little.   Like you said, they are already meshing well withing the game and the drills so I wouldn't worry too much. With time they will grow together, and trust me when I say that next years rivalry games will be even better."
lacrosse,35od2l,henerydods,5,Tue May 12 06:54:30 2015 UTC,"The more things you do together as a team, the more players have a chance to interact, and the more those shared experiences will bring them together. I recommend team dinners (even if you just all go out for pizza), bowling, team hikes, climbing gyms, etc."
lacrosse,35od2l,PM-ME-SMILES-PLZ,5,Tue May 12 09:20:52 2015 UTC,"Off the field activity builds chemistry on the field. Get together for a team BBQ, take them all bowling, to a movie, anything to get them to hang out like friends would. It will take time but eventually they will become closer. I can't really tell you why this is happening, I've been on many ""all star teams"" for summer ball where we have rivals on the team, and we have all gotten along fine after a few days of getting to know each other. Just keep doing the same stuff you are during practice, and try to organize off the field activities that will allow the kids to mesh better! Good luck this summer."
lacrosse,35od2l,demeco31,3,Tue May 12 22:06:42 2015 UTC,This is more of an idea to get them to become closer friends rather than on-field synergy. I've always made great friends on the teams I play on over the years.  Before big games we go to a teammate's house and all eat and hang out.  I would suggest maybe having it at a coach's house because it sounds like none of the players would be willing to host it.  This also gives the players' parents a chance to get friendly with one another.
lacrosse,35od2l,ThePenguin46,1 point,Tue May 12 19:32:47 2015 UTC,"It's natural. These kids have been playing with eachother but they don't socialize with eachother everyday like in school. If I was in this situation I would stick with my friends because it's who I'm comfortable with. In drills, you don't get a choice who throws you a pass, but off the field you can choose who you want to talk to. It will come in time.   To possibly speed up the process you could organize some kind of team building excercise day? No sticks, no gear, just the team and a certain set of challenges that will require them to work together to fix a situation. As long as it's fun and in good spirits then it will work.  I wish you the best- the rivalry games will be even better with these kids!"

This was possible because of the growth in the sport and allowed beginners to play against beginners and the best players to play against the best.  C division is really only for 1st and 2nd year players.  The league I coach in now has a similar setup and it gives everyone a better opportunity to enjoy the game and improve.  If the 'gold' team and other team both play in the same division then that doesn't make sense to me."

With lacrosse, due to the constant cradling, it's easy to lose sight of the ball.  I've seen something similar in football from long time ago.  On a kickoff, the receiving team would catch the ball, huddle up, and break with each player looking like he has the ball.  The kicking team in confused as it doesn't know who to tackle.  In reference to that one time I saw it in a 1987 game, Hopkins (coach Don Zimmerman) came out of a timeout and three players cradled their stick like each had the ball. Then, each shot the ball simultaneously and the goalie didn't know who was actually shooting.  Result - goal!"

Ground balls can be practiced and can also be part of a cardio routine to help that fitness level you're worried about.   Unfortunately in my experience, confidence only comes with more experience. So get out there and hit the wall for that ball handling experience, and practice dodging and picking up loose balls for cardio work outs. Maybe join a club team in the summer if you have the money and time to dedicate towards that. If you put in the hours on the wall then you should have the skills to succeed. Have fun with it man!"
lacrosse,35jpbq,henerydods,2,Mon May 11 01:27:23 2015 UTC,"Hit the wall. Use only your left hand and be constantly working on it. When you go out to shoot around or just play, use left hand only. Just get comfortable with it. Being able to pass and catch left us most important.  Go running. Easy as that. Run a mile a day, then start working your way up to multiple miles on a run. Start now, don't make excuses to not run. Don't forget to rest though.  Ground balls is just practice as well. I put the ball on the ground stand over it and pick up while just standing. I do this in my house. Couple hundred reps. Then go outside and do them at runs. Some balls will be in open field and a full sprint pick up is used. Others, you might have to dig out of a scrum. Just be prepared for all of them.   Dodging is again practice. Face dodges, spilt dodges. Just practice them when running. Take the steps and stutter steps. Get used to shooting quickly on the run when you only have a step on your defender and your hands free for a second. Quick releases on target.  And by doing all of this will give you confidence and the ability to perform under pressure. Having the skills to catch and throw, get gbs, and willingness to dodge will give you confidence to step onto the field. And if you have the shot, take it. Bury it in the back of the net bro!  And at the end of the day, its just a game. Enjoy it as much as you can."

lacrosse,35ey16,Lax-Bro,26,Sat May 9 18:39:23 2015 UTC,He is a goalie and goalies rarely score
lacrosse,35ey16,jewunit,17,Sat May 9 18:45:34 2015 UTC,I could go coast-to-coast and score on a bunch of 10 year olds and still be stoked about it. That's how much scoring as a goalie means.
lacrosse,35ey16,Happylime,5,Sat May 9 20:49:29 2015 UTC,"My entire career as a goalie all I wanted to do was score, but I never had the chance, and it was awful...(I tried like, 3 times and got as far as their box before getting laid out once.)"
lacrosse,35ey16,WoodZ941,2,Sun May 10 02:07:23 2015 UTC,"your biggest mistake was that you were trying to score. As an attackman, I've never not-scored harder than when I was really trying to score."
lacrosse,35ey16,Happylime,1 point,Sun May 10 02:40:01 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see.....so if I hadn't been trying to score it would've worked, like if I just ran up and tried to pass it to the net...."
lacrosse,35ey16,WoodZ941,1 point,Sun May 10 02:44:13 2015 UTC,"It's an attitude thing. If you get the ball and you're thinking, ""I'm going to score now,"" you probably won't. You start to force it, you overlook open teammates, and most of the time you end up just losing the ball and not even getting a shot off. You have to just play and let things come naturally.  I've probably only scored maybe 10% of the times I was really trying to. 99% of my goals have come from just playing and then all of the sudden I realize I've dodged someone and there's no one between me and the goalie, or I'm wide open in a good spot and a teammate is passing to me and I'm like, ""Oh shit, I think I'm about to score.""  Of course, it's pretty hard to even be in the position to get a shot off as a goalie if you don't already have the intention of scoring as you run down the field, which is probably another reason it's so rare."
lacrosse,35ey16,Happylime,3,Sun May 10 02:57:15 2015 UTC,"Right, that's the thing, the goalie isn't designed to be in position to score just naturally playing, it's a deliberate ""I'M GONNA SCORE"" move."
lacrosse,35ey16,PM-ME-SMILES-PLZ,-4,Sun May 10 03:40:20 2015 UTC,"Just stop. You're being ridiculous. This is nothing like scoring on 10 year olds.  1) It's the NCAA tournament.  2) It's demoralizing for the other team. Is it worth 1 point? In the book yes, but if it absolutely pumps up your entire team and crushes the heart of the other guys then it's much more valuable than 1 goal.    Any halfway decent coach would recognize that, ""coach""."
lacrosse,35ey16,jewunit,10,Sun May 10 04:43:42 2015 UTC,Yeah... You clearly missed the point.
lacrosse,35ey16,PM-ME-SMILES-PLZ,4,Sun May 10 06:30:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted. Clearly you're looking for an explanation. Let's get this out of the way first, goalies should NEVER score a goal and they should certainly NEVER score by attacking the cage. In the rare instances a goalie scores it's usally a full-field shot (like in soccer when the goalie kicks it and it bounces over the head of the other goalie) where they don't expect it to actually go in.   Albany (purple team) was up 6 before this goal. In lacrosse a 6 goal lead is really not a big lead at all. I would compare it to being down 14 in a basketball game...sure you're down, but you can be right back in it in no time if you make some stops and hit some threes. In lacrosse, you can be right back in it with some defensive stops and some faceoff wins. After a goal there is a faceoff and if your team has a good faceoff man (we call him a FOGO - face off, get off) then it's basically like playing make-it-take-it in basketball. You score, your faceoff man wins the draw, and now your offense has the ball. You score again, faceoff man wins the draw, offense has the ball again. So like basketball, lacrosse can easily turn into a game of runs. When your offense is clicking you start getting better and better while the opposing team gets more and more tired and deflated.  99% of the time when a goalie takes the ball over the midfield line he gives it up to an offensive player as soon as possible. Cornell (red team) did everything wrong here. Like most sports, the number one rule is to stop the guy with the ball. Cornell thought they had this goalie trapped with a double team. However, this goalie in particular has very good stick skills and has experience playing offense in summer leagues, he knew the quarter was nearly over, and so if there was any time to attack the cage as a goalie that was it. Think of it like soccer when the goalie comes over for a very important header. Now yes, Albany was up, but again, 6 goals is nothing.  TL;DR: Lacrosse goalies never score. A 6 goal lead is negligible. Cornell broke rule #1 - stop the guy with the ball. This play was awesome"
lacrosse,35ey16,cA05GfJ2K6,2,Sun May 10 04:36:54 2015 UTC,Awesome explanation! That really helped me appreciate the play. Thank you!
lacrosse,35ey16,MajDPearson,1 point,Sun May 10 07:38:20 2015 UTC,You got a good response to this already but I'd add that when the goalie did this cornell had just started to put together a good run of goals; it totally stopped their momentum and shut them out of the game.

lacrosse,35fh3a,RussianUnderHook,2,Sat May 9 21:08:10 2015 UTC,I think it's a goal. Soul crushing for those seniors. I think Yale had been outplaying Maryland too ever since the middle of the 2nd.

The camera angle makes it look like it may have gone in, just like in baseball the camera angle makes a pitch look like it's a little more left or right than it actually is.  Not to mention the flat pipes on the bottom of a heavy net would not bounce the ball straight out - the ball would hit off the flat bar and right into the net.  Third point is the lead official is in correct position - right on GLE, if the ball actually crossed the goal line, he would have seen it."

lacrosse,35gsoo,yungcurt,2,Sun May 10 05:46:58 2015 UTC,It can be. Shooters can get used to avoiding high-right and used to hitting high-left. Put a left handed goalie in there and it can mess some guys up. Others can make the mental switch easily. So it depends on the player.

Albany is looking good this year and I'm still loving them with Lyle Thompson. 2 other games I would like to see if the Duke and Denver game both are my favourite teams to watch I feel like that would be a shootout of a game a lot of scoring, also the Maryland and North Carolina would be a great game to watch with Marylands defence on point this year and North Carolina's offensive.

lacrosse,35ccpm,demeco31,2,Fri May 8 23:38:01 2015 UTC,Oh yeah I'm not going to sleep on Ohio state this tournament but they did get shut out by Norte dame but hey Jessie king can pull a upset this week.

lacrosse,35ccpm,Mdtweed,2,Sat May 9 00:52:41 2015 UTC,That was quite a win last night. They just crushed the spirit right out of the champs.

lacrosse,35cw37,BastTheFae,4,Sat May 9 02:24:15 2015 UTC,"Another option is to look for ""masters"" leagues in your area. They are for older men (think 40+) but are typically very welcoming of newcomers to the sport who are older than youth league age. Typically slower and non contact (because of the age), but a great place to get started before jumping into a more competitive men's league. I have seen 2 people here in Canada play in masters for a year or two before jumping into men's league and it was great for them. Plus you don't get better teachers anywhere else."
lacrosse,35cw37,henerydods,2,Sat May 9 15:30:13 2015 UTC,Just join a men's league but work on your stick skills. As long as you can pass and catch than it should be fine
lacrosse,35cw37,max3145,2,Sat May 9 06:20:17 2015 UTC,"I think you'll find that lacrosse players tend to be pretty cool about getting new people into the game. The pickup league that I play in here in south jersey is chock full of guys who never played before who got into the game because their kids play.  Relative fitness and stick skills are things you can work on on your own. Honestly, if you're strong with those, it's a very easy game to pick up and a difficult one to master. If you've ever played competitive basketball, you'll pick up how offenses are constructed pretty fast, too."

lacrosse,35cxyv,Kjlax11,2,Sat May 9 02:43:32 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same position as you, being from the Midwest. I don't know about knee braces. If the guy wins the clamp clean and still chooses to go back there is not a whole lot you can do. If the go forward you can try to put your body where he is putting it though."
lacrosse,35cxyv,WornKey,1 point,Sat May 9 03:30:35 2015 UTC,"This, the way I coach this is you have to do your best to cut him off from beating you 'over the top.' If he pulls it behind that is the responsibility of the wings to contest. Just don't get suckered into not defending the pop because he always goes behind. A good face off man is as much chess grand master as much as he is guy with a great clamp."
lacrosse,35cxyv,newswilson,2,Sat May 9 04:13:49 2015 UTC,I come from a family of FOGOs in multiple sports. My dad was a expert hockey face off professional. My brother and I are both FOGOs with my win % being about 85% and his being around 70% if you have questions please message me. Remember that face offs aren't just about you! I set my wings up how I want them every single time. I also coach face offs at a local high school near me! My team had a 80% face off win percentage! So if you are stuck and need some help I would be glad to help you! I can make you videos on moves and exercises to practice so you can be a surprise to your team!

lacrosse,35cxyv,Zoos27,1 point,Sat May 9 22:20:06 2015 UTC,"If you're getting beat on the clamp regularly your have a few options.   Concede the clamp, don't even bother trying for it, and just beat him to the ball when/where he pulls it. As he's winning the clamp slide your stick beneath his and lift ... hard. If you do this quickly enough you'll dislodge the ball and will be able to pick up the gb. Carefully and quickly kick your foot under, not through, his stick to impede the ball when he pulls it. Talk to your wingmen. Tell them to front their opposing wingmen with their sticks, and to haul a$$, to give your team an advantage."

lacrosse,35902g,A_Crazy_Hooligan,1 point,Fri May 8 03:10:01 2015 UTC,Middie actually looks like my best option on those terms but we have so many middies. I could play LSM and i think i might try that out
lacrosse,35902g,iWishiWasFast,4,Fri May 8 11:48:36 2015 UTC,"My advice would be stay the hell away from lsm. If you wanna play lsm give yourself at least one season close d.  I went from middie to lsm. It wasn't as easy of a transition as you think. Also, is your conditioning and field vision up to par? The main offensive aspect of lsm is transition. Do you clear the ball often now on attack? Probably not as much. Add that too the list too. I'm not trying to be a dick, lsm just isn't an easy job and most people think it's just another position. It's super hard to play. There is a reason a team has about 1-2 max usually."

lacrosse,35902g,newswilson,2,Thu May 14 21:36:30 2015 UTC,Maybe try long stick middie if your coach swings that way. It can be a ton of fun just get good at being a wing for faceoffs and work on the stick skills.

lacrosse,358kf3,BearGryllsUrine,1 point,Fri May 8 19:40:53 2015 UTC,"3 minute shifts seem very long for a midfielder.  Ask your coach to take shorter shifts if possible.  You won't be on the field for as long each shift, but you will take more shifts.  A shift should only really consist of one offensive possession, playing defense if you can't sub off for the LSM or a D-middie, and then coming off the field.  When your team loses possession, try to find their LSM or short stick D-middie and run off the field with them so that your team can sub and you can get a break."
lacrosse,358kf3,harrynelson,1 point,Fri May 8 11:22:04 2015 UTC,"We are a small Lacrosse team, with only 2 lines for midfield. The longest shift for me was 7 minutes, which I had a chance to go grab water, then play attack for the rest of the period. Our team is in Canada so in our division, we are the worst team as we have the fewest players, and only a certain amount of us have played more than 3 years."

I'm not sure if the coach is still forming a team this year, but I definitely suggest taking a look online.

lacrosse,358dtj,ghettowaffle88,2,Thu May 7 23:28:27 2015 UTC,"That shaft costs $80 brand new, if it has been through a rough season or two you might just want to buy new. As far as heads go, I would recommend going to a store in your area and seeing what a starter head with strings would cost. Most guys aren't going to sell a head that they could use as a backup."
lacrosse,358dtj,TheJonosaurusRex,2,Fri May 8 03:15:25 2015 UTC,"50 isn't too bad for that shaft if its not too beat up. I'd pay 25-40 for a used one in my area, but, like I said, 50 is not bad if it doesn't any obvious dents, bends or cracks.    Personally, I would do the evo 4x. But, I know plenty of people who like the stallion.  Tbh, if you're beginning, the head and shaft you have doesn't matter much.  The stringing does matter, though.  Ask your coach or a more experienced player if your mesh is good and make sure it throws well.  I've seen a lot of beginners have an unnecessarily difficult time because they are using a stick with way too much whip and just can't throw.    I'd start out at 20 for the head and not pay more than 50.  Like I said, the head and shaft for a beginner is not that important.  If you continue to play, your head will be very important and you'll obsess over it, but the important thing now is that you practice.  You could probably get a a begginners full stick at your local sporting good store (ie Dick's) on the cheap.  Guys may tease you for having one of those beginner sticks but really it doesn't matter as long as it throws well.  Moral of the story: just make sure you make sure you have good stringing.  And I wouldn't pay more than an $100 for combo of shaft and head."
lacrosse,358dtj,UFGator8,2,Fri May 8 05:09:57 2015 UTC,Thanks guys for the insight! Ended up paying $100 total. I ended up with the EVO 4 and its in great shape as is the shaft. But it definitely needs to get re-strung.

lacrosse,356nnm,umans1,3,Thu May 7 15:30:48 2015 UTC,When defending from x you kind of have to run a step behind the guy to avoid the rollback but then be able to explode in front of them. However this is what they want you to do when they run up field. Just continue to play their hips and run with them but don't over commit to the top side. If you are constantly riding their hip then you will feel the momentum change and you can start to push hard or get a check in to disrupt their motion.   You just have to be concious of your momentum and ability to stop on a dime with these guys.
lacrosse,356nnm,msupz,3,Thu May 7 15:37:47 2015 UTC,"I'll let you in on a little secret. As a major user of the question mark from X, the way to beat it is with a double. If your opposing team has a wing player, have the guy covering the wing player sloughed all the way in, by the island. If the sloughed in defender is sitting by the island, the guy won't even attempt to dodge. This would be if they are running a 1-3-2 with wing attackmen, a 2-3-1 with midfielders at the wings, or a 1-4-1 with outside wing shooters. (I count from X, like everyone should.) If they are in 2-2-2 wide and you have AJ sliding assignments then he can still slough but you'll have to be careful as there will not be a crease presence to protect you like the other sets.  If they run a 2-2-2 tight (no wing play) and there are 2 guys on the crease, you can have your enforcer sit on the crease to cover both crease men, and send the other man to the island, ready to slide either to the question mark dodge, or back to the crease should he force it inside. A box and 2 string defense or a 5 man rotation + lock can also be used (since you don't dodge a zone and he would be running into a low post man on GLE along with the center string defenseman covering him at X, and if you are locking off the guy who always uses the question mark and deny him the ball you don't have to worry about him beating you if he can't get the ball.)  There are a lot of ways to defense a good question mark but none of them are 1v1. All entail help and good team defense."
lacrosse,356nnm,theheadcoach,1 point,Fri May 8 07:24:18 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea about having the wing defender slough. So vs 1-3-2 who is responsible for the wing attack if he back doors his D man and gets a pass, the high middie on that side? I'm assuming so. Makes sense."
lacrosse,356nnm,NewYorkerinGeorgia,1 point,Sat May 9 15:03:28 2015 UTC,Topside middy would be the help since he has no slide responsibility in a crease sliding defense where the 2 is diagonally opposite the ball (technically he would be 3 or 4 slide but 99% of the time a goal is going to occur before you get to the 4th man in the rotation if you're beat) but it also depends on the backdoor cutter. Crease guy may have to show/enforcer uses the hammer.
lacrosse,356nnm,theheadcoach,1 point,Sat May 9 23:37:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I figured. I've done it from crease usually, but that work work. Crease can brought. I've also done it from backside D, that's a longer slide and requires a second slide from the backside middie. But I like your way better."
lacrosse,356nnm,NewYorkerinGeorgia,2,Sun May 10 00:31:36 2015 UTC,"Depends, do they gave big outside shooters? Or are they running into the middle and shooting?"
lacrosse,356nnm,thelaxative,2,Thu May 7 15:42:35 2015 UTC,got to keep the stick upfield to protect the inside and keep the hands to the hips so when they start the roll to the outside you can push them off and prevent the forward momentum. keep that stick under the elbow so when he comes up for the shot you can lift. momentum pushed away + elbows up from the lift = shot well over the goal

lacrosse,356nnm,Marconan,2,Thu May 7 17:39:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other posts talking about how to defend a question mark with good one v one defense. But as far as team defense goes, right as the offensive player starts to cross the GLE, a coma slide should be sent from the opposite side of the crease. Good team play is the best way to prevent the close shots."
lacrosse,356nnm,Dab_Reif17,2,Fri May 8 01:11:58 2015 UTC,"This may not be what you're looking for but the best way IMO is to stop them from getting the opportunity in the first place.  When they drive from x, do your best to (1) turn the attackman back to the inside at GLE where the coma slide will come and limit the opportunity or (2) force them far enough towards the sideline so they don't have the angle on the shot."
lacrosse,356nnm,UFGator8,1 point,Fri May 8 04:12:55 2015 UTC,"These are in order.  Option 1: prevent him from passing GLE. Hard against a good attack, but it's your first objective.  Option 2: force him to his opposite hand. A clever attack will make his first move with his off hand, then use his main hand after that, but most HS guys aren't this smart, and few attack like dodging from X with their off hand. Or, just force him the way YOU want. X dodging is tough because eh can go either way. Force him one way, know that way, and you've just made your life 50% easier.  Option 3: if he passes GLE, stay in his hips and force him out wide so he has no angle  Option 4: if he gets high with an angle, keep pushing him in the direction he's going so he can't turn  Option 5: if he gets position, feel his hips and when he turns, flip your stick over his head to disrupt the shot. It's a long shot, but it's all you have.  Option 6: early slide from crease. If he's constantly beating his defender, this is essential. Backside defender needs to be in position for a quick second slide. This is tic-tac-toe lacrosse, really close play with a lot of bodies in a small space. Everyone has to have their act together.  Option 7: in HS my goalie and I always played X dodges with me shutting off GLE but leave the inside roll open. My goalie would step out and crush the guy when he made the inside move. This takes teamwork and communication, but if you can pull it off then they stop dodging from X pretty quick."
lacrosse,356nnm,NewYorkerinGeorgia,1 point,Fri May 8 13:25:52 2015 UTC,"once you see the turn of the question mark, at the top of this turn the attackman is at his most vulnerable state and is often only on one foot. drive the hip and force him back. much easier said than done"

lacrosse,354rze,honeybunches96,3,Thu May 7 02:33:58 2015 UTC,"You need to force them to the outside, preferably to their weak hand, reducing chance of a shot. To do this you want to make one side (their bad side) easier to go to. Say a right hander is coming down, you want to turn slightly right and move left of center, forcing him to switch hands and go to his left rather than run into you with his stick easily accessible. Also do not look at his eyes as a good player can easily pass or shoot without looking, look at his hips, because thats where the direction changes actually happen, and you'll be able to guess where he's going much more accurately. Keep your stick up and try to slow him down and he will pass it off if there's no chance. If you get beat your teammate should be there to slide so ideally you will move to the uncovered man as he picks him up. Ask your coach though because obviously if you're on varsity you should know this stuff. Good luck"
lacrosse,354rze,brogen,3,Thu May 7 03:05:32 2015 UTC,"Only addition to this great post would be - DRIVE HIS HIPS. Stick checks are for 3+ feet away; as the offense dodges into you - engage with your gloves into the player's hips and drive him to the outside/alley/corners. If you get beat look for the ""hanging stick check"" and then recover because your slide should be on its way."
lacrosse,354rze,EducatedGenus,1 point,Thu May 7 03:38:42 2015 UTC,"Agree with everything said and ditto on driving the hips.  Another thing to consider is your team defense as a whole.  If you know you are going to have trouble, make sure the rest of your defense knows (especially the goalie) so you can bring the slide/help early.  In general, my team will always slides early when the offense is trying to iso.   Don't be afraid to say you need help.  It's all about keeping the other team from scoring, not looking good."
lacrosse,354rze,UFGator8,2,Fri May 8 04:31:44 2015 UTC,"Always move your feet and defend the inside rather than the outside. If your opponent is within stick length (six feet), you have the time and (lack of) room to counter a dodge with a body check. If you can legally hit him (his back isn't turned), do it: put your gloves into his hips and drive."

Mostly, it is over how amateur the athletes should be, and which forms of compensation are fair vs which are cheating. I find the whole thing insane, and I hate the NCAA for making schools money off the pretext of amateurism. But that's just me."
lacrosse,352c4f,teslasmash,1 point,Wed May 6 14:55:04 2015 UTC,"I would really recommend getting to a local lax store to try some stuff on, different brands/styles. I have noticed a slight difference in sizing across different brands, which in today's game means a significant difference in fit. For example, 13"" Warrior gloves are slightly bigger than the 13"" Maverick gloves. In terms of arm/elbow pads I think you just need to determine if you want better protection (something with more forearm protection) or just enough to keep you elbows from getting messed up. In recent years of playing and coaching I have seen more and more cases of guys getting forearm injuries due to the minimal coverage of some of the newer pads. Then again padding also depends on what type of player you are, do you bowl guys over while running through contact or do you try and finesse your way down the field with smooth fakes and dodges. I will definitely say that the stick game has come a long way in the past few years, so depending on how old your stick is, definitely look at that as a solid investment. And whatever you do, dont get rib pads, those just dont look good on anyone over 12!"
lacrosse,352c4f,WhiteyLax,2,Wed May 6 15:58:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I am definitely getting some hands-on before buying. I'm more likely to finesse my way down field than to bowl through, and given the situation, I'm going to look for better forearm coverage.  On the stick, I have an old Warrior ""Finalizer"" and a c405 shaft. What would you say has changed in the past few years?"
lacrosse,352c4f,WhiteyLax,2,Wed May 6 16:12:47 2015 UTC,"weight, pinch, and especially sidewall holes allowing for more stringing options. if you are comfortable with the finalizer, then maybe stick with it as it isn't THAT old. i had a buddy try playing summer league with his stick from 15 years ago and he couldnt figure out why he couldnt get the ball loose on checks until he realized that the pinched throats have changed the game significantly."

lacrosse,34zeqg,TheJonosaurusRex,2,Tue May 5 21:22:51 2015 UTC,"want my best piece of advice: reps. there should really never be a time at practice when the kids are standing around watching or doing nothing. If you want to run a demo, do it with a sense of urgency, maybe one slow one to give them the explanation and then one live action one, then break at let them do it themselves and figure it out. Every practice should be high tempo.  Run multiple sets of the same drill to prevent kids from doing nothing.  Defense: sit in your chair Offense: always be a threat, dodge to score, move your feet or someone will move them for you (a boxlax saying)"
lacrosse,34zeqg,harroldhino,1 point,Wed May 6 12:59:26 2015 UTC,It all really depends on the age of the kids including some of the rules. But of course the fundamentals at any level are ground balls and stickwork. It also helps to think of the offense almost like basketball in the way that the plays and motions are run with the obvious difference of being able to play behind at X.
lacrosse,34zeqg,darthsparkle,1 point,Tue May 5 23:43:31 2015 UTC,"Try to find a good assistant coach and find the leaders on the team. These people will help you a lot. I have coached before. The most important things to me as a coach are picking up loose balls, protecting ball possession, defensive footwork, and pass/catch on the run. If you can nail these things, you'll be a good lacrosse team. You'll also need a goalie with nerves of steel and a few guys that can beat defenders and shoot the ball effectively both left and right."

lacrosse,34yrlo,stewward,3,Tue May 5 17:58:39 2015 UTC,"If you're shooting, most of your grip should be centered on your bottom hand. Literally the best way to practice this would be to try do it up on a wall or a goal. Here's the best I've got...  Start by just shooting, get comfortable with your form and get warmed up. Once you've put a couple shots on goal, start twisting your bottom hand as you're in the wind up. It might be weird at first because the weight is so far back and your wrist might not be accustomed to it. if you want to strengthen it, try just holding your stick like it is in the picture, drop your top hand, and just twist the stick. It seems pretty basic, but it's should help you out."
lacrosse,34yrlo,Camoman37,3,Tue May 5 18:08:25 2015 UTC,"if im understanding correct, this is more of a box-style of play (or where it originated; doubt its exclusive to indoor now) and the huge advantage is in the ability to cut and to play one-handed (which is fairly taboo in field lacrosse.  rightly so!).  box players will often pass backhanded instead of switching hands, properly.  its an advanced technique because it requires some ""improper"" fundamentals like side-arm passing.  the top hand is still the ""control"" hand and does the cradle and passing adjustments... im a bit out of the game, but i dont think anyone teaches bottom hand cradling (a small amount happens naturally, but it was always been a huge no-no when i played and later coached.).  the power comes form the bottom hand (and your legs and waist).  it may look cool and have some function at the high-end, but stick with the fundamentals until this stuff happens naturally.  which brings my answer, ive never known a player to ""practice"" this technique... so i wouldnt know how to teach it!  i only teach fundamentals and feel this stuff is the flair a player develops on their own.  sorry for the rambling non-answer!"
lacrosse,34yrlo,SapienChavez,2,Tue May 5 20:17:55 2015 UTC,"That's funny because in Canada this is a fundamental technique. It's advantages are HUGE when you look at the speed of the indoor game, and it translates very well into the outdoor game. Like someone commented higher up, it's the triple threat possition, a player can run, pass, or shoot from that position without having to do any sort of transition with their stick. We stress that if you can have your stick by your ear, keep it there. Only drop the stick if you need to protect it against a defender, and try to never one hand cradle like American field players do (I was under the impression that Americans played one handed much much more often than Canadians, we are known for our 2 handed power cradle after all), it's usually better to keep the stick in both hands. It's always better to be able to pass, shoot, or dodge at an instant.  Now how do we do the cradle by the ear exactly (of which OP's picture is the same idea, just dropped ever so slightly and it appears he is about to shoot or pass)? It's a combination of both the bottom and top hand. I personally know that I'm very bottom hand heavy when I do it, and I see some guys who do it much more top hand heavy, but at the end of the day everyone uses a combination of both hands. The key is to not over grip your stick, keep your grip ""loose"". If you ever played badminton or squash and was taught how to grip the racquet, we grip our lacrosse sticks much the same way. Most of lacrosse cradling doesn't come from the wrist alone, it comes from a combination of subtle grip, wrist, and arm movements. This combines to that fluid motion you see the pros use when they have their stick by their ears.   Now personally I can do it with both my bottom and top hands, and to the eye the cradle looks no different. This is advantages depending on how I want to approach different situation, and needs to be learned not really taught. Just need to do what comes naturally to you. Although it's traditionally taught to be done with mostly your top hand.  The best way to describe it is it's like a 1/4 of a fake. When you fake you use your top hand, you close your grip, and you twist your wrist ever so slightly. Do that, but to a lesser extent. Keeping the stick behind your head and body keeps it protected from defenders and in that ever so important ready position. This is a very important and fundamental position in the Canadian game and I don't see why you guys couldn't add it to your game."
lacrosse,34yrlo,henerydods,2,Tue May 5 23:56:26 2015 UTC,"In the girls game we have something similar to this that we refer to as triple threat position where we can shoot, cradle or move to protect the ball. Really all it is is practice. I would also think it's your top hand working, not your bottom."

If you have a local lax shop, ignore everything I said. Go there, tell them what you told us and they should take care of you.  Also pick up some cheap lacrosse gloves if you can, even and especially as a beginner. Most kids try just the stick first and it's difficult to transition to how slow your hands feel at first in anything but top level gloves with a lot of articulation, which can be quite pricey."

lacrosse,34ryfc,mygingersoul,3,Mon May 4 07:09:24 2015 UTC,Well considering that the shooters barely recognize shot placement or even have the accuracy to deal with it it actually turns out pretty fair. It also means no transition when switching to high school when it comes to positioning.
lacrosse,34ryfc,jewunit,1 point,Mon May 4 17:50:59 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't agree with the transition part, which will happen well before high school, but if the scoring isn't outrageous then it works. Pretty sure I played on a 4x4 at that age, maybe a 5x5. So long ago."

lacrosse,34ryfc,Katsuichi,1 point,Mon May 4 20:57:53 2015 UTC,Yeah I coach little guys sometimes and have two of my own who are 7. The goal could be 10x10 and scores would not be that high.   The biggest issue is getting the ball cean out of the scrum and getting shots. Plus as said above if it is around the goalies hips or higher it will likely get blocked.   I've seen U9 on full field with full size goals though I think half field 6 on 6 is the way t go at that age.

lacrosse,34t8js,SCUBA100,5,Mon May 4 11:03:36 2015 UTC,"When body checking you really want to go for the hips. Its where most of our weight is. So use your guys weight against him. Stay in position and keep pushing. The hips, not the chest, will tell you where he's headed. Its a lot harder to hide your path if you look at hips.  Honestly, I never threw many stick checks unless the guy was dangling his stick and it was an easy take away. I play a more physical body game. The poke check is one I use more than anything though. Aim for where the rib cage comes together. If done right it'll take a lot of their momentum away. Then I usually play a solid body game. That's my style. I have nevr had a coach complain to me. I didn't throw as many pokes in high school and they're a useful tool. Just dont poke and lunge."
lacrosse,34t8js,A_Crazy_Hooligan,2,Mon May 4 17:05:03 2015 UTC,"Stick checks or body checks? I assume stick? If so, ask him what you're doing wrong. Are you not throwing enough checks? Are they not connecting? Are you hitting guys on the head too much? Ask your coach what you are doing wrong. Then we can help you correct it."
lacrosse,34t8js,NewYorkerinGeorgia,2,Mon May 4 11:51:41 2015 UTC,"Most coaches are going to confuse ""throwing better checks,"" with being more aggressive. Without knowing exactly what you are doing wrong, no coach who knows anything about defense will tell you to go there and just throw a high volume of checks, it only leads to you getting beat. What they want in general is for you to go out under control, and just harass the gloves with simple poke and lift checks, maybe a slap once in a while. Practice being close enough to your man when he is adjacent to be able to get on his hands by the time he catches the ball. Don't over commit, but make him uncomfortable. At the JV level that will be enough to cause a ton of turnovers"
lacrosse,34t8js,demeco31,1 point,Mon May 4 19:01:52 2015 UTC,"I firmly agree with this. As a defensive player and a coach, there is nothing more important for myself or my players to do than harass the crap out of the opponent with poke checks. By aiming for the bottom hand, you will rarely have a ""whiff"" which is where you poke and just hit air, not the player. The bottom hand is usually going to be in front of the player's hips or gut, so if you miss his actual hand, you will still make contact with the player himself. If you do it right, he will at most get the wind knocked out of him, and at least get the message that he can't get past you. Poke checks are more effective than slap checks due to this reason.   Occasionally, you can get a lift out of it too. Any decent lacrosse player should have the intimate connection with their stick to realize when any weight is connected to it; you need to be aware of when you have a guys hand or butt of his stick in your head. As soon as you feel that, your immediate reaction should be to lift your stick up and over his head so he gets thrown off balance and loses the ball. Best case scenario with this, you could flip a guy completely over or just get a yard sale. When lifting, just be careful that you aren't going to hit his helmet, as refs can call this penalty a lot.  Hope this helped and added on to the description of /u/demeco31 if you want more don't hesitate to ask"
lacrosse,34t8js,Camoman37,1 point,Tue May 5 17:54:43 2015 UTC,"If you are talking stick checks, focus on the attackers bottom hand. If you time your checks right and lift up on their bottom hand just before they go to pass/shoot they won't be able to throw properly and the ball often comes loose. If you're talking about body checks I agree with /u/Razor and would say focus on their chest and it will tell you the direction the person will go, then time your check properly to get them off balance."

lacrosse,34sev9,That1Attackmen,1 point,Mon May 4 04:21:24 2015 UTC,"As a bigger guy, try to work on building mass so that you can use do things like back a defender in and role, question mark or inside roll. Another thing you can do if the slides are coming early is to work on your crossover step and feeding either the crease or backside. Here is an example of a textbook question mark on the run, https://vine.co/v/OYLxYVwdjYn . And an example of a crossover step done well. https://youtu.be/zzGJRgZPy5c?t=58. In the second clip you can see the slide start to come, create space behind the sliding defender and Kevin see him and uses the step to give him room to make the feed."
lacrosse,34sev9,demeco31,1 point,Mon May 4 04:54:24 2015 UTC,"As a defender, nothing gets me more off balance than a guy with good fakes. Not just one good fake, but multiple. Even in practice, there's this one kid who can beat me every time because he throws the widest variety of fake passes, shots, and dodges that I never know what to expect. If I were you, I'd try to learn a few solid fakes and try implementing them when you're already pulling him out. Rolling is one thing, but getting a guy to commit and fumble over a good fake is not only a necessary technique to excel in the sport, it's also going to look super dirty.  Another thing you could focus on would be improving your passes. Like I said earlier, rolling and scoring is great and all, but you can get points for getting assists as well. This is a team sport, so don't be afraid to get your teammates involved. If you could get to the point where every pass you throw lands in a teammates stick, you will soon find that you can thread even the tightest of needle-passes on the field. Not much is more frustrating (as a defender) than a guy who can get a pass through you and your buddies even when you are closely packed in a zone blocking all the passing lanes.  Hope this helps!"
lacrosse,34sev9,Camoman37,1 point,Tue May 5 18:04:16 2015 UTC,"I'll be captain obvious but you need to add another move to repertoire. Something easy is one I teach lots of my faster youth offensive players which is a simple change of pace speed dodge. To use it there is no need to draw them out wide, just bait the hook by being constantly in motion with or without the ball at a light jog on the bals of your feet.   Once you lull the close defender to sleep explode by him strong side and go to the goal. Once he tightens up to body you then you jog him out and go to your bread and butter. Well executed change of pace can be executed easily no matter the stick skills if your are fit and disciplines enough to keep moving at constant jog.   Be the cobra, set the defender up for the strike."

If they sold the rights to the specific games that were televised it wouldn't have been so bad, but tsn's online coverage had been so bad that it's actually hurting the NLL brand. I was in the same boat as you trying to watch the Calgary/Vancouver game and I couldn't watch any of it. I hope to god they put a clause in next year where they say ""if you don't withhold a certain level of standard, we will pull your rights and not refund you.""

lacrosse,34mbam,Scuba98,4,Sat May 2 13:11:47 2015 UTC,"I always tried to find the fun in it again. If you're having fun it's all worth it. All of the hard work, the trials and tribulations, the bruises, blood, sweat, and tears are worth it. I would also find one thing to focus on everyday to improve. When I saw improvement in that one aspect of my game, I felt fulfilled and I could say ""today was a good day"". Over a week, that builds into a tidal wave of success that will carry into the next game.  It also helps if you feel successful about something outside of lacrosse. If you go on a great date with a girl you like, that's a W. If you do well on that test or paper you worked hard for, that's a W. If you crushed your piano recital, that's a W. Sports is a great equalizer in that it can help you forget or get the right mindset about the rest of your life but I believe that it can work the other way as well.  Best of luck in the last stretch of the season! My team went 0-5 for the first couple games when I started playing goalie sophomore year. I was learning and the seniors weren't TOO hard on me but I could tell they were frustrated. We ended up 8-9 that year, 9-6 the following year, and 12-5 the final year. I am so incredibly happy I stuck with it. I ended up getting the opportunity to play in college in one of the toughest D3 leagues and I actually got to make a difference for my team. Pick your head up, keep truckin, and always remember that every day is a gift to play this beautiful sport of ours. Not only that, but you get to play goalie. We're the smartest, most athletic, toughest sons of guns out there on the field, plus we pull the best looking (enter preference here). We crush it on and off the field in all aspects of life. Welcome to the club and we hope you'll stick around for a bit because amazing things can happen with some hard work and a bunch of ice packs."
lacrosse,34mbam,sbarrettm,2,Sat May 2 14:34:20 2015 UTC,"First, Tell your coaches to quit the shooting gallery on you, it's not helping... (geez!)     Have you ever been seriously injured from a shot? If not don't anticipate injury. Try and turn that flinch reaction into something positive and instead react to the shot.     You're the most important person on that field, you're going to have off games which get amplified by the score on the board.  But it's in the past, don't think about it again, your next game is an opportunity to put yourself back on track!     The coaches will not be too concerned by a bad game, they will be concerned on how you react the next game. Please don't slack your team needs you, and sounds like you're a quality goalie!!!"
lacrosse,34mbam,dawtcalm,1 point,Sat May 2 14:17:36 2015 UTC,"It's important to have a consistent warm up routine.  Drilling the different positions at less than full speed shots builds that muscle memory as well as your confidence.  This is most helpful with a goalie coach that can constantly give you feedback on your form and technique.    We all had those annoying teammates that would regularly take poorly placed shots, with no angle, as hard as they can.  Any good coach should yell at a kid for taking dumb shots like that, particularly on your own goalie.  I tell my team all the time on inside shots placement is much more important than power.  Also, goalies shouldn't be target practice for shooting drills.    In terms of games and confidence, again a regular pregame routine is helpful in getting yourself mentally and physically ready.  During a game having a short term memory is important.  I always try to keep my focus on what is happening now rather than what just happened.  Your defense should look to you as a leader.  Controlling your frustration or doubts even when you are struggling, and communicating to your defenders will build everyone's confidence."

Regarding the part about getting pelted, I've lost confidence with it when I was younger, the best thing is to take a breather for a bit, or just do something small that's easy to build your confidence back up.

If you are really fast any narrow head will work for you but if you're slower a non flexible head will let you bully others. I recommend the Og blade of course, m80, and Nike CEO. If you get the m80 make sure to get the college spec because it will warp inwards quickly."
lacrosse,34kidx,TypicalSnake,1 point,Sat May 2 00:21:58 2015 UTC,"The Brine Clutch X started off as a fairly stiff head, but definitely got much more flexible with only a few weeks of breaking in. It warps in an amazing way to allow for squeezing the ball, also flicking the ball very well. It's also worth mentioning the amount of stringing holes this head has. You could probably put just about any pocket you may want on this head (those I use a mid-high) and it wouldn't be much of a hassle. Not sure what level you're playing at, but I definitely prefer X-Spec heads to HS and NCAA in general. It gives a nice pinch around the throat that other heads don't quite have and keeps everything where I like it. But of course, this is just opinion.    Hope I was helpful in any way!"

If you were on my team in that position, I would have no problem with you saying, ""I have x."" However, a more appropriate call would be ""I have ball"".  If you're covering the offensive player behind the goal and he doesn't have the ball, simply call your position in relation to the ball's current location. ""I'm one"" or ""I'm two""."

lacrosse,34gte6,sexy_butter_beast,8,Fri May 1 00:58:17 2015 UTC,"I don't really agree with what he's saying. Yeah, sure, if the shot is going to be so far over that stepping out isn't going to make the save, then don't step out. But then you're not really stepping to the ball if you're not getting to the ball, are you? I guess I get what he's saying, but it seems like it's really just addressing a certain situation. Steps should be a combination of out and lateral. You don't just step forward, because that isn't stepping to the ball.  He also talks about it shortening the amount of time you have to make the save. The time changed is in all likelihood negligible. It seems more like something to throw in just to make the argument stronger but one that doesn't really have an impact. Not long after he mentions how you don't want to step backward, but wouldn't that give you even more time?  So you step laterally to get to the ball as fast as possible. All of this seems to ignore that when you step out you are cutting off the angle, which means you don't have to get as far laterally to meet the ball. ""The T-square proves you do not want to step to the ball"". No, you didn't prove shit.  ""We don't base things on the rarity, not the majority"". Okay. The majority of the time an outward step will cover enough ground to get to the ball.  Lastly, attacking the ball is very much a mental thing as well."
lacrosse,34gte6,jewunit,6,Fri May 1 01:44:05 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between stepping to the ball and stepping to the shooter, one happens after the shot and the other before (in the correct situation). For some reason I feel like this guy thinks stepping to the ball means stepping straight towards the shooter (I know he doesn't, but I feel like he's trying to imply that just for this argument).   As you said, stepping to the ball takes away angle and he didn't demonstrate that aspect at all. Take a picture from shooters stick perspective and you can demonstrate that so incredibly well. First picture is of the stick on GLE in the top right corner, and see how much net it covers in terms of %. Second picture is a step and a half out, with the stick in the top right corner to see how much the net is covered and you well see that it covers a much much large % of the net, and if we are talking averages and %s, that's how you make saves, not giving yourself an extra 0.005 seconds to react to the shot.   Let's do the math on that, usually stepping to the ball+the half step you are out already puts you about 1step (or about 1m) away from GLE. Shots can come on at 90miles an hour at the highest of high school level, but let's go pro, let's talk Paul Rable with time and room at about 110miles an hour. That's about 175 km/h (for sake of easier math I'm doing it in metric, and because I'm Canadian), which is about 50m/s. To travel  1m at 50m/s (110mph) it would take all of 0.02 seconds. Is that negligible? Well the average human reaction time to a ball approaching a human is about 0.25 seconds according to Google. So you're adding all of 8% of your reaction time to the time you have to make the save. That's a pretty damn small %, and if we compare that to the angle taken away from stepping to the ball I bet you stepping to the ball wins.   Actually I have the perfect solution to how he screwed up that T-square thing. The problem is he has two parallel lines coming off the post straight up the middle of the field. What he should have is two converging lines that intersect at the shooters stick, exactly where he would release the ball out of his stick. This gives a true perspective on the angles, and what is ""square"" the the line.   I actually do a similar thing to this to demonstrate angles to young kids playing box, and it works really really well with the box goalie standing there because he consumes so much space that it's impossible to not see it in this ""drill"". I get a really really long piece of string or rope (from Home Depot or wherever, we all have one somewhere) and I tie each end to a post (opposite posts) I then pull the middle of the rope so that it makes a triangle with the net. This is where the term angle comes from to me. In box I like to have the top point of the triangle (where I'm holding the string) at or just above the the ""house"" line (there is usually an arch on the ground of a box lacrosse floor, I think it's 5m in radius? It does nothing more than provide a point of reference), in field you can go further than 5m (15ft is about 5m so it might work). Now I take all my kids, with the goalie in the net, and show them what angles look like and how the goalie can take away those angles. So what I do is start in the very top centre, and I show them that the goalie would need to come out of his net very very far to take away the whole net from a shooter (a very wide angle), then I start taking a few steps away towards the boards, along the arch of the house. This narrows the angle, and the goalie now doesn't need to come out as far to take away 100% of the angle, then I walk even further along the arch, slowly showing them how it's taking away angle from yourself   Here is an album to hopefully help demonstrate angles when it comes to shooting  I then use the same demonstration to talk about having eyes in your stick. This is a term we use in box which means that your stick can see angles that your eyes can't see. It's a pretty simple concept that has to do with a shooters ""circle of attack"". The circle of attack is all the release points around a shooter that he can throw the ball from (think left handed side arm vs left handed over hand shot vs right handed over hand shot vs right handed side arm creating a big arch or ""circle of attack).  This demonstrates to both the players and the goalie that the goalie needs to take angle away from the stick, not the players eyes. We call this playing the stick  and not the player.   Anyway, after coming all the way back around the the T square, using this same demonstration we can now see the fastest way to the ""save"" is now not completely laterally, but slightly forward. This is the fastest way if you are 100% sure where that ball is going, but let's be honest, nobody can pinpoint that shot perfectly. This is why we step slightly forward towards the ball a bit, to take away angle, to make the save easier for ourselves.   In Canada we have two very strong sayings when it comes to attack and to goal tending. We say ""take high percentage shots"" and ""make high percentage saves."" This means you don't take a shot unless it's from a good angle and you place it in high percentage areas (bouncing around the feet, along the lower posts, etc.). For goal tending that means taking up as much room as possible, make the shot difficult to make. We aren't making the save by stopping the ball directly, we make saves by taking up area and blocking areas that 95% of shooters shoot to. It's the reason Mr. Ward rocked it so much in worlds for team Canada. Dudes a beast that ""takes up space"" even without his box pads on.   Also the mental thing you talked about. It's huge, show that ball you're not afraid by stepping into it. It's like when a bear charges at you and you stand tall and strong instead of running away. If you stand tall and strong the bear usually walks away, if you run that bear will chase you down an eat you. Show that bear what's up.   /end rant   *edit - I added the album here. I hope that demonstrates really well how taking away angle helps in goal-tending."
lacrosse,34gte6,henerydods,3,Fri May 1 03:17:48 2015 UTC,"This x a million.  Not only does stepping to the ball decrease the distance the ball can travel laterally, but it decreases the distance it can travel vertically as well.  By stepping to a low-to-high or high-to-low shot, you are decreasing the distance your stick needs to travel to stop the shot."
lacrosse,34gte6,Kingkern,2,Fri May 1 16:08:44 2015 UTC,"But then you're not really stepping to the ball if you're not getting to the ball, are you?...   I agree when he demonstrates it he is stepping to the shooter not the ball. If he were my goalie I would do some serious work with how he ""steps"" to the ball   Steps should be a combination of out and lateral. You don't just step forward, because that isn't stepping to the ball.   Exactly. Also the strings he has attached to the pipes are unrealistic. They should be on diagonal lines directed towards the shooter. The surface of the goal doesn't create a 90 degree surface for the shooter they create an angle, which is why you step and play a little off the goal line   The time changed is in all likelihood negligible...Not long after he mentions how you don't want to step backward, but wouldn't that give you even more time?   Yea this part made no sense to me and you're exactly right. It's better to play the angles because a few inches doesn't make a difference in terms of speed but I believe it does when taking up the space of the goal.   Lastly, attacking the ball is very much a mental thing as well.   You know you've said everything I wanted to just better. You broke down the video really well imo"

lacrosse,34gte6,CoachEdwards,-1,Fri May 1 19:53:18 2015 UTC,"I refused to listen to my goalie coach in high school about attacking the ball. He played back in the 60s when that shit was popular. Shots are a lot faster the game is faster. Stepping forward might meet your needs/style, but it slowed me down and I didn't do it. I think lateral movement makes much more sense if you do it right. Lots of goalies don't slide their dragging leg fast enough and it leaves the net vulnerable because their stance is bad. If you have the right grip/hand movement and step laterally you will be MUCH faster."

They decided to lock off everyone on the clear. So I just kept running. I got 10 yards away from the goal and figured I'd just shoot for the hell of it. I wanted it to look good so I shot an underhand riser. It missed the net by like 5 feet.  Luckily it hit an opposing player in the face mask and bounced into the net. We won.

Stop parading yourself around as a ""varsity"" team.  You're not a varsity team, you're a postgrad team.  I think postgrad teams are necessary, particulary the military prep schools in NAPS and Army Prep - they allow recruits to play in a competitive environment without giving up a year of their eligibility on riding the bench, but there's no way these overage players should be playing a high school varsity schedule.  It's unfair to the high schoolers who work hard to play kids their age, as well as unsafe, as they are going up against older, bigger, faster, and stronger players who are allowed to practice as well as lift 2-3 times a day."

We lose the ball, the opposing team picks it up and looks at the other ref who blows his whistle  All the while the opposing teams coach was yelling 'we have a middie back' (which he did, he was kneeling by the crease) and the refs discussed and picked the flag up. Then the refs said it was an inadvertent whistle, and no change in possession would be awarded for AP. They then proceeded to award the ball to the opposing team, saying that they had possession when they blew the whistle to administer the retracted penalty.  My question - I argued that they wouldn't have blown the whistle, if the flag wasn't down. Doesn't the flag effectively become a 'dead ball turnover' to the offended team, unless a goal is scored (for a faceoff)?   This was a super, super close game (4v5 seeds in the city playoffs). I know that call didn't lose us the game, but it certainly didn't help!"
lacrosse,34a9hf,dj_bpayne,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:43:24 2015 UTC,"I think they got the call right.  Worst case, go to AP stating there was no possession at the whistle."
lacrosse,34a9hf,phiwings,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:24:12 2015 UTC,"Here's how I'm reading it: Your opponents were riding (legally, as it turns out), got the ball in their defensive end, and once they did, the refs blew the whistle to administer an inadvertent flag. Is that correct?  If that's the case: Why shouldn't the opponents get the ball back after the whistle to sort out the offsides mistake? They won the ball in legal play and possession wasn't disputed. The ball wasn't loose so Alternate Possession wouldn't be appropriate.   EDIT: Because a flag freezes the game state at the time the flag is dropped, so resetting the game state and picking up the flag returns the ball to the team that was in possession BY RULE as described below. Stop upvoting this, upvote the response for being right and well-researched! :)"
lacrosse,34a9hf,ThetaGamma2,3,Wed Apr 29 16:52:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I agree with you.  Here is what NFHS rulebook says:  Rule 7.13.3   Inadvertent Flags - In the event of an inadvertent flag, play shall be suspended at the earliest opportunity that does not interfere with an imminent scoring opportunity. The team with possession when the flag was thrown shall retain possession. If the ball was loose outside the crease, possession shall be awarded by alternate possession. If the ball was loose inside the crease, award to the defensive team laterally outside the goal area.   So I get what you're saying here, but I would actually think you would give the ball to the team with possession when the flag was thrown.  You are right that AP is only during loose-ball situations.  This is not an inadvertent whistle (7.13.2) but an inadvertent flag and therefore has different rules."
lacrosse,34a9hf,ThetaGamma2,3,Wed Apr 29 17:08:03 2015 UTC,"Yep, you're right and I was wrong. Clearly, the ball should have gone back to the attack."
lacrosse,34a9hf,phiwings,3,Wed Apr 29 17:16:10 2015 UTC,It's all good. I had to go back and double check anyway.  Small detail that is easily forgotten/mistaken.
lacrosse,34a9hf,dj_bpayne,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:25:23 2015 UTC,"Here's my thing though.  Under HS rules, once the ball hits the ground, its dead.  Even though the other team picked up the ball, it was loose when the play ended.  At that point we go to AP.  At least that's my reading of it."
lacrosse,34a9hf,thekidwiththefro,3,Wed Apr 29 19:49:03 2015 UTC,"You are in the mindset of an inadvertent whistle. The rules are crystal clear with an inadvertent flag.  Regardless of possession/loss of possession post-flag, the team who had possession when the flag was thrown gets the ball.  You are right though on one thing.  There is no way the official should have given the ball to the other team if OP's team had AP.  Even if they treated it like an inadvertent whistle, play ended as soon as the ball hit the ground (unless the defender picked off a pass mid-air).  All in all, this crew messed this up, but it's an understandable mistake in my mind.  That's a tricky part of the mechanic.  I'd be more frustrated at the trail official who obviously counted back instead of counting forward and called an incorrect offsides."

lacrosse,34bmbs,sparr29,7,Wed Apr 29 21:18:20 2015 UTC,"Short stick defensive middie is exactly what it sounds like. You play solid man on man defense, get ground balls, and clear the ball. Once the ball is cleared you get off. You don't play any offense. The position is tough and there is no immediate reward, but your hard work will be noticed at the end of the season. Keep playing SSDM, it's awesome.  Source: Collegiate SSDM"
lacrosse,34bmbs,Forever_Abomination,3,Wed Apr 29 21:44:01 2015 UTC,"Think of it this way.  When a team is on defense you need six defenders plus the goalie.  Three are long-pole close defenders and ideally one is an LSM.  That leaves two short-stick midfielders to play defense. Those are the short stick defensive middies (SSDM).  SSDMs come on the field when the opposing team transitions the ball from defense to offense.  They play defense and then transition the ball upfield and then get off in favor of the offensive middies.  The idea is that this way your offensive middies don't get tired playing defense and you have a more solid defense man out there than your offensive middie anyway.  I know from playing as a close pole defender that having offensive middies on defense was a drag because of lazy and bad defense.  SSDMs are some of the hardest working players on the team and they don't get any recognition usually. If you can handle working hard without getting the nice stats or congrats from the fans, you should be excited to be a SSDM.  A big misconception is that the offensive middies are better than the SSDMs.  Don't let that get in your head.  SSDMs are just as important and a lot of times are more athletic than offensive middies."
lacrosse,34bmbs,UFGator8,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:41:00 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, my coach just has middies sub 3 at a time so we have to run hard on transitions, every middie is offensive and defensive. When you get to varsity and college is every middie specialized like they only play def/off and never both?"
lacrosse,34bmbs,A_Random_Sloth,2,Thu Apr 30 22:13:12 2015 UTC,"A fair amount can do both but it's much harder to do improve both effectively as opposed to focusing on one. Plus going both ways is a sure way to get gassed quick, Dmids and Omids allow more breaks. I will say, it is true that most of the team won't give you much recognition for being a good Dmid but coming from a pole, we love having you guys there. A Dmid with good footwork and positioning can keep people away from the cage almost as well as a pole, just don't throw too many checks."
lacrosse,34bmbs,judgeholden11,2,Mon May 4 21:32:36 2015 UTC,"D-mid does more what your coach says, clearing, lugging the ball out to the offense, and often slogging through the trenches as opposed to grabbing the glory.  Everyone remembers the pass that sets up the goal, but it's the outlet pass and footwork that creates opportunity.  I don't know much about the differences when it comes to most other things, as i was a close defenseman, but from what I know D-mids were the backbone to a successful squad.  Id gear you towards playing LSM mostly because wing play on face-offs and even face-offs themselves are a much better affair with the long pole.  I am sure others will comment and fill in the blanks....i'm a history major and now that im also a narp i try and bestow my meager knowledge to the future lax generation...whatever good it does considering most of the shit ive learned  on the field playing defense isnt exactly street legal if you catch my drift."

I think it is just a matter of time it would be added there.  I think Lacrosse is slowly making its way across to the midwest. Soon enough it had to bridge the gap from Texas and the NE. So I wouldnt be surprised if the SEC picks it up over the  next 10 years, and if the Big 10 grows its status.   Personally, I think it'll get MUCH bigger in Ohio. In the high schools it is already growing at such a fast rate. Essentially all of the D3 schools have it, Lake Erie College is ranked 1 in the nation for D2, and Cleveland State will be joining OSU in D1 during the 2016-17 season. I would expect to see schools like Ohio University, Miami of OH, Dayton, and Cincinatti pick it up."

The next sport they add is going to be Men's soccer or Men's Lacrosse but they'll probably have to balance it out with a women's sport which might be hard.  Hopefully several SEC schools go in together.  There has been talk of FSU making the jump for a while, maybe if either FSU or UF goes the other will follow suit.

lacrosse,348khc,jongajuice,3,Wed Apr 29 04:03:31 2015 UTC,"I play attack in field and offence in box. I like to get the best of all three worlds, with a big mid bag. Low whip, because whip is the devil, bagged out for a strong and powerful two hand cradle, and soft mesh so that ball can shift around in the ""pocket"".   It's the best of all 3 worlds because when I power cradle the ball will sit right in the middle, right in the narrowest point of the head, when I one hand cradle the ball can shift low, and when I crop hop on a time and space shot the ball will sit just under my bottom shooter for the perfect time and space release.   It's a very normal Canadian style of stringing sticks, and if you string a proper traditional it will end up like this too. Some guys like to have theirs bag out lower and others higher, but at the end of the day most of us use a very undefined and bagged out pocket with that ""goldilocks"" level channel (not too tight, but it's still there). Even some very prominent American players play with a stick like this, the most famous I can think of are the Powell brothers.

His is probably at an illegal depth for highschool/NCAA that's how big it is, but I know it's possible to play with a bag at legal depth because I use one. I use depth from the tightness of my bottom string to tune the whip in my stick, that way it's always consistent and if it changes I can tighten up the bottom string quickly to re-tune it."

But if you are a middie then mid pocket all the way. And if you are defence mid-high is preferable and for LSMs high pocket all the way."
lacrosse,348khc,MrWermHatsWormHat,2,Wed Apr 29 14:30:27 2015 UTC,Just wanted to add besides the standard...   Defence - mid-high Midfield - mid-low mid-high Attack - mid-low  ...also take a look at what you're working with as far as your head goes.  There are pocket placements that work better depending on what your sidewall layout and face shape is.
lacrosse,348khc,strainerhat,2,Wed Apr 29 19:38:00 2015 UTC,"Low Is best for carrying the ball. High is best for feeding. Mid is a bit of each, it depends how the pocket bags."
lacrosse,348khc,stewward,-3,Wed Apr 29 22:20:36 2015 UTC,i like the deep low pocket which is a combination of all the pockets. Just basically a really deep pocket. Here's a picture of my current middie stick.  http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411%2BfUgo4vL._SY300_.jpg I feel like the deep pocket gives you enough hold but doesn't sacrifice whip in the process. I just love how the release is so quick. Its a dream you should totally string it up like this next time.

All top WA players, a lot of top Oregon teams, and the top teams from British Columbia, CA. Canadian families all come down for a holiday weekend before Christmas, and they're all milling about the tournament site to talk with. Most NCAA players from BC have played in this tournament, Logan Schuss, Jesse King are the most recent two that come to mind. Plus, it's a quiet period for D1 coaches so you have all the access to yourself.  2) In March, the NW Invitational kicks off the WA high school season with a tournament for WA and OR and BC high school teams. It's also in the Seattle area. Typically though, this doesn't work with the schedules of college coaches.  3) In June, there are two one day back to back recruiting events in Vancouver, BC and Seattle. ""BC's Best"" and ""NW's Best"". This is mainly D1 coaches, but some D3's show as well. I would say the talent that shows for these is better in BC than Seattle, because the Seattle event is just getting started. There's more info here: http://www.walax.com/content/nws-best-top-100-recruiting-showcase-updated  All of these events are run by the Washington Lacrosse Foundation (http://washingtonlacrosse.org/) You can find out more info there, or send a mail to info@walax.com.

I hit guys in that situation all the time, you've just got to have proper hitting form. Lowering the head, no good. Bury a shoulder or use your arms and you're fine."
lacrosse,3422h8,meatduck12,7,Mon Apr 27 18:20:17 2015 UTC,"My coach usually makes the attack form an L shape (one top right, one bottom right, one bottom left) or vice versa, depending on where the ball carrier is.  And also, I had the same problem because I practice so much at home and if I dropped one ball in a game it'd look like I sucked. Honestly the only way to get over this is to constantly move your feet when catching a pass, and it'll be easier to catch and read, as well as get comfortable. If you don't overthink it, you'll catch it. Do you remember every kid on your team who drops the ball a few times? Not really, because it's not a big deal. Just get comfortable, don't think to much, and never stand in place when catching a pass.   And ground balls are scary sometimes. But what's even scarier than not scooping through and getting the GB is your coach yelling at you for not doing it. Getting hit is a part of lacrosse, and you'd be surprised at how much you won't actually get knocked over if you scoop through hard and keep running. Once again, don't overthink the scoop or the man challenging you, just do your thing like the man isn't even there and you'll have a ~80% success rate."
lacrosse,3422h8,supermav27,2,Mon Apr 27 18:30:53 2015 UTC,Yes definitely KEEP RUNNING.  You should always have your feet moving if you are scooping through a GB or catching/throwing a pass.  Never have stagnant feet.

lacrosse,3422h8,msupz,3,Mon Apr 27 18:45:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly the only way to get over the fear of being hit is to be hit. I used to shy away from contact but spent the winters and summers in high school playing against MEN. Post grad/collegiate, d1, d2, d3. These guys would beat the piss out of me and eventually I realized I HAD to be more aggressive and less afraid of the reality that this game is indeed, a man's game. You're gonna get hit whether you like it or not. Just gotta accept that fact and when you do, your game will elevate.  As for your other question...other guy answered it. Just form an L opposite the ball carrier."
lacrosse,3422h8,Camoman37,2,Mon Apr 27 18:50:39 2015 UTC,"Defensive player here, I had a similar issue with the getting hit when I was new. I know that I'm not in exactly the same position as you, but I have a way that can help... maybe.  Hit other people. Attack players can get incredibly physical in a couple of ways, usually the rides/clears or through crease activity. As a defensive player, I always HATED the attack players who would body me up on the crease as it would put me out of position. I know a few guys who play this way, and they told me it was how they asserted themselves in the middle and they also said the tough contact frequently prepared them to get rocked themselves. It makes sense because if your body frequently experiences the contact (whether you're the one initiating it or receiving it), it will get used to it in a long run.   I used to be afraid of hitting, but now I play body as much as I can (primarily because it is smarter gameplay, in my opinion) and it has inadvertently gotten me used to hitting and being hit. It's all a mind game, you have to overcome the fear in order to do it.  I know my logic is probably confusing, but I hope this helps you a little bit. If you need anymore clarification, let me know and I'll help as best I can."
lacrosse,3422h8,Qurtys_Lyn,3,Mon Apr 27 18:59:19 2015 UTC,"Attack who get physical are harder to defend. Especially for a defender who isn't ready for it.   We had a couple of attack that were big guys though, and always got physical. There were very few people who wanted to get in the way if they were charging the goal. Best I could ever hope for is to knock them off their line, as they both outweighed me by at least 40 pounds, and I was taller than they were."

Once they got the ball though, it was never about making bull dodges, rather it was about being a bull and just barreling through. I've been knocked down many a time by an attack player who just barged his way into the goal. Biggest thing to avoid flags when making this contact is to not lead with your helmet and dont ward (not really a flag, but a loss of possession nevertheless)."
lacrosse,3422h8,maxlax02,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:29:19 2015 UTC,Only way to get over it is to get hit or hit the guy before he hits you. Work on grinding it out on offense and making contact with your defensemen when carrying the ball. Doing so will get you used to contact and helps in locking up a defenseman's checks since you are in so close
lacrosse,3422h8,Whalers7997,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:20:28 2015 UTC,"Lacrosse is a physical sport man, there is not much you can do to prepare yourself to take hits other than getting hit more often. I suggest hitting the weights (you sound like you are a younger player) so you should still have room to grow.  Get hit, give hits, learn to like the contact. I know it is easier said than done but you gotta do it.  With regards to the middie fast break question, as some have said, form an L.  Middie runs down the right side of the field, there should be an attackmen high left, low left, and low right.  (The high left attackmen should almost always recieve the pass from the middie).

I know not everyone is like that. A coach told me once ""You either like the noise, or you don't"" on contact. The more ground ball drills you do and the more you try to embrace the contact during those drills the less you'll start to think about it all. You'll get use to it, and next thing you know, you'll be the one delivering the blows"

lacrosse,3422h8,WolfandKitty666,0,Tue Apr 28 02:20:04 2015 UTC,"Also don't treat practice different from a game, games should feel like business as usual.   When a team is at its best games are almost a step down in intensity because the real battle is getting on the field and fighting through practice.   In a game all that is left is execution which in many cases can be easier. Perfect example is ""man-down."" My teams will have practice ""6 on 6"" where the defense is man down the entire practice. I've done this to get them away from the idea of surviving the ""man down"" and settling in to be able to relax and deal with it. It made our man down much less panicked and more consistent.  I do the same thing with my offense. If you struggle with a very good/quick/tough defense in your league run your offense and add an extra d-pole in the center of the defense make ""6 on 6"" ""7 on 6"" again the offense can get used to quick slides and constant double teams. It helps a ton against a swarming pressure defense in a game."

Obviously at lower than shooting speeds or at full speed with a tennis ball.  Have them practice with an attack stick to improve hand eye coordination.    There's a good drill to get them to always keep an eye on the ball:  get a variety of colored balls, keep your stick shielded from them with your body, and have them call out the color when you shoot.  This improves both hand eye coordination and concentration."
lacrosse,342hf5,MrWermHatsWormHat,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:53:59 2015 UTC,I find using just your hands with no stick starts out with learning the step to the ball but just eventually turns into standing still and reaching. Similar drill I really enjoy is flipping the stick upside down and using the shaft of the stick to hit the ball. Pretty hard to stop it by swinging at it so the step is really enforced.

It's similar to the way that you see more and more face-off practice being done solo against air rather than exclusively live reps against someone."

I tried the no noz for the beginning of the season and, in my opinion, it was way too stiff, even after boiling and baking, it just didn't compare to the old noz.   In my personal experience, the clutch is good for faceoffs, but loses its shape way too fast, making it nearly unserviceable when you're doing anything besides facing off.  I haven't used that nike head yet, but I have heard a lot of good things about it, and a lot of top guys are turning to it."

Windsor has about 2 teams per age group with the warlocks in the OLA, but I don't know how registration and tryouts happen out there. Play in the league this spring (I hope you are already, because it's literally going on as we speak. Then next spring you can try out for the travel team or the OLA teams. Actually for all I know, the ""house"" league could just be the OLA league.   Start looking and talking to people right now. Games have already started for most box lacrosse leagues here in Canada."
lacrosse,33y1q7,Teijen,9,Sun Apr 26 18:58:04 2015 UTC,"First off you sound like a great teammate and someone that would be a pleasure to coach, so don't count out talking to your coach in the off-season and see what he thinks you should do to get on the field more. Sometimes more specialized spots like LSM don't get subbed all that often so getting your coach to better enforce the system you two talked about or switching to defensive short stick are both viable options. Switching from D-pole to shorty isn't as hard as it might seem. And with your physical skills it sounds like you could be very successful. In the last 4 years I've bounced back and forth a fair amount to get as much field time as I could. D-middie is hard though, a lot of your job is near impossible with what is being  asked of you. If the mental aspects of giving up goals and getting beat is hard it's only going to get worse when you lose the pole. If field time is what you want though it will probably help, that and with a shorty and pole, work on just becoming a monster on GB's. Getting faceoff wing play can be a great way to force a coach to play you and the translates easy to being on the field for fastbreaks and early defensive stands. Your coach seems like he could use some work on practice development, but not a lot you can do there. Biggest thing is just try and get better everyday. If you love lacrosse like it appears your best days are ahead of you."
lacrosse,33y1q7,bigsparks,4,Sun Apr 26 19:18:37 2015 UTC,"I'd like to echo what /U/bigsparks says here and add some input myself. In college (MCLA D1), i played with some guys who were playing second fiddle, so to speak, at schools like Darien, Saint Ignatius, Gonzaga, St. Stephen and St. Agnes, Mercer Island, and other top national programs. A lot of these guys never got their chance to shine in high school, but having learned solid fundamentals and never quitting, they got their chance to play and succeed at a high level. It's in one of the lacrosse pump up videos that has steve jobs saying ""you have to believe that the dots will connect in your future"". You certainly will never get a starting spot if you quit.  To echo what bigsparks says, you may want to try to change you own skill set a little bit. In college, LSMs are generally a body type that is slightly smaller than a defensemen but who is not quite agile/explosive enough to play offensive midfield (or is too long/lanky). But in high school, position is all prerogative and heart. there are 6'4 high school attackmen and little bulldozer defensemen. LSM is a position with 1 spot... teams use more than one in a game, but only one can go at once. My experience on a fully stocked college roster is that there were 4-5 guys who were 'available' acrosse all four years to play that spot, with two guys splitting the majority of the runs and the third seeing random minutes. Think about o/d middies... a coach wants as many of these as possible, and can play, on a deep team, 12+ in the same game, 3 at once. If you love the sport, give the short stick a try, esp while you're still young enough. I know guys who played until the highest level with the ability to go d middie or lsm... the more tools in the toolbox, the more your coach has reason to call on you."
lacrosse,33y1q7,wake266,2,Mon Apr 27 04:38:15 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice! I was going to use this summer to test the waters a little bit.
lacrosse,33y1q7,ThetaGamma2,5,Sun Apr 26 20:11:43 2015 UTC,"Man-down and lock-off midfield? Experience with a pole, speed, and hustle sounds like a defensive oriented midfield. Play the body position defense you're more comfortable with and try to force the ball to less threatening middies. Maybe 2nd LSM and bring a shorty for killing penalties?"
lacrosse,33y1q7,newaccoutn1,3,Sun Apr 26 19:15:38 2015 UTC,"Another demoralizing factor of the season that I experience was practice time. We would start with an hour of stick skills and warm-up and such.Then we would split JV and V up into half field 6v6 to go through sets,go live,and learn for the remaining hour of time left. Starters would go and sideline people would watch. Our coach was good about rotating the middies through and getting them time, but every other position would end up standing there until it was time to either sprint or end with 3v2's.   This is bad coaching. That's something that is very difficult for you to address as a player, especially considering you aren't a team captain or anything like that. My suggestion would be to tell your coach something like what you said here:    Yet I also made some crucial mistakes like not sliding correctly and simple things that I feel would've been addressed to me and fixed if I had practice.   Let him know you feel like you're not getting enough reps and that you feel that it's preventing you from being as good as you know you could be. Express it mostly as a problem and try to avoid offering any solutions.   He told me I would get time. He tried to get a system where the 1st LSM would go twice and then I would go, but the other guy blew it off. Morally it didn't feel right to me to throw my teammate under the bus. Even if he was a jerk he was still my teammate. So after the one game where he was told this system and blew it off I did something I probably shouldn't have but at the same time I though it was fair. I would count and wait until it was my turn in the system and I would just go.   If your coach told you to sub on at a certain time, sub on at that time. Your coaches don't want to have to worry about trying to micromanage routine substitutions. Just going at the time your coach told you to go is what you are supposed to do."

lacrosse,33y1q7,newaccoutn1,2,Mon Apr 27 00:59:22 2015 UTC,"I've re-written this 10 times. I'm gonna be blunt.   If you want time you need to prove that you deserve it. Even if you think you deserve it, you clearly don't because Coach isn't putting you in. That or your coach is dumb.  The kid is an asshole- why do you even bother listening to him. Don't listen to his shit. Let it roll off of your shoulder and be the best you can be.  If you're fast then clearly this 1st line has something you don't. Like you said, if you're messing up the simple things then you're a risk. If you are not sliding correctly you will get scored on. Prove to yourself that you want to be there, then prove to your teammate that you deserve to be there.  Don't switch positions, that's the easy way out. That's like escaping a hole, then jumping into a bigger one because you think that the big hole is better, but in reality the big hole is a shit hole.   You clearly are driven. You sound like an awesome dude and I would love playing with you. That being said, my word isn't law. I've been playing for 4 months.

You generally need a letter of recommendation from a coach do do it Make a highlight video. Look on whatever college teams you want to play for's website, they will either have a coaches email or a recruiting questionnaire. Email the coach saying you are interested in playing and show the video, or fill out the questionnaire and attach your video. You'd be surprised at how much this does.

lacrosse,33yosp,newswilson,2,Wed Apr 29 14:38:05 2015 UTC,"As a coach and father of three kids who play lacrosse I get what you are saying, but it makes me incredibly sad at the time and here is why...  There is no pot of gold at the end of the lacrosse rainbow, the reward for playing the game is that you are lucky to be able to play the game and have it be a a part of your life.   If you are already beyond your current teammates and looking for your next team be it travel or college or whatever you are not being a good teammate. Most teams have kids who are bigger, faster and better skilled than their teammates, the question is do they make their team's and teammates better.   You live on the east coast, you can go anywhere and play in college, but lacrosse isn't about getting on the best team. Say you get recruited to a low level D1 or a good D3 program. Will you keep playing if you aren't a starter or never play?  Play showcases and select over the summer, but focus on your team now, Make your team and those around you better right now. If you are the team's best offensive player work with your coach on ways to to defeat face guarding and early slides.   Talk to your coach about playing middie, if you are as good as you say your are and your team isn't great maybe you could help more by playing as a two way middie and inverting to attack on offense, just a thought.  I just would caution you to not look over the horizon so much, because you will never get there, but you can effect where you are right now and the lives of your current teammates."

lacrosse,33q9lv,matt7703,0,Sat Apr 25 16:49:25 2015 UTC,"Don't take jump shots, those are for basketball. In my experience, jump shots typically make you shoot the ball low. At the lower levels, jump shots work because goalies are not good at going low: there are too many moving parts and it takes real muscle memory to do it automatically. You should learn how to shoot the ball correctly on the run and practice that skill. You will be able to place the ball wherever you want and goalies will not have that upper hand when you're shooting the ball. It will help you in the long run and keep you from getting destroyed. Talk to your goalies about what is difficult for them. My buddy in hs would shoot on me for hours. We both ended up playing four years in the NESCAC, which is no small feat being from California."
lacrosse,33pu0m,DirtyChurch_Gord,17,Fri Apr 24 14:55:42 2015 UTC,"Relax some. If the ball is bouncing out of your pocket, you're fighting the ball rather than catching it.   Soften up your hands by A) realizing that shit happens when you're in net B) Hit the wall and pay attention to how little effort you need to make to catch the ball.   You want that ball to come to you and offer up a big hug like you're long lost friends. You don't want to step out and punch your long lost friend, do you?   New mesh may help but I generally prefer to use my mesh till it's ready to disintegrate; I'd re-do my sidewalls from time to time to keep the action nice when passing, however. Pure preference but I'd rather you be in the mindset that new mesh will help your game. Curses are bullshit, but belief in them will make them real."
lacrosse,33pu0m,sydtron,5,Fri Apr 24 15:16:21 2015 UTC,"New mesh will help, but as /u/sydtron mentioned, so will softer hands.   A good drill is to take tennis balls shots from your buddies. Catching a tennis ball is a bit harder to do and it will force you to keep your soft hands and to cradle/cushion the shot. If you have rocks hands to make a save with a tennis ball it's going to bounce right out.   The other thing to do is to track the ball into your pocket with your eyes/head. Make what feels like an exaggerated effort to look and follow the ball into your pocket and don't take your eyes off it until you know you've got it secured.  We've all scored on ourselves. I don't know how many times, early on, I went to gilman/clear pass while standing in front of the net and I tipped my stick too far back and the ball rolled right into the net behind me."
lacrosse,33pu0m,notnicholas,2,Fri Apr 24 15:26:01 2015 UTC,"Its probably not the mesh, just do your best to control the ball on the first touch, popping it up is almost never a good call.  If the ball leaves your stick, you better make sure it stays in front of you, even if it requires you to step back into the cage."

This prevents the possibility of it hitting your helmet and bouncing in.  In terms of getting past that game I would just say ""f*ck it"" and move on to the next one. A loss is a loss. As much as it hurts, you're getting to play the greatest game on earth with some of your best friends. On to the next one. The winners have lost countless games to perfect their game and get to where they are. Keep truckin buddy, you're a champion and everyone should freakin know it.  ""Goalies are the best looking, most athletic, smartest, guys on the field. We get the most play both on and off the field. It's always a great day to be a goalie. Have a day kid!"""

lacrosse,33pzh7,joehunt008,18,Fri Apr 24 15:36:35 2015 UTC,Played lacrosse in high school. Thought I was super hot shit. Made a video. Sent it to a few schools. Got rejected from all the schools because of grades. Only one coach got back to me. Now I play in a beer league. Moral: SCHOOL COMES FIRST!
lacrosse,33pzh7,DeeeezNuuuutz420,13,Fri Apr 24 18:01:04 2015 UTC,"I was recruited and played at the division 1 level after highschool. I made a throwaway for privacy but do have a bit of insight on the issue. I played and started for one of the best highschool programs in my region at the time and went on to play for a lower level, but respectable, D1 program. I was talking to some major programs and had attended several big name recruiting camps (Jake Reed Blue Chip, Top 205, Peak 200, New England 150). After these I was contacted by several programs from all divisions and was preparing to go visit and commit to my number one choice, which was a big name D1 program. Unfortunately, my coach and I did not get along very well and I was a bit of a degenerate during one of my highschool years, which resulted in a very negative review from my coach which lost me my opportunity to play at my top choice. I called my friend from highschool who was playing D1 at the time, who in turn told his coach (who happened to dislike my highschool coach), who in turn contacted me. I was still in talks with a few other programs that were D2 and D3, but I eventually committed to the school where my friend played out of my desire to play D1 ball. My years there were some of the best experiences of my life, but also were filled with tough times and learning experiences. My only regret was that I wish I hadn't relied so heavily on my skills as an athlete to make my dreams come true. But in the end the path I ended up on has made me the person I am today and allowed me to meet some of my best friends, which is something I am very grateful for.   My suggestions about recruiting for you are these. First and most important is to get good grades and test scores. They don't have to be perfect, but it is so much harder for coaches to recruit a player who may be amazing on the field, but terrible in the classroom. This also helps in getting scholarship money for academics. Second is to get your name out there. Coaches talk to each other, a lot. Its important to note that a positive impression goes a long way, and that a negative one will go even farther. Conduct yourself well on and off the field and act like a recruiter is watching you at all times. Start emailing coaches by mid-late sophomore year to just introduce yourself and to let them know that you're interested in their program. Email A LOT of coaches, from all divisions and fill out a recruiting questionnaire if they have one on their website. Even if you don't believe you can play there or are not interested in playing there, you are still getting name out there, which helps since lacrosse is extremely political and all about who you know. Don't be discouraged if they don't email you back, since there is a restriction as to when they are allowed to contact you (I'm not sure what it is currently). Third is to attend as many camps as possible, whether it be recruiting camps or team camps. Even better is to attend summer camps hosted by the school you are interested in. The coaching staff will be present and these are generally smaller which can allow you to be noticed more. Make sure to send an email beforehand to notify the coach that you are attending and that you are interested in playing there. While there, don't be afraid to go introduce yourself to a member of the coaching staff, as it helps to put a name with a face and will let them know who to watch. The last piece of advice is to not rely on coaches or parents to do anything for you, this is something you really need to work hard for to make happen (in most cases). I'm not saying to not use all connections available to help in the process (many coaches and individuals can be a huge help with their connections), but don't sit idly by and expect to be recruited without any initiative.   Overall, the recruiting process is very intensive and takes a lot of work. But if you're serious, hard work can make the difference between playing in college and not playing at all. Market yourself to the fullest extent and work hard in academics, character, and athletics. The best piece of advice given to me, which sounds terribly cliche, is to pick a school where you would enjoy going even if you had a career-ending injury. Don't write off smaller programs and D2 and D3 programs. Many of these teams could compete easily with some of the best D1 programs and often have great academic standing. College lacrosse is an investment and takes A LOT of work, but is one of the most rewarding and worthwhile endeavors. Best of luck to you!"
lacrosse,33pzh7,LaxAnon1234,3,Fri Apr 24 18:41:58 2015 UTC,"Came out of the west coast. Went to a few showcases. Got picked up by about 15 or so schools d1 2 and 3. A handful couldn't get me in due to grades (mostly ivys or nescac) etc. I think I had like a 2.8 or something in high school. One school said if I went to a jc or pg year and maintained a 3.1 I would be fine for their next recruiting class. So I did a pg, got into that school. Played 4 years at a top 10 d3 school as opposed to d1 because of the diploma I would receive. 10/10 would do again."
lacrosse,33pzh7,Fubu_Lover,2,Fri Apr 24 18:16:19 2015 UTC,A team mate in hs stated playing his sophomore year. Made all American twice before graduating. Got an offer from yale and ended up going to a local d1 mcla school here In southern California because of his grades. It was such an achievement gone to waste because he didn't work hard enough in the classroom.

Most of those guys say, ""we would beat every DIII school and 50% of the d1 schools."" I've played against duke, nova, michigan (as far a spectrum is concerned) they aren't beating anyone at the d1 level and no d3 team within the Top 40. The biggest thing that separates is athleticism, the kids I grew up with that went d1 were manimals. D3 still crazy athletic, but not quite. Mcla...... Well pretty much what you would expect."

Its a pretty sheer drop off after the top 20 in MCLA.  again source I play D3 and played in these close games"
lacrosse,33pzh7,shdlax75,3,Tue Apr 28 00:47:42 2015 UTC,"I started playing in the 8th grade and was a pretty crappy middie. My freshman year of high school the varsity back up goalie got hurt so I was recruited to play goalie. Playing goalie really clicked with me and I ended up starting JV and getting some playing time here and there as a freshman on Varsity. My freshman year the starter was a junior so since he was a senior the next year, I really wasn't going to get a lot of time. Our defense was kinda shaky so I ended up starting LSM or close d some games depending on the match up. My junior year was the first year I started in net and after that season was done I knew I wanted to play in college. I was all-conference, area, and state and just had a great year. I played over the summer for the first time so that really helped.  I sent an email to pretty much every d3 school on the east coast and heard back from a few. I struggled to get coaches to look at me since my team was pretty average for my area. I took a few overnight trips and visits and fell in love with a school that I had no chance of getting into so that was out of the question. I thought about going out of state but I felt bad for my dad who loves seeing me play. I was an asshole to him in high school and he was kinda sick so I felt bad not letting him see me play anymore so I settled on going to a school a town over from mine.   The school was kinda crappy and team was just ok but I played great. I started as a freshman and was really happy about that. Off the field was a different story though. Coke was kinda a big deal at that school and the guys on the team would often come to practice drunk which annoyed me beyond belief. I turned into a giant asshole when I was with them too. I broke up with my girlfriend, drank way too much, and wasn't pushed academically, classes were a cakewalk. The coach and I didn't get along too well either so that's what kinda pushed me to transfer.  I tried to walk on to the D1 school I transferred to but didn't even have a chance making it. I play club now and since its really competitive so I'm happy. I've matured a lot since also which I think is important.  The best advice I can give is two parts. 1) Get your name out as much as you can. Email coaches, send them film, be as pro active as you can. 2) Imagine the school without Lacrosse when you commit. Something might happen and you might not be able to play again. Don't be stuck at a school where Lacrosse is the only thing you have.  TL;DR: Played in high school, went to a sub par school, hated it, went to a big school, play club and love it."

lacrosse,33pcqs,aSmokyBear,6,Fri Apr 24 12:18:52 2015 UTC,"Wider grip and get lower to the ground, reducing the opportunity to check the lower end of your stick, and getting your body over the front and middle of it to protect it from axe wielder style checks.  I always look to kick or flick out into open space. Your advantage on gb's is not needing to bend down and lower your speed."
lacrosse,33pcqs,i_brought_pizza,3,Fri Apr 24 13:43:58 2015 UTC,"Be ambidextrous. If you're step for step with another player, be sure your body is between him and your stick. This will allow you to hip check him while you run as well. If you still need to create some separation, flick the ball towards open space, away from him. Also consider a very sharp turn away from him with both your stick and your body as soon as you scoop for it."
lacrosse,33pcqs,Rasta_Platypus,3,Fri Apr 24 14:21:09 2015 UTC,"Since you have an extra three feet of stick, try hockeying the ball to open space."
lacrosse,33pcqs,baconmassacre,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:23:07 2015 UTC,"If they are checking your stick out of the way, don't be afraid to kick the ball to a teammate. Remember you have the advantage with the long pole to keep them from being able to scoop the ball before you.  Try a subtle hip check, to bump them and force the other guy off a step while running to the groundball. Then get low and try scooping through. If you get your stick checked out of the way then it's up to you to make sure the other player can't get their stick down to get that ball. Keep attacking the ball and try to kick the ball out to a teammate or box the other player out.  If you come up with the ball, try a one handed cradle. Take the butt-end of your stick and rest it in your elbow to help brace the pole. This is done best along the sideline and keep the stick out of bounds. Your cradle should look like a mix of flapping your elbows like wings and twisting a doorknob."

Just throw your hips into him, and stop him for a second so you can get low and scoop or kick it away.   If you're more confident in your stick skills, you can also rake it behind you.

Two of your highlights are trail-checks which at the next level just really will not happen. The offensive player will bait you and when you commit to their stick, they'll just tuck it and run past you. You should work on staying on their hips and moving them to the outside. Sometimes fundamental defense is boring, but it rarely leads to 1on1 shots for your goalie!   Another thing - if I was an opposing coach and I saw this, I'd have my attack ride you to your left hand. I saw you switched over a couple of times on the clears, but then like clockwork you rolled back to your right for the pass. If they hang back on your right hip and wait for the spin, they'll take the ball away   Don't want to nitpick too much because from the looks of it your team is pretty strong, and whatever you're doing is working. I'd say just continue to work on your foot speed and positioning instead of going for those all-or-nothing stick checks   There are also a bunch more coaches on here that can help you out with anything you need man so don't hesitate to use this sub for tips!"

lacrosse,33jlgn,rand0m_task,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:48:02 2015 UTC,"In college the goalie always serves his own penalties. The same goes for most, if not all, high school leagues. A lot of youth leagues have the in home serve the penalty, but that is more about maintaining the pace of play than anything else."
lacrosse,33jlgn,smilli02,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:26:47 2015 UTC,Also many youth team carry 1 goalie.
lacrosse,33jlgn,newswilson,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:04:27 2015 UTC,"It depends on the league. Some leagues have the goalie serve the penalty, but you can replace the goalie with a backup if you pull a defender.   Other leagues let you have a defender serve a penalty."
lacrosse,33jlgn,PissedOffBiotic,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:49:15 2015 UTC,"Rule 7.1.1 talks about penalty enforcement:   A player who has committed a violation of the rules and shall serve penalty time shall:  a. Leave the field of play at once.  b. Report immediately to the scorer's table and remain in the penalty area until informed by the timekeeper that he may re-enter the game. When re-entering the game, the player shall enter the field of play through the table area.  c. Player serving penalty time shall sit or kneel in front of scorer's table.  d. Wait until the faceoff has ended before entering the field through the table area even when his penalty time has expired.  e. If the goalkeeper is penalized or injured, the official will allow a full one-min­ute delay for replacing the goalie on the field beginning with his warm-up.   So the keeper serves all penalties he is assessed.  There are many youth leagues that have modifications to this though (MN does).  In these modifications, the in-home can serve the penalty at a time and a half.  I assume you got a conduct, so the in-home would serve a 45 second penalty (30 +15).  This does not exist at the high school level."
lacrosse,33jlgn,theanuranking,1 point,Thu Apr 23 13:33:36 2015 UTC,"Happened to me. Dumbest thing ever, a guy was standing in front of the crease so I threw the ball up and followed through into him, goalie pass interference right? ... No. Slash called on me. We didn't have a backup, so we had the in-home serve the penalty. In case you guys are from states without the in-home system, there's a designated man who takes penalties for goalies or in other weird situations, like if a player gets two separate penalties before they stop play."
lacrosse,33jlgn,IlIllIlllI,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:25:00 2015 UTC,There is so much wrong here... I'll have to wait til tomorrow to fully explain though
lacrosse,33jlgn,theanuranking,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:55:51 2015 UTC,"Okay, please do though, I'll be happy to listen"
lacrosse,33jlgn,IlIllIlllI,1 point,Fri Apr 24 02:58:45 2015 UTC,"Ok!  Let's do this!  Sorry if I came off condescending, that can happen sometimes online because tone is so difficult to portray correctly.  1) In-home is not a state-by-state thing.  It's in the NFHS rules  2.1.4   The first attack player listed is officially the in-home. All players shall be listed by name, position and number in the official scorebook and shall be listed before the start of the game.  The In-Home shall be a starter in the game.   2) Neither of those situations you listed would be served by the in-home.  The first situation (as I said upthread) would be served by the goalie.  In the second situation, the offending player would serve both penalties.  So if it's a push and a slash, he's in there for 1:30.  3)  Rule 7.4.1   If a penalty is called against a team when no definite player is involved or when the penalty is against someone other than a player in the game, the official shall select the in-home and assess the penalty time.   The in-home serves penalties in the following scenarios   Penalty on the bench/coaches Ejected player When a penalty occurs and the official cannot determine a number (like too many men or an offsides where we don't know the specific player)   4) I want you to take a look at my last WtCW.  I talk about this slash/interference issue.  It is interference unless the official deemed your follow-through to be excessive and unnecessary.  That's it!  So your official was mostly right.  If he had the in-home serve the penalty, it should have been done at time and a half, as long as your league had a provision allowing for that. It's not in the NFHS rules to allow for someone other than the keeper to serve a penalty.  You do get some designated time to warm-up a new keeper."
lacrosse,33jlgn,theanuranking,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:46:00 2015 UTC,"Wow, thank you! Very informative. The refs allowed me to keep playing and had the in-home serve it, so I assumed it was right lol. One more question.. Hypothetically, if I went out for a ground ball behind the net, and I pick it up, throw in into the back of the net, walk back inside the crease, get it out of the net, then proceed to clear, is that legal? I don't see why not, but I don't know why it hasn't been done if the goalie's under a lot of pressure. Thanks again!"
lacrosse,33jlgn,IlIllIlllI,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:42:11 2015 UTC,"So there is nothing implicitly illegal about your scenario, but I think you may be risking a withholding call.  Rule 6.12.1   When a loose ball is on the ground, a player shall not lie on the ball, trap it with his crosse longer than is necessary for him to control the ball and pick it up with one continuous motion, or withhold the ball from play in any other manner. A player, players or team shall not deliberately withhold the ball from play. Repeated actions of this nature shall be ruled unsportsmanlike conduct.   Throwing the ball into the back of your net is gaining an advantage by preventing your opponent access to the ball.  That's firmly within the spirit of the rule.  You'll probably be warned first and it would have to be obviously intentional."
lacrosse,33jlgn,theanuranking,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:43:18 2015 UTC,"Cool! I had been toying with the idea for a while, it seems like it's one of those things that doesn't really happen but I might try it out if I really need to! Thanks again!"
lacrosse,33jlgn,IlIllIlllI,0,Sat Apr 25 19:08:28 2015 UTC,You're out of the crease so you're just another player at that point; a slash is a slash. You're really only privileged when you're inside the crease. Even then I can theoretically see a penalty being called depending on circumstances as you're always responsible for your crosse.

lacrosse,33ic58,theanuranking,4,Wed Apr 22 19:27:03 2015 UTC,"Youth coach here for U11, U13 and U15. Interference could be called constantly in most of our games. Players learning to yell ""release"" is super important at the youth level, especially if the game is called tight.   Thanks for the explanation!"
lacrosse,33ic58,newswilson,3,Wed Apr 22 21:59:12 2015 UTC,"If I were a youth coach, basic stick skills and man/ball/release would be the ONLY things I would practice.  And I would practice them over and over and over and over.  It's the most common penalty at that level.  Most veteran officials can tell when they are trying to do it right and will give the blocking players a bit of leeway"
lacrosse,33ic58,newswilson,1 point,Thu Apr 23 13:22:45 2015 UTC,This became such a problem with our first year players I only teach new kids to go for the ball. I'd rather have them blow up the pile then cause penalties behind/away from the play.
lacrosse,33ic58,newswilson,2,Thu Apr 23 15:17:49 2015 UTC,"Please don't do this.  That leads to bad habits and ""blowing up the pile"" is a lot more dangerous.  In fact you are risking much bigger penalties (illegal body check, push with possession, unnecessary roughness).  Instill good habits."
lacrosse,33ic58,henerydods,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:54:13 2015 UTC,"Remember, I am a youth coach 95% of the time they are dancing in and around the scrum. Nobody is picking up the ball let alone blowing up the pile. Blowing up the pile is more aspiration or wish fulfillment then t is actual instruction or execution.   When six kids are raking at the ball nobody is blowing up anything, and on the off chance a kid who is good at ground balls gets in there he is usually through and out of the pile before anyone in the scrum notices."
lacrosse,33ic58,UFGator8,3,Thu Apr 23 18:50:42 2015 UTC,"Wait, so you can't off ball screen? There has to be some leeway in the rules here or something because I have most definitely set off ball picks before, albeit never in NFHS rules, and always strictly within the field lacrosse rules of a pick. What do most refs let you guys get away with on off ball pick and roll situations?"
lacrosse,33ic58,UFGator8,2,Wed Apr 22 22:42:30 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand, or I did a poor job of explaining.  You have the right to your space. If your feet are set and your stick is not sticking out (legal screening position) you are fine.  By definition, an illegal screen takes place when you are trying to screen the defender on the ball and you do so illegally.  Screens are perfectly legal, but if they are done off-ball and they aren't legal, it's actually interference."
lacrosse,33ic58,exlaxbros,2,Thu Apr 23 13:25:00 2015 UTC,"Semi-related. Personally, one thing I don't like is that I am told I'm not supposed to call an illegal pick unless contact is made.  IMO, if an offensive player is in an illegal pick position that causes the defender to have to move to not run into him, there should be a call.  The defender could always just run into the pick but then that player is having to rely on the official, which I don't like from a player or coach perspective.  Am I being told the right thing? what is your opinion?"
lacrosse,33ic58,exlaxbros,3,Thu Apr 23 02:45:03 2015 UTC,"Rule 6.4.1   No offensive player shall move into and make contact with a defensive player with the purpose of blocking a defensive player from the man he is playing, nor shall the offensive player hold his crosse rigid or extend his crosse rigid to impede the normal movements of the defensive man.  If contact is made between offensive and defensive players as a result of the offensive player's setting a screen, the offensive player shall be stationary before the contact occurs, with his feet no wider than shoulder-width apart.   I understand your thoughts and from an advantage-gained perspective, you are dead right.  Many rules are written to allow us to look for players gaining an illegal advantage.  This is not one of them.  The rule (important part bolded) is pretty damn specific about contact being needed for it to be an illegal screen."
lacrosse,33ic58,MrWermHatsWormHat,1 point,Thu Apr 23 13:29:26 2015 UTC,"Gotcha.  If I made the rules, it's something I would change.  But atleast I know I'm calling it right.  Another great post.  Keep them coming. :)"
lacrosse,33ic58,exlaxbros,1 point,Fri Apr 24 04:49:03 2015 UTC,"So the way I'm reading this is,  If an offensive player sets an illegal screen (moving, etc.) but a screened defender does not make contact with that player, the official will rule that it didn't affect the game and will usually no-call it. Is that correct? The other defense coaches and I get apoplectic with the amount of moving screens that don't get called, but it makes sense if that's how the officials are viewing it."
lacrosse,33ic58,MrWermHatsWormHat,1 point,Sat Apr 25 17:42:47 2015 UTC,"So I wouldn't use the language ""didn't affect the game.""  Cause that's inaccurate. /u/UFGator8 has a good point.  Illegal screens that cause the defender to change direction without contact are still gaining an unfair advantage.  It's a tough area for us officials and for rule-makers.  We don't want it to get super subjective.  The language in place is very specific.  Contact must be made. No matter what the offensive player is doing, if contact is not made, there is no call."

IT bounces in the box in front of a few D-poles and attack. The goalie for UMass Lowell who has a d-pole on his goalie head misplays the ball and it goes in the net after the horn sounds.   By NCAA rules since it was a shot (It was on goal) the goal counts because the ball was in the air as time expired. Hardly anyone on the field realized what happened in real time.

If you'll be fine until you get a clear, wait until the ball is in the other zone and rub your new welt for a bit with your bare hand."

lacrosse,33en7j,IG_Fan,3,Wed Apr 22 03:17:53 2015 UTC,"When you get the chance squeeze the area as hard as you can or hit it or rub it vigorously, even if it makes it hurt more. I've been told it will make it heal faster and the Gate Control Theory (wikipedia it if you want) says that it will block the pain."
lacrosse,33en7j,UFGator8,3,Wed Apr 22 03:41:12 2015 UTC,1) adrenalin is your friend  2) You'll get used to it. To a certain degree pain is a learned response.  Recognize the difference between something that hurts and an actual injury to your body.  Also recognizing whether the injury can actually be made worse by continuing to play is an important distinction.
lacrosse,33en7j,BaconBob,2,Wed Apr 22 13:25:05 2015 UTC,I broke the tip up my left thumb in half during a game and didn't even know until after the game because of all of the adrenaline. It's all about just trying to ignore it and blocking out the pain. Unless it's something you think could be a serious injury it will eventually feel a bit better later in the game. Just try to ignore it.
lacrosse,33en7j,Hannyac3,2,Wed Apr 22 04:31:34 2015 UTC,For me I always thought a goal hurts more than the ball
lacrosse,33cqv4,Sconnieworker,15,Tue Apr 21 13:51:51 2015 UTC,"As an official, there are twothings that I can recommend when dealing with blowouts.  1) No celebrations.  I don't care if it's your 5th string goalie scoring a goal.  Everyone can go over and pat him on the head, then line up for the faceoff.  That's when a lot of bad things can happen.  Team is up by 10 and Johnny benchwarmer scores his first goal and everyone goes nuts.  One of the members of the other team gets pissed about it and takes it out on whomever on the ensuing faceoff.  2) Lessen the contact.  Aggressive but fundamentally sound defense is great, but you are risking something bad happening if you encourage a lot of contact late in a game.  A big hit by your team (even if it is legal) is going to spark the other team to retaliate, and that may not be so legal.  Nearly all my issues I've had as an official in blowouts stems from a team either celebrating (goals or hits or saves or wtv) or playing aggressive defense.  There is no reason for your longpole to go for a takeaway check up 12, have them work on positioning and rotation."
lacrosse,33cqv4,theanuranking,2,Tue Apr 21 17:25:10 2015 UTC,"We stop sliding all together at 8-0. We still have them communicate as if they are sliding, but we don't need the bodies flying around at that point."
lacrosse,33cqv4,SkullsXXL,8,Tue Apr 21 17:47:55 2015 UTC,"I coach a team that has around a .500 record right now. I would prefer the other team to play normal the entire game. Score 30 if you can, my kids need to see real lacrosse players."
lacrosse,33cqv4,newswilson,4,Tue Apr 21 17:25:16 2015 UTC,"I've been on both sides of that and I disagree. I coach on the gulf coast and have seen programs 'go out of business' at both the youth and high school level because they took too many bad losses.   Maybe it would be OK in a traditional lacrosse area, but kids who consistently lose 20-0, 22-1, 25-0 don;t com out for the sport next year.   We all talk about growing the game, but when you score 20 against a team that s new/bad you are salting the Earth.   The only exception might be a district or tournament game where goal differential is important for advancement or seeding and even then it is not something I worry about."
lacrosse,33cqv4,drdriedel,5,Wed Apr 22 01:18:59 2015 UTC,"For me, a lot of what happens in a blowout depends on the level of play.  For example, if it's a youth rec league, I will always pump the breaks a bit. Clear my benches, 3 passes before a shot, etc.    A high-level youth travel/club team is a bit different though. I would still have my defense play as aggressive as they would normally, and I'd make sure my 2's and 3's got the majority of the reps offensively and defensively, but I wouldn't put any ""3 passes before you shoot"" type restrictions on them.   Same kind of thing for an HS team.   Where my philosophy really changes, however, is in college/pro game. I wouldn't let up at all if it was a blowout, and I wouldn't expect the other team to let up if my team was the one getting blown out either. This is because at that level, it is your job to stop them from scoring, not their own. It defeats the purpose of the athletic competition at that level to let up, and frankly, I would be insulted if my team was getting blown out and the other team let up on us. Think about it: the other team feels so bad for you that they stop themselves from scoring? That actually makes me more mad than just getting blown out."
lacrosse,33cqv4,laxlife5,4,Tue Apr 21 20:06:25 2015 UTC,"I coach box so I usually force a certain number of passes or just pass around until the shot clock runs down and take an outside shot at the last second, also get players to play with their off hand and I usually try to get the players with less skill (or one's that don't score often) a goal"
lacrosse,33cqv4,henerydods,2,Tue Apr 21 14:41:43 2015 UTC,"You coach box but force players to play off handed? I didn't even know off handed was a possibility until I turned around 16, haha. Yah you touched on offence pretty well, just pass around and shoot on <5 seconds left in the shot clock.   And when playing defence we would just play sound body defence, no big slashes, take away checks, or hits. Focus on taking away angles, keeping them outside, and opening up to picks. Make sure that communication is loud all game on both sides of the floor too."

lacrosse,33cqv4,UFGator8,3,Wed Apr 22 00:55:50 2015 UTC,"Here is an idea that I like if you are going into a game knowing you are going to win by a large margin.  Divide up your starters so they go in with players that don't play much in most games.  For example, if A1, A2, A3, M1, M2, and M3 are your starters.  Roll the following lines all game  * (A1, A4, A5)  * (A2, A6, A7)  * (A3, A8, A9)  * (M1, M4, M5)  * (M2, M6, M7)  * (M3, M8, M9)  Or something like that depending on your numbers.  This way your starters still get to play, and your bench gets to play with a leader out on the field that can help direct them, which helps a lot IMO."
lacrosse,33cqv4,newswilson,2,Wed Apr 22 02:29:05 2015 UTC,"What I usually employ is first is to make sure the backups get some run before gets out of hand. The reason is my less skilled players usually are the ones most likely to go rouge and score if given the chance.   We use a 2-2-2 set we call stretch which is our clock killing offense. We go into this anytime we are trying to shorten a game. We also use some of our better players to do it. 6-0 or 8-0 with your starters killing clock in the middle ends up giving your less experienced players more playing time at the end in a situation where you can let them play without the fear of running up the score.   If it gets really bad stay in stretch and play our older better players out of position. D-pole at attack, attack at middie etc. I usually don't mess with defense too much other then play backup poles.   Also substitutions, lots of midfield and attack subs. Nothing wastes more time then running players on and off the field constantly."
lacrosse,33cqv4,SapienChavez,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:09:08 2015 UTC,I do need to start subbing earlier for sure. I just feel bad for our guys who work hard to earn a starting spot only to play half a game because the other team can't keep up. Good advice coach.
lacrosse,33cqv4,concussed_cowboy,2,Tue Apr 21 15:24:14 2015 UTC,"as for on the losing side: its water off a ducks back!  first off, when i was coaching i let the players, collectively, decide how involved we would be any one season.  were we playing to win or were we playing to learn and have fun.  i never faced a blow-out in a ""lets do our best to win it all"" season (this might make me unqualified to answer here).  when they happened in the ""lets have fun"" years, it was a non-issue and there was usually more to learn in those games, making the beneficial.  I also made sure every player (that went to practice) got to player at least 1/4 of the game.  even if we were on the fence and i could win with my ""starter,"" i would take a loss and honor my word.  winning means little to me... maybe its a leftover from 10 years in goal...  i was a goalie for my entire career as a player, so i have a different mindset on blow-outs... my best games i ever played were all loses.  one of the most gratifying (and best performances) i ever played, i gave up 19 goals in the first 3 quarters.  i got shelled.  we lost 21-4.  i had over 30 saves.  not my highest % ever, but damn was that game fun like no other!  in college, i had three shutouts.  lamest games of my career.  id rather lose and have fun, as a goalie.  sorry if i was all over the place on this topic :)"
lacrosse,33cqv4,dj_bpayne,2,Tue Apr 21 17:09:12 2015 UTC,No I get where you are coming from. I've been on the losing side of these type of games so I know how it feels. Our first year we went 0-10 and got crushed every game. In these games everybody plays at least a half with backups playing more than the starters. Thanks for the insight.
lacrosse,33cqv4,thelaxative,2,Tue Apr 21 17:24:20 2015 UTC,I play on a team that runs up the score. We have been on the winning side of it multiple times this year and I absolutely hate it. There is no need for it. It's not fun for is and clearly not fun for the other team. I feel the need to apologize on my teams behalf almost after these games. I personally believe it is classless.   Don't change a thing. You are doing it right and I applaude you for it. We need more coaches like you. Clearing you bench before half and making your back ups and rest of your players  get better by playing them and making them run new sets and use their off hand is great
lacrosse,33cqv4,peebsunz,3,Wed Apr 22 04:06:52 2015 UTC,"Most of the time I know what to expect coming into a game because of scouting, or grabbing a beer with a coach that has played that team before   I honestly hate those games, it's not fun for me because I'm ultra competitive and your kids tend to play down to the weaker teams' level you know?   like /u/thelaxative said, when we get up by a comfortable amount we put our D at mid/attack, and get some of our smallest guys to play long pole. Our goalie plays attack, and we toss someone else in cage. Everyone goes weak hand on everything except faceoffs, and you don't do any fast breaks. You pass the ball around in the offense with your off hand as hard as possible, eventually someone will mess up and you tell your middies to just drop straight into the hole and don't ride   You're right though, it's a fine line between having fun, not showing off, and not developing bad habits through lazy play."
lacrosse,33cqv4,thelaxative,6,Tue Apr 21 14:42:55 2015 UTC,A fun thing we have started doing with our attack (who all shoot around 100 mph) is forcing them to play goalie. They get to experience the Trauma they put on goalies.

Practice quick release/dump shots in tight space.   Most importantly: don't make yourself want to score goals for selfish reasons. Talk and listen to your coach and work to help your team become the leading goal scoring team; your piece in the puzzle will fall into place.

Always remember when dodging from up top to get as high as possible ( close to the mid line) and don't mimic the attack style dodge. no need to make several moves, fakes, roll backs etc. Just pick a side and run past your defender.

Diablo Valley College is in pleasant hill in the east bay has a great lax program. I played there for 2 years. We played against Cal, Stanford, Sonoma state, St. Mary's, UC Davis, Notre Dame De Namur, and now they have other junior colleges with teams too. We had guys coming from Sonoma, one guy moved from San Diego to come play, and others traveled from 45-60 minutes away. The club fees were about 150 when I was playing, could be more or less now. I still am in contact with the team there, and a couple years ago, about a year after I left DVC, they played and beat Simon Frasier, a Canadian university that is pretty good and nationally ranked in the WCLL  Many other junior colleges in the area have popped up since Diablo Valley College started with the first team, I would suggest checking out the ones in your area, and hey you could also START the first lax team at your local junior college!  If you have any more questions, message me  Edit: forgot your were a sophomore, college is still a few years away but it gives you time to get ready, and knowing you can play after HS might be a great thing to look forward too.

There are two or three teams we play every year that you know are just going to be slash/penalty fests because their coach is classless and in turn the players take on that personality.  I know sometimes players get chipper its part of the game - but it's all about how the coach manages those attitudes. Does he enable or come down on that behavior?  I know I have taken some of my best players off the field to give them time to cool down because I don't want a culture where players think that kind of behavior is acceptable."

lacrosse,333vjc,aSmokyBear,4,Sun Apr 19 07:15:28 2015 UTC,"Wall ball focusing on form. Wall ball or tossing with a teammate focusing on form. If you're talking about fogo, you can get more leverage with a pole, if you are talking about playing the wings as lsm, if you get the ball try passing it off to a shortstick if you don't bust it to defense and get into position."
lacrosse,333vjc,mitch85,2,Sun Apr 19 08:42:24 2015 UTC,"We call that stabbing the ball where I come from. It's a very bad habit, but it's a pretty easy one to get rid of. It requires playing wall ball, but playing it right.    Hit the wall and when you catch it it you need to absorb the ball into your stick. Throw the ball at the wall then catch it one handed with your hand about halfway down the shaft, and without cradling. You should see the head of the stick naturally recoil and absorb the energy when doing this, now you need to recreate that motion with both hands on the stick when catching. The absolute best way to practice this is with ""quick"" sticks, but do them pretty slowly. Throw the ball at the wall, catch it, then throw it back WITHOUT cradling between any of those points, but don go too fast. Keep doing this no cradle pass, you HAVE to catch the ball properly for this to work so it really reinforces the good habit. Eventually you start to get better at this and start doing it faster and faster, and pretty soon you're quick sticking like guys in the NLL.   And for 2, again you have to hit the wall and emphasize good habits. Step into the throw with your opposite foot, step back when you catch, follow through, and be consistent."
lacrosse,333vjc,henerydods,1 point,Sun Apr 19 16:03:28 2015 UTC,"all the asnwers here are correct but my 2 cents too   wallball and when the ball hits your pocket allow the head to fall backwards almost, like you were cushioning it. Do not cradle until the ball is properly sat in the pocket. as mitch 85 said, but think like you're trying to brush your ear with your stick when you pass, alternatively stand in front of a mirror for a bit without a ball and just work on your form. Where I practice there's a window under the bit of wall I aim for so I can often see my reflection in that. If and LSM is not taking the face  off they should be to the left hand side of the opposition's face off guy, so on the right hand side of your face off guy, this way if the opposition wins the clam when they try to flick the ball out, your LSM can scoop it up or make it more difficult for the opposition to do this."
lacrosse,333vjc,tall_lacrosse_player,1 point,Sun Apr 19 10:01:04 2015 UTC,"For number one, try and focus on using your bottom hand to control your stick more when you receive the pass. It helps with developing control in your weaker hand and allows your stick to move a little more and take the energy out the ball when you receive the pass."

lacrosse,3334x9,maccoons99,6,Sun Apr 19 01:52:30 2015 UTC,"Posted this in another thread in reply to a new goalie who needed help to stop flinching. It should give you some basics.  I played goal some in high school but had the luxury of being a goalie in Soccer, hockey and a catcher in baseball. You have to drop the idea of 'playing goalie' and adopt the idea of 'blocking shots.' I say this because in lacrosse the goal is soo big generally players are shooting around you or near your extremities so you can duck and bail out. To ramp up fixing that you need to do a couple of things.    Play without a stick. I know crazy right? Well until you are no longer afraid f the ball the stick is hindrance not a help. You have to learn to always block the ball with your body if you can.  Start on a small goal, 3x3 or a small practice soccer net and start on you knees 'Butterfly Style' like an ice hockey goalie. have someone throw or shoot tennis balls at the goal which you now take up most of and start block the balls. Mentally you need to understand that your stick can only do its job once you have learned to position yourself behind each shot. You stick is an extension of your core, but if your core is out of position your stick can never be in position. When you are in goal every shot triggers a fight or flight response. You need to turn off the fight response and double down on fight.  Think about, understand and visualize that you are physically most vulnerable when you flinch and duck. As a goalie you always want to stay in front of and be moving towards a shot because that is when you are safest. You would much rather take a hot to mask then hip, arm or back where you are unprotected. Again it is fight or flight. If you run or duck or flinch the ball if going to bite you. IF you stand tall and fight you have chance to bit it first. You can never outrun the ball and be safe, but you always have a chance to fight to off.  Don't be afraid to ""Pad up."" Beyond the chest protector and cup. Use full size are guards, A fully football girdle/compression shorts, shin guards, baggy jogging pants. Use anything that is legal to help you feel comfortable and secure."

If you're going to live off campus I suggest Cooper/Young area,  Poplar/Cooper area, or East Memphis.   Partying: Downtown of course, Cooper/Young area, Univ of Memphis Highland strip, and the recently updated Broad District.  Eating: anywhere with good reviews in East Mem.  Some Places around broad District are still pretty rough so don't wander too far from the strip bars.  The Memphis Flyer should help you out with night life.     There are good patches and bad patches in this city.  When driving stick to your main roads and you should be fine.   Avoid public transportation at all costs.    /r/Memphis should help you out as well.    There's plenty of league play in the summers.

lacrosse,330s22,FlyingFake,1 point,Sat Apr 18 12:09:59 2015 UTC,I'd look into getting an Easton shaft. I'm an attackman and I use the Easton talon. It's a carbon composite shaft with a wood finish. So it feels like a wood shaft but it's still pretty light. I love it.

lacrosse,330s22,Falcon2025,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:43:09 2015 UTC,If the shaft is too heavy then you may have a hard time picking up ground balls

lacrosse,330s22,Joaf,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:04:44 2015 UTC,"Ground balls have a lot to do with feeling the ball in your stick, then getting the f*** outta there before anyone wrecks you. With a wooden shaft especially on a d pole it makes the shaft heavier than the head, so it throws all your balance off, making it hard to feel the ball and to maneuver your stick to keep it safe while you try to move it to someone else. I'm a goalie so I'm not positive on this but i imagine that's why"
lacrosse,330s22,thecaptian777,1 point,Sat Apr 25 13:08:25 2015 UTC,"Sargent Sticks. Guy out of Montana makes them, they're really well made and relatively cheap.

There are tons of opportunities to play lacrosse at every age and skill level. Go out and find a casual men's league, maybe a masters league. All the fun of going out and playing lacrosse and hanging with the boys, non of the time and physical commitment. Men's lacrosse is way more fun for me then playing competitive youth ever was, and I still loved my time in minor lacrosse. I play with people who have coached longer than I've been alive, and with guys who picked up a stick for the first time a few months ago. I love playing every minute of lacrosse with all of them. Plus the beers after are the best part. Go out there and have some fun man."

That being said, I wouldn't give up lacrosse entirely if I couldn't play competitive. I have just as much fun with my rec league guys as I do with my Sr.B team, ones just different."

But if you play offense it is less likely to. I don't see any need to change it as long as you like it.  Side note: assuming you are MCLA DII, it's illegal to have tape on the head of the stick. (I'm pretty sure the MCLA is the same as the NCAA). If I am right, drill a hole and get a screw. I'm sure club is much more lenient about these things though."

HS games are commonly on TV, a lacrosse oriented shop in almost every city, etc.  My cousin, who was also born/bred in MD/played at a major HS program, moved to work in St. Louis almost a decade ago and coaches at a school out there. He said its awfully hard to get players to commit to the game, show up to practices, start playing early.  So whats the deal with MO? Whats holding the sport back? Do you need a ""Bill Tierney"" at a major local college to jump start it?"
lacrosse,32ye8g,Dayzed88,2,Sat Apr 18 03:51:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly in most of the private schools in STL, lacrosse is doing pretty well. It's the public schools that aren't seeing the growth that a lot of the other country is seeing. On Columbia (where I live) I think a lot of the players don't take it as seriously as they should. However, one thing Columbia had going for it in the lacrosse community was a man by the name of Keith Uecher. He coached the mizzou club team and pretty much started the youth league here. The man was so passionate about lacrosse and its growth. His main goal (from what I've heard) was to make mizzou a D1 program. The players didn't like the amount of work they had to put and pretty much got him fired. And that pretty much epitomizes Missouri and lacrosse"

I think the big drawback to MO, in particular, is the baseball culture. I know it may not be reality, but perception plays a large role.  Theres no easy answer to the question. I think the presence of a college team can do wonders for the youth aspect, but that may not be something financially possible. This may also be an issue at the HS level as well."

lacrosse,32trp0,WhiteyLax,2,Thu Apr 16 17:35:58 2015 UTC,"I know its hard to hear, but you just have to get used to it. It may be painful at times, but the more you are used to getting hit you learn to accept it and you will become more aggressive towards the ball. YES! Play goalie! It really is a fun position, the feeling of pain from getting hit by a shot is quelled by stopping that ball from going in. Work on reflexes and quickness. Those two things are important."
lacrosse,32trp0,chrisc284,1 point,Thu Apr 16 19:02:46 2015 UTC,"it takes practice for anyone.  instinct says to GET OUT OF THE WAY!  so you have to fight that and train against it.  very few goalies have a natural instinct to attack the ball.  it has to be learned and you must retrain yourself.  so dont let the flinching stop you!  for my story, i did this ""flamingo"" thing when i was first learning.  instead of a proper step, i would lift my leg, like a flamingo.  drove my coach nuts.  he tied my feet together (enough to step, but not lift) and a few other tricks.  with practice i got it."

lacrosse,32trp0,GeneralPie,1 point,Fri Apr 17 03:00:02 2015 UTC,I would add that it is perfectly fine to armor up. Put on shin guards and thigh pads. As much as you tell you body to be tough it will try to protect itself. If you get blasted in the leg all it will do is reenforce your natural reflex to get out of the way. Just drill your technique until you feel comfortable then start seeing some serious shooters. You already have the most important quality in a goalie and that is wanting to do it.
lacrosse,32trp0,newswilson,1 point,Fri Apr 17 04:02:07 2015 UTC,"I played goal some in high school but had the luxury of being a goalie in Soccer, hockey and a catcher in baseball. You have to drop the idea of 'playing goalie' and adopt the idea of 'blocking shots.' I say this because in lacrosse the goal is soo big generally players are shooting around you or near your extremities so you can duck and bail out. To ramp up fixing that you need to do a couple of things.    Play without a stick. I know crazy right? Well until you are no longer afraid f the ball the stick is hindrance not a help. You have to learn to always block the ball with your body if you can.  Start on a small goal, 3x3 or a small practice soccer net and start on you knees 'Butterfly Style' like an ice hockey goalie. have someone throw or shoot tennis balls at the goal which you now take up most of and start block the balls. Mentally you need to understand that your stick can only do its job once you have learned to position yourself behind each shot. You stick is an extension of your core, but if your core is out of position your stick can never be in position. When you are in goal every shot triggers a fight or flight response. You need to turn off the fight response and double down on fight.  Think about, understand and visualize that you are physically most vulnerable when you flinch and duck. As a goalie you always want to stay in front of and be moving towards a shot because that is when you are safest. You would much rather take a hot to mask then hip, arm or back where you are unprotected. Again it is fight or flight. If you run or duck or flinch the ball if going to bite you. IF you stand tall and fight you have chance to bit it first. You can never outrun the ball and be safe, but you always have a chance to fight to off.  Don't be afraid to ""Pad up."" Beyond the chest protector and cup. Use full size are guards, A fully football girdle/compression shorts, shin guards, baggy jogging pants. Use anything that is legal to help you feel comfortable and secure."

lacrosse,32prix,Zoos27,8,Thu Apr 16 03:24:51 2015 UTC,"All the suggestions on this thread are great but it is missing one glaring reality: money. Sponsorship and advertising is what drives the money to any sport. Sponsors won't come on board unless they see a market: attendance and TV ratings. attendance and ratings won't go up without a draw to the sport. Lax die-hards are still watching NCAA lacrosse in the first half of the MLL season. In my opinion while the MLL is loaded with some of the best athletes in the sport, it can't grow further until the athletes are full-time players like in other major sports. The money isn't there yet for a full league worth of players to practice 5 days a week and do nothing but play. Thus, the vicious cycle continues.  One other thing that should be noted, and has been cited as one big reason for lack of growth at the MLL: he league owns everything. While there are independent owners of teams, it isn't like the 4 major leagues. The MLL controls who gets paid what, and it isn't much. I believe Rabil and Powell got the biggest game checks last year and it was maybe $30k. You don't get paid unless you dress AND play in the game. Teams will fly you out on Friday, practice Friday night (if you can get out of your 9-5 in time to make a flight in time) practice Saturday and play sat night or Sunday. You get something like $150 to make practice and nothing if you don't dress for the game.  Bottom line until we as fans support the MLL by showing up to games and tuning into TV games, the MLL will not generate significant enough revenue to drive more sponsor money. We still have issues with ESPN preempting massive NCAA match ups with softball and college baseball - that is a ratings and contractual choice. If ESPN knew they would get a ratings bounce every time lacrosse was on - we'd see more of it on TV. If the NCAA is seen to be struggling, the MLL surely will.  EDIT: fat finger typos..."

lacrosse,32prix,newaccoutn1,4,Wed Apr 15 19:30:13 2015 UTC,"The pro level just lacks the passion and do or die attitude that college teams have.

lacrosse,32prix,DidiDoThat1,8,Wed Apr 15 19:58:18 2015 UTC,"Did you read the article? Those guys are not there for the pay checks, hahaha. Outside of the top guys like Rable, Harrison, and anybody else who has made a brand out of themselves, every guy is working a second job to supplement the pay. Every guy on that field is there because they love lacrosse, and want to play regardless of other activities like having to work a full time job to live.   Very few of them even work good jobs because they are so demanding. They sacrifice retirement stuff, long term financial goals, and short term financial goals just to go out and play pro lacrosse. Because I'm from Calgary and know what most of the roughnecks do for jobs I can tell you, they aren't project managers, engineers, or financial consultants like they otherwise could be if they didn't go play pro. They are highschool teachers, ""personal trainers"", or like Geoff snider and his brother who run their own lacrosse camp/school.   More and more (in the NLL at least) teams are starting to adopt a ""draft local"" mentality. They want guys who live in the area already to play lacrosse for the teams because it means they can have more mid week practices, more video time, more time together as a team. And you can prove this by looking at the drafts. Calgary and Edmonton took (IIRC) 5 guys (at least 2 to Calgary) from Alberta Sr.B this year. That's not even Jr.A or Sr.A, and Alberta Sr.B is typically a little bit of a step down from BC and Ontario Sr.B. But they want local talent over fly in fly out guys who just show up for the Saturday morning practice and Saturday night game. Of course drafting them doesn't mean they make the roster, but it is a huge opportunity for guys to get a tryout. And trust me when I say they want it it, they aren't there for the money, they are there for the game."
lacrosse,32prix,henerydods,2,Wed Apr 15 21:50:00 2015 UTC,"every guy is working a second job to supplement the pay   That second job is playing lacrosse. Nearly all of them make more, often far more, money from their other jobs."

lacrosse,32prix,ManBearPig92,1 point,Sat Apr 18 21:18:23 2015 UTC,"understood, yeah I think if there were an intense atmosphere or the drive to succeed at the professional level, MLL/NLL would be far different."
lacrosse,32prix,henerydods,4,Wed Apr 15 20:25:40 2015 UTC,"Combining the MLL and NLL won't work, because the majority of NLL players aren't going off to play MLL when the season ends so they aren't even connected there. The only reason a lot of the bigger name guys even played MLL last year after NLL season ended was because they wanted to practice for the world outdoors. Most NLL players go out and play Sr.A box here in Canada after it's over. Sure, some of the American guys who play go play field, but guys like Dickson literally take up a protected man spot on a team that they only play on ever 4 years, haha. Pushing the season start ahead for lacrosse won't work either. Then the NLL is competing with the NHL come playoff time, and they can't take that in Canada.   Pushing the MLL season start back and where does their playoffs lay? Too far into the fall? IMO if you want the professional scene to grow, USlacrosse needs to start promoting the indoor game more. Their new facility doesn't even have a indoor playing field planned, and they are in charge of the US indoor team now.   Indoor is much faster, and more exciting to watch vs the outdoor game for a casual fan. Outdoor is like a slow game of chess, it's not bad to watch but it is harder for the casual viewer to get into. Indoor is a more primal, faster, and aggressive version. The creativity and skill that is required to get an open shot and score on a box goalie is so much fun to watch. The atmosphere inside an indoor arena vs outdoor stadium is great for the casual viewer. And there is no statistic that says ""when the NLL is doing good, the MLL gets less viewers because they steal all the viewers."" No, they don't steal them, they don't even play at the same time except for a week or two of playoffs for a select few teams. They compliment each others viewer numbers, so help each other out! US lacrosse ignores the indoor game more than CLA ignores the outdoor game right now, and that's pretty bad. Same with FIL, FIL should be doing more to promote the world indoors like they were for Denver. Maybe some tv adds during some NLL games? Actually, scratch that, nobody can even watch NLL games live because the TSN deal is so shitty. Stupid bell media group.   Indoor >> outdoor anyway, :P"
lacrosse,32prix,ManBearPig92,4,Wed Apr 15 22:12:20 2015 UTC,point taken and I can see that you're a huge indoor fan. As one who was born in America im very used to the outdoor game and I love nothing more than a summer afternoon sitting on a grass hill watching lacrosse. In America I think it'd be different because we wouldn't wanna watch indoor lacrosse while there's beautiful weather out. having indoor during the worse months would give us entertainment while we wouldn't be outside.
lacrosse,32prix,henerydods,1 point,Wed Apr 15 22:16:05 2015 UTC,"I understand that, however NLL already starts at the beginning of February, it's cold weather for us Canadians for most of the season, haha. The problem I think is that it runs for most of your college season. Although I don't think that's really a problem at all though. It coincides with our lacrosse season here though, that's the major part. The last few weeks of the NLL regular season is the first few weeks of the CLA box regular season, so it's kinda a hype thing for us to get kids into out lacrosse season.   The problem is that box lacrosse is for the hockey off season, not for ""winter"" when we cant play lacrosse outside. It was invented to use hockey rinks when they didn't have ice on them. Pre season floor time is really really hard to come by in most Canadian cities because most rinks will still have ice in, so the select few that have taken it out are packed. So it goes from now (games starting in a week I think) till the middle/end of July. So it's a summer ish thing for us. And we are the NLL's main demographic. We play field from after July, till kids go to school or it's too cold to play outside anymore. Then we take a break for hockey season."
lacrosse,32prix,ManBearPig92,4,Thu Apr 16 03:21:53 2015 UTC,Playing indoor is awesome. Watching indoor is like watching paint dry. IMO of course.
lacrosse,32prix,henerydods,2,Thu Apr 16 02:45:33 2015 UTC,"That's a fair opinion man. Everyone has there own preferences (even if they are wrong :P ). I'm curious what's so boring about it to you, because I have honestly never heard anyone say that, although I have a very Canadian and International bias and very little American influence on my game, so that could be it. I just can't see constant transition, constant aggression, and very little down time being boring compared to the slower, more spaced out, and more methodical approach that field has. Although I'm one of those people who strongly advocate that field needs a shot clock. To me watching field lacrosse is like watching basketball before they implemented the shot clock, it's very very slow. But hey man, I respect your opinion and I do truly want to see where you're coming from. How much indoor have you played growing up too? It might give us some insight there too."
lacrosse,32prix,NewYorkerinGeorgia,2,Thu Apr 16 06:38:47 2015 UTC,"I played spring indoor seasons in youth lacrosse for a total of 4 seasons. I can see how possession in field  can slow the pace of the game down but the emphasis on possession and how efficient your offense is really becomes important. Defensive stands and takeaways also become that much more meaningful as well as faceoffs.   I think I might also be biased towards the 6 man sets on offense. The indoor game just feels like watching basketball. Idk, it's hard to explain. In any sport when you can throw away possessions and still win by scoring it just feels like the defensive game doesn't matter as much.   The best I can do is an NBA vs. NHL analogy. In the NBA defense does matter but when your putting up 100 points that makes for a boring game IMO. In hockey, when one possession or turnover can break the game open, things are much more exciting.  Plus goaltending in field is so much more badass than a moving brick of padding."
lacrosse,32prix,henerydods,3,Thu Apr 16 12:17:57 2015 UTC,"That's fair, the indoor game is very similar to basketball in both it's movement patterns, and the possession styles. However NLL averages the exact same goals per game as MLL at 25 goals a game, in the D1 tournament last year they averaged 22 goals a game, and the average goals per game for every NCAA championship game since 1990 is 22 goals per game. So none of them are really that much higher scoring than the others.   Now lets look at field lacrosse strategy of slowing down the game to an extreme, one of the most ""boring"" games as I'm told by many of the American players I know - the USA vs Canada gold medal final at last years worlds in Denver. People were livid with how Canada controlled the ball and USA's defence could do nothing about it. I heard countless people say it was the most boring game they have ever seen because Canada just got the ball and couldn't be stripped of it, and if they were over pressured they would just pass the ball to an open man who would do the same thing, yet that's how we are told field lacrosse should be played.   We are told that it's a possession based game where the defence is responsible for taking that ball back, but I am 100% confident that the best offence in the world is capable of shagging the ball for 10 min against the best defence in the world, without worry. That's why MLL has a 60 second shot clock, because the game is just too slow without it. The reason hockey or soccer doesn't need this is because it's so so much easier to strip a soccer ball or hockey puck than it is a basketball or lacrosse ball. They still slow the pace of the games in those sports, but it's not cripplingly slow because they can't control possession for 5-10min intervals.  So looking at that, I would say that defence actually ends up being that much more emphasized on the box side of things. I think you have to look at it more in terms of 30 second sets (because of the shot clock) where the defence says ""ok, prevent a good shot for the next 30 seconds, and we give our guys a chance."" Now you have successful defencive sets where you don't let them get any high % shots, and failed ones where you let a guy get a really good shot (goal or no goal it's considered a failed defencive play). It becomes a game of 30 second sprints where every possession the offence is trying to generate a goal, vs trying to waist time on the clock. Don't get me wrong, we still waist clock time and slow down the game in box, but we can't do it for 5 min at a time. We will hold the ball for as close to 30 seconds as possible and when we shoot we will shoot for legs hoping for a rebound off the lowers.  I do agree that field goalies are insane though, why you would ever step between the pipes without 6"" of padding covering every inch of your body is beyond me, haha. But there is something to be said about being able to score on those giant bricks in the tiny nets.   Don't get me wrong, I love both games. I am obviously slightly biased towards box though, haha. I will play and watch both versions of lacrosse for as long as I live, I can guarantee that. And I love talking about this stuff with field guys, I love trying to change a few opinions here and there."
lacrosse,32prix,tall_lacrosse_player,2,Thu Apr 16 20:54:34 2015 UTC,Is there a difference between the NCAA game and the pro game? I mean I have really enjoyed the new shot clock rules on held possessions. Regardless you make a good point and nobody likes a defensive showdown in the offensive zone. The NCAA game is pretty much what I watch exclusively and I find it much more exciting than box. Idk I guess the rules can be abused. It just doesn't seem to happen at the NCAA level for whatever reason.
lacrosse,32prix,henerydods,3,Fri Apr 17 06:27:34 2015 UTC,"Yah, the rules get abused at the international level the most IMO, but I also think it's because the FIL field rules are the worst out of every organization so far (in that specific situation only). Main difference is that MLL has a hard 60 second shot clock now, with the clock resetting every time there is a change of possession, shot, or the ball hits the post. Therefore there is no ""keep it in box"" like in NCAA or FIL because they have the 60 second shot clock. I haven't watched too many games with the new 60 second shot clock yet so I can't tell you how much has changed there, I highly suggest you watch a few games this weekend and see where you like it. There is also a stupid 2 point line some yards out in MLL, just pretend it doesn't exist. Also you are allowed to dive into the crease in the MLL, but you have to put the ball in the net before touching the ground or touching the goalie, unlike the NCAA where you can't enter the crease unless you were deemed to be pushed in (meaning things like the air Gait are illegal in the current NCAA game, but legal in the MLL).   I do agree that it doesn't get abused often at the NCAA level, but man when it does it can be bad. Remember last year when Joey Sankey stood behind the Hopkins net for 2 min straight without even moving (here)? That's worse case scenario though, and hopefully the new rules are getting implemented better then that situation did. From the sounds of how you're talking it's going really well though, so that's promising."
lacrosse,32prix,tall_lacrosse_player,2,Fri Apr 17 07:27:51 2015 UTC,"Having played field both with and against pro box players, I can tell you that box players can do very, very well in the outdoor game. They have the talent. If the money was there, I have no doubt they would jump into summer field. It's all about the money.  However, I want to point out that box is not the future in the U.S. That is not what you want to hear, but in the U.S. we have way more open field space than open box space. Tons and tons more. In fact, the writer of the article listed that in his reasons for lacrosse growing."
lacrosse,32prix,Eudaemon9,2,Thu Apr 16 12:05:03 2015 UTC,"Oh yah, the skills from box translate really well over to field, and I 100% agree that if the money was there some of our guys would choose to go down south to play field, but the money isn't there and wont be there for a while in pro field. We do have some of our older guys that are thinking of not going and playing Sr.A box in Canada during the summer and instead playing field. Guys like Curtis Dickson have said that their body can't handle the beatings that box brings them so they might switch over to MLL field instead just so they can get a few extra years in pro lacrosse they otherwise couldn't handle by playing Sr.A in the off season. We also have some die hard box fans though who would never miss a season of Sr.A back home, there are many guys who look at winning a Mann Cup (Sr.A championship) as more important and a bigger achievement than winning a Champions Cup (NLL championship).  Looking at the attendance numbers for MLL last year they averaged around 4750 people a game, and their highest average attendance was in Denver with 10300 a game last year. Among the American teams alone in the NLL they averaged 10500 a game last year, that's more than MLL's highest team average, and the best part is that the Colorado Mammoth, which plays out of the same city as the Outlaws, had an average attendance of 15700 last year. More than the field lacrosse team by 50%.   At the pro level, indoor is doing much better and has a better base than their outdoor counterpart. I believe it's because of 2 things, I believe indoor is easier to watch and more entertaining for the casual viewer (which is incredibly important in American sports and growing the game), and I believe that the atmosphere inside of an enclosed arena will always be louder and more exciting that a large and open field with the same number of people, and that atmosphere is what brings back the casual fan time and time again.   I see the problem with available box space for youth lacrosse, and I don't think box will ever surpass field in the states like it has here in Canada for player base, but it already has in viewer base. We are talking professional lacrosse here after all, not youth. I do believe that US lacrosse should put more effort into box though. It doesn't hurt field, they compliment each other so well that it only helps field, look at Denver! Denver has the most attendance in BOTH field and indoor, and that's awesome. So to push it off and completely ignore it like US lacrosse only appears to hurt the over all growth of the game IMO. Growing box will grow field in the American demographic, it might not be the end all be all, but it can't be ignored."
lacrosse,32prix,concussed_cowboy,2,Thu Apr 16 21:46:53 2015 UTC,"I think there are a number of problems, in reality before MLL becomes big, it needs to appeal to people from non-lacrosse backgrounds. As someone who's shown lacrosse to people who don't play there is a huge issue that people who haven't played lacrosse do not have a clue what's going on; as (especially if you're watching a web stream) the ball is impossible to see and you have to know the body language of the players to tell what's going on. I've started watching hockey and experienced this but i think (correct me if i'm wrong) hockey has a much wider player base than lacrosse in the US. On top of this, if you're watching a game and the camera man is trying to follow the ball around the pitch it makes for very jerky camera work that often misses the crease quick stick or whatever. As an organisation the MLL needs to find a way to get 'non players' interested, I know previously they've made videos where the ball 'glowed' (cant find the youtube link but it was like 2003) perhaps this is something to look into again."
lacrosse,32prix,concussed_cowboy,2,Thu Apr 16 15:23:29 2015 UTC,"Oh god, please don't make the ball glow for the casual viewer. They tried that for hockey once a little while ago, it was terrible. Nobody liked it, not even the casual viewer."

lacrosse,32prix,mealy58,1 point,Fri Apr 17 03:32:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think parents will begin to protect their kids from playing football. As a result, these kids will begin to play lacrosse."
lacrosse,32prix,NewYorkerinGeorgia,2,Fri Apr 17 15:56:14 2015 UTC,"Being a football player and being around other people of various ages, more and more people are playing football at the lower levels. The actual number of parents taking their kids out of football is actually lower than you would think.  What I meant was that in the 1920's and 1930's, the NFL was a struggling league. Few franchises that struggled to have a secure foundation to stay in the same location. Players salaries were very  minimal. College football was a lot more popular and viewed as more official almost. They drew much larger crowds and it was commonly believed that the college all stars would destroy the NFL all stars.   Now I don't know if I'd go as extreme as to say the NCAA all stars would beat the MLL all stars. But college lax is a lot more popular and as you saw with LXM Pro, not all of the best players were going to play in the MLL. And where they play is dictated a lot by where they are from because lacrosse is a secondary job."
lacrosse,32prix,mealy58,1 point,Fri Apr 17 16:13:29 2015 UTC,I think when their kids grow up with their dads going through post concussion/CTE problems those numbers will start to decline. that's hypothetical to my opinion though. thanks for the feedback man I truly appreciate it
lacrosse,32prix,newaccoutn1,2,Fri Apr 17 16:25:59 2015 UTC,"It makes sense! Like I said I was a football player actually quit because of concussions to play lacrosse full time and focus on my lacrosse career. (Hense the name concussed cowboy) I think peopole do need to raise their awareness of CTE and post concussion symptoms. The only problem with that though is most children's fathers wont play in the NFL and they wont see these issues directly.  I loved seeing your points though man, they all make sense. I could talk about this stuff forever!"

Now that the summer has approached I used it in my first tournament and it has pretty much failed. The head has lost nearly all stiffness and has warped badly as I am constantly pushing it back in place after every GB/ Poke check. Also I had to restring it after the tournament because the pocket completely changed  due to the warping. Saying this I do believe it is still the best defensive head on the market after 4-5 months of heavy use in 90 degree weather what can you expect. I have used STX Hammers, x10s, and Proton u but the Maverik Tank is superior in terms of durability and functionality."

lacrosse,32nikc,MeatSnake9,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:03:28 2015 UTC,"My team calls it the V card. It's is similar to a laser move. You simply are swiping down the line to slide the ball out quickly.   Just make sure your head is as close to the ball as possible and when the whistle blows slide your hands and stick straight down the line to the left pulling the ball out. The friction of your stick rubbing the ball should get it out. If not, make your first move slightly towards the ball and then straight down the line to ensure your stick is ""raking"" the ball out and forwards to create a quick win and ideally a fast break"
lacrosse,32nikc,BuzzBy_Spicoli,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:40:16 2015 UTC,"Just my two cents here, but I honestly think you don't need to know any more moves than that. Honestly, getting a really good clamp/plunger and a decent jam for when you're getting smoked can go a long way."

lacrosse,32n231,alienator064,8,Wed Apr 15 02:50:51 2015 UTC,"OK... First thing, if you are losing 7-0, 6-0 and 6-2 your problem is offense not goalie. If you are a starting attack, the coach may simply think the team is better off with you there. Second what level of lacrosse are we talking about and how old are you two on that level.   A coach can decide we aren't going to win too many games with this talent, I'm going to start a sophomore who I think can become good over a senior who is better because we will be a better program a year or two down the line.   A player, especially a goalie should not lose his job due to injury. Again if you guys are getting shut out, the goalie could have the game of his life and you are still going to lose.   So I guess we need some more info. Also most coaches hate it wen kids are asking for PT or to play out of position. He may simply not see you as a goalie and is perhaps annoyed you aren't putting the effort into your original chosen or assigned position."
lacrosse,32n231,newswilson,1 point,Wed Apr 15 03:50:09 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not starting attack, and that's the thing. I'm not very good at attack, so I think that I'd be better serving the team in goal.   I agree that our offense is weak, but our defense is pretty good. The reason why we let in a lot of shots is because a) We never have possession and b) we can't clear the ball. I really hate to brag in real life, so I don't think I could actually explicitly say I should be in goal.   Maybe our middies are weak. I haven't been playing enough to know. We are a middle school team, and Chad is 7th and I'm 8th. We are both on the B team."

lacrosse,32n231,Alcoholic_jesus,3,Tue Apr 21 15:17:00 2015 UTC,Successful people ask lots of questions. Not the same one repeatedly. Make your desire to play known to your coach. Are you young?
lacrosse,32n231,VexAndSilence,2,Wed Apr 15 03:21:41 2015 UTC,"score is anything to zero   Your team's offense is the problem. Your coach is worried about coaching a team that can score more than 2 goals in a game. With that in mind, who starts in goal is probably not his first priority right now.  It's a team game. Consider whether playing goalie or scoring goals would help most. If you have questions about how to play attack, look up recommendations online and narrow your questions down to a few to ask your coach. If you really think you'd make a better goalie, get better at playing that position and don't pester your coach."
lacrosse,32n231,SapienChavez,2,Wed Apr 15 06:28:05 2015 UTC,"nothing really, without knowing the personalities involved.  your best bet is to lobby your defense to pressure the coach as to who THEY want as their leader on the field.  stopping goals is only part of our (i played in goal for 10+ years) job.  reading the field and coordinating defense is huge.  playing properly and you stop goals with your voice!  i too have a coach's son story and it has stuck with me for over 25 years.  i will NEVER forget.  i was playing baseball and at-bat.  a kid tried to steal and was thrown-out for the third out.  according to the rules, i was to get a fresh at-bat the next inning.  Coach subbed me with his son, so his son could get the lead-off at-bat.    this story was with me EVERY single day i played and coached lacrosse.  and i never let my co/assistant coaches favor their sons."

lacrosse,32negm,shdlax75,9,Wed Apr 15 04:25:16 2015 UTC,"Our job isn't to score. An offensive LSM's job is to push transition and get assists. Obviously the first look is to shoot but then dump to the point attack or to the side if it is a 5 on 4 and cut to crease and pull out. After playing in college you realize most teams won't include their LSM in their offensive set past transition. I will push, stay on and be an outlet, then when we get a mid at the 50 yard line I will sub off. I've had a few goals in my career but many more assists. It's important to know when you are helping the team and when you are burdening the team. When it's your time to sub, sub. A short stick middie can (at least should) do the offense better than a pole in pretty much every case after transition."
lacrosse,32negm,SouthernLaxProbs,3,Wed Apr 15 04:58:50 2015 UTC,"I think it all starts with good stick skills. CJ Costabile was on the man up team with his pole in high school. It is really easy to ruin a chance to score by not having a good stick. Next I think is ground ball skills. Picking up a loose ball at the top of the box the first time is an awesome way to push transition. After that I think is breaking out after a shot is really important. As soon as an offensive player shoots you should running up field for an over the shoulder outlet pass. Either the ball goes wide and you get back in the hole, the shot goes in and its a face off, or the goalie saves it and you're already 20 yards ahead of everyone. The last part of it is playing good transition offense. Hitting the point man is the most important part of a fast break. If you don't, you kill the break and look like an idiot. If you don't have a traditional L shaped fast break, the offense will be in a ""flat break"" situation. The easiest way to score here is pass to your wing and cut to crease looking for a give and go or a feed from x. A lot of trailing mids will kinda forget to follow you if you cut right after you pass so you might get a quick shot.  All of that being said though I have to say, scoring in lacrosse is like hitting on a girl. If you try too hard to do it, it'll never happen. Let it come to you and good things will happen."

lacrosse,32mwmi,logggo,9,Wed Apr 15 01:49:09 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it but you're going to need some thicker skin. Also look at how much you're criticizing your teammates. If you're nit picking every little detail from the underclassmen they might just be giving you a piece of your own medicine. Try to take a look at what mistakes they are pointing out, are you making the same mistake over and over again? Was the mistake called by a problem with your equipment which can be fixed?  When dealing with your teammates, just give a quick ""my bad"" after whatever criticism they point out and let it go. Other than that, just play your ass off when you're on the field and you only need to worry about what the coach has to say, he/she determines they playing time not your teammates."

On to what you should do. Make your damn team better and quit worrying about your precious ego. Look at it this way, a bunch of underclassmen can see what's wrong with your game as a senior and instead of fixing it, you're worried about getting them to...what? Stop helping their team? Stop trying to constantly improve every lacrosse player around them? That's what this sport is kid.  Let's say you go to college, play some lacrosse on a club team, and you guys end up going d1 when you're a junior. Guess what? Almost EVERY freshman is going to be better than you.  Now we're past college and in the work force. Let's say you're in Business. I guess you probably shouldn't though, on the basis that one of the managers might be younger or less experienced. Whether or not he's more talented is irrelevant, its still your job to work for him.  Look, I get it. High school and being a teenager and all that is tough and you feel like you get no respect. That doesn't change. You just realize its not about how those that look up to you show that they do. Its about showing the people that look up to you what self respect looks like.  Tl;Dr: that doesn't go away, nor should it."
lacrosse,32mwmi,VexAndSilence,2,Wed Apr 15 12:01:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this is actually one of the comments I was wondering if I would see. I often think about how to balance stuff like ego because I don't want a big head, yet it would really suck if the younger guys (the majority of the team) didn't respect me. Do you think that respect from other team mates should just come naturally?"
lacrosse,32mwmi,jewunit,3,Wed Apr 15 13:57:07 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you mean by come naturally. If you mean that you can't force it, you're absolutely right.   Here's a tip that worked wonders for me on both sides and one that I've adapted to more situations I can count:   When anyone points out a weakness, PROVE you're working on it. If it's with your shot, come back with, ""I really need to work on that part of my game. I'm gonna stay after or come in early to take 100 shots a day for the next couple weeks. Join me? I'm sure we could both use it.""   That's going to serve two purposes, one is my first point about proving you'll work on it. The other is that if the kid is actually just being a shit, he's going to embarrass himself. Either way, follow through and do what you said and see who shows up.   The first time I did it, the kid that called me out didn't show. There were, however, 5 kids there that DID want the practice, including our superstar upperclassman attacker. Respect? I never worried about it again.  Let's say its worst case scenario and its raining and no one wants to stay over. You think the image of you out there ripping shots in the rain when everyone else is tired and going home won't stick with them?  In team sports, especially this one, you earn respect by working harder than anyone else, leaving everything on the field every time you get the privilege of pulling on those gloves and picking up your crosse. Whether it's at u11 practice or playing in the NCAA championship, dig deeper, drive harder, and push yourself farther with the help of your team than you ever could alone and you won't have to worry about respect."
lacrosse,32mwmi,FlyingFake,5,Wed Apr 15 14:31:08 2015 UTC,"It's not about age and it's not about who starts. It's about having thick enough skin to accept valid criticism, whatever the source. If some kid points out something and you're sure he'd have made the same mistake, be a role model, take it on the chin, and improve, like you'd want him to when he's an upperclassman and a freshman points out a mistake he makes."
lacrosse,32mwmi,TheJonosaurusRex,3,Wed Apr 15 06:22:35 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry about it too much. It's really situation dependent on how you react, but no matter what just try to take it in stride.  If they're wrong just brush it off or maybe try to explain to them why they're wrong (though honestly sometimes being a dick about it can be helpful, use your own judgement).  If they're right and everyone knows it just go with a ""ya I fucked up"" type response.  If they're right and just being kids who really are just trying to embarrass you then return the favor and embarrass them on the field and show them you know what the fuck you are doing.   Personally I learned a lot from the older kids I played with in middle/high school who were really fucking good. Most of the times I learned from them it was when I was trying to hang with them when I shouldn't be. In the end it was good for me that I was a little shit about it, but only because they put me right back in my place. And even then I would like to think there was a thing or two they learned from me, because at the end of the day there was a reason I was playing with them too."

lacrosse,32my7o,gstad,1 point,Wed Apr 15 03:41:49 2015 UTC,"So this was off of a ground ball and the other team's girl went from picking up the ball, with my girl right behind her, to turning around and plowing into her. My girl had her feet planted, but because she saw the collision coming (and it was a big hit), she shifted her weight and kinda popped her hip out to brace for it--if that makes sense?  So on the one hand, the defender didn't see my girl, so that's an argument for her side, but definitely my girl was in space she had rightfully claimed, with her feet planted (albeit with that shift of her weight like I said). I know there is the gray area with whose space it was and that that's a hard call to make, but she was definitely in space that was rightfully hers.   IDK if any of that makes sense to you as a bball player (I used to play basketball and I was actually looking at some bball forums re this question), but I mean at the end of the day, I still feel as though it has to be either a block or a charge. I just don't see a girl MOVING into space and getting a charge (feet planted), nor do I see a girl with her feet planted getting a block regardless of whether or not the defender saw her. There are a lot of calls in lacrosse (probably most obviously shooting space if you are defending a girl behind the crease) that are unavoidable but happen regardless of intent/awareness. If you plow into a girl right behind you, it's still a call on you whether or not the intent or awareness?"
lacrosse,32my7o,newswilson,2,Wed Apr 15 04:01:00 2015 UTC,"Yes you can. The criteria for both are separate it is not comparable to basketball where it is an either or situation.   2015 Rule book says: Blocking: block her opponent by moving into her path without giving her a chance to stop or change direction. Charging: charge, barge, shoulder, or back into an opponent.  So you could have a girl jump into the path of another and the girl being blocked lower her should and run through the girl blocking her. Double penalties would result. Similar penalties happen in the boys game."
lacrosse,32my7o,newswilson,2,Wed Apr 15 03:58:02 2015 UTC,"Okay...that makes a lot more sense. I have always understood it as a MOVING thing though. If a girl was stationary feet-wise, but her body was moving, do you think that would fall under a grey area?"
lacrosse,32my7o,ThetaGamma2,1 point,Wed Apr 15 04:32:05 2015 UTC,"It is a bang - bang play for the official. You have to remember most don't call lacrosse to the letter of the rule book. Doing so makes the game super choppy when official makes a call it is to get players to follow the rules, protect player safety or eliminate something illegal that results in a competitive advantage."
lacrosse,32my7o,dpaul1997,1 point,Wed Apr 15 11:30:10 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: Never umpired girls'.  The rule doesn't address feet, it just says ""moving into her path"". I could plant my feet and lean into somebody like a shoulder- or hip-check. I suspect that would be considered blocking. If that other player were lowering a shoulder into me at the time that I was laying a hip into her, I suspect that could be simultaneously a block and a charge.  In basketball, one of the elements of blocking is ""doesn't have both feet on the ground"", but that wording doesn't appear in the book for lacrosse. Consequently, a basketball block may not be a lacrosse block, and vice versa."

The kids who are the backup's backups are probably on par with most of their opponents starters. Are you suggesting once they get in they should just run around in circles and play catch? That seems a lot more fucking degrading to me.  OCC gets top level D1 talent that doesn't go straight to D1 schools for whatever reason. Wins like that are bound to happen and it's fairly unavoidable.
lacrosse,32ktfx,dj_bpayne,7,Tue Apr 14 17:23:31 2015 UTC,"What a ridiculous point. If you can't handle getting your ass kicked you probably shouldn't be playing sports beyond middle school.   I have to disagree with you here - sportsmanship and learning how to win are absolutely an integral part of high school athletics ... pouncing a HS team by 20+ is classless. No one, at that point, is learning anything other than to hate the other guy/team. As a coach, if you are going to trounce a team... plan ahead and get your starters out and backups in sooner... I'm old so not sure how the rest of /r/lacrosse was taught but at the 15-point differential you all go lefty (or you try to get that one kid who never sees the field a righty goal)... at 18/19-point differential, yes you just play pass... the unwritten rule was never 20... and I tell my guys anything past 18-point differential is a mile-run per goal... so if they really want it or need it, they know the price.   However, I also agree with you... once you graduate high school and are considered by society an adult... man the fuck up and play the game.   Are you suggesting once they get in they should just run around in circles and play catch? That seems a lot more fucking degrading to me.   That would be poor coaching ... pull your starters and 2's for the 3rd quarter... while the 3/4s are getting work in... put an entirely new scheme in for your 1/2's... and see how they run it (without shooting is fine... probably learn more). The difference from getting beat by 16 and 25 really is the same amount of degrading and butthurt, in my experience.    OCC gets top level D1 talent that doesn't go straight to D1 schools for whatever reason.    Grades, man. Still need to have a college-entry education... for most, this is what was lacking coming out of HS."
lacrosse,32ktfx,jewunit,2,Tue Apr 14 17:38:43 2015 UTC,or you try to get that one kid who never sees the field a righty goal   This scenario is when I put my goalie at attack and let him loose (with a short stick of course). Always fun to see a goalie try to shoot under pressure
lacrosse,32ktfx,EducatedGenus,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:12:39 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying is there comes a point when the talent level is so different that it's not a class or sportsmanship thing. The line to be drawn is up for debate, sure, and I guess I would actually draw it at the varsity level depending on the general level of competition. Even the second and third string guys who play at OCC are pretty damn good, so it's not like pulling the starters is going to make it that much better. Not letting your second and third guys play hard just because they are that much better than the other team isn't fair to them.  I know grades is a reason (a big reason). I mean ""for whatever reason"" as in there are multiple reasons, not that the reasons are lost on me."

True on the above post; my point would still be pull your 1's and 2's earlier and put in the 3's and 4's to let them run.

I don't know much about about the defensive side of the ball, but UVA's young defense will be better next season as they get older and have some experience under their belt. I agree with the other commenters that really good players are popping up all over the country, so there's more talent across the board that all D1 schools can recruit. As for Coach Starsia, it may be nearing the end of his coaching career based on his age, not his performance as a coach.

lacrosse,32i8fy,MeatSnake9,8,Tue Apr 14 03:48:48 2015 UTC,"1) You really don't need to be dodging with a pole, especially on a clear. If you don't have the ball, find a way to get open. If you do, power through your man or dump it to somebody open. Don't get cute, especially with a pole, that's just asking for trouble.  2) Practice. The only surefire way they're going to learn to have grace under pressure is if your defense doesn't let up on them in practice. You know what they say, ""practice makes perfect""."
lacrosse,32i8fy,ProfaneTank,2,Tue Apr 14 01:01:16 2015 UTC,Yeah I know dodging seems dumb but my coach really wants me to because our midfield is not good at helping on clears
lacrosse,32i8fy,ProfaneTank,1 point,Wed Apr 15 00:43:17 2015 UTC,"Ok, then it looks like you've got three options here.  1) Somebody else said a roll dodge on here. Personally, I agree because poles tend to get eaten alive on face dodges from what I've seen.  2) Fake a pass? It might work.  3) This is my favorite option. Get better midfielders. That's like half of what middies are supposed to do: get open. I'm genuinely surprised that your coach thinks his middies are that hopeless. Granted, I don't know the whole story but it really shouldn't be all on you to take it so far up that you need to dodge. On the plus side, it looks like your coach has a lot of faith in you, so you've got that going for you, which is nice.  TLDR: Roll, I guess. Fake it 'til you make it. Oh, and chew out your middies."
lacrosse,32i8fy,jaab1997,2,Wed Apr 15 01:13:31 2015 UTC,"U can't really dodge with a pole, you could be the best stick on the field but you still has 6 feet of pole to check.   To play against us, just make crisp passes. Good defensemen will only check when not going toward the goal. Then play with the body when attacking. Then tell your teammates to just keep running to get a good pass."
lacrosse,32i8fy,ogfusername,2,Tue Apr 14 00:45:09 2015 UTC,"I would say spin moves are key if ur just trying to get past a middy in transition. They usually don't expect to get dodged on by a pole so if you have quick feet you can blow right past some decent middies. Go hard on them 24/7 in practice.  Only way to learn how is to do it, and do it a lot."
lacrosse,32i8fy,vincej7,2,Tue Apr 14 02:49:59 2015 UTC,"As an LSM, my favorite dodge is anything that ends with walking the dog. Most of the time it's just a face dodge or a stutter step and then using my body to block the middle from checking my stick"

lacrosse,32i8fy,smilli02,1 point,Tue Apr 14 10:58:14 2015 UTC,"Don't dodge on a settle clear.  There are 7 clearers against 6 riders.  Just pass to the open guy. Practice is the simple answer, but there are 2 things that help - creating separation and timing their pass vs. the check.  When you're passing with a pole pressuring you, you need to make sure he doesnt get a good timed/placed poke check or lift.  Do this by stepping outside of effective checking range or timing it immediately after a check and before he can make another one."
lacrosse,32i8fy,Kingkern,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:37:44 2015 UTC,"Roll away from pressure.  If an attackman is pressuring you, take a big roll dodge and move back on the field.  You have 20 seconds to clear - it's a lot longer than you think."

lacrosse,32h0dy,wheelman1,3,Mon Apr 13 18:58:31 2015 UTC,"Approaching your coach with the right tone and a positive attitude will go a long ways in his/hers reaction and openness to your idea. As a coach I try to be open to player suggestions and honest in my relationship with my players. If you feel that you will not be able to help the team and get more minutes bringing it to your coaches attention is not a bad thing. The idea of changing positions needs to be framed in a way that it will not only benefit you, but will benefit the team. Be prepared to explain why you changing positions will be a mutual benefit and be prepared for him/her to say no or be hesitant to the idea. Coaches generally don't like realizing they have had a player in the wrong position. Good luck and PM me with any questions."
lacrosse,32h0dy,Sconnieworker,2,Mon Apr 13 19:18:21 2015 UTC,Approaching your coach is the absolute correct thing to do and do it soon. I would however in your free time after practice and on weekends start practicing face-offs. When you have that conversation with your coach about the positions change he will be a lot more receptive to it when he sees you excelling at practice or doing well in face-off drills. I had two players change positions this season and it was the best thing for them and it is always exciting when the player wants the change they put their heart and soul into it.

A practice after a big win is a good time to try a new spot, and I will let them. Also, if it seems like a fit, and isn't going to hurt us, I'll give him a shift or two during a big blowout (winning, or losing). Sometimes it sticks, sometimes it doesn't.  However, if you're considerably better at one spot, it can be tough to get a coach to let you change. That's where off-season ball becomes so important. When I don't agree with what a players sees himself as, I politely tell him that he should find camps, clinics, summer leagues, or travel teams, and pour himself into the new position to be ready as a starter next year."

Remember to get back into it slowly though. It'll take six months to get back on the field and another 3 months to be back where you were before the injury. Good luck.

lacrosse,32e7ho,Check_the_shrek,2,Mon Apr 13 01:41:01 2015 UTC,"Hi! I played lacrosse in highschool (attack) and went to this lacrosse camp twice. I was also considering USAFA for school. The camp is fun. How many years of experience do you have? I would say that this camp, at least when I went around 5 & 7 years ago, (wow that's weird to think about..) was not for highly experienced players. My teammates and I who I went with were without a doubt in the top 10% of players there with only 3 years of lacrosse experience. If you are very good and looking purely for a lacrosse camp I would suggest a lacrosse camp elsewhere. However, knowing that you want to attend the Academy makes me say you should go- especially if you are very good and want to play for the school. It is a way to get in front of the coaches. One of my buddies won the MVP award for the camp and the coaches tried to recruit him afterwards. So it is valuable experience, but NOT the most pressing lacrosse camp- there are many better throughout the nation for similar prices."
lacrosse,32e7ho,conn6614,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:14:57 2015 UTC,"I have 2 years as a field player and 3 as a goalie, and although I dream of playing lacrosse there, it's simply not realistic right now, I would not consider myself ""very good""."

lacrosse,32e4kj,98rmanchester,1 point,Wed Apr 15 01:35:32 2015 UTC,"Im guessing he runs the basic 2 horizontal lines of 3 zone, my team runs pretty much only that defensive play as well and I happen to be the center defender too. My advice to you is to keep your head on a swivel between the ball the guy on the crease and the guy at x. You need to worry about the x man creeping up the sides and when that happens you should play him but not to aggressively and one of the d middies or your left side lp should pick him up. And also when they pass it to the crease man just light his ass up because even if you get a penalty its better then a goal."
lacrosse,32e4kj,AllahSnackbar69,1 point,Wed Apr 15 04:22:07 2015 UTC,"This allows for a lot of flexibility. Make sure you're head is on a swivel and the x man as mentioned.  Also a big one is to make sure the defense doesn't get to pinched in. Keep communication and establish landmarks.  When playing against a zone offensively, obviously, their goal is to pinch and skip the pass.   The obvious counter is to keep comunication, sticks up, and stay INFLATED.   Ask me of you have more specific questions."

I grew up strictly with field lacrosse so I'm biased but I enjoy the open field and watching a game that I'm much more accustomed to. Being able to understand the plays they run and all the player movements are big factors as well.
lacrosse,32a92s,ProfaneTank,3,Sun Apr 12 01:54:32 2015 UTC,"I grew up playing box and I really enjoyed indoor lax. I got to meet a lot of players and went to a lot of Shamrox games growing up, so I really like NLL. However, I play a lot of field now and it's mostly what I watch due to the NLL's weird streaming policies. I've already decided to get more into MLL this season (I took a break from watching once the Machine left Chicago). The one issue I have with the MLL is that stupid 2 point line.

I would be willing to pay like 50$ just to watch the season of lacrosse, but they won't even let me do that. I can only watch the game if I pay for a FULL tv subscription, and I don't watch tv! That's over 50$ a month for something I won't use, no thanks. I watch EVERY game last year when TLN was broadcasting. Best season ever was last year, and TSN dinked it this year.

One of the other attackmen taught me a lot last year when he was on varsity and I was on jv. Now that my fucking up affects playing with him, he gets mad at me. Outside of games, hes the nicest fucking guy and I want to make him proud. I kept making stupid panic mistakes when a dpole rushed me.

lacrosse,328daj,peebsunz,1 point,Sat Apr 11 15:28:24 2015 UTC,I'm a Junior. Was on Varsity last year as a Sophomore as well. There is another kid from my school that feels the same as well as one of our keepers that goes to a different school as well. In total there are about 5-6 of us that feel this way. There are a few already starters that see this as well. The only problem is the kids that are benefiting from this make the team about a 50/50 split. You can even see it as far as who makes Varsity and JV. It really is dividing the team and tearing us apart. I don't want to be the drama queen to complain about it openly to everyone on the team. I'd rather just put in the hard work at practice. But obviously it means nothing. At the same time though I'm tired of seeing my brothers and I get screwed other
lacrosse,328daj,henerydods,1 point,Sat Apr 11 17:03:59 2015 UTC,"Sometimes in life you have to be a drama queen. That being said, you don't have to act like it when you confront the team. Talk to them as a whole, without the coach, and talk to them like adults, come out and say ""hey, I and many others on this team who I won't name unless they want to stand up personally feel that... Etc."" you have to learn to stand up for yourself sometimes. It can be an awkward thing to do, but it can be done in a respectful and adult way.   Things like this can happen anywhere in life, and often do. Get transferred to a new town with work? Let's hope their welcoming, or the home towners are going to get preference the whole time. Being able to deal with this will be a good life lesson for you.   Think of it like this, practice and spend a bunch of time with people you are slowly starting to resent and slowly watch the team crumble into nothing, or stand up for some positive change. Sure things might go bad, but there comes a point where the risk and the reward balance out and you have to take that risk. Worse comes to worse your failing team crumbles and you go start your own team somewhere else, best outcome is that your team becomes better and stronger.   If your whole team comes together and agrees, then as a team you now need to go talk to your coach. Not individually, but as a team. If your coach doesn't change things after that, then it's time to talk to the athletic director. Remember though that as a coach, he doesn't select the best players and put them out there, he selects the beast TEAM and puts them out there."

lacrosse,322fwj,AggresivePickle,6,Fri Apr 10 01:07:15 2015 UTC,"Well the first thing you should do before taking the advice of strangers is talk to your coach. There is nothing anyone on here will say to you that will matter as much as what he says.   I can tell you as a coach that putting the most talent on the field is not the same as as putting the best team on the field. I can give you a list of probable reasons as to why you are not starting, but you will probably not like it.   Let me know if you want all of the possible/probable reasons, but you really need to talk to your coach about your PT.   I would caution you against coming at him from the angle of I am better than the other guy, because he may take that as you questioning his decisions. He may also just shoot back that you aren't as good as you think you are etc, and that will leave you in a bad spot.   Ask him what you can do to get more playing time and reps in practice."
lacrosse,322fwj,newswilson,3,Fri Apr 10 02:17:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know about your team dynamic, but up here the goalies decide who's getting more shots in practice, and if a team has a goalie coach then he has some influence as well. At the end of the day you have to fight for those reps in practice. Jump in cage when ever you can, make sure the other goalie knows you want to be in that cage. Really work for those shots and your coach will see. There is a certain level of politics involved in all sports that you have to learn and deal with, this is one of those shitty parts of it. Work for it and you'll get it, don't worry about that."
lacrosse,322fwj,henerydods,1 point,Fri Apr 10 04:34:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. Goalie here. Whenever I played, the coaches would usually like whatever goalie in net who wants to jump in.

lacrosse,31zkkt,Jroo158,2,Thu Apr 9 15:12:30 2015 UTC,"My favorite kidney pads currently are the under armor ones, they are great. Arm pads, STX makes a great box version of the Cell pad with extra protection on the inside of the wrists. I personally use the Stallions and like them a lot. Bicept pads are pretty much all the same, shoulder pads are personal preference IMO, so not much there. Gloves are hard to say, I've heard good things of the UA ones, harrow makes some decent ones at a good price, but it's pretty much the same as field when it comes to gloves imo. May a little bulkier but more protection if you want. I have been using Warrior MacDaddies for ever and I like them.   Heads and shafts, well I get my shafts out of the discount bin, and currently use an un pinched STX surgeon with the normal big bag pocket. Normally I would pinch it a bit, but I wanted to make that post a while ago about making a NCAA legal box lacrosse pocket, and fell in love with it so I haven't changed it since.   Most guys like a really stiff head, so they get the big, wide defence heads or the slightly narrower middy heads and they pinch them down to the face shape they like. Some of our attack only guys like the lighter attack heads, but still we tend to pinch them. Very rarely, but it still happens, do you find someone who prefers the super wide heads, guys like Mark Matthews plays with them though, so don't think they are bad. Bottom line is usually big bag for holding the ball and two hand power cradling, and very little whip for fast, accurate, consistent, and quick shots and passes."

Many teams have very poor goalie pockets because so few people seem to know how to string a goalie head well these days. If you don't have any problems making long throws with a field stick, find a solid place to get your stick restrung. Or even better, teach yourself and string it on your own. If the issue is your actual throwing technique, see these other comments."
lacrosse,31y4oq,Rasta_Platypus,20,Thu Apr 9 03:45:14 2015 UTC,"so when you're clearing, technically you have an extra man on your team since you can walk around with the ball- 3 opposing attack, 3 opposing mids vs you, your 3 D and 3 mids- so there will usually always be an open man.   i like to walk slowly and read the situation, and if i don't have any good cutters or open men, i'll walk towards one of my d-men who is covered, and wait for the attack to jump and try to play me. while he does that, that d becomes free and you can either lob it over the attackman or roll it over to them.  its a great backup and takes some pressure off the long throws."

lacrosse,31y4oq,NotaCanadianSpy,6,Thu Apr 9 15:15:53 2015 UTC,"One of the first things we teach our new goalies is that you have to create an arch when throwing a ball with a goalie stick.  If you have experience throwing with a normal lacrosse stick this may prove difficult at first if you do not adjust your mechanics.   As you reach back to throw keep your stick angle up above 30 degrees so you don'`t dump the ball into the goal, To throw, reach out (behind) and arch your stick overhand as almost as high as you can, Think like you are starting a rainbow with your stick.  The distance the ball travels will obviously depend on the force/speed at which you move the head. This very basic motion of creating as big an arch as you can control will help you a great deal."
lacrosse,31y4oq,havegrav,3,Thu Apr 9 13:11:01 2015 UTC,Make sure your stick is strung good too. If you can't pass constantly even after hitting the wall for a while it may very well be the way your stick is strung. I restrung mine this year after noticing that and it throws like a dime now.
lacrosse,31y4oq,rand0m_task,1 point,Thu Apr 9 02:37:01 2015 UTC,"After practice I used to (by coach's request) pick a player to stay with me while I'd throw 15 long passes to them as they break away from goal.

lacrosse,31y4oq,jewunit,1 point,Thu Apr 9 13:27:46 2015 UTC,"Stick aside, a good drill I use is wall ball, but stand waaaay back and throw it really hard, try to hit the same brick every time. Be sure when you're doing this to focus on keeping your arms out, feet positioned well, throw with your entire body. In games, first thing you do when you make a save is look at your middies. As they get set, focus less on them and look more to your poles. Try to stay away from dodging or clearing it yourself if you can, but you should at least look like a threat so they're forced to play you, leaving someone open. Good luck!"
lacrosse,31y4oq,Buddha506,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:37:55 2015 UTC,"I played goalie in high school too, and first think you need to know is that you have four seconds in the crease before you have to either throw it or get out of the crease, and you can't go back in. I'd say the best thing to do is survey the area as quickly as possible, and if an attack man is close enough trying to interfere throw it as hard as you can and follow through and hit him with the follow through. It means he's in the way of the clear and its a free clear. I'm not strong either, I can barely throw it half a field, my suggestion is if you can't find anything just run it out, someone is going to have to get to you and thus leave their man, then throw it to that guy."
lacrosse,31y4oq,PetrifiedPat,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:46:02 2015 UTC,"First off you should put in tons of work on clearing. Making the save is almost useless if you can't get the ball to your offense after. The biggest improvement I made to my game at the high school level was becoming an effective clearing goalie. Get good enough and it becomes your opportunity to play offense.  Get your stick strung by someone/someplace that knows what they are doing. Then play a shitload of wall ball. How your stick throws when it's first strung will often be very different than when it's broken in, so you have to really work it.   Learn how to make smaller adjustments on your own. Goalie sticks are really fucking finicky and if you can't fix things like pocket depth or how much whip you have it won't take long before your stick isn't throwing how you want it and you'll have to get it restrung and break it in all over again.  Find a place that has a lot of space so you can stand very far from the wall. Bring some tape or chalk and draw a small square on the wall for a target. Start close (10-15 yards) and don't back up until you're hitting the target consistently from the current distance. And just like every other American field player you should be able to use both hands (this is arguable, but I'm in the both hands for goalies camp).  If you have the resources make long passing part of your warmup routine. Have an assistant coach, or a player if you do your warmups before the rest of the team hits the field, stand at various places along the box (we'll start close for now) and after every third shot pass it to them after the save.  Consider cutting down your shaft."

lacrosse,31yn1u,joyand,1 point,Thu Apr 9 04:21:10 2015 UTC,"First is to extend your arms. Just rep that motion without a ball. 50 times right then 50 left. Extension is the most important thing. Then workout your core muscles, that's where power comes from. It's all in the torque of your body. Practice shooting from your knees to rely a lot on your mid section, but don't forget that your footwork is very important too."
lacrosse,31yn1u,Gedzfew,2,Thu Apr 9 05:51:39 2015 UTC,"A good drill for this is taking a knee 7-10' from a chain link fence, with your shoulders and hips facing perpendicular to the fence. From a knee, rip shots into the fence, don't worry about picking a spot, worry about keeping your elbows up, rotating through the shot, and working through an overhead motion.   Obviously, work both sides."
lacrosse,31yn1u,newswilson,1 point,Thu Apr 9 13:09:37 2015 UTC,"A drill you can try is the ""Two cage"" drill. Basically you set one goal in front of another by 10 to 15 yards and shoot over the first goal into the second. Unless you are well over 6 feet this will help you focus on extension .  Once you get the extension down and have increased the arc of your head you can work on your velocity.   It has the effect of using a trainer harness in golf to lock in your form. Once your form is somewhat squared away you can focus on your velocity. Hopefully you will need to reach up and back and possibly jump to shoot."

lacrosse,31y9yy,renegadeboat,2,Fri Apr 10 00:25:03 2015 UTC,If you like the bendability of regular gloves get the Stx shield pro goalie gloves. I just got them this year and I love how bendable the thumb is compared to previous goalie gloves. Also it's great protection.

lacrosse,31y9yy,Shepherdsfavestore,1 point,Thu Apr 9 05:53:22 2015 UTC,I got gloves with a non bendable thumb and I love them. After a few practices I realized I didn't use my thumbs too often
lacrosse,31y9yy,ZVLee,1 point,Fri Apr 10 18:00:15 2015 UTC,"i've broken my thumb twice, and my metacarpal once, i like the warrior regulator thumbs- i feel pretty safe with those.  STX thumb guards are just hard plastic, makes the glove really stiff. Brine has a more segmented thumb, but it's not very protective. the most dangerous part about getting hit in the thumb/hand is the ball pinching your finger against the shaft."

Just got a pair of custom Regulator II's (peep them on my profile) and they work just fine, with a little less flexibility. However, if your don't want the hard plastic, Mac Daddy's have the best non plastic thumb protection in my opinion."
lacrosse,31y9yy,Cavs032,1 point,Thu Apr 9 03:31:40 2015 UTC,I like the old minimalistic style. I like being able to move around and feel the stick. I am willing to accept the lost thumbnails that rarely occur. However the trend is leaning towards thick thumbs because companies that make goalie gloves are worried about lawsuits if someone gets a broken thumb while wearing their specially designed gloves. So they will continue to beef them up. Because of this I have to buy regular gloves to retain the mobility that I want.

lacrosse,31vxbk,theanuranking,4,Wed Apr 8 16:03:02 2015 UTC,"Here's a scenario that happens a lot and from my reading of the rules sounds like it should be interference, but I have never seen called and wanted to hear your thoughts.  Attackman (A) has possession and is driving towards the goal.  While in the act of shooting, A's crosse makes contact with the goalie's crosse and body within the cylinder of the crease."
lacrosse,31vxbk,smilli02,5,Wed Apr 8 17:52:49 2015 UTC,"Yes.  That should be goaltender interference.  It should be called, and often times will not be called.  Keep in mind that it the ball enters the net before the contact is made, it's a good goal.  Unlike the crease violation where the goal would get called back.  I will say that there are occasions where the attackman is pushed and that push cause the contact."
lacrosse,31vxbk,ryewheats,3,Wed Apr 8 17:57:57 2015 UTC,Are there any specific rules about hitting goalies in the elbow as long as it isn't a slash?
lacrosse,31vxbk,jewunit,4,Wed Apr 8 16:50:45 2015 UTC,"So slashes are kinda weird.  I'll go over them in more detail in the coming weeks.  The language of Rule 5.7.1 is super vague.   Swinging a crosse at an opponent's crosse or body with deliberate viciousness or reckless abandon, regardless of whether the opponent's crosse or body is struck.   So there is nothing that says you are allowed to swing a stick at anyone's elbow.  When checking a crosse, there are some language that gives us an idea of the official line.  Rule 5.7.3   Striking an opponent in any part of the body with the crosse (including its end cap), except when done by a player in the act of passing, shooting or attempting to scoop the ball. In all situations, the player's gloved hand shall be considered part of the crosse, except when in contact with a line marking.   So technically, striking ANYONE in the elbow could be a slash.  There is no language designating the keeper with special protection there.  Officials are more likely to call a slash in those situations though.  If the check is uncontrolled and makes contact with the elbow, you are risking getting a slash, regardless of the player you are slashing."
lacrosse,31vxbk,jewunit,3,Wed Apr 8 17:23:40 2015 UTC,"You talk about it briefly in the slashing bit, but not the other way around (when it would or wouldn't be interference) on the follow through. We've all done it, extend our follow through a little bit to make contact with a stationary attackman who otherwise would not have interfered at all to try and get the interference call from a ref.  Is this always interference (they are making contact with the goalie), never interference (they aren't actually checking the goalie as per the wording of the rule), up to the ref, or what?"
lacrosse,31vxbk,henerydods,3,Wed Apr 8 18:31:22 2015 UTC,"Contacting the keeper is interference, whether is is a ""check"" or not is irrelevant.  If a keeper is clearing the ball and his follow-through makes contact with an attackman one of three things happens.  1) Play-on, a failed clear, whistle, goalie interference, free clear.  2) Play-on, successful clear  3) Flag down, whistle (when approproate), slashing call on the keeper.  It all depends on if the follow-through was natural or not.  Edit: Essentially, it's either slashing or falls into Situation 3 in the OP"
lacrosse,31vxbk,mrepik9000,2,Wed Apr 8 18:39:41 2015 UTC,"Perhaps one of three things should happen, but often times the fourth option is a no-call and that happens quite a bit.  Edit: For this right here. There isn't contact on the clear, but just for hypothetical sake, say on the follow through he makes contact with the stick. Not an excessively violent follow through, could arguably be natural, but we all know it isn't. Interference or a slash? Both seem a bit silly."
lacrosse,31vxbk,MrWermHatsWormHat,3,Wed Apr 8 18:45:36 2015 UTC,"I completely understand the situation you're describing.  It is the attackman's job to give the keeper room to clear. If he is standing in front of the crease trying to prevent a clean clear, then he can't be mad if he gets a interference call when the follow-through hits him.  The follow through doesn;t have to be excessive or violent, just unnatural.  If it is clear the keeper is TRYING to get the call, he won't get it.  You're right, it doesn't always get called.  But that could be said about nearly any violation or penalty.  In a lot of these discussion we have to work in an ideal world so we understand the language and what the rulebook outlines.  Applying the rules is a whole other battle.  It takes officials a long time to fully grasp and gain the skills to recognize and implement the rulebook fully."
lacrosse,31vxbk,jacobsp0213,3,Wed Apr 8 18:56:24 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I've been switching around from international field rules, to Canadian box rules, to international indoor rules so much lately that these different interpretations of crease rules get really confusing, haha.   What are the punishments here? Just change of possesisons? I think you said something about a free clear (I have never heard of a free clear before, what does that mean)? Any cases with a man down penalty (besides the slashing one)?  So a situation clarification for your NFHS rules (and I'm assuming would be the same for NCAA?):   Situation 1: Attack player from team A reaches into team B's crease to pick up a loose ball and clamps the ball down to pull it out or gain control of it in a scrum. Goalie from team B clamps on top of team A's stick in the crease over the ball. Goalie interference? Goalie gets possession automatically?  Situation 2: Attack player A is standing a step outside of the crease (a good three feet or so), stick straight up in the air trying to get a stick on the ball that the goalie B is clearing. Goalie B pushes the limits of being in the crease, but is still in the crease (let's say back foot is on the line still, and front foot takes a big step out so he gets closer to attackman A, maybe to try and get the interference call). He throws the ball and makes contact with player A in his follow through after the ball is released from his stick. Ball is still considered in team B's possession and theoretically that should be an interference? Would any ref in your leagues actually call that? Or is the ball considered outside the crease at that point and therefore making contact with the goalies stick (which is outside of the crease) a legal thing?  Man this crease thing is so confusing when having to jump from rule set to rule set. CLA box, I can't even reach in the crease for any reason to pick up a loose ball, there is a cylinder of no entry there, International ball that's free game. Box the goalie can follow through and touch me as long as I don't interfere with the actual throwing motion, international field I can't even remember. International field I can stick check a goalies stick if he is reaching out to pick up a loose ball, box I can't touch him. As a Canadian, this stuff can get pretty loopy. I'll just stick to CLA box rules so I can be on the safe side, even if that means I miss a play or two. Haha."
lacrosse,31vxbk,ZVLee,3,Wed Apr 8 20:21:24 2015 UTC,"Ok, so let's start out with the easy.  The NCAA and NFHS rules in this case are pretty much identical, with some slight language differences, but nothing that would drastically change our interpretation.  Now onto your situations.  Situation 1: Yes, that is goalie interference.  You can reach into the crease, but you cannot contact the keeper if he is in the crease.  This extends to his crosse if is within the cylinder of the crease as well.  It does not matter who initiated the contact, merely the occurrence of contact is enough. Ruling: Play-on. Whistle. Goalie Interference on the attackman.  Keeper gets possession and immediately restarts from his crease.  Situation 2: That is part of the natural follow-through.  So it would be considered contact to the keeper with possession in the crease.  As you said, even if it's the last centimeter of his heel on the line, he is technically still in his crease.  Exception would be if the follow through was unnatural, excessive, or violent, in which case it would be a slash. Let's assume in your situation it wasn't and that it caused the pass to not be completed.  This is probably the interference I call most, happens once every other game or so. Ruling: Play-on. Whistle. Goalie interference on attackman.  Team B gets possession at the faceoff dot (free clear).  Keep in mind with both of these, there is a play-on.  That means if Team A gets possession immediately in Situation 1, the play-on is turned off and play continues without interruption.  Similarly, in Situation 2, if the clearing pass is completed, the play-on is turned off and play is allowed to continue as if nothing happened.  As an outside observer, I kinda agree with your last sentiment.  The chances of you actually making a ridiculous play are a lot lower than screwing up and getting an interference call.  A free clear can mean a ton in a closely-fought game, especially if you are a good riding team.  Just leave the keeper alone once the ball is in the crease, unless it is just sitting there.  I've seen people try and time the clamp-and-scoop to get their crosse in there and knock the ball free without contacting the keeper....it never works."
lacrosse,31vxbk,ZVLee,3,Wed Apr 8 20:39:45 2015 UTC,"When the goalie himself is still in the crease, and the ball goes down right by the crease, the goalie is going to clamp, right? Is it legal for an attackman to check the goalies stick while it is out of the crease, or is it considered part of the body of the goalie?"
lacrosse,31vxbk,jewunit,1 point,Thu Apr 9 01:42:10 2015 UTC,"A clamp is not possession.  Therefore the situation you described falls under Situation 5 in the OP as long as the ball is outside the crease.  You can check his crosse (don't kick it, that's an illegal procedure) and try to lift his clamp.  You cannot touch his body if ANY part of it is in the crease.  As soon as the ball is inside the crease though, you have to stop.  Some youth leagues have a provision in their rulebook that a clamp is possession, but that is not written into the NFHS or NCAA rulebook and I don't expect that to change anytime soon."

I took a couple faceoffs here and there, but was never a specialist.

lacrosse,31tag9,willpc14,3,Wed Apr 8 01:17:30 2015 UTC,"I was a center mid andI haven't played since middle school, 21 now just getting back into it. I have about 2 years left before I can go to college (military). I have a stick, some lax balls and a goal. What should be the most important thing I focus on if I want to be competitive at the college level?"
lacrosse,31tag9,willpc14,3,Mon Apr 27 05:05:19 2015 UTC,"First off, thank you for your service. The most basic thing I would say would be physical fitness (which I'm sure won't be a problem if you are serving in the military!)...everybody has to run in lacrosse, so being in shape is a common denominator. Next, I would say play as much wall ball as you can, lefty, righty, behind the back, anything can help with your stick skills for when you return. Just being in shape and having a good stick will go a long way, I am sure when you get back to playing a lot will come back easily, it is like riding a bike!   Another thing you can do is watch film. Not just games in general, but specific players. Find players you want to emulate, and study them, watch as much film of theirs as you can, see where they move off ball and move around. The more you study players, the more you can incorporate their game into yours. When I first started playing, my mom bought me a vhs highlight tape of mark millon, and i would watch it in my basement, then go out and replicate the moves for literally hours and hours"

lacrosse,31tag9,Meow_Meow_Fuzz_Butt,2,Thu Apr 9 18:49:46 2015 UTC,Hi there. I know you did your AMA a long time ago but I was wondering if you could answer a few questions for me. First of all what are the most important things to do off the field to hone my skills? And then also what are the most important things to do to get to the next level. Right now I'm only a freshman but my goal when I graduate is to go D1. Thanks In advance
lacrosse,31tag9,Meow_Meow_Fuzz_Butt,2,Thu Apr 9 19:31:26 2015 UTC,"Off the field. Keep up your grades so that no coach has to torn you down because of academics. Also get on a steady weight room routine, that has both lifting components and running involved. On the field it's all about footwork. If you have good footwork over good checks, coaches will see you as more valuable. Most important is to keep it simple on ball, and talk alot off ball."

lacrosse,31tag9,loomis_lax,2,Thu Apr 9 23:33:51 2015 UTC,"the wings are huge for communication...we have specific and unique calls to let me know where I can exit, or where i can give it to them and how far i need to get it out. However, for the most part one guy is able to get the ball out before the wings get in on you, which is about two seconds at the D1 level."

lacrosse,31tag9,Pancakeninja100100,3,Wed Apr 8 00:28:42 2015 UTC,"-yes I pretty much only fogo  -I think if i dedicated time to it i could be a not-terrible d-middie, offense has never been my favorite haha  -I remember being the faceoff guy for my team when i was between ages 5-7, then i pretty much played every position! Anywhere i could get playing time!   in the fall and summer i try to lift about 5 days a week, in season i try to get in 3 good lifts a week, you can really tell the difference facing off with an extra couple pounds on you"
lacrosse,31tag9,hey_sasha_grey,2,Wed Apr 8 00:38:11 2015 UTC,Do you coach? If so where are you located?
lacrosse,31uvtz,gio269,6,Wed Apr 8 10:06:22 2015 UTC,"Communication. Identify the Slide. Stay into the offenses' hip. Stick up, especially in passing lanes. Watch for cutters to the crease. Don't undervalue the stick check. If you've got someone shooting on you, the easiest thing you can do is lift one of his elbows."
lacrosse,31uvtz,Kylekub,3,Wed Apr 8 11:35:50 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat when I started. Best advise I can give you is to work on your stick skills, your checks, and your team defense. Become a lacrosse player. Don't just be that football guy that's in the field to hit people."
lacrosse,31uvtz,flowgod,2,Wed Apr 8 13:38:09 2015 UTC,Definitely get your stick skills up and watch a lot of lacrosse and understand the concepts. I was in the same position. I've been playing football since like 4th grade and then my freshman year of high school the lacrosse coach got me to play. I understood how to play and everything but my stick skills definitely held me back. I've been playing varsity since freshman year and my stick  skills got exponentially better with practice
lacrosse,31uvtz,Hornetslax6,2,Wed Apr 8 14:12:47 2015 UTC,"On top of what the previous guys have said (they are giving you some great advice), I'd recommend watching some games on tv or YouTube etc. It helps you see how plays work and can help you think about where you should be what you should be doing. It's what I did when I was away from the game during my summer holiday and I came back with a better understanding of what's going on etc."
lacrosse,31uvtz,kawuni,2,Wed Apr 8 14:34:00 2015 UTC,"Get to as many next level games as you can, local colleges or even if there are any D1 programs in your area. Go to those games and watch everything from warm ups to the end of the game. Take notes on the things you would like to do. What you will see and what has been said is stick skills. Get working on those and your game will increase very fast."
lacrosse,31uvtz,Yellowyeti09,1 point,Wed Apr 8 14:55:50 2015 UTC,"This is where I was when I first started. The main things I would tell you is to work on your footwork and work on playing good position defense without your pole. Also another key aspect is being able to communicate with your middies, goalie and other poles while playing defense. Communication is key and will make all of you better"
lacrosse,31uvtz,concussed_cowboy,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:12:25 2015 UTC,Check out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uDxcG8BXZ8  Watch that video several times. Each time pay attention to a different defensive player. Watch what they do when they are playing the ball. Watch how the 'hot' guy slides and how the backside fills in. Watch how they stand and what they are paying attention to when the ball is on the other side of the field.   There is such a wealth of knowledge on youtube nowadays. Don't just watch the highlight reels as there is rarely any 'good' defense on those.   credit to /u/nthitz for posting that video a couple days ago on here.

lacrosse,31t1to,Youngwhippersnapper6,8,Tue Apr 7 23:03:30 2015 UTC,"If your friend knows what he's doing, that's the best short term solution.  In this case, 'knows what he is doing' = he has strung other heads on your team and people are happy with the results.  Longer term, you should learn to do it yourself.  It's not that hard will help your game.  You can learn a lot by watching East Coast Dyes, String King and Throne of Mesh videos.  ECD even has a ""database"" of patterns/tutorials.  Watch them, grab an old beater and string a few different variations to learn what you really like.  As for the store, it depends on which store you're talking about.  If it is a local lacrosse store run by people who play then you can get a good head from them.  I have seen some abominations come out of Dick's and Play It Again though and would steer clear.  No matter who strings it, be prepared to answer the following questions:  - Position (easy)  - Play style; feeder, outside shooter, crease attack, pole (less easy)  - Where do you want your pocket?  High, mid, low, a combo of two of those. If you don't know why this is important, watch the East Coast Dyes ""Theory"" videos.  Good luck!  I love stringing and am happy to answer any specific questions."
lacrosse,31t1to,teebery,1 point,Tue Apr 7 23:20:54 2015 UTC,Alright for now ill probably have a friend do it since everyone I talk to says he's good. And I'll  buy a used head and practice stringing until I get it good. Thanks for the reply
lacrosse,31t1to,msupz,1 point,Tue Apr 7 23:47:54 2015 UTC,"To add to this about questions. Give us as stringers AS MUCH information as possible. If possible have a toss with the people stringing your stick so they see your throwing motions etc. It helps a lot and is also a teaching moment. We can string a stick that throws perfect for us, but for you may throw into the ground or you sail.  Too many times people will come in and give us too little information and then they get angry at us for giving them a stick they don't like, but usually it's an easy fix.  Be very specific to get the perfect stringing."
lacrosse,31t1to,Shroomulated,1 point,Wed Apr 8 01:10:15 2015 UTC,"Stores, at least in my area (Central NJ) usually put out pretty consistent string jobs. If they are willing to do it for anything under 20 bucks I'd say do it. That being said, if you are not willing to pay them that much, or if you know that your store might not be able to produce high quality string jobs, give it to a friend. I would not suggest trying to string your own, unless you have a backup head or are willing to put in the time and effort required to learn and practice stringing, as it can be quite frustrating and and might not produce the results you are looking for. Up to you man, just my two cents."
lacrosse,31t1to,ndbroski,1 point,Tue Apr 7 23:11:52 2015 UTC,"If you string your head yourself your first job will inevitably be poor.  However, it is a useful skill to learn, will save you money, and later, might earn some money yourself."
lacrosse,31t1to,KyleBrofloski,1 point,Tue Apr 7 23:13:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, lacrosse stringing is about experience and skill. You need to strike a balance. So try all of these options as you grow as a player that way you find what you like in a string job. Also always keep trying to learn yourself. Buy a $15 head off a discount site. Doesn't matter if it's a POS just string it and restring it over and over until you learn what you are doing."
lacrosse,31t1to,teebery,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:13:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply but one more question. If I buy a new mesh should I buy new shooters and stuff too, or use my old ones?"
lacrosse,31t1to,msupz,2,Wed Apr 8 00:21:12 2015 UTC,"Yes.  You don't want to cannibalize your gamer to practice.    The Play It Again near (Atlanta) me breaks up Sting King kits and sells individual shooters, sidewalls, and top strings for a buck each.  I don't know if that's a nationwide policy or just mine but it's worth looking into."
lacrosse,31t1to,K_Swaggy,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:31:34 2015 UTC,That's so odd if they're breaking up premade kits to sell individually. The string king packs are 30 bucks so if you break it up for a dollar a piece you're pretty much getting the same strings for the same price.
lacrosse,31t1to,getmetothelake,1 point,Wed Apr 8 01:13:01 2015 UTC,"You should learn to do yourself but if your friend does a nice job have him do it and try copying that. Unless your going to go to a Comlax or something like that I wouldn't have a store do it, actually I really would have any store do it."
lacrosse,31t1to,henerydods,1 point,Wed Apr 8 01:05:18 2015 UTC,"The key to learning is by copying other sticks with the same heads if they have a good string job. Its also important to make sure you use the same mesh as they did, otherwise the job wont turn out the same. Take time to mimic what other people can do, ask questions, and eventually you will figure it out."

lacrosse,31t0d2,Wyvern_king,3,Tue Apr 7 22:52:27 2015 UTC,You haven't given enough info for us to make a suggestion.  Is there something about this head that is giving you problems?  Have you borrowed a friend's stick and loved it?  Have you tried a different pocket?  What level / rules are you playing? Do you hate the look?  Regarding whether or not a head makes a difference . . . if your game is dialed in then finding a head which matches your play style can help.  If you have holes a new head isn't a panacea.  It's the wizard not the wand
lacrosse,31t0d2,teebery,2,Tue Apr 7 23:28:55 2015 UTC,Really sorry about the lack of information. I'm a midfielder on a varsity high school lacrosse team and I'll most likely be playing on a club team at a D3 school next year. I haven't tried a lot of other people's sticks so I don't have much a reference for that.   It's not that I'm having a problem with my current head I was just curious if a different head would just be all around better. I see all these suggestions for super powers and lakotas to middies looking for a head so I was just curious if getting something like that would help me out at all.
lacrosse,31t0d2,teebery,2,Tue Apr 7 23:50:02 2015 UTC,"Ok.  Lakotas are great and I love my Super Power (which I got at Play It Again for $35).  Used, unstrung heads at PIAS are a hidden gem, at least in the south.  I know this isn't the answer you're looking for but the only way to figure out what you like is to try other heads.  Ask your friends to borrow theirs for a practice or two and see what you like.  With that said, if you're facing off then heads make a huge difference.  Unfortunately I am not a face off guy so I can't help there."

You need a quick mental vacation, example go home after practice or game tonight and do something else. once you do that then go buy some confidence!! Pretty much what the last post said, get a new haircut, shoes, go buy something that makes you feel good again. Now the next step.. Get to practice and do all of the little things great. Every pass, sprint, ground ball all of the little things you can control do them well again. Your confidence will start to grow just with all of the little things your doing well. Good luck and I hope it turns around the high school season goes by way to fast."
lacrosse,31pslr,Yellowyeti09,1 point,Tue Apr 7 17:50:44 2015 UTC,"As everyone else has said, lacrosse is a very mental game. Unfortunately it's not just the confidence, but being relaxed. Mainely mesh has a great video on tuning your shot where they talk about tension in your grip and wrists. When players aren't playing well they tend to tense up and then tend to force things. This tightness screws with so much when it comes to stick skills. Go watch a Mark Matthews, John Grant Jr, or Lyle Thompson play and tell me they don't look like the coolest and most relaxed mother fuckers out there.  Being able to play relaxed and how you want to is very important, and not getting frustrated when it isn't going your way is equally important.   I played on a highschool team in a different sport and our modo was ""bend, don't break"" meaning we had to take the highs with the lows, but always adapt and never let the lows consume us. Lacrosse comes with many lows, and is very very momentum based. You need to be able to find your way out of those lows, or you will end up like Minnesota in Rochester last weekend."
lacrosse,31pslr,henerydods,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:22:47 2015 UTC,Not OP but thanks for linking that video! I'm having a lot of trouble really placing my shots and that video really explained how to direct where you shoot.
lacrosse,31pslr,Wyvern_king,2,Wed Apr 8 17:54:17 2015 UTC,"You have to get shooting reps in too, not just passing on the wall. I recently discovered a batting cage close to my house that is almost always empty and it's the best place to rip shots I've ever been. No chasing after balls no matter how badly I miss. I set up paper plates on the back fence/mesh for targets (for me it's about box net corners, but for you maybe you want to space 4 of em out about where the corners of a field net are, 6'x6'), I don't bring an actual net in to the cage yet.   Don't over throw your accuracy level. Start at a shot speed that you can control, then slowly start bringing that shot speed up. It's like squatting or any other skill, you don't start squatting 400lbs, you might start at 150lbs, and over time and practice you get that up to 300lbs, then you start getting really good and bring it up to 400lbs. In lacrosse a well placed shot beats a hard and uncontrolled shot 100% of the time, so keep that in mind. A hard and well placed shot will be hard to beat though, so slowly work on pushing the limits on how hard you can accurately shoot. Slowly work up to it in practice too, start slow and end hard. And if you're in a cage like I do, I always end with shooting as absolutely hard as I can, just for fun. You still have to have fun in this sport, haha."
lacrosse,31pslr,henerydods,2,Wed Apr 8 19:11:56 2015 UTC,Thanks for the great advice man. I normally practice shooting in my friends backyard because he has a goal and really nice backstop setup. I've always been able to get an accurate shot on the cage with power behind it but it was mostly just winging it and going for a general side of the cage. I've noticed that I can shoot far more accurately underhand because I'm really focusing on placement and not trying to put a ridiculous amount of power behind the ball. I'll start doing that with overhand shooting and working my way up to a hard but accurate shot.

lacrosse,31phcr,dryst04,8,Tue Apr 7 03:20:06 2015 UTC,"By spelling lacrosse correctly...haha sorry just kidding In my experience coaches always tell me to pay attention off ball when watching games and footage. Be sure to focus on what the attackmen are doing off ball if you play attack etc... Also pay attention to what defenders (if you're an offensive player) are doom fame vice versa. You can learn a lot from watching how your opposition does their job. Lacrosse IQ also just comes with practice. You can't just step on the field and instantly have a high lax IQ. The more you play, the more you learn. Hope this helps!"

lacrosse,31phcr,BaconBob,3,Tue Apr 7 05:09:40 2015 UTC,Watching game film is good.  Breaking down game film is better.  Pick the guy who's playing your position and break down everything he does with and without the ball.
lacrosse,31phcr,smilli02,2,Tue Apr 7 12:38:05 2015 UTC,"Watching games on TV or youtube can help, but are not a replacement for watching live lacrosse.  Lacrosse on TV always follows the ball and for entertainment that works best, but if you want to learn the game you need to pick one (smart) player and watch what he does on ball, off ball, in transition, etc.  It always helps to have someone knowledgeable go to the games with you so that you can talk through what is going on.  When I coached a middle school team we would watch high school games and I'd have them call out what formations the offense was running, zone vs. man defense, etc."

lacrosse,31mxhb,NewYorkerinGeorgia,3,Mon Apr 6 16:18:50 2015 UTC,"In my experience, footwork drills are kinda boring by nature. You're running around cones, you're following the coaches stick, it's dull compared to hitting annoying attack dudes with a metal pole.

I'd get to know a lot of them and change them up frequently."

lacrosse,31mxhb,Camoman37,3,Tue Apr 7 00:49:07 2015 UTC,"Defensive player and coach here, hoping I can offer some of my experiences to help.What everyone else has said is incredibly useful and true. To sum up the aforementioned points...  1- Footwork - Drills are boring but if your defense can grapevine/karaoke, shuffle, and jog backwards as easily (and as quickly if you're lucky) as they can run, they'll be golden.  2- Communication - Everything including calling ground balls, who's on the left or right of the point defender, calling for iso's or shots, calling for slides. If the defense cannot communicate and work as a team they will not reach their potential for efficiency and effectiveness.  3- Slides - This is the most basic part to a defense. You will have players get beat by a dodge or just outran; that's fine. Be sure you can have your other players pick up on when someone needs help and have them move to it (basically another emphasis on communication).  While I rarely use a zone when I play (and coach for that matter) it is important that they understand how it works in case they need to use it in the future. Try putting them into a 3-3 zone with some defensive middies.Put them in their starting position, tell them to take 3 steps one way and walk in a circle around the starting position; this will show them where their zone and defensible space is. The idea is that there should be little to no space where someone isn't covering. Next, have your offense run and pass around the horn, make a few cuts, and really get the defense moving so that way they can see how they should adjust as the ball is rotating. No one should exceed their zone, but the concept of having them make those movements that follow the ball allows them to see where each other should be and when. When I started playing, I learned how to do a zone; having that kind of cooperative defense really encourages communication and awareness of the field, which makes it a whole lot easier to play man defense later on.  One more key point to tell your defense is to play body rather than sticks. If a defender just tries stick checks, a smart offensive player will simply drag him around the field till he over-commits and makes a false swipe. Poke checks are the best thing in the world for a pole to learn and master, other than footwork. Have your poles aim for the bottom hand of a middie and I guarantee that one or two of those pokes will hit his gut. This has potential for a GB, but the best part about it is the psychological effect it has on a player; it shows aggression and ultimately can deter the offense from getting in close. Always be sure that your defense states their presence within and maintains it with authority.  Sorry for the rant, hope this helps!"
lacrosse,31mxhb,sydtron,3,Mon Apr 6 17:12:35 2015 UTC,"Poke checks are the best thing in the world for a pole to learn and master,    I'm a fundamentally terrible defender because I play out of my beloved crease once in a blue moon but I can miracle myself to being mediocre at Dpole thanks to quality poke checks. You get the chance to dictate where you want the play to go without making any commitment with your position."
lacrosse,31mxhb,PerkisSystem41,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:50:12 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing in defense is communication. Make sure everybody echoes each call at least three times; a ton of breakdowns can be attributed to simply losing a man in the chaos or not having the slides ordered and organized. Which brings me to my next point, slides! 6v6 is the hardest part of lacrosse, for both sides, but obviously the offense has the upper hand. One thing I would teach them is that it is ok to get beat, that's part of the game and it happens to everybody, but you can at least dictate where they beat you, ie forcing them to one side, so everybody on the defense knows where the 1 and 2 slides are coming from. Lastly, and this depends on what kind of defensive culture you are trying to create, I would have them be opportunistic, and learn when it's ok to double and when it's better to hang back, you can cause a lot of turnovers through unscripted double teams, but it's a double edged sword."
lacrosse,31mxhb,NewYorkerinGeorgia,1 point,Mon Apr 6 16:31:01 2015 UTC,"If you want to change it up, try using your man down D with a free defender. This gives your defenders the license to really be aggressive because the free defender is there to slide when the defender gets beat. Which he will, but sometimes he will also take the ball away. We used an outside rotation on man down in HS, so when we ran this D full strength it was an outside rotation with a backup defender. Tons of fun as a defender, and unless an offensive team can hit the open back side man well or knows how to cut against that D, it's tough to score against."
lacrosse,31mxhb,jodyhighroller69,1 point,Mon Apr 6 16:47:12 2015 UTC,you didn't do a box +1 on man down? Mid field defender would string the crease and top mid? Sounds interesting I would love to see this in action
lacrosse,31mxhb,NewYorkerinGeorgia,1 point,Mon Apr 6 16:59:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know what he does, but box and one does use an outside rotation. For example if the right attackman brings the ball up and the x attackman sneaks up to the crease, then the box would rotate around to cover the x guy.   On second thought that's without a string  my bad haha"
lacrosse,31mxhb,thelaxative,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:59:08 2015 UTC,"We called it an outside rotation. What that means is that the defense is rotating in the opposite direction of the ball. So if the offense is spinning the ball clockwise, then the next time it comes around I would end up guarding the ball carrier one position over in the counter clockwise direction. Against a 1-3-2 offense you have a defender on ball, a defender on each attacker adjacent to the ball carrier, and the backside defender is always splitting two attackers. Which is why a team that can thread the needle with their passing can rip it up. But if they can't, they get shut down. Cutters can be rough because they mess up assignments, but if a team isn't cutting, and can't make skip passes, they usually get shut down hard."

Groundballs drills are important so if you can incorporate that into your exercises you should be fine."
lacrosse,31j3nc,ITzzIKEI,2,Sun Apr 5 16:49:02 2015 UTC,"Id also like to mention that you should probably watch a video on how to properly do a wall ball session. As a coach, one of the big things I noticed is that a lot of kids waste their time with wall ball because they aren't actually throwing the ball hard enough so it comes back to them without bouncing. This makes you actually work on proper form so the ball comes back into the ""box"" which is where you want your passes to be.  edit: Here's one https://youtu.be/828UrMqW72k"

lacrosse,31jona,lacrosseplayer1,1 point,Sun Apr 5 19:30:02 2015 UTC,I like the super power as a more attack oriented head. However I think the Lakota has more stringing options since it has more sidewall holes. I like the shape of both heads too so either way you get an awesome head

lacrosse,31gh8y,Shepherdsfavestore,8,Sat Apr 4 22:48:22 2015 UTC,"There are other forces at play there. Some of the anchors love hockey, you can tell when they do commentary on highlights. Problem is, ESPN for some reason didn't get a contract with the NHL, so they can't air games"
lacrosse,31gh8y,ClearSearchHistory,4,Sat Apr 4 23:11:31 2015 UTC,"Because they refuse to pay to cover it. You pay for the rights to air, and ESPN doesn't believe the hockey fan base has been there. They're creeping back in though. Covering the college hockey tournament the last few years, and will be covering the entire 2016 World Cup of Hockey. I assume it won't be long before they're buying the rights for a few night slots of hockey again here and there."
lacrosse,31gh8y,mountainmafia,2,Sun Apr 5 00:46:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. He said ESPN doesn't give a fuck about hockey, which just isn't true at all. Hockey definetly doesn't draw the ratings that the NFL drags in, but it's definetly growing. The NHL asked for an outrageous number, iirc, and it wouldn't have made sense for them."
lacrosse,31gh8y,ClearSearchHistory,1 point,Sun Apr 5 00:51:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and the one thing that is holding the importance of college lacrosse back compared to other things is the legitimacy of professional lacrosse. It's all about the pipeline of interest. It's easier to put basketball on your channels cause you know that interest flows into your NBA assets. Not saying it's deserving to keep such a good lacrosse game off the air (although I'm sure it's on a obscure ESPN U channel or something) but the reasoning is all there in a business matter."

lacrosse,31gh8y,DubstepDonkey,7,Tue Apr 7 06:56:57 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about this some lately, and here's what I've been thinking:  For decades lacrosse was a Northeastern game. Nobody anywhere else had even heard of it. ESPN was started in the Northeast, so they knew about it. ESPN goes national and they put the Final Four on every year nationally. Broadcast it all over the country when most of the country had never heard of it.   Want it know what got me hooked? Yep: an ESPN broadcast.   Granted, I saw it in grade school, unlike most people, but still: I think ESPN probably did more to grow the sport than they will ever get credit for."
lacrosse,31gh8y,NewYorkerinGeorgia,3,Sat Apr 4 22:11:00 2015 UTC,I can't think that ratings for that baseball game would be higher than Duke/ND lacrosse but there might be some contractual obligations on ESPN to air the baseball game first.

And I agree 110% that it should be televised and if they spent more time on it they could help build the sports. But it's the exact same reason why they don't give the NHL any love. Over all it's just not as popular as a lot of things they could be airing. They would not get the ratings they need as station. Yes they are about broadcasting sports, but at the end of the day they are a business.  It's unfortunate and I hate it, but that's just the way it is"

I yell their name and ""screen!"" and then they start to push them out of the way a little. I don't think it is technically legal but if they drive at the attack's hip they can move them without the officials noticing."
lacrosse,31g8rg,Cavs032,2,Sat Apr 4 20:15:47 2015 UTC,"I just move my head, I try to avoid moving my feet around cause then I'm out of position.

lacrosse,31g8rg,Scuba98,1 point,Sat Apr 4 20:17:33 2015 UTC,"Do what you have to to see the ball, if that means moving a little, then move. Don't worry about being out of position, if you aren't fast enough to react to a shot the person screening you isn't fast enough either.   Also, like others have mentioned, communicate screens with your D. If they are crowding the crease have your D use their hips to bump them into the crease, it may draw a call from the refs."
lacrosse,31g8rg,Sun-Ghoti,0,Sat Apr 4 21:30:01 2015 UTC,"1) Definitely work with your defense first and foremost.  If they can't clear the screen and time is short, most shooters go low off a screen to avoid hitting their teammates.  Shade low with your stick and move your head to either side to get the best view possible.  Be ready to smother a low one.   2) my personal favorite...if the screener was tight to the crease and/or my defense was having trouble clearing it out....(I'm not saying you should do the following.  I'm just saying this is what I did and it worked for me. I never got called for a penalty from high school through DI college ball and high level club ball after college. I got warned once.  YMMV)   If a screener is setting up camp in front of you step up a little closer to look over the top or around the side of the screen.  While you're doing that, give the screener a poke check in the back of the knee. No big elaborate slash or hack. Just a vigorous poke. Once the play starts up refs are going to be focused on everything but you as long as you avoid drawing their attention. In all likelihood one good poke and that offensive player will find a better place to stand.  Repeat as necessary.  I think i only saw 1-2 guys ever stick around for more than 2-3 pokes.    Is it cheating?  I don't think so.  Is it illegal?  I imagine. Does it work?  Yes, sir."
lacrosse,31g8rg,BaconBob,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:18:30 2015 UTC,"As a coach I have to say don't do #2 as BaconBob suggests. A smart offensive player on the crease will go down like he is shot second or third time you do this and you will risk getting tossed from the game. Not to mention the obligitory X minute non-releasable penalty.   Also once the other team lets the referee know to look for it you are a dumb penalty waiting to happen. I like my lacrosse players the way I like my Marines, smart."
lacrosse,31fzfn,CumDumperAnal,10,Sat Apr 4 18:51:35 2015 UTC,The best zone breaking offense is a 1-4-1. You put your two best shooters on the crease and they set picks for each other and cut to the ball from inside.   Look up the Mumbo and Mumbo Pop plays on YouTube. Those are some of the best to use out of this set.
lacrosse,31fzfn,Submarine_Pirate,3,Sat Apr 4 19:12:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Pick, roll, rinse, & repeat.  You will get space!"
lacrosse,31fzfn,BristolBomber,3,Sat Apr 4 19:34:10 2015 UTC,"The roll is something I didn't mention, but is probably the most important part of this offense!   Defense is usually pretty quick to slide on a crease cut so if the pick man roles he is often wide open on the back door!"
lacrosse,31fzfn,Submarine_Pirate,2,Sat Apr 4 19:45:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with the 1-4-1 however, I would not put your 2 best shooters in the middle of a 1-4-1. Put your two scrappiest offensive players in the middle of a 1-4-1, your best shooters on a wing and your slow Canadian style (its assumed every team has at least one) attack at X.  If the inside guys work hard and are constantly picking and rolling for themselves (while looking for the ball) they will  1) disrupt the zone rotations 2) tire the defense out (and get a few quick crease goals) 3) get rebounds or junk goals if your outside shooters miss. If you successfully work the center you have all sorts of backdoor cuts and rips open up. The goal of the other 4 players on the outside is to attack the seams, work the areas that are between 2 defenders ""zones"". The X attack can push the crease and a simple back step pop from your crease or skip pass to your wing will open things up as well Don't run the mumbo or pop plays as everyone and their brothers knows it. It might work once but it is not a long term solution to beat the zone.  Another thing to consider is to not start in a 1-4-1 right out of the gate once the defense comes out in a zone. Rotate from a 2-3-1 (or other formation) to a 1-4-1 to confuse/scramble the defense up"
lacrosse,31fzfn,Gwalen5,1 point,Sun Apr 5 01:05:37 2015 UTC,Thanks for the help!
lacrosse,31fzfn,PhreshWater,5,Sun Apr 5 03:53:47 2015 UTC,Zones are all about just drawing players and abusing the seams. It also helps to have good shooters that can step up because the further away you are the easier it is to draw space
lacrosse,31fzfn,NewYorkerinGeorgia,4,Sat Apr 4 18:57:15 2015 UTC,The way to beat a zone is to create an overload. There are lots of ways to do it. A 1-4-1 can do it by overloading the defender at the center of the zone. An offense with no crease can do it by overloading on the edges. It's all about overloads.  Here's a great video about it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWLlZKJAUaI

lacrosse,31fylr,BroseidonSirF,1 point,Sat Apr 4 20:06:44 2015 UTC,"if you keep growing, i would lean towards midfield. 5 foot 8 is a pretty good size for a 7th grader, and i would say that athleticism and size will help you more at middie than attack- attack is mostly game sense (knowledge of positioning, mismatches, two-man plays)"

lacrosse,31ey5o,arkansaslax,1 point,Sat Apr 4 12:49:56 2015 UTC,Just a word of warning. At that price its still not a bad idea but if you're not looking to buy another head soon Id pass on the Reebok heads. I used to work in a lacrosse store and I can't tell you how many of the 6-9k Reebok heads I've seen shatter. If you don't abuse it much I'm sure it could be fine but its very stiff and not strong plastic so given any pressure it just explodes.
lacrosse,31ey5o,FlyingFake,3,Sat Apr 4 21:53:15 2015 UTC,Yes that has everything you need  Okay deal but the head is not very good
lacrosse,31ey5o,SouthernLaxProbs,2,Sat Apr 4 13:03:13 2015 UTC,"Actually it depends. I had the 6k for box and it was great! Terrible field head but perfect for box, especially the defensive end of the floor. Stiff as hell. Now the camo... That's another story."
lacrosse,31ey5o,laxd13,1 point,Sat Apr 4 13:15:59 2015 UTC,Yeah that's a good deal. Basically you're getting the head for about 15 bucks. I'd do it.
lacrosse,31ey5o,smilli02,1 point,Sat Apr 4 16:20:37 2015 UTC,"It has mesh, sidewall and shooting strings.  That's all you need.  About 15-20 years ago everyone would use a thicker string (usually a nylon shooter) or a leather strip  along the top, but now everyone just doubles up with sidewall."

One of the players still has tape on the back of his helmet with ""HOSS"" on it.  I don't think these guys will ever be broken apart.

lacrosse,31dhdv,SirNoName,3,Sat Apr 4 02:27:20 2015 UTC,This is correct. If the ball from the faceoff goes out of bounds and the refs cannot determine who was last to contact it it is the only instance in the rules for a re-face.

Rule 4.3.2   The faceoff is considered to have ended when the ball crosses the defensive-area line or it has gone out of bounds in the center-field area and the officials ­cannot determine who was responsible. If the officials cannot determine who was responsible for the ball going out of bounds, the ball shall be awarded by alternate possession if it has crossed the defensive area line or refaced if it went out of bounds in the center-field area.   There is no such thing as a ""stalemate""... eventually someone will win or someone will commit an infraction (usually holding)."

lacrosse,31dhdv,FlyingFake,2,Sat Apr 4 20:03:19 2015 UTC,They wait until something happens beacuse one person will usually get a clamp and then the other will do something illegal like clamp his stick so then there is posession

lacrosse,31dhdv,treehuggerguy,1 point,Sat Apr 4 16:33:43 2015 UTC,"I can't think of any situation where this would happen on a faceoff.  AP is used for things where the official cannot determine who is entitled to possession: Ball goes out of bounds but the official can't tell which team touched the ball last, there is an injury or equipment timeout where no team has possession.    If the ball goes out of bounds on a faceoff and the officials cannot determine who touched it last, the faceoff is done again."

Second comment is saying that he couldn't use the idea because he would need 25 rakes (the yard tool) because all his players would pick up ground balls by raking (poor lacrosse technique).

lacrosse,31cmqq,StrainerHats,2,Fri Apr 3 22:52:48 2015 UTC,"Either should be fine, but in the end it's all up to personal preference. The Optik is great for a mid pocket and so is the Super Power. If you play highschool or anything without NCAA rules I would recommend the Proton Power over the Super Power."
lacrosse,31cmqq,czscout,1 point,Sat Apr 4 01:16:23 2015 UTC,Super powers hold a mid pocket better than an optik. An optik will hold a high pocket really well and a full round box pocket well too. I have used both and prefer the STX because I use a mid pocket. Also it's a pretty easy head to string a mid pocket on. If you don't know how to do it there are a lot of tutorials on stx super power mid pockets because it's so popular.
lacrosse,31btqa,TH3xS1L3NT,5,Fri Apr 3 17:07:08 2015 UTC,"The ceo is a popular choice for the face-off middies on my team, but I can't speak from personal experience with it. The heads I do have experience with are the stx proton, the nike lakota, and the stx surgeon. I started with the lakota. It's fairly light and leaves a lot of options open for stringing. It as alright but didn't last me too long. For box, I use this proton. I love the pinch on the proton and overall face shape. It's easily my favorite head when it comes to being unique. I've herd complaints about its stringing holes, but with a good pattern it can do anything for you. Mines strung with 4 shooters, and has medium whip (moderately less than a typical 4 shooter setup). Lastly, for field I'm currently using the original surgeon. I love how many stringing holes there are. The scoop is fine, the pinch is incredible, and i've seen so many variations when it comes to stringing for hold/whip. It is no doubt the premier attack head for field. However, it can be both pricey and it is the heaviest head I've used. Given the price of the new surgeon's, I'd recommend a proton. Pretty light, good attack pinch/faceshape, and its flexible (leaving the option if you ever want to go back to middie/faceoff) at a decent price."

It made catching imperfect passes and grabbing GBs a dream come true. It's a stiffer head, which in my mind was what sold the deal. Lot's of good stringing options. Paired with an old STX Katana, I'd have to say it was the best money I've ever spent on gear before. To me, the head is absolutely 10/10."

lacrosse,31734c,peebsunz,26,Thu Apr 2 16:46:52 2015 UTC,"I have two stories from a single youth tournament this summer...  1) This is a U11 game.  U11 games in this tournament were for exhibition, so there was no medals or anything at stake here.  The player in question had been playing fairly reckless and delivered a pretty nasty body check.  I flagged him for an illegal body check at 2 minutes (cause it's U11).  After reporting, I turned to him to let him know why it was 2 minutes.  In youth games, I consider myself a teacher.  I am there to help the kids understand the sport and the rules.  As I went to explain to him he turned his head away and put up one hand making the ""talking"" motion with his hand, like it was a sock puppet.  I kicked him out.  2) Same tournament, I'm working the U15 championship game.  Tightly contested game, with the less talented team out-working the more talented squad to pull out a two goal win.  It was a physical game, but relatively clean.  After the final horn, I here yelling from the far side and see one of my partners trying to separate two players.  Losing player had gone after winning player, thrown his crosse at him, and started to try and rip his helmet off.  The official had to physically tackle the losing player to separate him.  That caused parents from the losing team to start yelling at the official, accusing him of assaulting their kid.  I'm high tailing it across the field to try and defuse the situation.  The losing player is ejected (duh) and starts yelling at my partner how he is aging out and it doesn't matter anymore.  My partner asks if he is planning on playing in high school (these were all local teams) and he said yes.  Well, we were both high school level officials as well, so we informed losing player that his suspension would follow into next spring.  I don't think he believed us, but his HS coach was informed and the kid is a JV benchwarmer (probably coulda made varsity as a freshman) this year. Not a smart decision."
lacrosse,31734c,theanuranking,9,Thu Apr 2 16:17:57 2015 UTC,Well done sir.
lacrosse,31734c,newswilson,5,Thu Apr 2 17:01:51 2015 UTC,"You're taking your approach to refing properly, well done. Yes, you should be a mentor out there just like the coaches. I would suggest you look at how to properly break up a fight though. Refs are taught that here in Canada because fighting is legal at certain levels of box lacrosse (note, not at the youth level). There is a tested method to breaking up fights that we stole from hockey. Basically looks like this.    Some key aspects of this. 1. Take off your whistle and put it in your pocket first. That is very important for the protection of your fingers and the players. 2. Notice how the demonstrator (guy in blue shirt) comes over the arm of the fighter, pushes his arms down and pulled the arms  together. This is the most important part as it prevents the guy from throwing punches, and puts the ref in control. The guy in the white shirt does it completely wrong and is putting both himself and the players at risk by trying to break it up by going underneath the red guy. Problem is that red guys arms are still free and can therefore still throw punches and try to grab things. You need to take control of the fighter by coming over top of the arms, and controlling them both in the same manner as the guy in the blue shirt did it. You will see 95% of fights end that way, even after they go to the ground the ref will jump in with the same principle.   Even though fighting isn't allowed down south there I still feel that this could be a valuable skill to learn as a ref to de-escalate a situation like yours."
lacrosse,31734c,henerydods,5,Thu Apr 2 19:00:18 2015 UTC,"Appreciate it, i take my position seriously.  I actually was not the official physically involved in the fight.  Trust me that fight mechanics are gone over every year here in the states, even though they are strictly illegal.  Mostly the same as what you've put here, with some differences:  1) We are not supposed to pocket our whistles.  Blow them repetitively and loudly, as you close in on the players.  Only pocket them when you engage.  Often times the shock of the sound that close to the ears will get them to stop for a moment so you can get in there physically.  Since these are players who aren't used to fighting, it's often like a dog fight where a loud noise will distract the players for you to get in between.  2) Breaking up a fight physically is nearly almost a two person task.  Mainly so one player isn't restrained.  The mistake my partner made was grabbing from behind, which is kinda a big no-no.  Since there was a clear instigator, he tried to neutralize it, but put himself in an awkward situation.  Fights are very rare, but they certainly happen.  We go over this stuff every off-season, but since you rarely get to put the mechanics into practice, we often are slower to react than we would like."

Truthfully, he's lucky that his only repercussion is ostracism from a group and not a broken face.... kudos to the other team for being with-it enough to report your idiot teammate and not taking it into their own hands.   And there's no ""at someone or not"" distinction with the word, man... your teammate was just being hateful - keep it simple and call it what it was.

We were winning by 1 goal in the 4th and went a man down.   The dad ignored me when I asked how much time was in the penalty, and when I got the refs attention who stopped the game and asked the dad 'how much longer on the penalty' the scorekeeper who was neutral said 'he was released 30 seconds ago'.   The dad flipped out and threatened to fight me (college kid vs white haired old dude) and got tossed by the refs and security. After the game (which we won by 2) he drove by the field, screamed out his window 'I HOPE YOU ALL DIE IN A CAR CRASH' and peeled out   Good ole Texas sportsmanship"

As long as my players' safety is not at risk I can coach through anything and not even remotely think of taking it up with the refs after the game.

He got hit in the nuts three times in that game."
lacrosse,31734c,Merking_Monster,9,Fri Apr 3 04:44:52 2015 UTC,"Similar thing happened against my team. Not quite sure how things work in America, but here in the UK a lot of universities have a first team and a second team, with the 1st squad being a lot better and in a higher league.   One team fielded a few first team players in their second team because they wanted to have more on the team (already had enough for full team plus subs) and wanted the advantage, and to try and get around getting caught out their captain sent a FB message to my captain but as they had no mutual friends it was sent to the 'other' box and not read. When their captain arrived she said that the message only said they were running late, but it said right at the bottom they were fielding some first team players ""as a test of their skills"" or some bullshit like that. They still lost the game. Because they lost they then complained to our Student Union's Sports Federation complaining saying that our supporters were heckling their goalkeeper (when the only fans we had were a few grandparents and housemates of various players, oh and the head of the Sports Federation committee was watching too so he knew they were lying), were not hospitable for them when they arrived (which was 20 minutes after the draw, and we showed them to the changing rooms - what else could we have done?), and at the end we were ""mocking them"" (we celebrated because we won an important game).   Another few smaller incidents such as a team criticising our referees whenever a call is made against them, but then praising them every time they penalise us and swearing at us or the refs because they didn't like that they got called out on something.  Funniest one was most recently and it was a substitute complaining about one of our defenders for being tall and fast because ""all she does really is stay by the goal and gets in the way"" well duh."

At 3:08 in this video our best attackman was scrumming for the ball on the crease and the goalie just started swinging at his head. Funny thing is that it was a two minute non-releasable penalty and the goalie still went back in after we scored 10 seconds later. Referees weren't that great that game but we still won 12-7.   This team is a Christian school and they had the worst sportsmanship of any team we played. After every game they would have a prayer in the middle of the field and invite the other team. When we beat them in the regular season, we weren't invited for the prayer circle."

lacrosse,313mm2,scrotesmcgoates,2,Thu Apr 2 02:13:53 2015 UTC,More communication among the D and having people be able to pick corners when shooting. Our D is new and have little chemistry(besides to one kid who's been playing on MN chill who knows what he's doing) others have trouble playing D and switching up on fast breaks. The offensive middies and attack are deadly with passing and getting open but their one flaw is being able to shoot well. Their problem is they either but the goalie in the net or miss the net wide. These among with a little more condition can make us a state bound threat

AND, I want to take a timeout specifically to get your explanation of said call / penalty. (Never pulled this one out mostly b/c nothing has been THAT egregious but always pondered the process of it....) I don't recall the specific rule but it's NFHS.  Coaches are allowed to address you during the halftime break, as you stated. What is common protocol for this? I have had refs fine with me talking to them immediately at half, ones that have demanded not until 4 minutes from next face, and ones that flat out refused to talk. Additionally, what are the requirements of the official to alert the opposing coach of any specific points coming from our meeting? As an opposing coach, I would like to be privy to the opposing coaches conversation - how's that work?

lacrosse,30zuu5,98rmanchester,11,Wed Apr 1 00:52:41 2015 UTC,"Ok, so this falls under the realm of ""unnecessary contact""... let's look at the rulebook:  Rule 5.9.2   Deliberate and excessively violent contact made by a defensive ­player against an offensive player who has established a screening position.   So What Does that Mean?  If you see the pick, don't run through the pick.  It's pretty simple.  We will typically let SOME contact go, but if you see a pick you are supposed to go around it.  Contact is only supposed to occur if you don't see the pick.  This penalty can be from 1-3 minutes and CAN be unreleasable.  Typically it's of the 1 min releasable kind.  But if it is excessively violent, you are a repeat offender, or the contact is to the head/neck, you could see the penalty minutes rise and an unreleasable tacked on."

lacrosse,30xv42,accipitradea,16,Tue Mar 31 22:42:47 2015 UTC,"People are so fucking ridiculous. Oh boo hoo, you have to wear some protective head gear. There is virtually zero downside to this, people are just too afraid of change and/or afraid they'll look silly (hint: most people already look silly playing sports; those goggles ain't exactly sexy).  Now if you want to take issue with them not being an effective piece of protective equipment then fine. Fuck it, throw 'em in boys' helmets. I like this line though:     The biggest fear among girls’ lacrosse coaches and players is that the headgear might make the girls’ game become more like the boys’ game    None of the girls I went to high school with preferred the girls' game to guys'."
lacrosse,30xv42,jewunit,6,Tue Mar 31 16:55:35 2015 UTC,"Some of these statements are so absurd. As an older Canadian, I remember the days of Don Cherry complaining about visors, bigger shoulder pads, and I've even seen the reports of when they were first implementing helmets in hockey (although I wasn't alive then).   Ann Carpenetti, vice president of lacrosse operations at US Lacrosse, the sport’s national governing body, called Florida’s decision “irresponsible” and said the headgear decision could make the game more hazardous because it might embolden players to be more aggressive.   Is basically the exact same argument that we had in hockey against helmets, visors, and shoulder pads in hockey. ALL of which were proven to REDUCED the number of injuries, even well after they were implemented. The helmet one is hard to look at only because back in the day concussions used to go unreported constantly, because they just didn't understand them enough and they knew that if they went reported the player couldn't play, and coaches would often never let a player play again after that. After we started to learn more about them (hint - at the exact same time we implemented helmets) people started reporting more concussions, so it looks like helmets increased the number of concussions, when in reality it's just an increase in the reports.  And all this from the vice president of lacrosse operations at US Lacrosse, seriously? They should know better than that. Hockey is a faster game now than it was before, but the number of injuries has gone down significant due to advancements in protective equipment technology.    Hall, the Coral Shores coach, said, “The more protection you put on the head, the more likely they will use it as a weapon.”   Seriously, an absolutely terrible argument that has been proven wrong again and again throughout history.    “Already, I’ve definitely seen more aggressive play this year,” said Steinberg, the Buchholz senior. “Girls will put their head down and charge after a ball on the ground.”    That's because your coaches are teaching you bad habits. You don't see good mens level players doing that, and look at all the gear we wear. Good coaching and teaching prevents that, not fear due to a lack of equipment.   “They say protection will create a gladiator effect,” she said. “If the officials enforce the rules and the coaches teach by the rules, then the game cannot change. Athletes cannot play more aggressively unless you allow them to do so.”   Exactly what needs to be said. Coaches are going way past the basics way too fast now a-days. I've seen so many teams at the youth level here in Canada running great plays, pick and rolls, and whatnot, but at the end of the day its the team that passes, catches, and picks up the loose balls better who wins the game at the end of the day.  This whole thing is exactly the same as the history of hockey. Hockey is less aggressive now than it was IMO, it's a faster game with harder shoulder to shoulder hits, but rules have changed and things like slashing and hooking are no longer allowed. The number of injuries has only gone down since introducing better and better equipment, but the spirit of the sport is the same. Maybe some older football players could chime in on how it reflect the history of that sport too, as I'm sure it has connections as well."
lacrosse,30xv42,henerydods,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:41:08 2015 UTC,"I pretty much agree that it's no big deal to wear the headgear, it's only going to make the game more safe. I am a Brit and we play lacrosse with absolutely NO protective gear apart from gumshields. I have actually never seen an injury happen on the field myself but I have heard of people getting serious eye injuries. It just makes you wonder why we are all taking the risk!

What is more pertinent to solving the concussion crisis is training officials and coaches in women's lacrosse rules. If i see another guy get hired to be a women's coach with 0 women';s lacrosse experience I am going to puke.

lacrosse,30xv42,Sun-Ghoti,1 point,Wed Apr 1 12:04:54 2015 UTC,"Except in Lacrosse, people are shooting a small ball made of 100% rubber at a fast speed. A small, compact ball going at a fast speed will hurt somebody badly. Sports like basketball, soccer, and volleyball are different. The balls are way less dangerous when thrown to the head because they're easier to catch and cause less damage on impact due to their circumference being way larger than a lacrosse ball. Baseball and softball requires require helmets went umping or batting because the ball is being thrown at them, essentially like lacrosse, but lax is like that most of the time. Safety wise, Lacrosse is more dangerous than most of the sports you listed. Helmets  being implemented would reduce concussions and make the sport more safe and fun to play.

lacrosse,30y3l2,fruitbear753,3,Wed Apr 1 03:04:34 2015 UTC,"Here in Canada it's pretty common for girls to have played with guys rules and never ever pick up a girls field stick. Obviously our huge box lacrosse bias affects that. We have girls only box lacrosse leagues with the same rules as mens. I've also played against the odd girl on mens teams. They were usually from a small town outside of the city that didn't have a girls only program, but they could still hold their own in the lower level leagues (we are divided up by skill & age up here, and we play with clubs, not high school teams) so we saw no problem with that."
lacrosse,30y3l2,hairinthewind,5,Tue Mar 31 20:03:38 2015 UTC,"Canadian here as well, I know many girls in the box program (where there is full out cross checking involved just like men's) who absolutely love the contact and wish there was a field league with mens rules for women too. I don't agree that women's lacrosse sucks it's just different from what we are used to seeing in men's so we are confused and put off by it. Passion for the game is held high in both leagues and glad to see the game grow in any way."
lacrosse,30y3l2,smilli02,4,Tue Mar 31 20:44:16 2015 UTC,"If they want it, then they are going to have to organize it themselves. That's how all our leagues started out west here. We have a new league up here that just sprouted up in the last few years and it's masters lacrosse rules for girl players who have never played before. It slowly gets more and more players every year, but it started with a few girls who played for years who had friends who wanted to try, but nowhere to try.   It's the same way the ladies box league started here too, some girls wanted to play, so they made their own leagues. Start small with maybe 1 or 2 teams worth of people and grow from there. I'm sure they could play men's field if they wanted to, they have already proven themselves to be able to handle men's box."
lacrosse,30y3l2,NewYorkerinGeorgia,6,Tue Mar 31 20:55:26 2015 UTC,"I actually enjoy watching lady lax. It takes a ridiculous amount of skill for them to play the way they do. I've tried my hand once or twice with a women's stick and I suck at it. But, honestly, if I was given the chance to actually try a game of women's lacrosse, I'd do it in a heartbeat."
lacrosse,30y3l2,VanillaFaceB,2,Tue Mar 31 21:20:37 2015 UTC,"Based on the current hubbub over helmets, I'm guessing it's because the women who play and coach it don't want it to."
lacrosse,30y3l2,theanuranking,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:44:51 2015 UTC,"So my next question is why don't they want it? As the way goes women have tended to have to fight in sports to be able to play an ""equal"" game. Women's lax seems like the least equal thing possible to me."
lacrosse,30y3l2,syd40,1 point,Tue Mar 31 22:00:30 2015 UTC,"I played and now I coach. The women's game is skill based and more about finesse than brute force. The rules are constantly evolving as we try to figure out how to keep the game fast, safe and still maintain our technique. We are actively trying to change the rules so it is a more enjoyable sport to watch, but I would never want to see it become the men's game. If girls want to play that way, then play the men's game, but the women's game has a whole level of strategy that would never come into play in the men's game and it would be a shame ot lose that just because people don't understand it."
lacrosse,30y3l2,tioem,6,Tue Mar 31 23:29:03 2015 UTC,"I do not know any women coaching the game right now that do not feel exactly this way. Thanks for writing that out.

lacrosse,30ykji,henerydods,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:58:24 2015 UTC,"Are you a current box lacrosse player as well? Because box lacrosse is just now starting in most places in Canada. Minor lacrosse here in Calgary starts next week, so if you aren't registered for a box team yet you should email some clubs to get registered. We don't usually play field until box lacrosse is over, and that usually happens around the end of June / Beginning of July. As far as field lacrosse, feel free to contact http://www.ontariolacrosse.com/ in any way you can. Try calling the number, or sending a message to them on twitter. They will know the answer to the questions you are asking, and that is why they are there so don't be scared to ask them what may seem like a silly question or something like that. Call sooner than latter though, don't want to miss out on anything that is happening really soon.  Edit* Sorry, I didn't even think that you could be older and just assumed you were youth, rusty_buttplug42 has a perfect league for older players, I play masters out in Alberta and it's amazingly fun. It's low contact and designed around having fun, and beers afterwards. Not a large time commitment (1 game a week out here, every Monday night at the same time) and I find the guys to be a ton of fun to hang around with, like a super super friendly version of beer league hockey."
lacrosse,30ykji,henerydods,2,Tue Mar 31 20:11:16 2015 UTC,Lol yeah I'm a bit older i guess now so the masters league sounds right up my alley. I'll have to look more into that. Cheers
lacrosse,30ykji,noisyblumpkin,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:57:09 2015 UTC,"I would look into that sooner than latter, only because out west here our master starts in 1 week as well (box masters, however if you're looking for field, they probably do that too). We have a draft night where we make teams. It's not one to be missed because it's less about drafting rosters and more about drinking an over abundance of draft beer. Great guys involved in masters lacrosse, I can't even begin to recommend it enough. We also play drop in masters field every Sunday afternoon too when the weather is good, again there are many beers involved."

Actually, i require  my players on the field to all exchange daps on a goal ( both defense and offense) similarly to hockey. The sideline is required to holler and cheer every great play (goal, save, slide, etc).   I just believe THIS is over the top.

Don't get me wrong it was a good save, but that's the kind of shot you love as a goalie because it makes you look great when he could have just put it almost anywhere else on the cage and it wouldn't have been save-able. I'm sure that in his head Donahue had won the game before the ball even got to him. That's a goal a huge percentage of the time and it looked like he was just going through the motions on the shot.  Also they talked about that possession call on Kavanagh leaving the box early, but what they failed to mention the entire time is if any of the refs CALLED possession or not, which is far more relevant than if he actually gained it. It's pretty simple to stay in the box until it's called, so if none of them called it Kavanagh just flat out fucked up."

It'll work just fine but that is one head that is pretty strictly designed for D. A few options for new mesh though: since you said you'd like a soft mesh I highly recommend String King. They just came out with their type 2 mesh and it's really nice. You also might like a wax mesh like ECM or Throne. It provides a lot of the benefits of both hard and soft meshes but with the downside of wearing out quicker.   Any other questions you might have just lemme know!"

If you have the luxury of a lacrosse specific store in your area (not a big box chain) then I suggest going there and getting some opinions."
lacrosse,30lx8t,MattHand13,3,Sun Mar 29 00:27:59 2015 UTC,"Like /u/thecakeisahyperbole said, the x10 isn't a good head for middies, but if you're going to play midfield, I'd use ninja mesh from ninjalax.

lacrosse,30lx8t,Knuckle_Punk,1 point,Sat Mar 28 21:32:21 2015 UTC,"Anything 20mm will work well on a wider head, the larger diamonds will give you more room to stretch the mesh along the top and allow you to pull the mesh to the sidewalk without sacrificing pocket depth"

lacrosse,30iejw,The_Hippopotamoose,10,Fri Mar 27 17:17:45 2015 UTC,"Less bulk made me feel like I could move more freely. On some level its a preference for not having shoulder pads holding one's arms down, or elbow pads glueing your arms in place.   Plus – as I'm sure is part of the reason – it looks cool."
lacrosse,30iejw,flowtorious44,5,Fri Mar 27 17:42:15 2015 UTC,"Shoulder caps do little to actually protect you. Parents like them because they seem more safe, but the reality is that they just add weight and restrict movement. You really only need to cover your collar bones and sternum."
lacrosse,30iejw,flowgod,6,Fri Mar 27 17:56:18 2015 UTC,Got anything to back that up?   If I could tell my 15 year old self to keep the shoulder pads attached I might not have a bunch of screws in my shoulder.   Edit: it wasn't one hit. It was hundreds over 10 years.
lacrosse,30iejw,saintwhiskey,3,Fri Mar 27 18:29:53 2015 UTC,"If the impact was high enough to break your shoulder then lacrosse pads wouldn't have done anything anyway. They are not football pads, and are not designed to deflect the kind of impact that would break your shoulder."
lacrosse,30iejw,flowgod,2,Fri Mar 27 20:34:03 2015 UTC,Source?  He asked if you had anything to back up your source and you responded with something else that you didn't source either.
lacrosse,30iejw,peebsunz,4,Fri Mar 27 20:42:23 2015 UTC,"Hmm yea let me dig into my ass and pull out this university study that doesn't exist. My source? I played both football and lacrosse for 14 years, including college experience as well as working at a lacrosse equipment store for 4 years while in college. Football pads are made out of a thick plastic outer shell layered over about 1 - 1.5inches of high impact, shock absorbing foam. The size and shape of the pad is designed to spread impact over a greater area and lessen the blow to the player. Lacrosse pads on the other hand are typically made of .5 -1 inch of foam (not always high impact) and may feature a thin layer of hard plastic. These pads are designed to protect the player against impact from sticks (slashes) and to protect the sternum and collar bones from shots. They are not as thick, or as large as football pads because their intended use is different. The same way that lacrosse helmets are not as concussion resistant as football helmets. They are simply not designed for the same thing."
lacrosse,30iejw,flowgod,-3,Fri Mar 27 21:18:02 2015 UTC,"Yah, that's just not true at all my friend. Sure they aren't designed for football style spear tackles, but they absolutely are designed to spread out the impact from shoulder to shoulder and shoulder to ground impacts. Take it from someone who has played HOCKEY and lacrosse just as long as you have football and lacrosse. Lacrosse pads are like far more mobile versions of hockey pads. The difference is that in lacrosse, high speed shoulder to shoulder impacts are rare, they are usually slower and the bigger risk is usually the fall to the ground. That is what the shoulder cap is designed for. Vs in hockey where high speed shoulder-shoulder impacts happen regularly, so their shoulder cups are much larger. Vs football where they literally run full sprint and dive into each others shoulders, so their shoulder caps are gigantic.  The shoulder cap is there for a reason, wear it."
lacrosse,30iejw,henerydods,2,Fri Mar 27 21:42:44 2015 UTC,It's BS. There is a reason hockey pads have gigantic shoulder cups. It's because they have tons of shoulder to shoulder impacts every single game. It's much more rare to see an impact like that in lacrosse however. It still happens obviously and that's why we wear them.
lacrosse,30iejw,henerydods,1 point,Fri Mar 27 20:51:07 2015 UTC,"Well they saved my shoulder last game. I was thinking about cutting off my shoulder pads because they're sewn on and i would've only worn a chest pad that covered my upper chest, but I didn't have time and played my game with the shoulder pads on. During that game, a wreckless d-pole lashed his stick straight down onto my shoulder where my pad was. It saved my shoulder and the season. This being said, many people still play without the shoulder pads, and I can see why, but from now on I'm always playing with shoulder pads."
lacrosse,30iejw,MattHand13,7,Fri Mar 27 20:42:26 2015 UTC,wouldn't have ended your season just wouldve hurt like a bitch.  source: happened to me yesterday
lacrosse,30iejw,shdlax75,3,Fri Mar 27 22:08:57 2015 UTC,"A lot of goalies don't wear shin pads because they don't want to look like ""a pussy"" If you wear shin pads it looks like you are a beginner, or that you're afraid of the ball, both of which will be taken advantage of by a good offence. If they determine that the goalie is weak, they might take worse shots because they think it will be easier to score.   Personally I just don't like shin pads, I find them uncomfortable, and It doesn't even hurt that much to get hit in the shins.  If you do want to wear shin pads wear sweats over them and nobody would know the difference."
lacrosse,30iejw,TestTubeInMyPocket,2,Fri Mar 27 21:21:37 2015 UTC,I agree about the shin guards but I got a pretty gnarly injury on my shins so now I have to wear shin guards when I play
lacrosse,30iejw,admiralejandro,3,Fri Mar 27 23:05:12 2015 UTC,"I mean, if you're a good goalie who wears shin guards, how is an offence going to ""take advantage"" of that? I can see them taking advantage of a rookie goalie who is scared, but guys like Dillon Ward make more saves with their body than anyone else I've seen (probably mainly due to his box background). I don't know if he wears pads under his sweats, but I wouldn't be surprised if he did. And if it helps a goalie make more saves and be more confident in the cage, why would anyone advocate against that?"
lacrosse,30iejw,henerydods,3,Sat Mar 28 07:41:24 2015 UTC,All the guys on your team are giving the other team an advantage when in comes to game time. I bet the same guys who are cutting down on their equipment are also the ones who don't think they need to wear a cup when they play.
lacrosse,30iejw,77Columbus,2,Sat Mar 28 02:05:42 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why there is a stigma against wearing pads to protect yourself apart from this apparent SWAG factor that is a current theme in most sports. I understand some players feel their movement can be impaired by multiple pads, however this is not always the case.   Also look has absolutely sweet fuck all to do with skill or ability. I have seen players wearing no shoulder/chest armor, defense arm pads and thin gloves get pummeled to bits because they have been cocky and believed they are better than everyone else. Vice Versa I have seen heavily padded guys run rings around players. I have seen this the opposite way round so its absolutely nothing to do with style.  One small case, the team I used to play for had a local rival team who had a Canadian player who had played Box and Field in Canada and the UK. He would never play a game without pads and he was exceptional.   Pads are specifically designed by companies to offer protection and maneuverability. Why would they make them if people couldn't get the range of motion using them. People would just buy shoulder liners instead of shoulder pads.   As for shin pads, Goalie of the team I coach wears them and no one gives him shit about it because hes got a pair of brass balls."
lacrosse,30iejw,LaxyDan,1 point,Fri Mar 27 23:29:52 2015 UTC,"Can't agree with this any more. As a Canadian player who pads up, and I believe shreds up the floor (hope so anyway, just made a Sr. B roster, which I'm incredibly proud of so I'm going to plug that a bit now, haha), I can't see myself playing without them. I play such an aggressive style, I want you to hit me, I want to get as close to you as possible, that's where I make my bread and butter, that's how I control the defender. Plus I'm so used to box where we literally get pumped with cross checks all day, so therefore, I am so use to wearing the extra pads required for box that I almost feel naked without them."
lacrosse,30iejw,henerydods,0,Sat Mar 28 07:48:38 2015 UTC,"I see your argument, but I didn't cut my shoulders for ""SWAG"". I cut them for mobility and I don't want/need big shoulder pads on D. Also, if we see a goalie wearing shin guards, everyone immediately assumes he is trash, and everyone will just shoot low because that probably means he doesn't get his stick low/tries to make leg saves/isn't good at goalie. Hate my comment if you want but I promise that's the truth, at least for varsity and college ball."
lacrosse,30iejw,SouthernLaxProbs,1 point,Sat Mar 28 06:15:54 2015 UTC,"Its not a hate on your comment specifically its hate on general ideals that we hold on the sport rather than saying. ""If you wanna wear pads thats cool, I feel more comfortable without them."" Rather than ostracizing others that feel more comfortable with them on"
lacrosse,30iejw,LaxyDan,0,Sat Mar 28 13:00:47 2015 UTC,"Ok I see what you're saying. I agree with that actually. I don't give 2 shits about what people wear on their shoulders really unless it's absurd or they have, or previously had a bad injury. But I stand by my comment about goalies and shin guards."
lacrosse,30iejw,SouthernLaxProbs,2,Sat Mar 28 13:38:01 2015 UTC,"That's fair, in a game you have to make a snap judgement on how to deal with an opposing player. It's the nature of the game.   I think because I coach now more than I play I get to see other teams warming up and see how they approach the game and take my judgement on that as I have more time."
lacrosse,30iejw,LaxyDan,1 point,Sat Mar 28 16:11:10 2015 UTC,"Well I can agree with that. I don't know what level you coach but I coach U19 and play in college and I know in school we scout but coaching summer ball, it's closer to a snap judgment, watching the kid warm up and determining how he is."
lacrosse,30iejw,SouthernLaxProbs,2,Sat Mar 28 17:12:19 2015 UTC,"If you show up to a game and every player on the other team is wearing bulky shoulder pads with the arm flaps attached, huge elbow pads, floppy gloves, ankle socks and black cleats from Sportmart...you are going to cruise to a massive win, guaranteed.  Gotta look good to play good.  Who do you think is a better player?  This guy?  Or  This guy?"
lacrosse,30iejw,westosterone26,5,Fri Mar 27 18:23:17 2015 UTC,"Ok, based on that theory, who is better between these two?    armoured up from top to bottom, look at that arm.   Or   hardly can even call those slash guards. So much exposed skin, defenders wet dream   Because one of them is one the best lacrosse players in the world, if not the very best, and I'll give you a hint, it's not the guy who wins by your criteria.   Hell I bet if you looked at every single one of team Canada's attack line up from this years worlds and compared them to the Americans your statement would be laughable. And how did that turn out for the American game? I can guaranty you a check from a guy the size of Brodie Merrill doesn't feel good.  I absolutely hate this attitude against protection in the game. I have never once felt that my gear hindered my movement. I have, however, had bruises so bad that I couldn't grip my stick properly any more. I have seen kids cut of their shoulder caps, get hit and break their collar bones. I have seen broken ribs from not wearing proper kidney pads in box.   Wear protection kids! They teach you that in sex ed already, they should teach it to you on the field too. It's a stupid attitude that lacrosse equipment hinders mobility and speed, it's literally designed for the opposite of that. When you can shoot harder and more accurate than a fully padded John Tavares, or BtB better than John Grant Jr in full shoulder and bicep pads then come talk to me, until then pad the fuck up!"
lacrosse,30iejw,henerydods,1 point,Fri Mar 27 21:25:39 2015 UTC,"As an attackman, I wore similar elbow pads to the first guy. Elbow pads can be large without being super bulky. I would never wear those small ones that many middies and defensemen wear.  As far as shoulders pads, however, your first guy is wearing very minimal, if any.  Also, as you are clearly aware, Box Lacrosse is an entirely different style of game compared to the American field game. MUCH more slashing and aggressive hitting due to the fact that the field is tiny, outside shots are not nearly as prevalent (or effective) and the players are...well...Canadian and typically from hockey backgrounds.  We arent talking box here. If I was playing box, I might wear rib pads and larger shoulder pads as well."
lacrosse,30iejw,westosterone26,0,Mon Mar 30 15:26:45 2015 UTC,Are you really saying that Canada won because they wore more pads?
lacrosse,30iejw,peebsunz,2,Fri Mar 27 22:15:06 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, oh go no. I'm saying wearing less pads doesn't make you a better lacrosse player, doesn't make you look better, doesn't make you faster, and doesn't change the attitudes of people who play against you. And if it does, then your attitude or the attitude of those playing around you is wrong. I guaranty team USA didn't laugh at John Grant Jr and play him any easier because he shows up with wrist guards, slash guards, bicep pads, and shoulder pads to a field game. If the best player in the world can do it without hindering his movement then I can't see why no one else can."
lacrosse,30iejw,henerydods,2,Fri Mar 27 22:47:23 2015 UTC,"he isn't even wearing shoulder pads in that picture, most pros dont wear shoulder pads when they play"
lacrosse,30iejw,cs631,4,Sat Mar 28 23:35:20 2015 UTC,so looking good will make you a good team...  I get that that's a lacrosse thing. But you have to admit it's kind of ridiculous.
lacrosse,30iejw,kill619,1 point,Fri Mar 27 18:35:55 2015 UTC,"They are a tiny bit related. Really good players tend to not hit or checked as often; offensive players being too good of dodgers or moving the ball to quickly to get beat on too much, defense clearing the balling too well etc."
lacrosse,30iejw,westosterone26,2,Fri Mar 27 18:47:13 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Long, drawn out dodges aren't effective. Make a quick change of direction, get a step on your guy to draw a slide and move the ball. That's really the offensive theory to the (high-level) game in a nutshell. All about creating uneven situations."

lacrosse,30iejw,A_Crazy_Hooligan,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:10:02 2015 UTC,It makes you a better player. Not team. The hypothesis is it will give you confidence to dodge harder and hit harder. Thus making you better.
lacrosse,30iejw,westosterone26,2,Fri Mar 27 18:47:55 2015 UTC,I would have a lot more confidence to dodge harder and hit harder if I was wearing pads and had less of a chance of getting hurt.
lacrosse,30iejw,TestTubeInMyPocket,2,Fri Mar 27 19:05:29 2015 UTC,"Aren't you a goalie?   If you are thinking about getting hurt as an offensive player, its too late. It won't hurt if you get hit in the upper arm. The bulky pads in question might prevent a moment of pain on your upper arm, but they are restricting and look stupid.  Its worth a few minutes of slight discomfort to man up, take the slash and make a play."

Looking good doesn't necessarily translate into being good, but looking like a scrub (or a ""bambi"" as we used to say) is usually an indication that the player is not any good. Seriously.  It may be ridiculous, but its accurate."

lacrosse,30iejw,JackJonJonny,1 point,Sat Mar 28 12:16:38 2015 UTC,"Why? The same reason people do other dumb stuff: they see it on TV and think it's a good idea for them. What most lacrosse players fail to realize is that offensive players in D1 wear full size arm pads. They just look at the defenseman who never gets checked on the arms, see the small elbow pads, and think they are a good idea.   They are not.   Also, you are not a D1 player.  And most importantly, THE GUY HITTING YOU ISN'T A D1 PLAYER! He misses. And when he does, you will lament your little bitty pads."
lacrosse,30iejw,Falcon25,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:42:13 2015 UTC,"Shooting and passing are hugely hindered by large arm pads. Plus if you are on an active workout regime and have solid arms it helps. Except for the bone right above the wrist, but I don't think I've ever seen a pad that covers it, not that I'd use it if I did."

lacrosse,30g3l8,TheFourGuy,2,Fri Mar 27 02:03:23 2015 UTC,"You should just explain to him how lacrosse goalies aren't like hockey goalies. To have a 50% save percentage as a lacrosse goalie is pretty damn good. In reality, you're not even expected to save balls shot closer than 10 yards.   Also probably talk about how it's just a scrimmage and doesn't matter. Everyone has bad games. I got scored on 22 times in my first varsity lacrosse game and I'm starting now."
lacrosse,30g3l8,The_Hippopotamoose,2,Fri Mar 27 17:06:41 2015 UTC,"Sounds like your defence needs to step up and take responsibility for it. Or you need to teach him that not all goals are his fault. This is a team game and mistakes are made as a team.   Look at Dillon Wards interview after winning MVP at the worlds. He says he couldn't have won that award if he didn't have the defence he had in front of him. Well it goes both ways, if he had a shit defence in front of him he still could have had a MVP level performance, but Canada never would have won that game, and he would never have got the award because without a good defence a goalie will always look bad too."
lacrosse,30g3l8,henerydods,2,Fri Mar 27 02:15:18 2015 UTC,without a good defence a goalie will always look bad    QFT  My advice...invite him over this weekend with a copy of the game tape and break down the game film with him.  Keep perspective.  It's JV.  You're there to get better.  Breaking down game film is underrated for all players but especially goalies.  It can be difficult to understand what's going right/wrong in the heat of the moment.  Film gives you room to piece it together.
lacrosse,30g3l8,BaconBob,1 point,Fri Mar 27 14:14:20 2015 UTC,"A couple of things... 1) You scored 1 goal, you aren't winning any games without any offense. If the offense can't hold onto the ball and slow down the game their is nothing the goalie can do but try and survive the barrage. 2) The score of most games has almost nothing to do with how a goalie plays as an individual. He could have had the half of his life and still allowed 9 goals. He could also face two shots let them both in and you have won the game. 3) He has to develop a positive mental attitude and short memory. Defenses have bad days sometimes or bad day brought on by your offense's bad day. He is a member/leader of the defensive unit. Worrying about the last shot distracts your from the next one."
lacrosse,30g3l8,newswilson,1 point,Fri Mar 27 04:13:46 2015 UTC,"Explain to him that lacrosse is a high scoring game and the goal of any defense is to keep the other team under ten goals. If you can do that you give your offense a chance to win, giving up more than ten is asking a lot of them."
lacrosse,30g3l8,77Columbus,1 point,Sat Mar 28 02:19:57 2015 UTC,"I've been playing defense for 8 years and I'm a captain on my team this year so I know how he feels when it comes to self blame.  I've also been defending the same goalie all 8 years, so I've seen him at his best and worst.  My goalie never actually got any real training from anyone who truly knew what they were doing, he just grew and got better with experience and is now one of the best goalies in our league.  I know he just goes out in his backyard with his dad or a friend and just takes shot for hours.  I know some of his favorite drills are: 1. not using a stick and stopping the ball with his body (body position) 2. Having someone take hard shots at him with a tennis ball (not being afraid of the ball)  Either way it doesn't sound like it was your friends fault, I hope this helps!"

lacrosse,309822,theloserlaterwins,5,Wed Mar 25 15:46:22 2015 UTC,"So typically the off-ball stuff is called as interference, but it is essentially holding.  The language is important here  Rule 6.3.1   A player shall not impede the movement of an opponent or his crosse   So we have a holding if the attackman can't make his cut.  Your defender has the right to the space, so if he has his feet set and his crosse isn't the object preventing movement, he's in the clear.  You can run WITH the cutter, mirroring his cut and then denying the passing lane and then making the check when the ball is within 5 yards.  You can't PREVENT the cut from happening with your body or crosse though.  You'll hear an official say ""let him go"" or ""let him cut.""  I have seen it called, typically it's cause they are more than 5 yards away.  It's rarer, and the bench and single side officials really need to be paying attention to catch the subtle ones."
lacrosse,309822,henerydods,3,Wed Mar 25 15:58:34 2015 UTC,How long does a long pole have to use an L hold or V hold before he gets called?
lacrosse,309822,henerydods,6,Wed Mar 25 19:07:02 2015 UTC,"There is no designated amount of time.  That will depend greatly the official, the level of the game, and your play.  If it is a younger (in terms of experience) official, the whistle will be quicker.  If it is a highly competitive HS varsity game, you'll probably get away with more.  If you've been flagged for like 2 holds already and the game is getting out of hand, you'll get away with less.  Consistency is a big issue in officiating.  Unfortunately, situations can be so unique that it's hard to give blanket statements.  I would love to have distinct guidelines, but they don't exist.  Listen to your officials.  The good ones will let you know when you are on the edge.  If they don't, ask them to."
lacrosse,30b62p,Mc_copern,2,Wed Mar 25 23:09:42 2015 UTC,Go to your local play it again sports if you have one near you. Buy used gear. It gets expensive really quick and before you know it your sucked in but you'll love it.
lacrosse,30b62p,Reborn_Swiitch,2,Thu Mar 26 01:18:39 2015 UTC,"3rdyear goalie here. No need to buy a new shaft. You can use your attack one and itl work just fine. For a head i would get a nemesis. Its very cheap (only 30-40 dollars depending on where you look) and a lot of goalies like it. If one of your goalies can string a head for you, great. If not they sell them pre strung. Goalie is a very fun position im sure you'll love it."
lacrosse,30b62p,AidanPow,3,Thu Mar 26 01:30:21 2015 UTC,"Being a goalie can be very, very expensive.  You will need special gloves, chest pad, neck guard, and cup, definitely cup. Also most goalies have two sticks, which can already be ridiculously expensive.   So if your going to make the switch, I would recommend doing it for good, who know, you might be good at it."

lacrosse,30bzuv,ilcoloseo,2,Thu Mar 26 03:08:54 2015 UTC,"Not sure about stateside, but unless there is something really suspicious stick checks really don't happen that often and its only usually our FOGO's who get checked.  What was wrong with his pole?"
lacrosse,30bzuv,LaxyDan,3,Thu Mar 26 03:15:15 2015 UTC,"I think it was that pocket was too deep and that the head itself was so warped that the ball couldn't come out unless it was forced out. He picked up the ball, ran it down the whole length of the field and scored, all while being repeatedly checked by some very frustrated middies. Needless to say it was impounded."
lacrosse,30bzuv,LaxyDan,2,Thu Mar 26 03:23:32 2015 UTC,"That could be why he was pulled up. As much as it is nice to see a pole goal. If he is having his stick smashed half to hell and the ball is staying where it is, it does looks suspicious."
lacrosse,30bzuv,LaxyDan,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:31:19 2015 UTC,"I understand that it does look suspicious when you reflect back on the game, but at the moment we were all taken by surprise a bit, considering we've never seen or heard of a pole being checked. You could imagine our anger when the goal was revoked, thankfully though we won that game."
lacrosse,30bzuv,theanuranking,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:41:52 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I can get why you were pissed I would be hitting the roof as a Pole. I guess because I have reffed a few games I can see it from the other side. Once had a FOGO score with the ball in the back of his stick, didn't realize what I had seen until it happened.  Also congrats on the win."
lacrosse,30bzuv,JackJonJonny,1 point,Thu Mar 26 10:29:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks, it was a tough game. Unfortunately the refs weren't on our side (when are they ever?) and two fights broke out. Thankfully nothing regrettable happened and no on was ejected."
lacrosse,30bzuv,theanuranking,2,Thu Mar 26 11:31:01 2015 UTC,"This is a terrible attitude to have.  I really don't like getting on my soapbox about this sort of thing because I was a player long before I was an official, but I will.  Of course the officials weren't on your side because they are on no one's side.  If there were two fights, it sounds like your officials had no control over the game, but YOUR teams were the ones who fought.  The fact that no one got ejected from two FIGHTS is ludicrous.  Keep in mind that the officials don't care at all about who wins what game.  We aren't fans of the teams we officiate, we just don't care.  This is especially true the lower the level is.  We are there to do our jobs, to make sure the game is fair and safe.  If you want to say the officials did a poor job in that, then that is fine.  But having that sort of attitude towards officials is going to do you zero good going forward."
lacrosse,30bzuv,EducatedGenus,1 point,Thu Mar 26 14:36:47 2015 UTC,"Our district is notorious for horrible referees. I understand what you're saying, and I should've worded it better. Being biased to my own team, of course I'm going to say the refs favor the other team, 100% of the time. But this game the refereeing was just god awful. Things were getting too violent, and yes I will say some of my teammates should've been ejected, but also some from the other team. Not a single flag was thrown the first fight, not even any kind of warning. All we got from the refs were ""I didn't see anything, I can't do anything about it."" Even though the altercation was a good 30 seconds to a full minute long. This essentially allowed the second fight to break out. Also I wanna apologize for coming off as ""that kid that thinks every flag should go against the other team"", I try not to be that kind of person. I love winning, but I love an exciting and fair game more."
lacrosse,30bzuv,theanuranking,1 point,Thu Mar 26 15:56:04 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that you as a team can request people's sticks on the other team to be checked. So after their middies furiouly hacked away at the pole, but it wouldnt come out they may have done so. Even then, if the pocket was that deep you shouldn't be surprised if it's checked by the officials because they can probably see how ridiculously deep it is just by looking at it."
lacrosse,30bzuv,ProfaneTank,1 point,Fri Mar 27 15:51:23 2015 UTC,"I went over this a couple of weeks ago in my weekly feature.  Two crosses per team are checked per game at a minimum.  These usually happen during the first timeout in the 1st and 3rd quarters or between quarters (unless there is a man-up/man-down situation).  These are chosen by the officials and can be literally ANY crosse and player in the playing area, including the bench.  Usually they fall into one of three categories:  1) Random player.  If there is nothing suspicious and the game is close, I'll grab a random short stick, usually the one closest to me as they leave the field.  2) Player who never seems to get dispossessed.  This is much rarer than you think and I have caught more illegal sticks in option 1 than this one.  This can be ANY player.  3) A long-pole late in the game.  Long poles are RARELY illegal so we will often grab them late in the game if it is a blowout.  It sounds like your teammate deserved to have his crosse checked and the goal was rightfully revoked.  You have no one to be angry with besides your teammate for bringing such an illegal crosse into the game."
lacrosse,30bzuv,newswilson,1 point,Thu Mar 26 14:30:10 2015 UTC,"You're right, he did deserve to get his stick checked, especially after performing what seemed almost impossible, the goal was rightfully revoked, and we should've been angry with him, but it was the heat of the moment, it was a close game where that goal tied the score. Also it was my teammates first year playing, and while as athletic as he is, he is also not the sharpest tool in the shed. It's partially the whole teams fault for his illegal stick, we should've checked it before the game."

That being said, I hope your recovery is quick and hope you can get back out on the field soon. Sorry to hear about your injury. Time to start watching lacrosse highlights and stringing videos."
lacrosse,304lu8,SouthernLaxProbs,1 point,Tue Mar 24 14:12:21 2015 UTC,"I'll add to wallball and string. Learn the team stuff inside and out, help breakdown film, become a student of the game. Gotta keep the mind sharp as well as the hands."
lacrosse,304lu8,msupz,5,Tue Mar 24 14:52:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear about the injury.  I agree with the wall ball and stringing as well.  But also I just have to say take it easy and if you get surgery and a physical trainer listen to your PT and doc.  I also tore my ACL and tried to rush back into things and it screwed me over.  So really, do what you can, of course, to keep your skills up but also think about your body and your future.  Good luck!"
lacrosse,304lu8,mwatson1010,3,Tue Mar 24 14:47:55 2015 UTC,"I tore my ACL and missed all of my senior season. Was the most frustrating thing I have ever had to deal with. But I focused a lot on my treatment and training my upper body strength. I think this helped me be able to return for fall ball lacrosse in college about a month or so before I was scheduled to. Also, I did my best to help my teammates during practice and games by being somewhat of a coach. I already had a great understanding of the game but I feel because of the time spent watching the game due to the injury the game is so slow to me know and I can see things happening and developing way before they actually occur. But to not be too wordy therapy, wall pall if possible, upper body strengthening and helping your teammates and watching the x's and o's of the game. Good luck with the rehab and have patience and know you will come back from it. Also, if you get a brace wear it. I tweaked mine once just messing around without it."
lacrosse,304lu8,Irish611,2,Tue Mar 24 15:20:45 2015 UTC,"This, I tore my ACL and pretty much lost 9 months of active training for the European Championships (as in, training exactly how the team was training). I focused on my recovery, first and foremost and trained the parts of my body that I could train, the upper body. But whatever you do, don't over extend or try to do more than your doctors tell you. You will be back on that field and your injury will fully heal, just give it time!  That being said, my doctor never gave me a knee brace as he felt it wasn't beneficial for my recovery. Luckily I never tweaked it again and in hindsight I agree with his decision."
lacrosse,304lu8,NIVEKii,2,Tue Mar 24 15:31:39 2015 UTC,"Having torn my ACL before here are some quick tips to keep your mind and skills sharp.   Hit the wall. Daily.  Once granted permission from your doctor start to shoot again using the surgically repaired knee as your off foot when planting. (I tore my right ACL so I was able to plant on my left foot and shoot right handed) Hit the weight room and crush upper body workouts. Continue to watch film and be a presence at practices and games. Learning more about the game and being able to increase your ""lacrosse IQ"" will be beneficial when you step back on the field. The most important tip that I can give you is to listen to whoever is working you out during physical therapy. Don't be afraid to push yourself, just don't do anything crazy that could prolong the injury.   Wishing you a speedy and healthy recovery."
lacrosse,304lu8,raven_bowie,1 point,Thu Mar 26 06:07:02 2015 UTC,"Also tore an ACL. DO NOT try to come back when you ""feel"" ready. I did that, big mistake. Do what the doctor says. And honestly - go to physical therapy regularly, do NOT let up on that."

lacrosse,300fd5,drdriedel,2,Mon Mar 23 20:29:14 2015 UTC,"Yea but Syracuse has not been this complete of a team in years past. Really the biggest difference for them this year has been Williams taking the draws, and Wardwell as the undisputed choice between the pipes. I think it was a crime to the team last year to split halves with Lamolinara.   Not sure I agree with you about Desko though. He's won a couple championships, and that doesn't happen accidentally. Now, I do agree that there are better coaches than Desko, but not many."
lacrosse,300fd5,Looks_Like_Twain,1 point,Mon Mar 23 23:08:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think they are good enough to go undefeated but I don't think they will. To your point I agree, If Williams is hovering around 65% from the x they will dominate."
lacrosse,300fd5,Looks_Like_Twain,0,Tue Mar 24 04:02:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, well they have had the most talented team every year since like '96 and still lose to teams like Bryant and Army in the tournament. I think they are the best team right now, but I also think Desko is one of the worst coaches in D1 and I'm not sure they can put together a plan if they go down early. If 'cuse plays Duke in the tournament and gets say a 4 goal spread I'm betting Duke."
lacrosse,300fd5,Looks_Like_Twain,3,Mon Mar 23 20:18:02 2015 UTC,"Desko has won five national titles. Among active coaches, he has the highest winning percentage in the NCAA tournament. If you actually think he is one of the worst coaches in D1, I'm afraid I can't give your opinion much credibility. If you're just being hyperbolic, well, I still think that's nuts. Desko is a great coach. To say anything else is just nuts."
lacrosse,300fd5,demeco31,3,Tue Mar 24 00:01:00 2015 UTC,"I think Syracuse is the biggest program in the country in terms of fans, money, coverage, etc. So, I think they should have a top 3 coach. Imho the following coaches are better: Tierny, Tambroni, Danowski, Pietromala, Starsia, Corrigan and Tillman. Just my opinion."

lacrosse,300fd5,demeco31,1 point,Tue Mar 24 19:05:53 2015 UTC,Good luck this year man! I think you have the best players every year so when things go wrong I blame Desko.
lacrosse,300fd5,Looks_Like_Twain,2,Tue Mar 24 22:57:23 2015 UTC,"I don't really think that's fair. After every lost game blaming the coach isn't the right assessment. At some point you have to hold players accountable, coaches can put us in all the right places and draw up the greatest plays but in the end Desko isn't out there shooting the ball or making a save. I think that some people under value him as a coach because of his style and how different it can be from the others you mentioned above. All of those guys with maybe the exception of Danowski have a reputation for being very loud yelling at refs, players ect. They are all super intense and wound up to 110% every day and even more so during games. So they give off this vibe that they are coaching really well but until you have been in a huddle with Desko you don't know the calmness he brings to the table in huge games. A perfect example was this year against Hopkins when we were down 3 early. Most coaches would call that timeout and yell and scream and try to pump us up. All Desko did was tell us to relax, play with confidence and drew up the next play. It's not an accident that Desko has been so successful in May, his players don't play tight and never lose their cool even if they are down and a huge part of that is the way in which Desko presents himself to his players on and off the field."
lacrosse,300fd5,JackJonJonny,1 point,Wed Mar 25 00:40:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the in depth reply. The more I mull this over the more I'm starting to come around. I love Syracuse's style of play, like coaches who respect their players and the officials and can totally relate to your point about a calm coach having a positive effect on a team. I can imagine hating playing for Tierny or Pietro and even Corrigan. I asked an ex US national player who I happen to live next to today who he thought the best coaches in NCAA were right now and he said Danowski and Desko. So yeah...I think you might be right, plus getting all those great players is part of his job too and he obviously does a good job of that. Seriously though, I hope you guys continue to crush teams. Go Orange."

lacrosse,301ekv,lax-a-lot,3,Mon Mar 23 18:26:10 2015 UTC,"Generally just maintain what you have now. You might be able to get away with adding weight, but probably not. You will usually need to have a pretty high calorie and high carb diet to support the amount of energy it takes to practice 3-4 times a week and play a game, and lift.   Generally just lift twice a week, and lower intensity as the season goes on because that's when your going to need the extra recovery time and energy. Just do your basic lifts at a maintenance level of intensity. Whatever your 5x5 max is right now, maybe lower that by 15% and stick to that 5x5 for the first half of the season, then hit that weight at 3x5 for the second half. Maybe skip lifting during playoffs if you need the extra recovery (or if your playoffs are a best of 7 series like mine that lasts over a week).   If you have to lower the weight throughout the season then do it, it's not inherently a bad thing. It's really hard to maintain size and strength through the season when you play such a demanding sport both endurance and strength wise. It's pretty normal to loose weight and loose # on your lifts throughout a season, unless you're a 20 year old testosterone producing monster, but at 23 and normal test levels I can't even come close to maintain a good squat all season. Take a couple of weeks off after the season is completely done (and I mean completely off, trust me, the end of a season is extremely hard on your body and you need the recovery time). Then hop back on the horse and start that summer bulk and getting your numbers bigger than ever before.   Off season I like to do only heavy lifting for a few months after lacrosse is done, then get into more explosive stuff with less ""recovery time"" between lifts. Then when winter lacrosse starts for us (Canada's pre season lacrosse) I start to hit the cardio hard (HIIT) while still lifting, but not as heavy, with less volume, and not as much progress as before. Usually my cardio is pretty solid by the time our training camps start for teams. Pretty much the same thing all hockey players have been doing up here for decades, just a few months offset."

lacrosse,301ekv,bondmaxbondrock,1 point,Tue Mar 24 01:18:29 2015 UTC,I have the same question. I'm in high school and I can't seem to find time between practice and school to lift.

lacrosse,2zyikq,Basi7,4,Mon Mar 23 00:30:48 2015 UTC,"Basi7 is spot on. As coaches we don't look for the most technically gifted or athletic players. We want team players guys that when you are 2 minutes from time have the determination to go attack the ball with everything they have got.   Keep calm, don't over think dropped passes or missed ground balls. They happen to even seasoned players.   Be talkative, call for the ball when you want it. Let the player who you want to pass to that the ball is coming for him. Shout when you are going for the ground ball.   We also love guys/gals who sponge up what we tell them, so listen, ask questions if you don't understand a drill, be keen.   Also good luck, if you need anymore help like Basi7 I am happy to give you some pointers."

Right obviously you have my previous comments to go on for help but to add to it I can add a few details to help you in scrimmage situations.   ---Defensively---  Firstly in unsettled situations (2vs1, 3vs2, 4vs3, etc) always remember the man with the ball is the most dangerous. If no one is covering him and you are closest make sure you are on him like a fly on shit.   In settled situations (2vs2, 3vs3, etc) Stick to your man, do not watch the ball, watch your man. You can check every 20 seconds or so where the ball is but try to keep your eyes on the player you are marking as much as possible. Trust your goalie to shout where the ball is.  ---Transition---  When your team has the ball in your defensive third, haul ass! If you don't have the ball run like your life depends on it. Be looking over your shoulder for the pass, stick up and ready. Don't turn around and face your defense, try to catch over your shoulder. (means you won't get blindsided.  If you have the ball, Haul ass! except if there is a middie infront of you look to pass it off, if he is clear.  ---GB---  Man and Ball. If there is a ground ball and you have one of your team mates following up behind you. Clear out the opposing player and shout 'Man' this lets your team mate know that you are free-ing him up to get the ball.   Is any of this helpful, If you need more ideas or thoughts feel free to message me anytime."

lacrosse,2zyikq,ParenthesisBot,2,Mon Mar 23 02:19:47 2015 UTC,"Athletic stance, one leg forward so you have a wider base, get lower than him, both hands at the bottom of your stick and create a V shape with your arms. Then drive your gloves into his hip (or chest if hip isn't clear) and push use your back leg to move you forward and push your arms out. Repeat until he gets the message.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EkVkuTojxs  This video shows you exactly how to hit a player hard. Just imagine that on a GB.   Side note I now coach with a guy who played D for Lynchburg."

lacrosse,2zyikq,sweetdbro,2,Mon Mar 23 02:43:36 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. His hands were too far apart and you would ideally have gloves touching however there is room for a little movement. As long as you aren't having one hand at the top and one at the bottom and plowing over someone.   If you focus on his body shape, leg movement and arms in relation to body (V shape) then it was fine. Just need to keep them hands together."

lacrosse,2zyikq,DrKillFactory,2,Mon Mar 23 02:16:42 2015 UTC,"If you're just starting, I strongly recommend wall ball. Find a wall, throw and catch 30 righty, 30 lefty, and keep going back and forth for as long as you can. With dodges, always focus on going north/south, not east/west. By that I mean as much as possible, dodge towards the goal. I play/played close D and long pole maddie, also played short stick defensive middie in high school for a bit. Don't rely on your stick when playing defense, move your feet."

lacrosse,2zvr4t,Camoman37,9,Sun Mar 22 05:58:00 2015 UTC,"It always sucks to get injured just remind him that he still has his college career ahead of him. He can still do all his footwork and other athletic stuff that does not involved the injured hand. If it is a big cast then that will limit what he can do with a stick but if he gets a short stick he can still do things one handed. He can also help coach your new goalie. This will help him as much as the new kid.  As for getting your freshman ready, take it as slow as you can. Go over technique on all the saves. I would shoot on him with tennis balls until he is confident he can save it. Tell him he is just catching terrible passes. He will duck and move his legs away from shots naturally and if you blast him it will just reaffirm what his body is already trying to do. Make sure his teammates know that so they do not hit him and slow his progress. Also, holding your pipes is almost always a free save so go over his arc, five points is all I teach. The other thing your new goalie can do is, fake it. Shooters will look at him and if he looks awkward in there then they will take shots from farther out then they should. Make sure his stance is correct and he is talking. That is usually the end of a goalie scout until he sees a few shots and teams figure out how good he is at saving shots. Also, let him wear thigh pads and shin guards if he wants, just have him wear sweats over them or else he might give away how new he is to goalie. Another thing do not let anybody get mad at him, he needs to feel as good as possible. If he is tense, sad or pissed he will move slower. I usually give my goalies ridiculously terrible advice to lighten the mood. For example, we had our JV goalie playing is his first Varsity game and he was pretty nervous. I told him all I expect is that he plays the best game in the history of lacrosse. The best thing you can do is make him feel confident in his ability to do it. Lastly, his teammates need to rally around him and make it as easy as possible for him in the goal.  If this is a little incoherent let me know and I will try to clarify things."
lacrosse,2zvr4t,GeneralPie,3,Sun Mar 22 07:43:13 2015 UTC,Luckily my team is behind this kid 100%. In practice last night they were all encouraging him and offering their advice on how to better protect the goal. The support is definitely there. The hardest part about the freshman practicing is that we hardly have any time for practices now that season is in. We have a very packed schedule with 2 or 3 games a week; I'm lucky to get a solid practice in between these games. Any advice I can give him on how to improve on his own?
lacrosse,2zvr4t,GeneralPie,3,Sun Mar 22 16:14:46 2015 UTC,"He can walk the line and walk his arc on his own. He needs to make those movements in to natural reactions.  He should think of it like shadow boxing. It takes a lot of reps for something to become a reflex. Of course wall ball, the better he is at clearing the less shots he will see. Also, anything that improves hand eye. Juggling or tossing a ball off the wall and catching it with his top hand to mimic the save movement. Jumping rope will help foot speed. The last thing is to just get extra shots from somebody he trusts. The shooter needs to help him get better and not be there to practice shooting."
lacrosse,2zvr4t,jhazach,5,Mon Mar 23 17:34:45 2015 UTC,If he is afraid of the ball then use tennis balls and just rip on him so he get more confident in stoping the ball

If he is as good as you say he is then he has a lot of knowledge to pass on to the new guy.  Let him develop the new guy, the idea of a legacy is powerful for most kids.

lacrosse,2ztrla,Vna43,4,Sun Mar 22 05:28:37 2015 UTC,"Heres a run down on basic gear  *Stick: your gonna need a shaft and a head you can buy a them already assembled but usually they are pretty shitty however they are usually cheaper. A good shaft id recommend is the Epoch DragonFly c30, its really light and grippy, also flexes when you shoot to give you more power. Another good shaft is the Warrior Krypto Pro this shaft is also very light and popular with starting players. For the head I can recommend a couple: Nike Lakota (Personal favorite) Brine Clutch, Warrior Evo, and STX Proton Power.   *Helmet: For a helmet Id recommend the Cascade Pro 7 or the Cascade CPX-R you'll look dope in both however they do get pricey so if your looking for a cheaper helmet look at some of Cascades other models.  *Shouder Pads: These are up to you I know guys that like shoulder pads that cover alot of their body and guys who like shoulder pads that barely cover their chest. you choose how much protection you want just keep in mind the more protection you have the harder it will be to move freely. Personally I like the Warrior Burn, its a nice medium between too much protection and not enough   *Armguards: These are alot like the shoulder pads in the sense that you choose how much protection you want. Typically the defense has the smallest arm guards cause they dont take too many hits. Middies typically have everything from extremly short to long its a personal preference. Attack usually have the longest armguards because they take alot of hits. I like the STX Cell 3's because I play attack and they cover alot of my arm yet they are still very easy to move in.   *Gloves: All gloves should give you a good amount of protection. Some of my favorites have been: Brine King 5's, Brine King Superlights, and Maverkick Romes  *Cleats: Anything will do again this is a personal preference. Pretty much any Warrior Cleats are good.   How To Practice hit the wall nothing more annoying than a new guy who cant pass or catch, your teammates and coaches probably wont be too upset if your throwing and catching isnt perfect because your new but its the fundamentals of the game you cannot get good at anything else until you can pass and catch. Hit the wall everyday whenever u can there are alot of wallball workouts you can lookup on youtube.   Thats all I got for you, good luck in ur season man"

lacrosse,2ztrla,A_Crazy_Hooligan,3,Sun Mar 22 12:36:56 2015 UTC,Watch lacrosse. Watch what the midfielders do. It's fun to watch and doubles and a learning device. Watch where they stand in relation to the goal. What draws a penalty and how easily they're drawn. How they substitute. And read a rulebook. That will help you loads.
lacrosse,2ztrla,MattHand13,1 point,Sun Mar 22 01:52:28 2015 UTC,ok sounds like a plan
lacrosse,2ztrla,MattHand13,2,Sun Mar 22 12:41:13 2015 UTC,"Wait for the end of the lacrosse season to buy your equipment. I know that Lax.com and Lacrosse.com have huge end of the season deals which can save you tons of money. When the STX Proton Power came out, it was around 80-100 dollars, but I got that on sale for $50, and I also got the STX sabre for $40 (normally around 80 dollars). I'd sign up for their online newsletter because it tells you immediately when the sales start.   TL;DR: Wait until the end of the lacrosse season to buy a stick because you'll save around $60"
lacrosse,2ztrla,YourNotAngryNeighbor,1 point,Sun Mar 22 19:37:09 2015 UTC,So roughly around when does the season end
lacrosse,2ztrla,Ryan21G,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:14:24 2015 UTC,"Last year, the NCAA D1 season ended in late may, so that's when the sales start. If you want to wait and save money for a good stick, then by all means do so, and if not, it's whatever."
lacrosse,2zt98w,Aierus,5,Sat Mar 21 15:34:15 2015 UTC,At your age I'm surprised a cpv still fits. Most kids grow out of those pretty rapidly. Step into an r. It's an investment but you'll have it for your entire hs career and you'll have a helmet for winter and summer leagues
lacrosse,2zt98w,msupz,8,Sat Mar 21 16:09:46 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I have an R, and it is insanely comfortable, though a bit snug. I've also used a CPX-r and would also recommend it. If you only have a cpv, then I highly suggest getting the new helmet."
lacrosse,2zt98w,brinkley26,3,Sat Mar 21 15:40:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, get a new helmet"
lacrosse,2zt98w,griffindor11,3,Sat Mar 21 15:45:14 2015 UTC,I would recommend the R. If you are going to play for the next few years it would be worth it. It's a little bit bigger than the Cpxr as well
lacrosse,2zt98w,Mdaug,1 point,Sat Mar 21 18:14:58 2015 UTC,A cpv is fine as long as it fits. Cpvs come in different sizes unlike Rs and CPX-Rs. Spend your money on your stick and then gloves. Worry about the helmet when you make varsity.

lacrosse,2zs1p7,cael008,6,Sat Mar 21 04:43:50 2015 UTC,"It really depends on where you are, the CUFLA league based in Ontario and Quebec has been steadily growing and becoming very competitive. Lots of talent in CUFLA, pro NLL players, NCAA guys who've come home, Jr. A and Jr. B talent. It's been a few years since I played in the league but typically Guelph, Brock, Western, McGill, Bishop's are strong programs. With those you typically get a couple other teams with talent from year to year.   I don't know much about teams outside of CUFLA, but I know there are some teams our west in BC, Simon Fraser being most notable. As well there's a Maritime league as well.  Not sure if this info helps or is just more general stuff, but like I said it's been a few years since I was immersed in the league. If it's something you are interested in I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it."
lacrosse,2zs1p7,Guurtz,3,Sat Mar 21 11:39:43 2015 UTC,"Everything you said was spot on. The league (CUFLA) grows better every year as it gets more and more attention. I played in it for 3 years (this past November was my last year) and  am surprised how even low level teams such as Laurentien or Trent have improved even over the course of 1 year. I find it being a faster paced game comparatively as I also played for a Div. II school in the states for 2 years, but its also a different game due to the different rules. If you are a first timer OP I will admit you have your work cut out for you as the skill level is always increasing but don't let that stop you form trying! Good luck and have fun out there!"
lacrosse,2zs1p7,rusty_buttplug42,1 point,Sat Mar 21 18:59:51 2015 UTC,"Everything those guys said about out east is spot on, so I'll touch on out west here. We have teams, and there is talent on those teams, however we are still in our infancy stages so the sport isn't taken that seriously. We have Jr. A guys, Sr. B guys, and the odd ex-pro on our teams, but we are more out there for the fun and beers afterwards than anything else.   With the exception of Simon Fraser, who play MCLA in the states IIRC (can someone confirm that?). Simon Fraser is the most serious and competitive about it. Anyway, confirmed schools that have active programs out west are UofC, UofA, & UofL in Alberta, and in BC these guys were active but I haven't seen anything about them lately: UBC, UBCO, & UVic. UofS was supposed to have something goin too, but I'm not 100% sure there. Get in contact with those schools student societies before choosing to go there and they can get in contact with the lacrosse club representative.   I'm also in charge of a new lacrosse program at SAIT if you don't want to go to a full fledge university. We play all those teams still so the lacrosse is no different. As I said before, the university field here is all for fun, we take our box in the summer time far more seriously."

It's a much smaller league, with Mount Allison, Dalhousie, SMU, Acadia, St. FX, and UNB (as of this year). A number of these teams are club rather than varsity, like Acadia, Mt A, and UNB just because of the size of the teams, and the strongest teams tend to be Dal and St. FX. I've yet to hear of any ex-pros, but there's plenty of Jr. A/Jr. B experience all around."

Like good positioning, call outs I should be making, behavior, and stuff to avoid."
lacrosse,2znbou,msupz,15,Fri Mar 20 00:43:27 2015 UTC,"Playing D mid is a lot like playing basketball defense in the way you want to move your feet and have hands on the hips pushing out when the offensive player is dodging. For positioning try and make sure that when the ball is behind you come down into the crease and help your teammates. On ball, force players down the allies and drive on their hips to force them wide. For talking, yell ball when you are on ball, left and right when adjacent and two, when you are the second slide helping down on the backside. Avoid chasing people with your stick, and even if you get beat stay on your man and try and lift their back hand or get a trail check in as they wind up to shoot."

lacrosse,2znbou,MAD2369,7,Fri Mar 20 01:08:06 2015 UTC,I coach freshman and JV lacrosse. How do I encourage my boys to be more aggressive with stick checks and body checks? Last year my team was soft and I want to teach them its ok to hit and play aggressively. Anything you remember standing out?
lacrosse,2znbou,Spitfire6532,18,Fri Mar 20 00:47:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, at the JV level, stick checks are the last thing you need to be teaching. At most your poles should approach their man with their head aiming for the bottom and and just lightly poke and lift, maybe a slap every now and again. Too many younger players go out of control trying to take the ball away and get beat as a result. Tell your players to be assertive, ie being loud in their talk, get out on their man, but just apply light pressure, often times at a JV level that will be enough to cause a bad pass. As for physical contact, teach kids how to properly box out on ground balls and on defense teach sliding to the man, and finish your slide by making contact with the offensive player, always aiming for the hips or numbers. One drill I used to do growing up was a ground ball drill where you put 4 guys in a circle, two teams of two. Have them all line up back and squat down in a defensive stance. Then just drop the ball in the middle and let them scrap for it. Its not the best drill for simulating a ground ball, but it does promote physical play to win the ball and talking to a teammate in a ground ball situation."
lacrosse,2znbou,mvcvluso,6,Fri Mar 20 01:07:01 2015 UTC,"Best advice for new defensemen right here. You said it brotha, job isn't to take the ball away, just prevent a shot or make offense make a mistake. Too many young guys think playing defense is about being slick and having the best stick checks. Best defense men I've seen pester the carrier just enough to make them pass or make a stupid dodge."
lacrosse,2znbou,mvcvluso,1 point,Fri Mar 20 03:26:22 2015 UTC,"I'm an official, and this is great advice.  When I see a JV team being dominated it's because of defensemen going for big takeaway checks instead of being in the right place."

Free time is still there, obviously not as much as non athletes but if you budget you time well, you can still have plenty of time to yourself and friends. In the off season I would say you just have a bit more free time because you spend less time on the field and you don't have things like film as often."

lacrosse,2znbou,Eudaemon9,3,Fri Mar 20 02:30:49 2015 UTC,"mmmm, i would argue time commitment is roughly the same, atleast where I went, Idk what your schedule is like but we had 5 or 6 2 hour practices a week and a game, with team lifting and running 3 times a week, + whatever else you wanted to do.   even ""speed"" if you want to put it as just speed is the same. d1 kids who transferred in all said it was roughly the same, and the d1 guys i play box with and against aren't much faster. Idk how hard kids were trying in the north south game last year, but I couldnt really tell who was from where.  I will say that consistency and depth would be the biggest difference.  Idk how many times i wanted to cry watching some of our d guys or even our middies try to clear the ball and just miss a pass right in the stick. or just wiffing on a ground ball. so many dumb turnovers, it is not surprising seeing 15 unforced turnovers in a game, simply from stick skills.  where d1 kids who simply cant catch balls and miss the easiest things, just simply wont play, and fall down the depth chart d2 teams sometimes have no choice.  Idk, just some opinions, good luck the rest of the year."

lacrosse,2znbou,Jurrrmeh,1 point,Fri Mar 20 03:41:09 2015 UTC,"It depends on what type of defense you are in. Most of the time the crease guy will be the slide guy from X, but some teams also do a coma slide which could be you. Most important is to talk, if you feel you have to go get ball because no one else is and he is a threat to score, try to tell your other defender to pick up your man as you slide to the ball. The worst thing that can happen is no one picks up ball and he scores but ideally you want to have someone go to ball and another person pick up your man who would be the 2 slide."

lacrosse,2znbou,shdlax75,1 point,Fri Mar 20 12:57:15 2015 UTC,"In my experience in being an assistant in NCAA and being an assistant and playing in the MCLA, high level (top 10) MCLA D1 schools are quite good. Maybe even comparable to top 20 NCAA D2/3 teams. High end (again top 10) MCLA D2 schools can usually compete with the lower end of the top 20 and definitely compete with the teams just outside the top 20 specifically in D3 as this is where I am at now.   I will say that the commitment is different. I am not saying that one is better than the other or that one is more strenuous than the other. This is more apparent if you end up playing outside of a top MCLA team. Truthfully, picking the right school is the most important thing you can do regardless of the program.

It's kind of dripping down to high school level  at least in my area where certain 3rd thru 8th grade club teams are feeding into different highschools. Also at my school we had 10 underclassmen make varsity, ahead of many juniors (including me, RIP) and a couple seniors and now our JV program is probably extremely worse off. Do you think this is a consequence of coaches getting more antsy? Or one outlier?   How would you go about building team unity when you have uncaring teammates (without saying team bonding exercises/being buddy buddy with everyone)? What if your teammates don't like you or care what you say?"
lacrosse,2znbou,jakethefakejake,1 point,Fri Mar 20 21:41:51 2015 UTC,"I think that early recruitment can hurt both players and colleges because the players lose some drive to play their best when they are already recruited and the colleges are worse off because they aren't getting the kids that they thought they were because they didn't continue to improve after they were committed. Personally I didn't commit until late in high school, so I had to keep playing hard in every big game, knowing that colleges would still be looking and judging me on my performance. As far as building team unity or getting other kids to ""like"" you, the first thing you can always do before they like you is earn their respect. Go out every day in practice and in games and work harder than anyone else, become a starter and beat the crap out of every team you play. People will notice and follow suit."

lacrosse,2zot6f,BaconBob,3,Fri Mar 20 13:38:57 2015 UTC,I just stretch with my team and then always make sure to make sure my shoulder is stretched out
lacrosse,2zot6f,laxgirl34,3,Fri Mar 20 17:22:11 2015 UTC,"I don't know that lacrosse goalies need any different stretching than anyone else on the field unless you're a ""leggy"" goalie that incorporates a lot of leg saves. If so, then put a bit more focus on your hips and groin, but really everyone out there should be doing that.   There's constant ongoing debate between static vs dynamic stretching. I'm a hockey goaltender by trade so I was big into static stretching, but I'd also move into dynamic stretching after my statics, so I guess my answer is ""why not both?"""
lacrosse,2zot6f,notnicholas,2,Fri Mar 20 17:32:54 2015 UTC,"I've never been a fan of static stretches, no matter how you're moving in a sport you want to ease into getting your body ready. My stretch routine is always a mimic of how I'll play, i.e. working myself through the points on my arc, windmill the stick around, anything I'd be doing in a game. Start soft, finish full speed with some slight exaggeration so you can stretch things out a bit.   Even if you're not on board with that plan, work your groin like BaconBob suggested. It's a vulnerable part of your body when you're trying to recover from a save, cutting back to the other net, etc"
lacrosse,2zot6f,sydtron,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:18:14 2015 UTC,"I agree with this for the most part but I am a huge fan of static stretching post workout/practice. Most people think of a stretch as that big pulling sensation we feel but that is a little to much of a stretch, especially when cold."

But it really came down for me and most of my team mates that it was the commitment you wanted it to be and by my last year we had a solid group of guys that showed up every practice and were always pumped to play. It all comes down to you get what you put into. I would say go for it try out, if you make it you can figure out from there if you can keep doing it, we always said that if someone had class they didn't have to show up for practice.

lacrosse,2zmypp,justaphase88,1 point,Thu Mar 19 23:43:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly I came from the exact same situation as you're in. And my first year in college I came onto the club team thinking I was gonna be fine but it was a shock to me very different than high school kids way better than me. But I should up to every try out and hustled my ass off every try out and actually got selected onto the team over some kids who were probably better than me. And I got better as college went on, the club team I was on had board members and I actually became a director my junior and senior year. And I know that for me showing up at the try outs and pushing harder and volunteering for everything is what helped get me on the team. So go out there and try out, but don't think you're not good enough just give it your all because there most likely will be some better than you (that's true for pretty much everyone) but you put in the practice and you'll be all good."

I was just jogging up the hill through my campus at UCONN from the dining hall to my dorm thinking about how it reminded me of the February pre-season training when I played in high school, and I was thinking about possibly joining the club team in the fall.  Someone else said your due's are 2k+ a semester, and I am pretty sure that's what mine is in as well, so we are probably in at least similar boats here.  There is a guy on my floor who joined the team this fall, and he does have practice a lot, so it seems like it would be probably around 1/4 to 1/3, maybe even 1/2 of your free time dedicated to either the sport or sport-related activities. I don't know about you, but I have a lot of free time already, so it would probably be do-able without being too much to bear, but you come here asking advice when you know it will be a commitment regardless of if your college is rigorous or small, because in the end you know have a team that you need to dedicate yourself to, above maybe even yourself and your immediate wants."

lacrosse,2zmypp,nuttugger,3,Fri Mar 20 15:05:07 2015 UTC,"I had that figured out. I was very surprised by the score, to be honest, because SCSU only lost to UCONN 7-4 in the fall but was missing their entire starting D for that game. Good luck tonight vs Indiana and tomorrow vs BC"

If I'm not mistaken,  I believe Pitt and CMU students can play club sports at either school and I'd be willing to bet the CMU team is much less competitive. Just something you might want to consider and look into!"
lacrosse,2zmypp,easy_17,2,Fri Mar 20 01:53:38 2015 UTC,I doubt that is the case. The MCLA requires you to be a full time student at that institution in order to be eligible to play.
lacrosse,2zmypp,atwoforfundeal,1 point,Fri Mar 20 15:18:43 2015 UTC,"I played at Pitt so I can give you some insight here.  Playing is a fairly big time commitment, with 2-3 practices per week and games a few weekends in the fall, then 4 practices a week and games almost every weekend in the spring.  MCLA lacrosse is pretty varied in the quality of play - the teams at the top have some great players and are very organized, but the teams at the bottom can be pretty bad. For the time being, Pitt is comfortably in the middle.  That being said, the team is pretty competitive and practices are fast-paced. Dues tended to be around $1500, not including helmets and gloves.  With that being said, it's totally possible to balance playing with school. We had guys on the team in engineering, pre-med, you name it, and if anything, having practices and games to schedule around forced them to stay on top of their school work.  Older teammates in the same major are also a great resource for help with your work.   School stuff aside, playing lacrosse was one of my best college experiences. We made a couple runs in our conference tourney and got an invite to nationals one year.  Club ball is what you make of it.  If you're on the fence, get in contact with the coaches and the club president, go try it out in the fall, and see if it's right for you. Let me know if I can help you out with anything."

lacrosse,2znljs,dj_bpayne,5,Sun Mar 22 00:57:48 2015 UTC,My face off guys love soft mesh. Sometimes they use ecd or throne though since we get rain like every 3 days down here. It helps when you scoop after a good draw but the soft mesh can bag out horribly in weather
lacrosse,2znljs,mongo1834,2,Fri Mar 20 03:44:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been a fogo for 2, almost three years now and I use a tribe 7 ghost 7 with jimalax soft mesh and it holds the ball well for a pinch and pop (high school) but also is very effective on GBs. It always flips back right side out no problem."
lacrosse,2znljs,WornKey,2,Fri Mar 20 15:08:35 2015 UTC,"Softer mesh, but still use something that you feel comfortable playing with."

lacrosse,2znljs,Falcon25,2,Fri Mar 20 13:29:55 2015 UTC,I used to have some rubber coated soft mesh that I loved but I can't seem to find anywhere but if you can I would say that's a fairly good idea.

lacrosse,2znljs,EastSaintBoogieMan,1 point,Sat Mar 28 20:27:06 2015 UTC,"Not a mesh type but I have this idea for faceoff stringing.  When stringing, mesh has two sides, a grippier side and a smoother side.  The grippy one goes on the outside but for a fogo, putting the grip side facing out of the head might work nice.  Edit: I mean the grippy side is normally on the inside but y'all know what I meant"

lacrosse,2zl8h0,theanuranking,3,Thu Mar 19 16:39:05 2015 UTC,Get good at ground balls
lacrosse,2zl8h0,dpaul1997,2,Thu Mar 19 19:57:32 2015 UTC,I think it would help a lot if we knew what position you were coming from so we could tailor the advice in terms of what you know.

lacrosse,2zl8h0,Speed_Peanut,2,Thu Mar 19 16:00:09 2015 UTC,"Don't overextend. If you switched from middie, you'll be more inclined to chase your man as far back as you can. Don't. Do not let him lure you or draw you out too far. That's how you get beat."
lacrosse,2zl8h0,ProfaneTank,1 point,Thu Mar 19 16:00:24 2015 UTC,"Take advantage of the fact that midfielders are going to be scared of you. When you're playing close D, the attackmen are used to being beaten up by long poles, but middies will try to either avoid you or make you look stupid with a juke. Just hold your ground and harass the ball, because more than often they'll keep it and try to get away from you, which usually ends up as a GB for you. Good luck"
lacrosse,2zl8h0,tgibson28,1 point,Thu Mar 19 17:18:41 2015 UTC,"Thank you everyone for the advice.  Im actually coming from attack, but I had experience with middie. I can run alot so thats not a problem"
lacrosse,2zl8h0,m_perron,-2,Thu Mar 19 19:14:29 2015 UTC,"Well, first and foremost, if you end up not liking it get your coach to send you back to regular D because I know a couple of guys that couldn't stand it and their play suffered because of it.  But, I've found that middies are more inclined to take running starts that are abnormally long for dodges. Make them come to you when they do that don't follow them out, and if he is cradling with two hands when he comes at you, send your stick into the top of his abdomen, it's like midfielder kryptonite.  He won't dodge on you again, I promise"
lacrosse,2zl8h0,OG_Nightfox,3,Thu Mar 19 15:18:12 2015 UTC,Why would you let him get a running start at you while you are standing still? He is going to run right through any checks. Playing defense whether its short stick or long stick you have to maintain and close a gap between you and your man. Its easier to do so when you are closer to him.
lacrosse,2zl8h0,m_perron,-4,Thu Mar 19 15:28:39 2015 UTC,"Athletic stance, quiet with a solid poke, probably backpedaling, I've never been beat like ever so I think there is something to it"
lacrosse,2zl8h0,OG_Nightfox,5,Thu Mar 19 15:37:42 2015 UTC,"You've never been beat? Like ever? That's comedic. If you try and let a midfielder dodge on you with a 10-15 yard running start in the NCAA you are gonna get burned every single time. Even with a poke, a 180 pound athlete is going to run through that check every single time unless you strip him, which is unlikely. Its basic defense.   Are you going to be able to keep up with someone easier if you start hip to hip with them or if you start in a backpedal from a dead stop?"
lacrosse,2zl8h0,shdlax75,1 point,Thu Mar 19 17:19:00 2015 UTC,"no you definitely follow them out, they're gonna make you look stupid if you're waiting at the box for a guy dodging from the 40"

I know there are some Stevenson/Union/Gettysberg/Amherst believers out there, and maybe you could put them on a 2nd tier. But I'm not buying it, none of them have beat any top tier teams. Stevenson's lost to both RIT & Tufts, Gettysburg hasn't played anyone yet, Union has three one goal wins over middle of the road programs and won't play anyone until 4/15 when they face RIT. Amherst's handling of Endicott was impressive but they won't really be tested until RIT on 4/18. There's a good chance they and Gettysburg both go into their RIT games undefeated.  It's a year of parity, you'd better sew up your conference's AQ, 'cause the At-Large berths are going to be screwy and unpredictable."

So vulnerable that in box you aren't even aloud to hit anyone during a loose ball situation. You can ""push"" a guy off of a loose ball in the same what you box out in basketball, but that's it.   The buddy pass is a rule in NCAA I think? We have always called that a suicide pass up north here, and the call is dependent on when you hit the guy. If he has just turned his head/body and you smoke him middle chest, it's clean. If he is running backwards still and you hit him anywhere else it would probably be called a ""hit from behind"" which is 10min and a game misconduct. The rules are called more flexibly the older you get. So a 14 year old in bantam would not get as much wiggle room on that call as a 20 year old Jr. A player. We put the onus on teammates not to put your friend in that position.   Blind side hit, well that falls under the big hit from behind as well. If you hit a player who couldn't see you coming and therefore was not able to brace or prepare for the hit in any way, it's a 95% chance that's a hot from behind. Ref has some discretion here in box however, if you thought the guy you were going to hit was going to turn and he didn't, AND you slowed down the hit significantly at the last second but still hit him a little, then maybe you will just get one of either roughing, boarding, or cross checking penalties against you (2 min minor).   Late goalie hits, well if the hit would otherwise have been legal then it's fair game. Goalies don't get special treatment when they step out of the crease up north, and we follow through with our hits no matter what. Although goalies are pretty dam hard to hit when they have over 50lbs of extra equipment on them, haha.   We also have charging penalties, where if you take like 5 steps and run at a guy full sprint, only with the intent of hitting this guy as hard as possible, that is a penalty.   Box is a very aggressive game, but I have very rarely seen any serious injuries. Maybe a few rolled ankle and just last week a cracked rib (from an illegal hit btw). I think we have a great set of rules here in Canada that, when implemented correctly by a good ref, does a great job of protecting the players and the ref on the floor. And I have never heard a field player watch a game of box and say ""wow, can't believe they pussied down the game so much,"" haha.  This is a good rule implementation by highschools, however I think the wording isn't perfect, but if it works for them then I see no problem."
lacrosse,2zgr14,henerydods,2,Wed Mar 18 19:54:25 2015 UTC,"The buddy pass is NOT in the NCAA rulebook as far as I'm aware.  I expect that to change. Your clean hit with the player's head turned is a defenseless player in high school field.  That only applies when they are looking back for the pass. Your goalies could get hit with a sledgehammer and not feel it... There used to be a ""charging"" penalty.  The language got scrapped and now those sort of hits are classified as illegal body check or unnecessary roughness... either works. Completely agree with the theme of this post.  This rule will not take the physicality out of the sport.  What it does is eliminate instances of high risk."
lacrosse,2zgr14,mrepik9000,2,Thu Mar 19 01:13:41 2015 UTC,"In my game yesterday (I play D),we were in a clear situation while running clock, and I chucked it across midfield towards one of my attackmen. It hit the ground just in front of him and bounced high, and his defender hit him in the back while my guy was in the air. No foul was called, and my teammate may have a mild concussion. It wasn't a great ref, so was it a bad non call, or was it legal?"
lacrosse,2zgr14,alienator064,1 point,Wed Mar 18 23:58:06 2015 UTC,"ART. 2 . . . Body-checking of an opponent from the rear or at or below the waist.  ART. 5 . . .  (iii) body checking a player whose head is turned away to receive a pass, even if that player turns toward the contact immediately before the body check.   Should have been called."
lacrosse,2zgr14,justinponeill,1 point,Thu Mar 19 00:17:30 2015 UTC,"So /u/alienator064 is only half right. Yes, that was a foul.  I would not have called it an illegal body check.. Well, let me rephrase that.  I probably would not have called it an illegal body check.  That denotes a certain amount of violence.  This sounds like a simple push.  Rule 6-9-1   A player shall not thrust or shove an opponent from the rear. A push is exerting pressure after contact is made and is not a violent blow. Pushing is permitted from the front or side when an opponent has possession of the ball or is within 5 yards of a loose ball. In this case, pushing shall be done with either closed hand, shoulder or forearm, and both hands shall be on the crosse.    So what separates a push from an illegal body check? Essentially the violence of it.  From your description, it's hard to tell that part.  And since it was your teammate, your bias is probably going to be that it was more severe than it was.   That is not saying that there is no chance it was violent and therefore an illegal body check.  In my experience, this is usually a push.  Since it is a loose-ball technical foul, there would be no time served and your team would get possession at the spot of the foul."
lacrosse,2zgr14,Spitfire6532,2,Thu Mar 19 01:07:35 2015 UTC,Did checks to the head turn into 2 minute unreleasable penalties? I haven't seen this up until this season.
lacrosse,2zgr14,blu333,2,Thu Mar 19 01:36:44 2015 UTC,"Rule 5.4.1-3   ART. 1 . . . A player shall not initiate contact to an opponent's head or neck with a cross-check, or with any part of his body (head, elbow, shoulder, etc.). Any follow-through that contacts the head or neck shall also be considered a violation of this rule.  ART. 2 . . . A player shall not initiate an excessive, violent or uncontrolled slash to the head/neck.  ART. 3 . . . A player, including an offensive player in possession of the ball, shall not block an opponent with the head or initiate contact with the head (known as spearing).  PENALTY: Two- or three-minute non-releasable foul, at the official’s discretion. An excessively violent violation of this rule may result in an ejection.   This is not a brand new thing.  I believe it was new as of '13, but I could be remembering incorrectly.  If the official says that it is contact to the head/neck, it HAS to be 2 or 3 minute unreleasable.  It's why you won't hear an official say ""you slashed him in the head,"" cause then it would fall into this category."
lacrosse,2zgr14,LoganShogun,2,Thu Mar 19 01:51:21 2015 UTC,Question about something that happened to me. I was about to put a legal body check on a kid fighting for a ground ball. I was pretty much approaching him with a full head of steam when he ducked and took my legs out from under me. No foul was called but would this be a foul on either one of us.?
lacrosse,2zgr14,WCDLAX,2,Thu Mar 19 22:35:49 2015 UTC,"Both of you COULD have been called for ""Unnecessary Roughness""  Rule 5.9.3   Any avoidable act on the part of a player that is deliberate and ­excessively violent, whether it be with the body or crosse. This may include a legal body check.   One of those ""all powerful official"" rules.  It would depend on how violent the act was.  I could see letting it go if you were really charging at him.  Would really also depend on the game and what's going on.  Sorry for the vague answer.  Neither act is explicitly forbidden, but if the act is particularly violent you could get tagged with this."

You do look like like a crazy person holding a pool skimmer in between the pipes at least.  I can argue for cutting down a D handle if you're tall, but you're really just mating a proper handle to your build.

lacrosse,2zfh0e,Bulking_at_Mcdonalds,29,Wed Mar 18 03:16:34 2015 UTC,"This is something I actually address with the teams I coach. It's presence of mind. You get the ball and all of a sudden you have no idea what to do. You don't want to disappoint your teammates or the people rooting for you to the point it stops you from playing and makes what you don't want to happen, become a reality. Two things I will stress that will only work through time and patience like most things. First, know what you came there to do. You're not on the field because of you friends or your family or some girl. You're there because of you. Because you want to put all that practice to good use, you want to do what you love. Stop viewing the games as a stressor, but instead they are the fun in lacrosse. If you practice incredibly hard all week, all off season, all your life, you'll play that way. Think about this, if you have a big test coming up do you study? Of course because you want to do well. I'm in no way criticizing you or your character, but practice harder, practice more. The issue you're having is ultimately one of lack of confidence. The reason you keep practicing is not just to get good mechanics and footwork, but to prepare your mind for any opponent. There is always an opponent and at that moment, he's on the field, he's with you, his name is doubt. You doubt you will be able to perform and then surely you don't. You have to believe in yourself. Believe you will be the best player on the field, and never stop practicing. You'll be a great player, just believe in yourself and keep working your ass off. Hope this was any help."
lacrosse,2zfh0e,entex92,1 point,Wed Mar 18 04:03:09 2015 UTC,"This comment really hit it on the head. I also coach kids and I cannot emphasize confidence enough. If you don't believe in yourself to have the skills to complete a play then you will never have an impact on the field.  Before every game I have my team get a break on confidence, reminding them that they need believe in themselves. They should because they've been taught how to win the game, they just need to utilize that knowledge."

lacrosse,2zf2ev,OG_Nightfox,1 point,Wed Mar 18 02:27:52 2015 UTC,"Both of these are difficult areas to teach as a lot of it comes with practice. Tactical and positional awareness are very natural talents.   However with not setting up a play I usually give them a shot clock time of 30 secs to move the ball around and set a play up. keeps them on their toes especially if you make it a competition.   Off the ball movement is tricky, have you tried teaching a motion offence, two triangles. The constant movement will start to help them remember to keep moving.   Hope this helps atleast a bit, sorry I am not more helpful but I am knackered and just got in from work."
lacrosse,2zf2ev,LaxyDan,1 point,Wed Mar 18 02:32:20 2015 UTC,"As much as your players may hate you, give them incentive to do off ball movement, get play going and have them start their rotations and such and if they stand there and ball watch, run a suicide. single whistle = play start/stop, double whistle = suicide. I know when my college coach started doing that, everyone got off ball movement real quick because suicides suck.  Also a really simple formation to run to get off ball rotation down is a (from the top) 2-3-1 with a Middie on crease. When an attackman passes the ball up top to a Middie, attack rotates across crease, and vice versa, Middie passes to attack, they rotate. The formation is 2 rotating triangles, super simple yet effective."
lacrosse,2zf2ev,laxbeast26,1 point,Wed Mar 18 07:14:21 2015 UTC,"Best advice is to use dodging/shooting drills that incorporate actual game situations.  For instance, set up the Hopkins Up and Over drill: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPpFcuFDLl0  The coaching points to emphasize are: 1) Although there are no defenders, first dodge has to be 100% full speed 2) Quick movement on the second pass 3) Third man: Quick split dodge down the alley and finish on the run  If you run a 2-3-1, the Up and Over replicates a situation the players are very likely to see in the game (e.g. attackman dodges on the wing, feeds up to a middie who passes over to opposite side middie, who dodges down the alley). By getting reps in practice that resemble game situations, the player swill feel more confident doing the same thing against an actual opponent.  Off-ball movement needs to be constantly preached and incorporated into drills like the one above. Also, laxbeast is right, threaten them with running if nothing else works."
lacrosse,2zf2ev,theloserlaterwins,0,Wed Mar 18 22:43:10 2015 UTC,"For off ball movement, every time a player passes the ball to another player, he must set a pick for the player he passed to (and potentially slip the pick), or he must cut to open space looking to get the ball back. This teaches players to be most active after moving the ball as apposed to being stagnant. It will also encourage more off ball movement from players in general."

lacrosse,2zf3c4,czscout,2,Wed Mar 18 12:01:53 2015 UTC,"I guess it just depends on how you feel a new head will affect your game. If you feel comfortable with your old head, then that's fine, but if you really like the new head that's good too. If you are really looking for something different I would try a restring first. Having a high pocket in a defensive/lsm head can seriously help with gb's."

Picked up some stringking mesh and hit up ustring and strung up my stick just the way I like it. Don't lock yourself on one head and stringjob when you could like another setup much more. and make sure if you're trying someone elses setup don't just take a few throws, use it for 5-10 minutes so you can get used to how it throws, catches, and really experience it."

I love how light weight it is and it also has just as much grip as the swizzbeat. If not this I would definitely just get the same one you have.
lacrosse,2zczqo,Pizza_Box,1 point,Wed Mar 18 00:59:11 2015 UTC,"I had a Stallion Sc-Ti for the past year or so and it was surprisingly prone to small little dents. It cracked during practice in the fall, so I was pretty disappointed considering the price tag on it. I went for a cheaper alternative and got an ECD Carbon for about $100. I've used it for a couple months now and I really like it. It's incredibly light and so far very durable. It also has a nice coating on it, giving it a good feel in your hands. It also flexes if you shoot with enough power, similar to the Alliance, although it won't flex unless you take a rip so it doesn't make passing feel weird or anything .I'd definitely recommend it for attack/mid.  Also, the Surgeon Sc-Ti is cheaper and lighter than the stallion, but apparently even less durable. I have a friend who broke 2 in the first week of practice, so be careful if you're considering one."

lacrosse,2zalkb,NoMoreOreos,3,Tue Mar 17 00:05:26 2015 UTC,"First thing to remember with calls is to be loud and clear. Usually goalies tend to call where the ball is.   Top left, Top right, right, left, and X.   Make sure you are calling the defense into action. If you are going man or zonal, make sure everyone knows and everyone is in the right place.   This is a really basic call set it does get more advanced the more you play."
lacrosse,2zalkb,LaxyDan,2,Tue Mar 17 00:36:03 2015 UTC,"Make sure you are reminding middies when they are the first (Hot) slide and D when it is a coma slide. People tend to forget, remind them even if they know."
lacrosse,2zalkb,triplemike3,2,Tue Mar 17 01:08:42 2015 UTC,"Be loud, call who has the ball, and it'd help to have a good clear. A lot of high school goalies these days can't clear for shit."
lacrosse,2zalkb,Redditisquiteamazing,1 point,Tue Mar 17 12:31:05 2015 UTC,When the attack dodges from x let ur defender know when they approach GLE. Also call push when they get to close for comfort
lacrosse,2zalkb,jdfoster99,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:30:57 2015 UTC,"Definitely call out ball position, yell alot of ""whos 1, whos 2"" you can also say ""whos hot"" instead of ""whos 1"" if you need a slide and a man got beat yell fire. Also do normal calls such as ball down."
lacrosse,2zalkb,TestTubeInMyPocket,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:52:32 2015 UTC,"be able to make slide calls. if the ball is on the left you need to be telling the defender on crease that he needs to move to the ball if the left pole gets beat, and that the defender on the right ""is the 2,"" meaning he fills the man on creases position"
lacrosse,2zalkb,BreadsMeow,1 point,Tue Mar 17 01:57:33 2015 UTC,"Allow me to dive in here:   First, as a goalie I try to keep the questions to a minimum. So instead of ""who's hot?"" and ""who's 2?"" I tell which defender is which. This takes all of the confusion about who is supposed to slide and/or when to slide. In practice get to know your teammates and how they play (who is fast, who is slow, etc) So if I have a slow defender who is 'hot' I call for the slide as soon as I see a dodger beating the first defender.   Ofcourse you need to call out ball placement, but you also need to have your head on a swivel and be able to talk to your defenders and communicate what is happening. If someone is cutting or an attackman is trying to be sly behind 'x' I just tell the defender by name what is happening. example: 'dave there is a guy on your back left'. No need to yell if he is a close defender and you're in a zone defense.   Also, I tell my guys that any goal whether it be game or practice is never one player's fault. Once we agree that we are all at fault the better we communicate, the better we play, and the more we improve."
lacrosse,2zalkb,WarrenJV,1 point,Tue Mar 17 04:20:32 2015 UTC,"Call ball position and avoid questions. Rather than asking who has who and who is hot and two, tell them. You are the leader, you should know who should be doing what. If they can't figure it out, tell them. Telling them is quicker than asking a question and waiting or hoping for a response. It is the best thing playing defense for a goalie that is vocal."
lacrosse,2zalkb,Pelreskovich,1 point,Tue Mar 17 12:20:15 2015 UTC,"If you have an uncovered man on the crease make sure to call out, ""Crease!"" Make sure to be looking out for cutters and call out slides.   Tips: BE REALLY LOUD, Say everything at least twice, never stop talking. If you're taking more than a five second break between calls, you need to be yelling out more ball position and checking who's hot."
lacrosse,2zalkb,iahdubs,1 point,Wed Mar 18 01:37:06 2015 UTC,"So you can see the WHOLE field, which gives you time to plan for different situations. I think it goes without saying that you should KNOW WHERE THE BALL IS AT ALL TIMES. And like others have said, you can call out where the ball is, as well as if you hear the defense calling a play ""watch the play"". Don't be afraid of the ball. Remember to step UP to the ball. Get as comfortable as you can with top corner shots on your weak side. Get comfortable with making clears and communicating with the mids (you need to be LOUD) so they know who you're clearing to."
lacrosse,2zalkb,laxaroundtheworld,1 point,Wed Mar 18 15:36:04 2015 UTC,"A lot of good points about being vocal which is probably 50% of goalie work if not more. You are the quarter back of the team.   Some good calls to know are ""GLE"" (Goal Line Extended) which is an imaginary line extending from the cage pipes to the sidelines. A synonymous call would be ""Turn him around"" both of these calls let the defender know he is approaching the front of the cage and he should physically move him away from the cage on his hip.   Another good one is ""Funnel down the alley,"" letting midfielders know that they need to take a good angle inside of their player and force them out of the middle of the field as they run down towards the cage.  Just keep your defenders aware, and hopefully they will talk back to you. All skillful teams are basically having a conversation on the field going from goalie to defensemen where the goalie lets them know what is going on and the defensemen confirm it with their calls. If you get to that level of communication you will be working as a unit and you will have a stellar defense that will save you from taking most shots.  For shot blocking watch some videos for drills and the save motions. I recommend really learning how to step to the ball, one good drill for this is to take off your gloves with your stick on the ground in front of you and have someone throw balls at you while you step over the stick. Another good one is starting on one pipe and having a shooter shoot to the other side of the cage forcing you to make a big step to get to it, make sure to go from both sides.   Other than that, have fun and good luck with the goal tending!"

lacrosse,2zb9h2,Scuba98,2,Tue Mar 17 03:26:30 2015 UTC,"So back in 2005 I made the same jump. New sport at my HS and we needed a goalie so I jumped on the wagon. First practice I played goalie like a hockey goalie, huge mistake. If you want to learn lax fast the key is simple, watch lacrosse goalie videos. The basics come through muscle memory, so you have to put in the extra time. Footwork is huge, reading a shooter is a skill that can be learned and at the higher levels is the best way to make a save. Footwork again is a huge, huge part of being a good goalie. PM if you have any other questions."
lacrosse,2zb9h2,WarrenJV,2,Tue Mar 17 04:09:58 2015 UTC,"Playing hockey goalie and then lacrosse goalie it took me a while to learn that coming out far from the goal to cut down the angle is not nearly as important as it is in hockey. Angles still are important, but sitting close to the goal line will help more with reaction time, than playing at the top of the crease will to help get body saves. It will probably feel weird for a while, but training yourself to stay tight will help you in the long run."
lacrosse,2zb9h2,Um-Yeah,2,Tue Mar 17 07:40:24 2015 UTC,Just make sure you got your angles down and your stepping to the ball also make sure to talk to the d and call out the ball location
lacrosse,2zb9h2,bbsben,1 point,Tue Mar 17 19:52:16 2015 UTC,"Definitely watch some videos on it. That's how I first learned it. Then, like others have said, footwork is key! Get into condition by jumping rope and running ladders and pretty much anything else that involves quick feet. It also really helps to just walk the line cycling through all your saves to get the form down."

Not sure if it's the same stuff you are talking about but it was just small rubber strings weaved into mesh. I wasn't a huge fan of it. When it was warm out it would stretch and become illegal. I also had issues with it being inconsistent because the rubber would randomly stretch and cause a lot of whip.
