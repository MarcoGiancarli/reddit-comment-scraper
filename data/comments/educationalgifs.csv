educationalgifs,3e3die,ComeAtMeFro,3,Tue Jul 21 19:35:13 2015 UTC,"I would think that if a plane like that is manufactured some considerable distance from a body of water, this is more efficient and faster than hauling them all the way to the nearest body of water via trailer."

educationalgifs,3dxwub,owwz,3,Mon Jul 20 20:03:14 2015 UTC,"The secret to the sea sapphire’s shine is in microscopic layers of crystal plates inside their cells. In the case of blue sea sapphires, these crystal layers are separated by only about four ten thousandths of a millimeter; about the same distance as a wavelength of blue light. When blue light bounces off these crystal layers, it is perfectly preserved and reflected. But for other colors of light, these small differences in distance interfere, causing the colors to cancel out. So while white light is composed of all colors, only blue light is reflected back. This type of coloration is known as structural coloration, and though resembling a gem in hue, a sea sapphire’s color has more in common with an oil sheen than a pigmented jewel. Combine this nifty trick with the sea sapphire’s impressively transparent body, and you have an animal as radiant as a star in one moment, and invisible in the next.

educationalgifs,3dml2j,yourmom46,27,Fri Jul 17 14:29:30 2015 UTC,You were probably downvoted for providing zero explanation.  Care to explain why you feel this way?
educationalgifs,3dml2j,GoldenGonzo,54,Fri Jul 17 14:52:29 2015 UTC,"Depends how they are done, really.  Rolling is a forging process, which work hardens the material and may align grain structure in ways that enhance fatigue tolerance, vs cutting across grain lines as machining would do.  It also means the threads have just as much material as the shaft, so they aren't a focus of stress and assembly may be easier (there's some clearance on the shaft).  A machined bolt would need the shaft machined down and some heat treatment to gain similar properties, but would potentially have better dimensional tolerances.  Machined bolts are pretty rare outside of oddball sizes / materials and cases where the purpose of the threading is motion control / clamping rather than assembly, and obviously cost more to make for very large lots.  For one offs, machining (or using a threading die) would obviously cost much LESS."
educationalgifs,3dml2j,sebwiers,8,Fri Jul 17 15:13:22 2015 UTC,"Machinist here. Single pointing threads in a lathe is by far a much more accurate way of cutting threads. Also, much more expensive and time consuming. Creating a male and female thread manually is so much more satisfying though."
educationalgifs,3dml2j,Jethros,3,Sat Jul 18 02:59:24 2015 UTC,I'm only guessing but I'd imagine the steel would be stronger due to the bonds being moved when rolled rather than cut/sheared when cut.  The above terminology is probably wrong I'm thinking back 5 years in high school engineering to microscopic images of different steel showing lighter and darker spots
educationalgifs,3dml2j,MistakenNeverWrong,4,Fri Jul 17 14:59:57 2015 UTC,"Basically yes. When you cut threads you leave a rough, sheared off surface which can lead to thread failure.  When you roll, the metal is moved around (this is called cold forming because the metal isn't heated).  When you cold form materials it makes them tougher.  Also, rolling is cheaper."
educationalgifs,3dml2j,yourmom46,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:12:36 2015 UTC,"Not exactly.  The smaller grains have more intersections to prevent slip.  Also the compressive residual stress makes the bolt less likely to fatigue,  but it actually makes the bolt weaker in ultimate strength compared to a machined bolt."
educationalgifs,3dml2j,BadPAV3,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:02:29 2015 UTC,What? Cold worked or forged metal is often much stronger than metal which was not worked this way.
educationalgifs,3dml2j,Insecurity_Guard,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:57:50 2015 UTC,"It isn't the orientation or nature of the grains,  it's the compensation of the tensile stresses Sub surface equaling the compressive residual stresses at the surface. The tensile stresses add to the applied stresses causing it to fail from the inside in fatigue and sometimes even in ultimate. But this is in a lab.  In practice,  all of the surface stress concentrations are more than the tensile stresses. That's why we roll threads  / shot  peen / low  plasticity  burnish / last shock peen. And it's also why lab results don't always mimic reality, Even in the macro."
educationalgifs,3dml2j,BadPAV3,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:46:24 2015 UTC,"Rolled threads only cold work the surface,  and is distinct from forging. The child working is more susceptible to thermal and mechanical relaxation."
educationalgifs,3dml2j,BadPAV3,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:49:59 2015 UTC,Rolled threads don't produce an oily chip that needs to be disposed of like cut threads do.
educationalgifs,3dml2j,wild_eep,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:33:38 2015 UTC,It's a fact. Rolled threads compress the material. Cut threads remove it.
educationalgifs,3dml2j,johngault,-2,Fri Jul 17 15:08:21 2015 UTC,"Greater precision, I'd guess.    Downsides'd be that you need a special die for rolled, meaning that it only makes sense for large production runs.  I'd bet, too, that you can't do it with some harder steels."
educationalgifs,3dml2j,vonHindenburg,8,Fri Jul 17 14:56:19 2015 UTC,"Nah, cutted bolts a more precise but rolled bolts are tougher because the material is not cut off but deformed."
educationalgifs,3dml2j,makzZ,34,Fri Jul 17 15:01:31 2015 UTC,"This. Rolled bolts push the material in, which is called work hardening.   Hardened material sacrifices total energy absorption ability (toughness) for higher hardness (amount of force before deformation).   The more you harden a material, the more ""brittle"" it is, but the more force it can take before it begins to bend or shatter. That's why ""tool steel"" used for drill bits are super easy to snap off--even more so if they're EZ-outs. In order to cut softer steel, you harden the drill bit. But then the drill bit can take less and less bending before snapping off. EZ-outs have to be able to go through hardened steel, so they're even more hardened and super easy to snap.  On a stress-strain curve:  http://www.substech.com/dokuwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?w=&h=&cache=cache&media=stress-strain_diagram.png  The more force you put, you move right on the graph. Initially a material bends (""elastic region""), and if you let go of the force, it retracts back to it's original position. If you move passed that into the inelastic region, you are doing permanent deformation.  Work hardening is a trick using intentional deformation before you ever use the material. Because once you deform something, it actually moves the triangular region to the right. So you need more and more force before it even starts to bend.  HOWEVER, note the area of that whole graph decreases if you move that triangle over. AREA is the ENERGY required to snap (or survive snapping) that piece of metal. If you work harden, you get more force before deformation happens, but you also cannot take hard impacts.  This is important in all materials in everything you use. Choosing whether something should be hard, or soft. Your suspension members and rims in your car are relatively soft because it's much more important for your car to survive an impact with a rock/structure/pothole. It's better to be mangled than shatter and have your suspension rip off.  There's tons more to this stuff, like that first part (the triangle area) is also called the linear region. That means, for a given force, you get a given movement guaranteed. This is the basis for all springs! (See Hooke's Law)  If you're still with me at this point, you'll notice the ""necking region."" This is where if you keep pulling on a material and get to that point, you're no longer getting a higher maximum stress... it's reducing. Why? Because imagine a cylinder of metal, being pulled at both ends. Harder and harder, you're moving along that graph. At the necking point, the center of that cylinder (long-wise) is actually beginning to get thinner!  http://revisionworld.com/sites/revisionworld.com/files/rw_files/necking_34.gif  If you head off the right end of the graph, your metal snaps... sometime's in drastic ways because it's going to release all that energy!  But back on point, threads are very important for a bolt (obviously), so you want work hardened teeth on bolts and gears. You don't want them bending under load, and they're under large loads. So while cutting teeth is easier/cheaper, work hardening makes higher quality bolts.  If you want to follow up on more, you can check out another way to harden metal, Heat Treating. Which works on a chemical level to change the crystal structure of the steel. Most (all?) materials actually have these things called ""phase diagrams"" which describe different crystal alignments of the same atoms which give different characteristics. Heat treating is about moving your material around in these regions.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Brosen_ironcarbon.svg  [Sidenote: Ice has all kinds of different phases!]  I don't have time to go into this one (these two charts are 99% of a course in Material Science and you're still strapped for time in a semester!).   The key point I want to leave you with here, is that a single piece of metal does not have to have a homogeneous hardness (that is, it doesn't have to be equally hard or soft, or phase, everywhere.). They can, and do, heat treat the outsides of the teeth of gears, while leaving the insides soft. This lets the inside deform and absorb impacts, while the teeth stay hard and smooth to keep from wearing.  Your teeth are the same way!"

Further down:  ""It's also going to be expensive to feed: one second of firing the minigun will set you back about sixty bucks. That's $3600 for a full minute of shooting.""  According to an ammo website, this ammo (nato 7.62x51 aka .308) costs about $220 for a case of 500, so about $0.44 per round.   0.44 * 166 = $73.04 for 1 second of shooting (166 bullets).   73.04 * 60 = $4,382.40 for a full minute of shooting.

educationalgifs,3deh05,fakeuserisreal,14,Thu Jul 16 01:45:36 2015 UTC,"So I can give more info for the interested   You see in a normal fully automatic gun, the recoil, or pressure from firing the bullet it used to cycle the gun. Even on semi automatic you can see the bolt or slide move as it fires. But this is limited by a lot of things, these systems usually don't surpass 1000 rpm, though they can get pushed to 2000 rpm.  The minimum over comes this by using a driving motor. Basically the barrels are fixed and the bolt/trigger/ejection mechanisms are on cams. So when the gun turns a cam cycles the gun (not the recoil from the shot). So now you can just put a motor on the assbly and shoot as fast as you can spin. You can get some crazy high rpms from a system like this.  It does have disadvantages though. It's very heavy, the multiple barrels and cams add up fast. Then you have the motor, battery, and other systems. Its not as accurate, so this type of action would be awful, for example, as a sniper. And it has some efficiency problems, like on the F/A-18, you lose 6 rounds every time you spool up and down."
educationalgifs,3deh05,OmniaMors,10,Wed Jul 15 18:37:16 2015 UTC,Does it get a lot of jams?
educationalgifs,3deh05,Ceejnew,6,Wed Jul 15 19:44:00 2015 UTC,"Well it doesn't rely on recoil, so it doesn't have as many opportunities to jam since there's always a driving force cycling it."

educationalgifs,3deh05,yellowbluesky,8,Thu Jul 16 04:56:57 2015 UTC,"Small edit. A lot of machine guns are gas operated, not recoil operated.  For example, the M16/M4, AK-47, M249 light machine gun, M240 medium machine gun, and many others are all gas operated, meaning the expanding gas from the round being fired is rerouted to cycle the bolt.  Most use pistons to cycle the bolt, but the M16/M4 (infamously) uses direct impingement, or  the sending of the gases directly into the chamber to cycle the bolt.  One example I know is recoil operated is the Browning M2 heavy machine gun."

They should have been dressed in disco clothes for the 70's (more like the Bee Gees), the 80's clothes should have looked more like the big hair for girls and New Wave outfits, Billy Idol for the guy. It's funny they didn't put anything in there for the 60's. Long hair, hippie style clothes. Maybe they were trying to be more conservative."

Back in the late 80's and 90's the flannel look was very popular and we all wore them. I liked the flannel shirts because they were soft and warm.

educationalgifs,3d9lou,2four,25,Tue Jul 14 17:38:42 2015 UTC,"it's pretty different. A lot of similar things but theres no doubt that early 2000s clothing and style is much more 90s than it is modern. 10-15 years is usually the period before we can look back and laugh at what we used to wear, so by 2025 or 2030 we'll be laughing at the fact we wore what we're wearing now.  the circle of liiiiiife"

educationalgifs,3d9lou,LinearSimcon,17,Tue Jul 14 19:20:11 2015 UTC,"For sure. Suits are a good example, this is just one look but essentially they dont carry the popular traits of the past, no baggyness or square style of the 80s and 90s, and they're much more fitted than pre 60s, plus no flare from the 70s. They have a lot in common but at this point I'd say suits are one thing that aren't taking much from recent history."
educationalgifs,3d9lou,orsini1138,10,Tue Jul 14 20:46:49 2015 UTC,"Oh my, the first one could give me nightmares, I guess I've never really reflected on the fitting aspect of suits before as something that would be relatively recent, surely people didn't wear suits that.didn't fit them as the first image would suggest?"
educationalgifs,3d9lou,LinearSimcon,6,Tue Jul 14 20:51:31 2015 UTC,"There was better fitting in the past, the 80's-00's were just a really bad time.

educationalgifs,3d6b9p,masasuka,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:20:24 2015 UTC,Vectoring the thrust down would force the nose harder against the runway.   If you only have thrust on the tail yes like the F-22. But when you have thrust vectored down that is balanced near the planes center of gravity like the Harrier or F-35 it simply provides additional lift.

[citation needed] This ability was first introduced in the Russian Sukhoi Su-27 and Mikoyan MiG-29 fighter aircraft in the 1980s, which has since become a standard in their advanced 4th and 5th generation aircraft. There have been some conjectures, but the mechanism behind the supermaneuverability of the Russian aircraft is still unknown. However, post-stall analyses are increasingly used in recent years to advance maneuverability via the use of thrust vectoring engine nozzles.  As the result of such studies, United States produced the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor, which is the first non-Russian supermaneuverable aircraft.

educationalgifs,3d6b9p,DuckyFreeman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:42:39 2015 UTC,That is true. Only a few jet planes I know of have vectoring extreme enough and balanced enough for VTOL and hovering. But other planes with less vectoring can take off and land from runways that would otherwise be too short.
educationalgifs,3d6b9p,wickedsteve,2,Tue Jul 14 02:55:57 2015 UTC,"That's not thrust vectoring in the same sense as the Mig-29 or F-22. The nozzle on the F-35 isn't used as a way to control the jet, just to decrease (or eliminate) it's takeoff and landing distances."
educationalgifs,3d6b9p,speedrhino,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:36:28 2015 UTC,It is not applied the same. But it is the same principle. It is just a matter of the range of the vectoring and the location of the exhaust thrust to match the crafts center of gravity.

educationalgifs,3d6b9p,a10t2,6,Tue Jul 14 00:01:10 2015 UTC,I would imagine it would increase thrust like when you narrow the stream on a hose.
educationalgifs,3d6b9p,mebob85,8,Tue Jul 14 00:11:14 2015 UTC,It's strictly for vectoring. Changing the diameter doesn't change thrust any more than restricting a hose nozzle would increase the amount of water coming out.
educationalgifs,3d6b9p,a10t2,3,Tue Jul 14 00:36:58 2015 UTC,"Actually this isn't necessarily true. Changing the diameter also affects back pressure, which changes combustion characteristics. It can change the thrust of the overall system."
educationalgifs,3d6b9p,hunterandgatherer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:59:39 2015 UTC,"That's true; I actually mentioned it in another reply. I should have said ""increase"" rather than ""change"". Restricting the exhaust to the point that back pressure becomes an issue would decrease thrust."
educationalgifs,3d6b9p,a10t2,3,Tue Jul 14 03:06:26 2015 UTC,"Actually, that's not necessarily true either. There's an ideal amount of nozzle convergence that maximizes thrust that depends on multiple factors including the back-pressure-to-atmospheric-pressure ratio, combustion temperature, etc.  Wikipedia touches on this but doesn't explain in depth here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propelling_nozzle#Principles_of_operation  This is because a subsonic flow has constant mass flow rate. The convergence in the nozzle induces adiabatic expansion of the gas, which results in lower pressure but higher velocity at the nozzle exit. Since the velocity is higher and the mass flow rate the same, the thrust is higher. Of course, this only works under ideal conditions, and it is limited by the atmospheric pressure, i.e. you can't (or shouldn't) expand the flow to less than atmospheric pressure. Near-sonic and supersonic flows don't follow the same laws; a sonic flow can't be accelerated by convergence any more.  The de Laval nozzle expands on this (forgive the pun) by using an expansive section of nozzle after a convergent section chokes the flow (brings it to mach 1), which, by means I don't understand, somehow accelerates it even more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Laval_nozzle  Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong somewhere."
educationalgifs,3d6b9p,hunterandgatherer,2,Tue Jul 14 03:31:14 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell (admittedly, that requires remembering back to undergrad AAE), everything you've said is correct."
educationalgifs,3d6b9p,a10t2,8,Tue Jul 14 03:56:02 2015 UTC,"But changing the diameter would change the velocity as the Q would have to remain the same. So the thrust might be affected, no?"
educationalgifs,3d6b9p,mastermoebius,7,Tue Jul 14 00:46:31 2015 UTC,"Velocity, yes. But as you say, Q' remains constant. Conservation of mass dictates that increasing velocity also decreases V'.  In reality, there would be some reduction in thrust, simply because no mechanical system is 100% efficient. Watch a jet engine go into afterburner - they get the vanes as far out of the exhaust as possible."
educationalgifs,3d6b9p,a10t2,2,Tue Jul 14 01:14:08 2015 UTC,"Velocity, yes. But as you say, Q' remains constant. Conservation of mass dictates that increasing velocity also decreases V'.   What is your V' in this case? Since Q is remaining the same and the velocity is increased would the force in the opposite direction not also increase?   Not trying to nitpick, just genuinely curious. If I'm wrong, I'd really like to know."
educationalgifs,3d6b9p,mastermoebius,2,Tue Jul 14 02:54:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I shouldn't have used the shorthand, especially in the same sentence as velocity. V' is volumetric flow rate."
educationalgifs,3d6b9p,a10t2,2,Tue Jul 14 03:04:49 2015 UTC,"But restricting a hose causes the water to come out at increased velocity due to pressure. Amount of fuel ignited will remain the same but squeezed through a tighter space with increased pressure... I dunno might be negligible but hard to imagine there's no effect. Beyond that I'm not so sure the panels are actually restricting the airflow anyway, rather just reshaping to thrust in particular directions."
educationalgifs,3d6b9p,mastermoebius,3,Tue Jul 14 01:14:23 2015 UTC,"I just this second replied to the other comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/comments/3d6b9p/thrust_vectoring_demonstration/ct2egu9  Increased exhaust pressure is not the same thing as increased combustion pressure. In extreme cases, restricting exhaust can even lead to a compressor stall, but that's neither here nor there."

Some very nooby questions but I would love to know the answers. In a jet engine the thrust is ultimately determined the moment it leaves the nozzle right? Or is the thrust generated from a jet engine the product of intake rather than output? or both?
educationalgifs,3d6b9p,mastermoebius,2,Tue Jul 14 01:28:48 2015 UTC,"Thrust is proportional to the mass flow rate of the exhaust gases. In most if not all jet engines, that's a fixed quantity once the gas leaves the combustion chamber. Exceptions would be scramjets, where it's hard to say exactly where the combustion chamber ends and the nozzle begins, and (if I'm remembering correctly) some afterburner configurations that actually induce a second combustion event in the exhaust.  All else being equal, the more fuel/air you can cram into an engine, the more thrust you get out. So in essence intake is output."

The shrinking ring of bubbles encircles the school and confines it in an ever-smaller cylinder.

The whales then suddenly swim upward through the ""net"", mouths agape, swallowing thousands of fish in one gulp."

educationalgifs,3ca9su,snipun,3,Mon Jul 6 16:57:26 2015 UTC,"That is the springy contactor that triggers the signal when closed (that's why there are two pieces of metal, it's the two poles of the switch). Since it also rides on the switch tab which has that V-profile, it serves to provide the ""bump"" that is characteristic of the cherry brown switch pictured as well.  A cherry blue switch provides a bump and a sound due to the two piece mechanism. The bottom sleeve of the ""piston"" slaps against the bottom of the case (or maybe the piston has a shelf, not sure which), providing the loud ""clack"".  Here's a photo of a disassembled brown, and it would have been nice to see the blue disassembled too, but i'm sure a google search will turn up something."

Not to sound needy, but I'd love to see one of these on the early arcade games, too, since that was really where most of the coolest gameplay and graphics were happening. I still remember the awe I felt playing Dragon's Lair the first time. Actual cell shading animation? Forget about it!  Another cool thing would be to see the evolution of PC based games, because there were some awwwwwesome titles on that platform too. The original Star Craft was amazing, for example, first time I actually felt fear playing a video game because the suspense and tension was so well incorporated into the plot.   Way cool post!

educationalgifs,3c5q4o,dilkington11,7,Sun Jul 5 03:27:14 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not a thing that was actually released. There are no examples of games from it. Last I checked, it hasn't been confirmed it is even real.   You're correct that the story is an interesting one.   Sony had been planning on entering the video game market since sometime in the last 80s. They were already partners with Sega on Sega CD. Former Sega of America CEO stated that Sony probably paid for half of the research and development on that project.   With Sega CD, Sony was learning how to make video games on optical discs, which is why Sega CD existed, so companies can get hands on experience with that because it was widely assumed that the next generation of hardware would use optical media.   With the SNES-CD add-on, called ""Play Station,"" Sony got its feet wet developing hardware. The reasons for the split between Nintendo and Sony have been widely publicized over the past 25 years, so I won't get into that. But after the add-on was canceled Sony had rights to release a stand alone product that was compatible with SNES games and CD games based on green book standards, (which is was CD-i is based on). It was never released and no prototype had been discovered until maybe now.   I am a bit skeptical on whether or not the item found is real. Pics of the board, and of it turned on, and playing a game would be nice.   That said, in this post I only included consoles actually released in the U.S. There are a lot of consoles that were released in other regions that were not included, like PC-FX, Amstrad GX4000, Commodore Amiga CD32, Sega SG-1000, Bandai Playdia, and so on. To that end I also left out a number of first generation consoles, like Telstar Arcade and TV Fun models, because there were dozens of them, and once you've seen one you've pretty much seen them all. It would've made for a boring beginning to an album.   Further, there are a host of prototype consoles that were unreleased that I didn't include as well; Indreama L600, Konix Multisystem, and HDI Halcion come to mind. And we even do have footage of games for some of them.   So, I didn't include a gif of game play from the prototype of this ""Play Station"" because there's no source video from which to make a gif and it was never released in the United States."

educationalgifs,3c20so,Hoi-Yant,77,Sat Jul 4 01:21:20 2015 UTC,"Rx-8 owner here.  Pros: The engine is quite small(1.3 L) and red lines at 8500 rpms while putting out 232 horsepower.  The engine is quite cheap to produce compared to a conventional engine of similar power.  Cons:  The engine sacrifices performance for gas mileage. On a good day I get 18 mpg.  The engine also only has a life expectancy of around 150000 miles before the apex seals break/warp and therefore causes the engine to lose compression.   Overall I would give the engine itself a 6/10. The rx8 is amazing to drive and hugs the road, but if I had an engine swap I would love her all the more.    If you have any other questions feel free to ask!"

Also I got 155,000 miles out of my last motor, but I think on average they last closer to 130k depending on how well they are taken care of. I replaced the motor myself and it cost me about $3500 including random tools I needed, stuff I broke, and general upgrades like poly motor mounts and the sohn OMP adapter.  With a few upgrades and a tune my car puts 204 hp to the rear wheels at 8730 rpm, which is pretty good for a 1.3L motor.

educationalgifs,3c20so,LostMyMarblesAgain,5,Sat Jul 4 08:44:04 2015 UTC,"Well the engine has a good power to weight ratio, and an even better power to size ratio, but the car as a whole isn't much lighter. One of the big advantages is engine placement, they can put the motor low and far back in the engine bay to achieve the perfect 50-50 weight balance."
educationalgifs,3c20so,rotorain,2,Sat Jul 4 16:43:51 2015 UTC,"After working at a Mazda dealership in 2010 I actually think the engine is still too big despite how small it already is. The engine needs to rev high to burn out any deposits on the walls inside. Once you start babying it and letting those deposits build up, that's when the apex seals go. If the engine were smaller it would force the user to rev higher to get the same amount of power and thus reduce the problem with carbon build up. Of course things would need to be balanced a little better and able to withstand even higher rpms for it to be viable as I imagine it."
educationalgifs,3c20so,AverageAlien,2,Sat Jul 4 21:23:01 2015 UTC,Wouldn't that make the mpg even worse though? I imagine even if its a smaller displacement it would cause more friction
educationalgifs,3c20so,LostMyMarblesAgain,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:55:54 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know. Even though the amount of friction would be slightly higher, the whole engine would weigh less. The moving parts would weigh less and require less force to move. So there is too many variables to make any sort of conclusion without experimenting.   I would hypothesize that the mpg wouldn't be very different from what it is now even though the smaller engine would be spinning up a little faster. But I don't know."

educationalgifs,3c20so,IAmYourDad_,3,Sat Jul 4 03:16:01 2015 UTC,"Rebuilding the engine isn't too difficult, but you can buy a new assembled short engine (just the ""block"") for $2400 from the mazda dealership so that's gonna be a lot easier for most people. That's what I did for my rx8 and the whole swap cost me $3500 which is easily doable every 150k miles.  It is pretty difficult to just add another rotor as you need a whole new eccentric shaft, the intake/exhaust/ignition/fueling systems need to be completely rebuilt, and you'll need a new engine management system and wiring harness to control everything.  That said, Mazda put a Turbo 3 rotor in the Mazda Cosmo, so a motor can be taken out of one of those for a swap.

educationalgifs,3c20so,itshonestwork,3,Sat Jul 4 14:23:59 2015 UTC,"Part of why the RX-8 is amazing to drive and hugs the road is because of its weight distribution, and it's low centre of gravity.  You shoe horn a lazy V8 in there, and the entire car changes, not just the engine.  It's the entire point of the rotary engine. It's not put in there for no reason. V8 engine swapped RX-7's were popular, and for day to day driving, they were excellent. A 400bhp V8 RX-7 on a track day was utterly useless however. It was a monster on the straights, and that was it. For road driving there's barely a difference. On the track it was nowhere. Understeering, oversteering, and useless through the chicanes. My ~300bhp rotary powered one was far more planted.  The entire point of a rotary engine is amount of power for a given weight and package size. The entire point of an RX-7 is to exploit that. The car is designed around that engine.  The people that put big V8's in them, are the kind of people that drive to the extent that they don't really need a circuit oriented sports car, and should have just bought a big V8 barge to begin with, except for the fact they liked the styling.  A V8 converted RX-7 will be way more reliable, more economical, easier to drive at lower RPM, and is just simply a slower machine than a rotary one with same or even just similar peak power.  It depends what's important to you from a car. All the V8 swapped RX's are purely road going pootlers or drag cars. All of them are missing the point in my opinion.  All of them have taken an extremely specialised, tightly focussed and unique sports car, and simplified them into less capable touring/road cars. Makes you wonder why they even bought it in the first place, but most people that buy sports cars do it for the image or the aesthetics. Very few people take them to the track."

educationalgifs,3c20so,Giant_sharks,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:10:01 2015 UTC,"Always a manual... Never automatic. Automatics never rev high enough to remove the deposits in the engine resulting in sludge. Also the horsepower is significantly less in an automatic.   As far as a recommendation, I can say honestly that I love my 8 and she makes the chore of driving fun. They will draw eyes far more than any other car in the price range.  BUT... It is not for everyone. Rotary engines require a bit more maintenance than other vehicles.   If this is something that you have researched and are willing to jump into, by all means get one.  A rx8 will keep things interesting but I cannot recommend it for someone who isn't willing to take care of one.   Think hard before you buy one, she will not be the fastest car you will ever own or the cheapest to own, but it will be the most fun car you will ever own."

If I'm not much of a mechanic myself, should I be considering other cars?  Edit: I also forgot to mention that I live near the Canadian border.

educationalgifs,3c20so,Giant_sharks,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:41:49 2015 UTC,"It's actually not too bad as far as maintaining.  Just don't drive it without checking the fluids(particularly oil) and expect it to keep running.  I personally keep a quart of oil in my trunk and fill it up as needed.   Also keep in mind that repairs on the engine may be more expensive. And as I stated in a previous post, keep in mind that the engine may begin to lose compression after 120,000 miles or so  I personally live in the snowy land of Minnesota. Winters are actually fun. It's a drifters paradise. But one small mistake (not necessarily that of your own) could mean the difference between a $17000 dollar machine and a hunk of scrap. Also road salt is not kind to any vehicles. I recommend driving a winter beater but that is all up to you.  The car is very forgiving when are drifting. With a little bit of drifting experience, you should have no problem keeping her on the road.  Note: most places will put synthetic oil in your vehicle by default when getting an oil change. ONLY USE CONVENTIONAL OIL. The rotary engine burns oil by design and synthetic oil is designed not to burn... Not a good mix.   Another note: you will notice a marked increase in take off power using premium fuel vs regular unleaded. I recommend spending the extra $1.50 per fuel up and avoid those start up sputters.  Top gear did an informative episode on the rx8 if you're interested. It's on Netflix."

If the plating on the housing has any damage at all (like from a speck of dirt) it's trashed and requires re-plating at huge cost and downtime. These didn't catch on for a reason. When I worked in the machine shop I saw many a sad High Schooler buy these cars only to realize they were a bargain for a reason.

educationalgifs,3btaul,sfurbo,5,Thu Jul 2 19:38:38 2015 UTC,"Evolution (advertisement):       Evolution is an advertising campaign launched by Unilever in 2006 as part of its Dove Campaign for Real Beauty, to promote the newly created Dove Self-Esteem Fund. The centre of the Unilever campaign is a 75-second spot produced by Ogilvy & Mather in Toronto, Canada. The piece was first displayed online on 6 October 2006, and was later broadcast as a television and cinema spot in the Netherlands and the Middle East. The ad was created from the budget left over from the earlier Daughters campaign, and was intended to be the first in a series of such online-focused spots by the company. Later pieces include Onslaught and Amy. Evolution was directed by Canadian director Yael Staav and Tim Piper, with sound design handled by the Vapor Music Group, and post-production by SoHo.

educationalgifs,3btaul,Bullz-Eye,56,Thu Jul 2 00:33:07 2015 UTC,That is absolutely not what average means. That's what median means.

educationalgifs,3btaul,MinecraftGreev,14,Thu Jul 2 02:19:42 2015 UTC,"Mean, median and mode are all examples of averages. While ""average"" can specifically mean arithmetic mean, the meaning can also be wider.   In this case, I would argue that ""arithmetic mean"" is meaningless: Since I don't think it makes sense to quantify differences in beauty, we do not have a interval measurement, and therefor nothing to take the arithmetic mean of. Since ""average"" can therefor not refer to ""mean"", it must refer to one of the others."

Just because a fake Delorean time-travelled in Back to The Future doesn't mean I'll never buy a car that can't time travel. Just because Lamborgini's exist doesn't mean I won't buy a Toyota.  These magazines exist solely to make women feel bad about themselves so they can sell a magical product to ""fix"" you. It's a weapon. And judging from many woman's self-esteems, it's a very effective one.  The statue of King David didn't stop me from finding a wife, any more than a photoshopped woman will stop your daughter from finding a husband.  Teach your daughter to love herself first.

The range for ascii letters is from 1-128, so you need to add one. Thus supporting OP's gif, when decrypting you subtract 1, and when encrypting you add 1."

educationalgifs,3bdin6,Speaking-of-segues,-46,Mon Jun 29 01:30:21 2015 UTC,"Oh, I can explain that! You see, in math we use symbols to represent information, such as numbers and operations. The hyphen represents a subtraction operation, in which the number to its right is being taken away from the number on its left. So ""112-1"" means ""take one away from one hundred twelve"". Now the double hyphen symbol is an equals sign, which isn't actually an operation but is giving us a piece of information. And it's telling us that everything on its left is actually the same as everything on its right. So put it all together, and it's saying that ""Taking one away from a hundred twelve is the same as one hundred eleven"".  Hope this helps!"

educationalgifs,3bdin6,Absay,47,Sun Jun 28 06:10:20 2015 UTC,"As an experienced computer programmer... I have no clue.  Seriously, the pattern adds quite a lot of complexity over just storing things in a rectangular grid, and while I'm sure there must be some reason to do it this way, I have no idea what the advantages of this approach are."
educationalgifs,3bdin6,dragonnyxx,33,Sun Jun 28 07:48:48 2015 UTC,"That's because you have to be an information engineer, not a computer programmer, to design these things.  The codewords have 8 bits in each in them.  If there is damage to the code, it's most likely going to damage the nearest bits. For error correction, you prefer an entire codeword to be taken out, rather than having random bits from a number of codewords from being taken out. This is why the codewords are roughly square in shape.  However the ordering of the words for the datamatrix is not ideal, because you would prefer there to be interleaving of the error correction words with the data words, like QR has."
educationalgifs,3bdin6,silverforest,2,Sun Jun 28 10:00:38 2015 UTC,"However the ordering of the words for the datamatrix is not ideal, because you would prefer there to be interleaving of the error correction words with the data words, like QR has.   Why do you think so ? The error correction codes can restore the data and vice-versa.

educationalgifs,3bdin6,esterbrae,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:14:44 2015 UTC,"For error correction, you prefer an entire codeword to be taken out   8 bits is 8 bits, isn't it? Why would error correct at a ""higher level"" be helpful?"

educationalgifs,3bdin6,laccro,35,Sun Jun 28 23:58:56 2015 UTC,"I figured it was because there are 8 bits in a byte. Having a 9th to make it a perfect square is a waste of space. So you can fit a little more data if you can find a pattern that fits groups of 8 rather than 9, which they did."

educationalgifs,3bdin6,fukitol-,6,Sun Jun 28 11:58:12 2015 UTC,"Imagine one of these on a sticker. If you had the data in there serially, and a drop of water got on the sticker and made part of it rub off, data would be unrecoverable because a large chuck of sequential data would be wiped out. With the data spread out, and the remaining space used for error correction, you have a much better chance of being able to still decipher the meaning."
educationalgifs,3bdin6,dragonnyxx,8,Sun Jun 28 13:50:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't see it. You could just as easily do it in 2x4 blocks instead of 3x3 blocks with corners missing, using the same amount of  space for error correction. I don't see how damage to the one is somehow less severe than damage to the other."
educationalgifs,3bdin6,Galerant,4,Sun Jun 28 14:00:55 2015 UTC,"You want damage to affect as few codewords as possible, and damage tends to be localized to a single spot. In a 2x4 arrangement, each block is on average adjacent to 4 blocks from the same codeword (3+5+5+3+3+5+5+3/8) and 4 from a different codeword. In a 3x3-1 arrangement where the missing block is taken from a corner, each block is on average adjacent to 4.25 blocks from the same codeword (3+4+5+7+4+3+5+3/8) and 3.75 from a different codeword. This is the maximum possible for 8 blocks.  Essentially, the more square an arrangement is, the more blocks from the same codeword each individual block is adjacent to on average."
educationalgifs,3bdin6,breakneckridge,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:41:06 2015 UTC,"But that doesn't explain it any better. If the idea is to make each ""code word"" dispersed to avoid loss of bits coming from any single code word, then you would want each code word's bits to be totally dispersed throughout the pattern. E.G. top left square is code word A's bit #1, then the adjacent square is code word B's bit #1, etc."
educationalgifs,3bdin6,Galerant,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:08:18 2015 UTC,"No, you don't want them dispersed, because then one bit of damage hits multiple words at once, as damage to a physical object tends to be concentrated to a single location. You want damage to hit as few codewords as possible, which means you want codewords to be as concentrated as possible.  So, for example, if a barcode gets hit with water and smudged, or scratched, or otherwise marred, the number of codewords affected by the damage is minimized, meaning that there's less that has to be reconstructed.  Losing one bit from 8 codewords means that you need to reconstruct 8 codewords to make sure you have the correct message with a minimal chance of mis-reconstruction. Losing 8 bits from one codeword means that you only have to reconstruct one."

educationalgifs,3bdin6,drakeisatool,10,Sun Jun 28 23:20:25 2015 UTC,"I've read the ISO standard (several years ago). As I recall, it went into some detail about the reasoning behind the pattern. it's really all about error tolerance - the pattern works together with the error correction algorithm to defeat the most common data loss scenarios you'd get from badly printed or scanned labels.  Datamatrix is created for use in tracking labels, and it appears some research has gone into making it robust."
educationalgifs,3bdin6,Azarinak,3,Sun Jun 28 14:13:22 2015 UTC,"With some experience in barcodes verification, know that data matrix is a really bad design with one of the worst read rates for any 2D barcode. Each of the ""L"" shaped blocks contains a byte, and is designed to have error correction. This means if you smudge part of it or make any block unreadable, you can still decode it. Basically those ""L"" shaped blocks are the most compact shape possible to ensure readability."

educationalgifs,3bdin6,Jantr,39,Sun Jun 28 05:17:14 2015 UTC,"They just contain the same information as the first chunks.   No, modern ECC codes are not longer that simple. Datamatrix uses Reed-Solomon codes for error correction. It can correct for errors even if bits are missing.  To ELI5:  How many of you kids remember y = m x + c ? Yeah? If you have two values you want to error protect, store those in m and c. Then pick a small number of values of x and store those y values along with it. With this extra information you have ~redundancy~ and you can reconstruct the data from this extra information if there is an error.  Of course in a typical use case we don't actualy use a straight line but use higher order polynomials. For example for five data points you would use y = a₁ + a₂ x + a₃ x2 + a₄ x3 + a₅ x4. More mathy explaination here.  Done.    Now that I've embarrassed myself by trying to ELI5 R-S error correction, here is a quick explaination for someone who knows what a Fourier transform is:  Encode bits in the low frequency part of the frequency domain. Transform to the time domain. This is your codeword. Decode by transforming from the time domain to the frequency domain. If you notice a high frequency signal this means there is a bit error (since when encoding all your data is in the low frequency bins) and you can find and correct the error. (This image is really good, red is ""error"".) Note that this doesn't contrast with the typical explaination of RS because the discrete Fourier transform is equivalent to polynomal evaluation."

You'll notice that three of the corners have the same alternating white-black-white-black squares. Then somewhere amongst the seemingly random blocks you'll see a similar but smaller square with the white-black-white deal.   So a qr reader algorithm will be able to figure out the angle, where the edges are and the dimensions (how many 'blocks' high and wide), the barcode uses the timing strip and the solid line around two edges to do this.  But QR's would be limited to having a minimum size that might not be well suited to tiny stickers on a motherboard or graphics card."

Datamatrix has a huge range in resolution. you can create simple ones which just contains a little text, such as an URL, just like QR code....or you can go berserk and create a huge one, which is divided into several sectors - and several ones can be chained to store a huge amount of data (I can't remember how much, but I believe it's 1MB or more).

educationalgifs,3aylmp,endospores,120,Wed Jun 24 18:40:45 2015 UTC,"Food scientist here.  While it is a valid technique that anyone can do at home, if i may:   Nutella has highly refined sugar, i would think smaller granulometry than powder sugar, so it might feel grittier in the mouth than actual nutella even with powder sugar, definitely gritty with regular table sugar.  Sugar does not dissolve in fat, but it does on your tongue. Use the finest powder sugar you can find for best results.  Stability. While this product would definitely taste amazing, it won't enjoy the shelf life stability nutella has, so it should be consumed in a relatively short time span.   Fat rancidity and separation of the different oil phases come to mind.  At least consider adding a little bit of soy lecithin to bind any loose moisture, 0.5% should be enough.  Also keep it away from sunlight, it promotes faster rancidity."

Fat oxidation is not temperature dependant, you can freeze fat and it will still oxodize at the same rate than at room temperature. Now intense heat accellerates oxidation, also light.   Wanna go hardcore industrial add a chelating agent, as metals catalize the oxidation reaction, the chelating agent will bind loose metal ions. And an antioxidant to bind loose oxygen radicals. And a cbi fat to bind the loose oil. And pgpr to make it better flowable at low temperature... Muahahahhaha.  Gah i need to leave the industry."

educationalgifs,3aylmp,shepherder,25,Wed Jun 24 20:58:33 2015 UTC,"Also as a general tidbit about keeping nutella in the fridge. There's many reasons not to.    When you cool it the fat crystallizes and thus it hardens, which sucks. Also, cooling it and then taking it out of the fridge, opening it and taking some, you've invited some air moisture to condense on the surface of the jar and the cold nutella.  The newly condensed water dissolves some of the sugar on the surface of the spread and given enough time and moisture, some yeast or mold will come party on your hazelnut spread."

educationalgifs,3aylmp,TedTheGreek_Atheos,12,Wed Jun 24 16:21:33 2015 UTC,But there's loads of fats in hazelnuts so they presumably contribute quite a lot to the total nutrition
educationalgifs,3aylmp,jasnooo,11,Wed Jun 24 16:36:32 2015 UTC,"Hazelnuts are about 60% fat by weight, but Nutella has more Palm oil than it has hazelnuts, so less than half of the fat is from hazelnuts, probably 1/4 to 1/3, but the exact ingredient ratios aren't available.  Not that there's any particular nutritional difference between hazelnut oil and palm oil.  The total of fats from hazelnuts and palm oil combined is about 1/3 of the total weight (12 of 37 grams), while sugar makes up most of the rest (21 of 37 grams).  Since fat has more calories, the result is about 55% fat / 42% sugar / 3% protein, in terms of calories."

The first two pins on the right side are a special kind of pin (note the shape of them) that make it more difficult for those pins to be picked and set.  When picking a lock, you have to get a feel for lifting the pin and feeling it ""set"" in the correct position.  These non-cylindrical pins are harder to detect, because the ""slip"" that you feel when it's actually setting against the thinner part of cylinder is similar to the slip you feel when you correctly set a purely cylindrical pin.

(Supermassive black holes up to 21 billion (2.1 × 1010) M☉ have been detected, such as NGC 4889.)  Unlike stellar mass black holes, supermassive black holes have low densities if you assume that the Schwarzschild radius is the outer edge of the black hole (note that this assumption is in contrast to the typical assumption that a black hole is a singularity, and therefore has zero radial extent). Under this assumption, the average density of a supermassive black hole can be less than the density of water.

educationalgifs,3aac4e,autowikibot,3,Thu Jun 18 17:50:02 2015 UTC,how does that happen
educationalgifs,3aac4e,henskies,5,Sat Jun 20 05:54:31 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how they can say black holes take up no space. It's right there, how's it taking up no space if it's right there?"
educationalgifs,3aac4e,amin456789,16,Fri Jun 19 06:25:21 2015 UTC,"Objects usually take up space because their charged particles - electrons and protons - are pushing each other apart. Electrons pushing electrons is why you can touch things and why your hand won't just fall through a table, even though atoms are mostly empty space. Protons pushing protons is why nuclei have dimensions and aren't point masses.  Now, a black hole happens when matter is packed densely enough that all these repelling forces are overcome and all the particles attract each other despite these forces. This makes the matter more dense, which in turn strengthens the gravitational force further. Because there's nothing pushing these particles apart, we end up with them all occupying the same point in space - they become a singularity.  A black hole's Schwartzschild radius isn't really its dimensional size. If I remember correctly, it's the distance from which the black hole's gravitational pull is so strong that literally nothing can escape it. I suggest you do some googling about that part, because I find it quite cool.  EDIT: one thing I'd like to add - the reason why we say the singularity ""takes up 0 space"" instead of ""takes up only a little space"" is because in chemistry and physics, we define the dimensions of particles, atoms and molecules by how far they are from the particles next to them. Since in a black hole the particles are all literally in the same spot, not just very near to each other, there is no distance or dimensions to measure or define, and thus we say that the volume of the singularity is 0.  Whether this is true is, if I'm not mistaken, basically impossible to determine, because the way we measure things in science is we bounce light, electrons or other particles off the thing we want to measure and then see how they change. A black hole just absorbs all these particles and we're none the wiser."

I don't know how to answer your question, and I think that's because it's not a meaningful question to ask. It doesn't really make sense. So I'll say this instead.  Something you've got to recognize when you start trying to understand reality on a physical and fundamental level is... well, it's sort of that.. your experience with reality is irrelevant. It doesn't matter. Most people bring a level of instinct/intuition/'common sense' into places like this, where it isn't welcome. It's not warranted. It's detrimental to your understanding; it misleads you; the questions you are inclined to ask become much different, and not at all helpful.  You are familiar with ""things"" ""taking up"" ""space"". Your intuitive understanding of what all those terms mean is incorrect when it comes to this subject matter. The nature of reality does not pair well with our mechanisms of learning and understanding, because the only thing evolution cares about is an organism's ability to survive. Not only that, but survive here - on a specific planet. Evolution does not select for the ability to know the truth of reality."

The term ""black hole"", when discussed in science, does not refer to the black circle in this. This is a fucking HUGE misconception that the general public has about black holes! It's sincerely upsetting.  The mass of a black hole doesn't take up any space (theoretically sort of ). Meaning its volume = 0. Meaning it's a singularity! And that theoretical object exists at the very center of the black circle in that picture I linked. The black circle's edge is called the event horizon. It's defined by the ability of light to escape the gravity of the black hole. It is not the actual object itself.  Hope that's helpful."

You start off so well with ""Just as Earth is falling into the sun, the whole galaxy is spiraling(collapsing) into that black hole""...  ""Spiraling"" is correct, ""collapsing"" is not. Black holes are not like vacuum cleaners that relentlessly suck in everything around it, they are like suns that cause things to orbit.  There is a very illuminating fact that is often brought up in these discussions: If our sun somehow became a black hole, the only really noticeable thing that would change would be that it no longer emits visible light. The earth would continue on the same orbit because the black hole would be the same mass as the sun.  Just as the planets are NOT being sucked into the sun but simply orbiting it in a stable configuration, the black hole at the centre of the galaxy does not doom the stars in the galaxy to be consumed."

educationalgifs,3a8837,PM_ME_YOUR_CHURCH,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:20:40 2015 UTC,How can you even comprehend a 12D shape? Let alone know it well enough to animate it.
educationalgifs,3a8837,illPoff,7,Thu Jun 25 07:26:18 2015 UTC,"Trying to answer that really good question is even tougher than you think. To make it ELI5 understandable, I'd have to try to describe a ton of other things that also would take a lot of explaining. The end result would look like I'm going off on some nonsensical tangent, and not answering the question. But, I'll try anyways!  The best (and only) way I found to comprehending these specific types of donut, is by using something called toratopic notation. It's graph theory in an unfamiliar context, and looks like this. In other words, the symbols that look like (((II)I)(II)) is an abbreviation for an actual equation of a unique donut, this one being 5D. A regular 3D donut is ((II)I), and a sphere is (III). A capitol 'I' is an arbitrary dimension, and (n) is an arbitrary diameter with n-dimensions.  You can even represent slices of these donuts in a lower plane, by using (I) to mean stacking by 2 along a certain axis, which is the basic 1D cut of a circle (II). If you have this in a shape sequence, like slices of a 3D torus, we get ((I)I) as two circles side by side, by pairing along an axis.  Getting a ((II)) is two concentric circles, as pairing by a diameter. Cutting further to 1D, we get ((I)) as 4 points in a row, or (()I) as an empty intersection. This empty cut is the axis that threads right through the hole of a donut, missing it completely. So, if ((I)I) is two circles in a row, then ((I)(I)) is 4 circles in a 2x2 square, as stacked by 2 along x and y, as cut of 4D ((II)(II)). Likewise, (((I))I) is 4 circles in a row, as cut of 4D (((II)I)I).   In 6D, you can have possible donuts that are a (((II)I)((II)I)) , which is the cartesian product of the surface of two 3D donuts, then inflated with a circle in every point, making this awesome thing. By removing the capitol ""I"" out of the notation, we symbolize a cross section, which can look like (((I))((I))) , which means a 4x4 square array of 16 circles (II). This cut notation sequence is also the equation for those circles, in an abbreviated form.  In 9D, there's a possible donut that is a (((II)I)((II)I)((II)I)) , the product of the surface of three 3D donuts, then inflated with a sphere in every point. Intercepting 3D will look like this: (((I))((I))((I))) , a 4x4x4 array of 64 spheres (III), which looks like this.  And, finally, we get to a possible 12D donut, the (((II)I)((II)I)((II)I)((II)I)) , as the product of the surface of four donuts, then inflated with a 4D sphere (IIII) in every point. Cutting down into 4D, we get a   (((I))((I))((I))((I)))  which is a 4x4x4x4 array of 256 hyperspheres (IIII), densely packed in the shape of a tesseract. Since the hypercube array of hyperspheres was what I was after, I knew there was a donut in 12D that could make it, with a single equation. So, I wrote the equation, treated it as just a hypercube, set up the correct rotation controls, and turned it to all the angles I needed.  So again, the explanation might not be very clear, since I use an unfamiliar notation that describes these things. It took me over a year of (obsessive) contemplation, visualization, discussion, and gradual learning of its nuances, in order to get it. I'm still finding little extra things about it, too, even after 2 years of first exposure. But, it does a remarkable job describing the wildest objects I never imagined anyone could understand. That's why it still fascinates me."
educationalgifs,3a1j3s,FuturisticChinchilla,61,Tue Jun 16 14:33:37 2015 UTC,"The benefits are:   The circumference of the inner wheel is temporarily smaller than that of the outer wheel, so track-wheel friction is minimized without the use of a differential.

Flat belt drives also do the exact same thing, but with two ""wheels"" back to back. That is, the belt drive wheel is bumped in the middle and smaller on the edges to keep the belt centered. You'd think it would have to be the other way (or flanged), but nope."

educationalgifs,3a1j3s,jorgeyp,0,Tue Jun 16 20:59:12 2015 UTC,"No, the track is not lower on one side, it's levelled. And you're right, the train tips to one side. But the key here it's that this happens without mechanical intervention: when the train enters a curve, the outside wheel stars to roll in a wider radius and the inside in a smaller one, because they are conic, and at the same time it makes the train to lean to its inside. Look again at the gif, and pay attention at how the tracks are guiding the train, it necessarily leans because one wheel is rolling in a smaller radius than the other."
educationalgifs,3a1j3s,sebwiers,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:17:39 2015 UTC,"Ok, I think I get it now- so the train is indeed having its momemtum carry it to the outside of the turn. However this forces the outside wheels to a larger part of the cone and the inside wheels to a smaller part, causing the train to have a net movement in the direction of the turn, am I right?"

Or more specifically, the concept of passing a nth dimensional object through a xth dimensional plane seems logical. A cube appears to be a square, or triangle, or other shale depending on the angle. The real question is, what does that tell us, the ""flatlander"" about the higher dimensional object? What properties of the hypercube are gained from moving it through a 3D plain?"
educationalgifs,39vl2u,xtirpation,5,Mon Jun 15 15:23:49 2015 UTC,"The real question is, what does that tell us, the ""flatlander"" about the higher dimensional object? What properties of the hypercube are gained from moving it through a 3D plain?   That's what I was trying to explain by comparing the cube slices to hypercube slices. Some hypercube slices are the extended prisms of the cube slices, which illustrates in a different way how a hypercube is a cubic prism in 4D:   If a cube is sliced as a square: then a hypercube slices as a cube, since the original square of the cube got extended into the new cube (of the hypercube).  If a cube is sliced as a line expanding to rectangle: then a hypercube slices as a square expanding to rectangle prism, because that original line of the cube got extended into the new square.  If a cube slices as a triangle at the corner: then a hypercube slices as a triangle prism at its line, because the original corner of the cube got extended into that line.  The challenging part, is when we snip just the corner of a hypercube. The corner has 4 dimensions less than the whole hypercube, of which there is no analogy in 3D. By comparison, the 0D corner of a cube has 3 dimensions less than the whole 3D cube (we can't remove 4 out of the 3 available).   This has a similar sounding (and slightly confusing, sorry) description as the above. Snipping just the corner of a cube makes a triangle. Raising that one dimension up, we get the 3D version of that triangle, which is a tetrahedron.  Back to the cube: as the triangle grows, the corners begin to flatten (truncate), into a hexagon. Back to the hypercube: as the tetrahedron expands, its corners begin to flatten, into an octahedron."

Memorization comes first, then replaying what we memorize, then make gradual connections later on. This takes months to years of not giving up. It's really hard, because we are limited as the Flatland beings. I'd focus on 3D objects being shown to 2D beings first, and how it looks to them.  These effects transfer over to our sense of 4D objects, exactly. So, we do have a way to understand what happens, but it requires working backwards, from 3D objects shown in 2D.

educationalgifs,39vl2u,RenaKunisaki,26,Mon Jun 15 17:41:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, there are some things in 4D that would seem really strange to us. When it rotates, a 4D sphere actually has two equators, and no fixed polar positions. A single rotation like a 3D sphere is unstable, and it will wobble until settling into a double rotation. And, likewise, a 6D sphere has three equators, and can triple rotate in the same way.  There's a 4D donut called the tiger that has two separate donut holes, that sort of 'cross' by each other in the same middle area. It's more to do with the weird ring. In 3D, two dimensional shapes intersect at a line, but in 4D, they intersect at a point.   This gives you the ability to walk around an infinite 2D wall, like walking around a flag pole, without having to go through it. Because of this, some 4D donuts can wrap around an infinite long and wide board of plywood, without touching it. Like a mile long piece of string threaded through a cheerio. Going further, a some 5D donuts can wrap around an infinite 3D cube of matter in the same exact way.   Waves in even dimensions have a self-echo property, like a boat passing by and producing multiple waves instead of just one. Odd numbers make just one pulse, no matter how many dimensions. Those are a few things you get beyond 3D."

I just watched Flatland: The Movie last week.  I thought it did a pretty nice job of explaining how the nth dimension can't see the (n+1)th dimension (or only a cross-section).  Chances are I'm misstating things in my assumptions for each question so please correct anything I'm wrong about:  In your linked video, the 4D sphere appears in the 3D world as a miniscule 3D sphere that expands then shrinks.  How come when the 4D Hypercube passes through Cube first it does not appear as a miniscule 3D Cube that expands and shrinks?  You showed that a 3D cube can pass through the 2D world in three ways: 0D (point first), 1D (line first), and 2D (square first).  The 0D and 1D versions have variations: For example, for pointfirst, the corner of the cube could be pointing perpendicularly towards and heading straight toward the 2D plane, resulting in an equilateral triangle that expands equally around the contact point (and then becoming a hexagon, then back to a triangle).  Or the corner of the cube could tilted 30 degrees in one direction and then moved straight down, resulting in the triangle no longer forming equally around the contact point and/or no longer being equilateral  But when the cube passes through squarefirst, the cross-sections are identical shapes, just rotated.  Does this hold true for higher dimensions?  (When a 4D hypercube passes through 3D cube first, is it always the same, just rotated?  But a 4D hypercube passing through a 2D plane could have different cross-sections?)  And a 4-D cube can pass through the 3-D world in four ways: (point, line, square, 3-D cube).  Extending, an n-dimension cube can pass through the (n-1) dimension in n ways?"

I haven't figured out how to do that yet, but that is my goal. It's a technical limitation of my current gif maker. I need photoshop or something.   In your linked video, the 4D sphere appears in the 3D world as a miniscule 3D sphere that expands then shrinks. How come when the 4D Hypercube passes through Cube first it does not appear as a miniscule 3D Cube that expands and shrinks?   That's because spheres are curved things, and cubes have all flat sides. The scans of a cube show a square suddenly appearing, remain still and unchanged, then vanish. Same case with a tesseract looking like a constant cube-slice. Now, of this were a cubical pyramid , then you would see the cube appear and shrink to a point. That may be the next one I do, like the spherinder versus hypercone.   When a 4D hypercube passes through 3D cube first, is it always the same, just rotated?   Yes, in fact there are 8 of those cube-faces to pass through that way, just like the six square faces of a cube. There's only so many unique angles, minus the infinite obliques in between the ones you saw.    But a 4D hypercube passing through a 2D plane could have different cross-sections?    In this case, you can freeze any of the slices of a hypercube, take the shape whatever it is, and scan that through 2D. It would be scans of a tetrahedron, triangle prism, hexagon prism, cube and the truncates of them.    Extending, an n-dimension cube can pass through the (n-1) dimension in n ways?   If you only consider the corner, line, square, etc options, then yes. So, for a 5D cube, you can pass it through 4D hyperplane pointing tesseract, cube, square, line and vertex first.   Tesseract first is an unchanging tesseract.  Cube first is a cube appears, expands into rectangular tesseract, collapses to cube.  Square first is a square morphs into triangular diprism, hexagon diprism, then reverse all the way back into a square.  Line first is a line expanding into a tetrahedral prism, morph into octahedral prism then reverse all the way back into a line.  Vertex first, and it would look like the 4D triangle: a pentachoron, that truncates into something in between that plays the role of the octahedron. I still haven't figured out what that thing would be in 4D."

Quoting myself from another thread, but with the links:  Consider what a 3D cube looks like, when drawn in 2D. This is a flattened image of a 3D object: it looks like a small square inside a larger, with four trapezoids connecting them (which are normally shaped squares seen edge-on) . The big square is the side we're looking thorugh (near-side), and the small one is the far-side, across the missing 3D space. The 3D volume is in between the big and small square.   Now, consider a tesseract (hypercube) projection. Imagine this as a 3D model, floating in front of you. We see a big cube joined to a small cube, joined by trapezoidal prisms (which are actually normally shaped cubes, seen edge-on). The big cube is the 3D ""face"" we're looking through, and the small cube is the opposite side, across the 4th dimension. The missing, flattened 4D volume is actually in between the big and small cube-faces, but we can't see it that way. It's a 3D ""drawing"" of the fully expanded 4D object."

Like face first I get because on a 2D plane a cube passing through face first would appear to be a square appearing instantly and then instantly disappearing later. Such as a 4D hypercube passing through face first in 3D would appear to be a cube appearing instantly and then instantly disappearing later.

It looks like for the line scan, it only expands/contracts in the vertical directions, it stays constant in the horizontal dimension.  Also, when the 3d cube passes through the 2d plane face-first, the flatlanders only see a static image that appears and then disappears.  So that being the case, I would think when a 4d hypercube passed through a 3d plane cube-first, we would only see a static cube appear and then eventually disappear.  Is that incorrect?

educationalgifs,39ifwt,ltjpunk387,3,Fri Jun 12 07:55:03 2015 UTC,"The important part is when you get the most pressure.

It was shown at the Paris Aero Salon held in December 1908 and was first flown in 1909. It was the world's first  rotary engine produced in quantity. Its introduction revolutionized the aviation industry  and it was used by many early aircraft. It produced 50 horsepower (37 kW) from its capacity of 8 litres (488 cubic inches).  A Gnome Omega engine powers the 1912 Blackburn Monoplane, owned and operated by the Shuttleworth Collection, the oldest known airworthy British-designed aeroplane worldwide.  A two-row version of the same engine was also produced, known as the Gnome 14 Omega-Omega or Gnome 100 hp. The prototype Omega engine still exists, and is on display at the United States' National Air and Space Museum.

This means that a lot of oil needs to be used so that it can cover everything nicely, but to prevent it pooling up in the lower cylinders, it must be able to leak. If it stops leaking, you know there's a problem.  Rotary aircraft engines are similar, but the whole engine rotates with the propeller to remain cool, and it has a total loss system of oil. The aircraft's range was usually determined by how much oil it could hold, as well as petrol. Both tanks had to be refilled before flying."

educationalgifs,39ifwt,wereweazle,4,Fri Jun 12 13:52:26 2015 UTC,"I'll take a crack at this.    Mazda kind of screwed the pooch while simultaneously perfecting the whole shebang.  The biggest reason, I think, that rotaries failed in the market is because they got a big reputation as being ""inherently unreliable"", which is completely untrue.  If you want proof of their longevity, take a look at how well they did in endurance racing.  Many finished races only to tear down their engines and find it could have gone another full race.    However, Mazda made some key design decisions that really hurt their image.  The first, and I believe biggest mistake, was the Oil Metering Pump (omp).  Rotaries burn oil in the combustion chamber by design, this oil is injected into the chamber from the sump engine oil.  It's squirted along the apex seals as they spin.  There are a few issues with this.    1) engine oil is dirty and, in most cases, is NOT designed to be burned up in the combustion chamber.  It leaves behind carbon deposits. 2) The jet that squirted the oil onto the apex seals only did so on a small portion of its width.  So on many rotaries you crack open you'll see two wear lines with a less worn portion in between.  The omp fails to lubricate the entire width of the seal.    Now, the best option would be to just have customer pre-mix their gasoline with two-stroke oil.  It's designed to burn, leaves behind much less carbon, and is cheap.  I premix 1oz of two-stroke for every gallon of gasoline I put in my car.  Did I mention I have a first-gen rx7 with 80k miles on the stock motor that's never been opened?  30 year old car.  However, Mazda didn't think people would buy a car that requires extra work and care than a standard piston engine.  Instead of pre-mixing every fill-up, they advised checking your oil every 500 miles or so, as it would get low from the omp drawing from it.  They sacrificed reliability for customer ease of use.  Then there's the whole major FD (third gen) cooling issues that I don't frankly know enough about or feel like getting into.  Again, easily resolvable in the aftermarket.    The last point I'll mention is rotaries tend to fail when people fail to accept they're driving rotaries.  They need to be driven and they need to be revved.  Remember that carbon build-up?  Running your engine hot and to redline helps burn that off and keep your engine clean.  Many, many drivers avoid redline, these drivers also tend to be the less informed ones.  Leading to a lot of problems.  They also don't do well with small, around town trips.  It doesn't allow the engine to properly heat up and lets deposits form.    So in short;  pre-mix over OMP, rev the shit out of the little thing, and enjoy your engine."
educationalgifs,39ifwt,_beast__,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:41:21 2015 UTC,That's very interesting. Why didn't they just have an automated oil/gas mixing mechanism before the engine?
educationalgifs,39ifwt,wereweazle,2,Fri Jun 12 17:41:30 2015 UTC,"Many people do this as an aftermarket option.  They buy a washer fluid reservoir or something similar off ebay and hook it into their omp.  That way they can monitor how full it is and when it needs topping off.  I didn't go that route for two reason.  Mainly, it still relies on the not-so-great injectors that only drip it onto the center of the seal.  And secondly, I'm cheap and disconnecting the OMP was easier.  My FB has two giant storage spaces that sit behind the seats so I just keep a funnel and a little bottle of two-stroke in there.  Only adds maybe a minute to filling up the car and the entire seal gets lubrication.    As to why they didn't do this?  I have no idea, like I said some really questionable decision making there.  If I had to take a guess it went along with the ease of use for the customer.  Checking oil is something people did regularly back when these were first coming out (late 70s).    Edit:  Now that I think about it, it was almost certainly for emissions reasons.  Rotaries have tons of emissions controls to help them pass testing.  Two-strokes have a hilariously evil public image for emissions, but I can't speak for the public thought on them back then.  Bikes like the Kaw H2 had recently been killed from line-ups for being two-stroke, and this being just a few years after their discontinuation, maybe there were some regulations that I'm unaware of."
educationalgifs,39ifwt,_beast__,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:45:19 2015 UTC,"No, I meant putting a sort of mixing chamber for the oil and gas in before either one gets to the engine, (with computer controlled valves today, would've been more difficult to do it mechanically back then) and then pump both into the engine simultaneously."
educationalgifs,39ifwt,wereweazle,2,Fri Jun 12 18:05:36 2015 UTC,"Ah! Sorry for misunderstanding.  You're question prompted me to do a bit more research.  My car with the 12a engine and carb actually has the oil shot in at the carb, mixing with the fuel there.  Later models moved to injectors in the rotor housings themselves along with fuel injection.  Post '88 this is an ecu controlled valve that varies oil based on things like throttle positions and rpm.  Pre-88 was a mechanical system that varied based on throttle position as far as I can tell.    So the early ones did have sort of what you're talking about, but the chamber they mix in is the carb itself."

Check out how far the used rx-8 prices have dropped if you want a steal....  Weakest thing on that car as far as I can tell is the spark plugs, wires, and coils.

You lose the water, you lose the engine, you lose the plane.  Air cooling removes a source of weight, and a source of potential failure of the engine. WWII was the pinnacle of use  piston aircraft engines. After the war the migration to jets began. The US Navy concluded before the war that all of it's aircraft were to have radial engines because they considered these to be more reliable for long over-water flights. Many times during the war a radial engine would take substantial damage, and the plane still able to fly home and land safely. In contrast a damaged linear engine pretty much always meant a lost plane. While the Americans used both types of engines, most American aircraft types which served in the war had radial engines. The European powers mostly used linear engine types, but not exclusively. The Japanese used radials."

educationalgifs,394w4j,jogden2015,3,Wed Jun 10 01:25:04 2015 UTC,"It's pretty simple, actually. We write an equation using four variables, one for each dimension. Starting with a circle √(x²+y²) = a , we can taper it to a point along z, using a general pyramid format, which looks like this:  |√(x²+y²) +2z| + √(x²+y²) = a  This is a 3D equation using x, y, and z . |x| is the absolute value of x. If this is the pyramid of a circle into 3D, then defining the pyramid of a sphere into 4D would start with a sphere :   √(x²+y²+z²) = a  which then becomes   |√(x²+y²+z²) +2w| + √(x²+y²+z²) = a  for the hypercone. This is a 4D equation using x, y, z, and w. To make it a 3D equation, simply set any dimension to zero, relabel with x,y,z, and you will get a 3D cross section equation:  |√(x²+y²+z²) +2*0| + √(x²+y²+z²) = a  makes a sphere, and  |√(x²+y²+0²) +2z| + √(x²+y²+0²) = a  makes a cone.  But, these are static images, making them boring. We want to move the cross section around to different angles and depths in 4D, since this is still an equation with four ""slots"". Setting the zero to an adjustable parameter, like 'n', will let you slide along 4D:  |√(x²+y²+z²) +2n| + √(x²+y²+z²) = a  makes the sphere larger/smaller, depending on n being positive or negative. n=0 is dead-center.  For even more control, we can use what I call the rotate+translate function by setting  z = (z*sin(b)+a*cos(b))  w = (z*cos(b)-a*sin(b))  leading to   |√(x²+y²+(z*sin(b)+a*cos(b))²) +2(z*cos(b)-a*sin(b))| + √(x²+y²+(z*sin(b)+a*cos(b))²) = a  'a' slides , 'b' rotates in 4D.  Now we have a fully functional 3D equation, that can position the 3D slice to any possible angle and depth in 4D. I use CalcPlot3D, since it is very fast. In the future, I will have interactive webGL files that set everything up for you, just like a desmos link. A new friend of mine is making them."

educationalgifs,394w4j,A7ce,7,Tue Jun 9 17:02:00 2015 UTC,"Absolutely wonderful! To others saying they still don't understand these images, you will eventually, it just takes practice. Nothing in the natural word can prepare you for conceptualizing a 4D object, so all the intuitive approaches you take to thinking about these objects will probably fail. It took me many years of thinking and struggling to imagine these objects before finally ""getting"" it.    What helps is to remember that cross sections of 4D objects are 3D objects.  A 3D object is like a thin slice that you could cut out of a 4D object.  That's exactly what's being illustrated here. For analogy purposes, they are first showing how 2D objects are like slices that you can cut out of a 3D object.  When you see a shape appear out of nowhere, then warp and distort and then disappear, it's because you are looking at successive slices of the 4D object.  It just so happens that each slice is a entire 3D object.  To this day, I think the book Flatland remains the best tool in helping people overcome their 3D bias to better imagine the 4D world."
educationalgifs,394w4j,a4187021,6,Tue Jun 9 14:00:01 2015 UTC,But how do you piece together slices of 4d objects if they're 3d shapes of smoothly changing size? All I can picture is some kind of balloon animal or something.
educationalgifs,394w4j,a4187021,5,Tue Jun 9 14:51:20 2015 UTC,"That's probably the hardest part, and you have to accept that there are some things you just can't picture in your mind with 100% accuracy.   If you start with a roll of quarters and lay them all on a desk, they will look like a series of circles. Now if you try to stack the quarters by putting them side by side on the surface of the desk and lining them up, you will basically get a 2D version of the balloon animal shape you are picturing.    Only by stacking the quarters so that they rise up off the surface of the desk will get you back to a cylinder. The quarters have to leave the 2D space of the desk surface in order to stack.  In a similar fashion, you can't stack 3D objects side by side in 3D space to get the 4D object. You have to stack the objects in a way that uses the 4th Dimension to hold the shapes together. When you are working with 4 spatial dimensions, solid spheres will stack as neatly as coins. Just as smooth coins will stack with no gaps or spaces between them, smooth, solid spheres can stack with no spaces or gaps between them either.    But as you stack the spherical objects, they must disappear from your 3D space, since the 4th dimension is invisible to you.  That's probably the best I can do to explain it. If you are really motivated to understand it, I recommend seeking different explanations. Read as many explanations of this idea as possible, from as many different people as possible. I have found that with really difficult concepts, there is a magic combination of words that is unique to each brain that will unlock the concept for you. There have been many concepts that completely baffled me, no matter how often they were explained, until one day it was explained to me in just the right way using just the right words and full comprehension came like a rush.  Good luck!"

educationalgifs,394w4j,laggingreflex,0,Wed Jun 10 00:33:17 2015 UTC,"It's easier to imagine it as a regular 3D cone. But, instead of circular slices, it will have spherical slices, that get larger/smaller. That's from one direction. Cutting the cone another way, from point to base will make a triangle. A 4D hypercone at this angle will make a whole cone. Sticking off of that cone, in a direction we can't see into (literally), will be the 90 degree scans, that looks like a lens. The cone slices are nearly identical to hypercone slices. But, give your mind a rest for a bit, and come back to it later. It also helps to memorize the animations, and replay it in your mind later. Go back and forth with the cone and hypercone, and the connection will come at some point.   Another thing that may help, is to remember that at each slice of the hypercone, there still exists the rest of the other slices. I imagine them as a ghostly image, since they sit outside the 3D plane, in 4D. What helps with this kind of visual, is playing around with the 2D graph of a 3D cone. Try that out first. Then move on to the hypercone graph in 3D. I recommend using CalcPlot3D , and put this function into an implicit input window:  abs(sqrt(x^2+y^2+(z*sin(b)+a*cos(b))^2) + 2(z*cos(b)-a*sin(b))) + sqrt(x^2+y^2+(z*sin(b)+a*cos(b))^2) = 7  a - moves up/down in 4D , a=0 is the center  b - rotates in 4D, 0 to 1.57 is a 90 degree turn"

Imagine 5 cones, at different angles, anchored still in this ""time dimension"" . The 2D flatland world passes by each one and scans it. Same thing going on in the 3D scans of a hypercone. But, this analogy breaks down when we see the rotating cone stuck in a 2D plane, because time has stopped in that case. Here, the hypercone is modeled in a timeless universe, with four space dimensions only."

educationalgifs,394w4j,boom3r84,0,Tue Jun 9 17:45:11 2015 UTC,"When I think about a 4D time direction, I see it as a space where we can't stop, move backwards, or rotate in. We're kind of just stuck on the 3D cross section (our ""now moment""), as it travels along the time direction. Objects that are still are straight lines, and objects in motion are slanted lines. But, if we have a 4D space dimension, then we will have all the movement controls just like in 3D. The other thing is that this 4D object is finite, meaning it doesn't go on  forever in the 4th dimension. Moving so far in 4D makes the object disappear, while it sits above the 3D plane. The 5-angle scans are the closest analogy to using 4D as time, but not the rotation. The 3D slices are at different levels along 4D, starting from one side of the object to the opposite side."

This releases energy into the water increasing the pressure. The same pressure that slowed down the bullet is now behind and accelerating it slightly faster. The net velocity is still negative because of unrecoverable energy loss like sound.  Source: I'm a goddamn liar  But seriously what I mean is the rate of velocity change increases. So its not linearly going from 800 m/s to 0. Rather it will lose very little velocity in the air and quickly in water. So for example it might lose 1m/s per inch of air, but will lose 50 m/s per inch of water. Its a gross oversimplification but the point is we should see sudden drops not a smooth linear change."

educationalgifs,38w3h3,yellowbluesky,51,Sun Jun 7 10:36:06 2015 UTC,"Would the usage of a rifle calibre such as 5.56mm or .308 significantly increase the penetration through those balloons?  The .44 (correct me if I'm wrong!) the shooter appears to be using is a heavy, slow and blunt round, limiting it's armour penetration abilities.  I'm from a country doesn't that allows gun ownership, so I do not have much knowledge in this area, and I want to learn :P"
educationalgifs,38w3h3,drabtshirt,39,Sun Jun 7 12:57:31 2015 UTC,"There would be a few different things that can affect it. The caliber will effect it, yes, but there's two parts to that alone. The bigger around the bullet, the more surface area it has to be able to disperse it's kinetic energy into what you are shooting at. The second part of the caliber is going to be how much powder is in that specific caliber. Larger amounts of explosive powder means a faster bullet and more energy to disperse. An example of this would be the difference between the .38 special and the .357 magnum calibers. They have the same diameter bullet head, but the .357 magnum has a lot more powder (from the much longer shell casing).  Arguably the most important factor here would be the actual bullet tip itself. The tip itself can highly pointed and covered in hard metal, which is called full metal jacket (or FMJ), which is meant for penetration of armor or other hard materials. The one that is used in the video seemed to be hollow point, which is meant to expand outward for maximum damage to a soft target but has very little penetration power.  I hope this helps! If you need any clarification, don't hesitate to ask!  Source: I live in Texas."
educationalgifs,38w3h3,mobydickenson,7,Sun Jun 7 13:41:50 2015 UTC,"Everything you said makes sense, thank you very much  for taking the time to reply to me :)  Also, I didn't know that .38 Special and .357 magnum were actually the same caliber; assuming a capable gun (frame string enough to withstand the higher power cartridge) can they be used interchangeably?"
educationalgifs,38w3h3,yellowbluesky,8,Sun Jun 7 13:48:15 2015 UTC,"The difference between the two cartridges is the length. .357mag is longer than .38 special so to answer your question, yes. However a weapon chambered for .38 special cannot fire .357mag because the round would not fit. Here's something else I noticed the previous replier didn't mention. You asked about the rounds being ""blunt."" .357mag, .44mag, .454 casull, .45-47govt, .500s&w, etc. all have a blunt tip because they were designed to be used in pistols and lever guns like the Winchester. When you're stacking rounds in the magazine of a lever gun for safety reason the rounds are purposely like that because the rounds go in tip to primer. If the bullet had a point and the lever gun was dropped one of the tipped rounds could strike a primer and discharge a round. This would obviously destroy the rifle and be an all around bad time."
educationalgifs,38w3h3,mobydickenson,3,Sun Jun 7 14:32:36 2015 UTC,"In revolvers or anything that uses a standard .357 chamber cylinder, yes. Anything that uses a magazine, no, because the .357 magnum is a much longer shell (the same length as the .44 magnum or the .50 Action Express). Also, a .410 gauge shotgun shell and a .45 ACP caliber handgun bullet are the same diameter, but it typically requires specific craftsmanship to fire those interchangeably, such a the Taurus Judge revolver.  Edit: the 38 special is also not to be confused with the .380 auto. The .380 auto is a small round typically used in concealed self defense pistols  Oh, and forgot one last thing. Anything that is chambered for 5.56 NATO is interchangeable with .223 Remington, but not vice versa (you CAN use it, but there are some negative wear and tear effects on the gun).  Here are a couple of images that might help visualize it all:  .357 v .38  Comparison of many different handgun calibers  And last but certainly not least, rifle calibers  Bonus Taurus Judge picture"

I initially though that they'd be shotgun hulls but that didn't make a lot of sense"
educationalgifs,38w3h3,mobydickenson,3,Mon Jun 8 00:13:50 2015 UTC,"They actually are shotgun shells. This was the gun I was talking about above that can fire both .45 ACP and .410 gauge shotgun shells interchangeably. It has a 5 round capacity, and if I wanted to, I could put the shotgun shells and the .45 rounds in the same cylinder and fire them alternately.  Funny story about the Judge, I had a friend whose mother was afraid of the kick on a gun, and a  2 3/4"" .410 gauge shell kicks considerably less than the .45 ACP, so he loaded four bullets - alternating between the two - into the gun. He fired the first round, the .410, and said ""look! It doesn't kick at all! What are you so afraid of?"" and then he gave it to her. She fired the next round, the .45 ACP and the gun almost flew out of her hand while she screamed ""HOLY SHIT"". My friend then proceeded to fire the next round, and said ""mom, you're just way too weak"" :P"
educationalgifs,38w3h3,Nitrogen_triiodide,2,Mon Jun 8 01:15:51 2015 UTC,"They are shotgun shells, which doesn't always make sense but in Texas it does.  Actually I think they are intended for personal defense,  but someone else may correct me."
educationalgifs,38w3h3,RufftaMan,2,Mon Jun 8 00:24:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they're made for self defense. If you're using the shell, this is the PDX Defender round, one of the more common self defense loads which utilizes both coin shot and bird shot for maximum stopping power. In terms of self defense, penetration is actually bad. If the round penetrates through the bad guy, then you've wasted kinetic energy on whatever is behind him, but if it stops in him, that means you've utilized the maximum possible kinetic energy to do damage.  TL;DR don't penetrate the bad guy with your bullets or he will penetrate you with something just as unpleasant."

educationalgifs,38w3h3,yellowbluesky,4,Sun Jun 7 14:33:49 2015 UTC,"Also: Above a certain velocity the bullet will break up at the air-water interface, which signifficantly reduces its penetration capability.

educationalgifs,38w3h3,9513574628,2,Mon Jun 8 02:29:23 2015 UTC,"Yes. Pistol rounds tend to be flatter-nosed, less designed for aerodynamic (and in this case, hydrodynamic) efficiency than for sheer hole-making potential. A plain ""wadcutter"" (a solid pistol bullet with a wide, flat nose) would slow very quickly in water compared to a 5.56 or .308 round, despite it's smaller total surface area, because its hydrodynamic properties are terrible.  With hollow point rounds, the question becomes much more complicated... A pistol round that ""blooms"" would slow very quickly in water, and a hollow point rifle round can even shatter into fragments when it hits water."

educationalgifs,38w3h3,Brobi_WanKenobi,15,Sun Jun 7 14:57:14 2015 UTC,"It looks like the bullet just came out the bottom of the 4th balloon rather than actually stopping.  If a person had been standing behind the 4th balloon, they still would have been hit in the legs.  Or if the 5th balloon had been a little lower, it still would have popped. The velocities they display are also obviously made up.  It says the final velocity is ""1"" (no units, and I'm assuming they meant ""0"").  If that were the case, the bullet would simply fall straight down, but you can see that it is still travelling forward from the way the balloon stretches as the bullet exits.  What is this from, anyway?"
educationalgifs,38w3h3,kevinstonge,4,Sun Jun 7 15:18:15 2015 UTC,"What's strange is that it looks like two separate tests. The first one the holes from the bullet are made in the top half of the balloon - you can clearly see where the water is shooting out and the impacts are made. In the second the holes are made way toward the bottom of the balloons, especially the last one. Neither of them look remotely similar to each other. They don't even pop the same."

educationalgifs,38w3h3,Steprichn,60,Sun Jun 7 11:55:05 2015 UTC,"Much of the momentum loss appears to be from the rubber stretching and absorbing energy for extended periods of time. Each balloon provides two rubber barriers for the bullet to penetrate - obviously it takes out the first couple barriers effortlessly, but as soon as the bullet starts to slow down each layer of rubber can hold on for longer and longer.  edit 2: I didn't say ALL of the momentum is absorbed by the rubber, obviously the water plays a major role, I've seen the bloody Mythbusters episode, I'm just pointing out how surprised I am that the rubber of the balloons appears to be doing a significant portion of the work slowing that bullet down.  Certainly the water plays an important role due to its increased density; but I'd be curious just how much farther a bullet would get passing through balloons filled with air.  Finally, a point of interest - the bullet getting lower and lower with each balloon is mainly due to gravity - a bullet fired from a gun should fall towards the ground at almost the same rate that a bullet dropped from a hand would - gravity pulls them both down with equal force, so you get to witness the projectile motion of a flying bullet in this video, which is pretty nice (effect enhanced due to the decreasing velocity).  edit: added the last 2 'paragraphs'"
educationalgifs,38w3h3,Zarokima,119,Sun Jun 7 10:13:28 2015 UTC,But the water has a huge effect too. It takes only 1 meter of diving depth to be safe from most bullet caliber types. Thats why you need harpoons or something else with much more mass to get an effective underwater projectile weapon.
educationalgifs,38w3h3,hakkzpets,5,Sun Jun 7 10:19:55 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, but I was comparing that figure in my head with the apparent distance traveled by the bullet in this video and it seemed quite distant. I'd say in this video the bullet traveled through maybe 30 or 40 cm of water, the mythbusters video on this showed that bullets can generally travel 1-2 meters, so I suspect that the rubber is playing a larger than expected role in slowing the bullet down."
educationalgifs,38w3h3,tehdave86,18,Sun Jun 7 10:27:44 2015 UTC,"But these are separate bodies of water, the rubber may have the effect it has because it is holding water. Each time the bullet penetrates each balloon  it meets the resistance of each body of water at the surface of the object which has its own effect - not so much the work of the rubber on its own."
educationalgifs,38w3h3,donthatemecuzisuck,19,Sun Jun 7 13:49:32 2015 UTC,"The water also absorbs more momentum than air, and acts to keep the rubber cool so it stretches better. I'd bet that if the balloons were full of air, the bullet would burn right through the rubber of the first several with minimal stretching."

educationalgifs,38w3h3,Mr_Lobster,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:44:51 2015 UTC,"That has more to do with preservation of angular momentum. A spinning bullet has an angular momentum axis coincident with its path, and changing the direction of that axis takes energy."
educationalgifs,38w3h3,autowikibot,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:01:49 2015 UTC,"This is true because the spin causes all of the bullet's imperfections to act in all directions equally around its circumference, which keeps the nose and tail pointed in the direction of travel and presenting the optimal aerodynamic profile to the wind resistance; this allows it to maintain more velocity and thus drop less per unit distance (though not unit time).

educationalgifs,38w3h3,nickiter,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:21:46 2015 UTC,"Section 1. Newton's approximation for the impact depth of article  Impact depth:       Newton's approximation for the impact depth for projectiles at high velocities is based only on momentum considerations. Nothing is said about where the impactor's kinetic energy goes, nor what happens to the momentum after the projectile is stopped.  The basic idea is simple: The impactor carries a given momentum. To stop the impactor, this momentum must be transferred onto another mass. Since the impactor's velocity is so high that cohesion within the target material can be neglected, the momentum can only be transferred to the material (mass) directly in front of the impactor, which will be pushed at the impactor's speed. If the impactor has pushed a mass equal to its own mass at this speed, its whole momentum has been transferred to the mass in front of it and the impactor will be stopped. For a cylindrical impactor, by the time it stops, it will have penetrated to a depth that is equal to its own length times its relative density with respect to the target material.  This approach only holds for a blunt impactor [citation needed] (no aerodynamical shape) and a target material with no fibres (no cohesion), at least not at the impactor's speed. This is usually true if the impactor's speed is much higher than the speed of sound within the target material. At such high velocities, most materials start to behave like a fluid. It is then important that the projectile stays in a compact shape during impact (no spreading).

First episode I've ever seen, one of them drove a car into a lake and almost drowned, another one lit their buddy on fire -purposefully- with what seems to be a makeshift flamethrower. Now they just drove a truck through a 'tower' of camping trailers that seem to have been filled with explosives. A piece of a plank stuck fast through the windshield and stopped about 3''  away from the passenger's chest.   It's really a wonder some of these guys only broke their back."

Here is a video which shows the process: https://youtu.be/5OsKyG65SUk?t=99  If you look closely you can see the thread pass in front of where the bobbin goes and also through the holes you can see where it would pass behind the bobbin.

educationalgifs,38cy19,heiferly,2,Wed Jun 3 18:11:27 2015 UTC,"The extra screen with infrared output and inputs and computer processing for extra switches that we needed on my chair was $15,000 alone ... not counting the switch we needed it for, nor the custom mounting for that switch which was hellacious because the chairs aren't designed to have a switch mounted on the end of the armrest perpendicular to the floor. (We then encountered further issues because I've got mounts for my service dog's adaptive leash on either side of my lap so I get tactile feedback of how much tension is on the leash across my thighs and can adjust my speed and verbal commands to him accordingly ... well, what we didn't anticipate was that during certain working commands of his where he's up on my lap, his leash could catch on the button that was tenuously on the end of the armrest at best. The final solution was a custom made metal bracket that protected the button from bumps and from getting caught on leashes, cords, etc. but still allowed my fingers to fit in comfortably to operate the button for long periods of time.)   So yeah, that button and it's electronics were an expense. The telescoping footrest was an expense and we added a custom loop/strap to that so that I could reach the loop and pull the footrest up by myself to make transfers more independent. The latches for my service dog were another custom expense. The IV pole to keep my feeding pump and IV hydration with me was another custom mod and added expense. The high quality headrest, because I have to spend a lot of time in full recline due to severe orthostatic intolerance, I believe that was one of the bigger expenses. It's truly amazing how quickly these items add up! I mean, even the batteries are insane. There's 2 batteries in there and compared to what we pay for car batteries or scooter batteries if you just buy them in a non-medical context ... yeah, the markup for medical equipment is staggering.   I'm fortunate not to need head controls, as I've seen with several of my friends, not only are they expensive, but they're also a pain to get fixed because you're pretty much bedridden until they fix your chair. When your level of assistance is that involved and personalized, you can't just get a loaner chair to muddle through until yours is fixed. I had one friend who was stuck in bed for several WEEKS while insurance battled it out over whether to repair or replace his chair."

In order to climb stairs, it requires the user to have a lot of upper body strength and range of motion to pull on handrails, but the sort of person who uses a power chair generally doesn't have that sort of strength/range of motion.  Also, if I remember correctly, they were around $40,000 each, and insurance rarely covered them.  Basically, the only people I ever saw actually using them were a few veterans."

educationalgifs,38cy19,PandaHammer,2,Wed Jun 3 17:56:46 2015 UTC,"I have one of the IR control arrays on my chair so that it can control an extra switch on the left armrest end. That's a ""dummy switch"" so that when I have either my episodes of syncope (fainting) or status cataplecticus (temporary full-body flaccid paralysis that comes on without warning and lasts up to several days at a time), my had will fall off that button as I lose postural tone and it immediately kills power to the whole chair, preventing me from getting gravely injured by lurching forward on the controls and motoring full speed into a wall or worse yet, traffic.   I think having this extra IR controls unit adds a lot more flexibility for projects like this, but we really haven't explored all the capabilities yet. My husband is a ""tinkerer"" with robotics, computer hardware and programming, and cars, so I figure when this chair is worn out and I get a replacement, we'll be free to pimp this one however we want. I just am too skiddish to do any custom mods on it when it's my only power chair and I know anything we do to it might void the warranty.   Thanks for the information on this project. I'm sending it to my husband to see what he thinks. I've also met with some folks who do pioneering work in assistive tech at Ohio State, so I may talk this through with one of my contacts there and see if that gets me anywhere.

educationalgifs,38cy19,sue-dough-nim,2,Wed Jun 3 23:03:07 2015 UTC,"That dummy switch is a fantastic idea.  I haven't come across anything like that, as I haven't worked with anyone who had any form of narcolepsy or similar issues.  I'll definitely remember it if I ever see a need for it.  You can do all sorts of things with the IR output, generally without much worry of causing any problems with your chair.  It's been a while, so I don't remember the specifics of the R-Net (Permobil/Quickie) IR setup, but I believe the Quantum ones let you ""teach"" them new IR signals, and I think maybe the R-Net does something similar.  So you could hold up a remote to it, hold down a button, and the chair learns the signal for that button.  With that, you can teach the chair to control pretty much anything that can take an IR input, from TVs and stereos, to computers via IR wireless keyboard, etc.  With a little USB-IR receiver (like this one ), you could do pretty much anything."

educationalgifs,382vi2,tenhotuisku,3,Tue Jun 2 10:31:39 2015 UTC,"This is a color printer which uses quite coarse powder. Non-colored prints are much more detailed. Also, since the powder supports the weight of the model while it's printing you don't need to add support structures."
educationalgifs,382vi2,backfacecull,2,Tue Jun 2 12:56:21 2015 UTC,Could you give an example as to why this method of 3d printing would be used over traditional additive processes with say PLA?
educationalgifs,382vi2,SLIGHTLY_UPSETTING,3,Tue Jun 2 13:46:52 2015 UTC,"Color replication is one of the key ones. Powder printing also does not require supports because the powder is the printing support. In filament, resin and jetting printing, you have to have supports that will need to be removed for more complex or angular models.  edit: funnily enough, filament printing did not come until later in the game, this was one of the original forms of 3D printing from back in the 80s"
educationalgifs,382vi2,backfacecull,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:15:46 2015 UTC,"Imagine you wanted to print a spherical object. With plastic extrusion printing, as the print moves up higher and higher it will become unstable (it's balancing on a very small area) and the edges will tend to sag under their own weight, creating a high probability that the print will warp or fail completely.  With this method, the powder supports the sides of the sphere as it grows. You can even print one object inside another like this:  http://images4.sw-cdn.net/model/picture/625x465_668389_554877_1429680737.jpg  Obviously this wouldn't be possible with PLA printing as the interior sphere would need to be connected to the exterior."

educationalgifs,382vi2,zoidbergVII,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:40:47 2015 UTC,"I assume all these results for hobby use are correct. Although the main problem with FDM is that the parts are highly anistropic, meaning there mechanical properties in the X and Y direction are OK but the Z is terrible.  A lot of research is going into using industrial grade polymers and metal in a process which results in highly dense isotropic part.  This process linked is purely used for nice looking parts, the first prototypes were identical to a inkjet printer except the black ink was remove and replaced with an adhesive."
educationalgifs,382vi2,zoidbergVII,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:14:41 2015 UTC,"Try not to confuse this process with the completely different Laser Sintering process.   3D printing (name of the process, not to be confused with Objet Inkjet priting) was actually named before ""3D Printing"" became the name for all Additive Manufacturing (Rapid Prototyping, SFF, FFF, Layer based etc). It is inkjet printing onto a typically inert powder with a binder and colour, this part is later hardened typically with a CA.  Laser sintering is a very interesting process, which is possible of producing almost fully dense parts from industrial polymers without the need for support which have high mechanical properties."

educationalgifs,37yboz,TheOldAmanda,15,Sun May 31 21:51:14 2015 UTC,"If you're standing by a railroad or busy street, the sound of passing vehicles will change pitch as they pass you"
educationalgifs,37yboz,salmonmarine,3,Sun May 31 16:27:42 2015 UTC,"Sound is vibrations.  Vibrations through the air travel at a certain speed, more or less (wind can make a difference for the same reasons as this gif).  When an object is moving towards you it, in a way, ""catches-up"" a bit to the last vibration it emitted.  Similarly, moving away from you makes it ""run-away"" from the last sound it emitted.  Pitch is frequency... as in literally the frequency of the vibrations striking your ear drum.  If something is chasing it's own sounds (coming towards you) then the distance between each vibration through the air as it reaches you is shortened.  That is to say, the frequency of the vibrations is greater, the pitch is higher.  When something is moving away the frequency of the sound it makes is elongated so the pitch is lower... the frequency of strikes against your eardrum is lower.  Just as a piston in a motorcycle engine revving faster creates a higher pitch in the motor, as does any other sound where the source generating that sound is moving towards you.  As an aside - Volume is the ""force"" of each strike."
educationalgifs,37yboz,GlowInTheDarkDonkey,3,Sun May 31 16:58:57 2015 UTC,"The car's engine/siren releases noise in the form of sound waves. When a car moves forward, the sound waves in front of the car get closer together because the car is progressively moving closer to the sound waves. The closer the sound waves are to each other, the higher the frequency, and thus pitch, of the noise. The waves from the back of the car get increasingly farther apart since the car is moving away from them, so their frequency/pitch is lower.

Think about that in the context of formal lines of battle and T crossing and other organized warfare at a distance.  Without knowing the specifics, it sounds like someone ordering a banzai charge at an entrenched enemy force.  But Nelson knew the specifics, and his ships and crews demolished the enemy fleet.

If the lines were too close but there was room to do so, Red could do the opposite of the above bullet points, going port to fight or starboard to flee. Assuming Red done fucked up and got truly crossed, the last hope in this GIF is all-ahead flank and try to split the crossing, enabling more Red guns to join the fight. Red 1 is likely DOA, but re-crossing Blue would turn the advantage to Red.  By the way, for folks complaining about the formation, it was customary to sail this way as different ships had different capabilities, much like navies today, but gun support had to be maintained, hence the bunching.

educationalgifs,37uwhh,UNC_Samurai,29,Sat May 30 17:40:11 2015 UTC,He used a related concept called Raking fire.
educationalgifs,37uwhh,fishgoesmoo,13,Sat May 30 18:19:11 2015 UTC,"Raking fire:       In sailing naval warfare, raking fire is fire directed parallel to the long axis of an enemy ship from ahead or astern. Although each shot is directed against a smaller target profile than by shooting broadside and thus more likely to miss the target ship to one side or the other, an individual cannon shot that hits will pass through more of the ship, thereby increasing damage to the hull, sails, cannon and crew. In addition, the targeted ship will have fewer (if any) guns able to return fire. A stern rake tends to be more damaging than a bow rake because the shots are not deflected by the curved (and strengthened) bow.  Achieving a position to rake a single enemy ship was usually very difficult unless the opponent was unable to manoeuvre due to damage to the sails or rudder. It was easier if a ship was constrained by its position in the line of battle.    Image i - French frigate Poursuivante firing raking fire on the British ship of the line HMS Hercule in the action of 28 June 1803.

educationalgifs,37uwhh,Atanar,4,Sat May 30 19:17:31 2015 UTC,"But more deadly.  If you've ever seen the interior of HMS Victory, there's not a lot of space between decks.    I wish I could put my hands on the source for this, but I'd likely spend all night looking through my library: If a 100-gun ship-of-the-line can fire a volley and have 10% of its shot hit and penetrate the stem or stern, the ship receiving fire will typically lose a quarter to a third of its gun crew.  This is because round shot is subsonic, and will bounce off any of the interior frame timbers it comes in contact with.    Humans, on the other hand, don't do a lot to slow down a ball, but the shot likes to take bits with it.  There's an excellent scene in the otherwise-awful The Patriot movie with Mel Gibson, where some yokel sticks his foot out to stop a cannonball, and suddenly his foot is gone; it's exactly like that, but the ship's interior turns it into a very bloody game of pinball.  Also, keep in mind that a gun crew on a ship-of-the-line requires 7-10 men, and if you take out a third of those, you increase the time it takes to fire the gun.  A fully manned ship can fire a broadside about once every three minutes.  If a significant portion of the gun crews are at reduced strength, that number increases to once every 4/5/6 minutes, at which point the ship which fired a raking volley has a clear advantage.    All this is just accounting for crew losses, and doesn't take into account what damage the hull would be taking as well."

educationalgifs,37uwhh,cardevitoraphicticia,5,Sun May 31 00:40:03 2015 UTC,"Sort of - there were a lot of factors involved, but yeah, he basically ignored standard naval doctrine at the time, to form a ""line of battle"" with all your ships strung out horizontally, engaging the opposite ships, allowing neighboring ships to protect your flanks.    Instead, he said ""F it"" and charged through the Spanish line - Nelson's lead ship(s) took some serious punishment, but they survived, and once the English ships were into the Spanish line they were able to dominate because so many of the Spanish ships were stuck out at the ""ends"" of the line, unable to get into the action in time to do any good.  As stated elsewhere in the thread, English sailors were also generally better trained than the Spanish at the time, and English gunners were trained to ""rake"" (basically a miniature one-on-one version of 'crossing the T' so that your broadside is firing the entire length of the enemy ship while it can only reply with whatever fore or aft guns it has) the decks with grape and canister shot, to inflict the maximum damage to opposing gunners and sailers (and officers).  Spanish (and French) gunners typically aimed high to disable rigging and sails.  Once the English ships were in amongst the Spanish it turned into a bloodbath in which the English absolutely dominated the Spanish.  There's a great book about Nelson at Trafalgar (doesn't go into great detail about the tactics of the day, per se, but it's fascinating reading nonetheless) called Seize the Fire, by Adam Nicolson."

This is because, while ships did sometimes have fore and aft guns, the guns were predominantly mounted on the sides. This means, of course, that having the ships in a horizontal line would be completely counterproductive, and so ships tended to move in vertical lines. ""Crossing the T"" takes advantage of this tendency, however note that it was only really in use before steam powered vessels became widespread."
educationalgifs,37uwhh,phaseoffset,7,Sat May 30 17:59:09 2015 UTC,"Line of battle:       In naval warfare, the line of battle is a tactic in which a naval fleet of ships forms a line end to end. Its first use is disputed, variously claimed for dates ranging from 1502 to 1652, with line-of-battle tactics in widespread use by 1675.  Compared with prior naval tactics, in which two opposing ships closed on one another for individual combat, the line of battle has the advantage that each ship in the line can fire its broadside without fear of hitting a friendly ship. Therefore, in a given period, the fleet can fire more shots.  Another advantage is that a relative movement of the line in relation to some part of the enemy fleet allows for a systematic concentration of fire on that part. The other fleet can avoid this by maneuvering in a line itself, with a result typical for sea battle since 1675: two fleets sail alongside one another or in opposite tack.

educationalgifs,37uwhh,Freya-Freed,12,Sat May 30 21:55:16 2015 UTC,"Section 2. Battles of article  Crossing the T:       Notable battles in which warships crossed the T include:   Battle of Tsushima (1905) – Japanese Admiral Togo, by use of wireless communications and the proper deployment of reconnaissance had positioned his fleet in such a way as to bring the Russian fleet to battle, ""irrespective of speeds.""  Togo had preserved for himself the interior lines of movement, while forcing the longer lines of movement upon his opponent, whichever course the Russian admiral should take; and by his selected positioning had the effect of ""throwing the Russian broadsides more and more out of action.""  ""He had headed him""  (crossed his T). The Russian admiral, other than retreat or surrender, had no other option(s) other than ""charging Togo's battle line"" or ""accepting a formal pitched battle.""  Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky chose the latter, resulting in his total defeat in naval history's only decisive fleet action fought solely by modern battleships. Rozhestvensky was severely wounded during the battle, and was taken prisoner. Seven battleships were sunk and one was captured by the Japanese. Battle of Elli (1912) – Rear Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis aboard the Greek cruiser Georgios Averof at a speed of 20 knots crossed the T of the Turkish fleet on December 13, 1912. The Averof concentrated her fire against the Ottoman flagship, forcing the Turks to retreat. Battle of Jutland (1916) – Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, leader of the British Grand Fleet, was able to cross the T twice against the German High Seas Fleets, but the German Fleet was both times able to escape by reversing course in poor visibility. Although the High Seas Fleet was thereby rendered strategically impotent, being unwilling to face the Grand Fleet again, the British were unable to gain the crushing ""Second Trafalgar"" they had desired. Jutland is sometimes referred to as the Battle of Lost Opportunities. Battle of Cape Esperance (1942) – First United States (U.S.) naval night battle victory over the Japanese when a U.S. force of cruisers and destroyers under Norman Scott crossed the T of a cruiser–destroyer force under Aritomo Gotō. Gotō's force was approaching Guadalcanal on October 11, 1942 to bombard Henderson Field in support of a Tokyo Express reinforcement mission when it was surprised and defeated by Scott's force in a confused night battle. Goto died of his wounds shortly after the battle, and lost the cruiser Furutaka along with three destroyers. Battle of Surigao Strait (1944) – The last time a battle line crossed the T, this engagement took place during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, in the Philippines during World War II. Early on October 25, 1944, Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf was guarding the southern entrance to the Leyte Gulf at the northern end of Surigao Strait. He commanded a line of six battleships (West Virginia, Tennessee, California, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Mississippi), flanked by numerous heavy and light cruisers. A smaller Japanese force under Vice Admiral Shoji Nishimura came up the strait, aware of the formidable strength of the American force but nonetheless pressing on. Half of Nishimura's fleet was eliminated by the Americans' destroyer torpedoes, but the Japanese admiral continued on with his remaining few ships. Oldendorf's battleships were arrayed in a line, and they unleashed their radar-directed fire-power upon Japanese vessels, whose return fire was ineffectual due to the lack of radar fire control and earlier battle damage. Nishimura went down with his ship. Despite this however, Yamashiro's guns, along with cruiser Mogami managed to severely damage an American destroyer. This was the last time the 'T' was crossed in an engagement between battleships, and the last occasion on which battleships fought each other.

So naval leadership gets squeamish about losing even obsolete units.    I really want him to do a follow-up podcast for the non-naval historians put there on the arms race, the ""Jeune École"", and why navies settled on three major tiers of surface vessels."
educationalgifs,37uwhh,autowikibot,16,Sun May 31 02:28:20 2015 UTC,"During the age of sail naval battles were often decided by whoever could bring the most guns to bear at once for a devastating volley of fire.   For a single ship this meant that ideally it would want to broad side the enemy, ie. have it's long side facing the enemy so all it's cannon could be brought to bear.  Even better if your broadside could face their stern or aft. That would mean cannonballs would fly all the way down the length of their ship for massive damage.  Since volume of fire was so important, warships started being constructed with multiple decks of cannons increasing the importance of broadsides.  And what works well for a single ship works well for a fleet. Leading to the development of the ship of the line. Massive warships with many stacked gun decks intended to fight in single files, preferably in a slight U shape around the enemy fleet.  A broadside from a line of these ships would wreak massive destruction on the target. Crossing the T so to speak minimized risk while maximizing damage."

educationalgifs,37uwhh,qa2,9,Sat May 30 17:46:58 2015 UTC,"It also doesn't always work. In the battle of Trafalgar, to avoid slogging it out with the opposing forces, british admiral Nelson split his force into two columns and sailed straight at the French/Spanish line. They took heavy fire trying to do so (The French/Spanish fleet was now crossing their T). However, when making contact the two columns split the French/Spanish line in 3 parts, surrounding one third of it entirely.  This basically won them the battle and ensured British naval dominance for the rest of the war. Though the plan was largely succesful because of British training and French incompetence."
educationalgifs,37uwhh,Galactic,10,Sat May 30 22:43:50 2015 UTC,"Battle of Tsushima between the Empire of Japan and the Russian Empire is probably the textbook example of the maneuver. The Japanese Combined Fleet under Admiral Togo crossed the T twice against the Russian Fleet with devastating effect. Japan only lost 3 torpedo boats and 117 dead, while Russia suffered 4380 dead and 5,917 captured. Russian ship losses (including sunk or captured) were eleven battleships, four cruisers, six destroyers, and six auxiliary ships."
educationalgifs,37uwhh,jz88k,3,Sat May 30 22:41:43 2015 UTC,"well, it was common naval practice for a very long time and for a good reason. In a time period when all a ship's guns were on the sides if all the friendly and enemy ships were all maneuvering around each other in close combat it was very difficult to make sure your shots landing on the enemy and not a friendly. so if your ships all sailed into battle in a strait line they could more easily avoid friendly fire. Also it allowed a whole fleet to focus fire on important targets, allowing a fleet to maximize their firepower. so often naval battles became two lines of ships slithering around each other trying to gain an advantage. Usually this advantage came in the form of one line ""crossing the T"" of the other because they had better maneuverability or just favorable winds. It took a bit of time for the navies of the world to realize that turreted guns and, later, the dominance of naval aviation made traditional naval combat tactics obsolete so many fleets still sailed into combat in the ""line of battle"" up until just before World War Two."

Development of article  Line of battle:       The first recorded mention of the use of a line of battle tactic is attested from 1500. The Instructions provided in 1500 by King Manuel I of Portugal to the commander of a fleet dispatched to the Indian Ocean suggests its use predated the written instructions. Portuguese fleets overseas deployed in line ahead, firing one broadside and then putting about in order to return and discharge the other, resolving battles by gunnery alone. In a treatise of 1555, The Art of War at Sea, Portuguese theorist on naval warfare and shipbuilding, Fernão de Oliveira, recognized that at sea, the Portuguese ""fight at a distance, as if from walls and fortresses..."". He recommended the single line ahead as the ideal combat formation.

educationalgifs,37uwhh,rockoman100,2,Sat May 30 21:11:58 2015 UTC,"This maneuver was only really effective if you could disable the ship before bottom of the ""T"" crossed the top of the ""T"". If not then you became the ones who would be under serious attack.  Nelson showed the prime example of how being the initial bottom of the T pays off in the long run.  Most of the time ships did this as a secondary maneuver and not as their first line of attack. Or they would do this as an additional ship coming into the battle, or if they were hidden by smoke or something. It wasn't ideal and was not something the captain used as a viable means of initial attack.  The best possible scenario was to ""rake"" a ship. Most diagrams show this as the attacking ship is basically 90 degrees from the other ship, but that's not entirely accurate, since it would have been difficult/impossible for the guns on the ends (bow and stern) of the ship to point that far toward the middle. The ideal location was a bit away from the ship and to try and get into a position where it was most difficult/impossible for the enemy ship to hit you, but you were able to hit them with your entire broadside.  As an added bonus a well manned ship would be able to fire one complete broadside, then tack, or turn the ship slightly so that the other broadside came to bear and they could fire the second side of the ship with little work. Heaving back and forth like that until the enemy surrendered, which wasn't long.  The Best I could do to show it. I supposed I could dig out my game and make a better example. Maybe tonight.

educationalgifs,37uwhh,____DEADPOOL_______,2,Sat May 30 21:29:03 2015 UTC,"I love the Trafalgar discussion, the whole subject is fascinating.  If you're interested, go out and get the first few books in the ""Horatio Hornblower"" series and start reading; they were based on a character similar to Admiral Nelson, and are a wonderful read on naval concepts of that era, as well as being enjoyable in their own right.  I also love the ""Honor Harrington"" series, which is basically a science fiction version of the Horatio Hornblower series, and also very enjoyable.  What's most interesting about all of this is that crossing the T isn't just a naval doctrine.  If you learn aikido or several other martial arts, when they discuss techniques for defending against multiple assailants, they often focus on ways to force assailants to block one another.  This sounds kind of bizarre until you actually think about it.  If three people are attacking you, the best position you can be in is to have two of them behind the third, so that only the third can actually touch you.  And by maneuvering yourself, and using grabs and throws to maneuver the assailants, that's less impossible than merely difficult.  This is a demonstration video using low speeds and virtually no physical force, and I'm not saying it would work great in practice, but watch closely at how the instructor is constantly throwing one attacker in the way of another one:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeTtkmRuIfw  At 0:15 he's facing 4 assailants in 4 different directions.  At 0:17 he's facing 4 assailants in 2 different directions, with two of them lined up behind a third he's controlling by a grab.  He basically grabbed one guy and used him as a human shield against two others.  Then he does it again at 0:19, and again at 0:25.  I mean, yeah, that looks like a BS demonstration.  But it's actually the exact strategy that Nelson went into Trafalgar with.  ""...in case signals can neither be seen or perfectly understood, no captain can do very wrong if he places his ship alongside that of the enemy.""  That was Nelson's standing order to his captains when they went into battle.  It argued that their ships, having superior construction and crews, would actually be safer in close range combat than they would be getting plinked at out in the open.  One reason is that, at close range, you'll be using enemy ships as shields against other enemy ships.  His fleet did exactly that, and it absolutely demolished the French and Spanish fleet it faced.  You can also do this, as strange as it sounds, in most first person shooter games, like Counterstrike or the Call of Duty and Battlefield franchises.  If you get caught out in the open in a close range shootout with multiple enemies in those games, try to strafe around so that at least one of them has to shoot through their own teammate to hit you.  Usually they can't, so you'll now only be taking fire from one dude instead of two or three.  And unlike theirs, your bullets will probably go through their teammate and hit them.  It's a last ditch option and doesn't always work, but it doesn't always fail either."

educationalgifs,37uwhh,Catchmeifyoucan89,3,Sun May 31 08:47:43 2015 UTC,"Look, this is misrepresenting what actually happens, what happened at the Nile, at Trafalgar, on the Glorious First of June. Your basic ideas are correct; going to the bow and aft of a ship in order to 'rake' ships is the desired effect.  But there's so much more that makes it far more logical. At Trafalgar and the Glorious First of June especially, each ship would split up as it hit the main enemy line, and this would often be FAR from above them. Essentially, the British would sail STRAIGHT AT THE FRENCH/SPANISH LINE OF BATTLE. Exposing themselves to long-range firing allowed them to cut off parts of the fleet, as it is very difficult to turn around and some ships, such as at Trafalgar, were a long way ahead of the fight. After 'crossing the t', each ship would horrendously rake the enemy, essentially trading long range endurance for a series of brutal, close range blows.  Trafalgar had two columns, both 'crossing the t', and many of the ships essentially paired off, though the term is inadequate. Some ships were exposed to fire from three or four ships, while others essentially pounded at each other for the duration.  I understand what you're trying to do, but it's kind of like explaining World War 2 with 'the Russians won it'. Yeah, but there's so much more to it than that."

This would be a great exercise to show why interior angles and exterior angles are not equal.  Besides, if I were to walk along the lines of a shape, the view I would have would be that of the exterior angles' side. Try it. Make any regular polygon out in your yard. Walk along the path. How many degrees did you turn? I bet you it is 360°.

educationalgifs,37qu1e,BlueberryQuick,125,Fri May 29 17:54:12 2015 UTC,From original post Nate linked:   it's a silage bale. Hay is dried/wilted grass - baled 3-7 days after being cut depending on weather conditions. It is then left unwrapped in storage. It doesn't decompose in storage provided its kept dry. If it is stored wet or gets wet while being stored it rots. Silage on the other hand is wrapped while still green/wet like in this gif - 1 or 2 days after being cut. The lack of air and the still respiring grass causes the silage to ferment and preserve - giving it the smell that /u/gurgaue[1] mentioned
educationalgifs,37qu1e,csthopper,5,Fri May 29 17:57:43 2015 UTC,"Thats... Weird. Around here, they use huge plastic tubes. The hay is chopped smaller and pushed into the tube with, basically a bulldozer, and the plastic is pulled around it like a sausage casing or condom. So you end up with a long plastic tube stuffed full of hay that ferments in to silage and keeps longer to feed your livestock."

Your grandfather likely didn't have any silage, which is different than hay, as it would dry out rather than ferment, or he kept it in a silo.  Silos are more likely to develop algae blooms or bacteria, and are dangerous, which is why the plastic is now preferred.  edit: clarity.

educationalgifs,37qu1e,99drumdude,18,Fri May 29 19:25:20 2015 UTC,This seems so wasteful. Around here - eastern US - farmers use a trailer that will gather the cut hay and roll it into a large cylindrical type bale that is held together without plastic or ties. Also there are similar types that use twine to hold a smaller square bale together.

educationalgifs,37qu1e,Day_Bow_Bow,8,Fri May 29 23:04:30 2015 UTC,The same reason as to why they were wrapping the bales:  to provide a place for the silage to ferment and thus preserve itself.

Nowadays, they do have other methods such as bunkers and bags and bales that are easier to work with machines.  These typically use synthetic tarps or the like to make it airtight.  But back in the day, they used the tall tower silos that you are likely thinking of.  And yes, they would climb in there and use a silage fork to unload it.  And yes, I am sure it was a bitch.  But it worked and kept the livestock fed."

It is possible to crack many joints, such as those in the back and neck vertebrae, hips, wrists, elbows, shoulders, toes, ankles, knees, jaws, feet, sternum, and the Achilles tendon area. Although it is a common folk belief that popping of joints, especially knuckles, leads to arthritis or other joint problems, medical research has so far failed to conclusively demonstrate any connection between knuckle cracking and long-term joint problems.

Credited to Pythagoras of Samos, it allows the user to fill the cup with wine or any other liquid up to a certain level. If they fill the cup only to that level, the imbiber may enjoy a drink in peace. If they exhibit gluttony, however, the cup spills its entire contents out of the bottom (onto the lap of the immodest drinker).

Once the water reachs the top of the interior pipe and water begins pouring down the drain, it creates and maintains a vacuum pulling the rest of the water down with it until the vacuum is broken.  Not an entirely perfect/correct analogy but close enough: get a rope or cable and pull it over your hand from one side to the other, eventually enough of the rope that has been pulled over will drag the rest of it with it."

educationalgifs,37idke,ArosHD,3,Thu May 28 01:51:51 2015 UTC,The gif doesn't show that the toilet continues to feed water into the bowl after the main flush - so there's a few seconds of flow where the water in the bowl is being replaced by fresh water.  All that extra water is enough to flush the majority of the poo/pee water down the pipe - there might be an extremely small amount of poo/pee in there but not nearly enough to smell or be a risk.

The red area is between 450 and 500 nT.  That's pretty high, Quebec went into a blackout because of this event.  I would say that ordinarily there are no reds.    For some additional information, the solar cycle peaks about every 11 years.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (http://www.noaa.gov/) and the Solar Terrestrial Dispatch Station (STDS) (http://www.spacew.com/) keep an eye on solar activity and will send warnings out to grid operators to help them prepare, but sometimes the warnings are very short notice.  There are also GIC monitoring stations throughout the grid to help keep an eye on things.  NOAA and STDS maintain the Planetary K Index, which is just a chart that says the level of GICs that are being induced.  You can see a historical chart here:  http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/planetary-k-index.    On the day in question, Quebec hit a K level of 9.  Unfortunately, level 9 has no upper limit, so the Carrington Event (which is estimated to have induced 4200 nT) would still be a KP level 9."

Certainly most of them have approximately binary sexes, but I don't really see how we can equivocate the reproduction of insects, or birds with cloaca, or plants ffs, with human sex. It's problematic enough to infer that all penetration is inherently 'male' and reception is 'female' (one of the persisting causes of homophobia) without drawing a direct parallel between flower stamen and penises. You can argue that having a Y chromosome makes an individual male and two Xs makes an individual female. Fine, that works in many species, but is not the system for sex differentiation in many. That's not even to start to mention the species which reproduce asexually, or 'switch sex'. Why are we grouping these into 'male' and 'female'? Why does it matter so much that we label everything based on its similarity to ourselves? What is so wrong with saying Sex 1 and Sex 2 (for instance), particularly in cases where the words 'male' and 'female' are used so inappropriately?"

educationalgifs,36y4m6,MrCows,44,Sat May 23 13:20:07 2015 UTC,"Serious answer:  If someone is there to perform the Heimlich maneuver on a choking pregnant woman, they would place their hands higher than normal, just below the breastbone, make a fist, and a point with their thumb knuckle, then thrust inward and up.   If you're pregnant and alone while choking, this gif method would be incredibly bad. You'll want to find a chair with a corner or something similar, place it just under your breastbone and thrust your body weight into it.  Tl;Dr: The goal is to manually compress your diaphragm and lungs. Just remember they're above the womb and be careful, aside from that it's not much different from Heimlich maneuvers with non-pregnant folk."

You start by having the choking victim lean forward, and firmly strike their back once, between their shoulder blades with an open palm, pause then repeat. If that doesn't work after 3 attempts, you hold their back with one hand and push against their chest firmly once with an open palm, pause then repeat.

educationalgifs,36vhkp,Not_so_ghetto,2,Fri May 22 16:31:17 2015 UTC,The presence of mites isn't odd in hives. The number of mites is what needs to be monitored. You should be well aware of that as an apiarist how many hives do you have?

educationalgifs,36vhkp,Jesse4Lyfe,51,Fri May 22 20:44:42 2015 UTC,"You may have noticed some mites, Varroa mites are common in beehives, most beekeepers will probably have them. The brown ones you see here are females ready to lay so they go to a developing larva and lay eggs and feed off the larva. She lays a few fertilized eggs that will turn into females and an unfertilized egg which turns into a male. They feed on the haemolymph/'blood' of the pupa and might kill it if there are enough mites, otherwise there may be no visible effect. They feed and mate with the male and the male dies and the females attach to the adult bee and buzz around. Repeat.  This goes on often and only becomes a real concern when the numbers of mites gets beyond a certain point or if they carry a virus.  You have heard about mites because they can cause an issue if not managed which is why regular monitoring of mite levels is crucial.  The presence of mites isn't a huge surprise, they are everywhere, but they must be managed so they don't get out of hand and cause destruction.  (This kind of vigilance is why I am against those 'home flow' hives that stick to peoples walls, beekeeping isn't for everyone it requires diligence or shit can hit the fan and diseases spread)."

It's a valuable thing to be reminded of considering how often people just dismiss things, saying it's evil, or just crazy, etc, when really it's not too far-fetched when you hear about a few ideas from the (social) sciences. Like the feral child studies (heartbreaking shit), or how a tribal person isn't instantly turned on by the sight of a naked person, etc.   It just explains so much behaviour. Ultimately, monkey see, monkey do. Our brains love patterns and associations, and formulates/makes senses of things via already understood things (investigating how & where it's understood is interesting). All this helps to make sense of others in a very universal way that isn't just expressed by folk tales of divide. Kinda waffling now but ya, valuable stuff."

educationalgifs,36vhkp,Patsfan395,5,Fri May 22 16:45:00 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be so sure. Many ant species actually have a 'career' path where ants perform increasingly complex tasks within the colony as they age.  The youngest ants work in the deepest depths of the colony where they excavate new tunnels before moving on to creating or enlarging rooms.  When they get a bit older they help with more important tasks like moving things like food stores or caring for larvae.  Foraging in the outside world is reserved for the oldest ants. It's hard to say whether these older ants are actually more experienced and independent but at the very least this system makes sure that the most dangerous task falls to the ants who have the shortest lifespan left.   By keeping the younger ants inside the colony, the colony doesn't risk losing ants to the dangerous outside world that still had most of their lifespan to serve the colony."

Different reactors use different isotopes, depending on size requirements.  Denser reactors will use a higher ratio of U-238 to U-235, but U-238 is harder to make.  The particle that hits the uranium is a neutron.  The explosion can be thought of as releasing photons and heat energy.  The two atoms that split away are known as daughters.  More neutrons are released which go on to cause more fission reactions.  When enough of these reactions occur, the heat that is generated is enough to create steam which can spin the turbine of an electrical generator, or the blade turbine of a ship.  Source:  I was a nuclear technician in the Navy for 6 years.  Someone will probably come along with more detailed information, or to correct me about something I may not be quite accurate about.  edit  I found a better youtube video displaying fission, but I can't find a YouTube to gif converter that will let me make a 26 second gif."

educationalgifs,36m8gr,DoctorEdward,2,Thu May 21 03:06:53 2015 UTC,"U-235 is the fissile isotope found in natural uranium.  In naval reactors the enrichment is usually very high (over 20 weight percent U-235, a.k.a. High Enriched Uranium) to allow ships to run longer and have smaller cores.  Most civilian reactors have around 3-5 weight percent U-235.  An average fission of Uranium 235 from a thermal (room temperature) neutron is about 200 MeV.  This is split up into photons, neutrinos, kinetic energy in fission products, neutrons, and other radiation particles.  Most of the energy is absorbed either in the fuel or surrounding water or structure, except the neutrino energy.  EDIT: To put enrichment into perspective, a nuclear weapon is over 90% enriched, which is called ""Weapons Grade""."

The 3D cube is therefore not 3D, but merely the shadow of a 3D cube. Your brain can interpret this shadow, however, as it is used to the 3D world. In the same way, the hypercube in 3D is actually just a shadow of a hypercube in 4D from one angle. However, your brain can't interpret it."

The baffles inside the suppressor allow the hot gases to expand and cool before exiting the barrel of the gun. This slows the release of gas and decreases the sound it makes as it exits the barrel.

educationalgifs,36j3z7,DomUK89,1 point,Thu May 21 21:01:42 2015 UTC,"Radian:       The radian is the standard unit of angular measure, used in many areas of mathematics. An angle's measurement in radians is numerically equal to the length of a corresponding arc of a unit circle; one radian is just under 57.3 degrees (when the arc length is equal to the radius). The unit was formerly an SI supplementary unit, but this category was abolished in 1995 and the radian is now considered an SI derived unit.   Separately, the SI unit of solid angle measurement is the steradian.  The radian is represented by the symbol rad (Unicode-encoded as U+33AD ㎭ ). An alternative symbol is the superscript letter c, for ""circular measure"" or the letter r, but both of those symbols are infrequently used as it can be easily mistaken for a degree symbol (°) or a radius (r). So for example, a value of 1.2 radians could be written as 1.2 rad, 1.2 r, 1.2rad, or 1.2c.    Image i - An arc of a circle with the same length as the radius of that circle corresponds to an angle of 1 radian. A full circle corresponds to an angle of 2π radians.

The red crab spider makes its home in the pitcher plant, a deadly trap to ants and other insects. Strands of silk enable the spider to crawl around the pitcher walls without falling in. When a less fortunate insect falls inside and drowns, the spider fishes it out of the water, drinks its internal organs and leaves the rest for the plant to digest. The plant gains little, if anything, from the arrangement. But for the crab spider, it means bigger meals—many of the insects trapped by the pitcher plant would be too large for the spider to confront on its own.   Source"

educationalgifs,369vk8,cxn,13,Mon May 18 04:45:44 2015 UTC,One of the reasons insects have six legs is because it takes the least amount of brainpower to process how to walk.

But if I misunderstood, my apologies, please ignore what I said above.    As for your actual point about books being alright... but first... thousands of years (ok this is a hyperbole... but I get ya)  For natural physical sciences... it really doesn't work... you need to see the phenomena in context to fully grasp it, things fall at the same rate yes, but you don't appreciate that until you actually see a video of it happening. The original inventors brains could only come up with it from seeing things in context and seeing the need for it. It's why physics pedagogy is all about experiment and why walter lewin's lectures are so renowned (physical experiment) & are copied everywhere, why there's PHeT simulations (virtual experiment) from Colorado Boulder and why they're so renowned for their physics pedagogy; they do workshops and conferences.  To say that textbooks aren't the problem for natural-physical sciences (bio, chem, physics)... I really think you'd be hard pressed to prove that point with scholars..."

You think they're primitive, but they're cost effective to produce (largely because we have centuries of experience in writing words), and still the most advanced tools the vast majority of students have access to.  It takes time and energy to produce educational animations of the type and quality you wish you had in school.  And to be honest, most attempts turn out pretty crappy (like most [text]books and everything else).  Notice also that even though you liked the educational qualities of this animation, another comment took issue with it and claimed it missed the real reason behind tsunamis.  So I'm basically saying, your lament is just another wish that the world be better than it is.  I encourage you to try to make it like you think it should be (whether that's making animations, donating money, or encouraging others to do so), but if you're not willing to put that energy into it, then it's just saying ""if my ancestors had been even cleverer I could have learnt so much more"".  Well of course, that's always true, but obviously they weren't (even though they were actually hella clever in ways that we don't even realize), and now the onus is on us to actually become the cleverer ancestors we wish we had.  tl;dr: The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago.

And yeah, my original comment seemed like it, but it had a lot of consideration behind it. But you can't tell because language is like that, we hear confident people who really don't know their stuff as using powerful flippant language so that it becomes a bit empty when you really mean it if you get what i'm saying.  And btw I think you'd be right to give that comment & I think it's a good thing to do to do anyway, to get people thinking to question people, but yeah I can see people being a bit offended, but meh, I personally think people should get used to feeling a bit uncomfortable, well hopefully it makes people more understanding instead of dividing, CBT I think can do that. Anyway I digress.  And even if you're wrong, the other party is able to consolidate things like I was able to to ground myself a bit, it's a useful exercise.  btw i don't think PhET does worldwide donations anymore, but it was nice for you to consider that, perhaps you should donate to something you believe in instead in my name if you have disposable income. (or if you really must make it pedagogically based, destinsmartereveryday is quite good, brady haran maybe, or bill nye's lightsail actually, just listing things at the top of my head, not doing a good job...) peace & take care internet stranger, it was nice having this conversation."

If the motion is slow, the force could more ably dissipate into the surrounding medium (water at the bottom) and wouldn't produce such a significant wave at the top. This is because the impulse of the event is dependent on the integral of the force with respect to time.  So again, I don't know shit about tsunamis. But I've read a book or two about physics, and a few beers in I think it to some order will look like that."

Scientists use UAVs today, but they are still expensive and also no where near as good as what the military is using.  I'm pretty sure there are scientists today who'd love to get their hands on a powerful drone, but either can't afford to or are waiting for one to free up.    Without the backing and funding they received from the military department the UAV's of today would not exist   I don't buy the idea that we're better off spying on people than using those funds and lenses for exploration and discovery just because the military created drones for war, or that we wouldn't even have drones if not for the military. The military does come up with some cool and useful stuff, but that's because it's where the funding goes. Putting that kind of money into any other research facility and you'd get results at least as beneficial.   Recording the phenomena you talk about would take perhaps decades and the entire airforce & navy's worth of UAV's to only accomplish   The military has drones that can stay airborne for months at a time, and I assume we already have some idea where faults and areas prone to earthquakes are.

educationalgifs,35wka4,pr0xidian,2,Thu May 14 22:54:28 2015 UTC,I have a goobered up molar that more than likely will need a root canal. Is this better?
educationalgifs,35wka4,Lesbiefriends,5,Fri May 15 00:11:28 2015 UTC,"Root canals really aren't all that bad, particularly if you see an Endodontist (A dentist that specializes in root treatment, such as root canals, instead of a regular family dentist). Your dentist can refer you (many do that anyway). They typically numb you up quite well, there's just a lot of noise from the drill. Put in earbuds with a good podcast or playlist, make it a little bit loud (to hear over the drill), and you'll probably be done before the show's over. Then, it's important to remember that it's typical to have a bit of tenderness for a few days, especially if you try to chew on it. The gums around it may be a bit angry, but the nerve that used to be in your tooth has been removed now, so it shouldn't hurt too badly at all. If you have any tenderness afterword that ibuprofen doesn't help, your Endodontist or dentist is usually willing to prescribe a stronger painkiller to last a couple days, but this isn't usually necessary.  Keeping your root inact to chew with is probably the better alternative. I imagine u/pr0xidian didn't have dental insurance and opted for the cheapest route that would let them keep chewing. A root canal must be followed by a crown (doesn't hurt, allows you to chew on the tooth long-term), both of which are pretty expensive. That said, I've never, ever had a dentist to tell me to get implants instead of a root canal, even dentists who offered implants themselves and sent me out for the root canal (thus not profiting from it). I've been told many times, whenever possible, keep your tooth."

Since the root canals failed, and got infected while I was out of the country, infection set in pretty badly. They needed to extract the teeth, and give me a bone graft.  On a scale of 1-10 on the pain scale, that procedure was a solid 10. (I learned that infection neutralizes Novocaine, so the entire procedure was basically done without effective pain management.)  6 months later, I had the implant placed.  On a pain scale of 1-10, the implant placement was a 2. Roughly equal to aching muscles the day after a strenuous workout. You have nothing to worry about."
