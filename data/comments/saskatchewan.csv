Best bet it to leave it unplugged overnight, an/or while you are at work.  Because of the way DHCP works (and this pretty much across all Internet Providers) there is no other way for them to change the IP address.  Your other option is to pay for a static IP. It would work, but you have to shell out a bit more every month, and unless you have a reason to get one, it's just easier to leave your modem unplugged for a day."
saskatchewan,3e63gm,yrtria,3,Wed Jul 22 12:03:23 2015 UTC,They usually cycle the same few ones back to you. Not sure on the lease period but I'd assume a day. You can also buy static IP addresses.  What do you need a new IP for?

I found this complaint about being blacklisted as a spammer and figure something similar must have happened to me.  But I suppose if Sasktel cycles the same few IP addresses back then there's a good chance the same thing could just happen again?  Edit to add:  I typed my IP address into Google.  I didn't find anything that specifically said ""spam"" but it seems to be showing up on a few foreign language (Russian and Chinese) web sites.  Probably not a good sign!"

Technology allows farmers to manage a larger area, and they have to, to keep up with rising costs.  Same with supporting industries like manufacturing that can run with fewer staff and have fewer customers.  Fewer farmers leads to fewer jobs supporting them, like local retail shops, restaurants, etc. this means a smaller tax base to support emergency services.  Do you think those that choose to live in urban areas should pay increased taxes to support rural services, or that rural dwellers should pay further increased taxes to keep services that aren't used as often?  Most of us that came from rural areas accept that we receive reduced emergency services compared to urban areas, but also have much cheaper real-estate, less crime(at least certain types of crime), less pollution, shorter commutes, less traffic, and don't have to lock our doors."

Back in the day on our small farm, we relied on the entire family helping out because there's no way we could afford hired hands. If the new norm would be to give every family a ticket for their kids driving them around in a farm truck I'd be much more than just mildly annoyed by this story. I'm not saying we should let all kids drive everywhere all the time, but to me it seems like the family had it under control and the kid was driving safely within his means, as things generally happened on the farm."

One other thing to keep in mind - if an unlicensed driver is operating a vehicle and causes an accident, the insurance on the vehicle is completely invalid.  That includes not only the damage to the vehicle the child (or other unlicensed driver) was driving, but also to the damage caused to other people's property (including vehicles), and to any bodily injury claims that arise.  Farm liability insurance won't pick this up either.  The farmer completely self-insures these risks.  I doubt most farmers realize that."
saskatchewan,3dfb8k,crushed_edge,0,Thu Jul 16 16:24:22 2015 UTC,"It said the father was charged. And I don't think it's ever been a real issue before. Safe driving habits were always the most important lesson when driving on the farm. I always had to ask permission if I wanted to just go for a 'drive' down our farm land and I know that pretty much everyone else around us had similar rules.   Also, I'm pretty sure most farmers know that insurance doesn't apply to an ""illegal"" driver. It sucks that we really are living in a world where everything needs to be PC and common sense seems to be getting lost while these little life lessons that come from things like learning how to drive at a young age on the farm are starting to be shunned.   And I could be wrong, but I always thought it was illegal to pass someone on a grid road. Maybe the cop was late for Timmie's."

saskatchewan,3d0u84,MagickSkoolieBus,8,Mon Jul 13 03:11:13 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm all for free speech. But I guess the question here then, is what is the message?   I honestly don't think the message here is ""I'm racist and proud"" but maybe some kind of farm boy misunderstanding. Either way, they need a new symbol because the American south has very little to admire about it.   The ultra religious, anti gay, anti abortion, anti everyone-who-isn't-Christian, and racist views associated with this flag really have no place in Canada (or anywhere).   If they are proud of their country heritage and lifestyle that's fine, but guys, seriously, new flag. New flag!"
saskatchewan,3d0u84,salsadoom,2,Sun Jul 12 18:01:35 2015 UTC,"Someone misunderstands free speech. As an event organized by a private entity, they have the right to do whatever the hell they please, including throwing these people off the premises. Free speech is protected when it comes to the government, not when it comes to other private entities. If I don't like the things you're saying when you're in my house I have the right to tell you to leave. The government, on the other hand, has much less power to silence you unless you cross the threshold of what is considered to no longer be protected speech.  Waving a Confederate Flag in Canada likely doesn't pass that test for the government. But for Craven organizers, who are decidedly NOT the government, they likely do have the right to ask you to take down the flag or leave the premises.  The answer here though isn't censorship and banning, it is more speech. Better speech. Don't like the flag? Good for you, let's hear why."
saskatchewan,3d0u84,m3t4lw01f,8,Tue Jul 14 14:59:56 2015 UTC,"Ugh. It's a flag.   The guys waving it think of it as a symbol for being a farm boy not slavery and black hate. Jesus this is getting so stupid already. Taking an object away from a racist doesn't make him non racist. Giving an object to someone also doesn't make him a racist especially when they think of it in a different manner. Look at the swastika, everyone associates it with one thing even though it originally meant the complete opposite. It's all about how you interpret the object rather than what it's original meaning was. I don't get why media doesn't understand this. That dude would have shot up the church whether he had the flag in his bedroom or not. The flag wasn't slipping evil thoughts into his head while he was sleeping."

saskatchewan,3d0u84,skilless,2,Sun Jul 12 21:44:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying I think the flag isn't stupid, but if you think that anyone in Sasky thinks of that flag as anything other than a symbol for being a farm boy then you're wrong. Just because it might mean something in one place, it doesn't mean it means the same thing in another. People in North Carolina call toques a toboggan. There are different meanings to things in different places. In Sasky, everyone that flies a confederate flag does so because they want people to know they are farm boys/rednecks and not from the city."
saskatchewan,3d0u84,skippy2893,4,Sun Jul 12 22:30:42 2015 UTC,"People in North Carolina call toques a toboggan.    YUP. Was pumping gas as a teenager, and was asking for a coworker to grab me a toque when some lady from North Carolina asked me what that was. Showed her my toque and she called it a toboggan. Funnily enough, some kids were tobogganing down a hill nearby, so i pointed at the sled, and told her that was a tobggan in Canada.   She looked clueless for a second, then her face took on the impression of someone just cluing in while it dawned on her that she was calling a hat, a sled.   It was priceless."

Frankly the ones I've bought elsewhere at other times have been disappointing.  Whatever variety the Pom Wonderful ones from California are, those are the ones I like.  They're that perfect blend of tartness and sweetness.  If you store them well they will keep for several months, so you could stock up if you wanted.

The Confederate soilders fought and  lost their lives for something they believed in, even if it was wrong.

I'm still a young man but I've seen the impact of what this ""Country"" has done to First Nations people and still continues to do. From the beginning of first contact we've been murdered by the millions, we've been colonized through the Indian act, we've been placed on land and told that we were not able to vote or leave this piece of land with out permission. We've had our grand parents/parents removed from their homes and placed into schools that were designed specifically to ""remove the Indian in the child"". They were raped, physically beaten, starved and murdered by the churches which forced religion upon them. The effects from these school's alone plays a big part in the dysfunction of our communities and people today. We have brothers that are locked up like animals, we have sisters that are missing and murdered, with this government not wanting to ""deal with it"". They should be teaching the truth about what has really happened over the years in school today. At the same time it's our responsibility as individuals to move forward in a good way! The government of Canada really did a number on us native people but they also gave us a common ground in which we can work forward together as one! We are a strong people!!

saskatchewan,3b970o,gymgal19,2,Sat Jun 27 00:34:25 2015 UTC,There is nothing on SGI that says you can't drive out of province that I can see on their website. You could always stop by an office or call them about it too.

saskatchewan,3b2yxn,Cannon49,8,Thu Jun 25 15:27:12 2015 UTC,It seems like what the article is saying is that the radars caught lots of people going 1 or 2 km/hr above the speed limit but very few were speeding in excess of the threshold to warrant a ticket. But for some reason the article carries a tone implying the photo radar system is flawed.
saskatchewan,3b2yxn,serialphreak,2,Thu Jun 25 17:41:43 2015 UTC,Basically it is.  It's not paying for itself
saskatchewan,3b2yxn,kab0b87,3,Thu Jun 25 21:55:31 2015 UTC,"Apparently they can't win. If they make money on ticket revenue, it's a cash grab. If they lose money, it's a waste."
saskatchewan,3b2yxn,robstoon,3,Fri Jun 26 06:37:19 2015 UTC,"Yea, the funny thing about enforcement. SGI pays out claims. Some of those are related to speed. The system pays for itself either way, by getting better compliance, claims should fall, resulting in net profits to SGI. By catching non-compliers is the other way the system pays for itself."
saskatchewan,3b2yxn,Krynnadin,-1,Thu Jun 25 23:29:40 2015 UTC,until we get a rate increase to subsidise the 15000 a month/machine shortfall
saskatchewan,3b2yxn,kab0b87,5,Fri Jun 26 00:53:13 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing what I'm saying. Lower accident costs means SGI pays less on claims, but still brings in X dollars from licences. That means while their accounts receivable doesn't change, their accounts payable is lower, resulting in more profit (or less deficit if they're in that situation)."
saskatchewan,3b2yxn,Krynnadin,0,Fri Jun 26 03:42:53 2015 UTC,No I get what your saying but there would have to be on average 170 000 dollars of claims not made because of lower speed limits on circle drive alone at current ticketing rates.  I can't see it saving that kind of money on claims per machine
saskatchewan,3b2yxn,kab0b87,2,Fri Jun 26 07:15:54 2015 UTC,"Not since photo/radar ticketing has increased accident rates where it has been implemented, and increased the severity of said accidents, despite what proponents say.  Indirect tax increases are inefficient bordering on the insane. This is one of them. Have the balls to increase taxes and pay 1-2% overhead, or pay 175% overhead.  I dunno, I as a citizen, if I weren't a dummy, would go for the former."
saskatchewan,3b2yxn,Saucetopus,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:43:02 2015 UTC,"Yea. To be honest, I have nothing good to say about the speed cameras. I think they're a waste of time. I would like to see my SGI premiums continue to drop (I think I'm 4%? down now on my annual good driver premium).   Automated cars should solve alot of these issues, but it's really the difference in speed between vehicles that cause most issues. If all vehicles were doing 90, OR 100, OR 110 it wouldn't matter, but the 20km/h difference is what ends up killing people when the guy at 110 slams on his brakes to avoid a ticket. :\"
saskatchewan,3b2yxn,Krynnadin,-1,Fri Jun 26 19:21:26 2015 UTC,I guess i would argue that it could be paying for itself indirectly when considering if people are slowing down there are less speeding related collisions. I wonder if this is factored in? The only reason these were set up couldn't be just to make money right?

saskatchewan,3b2yxn,_Sigma,2,Thu Jun 25 19:39:33 2015 UTC,but they do not reveal what the threshold warrant a speeding ticket.   Which is interesting as SGI initially claimed there was no threshold.

I use Access because I've typically been able to get a better price, they have a better download/upload bandwidth ratio and I typically get a faster ping while gaming with them.  The difference overall is likely negligible, most people likely don't care about 10 ping or an extra 400kbps upload but I've gotten enough use out of it that I won't consider switching until fibre is available in my area."
saskatchewan,3ad8kv,AbruptlyBlue,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:02:04 2015 UTC,Sasktel has a very good student promotion.  30$ a month for Mach 1 (100 down 20 up).  This deal lasts for 6 or 12 months I can't recall and restarts July 1st same as last year.  Access has good student deals most of the time as well.  2 Notes though:   When it's up you will get better internet through fibre from Sasktel guaranteed.  No data caps and if you are on fibre you don't have to worry about issues like corroding contacts or signal strength. Access has better customer service generally.  Over the last couple decades I have had issues with Access and Sasktel and access always sends someone out within a day or two.  The last time I call Sasktel it was a 6 day wait (one of their crew knocked loose my fibre on the pole or didn't plug it back in properly).
