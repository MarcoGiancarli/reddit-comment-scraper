Supernatural,3e2tce,maverickmonk,2,Tue Jul 21 17:53:19 2015 UTC,Thank you!  I love my always keep fighting shirt but I'm self conscious about wearing it in public because I don't want to be viewed as a girl that bought a shirt because of a hot guy on it. I would prefer if the shirt just said always keep fighting and then perhaps to write love on her arms.

One girl even came up (besides the other three) saying she had one at home too. Definitely made me feel better about it!"

Supernatural,3e2tce,zipsgirl4life,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:55:32 2015 UTC,"'Keep fighting,' -- it's really normal to hear things like, ""keep fighting til you can't fight no more,"" tacked onto the end of it. JP's message rejects that & adds an ""always' tacked onto the beginning of it.  Makes a lot of sense to me. It's very nice. He also talks about the slogan a lot in an article... uh.. somewhere (or maybe it was a con video) - talks about a friend of his had framed the struggle he had with depression as like a daily fight & that it's difficult to not just give in & let it claim you every single day. Hence ""always"" keep fighting against giving into your depression or like... any issue you may have really - on a daily, weekly, monthly, yearly basis, etc."

Supernatural,3dybvh,ringu68,26,Mon Jul 20 17:54:59 2015 UTC,"I have the same problem as you, in regards to the missed opportunities. I'm rewatching the show right now with a friend who hasn't seen it before, and the issues are so glaring from season 7-ish onward. When Castiel became God, she was like ""Oooh, this could be fun."" An episode later, ""Well, god was a neat idea, but it would be even better to have him as the big bad this season, now that the Leviathans are in him."" I was just thinking inwardly, ""Oh honey, don't get your hopes up.""  I guess I'd like to see well-plotted main story arcs -- having very recently watched everything again, it's so clear how neatly everything from seasons 1-5 wrap up together. There are clear breadcrumbs from the 1st season all the way to the end of 5, and a feeling of constant momentum towards a final big finale in each season, which is leading towards a really huge finale in 5 (whether or not you love Swan Song or not, the lead up to that end was a hell of a ride).   My friend who is watching this for the first time has also started to complain about the lack of communication between the boys (again, inwardly, I'm thinking, ""Oh boy, and it gets even worse."") I'm sick of secrets. Let's just have a decent big bad that the boys have to battle against that actually seems like a real threat to the world, without the constant secrets and lies and angst. I love me some angst, but FFS, enough of it already.  Hell, if I had my druthers, I'd throw the whole SPN universe apart -- have something so major that the world knows that all those big baddies exist, and that the world is on the edge of destruction. It's starting to strain credulity after 10 years and all the people that they have saved, etc., that the world at large continues to be unaware of the things that go bump in the night. Bring in the FBI/CIA/whatever, and have the boys have to work with/against them and their bureaucracy. Have some massive battles and actual stakes at hand. Make this the last season, and make it go out with a huge fucking bang where the boys sacrifice themselves at the end, and the world actually knows who they are and why they did it."
Supernatural,3dybvh,dalek_999,4,Mon Jul 20 15:29:54 2015 UTC,"I competent agree with you. Being a day one watched of the show, I feel like all they need is to commit to a big idea and see it through.

It was a fantastic set up, and they could have gone to some really interesting places with it. They could have explored a completely new dynamic between the brothers, but instead opted to wimp out and take the easy road. It's an old show now, but it'd be great to see a change with lasting consequences.    What I want is this: Tighter story plotting/writing, and less padding with monster of the week episodes. Cut the series down to 13 episodes - really focus on the characters and what the Darkness will do to them."
Supernatural,3dybvh,epicmurf,8,Mon Jul 20 15:34:29 2015 UTC,"I think Benny was the first time they really introduced a strong personality that was outside the formula of ""monster bad kill it"".

Supernatural,3dybvh,jjmayhem,7,Tue Jul 21 10:07:37 2015 UTC,"Here's where I wish the show was taken  I wish that Death had decided to send Dean to purgatory to live out having the mark. that way, he's no danger to the people around him. he can murder as he pleases. Dean brings Sammy to the abandoned restaurant to let him know where he's going, and he could have just quipped ""You had no problem leaving me there before. And besides, I'm sure you'll find a way to visit""  boom, he's gone.  that's the end of the season.   new Season starts with a time jump like the last time he was in purgatory. now Dean is like the unofficial king of purgatory. or the sheriff. whatever. Sam figures out a way to get the mark off, finally, so he gathers a rescue team to get him out (first episode) they perform the spell, only to release the darkness. now, they can fight the darkness without it sounding so fucking last minute.  this show's writing is just so poorly thought out.  they have all these options like a) something cool and thought out b) something okay but at least can explain some other things c) cut up a magazine and glue the articles together as we send it through google translate and back 30 times and see if that gives us some sort of inspiration.  I know, let's make everyone tell Dean he's stupid and then have the brothers not communicate like a pair of pissy middle schoolers. because that's how grown ass men who have seen the repercussions of not communicating well behave. by never learning. and why would they! because Dean is stupid. did we mention all Dean does is eat and be stupid? gosh we are the best writers.   they always pick c, the sons of bitches   ""oh Sam this whole not having a soul then getting it back is a real pain in my ass"" ""I, castiel, will fix the problem so that we can move on from this""  and really, like ""Oh man, you know, when it was me possessed by Lucifer I was really ready to just fucking jump into Hell, but now that I have the option to close the gates of Hell forever eh let's not. Because it's not like we have magical resurrection friends. They don't exist. If I die, I stay dead. Like every other time I've died."""

Supernatural,3dybvh,madmc326,6,Mon Jul 20 16:18:41 2015 UTC,"My biggest problem lately is that it seems like, although there is a ""theme"" to a season, the individual episodes don't lead into each other very well. There's always some point of contention between Sam and Dean, which makes sense -- there has to be. But it's like... I don't know how to describe this very well except to illustrate it. Let's say Sam wants pineapple and bacon on a pizza, while Dean wants pepperoni and sausage.  Episode 4: ""I want pineapple and bacon!"" ""I want pepperoni and sausage!""  Episode 5: ""I want pineapple and bacon!"" ""I am going to order one with pepperoni and sausage, order your own!""  Episode 6: ""I am eating a pineapple and bacon sandwich right now because I haven't gotten the pizza yet!"" ""Man I donno what your deal is, I sure wish I had a pepperoni and sausage pizza""  Episode 7: ""Hey we have enough money to order two pizzas, why don't we just get one of each"" ""Or why don't we get TWO pepperoni and sausage pizzas?! That'd be awesome!""  Episode 8: ""I'm going to order a pineapple and bacon pizza today"" ""Dammit Sammy, I wanted pepperoni and sausage!""  Episode 9: ""Dean, we never can seem to agree on pizza! If only there were some solution, if only pizza places delivered two distinct pizzas at once! But sadly no one has ever thought of that!"" ""Hey some pineapple and bacon fell into my pepperoni and sausage pizza and I think I might actually like all 4 together but I'm not gonna admit that to Sammy""  Episode 10: ""Hello Boys, I'm here with some pineapple and sausage, and pepperoni and bacon pizza"" ""DAMMIT CROWLEY okay actually I'll eat that 2nd one""  Episode 11: ""I do not understand the human desire for cut up animal parts adorning these circular flat breads. I ordered cherry peppers, bell peppers, and mushrooms, with a light balsamic drizzle, and it seems perfectly acceptable to me.""  what point was I trying to make? I'm having too much fun with this now  oh yeah  Episode 12: ""I want pineapple and bacon!"" ""Seriously Sammy? I want pepperoni and sausage!""   Episode 13: ""I want pineapple and bacon!"" ""We should just get two pizzas, why didn't you ever think of that? Perfect solution, let's move on""  Episode 14: ""Hey this pizza place can do pizzas half-and-half"" ""SAMMY THAT WOULD NEVER WORK. Obviously we can only get one pizza and it has to be entirely pepperoni and sausage""  Episode 15: ""I want pineapple and -- oh hey Charlie!"" ""Charlie, how's our kickass tech woman-of-letters! I sure am glad the show pulled another resurrection!"" i'm serious on this one, i hope we see her again ""Guys why are there pizza boxes all over the home base?""  Episode 16: ""I want pineapple and bacon!"" ""I tell you what sammy, you order pineapple and bacon, you've been very helpful to me today. I'm gonna have a hamburger anyway""  Episode 17: ""Dean, when are we ever gonna order pineapple and bacon!"" ""I DON'T KNOW SAMMY MAYBE IF YOU'RE EVER HELPFUL TO ME YOU CAN ORDER IT AND I'LL HAVE A HAMBURGER""  etc  etc etc.  it's like... in my imagination the head-writers have announced to all the writers that there's this overarching theme and everyone understands and gets on board with that and pitches snippets that sort of fit with the theme, but then they arrange them in an order that makes no sense, and/or re-use snippets that honestly don't make sense to re-use. although there is character growth from the beginning to the end of the whole season, the order of the snippets gives the impression that there's not really any character growth from episode to episode, or, the growth exists but is periodically backwards and incoherent."
Supernatural,3dybvh,wnp,5,Mon Jul 20 16:55:41 2015 UTC,"One: I'd break the pattern the writers get into of splitting Sam and Dean up only for them to come back together with different out looks on things. We've seen that before and honestly it started to feel like a crutch.  I would rewing the Angels and give Demons a power boost to. The brothers have a way too easy of a time taking those foes out these days.  I know most people would say that the Bunker should be gone, but i'd keep it and make it much more plot relevant then it has been before beyond a mcguffin of the week.   For the villains: make them be beyond evil for evils sake. Also don't get lazy with it, I know the Darkness will have to look human eventually because this show needs to follow a budget but that doesn't mean every fight needs to be a guy who either loses his head or gets perforated.   Finally: Kill Crowley. While I love Mark Sheppard, Crowley's really been a pain in the ass for far too long not to be taken care of in season 11."
Supernatural,3dybvh,Lavaros,3,Mon Jul 20 18:53:58 2015 UTC,"Yes yes yes to all of it. Even the ""kill-Crowley"" part. I loved him the first few seasons he was in, but after his bromance with Deanmon/demon!Dean (whatever you want to call him), the only interesting thing about him right now is Sheppard's accent.  Of course, people will be upset, but I'd like to point out that they killed Bobby"

That's who he is at his core and I just don't get into seeing sam being the rock of the relationship."

That shitty episode with Jody Stoneface Mills and annoyingly happy Dumb Cop was just a bad episode. I want more gods to appear."
Supernatural,3dybvh,Jebasaur,5,Mon Jul 20 16:25:46 2015 UTC,My thoughts are few as to what can make it better: One-stop killing every supporting character that people start to love just to get more angst. Two -Bring back the Classic Rock. I think everybody can agree that's part of what made 1-5 great. Three- set down a real goal for the show to end on and then work towards it. 1-5 were so great because they had an end game. You don't see a best selling book series where the author just wrote what seemed like a good idea at the time. They always know how the story is going to end and they work to get there.
Supernatural,3dybvh,nagrathon,3,Mon Jul 20 20:59:14 2015 UTC,"Something mythological monster tales from about nordic, swedish and finnish mythology. Similar way that Santa turned evil or just happens to be the same character from the mythology. Also russian or german things would be fine."
Supernatural,3dybvh,Ortlas,3,Mon Jul 20 17:07:54 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy the show, but I would like more horror and more kickassery from the winchesters. I want to se monsters who actually live with humans and don't murder people. Like a shapeshifter perhaps. Also the detective work about what they are hunting is kinda gone. But really really more horror, please. :) ....and seriously bring back Tahmoh Penikett."
Supernatural,3dybvh,fridanordh,4,Mon Jul 20 19:38:36 2015 UTC,"TL;DR The writers need new ideas and something not Judeo-Christian in nature.  Look, angels and demons are getting old. In fact, it seems like those two groups aren't even fighting each other any more, just dealing with their own respective kingdoms. But what bugs me the most is this: the show spends too much time using Christian mythology. I get it, a vast majority of people in the USA are Christians, and so find something they can understand. Angels, Demons, Eve, Heaven and Hell are familiar concepts, whoop-de-doo. I miss wanting to learn about the monsters in the show. I remember thinking ""WTF is a wndigo? What's a tulpa? What's a djinn?"" The last few seasons were ""Oops, the angels/demons are making a mess, better take of it for them because we (Sam, Dean, and Cas) are the only ones on the entire freaking planet who can possibly take care of it."" Surely there's someone in Japan, Poland, South Africa, or Brazil who knows something about hunting and the greater supernatural threats to the world.  There are around 10 or less episodes that deal with non-Judeo-Christian deities. Trickster episodes don't count because he was Gabriel the whole time. This pisses me off more than it should, because I feel like its shoving Christianity down everyone's throats. I don't mean to offend anyone by that, but it's true. Also, /u/madmc326 made a good point. We've SEEN werewolves, vampires, Angels and Demons too many times. The Fey Folk are super interesting, despite my limited knowledge of them.   Another thing: there aren't any (or if there are, not enough) good supernatural creatures. Yes, of course the bad will outnumber the good, that's just how it works. However, it needs to be more than just ""oh, I'm a good werewolf"" like Garth was and ""oh, I'm helpful to the Winchesters so I'm a good guy"" like Benny. How about freaking centaurs!? I'm sure there are other mythological beings that are nice.  And what about other apocalypses? It's been mentioned in other episodes (where Gabriel meets with other gods but Lucifer kills them because he's fucking awesome), but SURELY some other end of the world could be brought in. How about the Norse? Jörmungandr is the ""Midgard Serpent"" or ""World Serpent"" of Norse mythos, so named because he is a snake who grew so large that he wrapped around the world and could bite his tail. When he lets go, the world will end."
Supernatural,3dybvh,ApertureBrowserCore,4,Tue Jul 21 03:32:50 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen the current season, (just bits) so here is my thought.    Crowley gets kicked out of hell and becomes spiteful and joins sam and dean full time. At first no on trust him, but he becomes a true member of the team and see him hang out at their new hangout. I'd love to see Crowley take Cas to a strip club and show him how to live it up with dean."

Supernatural,3dybvh,I_smell_awesome,2,Mon Jul 20 16:00:27 2015 UTC,The characters are great and they're still doing interesting things mythology wise.  They just need to wrap it up in a competent plot.  For the last couple seasons there have been little plot advancement right until the end when they rush to get through it.
Supernatural,3dybvh,oblivious247,2,Mon Jul 20 17:44:38 2015 UTC,I miss Sams demon powers. I had so much fun watching him go righteous on them demons
Supernatural,3dybvh,Chundler,4,Mon Jul 20 20:46:16 2015 UTC,"Stop with all the angel crap.  Bartholomew, Hannah, Naomi, etc, like who honestly gave 3 flying fucks about those characters?  The time of the Angels is over.    Stop with all the ""rogue"" shit too. Rogue characters are cool but not all the time.  Give us back badass vampires and werewolves.  Give me creepy little children.  Find a way to carry the story over several seasons.  Right now, we are seeing a SPN that exists to make it through the season.  Each season ends on a cliffhanger that gets resolved in a few episodes.  Nothing long and lasting.  It's getting stale."
Supernatural,3dybvh,thomasatnip,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:13:52 2015 UTC,"All I want to add here is we should avoid the demon and vampire stuff for awhile. But I agree, when we got to names like Bartholomew, or Malachi, it just got stupid. The names just downgraded as we went along. And yeah...too many rogue characters."
Supernatural,3dybvh,Jebasaur,3,Mon Jul 20 22:24:13 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't try to improve it, I would go back and Erase all knowledge of everything that happened after Season 5. They ended it perfectly with Chuck Narrating us out. Sam sacrificed himself to save the world, and Dean got the family with a beautiful wife and son, and got to leave the hunting world forever. The only thing I would cancel from that episode is Sam appearing at the end. Just stop it there where it was supposed to stop with Sam in the Pit, and Dean with a life.  That to me is what I would do.  I think the show has gone on to long, it has gone from a show about two guys trying to help the world by killing a few monsters, to Dean being a depressed alcoholic, Sam being a whiny little bitch. Cass went from being a really entertaining character who was an angel trying to understand how Humans felt, to being whatever he is now.... I don't feel the show meshes like it used to, and everything after Season 5 feels like they put a bunch of ideas in a hat and picked them out randomly. The only saving grace in my opinion for the show is Crowly who is absolutely hilarious and an amazing actor.   Another thing that was mentioned before was that I feel like the show had a much darker vibe before, it was like the boys really were in a bind at times in the earlier seasons. They fought a Demon and it was this huge ordeal that was not easily handled. They found monsters that nearly killed them in every episode.... Now if they find something they can't kill they summon Cass to vaporize it, or if they know how to kill it they are never in that pinch they used to be in.... Just my thoughts."
Supernatural,3dybvh,xfactor13891,2,Mon Jul 20 18:49:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you! It is an unpopular opinion, but a legit one. I totally agree that the show should have wrapped up with the pan out of Dean getting the normal life Sam wanted.   This isn't to say that I haven't enjoyed some of the later seasons, but it would have been a great story."

Supernatural,3dxr9l,JoleneAL,5,Mon Jul 20 12:12:00 2015 UTC,"I have nicknamed S7 ""The Hurdle"" because it's the season I debated stopping on. I heard people say it got better, and I felt like it did. I liked a lot of the end of S7 minus the actual finale which seemed kind of weird tbh. But S8 has a lot of good stuff that I felt really help redeem it, just make sure to hold your finger over the FF button for the Amelia scenes because those are the most boring. Doesn't last long anyway, thank goodness. The Dean/Benny story is good and the Naomi/Cas events are interesting. All in all I really liked S8 and it's finale is my second favorite in the whole series.  It's also worth noting through S1-5 the showrunner was Eric Kripke, S6-7 was Sera Gamble and S8-11 is Jeremy Carver.  Episodes to can skip:   8.03 Heartache   8.04 Bitten (though it sounds like you may have already watched these two)   8.15 Man's Best Friends with Benefits (It's just plain bad. I skipped, went back and watched later, didn't regret skipping it)  8.16 Remember the Titans (It's just ok, nothing important to the plot)  8.18 Freaks and Geeks (It's ok too, especially if you liked Krissy, but again, not important to the plot)  If you didn't like Charlie, you can skip 8.11 LARP and the Real Girl and 8.20 Pac-Man Fever, but because she's an overall reoccuring character, I don't really recommend it (plus I personally liked those episodes. Dean's speech at the end of 8.11 is great.)  My favorite episodes from S8 are 8.08 Hunteri Heroici (all the nostalgia plus it's really funny, especially if you like Cas-humor), 8.17 Goodbye Stranger (It's huge, so much happens, so many sad and great and interesting and wow moments!), and 8.23 Sacrifice (The finale, of course!)  Also about Garth, he's first mentioned in 6.04 Weekend at Bobby's where Bobby is talking to him on the phone. You don't actually see him till 7.08 Time for a Wedding! (I did look this up, mostly because I couldn't remember the episode numbers or if he actually physically appeared before 7.08)"

I honestly cannot picture Dean talking to god without it being extremely cheesy.  I really want god to show up and there be some confrontation but there is no way that can happen.

I appreciate that Demon Dean had to be but even before that.. I mean I think the last funny line he delivered was ""I'm batman""!

It's always been formulaic and I don't mind the monster of the week episodes when they're done right, but I'm starting to think 20+ episodes a season is too much. The pacing of the show is always off. It feels like the bigger arc is never moving forward. I think if we only had 13 episodes a season there would be more of a sense of urgency and danger. The plot would be more cohesive that way."

Not in the ""he's a better character"" way, but in the ""we write more acting challenges for Jared and better plots for Sam"" way.  The show lost sight of the fact that the majority of threats average people face will be spirits/ghouls/etc, and NOT Leviathan or angels. If the brothers are meant to be hunters, why don't they ever actually hunt?  I miss the idea of an actual hunting subculture. I hate the idea that it's Winchester Inc. saving the world ALL the time.  Crowley is overrated. His status as ""chessmaster of chessmasters"" is too easily abused, and the show would be better if he was killed.  I hated Garth. And Charlie. They felt like author self-inserts -- they aren't bad if the audience can't tell, but MAN is it easy to tell.  The idea that Reapers are angels wasn't a bad retcon, but it was handled badly. They should have been angels OF DEATH, not just angels. It should have been made clear that they function under Death and not necessarily Heaven."

There are Destiel shippers that don't want the ship in canon, Destiel shippers who want like... the series finale to feature Dean simply holding Cas' hand or giving him a really nice meaningful hug, and then there are Destiel shippers who're like ""IT MUST BE SEXUALLY EXPLICIT IN CANON OR I'M OUT"" -- but we've probably already lost those Destiel shippers within the past year or two since the writing has been pretty blatant how distanced Dean & Cas have become - they legit don't even really treat each other with any sense of honorable loyalty to one another anymore really. It's very weird and it makes both of them - but mostly Dean - come off like an unfeeling douchebag. You can try pinning that on the MoC but I don't buy that excuse personally.  Anyway, I think someone years ago in /r/fandomnatural said that JA could have chemistry with a toaster (lol) so of course Destiel was going to become a thing.

Just the brothers works if the brothers are in a good place with each other and most of the time they're not. We need actual side characters who can get Sam and Dean out of their own asses and help them see the bigger picture. Cas has fulfilled that need at certain parts of the story but he's largely been a hit or miss when it comes to other parts of the story."
Supernatural,3dv3ce,Kabar1191,3,Sun Jul 19 23:35:27 2015 UTC,"What frustrates me about that is I'm fine with there being side characters, it's just that Cas' continued presence (especially in 8+9+10) didn't really make much sense. I would have been much happier if he went back to heaven and popped in occasionally, and we instead had other side characters who tied into the main story. I mean we had Claire because of Cas. Our midseason finale was a babysitting episode."
Supernatural,3dv3ce,WeSingVeryLoud,6,Sun Jul 19 23:41:02 2015 UTC,"I hated the character Charlie, I don't understand why they brought her back for more than one episode. She just seemed too annoying and it felt like we were forced to like the character."

Supernatural,3dv3ce,Jebasaur,4,Mon Jul 20 01:45:23 2015 UTC,"Most of these probably aren't unpopular, just me venting.  Supernatural is 2 different shows. Seasons 1-5 and 6- current.   I don't think it matters what episode you start watching at, but I'd suggest the first of a season. Pick one and go, if you're interested in something you missed and they mention later, go back and check it out.   Sam is the worst thing about the show. Which is a bummer because Jared seems like a good dude.  Dean's obsession with being a good brother is depressing, not compelling.   Cas and Crowley used to be amazing plot devices and interesting characters, but are now holding the show back almost as much as the writing for Sam."
Supernatural,3dv3ce,HowDo_I_TurnThisOn,12,Mon Jul 20 15:26:06 2015 UTC,"Oh jeez, where do I begin?  I'm sick of angels and demons. First time we saw a demon, it was cool. He was powerful. Throughout the first 5 seasons, they were cool, as were angels because we just knew them as incredibly strong beings. But then shit got boring. Demons became laughable as did angels. Angels were capable of dying to basically anyone because everyone and their grandmother had an angel killing knife.  I agree with Castiel being just dull as shit now. And those episodes that are based on his vessel's daughter? Snore fest.   Rowena needs to die. With a knife jammed in her throat. And watch her die slowly. 5 minutes of bleeding to death will satisfy me. Her accent is atrocious.  While I enjoyed some parts of later seasons, this show needs to stop. The sheep that won't accept any faults with this show need to man up and accept that it has flaws.   I think ending the show with them taking down the Darkness and deciding to just get back to regular hunts would be great. Even better, break the fourth wall and say ""You know, I'm sick of these big baddies, let's just hunt small game"" or something along those lines."
Supernatural,3dv3ce,Jebasaur,4,Sun Jul 19 23:56:55 2015 UTC,"""You know, I'm sick of these big baddies, let's just hunt small game""   This. A million times this."

Angels were capable of dying to basically anyone because everyone and their grandmother had an angel killing knife.   I have some things to dispute here.  Demons: Early on in the series Azazel kept tight reigns on hell and the only demons sneaking out and doing their own thing were the ones strong enough to get past the guards. After the gate to hell opened, a lot of the little weak fuckers that were chomping at the bit to get out, but couldn't because they had to follow Azazel's orders, got out. Resulting in a net decrease in strength of the demons.   Angels: In the time when the Angels got cast out of heaven, they were weakened considerably. It isn't unreasonable that some of the stronger demons were able to overpower them and take their angel blades.   Castiel and family: Agreed. Fuck those episodes, with the exception of the fallen angel warrior. He was neat, but why didn't they keep his sword?  Rowena: I fully expected her to get killed by the Steins or work with the Steins and get slaughtered by Dean. I'm sad this didn't happen.  I don't think it needs to stop, but it does need to get itself back on track as a monster of the week show."

I just got up to the beginning of season 10 this week by watching the entire series for the last few months.   I'm not sure how unpopular this thought is - but it's crazy Sam's character is top billed - it's obvious it's more about Dean.   Dean's character is way more developed, more emotional, more caring. When their story lines split in two, like when they fight, they always follow Dean and all you get from Sam is a weird look and then who knows what he does until they talk again."
Supernatural,3dv3ce,lillalilly,5,Mon Jul 20 17:09:34 2015 UTC,"Well, this is more of an unpopular opinion in this sub than other spn subs--I love shipping. I love fanfiction and fanart. It's a natural part of any large fandom, and I don't understand people who hate it so much--everyone finds something they like in a show. Some people love the action, some people like the relationships, et cetera. Everyone gets something different out of the show and it's my opinion that no one should be shunned for that. I think the creativity and imagination of fans is really great and something our fandom should celebrate and be proud of instead of annoyed about. Few fandoms have such an active community as ours, and I think it's great.   (Disclaimer: I do not support batshit insane shippers who bother cast and crew, or harass others in the fandom... but don't forget that you will find crazy/rude absolutely everywhere and our fandom is not unique in this regard.)"

I would love it if they see the strong friendships between the male characters as something to aspire to. I would hate for them to think that if they have a strong friendship with another male, that the world at large is instantly going to assume some sort of homosexual overtone to that friendship.   I see no shame in homosexuality, love is of course love, and if either or both of my sons identify that way when they are older, I will support them to the end of time. BUT should they just want to develop a strong friendship with another male, I don't want them thinking (based on perhaps seeing what fans online distort the friendships in SPN into) that their friendships will always be perceived in the same way.   Can't friendships just be friendships?"

Supernatural,3du1v6,_phineas_,2,Sun Jul 19 18:09:00 2015 UTC,"They did it in Purgatory too. We know they have ""true"" forms since they have a unique mouth, so why not see the true leviathan?"
Supernatural,3du1v6,Jebasaur,3,Sun Jul 19 18:13:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's better left to the mind to imagine it. Also, being human keeps everything simple. The mind can go a lot further with how something looks if you're given hints but not the actual picture. Sort of like how at night time shadows can be cast off trees and noises can be heard that scare you but once you see what it is in the daytime it doesn't bother you anymore. The unknown factor makes the show better, it's what everybody likes. So leave it up to the imagination to picture how these beings show their true form, because if they show something that doesn't live up to it or anywhere near it you'll just be depressed."

Supernatural,3dtwhd,Sks44,4,Sun Jul 19 16:54:25 2015 UTC,Buffy has the better writers and villains. Supernatural has Dean. So watch both.
Supernatural,3dtwhd,Drogalov,5,Sun Jul 19 19:39:19 2015 UTC,Buffy is better written. And Buffy kicks major ass.
Supernatural,3dtwhd,spacednlost,3,Sun Jul 19 15:20:02 2015 UTC,Buffy is fantastic. You absolutely should check it out.
Supernatural,3dtwhd,Nyxia,2,Sun Jul 19 15:54:23 2015 UTC,"While they both deal with supernatural stuff, the two shows are very different. So if you're looking to watch it because it's similar to supernatural... You might be disappointed."
Supernatural,3dtwhd,Lavaros,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:15:49 2015 UTC,Different how?
Supernatural,3dtwhd,KateKillz,3,Sun Jul 19 15:21:53 2015 UTC,"Buffy starts out sillier. It's very dated, very 90s. It takes a while to get dark, but when it does it's amazing. Buffy is definitely the superior show. Joss kills it at character development. Get past the first season and a half (it's good, but cheesy) and you'll be hooked."
Supernatural,3dtwhd,Lavaros,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:46:19 2015 UTC,"The tone and set up is very different for one. Teenage girl is with a destiny starts out protecting a town rather then travelling and hunting random monsters. It does have a monster of the week formula though.  Also, where Supernatural is more about the relationship between the brothers, Buffy's main arc for most of the show is how to balance a normal life with the responsibilities of being a Slayer. There's also different methodologies in how the fight and kill things. Supernatural is very much ""Keep your gun on you at all times"" and Buffy pretty much states from the jump that they're useless against monsters."
Supernatural,3dtwhd,whatevers_clever,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:11:40 2015 UTC,"It's really not as different as they're saying. It's a lot of monster of the week stuff and a lot of story/character dev. Supernatural I'd a lot darker, but huffy gets as dark as it could at the time it ran on tv."
Supernatural,3dtwhd,TeamStark31,2,Mon Jul 20 06:19:48 2015 UTC,"Buffy is great, and I've lost count how many times I've gone through Angel.  Buffy is similar to SPN in that both shows involve fighting demons and other monsters. Both shows use humor a bit, although Buffy is more about the snarky dialogue than SPN is. Buffy is also more of a show about high school, so, that element is prominent in the first three seasons. It's certainly worth a look if you like SPN."
Supernatural,3dtwhd,elitemrp,2,Sun Jul 19 15:47:52 2015 UTC,"It's really good. I never thought I'd like it but I got the box set on DVD when it came out in like 2004 and watched the entire series in 1 go.  Like others said season 1 isn't the best. It's similar to SPN in that it's a monster-of-the week type show. That said if you've never seen it you kind of need to watch each episode just to get to know the characters even through really only the first episode, the Angel episode and last episode are needed. Maybe watch the pilot then read the episode guides on buffyguide.com then watch the Angel episode, read more guides and then watch the finale.  Season 2 and 3 are good, season 4 is different since the first 3 were her in high school and now she's in college. Season 5 is awesome and was originally meant to be the series finale (kind of like SPN) but then the show moved to a new network and got 2 more seasons. Personally my favorite season is 6 since it got really dark.  There are also some major standout episodes (Hush, The Body, Once More with Feeling) and then there's the Doublemeat Palace episode you can skip, don't even bother reading an episode guide about it.  Then you have to watch Angel if you didn't. Ideally you should check online to see when angel episodes aired compared to buffy and watch them in the same order as if you watched them when they aired since there was some crossovers."
Supernatural,3dtwhd,Zanki,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:32:31 2015 UTC,"It's very monster of the week like Supernatural in places. The issue with the show is that it has aged. I love it, it's still one of my favourite shows, but it's cheesy as hell in places and it just hasn't aged well. It feels like a 90s/early to mid 2000s show. In saying that, I love season one of Buffy, most people disagree, but it's awesome and sets up the rest of the show. I say take a look at it, watch an episode of the early ones, if you can't get into it, maybe go from the first episode were Buffy goes to college and see how you feel about it there then go back once you've finished the rest."

It's amazing"

Supernatural,3dtwhd,satanseam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:51:30 2015 UTC,Both shows deal with monsters and the said fighting of monsters. Supernatural deals with the relationship between Dean and Sam whilst fighting monsters while Buffy deals with the monsters as coming-of-age metaphors. If you dig Supernatural you should definitely give Buffy a shot.  Here's a video that perfectly explains why you should give it a watch (:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYPF0hgPjzY
Supernatural,3dtwhd,Jebasaur,0,Tue Jul 21 10:05:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I tried Buffy and couldn't stand it. The looks of the vampires is more zombie than vampire. Old show though..."
Supernatural,3dtwhd,HideousGrin,9,Sun Jul 19 13:01:03 2015 UTC,"Whedon talks about the reason for ""vamp face"" in the commentary for the first episode. Essentially, they needed to make it absolutely clear that this teenage girl was killing monsters, not just running around murdering people.  That being said, I think the only vampire that looked like a zombie was The Master, and that was only because he was way older than any of the other vampires.   Edit: A letter."

Supernatural,3dtwhd,MoreGott,2,Sun Jul 19 18:12:28 2015 UTC,"Me neither. Watched a few episodes while they were airing and it was okay. Tried to watch the whole show on Netflix a few months ago, just couldn't. And I gave it a fair chance of 3 seasons. Too much goofing around, too much teenager-love-drama and bad masks with way too much rubber. Guess you have to have watched it while it originally aired."

Supernatural,3dtwhd,MoreGott,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:01:33 2015 UTC,"yeah. I mean, some shows take their time to find ""their way"". And those that ran for more than 5 seasons usually have some quality, so I give them some time before judging them, especially if people keep recommending them."
Supernatural,3dtwhd,MundaneInternetGuy,2,Mon Jul 20 17:21:41 2015 UTC,"If you like Supernatural's goofiest episodes, you'll probably like Buffy. Other than the extremely Twilighty love story in the first couple seasons, there's way less bullshit whiny angst and a lot more wisecracking teenagers. It's a very fun show. Also, attractive women in every direction if you're into that.  The first season is almost MST3K level campy, though."

Supernatural,3drj2q,Rodents210,3,Sun Jul 19 05:08:00 2015 UTC,Even that could be storyline; Adam is released from hell but his time there has turned him so evil that John must be called on to take him out...

Supernatural,3drj2q,midnightsmith,6,Sun Jul 19 01:33:48 2015 UTC,"lol, I agree. John was a horrible father and possibly killed innocent monsters during his time alive, he shouldn't be glorified. Sam knows this but Dean is blind.    This is one of those things that if the writers are going to do it, they got to do it right. John would need to be in more than one episode and we'd need him to talk about Adam.   Also, JDM's request of only guest staring in a Jensen directed episode is ridiculous, sorry if you all disagree.   If JDM wants to truly come back then he should stick a for a while (so we can all get a good story out of this), not just be in some shitty cameo or in a flashback in one episode. That''s not enough, John needs a story arc so he can have a proper sendoff."
Supernatural,3drj2q,laurellestars,7,Sun Jul 19 02:18:38 2015 UTC,"Naw, I agree. John was a horrible father and possibly killed innocent monsters during his time alive, he shouldn't be glorified.

And yeah, I refer to the tattoos as the same (which, when I got mine, led to a whole discussion and the artist asking me to bring in the DVDs of season one to play in the background for when he did it)."

I wouldn't be surprised if there's actually a huge stencil for them to use when they have to paint the Devil's Traps at this point.  And yeah, it was a pretty cool experience. Aside from the show being on the screen (we only made it through the first disc of season one before the work was done), there was a stream of classic rock on the radio at the reception area; Mostly ACDC and BOC.

Supernatural,3drtn7,thearthworm,2,Sat Jul 18 21:08:21 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. There have definitely been some poor filler type episodes in season 10 but I enjoy the show so much more when the brothers are getting along and we get a good amount of the secondary but awesome characters. On that note I miss Benny too.
Supernatural,3drtn7,stophauntingme,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:05:00 2015 UTC,I had issues with the season throughout the entire airing of it but... y'know... honestly it delivered a way more entertaining product than season 9 did imo. Largely has to do with my perception of Sam's behavior S9 vs S10 where I was just thoroughly frustrated by the super sullen & nasty & grudgy angst Sam harbored for like... a whole year in S9. Compared to that S10 was like a breath of fresh air regarding Sam & his intentions & behavior.
Supernatural,3drtn7,Jebasaur,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:58:25 2015 UTC,They screwed up in this season as they did with the season that Castiel became a god. They got rid of what could have been something really cool really quick.

I thought I would share the players adventure for tonight and see what you all thought. So, the plan is for everyone, by some force, or by their back story,  will end up in a Hunter Bar in Wisconsin. In stumbles a wounded hunter, they investigate, find a wendigo cave where they meet another player character, team up to murder the creatures that are causing havock, and possibly unearth some clues about an artifact another player will be starting the game with. The overarching plot is that a demon who wants to become the King of Hell, is orchastrating this whole thing so that eventually down the line, he can find and recover a Tablet to earn his place as King of Hell. I'm having my gf, who also games, play along. She is going to be my demon's eyes and ears, but at the same time, I will slowly be giving her motivation to turn on the demon and become a fully playable character as opposed to just a playable npc.

They would be the ""Ruby"" character who's objective is to mislead or sabotage the others without being caught."

As someone else said, they're just sort of generic clothing, you can find it anywhere, it's pretty durable work clothes that can stand a lot of wear and tear before it needs to be replaced.

But also a lot of the hunters and fighter types also need extra things like padding and protective gear so the clothes can get even more expensive for a show that has a fairly small budget.

Supernatural,3dixjx,swampcactus,6,Thu Jul 16 17:19:11 2015 UTC,"White-eyed demons - The demon chiefs of staff.  Yellow-eyed demons - The demon army generals.  Knights of Hell - Some of the first souls handpicked by Lucifer to become demons (kinda like the elite guard).  Red-eyed demons - The demon deal-makers.  Black-eyed demons - The soldiers, thugs, henchmen, minions."
Supernatural,3dixjx,vic042,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:51:23 2015 UTC,"Hold on, how can you place Knights of Hell under white or yellow eyed demons? Knights of Hell were hand picked by Lucifer himself, they are the most powerful of all demons. The only reason Lilith (the first demon) wasn't a Knight of Hell is because the writers didn't bring it in till later."
Supernatural,3dixjx,Jebasaur,2,Fri Jul 17 17:43:21 2015 UTC,"I assume Knights are like your Navy Seals and what not but more. They are your Rambo's. These folk could probably step up to Lilith but their role is not lead. They're your nuke.  Of course it could just be that with Cain killing them all, White and Yellow eyed demons got promotions."
Supernatural,3dixjx,neoblackdragon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:40:33 2015 UTC,http://supernatural.wikia.com/wiki/Knight_of_Hell  They were basically the first demons. They are above all.
Supernatural,3dixjx,Jebasaur,2,Sat Jul 18 01:34:06 2015 UTC,"Some of the first, Lilith was the first and thus more powerful. Yellow-Eyes was a general and kept Hell running. Knights of Hell, well it's in their name, they're knights, elite soldiers of Hell."
Supernatural,3dixjx,vic042,3,Sat Jul 18 03:15:48 2015 UTC,"It has never been properly explained in canon that I am aware of. But there do seem to be various types of demons and those demons inherit differing characteristics. I'm limited by the non spoiler in the title to be any more specific, but this is probably the answer."
Supernatural,3dixjx,Kishara,2,Thu Jul 16 17:41:04 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure White Eyed demons are more powerful (or possibly just older) demons. I don't think there's any particular significance to yellow eyes other than to identify the Yellow Eyed Demon
Supernatural,3dixjx,IAmManMan,2,Thu Jul 16 18:52:47 2015 UTC,I think White eyes is the same deal as yellow. It might be some kind of breed but no one eye has to be stronger then another. Cain was pretty powerful and his eyes are black. The Knights had black eyes.   Crossroad demons have special abilities but don't seem more powerful by default. It's probably like hair color since age doesn't seem to matter.
Supernatural,3dixjx,neoblackdragon,2,Sat Jul 18 00:46:53 2015 UTC,Not really answered on the show they just seem to have more Mojo/Stronger than the run of the mill type. Demons just aren't as big a threat now as they were in the beginning so when color eyes show up the viewer knows a big bad or special shit is about to go down
Supernatural,3dixjx,o_MrBombastic_o,2,Thu Jul 16 20:42:52 2015 UTC,I would love to see it better explained in the next season. I am especially interested in Crowley's eye color.
Supernatural,3dixjx,auyer,2,Thu Jul 16 21:55:47 2015 UTC,crowleys eyes are red. im pretty sure it showed them in a recent episode. before the season ended.
Supernatural,3dixjx,MasterAlcander,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:26:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it did. But there is something special about his eye color, and this gets explicit in the 10th season"
Supernatural,3dixjx,auyer,2,Fri Jul 17 05:48:57 2015 UTC,It was more a lack of consistency. So Crossroad demons usually have solid red eyes like a black eyed demon. Well when they started they red eyes but a black pupil. Crowley were solid is Mama Kevin's body but had the Pupils when he punked Sam.   I think being King of Hell actually does juice up a demon. It's not JUST a title.   He's not special in his depiction. They just don't really feel the need for him to demon out.
Supernatural,3dixjx,neoblackdragon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:44:44 2015 UTC,"we seen Crowley eyes like 2 or 3 times now, when he was inside you know who moms, when he went into some guy to get info and last season, does anyone know if he show his red eyes when he went into Sam?"
Supernatural,3dixjx,Xetiw,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:43:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, and I almost fell like it was black black once... Maybe when he was in Sam?"
Supernatural,3dixjx,auyer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:51:28 2015 UTC,"And yeah, we've seen his eyes, but there is smthing special about them..."
Supernatural,3dixjx,auyer,2,Fri Jul 17 05:52:35 2015 UTC,yeah he doesnt show them that often it makes them rare i guess and everyone got excited when it happen
Supernatural,3dixjx,Xetiw,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:04:48 2015 UTC,"Sam was passed out, so we didn't see any eyes."
Supernatural,3dixjx,vic042,2,Sat Jul 18 03:17:12 2015 UTC,"This time there was a smoking effect with them, but the previous two times they were standard red."
Supernatural,3dixjx,vic042,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:17:52 2015 UTC,"Crowley also has Red Demon Smoke.  He's the only person known to do that.  It could just be him trying to be flashy though.  Which leads me to believe that the eye color is meaningless and is really just certain demons being ""flashy"".  Crowley being in control of the souls in Hell can probably alter his appearance slightly.  Other demons like Yellow Eyes probably just do the same.  The Knights of Hell were more serious about their roles in Hell and kept their eyes the standard black color."
Supernatural,3dhxrb,ZealousPrism588,15,Thu Jul 16 12:29:04 2015 UTC,10/10 would watch!
Supernatural,3dhxrb,FrostyShakez,12,Thu Jul 16 13:23:52 2015 UTC,"This idea is better in theory than it would be in practice.  The show would have to spend a lot of time following John as he learns the secrets and basics of hunting that have already been ingrained in the audience over the past 10 seasons. ""Discovering"" demons again and having to watch as he slowly reaches the conclusions we already know wouldn't be terribly interesting. Plus, there would be no real tension: We already know that, no matter what happens, John and the boys will be alive and healthy at the end of the show.  I suppose it would be cool to see some new monsters for John to hunt, but considering that Supernatural has been running for over a decade now, the well of potential hunts is pretty much dried out.  Prequels in general are rarely a good idea."
Supernatural,3dhxrb,EarthDragon2189,2,Thu Jul 16 15:43:40 2015 UTC,"i agree, i personally think the only type of spin off they could do would have actually been like the one they planned with Bloodlines. Focus on supernatural activity in one area instead of having another road trip show"
Supernatural,3dhxrb,ItsNotAPhaseDad,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:14:26 2015 UTC,Ugh they failed so miserably at that. It was so upsetting.
Supernatural,3dhxrb,JadeJabberwock,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:32:52 2015 UTC,"Well you say that, but John didn't know anything about hunting whatsoever.  And also he doesn't get brought into the fold.  I think it would be more of an interesting character to watch - single father, ex-soldier, trying to raise a family and raise two children in completely different ways - Sam as a child and Dean as a protector.  It would also be interesting to see how much he knew, how much he did to protect his kids.  It would have been a great opportunity to be able to open up that world, without having to do it through Sam and Dean finding stuff out (they need to do it on their own).   Plus, it has a sad ending - Sam going to college and the family falling apart."
Supernatural,3dhxrb,fulfilledprophesy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:51:18 2015 UTC,A sad ending that we already know and therefore has no real impact.
Supernatural,3dhxrb,EarthDragon2189,0,Fri Jul 17 16:06:32 2015 UTC,"That's not true at all.  There are tonnes of films and books based on real events where we already know how things turn out.  That doesn't mean anything at all.  It's the journey, not the ending."
Supernatural,3dhxrb,fulfilledprophesy,12,Sat Jul 18 12:06:08 2015 UTC,"It would make a rad web series.   10 x 10 minute episodes per season.  Story arcs could include: Meeting Jo's Dad & Ellen (ultimately getting him killed) Meeting Bobby & Rufus Chasing leads on the colt.  Meeting Adam's Mom.  Facing off mysterious old men of letters Playing poker with a 280 year old witch.  Staking a trickster.   Seriously, that series would rock, awesomely."

Supernatural,3dhxrb,Kishara,2,Thu Jul 16 14:19:55 2015 UTC,Things that are mentioned in the first episode qualify as spoilers? Just to clarify.
Supernatural,3dhxrb,Readyaimfire18,2,Thu Jul 16 14:49:00 2015 UTC,Yes. We have a similar policy to most major subs when it comes to spoilers. Day one episode one.
Supernatural,3dhxrb,Vio_,5,Thu Jul 16 14:49:48 2015 UTC,"I can't remember what episode it was, but the Supernatural: The Crossroads podcast talked about this idea at some point.  The problem they pointed out what that ""prequel"" spinoffs have to stick to a very rigid set of guidelines.  Nothing can happen in the past that would change the cannon of the original show.  That could make the show predictable, and doesn't give it room to grow organically.  So while it would be super fun to watch John's growth, it could be problematic as an actual spin off."
Supernatural,3dhxrb,Roook36,2,Thu Jul 16 15:57:52 2015 UTC,"The other problem is that the entire plot for John would be trying to track down Yellow Eyes, and he could never, ever get to that point in the show itself. It'd be an exercise in series-wide failure."
Supernatural,3dhxrb,Maken_n00bz_Cry,4,Fri Jul 17 00:03:45 2015 UTC,I'd watch it.  Sounds cool.  Not sure if the CW would go for it.  He wouldn't be able to use a surface pro with windows on screen if it took place in the past.
Supernatural,3dhxrb,casc1701,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:25:37 2015 UTC,"Meh, maybe I'd watch it but I'd would of love to see a spin-off with Charlie, Kevin and Garth BUUUT we all know how that turned out for those characters..."
Supernatural,3dhxrb,TheopholosWhenntooda,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:28:09 2015 UTC,"Not a good idea. The boys faced the Apocalipse, 2 or 3 times, Dean killed Death, their pal was God for a while. John only faced junior league demons.  You know what would be a great spin-off?  Crowley."
Supernatural,3dhxrb,Zezix,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:14:39 2015 UTC,"Nah, I'd prefer a spin-off about Bobby and Rufus."
Supernatural,3dhxrb,CaineMaster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:06:20 2015 UTC,"Thing is, John never actually found any demons. His first encounter with the demon that killed his wife happened in Supernatural. It would just be a pretty boring show about one dude hunting ghosts, vamps, and shifters. It would basically be Supernatural Season 1 without a plot."
Supernatural,3dk774,moshtilldeath,4,Thu Jul 16 22:54:27 2015 UTC,My feeling is that the mark would return (magically) as he reached his natural age.    Given the events in the final episode I think we can say that the mark wasn't destroyed when Dean was turned into a kid.  It was merely temporarily removed but generally still in effect  Although I suppose that it would still be a smart move to get him a year or two off his natural age just so that they have time to work on the problem without so much pressure.
Supernatural,3dk774,Agent_Dale_Cooper,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:35:17 2015 UTC,"I think we can say that the mark wasn't destroyed when Dean was turned into a kid. It was merely temporarily removed but generally still in effect   I'm not blocking this quote out since this link submission is flaired spoilers anyway.  So honestly I think this was just a serious retcon & the writers didn't know they'd source the Mark back to prebiblical times when they wrote this episode. Great great episode (one of my favorites of the season tbh), but absolutely no canon after this episode really explained wtf went on here. Like Rowena was supposed to be incredibly powerful - certainly on par with Gretel - and the items to remove the mark were probably way more demanding than whatever was in that age-regressing pouch...  OH OH OH! Cain was still alive and had the Mark during this episode though! Maybe when the Mark got removed off Dean in this ep it was still okay bc Cain was still around with it & so there was still a person holding the fort, so to speak."
Supernatural,3dk774,stophauntingme,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:41:15 2015 UTC,I think the mark would come again.... just a lil thought I think the mark is fueled by the hatred/the person itself maybe Dean didnt get to see the mark while he was a kid because he was more pure back then
Supernatural,3dk774,Xetiw,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:40:25 2015 UTC,"Considering the Mark is a curse that conceals the most powerful thing ever (God and the Archangels couldn't beat it), turning the time back on Dean wouldn't just make the Mark vanish forever. I think it was a bad idea for them to portray Dean without it as a kid.  I'd also like to add that the only thing that can make Season 11 not be a complete flop is if we see God and the four Archangels return.   http://supernatural.wikia.com/wiki/The_Darkness  Just reading that alone, Sam and Dean can't fight it with smirks and bad jokes. Hell, I hope they don't invent some bullshit way to ""kill"" the darkness. Don't mess this up writers..."
Supernatural,3dk774,Jebasaur,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:42:35 2015 UTC,"I assume that for that to happen, Dean would have to coonstantly revert back to the age before he got the Mark of Cain. I also doubt that he'd be willing to do that forever. As it's just a new problem to fix along with the Mark. It would of been a good temporary fix though."
Supernatural,3dk774,Lavaros,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:58:43 2015 UTC,The mark was probably just dormant. They didn't really have the time to find out if it wouldn't show up again.

One of the reasons I love this show is because it takes every mythology and puts it together. It's so cool to see them take down different gods only to have other ones pop in and be badass.  And season 6 is probably one of my favorite seasons simply because Souless Sam is amazing. He is a much better hunter than Dean could ever dream to be. fulfilledprophesy can mock it all he wants, but Sam sleeping around was a huge part of it. Again, he didn't care and he was just doing what he wanted.  It's later seasons that got bad because honestly...they just do the same things over again, use the same monsters over and over and the plots are just fucking bad."

But back when I was scared I was losing my faith, and pretty much all it was was angels and demons, and God's not around and he's left the world to rot, I had to back out for my own sanity at the time! I'm all good now though.  I think S6 is the only season that I haven't seen every episode. Because I came back in mid 7, and then watched what I'd missed sporadically. So I'm interested to watch it, but also like, 'hmm, please don't let me down...""  Out of curiousity, how would you rate the seasons, best to worst? Coz for me, it's  2, 3, 1, 5, 10, 4, 9, 8, 7, 6.

When Anna said only 4 Angels have seen god's face. My friend went nuts. ""All angels have seen his face!"". Not on this show. They follow most mythology perfectly, but they change things for the better for the story.   How would I rate the seasons best to worst? I'd honestly have to break it up into groups. The first 5 seasons are 1 plot in itself. Going with that, I'd go with 3, 4, 2, 1 and 5. Not to say that season 5 isn't great, but with the first 5 seasons it's really hard to choose the best.   After that, it gets easier to choose. 6, 7, 9, 8, 10  Souless Sam is fucking badass. Leviathan started cool, got dull and the weapon to kill them was stupidly hard, 8-10 have just been horrible. Cain was the most badass character but Rowena ruined the show. Her accent needs to die."

Supernatural,3dm6fu,stophauntingme,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:32:36 2015 UTC,"So I'm midway through S6, just watched the Fairy episode. You're right, soulless Sam is badass. Love how he's just honey badgering along, he doesn't give a crap, and Dean has to give him social cues."
Supernatural,3dm6fu,JadeJabberwock,3,Sun Jul 19 09:26:25 2015 UTC,It's actually rather surprising how tons of religious people absolutely adore this series. It's so obviously fiction that it rarely gets on anybody's religious-righteous nerves I think.  I can't be with you that S5's ending was perfect. Sam was damned to an eternity in the worst cage in hell with Lucifer for having saved the entire world from the apocalypse. That's too fucked up for me.   If the series had ended there w/Sam I would've probably been disgusted I ever cared about this show. The ending - with Sam - would've ruined the entire series for me. I'd never revisit or even think about it again.
Supernatural,3dm6fu,EarthDragon2189,2,Fri Jul 17 18:43:38 2015 UTC,"What I love though, is that both brothers finally agreed on something, and (semi) got what they wanted. Sam wanted to do that to save the world, and Dean wanted some normalcy (he may not have thought he wanted it, but the fact he saw Lisa in his dreams, or that he visited her before it all went down, showed he really did.)  Sam saved the world, Dean got a life that wasn't hunting. Everyone wins, right...?"

I liked the monster of the week episodes a lot (it was entertaining learning the lore and figuring out what each monster was) and the humor, along with Jensens complete existence, had me hooked!

Supernatural,3dbo4m,Jebasaur,3,Wed Jul 15 00:46:36 2015 UTC,"Well, you have to remember Kripke left with season five. It's likely the Darkness and other things weren't in his original vision of God.  I'm just gonna raise a few points.   When Death talks to Dean in season five, Death talks about God and himself being the oldest beings. Kali implies that other gods came to earth first / are older. Iirc one of the angels (Zack?) tells Dean that this isn't the angels' first planetary annihilation.   Perhaps the angels were just on another planet before earth? They wiped it clean and decided to head to earth where the lesser gods had already been hanging. A fact that strengthens this is in the episode where Dean is sent to the future, Cas talks about how the angels ""just left"" or something to that effect."
Supernatural,3dbo4m,MrFahrenheit39,2,Wed Jul 15 01:15:17 2015 UTC,"I do remember Zacharia telling Dean that ""this isn't out first planetary enema"". That always bothered me because it raises so many questions. At the same time, we have Lucifer telling us the fun story of how God made the angels, then he made the earth and humans and told them to love humans. So...where exactly did these other planets pop into the picture?  I figure I kind of answered my own question when I was typing that whole thing up. The Judeo-Christian god is no where near the first one to be worshiped and I am guessing that is what Kali meant."
Supernatural,3dbo4m,MrFahrenheit39,2,Wed Jul 15 02:22:12 2015 UTC,"Another confusing point:  Remember when Gabriel called the apocalypse sunday dinner for the angels? That seems to imply that it's a regular thing for them.   Then you have to factor in Metatron. Remember how he talked about God's miracles being so difficult and meticulous to pull off?  Also, remember when Cas talks about the fish coming out of the water and it being important (evolution)? This implies evolution took place in the supernatural world. Yet, we also have Gadreel(sp) who let the serpent into the Garden of Eden. There's also a reference to angels being stationed 2,000 years ago.  Piecing together all of this information as best I can, here is my conclusion:  In the beginning, God sprung out of the nothingness (along with death). God makes the Archangels and combats the Darkness. There is a problem while facing the Darkness and God is somehow lessened in power (or something so he can't appear often). God later makes the leviathans (then the lesser angels). Seeing how dangerous leviathans are, he seals them away.   I believe that other gods started to spring up right after God defeated the Darkness. The whole universe came into existence at that point. God made his angels to populate it. Random gods sprung up on planets. Animal/Human life began to form.   We know that God unexpectedly left the world for some reason and gave the mark to Lucifer. I'm guessing God left the world to combat the Darkness (because it wasn't truly gone).   So, the angels are off having their angel drama in another random galaxy. God decides that it's important for the angels to come to earth, so some angels are sent there (cas watching the fish step on land). God is tied up with the darkness for a large period of time. During the evolution of man, the other gods come to earth and have mankind worship them.   God decides that he needs a presence on earth, so he establishes the Garden of Eden and has his angels orchestrate the miracles. So now, the other gods see God on the scene and assume he is another god just like them. I think Jesus is also significant to the Supernatural world (perhaps he was God's vessel at one point).  TL;DR: God is the first god but is perpetually tied up combating the Darkness. When he finally makes a presence on earth, the lesser gods mistake him as just like them."
Supernatural,3dbo4m,vic042,0,Wed Jul 15 02:54:45 2015 UTC,"I'll go over each point that I can.   Gabriel saying the apocalypse is like sunday dinner, I figure he meant fights break out constantly, and obviously fights between powerful entities ends in catastrophe.  I don't remember that. Yes, Cas points out evolution happened, but the Angels being stationed there 2,000 years ago just goes with when Christianity happened. Simple.   The Darkness was defeated before anything was made, and it was sealed into the Mark of Cain."

Supernatural,3d8sbq,himynameisneck,7,Tue Jul 14 11:50:19 2015 UTC,I thought she was terribly written and the shows better off without her.   Also I like Rowena and wish Meg was still around. please don't hurt me
Supernatural,3d8sbq,chakrablocker,3,Tue Jul 14 16:33:49 2015 UTC,"I concur.   Besides I like the fact that Supernatural does not use 'the CSI recipe' for the cast. It is about two brothers hunting monsters, the supporting and other lead actors gets replaced from time to time."
Supernatural,3d8sbq,fndr,3,Tue Jul 14 23:52:00 2015 UTC,"From my understanding (which I learned from tumblr, so it may or may not actually be true) the actress who last played Meg is dealing with a health issue right now, and requested for her character to be written off.  If the character came back in the future she would likely be played by a different actress."
Supernatural,3d8sbq,mmokie,2,Wed Jul 15 08:02:46 2015 UTC,Yea I heard that too. Such a shame.
Supernatural,3d8sbq,chakrablocker,5,Wed Jul 15 15:27:36 2015 UTC,"I have so many things to say about this, that this reply will probably be all over the place. First, I take issue when people say that a writer did something for no other reason than to ""further the plot"" as though everything else that happens in a TV show has nothing to do with the plot. Like, of course Charlie died to further the plot, typically when something happens in a show, it is to further the plot.  Second, the insinuation here is that the show is misogynist because the deaths of female characters are used to cause pain to the brothers. But that completely ignores the countless male deaths who were used for the exact same purpose. Jodi's whole backstory hinges on the murder of her husband by her son, a device used to show that she's been put through the wringer, but I don't hear anyone complaining about that.  Third, I resent the implication that killing off a female character is sexist and misogynistic, when we do the same to men (often nameless men that no one gives a shit about) all the damn time. What would be misogynist is if they wrote a strong female character and then punished her for being strong, proved that really she was weak all along, denied her a dignified end. But they don't do that, they just write strong female characters who inevitably die just like every other character will inevitably die (or has inevitably died).  Would I enjoy watching a Supernatural with lasting strong female characters? Sure, I guess. Though I already have Charmed, which incidentally had only one male character that lasted throughout the entire run of the show, and they emasculated the fuck out of him. And I have heard women talking about how they just wish they had a character they could relate to in the show, but if you are only able to find a connection with someone based on what genitals they have, there is a deep problem."

Supernatural,3d8sbq,Piegan,3,Tue Jul 14 12:22:30 2015 UTC,"It's Supernatural, if you've bothered watching more than a single episode you know exactly why Charlie had to die. Not only is it in her character to want to help the boys any way she can, but it's also in her character to not want to work alongside a thousand year old witch who acts like she's better than her in every way, and thus she's going to not want to be around her, thus meaning she has to sneak away, away from the protection of Castiel, and where the Stynes can get her for taking the book.  And why do people always try to make things sexist or racist? Like, it's Supernatural. Yes, all the female characters get killed off, because every character gets killed off. Death himself gets killed off and he's infinitely more important than any random female the boys have known in 10 seasons."
Supernatural,3d8sbq,Kishara,6,Wed Jul 15 11:27:42 2015 UTC,"I think we can make a point about the quality of season 10 without going to the extreme of misogyny. Didnt we count it up one time and there was a pretty even death toll on both sides? I was plenty unhappy about the most recent female death without needing to find some conspiracy against women in the problem. The truth of the matter is that the writing failed. It failed horribly.   There are 2 lead male actors on this show and 2 series regulars who are also male. Any female character who is ever promoted to the audience is met with a mixed reception. So what can they do really? They cant pay actors that the fans wont embrace, or at least they shouldn't (Talkin to you Metafart) and a good portion of the fandom in the past has been unhappy with any regular female character being inserted into the show."
Supernatural,3d8sbq,stophauntingme,3,Tue Jul 14 13:46:15 2015 UTC,"I think we can make a point about the quality of season 10 without going to the extreme of misogyny.   I think a lot of people sort of enjoy thinking about things like misogyny/sexism, representation of PoC, representation of women, etc. in the media they consume. It's an exercise in critical thinking that I always rather encourage - & I know a ton of people who think about it & discuss it on various platforms & they change their minds or feel more confident about their convictions bc they get to go 'okay I'm lenient on this but not on that & bc I've thought about it & I can communicate my reasons for those opinions intelligently.""   What's unfortunate is people perceive this as ""making everything about sexism,"" when really it's just that people want to engage with their favorite show or book or whatever by looking at it through a different lens - gender politic lenses, racial representation lenses, etc.   Some people would argue that the gender politics lens is the default lens for a lot of critical fans... but I beg to differ: if the show is so bad about women, they really would probably stop watching. For example, I read the first Twilight book in college because my 13-14 year old girls at the summer camp I worked at urged me to do so. While reading the book, I couldn't help but think of how my little campers were perceiving this book & its dynamics as enviable or amazing - even something to try to model in their real lives. I was really disheartened - these girls were nothing like Bella: they were confident & independent & athletic & extroverted & rebellious & competitive - some were spoiled & others were scrappy, some were dramatic & others were no-bullshit... the list goes on. They were awesome & yet they were adoring Bella, who, imo, paled in comparison to all of them.   So at any rate, I stopped reading the books off this gender politics perspective - I felt so strongly about how the raw material was very grim for girls/women. Since then, it got even more of a following & I've tried my best to understand why there are so many fans of this book series - I'm convinced they're seeing charming & idealistic things in it that I couldn't. But since I couldn't because I was so deep into this gender-politics lens while reading/analyzing it, I just couldn't keep reading it. Similarly, I think if SPN fans were so deep into this gender-politics lens & perceived the show as just as bad as I perceived Twilight, they wouldn't be able to keep watching it."
Supernatural,3d8sbq,Kishara,2,Tue Jul 14 17:04:56 2015 UTC,"Yep.  You can look at racial or gender politics in SPN and have an opinion, but to blame season 10 on that is really myopic imo.  I really don't see it as at all an issue other than the fan service,  because this is what the fans demanded. I can't blame them for doing that even though I wish they wouldn't. The show is a business after all and fans are what keep it breathing.    Taking Carver out to the woodshed for misogyny seems a little like saying- ""Hey See that guy over there with the tiny  little fan service mole on his cheek?""  While the guy is  mounted on an elephant, has giant purple horns sticking out all over his skin, and he's burning down the entire future of the show. The writing was flawed. The plot mechanics were a disaster. There was no coherent arc. The list goes on and on and on.    In Carver's defense (what little I can muster) Sheriff Jody was done well again this year. I really look up to that character as a great example of how a strong woman should be played on any television show. And Donna is awesome. The girls in Fan Fiction were also really well done.   And you are also right about the consumer factor. If you seriously cannot get past what is being presented to you on the screen, there is a simple solution nearby in the form of your remote. I am unhappy with season ten, but not unhappy enough to end my time with the boys just yet. We still have a small bit of road left to travel together.   As for Twilight, have you never rubbernecked when passing a car crash? LOL"

While the guy is mounted on an elephant, has giant purple horns sticking out all over his skin, and he's burning down the entire future of the show.   In that case, claiming misogynistic elements in the show isn't an extreme but rather a bit of a nitpick, which I can roll with. It is nitpicky -- in /r/fangirls there's a thread in there somewhere with somebody saying they're disturbed by rape scenes in Game of Thrones. I haven't watched GoT & I was like, ""okay sure if somebody doesn't like rape scenes I don't feel any need to object to that,"" but tons more people were like, ""pshhh rape in that show is practically de rigueur. If this person was genuinely disturbed by rape they would've stopped watching within 15 minutes of the pilot. Not to mention there's terrifyingly worse & more disturbing things than rape depicted in this series."" Once that was established in the thread, I was like ""okay that's pretty damn valid too.""  In the end, I appreciate nitpickers as much as I appreciate long-winded holistic critiques of the show. They're not myopic as much as just focused & concise about the topic & lens they feel like talking about & coming from at that moment in time. It's interesting to dissect if you ever feel like joining them in discussion (and if you don't, you can just nope out from reading or discussing it -- but honestly the ""everyone makes everything about sexism!"" claim is so diminishing of people who just want to explore & discuss the topic)."
Supernatural,3d8sbq,Kishara,3,Tue Jul 14 18:17:41 2015 UTC,"Buzzkill articles just put my panties in a twist. I had to go read it again just because we have been at this awhile and I was starting to forget the salient facts lol. No more late nights on irc for me and subsequent insomnia for awhile :P   The girl is using a false premise to make her argument. She starts with a fallacy by saying:   Considering that women have too often been used to further the plot of male characters, why was the decision made to kill.....""   That is totally loading the question with a false premise.This  is what it is myopic imo. When you load your opinion in place of the facts.  Characters of both genders have been sacrificed in the name of the plot. They have to be. That is how the show operates. It can't operate without the side characters being trussed up like thanksgiving dinner. With J2's plot armor they have to use the minor characters as catalysts. That is basic bottom line mechanics.   We have previously  established that this is not unbalanced numbers-wise by gender (contrary to some opinion). Recall a certain political party recently who decided they did not like facts because it interfered with the narrative they wanted to hump? That is what this is. Opinion < Fact."
Supernatural,3d8sbq,Snoracks,2,Tue Jul 14 19:02:33 2015 UTC,"I do not think the person's premise is necessarily a false one.  They did not say that more women have been killed than men, but rather that women do not have a great track record on the show, which is true.  I do not necessarily think it's a great flaw of the show, as they tend to follow mythological material which dates back to a more male dominated time.  For example, they could have Lucifer have a female host, but most people imagine Lucifer as male.  Still, most of the women on the show have very little character or purpose and are brought down quite easily.  Charlie is probably the best example of a strong female character on the show and they decided to kill her in an extremely unceremonious way, helping Sam do something she knew to be stupid (again, as everyone pointed out, by writing).  We've had a lot of big bads and memorable side characters, almost all of which are male.  They all had distinct and amazing personalities and backstories which were compelling.  Eve was a great start in the right direction before she was brought down all to easily.  By comparison, all the other big bads were much more difficult to eliminate (Rowena surviving more than one season is a bit of exception, I'll grant you)"

I redefined it in this comment & sort of explained my take on the confusion between fridging & just plain bad writing. They're not mutually exclusive in my head at all (in fact they're often pretty correlated imo).
Supernatural,3d8sbq,Kishara,2,Tue Jul 14 19:06:53 2015 UTC,Yeah I can agree it was horrible writing. But the function there was no different than any number of other side characters they have killed regardless of gender. They just did a really really bad job of it.

There's always a chance she'll come back in some way or another.   Two - I understand that sexism can indeed be a huge problem on television and in movies, but how exactly is a female character dying sexist? Sure, a lot of female characters have died, but so have a lot of male characters. How is killing off Charlie sexist but killing off Bobby is fine? One thing that makes Supernatural incredibly suspenseful is the fact that no one is really safe and I think giving female characters immunity from that just because they're women would actually be sexist."
Supernatural,3d8sbq,violent_delights_9,2,Tue Jul 14 15:47:38 2015 UTC,"BELOW THERE BE S10 SPOILERS  I thought it was interesting, but I also got the sense that he didn't feel he could actually answer the question without pissing people off.   I thought his answer was decent; to be asked such an emotionally and socially charged question in front of a room of a thousand(?) people - the majority of whom were probably women, and some of whom likely have very strong opinions about feminism and spend too much time on the internet, I wouldn't have wanted to be in his shoes.   If I remember the question, it was something along the lines of ""Considering female characters' use in the show as primarily to move the plot forward, why did Charlie end up the way she did?""   His answer of ""Characters we love on this show, die. And we have to deal with that."" Didn't answer the main point of the question, but in a way I feel like he couldn't have done so - even in the most PC terms he could muster - because somehow, someone would have vilified him for it.   My answer?   Charlie was an awesome character, an awesome female character, who had a much longer run on the show than originally intended (as Jensen pointed out). In regards to her being a female character in a show where some FCs are simply plot devices, I think people need to stop being so tetchy about this. There are plenty of male characters who serve the same purpose. However, the world of the show tends to be a primarily male-dominated environment. The women who show up in it and thrive do so because they are exceptional in some way. I don't think this is sexist, I think this is reality. There are stereotypical male qualities and stereotypical female qualities, and those stereotypes exist for a reason. Men - in very broad terms - tend to be better suited to violence, killing, and everything else the boys get into. There are some women who excel in their sphere because they either share some of those qualities or are an asset in their own right. They have a toughness to them that allows them to survive, for a time, in the boys' world.  This is reflected in real life. There are stereotypical male spheres and stereotypical female spheres - there are men and women who cross into the opposite sphere because of characteristics or talents they have, which are generally and perhaps wrongly associated with the opposite gender. Female firefighters, male nurses, female carpenters, male secretaries (administrative assistants, nowadays). Just as a woman who thrives in the male sphere is exceptional in some way, so are men who thrive in the female sphere. Something sets them apart from the rest of their sex so that they can excel in both spheres.   So I think Jeremy could have answered the question very well, if he felt he could be honest and not have to painstakingly choose his words. He had a lot to say on the matter, as he mentioned, but it's a short panel and he probably didn't want to get too deep into the very lengthy and serious topic."
Supernatural,3d8sbq,Jebasaur,2,Tue Jul 14 13:48:44 2015 UTC,"See, this is one of my biggest beefs with this fandom. Every female character that gets introduced on this show gets torn apart by people after the episode airs. Heck, sometimes even before the episode airs! So yes, there have been a ton of female deaths on this show, but there have also been a ton of male deaths. It's not exclusive.   From what I recall, Charlie was not even that well received after her first episode and ""fans"" were calling for her to be killed off. Every time she was brought back, there would be a huge negative reaction by most of the fandom.   Jo, Ruby, Anna, Bela...pretty much all torn apart by the female population of the internet while they were on the show. People hate the idea of a recurring female character, but then get all pissy when the character gets killed off and scream that it's sexism!  Obviously, I'm not speaking of the entire fanbase here. But I can't imagine being in the writer's shoes on this one. It's one of those ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" scenarios. I don't feel like this show is sexist at all. From the beginning, it's been about the brothers. Castiel and Crowley were both well received and therefore stuck around. Maybe if people didn't throw a hissy fit every time a new female was introduced, one may actually survive for more than a few episodes..."
Supernatural,3d8sbq,MrFahrenheit39,2,Tue Jul 14 16:47:46 2015 UTC,"Characters die, get over it. I hated to see Jo go, she was a great character. Seeing Charlie go sucked too, but she did it helping the boys out, so in the end I don't mind. The fact that people are getting pissy about this is funny. It's like getting angry at any character dying in Game of Thrones. People die, get used to it."
Supernatural,3d8sbq,Jebasaur,4,Tue Jul 14 13:49:51 2015 UTC,"And to be fair, everyone who is close to the boys ends up dying. Sure, all the female supporting characters have been killed off, but the males have too. Their father died. The FBI agent got murdered by Lilith. Bobby got killed by the Leviathans. Heck, Cas has had his fair share of deaths thanks to the Winchesters. Kevin got butchered. Pretty much everyone who helps the boys out in some way ends up dead. (Even Death dies thanks to the boys).   Jody Mills is one of the only characters off the top of my head who encounters the boys frequently and is still alive."
Supernatural,3d8sbq,LateLateAtNight,0,Tue Jul 14 17:37:42 2015 UTC,"Exactly, thank you! I dunno what has gotten into people lately that they get so angry over female deaths."
Supernatural,3d8sbq,thecarolinelinnae,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:34:25 2015 UTC,"I understand why she had to die, even in the way she did.  Charlie had a great story arc; transforming her character from a self-contained computer geek/hacker into a warrior.  And although I liked Charlie, her story was over and ended at the perfect time to send Dean over the edge, especially given her brutal end.  The same could partially be said about Kevin (but how he died was more of a shock factor and came out of nowhere).  The problem I have is Carver not having an answer to why they killed her off.  He stumbled through trying to explain himself and then just gave up.  When being a showrunner, you have to support and have reasons for the decisions you make.  How do you expect the fans to trust your decisions and judgements and accept them when you don't seem to trust yourself?"
Supernatural,3d8sbq,mmokie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:26:19 2015 UTC,"I think Carver did have an answer, he just couldn't express it because no matter how carefully he chose his words, someone would get pissed.

Supernatural,3d62o0,Jebasaur,2,Wed Jul 15 00:50:18 2015 UTC,"It's odd, it feels like everything after season 5 is a big downward spiral that comes from the main characters' actions in S5: S6 is about the chaos in Heaven/Hell after things don't go as planned, S7 is the result of the events in S6, and so on.   I think that's the main difference between Pre-apocalypse and post-apocalypse Supernatural: The early seasons had the same flow (one season resulting from what happened in last season), but it all felt like it was building up to a climax. The late seasons just feel chaotic, the characters trying to pack everything up and finish instead of building to do something."

Supernatural,3d5so1,JadeJabberwock,2,Mon Jul 13 19:50:14 2015 UTC,I think this is a very poor move. The tagging system really fucks with the mobile apps and in general I think that this will lead to a lot of quality posts being removed due to improper tagging
Supernatural,3d5so1,stophauntingme,0,Fri Jul 17 21:33:25 2015 UTC,We're not currently removing any posts that fail to tag their submission titles properly. We're manually tagging them & leaving reminder comments to OPs letting them know they failed to tag their submission titles properly.   Not sure when we'll switch to simply outright removing posts that don't properly tag in their titles but I'm willing to bet it'll only happen when we start getting a very low number of improperly-tagged submissions (so no need to worry about slews of quality post removals).   The tagging system really fucks with the mobile apps   What mobile apps are you using & how're tags fucking them up?
Supernatural,3d5so1,JadeJabberwock,2,Sat Jul 18 03:26:12 2015 UTC,"Just because the quality posts wouldn't happen at once doesn't mean that there wouldn't be a lot of them. Im trying to air my grievances in the proper space without being rude and youre being a (REMOVED for personal attack by mods)  about it. In addition the tagging system won't let me view the title of the tagged post, showing just the tag to me, on alien blue and reddit is fun.   We want to hear you out but please dont call people names on the subreddit. I think we can easily resolve your concerns. The new css should fix the mobile apps that are not supporting the old css here.   Edit:   As for the quality posts being removed, the effort here is to convert the sub to what is standard for most tv subs of a certain size. As of now, the plan is to implement removal for tags eventually, but we are not doing it atm. Instead we are working towards helping people learn about the need to tag and try to get this all covered before the new season starts. More quality posts get taken down for spoilers in the title here than any other reason and the tagging system will not affect that. They will still be removed. We help the poster understand the issue and encourage them to fix the problem and repost. About 80% of them do just that. The same process can be expanded for missing tags. We can help them understand the problem and encourage a re-post.  We are doing everything we can think of to try and help people understand the process here and give some time for everyone to learn it. It is not our intent to be jerks. If you want to discuss this further I would be glad to do so."

If you want ""spoilery"" to be so legit that we add it for AM to flair, go ahead & message the moderators about it but I gotta say... if we include ""spoilery,"" I feel like we'd need to also add ""spoilertastic,"" ""spoileriffic,"" ""spoilerish,"" ""spoileryish,"" etc. & at that point I'm just like, ""no c'mon just... be cool.

No, because if everybody did this then it'd put a crazy amount of load on the moderators to manually flair all posts. That's not only too much to ask of moderators in general but it's also extremely impractical because moderators can't get to new posts to flair them as fast as automod can.  In /u/Kishara's post about implementing the new tagging system (which I linked to in the distinguished comment), she makes it really clear this system is used successfully & functionally in a ton of other TV subreddits... and the tags benefit so many people who don't want to get spoiled or whom only want to look at fanart, etc. This whole system is meant to serve you guys & your tastes quickly & efficiently.   This is a transitional period for our sub though - I'm going to be super active for the next week or so (as are the rest of the mods), leaving these kinds of messages to literally every submitter who fails to write ""[appropriate tag here]"" in their titles in an effort to help people get used to what we expect from them going forward."

We can't make exceptions: if the big colorful tag is not connected to a post, that's bad. If you read Kishara's post about it, this is in bold:   All posts submitted to the subreddit will require a tag from here on out.   We've informed everyone on this as much as we can - wiki page, sidebar, stickied message, etc. Right now we're not actually even enforcing this rule or penalizing anyone for forgetting or not knowing about it - we're manually tagging & reminding people of the rule.

Supernatural,3d648q,Kishara,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:08:26 2015 UTC,"First of all I need to clarify that Haunty is only leaving this message at the request of the mod team. Second, the automated process we are going to does not recognize the improper tag. So all she has done here is explain that this tag must be used properly so the new system can function as intended.   This is the show's off season and the reason we have done this now is to get it implemented before the traffic gets more unmanageable  and give everyone a chance to get accustomed to what most TV subreddits of a certain size are already doing.   Usually, those subreddits have not given a ""grace period"" to get people onboard but we felt that was a better option. So, long story short- it was either leave notes like Haunty's here or have auto-mod start pulling the posts from day one. We thought even though it was extra work on our end, this option was the better choice to help our group acclimate. So chances are you are probably going to see more notes like this until we start pulling posts straight away with auto mod.   We have added submission text, a sidebar chart, a wiki page, and a stickied mod post at the top of the page. If you can think of anything we missed that may help people to understand that this process has to be followed in the manner described, please be sure to let us know."

All I'm saying is that spoilery is in the title, and that the mods should be able to understand that spoilery works. Sure, most posters should put the proper tag in the title, and most will, but I feel like this instance works.   Think, the person who clicks on it will see the word spoilery and say ""oh shit, dodged a bullet there!"" And if they don't read the title, then that's their fault and no one can help them there."
Supernatural,3d648q,Kishara,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:09:07 2015 UTC,"We are being as easy going as we possibly can, but the actual format will matter and we have to get ppl used to using it. What I would really hate is to see this post show up in a month or so and end up having automod delete it because we did not spend enough time educating people about how this system works. Over on True Detective for example, we are much more exacting. We did regex some of the more common keywords here but there's a limit to what we can do on our end in the programming. We have to say: Use this format so your post is not removed in the future, because it will be.     I have loved this subreddit community for years and want us to do a better job for everyone because after all we have been through together we deserve to have it nice here at last. We started out just putting a normal spoiler policy in place 4 months ago. Gawds knows we needed one.  Now that people are used to that, we are upping the game. I totally agree that spoilery is ok if you are not using an automated system, but we are and we'll be pushing it forward before season 11 starts.   Elena is in the middle of the new CSS config here and once that is done and we have a few other projects complete the AM will be set to removal for tags(thats the plan now). I don't know any better way to handle this for you guys but to be open and honest about it and try to make sure everyone knows how this works and will work in the future."
Supernatural,3d648q,oftenrunaway,2,Tue Jul 14 15:28:59 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure /u/GoneParcel is misunderstanding what a tag is in this context.  If the mods were only wanting us to be courteous to new subbers and those catching up, then including a ""spoilery spoiltasticness ahoy!"" type preface in the title would accomplish that because all of those phrases are typically recognized as a warning by everyone. That's not what the new post tags recently implemented do.  The new tags must be VERY specifically formatted consistently so that they are recognized by the sub's CSS. Why is this a big deal? Because, it now gives subscribers the ability to query and filter the sub by content they'd like or not like to see, which is an insanely powerful community management feature."
Supernatural,3d648q,GoneParcel,2,Wed Jul 15 06:57:21 2015 UTC,"Eh, whatever. This has already dragged on too long."
Supernatural,3d648q,Kishara,2,Wed Jul 15 14:40:55 2015 UTC,"We have not gotten the sort implemented yet but we are close. Reddit has been having general probs with sort since a recent release and that is taking some  time on our end to compensate for. We have the am done and the CSS is almost there. So cross your fingers, we hope sometime this week."
Supernatural,3d648q,oftenrunaway,2,Wed Jul 15 17:22:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the update! I do computer stuff and coding for a living, so I can certainly appreciate how drawn out the implementation of new functionality can be. I just recognized that perhaps there was a disconnect it what that user thought tags were (which is understandable from an outside perspective) and what exactly y'all were doing here, so I tried to break it down a bit, hopefully didn't butcher it too badly, considering I know next to nothing about the existing set up y'all have :)"

Supernatural,3d3ji8,letstalkTV,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:06:02 2015 UTC,"I think that Jared pretty much all but says that Jeffrey Dean Morgan will be appearing as at least a cameo playing this ""Higher Power"" that helps Sam figure out the Darkness.  If Sam represents Lucifer and Dean represents Michael, Jeffrey Dean Morgan represents God.  Plus JP said the person would be related.  I think we are also going to see a return of Jimmy Novak's daughter.  Think about it, she was given the Angel sword.  That sword belonged to a ""botched"" kind of Angel that God created before most of the regular Angels were around.  That sword is probably going to be able to fight the Darkness."
Supernatural,3d3ji8,The_Iron_Zeppelin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:14:48 2015 UTC,"This really brings to light multiple things.  First, the Archangels are older than Leviathan, ergo they can kill them.   Second, God isn't the all powerful being people think he is. Hell, I've pointed this out multiple times. Think about it, he only creates things. He made Leviathan and then instead of just snapping his fingers to make them vanish, he made Purgatory and put them in there. Other than that, it took him and his Archangels (possibly other strong angels) to fight and ""capture"" the Darkness, but not beat it? Not very strong for an all powerful being.  Third, the Darkness will manifest as a human probably...but why? I figure we'll have an episode where Sam and Dean (or just Dean) talk to the Darkness and he'll explain why he isn't just annihilating everything."

I feel like this is probably too obvious so it wouldn't be a direction the writers would go in... but I think all of this is God's test on them. And the scribe/written future is still known by God but he chose to hide it at x point for the angels to realize their true place on their own, as well as the humans.  God is omniscient/all powerful/the creator... There's no way all of this isn't just a test by him because there is no way/no historical study/no angel or force that could defeat him or even reach his power.  Sam and Dean are Man. They're already 2nd from the top on God's food chain. Death or angel.. wouldn't be an upgrade. They are god showing the angels and lucien why they had to kneel before man."

Supernatural,3d17xe,hiimnoam64,9,Sun Jul 12 17:59:29 2015 UTC,I could be misremembering but I think all that changes once Castiel is introduced.
Supernatural,3d17xe,trixstar3,10,Sun Jul 12 18:17:46 2015 UTC,"I like to think that he believes, he just doesn't like God very much."
Supernatural,3d17xe,eir411,2,Sun Jul 12 18:34:30 2015 UTC,"I doubt that, he said so specifically in the last episode I watched (season 2 episode 13 I think, about the angel that made people kill others). It was just extremely silly to watch, especially at the end, when the priest sends the ghost back by reading a pray in front of Sam, who in return, goes back later apologizing to Dean for believing in God in the first place. Anyway, the show's amazing. I probably care too much."
Supernatural,3d17xe,stophauntingme,5,Sun Jul 12 18:47:16 2015 UTC,"Sam, who in return, goes back later apologizing to Dean for believing in God in the first place.   I've watched & rewatched seasons 1-3 so many times lol but not very recently... IIRC though, didn't Sam say ""maybe you're right & nothing's out there"" & then Dean was like, ""no; don't be so sure"" - goes on to say that he'd 'seen something' while chasing the serial killer & the final destination kill happened with the pole through his noggin' & Sam was all, ""what'd you see?"" and Dean was all ""Idk... maybe... fate?"" & that was the end-?  Dean acknowledging that was rather momentous - and sort of spoke to the possibility that it'd be something he'd be willing to buy into with just a small nudge of proof more.  Also it was pretty apparent that his rejection of God/Angels was a direct result of losing his mother & resulting childhood traumas. His mother had raised him to believe angels were watching over them/him & so when she died so violently & his life went directly to shit, he had two options: either his mother was wrong & they don't exist or God+Angels are total douchebags.  Without proof of either option, the least hateful/painful option would probably be rejecting their existence - which is Dean's perspective in season 2 (before he gets forced to recognize these creatures + God do exist... aaaaand they're douchebags, lol).  Sam had an entirely different complex with regards to God & religion. He was never embittered by the loss of their mother - never developed the concept that God was false comfort because of her death."

Supernatural,3d17xe,eir411,2,Mon Jul 13 04:29:58 2015 UTC,Im pretty sure sometime during season 2 he's asked if he believes in god and he says he wants to. So in the beginning he didnt seem to believe in him
Supernatural,3d17xe,whatevers_clever,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:42:29 2015 UTC,Yeah I hear you. Its more head canon for me. It just makes more sense to me to have Dean believe in the context of the show.
Supernatural,3d17xe,Petrichor02,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:01:03 2015 UTC,You'll see why they all don't care for god
Supernatural,3d17xe,Jebasaur,2,Tue Jul 14 10:14:04 2015 UTC,"He knows that magic spells work, so he might just believe that invoking God's name in an exorcism or for blessing holy water is just part of a magic spell. At that point in the show he only wants to believe in what he can actually see. So since he's never seen God, heaven, angels, or anything like that which can only be explained by those things actually existing, he prefers to believe they don't really exist. (This is possibly also due to Dean potentially thinking that if God or angels really did exist that demons and things like that wouldn't exist/that God wouldn't let bad things happen if he did exist.)"

I think the idea was too similar but The Originals at least has characters the fans got to know over the seasons. It was a Supernatural show without Supernatural at all. The new idea for a Supernatural spin off seems great. I haven't heard much more about it though.   I'm just guessing here."

Supernatural,3cyox6,thecarolinelinnae,2,Mon Jul 13 01:29:41 2015 UTC,"Because the people watching it were Supernatural fans, and we want to see Sam & Dean.  Also the shifter rules/lore was more wrong than usual, the acting was pretty silly even for CW, and it wasn't compelling. I was bored. The best part was when the boys showed up. I didn't care about any of the new characters; the main kid was whiny, the romance was contrived...it just seemed like a bunch of whiny 20-somethings who created drama for themselves.   Say what you want about Supernatural, but from the get-go it was a show about two brothers searching for their father, working through their issues, being there for each other, and kicking some ass in the process Tennesseean for taint."

Supernatural,3cyox6,friedjellybeans,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:48:04 2015 UTC,"The original idea I heard was that it would be about a hunter exploring the 'human' side of monsters. Kinda like what we saw in bloodlines, except in bloodlines it didnt feel like that was the take on the two leads' relationship.      What I took from the original description was something like Supernatural meets Grimm, you know, just not in Portland. When you think of supernatural, you think of the gruff, back roads Midwest, not two dolled up teens in Chicago. It just didn't feel like the same universe at all.       And even if it wasn't a spinoff, I still don't think it would have survived on its own, solely because it really did feel like I was just watching another version of the originals. It's like when twin movies come out at the same time, like Olympus has Fallen/White house Down, or No Strings Attached/Friends With Benefits. One is always better than the other or at least does better in the box office."

See how the organization was founded.  See how the Winchesters ever got involved.  With their in depth study we could see all over the Supernatural Universe through their eyes.  Maybe tell the story through the Winchester's Great Grandfather and his studies across the world dealing with different worldly Supernatural endeavors.    I also wouldn't mind a story about Samuel Colt and how he actually got the idea to create the Colt.  How he built the Devil's Gate from Season 3.  And just how Hunting was back in that time period.  I'd like to see the Campbell family before they came to America.  Supposedly the Campbells were killing Monsters even before  they came to America on the May Flower.  I wouldn't mind seeing the history there.  See how long their family has been Hunters and why they ever even began.
Supernatural,3cyox6,Gallein,-2,Sun Jul 19 00:50:21 2015 UTC,"As someone who didn't even bother the watch the episode I cannot comment on the pilot in particular, but I skipped it because it was uninteresting to me based on the synopsis.

Supernatural,3cup23,Petrichor02,-1,Sat Jul 11 01:12:08 2015 UTC,"So, the death of Death is him simply crumbling into dust? A powerful being like that has the most anticlimactic death? Either the show writers didn't kill him and are misleading us, or they failed massively in killing him. I mean, binding the dude creates a friggen earthquake. And obviously Reapers have been taking souls even when Death was underground so if he did die (he didn't), Reapers can handle souls."
Supernatural,3cup23,stophauntingme,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:16:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if Death did die, death as a concept will still continue since the Reapers are able to continue doing their job. And since we're told in Season 5 that Death can apparently be killed, it's not that surprising to me that the writers would eventually go through with it on some level.  Maybe Death is reduced to a husk like the other Horsemen. Maybe he was just spirited away to some other place. But until we see more in Season 11, the safe money is on Death being dead since 1) the current showrunner said he's dead, and 2) the writers don't care enough about continuity any more to make that big a deal about Death's death even if that was what they were intending to do. It doesn't mean they won't change their minds about Death being dead and retcon that too, but for now that seems to be their position on the matter."

Re: The Darkness. Sure okay it's strong. I was talking about how it's not evil in canon (cite):   Death: Before there was light, before there was God and the archangels, there wasn't nothing. There was the Darkness, a horribly destructive, amoral force that was beaten back by God and his archangels in a terrible war. God locked the Darkness away where it could do no harm, and he created a Mark that would serve as both lock and key, which he entrusted to his most valued Lieutenant, Lucifer. But the Mark began to assert its own will, revealed itself as a curse, and began to corrupt. Lucifer became jealous of man. God banished Lucifer to Hell. Lucifer passed the Mark to Cain, who passed the Mark to you, the proverbial finger in the dike."
Supernatural,3cup23,hallgod33,3,Sat Jul 11 01:11:13 2015 UTC,"Come on, killing the main Leviathan caused him to implode and take Castiel and Dean to Purgatory, but Death's...death just ended with him turning to dust?   You're acting as if Carver has any desire to maintain the continuity established by Gamble. :P  While I could definitely see it going either way, we've unfortunately gotten past the point where we can use in-show evidence to figure out what the writers are going to decide to do next or what will be the next victim of retconning. The writers just don't care that much about continuity any more."

Supernatural,3ctcv9,Desertortoise,2,Fri Jul 10 21:31:11 2015 UTC,Crossroads demons have red eyes. It seems that Crowley is as powerful as he is because of the souls in hell and perhaps learning some witchcraft from Rowena.
Supernatural,3ctcv9,Lucid003,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:30:11 2015 UTC,"It's got to be the souls -- there's really no other answer. We've seen the power-up that souls can provide when Castiel banished/destroyed Raphael's vessel at some point in season 6 and then, again, when he straight up killed Raphael at the end of season 6."
Supernatural,3ctcv9,Jebasaur,0,Sat Jul 11 00:38:30 2015 UTC,"But...Castiel had the souls inside him. Crowley doesn't carry souls in him, he just has them at this command.  As for how he got so powerful, I'm guessing it's how Hell works. If Crowley died, whoever is right below him would get all the power."
Supernatural,3ctcv9,Lucid003,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:02:56 2015 UTC,"Well, Castiel had the souls inside of him at the end of the season, but the loaner souls from earlier?   There's really no way of knowing if Crowley has souls contained within or not. Not all of hell's souls, certainly, but possibly some. At any rate, he can almost certainly use those souls as fuel for spells and his own power."

They've stated over and over again that it makes them uncomfortable. Posing for a photo op with Astroglide is a sure fire way to piss off an actor who has taken the weekend away from his family to be with fans. I just hate it when Destiel shippers do this shit, because they do it all the time."
Supernatural,3cpsqi,stophauntingme,6,Fri Jul 10 03:03:28 2015 UTC,"Posing for a photo op with Astroglide is a sure fire way to piss off an actor   I think Misha would be totes fine with it lol. He's a super smart weird good guy that'd probably get a kick out of it (& he's never really shied away from talking about Destiel - it doesn't make him very uncomfortable afaik).   Additionally, given how Orlando Jones is a self-professed Destiel shipper (who's come into /r/fandomnatural a couple times to say howdy) and then got to go to this past year's Supernatural convention in England with everybody, I'd say the actors themselves aren't particularly uncomfortable with shipping or shippers. Not to mention J2 prank each other by printing out & putting images of Wincest unexpected places around the set...(lol)...  I think during panels - when they're asked to speak about it - that's when they get uncomfortable. Not exactly sure why (I mean... when you've got RDJ who's 50 yrs old posting Marvel slash fanart up on his Facebook, William Shatner at 84 who's totally into fandom - & the SPN fandom - & chill with Spock/Kirk slash...) -- this day & age most people manage to send the message, ""hahaha you go on & like what you like, you weirdo lovable fans of mine!"" with very little discomfort.  Edit: also bringing lube into a photo op isn't really... forcing a ship upon somebody. And btw lube is just great all-around for any kind of sex btw - so based on that it's not even necessarily forcing a slashy ship, lol. I feel like it's pretty standard to bring some really weird props into the photo booths anyway & the actors have to be super on task & willing to roll with basically anything (JA even wore a tutu once... which was jarring to me lol... but he totally pulled it off so idk)"

It could be for GISHWES or a Misha thing or just Astroglide trying to make create a viral ad campaign on Destiel.  No, Destiel shippers don't do this shit all the time. Some have, most don't.  We are all more than capable of having this discussion without using ad hominem or resorting to name calling and throwing entire groups of people under the bus just because you disagree with their fan interpretation."

Destiheller is the one more about the ship coming from hell and seems to have been adopted by the shippers themselves? I dont really care all that much but just for clarity. You are conflating the two I think.   Anyhow I could give a rats ass. Thing that is pissing me off the most is the absolute bottom of the barrel shit post sitting at the top of our front page.

Supernatural,3cpsqi,stophauntingme,5,Fri Jul 10 13:11:02 2015 UTC,Both terms have been used pretty viciously against shippers; friendly shippers with a sense of humor about themselves have re-appropriated them... so basically using the terms seriously (& to indicate genuine negativity towards shippers simply because they ship) is kind of a joke in & of itself... edit: kinda makes me go
Supernatural,3cpsqi,Vio_,2,Fri Jul 10 20:05:26 2015 UTC,"They're part of the same package. Even on superwoki, they're under the same rubric and are used by the same fan faction that runs on promoting the same hatred against shippers.  This has nothing to do with shipping and everything to do with how people are being treated. There's a lot of toxic behavior in this fandom, and it's an easy trap to fall into. We can have this discussion easily where people disagree, but without the vitriol and insulting others simply due to a difference of opinion about a fictional show."

I mean, they spend long hours working and days away from their family to bring us the show we love and go to cons."
Supernatural,3cpsqi,stophauntingme,7,Fri Jul 10 15:13:56 2015 UTC,"I really don't think it is or should be any fan's job to like... police other fans in an effort to ""protect"" the actors. Believe it or not, they can take care of themselves.  Also we need to pull fandoms & shippers out of the shameful shadows at some point. The websites AO3 & Fanfiction.net have like the fucking kinkiest porn going on in there & it's all public sphere. Years ago MC actually went onto a fanfic database site & couldn't stop laughing over the pairing ""Dean/Pie/Castiel."" This is the stuff they're exposed to as a result of spearheading a major show & fandom & they legit crack up over it together. I really don't think it - or exposure to it - is particularly scarring. They probably have a lot more important things to think about than randomly & idly noticing a lube brand ships a ship from their show. Like this really isn't big or relevant news... to, like, anyone. Orlando Jones' fic recs are better news imo. lol."
Supernatural,3cpsqi,PrimesteFericera,0,Fri Jul 10 20:49:14 2015 UTC,"It's not about ""protecting"", it's about respect. Yes they know. Misha has joked about Destiel, I think J2 joked about Wincest a long time ago, but recently at the Rome convention Jensen stated that he thought the whole Dean/Cas thing had gotten out of control and he was glad they didn't have as many scenes together. That's a big deal. That means that our shipping has gotten to the point where it's affecting the actors, and the show, mostly because of Twitter which bridges the gap between our fandom sites that they can avoid, and their personal accounts.  I'm not out to police anyone, but for goodness sakes, handing a bottle of lube to someone as part of an award (which is what the Astroglide Twitter suggested after hearing about this) is kind of distasteful for anyone. Add into that the fact that Jensen clearly has stated he is uncomfortable with the excessive shipping stuff, and it's simply not nice."
Supernatural,3cpsqi,stophauntingme,6,Fri Jul 10 23:28:31 2015 UTC,"Well okay let it be known nobody has actually handed anyone a bottle of lube yet. And even if they did it'd just be kinda stupid & weird. I wouldn't get very angsty about it.   PS - That Rome convention you're talking about - that wasn't recent - it was JIBCon 2014, May of last year. He also wasn't particularly virulent about it, even to the extent of smiling when he said ""some of you know what I mean"" after saying,  ""I think the whole Dean and Cas thing has gotten a little bit out of proportion.""  He didn't go on to say anything about shippers getting out of control or affecting him & the show negatively - he didn't blame Twitter & say he was against interacting with the fans or anything. He's never outright said he's uncomfortable with Destiel, but he's obviously uncomfortable so I'll give that to you (although all fans in line are told explicitly & in no uncertain terms they're not allowed to ask about shipping -- and in fact the fan who asked the question in that video was only asking about Dean & Castiel's friendship in S9).  PPS - JA's also interrupted a fan asking a question by saying ""don't ruin it for us now"" after she said she was part of the LGBTQ community once. Respect needs to go both ways."

Supernatural,3cpsqi,CorpseHeiress,-11,Mon Jul 13 02:23:41 2015 UTC,"You are allowed to have your opinions, but let me say that if you go searching for negative, you will find it. Yes, some destiel shippers are rude and inappropriate. Members of other ships do disrespectful things too, it's not just destiel shippers. If someone does something inappropriate, raise issue with the individual, not an entire group of people. Sweeping accusations are bad and create tension within the fandom. If you don't like destiel, and you don't like destiel shippers, that is perfectly fine, but don't call someone ""fucking annoying"" and then critique their maturity. It's pretty hypocritical. Also, if you just share your opinion from the beginning instead of being needlessly rude, people are more likely to understand and respect your opinion."

Supernatural,3cpsqi,SundaeSchoolGirlie,0,Sun Jul 12 04:11:51 2015 UTC,"I doubt it'd get that far. If they don't allow shipping during panels/Q&A, I'm sure as heck they don't allow it in the photo ops. Ops of any sort are strict with fans meeting celebs, taking cellphone pics--even the number of fans that can be in one pic (usually one or two). I'm sure that with the thousands of photos they've already taken, some fan has tried (and failed) to pull some stunt. Your prop has to be approved before admittance, so if someone brought lube to force a ship joke, security wouldn't even let them in.  Edit: Not saying it's right, and frankly I wouldn't be caught dead in a supermarket buying lube, let alone pose with a couple of men who I don't know personally. I'm just saying it's unlikely to happen and nobody should get worked up about it. I'm sure the actors aren't."

Supernatural,3clad1,stophauntingme,3,Wed Jul 8 21:19:38 2015 UTC,"MAYBE SPOILERS IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED SEASON 10. WARNED BE YE.   Are some souls stronger/more important than others? (Yes, I am legitimately thinking out loud, not trying to troll and probably have had too much wine for an intellectual debate.) That said, it seems that through the series, and the manipulation by higher forces, that Sam and Dean have unique souls, perhaps exceptionally strong souls, fueled by the galactic forces (yes, I exaggerate a little) that conspired to bring the Winchesters and Campbells together. If it was so important for them to combine, can't we assume that their souls are more powerful? Case in point, they are the true vessels of powerful archangels and not just any person (i.e. any regular soul) can do that. Even Adam, half Winchester, was not capable of sustaining a force like Michael which Dean would have (canonically) been able to do.   So, the boys have been fighting monsters, evil, (minor) darkness even their whole lives. So this one Darkness is bigger and badder? Does that mean to defeat it, a voluntary sacrifice of a strong soul or souls could defeat that which has no soul to speak of?  The most broken heroes are often the strongest, the most resilient, and our boys have been through so much. They are battle scarred and weary, and yet they keep going. Isn't that in and of itself a testament to their ability to fight darkness, fear and doubt?  What is Darkness? Technically, and at its most basic point, it is described as the absence of light. In context of the spirituality of the show, Light represents good and Dark represents bad. I.e. Angels are bright glowy-blue light and demons vomit black smoke. Darkness is also considered the absence of God and Light a place where God is found. Is the Darkness coming a looming of the true and total absence of God that we have all wondered? Is this the big search for God?  The appearance of Chuck in Season 10 was never addressed or resolved. And (canon?) fan perception leans high on the side of positive that Chuck represents God. I'm not sure exactly what I mean to say by that but it has bothered me that his one appearance was never alluded to/discussed/resolved/etc. Maybe I'm a little bitter on that point. Was it on purpose by the writers? I don't know. And I don't hazard to guess.   This was much more stream of consciousness than I expected and I will wince every time I check in, awaiting flaming orange notices. I'm just thinking out loud here (not always wise on Reddit) but just in a companionable way of wondering and conversing."

Supernatural,3ci0xw,molonlabe88,3,Wed Jul 8 01:48:01 2015 UTC,There isn't a final word on it yet. It has never been said in the series who it ACTUALLY is.
Supernatural,3ci0xw,Monsterfueled,2,Wed Jul 8 09:49:26 2015 UTC,That's what I thought. Wiki needs to be edited then I guess.
Supernatural,3ci0xw,Petrichor02,3,Wed Jul 8 11:15:35 2015 UTC,"The creator of the show asked the actor who plays Chuck how it felt to play God in the Season 5 finale. The creator of the show also said that God doesn't appear in the first half of Season 5, but Chuck does appear in three different episodes in the first half of Season 5.  So either the creator changed his mind about Chuck not being God, or the guy in white at the end of Season 5 was intended to be God but not intended to be Chuck.  Sera Gamble and Jeremy Carver who took over Supernatural after the original creator left have both said they don't want to say whether or not Chuck is God because they like the fans to speculate."
Supernatural,3ci0xw,Warden_lefae,2,Fri Jul 10 00:14:47 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks. Sounds like wiki needs to be altered."
Supernatural,3ci0xw,Sengira,2,Fri Jul 10 18:48:03 2015 UTC,"I'm new to the series, only started this after the end of this season.  The season 5 final seemed to imply it was Chuck. I went with that.  I'm only a eps into season six, so forgive me if they middy the waters some."
Supernatural,3ci0xw,Sengira,2,Thu Jul 9 01:53:54 2015 UTC,"No, I think you are right, but I think the show was originally planned for five seasons, so it was a way to wrap it up nicely, but since it got picked up again, then I think maybe they've backed off some.   I would think that it would have been said in the show if they wanted Chuck to be god. Until then to me it is just a Fun Fact type of thing."
Supernatural,3ci0xw,Doobers,2,Thu Jul 9 02:24:44 2015 UTC,"To everyone that thinks Chuck is god!!! Actually Kripke said it to Rob as a joke. Chuck was an avatar for Kripke, God of the Supernatural universe. After Swan Song (which had Chuck disappearing to signify Kripke leaving as showrunner), Kripke made an offhand comment to Rob asking him how it felt to play ""God."" He never meant it in the literal sense. So while it is open for interpretation, I don't think we've seen the real God yet on this show."

Supernatural,3c9m12,D-Lowell,5,Thu Jul 9 17:19:14 2015 UTC,"It seems they don't really need the rings to identify monsters.  When Sam met Benny for the first time and shook his hand, Sam realized that Ben was a monster if not a vampire and would have stabbed the vamp if it wasn't for Dean's intervention.  Also, in the ""Bloody Valentine"" episode, Sam was able to ""smell"" a demon across the street and almost killed him.  Tara in the ""First Born"" episode had a trick knee that cracked painfully in the presence of a demon.  Based on that, it can be argued that veteran hunters or top hunters have an intuitive sense for sensing the supernatural or at least the usual suspects like demons, werewolves, vampires and ghosts.   But intuition doesn't seem to be 100% accurate as they still do the checks like holy water & silver blade test."

Supernatural,3c72ke,LadyLandshark,22,Sun Jul 5 14:01:32 2015 UTC,"I got my brother to start watching a few weeks ago, and while we've been watching I've been taking notes to make this! Spoilers, the main reason I did it was because I wanted to see if Dean actually killed more people than usual while he had the mark of Cain. It was actually pretty interesting.  Also should probably mention, ""other"" means they were killed by anything not included in the other columns, including other people, natural causes, ect. I also included witches since I feel like they aren't technically monsters. Anyway, here are some things I noticed about each season.  S1- Probably the most remarkable thing about this season was that Sam did zero killing. This is probably why I thought he was such a wimp the first time I watched. A lot of the deaths were via monster, which makes sense considering that it started off as a ""monster of the week"" show.  S2-Sam makes his first kill with that weird Clown thing, and starts being less wimpy in general. Also we see the first angel kills from Gabriel/Trickster. Something I found interesting is that at the end of this season, Yellow Eyes makes a comment to Dean- ""Are you sure what you brought back is 100% pure Sam?"" Immediately his kill number goes way up, so I guess that ominous question had some meaning.  S3-Sam's numbers more than double, while Dean's are at an all time low. Demons also do a lot more killing, and there's more kills by the Trickster.  S4-Nothing stands out much, although Sam's numbers are surprisingly low, considering how he was ""hopped up on demon blood"". Not too many angel kills either.  S5-Angel kills spike now that Lucifer is free. Sam also does a fair amount of killing, more than any other season.  S6-Quite a lot of killing in general, thanks to Cas and Crowley. More monsters are killing and being killed. All of the angel kills here are done by Cas, except a couple by Balthazar. I find it funny that Soulless Sam actually did less killing than Dean here, even though everyone was freaked out his morals.  S7-Most of the kills this season fall into the monster group, and since Sam and Dean don't kill any Leviathans until they take them out in the finale, they don't do a ton of ganking. I would've made another column for Leviathans, but I could only have six so they fall into the ""monster"" category. 32 of the monster kills were Leviathans.  S8-Nothing too remarkable, except quite a lot of angel kills. Angel wars are great.  S9-Finally, we get to the Mark of Cain. Dean doesn't go too crazy even with the MoC, killing only seven during the portion of the season after he gets it. Sam is at an all time low since he was possessed by Gadriel for a good chunk of time. Lots of Angel deaths (thanks Metatron!)  S10-Dean wreaks havoc! Demon Dean actually only kills two people, at least onscreen. Maybe they should've left him that way, because MoC Dean is responsible for more deaths than anyone else this season, even Death's death! Interestingly, even with the Mark, Dean's numbers still aren't as high as Demon Blood Sammy, or Traitorous Cas from season 6."
Supernatural,3c72ke,23423423423451,9,Sun Jul 5 14:16:52 2015 UTC,Those leviathans really hit more than they got hit in s7.

Supernatural,3c5e52,novapine,9,Sat Jul 4 23:29:17 2015 UTC,"Lucifer has always been a favorite character of mine since the version I saw in the Sandman comics.  That was why I was partial to him in this show.  Mark Pellegrino played him well.  The crazy actor who played him in Constantine (the movie) was another great version and that man is not attractive at all.  I like when evil is likable - even if it makes me feel dirty.  My only problem with Metatron was I always had a problem seeing the actor as anything other than Booger from Revenge of the Nerds and John Cusack's crazy friend in One Crazy Summer. I think the character was interesting but not as interesting as Lucifer either. He was great when they first introduced him, but I just didn't feel the reasoning for him becoming such a dick. I also had a hard time reconciling this Metatron with the one played by Alan Rickman in Dogma. Alan Rickman kicked ass as that character."
Supernatural,3c5e52,unbuckledpigeon,4,Sun Jul 5 04:32:02 2015 UTC,"I think the reason I liked Lucifer more was because I knew he was supposed to be a bad guy, and then he was actually kind of funny. It annoyed me more when any angels (including Metatron) went dark side, because they're supposed to be good, and then they get all high and mighty about what they're doing.   When a demon, or the devil, does something bad, it's like ""Well duh, they're evil."" But Metatron was like ""Oh I'm the hero in this story, I'm the new God."" I think these characters could be compared to Voldemort and Umbridge from Harry Potter.  I do get where you're coming from though, I feel like a lot of fangirls do base they're favorite characters on looks."
Supernatural,3c5e52,LadyLandshark,3,Sun Jul 5 13:57:48 2015 UTC,"Its debatable wether Metatron is worse than Lucifer. I think what Lucifer did was worse though, he caused the fall of man, and God wouldn't have left if he just obeyed God when he asked him to bow down to humanity."
Supernatural,3c5e52,Thepharcydee,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:14:01 2015 UTC,"I agree mostly. Lucifer was awful to Sam. Drove him crazy, kept him distracted, pulled him down into the pit and tortured his soul. Even kept it there for a while. but a lot of people still like Lucifer because of his looks and charisma.  Metatron has screwed Dean, Sam and Cas....even all the angels in a huge way. I think there was mention of some angels not being able to find vessels and dying. And so many died on earth because of Metas actions. And people hate him. But I think a lot of that hate stems from him not being good looking,  I don't think everyone feels this way. But I do see a lot of people talking about how cute lucifer is and posts on tumblr about how Meta is the most hated character."

Supernatural,3c5e52,Vio_,2,Sun Jul 5 01:11:34 2015 UTC,"I'm stating that people fawn over Lucifer because of Mark Pelligrino and ignore the storyline where he tried to ruin Sam. They focus on his looks and I see so much love towards the Lucifer character.  Those same people (probably more than the fan girls) hate Metatron because of his looks and the storyline. If he were played by a more handsome actor, I think fan girls would fawn over him as well."
Supernatural,3c5e52,MaddieLovesNPH,7,Sun Jul 5 04:56:43 2015 UTC,"It's not about looks. Lucifer has a much more compelling storyline- this entire show revolves around Lucifer and his sociopathic ego that is built on thousands of years of storytelling and religion. The failure of Mwtatron as a compelling character is the failure of Carver in general- superficial characters with very little depth and fully fleshed out plots that often lack coherence and consistency.  Lucifer is supposed to be seductive and compelling and have very solid logic points. That's not Supernatural, that's the Bible and Milton."

Supernatural,3c1y4e,molonlabe88,8,Sat Jul 4 00:32:34 2015 UTC,"The usual answer when this topic comes up is that it's five species: God, Archangels (sometimes all angels), Leviathans, The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, and Knights of Hell (including the bearer of the Mark of Cain). Eve used to be on most of them but Abaddon mostly replaced her.  However, Lucifer said ""There are five beings in all of creation that that gun can't kill, and I'm one of them"". Not ""and Archangels are one of them"" or ""and angels are one of them"", but ""and I'm one of them"". This implies he's talking about five individuals.  Lucifer is known to be one of them. From there, we can assume Michael, being more powerful, is also one. It's safe to assume God and Death, for obvious reasons. The fifth one was ambiguous at the time, but after the S10 finale revealed that Death himself can't kill the Mark of Cain's bearer (yes, can't, not won't-he clearly tells Dean ""Nothing can kill you""), that's probably the last one.  As for the other things people usually list:  Archangels in general: This would seem the most obvious one since we already know Lucifer to be one. However, remember that Castiel introduced holy fire for the purpose of trapping/killing Raphael, and it's later used to trap Gabriel. Yet, when Michael is hit with holy fire, it's only a mild inconvenience. This shows that it's possible to have a weapon powerful enough to kill Raphael and Gabriel, but merely annoy Michael and possibly Lucifer.  Horsemen of the Apocalypse: If Death really is dead, that would mean Horsemen can be killed and do not exist as long as their concept exists as is often assumed. War, Famine, and Pestilence don't seem to be on the same tier as the Archangels, so if we acknowledge the Colt as killing (some) Archangels it's logical to assume it can also kill Horsemen.  Leviathans: ""But"", you may say, ""God himself said the only thing that can kill them is with that righteous bone thing."" Yeah, that was on Metatron's tablet. The one written centuries before guns existed, let alone the Colt. We clearly see that even then, it wasn't true. Leviathans are killed by being eaten by other Leviathans or by being forced to eat themselves. It seems like the key to killing a Leviathan is to destroy their vessel completely. Also, yeah, Leviathans can kill angels. Archangels can also kill regular angels. The difference is Leviathans need contact while Archangels can just snap their fingers and make regular angels die.  Knights of Hell: It's stated in the show that only the First Blade can kill a Knight of Hell. Stated by Cain, who may not have even known the Colt existed. Also stated by Crowley, who did know about the Colt, but seems to have sort of forgotten about it the same way the rest of the main characters have, and who also had an ulterior motive for wanting Dean to take on the Mark of Cain. Anyways, Lucifer probably wouldn't have been including them even if they can't be killed because they were thought to be all dead at the time.  The Darkness: It seems pretty obvious that the Colt wouldn't work here, but is The Darkness even a living thing to begin with?"
Supernatural,3c1y4e,funwiththoughts,3,Sat Jul 4 11:18:16 2015 UTC,That was a very thought out and informative answer. It raises some great points. I'm going to have to circle back around when I get time and read it again and look at your links. Thanks!
Supernatural,3c1y4e,Petrichor02,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:20:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything here except that:  1) I don't think God (and likely Death) should be included on the list since Lucifer says there are only five things in all of creation that can be killed by the Colt. Lucifer is talking about God's creation; so unless God created himself, God can't be on the list. And since Death implies that he was around before God started creating, that would suggest that Death can't be on the list either. This line of thought would also apply to the Darkness.  2) I think we should note that even though Michael is objectively more powerful than Lucifer, Lucifer being immune to the Colt doesn't necessarily mean Michael would be. For just one example, if Lucifer is immune to the Colt because of his connection to the Mark and the Darkness, Michael would have no such immunity.  Otherwise, this is a great write-up. Well done."
Supernatural,3c1y4e,Jebasaur,3,Sun Jul 5 18:17:18 2015 UTC,"I actually made a video about this and it's a fun debate. The first thing to point out is Lucifer said ""in all of creation"". So, that means things that were created. God and Death are out because both have basically existed for all Eternity. Then it turns into, well Lucifer can't be killed, and he is weaker than Michael, so Michael is another. That's 2 of the 5. So, either there are 3 other specific people/monsters, or we can just go with it's certain species, which brings it down to 1 because both Lucifer and Michael are Archangels.  This is a topic I've discussed with many people, but I think the fact that Castiel thought the Colt would work on Lucifer means that the Colt works on regular Angels, so Archangels are probably too powerful for it. Which means Leviathans are too strong for it, as is the bearer of the Mark of Cain. Anyone who says God or Death is wrong, simply because God and Death are not a part of creation."

There's.... several orders of magnitude power difference between Archangels and regular angels. I'd be surprised if they couldn't nuke leviathans just fine - but of course they were all dead, in the pit, or faking during that incident."

Supernatural,3c03sq,novemberpapa,3,Fri Jul 3 20:45:49 2015 UTC,"In their defense (which I hate to do, especially today)  it is not that they did not recognize the problem. They understood what we were dealing with. The issue there was that the site rules do not leave any ambiguity about what mods can and cannot do with a subreddit. Usually, this is not at all a problem. This situation was the ugly farthole in a sea of mods that actually do care about the subreddits they volunteer for and would never ever intentionally do anything to make them worse.  That said, it was outrageous that they refused to step in and handle this and we had to do it without their help."
Supernatural,3c03sq,novemberpapa,4,Fri Jul 3 20:57:59 2015 UTC,"I think that the admins should've made an exception for Nick, our situation was less extreme but had parallels with r/wow's situation; technically the head mod can do whatever they want with their subreddit, but that doesn't mean they should or that they should be allowed to.  BTW, how the hell did you manage to convince Nick to step down as mod?"

As for how this happened.  I made a comment when our own SPN REVOLT was going on. I helped him understand the situation and the fact that the only way it would end satisfactorily was if he  stepped aside. Personality issues aside, he really is a fan of the show and I think he will be much happier without this extra weight on him.   Being a moderator takes a ton of patience. You need to have a thick skin. Some people cannot fit themselves in this role and react badly to the extra stress that comes with it. If you do not have stellar intentions and are unwilling to hear the needs of the community you serve, it will not go well for you or for your subreddit.   I mod a few TV subs and get that we cannot make everything perfect for every person. What we can do is serve the group the best way we know how. We are only here to help out. It's never about anything other than doing the best job we can for the community as a whole. To that end, we need a better partnership with the Reddit admins to facilitate that goal.

Jo might not have been dead yet, but with wounds that deep she probably couldn't keep on moving.

Ellen could have survived, but she didn't want to.  She had lost her husband, and was about to lose her daughter, the daughter that she had tried so hard to keep away from this life so she wouldn't have to see exactly what she was seeing now.

I believe (I could be wrong I have been before) that it involved blowing it under the crack at the base of the wall. Apparently, the cockroaches won't cross the Borax so it keeps your place at least more roach free. Gratefully, we didn't have roaches. Thankfully.

Just made some traps with it today. :P  Mix some sugar or corn syrup in water and leave out on a surface away from domestic pets. The ants will eat it and carry it back to the colony solving the whole problem.
Supernatural,3by2e9,AGhostLP,2,Fri Jul 3 06:40:14 2015 UTC,"You have to get your sweet to borax ratio just right, though, or the ants won't touch it.  We had a carpenter ant infestation last year, and my dad, who worked for Orkin, told me to make mint jelly traps with borax. Put a tiny bit of borax in a bottle cap, mix in the jelly. Dad said he would taste it to make sure he had it mixed just right.... Taste it, Dad, are you sure that's safe? It's just soap! he said. I did it all the time!  So, my traps were too boraxy because I refused to taste my ant traps & the ants wouldn't go near them. I bought those Terro liquid ant baits & they did the trick. And I think they're made with borax."

Supernatural,3c1yc4,molonlabe88,11,Sat Jul 4 00:34:34 2015 UTC,"The show was pretty vague about the timeline of things. This is what the Super Wiki has on the timeline of events.  In the Beginning Before there was light, before there was God and the archangels there was the Darkness; an amoral destructive force that occupied the universe. God and Death come into existence, and God with his archangels beat back the Darkness and locked it away, banning it from reentering the universe by creating a Mark to act as both lock and key. God entrusts the Mark to his most loyal lieutenant, Lucifer. God creates the Leviathans, but grows concerned that they will try to destroy His other creations. He creates the realm of Purgatory to contain them, and seals the Leviathans away. God then creates celestial beings known as angels, with various sub classes which include Grigori, Rit Zien and Cherubs all of which will dwell in Heaven with Him creating an angelic society collectively known as the Host of Heaven. The Grigori are some of the first angels to be placed on Earth to watch and protect humanity. However when they begin feeding on the souls of humans, they are wiped out. The Mark begins asserting its own will and begins to corrupt Lucifer, amplifying his jealously of mankind. When God instructs the angels that they should bow down to humanity, Lucifer refuses because he sees humanity as flawed and unworthy. Lucifer entreats his brother Michael to support him but he refuses. Gabriel tires of the family arguments and leaves Heaven, hiding on Earth disguised as the Trickster Loki. Lucifer persuades Gadreel to allow him access to the Garden/Earth. In defiance of God, Lucifer takes humans, strips them of their humanity and creates demons. The first of these is Lilith. God instructs Michael to cast Lucifer out of Heaven. Lucifer begins communicating with Abel, when Cain realizes what Lucifer has planned he strikes a deal with the archangel: Abel's soul in Heaven, for his in Hell. Lucifer accepts the terms, on the condition that Cain be the one to kill Abel. Lucifer passes the Mark on to Cain. Unwilling to become the killer the Mark wants him to be, Cain attempts to kill himself with the First Blade, but is resurrected as a demon. Lucifer hand picks humans for Cain to turn into demons (of which include Abaddon), and has him create the demonic order known as the Knights of Hell. Having seen enough, God imprisons Lucifer with six-hundred seals, sixty six of which have to be broken for Lucifer to escape his confinement In the 10th millennium BC Eve finds her way from Purgatory to Earth, and begins birthing the first monsters -- the Alphas, before she is sent back to Purgatory."

One other way is to go into the object properties and adjust it's luminescence, or the properties of the color. It doesn't have to glow like a light bulb, but enough to make it lighter in color."

This ""Darkness"" is something that God and his Host of angels have fought and they couldn't kill it, they simply sealed it away in a mark. The mark is given to Lucifer, who apparently gets infected and turns evil, and that in turn leads to everything else. The writers really should have thought about bringing this idea in sooner than the last 5 minutes of the fucking finale.  The only salvation for this show at this point really needs to be an all out battle. God (Chuck), Michael, Lucifer and bring back Gabriel and Raphael. I don't want some BS weapon to be created like they did when they got rid of the Leviathan, and the spell requirements for the mark were gotten in seconds. Literally seconds. How pathetic."

So even if Sam and Dean had managed to recover Gabriel's blade, it wouldn't have worked.  But that was just how I interpreted that episode. If the brothers could have used the blade themselves, this ending could have been a good alternative."

After all, if archangel blades could kill archangels regardless of the wielder, why didn't Gabriel say that the brothers still have a chance to kill Lucifer with an archangel blade in the video he left them telling them about the Horsemen Rings plan?

Are you saying an archangel blade is/could be just an angel blade wielded by an archangel? If not, I'm not seeing the connection.   After all, if archangel blades could kill archangels regardless of the wielder, why didn't Gabriel say that the brothers still have a chance to kill Lucifer with an archangel blade in the video he left them telling them about the Horsemen Rings plan?   Gabriel talked in ""Changing Channels"" about how he still loved his brothers and would give anything not to have the apocalyptic battle where Lucifer was meant to die take place. I'm not sure he actually wanted the Winchesters to kill Lucifer.*  *The obvious counterargument would be that Gabriel was willing to trap Lucifer in the cage (presumably) for eternity. However, Lucifer had already been in the cage for millennia, and didn't seem particularly damaged by the experience when he got out, so it's not really a fair comparison."
Supernatural,3bp4r5,funwiththoughts,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:03:40 2015 UTC,"Another counterargument is simply the fact that Gabriel was willing to kill Lucifer himself until Lucifer managed to kill Gabriel first.   Are you saying an archangel blade is/could be just an angel blade wielded by an archangel?   It could be, but that's not what I was saying. I was saying that because we're told that the blade operates differently but it still looks the same, there must be some truth to the fact that the blade operates differently."

Supernatural,3bp4r5,funwiththoughts,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:43:29 2015 UTC,"The writers haven't confirmed it, but the implication is there (though that doesn't really make sense because Metatron was controlling everything Cas saw).  That said, it obviously wasn't the writers' original intent for Gabriel to have faked his death, and even if he did fake his death, that doesn't mean he didn't try to kill Lucifer."
Supernatural,3bp4r5,Petrichor02,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:01:31 2015 UTC,"As far as ""Meta Fiction"" goes, I read on tvtropes that one of the writers confirmed it, but I don't know what the original source for that is.  I rewatched ""Hammer of the Gods"" just before typing this comment since I was going off vague recollections. First thing I noticed is Gabriel tells Dean ""You think I'd give Kali my real sword? That thing can kill me!"" which makes no sense if Kali (who, while very powerful, was not on the level of the Archangels) couldn't have killed him with it to begin with. Also, nobody questions it when they think Kali HAS killed him with his own blade (even though that time he actually did fake his own death).  The second thing is that we never actually see Gabriel trying to kill Lucifer. I mean, we see him standing behind Lucifer with his Archangel blade in hand, but Lucifer grabs his blade and kills him before he actually attacks. The other Gabriel then disappears. Assuming that Gabriel did fake his death, that would presumably mean that Lucifer was supposed to stab the one he did, and the one that disappeared without trying to do anything was the real one.  Now, if Gabriel really was killed, then I honestly don't know why he didn't mention it."
Supernatural,3bp4r5,DisgorgeX,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:39:12 2015 UTC,"That's a good point about Kali. I had forgotten about that.  I hope that if they do decide that Gabriel is still alive they go with some sort of ""dead archangels are able to reconstitute themselves over time"" or ""Gabriel was resurrected by God"" thing rather than Gabriel actually faking his death in Hammer of the Gods since the dead Gabriel didn't fade, had the wing burns which indicate a true death, etc."

Supernatural,3bp4tf,Tserraknight,4,Wed Jul 1 03:40:59 2015 UTC,"Being on the CW has its advantages, mostly that they have a lower standard when it comes to ratings, which is why Supernatural has been able to go 11 seasons. If the show was on any other network, it probably would have been cancelled in the second season. I mean just look at the ratings for iZombie, it should have been cancelled halfway through the season, and yet it was renewed. That wouldn't happen on NBC."
Supernatural,3bp4tf,vic042,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:02:33 2015 UTC,It's a niche show the same way something like stargate was a niche show. They - hopefully - end up on networks not expecting CSI type ratings and can survive for quite awhile there because the costs and expectations are different. Put supernatural on NBC or ABC or something and it wouldn't last more than a couple seasons. People get defensive about the term 'niche'. They seem to equate niche with bad which isn't what it means at all.  Sorry for the rant. Hope the comparison makes a bit of sense.

Supernatural,3bp4tf,DisgorgeX,2,Fri Jul 3 10:06:09 2015 UTC,"Then you could switch between Dean, Sam, Castiel, and bobby possibly. Like Michael, Trevor, and Franklin. But the game should have like a separate plot from the series and not use the same plot as any of the seasons but still have Crowley, and whatnot. The map would need to be HUGE. And you'd drive the impala of course. Also there's need to be different inviroments like small towns, woods neighborhoods, or cities. And missions and stuff that's not part of the plot like the in between episodes. Or it could be like The Last of Us where you could still switch characters depending which ones are part of the plot line. And there's be a lot of driving too. Also, for either idea, there's be a ""Then and Now"" sequence between each mission/chapter, and the last one would do the ""Carry on Wayward Son"" like at the end of each season, and there'd be parts where you'd play as Castiel as well. That'd be pretty cool."

For ""research mode"" and interrogations I would use a point and click style. (in third person)  I would try adding facial expressions to see if the suspect is lying or not. I'd allow the player to switch between characters at any time. So for example if Dean gets caught he could try to escape himself, or you switch to Sam to save him.   I love the survival aspect in games; I wouldn't use a health bar. You could brake bones or bleed to death if left unintended. (Like Metal Gear Solid 3)  Supernatural is a niche series and the viewership numbers aren’t that high. It requires a Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad hype, before a game is worth producing."

Uriel told Castiel that ""the only thing that can kill an angel is another angel"", but then we find out that angels can also be killed by Leviathans, humans/demons with access to angelic weapons, and (if you believe Alastair) high-ranking demons.

Supernatural,3b9prb,IggyStraker,5,Sat Jun 27 23:21:19 2015 UTC,And not to mention the messy end that Lilith met. The show probably felt insanely uncomfortable with doing that to a child so Lilith remained in the comely hygienist.

Supernatural,3bb207,EmergencyFoodSupply,7,Sat Jun 27 20:18:18 2015 UTC,"I always figured it was more a case of they didn't take her on rather than couldn't. I mean, this is Sam and Dean motherfucking Winchester, I'm pretty sure they could kill absolutely anything they really wanted to.  And was it Fate in the Final Destination movies? I seem to remember a comment about it being Death, but I might be wrong."
Supernatural,3bcd0x,mb95421,6,Sat Jun 27 21:45:51 2015 UTC,Sam was brought out of Lucifers cage. The thing is that Castiel and Crowley only managed to bring out Sam's body without the soul. John was killed by Azazel and had his soul taken. Sam jumped into the cage and was still technically alive in the cage and only half of him was rescued. That's how I understand it at least.
Supernatural,3bcd0x,RenderedCreed,3,Sat Jun 27 23:25:58 2015 UTC,"We didn't actually hear the entire conversation between Azazel and John, right?  Didn't Yellow-Eyes just say ""you still have to sweeten the pot"" and the rest happened off-screen?  I've always assumed, since the first time I saw In My Time of Dying, that John's death was part of the deal.  John had to basically sacrifice everything to save Dean:  the Colt, his soul, and his life."
Supernatural,3bcd0x,EscapeSequence,2,Sun Jun 28 07:03:43 2015 UTC,"My thought was that even though most deals have ten years, Johns didn't and yellow eyes collected immediately. People who sell their souls to demons do die when the demon collects, it's just usually after 10 years.  I was thrown for a loop with Kevin's mom where they imply she'd live without her soul but that also wasn't a deal with a demon.  But we are all probably over thinking it. I think it comes down to whatever works best in terms of plot lol.  Edit: also remember when Dean sold his soul and had a year, he wasn't immediately soulless like Sam was and was going to die when t happened. With John it just happened immediately. Sam just wasn't resurrected completely. Cas couldn't get all of him out."
Supernatural,3bcd0x,Gogogadgetskates,2,Sun Jun 28 23:56:22 2015 UTC,Probably because John died in S2 whereas Soul less Sam is post Kripke

The Winchesters found out it was a witch (or demon?) that was removing souls from people's bodies. I think this was when Abbadon was still around. If I remember right, which I'm probably not since I really should have gone to sleep hours ago, this episode was a flashback episode to where Grandpa Winchester goes with pre-possessed Abbadon on a mission where they run into the demon that possesses her...I think.  Edit: Season 9 ep 17 Mother's Little Helper. It was a demon working with Abbadon that stole souls from people. It's where we see Abbadon possess Josie, the host we know Abbadon to be."

Supernatural,3b6lui,mavgeek,2,Fri Jun 26 12:23:23 2015 UTC,"Demons have a, oddly asymmetrical balance when it comes to fighting Angels. Your basic Angel can smite Demons but that requires a physical touch. They're ""true visage"" is also too much for most humans to handle seeing or hearing (aside from special cases Castiel mentions in his debut but we never really see a human do so).  Whilst Demons are..on a curve. It really depends upon a couple things, what level Demon and if they have an Angel Sword. Lower level Demons don't get access to telekinesis or teleportation but they can still smoke in and out of meatsuits. Upper level Demons can globe hop just like an Angel can. They're about on the same physical strength level, usually. It really boils down to a Demon having the full bag of tricks plus an Angel Sword's can kill Demons & Angels, but until the civil war(s) in Heaven started, Demons or at least Crowley, didn't have regular access to stolen / lost Angel Swords. There are other things you could count, such as Devil's Traps or Enochian Sigils to be used against one another, and as we've seen in this latest season witchcraft can in fact affect a Seraph level Angel. The ball is in the air in terms of a fight, i.e. full powered Cas vs Crowley is probably a tie."

Supernatural,3b688f,Dubby87,13,Fri Jun 26 08:32:53 2015 UTC,"That'd be an interesting ending for sure. One thing I'd argue with you though is that I think Sam is the one who can't settle down, even though he wants to. That's one of the sad parts about them is that Sam almost had a normal life and that's all anyone has ever wanted for him, but he just can't get it. Dean on the other hand has had much more success in settling down and getting out of the business. He's had more stable love interests and makes better connections with people. He only gets back in when Sam is involved."
Supernatural,3b688f,Bellamariette,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:59:42 2015 UTC,Yeah it could go either way. Could be sams son and Dean raises him. It would make more sense that he is a total bad ass.
Supernatural,3b688f,GoneParcel,5,Fri Jun 26 16:05:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think I would like this. People always talk about bringing Lucifer back, and honestly, I'm disappointed that the writers didn't do more with his character. It was sort of anticlimactic. But still, if they bring him back now, it'll just be sort of forced.  What I think is that it will finally be revealed that God is alive. Maybe something happened to him that would keep him from coming back this entire time and that makes him evil, or maybe He's just a dick on the show. Hell, the angels are mostly dicks, so it wouldn't be unheard of. I think the ending will have something to do with that. Also, I doubt Dean would just be able to run Lucifer over with the Impala. That's just too easy.  Also, I don't like the idea that Dean's kid would be raised like a hunter. I mean, It's one of the saddest things in the series, how Mary never wanted her kids in the business, but they got roped into it anyway. I feel like the writers aren't gonna have too sad of an ending. Like, they can have sad cliffhangers and everything, but I feel like they're gonna have a somewhat happy ending to things.  Also, if I remember correctly, the ""original supernatural"" was seasons 1-5, and in that, it ends with Dean having a happy ending, which sort of disproves what you said about Dean never being happy.   So yeah, just a few issues."
Supernatural,3b688f,GoneParcel,2,Fri Jun 26 15:50:06 2015 UTC,Yeah I didnt think it threw a whole lot other then it would be awesome  they had a son come back. I also see one of them dying at the end.. I just dont think the show would be as impactful without a death at the end.. and I just feel like its got to be dean sense he is so willing to protect sam no matter what the stakes when sam kind of thinks for himself a little more.
Supernatural,3b688f,BrhostAdventurer,2,Fri Jun 26 16:02:26 2015 UTC,"Eh, I almost think it'll be Sam who dies. Like you said, Dean always protects Sam, so I think they'll give Sam a shot to save Dean."

Like it the engine was made with the steal of a gods blade or something lol... Now im just getting silly.. But I mean I just think it would be cool if whoever dies went out in that car like over a cliff into hell or something."
Supernatural,3b688f,johnnynohat,4,Fri Jun 26 16:38:07 2015 UTC,"This sounds awesome (seriously) but the end has to have something to do with Dean and Sam and just them.

Maybe defeating SPOILERSPOILERSPOILER the darkness will end all bad things leading them to live normal lives."

I have it on my Netflix list begging me to catch back up but ehh from what I've heard it's story hasn't gotten any better.

There was no indication that he was faking that he was going to kill Sam. There was no indication that the pictures Sam showed him or the things he said caused Dean to overcome the Mark. Lastly, Sam pretty much killed Charlie which angered Dean to the point that he literally told Sam that he'd rather Sam was the one who was dead and nearly killed Cas. After all that, not killing Sam (for what seems like absolutely no reason) doesn't make any sense."
Supernatural,3b3yvm,thecody17,2,Thu Jun 25 20:57:13 2015 UTC,"Dean was able to momentarily overpower the mark after Sam showed him the family pictures with their mom. He realized that he loved Sam too much, and if he didn't kill Sam then Death would. So he killed Death.  For what it's worth, I think Death will be back. I don't think Horsemen can be killed permanently."
Supernatural,3b3yvm,PeterMunchlett,2,Thu Jun 25 21:21:17 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't lump all Horsemen in the same category. Death seems to be God's equal and opposite, but the other 3 seem to be just high-ranking demons. Given this, it would make sense that if Death really can kill God as he claims then he can also be killed with his own scythe. I'm fairly certain it would also kill War, Famine, and Pestilence."

War, Pestilence, and Famine didn't come into being until earth had life. Just a theory of course.   As long as things can die, I think Death will be able to come back. He's going to be upset."

Supernatural,3b3yvm,PeterMunchlett,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:01:45 2015 UTC,"I don't why so many people seem to think that chuck is god, he was merely a prophet. God wouldn't need an arch angel as a body guard and he certainly wouldn't need to place himself in a sideline job just to watch everything and hand out one or two helpful hints.  The reason he didn't ""die"" was more than likely because he ascended when his task/term was complete. It's very common in many religions especially christianity."
Supernatural,3b3yvm,Drunky_VonDrunkerson,3,Thu Jun 25 23:40:43 2015 UTC,"If he has ""ascended"", then why did he come back in the musical episode? He didn't seem ""ascended"" or anything like that.  There can only be one existing & alive prophet at any given moment according to Castiel. So Cas assumed that Chuck is dead when Kevin Tran became a prophet. No one had any idea what happened to Chuck. Even if Heaven was in the middle of a civil war, I'm pretty sure the angels wouldn't lose track of their prophet, especially Raphael's faction since they were pretty intent on restarting the Apocalypse, and having a prophet to record the events is a pretty big rule of theirs. The list of prophets and potential prophets are burned in every single angel's brain/mind.  Potential prophets would pass for any other human and would not have any prophet abilities unless activated by like say a tablet.  Another important tidbit is that Joshua said that God doesn't want to be found unless he wants to be, amulet or no amulet. We've seen archangels like Gabriel warp reality at will as seen in ""Changing Channels"", and he wasn't the strongest like Michael and Lucifer. What if God put the name, Chuck, on the angel's list of prophets?   Something similar to Gabriel's little witness protection on Earth.   Gabriel became Loki, and God became ""Chuck"".  An archangel was able to fool the Pagan Gods for thousands of years.  It's not that far-fetched that God can top that easily by posing as a prophet and fooling all the Heaven, Earth and Hell.  If you ask why he doesn't intervene more, well I can give two reasons. He believes in free will, and he wishes to abstain from interfering in the natural order.  His sideline job as a writer and posing as a prophet... it suits his position because he doesn't want to interfere. True, he wouldn't need an archangel to protect him of course but it's part of playing along."
Supernatural,3b3yvm,D-Lowell,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:06:27 2015 UTC,"And as they say, being a writer is the closest thing to becoming god."
Supernatural,3b3yvm,Drunky_VonDrunkerson,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:52:36 2015 UTC,"So him coming back to earth means he didn't ascend? Everything and everyone else has come back from heaven and hell, it doesn't seem that unthinkable that he could slip out of heaven since in the Christian faith prophets had some special abilities, it would be especially during all the chaos. And it wasn't like he came on screen and did anything god like, he was on for 5 seconds and said two words that meant nothing. He could have just been resurrected or something.   And as you mentioned, if god doesn't want to be found then he can't be. He doesn't need any ""witness protection"". He can simple be invisible to all creatures and watch everything from any view point."
Supernatural,3b3yvm,D-Lowell,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:23:41 2015 UTC,"According to Joshua, he's on Earth.  True, God could choose to be invisible and simply watch everything but that's not the point. He probably doesn't need to be invisible to avoid detection from Heaven or Hell.  If Chuck ascended, the angels would most likely know. But ascension was never mentioned in the SPN universe. Supernatural doesn't follow theology and lores completely. So if ascension wasn't mentioned or implied, I don't think that's likely.  Furthermore, no one had any idea what happened to Chuck and assumed that he was dead. When Kevin Tran was activated as a prophet, it didn't take long for the angels to find him. So why couldn't the angels find Chuck if he was still alive after the apocalypse? Also, he still kept writing some unpublished books following the apocalypse. Charlie downloaded those unpublished books from Amazon. One of those unpublished books included Dragons, which weren't introduced until season 6.   If you were to argue that he was ""deactivated"" as a prophet after the apocalypse was done, as you argued that he fulfill his role as a prophet, how would you explain those unpublished books that covered the events after the apocalypse?  Prophets were not shown to have any special abilities other than reading the tablets ""Word of God"" or the gift of prophecy. Other than those two abilities, they are for all intents and purposes, human.   Using outside information in theology and mythology isn't reliable for the Supernatural Universe because Supernatural can not only use but also tailor theology and lores to suit the story. For example, Cupid wasn't in Christianity but SPN made them a lower-order angel class. Another recent one would be the story of Cain and Abel. SPN made it so that Abel was talking to Lucifer rather than God. Cas even says that the Bible gets some things wrong.   Given that, the Chuck's ascension theory doesn't fit. There's too many inconsistencies and holes."
Supernatural,3b3yvm,Drunky_VonDrunkerson,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:44:28 2015 UTC,"As for the darkness, this one is probably going to far. If the most powerful being in the universe and his army of ultra powerful arch angels barely fought them back then what hope do Sam and Dean have? This kind of seems like would be a plot from the Sandman Slim novels if anyone has ever read them(If not, I suggest it, they're pretty good).  Side question, wouldn't Cas have been there in the beginning or did god make the angels in stages?"
Supernatural,3b3yvm,D-Lowell,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:47:03 2015 UTC,The angels weren't created until sometimes after the Darkness was sealed.
Supernatural,3b3yvm,Drunky_VonDrunkerson,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:08:53 2015 UTC,Death said the arch angels were there when they fought the war with the darkness so I would assume that the other angels would have heard the stories over the next half a billion years or so even if they weren't there.
Supernatural,3b3yvm,D-Lowell,2,Wed Jul 8 03:07:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think the angels know.   Why? Because they would know that trying to remove the Mark would set the Darkness free.  That kind of information is a pretty important information. Doing something that could undo everything their father had created which would be a pretty big breach of angel code. I don't think even Lucifer would want to do that.  Simply the knowledge of the existence of the Darkness is rather dangerous as well since if a demon got wind of that information, then they might want to unleash the darkness and create chaos on Earth. That's not the kind of information you'd want floating around.  So it's likely that only the archangels, God and Death know about the Darkness.   Another example of this lack of information is the leviathans. The angels didn't really know about the Leviathans until Cas pulled them out of purgatory on his little power trip.  Death said that before He created Man and angels, he created the first beasts, the Leviathans.   You want another example of the archangels' lack of disclosure to the angels?  The apocalypse. Only upper management like Zachariah knew about Michael's and Raphael's plan to allow the Apocalypse to happen so that they could create paradise on Earth. The lower ranks didn't know because according to Zachariah, Heaven would have rebellion on their hands."

Supernatural,3azf57,Gogogadgetskates,4,Fri Jun 26 22:43:42 2015 UTC,Season 1 episode 3 always rattles me. It's that fucking kids face coming out of the water at the end. I don't know if I'll swim in a lake ever again.
Supernatural,3azf57,takesometimetoday,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:20:39 2015 UTC,"On a scary scale of 1-10, I'd give that episode a 4.5. So, it's not scary, but it's scarier than the other episodes, which I'd rank between a 1 and 3. If that makes sense."
Supernatural,3azf57,margeink,0,Thu Jun 25 03:38:24 2015 UTC,But at firs they thought it was some kind of monster

Supernatural,3azf57,zx7,3,Thu Jun 25 03:21:22 2015 UTC,"(I'm watching it right now, lol.) In the beginning they're in the bar playing darts and Sam says there were signs of a struggle, so Dean says that the local pd may be right and it's just a kidnapping/""maybe this isn't our kind of gig"". But then Sam says ""Dad marked the area, Dean- 'possible hunting grounds for phantom attacker'"" and that he (John) read local folklore about a dark figure that comes out at night and grabs people, then vanishes. So yeah, that's why they stick around, because ""okay that's weird"", as Dean puts it. (edit: and because Sam gets kidnapped, obviously, lol)"
Supernatural,3azf57,margeink,9,Thu Jun 25 03:33:47 2015 UTC,"I want to buy the house, just so that every time a letter comes I can set it on fire beside the mailbox."

Ok, ok maybe Sam and Dean would dismiss it as just a human ""douchebag"" but let's pretend for a minute we HAD to align this case to some monster in the SPN universe. Because the watcher says his family has been watching for decades ... It most likely sounds like a ghost, right? ""Young blood"" is interesting though. Any monsters you guys can think of that specifically fed on children? Lilith ate babies right? Any other theories?"
Supernatural,3azf57,TuesdayPigInAPoke,3,Fri Jun 26 01:13:04 2015 UTC,"I read all about this on Monday and I'm not even convinced there is a ""watcher"" the new owners of the house are trying to get their money back AND retain ownership of the house.  I believe they're sending the letters to themselves to further their own interests.  But if not - would be totally interesting!!!"
Supernatural,3b0w0x,molonlabe88,16,Thu Jun 25 01:58:10 2015 UTC,"Demons being topside was rare in the early seasons, as only the stronger ones could escape Hell. The ones that are easily killed now are the lackeys that have now been allowed out of Hell."
Supernatural,3b0w0x,FoxInDaBox,11,Thu Jun 25 04:21:48 2015 UTC,"maybe its because the boys were pretty much rookies back then and they grew stronger after 10 years + countless years on hell etc, purgatory?  i mean the first demon they fought were pretty much the first ones....   maybe because all high tier demons are dead and only remain lower level demons?  or maybe the fact supernatural overpower - underpower everything as they need?  who knows  like i said yesterday i think, Crowley is not that strong as you think, hes just the only higher-ISH tier demon alive"
Supernatural,3b0w0x,Xetiw,7,Thu Jun 25 03:30:13 2015 UTC,In the early seasons it was only the really powerful demons that were able to ascend to earth. Once the winchesters opened the doors even the lower demons had the ability to come to earth.  There are more weaker demons than stronger so it heavily skews the way it looks.
Supernatural,3b0w0x,matiasgee,5,Thu Jun 25 04:34:20 2015 UTC,"When they took Meg off the show, demons lost all powers.  Bring back Meg!"
Supernatural,3b0w0x,thundersnow528,-2,Thu Jun 25 02:02:53 2015 UTC,That's not quite true. Meg didn't have any kind of that telekinetic powers. She was a lower-tier demon.  Ruby was also a lower-tier demon.
Supernatural,3b0w0x,D-Lowell,2,Thu Jun 25 18:18:41 2015 UTC,"It wasn't at all true really.  I was making a joke to cover up my sorrow for Meg not being on the show anymore and hoping others will start a petition to bring her back.  But I guess if I had to explain that, it really wasn't a very funny joke.  JUSTICE FOR MEG!"
Supernatural,3b0w0x,thundersnow528,3,Thu Jun 25 21:45:22 2015 UTC,I think it's because they're not the main tough guys now so they've been weakened to make then quick kills to get to the actual main bad guys in the later seasons. Also practice with demon killing blades just make them lame fodder now.
Supernatural,3b0w0x,BrhostAdventurer,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:39:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get the blades (demon & angel) makes things easier to kill, but you still must get past that whole sling you with their mind type of thing."
Supernatural,3b0w0x,BrhostAdventurer,3,Thu Jun 25 02:51:30 2015 UTC,"Hmm maybe something to do with the power of the angel carvings in their chest (I know is meant to hide them, but maybe the power behind it)? Their tattoos? Just throwing out some ideas. Maybe their reputation causes demons to hesitate?"
Supernatural,3b0w0x,D-Lowell,3,Thu Jun 25 02:57:00 2015 UTC,"Only higher-tier demons have the ability to use telekinesis. Azazel, Lilith, Crowley, Alistair, Abaddon.  Lower tier demons have enhanced strength and the ability to shrug off pain. Meg is one such example. Prior to the opening of Hell's Gate and the Apocalypse, topside demons were rather rare. It's difficult for even high level demons to get out of hell.  There is a similar parallel in a demon's strength and Sam's demon powers. In season 4, Sam could only exorcise demons at first. After taking in more demon blood, he was able to use the same telekinesis on Alistair. After drinking even more demon blood, he was eventually able to kill Alistair with his mind."

Supernatural,3b0w0x,LokiShinigami,7,Sun Jun 28 19:11:50 2015 UTC,"Well im not sure how far you got before rewatching, so slight spoilers ahead.  Crowley.  Blame Crowley.   He told his subjects that they were not to lay a hand on the winchesters anymore since him and Dean are buddy-buddy now."
Supernatural,3b0w0x,LokiShinigami,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:02:09 2015 UTC,"Lol, well i'm re-watching, so no worries about spoilers.   Crowley just does that when Dick comes around though, even before then the demons got weaker. Then once Dick is gone, why would Crowley care?"
Supernatural,3b0w0x,CrazyPlato,6,Thu Jun 25 02:50:43 2015 UTC,"Nah, crowley had been helping the boys since before them, just now it's more obvious why.  Hell had a very specific order stucture, mostly ruled through fear. Demons had to be violent and strong, just to maintain rank. Over time Dean and Sam has killed off 90% of the ruling ranks. That's a different type of fear.  Then we have the whole crowley deal with him becoming friendlier with the winchesters.  Currently demons can't touch dean due to the mark, it nulls their powers mostly."
Supernatural,3b0w0x,BringTheNewAge,3,Thu Jun 25 03:24:48 2015 UTC,"Common theory is that the weaker demons in Hell never got topside when Azazel was in charge. Only the strongest ones were able to fight their way out, and they were the ones that hunters had to deal with. But once the apocalypse began, the demons in charge (at this point Lillith) had other things on their mind, and breaking the 66 seals was given a higher priority than enforcing any rules about who is and isn't able to get out of Hell.  Which leads us to Crowley, who's already been blamed for the phenomenon. When he took over as king, he went with a much looser policy about the gates. We see a lot of weaker demons not being allowed out of Hell to cause chaos and whatnot. But, being weaker, we see people like Sam and Dean take them down without much effort, because they grew up hunting the nasty demons, the ones who were tough enough to make under Azazel's rule."

The Mark is powerful magic, maybe Cas could have taken Dean if he really tried though"
Supernatural,3ayw4r,ailyara,2,Wed Jun 24 18:18:23 2015 UTC,"Didn't you see how his angel wings are tattered? Even with his grace back, he's not whole.   Also, I think they were drawing a parallel to when Castiel punched Dean's face in for the Angel Tablet back in Season 8."
Supernatural,3ayw4r,xeqtioner0,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:04:00 2015 UTC,Well the fact that he wasn't at his fullest power and Dean was all juiced up from the mark...I would imagine then he would be able to feel some pain.
Supernatural,3ayw4r,al3xtremo,2,Wed Jun 24 17:02:12 2015 UTC,"I had a problem with that to until I rewatched season 9. I think it was in the final episode when he punched Metatron and made him bleed. The mark gives him that much power. I hope I'm remembering that right though, it's been a while"
Supernatural,3ayw4r,laurellestars,2,Wed Jun 24 18:05:24 2015 UTC,"Ah, I remember the days when punching an angel was like punching marble and all demons feared them. The angels are more susceptible because they are fallen and disconnected from heaven.   But if angels lose a significant amount of their power after falling, then how the hell did Lucifer ever expect to beat Michael? It would've been a no contest fight."

Supernatural,3ayw4r,Point_Of_No-Return,2,Thu Jun 25 03:43:14 2015 UTC,"Lol. The writers have given up on being consistent withe the lore. That's one of the reason why I think I'm done with this show now.  And to people who's saying that Castiel was holding back. Keep in mind that in seasons 4 -5 punching an angel is like punching a brick wall, your fist would nearly break by punching them. Just because Castiel did not intend to hurt Dean doesn't mean that he should have felt deans punches. Punching a brick wall is still going to hurt regardless. Furthermore, one of the reasons why that scene is one of the stupidest crap in terms of lore is how that one Frankenstein dude could lift Dean like a feather in previous episodes, therefore if Dean had the strength to beat up Castiel like that, he should have had the strength to punch clean through human durability characters."

Supernatural,3auin6,BadW0lfGaming297,17,Tue Jun 23 16:49:27 2015 UTC,"Benny was a personal favorite of mine. He was loyal to Dean to the point where he was willing to sacrifice himself to save Sam (someone who did not even trust Benny), but that's how strong his bond was with Dean. He never betrayed them and truly tried to stop being a ""monster."" In the end Dean's relationship with Benny was a big turning point in making Dean understand that everything isn't black and white, and just like some people are bad, some monsters can be good."
Supernatural,3auin6,SwarleyJr,9,Tue Jun 23 18:50:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna lie it hit me right in the feels when Dean calls him in that episode. It really shows Benny's humanity, he is so genuinely happy to hear from Dean despite the fact that Dean hadn't been there for him. Also the fact that without Dean Benny is completely alone after the love of his life turned on him and Dean had to kill her, he realizes that there is nothing for him in this life and he's better off in Purgatory."
Supernatural,3auin6,angelkirie,4,Tue Jun 23 19:13:21 2015 UTC,I miss Benny all the time. And now I have a ridiculous crush on Ty Olsson because of that character. At least he's been in small roles in about a million things so there's always something to watch to get your Benny fix. :)

Supernatural,3auin6,funwiththoughts,3,Tue Jun 23 22:40:13 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping this next season will be the last, and if it is then seeing an all star cast from the tenure of the show teaming up to take on the last big bad of the show would be fantastic"
Supernatural,3auin6,ailyara,3,Tue Jun 23 22:45:08 2015 UTC,"With how they hinted at Crowley becoming a big bad again, the darkness arriving, Metatron AWOL, and possibly throwing Chuck/John back into the mix, I can't see only one season remaining. That doesn't mean I want it to drag on a few more years, I'm actually hoping they wrap it up as properly as Swan Song again, but there are just too many loose ends for them to write a new arch AND properly tie them all up."
Supernatural,3auin6,ICloudburnI,2,Tue Jun 23 23:01:12 2015 UTC,Yeah I could see that. Reading that does make me think that a season of resolving smaller issues and finding a way to stop the last big threat followed by a season of resolving the rest of the loose ends and beating the last big threat sounds like a good way to go. Also I hope that on the series finale they beat the last protagonist around 3/4 of the way into the episode so that they can write an appropriate epilogue to show how things turned out
Supernatural,3ax0uo,taimoor2,7,Wed Jun 24 04:37:59 2015 UTC,"his wings were damaged aswell, you can see it when he got his grace back.  wings = fly = teleport = moving around quickly  makes sense though, Castiel's grace was used to perform the spell, so his grace was most likely the ""first"" one damaged, maybe he will be able to fly again, as a Seraph he can heal things other angel's cant, but we will have to wait, for all we know the spell is irreversible - I'm quoting Crowley, might be wrong -.  pretty sure we will have archangels/god this season and we will be able to see them fixing the spell, makes sense... Sam wont give his body to Lucifer, thats why John might be coming back?.  funny note: as Castiel grace was used to perform the spell, maybe if he fix his own wings other angels will be able to fly again? the spell seems just about bringing every angel to heaven and then burn their wings casting them down, the only way he could do that easily is linking Castiel's grace ( since he was the one doing the trials ) to every other angel, seems fair to me."
Supernatural,3ax0uo,Xetiw,2,Wed Jun 24 09:15:52 2015 UTC,"You mention that Sam won't give his body to Lucifer. Didn't he already do that ? If a vessel says ""Yes"" to an angel, isn't the angel able to leave and reenter the vessel at will ? If Lucifer comes back he could just repossess Sam, right ?  Edit- Just remembered that Cas had to get Jimmy Novak to reallow him to possess him after possessing Claire. So I may be wrong about Angels having complete access after the first ""Yes"""
Supernatural,3ax0uo,thecody17,3,Thu Jun 25 21:08:53 2015 UTC,"im guessing he have to say ""yes"" again, since the vessel can reject the angel at any time- and since Lucifer is not welcomed now.  the fucked thing is when an archangel is already inside the body, i think they are too strong to overide the whole ""the vessel can reject the angel at anytime""."
Supernatural,3ax0uo,Xetiw,2,Thu Jun 25 22:26:38 2015 UTC,"When Gadreel was expelled from Sam and he went back to his old unnamed bartender vessel he had to say yes again. Metatron was at the bar complaining about his ""friend"" being late when they started hearing Gadreels real voice and the bartender looked out of the window and said yes before Gadreel went back into him."
Supernatural,3ax0uo,ICloudburnI,4,Tue Jun 30 07:02:09 2015 UTC,Because when the angels fell they all lost their wings.
Supernatural,3ax0uo,punkpixzsticks,2,Wed Jun 24 04:43:36 2015 UTC,I thought he didn't fell?
Supernatural,3ax0uo,vanishplusxzone,3,Wed Jun 24 05:22:12 2015 UTC,"The only angel that didn't fall was Metatron. He cut them off from heaven, so they all fell, even though Cas didn't have any or his own grace at the time.   While they can now access heaven from the portal, they still are ""cut off"" so to speak. They haven't completely fixed the damage Metatron did."
Supernatural,3ax0uo,punkpixzsticks,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:35:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think Megatron was the only angel unaffected by the fall. There was that whacked Grigori, who had the ability still to teleport from place to place. So, I don't think he fell either."
Supernatural,3ax0uo,ffgamefan,2,Wed Jun 24 14:33:15 2015 UTC,Good point but I think it was implied that they were always on earth. He got his power from human dreams.
Supernatural,3ax0uo,punkpixzsticks,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:27:04 2015 UTC,"But reapers were always stationed on Earth too and the fall also affected them and made it so their teleportation powers were impossible. So, I don't think that was the reason that Tamiel wasn't affected by it, I think it had more to do with the fact that before discovering him all the angels assumed that species of angel was wiped out. I think the spell only affected those angels/angel species that Metatron was aware of.   Though I suppose it is possible that the reason he still had that particular skill could have been because of the human souls."
Supernatural,3ax0uo,Pwmaag,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:59:24 2015 UTC,No but part Of His Grace is that of Other angels
Supernatural,3ax0uo,alterego890,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:25:58 2015 UTC,can he really mix and match though? I thought its one grace at a time as the grace of other angels fades away?
Supernatural,3ax0uo,BassNector,3,Wed Jun 24 05:37:28 2015 UTC,spoilers?     I may be wrong. I see grace as an angel's soul. If they have it removed they revert to human and have a human soul. As a human more then one soul can occupy your body. Ie: Dean/Benny in purgitory. The second soul wouldn't be the power source of the body though. It is just sort of hitching a ride. So either castiel expelled the other angel's grace before his grace took over. Or it is being unused. Either way his grace should be in control. I have no idea why he drives. Maybe he enjoys small human tasks.
Supernatural,3ax0uo,punkpixzsticks,3,Wed Jun 24 08:31:30 2015 UTC,He really did enjoy that PB&J sandwich so I'm going to assume he likes small human tasks.

Supernatural,3aud5t,taimoor2,13,Tue Jun 23 16:09:52 2015 UTC,"He probably gets it off the souls he has control over. Dean is stronger than him because he has the Mark of Cain, a mark thats fueled by Lucifer and The Darkness.    Abadon was a knight of hell handpicked by Lucifer."
Supernatural,3aud5t,Thepharcydee,4,Tue Jun 23 16:52:46 2015 UTC,Abadon was a knight of hell though. I figure Crowley did some super smarming and usurped his predecessor.
Supernatural,3aud5t,takhana,2,Tue Jun 23 16:53:31 2015 UTC,"probably because he was the king of the crossroads before, and as every other higher tier demon is gone, he could easily grab some power from the souls.  its like why the president becomes so powerful? because he get access to things.  Crowley as the higher tier demon alive can do alot of shits other demons cant, being the strongest.  why Crowley wasnt a big deal when Lilith, Azazel, Alaistar and the likes were around? because as king of crossroads he got some extra ""mojo"" but not as much as them, now with them gone he can channel power from darker things.  the likes of Dean and Abaddon, Cain, they were on a different tier, even higher than Lilith, you can say Dean was a mini-knight of hell, or a knight of hell in training, with ALOT extra mojo from the knife.   For Crowley, having Dean with the mark is a high risk, one day he might have become full dark side and take over hell and noone would be able to stop him.  Thats the reason Crowley has always sided with the boys to defeat higher tier demons, because he is not strong enough to do so, as long as someone with higher tier is alive, he wont be able to access the power from hell freely.  if you think about it, Crowley wasnt that strong when he became the king of hell, he has become stronger with time perhaps because of the souls, as I remember Castiel couldnt smite Alaistar but he was willing to smite Crowley last season remember? and Crowley knew Castiel had what it takes to smite him, even when Castiel was weak under Naomi's orders Crowley ran afraid from him, while Alaistar laugh at Castiel when he tried to smite him."

Supernatural,3aud5t,funwiththoughts,3,Tue Jun 23 18:05:42 2015 UTC,I think it comes with his rank. Azazel and Lilith also have unique eye colours.

Also, they wouldn't be locking everything supernatural away, what about the spirits of the dead? Locking all 3 afterlives means they would be stuck on Earth as immortal ghosts."
Supernatural,3asz6t,funwiththoughts,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:34:40 2015 UTC,"It's likely that there are angel trials because of the angel tablet.   The souls wouldn't be stuck on Earth. Locking the gates of hell wouldn't mean that souls can't go to hell. It just meant that demons can't get out of hell, no exceptions.  Maybe the angel trials might not be necessary because most of the angels that were dicks are already dead.  Ghosts on the scale of threat level of everything supernatural tend to rank pretty low since they are tethered to a single area and can be taken down relatively easy compared to other monsters and demons.   The Purgatory trials would wipe the monsters off the map and lock them way."
Supernatural,3asz6t,D-Lowell,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:32:42 2015 UTC,"It's likely that there are angel trials because of the angel tablet.   Not really. The fact that the Demon tablet included three trials doesn't mean every tablet does. There were no trials on the Leviathan tablet.   The souls wouldn't be stuck on Earth. Locking the gates of hell wouldn't mean that souls can't go to hell. It just meant that demons can't get out of hell, no exceptions.   Metatron locking Heaven made souls incapable of going to Heaven. I don't see why the same wouldn't apply to Hell.   Ghosts on the scale of threat level of everything supernatural tend to rank pretty low since they are tethered to a single area and can be taken down relatively easy compared to other monsters and demons.   Ghosts are only taken down easily because the afterlife is still open. If the afterlife was shut down, what would happen when the bones were burned?   The Purgatory trials would wipe the monsters off the map and lock them way.   That... doesn't make a lot of sense. Monsters don't come from Purgatory like demons come from Hell and angels come from Heaven, they're Earthly creatures that go to Purgatory when they die."

Supernatural,3anix0,thedarkpurpleone,9,Mon Jun 22 02:06:26 2015 UTC,"It's a really big leap to see some guy named Dean in national news over suspected murder/bank robbery and then a few months later read a book about a Dean who was in a similar situation but actually trying to stop a shapeshifter.  As a ""rational"" person with no exposure to any supernatural activities you wouldn't suddenly go ""OH MY GOD these are the SAME PEOPLE!! It's all real!"" If you were to make some sort of real connection you would probably assume the author took some inspiration from actual events."
Supernatural,3anix0,Anivair,3,Mon Jun 22 02:57:13 2015 UTC,"That's a much better leap.  Bear in mind that Chuck wrote those books as they came to him and publication takes time.  The crime spree happened well before the books were published. They'd have been reading about it after.  if you read a book about a sports star running from the cops in a Ford Bronco you would not assume it was a factual account of the OJ murder, you'd just think it was a shout out."

I think the end of the serie should be either good or bad.  good ending: the boys do a spell to vanish every supernatural being from earth and they become normal people, maybe get a family or something like that.  bad ending: they do the ultimate sacrifice, every human acknowledge the existense of supernatural beings and the boys sacrifice themselves to kill every supernatural being, and they remain dead as no supernatural being can walk the earth again including angels  who knows maybe the bad ending happens before the good one and God being God just bring the boys back and erase / keep their memory, and the boys vanish into the night riding the impala"

Supernatural,3ald5y,moza_jf,2,Sun Jun 21 14:25:49 2015 UTC,"2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike:       The 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, more commonly referred to as simply the Writers' Strike, was a strike by the Writers Guild of America, East (WGAE) and the Writers Guild of America, West (WGAW).  The WGAE and WGAW labor unions represent film, television, and radio writers working in the United States. All 12,000 screenwriters and TV writers in the guild were part of the strike  which started on November 5, 2007 and concluded on February 12, 2008.    The strike sought increased funding for the writers in comparison to the profits of the larger studios. It was targeted at the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AoMPTP), a trade organization representing the interests of 397 American film and television producers.  The most influential of these are eleven corporations: CBS (headed by Les Moonves), MGM (Harry E. Sloan), NBCUniversal (Jeffrey Zucker), The Weinstein Company (Harvey and Bob Weinstein), Lionsgate (Jon Feltheimer), News Corp/Fox (Peter Chernin), Paramount Pictures (Brad Grey), Anchor Bay/Liberty Media/Starz (Chris McGurk), Sony Pictures (Michael Lynton), the Walt Disney Company (Robert Iger), and Warner Bros. (Barry Meyer).   Negotiators for the striking writers reached a tentative agreement on February 8, 2008, and the boards of both guilds unanimously approved the deal on February 10, 2008.  Striking writers voted on February 12, 2008 on whether to lift the restraining order, with 92.5% voting to end the strike.  On February 26, the WGA announced that the contract had been ratified with a 93.6% approval among WGA members.  The writers guild later requested a court order seeking that the agreement be honored and implemented.  The guilds were on strike for 14 weeks and 2 days (100 days).  In contrast, the previous strike in 1988, the longest in the history of the Guild, lasted 21 weeks and 6 days (153 days), costing the American entertainment industry an estimated $500 million in opportunity costs.   According to a National Public Radio (NPR) report filed on February 12, 2008, the strike cost the economy of Los Angeles an estimated $1.5 billion. A report from the UCLA Anderson School of Management put the loss at $380 million, while economist Jack Kyser put the loss at $2.1 billion.    At the resolution of the strike, the writers achieved a qualified success: they received a new percentage payment on the distributor’s gross for digital distribution, they emerged united, but they lost out on short-term deals.

Supernatural,3akei7,whitneyyyl,2,Sun Jun 21 02:49:41 2015 UTC,"Regarding the supernatural, it's understandable that the human race as a whole are unaware of their existence for a long time. Because as the human population grew as well as the advancement of science, many monster and demon incidents were relatively few, more discrete and self-contained. Gods, monsters and demons were reduced to ideas of fiction. The supernaturals, despite their variety and abilities, are a rather small minority compared to the rest of the human population. As an unspoken rule, the many supernaturals apparently don't want to be noticed by the normal world or at least won't go out of their way to announce themselves to the rest of the world. (Castiel did announce himself to the world as the new God but his rule was rather short-lived. XD)  At the start of Season 1, everything started changing, escalating. According to Bobby, demonic possessions take place at most several times a year but now demonic possessions are like every other week.   Ever since the start of the Apocalypse, more people are beginning to notice that the world isn't what it used to be."

That said, I'd be willing to go along with the idea that The Darkness is capable of basic organized thought & decides that before it overtakes the world/universe, it wants to find & kill the entity that beat it before - God - so it'll be able to go ahead & devour everything unobstructed. The race to find God first = the first half of the season.  I'd buy it. And I'd be willing to acknowledge general public ignorance with this."

Supernatural,3akr0c,Xetiw,3,Sun Jun 21 05:16:36 2015 UTC,"So it's pretty much like this, season 1 is early X-Files, mostly just 1 week episodes with not a lot of over arching story line, season 2 get's quite a bit better, then season 3-5 are fucking great, season 6 and 7 are pretty bad, then it starts to stabilize from there. I'd say watch to the end of season 5 atleast, then decide if you want to keep going, but keep in mind that the season do get better after the post-season 5 dip."
Supernatural,3akr0c,FreeLook93,3,Sun Jun 21 17:08:32 2015 UTC,"The point of the main plot right now is for the brothers to learn to work together again after years apart, save people's lives, and find their father who is off trying to get revenge on the thing that killed their mother. Episode 9 would have really underlined this story for you, and the story takes another big step forward in episode 11.  There aren't a ton of episodes that focus entirely on the main over-arcing plot until you get to Season 3, but you get it in pieces in the first two seasons. The first two seasons are really about character and world building."
Supernatural,3akr0c,Petrichor02,5,Mon Jun 22 00:46:32 2015 UTC,"It gets good near the end of the second season, then it is really, really fun for a few years, then it stumbles along like a dead man walking with just brief moments of good stuff.  Stopped watching beginning of this season and haven't really missed it.  Saw the last few moments of the season finale, where once again they do something dramatic and cool looking, which, if they follow their track record, will drop the ball on in the Fall and follow their record of silly filler episodes of talking dogs and prat falls and breaking the fourth wall.  Wow, that sounded way angrier than I meant it.  Sorry.  But def start watching end of second season."

It wasn´t until I got hooked on the show I became more interested in the characters and their story, the music, the stylistics and so fort. I agreed with you now, but I am not sure, I would have kept watching, if I had begun at the beginning."

Supernatural,3akr0c,laurellestars,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:03:39 2015 UTC,Seasons 1-2 have a lot of the Monster of the Week episodes but later on it gets to a more steady pace of season long storyarcs that take 1 or 2 brakes in the middle to let in space for MotW.
Supernatural,3akr0c,ICloudburnI,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:27:44 2015 UTC,"I would begin with s4 and watch the 3 first seasons last. There are some episodes in s3 that are great if you like the funny episodes like ""mystery spot"" and ""bad day at black rock"". Also ""dream a little dream"" interesting in the light of what happens in s10. I think every seasons have both great and crappy episodes. the good are so good, you forgive the less interesting. But the great variaty it the reason it speaks to a lot of different people, I think. I would keep watching."
Supernatural,3akr0c,dudeIameating,4,Sun Jun 21 17:14:59 2015 UTC,"That's the absolute worst idea. This show builds on itself right from the pilot, and skipping the first three seasons is skipping the entire build up of who people are and what's going on."

He is hard hitting and at times delivers the heavy load he is supposed to.  His over taking of human beings by making the fat and docile is both a reference to the past (sacrifices/cannibalism etc.) and future of America itself. You can see people in BK, McD's etc chowing away food without a care.  It's unfair to compare S7 to S5, because they're both on different contexts.  However I will tell you this...I wish they had lengthened Dick's presence past 7. It was too short. I really wish he had lasted longer."

I'm not sure why I thought it was so bad originally, maybe because it was so different to all the biblical stuff, but in hindsight I quite like it. I thought Dick Roman was great, he seemed powerful and threatening but in a different way to previous bad guys."
Supernatural,3ahjzu,ICloudburnI,2,Sat Jun 20 19:58:44 2015 UTC,"This was my thought too. Some one mentioned the""Dick"" jokes. I think this season had more levity and less gravitas.

Supernatural,3ahjzu,funwiththoughts,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:25:55 2015 UTC,"I really liked Dick Roman. There I said it haha. There were of course some silly dick jokes the show did with his name that detracted from seriously contending with other villains. But I look at it this way; Dick Roman in the ring against Michael. . . Dick Roman wins*. They are the original dominant life form, and God had to lock them away in an entire separate realm that pacifies them. They had a lock on turning the entire continent into a cattle-ranch of sorts. The leviathans came to be a force to be reckoned with.  He's also a villain who got more screen time than any other to date, and I was pretty happy with that, because I often feel as though previous baddies should have been shown more.  *I think I should justify this a bit, some people probably disagree. Generally speaking, older is stronger in this show. Eve was able to disable a rather strong Castiel. Edward killed two angels with ease. I expect that the strongest leviathan could take the strongest angel."
Supernatural,3ahjzu,_phineas_,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:46:32 2015 UTC,"I disagree about Dick beating Michael. Leviathans make a big deal about being unkillable, but they don't seem to actually have that much power. Leviathans can eat anything, shape shift, survive almost anything, and kill angels. Archangels have all these powers (aside maybe eating anything), plus creating objects from scratch, time travel, teleportation, and many, many other things. The only time we ever see Archangels get killed is by other, stronger angels. Leviathans can be killed with a mere bone (and that is not the only way-even in the show, Leviathans are killed by other Leviathans eating them or by Dick forcing them to eat themselves)."
Supernatural,3ahjzu,funwiththoughts,1 point,Sun Jun 21 10:51:11 2015 UTC,"I think it makes for a rock/paper/scissors dynamic, that I think can underly a general notion of strength in the show. Leviathans seem to dampen angel power, but don't seem to have any real advantage over demons. Angels trump demons with ease.  Of course you raise some very good points, archangels have insane capabilities that leviathans are nowhere near. Can't underscore the intelligence of the archangels either, they may honestly snoop in the tablets and create the weapon necessary to kill them."
Supernatural,3ahjzu,dudeIameating,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:19:15 2015 UTC,"Death says God was afraid of Leviathans eating ""the entire petri dish"" (i. e., the entire universe), so I always assumed Leviathans could eat anything-angels, demons, humans, and other Leviathans alike. I suppose if you follow that logic Dick could kill Michael, but even so, Leviathans can eat anything (I think). Archangels don't need to bother with that, they just snap their fingers and kill who/whatever they want."
Supernatural,3ah3s7,Gogogadgetskates,6,Sat Jun 20 03:09:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've just grown to hate Sam.

I mean, I get if you try and try for a few months and can't find it, I understand that he was completely alone and wanted to run, I understand that. But he's your fucking brother, and you don't just leave your sibling. Especially if you don't know where he is. Hell, for all Sam knew, he could have been serving time in hell, having to torture people for decades."

Supernatural,3ah3s7,_phineas_,3,Sat Jun 20 03:47:37 2015 UTC,"I can see both perspectives, which I guess what makes this work, be Dean sees it one way, and Sam sees it the other. But in season 9, we see Sam ready to die, and he comes across death saying 'if you're going to kill me, make sure you get the job done.' So even in the begging of season eight, I think that Sam was just in such a place where he actually wanted it to be final, and he convinced himself it actually was with everyone else he cared about being gone, and also having Amelia to cling too. Idk, thoughts?"

Supernatural,3ah3s7,funwiththoughts,2,Sat Jun 20 07:31:28 2015 UTC,"I think it's odd that some fans really seem to disapprove of Sam being independent after Dean disappears at the end of season 7. I was totally okay with it, and to the opposite, pretty upset at how much Dean brought that up against Sam. Like upwards of halfway through the season.  Firstly, retrieving someone from purgatory (of which given what we saw we could't really know what happened to Dean, he just disappears in the explosion) is an unknown feat. Outside of sacrificing a virgin, or getting an eclipse, neither of which is practical. Expecting him to research the hell out of purgatory to find some other third way doesn't seem reasonable to me.  Secondly, Sam's been through a lot. Like, he's actually like over 100 years old in conscious experience (most of it being tortured). I know it's sort of not canon because he never acts that way or really shows it, but I'd still give him a break based on that. Everything was tied up again really, the leviathan's dead. Crowley was being sort of villainous, but honestly Crowley is not a villain, he just serves his interests, he wouldn't be a threat to the world or natural order really. Plus he's apart of the crew that stopped the apocalypse, I think that gives him some immunity for future actions haha.  Anyways it was basically Sam's ""season 5 Dean"" moment, where the series could have presumably ended. Dean ended up with Lisa, and even though he'd be stressed, it would probably be for the best (of course we learn that this isn't the case for Dean, or Sam for that matter). But anyways I think it's totally okay.  And guess what, at the end of the day Dean comes back because the rules of the universe dictate that Dean be un-killable. Like, that was literally the case for all of season 10. So all's well that ends well right? . . unfortunately not for Dean or this post."
Supernatural,3ah3s7,NorthernSparrow,3,Sat Jun 20 19:32:11 2015 UTC,"Dean says he couldn't just leave Sam in hell. When he's with Lisa, he's said he was still researching and trying to find a way. That's one of the reasons - at least how I saw it - that he was so angry that Sam hadn't told him he was back.  I'll give Sam's character credit for having gone through a lot. But given how stupidly codependent those brothers are, I found it really hard to swallow that he'd just walk away from looking for his brother."
Supernatural,3ah3s7,NorthernSparrow,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:44:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop regarding Sam's flashbacks in the beginning of season 8. It was the least emotionally honest depiction of Sam I've seen in the entire series in my opinion. I thought he'd been taken in by a djinn or Amelia turned out to be a monster or... something.  No spoilers but the finale of season 10 totally forgets Sam made this decision to just stop in the beginning of season 8. I assume all the writers this past year were like ""the beginning of season 8 with Amelia was a mistake; ignore it ever happened & let's push on.""   ...because if there's one thing Carver just loves doing, it's contradicting mythology & character development."

Supernatural,3ahg84,Rmtrujillo,4,Sat Jun 20 05:26:35 2015 UTC,"The trouble with great story arcs, is that there is no guarantee a writer can come up with a new unique great story arc and continue to do so (look at M Knight Shyamalan).  I do think that 1-5 is superior to  6-10.  And I think your point on the 6-10 being unknown, season to season is a good one. I always worry that good shows start to fade as ideas get used up.  But I do think SPN has done a pretty good job at keeping up with good TV.  1-5 may be better than 6-10, 6-10 is still way way better than a lot of other stuff out there."
Supernatural,3ahg84,Redditwido,3,Sat Jun 20 05:49:00 2015 UTC,"Season 1-5 had the superior story arc because it was largely planned beforehand. Events in season 1&2 had a lasting significant impact on season 3-5. Events, decisions and consequences compounded on each other, leading up to the Apocalypse.   Season 6-10 had shorter story arcs or more self-contained arcs.   Season 6-7 was after the Apocalypse and involved Sam's soul, souls, Purgatory and the Leviathans.   Season 8-10 Angel civil war and Metatron then the aftermath of the civil war (Mark of Cain and Cas's fading grace).  Part of the reason they didn't come up with a unique storyline like season 1-5 was because they weren't completely sure how many more seasons they would have (ratings and such) so they did a 2 season arc involving Purgatory and the Leviathans. They probably played it safe. Because there's nothing worse than being blindsided with a cancellation in the middle of the story."
Supernatural,3ahg84,D-Lowell,2,Tue Jun 23 17:58:12 2015 UTC,"I would give 2.5 to about 6.5 my vote for fav.  Earlier, the stories were scarier and creepier and more based on folk lore that we kind of knew which was awesome but I found Dean hitting on women every three minutes hard to handle. When that tappered off, I was a happy camper.  I also didn't mind 6 but the first bit of it was the better part.  7 - I thought lucifer was really glossed over. I thought the leviathan ending was weak. Also somewhere in 6 (and maybe part of 7??? I get lost sometimes) I found that the Eve sort was wrapped up too quick.   I see how making the show has changed since the end of S5 and the fact that they work on the assumption that they don't know if they're going to get picked up season to season but although supernatural was meant to last 5 seasons, there was no guarantee that it would so I guess I just have a hard time understanding why a longer plot can't be used anyways. Shows get cancelled all the time and don't get stuck in a loop of revolving story lines.  I guess when I really think of post season 5, I see a lot of good things that didn't get to their potential and were cut short. You could have taken any one of those story lines and run with it a bit longer."

SPOILERS   Enen though Ruby turns on them in the end and ends up being a bad guy they still should have gone with her plan. She knew the best way to save everyone."
Supernatural,3a99f4,stophauntingme,10,Thu Jun 18 07:19:36 2015 UTC,getting shot in the face/upper body with rock salt at close range is easily causing major harm to the body.   Eh. Nothing Sam hasn't done to Dean though (episode 'Asylum').   I doubt Dean would give a shit about tons of people having nonlethal rocksalt shotgun injuries versus cutting the beating heart out of a person. I wouldn't at least... & I'm pretty sure that makes me a good person. (edit: hell I'd voluntarily take a shotgun blast of rocksalt to the chest if it meant I was saving someone's life)

Supernatural,3a99f4,stophauntingme,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:24:50 2015 UTC,"The reason I ask is because when you find out what Ruby's intentions are you have to go back and question everything she does in terms of how it advances her plans. Now that we know Ruby was working with Lilith the entire time, Ruby must have known Lilith was coming to kill everyone--so Ruby's whole plan was to manipulate Sam and Dean to think they should have listened to her. (I didn't want to say all that if this was your first time watching the series)."
Supernatural,3a99f4,CrazyPlato,14,Mon Jun 22 01:48:20 2015 UTC,"Accepting the premise pitched by a demon would've been a terrible idea. Dean was rightfully suspicious over her ultimatum & rejected her concept, believing there was a way to either save everybody or die trying. Sacrificing an innocent soul is a corruption of honor.   Anyway, Dean & Sam succeeded in saving almost everybody... and they managed to do it without having to do something that'd haunt them forever. I'd call that a win.  Also with the end - the only reason the people died at the very end by Lilith was so Lilith could help Ruby manipulate the boys into thinking she was trustworthy & her plans were the only right ones (ie: paving the way for Sam to kill Lilith).  The boys had made the right choice about rejecting Ruby. Ruby just had the whole thing rigged to make sure she always came up on top."
Supernatural,3a99f4,funwiththoughts,7,Thu Jun 18 09:05:10 2015 UTC,"They're hunters. They're used to the idea of dealing with possessed people, where the mentality is that the vessels are already screwed no matter what (demons seem to enjoy just fucking up their vessels as they go, so that this is inevitable even if they're exorcised. Those bastards). Keep in mind as well that they're still mostly dealing with exorcisms, which don't actually hurt the vessels (they force the demon out, which was the only thing keeping the vessels alive at the time. See above, demons are dicks).  Then there's the secretary. She's innocent, as far as anyone can be at the time. She knows practically nothing about this crap, which makes her a civilian. Hunters try to avoid bringing civilians into this stuff, partly for their own safety (don't get more people involved who won't be able to defend themselves if things get bad), and partly for their own moral defense (I kill things for a living, but I only kill monsters. Protecting civilians is what separates me from the monsters). Plus, they've had time to meet this person a little, learn about her, and build a bit of a personal investment in her well-being."
Supernatural,3a99f4,CrazyPlato,2,Thu Jun 18 14:48:27 2015 UTC,"Remember also regarding killing demons:  1) We see from Meg Masters that exorcising a demon when their meat suit, while possessed, has something happen to them that would be lethal to a human, then the exorcism will kill the meat suit as well. No boundaries to this are ever defined.  2) It's never stated what the average time for a demon to stay in one meat suit is, but Meg, Ruby, Crowley, Azazel, and Abaddon all tended/tend to stick with one unless there's a specific reason not to (though Lilith jumped around a lot). All of the aforementioned demons stuck with their preferred vessel for the duration of a season or longer.  3) Demons don't eat, sleep, or drink.  With all this in mind, most exorcisms should kill the possessed anyway.  Now, the wrench in all this is Sam's claim to Dean. that ""with what I'm doing [i. e., psychic exorcisms], most of them [the meat suits] survive"". Though I suppose the question then would be, did he ever actually bother to check, or is he just assuming this?"
Supernatural,3a99f4,FoxInDaBox,2,Sat Jun 20 11:30:41 2015 UTC,"I get the impression that a lot of demons got out during the events of the previous seasons, like the opening of the devil's gate. As I understand it, Lillith kept most demons locked up down below, and only the strongest ones managed to get topside. But with the approaching chaos that is the apocalypse, it could be argued that Lillith has less time to guard the doors and thus more of the weaker demons are getting out.  This could be what happened with Sam. He got to demons who've only just managed to possess someone, and so they have time to get it out before it really hurt its meatsuit."

The whole concept of a bungee is that is bounces back right? So heavy metal object on the end of a cord that bounces back? In theory-great. In practice, it's a flying metal object with no control about where it lands.   The boys already get knocked another by monsters and spirits, can you imagine if they got taken out by their own weapons flying at their heads?  Funny, yes.

There's an /r/superwholock too & I've just never heard from them really.   Anyway, so yeah it's not about the fandom or the tumblr top three when I say this: I don't like SuperWhoLock. I don't get it. I don't get how they could combine the 3 universes in any way to make it not totally cracky. And while I appreciate crack pairings & cracky fics, etc, I'm willing to bet people who count themselves as SuperWhoLockians see a deeper non-cracky way to combine the universes that I just can't conceive of (so... I guess snaps to them; but every permutation of combining the universes I stop myself & go ""eh nah that's not good..."")"

Supernatural,3a1m2k,laurellestars,5,Tue Jun 16 19:38:53 2015 UTC,"Having been there myself, I believe this would be a memorable episode if not one of the best.  The way the house is laid out with stairways leaking nowhere, doors opening to walls and hidden passageways all over the place it could end up being a two part'er as long as it is written right. I would think the owners of the ""Winchester Mystery House"" would be absolutely stupid not to go along with it for the press and definite increase in tourism it would bring. Love what bluspacecow said about them being ancestors as that would be a perfect lead in to the story, Sam and Dean could stumble across something in the Men Of Letters' archives that says ""Winchester House"" on it that intrigues them to look into and go there. Also love what Roook36 said ""I want to see Dean get some sort of bad ass demon hunting Winchester rifle also."" This would be a great ending or culmination of events. Like the rifle was their birthright or something. brownmlis said ""It would have to be great Aunt Sarah since the death of her only child and husband was the reason she went guano. They could fight the ghost of William Winchester, or maybe the psychic who told her to build the crazy house was in league with a demon and the house is some crazy monster portal (I'm just spit balling here). Heck, lets just make is the headquaters for the Darkness since it/they are all about chaos anyway...""  This would be exceptional for plot development.  Ladies and Gentlemen, congratulations, I think we have the making of one of the best episodes yet.  Just wish the writers would read this or work could be gotten to them.  Another thought related to what brownmlis said, another angle could be that the WMH could be seen as some sort of refuge they find out about and the house ends up containing the key to defeating ""The Darkness"".  Just my humble opinion. Great ideas people !!!"

Also, it was unfortunate that Emma was killed so soon, since she was a child and hadn't hurt anyone yet.   The way she was killed and Dean's reaction to her death (shrugging it off, quickly forgiving Sam) was very callous.

Supernatural,39w91l,ProphetChuck,6,Mon Jun 15 08:45:38 2015 UTC,Is it worth getting? I'm stuck on my laptop for the summer and need some less demanding games. I already have Darkest Dungeon and I'm considering this one as well.
Supernatural,39w91l,R3p3rTh3l3n,9,Mon Jun 15 09:39:26 2015 UTC,"I'd check this Let's Play if I were you.  I've always been a fan of survival based games, scavenging resources and making the most of what you've got. If you're not a fan of ""The Last Stand Dead Zone"" or any other non-survival based game, then don't buy it.   I love the character interactions, theft, murder, hunger; illness can cause depression and even suicide. It's gritty and you're punished for losing your humanity, unlike other games where killing is the norm.   For example, I broke into an old couple’s house and stole all their food. My scavenger returned home and everybody within my compound was filled with worry about the old couple.   They had to drink alcohol to suppress their feelings. The only thing I don’t like is the combat system, open confrontations are not recommended.  Other than that, This War of Mine is a brilliant game in my eyes and your money’s worth. As I said before, watch the Let’s Play first, see how you like it."
Supernatural,39w91l,R3p3rTh3l3n,4,Mon Jun 15 10:28:17 2015 UTC,"You should check out Darkest Dungeon, I think you'd like it.   From what I'm gathering, you like games where you build teams, train them, gather resources, etc.  DD is that on steroids. Let me give you an example.  It took me around 4 hours of gameplay to get a four man team to level 2. It was time to take on a level 1 floor boss. I had to send two suicide squads into smaller floors in order gather the money needed to fund the Boss expedition. I lost around half of the parties each time, then had to dismiss the remaining characters, less their insanity would spread to my hero's.  This took another two hours.   Finally I had everything planned. Everyone was level headed, upgraded, and the provisions would last us through a medium expedition. We descended into the Dungeon.   In order to fight the boss, you actually have to find the bastard. This search weighed on my parties sanity heavily, I began to grow concerned. Still, we camped. We rallied each other spirits, knowing the boss was in the next room, with nothing in our path. My party laid there heads to sleep before the big fight.  They came in the night.   Fell upon the party, causing confusion among the ranks. The healer found himself in the front line, the cursed abominations fell upon his fear.  He was crittied twice, then poisoned. He died before I could get a secondary Abealst heal on him.   Hours of work, preparation, characters lives and sanity. All gone by a swift strike before I even faced my foe.  I haven't put the game down since."

Supernatural,39x3rz,general_dipwad,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:24:54 2015 UTC,"I keep feeling that Michael wouldn't give two shits about Adam being tortured..... To go one step further, he may have even blamed Adam for his failure. He and Zachariah used every dirty trick in the book to try to coerce Dean into letting Michael in (like a sleazy boyfriend trying to get a girl to sleep with him); and I'm pretty sure if it hadn't been for the whole angels-can't-override-free-will constraint, Micheal would have just straight up mind-raped Dean. He took Adam as a poor man's Dean. In Michael's self righteous mind, if he ended up in the cage, it was Dean's fault for refusing him, and Adam's fault for being weaker than Dean - whether he did as he was asked or not.  Just my 2¢"
Supernatural,39x3rz,Gogogadgetskates,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:46:00 2015 UTC,"But Michael's the ""good son"", that's his role. Even being trapped in the cage I can't imagine he'd let Lucifer hurt Adam, his father's creation. Afterall messing with humanity was what got Lucifer cast into hell in the first place."
Supernatural,39x3rz,Gogogadgetskates,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:50:22 2015 UTC,"I'm sticking with my sleazy boyfriend analogy, because it's really the best way I can think of to accurately express my thoughts on it (even though the gender thing is all sorts of inside out). Sleazy boyfriend (Michael) can't get the girl (vessel) he wants (Dean) so he takes second best (Adam), his plan was to love-and-leave (no matter who fell for his line, he just wanted to get what he wanted), and when second best comes up pregnant (locked in the cage) he's all 'not my problem, you knew the risks. I've got my own stuff to deal with, you do what you want to do.' and leaves second best to fend for herself (himself). I just feel like as long as he wasn't directly harming Adam, he wouldn't feel like any inaction in defending Adam would be the same thing as harming him.  Granted, it's been awhile since I've seen those episodes, this was just the impressions I got from the character, and they've been stewing in my brain. It's entirely possible that when I watch them again, that I could change my mind."

Non desinet is the negative present third person singular of to end. Its the verb.  Sanguine is in the ablative singular because of ""with""   I've taken Latin for five years but could totally be wrong. Ya know, everyone makes mistakes. Please correct me if I'm wrong."
Supernatural,39z9eq,Royal_Robin,3,Tue Jun 16 04:08:13 2015 UTC,You're right. I took 4 years of latin in HS!
Supernatural,39z9eq,Jacob1030,2,Tue Jun 16 23:03:10 2015 UTC,Sweeeet. I haven't had to brush up in awhile. This was fun. Especially having to defend myself
Supernatural,39z9eq,Royal_Robin,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:05:40 2015 UTC,"I know approximately nothing about Latin, but just wondering, since the quote is ""Family don't end with blood,"" shouldn't it be in the negative present third person plural? I don't know if that makes any difference in Latin, but in English the singular would make it ""doesn't,"" not ""don't."" Just a thought, I could be wrong!"
Supernatural,39z9eq,barbiedawg,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:15:22 2015 UTC,"Well I was chalking ""don't"" up to bobby being well sort of a hick. Because if you break down the contraction you get "" family do no end in blood""   I also was understanding family as an idea. Beyond that, family in English is often considered a collective singular. Even if bobby had been trying to mean family as a plural it would be "" family they do not end in blood"" which does not convey what he means. He means that the concept of family is about more than genetics."
Supernatural,39z9eq,Royal_Robin,3,Tue Jun 16 05:59:17 2015 UTC,"Minor point:   Well I was chalking ""don't"" up to dean being well sort of a hick.   The quote is from Bobby, not Dean."

Supernatural,39z9eq,Royal_Robin,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:25:22 2015 UTC,"No I understand what the quote is saying, I just meant that in his colloquial phrasing, Bobby uses the English plural, whereas you translate using the Latin singular. I didn't know if you needed to use the Latin plural to make it a direct translation, albeit grammatically incorrect thanks to Bobby being, as you said, a hick."
Supernatural,39z9eq,barbiedawg,1 point,Wed Jun 17 04:05:50 2015 UTC,Yeah I took it upon myself to fix the grammar because it wouldn't translate well to Latin. Latin is actually pretty strict about that.

Supernatural,39z9eq,Xetiw,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:27:30 2015 UTC,Both. Desinere has a lot of options. The first definition listed is to end though. The second is to leave and there are better words for to leave like linquere or exire or deserere   Edit: Also you translated it as though I was using the future tense. I was not using the future tense. that's a different set of endings altogether
Supernatural,39z9eq,Royal_Robin,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:24:47 2015 UTC,"Sanguine doesn't look right? It looks more French than Latin, and even then I'm not sure about the ablative declension."
Supernatural,39z9eq,Vio_,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:30:55 2015 UTC,"Well its from sanguis, sanguinis neuter third declension.   The ablative choice comes from it being paired in English with the word ""with"" it could also be an object of preposition ""in"" since bobby doesn't have great grammar, but prepositions can be implied through the use of the ablative anyway."
Supernatural,39z9eq,Royal_Robin,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:40:37 2015 UTC,I'm going to look it up when I get home. It sounds like a borrowed word and not like Latin at all. Maybe Etruscan or Greek?

Plus, my theory is when they're on the road they don't stop for anything except gas for Baby, so when they actually get to their destination I'm sure they're starving. On top of that, chasing monsters and killing will probably keep you in shape. People probably don't realize how much energy to takes to kill things the way they do. And they probably work out/walk it off when they're trying to figure something out because physical activity leads to an increase in creative thinking.   Also, Dean is the one that mostly eats poorly. Usually Sam has a salad or  something like that."

Supernatural,39v7lz,bullet4mv92,6,Mon Jun 15 18:37:00 2015 UTC,"It's just one of those TV/movie cliches that's widely accepted but, in reality, is completely flawed. If you're regularly knocked out for more than a few seconds at a time, you'll likely suffer some damage to your brain. But they're regularly knocked out for a couple hours and just kind of wake up in a haze, with no side effects whatsoever.   Kinda one of those things that you just have to go ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Edit: For fucks sake... Since everyone's taking my comment way too damn literally, I obviously didn't mean that getting knocked out one time for a few seconds will give you permanent brain damage. It should be obvious that I'm exaggerating for the sake of comparing things to the show, and how they should have some serious brain damage. Didn't think I seriously had to explain myself there...

I was also slightly exaggerating, but I didn't think someone would think ""a few seconds"" means 3-4 seconds or whatever. And yeah, obviously getting knocked out once for a few seconds won't make you a vegetable. You know what I meant. Anyone in the real world that spends as much time unconscious as Sam and Dean do would have serious problems - that was the point of my comment.   I also said nothing about a concussion, so I don't know where you got that. Sam and Dean are never shown to get concussions - they're shown to be knocked out cold for hours at a time, which is what I'm talking about."

My headcanon is that by season 3 about 60% of a Dean's teeth are false, and maybe 2 or 3 of Sam's (he had student healthcare coverage in college and wasn't hunting then, and Dean always made sure he brushed his teeth as a kid, so he's formed a lot of good habits).  Any tooth breakage from season 4/5 onward has been healed by angelic means."

Supernatural,39uvip,mb95421,2,Mon Jun 15 00:03:39 2015 UTC,"yeah geekguri answer is ok.  that was the time when Castiel's grace got stolen by Metraton, the damaged wings comes from ""the fall"" not because his grace was stolen.  the way they explain it is... angels needs to be connected to heaven or they grow weak as they use their powers, if they arent connected to heaven they can regain ""angelic stamina"" slowly, really slowly, and sometimes they cant do the things they used to do before because it takes way too much power.  now using someone's else grace is like using batteries that are 70% charged and burns 2x faster without regaining ""angelic stamina"".  you will notice Castiel grow powerful(or at least thats what they make us believe) once he got his grace back."
Supernatural,39uvip,Xetiw,0,Tue Jun 16 11:39:23 2015 UTC,"Huh. okay. Interesting... Thank you for replying also, but now that brings up follow up question in my mind. ...  So if an unplugged angel uses too much angel mojo, do they become completely human with no chance of regaining any angelic powers (like Cas in the apocalypse showdown episode), almost completely human and powerless (like in the endtimes verse), or do they die?   Follow up follow up question, can Cas even fly anymore? What are his limitations now? (Like I said I'm a little behind on my SPN, and i dont mind spoilers cuz im gonna be catching up in the next few monthes anyway)"
Supernatural,39uvip,Xetiw,2,Tue Jun 16 17:59:10 2015 UTC,"tough question to be honest, as the show runs things ""the way they need to be"" mostly, things are unacurate most of the time but ill answer the best I can  as the show told us, angels are alike humans plus the ""grace"" that allow them to be powerful, for what I can see if an unplugged angel  waste their mojo slowly but steady without waiting for the mojo to recover they will become humans, if they burn their grace faster (like really fast doing something they shouldnt such as turn their light on as seen when Castiel turn his light to stop Crowley from taking the Demon tablet) they might damage their vessel and become humans or die depending on the angel ( we can see their nose bleed and they go into comatose state )  to answer your follow up question we need to separate things first, Castiel is a Seraph, while other are just angels.  there is a big difference into categories, actually no angel can fly ( we dont know about archangels since they werent on heaven when Metraton casted the spell and we havent seen any since Gabriel and then again we dont know if that was some trick by Metraton) the spell Metraton casted was pretty much a spell to burn every angel's wing ( the teleport thing ) so they cant go to heaven anymore, although they can still access heaven by some portals , so no, Castiel nor other angel can fly, maybe Metraton and thats it.  what are his limitations? well hes an fallen angel but still a Seraph, theres a big difference between angels and Seraph, while fallen angels would lose a few of their power such as smiting and healing not everyone would lose them, but they wont be able to bend time nor be able to do resurrection because they need a connection with heaven to do it.  while Castiel is a Seraph, they are on another whole level, Castiel has ""become"" human 2 times during supernatural, first time was when he put a sigil on himself to vanish angels, its unclear if he would've stayed human or become angel again, as Seraphims doesnt really need connection to heaven, he did say he drained his batteries thats why he was feeling like an human, if I were to guess, he would become full angel within time, sadly we didnt get to see since he was killed and bring back to life by god quickly, the second time was when his grace was stolen, no need to elaborate on that, seems it doesnt matter how powerful the angel is, if someone were to drain the grace its over for them, they become humans until they get someone's else grace or their own, it seems the only power they hold after becoming humans is the so called ""angel's radio"".  about Seraphims limitations they shouldnt really had none, their limitations are based on the ""mojo"" they use and the time they need to regain that mojo, I mean Castiel is able to bring people back to life up until season 8 when his grace his stolen by Metraton, but to be honest where is the fun if he keep bringing people back to life? after all when he fall from heaven his batteries become an issue, bringing people would require much power and you know... alot of people die on supernatural.  unlike your average angel, Castiel is able to bend time and bring people to life without direct connection to heaven, due the fact he's a Seraph, there is 2 confirmed Seraphims; Castiel and Zachariah and 2(for sure)-3-4?? not confirmed being, Anna, Gadrieel, Metraton and Naomi.  Its believed Anna was a Seraph due her rank, since she was Castiel's superior and you cant have a Seraph being orderer by an angel, but you can have a Seraph ordering another Seraph, she also traveled back in time by herself, not angel is capable of such act without a source of energy(a soul for example) or being plugged to heaven, she was weakened by traveling which means she did it by herself, not channeling a source of energy.  Gadrieel must be an Seraph, as he said he needed time to heal himself and Sam, he was charging his batteries, something unplugged angels cant do, and he was able to bring Castiel back to life after he was killed, and since Seraphs doesnt really need to be plugged to bring people back to life it means he is in fact a Seraph  Its unclear what Metraton is, if we go back to real history, the bible says he was an archangel, but he doesnt seem like archangel on the serie, he doesnt seem as week as an angel too, and since he spent alot of time on earth and didnt drain his batteries its safe to believe he is a Seraph or maybe the ""scribe of god"" its something between average angels and Seraphs  Naomi, she was a high ranking angel from an secret division, its believed shes an Seraph because of the powers she had, that were above angel's level and seems angels work military wise and just follow the higher rank they find.  inside Seraphims there are stronger ones, if I were to list them by their strenght it would be like this  Zachariah - Naomi - Anna - Castiel / Gadrieel - and im not sure about Metraton, while I would rate Castiel ( full force ) and Gadrieel at the same level  tl:dr Castiel is more powerful than your average angel, because he is a Seraph, his limitations are pretty much none they are based on the his mojo and the time he needs to recover it, sometimes writters weaken him just for the sake of the episode/serie, because there cant be a being so powerful helping the boys 24/7 it would be unfair and boring."

Sam will feel ... indifferent and then the trio will ask God for help (though asking for help is pointless as God can read their thoughts and memories as well as the future). Also because: - Sam was purified from the demon blood after Lucifer rose - Castiel was resurrected no matter how many times he was killed. -Let's face it, God can't be killed. Dean can only hopelessly scream. And IF God is killed then Dean, Sam everything dies. And Dean doesn't want to lose Sam or the world. So, he'll be too.... shocked and angry to do anything except throw a punch and break his own fingers as a result."

I guess they would pour some holy water, borax, and try to cut him with a silver knife asking who his him, and then they will guess he was resurected or he will say hes been god all along  to be honest i dont see how Dean and Sam would be able to fight the darkness without god / archangels, we might be seeing all in, every evil thing pairing with every good being just to stop the darkness."

Only we the audience know that Chuck is God, or alluded to being God from interviews with the actor and such. To Sam and Dean, Chuck was a prophet, and the existence of Kevin the new prophet meant Chuck died. So they're under the assumption Chuck is dead, so if they run into Chuck again, I'm sure it'll just be confusion that he is alive."

Despite the plans set for him, Dean refuses the help, and tells someone else to go.  This is akin to his refusal of Michael as a vessel in order to spare lives.  Note that, in the same episode, Sam wanders from Dean, and goes in to the cellar, which, from the lighting, has an orange glow to it.  This is symbolic of Sam's looming descent in to dark territory and possibly Hell itself.  Good catch on the episode though! I'm currently relating season 4 to season 10, and I predict season 11 will be a spectacular season!"

Supernatural,39p278,DMichellee,12,Sat Jun 13 11:09:11 2015 UTC,"The writing was the biggest problem i had with season 10. Not enough Castiel. Rowena seemed all over the place (and dragged crowley into her mess of a storyline).  While i enjoyed the mark of cain storyline, i felt it dragged on a little too long, conversely the Dean is a demon storyline was a little too short.  The new character Cole they introduced went nowhere, I didn't care at all about Jimmy's daughter storyline and the standalone filler episodes simply weren't as fun as previous seasons.  Still enjoyed it. just not as much..."
Supernatural,39p278,GallbladderGone,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:36:36 2015 UTC,was    I agree the writing was pretty terrible. I would've liked to see so many different possible ideas rather than one reason dragged out one that didn't amount to much.
Supernatural,39p278,Vio_,3,Thu Jul 16 11:02:55 2015 UTC,"The issue is that they didn't do what needed to be done to get the plot where it needed to be. Pacing was, yet again, terrible during a Carver season. But more do, they are scared shitless of Dark Dean. They are barely allowing that beast unleashed, and quickly fix him the moment he gets anywhere with that plot. The same moc Dean plot failed as much as Demon Dean. In the end, it went nowhere and amounted to nothing. I've never seen a reset button hit as hard as with Dark Dean."
Supernatural,39p278,brucebwang,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:53:28 2015 UTC,"Definitely.  They pulled back Dark Dean because they didn't want to get so in depth.  I would've loved to see Dark Dean dragged so far in that he has to crawl his way out of blood.  The dark/blood addicted Sam was much better and the pain, the addiction, the whole damn plot was Amazing with Sam when he went through that.  But Dean.. they just lost their balls with that one."
Supernatural,39p278,stophauntingme,3,Thu Jul 16 11:05:09 2015 UTC,Cas has been a fan favorite for a while and considering they're running out of ideas for the show killing him off seems super unlikely. Sam was kind of pushed into the background too this season so it's not surprising that Cass did as well. I expect he'll have a bigger role next season with them basically fucked and left with the only option of trying to find God or archangels to have any chance
Supernatural,39p278,Xynth22,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:18:56 2015 UTC,Yup.. it's frustrating.  I just hope season 11 is better. I did enjoy season 10 but the plot wholes and character writing is too much to ignore

Supernatural,39n7ol,OptionalCookie,3,Sat Jun 13 05:13:17 2015 UTC,"See, when Sam and Dean were originally created, we had to create Sam to have much more muscle than Dean has, due to the noticeable difference in real life. However, due to Dean having less muscle, he is more Prone to gaining fat. From watching almost all the seasons of Supernatural, we realized that Dean loves food, so we set his attitude to ""glutton"", however I think he's become a bit too obsessed with food, and now has to go back to the gym...

Supernatural,39nn8g,funwiththoughts,1 point,Sat Jun 13 07:52:12 2015 UTC,I'm talking about the same john Winchester who was so hardcore that hell's head of torture couldn't break him. also you never play with your food?
Supernatural,39nn8g,Prancing_Unicorn,3,Sat Jun 13 02:11:22 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't exactly say that stubbornness directly correlates to skill as a hunter. Also who's the food? John or Azazel?  What are you basing the claim that John is ""the greatest hunter to ever live"" on? I've never seen anyone share that opinion. Sure he was good but it's a pretty subjective thing. Based on canon feats alone he didn't really accomplish all that much."
Supernatural,39nn8g,Prancing_Unicorn,-1,Sat Jun 13 02:45:44 2015 UTC,"my friends and I have always said that John is out fighting way stronger monsters than Sam or Dean. the things they hunt in the first season are John's ""scraps."" he is clearly a different class than his son's in the first season. I figure if you extrapolate that into the past ~8 seasons since he would probably be better than many of the men of letters (like his father). also Azazel is the food."
Supernatural,39nn8g,Vio_,6,Sat Jun 13 03:04:49 2015 UTC,"I think we have strongly different interpretations of the character. I definitely agree that John had bigger things going on in the earlier seasons, but we seem to disagree as to how ""big"" those things were. I mostly saw his absence as obsession over Azazel, rather than any big battles he was fighting with unknown big-bads. To me he spent his days (and life) obsessively hunting down leads and gathering information about that single cause."
Supernatural,39nn8g,Prancing_Unicorn,0,Sat Jun 13 03:54:48 2015 UTC,"We're not talking about a single demon. We're talking about Azazel, who was basically the king pro tem of hell. We think of demons now as redshirt extras #3, but only really the most powerful ones were on Earth up until Jake opened the hell gate in S2, and Azazel was the top of the heap."
Supernatural,39nn8g,Pronato,6,Sat Jun 13 03:04:10 2015 UTC,"I mean sure, but Sam and Dean have defeated MULTIPLE would-be kings of Hell including Crowley, Abaddon, and Lucifer himself, not to mention many other beings on that tier including alphas, eve, archangels, and gods. All of that in half the time it took John to off Azzy. And granted they had help but we're talking an order of magnitude more success on Sam and Dean's part. I'm not saying John was incompetent, but in a discussion of whether John is more capable than his sons, I firmly vote ""no"". I would even hazard from what little we know that Mary would have been more capable than John, although it's a hard comparison to make as they don't seem to have ever been hunting at the same time. If we pit pre-marriage Mary against John at his time of death, I'm not sure who'd be a ""better"" hunter."
Supernatural,39nn8g,ChronaMewX,2,Sat Jun 13 03:49:42 2015 UTC,We think of demons now as redshirt extras #3   That analogy made me laugh. It's true.
Supernatural,39nn8g,Jezer1,5,Mon Jun 15 15:58:17 2015 UTC,"John is severely outclassed...took him a quarter century to track down a single demon, never had to fight an angel or leviathan, never fought anything even close to Lucifer or Abaddon or even Lillith's strength, the Horsemen, Death, etc. John was good back in the day, but the kiddie gloves have been removed since he died"
Supernatural,39nn8g,AllThingsWillEnd,2,Sat Jun 13 02:13:52 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't really understand this wanking for John. He did drastically worse against vampires than Sam and Dean have(would have been killed in that hostage situation if not for Sam and Dean). He did drastically worse against demons. It literally doesn't make sense to act like he was superior to current Sam and Dean, nor to them in some of the past seasons."

Supernatural,39nn8g,Xynth22,2,Sat Jun 13 02:07:29 2015 UTC,I'm talking about the end of season 10.   You mean the one where Dean KILLS DEATH? Is that even a question?
Supernatural,39nn8g,AllThingsWillEnd,0,Sat Jun 13 07:57:51 2015 UTC,"If John had the chance to take on the same things that Sam and Dean fight, then he would still be the better hunter.  Remember, John takes on nests of vamps by himself, similar to Gordon.  Except Gordon was a nutbag."
Supernatural,39nn8g,laurellestars,2,Sat Jun 13 02:51:34 2015 UTC,"Both Sam and Dean have taken out whole nests of vampires by themselves. Dean has been shown to do it several times, and both did it off screen several times as well."
Supernatural,39nn8g,Bloodinhaler,-1,Sat Jun 13 09:53:54 2015 UTC,I'm just saying John was doing that kind of work when the boys were just learning what vamps were.  Imagine if he didn't die.

Supernatural,39mw4c,Blushercup,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:17:51 2015 UTC,The second showrunner of seasons 6 & 7 had been a writer for supernatural since season 1. Sera Gamble.
Supernatural,39mw4c,stophauntingme,-1,Sat Jun 13 02:30:35 2015 UTC,"This is true. So Sera Gamble took Eric Kripke's place....not really smart. Sera needs to get on the same train of the thought as Kripke was. Sera's getting there, but she still needs to pick up the pace a bit. She's running the shows a little slow and giving a bit too much detail. It could be the fact that she's a girl that's causing the show to be different. Guys and girls do think quite differently even if you give them the exact same problem. She's on a role now though and if she keeps the show like this, she'll be on the path that Kripke left."
Supernatural,39mw4c,Blushercup,8,Sat Jun 13 02:48:21 2015 UTC,Dude. Sera Gamble stepped down at the end of season 7 and Jeremy Carver took over as showrunner in season 8. He's been running the show ever since & will be running it during S11.  edit: way to attribute the shitty writing to a woman though that's just... grrrreat
Supernatural,39mw4c,stophauntingme,4,Sat Jun 13 02:50:15 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna bite the bullet here and say it's fine to attribute the shitty writing to a woman because her writing is shitty. The previous poster was wrong though, about it being her gender that caused the bad writing. She just wasn't a greater writer or show lead, and a lack of consistent plot arc from both her and Carver made a lot of fans unhappy.   Every season since season 5 has been wrapped up in 3 or so episodes from the next season, and a new threat comes along. We are going through plot too fast, and shitty plot at that. Season 6 had the weapons of heaven plot, and the souls, but the weapons plot was dropped, and the souls took too long to convey the overall message. And even then, those were a backseat issue when Eve was summoned. A big bad who lasted under half a season? Ouch.  Leviathan made me laugh.  Enough said.  The best thing to come from Sera was the Alpha Vamp.  Carver had a good idea with Purgatory but horrible execution.  Benny was great though. But again, a plot that carries or ties in more than a few episodes is needed."
Supernatural,39mw4c,thomasatnip,0,Sun Jun 14 07:03:15 2015 UTC,"I wasn't saying her writing was shitty.... I am a woman, so I'd never say something was shitty due to gender, I was just saying their thinking could be different which is causing the show to go in a different angle.  Thank you for telling me that Jeremy Carver took over. I didn't know this. That explains why the show is different....because they have a few new people."
Supernatural,39mw4c,Blushercup,2,Sat Jun 13 03:04:48 2015 UTC,"Fair enough - you did only say ""different"" - I def misquoted you on that. But still like... pre- & mis-conceptions of female writers abound & they're not gender-specific.  Jeremy Carver was a writer for Supernatural during seasons 3-5. He left during seasons 6 & 7 (when Gamble was showrunning to showrun Being Human with his wife) & then got hired to run Supernatural seasons 8-?"
Supernatural,39mw4c,stophauntingme,2,Sat Jun 13 03:09:26 2015 UTC,"Hmm...that's interesting...I wonder why the episodes seem a bit slower to me then... do they seem slower to you too, or is it just me??"
Supernatural,39mw4c,Blushercup,4,Sat Jun 13 03:17:05 2015 UTC,"Carver runs the show like a shitty stick-shift driver. He speeds up in the beginning, brakes fast, stalls, blocks traffic as he tries to get the plot to start up again throughout the entirety of the season, and the last few episodes of his seasons finally revs up again & we all hope this time it'll be good.  This metaphor will get a little lost on people who haven't dissected plot movement during the seasons but... it's generally accurate I think. His season finale cliffhangers are the shit, then his premiers are underwhelming, then the rest of the season is basically filler (edit: with a few jumpstart episodes throughout that give us hope & then still fail), then he revs up the mythology/plot towards the end of the season, we all get excited, then we get a cool cliffhanger, and then it's all over again with the underwhelming+filler/failed-jumpstart episodes until the end of that season.  That's just how I feel at least."
Supernatural,39mw4c,stophauntingme,2,Sat Jun 13 03:25:31 2015 UTC,That pretty much hits the nail on the head. Nice metaphor btw.

Supernatural,39mw4c,emmster,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:49:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah. She did really well for having to take over for him. I give her props for running it like she did. She is doing a really great job. I think personally. Obviously Kripke would be the best, but people move on."
Supernatural,39mw4c,Blushercup,2,Sat Jun 13 20:58:29 2015 UTC,"Based on the fact that the Darkness is the next big bad for season 11, it could be the last season since it'd be pretty tough to top the Darkness since The Darkness is universal level, on par with God and Death if not stronger.  Not unless the release of the Darkness ultimately breaks down the line between the supernatural and normal world. After sealing the darkness, season 12's big bad would be factions of humanity reacting differently to the supernatural. Some could be like hunters, some could go crazy with the occult stuff, some might want to destroy everything supernatural so their world could go back to the way it was or go the cliche' way of trying to control it. But this could also be used as a sub-plot for season 11 as well.  It'd be pretty tough to maintain the suspension of disbelief if the normal world kept going on its merry way if the Darkness is threatening to destroy the world if not all of creation. Black smoke covering the entire world... Supercharged Castiel ""cleaning"" up the world didn't exactly go unnoticed either. Smiting hypocritical religious leaders, white supremacists, lying politicians and new-age motivational speakers. In SPN, normal people might be ignorant about the supernatural but there should be a limit. The Winchesters taking on the Darkness themselves would strain credulity. God and his archangels couldn't destroy the Darkness; they could only seal it.  It could be interesting if the next big bad after the Darkness was humanity because a large part of hunters' reason for hunting is to not only save people and to hunt but also to protect the supernatural from spilling over into the normal world."
Supernatural,39mw4c,D-Lowell,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:53:47 2015 UTC,"The people at the CW keep saying they want the show to run for as long as Jared and Jensen are interested, and neither of them has said anything yet indicating that they want this to be the last season, so the writers may just stretch out The Darkness over multiple seasons (or pull a Season 6 and follow up this end-of-the-world force with something more low key)."

I think your premise with Tiamat is unlikely to happen with Supernatural because SPN takes all legends & mythology (biblical or not) & just tears it all apart lol.   I think it'd basically be giving Carver & the writers too much faith to think they'd parallel a real myth in any fair, accurate & compelling way in season 11.  You're not thinking too hard & you're not breaking any rules!  lol  Read /r/supernatural's sidebar & check out reddiquette if you're new. :)"

So I can't be here.  Ben: You think something will follow you home?  Dean: No. No, I don't, but I think my job turns me into something that can't sit at your dinner table. And if I stayed, you'd end up just like me.   Dean tried to end things after he nearly killed Lisa when he was a vampire. Then he shoved Ben. After Ben tricks Dean into coming back, Lisa tells Dean she expects every call to be Sam telling her Dean's dead. Ben is obviously hurt by Dean leaving and Lisa can't continue waiting for the worst. He's trying to save them from the pain of him leaving or dying. Crowley was pretty much the only one who knew about them and he isn't going to use them again. Dean wants them to have a normal life so badly that he's willing to risk a random supernatural problem.  I can't see them coming back.

Supernatural,397dc1,puglifejm,5,Tue Jun 9 20:01:07 2015 UTC,"So I think stophauntingme hit the nail on the head (much better than I could have) about this issue. We really shouldn't make assumptions or blow things out of proportion.   Until JP says he's depressed, we shouldn't assume he's actually depressed (and much less clinically depressed).   JP made a good point about overworking: “Don’t get caught up trying to think you’re supposed to do more, or to think you’re supposed to please everybody,” he added. “Take care of yourself.” I couldn't agree more.   Good to have the Moose back."
Supernatural,397dc1,laurellestars,16,Wed Jun 10 08:53:38 2015 UTC,"So. That Variety article really doesn't feature JP saying he legit has clinical depression. I'm not saying he truly is or isn't clinically depressed, but the story JP told really didn't come off like confirmation.   It did come off like he's had issues & he's struggled before though & that's all he really needed to say (actually he didn't even have to say that) to get me to respect & love his cause & efforts.  Edit: please please don't take this as diminishing or exaggerating anything. I'm just thinking respect for a person = portraying their stories & their motivations accurately. JP's medical information was not released in that Variety article & MTV's article made it sound like it was - & made it sound like it was the only reason why JP started the #AlwaysKeepFighting campaign which, if you read the Variety article, is totally false."
Supernatural,397dc1,stophauntingme,6,Tue Jun 9 20:42:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not a doctor but I work in mental health. The diagnostic criteria for clinical depression /MDD is actually pretty specific. It's not a blanket diagnosis that you tack onto everyone who appears to be depressed.  If I'm reading the quote right, MTV used the term, not Jared himself. My guess is that it was a misuse of words."
Supernatural,397dc1,Gogogadgetskates,4,Wed Jun 10 01:31:35 2015 UTC,Yeah my point was that MTV reported inaccurate/unconfirmed information about JP's mental health.
Supernatural,397dc1,stophauntingme,2,Wed Jun 10 01:33:09 2015 UTC,Totally. But I guess my point was that people use the term clinically depressed as a blanket statement and many don't understand what it means. Not excusing it though. I should have been more clear.
Supernatural,397dc1,Gogogadgetskates,4,Wed Jun 10 01:35:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly though JP totally may have been diagnosed with clinical depression - I have no idea - we all have no idea... because it really wasn't confirmed in the article. Additionally, JP talked about how he'd just recently lost a friend to suicide over this past Christmas, how he was in the middle of shooting an episode (The Werther Project I think) that featured suicide, & maybe not in the article but somewhere (I think a facebook video) he talks about how his bud Stephen Amell encouraged him to use social media (specifically facebook) to raise $$ for a cause close to his heart. A lot of things contributed to the timing & his decision to start the #AlwaysKeepFighting campaign but it feels like articles by the likes of MTV simply saw ""clinical depression"" in the Variety interview & zeroed in on that.  Granted, I don't think (I don't think anyone thinks) MTV has a high level of journalistic integrity in the first place so it's not that big of a deal. But... idk I just sort of wanted to put it out there.  edit: took out word"
Supernatural,397dc1,stophauntingme,2,Wed Jun 10 02:12:23 2015 UTC,"I'm the end, it doesn't matter I guess (the label of either being clinically depressed or not). It's just a shitty thing to do - put that sort of label on someone who hasn't admitted to it themselves.  It's also something inherently personal so I give anyone who speaks up credit, no matter how much or how little they choose to share. They have balls of steel. It's still a super tough thing for most people to admit to friends and family - even if it was isolated and in the past - never mind so openly."
Supernatural,397dc1,Gogogadgetskates,2,Wed Jun 10 02:32:54 2015 UTC,I'd just appreciate accurate & responsible reporting when it comes to such personal & sensitive issues.
Supernatural,397dc1,stophauntingme,10,Wed Jun 10 02:38:05 2015 UTC,"Just because somebody isn't clinically depressed doesn't mean they aren't depressed. So many people suffer from it, myself included."
Supernatural,397dc1,xeqtioner0,9,Tue Jun 9 20:58:38 2015 UTC,"The MTV article quote:   It’s a passion project for the actor, who’s been open about his own clinical depression.   ...and links to the Variety article where JP didn't really confirm that. That's all I wanted to address."

It's rude we're all assuming that Jared recently had a ""depressive episode"" without him having said so.  Having said that, being overworked can lead to burnout and/or depression. Think about it, after he's done filming in Canada, it's on to the cons."
Supernatural,397dc1,laurellestars,3,Mon Jun 15 21:22:41 2015 UTC,You're right that it's rude to assume. I made that same point in another thread and the person I was replying to was not happy.

Supernatural,396p1c,voodoona,9,Tue Jun 9 17:23:43 2015 UTC,"Depends on the con.  Vancon, Texas, Vegas, & Jus in Bello are the winningest cons to attend I think, all for separate reasons: Vancon you get to meet & chat with the other cast & crew of SPN + visit set locations, Texas J2's families attend with them, Vegas bc it's Vegas, & Jus in Bello because it's Italy & they're allowed to drink during their panels (""shots of apple juice"" as they say).  I think other smaller ones are cool too - Jersey, for example, I've heard is so small that it's a super awesome experience.

We did enjoy it, so we are going for the full 3 days in August. Just look at the Creation page for the one you are interested in (can also look up previous ones to see the schedules, they aren't carbon copies, but they'll give you an idea of times etc) and see what ticket options are available. Maybe, as a first time, go for one day (which ever actor/s you are most interested in) to keep expenses and expectations in check.   All photos are extra, but depending on the ticket type, some autographs are included. There are a whole bunch of extras (meet and greets etc.) Creation does like to....squeeze fans :) but just buy what you can afford and interests you :)"

Supernatural,3967bj,kittysballs,6,Tue Jun 9 15:26:00 2015 UTC,Started watching the show summer after season 1 aired so... it's taken me about 9 years to catch up lol.
Supernatural,3967bj,stophauntingme,5,Tue Jun 9 16:07:23 2015 UTC,"Seasons 1-9 in two weeks while working full-time, caught up to live TV early in season 10 and finished in real time.  I lost my partner in November from cancer, and in April I hit a wall. I'd never really grieved him and I finally just imploded. I stopped eating, stopped sleeping, and needed something to distract me from completely falling apart. I had this show called Supernatural in my Netflix queue and decided to start watching it as a distraction since it had so many seasons available.  I went through two weeks of absolute hell and Supernatural was with me the whole time. I reached my breakthrough around the middle of season 9, realizing that the reason I felt at a standstill was that it was time for me to move on in my life. I'm currently in the process of selling everything I own and moving to an area where I can more seriously pursue my art and music."

Couple suggestions/requests :)    /r/Supernatural & /r/SupernaturalTV are currently sharing FAQs in the form of /u/eightofnine's now-archived post to /r/Supernatural here. I'm wondering if you guys could figure it out so the FAQ is its own wiki page so the mods of /r/Supernatural can edit & add to it whenever they'd like versus messaging /u/eightofnine to edit a post they made 8 months ago for the FAQ of a sub they don't even moderate. Can we add this to the FAQ? Serge Ladouceur, director of photography, director of some of the best-directed episodes of SPN. Yes here's the gif, no, we don't know why he's so spritely dodging bullets, & yes that's an actor: this is the real Serge Ladouceur."

We need to archive discussions, work on fan resources etc... 8/9 is going to continue to mod /r/SupernaturalTV  and I expect we can convince her to do an update of the faq's for both subs before S11.  Then instead of linking it we can copy the source and post it to a wiki page (good thought).  All we need is a volunteer willing to do the upkeep for the wiki."

Supernatural,393kre,MsHellsing,3,Tue Jun 9 00:32:22 2015 UTC,I've been thinking the same. In the end they were never able to escape their fate of becoming vessels. Lucifer is the tricky part though. Maybe once he realizes what the mark did to him he'd want to fight back because nobody controls luci. I just hope we don't get something ridiculous like Rowena using the book to control the darkness.
Supernatural,393kre,al3xtremo,2,Tue Jun 9 04:52:32 2015 UTC,Who says Lucifer hates the darkness. Wasn't there an episode in the past about a human that missed being possessed.
Supernatural,393kre,Killer_Wolf,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:47:06 2015 UTC,"(Spoilers from season 10 included) There was an episode where ""Jeffery"" missed his demon, but that was a rather specialized case. Overall from what I've seen in the show most human's aren't thrilled they've been possessed.  That being said I think that it's possible the darkness (being amoral and destructive) might enhance that in a person. So if they were oh, the ward or possibly possessed by the darkness they might go full douche. So if Lucifer was already, as the guys would say it, a dick, then yep I could see the darkness enhancing that to a point he wouldn't want to give it up. What I'm wondering right now is if there isn't a piece of the darkness in all demons. Re-watch the episode and it seems like some demony stuff is being released.  I'm wondering how Crowley is going to feel about this new potential risk to his kingdom."
Supernatural,394o8b,DivaShane,3,Tue Jun 9 06:05:02 2015 UTC,"demons = not monsters  demons = corrupted souls  no point going to purgatory, besides that ill explain this again, theres still more than 500 seals left to break. they just needed to break 66 to open the cage, and then again the cage seems not so ""safe"" after all, any powerful being might be strong enough to open it - why they didnt? because noone is that fool to release the only guy who wants to keep the world for himself, and seems the cage is demon - proof ( as god made it that way so demons couldnt rescue him )  by now the cage must be damaged and im pretty sure it will break, anyway writters are aiming to at least 2 seasons +, so we might not be seeing lucifer and michael so soon  and they cant just ""promote"" an angel, thats not how it works ( heaven would have archangels by now to ""rule"" or keep things in ""order""), but yeah, there is more than 4 archangels we might be seeing ""retired"" archangels or the ones who were ""neutral above everything""  im betting broken cage / castiel - any other angel or maybe even Death himself will release lucifer in due time ( maybe season 11 finale )"
Supernatural,394o8b,Xetiw,2,Tue Jun 9 12:29:54 2015 UTC,"That is very interesting, I would rather see than than promoting angels as well. I never really thought about it though. Thankfully for posting!"
Supernatural,394o8b,PhalseFire,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:20:01 2015 UTC,I agree. Whether they go with this or something else I'm hoping they avoid the most predicable course of action: new or upgraded angels. I think there are other ways to go that would be new and different. You just have to be creative.
Supernatural,394o8b,The_Iron_Zeppelin,2,Tue Jun 9 06:24:11 2015 UTC,"Why would they ever in a million years free Lucifer?  Sam had to kill himself to put him away.  They would never.  Lilith is dead and gone.  She's not a monster as others have pointed out.  When a demon dies it ceases to exist, at least thats the most commonly held explanation."
Supernatural,394o8b,The_Iron_Zeppelin,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:04:27 2015 UTC,"As far as them going to free Lucifer. It's all about the greater good here. So I can certainly see a path that would lead the boys to doing that. They've both been fans of the ""we've done it before, we can do it again"" line of thinking.    I did a lot of research the other night regarding Supernatural's mythology when it comes to where demons go when they die. There are some very interesting theory's. There are a lot of folks out there that believe that demons are ""monster class"" entities so they could in theory end up in Purgatory. Several theorists use Eve as a supporting piece for their ideas.     At the end of the day though it's Supernatural. IF they want to go that route they haven't set  any thing in stone so there wouldn't be any big plot holes. I personally would rather see that then recruiting ad's for angels. Also given what Death told Dean it seems almost inevitable that Lucifer would be involved in dealing with it."
Supernatural,394o8b,D-Lowell,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:33:50 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't put them in the ""Monster Class"" at all.  If anything they are in the ""Ghost Class"".   Ghosts can't cross salt lines, neither can demons.  Ghosts can't touch Iron, neither can demons.  When a Ghosts Bones are burned the Ghost is destroyed, when a demons bones are burned it is the same effect.  There was even and episode where Bobby as a Ghost possesses a person, which we know demons do all the time.  In the episode 'Weekend at Bobby's' (I believe) Bobby even states as he's burning a demons bones that they are essentially tortured souls i.e vengeful spirits.   What we know about the 'Darkness' is that it came before people and God along with the Arc Angels fought it back.  The Darkness couldn't be destroyed, only contained in the Mark.  The Mark was initially put on Lucifer which corrupted him and was passed to Cain.  The most obvious route would be to find God who has beaten the Darkness before.    Besides all of that, Lucifer hates Humanity.  He would never help Sam and Dean, the people who put him back in his cage.  He has no reason to and Sam and Dean know that.  If they released him, he would just let the Darkness destroy the Earth and leave to another world or something."
Supernatural,394o8b,The_Iron_Zeppelin,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:03:55 2015 UTC,"For the most part I can agree with your post. I've seen the Ghost theory brought up in other places in regards to demons. I think that if we ever see God it will be the show's last season. I can't imagine where they would go from there. As far as if Lucifer would help them, seems to me that he might if they were willing to make a deal of some sort. Remember when Dean gets the express pass to the future? I thought Luci makes it clear that he loves earth and every thing on it but humans.     I think this conversation is a great example of what makes these kinds of shows so much fun to watch. You can have so many theories based off the show's own mythology. I love all the conversation and ideas going on.     Regardless of how they decide to play 11 out, I'm really hoping we get to see Sam & Dean go darkside (just for a minute) because it would be new. Yeah, we've seen Sam soulless and damn near a demon and Dean's gotten to be dark a couple of times and a full on demon. But to see them together darksiders style would be a lot of fun. Of course some one would have to save them because our boys can't be the bad guys of a season but it would be kind of fun."
Supernatural,394o8b,D-Lowell,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:39:19 2015 UTC,"About Lucifer, it's implied that his negative feelings were amplified by the mark.  Lucifer transferred the Mark to Cain. Even though Cain transferred the Mark to Dean, the Mark's dark influence on Cain did not change since Cain went on a killing spree in season 10. The ""transfer"" of the Mark is a bit like sharing the Mark among the owners.  Only Death has the power to transfer the mark completely without leaving its dark influence on the previous host.  Now that the Mark is gone, I would assume that the Mark's influence on Dean is gone too. If that's the case, would the Mark's influence on Lucifer be gone as well? Or will Lucifer still be the same villain famous for his hatred for humanity? We all saw what demon Dean was like. Even after the demon purification ritual, the Mark still pulled him towards the darkness both figuratively and literally.  Following that, it's possible that Lucifer was unknowingly working as an agent of the Darkness. After the Darkness was beaten back, the Mark was given to Lucifer by God. It's implied that there was a long stretch of time between the sealing of the Darkness and the creation of Man. Giving the Mark ample time to assert its insidious will on little Lucy. After the creation of humans, God ordered the Archangels and the angels to bow down before man.   Lucifer refused and rebelled, which led to not only his banishment from heavens but also the creation of Hell. He was the first fallen angel. Then, Lucifer created the first demon. Then, Lucifer transferred the Mark to Cain, leading to the first murderer and the first Knight of Hell.  Fast forward to 1972, where Azazel killed a bunch of nuns for a phone call to Lucy. Despite being imprisoned, Lucifer was pulling the strings that would lead to not only his freedom but the destruction of humanity.  What if the Darkness was the same way? Influencing the bearers of the Mark so it can tear down God's creations and work towards its freedom? The Mark was shown to be sentient when Dean felt drawn to the Book of the Damned. It wanted to be freed."
Supernatural,394o8b,The_Iron_Zeppelin,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:14:35 2015 UTC,"I can see your argument.  Definitely plausible, but even if the Mark's influence was ended, don't you think billions of years being locked in Hell would make someone resentful?  He's been in Hell since humankind evolved and we know that 1 year in reality  is something like 50 years in Hell.  I don't think it would be a safe decision freeing Lucifer, too much of a loose cannon."
Supernatural,394o8b,D-Lowell,1 point,Sat Jun 13 12:33:22 2015 UTC,"It can be argued that Lucifer was a loose cannon because of the Mark.  The evidence is Dean, and he was under the influence of the Mark for a much shorter time than Cain or Lucifer.  When Dean shot the kid who wanted out of the Frankenstein family (the family that was stockpiling spare body parts), Dean was convinced that killing him was necessary. Dean rationalized that by simply being a part of the Frankenstein family that the kid was cursed to be evil. That isn't what Dean without the Mark would do even on his worst day. He even beat down Cas who refused to fight back. Same with Sam during the Season finale.  The Mark is draining him of what makes him good, and Dean always had issues with his views of self-worth.   This ultimately led to his desire to die. When death wasn't an option, he was willing to let Death send him away to live forever in complete isolation. He almost went through with the decision to kill Sam so Sam couldn't bring him back. The only reason Dean didn't go through with it was that Sam refused to give up and was prepared to die. Sam didn't give up hope.   Lucifer never had that luxury. Nobody tried to help. Before the big showdown, Lucifer tried to reach out to Michael. Michael considered it but refused, calling him a monster. While he is a monster, if Sam and Dean were in the same positions, they would say ""You don't give up on family, ever."" Sam didn't give up when Dean was a demon or was influenced by the Mark.  Cain and Dean was able to resist the Mark because of love. Cain fell in love. For Dean, it was familial love."
Supernatural,394o8b,al3xtremo,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:53:18 2015 UTC,"You can't say that Lucifer didn't have love for his family.  He is even self admitted to have loved God the most.  He was even upset to have to kill Gabriel.  He hated the Pagan Gods because they are so quick to turn on each other.  His sense of Family is just as a strong as Sam and Dean's, he just really hates Humans because God loved them more than angels.   That being said, there is no way to know that the Mark leaves an after effect on the wearer.  Not sure if it was you or someone else who said Cain went on to murder people after the Mark was given to Dean, but he was only doing that to end the bloodline of murderers that he began a long time ago.  He wasn't necessarily driven by the aftereffect of the Mark, he was also a Knight of Hell which makes him prone to dark things because he is a demon."
Supernatural,394o8b,AllThingsWillEnd,2,Sat Jun 13 19:28:44 2015 UTC,"I'd say that the effects of the Mark is gone otherwise there would be no point in going through all that trouble to remove the Mark on Dean. When Dean was revived at the end of season 9, he wasn't revived as simply a demon but as the Knight of Hell.  If the effects of the Mark on Dean was gone, I would surmise that would apply to the previous users like Lucifer and Cain (if he was still alive).  Cain's killing off his ""bloodline of murderers"" is just a justification to kill, a manifestation of his negative feelings about himself and the Mark's bloodlust. Dean did the same thing when he killed the black sheep of the Frankenstein family. The kid wanted out to live a normal life. Dean didn't care. Dean believed that he was cursed as a murderer and hunter. He was convinced that the kid must be cursed as well because of the Frankenstein family.  Dean was clearly not in his right mind at that point.   What makes the effects of the Mark of Cain distinct is the need to kill and to amplify negative emotions. The bearers of the Mark have a compulsion to kill whether they want to or not. They have to kill, like someone who needs a fix except there's no detox option.  Crowley - ""The more you kill, the better you feel. The less you kill, the less better you feel.""  Demons relish in inflicting pain and having power. They take joy in committing evil but they are still in control of their own actions. Despite that, they have no such compulsions to kill. They do it when and where they want whether if it's strategic, personal or on a whim. It's in their nature. The point is, demons don't need some grand philosophical reason to commit genocide like what Cain.   This is a bit of subtle but distinct difference."

Supernatural,38yki0,Kaibakura,4,Mon Jun 8 16:14:31 2015 UTC,"I would assume that you need a fairly sizable amount of blood, not to the point of slitting your wrists, but more than you would get from exerting the same type of cut to a forearm or leg. The hand is really soft fleshed, its easy to get a bleed from, the forearm is kind of messy honestly and by the time you got enough blood on your hands/whatever you're putting blood on you'll probably have done more damage to yourself than you would have by just cutting your hand, so there is some logic to it.  And also, its very easy to stem fake blood from. Which is the more ""Show"" reason why they do it."

If they cut their arms, it'd be more awkward dripping it into a bowl or in the right spot. Perhaps just a finger? But maybe they need more than just a tiny drop. The back of the hand would have too many tendons too close to the skin. What else might be more convenient than their hands?"

Supernatural,393e37,irishwoody89,11,Mon Jun 8 23:40:18 2015 UTC,"There's no answer to this question in the show, but my head-canon is that Loki is a separate thing, god of all tricksters, and because of his trickster nature (not to mention his place in the Norse pantheon), he's always looking for some way to get ahead, so he kind of pulled a Sam; he knew that if he got an angel inside of himself, he would become much more powerful, and he felt like he was strong enough already to control any angel he invited inside. Gabriel decided to teach Loki a lesson and answered Loki's prayer, and naturally Loki wasn't strong enough to keep control of his body once Gabriel was inside. So after that point Gabriel just remained on Earth using Loki as his vessel.  It would explain why Odin and co. all thought Gabriel's vessel was Loki."

Supernatural,393e37,Killer_Wolf,3,Tue Jun 9 02:47:06 2015 UTC,"I have simpler explanation: The real Loki let Gabriel masquerade as him because he knew it would cause lots of chaos.  I think Gabriel and the real Loki both knew that Gabriel would be forced to play pranks on people, or else he would rouse suspicion. Remember that Gabriel would not choose just anyone to play tricks on. He choose only assholes. A possible explanation is the attitude ""If I have to be a dick; I might as well be a dick to other dicks"". Most of the real gods don't give enough of a shit to humans to do even that. Most gods resent humans for now ruling the earth, and hate ALL of humanity ( not just assholes). The real Loki didn't care what humans Gabriel played pranks on, as long as he played pranks"

Supernatural,38y5cx,dragonballz4,8,Sun Jun 7 21:02:47 2015 UTC,"If I can recall correctly, Kripke intended for it to be a story following Sam. How he wanted to be normal but kept getting dragged back into the 'family business'. He then realized in the end that even though he could not live the normal life he always wanted, he was able to give that to Dean in the end. He sacrificed himself so that his brother could live the life that Sam himself had wanted and, in a way, their Dad wanted for the both of them.  I think since season 5, the fanbase had such a soft spot for Dean that they've started to focus more on him. Now it is turning into the potential that Dean may have to sacrifice himself in order for Sam to have the life he's always wanted. Thus, ending his duty of keeping Sam safe and shielded from the nature of their 'family business'.  For the overall story, it's a story about two brothers who will do anything to save the other and give them a better life. There's a lot of back-and-forth and I've lost count how many times one has saved the other."
Supernatural,38y5cx,melonzipper,3,Mon Jun 8 01:56:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the actors explained that before as well, I think. It's changed a bit from the Kripke era though.   From an viewer's standpoint, seasons 1-5 are about Sam from Dean's POV. This is why the audience is closer to Dean. As a whole, from the beginning, we were closer to his emotions and reactions to everything than we were to Sam's, so most of us empathize with him more.  Post season 5 they slowly began to change and add a bit more of Sam's viewpoint on Dean's story, to the point where there was pretty much a complete turn in season 10."
Supernatural,38y5cx,vanishplusxzone,8,Tue Jun 9 14:33:26 2015 UTC,"The show is about Sam and Dean. :-)  But imho, I think people pay more attention to Dean because despite being an asshole, he's a good person who is very charming, and lets not forget, he's the more emotionally vulnerable of the two."
Supernatural,38y5cx,laurellestars,2,Sun Jun 7 23:47:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think of sam as the wayward son.  He is the one that wanted out, he is the one that sees a light at the end of the tunnel.   Dean doesnt necisarilly love the family  business, but as we have seen he can't live a normal life, I beleive sam could if he got the chance.   I think its always been fairly switching the focus back and forth."
Supernatural,38y5cx,shippdip,2,Mon Jun 8 06:06:33 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people focus on Dean because they really built sympathy for him, and the whole ""Oh he is a bad boy but he is sad and broken inside"" thing he has going (Which fangirls/fanguys really like sometimes). I do agree that he will somehow die in the end of the series, sadly. The song could be about Dean but, Sam was also there with any of the problems, they faced them together.  I would also like to note, when something causes you to dislike one of the brothers in anyway they end up evening it out (Sam's problem in like S4 and Dean's current problem in S10 is a example of this. You may have really disliked Sam's decisions but now Dean is also making bad decisions). But, I also think that without one of the brothers the whole series would crash and burn. For example, Dean's current problem (I have only seen until S10E2) would likely have no hope without Sam. Cas can only do so little and Crowley might help but since he took away what is causing it he may just leave Dean alone. Sorry for not giving details, I don't know how much you have seen. TL;DR: Both valueable characters but people have a lot of sympathy for Dean."

Supernatural,38y5cx,TXNUFO,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:54:30 2015 UTC,"That would be ironic, seeing as the show was initially intended to end with Sam dying."

That Sam was important, and that dean had to protect him no matter what, and if he couldent, he had to kill him. Just a taught of the importance of Sam in the series aswell."
Supernatural,38y5cx,mumblemania,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:08:15 2015 UTC,But it was dean's journey.Sam was intended vessel for Lucifer that is why he was 'special' but as the show has progressed ie after season 5.the importance of dean and the song has increased.For ex-lines like masquerading as a man with a reason(saving people hunting things) describes him more.
Supernatural,38y5cx,citizen_pinkdot,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:05:50 2015 UTC,"It's about them both, they each have their own character arcs that diverge and intertwine. I think if you have a favorite it might seem like the show is about them, though."
Supernatural,38y5cx,D-Lowell,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:54:05 2015 UTC,"Supernatural is about Sam AND Dean.  However, season 1-5, it did focus more on Sam, his demon blood and his insecurity about not belonging in either the hunter's world or the normal world. He wanted out of hunting but his life in the normal world was largely built on lies, he couldn't tell people about his past. He didn't want to be a freak.   After the apocalypse, the focus shifted a little more on Dean since Sam's story about his demon blood and the Demons' and Angels' plan was to make him the perfect vessel for Lucifer was essentially over or at the very least no longer the focus.  I think Season 6-10 had a little more focus on Dean and Castiel. It expanded more on their relationship in which Dean see Cas as a family and Cas has come to look toward Dean as not only a moral compass but also a brother and believes himself as the Winchester's guardian.  In season 6, Cas went down a pretty similar path to Sam. His secret dealings with Crowley and lying to Team Free Will was a betrayal, one that hurt Dean deeply since Dean refused to doubt him despite Sam and Bobby's misgivings until Dean caught him in a lie in ""The Man who would be King."" Dean warned Cas that the deal with Crowley is wrong, very much like how Dean told Sam that the ESP & demon blood is wrong.   After the whole declaring himself ""God"" fiasco in the first two ep of season 7, his actions since then has been largely of atonement. Dean was still pissed but eventually forgave him. In Cas's desperation to atone and fix things, he lost his grace and accidentally made all the angels fall from heaven.  Season 10 was mostly the aftermath of Metatron's failed scheme of becoming ""God,"" Dean's struggles with the Mark, Cas's fading grace (which was eventually restored) and the opener to the next big bad - The Darkness."

Supernatural,38scfu,Thepharcydee,2,Sun Jun 7 23:44:01 2015 UTC,The only possible mentioning of Lilith in the bible is Isaiah 34:14 which refers to a screech owl. A demonic creature worshipped in Babylon was portrayed as a screech owl but called Lilitu or something similar. It has been a while since I went super deep into demonic mythology.
Supernatural,38scfu,alterego890,6,Tue Jun 23 09:03:07 2015 UTC,We don't know how long Cain lived as a human. Could be Lilith was corrupted before Cain killed himself.
Supernatural,38scfu,funwiththoughts,2,Sat Jun 6 14:04:24 2015 UTC,"Depends on the mythology you want to follow. In some telling's Lilith was Adam's first wife. Then God created Eve as a replacement for Lilith. So it would have been a true slap in God's face to claim her soul. I would imagine that the deal he made with Cain was just another way to ""get back at Dad"".  My question is if Eve ""The Mother of All"" was/is supposed to be Adam's second wife."
Supernatural,38scfu,DivaShane,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:59:36 2015 UTC,"When I first heard about Lilith being Adam's first wife I thought the same thing about Eve, like is the mother of all monsters Adam's second wife. But, I think she only calls herself that. Unless i'm wrong she is only mentioned as the mother of monsters in lore, not Eve. I reckon she just chose that as her name, it would be pretty interesting if she is Adam's second wife though. Maybe Lucifer was able to corrupt another human, Eve before he was locked up in his cage, one last slap in God's face"
Supernatural,38scfu,DivaShane,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:16:11 2015 UTC,"Given what we do know about the story line for Cain and Able, I think it's entirely possible that Eve could be THE Eve. I'm going to queue up those episodes tomorrow and see if any one else outside of those ""in the know"" refer to her as Eve or just the Mother of All. It would make a certain amount of sense and talk about symmetry. This show really loves the idea of blood lines."
Supernatural,38scfu,ThreshPrinceEUNE,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:23:42 2015 UTC,"I am pretty sure that she is considered the first demon since, like the alphas, was the first to be created, and is referenced as the first.

Supernatural,38scfu,neoblackdragon,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:48:28 2015 UTC,Well It's very possible that there were more people on the planet. Cain may have been one of many humans.

Sam and Dean both say yes to Michael and Lucifer towards the end to push back the darkness with the other two and maybe God/chuck/the Easter bunny.

Supernatural,38opf0,alycenwonder,2,Sat Jun 6 18:12:45 2015 UTC,"My personal theory is he and Mary is buddying it up with God, watching Sam and Dean go through life. I mean, they were fated to be the Vessel's of Michael and Lucifer in the apocalypse, so they probably wanted to keep an eye on the boys throughout this troubling time, and God needed some company as his ""final plan"" went down.  The other guy, who died in Joe's bar, the really smart one, said he found out how to traverse between other people's personal heaven's but couldn't find John and Mary. One thought is that heaven is so big, has so many personal soul's heaven's, he just hasn't found them yet. But given how quickly he found Dean and Sam, I'm sure he has some way of tracking down a soul, but John and Mary's are just...missing from heaven."

Just as they are about to get past the shell shock of seeing their dad, the wall gets busted down, a giant monster comes barging in, and they get into a huge fight with it. The boys are knocked down, and the monster grabs John and runs off with him.  The boys track down the monster, who turns out to be a familiar to another powerful monster. They finally track down John and save him, but it's too late, the powerful monster already has what it need to begin the ritual to summon Cthulhu. Castiel takes a break from Cupid duties, because he is being disciplined for interfering with another Cupid's job, to help the gang for ""one last job"".  They manage to kill the monster, but the ritual is almost complete, and a rift starts to form. John, tells his boys he is proud of them, a tearful farewell is said, sacrifices his life by jumping into the rift in order to use his soul to seal it shut. His soul is now the seal that keeps Cthulhu from entering our realm. Once again, the boys mourn the loss of their father.  As they are burning his body, they sense the presence of another, as they turn around, they see Mary, their mother! Her soul wasn't in heaven or hell this entire time, and is being held captive!

Supernatural,38opf0,thomasatnip,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:14:45 2015 UTC,I think he couldn't find them because there are just so many Heavens finding certain people has to be nearly impossible.  Ash didn't even know Ellen and Jo had died when the boys went to Heaven.
Supernatural,38opf0,puglifejm,0,Sat Jun 6 00:29:24 2015 UTC,"Ellen and Jo committed suicide (well, Ellen did), so no Heaven for them (her)."
Supernatural,38opf0,vic042,17,Sat Jun 6 01:01:35 2015 UTC,"""No greater love hath man, that he lay down his life for his friends""  That's a Bible quote right there my friend.  Suicide is done for two reasons.  The first is an act of selfishness, as a cheap way to escape your terrors.  That's the kind that gets you in Hell.  But Ellen and Jo are different. Jo was dead already. Ellen stayed with her out of love. Out of respect for the boys. Out of anger to right the wrong on the planet. It would be the same as pushing someone out of harms way, knowing you will die, but knowing their purpose is much greater.  However, if you or anyone is contemplating suicide, you can call the Suicide Prevention Center at +18002738255.  Or, you can reach out to myself, or any other redditor.  We are always eager to talk.  I know you aren't feeling suicidal, but with all the talk, it's good to mention it."

Supernatural,38opf0,Gogogadgetskates,7,Sun Jun 7 15:24:34 2015 UTC,Would love to see him return just so the show can finally address the damage he inflicted upon his boys. They are so messed up and it has everything to do with their upbringing. I'd love to see a scene where they scream at him for all the hell he caused. On the flip side his 'parenting' also hardened them for the challenges they'd soon face so after flipping out on him they could thank him too. Powerful emotions around. ;_;
Supernatural,38opf0,HoboViking,2,Fri Jun 5 22:27:33 2015 UTC,"John has straight up said he wasn't perfect, and became more of drill instructor than father. But I wouldn't say any of there current issues stem from their upbringing. John raised them to protect themselves, he instilled a sense of morality in them. But also, it's not like he left Sam and Dean alone all the time, it's canon in the show that he left them with Bobby, Pastor Jim and various babysitters. And Sam and Dan have both gotten those feelings of resentment out over the years, they know John wasn't a great parent, but they also know he loved them.  And really, the family was damned from the start. If John hadn't done what he did, Sam could have been on a very different path in life."
Supernatural,38opf0,Erimenes,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:20:30 2015 UTC,"I'd say that I disagree. The way John raised his kids has a huge part in who they are as adults. As they grown up, it's less overtly obvious than it was in the previous seasons, but it's still there. But I agree on the Sam thing. I remember watching things with him come to a head (yellow eyes, lucifer) and thinking damn, the world would be totally done with if Sam hadn't been raised the way he was and hadn't known what he'd known. Can you imagine him showing up in that demon camp as clueless as some of the others? Taking in lucifer as willingly as Adam took in Michael? In that sense, John did the right thing."

It doesn't compare to a sexually abused child but child protective services seeing Dean and Sam's childhood would take them away in a heartbeat.

I love to look for subtle nuances and see if I can spot the supports that the writers used to keep the story going. If you watch closely you can see that even though they had planned to end the show after 5 you can see where they used the existing story line to propel the show beyond the original end date.  The drinking game is fun as well. Any time some one on the show drinks or talks about drinking, down a beer or shot. You may not be able to keep up any more after season 3!"

However, I'm also becoming more and more familiar with the names of the crew as the credits show in the beginning.  After being like "" oh good, another written by _______"" I decided to watch all the episodes written by a particular writer and then all the episodes by a particular director.  I'm starting with one of my fave writers, Ben Edlund.  I just went in the Super Wiki, looked up Edlund, and made a list of all the episodes he wrote.  When I'm done with those, I'll move on to another writer.  Actually the slightly OCD part of me made a database listing each ep by name, season/ep number, writer(s), and director so I can keep track of everything.  It's also color coded by season.  Not sure if I'm normal.   Anyways, you said you were looking ideas....that's mine."

Not to mention, team Free will winning everytime and God suupporting neither Heaven nor Hell but rather the Winchester ideology. I wonder if Sam and Dean are the type of humans God was referring to when he said ""humans are better than angels."" i.e free will will always allow people to choose what's right.

Anyway, Dean's amulet didn't glow because I suppose God disabled it...? But He's deefinitely Chuck. It was confirmed. It's also possible God resurrected Gabriel. Because: Think about it... God always resurrects Castiel because he sided with humanity. And Gabriel also finally sided with humaity. So maybe God also resurrected Gabriel. Or, Gabriel is smarter than Lucifer and tricked the latter into believing he's dead with reality-bending power."
Supernatural,38o3k6,ThreshPrinceEUNE,0,Sat Jun 6 04:57:00 2015 UTC,"I would love to see that, but i think showing God is the fine line that the creators can't cross.  Showing any religious figure higher than angels is probably going to cause riots and a lot of anger."

Supernatural,38o3k6,feralhog,2,Sat Jun 6 05:04:14 2015 UTC,Maybe they'll be warped into another place by God before The Darkness can kill them. Like how ''Lucifer rising'' ended in Season 4. And then in Season 5 God teleports them.
Supernatural,38o3k6,ThreshPrinceEUNE,2,Sat Jun 6 05:38:46 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be a bit surprised to see the return of Gabriel and possibly Balthazar in season 11. Death made it very clear that it took God and the Arc Angels to defeat the darkness to begin with. It is also foreseeable however that we would see the return of Lucifer in 11 as well since he is the ward of the darkness. One would think that at the end of the day Lucifer may have to curse some one else with the mark in order to regain control of the Darkness again. So then the question would be who would carry the mark? Plus how much would you love to see Lucifer (and by association) Michael released from the box after what, 400 years? They won't be exactly happy to see Sam again..."

Usually, the tablets have to do with God's word, and it includes all information, but when it comes to the darkness, God only knows a couple of things about it.  Some angels don't even know about the darkness.  I would assume some know about the darkness, but if someone like metatron himself, the scribe, would know, they would bring him back into the show, and most likely be freed in exchange for the secrets seeing as he wanted everyone to die as he told Castiel in season 10 episode 2."

For them to narrate a prophecy requires God's approval for that prophecy to come true. The only possibility is if God possesses a prophet to narrate a prophecy and then leaves him.
Supernatural,38o3k6,Saxong,2,Sat Jun 6 05:40:30 2015 UTC,"(Hi, I'm new here!) I was thinking this same thing about Chuck being God's vessel. I mean, maybe Chuck was never technically a propheteither? Hence him and Kevin co-existing.  Maybe he hasn't been God the whole time or at least not knowingly. The blackouts could have been time when God was showing him things or communicating with him? Or God was possessing him during those times. Those are just some thoughts I've had about the Chuck/God situation..."

The plot holes and inconsistencies become so glaringly obvious. Not to mention the absurd amount of retcons. Honestly. It becomes a totally different show and it is nowhere as good as its previous self.
Supernatural,38l3zx,EarthDragon2189,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:26:04 2015 UTC,"My advice is to kind of look at season 6-10 as a different chapter of Supernatural. And remember, no matter what it's still the same Sam and Dean. You'll enjoy it if you don't put crazy expectation on it. And you might be surprised how much you enjoy it. :) but if not it's understandable. I was reluctant at first too. Took me like a good year or so till I watched the new season."
Supernatural,38l3zx,argonia,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:57:23 2015 UTC,"lol, I take it you didn't like soulless Sam?   I noticed that the story became more unbelievable after season 3. Perhaps bringing angels into the series for more than one season wasn't a good idea...  For me, season 8 and 10 were pretty bad, boring as hell. Season 7 was so-so because at least Dick was a charming m.f. and made things interesting. Season 9 was awesome b/c Castiel as a human was hilarious and season 6 was good because of soulless Sam.   [If Sam and Dean were taken down a peg or two, then it would be problem solved for this show. ]  Keep in mind that every season is has quite a few gems in it, regardless of how each individual season was judged overall. If you snub every episode in seasons 6-10, you don't know what you're missing. ;-)"

Supernatural,38lc46,AllThingsWillEnd,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:47:01 2015 UTC,"well tbh i didnt remember why people used to believe so hard that chuck is god, until now, im rewatching the whole season 4-5-6 for now and you can tell chuck is no human when he vanish into thin air at the season 5 finale, as you said Cas know every name, but then again god is stronger than anything known so far he could easily rewritte his own name there.  i dont know if chuck is truly god but let me tell you something, he aint human and the way he vanish seems so... clean like he is a good being, the angel from the garden also told the boys the trinket wont burn into god's presence.  and from any point of view you can see god always knew what was happening with the boys, the way he helped them reviving Cas more than once, giving him the juice to revive Bobby.  for me it seems that in a way Chuck is god and he was testing the boys for some reason.  edit: take 5 mins off your time and watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc4npswKs48  season 5 was Kripke's ending show, so he gave us god."
Supernatural,38lc46,Xetiw,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:54:04 2015 UTC,"I've recently watched Swan Song, I do agree with you, how it looks, but still, I just don't think he is god. Rumors go now, that John is confirmed to come back for S11, and I have the theory that he infact could be God's vessel, who knows.  Besides, people didn't think that Chuck was god until that interview thing where he was asked how it felt to play god in Swan Song, if Chuck truely is god, then I must say that I am dissapointed for them giving it away just like that."
Supernatural,38lc46,Xetiw,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:02:10 2015 UTC,"the thing is... they didnt ""give it away like that"", Chuck was mean to be god from the beggining, supernatural wasnt mean to be past 5 seasons, season 5 was pretty much the series finale, the CW keep it alive because well... money...money...  Kripke gave us the peek at god because he didnt want people wondering ""who was god?"" after the serie was over ( for him, the creator of supernatural, the serie was over back then )  edit: god doesnt need a vessel afaik, he is already walking the earth! for a while now, so he must have a vessel already."
Supernatural,38lc46,funwiththoughts,2,Fri Jun 5 00:10:50 2015 UTC,"Actually Kripke said it to Rob as a joke. Chuck was an avatar for Kripke, God of the Supernatural universe. After Swan Song (which had Chuck disappearing to signify Kripke leaving as showrunner), Kripke made an offhand comment to Rob asking him how it felt to play ""God."" He never meant it in the literal sense. So while it is open for interpretation, I don't think we've seen the real God yet on this show.  I just found this comment on another thread, seems like it's a pretty good option."
Supernatural,38lc46,Petrichor02,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:13:18 2015 UTC,"Kripke also said something about writing Swan Song and thinking [paraphrased] ""when God talks, people listen. Whatever he says, that's gotta be the central message of the show"", implying that Chuck is God, since he was the one who in the intended ending gave the spiel about the importance of family."
Supernatural,38lc46,Collective82,2,Fri Jun 5 12:17:58 2015 UTC,"However, Kripke also said that God does not appear in the first half of Season 5, and Chuck does appear in three different episodes in the first half of Season 5.  So that tells us that either Chuck can't be God, that Kripke changed his mind towards the end of writing Season 5, or, like /u/ChronaMewX says, the guy in the Season 5 finale wasn't actually just Chuck himself, but was either God disguising himself as Chuck (much like how Lucifer was able to disguise himself as Jessica or how Gabriel was able to disguise himself as an old man in Mystery Spot) or God using Chuck as a vessel."

Nobody has asked to buy one before so I'll have to make an etsy account but I'll give you the info if I can put it up for sale. Also is it ok to talk about that here? I think one of the subreddit rules is no selling stuff or advertising. I don't wanna get in trouble with mods :/

Supernatural,38b94i,Glacier63,2,Wed Jun 3 21:12:12 2015 UTC,"I think this is where they're headed. With season 12 riding on the actors go ahead and Jared's recent depression, I think this will be the final season, I actually hope it is. Bringing God back and the two out of the cage would be be perfect. Remember what Lucifer said to Dean, no matter what details he alters, they'll always wind up together. Also regarding the Archangles it would be very easy ti bring Gabriel back ya know, he's the fucking trickster. And whether or not Raphael was significant it wouldn't be right not bring him back, it would shit all over the biblical lore they've set up.  That being said it with Metatron and Rowena out there it would be very tricky to tie everything up in one season, maybe a season 12 wouldn't be the worst idea."
Supernatural,38b94i,Webman992,2,Thu Jun 4 05:53:32 2015 UTC,I read somewhere though I cannot remember where that the writers of the series said it would continue as long as the ratings continued to be adequate and the actors were happy to do it.

Supernatural,38b94i,brucebwang,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:12:45 2015 UTC,I really don't believe Gabriel is dead.  There was even an interview with him where he said something like the writers leaving him up in the air like that after the Metatron episode so they could bring him back if needed

When Dean was a demon and Sam was trying to cure him,  Cas was able to hold him with only borrowed grace. So I agree WTF.

I see more that everything builds up what comes the next season. There were some weak episodes, but the weaker some episodes are, the stronger are others. An yea, sometimes you have episodes who are weekly monster like, sometimes pure story progress, ans sometimes sidestory e.g. the one where we saw bobbys usual day.  One starts saying ""Meh. After season 5 show has become crap."" And so many people just say the same. Meh."

A clean slate Castiel got mentally destroyed by the Leviathans...I can't imagine what would happen to him now. Dean probably had more control than Cas ever would, with Sam as his anchor.   Castiel is scarred from his time with Leviathans within him so I think giving him something like 'The Darkness' would just result in an even worse outcome. Dean + planet seemed like the best bet. Well, anyone + other universe."

They just focus on earth, because God's primary creation (humankind) lives there.  I honestly wouldn't be that surprised if someone like Michael was the size of Neptune.  Then again, it all depends on what plane of existence you're measuring their size in.  shrugs"

Supernatural,37zl6s,Tirain,1 point,Sun May 31 19:12:43 2015 UTC,Well that depends on what they are made of. If the angels consist of just light then they would be mass-less since we know light (photons) are mass-less.
Supernatural,37zl6s,general-meow,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:40:54 2015 UTC,i think all angels comes with different forms and sizes.   only differences are the energy that they contain and the ability to exert that energy.

Supernatural,37uznx,thomasatnip,3,Sat May 30 20:23:00 2015 UTC,"The whole ""stop after S5"" thing is because the original arc they planned out was set for 5 seasons.  Looking back through the first 5 seasons, you can see very clearly how one thing leads to another, bringing it to a logical conclusion.  It was kind of expected to end there.  But it was such a success that they kept going.  I enjoyed the series plenty after S5, but I do see that the later seasons (as great as they were) didn't quite have that clarity of purpose that the first 5 did.  There were moments when it felt like the writers were all ""shit shit, uh, what the fuck do we do now?"" Whereas in the first 5 they had a full game plan laid out already.  So go ahead and watch after Season 5!  It's good fun, and has some fantastic characters.  =]"

Supernatural was potentially going to end at season 5 so they left it with a very satisfying conclusion!  6-10, well there are good episodes but the quality of writing takes a turn for the worse and the story lines, the writers for the later seasons seem to pay no attention to early seasons or hell even shit they wrote the season prior!"
Supernatural,37uzwz,HarlyRoper23,24,Sat May 30 16:57:30 2015 UTC,"I was disappointed there wasn't 'enough' Purgatory :), Purgatory Dean was just....the best :)  I really liked the de-saturated look they gave for Purgatory in season 8.   There were lots of vampires in Purgatory, not just Leviathans. And probably other 'humanoid' monsters, it's just that Dean beheaded them before we could really tell what they were :)"
Supernatural,37uzwz,Almiel,1 point,Sat May 30 17:34:02 2015 UTC,"I would have watched an entire season of Dean, Cas, and Benny in purgatory.  Three of my favorite characters killing monsters, whats not to like?  I think the real reason purgatory didn't look amazing is because it seems like the budget for the show got slashed and they saved the special effects budget for more important moments.  I didn't count, but there seem to be a lot less special effects, dissected body parts, and non-human shaped monsters after the eighth season."
Supernatural,37uzwz,selectiverealist,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:29:23 2015 UTC,That would have been great
Supernatural,37uzwz,AllThingsWillEnd,6,Mon Jun 1 17:06:42 2015 UTC,They made Purgatory seem SO cool and then didn't show anything.  The Season Ender with Crazy Cas disappearing and then seeing all those different red eyes light up around Dean really creeped me out.  There was a lot of potential there for a Hunter to be in a world where he was the minority.  They dropped the ball on it though.
Supernatural,37uzwz,The_Iron_Zeppelin,4,Sat May 30 23:24:47 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. I thought the Purgatory flashbacks were some of the most interesting parts of season 8, but yeah total missed opportunity to bring back characters like Gordon Walker, Madison, Dean's evil dead daughter Emma, Lenore... all of them died monsters and would have been in Purgatory."
Supernatural,37uzwz,violue,4,Sun May 31 05:24:10 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda hoping they go back for the series finale. Like they have to go through purgatory to find some mcguffin to finally kill Lucifer or something along those lines, but I still haven't seen more than the first couple episodes of season 10 so I'm kinda behind."
Supernatural,37uzwz,TheSlothFather,3,Sat May 30 18:01:29 2015 UTC,It is strange that everything in purgatory once was human but was then made into a monster except for the leviathans. If purgatory is like heaven for the monsters then maybe the leviathans are like angels.
Supernatural,37uzwz,nice2guy,4,Sat May 30 22:53:47 2015 UTC,"Why were there even Leviathans there? Didn't Castiel let all of them out when he became God? Leviathans don't have souls, so you can't say that they were killed during S7, and besides, given how hard to kill they are, how many dead ones could there possibly be?"
Supernatural,37uzwz,funwiththoughts,5,Sat May 30 18:38:04 2015 UTC,Only the strongest levithans stayed inside of castiel I believe let's say a 100 or so the rest couldn't hold on type deal.

Supernatural,37uzwz,Tyranid457,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:36:03 2015 UTC,"I thought it could have been reeeeeally really interesting if they'd actually explored it more.  There was so much potential!  Do you feel hunger in Purgatory?  Thirst?  Do you need to sleep in purgatory, or does it keep you perpetually awake?  Does that drive you crazy (which happens with sleep deprivation), or does the lack of a need for sleep eliminate that as a problem?  If you're killed in Purgatory, what happens then?  Do you respawn 10 feet away 20 minutes later, or does your soul just disappear into the ether?  Does Purgatory look the same to everyone - just that dull, drab, creepy forest - or does it look different to different people?  Is Lenore in Purgatory?  Madison?  Do demons go to Purgatory when they are perma-killed, rather than exorcised?"
Supernatural,37uzwz,Proserpina,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:13:25 2015 UTC,"Purgatory looked like a pleasant, nicely maintained Vancouver park. No fallen branches, no treefall even, nicely maintained trails that you can just stroll along, nice clean little lake that Cas found (looks like good fishin!), underbrush has been cleared away... I was all ""oo, nice vacation spot!""  Battlestar Galactica had the exact same problem when they tried to film on the ""nuked"" planet of Caprica, which also lookked like... a nicely maintained Vancouver park. Both shows tried to use that desaturated grey filter to make it look different, but that just made it look like a normal cloudy Vancouver day!   The 100 has a bit of the same problem.

Supernatural,37p1z9,lukas531,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:24:37 2015 UTC,Which episode is the one where Dean wants to poke something with a stick?
Supernatural,37p1z9,pocahontas25,1 point,Sat May 30 20:36:51 2015 UTC,He one with the haunted hotel. Old lady had a stroke and he isn't sure if she's faking being completely infirm.

Supernatural,37r4u8,scottyv23,11,Fri May 29 18:52:58 2015 UTC,"Well, lately Dean has been doing more than getting kidnapped and making that face, so I guess he has been more valuable"
Supernatural,37r4u8,ChronaMewX,2,Fri May 29 22:28:50 2015 UTC,"That's true! I would assume that they update their contracts each season, and since this one dealt with the mark of Cain and Dean's overall internal struggles that does make a ton of sense. Thanks :D."
Supernatural,37r4u8,Ainzex,11,Sat May 30 03:14:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with the other comments but I also thought it was maybe because Jensen is directing some of the episodes, so he does more work, ergo more money.. I dunno."
Supernatural,37r4u8,vanishplusxzone,1 point,Fri May 29 23:48:09 2015 UTC,"I knew he directed some of the episodes from previous seasons, but I could have sworn Jensen said that he didn't want to direct any more because it was difficult and he wanted to focus on just the acting? I could just be completely remembering that wrong though. If he is that would make sense why he'd get paid more though!"
Supernatural,37r4u8,UncleTang,1 point,Sat May 30 03:19:30 2015 UTC,I think I saw either here or on /r/fandomnatural that it's been leaked/announced that Jensen will be directing again in season 11.
Supernatural,37r4u8,Kaibakura,6,Sat May 30 03:36:14 2015 UTC,"Ye gods. I'd have to work 4-5 years to make what these guys make in a single episode. Excuse me while I weep silently over my graduate degree.  But to address your question, it might have something to do with the fact that a lot of the plot-essential stuff centers around Dean and his issues. Dean seems to be the general fan favorite of the show, so he gets the plot focus, whereas Sam's story arcs have seemed to take a back seat the last few seasons. Perhaps Dean appears in more scenes/gets more screen time overall than Sam does?"
Supernatural,37r4u8,minje,1 point,Fri May 29 21:46:24 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind me asking, what degree do you have? I'm guessing social work or something similar? I don't know of many graduate degrees that lead to jobs that pay only 30k O.o.   But about your answer to my question, yeah that does make sense and that seems to be the general consensus from the other commenters as well."
Supernatural,37r4u8,vanishplusxzone,3,Sat May 30 03:17:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's because that site can't be trusted for shit.  Actually, I don't know if it can be trusted or not, but I'm certainly not going to take it as 100% accurate just because."
Supernatural,37r4u8,Gogogadgetskates,3,Mon Jun 1 05:15:05 2015 UTC,Jensen has a better agent than Jared.
Supernatural,37r4u8,TimFL,2,Mon Jun 1 16:53:54 2015 UTC,"That's strange, because they said before that Jared is technically the lead actor. Maybe that doesn't matter?"
Supernatural,37r4u8,butlerdm,2,Sat May 30 03:08:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I saw that video too where Jared was #1 on the call sheet or whatever so they could blame him for anything bad that happened (jokingly of course). But in that same video they also explain how they had to cast Sam first which is why he got that spot, so although it technically means something in the general sense, in this particular show it doesn't really carry any significance."

Supernatural,37silw,vanishplusxzone,-1,Sat May 30 13:28:18 2015 UTC,"My wife has it, one of her friends bought it for her."
Supernatural,37r3i7,ifuklittleapples,5,Fri May 29 18:44:05 2015 UTC,"Out-of-universe, I think this is mainly a budget issue. In-universe,  I've heard theories, though I don't recall if they were ever confirmed in-show, that Eve cannot create her own beings, only corrupt ones which already exist. In other words, Alphas are just corrupted humans, which explains why all monsters are humanoid. I have no clue. This is one thing that has been bugging me about the show for a long time. From what I can tell, pagan gods are monsters that get power from worship and particularly human sacrifices. God is, well, God. Pagan gods in this universe aren't really gods. They have more in common with everyday monsters than with angels or demons, so I'd assume they are creations of Eve, not Chuck/God. This is, I think, connected to 2, and again I'm not sure. It could be that it becomes like ghost possession."
Supernatural,37r3i7,funwiththoughts,3,Sat May 30 00:48:48 2015 UTC,"Pagan gods in this universe aren't really gods. They have more in common with everyday monsters than with angels or demons, so I'd assume they are creations of Eve, not Chuck/God.   Moreso I think they're just the products of people worshiping them. Kinda like a Tulpa - they came into existence because people admired the idea and put thought into it"
Supernatural,37r3i7,ChronaMewX,1 point,Sat May 30 06:05:31 2015 UTC,"So I don't think all the monsters have human bodies so much as most of them take on the form of a human so it's easier to hunt. Like a ghoul or shapeshifter. But there are other monsters like Djinns who don't really take on a human form (that is, not till season 6). So it kind of depends on their hunting technique and type of monster I think.   And I kind of think heaven/purgatory/ hell are places that just exist on a separate plane of existence than Earth. What there specific laws of existence are, idk. I mean when Dean died and went to hell he crawled from the grave he was buried in. Where as when Sam comes back from hell and Dean from purgatory it's a tad different cuz their physical bodies went too.  Now the existence of other gods and theological beings in Supernatural existing with Angels and God is an interesting thing that I've always loved. I kind of look at the other gods and beings as being like monsters but more powerful; however still weaker than Angels. I kind of think the gods really are just monsters than maybe early people on 'Supernatural Earth' saw as powerful and decided they were worth worshiping. If you look at any mythology the gods do tend to be a bit cruel anyways. Not that the Angels are much better! Lol.   Now lastly I think the whole situation of what would happen to the human vessel if you turned a demon back human is a good question! I speculate that it depends if the person is dead yet or not. If they are not dead and the soul is still there I would think they would live together??? shrugs maybe be like a split personality situation. lol. But if the soul has passed I think they would just continue living in the body like it's there's.   I'm curious what everyone else thinks!!!"
Supernatural,37r3i7,DominiqueL99,1 point,Fri May 29 23:08:05 2015 UTC,"About the last question, When a demon is cured he turns back into a human and then the body he is possessing has two souls in it. It is interesting to think what happens to the host... Most of the human souls has said that they remember being possessed that they were aware of it. So I suppose that they would fight back. Then I suppose it would depend on which soul can win? The host or the demon-turned-human with more experience on possessing."
Supernatural,37r3i7,worthycompass,0,Mon Jun 1 13:03:35 2015 UTC,"I remember a theory somewhere that the ""lesser"" gods used to rule a pre creation humanity but someone opened pandoras box and become god but simultaneously released the darkness and destroyed everything. then recreated it in his own image. Thus weakening the other gods as they no longer had the worshipers needed to give them strength"
Supernatural,37lkvp,greenteanosugar,41,Thu May 28 14:45:00 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that' really him because of the goofy ass look on that girls face. Why does that prove it's him? Because I, being a 45 year old man, would have the same goofy ass look on MY face if I ran into him....."

Supernatural,37lkvp,thecarolinelinnae,9,Thu May 28 19:22:07 2015 UTC,Weird to think she was probably like 5 years old when the show started.

Supernatural,37lkvp,Zezix,1 point,Thu May 28 21:01:28 2015 UTC,I KNEW he'd have a beard after this season.  He definitely had more stubble this year.
Supernatural,37lkvp,theDoctorAteMyBaby,4,Fri May 29 20:24:24 2015 UTC,"Idk, looks like him to me.  The wedding ring matches, and from what I can tell, so does the watch. The eyebrows seem a little off, but I think it's him."
