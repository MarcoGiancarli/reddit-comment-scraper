Besiege,3dyom2,Leopoldf,43,Mon Jul 20 16:42:18 2015 UTC,"Start your gravity turn sooner. Remember that for orbit you need to be going faster sideways then you're falling. This also makes it easier to get up on thrust vectoring alone without RCS or SAS, as you're trying to do.   Also keep in mind that SRBs are much cheaper and can give your rocket a higher thrust to weight ratio, so -  Wait a sec. None of this applies to Besiege. Dammit."
Besiege,3dyom2,TangibleLight,4,Mon Jul 20 22:12:43 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong, for Besiege that is, I wouldn't know otherwise. While there is not top limit to the skybox, you can't escape from the map without going higher than the side limits which means that even though the lander might be falling, it needs to go sideways to achieve that."

EDIT: When I leave it for a bit longer, just half a second, without any modifications on the bomb thruster, and only a bit or no thrust from the nose, this whole part of the rocket seems to recover from the explosion and while it goes slightly sideways, it remains in this position if separated at the right time."

I've been trying to find new ways to balance it, so far without much success.  All of the beams go both ways so as to not mess up the balance. The rocket itself weighs the same on every part. The problem is, it always starts to tip after launch and when, like in the gif, it goes nicely, the ""lander"" screws up and gets thrown across the map. The goal for the rocket is to get the tip out of the map and while this happens pretty often, I have to retry launching it at least five times until it works properly.  How should I change my rocket to get it balanced and tipping-free?  Thanks for your help."

Besiege,3dwb1r,Heavy_Lobster,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:20:14 2015 UTC,"torque steering   Going to nitpick here and say that isn't torque steering.  Torque steer is specifically a problem commonly found in FWD cars which causes the car to veer away from a straight path when accelerating.  There isn't really a name for the type of steering you're describing.  A couple threads have called it gyroscopic steering which I think is more accurate, but nothing's set in stone as of yet."
Besiege,3dwb1r,MaybeImDead,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:36:17 2015 UTC,"I tend to disagree as I've spent a bit of time going back and forth between this very same comparison of ""Torque"" versus ""Gyroscopic"".  So let's break these two terms down:  Torque is a measure of the turning force on an object, like how pushing or pulling the handle of a wrench connected to a nut or bolt produces a torque (turning force) that loosens or tightens the nut or bolt.  A Gyroscope is a spinning wheel or disc in which the axis of rotation is free to assume any orientation, making it useful for measuring or maintaining orientation.  Take a Monster Truck for example - when it pops a wheelie, the action of the body tilting is a counter-effect of the amount of torque being put onto the rear wheels (hence a 'torque effect', a term coined more for helicopters than anything else).  Now, take a helicopter that is trying to stabilize itself - it uses a gyroscope more as a means of calculation than an actual source of steering into a horizontal position.  So considering these things, it seems more accurate to say that this type of 'steering' is more as a result of the -effect- (torque effect) than it is the -object- (spinning wheel or disc) being used.  Therefore, I feel it is more accurate to say we're steering an aircraft using 'Torque' rather than a 'Gyroscope'.. hence 'Torque Steering'.    Though, I do realize that 'Torque Steering' has been coined as a term to describe a FWD car's tendency to veer off a straight line when accelerating... but just like how 'Torque Effect' is coined for helicopters, I don't think this should limit how we use the terms."

It's technically possible to use WASD without switching from Colemak, but it becomes (translated to qwerty) WADG, lol. Pinky on A, ring on W, middle on D, and index on G.  Not comfortable, but if it's just the camera, I guess I'll survive.  I am still looking for a solution, and if I find one, I'll post it here."

You will have to redo this every time there is an update. I can do it for you if you want me to, but i don't know whether or not it is legal to redistribute the game assemblies, and I don't have Besiege on Linux. That might not matter however, I am not sure. Could you locate the file named Assembly-UnityScript under Besiege_Data/Managed in your game directory? What type of file is it? On windows its a dll file, but it might be something else on Linux...   Edit: Assuming you have some programming knowledge, If you manage to decompile Assembly-UnityScript, theres a type called MouseOrbit. This contains a symbol named WASD(). There you can see a series of if staments that contain: Input.GetKey(""w""), Input.GetKey(""a""), Input.GetKey(""s""), Input.GetKey(""d"") (In some order). Change these to whatever you please. For the other game controls, go to the type AddPiece and the symbol Update."

Another solution is let the spike drop, then have a piston push the flamethrower down, so it times up when the spike is in the right position to the bomb."

Besiege,3dsz0x,TangibleLight,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:39:45 2015 UTC,"For most of my flyers I use arrows for moving horizontally. The left and right arrows turn the aircraft, i.e. change in which way it's pointing. Meaning they yaw the aircraft, not push it sideways.  For increasing altitude I use Numpad 0. For decreasing altitude, right control.   For land vehicles, I use arrows. Again with firing, or other key functions bound to [0], [1], [2], right control, etc. Keys that are close to the arrow keys.   I generally bind the numpad numbers (from 1 to 9) to weapons. Some of my machines have way more than 9 or 10 rounds / ammunition. Then I either start with non-numpad 1, 2, 3... or I start with [1], [2], [3] and when I'm done with numpad numbers, I switch to non-numpad numbers. If I run out both sets of numbers and still haven't bound all the machine's ammunition, then I go over to 0 - = and to the rows of keys beneath 6: YUIOP HJKL; NM,./   In almost all my machines (except one as of this writing) I use ""arrow key steering"" as opposed to ""tank style steering"". The one machine that uses tank style steering is big and bulky and not a melee/assault vehicle that needs to be agile and have ultra-precise movement. That machine's tank style steering is bound to K, for the left wheels, and L. for the right wheels.   Some of my machines / BSGs are what I call ""Battle Groups"". This means there's more than one machine in a single BSG.  For additional machines I use:   L,./    =[]\   [1][2][3][5]  [7][8][9][/]  If there's enough sub-machines, I can use the combination of these:  L,./     UHJK   9IOP  The general idea is pick the keys that make up the ""WASD"" of the machine and assign others functions to key near those.   There are exceptions in my machines. Sometimes all my keys are centered around the arrow keys and numpad area. But the machine has a function that's used infrequently or just once per simulation. Then I assign it left control or to non-numpad 1 for example.   For grabbers that should not be released, e.g. grabbers holding bombs to the top of missiles, I assign them to a key that's out of the way, e.g. ` or [*] or [-]. i usually prefer the numpad ones unless I have other keys in that vicinity then I go for the former.  Do NOT assign keys that require holding shift, e.g. ! or *, etc. For some reason, doing this cripples FPS."
