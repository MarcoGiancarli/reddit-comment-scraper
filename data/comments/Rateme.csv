Seriously though that's about all I can think of, squatting heavy weights and working on the shoulders/arms.  Your stomach looks hot toned, so why not try the rest?  You already look really good, really no other way to improve IMO other than packing on some tone elsewhere.  You're really good looking though, that stomach is hot.  I wanna do tequila shots off it."

However the eyebrows: the color is warm chestnut, and the shape is too thin and arched to suit your bone structure. Looks like you are using dipbrow or a similar product, so I would look into getting an appropriate shade and grow them out then re-shape them. Look into /r/MakeupAddiction for some excellent tutorials. Also I think darker hair really amps up your blue eyes, the light fawn brown washes you out a little."

You are legitimately one of the few girls I've seen on here who have talked about modeling who might be able to pull it off, but not high fashion or runway, which requires you to be very, very tall) unless you are, but remember, five foot ten is pretty average for runway. If you are incredibly good at it they might consider five eight. Kate Moss is one of the shortest runway models in the world, and she's five six.  You would do well at cheesecake glamour, erotic, swimwear, pretty much anything where it's mostly selling sex appeal. You have too much shape for fashion (remember: fashion models are pretty, but also usually incredibly angular, and in real life most of them are too skinny to be sexy). You also have a very wholesome look, which means you have a pretty decent edge if you are cool with being naked. If not, you still work for a number of genres. The age thing is a small issue, but not a huge one.  As to a rating: 9.23415  If you want more detail on the modeling thing, I would be happy to give you the benefit of my limited knowledge.

These pics don't show your face too clearly, which is what I rate. I honestly can't tell how pretty you are.  The only 3 pics that show your face at all are http://i.imgur.com/6rTv4Kf.jpg, http://i.imgur.com/EcNJhBg.jpg, http://i.imgur.com/QNmvWFf.jpg.  I have different standards than others do, but I think you're definitely a pretty girl to most people. You look nice, you're probably a 6.5-8.5/10 for other people.  I'd say you're a 6.5-7/10 for me personally.  I think you have a slightly long midface, nose looks a little big when you smile, slightly big chin that is pushed out when you smile and your dark eye bags are really evident when you smile.  Although at the same time you have nice large eyes, a really good smile, nice lips and a feminine head shape. So you're really attractive.

Rateme,3e11wz,df213,2,Tue Jul 21 03:46:00 2015 UTC,"You have a great body with a perfect hourglass frame that compliments your big boobs, and your face is absolutely gorgeous as well. I love your big beautiful lips, and your golden blonde hair. Your eyes are captivating and you have a great complexion. I just went through a breakup the other day if you want to talk... It's kinda depressing. I also have a rateme on here if you want to see just how depressing it is. I'd say you're a 9/10, because you have that cute blonde model vibe going on."

Rateme,3e11wz,onetruebipolarbear,0,Tue Jul 21 08:54:31 2015 UTC,"Wow you're a pretty girl. Perfect length midface, stunning shaped lips! Your chin is a little large even though I love the shape, and your eyes are slightly close set.  That third pic, the selfie is really gorgeous. In that pic I'd say you're like an 8.5/10 for many people, but for me that pic is like a 7.5/10.  In that last pic, your face seems wider at the cheekbones giving you a chubby look even though you are a slim girl. 6.5/10 for the last pic.  Depends which pic you look more like in real life. You're really pretty."

Nice small face with features closely packed together. Eyes are a bit closely spaced though. Not many rateable pics in that series.

You look best with either the full beard or no beard, somehow stubble isn't the best look for you in comparison to those.  You definitely don't look bad with the stubble though.  Would be closer to an 8-9/10 for sure if you built some muscle.  Handsome. Fav pics are 1,5,6, and 8."
