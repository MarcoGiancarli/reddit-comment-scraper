They didn't keep to themselves but played the songs a few weeks (or months) prior during a session on live television (DasErste - the state TV Station). There was a huge outcry and it was banned, but now they're allowed to play it in public.

happycrowds,3drvic,Auri1989,2,Sat Jul 18 21:24:53 2015 UTC,Serious question.  Was there a reason he kicked the ball behind his other leg like that?  Was he show-boating or was that the most efficient way to kick it on goal?
happycrowds,3drvic,TwoHundredDollarSuit,3,Sun Jul 19 01:29:32 2015 UTC,Bit of both really
happycrowds,3drvic,xOMGaShoe,4,Sun Jul 19 01:58:58 2015 UTC,"As a soccer player, it's probably mostly efficiency. He's probably much more comfortable with his right foot and considering the ball being on his left side, the keeper being off the line, and the fact that he doesn't have much time to readjust, this kick (commonly known as a ""Rabona"") is a very viable decision."
happycrowds,3drvic,takeinalready,4,Sun Jul 19 02:10:03 2015 UTC,It also has the added effect of throwing off the defenders and the goalie.
happycrowds,3drvic,__JackHoney,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:41:23 2015 UTC,Not the most difficult trick there is but it is still requires skill. It was the most efficient way with a great opportunity for show-boating.
happycrowds,3drvic,Trinidopeyaps,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:08:22 2015 UTC,"His weight was on his left foot.  In that instant reaction, he decided to use his right foot, instant of shift his weight and then swing.  Sure that doesn't take very long.  Only a single step. A single step too many regularly ruins a shot.  Happens multiple times a game when the offense takes just one step too long.  But he was trying to hit it while the goalie and both the two relevant defenders were also in a bad position.  Him shifting weight would have meant the goalie and defenders would have had been another couple yards into a better position.  In turn, this means he would have had to go for a true strike to get it past all three of them.  Requiring accuracy and power.  Requiring even more setup and even more time for the defense to prepare."

happycrowds,3dpx6r,ThatTromboneGuy,21,Sat Jul 18 08:19:59 2015 UTC,"For those wondering what is going on in the clip:  The big purple worm thing (Baron) is a neutral objective on the map that either team can try to take after the 20:00 mark in the game. Baron does a lot of damage and is very hard to kill, making it easy for the team not doing baron to jump on the team that is doing it since they will be taking lots of extra damage. Successfully killing Baron, however, will gran the team that killed it lots of special bonuses.   This situation happens and the team that was trying to do Baron gets jumped on, and most of their members die, leaving Baron open for the taking for the team that just won the fight. The team that won the fight starts attacking Baron, rightfully so since almost all of the other team is dead making retaliation impossible, in an attempt to gain a large lead.  As Baron's HP gets low, you can see one of the last remaining members (Piglet) of the team that lost the fight attempts a virtually impossible play to ""steal"" the Baron. His attempt ends up being successful, and basically turns the entire game on it's head. The reason this play is so impressive is because one of the members of the team attacking Baron has an ability that will deal 1000 damage to the Baron instantly, meaning in a perfect world, this player would be able to ""secure"" (deal the finishing blow) the Baron 100% of the time. The lone player on the team that ""stole"" the Baron doesn't have this ability, and the only ability he can use to attempt this play is one that does about 200 damage. He also had no vision of the Baron, meaning that he literally has to guess when to use his ability to try and steal Baron since he can't see what is going on.  All these things combined make this play absolutely incredible and odds-defying. Hope this explanation helped anyone that was confused!"

happycrowds,3dovsp,NJpalms,3,Sat Jul 18 06:34:42 2015 UTC,"""Je t'aime"" (I love you) is Lara Fabian's most famous hit.  When she sings it live, her fans traditionally change the lyrics to ""on t'aime"" (we love you).  This isn't the first time this happened.  She actually encouraged it by having a pause after the piano intro.  Given the emotional display, people like to invent a death or other tragedy in her life but really she's just an emotional person.  Here are two other occurrences where the same song is sung to her with all the lyrics changed to send her a message: a TV show close to her birthday and a surprise organized by fans and her band at the end of a concert in Nimes."

happycrowds,3d9bhb,jtsao41l5d3,0,Tue Jul 14 20:34:12 2015 UTC,Because their scores were tied? That seems like the only logical reason.
happycrowds,3d9bhb,jtsao41l5d3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:35:27 2015 UTC,Ah I didn't specify sorry. Nowadays I watch and they start with just 1 hole and the winner of that hole wins right away unless they tie in which case they move to another until someone is victorious.   Was wondering why this tournament they chose to play a whole 18.
happycrowds,3d9bhb,jparrish323,2,Tue Jul 14 20:45:02 2015 UTC,"This tournament (U.S. Open) is run by the UGSA while the other tournaments you see on t.v. are typically run by the PGA. Each tournament has their own rules on how to conduct a playoff, and the USGA/U.S Open like the full 18 hole playoff the best. If its still tied after the additional 18 they go to a sudden-death playoff, which I always found interesting (it actually happened to Tiger in 2008)."

happycrowds,3d1pif,wabashcannonball,12,Sun Jul 12 20:22:26 2015 UTC,"For some context: the Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals are in the same division, the National League Central, making the games they play against each other more important than against teams outside the division. Even more so, the Cardinals are currently leading the division by 3.5 games (including the game in the OP) over the Pirates, so it is important that the Pirates win the games against them.   Also, if you're not familiar with baseball, a regulation game lasts 9 innings, but this game was tied after 9 so they played extra innings until a winner could be determined. This game was won by the Pirates after 14 innings were played, 5 more than usual, and with each extra inning the atmosphere becomes more tense and each play has a greater impact.   If anyone has more questions feel free to ask! Great submission OP!"

When the video ended, I clicked on that weird round arrow thingamagig, and he just keeps catching the ball, again and again! With the exact same reactions from him and the crowd every time. It's so weird. I'll keep watching to see how many times he does it.  EDIT I can't believe this, but he's been at it for 2 hours straight.  EDIT2 OMG at about 6.5 hours he dropped it once! Wonder if he's getting tired. Will continue investigating.  EDIT3 14h. I'm starting to believe I imagined the drop. Disconcerting.  EDIT4 23h. Doesn't the sun ever set out there? It's been nearly a full day! I mean, I know it's summer and all, but Wimbledon isn't exactly far enough up north that the sun wouldn't set. ...Oh right, they must have lights at the stadium/arena/whatever. How dumb of me."

happycrowds,3cu5lt,mapex_139,3,Sat Jul 11 08:05:10 2015 UTC,It shouldn't be a big deal in baseball either. Baseballs are less than a dollar. People are stuck on this archaic idea that it's the holy grail of the game.
happycrowds,3cu5lt,Fulmersbelly,3,Sat Jul 11 17:49:45 2015 UTC,"I think it's more about what the ball represents. Anyone can buy a ball, but not that many people can say they've caught a foul ball or a home run ball that was thrown by a professional pitcher, hit by a professional batter, and wanted by many others. It's also a great reminder of that memory of that day and that situation."

happycrowds,3ck4mp,groovybrent,18,Wed Jul 8 20:26:54 2015 UTC,Cute! But the player could've/should've dealt with the bug himself.
happycrowds,3ck4mp,SagaCult,2,Wed Jul 8 22:38:31 2015 UTC,Do bugs really need to be dealt with?  Was the bug a distraction?
happycrowds,3ck4mp,Xoth_Bnug,19,Thu Jul 9 01:04:56 2015 UTC,"Short answer: In my honest opinion, yes.  Long answer, to both you and the previous comment: I don't know about you, but I wouldn't particularly enjoy a crunching sensation on the sole of my foot during explosive lateral movement. Nor would it be particularly fun to slip.  I see no problem with a professional athlete asking for a bug of this description to be removed. It's not part of his job description. It could, of course, be argued that it isn't an explicit part of the ball girl's job description either. But someone's got to do it, and I think certain athletes will handle distractions like this in different ways, as they are rightly entitled to."
happycrowds,3ck4mp,EsbenT,20,Thu Jul 9 01:14:56 2015 UTC,The bug was totally a problem and it needed to go. The grown male athlete pointing to it in complaint instead of kicking it away from him was I think unarguably sort of diva-ish.

It was funny the first time...but god damn is that unpleasant way to wake up"
happycrowds,3ck4mp,Cavemansol,0,Thu Jul 9 10:28:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly that would let the bug be an even bigger distraction. Especially in tennis where the players have to be 100% focused all the time, really what the international tennis rules do is put professional tennis players in a vacuum. They don't even have to get their own towels, a ball boy will hand one to them, they will wipe their face and hand it back to the ball boy (or girl)."

happycrowds,3bok00,Kanuck88,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:37:03 2015 UTC,"It's actually a really good system. You need to register with the festival with you details and a photo, this doesn't cost anything and this gives you a reference number for buying a ticket.  When the tickets go on sale you enter your reference on the booking page and pay a deposit, then you have to pay the balance in about 6 months time. If you pay the deposit then you are guaranteed a ticket, so not really a lottery just a stressful half hour or so when the tickets go on sale hoping you get in before they all sell out.  This system prevents touts buying up all the tickets, as the ticket has your photo on it and they won't let someone in if the photo doesnt match."

My poor mother, I think that was the moment she realized I was beyond repair. I dressed up as Spike Dudley because he was my favorite. I walked around toting a sign but I can't remember what it said. Sadly he had a broken leg. He was there and gave me his glasses. Not sure what happened to them after I moved. I'm surprisingly sad about not having his glasses anymore. They didn't have lenses in them. The dude behind me grabbed a piece of the table Vic Grimes & New Jack barely hit and chose to be kicked out with it rather than giving it up and staying.  This is a terrible comment, but it's like 3:30AM and I'm drunk so you'll just have to roll with it."
happycrowds,3bblzx,_ioftenfail,2,Tue Jun 30 07:29:23 2015 UTC,"Nah, this is a great comment. What table do you mean? Was it the one from the spot which got them injured? I don't really get that sentence"
happycrowds,3bblzx,_ioftenfail,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:42:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, the table New Jack managed to barely get his feet on and it broke. It didn't break either of their falls at all. They brawled on the outside eventually leading to that scaffolding, so most people migrated over to where they were. I didn't, mostly because it felt like a mob* and I was a kid so I wouldn't be able to see shit anyway. There was an immediate roar from the crowd like ""holy shit did they just do that?"" It was much more somber after the people that were up close relayed the information to everyone else.   ""I'm pretty sure I saw fluid leaking from New Jack's head.""  ""I think he might be dead.""  Were both things I heard.  After everyone returned to their seats and calmed down a bit security somehow found the guy sitting behind me and told him he could keep the piece of table and leave or give it to them and stay. He chose to leave; probably a good choice considering I have no recollection of any match(es) after that moment.  Watching the footage of the fall now it really seems like they both realize they've made a huge mistake and this is not going to end well. New Jack blamed Grimes and claimed that this was retaliation and he was legit trying to kill Grimes. I believe him.  *It felt like a mob in that moment but all the ECW fans I met were the nicest people. There was a guy sitting next to me at a different show who was chanting ""You fucked up"" and then apologized to me for swearing. It was adorable."

Logo of article  Human Rights Campaign:       The official logo of the HRC, adopted in 1995, consists of a yellow equals sign imposed onto a blue background. The logo was created in 1995 by design firm Stone Yamashita, who attracted then-Executive Director Elizabeth Birch to its bold design.  The previous logo used by the HRC (then known as the HRCF) featured a stylized flaming torch.  HRC uses the term Equality Flag for flags bearing their logo.   HRC shared a red version of its logo – selected because the color is synonymous with love – on social network services on March 25, 2013, and asked its supporters to do the same to show support for marriage equality in light of two marriage equality cases that were before the U.S. Supreme Court (United States v. Windsor and Hollingsworth v. Perry). The logo went viral, and Facebook saw a 120% increase in the number of profile photo changes on March 26. Celebrities such as George Takei, Beyonce, Sophia Bush, Padma Lakshmi, Martha Stewart, Macklemore, Ryan Lewis and Ellen DeGeneres shared the logo with their millions of followers on social network services and politicians like Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), and Kay Hagan (D-NC) did the same.   As the logo's popularity took off, countless memes were created. Highly recognized brands and corporations showed their support for marriage equality with creative recreations of the red HRC logo. Supporters included Bud Light, Bonobos, Fab.com, Kenneth Cole, L'Occitane en Provence, Maybelline, Absolut, Marc Jacobs International, Smirnoff, Martha Stewart Weddings, and HBO's True Blood.

The logo was created in 1995 by design firm Stone Yamashita, who attracted then-Executive Director Elizabeth Birch to its bold design.  The previous logo used by the HRC (then known as the HRCF) featured a stylized flaming torch.  HRC uses the term Equality Flag for flags bearing their logo.   HRC shared a red version of its logo – selected because the color is synonymous with love – on social network services on March 25, 2013, and asked its supporters to do the same to show support for marriage equality in light of two marriage equality cases that were before the U.S. Supreme Court (United States v. Windsor and Hollingsworth v. Perry). The logo went viral, and Facebook saw a 120% increase in the number of profile photo changes on March 26. Celebrities such as George Takei, Beyonce, Sophia Bush, Padma Lakshmi, Martha Stewart, Macklemore, Ryan Lewis and Ellen DeGeneres shared the logo with their millions of followers on social network services and politicians like Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Jay Rockefeller (D-WV), and Kay Hagan (D-NC) did the same.   As the logo's popularity took off, countless memes were created. Highly recognized brands and corporations showed their support for marriage equality with creative recreations of the red HRC logo. Supporters included Bud Light, Bonobos, Fab.com, Kenneth Cole, L'Occitane en Provence, Maybelline, Absolut, Marc Jacobs International, Smirnoff, Martha Stewart Weddings, and HBO's True Blood.

He hit the 'nick' which is the corner where the walls meet, which stops the ball dead if hit at the right angle, which is very difficult to do.

happycrowds,3a4v7t,Diamano,5,Wed Jun 17 23:17:05 2015 UTC,"Im 30 years old, If you like stories, Do yourself a favor and play FF7.  I honestly hope they change nothing but the graphics.  The story alone is worth it.  I will be buying the PC port to PS4 this summer, and I will be buying the remake when it comes out.  Also I only played 7 and 10 So I am not hardcore like some. ff7 should/will go down in video game history."

happycrowds,3a4v7t,Diamano,2,Wed Jun 17 23:29:36 2015 UTC,"yeah, the turn based can put some people off.  surprisingly this game actually showed me that turned based combat can be challenging, fun, and enjoyable.  I played South Park Stick of truth with my friend and we both liked it.  Then I told him about FF7 and he got excited for its remake."

happycrowds,3a0cbp,pyroxys007,13,Tue Jun 16 14:56:59 2015 UTC,"Shenmue when it was originally released on Dreamcast was ground breaking. The level of realism at that time was unheard of. The story was incredibly interesting and mysterious and it was one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had growing up, so yes I'm incredibly excited about the possibility of Shenmue 3."
happycrowds,3a0cbp,MrTX,3,Tue Jun 16 16:24:50 2015 UTC,Well thank you for that! Explains the reactions and also that it was well before I got into video games.
happycrowds,3a0cbp,pyroxys007,2,Tue Jun 16 16:36:17 2015 UTC,"Shenmue 2 was also on xbox which allowed people without a dreamcast (like me) to play it. I used to rent it from blockbuster a bunch, but could never get past a few button prompt sequences.  I bought the game as an adult and finally got to see a whole other city in the game that I never got to. Needless to say, it's my favorite game of all time and I cried when I saw this."
happycrowds,3a0cbp,FL00P,7,Thu Jun 18 15:41:52 2015 UTC,"Shenmue was originally planned as a grand, epic story spanning three games, so Shenmue 2 ended on a cliffhanger, setting up 3. But 3 never came, and fans have been waiting for it for 14 years now, never giving up hope."
happycrowds,3a0cbp,ChuckCarmichael,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:40:25 2015 UTC,"spanning three games   Much more than that was planned. The story was to have 16 chapters, Shenmue 1 & 2 only accounted for 6 of those chapters. It has also been confirmed that 3 will not finish the story."
happycrowds,3a0cbp,nguyen_,3,Sat Jun 20 19:09:03 2015 UTC,"If you're familiar with other facets of gaming, it's very similar to the Half-Life 3 situation. Like others said, it was an amazing, groundbreaking game, and it was sort of cutoff at the knees, and it's been about 15 years since the last installment.   Unlike Half-Life 3, which still has a lot of hope of popping up one day, Shenmue seemed totally dead. It existed on the Dreamcast, which is also a beloved console that went totally extinct, and was made, or at least published by Sega, which might as well be considered to have the same fate.   Sega, Dreamcast, 15 years - hopes for another installment to this game have been dead a long, long time. That's why the reveal is such a big deal, and also a surprise."
happycrowds,3a0cbp,merrickx,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:59:24 2015 UTC,"It was a good game. I only played Shenmue 2 and it was one of those games i couldnt just leave alone. I had to keep playing until i completed it. But to be honest, i'm not even sure i'd play part 3 even if it was available today. I dont remember it being truly epic or anything. That was a long time ago though so it might've been better than i remember."
happycrowds,3a0cbp,thascarecro,2,Tue Jun 16 19:22:07 2015 UTC,"Never heard of Shenmue so forgive the possibly stupid question, but if it were funded via Kickstarter why was it such a surprise?"
happycrowds,3a0cbp,qwertywtf,3,Tue Jun 16 18:22:59 2015 UTC,The Kickstarter was actually launched today and already met its goal of $2 million. They announced Shenmue 3 along with its Kickstarter yesterday which is why it was a surprise.
happycrowds,3a0cbp,songstion,2,Tue Jun 16 20:26:10 2015 UTC,"This was the announcement to the Kickstarter project, so it wasn't public knowledge until now."

happycrowds,3a0cbp,25032012,3,Tue Jun 16 18:00:45 2015 UTC,They work for GameTrailers. E3 has been going on the past few days and their job is to watch and commentate and the like. What you're seeing now is 3 guys (plus a few off-screen) lose all professionalism and go into completely childlike glee at the unexpected return of a game that has been demanded by fans for 14 years.
happycrowds,3a0cbp,wadewilsonmd,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:37:35 2015 UTC,"They're doing commentary of the events being streamed. They're in silence because there was about to be another reveal.

happycrowds,3a0cbp,TDuncker,-17,Tue Jun 16 13:48:40 2015 UTC,"It's one thing to be excited, but it's another for an over the top reaction like there's. It's just awkward. You can definitely see that she feels the same."
happycrowds,3a0cbp,Cratic,5,Tue Jun 16 14:15:03 2015 UTC,I'm not one bit excited over this because I've never heard of the game but it's really sad seeing someone who is that turned off by happiness because if feels awkward watching someone be so happy.
happycrowds,3a0cbp,jimjenkins,7,Tue Jun 16 18:02:26 2015 UTC,"The second guy from the right is a diehard fan of Shenmue who has been waiting patiently for 14 years, despite people saying over and over again that Shenmue 3 will never happen.  And who cares what other people think. If you're so happy you wanna jump around, then jump around."
happycrowds,3a0cbp,ChuckCarmichael,2,Tue Jun 16 17:43:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, especially at events where tens of thousands, even millions of people start jumping for joy over something that hasn't happened for more than a decade- like when dude's put kick a ball down a field and into a net, or play other, similar playground games."
happycrowds,3a0cbp,merrickx,4,Fri Jun 19 05:41:14 2015 UTC,"You can definitely see that she feels the same.    I can't. Looks like she finds it hilarious, that they're able to get so excited over it.  Yeah, it's an extreme reaction at first, I don't think anyone doubts that. Though, I don't see how that's sad.   EDIT: I can't get overly excited like this, like most people, but you also need to remember that this seems to be a show and on top of that when you sit with a group of close friends, you're more likely to react like this. If I sat home and watched the announcement of a new Starfox game, I wouldn't go crazy. If I sat and watched E3 with 5 friends and we're all Starfox fans, sure I would. Friendship really brings these elements forth.

happycrowds,39p9xj,NoLoveForCanada,20,Sat Jun 13 14:08:20 2015 UTC,"Here's a short writeup about what's going on if you're not familiar with Street Fighter (or fighting games in general).   Edit after I finished writing this: ""Short."" heh.   The title says a lot about the circumstances. This is a match in the round of 32 in the tournament bracket at EVO, an annual fighting game tournament, and the biggest tournament of its kind in the world. The combatants are Snake Eyez, playing as Zangief (widely considered the best Zangief player in the USA, and slightly-less-widely considered the best Zangief player in the world) and Xian, the guy who won EVO the year before, playing as Gen.   You can see from the life bars at the top of the screen that Zangief is losing, and he doesn't have much time left to even the life lead. Snake Eyez adopts a riskier style, using more dangerous but higher rewarding ways to approach Gen, since he must put damage on Gen or he'll lose the round, the game, and the match (it's match point) and be eliminated from the tournament. He's successful. The loose hits by Zangief to drop the life down most of the way before the very end are pretty self-explanatory - Snake Eyez manages to drop Xian's Gen down to the point where one more solid hit will even up the life totals, or maybe even put Zangief ahead.  To explain some of what everyone gets really hyped about at the end: If you pay attention to the clock at the top of the screen, the time for the round is about to run out, and when that happens, the game awards victory to the player with the most health remaining. In Street Fighter 4 every character has access to something called an Ultra Combo, which is essentially a super move that does a lot of damage. Every Ultra starts up with the screen darkening and the attacking character striking a pose and saying some intimidating sort of line. This takes about a second or two. The important part about that second or two is that the round clock continues to run while the ""Ultra flash"" is playing.  So naturally a technique called the ""timer scam"" emerged, where a player in just a situation like Xian is in (the life totals are extremely close but barely in that player's favor, and there's just a couple of seconds left on the clock) can activate his Ultra Combo and tick those last crucial seconds off the clock while the Ultra flash is playing.  Xian mistimes his timer scam by a fraction of a second. Snake Eyez is able to use one of Zangief's special moves and chase him down, inflicting just enough damage to put him in the life lead by the slimmest of margins, winning the round. Amazing match all around.  TL; DR: Match point at a big video gaming tournament. Dude playing the guy that isn't Zangief tries to stall out the clock and win, and fucks it up. Dude playing Zangief catches him fucking up and wins."

Dave Grohl fell off the stage during their second song (Monkey Wrench), due to what I assume was a random misstep. Still in possession of the mic, Dave announced that he had just broken his leg. Medics arrived shortly and carried him off the stage. The rest of the band followed him backstage but soon returned to play a few songs without him. After those few songs, MEDICS CARRY DAVE BACK ONTE THE STAGE AND PLACE HIM IN A CHAIR. They continued to play for 2 hours after that, only taking a 5 minute break for Dave to have his leg put in a cast. Apparently they wanted to take him to the hospital but he refused, insisting to ""keep playing until the doctor dragged him off the stage.""  It was absolutely amazing, what a badass."

happycrowds,3952mv,Fulmersbelly,13,Tue Jun 9 12:29:16 2015 UTC,Play the video at 0.25 speed from 7 seconds onwards. You can literally see the ball appear out of thin air on screen cause of youtube compression or the camera not picking it up so it's probably easier to see in person.  That being said if I was that guy I'd have a broken face.

What is the big deal with bare-handed catches in baseball? I appreciate them - I mean this catch was pretty cool - but from my cricket background (yes, I play cricket) the term ""bare-handed"" means without a glove.  Cricketers catch balls just as fast without gloves.  Is there something I'm missing.    Something I saw online was that the way the baseball moves in the air makes catching, say, a foul ball ""bare-handed"" extremely difficult.  I appreciate that argument.  In this particular clip the ball swerves at the end and the guy has to adjust so quickly.  In the UK, baseball is not a thing.  But I definitely would like it to be and I would like to learn more about the sport.  Cheers.  Edit 1: The reason I bring this up is because I've seen the term being used all over Reddit - particularly /r/sport"
happycrowds,3952mv,Tomwkli,4,Wed Jun 10 01:34:27 2015 UTC,For one thing this guy is not a professional athlete and caught the  ball while filming it with his other hand while tightly packed in the stands surrounded by hundreds of other people. I don't know how the fact that cricket players don't use gloves makes this video any less impressive
happycrowds,3952mv,bigmeech,2,Wed Jun 10 22:35:46 2015 UTC,100% sure he was using both hands and had a go pro on his head.
happycrowds,3952mv,NananaBedman,2,Wed Jul 1 18:29:17 2015 UTC,"I don't exactly know how a cricket ball behaves in the air, but the seams on a baseball cause it to react in extremely weird ways in the air. Top level MLB pitchers need to be able to throw a large variety of pitches to sufficiently confuse batters into missing the ball and still keep the pitch in the ""strike zone"", an invisible box in front of the batter that a pitcher needs to hit to get a strike. Here is an example of a pitch called a ""Knuckleball"", in which the pitcher is able to throw a pitch with little to no spin, allowing the seams to cause the ball to wobble threw the air, at speeds of upwards of 80 MPH. You can see the proper reaction from the batter. Some more crazy pitches that are very commonplace are ""sinkers"", in which the ball will sink to the ground just before crossing the plate; and a curveball, where the ball curves sideways as it moves. Basically, the design of the ball is intended to make it unpredictable for the batter to know where its going, the gloves that the fielders wear counteract that lack of predictability. Also when a ball is moving at that speed it hurts like fuck to catch bare handed. If you don't have proper give you could easily break your hand catching that ball.   Hope I was able to sufficiently answer you."

I thought it was a part of the sport but I guess not.
happycrowds,38uxs2,LascielCoin,10,Sun Jun 7 11:38:11 2015 UTC,"No, but also yes. Less so at the Belmont, but the Kentucky Derby (the most high profile of the Triple Crown races) generally draws a crowd who dresses up - it's part of the fun for most people. It's nothing like Royal Ascot/Derby or a garden party at the Palace; you won't find anyone in morning dress. It's a lot of young adults getting hammered drunk wearing suits and fancy hats. But you don't have to dress up, and they won't turn you away at the door for wearing jeans."

happycrowds,38jdvg,bluewolf37,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:42:15 2015 UTC,I found out more info. It appears they closed down the Broadway for five days to do an event. I now don't believe they were getting ready for d23 because after checking out all of their twitter feeds they did two performances in full makeup one day so I really doubt it was practice. No one seems to mention why or where the event was and news outlets don't seem to have any information. The only reason I believe they would do this is a VIP or several VIP's paid for a special showing. Maybe the President and his family went on a trip or some celebrities went with their family. If that is the case we either won't hear about it or won't hear about it until after the VIP's left. We also know they are back so they can be in the Tony Awards.

happycrowds,383lmn,FISH_MASTER,29,Mon Jun 1 16:41:42 2015 UTC,"HOW DIMITAR LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING AND LOVE THE SIMPLE LIFE   Dimitar Berbatov does not play football. He has not played football for four years. He has no interest in it. He is above it. Instead, he has wandered the streets of Manchester, just being Dimitar. It is more than enough. Existence is enough. Dimitar is enough. Sometimes he goes to a cafe and has a coffee. Sometimes he has a coffee and a cigarette. Sometimes he has a coffee and a cigarette and a think. Shall I have another cigarette after this cigarette, he wonders. Maybe, maybe. Should I ask the waitress to top up my coffee? Perhaps – but what is coffee? And why is waitress? There are no answers. There are no questions. So no coffee for Dimitar. Existence is enough. He lights another cigarette. Hmm, mouth's a bit dry with all this smoking, he notes. I could do with something to wash this fag down.  Dimitar is a performance artist. He is a serious man. He makes Eric Cantona look like Michael McIntyre. A couple of times during his stay in Manchester he has staged situationist happenings. On one occasion, he sauntered down a length of turf at the Old Trafford stadium and nonchalantly kicked a ball into a net against Blackeye Rovers. Another time, he hovered above the turf and guided a ball into a net against Liverpool. You would know these artistic stunts as ""goals"". Dimitar is aware they are known as ""goals"", too, but he also knows they are not goals. They are his interpretations of goals, via the medium of goals. Football fans may consider them goals if they wish, but they are pigs. To Dimitar, these goals, which are not goals, are studies of time, space, energy, humanity. They are his philosophic digressions, poems, novels. Full time score: Blackeye Rovers nil, Ekphrasis one.  But while Dimitar is reaching new levels of maturity and depth of expression in his work, he can be a bit moody, and some senior figures at Manchester United have been wondering whether he's been worth the investment. After all, for only an extra £4.5m, they could have got themselves a nice uncomplicated lad who'll smile all day if you give him a bottle of beer and pelt a ball at his head every now and then, like Liverpool did. All of which may explain why United are shovelling poor Dimitar out the door today. He was expected to go to Fiorentina in a £4m deal, but it seems he has instead decided to join Fulham, where he is having a medical right now. ""Hopefully everything is good and that means we are doing the business,"" says Fulham boss Martin Jol, impatiently rattling a box of Swan Vestas in his pocket.  On the face of it, opting for the London club over the Serie A giants seems a strange decision by Berbatov. Fiorentina are based in Florence, amid the rolling hills of Tuscany. Paintings by Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Caravaggio and Botticelli hang in the local galleries. The team wear metro$exual purple. Fulham are based in London, where people say ""gertcha"" and ""fack"", and were once owned by a comedian in a pork-pie hat. But remember: Berbatov has played under Jol before at Spurs. Also, people change. So with the big Dutch manager liking nothing more than the odd puff himself, perhaps Dimitar is looking forward to hanging out with Jol round the back of Craven Cottage after training, puffing away like schoolkids, providing they don't set any alarms off. Gertcha! chirps Dimitar, both thumbs aloft, a big, simple, Carrollesque grin plastered across his face. Fackin nice one!"

Also, in soccer/football the ball is only out if the whole ball completely crosses the line.  The ball can roll along the line and still be considered in-bounds."

Went to a few games when Sunderland last won the championship and it was amazing, better than almost anything we've had in the premier league (5 in a row and Borini's cup final goal notwithstanding). If you support a team like Arsenal you just don't fully appreciate what it feels like to finally see your team win, or grind out a draw to stay in the league. Much better than any poxy European game"

The system has a hierarchical format with promotion and relegation between leagues at different levels, allowing even the smallest club the hypothetical possibility of ultimately rising to the very top of the system. There are more than 140 individual leagues, containing more than 480 divisions.  The exact number of clubs varies from year to year as clubs join and leave leagues or fold altogether, but an estimated average of 15 clubs per division implies that more than 7,000 teams of nearly 5,300 clubs are members of a league in the English men's football league system.

At that point in time it was only a couple of years prior that they were on the verge of bankruptcy, with a string of CEO's that dragged the company closer to extinction with poor business skills and a mess of products.  In a last-ditch attempt to revive the company they got Steve from NeXT and he managed to get the company back to profitability in an insane timeframe.  That reaction's basically everyone knowing things are actually going to be okay (to say the least) for them and the company."

You can assume that the people that were with Apple at that time were big fans, they knew the history of the company and Steve Jobs. They knew the big things Apple did and why Apple was able to stay alive were almost all based on the decisions Jobs made. He was radical, he was visionary, and the people knew that. And you can see the result, no matter if you like or dislike Apple products, you have to admit that they improved the quality of products, they did stuff other people thought were impossible to do (like the iPhone).   It's so much more than a business announcement as Jobs never really was a business guy, he just knew how to convince business guys.  ok, this sounds cringy now, but it's what many Apple fans at that time believed in, and it's the reason why that announcement made them cheer.  btw. to me it seems gaga to react like that when my country won the World Cup. It just means nothing, it has no effects on our future lives whatsoever."

He's been playing there for a very long time, and is leaving to play for the Los Angeles Galaxy in Major League Soccer. The song is You'll Never Walk Alone, and is traditional to sing at the beginning of every game in memory of the 96 people who died in the Hillsborough Disaster, when the stadium was so overcrowded to watch a game that walls broke and a stampede of fans killed in droves. It is just a reminder to fans and the team that they are all there for each other.  Edit: Forgot the ""late game AT HOME"" part. Thanks, /u/geekgawd"

But because I love it so much, I cannot support winning by cheating.    When a player is tripped, their natural reaction is to put their hands on the ground to break the fall.  When they dive, they throw their hands in the air to make it more noticeable and dramatic.  Robben broke the hearts of millions of Mexico fans by capitalizing on football's archaic rules."
happycrowds,35tj4u,rolya,9,Wed May 13 15:31:43 2015 UTC,"The Mexican player stepped on his foot though, which is certainly a foul."
happycrowds,35tj4u,rellim1214,2,Thu May 14 02:08:30 2015 UTC,And their knees hit as well.
happycrowds,35tj4u,Montaron87,-2,Thu May 14 06:10:47 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right that there was contact, and that's what makes decisions like these so hard.  Fouls are subjective.    Why I have to disagree and say it was not a foul though is for the following reasons:   Robben was not in a goal scoring opportunity.  Yes he was in the box, but there's a difference between being right on the touchline (like he was) and right in front of the goal. Contact happens in soccer, and just because a defender touches you, even makes you fall, does not necessarily mean it's a foul. The biggest reason for me, is once again, Robben was not looking to stay on his feet.  He was touched and immediately resorted to diving, when he could have made an attempt to regain control.  If he had tried to stay on his feet and failed, I would probably be calling for a penalty kick too!  To me, his dive was a greater injustice than the contact the Mexico player made."
happycrowds,35tj4u,rolya,6,Thu May 14 14:08:40 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right that there was contact   He was tackled in the box and he went down. That's a penalty.  If you're a defender there you simply shouldn't put the ref in the position to have to make that judgement call. Especially if the ref already misjudged a huge foul earlier in the game which makes him more likely to give the next one (unfair as it might be).

Independence is still one of the biggest political factors in Scotland, and it was reflected in the election results yesterday.   So what happened? The SNP, a party whose aim is independence, pulled off one of the biggest electoral shifts in UK history, taking all but three seats in the House of Commons in Scotland (56 out of 59) compared to 6 last election, almost wiping out the Labour party from Scotland who has dominated it for generations.   The man getting voted out in the video was the man who planned the Labour party's entire election campaign, and yet he got beat by the now youngest lawmaker since 1667."

Regarding Scotland becoming independent, Sturgeon didn't actually bring up the idea of a second referendum by herself - she has only said that if something material were to change (leaving the EU being one example but this could include a lot of things the tories intend to implement) then she'd put another referendum in her next manifesto which people would then have to vote for.

happycrowds,35b0q1,dontsweattt,14,Sat May 9 04:31:34 2015 UTC,I believe its called an aggregate system where you play the same team twice. Once at home and one at their field. You add up the scores of both games and the winner is who has the most goals added of the two. In this case its 2-2 before the goal is scored. So the goal wins them the match.

happycrowds,35b0q1,Bwignite24,1 point,Sun May 10 02:38:56 2015 UTC,It can be a bit more exciting. Its a matter of quality over excitement. European has much more quality in their teams but a lot less parity in teams as it usually one of three teams winning the league every season. In MLS is less quality but plenty if excitement as any team has a chance to win it all.

Because it was saved, and the other team scored, they went through.

Adoption as ""national song"" of article  Vande Mataram:       Tagore's Jana Gana Mana was chosen as the National Anthem of the 1947 Republic of India. Vande Mataram was rejected [citation needed] on the grounds that Muslims, Christians, Parsis, Sikhs and others who opposed idol worship felt offended by its depiction of the nation as ""Mother Durga"", a Hindu goddess. Muslims also felt that its origin was part of Anandamatha, a novel they felt had an anti-Muslim message.  The designation as ""national song"" predates independence, dating to 1937. At this date, the Indian National Congress discussed at length the status of the song. It was pointed out then that though the first two stanzas began with an unexceptionable evocation of the beauty of the motherland, in later stanzas there are references where the motherland is likened to the Hindu goddess Durga. Therefore, INC decided to adopt only the first two stanzas as the national song.  The controversy becomes more complex in the light of Rabindranath Tagore's rejection of the song as one that would unite all communities in India. In his letter to Subhas Chandra Bose (1937), Tagore wrote:     Interesting: Flag of India | Vande Mataram (1985 film) | Anand Math   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

happycrowds,353tkn,daveyissmokin,30,Thu May 7 13:24:43 2015 UTC,Not to start a argument but I'd be genuinely interested to hear a rebuttal to his points.
happycrowds,353tkn,Gnashtaru,8,Thu May 7 13:45:55 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm sure you have heard it all before.    But as an aside I wanna say I really do think a large part of the issue is just personality type and upbringing.    I'm from a small Midwestern town, grew up hunting and plinking.  Been in the Army for 16 years, yet as I've gotten older my political views have slowly drifted more and more liberal surprisingly.  Probably due to my love of science.  But I still love guns.  Lol If I'd been born in new York and never joined the military all I'd know about guns would be from entertainment media.  I'd see shootings on TV all the time in the news and I'd probably be for gun control.    Different experiences make people different."
happycrowds,353tkn,boriswied,1 point,Thu May 7 16:57:25 2015 UTC,"I wanna say it's an impressive level of self-reflection you're displaying, but also consider if that was ones response to most disagreements. I only say this because i've fallen into that space myself before.  (This is without actually talking about gun-control, but just the issue here of attributing differences in belief to differences in personality, and generally life experiences)  If we just stick with ""oh well, different people are different"" then a thief and murderer must stay a thief and murderer.   I too was in the military and had a female name for my m96 (it's really just an m16 but this was in Denmark, blabla). There's a certain kind of attachment to a gun that only comes through with the whole ""if a higher-up sees you with the gun not in your hands or on your back you're getting destroyed"" thing.  Anyway all i'm trying to say is - i relate to everything your saying. But the premise ""we're all just different so that accounts for reasonable differences in opinion on the same matter"" might be a bit of a shabby argument."
happycrowds,353tkn,Gnashtaru,2,Fri May 8 09:46:57 2015 UTC,"Hmm I see your point.  Although with me I'm only a National Guard soldier (one weekend a month and two weeks in the summer). I did deploy in 2008 and spent most of that year in Baghdad.  But I did love guns before then.  Just not as much. I'm not saying you are wrong, I'm just saying it's probably even more complicated than your point honestly.  But I think we can both agree, being observationaly pretty reasonable people, that the media on BOTH sides is full of bullshit. For example, I'm not gunna stand here and say a large part of why I support gun rights isn't because I just love shooting and at the same time counter arguments I see often use emotion from shootings to play with our heart strings.  When in reality the whole school shooting thing is such a tiny issue comparatively.    The truth is somewhere in the middle I'm sure.  I DO think a large underlying issue is mental health.  Not just the need for better screenings, but a better environment for mental health issues and treatment.    I'm REALLY trying to avoid making arguments in favor of less gun control here so I'll stop there.  Nice to meet you BTW."

happycrowds,353tkn,IBeKai,-2,Wed May 13 21:12:58 2015 UTC,Are you referring to when he compares gun ownership to slave ownership?
happycrowds,353tkn,daveyissmokin,1 point,Thu May 14 02:58:54 2015 UTC,"No, just that using the argument that it's unfair on the well behaved gun owners isn't valid. The proliferation of assault weapons is just too risky. And it's not even a case of ""what-if"" - Sandy Hook, Columbine, Virginia Tech, Colorado. The argument for why it doesn't work has been made for us. And we surely can all agree that the NRA's solution of MORE guns is completely and utterly ridiculous. So unless  it can be reasonably argued that if that 19 year old teacher (pretty sure she was 19) at Sandy Hook had a Desert Eagle in her draw that she was going to whip out like fucking John Wayne might have resolved that situation, we have to agree that limitations of gun ownership are the only way to help prevent these massacres.   Like Jim said: it's worked a treat here in Australia"

They're not actually called assault rifles.  It's a made up term... a term made up by the gun control advocates to make rifles sound scary.  Does the AR in AR-15 stand for Assault Rifle?  No, it stands for Armalite Rifle.  It's a brand name.  Like Kleenix.  Do I keep a loaded gun in my house?  Yes.   Is there a round in the chamber? No.  Do I keep it in a safe?  Yes.  A quick draw safe that I press a handful of buttons on and it and springs open and hands me the gun.  Half a second later after I've racked the slide I'm good to go...  ""I'm not saying I have a problem with the second amendment but--"" Ssssssssssh.  Don't speak."

happycrowds,353tkn,antwilliams89,19,Thu May 7 04:33:25 2015 UTC,"No. Assault weapons is a made up term. And the term ""assault rifle"" gets wrongfully thrown around a lot.  But an assault rifle is an actual thing. Gun control advocates didn't start that term. Fucking Hitler did. And there are certain criteria that a rifle has to meet to be designated as such, and those are pretty widely accepted by manufacturers, militaries etc.   AR-15s are not assault rifles, as you said. And gun control advocates will call them 'assault weapons', to spook people. However, something like the M16 is an assault rifle."

He knows they're not.  Just because 50% of the american people hold that opinion, doesn't mean his room does. They're not somehow randomly selected. They're people going to see a specific foreign comedian who has a set of views on other topics (hell they might know his view on this too) that they probably mostly agree with. Pretty high likelihood they're gonna see eye to eye on gun control as well."

happycrowds,342v1t,mosspassion,44,Mon Apr 27 22:28:15 2015 UTC,"Alright story time: Micheal, the blonde, kid kept on harassing other kids that he ""was the best chess player in the state"" however his arrogance heightened when he boasted he'll beat Luke, the kid opposing him, in chess. No one actually cared The whole school had enough of his arrogant behaviour thus we hosted the chess event for charity and titled it UCC ultimate chess championship akin to the boxing tittle UFC. It was a $2 entry to spectate the event which also had a camera streaming the chess board on to the class projector. It was also fitted with 4 rowers of spectating stands which was just 2 tables fitted with a chair on top. This is pretty much a work safe violation. The atmosphere was pretty much ecstatic. Some of use where sarcastic, others were serious but as a whole picture we wanted to be rowdy for the sake of nothing. How we had the teachers support I have no idea Post event: we had the whole room trashed, 2 kids in a detention. Luke was given an F1 ceremony with him being baptised with champagne, a hero's triumph for slaying the beast. Transitioning to Micheal, he was pretty much grieving, suffering from the wounds Luke had inflicted mid game and from the concussion from the last finishing blow. He didn't even attend class for the rest of the day they were that traumatic: physically and mentally. As the saying goes there's a silver lining to every dark cloud, the arrogant chess master Micheal was no more (he would actually shut the f*ck up) EDIT: I'll add the post event later, in the tunnel EDIT 2 out of the tunnel EDIT 3 out of the train tunnel because there's no reception there EDIT 4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCcm0hszWfY here's a longer version it has Japanese so my asian homie can watch it too EDIT 5 My apologies for the cut, that was me running away from the teachers.

happycrowds,335m35,zero20,1 point,Mon Apr 20 07:05:18 2015 UTC,"I guess I was implying that the post wasn't clearly appropriate for the sub so should be removed. Like a good deal of submissions over the past few months, the video is just of a cheering crowd, which happens in literally every music and sporting venue for every single event. It was a clinching goal in the first round of the playoffs, which happens about 50 times in mid-April every year. Combine that with the fact that there’s a 2 minute introduction of tiny little people playing hockey with an invisible puck and also the obnoxious upside down person holding the camera, and it just seems like an irrelevant shitpost. It’s the same sort of problem that /r/contagiouslaughter has—they get dozens of videos of people who are simply laughing, which is technically what the sub is about, but is against the spirit of what makes it a fun sub to hang out in.   I wasn’t really commenting on OP or on you as a mod, just my own frustration with one of my preferred smaller subs. I should’ve just downvoted and moved on probably."
happycrowds,335m35,JamesLLL,2,Mon Apr 20 18:07:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we get these type of complaints from time to time (some combination of ""we're getting too much of X type of crowd"" and ""this isn't a unique enough crowd""; see my previous comment on this) and I generally give the same explanation (which may not apply as /r/happycrowds grows bigger and bigger). That is, I generally try to take a laissez faire approach to moderating and let upvotes/downvotes decide. The reason for this is because, as a smaller, more niche sub, we aren't exactly overflowing with submissions. I am hesitant to add rules because I'd rather have more submissions than less.  To address your specific criticisms about this video, I disagree wholeheartedly. While the 2 minute build-up can seem like too much, OP posted the specific time that the crowd began to go wild. The vantage point added a decent amount to the experience of being in a ""happy crowd."" While the experience may not be unique, not every post has to be a novel experience. However, these are just differences of opinion and we can exercise our upvoting/downvoting abilities to show whether we think it positively contributes to the subreddit.  In the broader sense, I'd love to encourage you to post more. I took a peek at your submission history and don't see any submissions to /r/happycrowds. If this post didn't meet your criteria for what is good and useful to this sub (which is of course totally fine, though I don't think your initial comment was terribly helpful, hence why I asked for clarification), then perhaps post some that DO fit what you're looking for.  Thanks for taking the time to come back and clarify. I don't think that I will be changing my moderation practices just yet as I still feel upvotes/downvotes are useful enough (I'm just a spam pruner for the most part, though I do remove particularly useless commentary). I'd love for you to stay and contribute to the sub however, but I'd certainly understand if you didn't want to.  tl;dr Instead of    the post wasn't clearly appropriate for the sub so should be removed   I just remove posts that are clearly inappropriate. Not the other way around. That said, I also disagree that this post is inappropriate for this sub."

The wrestler is named Fandango, and he has the gimmick of a ballroom dancer. His debut was not very notable, save for his theme music. The crowds LOVED his theme music. His theme music became so popular that it rose significantly on iTunes charts. A few months ago, he was rebranded as a ""new and improved"" Fandango, adopting a much more serious entrance and character, and in addition gaining new theme music. Everyone missed that original theme music that got over really well in the first place, and here he becomes a ""good guy"" again and readopts his old theme music, much to the crowd's delight"

According to Polish historian Leszek Moczulski, between 350 and 720 Poles defended a fortified line for three days against more than 40,000 Germans.  Although defeat was inevitable, the Polish defence stalled the attacking forces for three days and postponed the encirclement of Independent Operational Group Narew fighting nearby.  Eventually the tanks broke through the Polish line and eliminated all the bunkers one by one. The last bunker surrendered around midday on September 10.

Great voice, moves, amazing ability to ""feel"" music. MJ was the shit. And he started performing when he was what, eight? And didn't stop until he died, literally.   Prince might be a little better by virtue of having the talent, the skill, and knowing how to play a thousand instruments.

happycrowds,31ona7,BitingInsects,4,Wed Apr 29 08:54:44 2015 UTC,Holy crap. I had never seen that before. That's really good.
happycrowds,31ona7,natbiologist,10,Tue Apr 7 16:37:44 2015 UTC,I must be missing the point of a chant at a sporting event if this is considered shitty. What else is supposed to happen that magically makes a chant better?
happycrowds,31ona7,gordogg24p,10,Tue Apr 7 15:20:29 2015 UTC,This is a good chant
happycrowds,31ona7,cash1357,6,Tue Apr 7 15:59:20 2015 UTC,"That is definitely a good one, but I agree with /u/gordogg24p. There is nothing there that makes it inherently better than the I Believe chant."
happycrowds,31ona7,natbiologist,6,Tue Apr 7 16:35:54 2015 UTC,It's just a bit more imaginative.
happycrowds,31ona7,Joshwright111,2,Tue Apr 7 18:47:11 2015 UTC,"Not to say that's bad, but there's nothing about that to say it's any better than I Believe. The main complaint about I Believe appears to be the the lyrics, and there's nothing inherently better about the lyrics here for Crystal Palace.  You've got people participating, and I'm sure with more people than the one section in the video, it's pretty intimidating for the opposing team, but it's no different from I Believe."
happycrowds,31ona7,gordogg24p,11,Tue Apr 7 16:06:43 2015 UTC,It's miles better than I believe in my opinion but it must purely be a cultural thing. Americans seem to be about belief and hope and pride and over here we'll sing about anything from love for the team to someone eating a pie
happycrowds,31ona7,cash1357,11,Tue Apr 7 16:11:28 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm saying! Chants are all about fan participation and hype. I Believe That We Will Win deliveries on all those levels. When we were watching the World Cup at BWW, and everyone was chanting this and jumping up and down, it was one of the greatest sports moments I have ever been a part of."
happycrowds,31ona7,natbiologist,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:30:06 2015 UTC,"Seriously. I don't care if the chant is gibberish. If a couple thousand people are all participating, that shit is intimidating and energizing as hell. I Believe is great."

happycrowds,31ona7,IrrelevantGeOff,34,Tue Apr 7 13:16:12 2015 UTC,"I always that that was the dumbest chant ever.  Heard it first from the mormon college, then US Soccer.  I can't be the only American that think's it is retarded."
happycrowds,31ona7,Bief,41,Tue Apr 7 05:41:38 2015 UTC,"It's everything a chant should be. Catchy, actually means something, and it has a certain level of hope to it.  While all those other countries have a thousand or so years on us to make chants we still gotta bring up are game though."
happycrowds,31ona7,FollowThePact,6,Tue Apr 7 06:42:54 2015 UTC,"Fun fact: The chant has it's origins in Annapolis, MD, for the Naval Academy's football (american football) program.  But I think the reason some people don't care for it is because it pales in comparison to the song and chants of fan bases in England and other Euro leagues.  We'll get there one day, but the fanaticism and crowd cooperation at our sporting events just isn't anywhere near the level you find across the pond."

happycrowds,31ona7,ShowerBeer-,2,Sun Jul 12 23:28:28 2015 UTC,"Holy 3 month bump, Batman!  Anyways, I suppose I should have specified I was talking about professional sports.  The college sports traditions are strong in this country and it's really easy to get student participation and build on these traditions.  It's really difficult for these things to manifest themselves in the big 4 of professional team sports (NHL, NBA, NHL, NFL).    I think part of that may be because our professional sports have a large amount of games, so it can dilute the fandom a little bit (for NBA, Hockey and Baseball) so chanting and constant cheering is harder to catch on, unless it's the post season.  I don't think you're going to find that quiet of a soccer/football game in the UK/Europe.  That's really the only point I'm trying to make.    But I also realize, I'm probably really succumbing to selection bias.  I'm sure there's some football games over there that the fans take a breather on and just aren't loud and standing 100% of the time (standing 100% of the time is also pretty difficult to accomplish here in the states these days)."
happycrowds,31ona7,Flam5,2,Mon Jul 13 05:24:20 2015 UTC,It's not nearly as bad as that winning team losing team chant.
happycrowds,31ona7,imlost19,7,Tue Apr 7 18:55:30 2015 UTC,"As an American in Brazil during the world cup, I was always embarrassed whenever this chant started. The only thing worse is ""USA! USA! USA!"""
happycrowds,31ona7,ul49,26,Tue Apr 7 19:12:53 2015 UTC,"Don't have a problem with the ""USA! USA! USA!"" one, as you're supporting your team, such like ""Ing-gur-lund, Inggurlund,  Inggurlund"".  The ""I believe"" sounds silly, of course you think your team can win."
happycrowds,31ona7,ChetLemon,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:14:55 2015 UTC,"Ah, sorry. Should have really mixed the two chants together, I should have mentioned the broad use of ""I believe"" in American sports."

Europeans are only nationalistic every two years, during the World Cup, Euro Cup and Olympics.  Also, this is Turkey, not Europe."

happycrowds,30z74v,oldmoneey,8,Wed Apr 1 04:40:35 2015 UTC,"I kinda disagree. Aldo seemed genuinely surprised. That said I think Dana LOVED it because he loves hype, and so he let it happen. And if Aldo wants to keep his job, he's not going to hit Dana to get to Conor."
happycrowds,30z74v,Loverboy_91,2,Wed Apr 1 13:54:42 2015 UTC,That's a good point. And you'd think that if it were staged Dana would be holding Aldo back. Perhaps you're right

happycrowds,30z74v,legitwantdis,-3,Sun Jul 12 05:09:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think Conor will allow the fight to be kept on it's feet for Aldo to be effective with his kicks.  I'm unsure of the outcome, but I don't think the fight is as easy to call as you make it."
happycrowds,30z74v,legitwantdis,2,Wed Apr 1 14:13:59 2015 UTC,"Considering that Edgar and Mendez were unable to keep Aldo on the ground, I just dont see any way, and I mean ANY way that Connor is able to do it.  Connors best chance is on the feet, but thats also where he's most vulnerable. This fight is tailor made for Aldo honestly. I bet Connor dances his way around Aldo for a round, but once Aldo lands his first solid leg kick, we'll see him systematically break Connor down bit by bit. Connor just isn't a threat for a takedown."
happycrowds,30z74v,Cavemansol,-2,Wed Apr 1 14:18:37 2015 UTC,"It won't stay on the ground, but in the same it won't stay on it's feet the way many of Conor's previous UFC fights have been. Yhr reason I think that is because he knows that Aldo is too strong on his feet. As you say, he'll be vulnerable on his feet.  Looking at his UFC fights, you would think that he's weak on the ground, but that's just because we haven't seen it — not that he's been bad at it. So I think there will be a lot more ground work.   Aldo's kicking won't be enough though, he needs to be adaptive and I haven't seen enough of that from Aldo to make it a clear decision. Also, McGregor's punching is underestimated, and if Aldo tries to keep it on feet, then he could be caught out too."
happycrowds,30z74v,legitwantdis,1 point,Wed Apr 1 14:43:09 2015 UTC,Aldo is more dangerous to McGregor on the ground than on the feet. McGregor is barely a brown belt and Aldo is a high level black belt.
happycrowds,30z74v,j1202,1 point,Wed Apr 1 17:58:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe I just prefer seeing Aldo on his feet as I think that's when he's best.  I really can't say how McGregor will do on the ground, but I think he's going to be a lot stronger than people think."
happycrowds,30z74v,legitwantdis,1 point,Wed Apr 1 18:56:17 2015 UTC,"While that may be a valid reaction (I don't follow UFC, so I'm not sure of the larger context), I'd like to generally keep it civil in here. I'm not speaking to just you necessarily, but in general to the way this thread went below.  As I've said in some earlier posts, I allow a few posts that show a unified crowd, even if it can be disturbing when you know the context.

However, the tone you took from the beginning was antagonistic and well, you got your fight below.

happycrowds,30z74v,j1202,0,Wed Apr 1 01:08:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah because his mouth beat every guy the UFC put in front of him and got him to be a 2 weight-class champion in the biggest MMA organisation in Europe...  I'm not saying he didn't have an easy ride from the UFC. He absolutely did, but the fact is he still completely outclassed everyone he faced. He is a good fighter. and he poses as much of a threat to Aldo as any other 145lb contender has."

happycrowds,30l1u7,TheGroomOfTheStool,25,Sat Mar 28 09:52:59 2015 UTC,"This is harder to put into words than I thought it would be.  Unlike athletes in many other sports, pitchers have fixed positions in the field.  Every play starts from the exact same spot and the ball is thrown to the exact same target.  The result of this is that a pitcher performs the exact same action literally thousands of times.  It is inevitable that they develop a routine, which eventually becomes so ingrained that they must adhere to it in order to perform.  Occasionally some players, like the one in the video, will have a routine that's a little odd.  It's just a matter of doing whatever they have to do to feel comfortable in preparation for the next pitch."

I'm sure it wouldn't have taken a great deal more effort to secretly find some fans who are getting married then approach the parents on the quiet about doing a free gig at the wedding (so long as the footage could be used in a music video).  They wouldn't strictly be 'crashing' the wedding, but it would have at been as legit as it could have been.  Granted, it would have taken more time to organize and shoot, but having legit reactions and not having to outright lie to the fans would have made it worth it IMO.    EDIT: The lying I'm talking about...   It felt good to kind of surprise these people and make them happy.   I had no idea I would be affected by the overwhelming reactions we received from the couples and guests.

Immediately after moderate forces have been applied to the brainstem, the forearms are held flexed or extended (typically into the air) for a period lasting up to several seconds after the impact. The fencing response is often observed during athletic competition involving contact, such as American football, hockey, rugby and martial arts. It is used as an overt indicator of injury force magnitude and midbrain localization to aid in injury identification and classification for events including, but not limited to, on-field and/or bystander observations of sports-related head injuries.     Image i - Schematic illustration of the fencing response during a knockout. A The individual receives a punch to the head. B After the traumatic blow to the head, the unconscious individual immediately exhibits arm extension on the same side of the body as the site that received the blow and arm flexion on the opposite side while falling to the ground. C During prostration, the rigidity of the extended and flexed arms is retained for several seconds as flaccidity gradually returns.

happycrowds,2zu7vs,nicetl,8,Sat Mar 21 20:39:06 2015 UTC,"Man this brings back memories.  Muscle Museum was the first song off Showbiz that radio stations played, I was in middle school and remember being completely in love with the song.  I recorded it onto a tape using headphones plugged in to the microphone slot and putting the earpiece up to the speaker.  I finally found the album at Tower Records and it was only $9.99.  I don't so much like their newer stuff but man can they put on a show and it's nice seeing this song finally get some love."

happycrowds,2zu7vs,object_on_my_desk,3,Sun Mar 22 06:30:02 2015 UTC,Probably just because their discography has become so massive since then. They're about to release their 7th album so the oldest songs get lost among all the new hits these days.

Some are so bad they're just boring (Sharknado, Sharknado 2, Shrek 4), but then you get these gems with the few lines that are gold.  Something I never understood about Troll 2- the whole point is the town is actually called Goblin right?

Apparently the producers called it Troll 2 so that people would think it was a sequel to the kinda popular Troll '1', which actually is about a Troll, came out four years earlier and features two characters called Harry Potter. Ironically Troll 2 is much more well known now.  My favourite weird scene in Troll 2 is the one where the kid stands up and pisses on dinner because he can't think of any other way to stop his hungry family from eating the food the goblins have left out.   Followed by his dad taking him up the stairs, throwing him on to bed (""You can't piss on hospitality!"") and then, as the dad put his hands on his own belt, the kid asks, terrified: ""What are you going to do to me, dad?"" and the dad proceeds to tighten his belt ""for hunger pains"".

Sex tape of article  Tulisa %28singer%29:       In March 2012, a 6-minute sex tape of Contostavlos and her former lover Justin Edwards emerged on the internet.  Contostavlos was granted an injunction (Contostavlos v Mendahun) that legally blocks the distribution of the tape.  The injunction prohibits anyone from using, publishing, communicating or disclosing all or any part of the film to any other person.    Simon Cowell stated that the scandal would not affect her job on The X Factor. In the aftermath she later recorded a video response in which she clarified the relationship on her YouTube account ""Tulisaconto"",   and stated that she was both heartbroken and devastated by Justin Edwards' release of the video.    In July 2012, she settled a legal action against Edwards, who apologised for releasing the tape.  Her lawyer is still pursuing action against Edwards' former manager Chris Herbert, who has had his job as a consultant on The X Factor suspended.      Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Fellow non-Brits, if you're in a position to get to London in early- to mid-September (in whatever year), I'd highly recommend that you get your ass to Mars to the Last Night of the Proms.    The singalong portions of the Last Night are quality /r/happycrowds material every year.  The only other singalong from the 2014 Last Night that BBC has posted on YouTube is ""Land of Hope and Glory"", which is a mainstay of the show along with ""Rule, Britannia!,"" ""Jerusalem,"" and a crowd-led rendition of ""Auld Lang Syne."""
happycrowds,2yvk90,megagnome5000,3,Fri Mar 13 15:40:47 2015 UTC,How did you go about getting tickets?
happycrowds,2yvk90,Joshwright111,3,Mon Mar 16 20:30:28 2015 UTC,"I sat in line for the upper gallery for about six hours before the concert and paid £5 for a ticket.    There are two ways to get tickets:    1) Buying in advance: Tickets go on sale for the entire Proms season in May (I think), and you can buy a guaranteed ticket for the Last Night if you buy tickets to at least six other Proms concerts.  My understanding is that this gets you an actual seat for the concert. 2) Promming: About 500 standing (""promming"") tickets are available on the day of the Last Night for £5 each.  The Royal Albert Hall has two areas for prommers: the floor and the upper gallery.  The floor is where the perennial Last Night prommers stand and arguably where the life of the party is for the concert, so that line gets long pretty fast.  The line for the upper gallery is generally shorter, but the good spots on the rails upstairs fill up quickly and slowpokes will end up with a heavily obstructed view of the concert.  I opted for the upper gallery to give myself a better shot at getting in."

I saw this and a few other comments and decided to go into more detail.   But this is all about an up and coming band finding their rhythm in a new country thanks to a crowd that appreciates good musicianship."
happycrowds,2xjso9,MLBfreek35,2,Sun Mar 1 22:33:48 2015 UTC,"Bruce is the shit, and this is an awesome video, but /r/happycrowds is about crowds cheering their asses off on camera :-w  Post this in /r/music and you have my upvote :-)"
happycrowds,2xjso9,MLBfreek35,-1,Mon Mar 2 04:19:23 2015 UTC,"that's where I'm torn...    /r/music is just the worst.  The crowd isn't the best thing about this video, per se. But it's the crowd that makes Bruce great. I think it's a great example of what happens when the artist and the crowd sync up.  On that note, Bruce wasn't at the peak level yet, he was still an American anomaly. For them to kick in on the early parts with the claps seems like a response to the band being good more than the band being a favorite.  Listening again, I realize that I posted this after hearing this version for years. I have picked up things from 50+ listens. And the stuff is subtle.  For the subtle parts, it's just that he didn't have the preacher persona, he only mutters the ""For Pete"" part to start the song. Older Bruce would have told a story about how the music of London shaped his life, but on this, he only pays a small homage to a hero.  It might be just me after 20 years of being a Springsteen fan, but what I take away from this is the crowd. He and the band were as tight musically as they could be... but the secret to a great live show isn't just the band. This rendition remains my favorite version of the song, almost rendering the recording seem like an early draft.  I keep thinking its the moment, and it's the crowd that pushes him there."
happycrowds,2xjso9,MLBfreek35,2,Mon Mar 2 04:50:56 2015 UTC,"I feel like I appreciate the role of the crowd a lot more after reading your points, but I like to hear a cheer or a chant when I come to this sub :-)  BTW, sorry if my first comment came off a bit harsh :-/"

I realized I internalized so much of the experience to a point it took a moment to explain why it was so great to me, and that not everyone has heard it.   So, for sticking around, I'll give you my other favorite recording of his:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBOMXBbQnw4  There is a story in the middle of the song where he ends with one of the all time greatest rock performance lines I've ever heard.   I heard this before I ever heard the album version of ""Growing Up"" and it ruined it for me.   Tonight, you's are both just gonna have to settle for rock and roll."

happycrowds,2wt77o,Legaladvice420,15,Mon Feb 23 07:34:17 2015 UTC,"Actually the greatest call in the history of sports broadcasts.. Cemented, forever, in history."
happycrowds,2wt77o,83alx,3,Mon Feb 23 17:03:18 2015 UTC,"I dunno...""the band is on the field"" is right up there. It may not have been a national spectacle at the time, but I think ""the play"" is as good a call as this one."
happycrowds,2wt77o,Cavemansol,11,Mon Feb 23 17:26:08 2015 UTC,"Nah, that one's good, but it's no miracle. You have to remember that those are too college teams, and the miracle on ice was college kids who bested the USSR back when the USSR was THE definition of a hockey team. No one beat them. They always won. Until the USA pulled out the miracle on ice.  Plus, that line at the end, ""Do you believe in miracles?"" adequately summed up just about everything the US thought of their hockey team at that point."
happycrowds,2wt77o,Legaladvice420,3,Mon Feb 23 18:14:58 2015 UTC,"I believe /u/Cavemansol was referring to the play commentary itself as being great, and not The Play as rivaling the ""Miracle,"" and I'd have to agree with them.

happycrowds,2wt77o,redcat39,6,Mon Feb 23 18:20:22 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree. There's all kinds of emotion and a great call being made there, but I think the simplicity and perfectly timed delivery really makes the Miracle on Ice call.

happycrowds,2wt77o,Cavemansol,12,Mon Feb 23 19:25:12 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite sports moments.  It was interesting to hear the Russians players' points of view on the 30 for 30 documentary, Of Miracles and Men, and the juxtaposition of this event with their perspective on the NHL players.  They played up the us-vs-them amongst themselves that they played a superior game to the Canadian professionals who made so much more money than them.  Indeed, they proved their point in the exhibition games they played against the NHL pros.  Then, having proven their point, they go and get beat by a group of amateur college players.  Brilliant."

These playoff games are played over two legs, giving both teams the opportunity to play at home. Leicester (the team in blue) won the first leg 1-0, hence why the aggregate score is 3-2 (as the score in this game was 3-1).  Winning this game allowed Watford to play against Crystal Palace for the opportunity to be promoted to the Premier League the following season. To save a penalty (twice), get the ball up the pitch, and score, in these kind of circumstances is pretty special. If you'd like to read more here's a Wikilink."
happycrowds,2w7a6c,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Feb 18 04:41:56 2015 UTC,"Football League Championship play-offs:       The Football League Championship play-offs are a series of playoff matches contested by the teams finishing from 3rd to 6th in the Football League Championship table. The semi-finals are played over two legs, with 3rd playing 6th and 4th playing 5th, with the return fixtures following. The final is played at Wembley Stadium, although from 2001 to 2006, it was played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff while Wembley was being rebuilt.  The first playoffs at this level were contested in 1987, when it was the Football League Second Division. From 1993 to 2004, following the creation of the FA Premier League as a breakaway from the Football League, it became the Division One playoffs, and since 2005 has taken its current name as the Championship playoffs following a rebranding of the remaining three divisions of the Football League.  There is no single sporting event in the world more valuable to the winners,  who end up approximately £60m better off than the losers, mainly due to the increased commercial television revenue from being promoted to the Premier League.  However, by convention the two finalists agree that the loser will keep all the gate receipts from the game, so as to slightly soften the financial blow of missing out.

happycrowds,2vxfbe,Rzy,1 point,Thu Mar 12 04:15:16 2015 UTC,yea at first the insurance company that would have paid for it said he stepped over the line (when the video was posted) but then the man who owns the actual car dealership honored the deal himself so he got the car.

I remember watching Nico perform ""No Rain"" and her voice sounds a lot like her father's, it's insane.

This, of course, threatened to destroy the stadium, and it had to be reinforced after the concert."

This song was a huge 'crowd' favorite (there was never a crowd until now): 'New Noise'. This is the first time the NY crowd got to hear it during their reunion tour.

happycrowds,2vl87v,LaqOfInterest,9,Thu Feb 12 02:30:10 2015 UTC,"Nah, the Wembly event was last year in June, I believe.  The ward kill cheering started in October 2012 at the season 2 World Championship during an unbelievably absurd series between CLG.EU and World Elite that lasted for days due to technical problems.  CLG EU (wickd/snoopeh/froggen/yellowpete/krepo, before they split into EG and Alliance, if you weren't aware) was known for playing lots of games that ran extremely long.  Also, Oracles Elixir was an effect that lasted until death back then, so you could clear an unlimited # of wards for a 400g elixir if you didn't die.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqdv1QX6kNg  There is a video of all the ward kills in one of the games.  Around the 2:50 mark in that montage, when the game is almost an hour old with only one inhib turret down, you start hearing the cheering, and jatt/deman commenting on it."

happycrowds,2uwtev,ModelHX,9,Fri Feb 6 03:34:56 2015 UTC,"That's an incredibly comprehensive write up so I don't mean to diminish it, but for anyone looking for a briefer explanation here's an explanation I posted a couple weeks back:   [I'm not SF expert but] the way it was described to me. Chun Li has charged up her ""super"" bar and pulls off her super combo. With the amount of health Daigo (Ken) had left, a single hit from it would have ended the round. Rather than accepting his inevitable defeat Daigo pulls off the impossible - he counter blocks every single strike in Chun Li's long ass combo - as stated, requiring him to block at the precise time of each strike and in the correct direction. BUT this isn't all. Clearly memorising Chun Li's super combo he knows to jump for her last upper kick and blocks it in mid air. He then uses his position of now himself having a full super bar to transition into his own combo which he uses to strip Chun Li's much fuller health bar. This was the final move to win him the tournament. <-- I've since learned that isn't true. I believe it was just the semi-finals.   It is truly one of the greatest moments in gaming. I still get full body frisson every time I watch this."
happycrowds,2uwtev,taboo_,7,Fri Feb 6 06:48:26 2015 UTC,"Of note here, it's not just precise timing that you need to pull this off, in order to parry the first hit of chun's super you have to input the parry motion before the super even starts. After the animation starts it's too late to parry."

However, because they threw an interception (defensive team now gets posession of the ball) the patriots were then up by those 4 points and all they had to do was run the clock out.   Essenstially, Seattle was about to win the game but instead they turned the ball over (threw an interception) which allowed the Patriots to win.

Cleveland was to blown away by having a winning Indians team for the first time in decades. I'd never actually even heard about this.
