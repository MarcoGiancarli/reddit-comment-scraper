wikipedia,3dykk7,mgraunk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:28:42 2015 UTC,"Sorry about the late reply.  I have psychedelic experiences in the high two digits, and up until a few years ago still was apprehensive about DMT, as it is the most powerful hallucinogenic compound as of now.    I meditated for a few days, spoke with a few religious friends (I'm agnostic/atheist),  then did a few test runs to get the dosage correct and acclimate myself to the substance.  Then the day I did it, I cleared out an entire room and sat on on a towel in the center looking out the balcony, immediately after smoking it all the walls went pure white and the blue carpet extended into an infinite plane then vibrated into pure white, I went blind and couldn't see with my eyes open.  I quickly loss the sense of gravity then saw my body vanish.  I couldn't see or feel anything.  After that I passed out, then woke up in a completely different area, it felt like the vastness of space and that my point of existence was no longer a point but a large area of questionable size.  It was at this point I was sure I died, but before I did I felt a large lurch and my mind came back to tell me I fucked all my family and friends over, then I accepted it and had ego death, the rest is a mess of colors, spaces and an assortment of noises, it felt like what a planet might feel across light years.  I slowly started to hear familiar noises and then my vision finally can back, I was lying back down to the floor and couldn't form thoughts coherently.  After that I realized that this body is only temporary and that I am only in a part of a large kaleidoscope of elements mixing together infinitely forever.  I realized that regardless if there is god or none, we are eternally changing states in this universe. That really scares me because I realized that nothing I do now will matter really, there is no point to whatever anyone does, ever really, even the planets existing  doesn't really ""do"" anything significant.  But I got over this because it was too depressing to deal with, and what is the point of there being no point."

wikipedia,3dykk7,irobeth,3,Mon Jul 20 20:29:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you say, but just to piggyback off the subject you're bringing up; don't you think that the reverence you show in all your behavior surrounding and preparing for the drug and the trip is at least as important to what the drug is actually doing to you, in terms of the experience having an impact on your life?  Obviously people take these psychedelic drugs most of the time without the purpose of having spiritual experiences, but just to have an interesting or fun drug experience(or often just a 'wasted' or dissociated experience). The drugs will often have thought-alterations and 'spiritual' kinds of effects on the user anyway that are pretty innate to the psychedelic experience, but these kinds of usages don't go into the experience with personal goals to discover things to alter themselves or their perspectives.  The culture that surrounds the use of psychedelics from tribal culture to the early-LSD-era trip guiding and set and setting catering naturally has a strong inclination to pair the spiritual elements with 'religious' behaviors of reverence, which has the effect of the user giving/granting the trip even more authority over their life and causing them to respect it more.  So to me what you describe is the most tool-like, introspective and receptive way to get the absolute most out of any psychedelic experience. But I think it has to be realized that what you're describing is voluntary in a similar way to that you have to be willing to allow yourself to be hypnotized is voluntary, or that the more firmly you believe in a religion the more likely you are to experience an elevated state of abandon and complete belief during a religious ceremony.  tl;dr I was kind of just musing on the topic, but my point overall is that a person isn't necessarily doing a psychedelic drug the wrong way if they don't want to go into the experience with the goal of being open to a life-altering experience. And also: I wonder how much ritualistic experiences of any kind that allow different rules to significantly alter our behaviors, even for a short period of time like a drug experience, can have the effect of causing long-term perspective and behavioral changes just by allowing us to break behavioral patterns and modes any person may be set in in their life; the bigger factor may be their willingness to alter themselves and commit to alterations, and the biggest factor of that may be the strength of their belief in the power of the ritual in the first place."
wikipedia,3dykk7,Gardenfarm,2,Tue Jul 21 03:54:50 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind the experience is driven off your existing thought process at the lowest level. It's more complicated than that; but abstractly, the brain is a living feedback loop  I think they're what you make them, and that a prepared and mystical setting yields the more profound and mystical results. When people take them on a whim or in a social setting you get different results, and some are better for certain settings than others (I wouldn't consider DMT a party drug for example, and I wouldn't consider 2C-B a go-to for ++++ rebirthings)"

I've never had a psychedelic experience that was all fun and games, they all had their dark and difficult parts.

wikipedia,3dykk7,jenbanim,2,Mon Jul 20 21:20:48 2015 UTC,"You are correct, you definitely need a babysitter the first time.  I would prioritize a close friend above someone that knows psychedelics, but both would be better.  I say this because you want someone that knows you through and through.  Also, you will almost always experience some level of fear, but it was only after a ""bad"" trip that I realized that fear is an important component of our existence, so I embrace those bad trips now as well.  You shouldn't aim to only have euphoric and beautiful trips, this essentially creates an artificial bias to how life should work out.  I also would try and start with a rather low dose of mushrooms instead of lsd, as lsd lasts a good 12 hours.  You want to ease your way into psychedelics. It took me 5 years of regular use to get to DMT, which still left me heavily depressed for a year after.  Finally, MAKE SURE YOUR TRIP SETTING IS EXTREMELY comfortable, I cannot stress this enough, no parents or gf, no friends that don't know, no concert etc. You also don't want to force it into a weekend with work soon because any even tiny level of stress can easily explode into a full blown bad trip. So I advise an empty weekend, at home alone with your trip sitter.  Also don't try to immediately do a camping trip or something as some people can handle it, others can't (and since you talked about being nervous, I would advise you to go the comfy and safe route).  Message me if you have any other questions, stay safe :)"

Some people find meditating beforehand helps, some people prefer a sitter, while some prefer being alone.  If you take the substances and you are already in a bad place, you are much more likely to have a bad time. If you are someone who prefers company to being alone, I would suggest a sitter.

Have a sitter, someone you trust fully and who's tripped before. Someone who's experienced in psychedelics. If you are having a bad time, you need someone there who isn't going to freak out and make shit worse. Start with low doses. Sometimes it takes a while to kick in. Don't assume the drug isn't working. Be in a safe place, like your house. I've found it helpful to make sure things are clean, too, because I develop a strange attention to detail. Have water and blankets around. Have a light snack before hand, as eating will probably be impossible and/or you simply won't notice that you're hungry. If you're really worried about it, have some kind of benzo handy. But be sure not to take any like a week or two prior to the trip, as this will diminish your subjective experience."

Went... uhoh and held on for the ride.  Long story short, reality dissapeared, I went somewhere else, saw it (Him, god, all powerful light being, whatever you want to call it) 'conversed' with it. Then saw many multiple dimensions, where all of time, the past the present and future was rolled up in a little ball, saw every moment ever from creation to destruction all in a flash. Became one with the universe if you will... realized we are just the universe experiencing itself.  Just a small taste of the nuttiness that went one.  When I came down and out of the trip, I quit drinking, I quit smoking shortly after, pretty much became 100 sober. And other than caffeine and a joint every few months, I still am.  The person who went into that trip, was not the person who came out.  Oh... also by the time I had come down, I was lost in the Mojave desert, alone, with no water and becoming hypothermic.

The album includes the controversial ""Pull My Strings"" which was played only once on March 25, 1980, when Dead Kennedys were invited to perform at the Bay Area Music Awards in front of music industry bigwigs to give the event some ""new wave credibility"". The band spent the day of the show practicing ""California Über Alles"", the song they were asked to play. In typically subversive, perverse style, the band became the talking point of the ceremony when after about 15 seconds into the song Jello Biafra said, ""Hold it! We've gotta prove that we're adults now. We're not a punk rock band, we're a new wave band.""  The band, who all wore white shirts with a big, black S painted on the front, pulled black ties from around the backs of their necks to form a dollar sign, then started playing ""Pull My Strings"", a satirical attack on the ethics of the mainstream music industry. The song also referenced The Knack's biggest New Wave hit, ""My Sharona"". The song was never recorded in the studio but this performance, the first and only time the song was ever performed, was included on the album.

I.e. none of them literally look like the structure that's diffracting them. X-rays are fired at something, that something diffracts them and a photographic plate picks up the diffracted interference pattern in one particular plane. You then have to use knowledge of how waves behave, maths and the wavelength of the original x-rays to work out what the pattern you see tells you about internal structure of the things that diffracted the X-rays  It's similar to how the diffraction pattern you get from a double slit experiment doesn't look like double slits, but from knowing how waves behave you can backtrack and work out it was a double slit that made the pattern.  Or (slightly) similar to how a chequered moire pattern doesn't look like the circular objects that made it  edit: although I suppose when you think about it the interference pattern from a double slit does look like slits, so the only jump required is realising they are only two slits. And if you zoomed in and only saw a small portion of the chequered part of the moire pattern you would see ever so slight curvature so you would be able to reason that it originates from something circular. And I guess that is the same with the interference pattern on the DNA photo. The X shape the dots/slits make originate from a helix, which looks kind of like an X in profile. More careful examination of the photo would result in a realisation that some of the dots in the X shape are duplicates (twice more than there should be to someone that already knows some of what DNA has in it, but not the shape) so you can know there's a double helix"

wikipedia,3dq9yu,Derkek,3,Sat Jul 18 21:54:31 2015 UTC,"Sooper spooki  I was very interested with the related article - The Hum - where people hear hums in their city. In one case, two hums were investigated in a town. I downloaded the paper because it's fascinating.    Daimler Chrysler Casting Plant – A facility engineer gave Jim Cowan a tour of the plant. After climbing onto the roof of the building closest to East Boulevard, they found a source of the 36 Hz tone heard in the community to be a cooling tower mounted on the roof of Building C. Figure 9 shows spectra monitored 10 feet from the cooling tower and in the community approximately 1000 feet to the north of the cooling tower at the corner of Dogwood Drive and Appletree Lane. As can be seen in Figure 9, the 36 Hz tone is present at both locations and the dropoff of roughly 40 dB is as expected over the 1000- foot distance from the source. Although operational considerations prohibited us from having the cooling tower turned off to see whether or not the 36 Hz tone disappeared, the 36 Hz sound levels clearly increased as we approached the cooling tower and dropped off as we walked away from it in all directions, indicating to us that it was the source of the 36 Hz tone. Haynes International – The plant engineering manager gave Jim Cowan a tour of the entire facility, during which time specific pieces of equipment were monitored. A source of the 10 Hz tone monitored in the communities was found to be an air compressor intake on Building R1 (on the northern end of the facility). We found three of these intakes on the R1 building, one on the east side and two on the west side, each emitting the same spectral (tonal) characteristics. Figure 10 shows a spectrum monitored 10 feet from the equipment, superimposed with a spectrum monitored at the western property line at Belmont Avenue (approximately 200 feet to the west of the equipment) and a spectrum monitored at a residence at the southern end of Briar Court (approximately 3000 feet to the north of the equipment).   That's just so cool. Man, now I'm deep in the rabbit hole of urban exploration and em radiation"

It's a 1:99 ratio.  If the water decreases to 98%, then the solids account for 2% of the weight. The 2:98 ratio reduces to 1:49. Since the solids still weigh 1 lb, the water must weigh 49 lbs."

The second ratio, 98%, is 98% of the potatoes with less water. It's not the same type of potatoes, so you can't say it's 1% less (less of what ? of the original potatoes ? of the potatoes with less water ?)    Let's take water only instead of potatoes. You have water with, obviously, 100% humidity. Then you ""substract 1%"" and get water with 99% humidity... this is impossible. Unless you consider the small quantity of dust in the water. For this small quantity of dust to be 99% humid, you have to let it dry and remove all your water but one drop."

The reason they were made to exist as separate states in the first place was just primarily because France and the west didn't want Hungary or a revived Austria-Hungary to be a competitor against France in the European continent.  A true multiethnic state, or at least true multiethnic states, could have been achieved, instead classic imperialistic divide and control tactics and politics gave rise to the nation-state system that so hurt Central Europe's geopolitical, cultural, and economic strength. Central Europeans have much much more in common with each other than they would ever realize, I wouldn't mind calling the sabotage of that spirit a western European ""conspiracy"" (which can be a too strong word many a times, but not totally inaccurate IMO) even. At least it definitely benefited interests in France and the west at the expense of Central Europeans.  A few decades later, Central Europe was at each other's throats due to the alienation these divide and control geopolitics caused. And not long shortly afterwards, mass deportations from all these countries, of all ethnic groups, made innocent families and citizens leave the lands they've known as home for hundreds of years.  Sickening. Yet Still Central Europeans are at each other's throats, at least in spirit in many ways. Long gone are the days when peasants could great each of their neighbors in a different language.  Not that during Austria-Hungary didn't actively favor Hungarians and Germans, but society and people are open to change and progress and understanding. That possibility was denied to the region and history by the victorious allies.  If only people could realize that no, their nation-state is not their friend, neither is the east nor west, nor the EU nor the UN nor anything else. We have this common region on earth connected by ecology and geography and history and economics. Unfortunately the chances of people taking joint ownership of the region is slim to none."

If instead I picked an example company that makes 75 cents revenue per monthly user and then estimated the same $1.00 he does, am I now being optimistic with the same result?  And where does the 100M operating costs number come from?  If your estimate is based on a pessimistic view of ""what if we were like NYT"" then shouldn't you base this estimate on NYT's operating costs, since those are costs they incurred to gain the profits you pretended to be comparing intelligently?  And then we switch to saying, well, maybe the market won't like us as well as google (another anchor), let's be pessimistic and call ourselves yahoo.  Well okay, if you hadn't mentioned Google I wouldn't have had a clue if Wikipedia would do better in the stock market than Yahoo but now that you mentioned Google I'm meant to believe it's a pessimistic view to think Wikipedia would only do as well as Yahoo.  You could probably pick any target estimation you want and come up with an estimation like this that sounds appealing but has no underlying logic expressed.   If you wanted a much larger result you could start by anchoring to Google at the outset, their revenue per user is in the 40-50 dollar range so you could be pessimistic and say $15."

An open market does not create an accurate valuation in private equity, and even with publicly traded companies, we all know stock prices are loaded with bullshit.

You can make surprisingly accurate estimates from little data just by a general understanding of a situation and making many assumptions. What I mean by this is if he, off the top of his head, thinks his operating costs will be a ballpark number (a best guess based on data at hand), thinks his revenue per user will be a ballpark number, etc... If he does this enough and does the necessary calculations with his estimates he will probably give a decent approximation.  Because Wikipedia is unique, Jimmy Wales has to pick and choose aspects of Wikipedia which are comparable to other sites, meaning in order to get this evaluation he will have to pull a lot of data from a lot of places. Also, by diversifying where he pulls data from, he actually increases the accuracy of his fermi calculation. If he did everything according to one company, everything would be dependent on few assumption. If he compares his company to many different companies that do (in some way or another) similar things/are in a similar situation, then he will most likely get a large number of both over and underestimates which will likely center in on a decent approximate company value."
wikipedia,3d2ixz,poop-in-the-tub,3,Mon Jul 13 13:18:16 2015 UTC,"The reason operational costs should be tied to the revenue estimate is because they are not independent, there is a direct causal link.  But anyway, to do a fermi calculation here you want to look at the distribution of these numbers among companies that are similar in some way to Wikipedia, because the numbers vary wildly.  Fermi estimations do a good job of getting you in the right order of magnitude... but revenue per user can vary by orders of magnitude by itself, so picking a single example instead of looking at a distribution may be misleading.  (And it is possible the examples picked were because they are actually representative, but if so that information was not presented.)"

Do we care if Wikipedia is worth 200 million or 2 billion? Yes. The variance of Wales' estimate is not only unquantified but huge. The approximation he's done is quite misleading.  Part of that is anchoring on some of the best performing peers and ignoring the ones doing poorly. Even Yahoo is a successful, large corporation with a market cap of 40 billion. Comparing Wikipedia to either Yahoo or Google is silly because they play in completely different leagues offering completely different products.   I'm a decision quality professional and I see people do poor estimation like this all the time. Perhaps Jimmy has better reasons for these numbers and simply didn't bother to explain his reasoning.

wikipedia,3d2ixz,Titanosaurus,0,Mon Jul 13 05:14:30 2015 UTC,"How the fuck is NYT earning $3.54 per monthly visitor? That must involve some very hefty subscription revenue because no web advertising business I've ever seen performs at that level.   In my experience, $3.54 per 1000 page views is a relatively lucrative but realistic monetization rate for a good website. If you're earning that kind of ad revenue you're doing okay. $1 is sort of baseline. If you start a blog and plug in Goole ads that's probably what you'll get. Premium sites earn $10 per 1000 pageviews but that is difficult to get. You need a recognizable brand name, high traffic volume, and an excellent sales strategy to perform at that level.  But all that is dollars per 1000 pageviews.  So I'm shocked to hear $3.54 per monthly visitor. Are NYT's average users consuming 1000 pageviews? I doubt it. This is why I say that the number must include some kind of subscription revenue. And even then, I'm pretty amazed they've made that work so well. In terms of $ per 1000 pageviews or CPM, the New York Times must be off the charts.  I think to take that as some kind of baseline and say, ""well, let's say we do comparably to them, okay less because we have more international traffic...""  That's just bullshit. Wikipedia doesn't have the NYT's sales apparatus. They haven't developed a subscriber base. They don't have a paper version that they can do advertising tie-ins with. Video content is helpful for advertising, which is why NYT has a video section. Wikipedia does not. It's a completely different beast.

So 80 percent should be close.   The problems:  1) I think it's fair to say that 80% of the overall company's digital revenue is being earned by NYTimes.com, although I'd have stuck with 70%. That knocks it down to a bit less than $150m.  2) The NYT is probably including a lot of subscription dollars into that number, perhaps as much as a half. Let's call it $75m from ads.  That knocks the ARPU to $1.56. (For what it's worth, that's pretty close to where HuffPo and the Guardian are.)    Continuing Wales' analysis, though, I think he ends up in the right place. Cut the ARPU to $0.50 to account for the non-US traffic and revenue per year is $250m. The question becomes the expense side of things, and my guess is that you run it at way, way under $200m. Right now, the Foundation runs on spending of about $20m to $25m, and there's really no need to increase that except for ad sales. His $100m number was fair at worst. And second, the P/E Ratio you get is going to be higher if you're a ""technology"" company than a ""media"" company, and the lower your expenses are, the better chance you have at being considered a tech company.   As a result, I think Wikipedia comes in at $150m in net revenue, and at a P/E ratio of around 10, give or take. That gives it a market cap $1.5 billion or so."

I think that's the clearest one: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox#Batting_averages  Justice beat Jeter both years but has a lower average when the years are added up. But look closely: Justice had 411 at bats during his year with the lowest average, and only 140 in his high year, so the average of the two years is weighted toward the lower year's average. Jeter was the opposite (more at bats in the year with the higher individual average). The disparity in at bats skews the data.  If you don't get baseball, imagine you are taking a class where all of the 30 homework assignments are 10% of the final grade and the 3 exams are 90%. Say your friend, who is a giant dick, constantly rubs it in your face that he got a better grade than you on every homework assignment. However, you beat him on each of the 3 exams. Because of the weighting, there is no way that your friend will end up with a better final grade in the class, so he can suck it."
wikipedia,3cyy50,dbbo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:34:23 2015 UTC,"The homework / exam situation is not really an example of Simpson's paradox. If you beat him on the highly weighted exams, it is not at all counter-intuitive that you get the higher overall score. It's really only a ""paradox"" if you manage to get a higher grade in the class even though your friend beats you at every assignment. Let me suggest a more applicable (if more far-fetched) grading example:  You and your friend both take the same course at different times. He takes it the first semester, and you take it the second. The course has two exams, exam A and exam B. Exam A is notoriously difficult, and exam B is notoriously easy. Your friend beats you on both exams - you score a 50% on exam A, while he scores a 55%, and you score a 95% on exam B while he scores a 98%. From those percentages, it should be obvious that your friend got a higher grade in the class than you did. The piece of information missing from those percentages is the relative weighting of those exams. Let's say that after so many students failed the first semester due mostly to poor grades on exam A, the professor chose to increase the weight of exam B to compensate. Let's say the weighting went from 50-50 to 70-30 in favor of exam B. Now the final grades are:  You:    30*0.50 + 70*0.95 = 81.5 Friend: 50*0.55 + 50*0.98 = 76.5   So you come out on top despite having scored lower than your friend on both exams."

wikipedia,3cvx0k,smellycoat,33,Sat Jul 11 23:12:19 2015 UTC,"outgoing, extremely friendly, and disinhibited, as well as ""somewhat coquettish"" (playfully flirtatious) and having an abnormally high desire and tendency to approach others   She sounds fun!"
wikipedia,3cvx0k,archemedes_rex,3,Sat Jul 11 10:55:12 2015 UTC,"I want to find a woman like this and ask her to take me on an adventure.  I might die, but it would probably be worth it."
wikipedia,3cvx0k,SnakeDanger,19,Sat Jul 11 22:43:00 2015 UTC,"Very interesting, however I can't help but think that she must have more problems than the article describes.  The amygdala is used in memory formation, without it I think she would have trouble learning, and not just fear cues."
wikipedia,3cvx0k,tanadrin,24,Sat Jul 11 11:30:39 2015 UTC,"Invisibilia had an episode in part about this woman; they even interviewed her. Aside from the issues noted in the article, she seemed entirely normal, of normal intelligence, etc."

wikipedia,3cvx0k,JorusC,13,Sat Jul 11 18:37:42 2015 UTC,"Is it weird that this sounds like my dream woman? I have a somewhat low fear response, and it would be refreshing to be around someone else like that.  We'd probably get each other killed."

wikipedia,3cvx0k,dbbo,6,Sat Jul 11 13:10:41 2015 UTC,"People with damage to the amygdalae but with an intact prefrontal cortex wouldn't ""feel"" fear, but they would still be able to reason through a situation to determine if it was dangerous.  However, brain imaging studies on antisocial people (AKA 'sociopaths' or 'psychopaths') show that they often have lower activity in the prefrontal cortex compared to normal individuals, so they might actually not identify something as risky or dangerous that others would.  It's probably worth mentioning that it's not just a matter of brain structure (nature) but upbringing (nurture) has a large influence as well, since ASPD is largely defined by behavior. There are people who have ""antisocial genes/traits"" who are brought up in a good home and ultimately lead fairly normal lives, except they tend to gravitate toward ""adrenaline junkie"" type careers/pastimes (fighter pilots, race car drivers, skydivers, etc.), whereas those brought up in abusive environments will usually drift in and out of prison for various crimes throughout their adult lives."
wikipedia,3cvx0k,Gramidconet,6,Sat Jul 11 16:00:39 2015 UTC,I like the way it opens and sounds like an SCP article.
wikipedia,3cvx0k,argv_minus_one,4,Sat Jul 11 13:27:20 2015 UTC,"Fascinating. Perhaps fear and sadness are obsolete in modern society, and should be engineered out of us somehow. Or at least weakened."
wikipedia,3cvx0k,jld2k6,11,Sat Jul 11 09:23:43 2015 UTC,"In her personal life, S.M. has been the victim of numerous acts of crime and traumatic and life-threatening encounters. She has been held up at both knifepoint and gunpoint, was almost killed in a domestic violence incident, and has received explicit death threats on multiple occasions. Despite the life-threatening nature of many of these situations however, S.M. did not exhibit any signs of desperation, urgency, or other behavioral responses that would normally be associated with such incidences. The disproportionate number of traumatic events in S.M.'s life has been attributed to a combination of her living in a dangerous area filled with poverty, crime, and drugs, and to a marked impairment on her part of detecting looming threats in her environment and learning to steer clear of potentially dangerous situations. S.M. herself has never been convicted of a crime.[3][14]  Sounds like there's a reason this hasn't evolved. She seems to completely lack the skills needed to keep herself out of dangerous situations. The human race probably wouldn't have survived as a species if we all had that trait. Imagine trying to predict things like global warming and getting ourselves out of dangerous situations. If we don't even feel we are in danger we would have a hard time getting the human race as a whole to work together. It's already hard enough to do this stuff with the fear and anxiety."
wikipedia,3cvx0k,sobri909,4,Sat Jul 11 15:44:34 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that we're gradually evolving them out anyway. Not completely, because they're still highly beneficial. But lack of fear would have been a quick path to death in certain situations 10kya, while now most people could live full lives without needing much fear response."
wikipedia,3cvx0k,frowniehandface,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:54:20 2015 UTC,There was a radiolab featuring her. It was really interesting.
wikipedia,3cvx0k,kadmylos,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:00:45 2015 UTC,Is she blind and does she have super sensory abilities?
wikipedia,3cvx0k,username_redacted,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:28:26 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how she has ""hyper-empathy"" if she can't detect negative emotion in other people. Kind of seems like a contradiction."
