I lowered mine by 50 points, played that for a week, another 50, etc. You'll feel a small drop in skill level but it's easy to adjust.  If you're running without the regen device, run with a regen implant. That allows you to carry C4 to destroy MAXes and tanks if you need to. Plus throw it over the side of a building on a group of enemies for the lols.  Also, running with your knife out is no faster than running with your primary out. Best to keep your rifle ready in case there is a random enemy that runs around a corner.  If you hold your movement keys before you hit accept on a revive, you'll basically teleport a couple of meters, which is good if you are near a corner.  That's basically me nitpicking, your game seems pretty good."

I've actually been meaning to cert into C4 to try it out especially for the lols, but I've been filling out some gaps in my other classes to fill certain roles. Namely the stupidly expensive Utility Pouch on Engy for some AV mine spammy goodness. But I'll be certing into C4 soon to see how I like it.   Also, running with your knife out is no faster than running with your primary out. Best to keep your rifle ready in case there is a random enemy that runs around a corner.

EmeraldPS2,3e2ic6,piecesofpizza,-1,Wed Jul 22 00:25:44 2015 UTC,"Your CQC game is pretty solid, mid range could use some work. I know people like to try to force the bubble but I'd honestly recommend sticking with the self heal with Nanoweave. Bursts are a bit too long and you could use some sensitivity tuning(which is probably why your mid/long is lacking). Once you get accustomed to 5-7 shot bursting(depending on the gun) your ACC will increase noticeably.   Posting your DPI/sens for ADS/HIP would be beneficial if you are looking for solid info on how to change to improve. Sens is very much to ""each his own"" so don't feel pressured to change your to fit someone else's, there are some tweaking tips that are universal though."
EmeraldPS2,3e2ic6,Autoxidation,2,Wed Jul 22 00:25:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the ranged is a bit wonky. I notice I twitch a lot when trying to make fine adjustments and can never get the crosshair centered on someone at range. I'll definitely look into messing around with my sensitivity.  I'll have to check my exact DPI when I get home from work, but I use a Logitech G300 (I'm a lefty, so I need an ambidextrous mouse and my lefty DeathAdder broke ages ago) on the default DPI which I believe is 800. ADS is 0.54 and Hip is 0.63 in-game. I'll measure my 360° rate when I get home as well.  I'm 3 days in on the Terminus and I love it, but its ROF is so much faster than the NS11A that I was using before it, so definitely need to get the burst down. I was wondering how many shots per burst to be most effective, so I'll try your suggestion and see how it goes.  I'll probably go back to the heal once I finish the directive for shield (as it's easier to get for some reason than the healing portion).  Thanks for the feedback!"
EmeraldPS2,3e2ic6,Kestah,2,Tue Jul 21 15:32:56 2015 UTC,I too am a lefty with an ambidextrous mouse.  If you are looking for a new mouse get the EVGA TORQ X5 optical.  Best sensor on the market and very comfortable.
EmeraldPS2,3e2ic6,Kestah,2,Tue Jul 21 15:47:32 2015 UTC,"Funny you post this as soon my mouse breaks (left click somehow lost the clicky bit)! I'm on Amazon right now and was about to overnight another lefty DeathAdder. I'll look into the EVGA now though. Thanks! And nice timing!  Edit: Just pulled the trigger on the X5. No overnight available, which is good since it means I can study tomorrow instead of excitedly playing with a new toy. But for now I'll have to wrestle with the Naga in a futile attempt to aim for the next couple of days."
EmeraldPS2,3e2ic6,iSchwak,0,Tue Jul 21 21:14:38 2015 UTC,"Ya if you are running 800 DPI at .54/.63 that's insanely high. If your hip feels comfortable with being able to aim straight at a target before you ADS(turning around and zeroing in) then keep that, since you are having trouble making 30% your ADS is pretty clearly too high, lower it bit by bit over the next week, you'll see an improvement guaranteed."

EmeraldPS2,3dukdr,Wobberjockey,7,Sun Jul 19 16:54:38 2015 UTC,"Let's see:  I rarely use it, because if you are getting conced you probably already fucked up somewhere else along the road.    My shift dpi is 3200 v/s my normal 800.  Under no circumstances whatsoever should you vary your dpi from session to session.  Using it when you get conced (again you should not frequently be getting conced) is one thing.  But always go back to your baseline DPI as soon as you are no longer conced, otherwise bye bye muscle memory.  Also, if you are talking about additional accuracy from having a higher DPI  , it is better to run at the native dpi, which I believe is any interval of 50 in this case, visi would know better.    Bottom line:  It is a tool with a very particular niche; it's not mandatory to use it, and honestly you probably won't be missing out on much, at least in terms of infantry play, if you don't use it."
EmeraldPS2,3dukdr,Hypers0nic,3,Sun Jul 19 17:11:30 2015 UTC,"I actually mapped that button to my mumble PTT.  I will occasionally downshift my DPI for engineer turrets or vehicle secondaries, also shredder gunning.  Otherwise I just leave everything at my set DPI (sorry I don't have numbers atm) -   It's a good mouse, just find a sensitivity/DPI you are most comfortable with and stick there."

EmeraldPS2,3dukdr,PurelyGumbo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:36:21 2015 UTC,Regular DPI: 450  Switched DPI: 6400  Use it when I get conc'd and in special circumstances while flying(mostly evading and attempting to snap around when RM after they messed with the ESF)  Don't use it in combat.  If you feel the need to use it normally it probably means your regular sens isnt right.
EmeraldPS2,3dukdr,EagleEyeFoley,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:48:16 2015 UTC,"If you're already kinda used to switching your sens while flying try using 2x zoom on the Needler. Adjust it until it feels like it pitchs at the same speed with low sens + no zoom and high sens + 2x zoom. It makes aiming easier up to pretty close ranges, should work for memorizing muzzle speeds."
EmeraldPS2,3dukdr,stroff,0,Mon Jul 20 06:42:35 2015 UTC,I don't use a DPI switch but I can think of a few from my competitive gaming days. Very low sens and they have a very high sens on a push to hold button rather then a toggle. Kill a dude with perfect aim and then 180 to do it again easily.  This sort of thing takes a long time to get used to however - be prepared to suck for a long time using that sort of thing. What the guys I knew about did still had some muscle memory built in so to speak - they played at a low sens 90% of the time and used the high sens toggle for when quick turns were needed.

I've attempted to switch every in game option to the lowest setting and those two turrets still swivel around at uncontrollable speeds.  I have created a DPI Shift for when I jump on them so they are usable.

EmeraldPS2,3dukdr,MajorLaz0rz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:24:41 2015 UTC,DPI shift is a GREAT button for games like CS and Dirty Bomb that are super twitch and need crazy reactions.   My old mouse had it but recently I just picked up a deathadder and haven't noticed the absence of it at all in PS2.   A great button to remap it to would be either medkit or ability. It's a bit getting used to but your movement is SO much better without having to move your left hand to another key. It makes movement meta much easier to acheive.

EmeraldPS2,3duog5,bulletproofjake,-3,Mon Jul 20 15:03:12 2015 UTC,"Few rounds = half mag of TAR or whatever rifle you were using. I said sorry, and legitimatley felt bad (although I got over it quick because I used 2 medkits, and you took this really whiny tone afterwards) because i didn't hear you say anything until you'd died. I play from Cali on GI internet, and get HORRIBLE lag. And yet somehow my KDR is going up.  So yeah, sometimes things should be taken in contex and not immediately brought into reddit to circle jerk.

EmeraldPS2,3duog5,WaaWaaNC,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:47:46 2015 UTC,"Also whether or not you heard me say sorry doesn't really matter. I stopped firing on you the moment I could react to, ""Oh, this is a friendly."" Not hearing me say sorry right away is not a prompt for you to turn around and mow me down. Intentional TKing is not okay and no one in this community should be encouraging it.  I had a platoon leader from a random pub squad ask us all early this morning that if we see Wisdomcube, to TK him. I said no because other than that my outfit absolutely forbids intentional TKing, it's just not a cool thing to do even if the dude's an insufferable prick."

EmeraldPS2,3dquvl,EagleEyeFoley,5,Sat Jul 18 16:13:54 2015 UTC,"On the air, Haemo had about a squad and I had half. Haemo spent most of the time on the ground leaving us to deal with 20-30 Reavers, especially towards the end. The Koreans wasted a lof of guys with Vortek+Fuel Reavers when we were the only threat and only had 4 Scythes and a Shredder Lib. They didn't do like Briggs that spammed Banshees when they controlled the air, they just kept looking for more aircraft when we had very little. They even had 7-8 Reavers basically idling camping our WG when we had 80% territory and when we pulled there we just flew low and went around them."
EmeraldPS2,3dquvl,HaemoglobinUK,3,Sat Jul 18 16:22:59 2015 UTC,"I flew Charlie squad a.k.a. A gal and 2 scythes.

EmeraldPS2,3dquvl,TheLazySamurai4,2,Sat Jul 18 18:58:25 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it's something to do with the specific particle effects.

When it gets really zergy and you are stuck in tower, best place is the tower AV turret that overlooks the rocks area and the stair part as well.

EmeraldPS2,3dp1f9,Aeflic,0,Sun Jul 19 14:41:17 2015 UTC,"I guess we both have different definitions of carrying. Personally, I believe that whoever mobilizes the most people to the correct bases, whether it be from their own sheer numbers or rallying other outfits in command, to be the ones who carry a faction. Those who interact the greatest and place the faction above themselves. The people who shut themselves off to the faction through high join requirements or by making a farce of command channel absolutely do not carry the faction. They are team players only in the sense that they fight well alongside each other and each other alone."
EmeraldPS2,3dp1f9,bulletproofjake,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:48:42 2015 UTC,"You cannot capture a point and play the objective if you do not kill the mans on the point. If you need more than 55% to do this then you are hurting the rest of the faction somewhere else.   What you do for the NC is admirable and righteous no doubt, but it is not carrying. GOKU does the most carrying of any outfit.   VCO is better than your average PHX or SubG, yes. It's a tier system. You slowly progress up the ladder of outfits as you learn and get better. Having no GOKU/BAX for the TR has crippled them and it shows every day during an alert and during non alerts, all over the maps, and at all times.   If there is no place for decent/better/good players to go they will leave the faction in hopes of a place.

EmeraldPS2,3doeu5,CaptainCoxPS2,2,Fri Jul 17 23:06:27 2015 UTC,You don't show up on the list because TIW players don't pad. I know I'll probably get some pissed off comments for this.
EmeraldPS2,3doeu5,LowGraphicsIsCheatin,2,Fri Jul 17 23:22:53 2015 UTC,Grrrr!  That's the best I got. Sorry.
EmeraldPS2,3doeu5,mpchebe,2,Sat Jul 18 00:15:42 2015 UTC,"I think most of them are false positives... But then again I especially don't trust people in no outfit or in zergfits. Those are more likely to ""statpad"".  Remember, the system sometimes does a false positive on people grinding directives."
EmeraldPS2,3doeu5,Pirbi_PHX,2,Fri Jul 17 23:07:44 2015 UTC,You can tell right away by looking at it.  Here is someone grinding directives:  http://ps2.fisu.pw/killboard/?name=grumpydawg&sp&lastActive=1436840703  Here is someone padding:  http://ps2.fisu.pw/killboard/?name=kingstordl&sp&lastActive=1436025251  Most of the time this type of padding revolves around infantry and you can see the very close intervals between each kill--this is a red flag.
EmeraldPS2,3doeu5,Stormsh7dow,2,Fri Jul 17 23:26:07 2015 UTC,"Lol, look at how grumpydawg's kills come in... He routinely waits 2-3 min before padding again for ribbons. Don't assume he is legit because of the ZAPS tag. He will be removed from PHX as soon as I'm on my PC."
EmeraldPS2,3doeu5,himofeelia,2,Sat Jul 18 17:40:08 2015 UTC,I knew he tended to show up on the list when I approved the application. Seems cool other than a deep hatred for base turrets.
EmeraldPS2,3doeu5,B1ueburry,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:20:55 2015 UTC,"lol, i find this funny as hell. He's more legit then anyone in PHX, just like me he has toons in PHX just to kill people with that tag. It's like having toons in AOD, people never see it coming.  The whole getting kicked from PHX should make a good laugh"
EmeraldPS2,3doeu5,ForlornHop3,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:35:50 2015 UTC,Ummm... your link for someone grinding directives is padding - maybe not inf stats but still boosting directive points to get free shit faster.  Killing the same turret over and over with a BR19 toss account repairing it.
EmeraldPS2,3doeu5,kinenchen,2,Sat Jul 18 19:05:41 2015 UTC,"As I stated in an earlier comment, it has false positives. While infantry/weapon padding is bullshit and should be shamed, I have mixed feelings about directive padding like flying around in a lib and randomly blowing up turrets with a dalton. I would leave that to the discretion of an outfit leader or the greater community to decided."
EmeraldPS2,3doeu5,B1ueburry,2,Sun Jul 19 03:52:47 2015 UTC,"3 of my guys got pinged. Of them 1 was kicked, 1 was warned that continued padding will not be tolerated and has not done it since, and the other was unaware that what they were doing was stat padding and has not done it again."

I'm backing Shoctor up in saying that whoever did it should know he is an ass and is not only making ANGC look bad, but all of Emerald. The Koreans showed really good sportsmanship.

It's just that now I'm getting increasingly frequent periods where the mouse will act as if it is unplugged, and I lose all command authority on the mouse. It's gotten me killed more than a few times..."
EmeraldPS2,3dkgt8,CapitaFK,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:47:41 2015 UTC,"As a fellow Naga owner (avid FFXIV player), how the hell do you play FPS with it? It's heavy and you can't lift the thing without pressing all the damn buttons. I had to dig out my old mouse because I couldn't stand it."
EmeraldPS2,3dkgt8,Wobberjockey,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:44:42 2015 UTC,"I have no issues with the lifting part of it. I'm also tall/lanky so with hands to match, it's more of an issue of finding a mouse big and bulky enough for me.   As far as weight,  I have no problem with heavier mice. Makes it a bit easier to snipe imo."
EmeraldPS2,3dkgt8,CapitaFK,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:51:12 2015 UTC,"I suppose that works. I just couldn't stand pressing all the side buttons any time I lifted it, which is often. But then again, the Naga is gigantic to me."

Getting your weapon proficiency up with hipfiring will mean later on you can hipfire with ADS accuracy and kill those who started out ADSing and never stopped to train their hipfire proficiency.   Next you can start spamming eidolon, which is the best weapon as long as you only get headshots and never miss a shot because it can kill at the longest range. With your new hipfire pinpoint accuracy you will be able to kill peasant snipers and snipe the driver out of aircraft like in that trailer. Dont forget to use a suppressor so you can sneak when needed."

EmeraldPS2,3dmf9c,D3faultString,3,Fri Jul 17 20:37:30 2015 UTC,"I made several comments on the youtube vid itself but I'll repost them here. Maybe make a few edits for clarity and typos.  Shooting at a liberator with anything less than a basilisk or archer deals 0 damage and it reveals you on the minimap.  You keep looking down at the ground/floor. That's no bueno because then you don't know what's going around you and then you get dunked on. Keep your ""head"" up.  Are you making sure to glance the minimap? Are you following the different colors and symbols on it? Remember that you can zoom in and out on the minimap with the bracket keys next to the P button on your keyboard, ""[]"". zooming it in when the fight's close can really save your backside.  Any time you are using just about any non-Submachine gun or non-shotgun, unless you have your muzzle pressed right up against your target, it's always a good idea to Aim Down Sights.  Since you're using a semi-auto weapon on the heavy, you're better off fighting at those longer ranges. The Eidolon is basically the anti-sniper.  You also seem to very rarely flick on your shield. That thing is your lifeline and it's what gives you a major edge in all 1v1 fights infantry fights against anything other than a heavy. In fact, I always suggest that people get the Resist Shield and Advanced Shield Capacitor for those learning how to play heavy properly. I'll teach you myself how to use resist shield effectively.  You need to move with cover. Go from cover to cover and actually think about how much you're exposing yourself. Remember, if you can see them, they can most likely see you.   Lastly, that was not a hacker. You should not call people who kill you hackers. There are so few hackers nowadays that it's like a rare commodity. We have more stat-padders than hackers. You were exposed right out in the open. You may have been wearing a giant target on your head. That's why Sidewinder was so easily able to kill you. Get in cover. Move with cover.  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5d3vzUrw9W23J5WqkzGM79_aRdOfS9N8   Here are Wrel's general info videos about Planetside 2 and his voice isn't like nails on a chalkboard.

Yet when I posted a video and asked for feedback the same top .1% were nothing but encouraging and gave me alot of help.  Its almost like they aren't afraid of competition and are fine with people just trying to get better without making a shit ton of excuses.  Go figure.
EmeraldPS2,3dmf9c,Yeglas,2,Sat Jul 18 01:57:11 2015 UTC,"That's the hope mate.  Although I would say I am most definitely not top .1%.  Probably top 10% at best.  As I think I said in the other post, if you need any further help you can pm me here or ingame."

I didnt want to make something SOO long that people wouldnt want to stick through it.  So i just captured a few snippets of my early boring ass am session. i picked the one with the most events.  So short answer is yes. im shooting for 10ish minutes of good action. ill edit if I need to get the crap out.
EmeraldPS2,3dmf9c,Yeglas,2,Sat Jul 18 04:05:20 2015 UTC,I'm certainly not in one of those leetfits. I'm happy with everyone just getting better no matter what game I'm in. A good fight is better than a steamroll.

EmeraldPS2,3dmf9c,McTayto,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:27:26 2015 UTC,"To be honest I didn't even watch your video until your name was mentioned; usually reading from mobile at work and the service in there sucks too bad to load videos most of the time. I did see the title and have seen others so I made it similar...not much of a joke if you put that it's a joke in the title. It was meant as more of a self deprecating type of humor than a stab at anyone. I was expecting a ""look at this dumbass lol"" response and didn't expect anyone to take this even remotely seriously. I apparently was wrong. I'm a very mediocre infantry player myself and am working to improve every time I play, so I'm the last guy to take shots at anyone else for their abilities, especially when they are working to get better."

I figured from the comments before mine that the OP was just joking, but not everyone here knows that, and it's not important. You're too busy sitting in a corner with your other BAX buddies pointing out, ""HAY, HE'S TROLLING! LOOK EVERYONE, THE OP IS TROLLING! YOU'RE A RETARD FOR GIVING HIM ADVICE BECAUSE THE OP IS TROLLING!""  Seriously, you remind me of that guy from Family Guy. Remove your heads from your butts and approach the thread differently. Here, I'll help you along.  Pretend that he's a new guy. Like.. BR 10-15. What sincere advice would you give to him based off of this video?   I don't care that he's BR100. Give him advice anyway. Maybe the people who are new will come into this thread and read it, which will then make their gameplay better. It's not all just about the OP."
EmeraldPS2,3dmf9c,McTayto,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:42:32 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me like you got embarrassed by responding genuinely to a troll thread without realizing it was in fact, a troll thread.

EmeraldPS2,3dmf9c,McTayto,0,Sat Jul 18 14:55:35 2015 UTC,"No, I figured it was a troll post from the very first comment about the OP getting in on the circlejerk. I didn't know what the troll was, exactly, but again it's not really important. At least not as important as members of BAX are making it out to be.  Seriously, get over it. Take it as an opportunity to help someone (That isn't just the OP) to get better at the game, leave, or just continue sitting in a corner, parroting out that the OP was trolling and generally making asses out of yourselves.  Your choice. My choice right now is to end this conversation though."

EmeraldPS2,3dmf9c,Lampjaw,2,Fri Jul 17 16:26:02 2015 UTC,"I agree.  If we keep being dicks to eachother, the only thing we'll eventually have left is a heavy lack of players as well as the game having a reputation for a toxic playerbase. This game has always had a low player retention rate. We should be doing what we can to keep our players from choosing another game.  Even if it means a person from one faction giving sincere advice to a person from another faction. I'm not saying go completely out of your way to help others, but don't be a dick to new players either. They're learning how to play, and insulting them, yelling at them, whatever. They're going to see, ""Wow. This game's community is terrible."" and then decide on another game the moment the, ""new game feeling"" goes away. The new player might even restart their WoW account in which case we'll never see them again."

I really wish this subreddit could be more accepting of players that play the objective instead of padding their stats and chugging medkits.  Us here at NNG have been encouraging JOD but every time he tries to get advice people think its a joke.   He also always ends playing along like he was in on the joke but all he wants is to get some advice and to be just as good as harvester some day....

EmeraldPS2,3dlh7p,EagleEyeFoley,3,Fri Jul 17 14:33:37 2015 UTC,I heard it and so did everyone else I our squad. There were certainly a plethora of thoeries as to what it was. I'm interested to know what the official word is. I can post video including audio.
EmeraldPS2,3dlh7p,kinenchen,3,Fri Jul 17 06:51:25 2015 UTC,That is the sound a lasher makes when you try to fire it while out of ammo.   The sound radius is set wrong. It's something like 400 m.  for comparison yell chat is only a 300m radius  Source: I did the bug confirmation work with shaql about 6-8 months ago on PTS.
EmeraldPS2,3dlh7p,Wobberjockey,0,Fri Jul 17 15:02:31 2015 UTC,TROOOOLOLOLOLOLLLLL! They did some good work. I quit after about 15 because it was unfun to play. :/
EmeraldPS2,3dlh7p,kinenchen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:49:12 2015 UTC,"Best explanation in our squad was 'the sound a max makes when it is out of ammo'. But, I think Czerny's spot on with his guess.   Also saw a few netlimiter users around Quartz Ridge.   Honestly, the interval was so sporadic that it sounded like some tool bag tapping a key to play it at random.   Also, been to any good Mines lately around Mao?"
EmeraldPS2,3dlh7p,backwardsforwards,3,Fri Jul 17 13:41:36 2015 UTC,It's the lasher bug way back when. Back from the grave to haunt you.
EmeraldPS2,3dlh7p,DJCzerny,3,Fri Jul 17 07:14:19 2015 UTC,The Lasher has a bug in which if you run out of ammo and attempt to fire it the sound for attempting to fire the empty lasher plays for everyone in the region.

EmeraldPS2,3dkgjq,WhatIsOurLimits,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:53:40 2015 UTC,"One of them has pretty much been a CQC SAS-R sniper since BR 1 and the other few do it on occasion. But regardless, they tried to go back to CSGO and they said it was to easy/boring/predictable, and they much prefer planetside now.   And I guess I can see that there may not be a master strategy behind it all exept for don't miss. But even just doing a single commentary video with background footage. You can explain how you got to the proficiency where you are today, tips, tricks, and other general stuff that newer CQC snipers tend to overlook such as getting a good sensitivity.   Even the really simple stuff that any experienced player will say. Practice, know the pace and flow of battle, know the bases, practice, think creatively, and practice some more. Just having a community figurehead say these things may make it really stick or be really motivational to someone just getting into it or may even be completely new information.  And believe me. You can make something that you think is super simple and easy into long and informational commentary. Most of the time you don't even realize how much information you have or how little everyone else has. Sometimes just starting something like this makes you realize that you have alot to talk about. It has happened to me more times than I can remember with various topics. Sometimes I will be giving someone a 10 minute crash course on something, and end up turning it into a 1+ hour lecture and only still scratch the surface.   Edit: Even if the strategy is not complicated, that may be something that people don't know. For example the first clip in this video. A 'n00b' may think that you have some crazy strategy or skill. But it could be as simple as conveying that sometimes all you need is a bit of luck hopefully you don't get spotted. We only see the good clips, not the ones where you die trying. Straight forward, but to some just the message of just keep trying, and be prepared to have some good sessions and bad ones may be enough. I know when I talked to Hatta about Galaxies, and Webster about Flashes they gave me the same generic advice, but it stuck a bit more coming from masters of their craft.  Edit Edit: Just dug this up this might be a cool way to do something new in your videos http://gfycat.com/ImpossibleColossalDarwinsfox and also to go off on my last tangent possibly an uncut video of just a normal play session."
EmeraldPS2,3dkgjq,Papa_Midnight_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:02:55 2015 UTC,"I wonder what his experience was playing cqc sniper from day one. I really wouldn't recommend doing that. Yeah, CS is way more predictable. There's always something new with this game, especially if you rush. I'd really have to think about it, I've never done something like that. I think you're right, and having at least one video would be good to have. I've given a lot of generic advice on the forums, but having it all in one place so more people can see it would be great. A lot of the things I do in game I don't think about or do impulsively. Like the first clip, I just decided to do it because I knew it would be cool if I made it. ""Fuck it"" gets said a lot. Maybe an uncut play session, but the longer streaks are basically that. I like the safe fall idea. I've been bunny hopping down mountains for so long now, but without safe fall.

I was away for Farmers 2 but apparently it bothers him that people say he was carried. I missed the entirety of that season but from the sounds of it, it was just as much of a shit show as the end of season 1 was.    Can someone fill me in on the llama that was farmers season 2?"
EmeraldPS2,3diuxh,JHFO,10,Thu Jul 16 18:30:30 2015 UTC,"Before I start typing this up I'm just going to say that I am going to try and keep this as short and polite as possible, as ""talking mad shit"" is not my intent here.  Season 2 had problems right out the gate with teams pulling out due to lack of interest and not wanting to have their e-rep tarnished with potential failure.    Future Crew and AC were destined to fight it out in the finals right out the gate.  GAB put in some great effort with a roster stacked with talent, but their ping issues held them back from unleashing their full potential.  SolX went through a complete transformation over the course of FS2 going from a team that every one kind of shrugged off to a fierce underdog that every one started rooting for.  Vontrent carried for BLOP while the rest of them tried to get their shit goether, but BLOP was doomed right from the get go because they lacked a truly competent sniper, which is possibly the most important part of a farmer's team.  Again, I'm not trying to talk any shit, and I don't even remember the names, but BLOP's Infil game was weak compared to other teams.  And then there was B4ND.  I can give them all the props in the world for stepping up, but there's no sugar-coating it, B4ND got fucking destroyed.  I can only hope that they were able to keep looking forward and keep the same drive that pushed them to compete in Farmers in the first place.  By the time the finals came around, most of the people playing in Farmers didn't even want to play PS2 anymore-- AC was scraping together a scrim team every night, and I've heard that FCRW barely scrimmed the week of the match, if at all.  For a lot of us, FS2 was like sitting through a movie that started off good, but eventually turned trite.  So now that the generalities are handled, lets talk about the topic at hand: BLOP.  I like quite a few people in BLOP, and I'm glad they stepped in to the ring for farmers, but (and this is purely my own opinion) at times it seems like they did it for the wrong reasons.  I don't know if I'm the only one who got this vibe, but they seemed to come into the tournament with a chip on their shoulder, like they had something to prove.    When we (AC) faced them in matches, they didn't play like they were trying to win, but more like they were trying not to lose--like they were terrified that a push would go bad and they would get stomped down and then have to pick themselves up again.  In short, it made for really boring fights.    It became pretty apparent that some of them were playing for their own personal image, and their participation was simply feeding some of their egos.  Gunide, he was the worst offender in that regard, his ego sprouted like a weed out of raw sewage.  I say with no malice that by the end of FS2 he had a sour attitude and a very inflated sense of self, which was jarring because he had always come off as enthusiastically amiable leading up to the tournament.  He might have come away from Farmers with a focus on 1v1 because his gameplay during matches seemed to revolve around shutting down the enemy Light Assault, but not necessarily coordinating plays with his team.  This was very apparent in the games we played in the finals, where he mostly just hung back defensively and picked me off when I tried to make a play.  It was effective to a degree, but again he wasn't really going for flanks that would facilitate stronger pushes for his team.  If people say he was carried, it's probably because he started playing for score, and stopped playing for wins."
EmeraldPS2,3diuxh,PurelyGumbo,5,Fri Jul 17 01:05:13 2015 UTC,"FCRW vs AC is close (and entertaining to watch) when both teams practice. Towards the end I don't think either team had much enthusiasm for the game itself left. FCRW no practice at all not even play PS2 for almost a month. AC knuckled down, dragged themselves into practice and live server despite not liking the game and got thier deserved win.  I got that mosquito though  BLOP got carried by Armgarion kill-wise as far as I recall. Vontrent pulled shotgun and killed me in our match so the Pandoracalypse began.  GAB+Jackhammers+building=no bueno  No Therum shuffle level drama went down but many shotguns and maxes were used unlike S1."
EmeraldPS2,3diuxh,EdubsMcDownvote,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:33:43 2015 UTC,BLOP is a terrible outfit confirmed. Also dead outfit
EmeraldPS2,3diuxh,PEEETREEEe,6,Sun Jul 19 20:58:31 2015 UTC,"First, Gunide.  Yes, he does come off as insufferably arrogant at times. To the point of it being over-the-top. I think he's aware of this, and if you can brush it off, it actually becomes somewhat endearing/funny. He likes opportunities to prove himself in this game. There isn't anything wrong with that.  As Lex alluded to in his typically positive way, several players in BLOP and their fielded farmers team were young, with the responsibilities and lack of absolute control over their time that comes with that. This hurt us when it came to practicing (we scrimmed maybe 3 or 4 times over the course of the entire season).  On a deeper level, it's interesting to see gaming has come to the point where there are actually different generations playing with each other. This doesn't quite excuse the trash talk or unquenchable desire to prove one's self that is more prevalent in the younger players, but I feel a little slack should be given.  On a side note, I apologize for not being around to try to scream at BLOPeratives in TS to limit the yell/tell chat meta and/or be more generally pleasant to their fellow players. This should change soon.  Bottom line,  Gunide is a talented light assault (his play-style aside, it's not really debatable) and a decent person.  Second, Season 2  The main issue with this season was that there were too few unknowns. People could look at the teams competing, and instantly and accurately judge just how the season would play itself out.  Season 1 was exciting, because it was more competitive. People watched the matches because they didn't know who would come out on top.  This should have been a warning sign to the organizers from the start.  Once B4ND was included, I feel like a better course of action would have been to drop the ""elite"" status of the competition, and have encouraged other outfits to compete. Large ones, especially, could have easily fielded 6 players.  Yes, I understand ""Farmers"" was meant to be a showing of the best IvI players in the game in a controlled, 6 v 6 environment. The format is very appealing for a large subset of the game.  However, could you honestly tell me that people would not have tuned in for a match between the elite of GOKU and BAX? SSGO and GOTR? HYUN and IRON?   With the play by play of the casters (which was well done, and the best part of the season, thank you), each match could have truly been a community event. AC and FCRW could have still done their thing, but there would have been more matches worth watching.  It would have been less of a ""Who is the best?"", and more of a ""Just how good can we be?"".  In response to Latro and having a ""chip"" on our shoulders, yeah. That's pretty accurate. I enjoy rivalry in games, when it adds to the competition. This is rarely the case when it comes to AC.  Latro, personally, I like. He's good-natured and fun to play with (against). Some of the others, not as much. The disdain and venom that drips off of several of them is obnoxious, and adds little to the experience.  It felt like by the end of the season, it was just an AC and FCRW show. (Or it simply was from the start.)   I apologize for making this an issue if this was also the case for AC, but we weren't even told when our finals match would be until the Monday prior to it. This (relatively) short notice for it forced us to play without our best player.   Would it have made much of a difference? No, probably not, but it was the principal of it.    All in all I had fun, and would do it again. (PS, Schwak you're ridiculous and silly.)"
EmeraldPS2,3diuxh,EagleEyeFoley,2,Fri Jul 17 19:15:40 2015 UTC,Your comments regarding generations is actually super interesting to think about. You've got probably close to 30 year spread of ages all playing together with a variety of maturity levels regardless of age.

EmeraldPS2,3diuxh,hero_system,2,Thu Jul 16 18:56:33 2015 UTC,Why didn't teams practice?   Farmers season 1 was only as fun as it was because we were always scrimming on Jaeger. To the point where I barely was on the actual server anymore.

EmeraldPS2,3diuxh,agrueeatedu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:01:10 2015 UTC,"All I can say is that BLOP didn't practice much before their matches, after val left (around the 2-3 match).

Our team was pretty much Rein, Blues, Almeta, and whoever was available and wouldn't be absolutely impossible to carry until the roster changes. Then we had another good player who had never played in TFL in Identity, and we got a good match out of Kammy. You just aren't going to be able to compete with outfits like AC if I'm one of the best 6 players you can put out more weeks than not."

Be that as it may i am still extremely dissapointed that the team we were slated to face chose to forfeit us instead of play against us in an actual match. The opponent for that bracket has now changed 3 times by my count according to what i am seeing in this bracket system. First we were told we would be fighting VULT, then 56RD which we forfeit.

EmeraldPS2,3dmzht,Treefusor,2,Fri Jul 17 20:01:44 2015 UTC,"I wasn't given confirmation from the team that we could have slots until a few days before, and by that point half of our planned roster was unavailable and I had no time to get in touch with the rest.  As I told Jurassik and Runsta (the outfit reps from GOON and VULT for this), I'd have loved to have played with them but it couldn't work out on that day unfortunately."
EmeraldPS2,3dmzht,Days0fDoom,-4,Fri Jul 17 21:53:15 2015 UTC,I don't know. Maybe they could not field the entire 24 required. For whatever reason Emerald gave Connery's shitty teams a pass. This is ridiculous.  Thank God that the Aussies showed Connery's biggest wannabes HIVE what an actual competitive team looks like.
EmeraldPS2,3dmzht,endervs,-7,Fri Jul 17 16:39:51 2015 UTC,"one forfeited because they couldn't get their shit together, the other becaues an outfit pulled out on them. I'll let you guys theorize on which was which"
EmeraldPS2,3dmzht,ReltorTR,4,Fri Jul 17 17:14:49 2015 UTC,"More like you guys changed the day and didn't tell honcho, at least that's what he says. Also can you read? I was very clear in this thread that the DA team was not DA and it should not have been named as such. I don't know why you guys changed the name but honcho was clear this the team was not DA."
EmeraldPS2,3dmzht,Days0fDoom,2,Fri Jul 17 21:52:02 2015 UTC,"The tags ""[DA]"" were not the tags of the MIXED team that were placed on the application, google doc, for lanesmash. As such should not be on the official bracket for this, whatever this is now. The tags you are looking for are [CROW] but you would know that because you have the google doc application forms...... As the offical chosen administrator of the planetside battles league for lanesmash."
EmeraldPS2,3dmzht,ReltorTR,4,Sat Jul 18 09:07:52 2015 UTC,"One forfeited because of being forced to change match times with no warning. The other forfeited because of being unable to pull enough numbers WITHOUT said outfit, that did not pull out, but was simply unable to play on the date for the match."
EmeraldPS2,3dmzht,MajorLaz0rz,4,Fri Jul 17 21:54:57 2015 UTC,It's almost like PSB people say shit that isnt true to cover their asses.

EmeraldPS2,3dmzht,ReltorTR,-5,Fri Jul 17 23:25:21 2015 UTC,"You obviously mean DA for the first and VULT for the second. We're not idiots here on Emerald (there is a reason we're not on Connery). But the real purpose I made this post is exactly this: Emerald teams are fucking up, forfeiting, and letting pathetic Connery teams into the finals."

The fact that Schwak had the bright idea to shame Reign so that he could feel superior to Reign is like a group of midgets trying to see which one of them were the tallest.   If Schwak could accept that his ""world record"" was purely luck with shooting through a door, and if Reign could have accepted he hadn't done good enough to get banned, we would all have been fine.  But iSuck had to keep feeding his egoistic e-dick and make that ReignDisgrace thread."

We all know that schwak got lucky by finding those retards shortly after he logged in but that doesnt change the fact that Reign talks more shit than is healthy for him and if you do talk shit like this to schwak you can surely expect that it will end up on reddit.

Schwak shittalks a lot too- so don't think that only Reign deserves to be shamed. I claimed that it seemed ironical that Schwak called Reign out on shittalking while Schwak is as/more of a shittalker as Reign.   You somehow think that schwack has suddenly accendend to good tier player by getting banned faster than any of us.   are you fucking retarded? If you seriously think that I believe Schwak is more than an above-average player, you obviously don't know me enough to start calling me out on ""white-knighting""."

Consider moving a bit further back on the tower edge so you can shoot the guy easily - he doesn't know you are there anyways. You did dump your whole mag though. Short reloads save lives.  Overall your bursts are too long and you need to let go of m1 about twice as often for those ranged fights.   STOP STARING AT THE GROUND. Your crosshair is always below where even someones feet would be unless you turn a corner and bump into an enemy. Thats why the LA almost killed you ; you had to move your crosshair so far that the fight began before it was even on his head.  Get some Shadowplay footage of clusterfucks. This is a pretty quiet fight where your aim, movement and decision making aren't tested heavily."

I did reset for what I hoped was the quick kill. It was pretty embarrassing.   STOP STARING AT THE GROUND.    That and my sensitivity is what im going to tweak coming out of this. Ive been trying to preaim better. I need to literally FORCE myself to aim higher and ONLY go for headshots. Thats what is going to take i think.  Hey man since I got you here lemme ask you a questions.  Currently im using the visigodo INI. I do this so my hipfire and ADS 360 will be the same.  This really kills my ability to turn left and right though.  Do you think it would be better to change my hipfire sensitivity in game so I can retain the fine tune while ADSing or just raise all my sensitivities?  Thanks for the help.
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,JHFO,5,Thu Jul 16 01:14:17 2015 UTC,"Use what feels good, not what other players use.   I do that to enemies right below and above me too  - only human aiming contrary to some opinions.  Once you train yourself for headshots dont try for ALL headshots though. Can get you killed when you go for them and miss because REASONS.   You can literally bodyshot your way to a 10 KD (assuming you've got the positioning and game sense) because most PS2 players aren't accurate. But even bodyshots require proper crosshair placement to save time in aiming."
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,Definia,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:48:31 2015 UTC,Once you train yourself for headshots dont try for ALL headshots though.   See i have get in the habit of going for them again. Honestly that session was worse than most of mine. Still I want to get to the 30% HSR mark.    You can literally bodyshot your way to a 10 KD (assuming you've got the positioning and game sense) because most PS2 players aren't accurate.   I think thats why I did better as CQC cloaker. My aim wasnt perfect but I could regularly pound out 10 or 15 kill streaks using multiple angles of attacks on bads.  I need to avoid Cloaking for a while. i think that may be counterproductive for my aim at the moment. Probably better of just rolling HA for a bit.  Thanks man
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,Definia,3,Thu Jul 16 01:56:06 2015 UTC,"So the first bit when you shooting the max, that was pointless and gave away your position, if the TR guy coming out the building was half competent you'd be engaging un-knowingly against an enemy that knew where you were.  You need to shoot more mans in the head, the 1v1 against LA in the tower, shows that.  is that sensitivity comfortable for you? You appear to be struggling to track players when they are moving, when you are on the tower it shows when you are shooting down.  Burst fire is your best friend 4 lyf.  Better footage with more hectic engagements will allow for more/better feedback"
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,Hypers0nic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:41:23 2015 UTC,"So the first bit when you shooting the max, that was pointless and gave away your position   yep. Was bad.   is that sensitivity comfortable for you? You appear to be struggling to track players when they are moving, when you are on the tower it shows when you are shooting down.   Im glad yall brought that up. Ive been trying to work it down for more accuracy. About a week or 2 ago I thought I was OVERcompensating. So I took it down a notch.  I think I need to adjust it back.   Better footage with more hectic engagements will allow for more/better feedback   This is my first time ever using shadow play. Honestly it was as much a test run on that as it was trying to record a session.  I didnt want to show one of my better sessions. I wanted a run of the mill session. Showing a highlight real doesnt help shit.  thanks, Appreciate it."
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,JHFO,2,Wed Jul 15 22:48:22 2015 UTC,"No i don't want a highlight reel. Footage with more engagements and 1v1s or 2v1s where you need to switch targets. A busier run of the mill session.  Use Shadow record, its lovely."
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,PEEETREEEe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:53:04 2015 UTC,Footage with more engagements and 1v1s or 2v1s where you need to switch targets. A busier run of the mill session.   emerald from 2 am to 7 am in the morning is kinda dull. Im going to work on the good feedback yall gave me then come back with a longer video. Again really appreciate it.  Hopefully Aeflic wont see it and deny my app now. XP
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,PEEETREEEe,3,Wed Jul 15 23:07:02 2015 UTC,"Also, overcompensating has a lot to do with muscle memory.  Instead of making large changes (even a difference of a cm is large for reference), focus on improving your muscle memory.  It seems like a lot of people fall into the trap of making minuscule changes to their sensitivity and never really getting used to the new one before they see somewhere they screwed up, and change it again."
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,iSchwak,3,Wed Jul 15 23:59:55 2015 UTC,This. I've used 7-9 inches per 360 for most of my time playing shooters with the odd 20-40 inch per 360 in competitive play when im playing some dedicated sniping role and I never have to turn around much.  Pick something you like and don't mess with it any time you have a bad play session. Planetside is a random unpredictable game and I doubt you've got the NASA computer to keep 120-144 FPS stable 24/7. FPS dips will mess with your tracking whatever your sensitivity is.
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,Hypers0nic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:36:25 2015 UTC,Appreciate you clarifying that.  I definately dont have a nasa stable computer. Its better than most but the processor is a few years old. Upgraded mouse and video card and monitor recently and that helped alot. Can take advantage of the 144hz monitor I got.
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,Iron_Horsemen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:53:06 2015 UTC,"It seems like a lot of people fall into the trap of making minuscule changes to their sensitivity and never really getting used to the new one before they see somewhere they screwed up, and change it again.   Very true. Thats one of my concerns. Ive got a lotta good feedback. I dont mind just changing things and seeing what happens. I have to allow those changes to mellow.   Thanks for chiming in. Appreciate your feedback brother."
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,Iron_Horsemen,2,Thu Jul 16 01:04:39 2015 UTC,I thought the same thing as well re your sens. It just seemed like your movement was labored and slow. Lex has one of the larger 360 lengths I know and he still moves quick because he's used to it and knows how much to move his arm.   Was this a recent change?
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,McTayto,2,Wed Jul 15 23:13:09 2015 UTC,I have been playing with the G502 for about 3 months. I lowered my sensitivity considerably for control purposes when I got the new mouse.  New mouse. muscle memory was borked anyways. So why not.  About 2 weeks ago I had a session or so that i felt I was WAY overcompensating. So i dropped it 50 DPI. Noticible but not drastic.  WHen Im getting home im going to go back to the old number.   So to answer the question yea DPI adjusted fairly recently.
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,Hypers0nic,2,Wed Jul 15 23:22:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah it looks just slightly cumbersome for you to move. The most important thing is you're trying. Keep tweaking, you'll find your sweet spot."
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,gamespyer035,2,Wed Jul 15 23:25:21 2015 UTC,Actual sensitivity is probably better to tweak then DPI. If you want to make an exact change you can always use the calculator and manage your numbers in the INI.
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,McTayto,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:56:00 2015 UTC,I was reluctant to change the numbers in the visi ini. I was worrying about introducing pixel skipping or something else.
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,Iron_Horsemen,2,Sat Jul 18 02:21:35 2015 UTC,Don't worry about that.  Just find some comfortable numbers and stick with them.
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,McTayto,3,Sat Jul 18 02:23:57 2015 UTC,"Bursts.  Almost every time the COF screwed you up to some degree and bursts would have screwed it back down.  Headshots, not dickshots.  Like others have aid, the sens is too low for you at the moment.  You either need to break in the arm movement more or turn it back up a bit.  Unless you've spent a lot of time as a bolt primary with the 4x crosshair a simple dot might serve you better as the overlay.  Re: Positioning, watch a decent amount of HA gameplay on twitch.  Someone good is streaming pretty much all the time.  Hour for hour spent, nothing is going to help with positioning like watching someone who's good at the class play and trying to copy them when you play."

Ill try out the dot. When i trialed the dot in the past it seemed too small. I didnt use it much in game. Ill give it a run in my session tonight.   Headshots, not dickshots.   Couldnt agree more.   Bursts. Almost every time the COF screwed you up to some degree and bursts would have screwed it back down.   Got a reccommended burst length for anchor? maybe I should go to 3 shot bursts. That would be a kill with all HSs. Still learning NC in many ways after years with TR.  Thanks. really appreciate it."
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,Iron_Horsemen,2,Wed Jul 15 23:28:38 2015 UTC,"When i trialed the dot in the past it seemed too small.   The smaller dot trains you over time to be more precise in my experience.  Obscures less, less clutter, helps you dial in on small things (like headshots).   Got a reccommended burst length for anchor?   It's not really about that and from the amount of footage it's hard to be certain, but it seemed like shots were getting away from you that shouldn't have with where you were aiming.  You might need to allow a tiny bit longer between bursts to let the COF settle more fully."
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,GamerDJ,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:34:20 2015 UTC,You might need to allow a tiny bit longer between bursts to let the COF settle more fully.   Ill work on it. Thats the real muscle memory that is hard to change though. I agree with yalls points though.
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,bulletproofjake,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:35:46 2015 UTC,"3 shot? Nah. Too risky. 7-8 shots should be alright before you let go of the trigger or if your target dies, whichever comes first."
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,Hypers0nic,4,Wed Jul 15 23:34:37 2015 UTC,That is bad advice.
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,JHFO,3,Thu Jul 16 00:01:01 2015 UTC,"4 is what I would've said, MAYBE 5 shots tops, but 7 or 8? You have some things to work on"
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,JHFO,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:41:37 2015 UTC,"Okay, what range are we going by? I've tested the Anchor before and I'm only going by how many shots to kill assuming no headshots and in Nanoweave before bursting. It's a pretty accurate weapon imo."
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,bulletproofjake,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:44:22 2015 UTC,"Assuming no headshots   Which you should be aiming for, in bursts of approximately put-them-down size repeated until it happens.  Getting no headshots means you can't aim.  :P  And it's only accurate before the COF goes everywhere.  And you don't even have the Anchor tracked on DAStats, much less auraxed."

EmeraldPS2,3dff05,PurelyGumbo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:37:57 2015 UTC,More than a few is far too risky with COF being as it is in PS2 unless you're muzzlefucking the guy.
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,Terafir,2,Thu Jul 16 20:20:56 2015 UTC,"Try to get out of the habit of looking at the ground when you run. Keeping your crosshair at head level will help in every situation, whether you're caught off-guard or you see someone you want to engage. Then, not only are you already prepared to engage, but you will also be aiming for the head a lot more than you currently are. That knocks out two birds with one stone.  There wasn't much to go off of here, so I don't really know if you do this already or not, but if you have a long-distance engagement, do your best to use small bursts without too much of a delay between them to keep your CoF spread as low as possible while still sending plenty of bullets toward the target.  You also might want to play with your sensitivity a little bit. There's a google doc somewhere that can help you out with it, some sort of ideal sensitivity calculator, but I have to find the link for it."
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,Xayton,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:56:55 2015 UTC,"Try to get out of the habit of looking at the ground when you run.

The LA was a good example of me struggling after an elevation change.   but if you have a long-distance engagement, do your best to use small bursts without too much of a delay between them to keep your CoF spread as low as possible    My problem is I have problem swapping between long range 2 shot bursts to the 3 or 4 shot bursts ill use closer range.   There wasn't much to go off of here   Literally the first time i used shadowplay. I did a 3 minute session since I didnt want to make it too long. Ill probably swap to a 10 minute session with me having more action. Then ill edit it down past the lulz. That video was the one with the most encounters with least downtime.   You also might want to play with your sensitivity a little bit.   Probably the best advice I got out of this. Im going to adjust my sensitivity up. I felt I was overcompensating a few weeks ago. thats not the case though.  I do use the Visigodo INI then adjust my sensitivities to feel."
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,NegatorXX,2,Wed Jul 15 23:05:33 2015 UTC,"Posting here as well  Aside from my feedback, I have 2 questions. Mouse set up (including sens, mouse type, and mousepad) and age. Yes, how old are you. I promise it's relevant  0:15 Burst moar, and in shorter bursts. Esp. when you know you have little chance of killing them  1:05 Headshots. Always and forever. If you'd triple Tink'd him with the Anchor, you probably wouldnt have needed to use the medkit  Those were the only things I noticed. The rest just seems like tracking errors that I got better, by practicing at.  Also, use adren nano for total OP HA mode. I know the lack of downtime with resist is nice, but it doesn't absorb a lot compared to adren nano combo. Paging /u/hypers0nic for the actual numbers. You fucking nerd you"
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,SaiyanX3,3,Wed Jul 15 22:39:17 2015 UTC,I'm not sure why I respond to you anymore Boxer :P.  Resist: 1800 (if you engage before actually getting hit)  Adren with Nano: 1980   Without Nano: 1650  Edit:Formatting
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,Mustarde,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:06:36 2015 UTC,Yea thats about what I thought the numbers were. Ill give the classic Overshields a try again.  Appreciate it.
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,Mustarde,2,Wed Jul 15 23:30:19 2015 UTC,1818 EHP for Resist  1650 for Adren 1900 for Adren+NW on bodyshots.  I use Adren because I am not using my shield the entire fight (faster strafe speed equals more hp) and Adren is a seperate hp pool so I can keep my shield regen timer AND not run out of medkits as a non-member peasant.  1500 welfare certs let you cert up Resist+asc HA however. Adrenoweave is expensive (and not too great unless you win fights overwhelmingly).
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,Mustarde,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:40:53 2015 UTC,1500 welfare certs let you cert up Resist+asc HA however. Adrenoweave is expensive (and not too great unless you win fights overwhelmingly).   I got nanoweave maxed already from obama certs while this guy was a VR toon for a year. I will probably cert out adren. Its 2000ish certs IIRC. I boost and have membership so its not that bad.  I just know on my TR guy I didnt care for it much. A big part of that was I wasnt a 1 KPM player then.  Nowadays I can BARELLY hit 1 KPM. So it just MIGHT be worthwhile. Hope the tweaks/ works I am doing will help that some.   I use Adren because I am not using my shield the entire fight (faster strafe speed equals more hp)   Thats one thing that was limiting me. resist HAS to be running so its killing my adad.   Thanks again.
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,Hypers0nic,2,Thu Jul 16 05:14:10 2015 UTC,"Players use that KPM arguement for Adren but this is how it goes. If you kill 1 person every 45 seconds, Adren is better then NMG for downtime not Resist. This is at max rank - Adren doesnt shine till last or second last rank.  If you get into a duel with a good player who headshots Resist+ASC will have more EHP. If he scurries into cover when you have Adren he'll have full HP by the time your regular shield starts charging again and you won't have an overshield.  I made a brand new character and managed the same performance as Adrenoweave fully certed with Resist+ASC but it plays different. A big mistake that doesn't leave you dead with Adren leaves you weaker for a while -  Resist+ASC you're back in the fight in a few seconds even if its weaker 1 v 1 or if you manage to kill a group."
EmeraldPS2,3dff05,iSchwak,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:07:37 2015 UTC,A big mistake that doesn't leave you dead with Adren leaves you weaker for a while - Resist+ASC you're back in the fight in a few seconds   Revisited NMG last night. For us mere mortals I found it pretty forgiving. If I got jumped running resist I was taking full damage. My EHP poll was 1000 and my HP ceiling was lower since he had shots on me while resist was down.  I followed your lead and used the over shield as an switchable HP pool. The additional movement really did help out.   This is at max rank - Adren doesnt shine till last or second last rank.   Im not equipping till max rank. I'll need that extra regen.

What I've enjoyed about the time, is that it forces you into a different style of play.  I learned new ways of closing the distance with targets, ways that I probably wouldn't have, given that range weapons allow me to stop and engage at most distance if I get caught.  One more tool in the bag."

I guess the trick is to have a high kd and high kph/kpm in a short time which I could never really find the fights to do so, people watching the stream could see I would do pretty well for the first hour and a half then things would go down cause I couldnt find anybody or we were out popped 4 to 1 at a base."

Also, if you're against ""elitefits"" and you're still getting the cap - Trust me - their not there to stop you, they're there to FARM you.

EmeraldPS2,3d5qra,MikeyBDatBull,0,Tue Jul 14 16:04:43 2015 UTC,"Anything but 50/50 equal fight using = bad. Should instead break up platoon so low BR pubbies can go toe to toe with TIW, AC, and L in 1-12 fights. Good thing VS are the only ones who redeploy to overpop on defense. SSGO- Have literally never ever taken a base without 800% overpop, ever. Any evidence to the contrary is lies, dammed lies, and statistics. Happen to win a base = doesn't count, was allowed to win by grace of superior players.     Sounds good to me  /unjerk  In all seriousness, i'm interested in knowing your views on SSGO from the outside looking in. Always eager to improve, and part of that is listening to people who have real grievances with how we operate.   Most people i've encountered seem either ambivalent towards us, or focus on the skill level of our individual players, which admittedly is not excellent (average K/D=.91), something I feel is a necessary evil of running an outfit without requirements for entry. What are some failings of ours you've encountered?  Also, I have no idea who TAS are."
EmeraldPS2,3d5qra,Eurip1des,2,Tue Jul 14 17:57:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I was just fucking with you while bored at work.  SSGO, to my knowledge, just runs a shit ton of pub platoons and just pushes a line.  Nothing wrong with that, it's how the ""meta"" game was designed from a development standpoint.  What it actually did was just a whole nother battle, but that's not anyone's fault.  Stats don't really matter, I was apart of BWC for years, you think I care about outfit wide stats?  Lol no way, that's a joke.  I barely care about any stat, even personal, despite KDR reference to other shitters in this thread.  Your shortcomings comes with you guys stacking your good players with your bads to help ease the fight, I never see select SSGO players fighting people of equal skill level to help stop a smaller force somewhere else unless it's at twilight hours when there is 200 people on the server in total.  TAS is The Ascend, they play for NC and were similiar to SSGO, BWC, AOD, and other large outfits with no requirements for entry other than reading some rules, signing up on their website (or at least that's what they're told to do), and playing every once in awhile.  But like most of NC, they are retarded from top to bottom.  So you unaware of who they are is a direct result to the fact that I'm preeeeetty sure their PS2 side just exploded and died."
EmeraldPS2,3d5qra,MikeyBDatBull,2,Wed Jul 15 17:13:07 2015 UTC,I really am ambivalent to SSGO.  You all are not often very good infantry players but you certainly are a step above zergfit baddies.

EmeraldPS2,3d5qra,autowikibot,0,Tue Jul 14 01:10:09 2015 UTC,"Testudo formation:       In Ancient Roman warfare, the testudo or tortoise formation was a formation used commonly by the Roman Legions during battles, particularly sieges. Testudo is the Latin word for ""tortoise"". The Greek term for this formation is ""chelone"" and during the Byzantine era, it seems to have evolved to what military manuals of the era call the ""foulkon"".  In the testudo formation, the men would align their shields to form a packed formation covered with shields on the front and top. The first row of men, possibly excluding the men on the flanks, would hold their shields from about the height of their shins to their eyes, so as to cover the formation's front. The shields would be held in such a way that they presented a shield wall to all sides. The men in the back ranks would place their shields over their heads to protect the formation from above, balancing the shields on their helmets, overlapping them. If necessary, the legionaries on the sides and rear of the formation could stand sideways or backwards with shields held as the front rows, so as to protect the formation's sides and rear; this made the formation slow and they covered very little ground.  Plutarch describes this formation as used by Mark Antony during his invasion of Parthia in 36 BC:   ""Then the shield-bearers wheeled round and enclosed the light-armed troops within their ranks, dropped down to one knee, and held their shields out as a defensive barrier. The men behind them held their shields over the heads of the first rank, while the third rank did the same for the second rank. The resulting shape, which is a remarkable sight, looks very like a roof, and is the surest protection against arrows, which just glance off it.""    Cassius Dio writes about the testudo when describing the campaign of Mark Antony in 36 BC:   ""This testudo and the way in which it is formed are as follows. The Baggage animals, the light-armed troops, and the cavalry are placed in the center of the army. The heavy-armed troops who use the oblong, curved, and cylindrical shields are drawn up around the outside, making a rectangular figure, and, facing outward and holding their arms at the ready, they enclose the rest. The others who have flat shields, form a compact body in the center and raise their shields over the heads of all the others, so that nothing but shields can be seen in every part of the phalanx alike and all the men by the density of the formation are under shelter from missiles. Indeed, it is so marvelously strong that men can walk upon it and whenever they come to a narrow ravine, even horses and vehicles can be driven over it.""

Meanwhile me and a half squad or squad isn't worrying about that shit and has either backcapped their sorry asses while they are busy ""assuming the formation"" or we are carpet bombing them with heavies from a galaxy and fucking everything up or setting up a lancer nest or some other random chicanery.

As i was killing vangaurds the other day i realized i had to use atleast 6 hornets to do so and i had to actually try and stay out of their line of fire. While this is doable i believe it is way to hard and i should get AP hornets so that i can 1 hit them back. It is only fair since they can roll where ever they want and i am stuck flying around in the air where if i fly to high i hit a ceiling. Also MBT's can run into trees and not blow up, how is this fair? So i agree with the forum guy."

EmeraldPS2,3d68m9,CaptainCoxPS2,2,Tue Jul 14 16:03:13 2015 UTC,"My standard advice.  Go to Coxes post and visit the teamspeaks. Play with them all. Basically try before you buy.  small squad stuff = IRON, SUIT medium size outfit = HNYB, 1TR  Specialty outfits = INAM.   I like the 903 guys. Problem is they just haven't been that active lately except a few guys. Like many they seem to have moved on.  As far as NC and VS there are good outfits there. Unless your above 2 KDR your not going to qualify for the top tier ones though.  So get experience then roll 4th faction style."

If you go straight to GOKU you wont appreciate the GOKU as much.   But seriously I totally forgot about yall when i wrote that. I was thinking AC/DA/BAX/TIW. Leetfits basically.  Sadly DA and now AC are largely MIA.

BLOP can be pretty good if they get guys together.   I have to admit im just as bad as everyone else. I started lvling my NC a month or so ago in earnest. Its hard to play as TR since then. Its easymode as infiltrator. I dont have to play against the cyclone or a billion BA babies running around.  All I can attest that 1TR is improving. The average BR is going up. KDR is improving. Basically 1TR is going for the BAX/GOKU model. We need shooters though as aeflic would say."
EmeraldPS2,3d68m9,F22xRaptor,2,Tue Jul 14 02:09:45 2015 UTC,"It legitimately is pretty hard to justify logging in as a TR on Emerald most nights.  Last night's hossin alert was one of their better showings in a long time, though.  To me, there is a lot of stuff to like about TR except the part where you actually have to play.  No strategic mobility from the masses, what good players exist are spread across a dozen outfits and the result is that you have players sticking it out in fights that don't need the help while a half dozen other fights languish.  During Alerts, TR seems content with their role as little more than kingmaker and often don't even bother to show up with the kind of numbers you'd need to make a real effort at winning."

EmeraldPS2,3d68m9,Hypers0nic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:43:47 2015 UTC,"Lmao @ SUIT being a skillfit.   They get all they can out of their guys. Im not going to shit on guys for trying something. BLOP went in farmers. They weren't top tier but they competed anyways.   Also lmao at 1TR being like BAX or GOKU, good luck with that.   I didnt say 1TR was BAX and GOKU. I said we are modeling themselves out after BAX and GOKU in many respects.  The TR has no mid size outfit that can sway alerts/ take territory. Usually GOKU is the key factor as if they arent on VS the VS are garbage. If they are on TR then its a basically comes down to starting territories or if BAX is doing ops.  Personally I can care less about alerts. I play to improve my game at this point.   circling back Flatness and cox do alot of work with what they have. You dont grow experience overnight. People dont hit BR 100 unless you give them time.  The bones are absolutely there. Shoctor leads flat out GOKU style. (when hes not playing with GOKU). flatness/ cox make solid calls. So it comes down to if we have the pop and shooters to move a point. Head to head BAX has and will beat 1TR. GOKU will crush us as well.  Im apping BAX and have spent considerable amount of time with Aeflic and crew lately. There is anything magically. The redeploys/ speed are basically the same. I cant speak for GOKU.  The TR on emerald are just bad in general. its the most farmable faction. None of this is new. Im not going to shit on guys or laugh in their face for trying to improve their game though."
EmeraldPS2,3d68m9,flipit2mute,2,Tue Jul 14 04:39:35 2015 UTC,I would consider making a VS to join GOKU but I can't tell if their recruitment requirements are serious or just trolling.

They have improved a lot since I met them.  They need to work on squad comp a bit, and tighten up on orders, and do some work on each members mouse settings and frame rate settings, but otherwise I can't see myself playing with any other TR other than maybe blop.  They are about where the VCO guys were when we left for BAX.    That being said I'm just a support shitter,  not one of the good shooters in bax, just an observation having played with almost every outfit at some time or another.  I definitely like where the 1TR guys are going, and they would fit in on a joint op with us as well as any NC outfit."
