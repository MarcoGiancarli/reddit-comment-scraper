TrollBookClub,3e4yd8,ApocaLiz,2,Wed Jul 22 14:03:22 2015 UTC,It is called Shadowshaper by Daniel Jose Older. I'm going to stick it out just to see if it gets any better but I will only be giving it 2/5 I think

The people that were going to the silo are not like Jules, they don't want to rescue the kids, they just want to expand their own homes. They want to claim a bigger plot, and that makes them just as nasty as the people Jimmy saw kill each other.   Also, screw you Thurman!! I shake my fist at you!!!   He wondered if all the people from this other world would be the same: the men bearded and covered in soot, the women wild and resourceful.   i love this 'fresh/different' view of how other humans can be. like an alien species, not other humans from a neighboring silo. :)"
TrollBookClub,3byasc,1Eliza,2,Fri Jul 3 03:58:24 2015 UTC,"I think that Silo 18 is a winner here. They had somewhere to go when Silo 1 had a powertrip. The Silo 17 people are just where they used to be.  Did they talk about what the rankings of the silos were? Sure, the drilling is what caused Silo 1 to really recognize Silo 18, but thy were behind in the rankings.  No. People have died from Silo 18. People are mad, sad, and scared. That is never good thing. The conflicts will only escalate.   I am very upset over Lukas' death. Especially after he was talking about their decisions being forever. He just seemed to keep her grounded in a whole lot of ways. He is the one who forces her to think differently.   Quotes:  ""He turned his head to make sure she could hear, and Juliette braced for something corny like 'love' or something unfunny like 'your casseroles'.   'What lasts forever?' she obliged sure to regret it but sensing that he was waiting for her to ask  'Our decisions,' he said.""  ""Mankind had the right to go extinct. That's what life did: It went extinct. It made room for the next in line. But individual men often against the natural order.""  ""'Until now. We solved it here with the cryopods and the shifts. Power is temporary, and it never leaves the same few hands. There is no transfer of power.'"""

And on camera. Where our boss can see. When she said she wasn't sure what she was going to read next I asked if she had thought about something other than rape erotica and she laughed and said I sound like her boyfriend.
