valkyrie,3czzbc,ChribbaX,3,Mon Jul 13 06:10:38 2015 UTC,That would be amazing. I'm to understand that being a passenger in a ship you're not in control of is a recipe for motion sickness but some of us have pretty strong constitutions. :)  I'm going to go poke CCP jBot on Twitter.
valkyrie,3czzbc,bam_stroker,2,Mon Jul 13 08:24:41 2015 UTC,That would be pretty cool..hopefully it would be a little more exciting that the Warcraft one though.
valkyrie,3czzbc,lolredditor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:49:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed. While the Warcraft one I would categorize as ""neat"", it is underwhelming.  Though I feel like for a while in the beginning before a consumer headset is released, we will see a handful of small teaser experiences, most probably not properly calibrated for VR."
valkyrie,3czzbc,darkwater_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:26:15 2015 UTC,"YT360° would be great, but I hope we see the jump format up and running in time for the next trailer or the next after.  Something tells me we won't see jumps running on YouTube until an official headset is released, so probably after the Vive is out."

We work with a larger group that reserves that big space, but we only have a very small part of it.  We'll be doing demos of EVE: Valkyrie and Project Nemesis for press and business partners there.  But if you have a Business Center pass, please do stop by.  I'm sure EVE: Valkyrie will be on the consumer show floor somewhere, but we don't have anything to announce right now."

valkyrie,3bkhka,HappierShibe,2,Tue Jun 30 10:22:10 2015 UTC,"I would imagine no-one yet. The due date for the latest survey was July 1st, so they probably haven't sent out this wave of invites yet."

valkyrie,3bkhka,StuffedDeadTurkey,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:39:12 2015 UTC,I'll assume you didn't get selected this time around since it was for today and tomorrow.

valkyrie,3bfgz4,MarioneTTe-Doll,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:18:41 2015 UTC,I can either switch to default cursor for you or add a thick white border to the existing one.  I think based on community feedback it looks like we will change it to a default cursor.
valkyrie,3bfgz4,darkwater_,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:40:24 2015 UTC,Cursor pointer turns the mouse into a hand. It's standard web development to tell users that what you're hovering over can be clicked. It shouldn't override any of your custom styles as cursor pointer is a default system icon which again defaults to whatever you've set as custom.  TL;DR: it shouldn't affect colour blindness settings.
valkyrie,3bfgz4,AWetAndFloppyNoodle,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:40:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks. :) The debris is a non-animated transparent PNG that is just set to scroll and repeat across the header.  At the moment I am working on making the larger of the two planets rotate though and I plan on adding the spaceship traffic in the background in the distance between the two planets.  edit: The two new features will pretty much use the same method as the debris, though the planet will use a rotation script."

valkyrie,3bf54a,Ashterothi,8,Sun Jun 28 20:04:18 2015 UTC,"Last time I dug into it it (a couple weeks back) it looks like they are being coy. They haven't officially said ""will be exclusive to oculus rift"". Oculus has kinda implied it a few times, but all CCP has said is that it's exclusively for VR.   At one point they said it would support a variety of VR headsets but that it's being built for oculus rift right now , BUT THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. They seem to be avoiding deliberately denying exclusivity at present. My guess is it was easy before to not say anything, because there weren't really any competitors out there, and now they are having to figure out what their stance is and make a decision."
valkyrie,3bf54a,HappierShibe,3,Sun Jun 28 19:40:49 2015 UTC,"ok thanks for the info, I hope they will at least create clarity about this before november."
valkyrie,3bf54a,HappierShibe,2,Sun Jun 28 20:24:01 2015 UTC,You and me both! I'm still going back and forth between Vive/Rift at this point. But the vives earlier arrival date really has it's hooks in.
valkyrie,3bf54a,RaizinMonk,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:44:29 2015 UTC,"There's still a lot of information we are missing that could turn the tables between the two for VR enthusiasts.

Of course long term wise the best solution would be to wait a little while after the Rift's release until the dust settles and there have been plenty reviews and comparisons.

valkyrie,3bf54a,dinklebob,3,Mon Jun 29 10:32:40 2015 UTC,"The real thing to note is that if the VR hardware developers can agree on a universal standard for conveying positional input to the games, then it would be relatively simple to have pretty much any VR hardware interface with a VR program. Mods/hacks could be developed to let the Vive (the platform I anticipate the most) perform with an Oculus-exclusive title."
valkyrie,3bf54a,klyith,3,Sun Jun 28 20:29:17 2015 UTC,"Cross-compatibility among at least the big three (oculus, morpheus, & valve vr) is supposedly pretty good. The hardware penetration at the start is going to be so tiny, nobody making a game with real budget would want to be exclusive to one platform. Probably the only exclusives will be more tech-demo-ish games made to show off each of the devices."
valkyrie,3bf54a,HappierShibe,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:30:47 2015 UTC,1st party oculus titles will probably be exclusive as well.
valkyrie,3bf54a,Geos13,2,Wed Jul 1 17:53:47 2015 UTC,I couldn't find my source for this comment but I swear I saw a comment from someone associated with the project saying it would be a timed exclusive.  The best I could find: http://www.pcgamer.com/eve-valkyrie-is-exclusive-on-the-oculus-on-pc-at-the-moment/
valkyrie,3bf54a,Mikeyone77,3,Mon Jun 29 05:08:13 2015 UTC,even if it is exclusive as long as it is on pc people will find a way around the exclusivity.

valkyrie,3bepjo,ZhouDengSun,-1,Sun Jun 28 22:38:47 2015 UTC,She was in a crowd. :)
valkyrie,3bepjo,TalkingBackAgain,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:45:48 2015 UTC,"Yes. You were chasing the guy and you finally got him. The elation from seeing them go BOOM.  Source: have played EVE Valkyrie, the release can be visceral :-).  This girl is living the moment. Also, you're -only- seeing that screen, that is the whole universe for you at that time. You're not playing to the crowd, you're in your version of the universe. What everybody else thinks is not important, you can't see them, you can't hear them.  She's using the stick too much though, she wasn't tracking movement with her head enough. But that's personal preference."
valkyrie,3bepjo,ZhouDengSun,2,Mon Jun 29 05:50:45 2015 UTC,"Oh come on, she's definitely not into that game so much. Look at her chewing gum. If she's definitely in the moment, she wouldn't be chewing it in such a way."
valkyrie,3bepjo,TalkingBackAgain,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:25:13 2015 UTC,"That's a call you just can't make. You don't know how someone else experiences the universe.  I make a lot of arrogant statements, you will rarely see me say that I know what the universe is like for someone else."
valkyrie,3bepjo,ZhouDengSun,2,Mon Jun 29 21:34:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know how to read the mind of a 5 year old either, but I know when he or she is lying. What terrible excuses."
valkyrie,3bepjo,TalkingBackAgain,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:50:15 2015 UTC,That doesn't even apply here.  Have you actually played Valkyrie?
valkyrie,3bepjo,ZhouDengSun,-5,Tue Jun 30 03:50:43 2015 UTC,"You know it's a childish outburst for attention. The manneurism is already there. We've all done this when we were kids at our friend's house and we know why we did it. ""Look how rad I can be! Look at me!"""
valkyrie,3bepjo,kristallnachte,3,Sun Jun 28 19:18:47 2015 UTC,when playing crucible in destiny I sometimes do that even when I'm playing alone.
valkyrie,3bepjo,ZhouDengSun,-4,Sun Jun 28 19:26:09 2015 UTC,"Manneurism is key. Do you do all the exaggerated hand motions and facial expression? Come on, don't be a social retard (for lack of better words, not as an insult to you). I do say ""Fuck yeah, bitch!"" if I'm really excited about killing some irritating player, but I don't let go of the controller and make a DoyaGao/ドヤ顔(for lack of better words in english). It's very forced."
valkyrie,3bepjo,kristallnachte,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:40:35 2015 UTC,Yup...so forced...  You have no idea how that person plays alone.
valkyrie,3bepjo,ZhouDengSun,-4,Sun Jun 28 20:35:25 2015 UTC,And it doesn't matter. You see forced mannerisms when you spot it.
valkyrie,3bepjo,kristallnachte,2,Sun Jun 28 22:27:42 2015 UTC,"Yup.  Here we have a guy that thinks you knows everyones life story after 15 seconds of looking at you.  Y'know, you're posting is rather forced. Real middle school boy behavior."
valkyrie,3bepjo,ZhouDengSun,-2,Sun Jun 28 22:54:04 2015 UTC,"Nay. I have explained the reasoning behind her forced gestures. You have not. :) Nice try at turning it around though, got to give you credit for that."

Thanks a bunch!  /u/HolloH designed the theme I used to make it.   2) I really hate the cursor changing from arror to hand and back over agin. it's wierd; plus no I cursor when over text fields..   This seems to be a common complaint so far, so I am thinking of possibly changing it.   3) subscribe button is two-line for me   Browser and resolution you're using?   4) title (the /r/valkyrie: ???) is two line for me   Same question as before.  It looks like perhaps you are browsing with a mobile device?  Here is how it should roughly look, though even this is slightly improper due to me using someone elses computer right now and zoomed out a bit in the browser.  IMAGE"

valkyrie,3bfjhe,Vrappel,5,Sun Jun 28 19:47:32 2015 UTC,"You won't suffer from not having the EVE experience at all.  Valkyrie is based on, but does not play in, the actual EVE universe itself. You won't be on TQ [EVE's active server].  What is going to happen is that you're going to meet a lot of knowledgeable players there who will know really soon you're not an EVE player [you can fake it for about a minute or so, or until you make your first 'I really haven't got a clue' comment].  However, Valkyrie is great fun and as soon as CCP release it, I'm buying it. I expected to be able to do that already but at this point I don't know when that faithful moment will be."
valkyrie,3bfjhe,TalkingBackAgain,2,Sun Jun 28 20:42:28 2015 UTC,All the info we have right now ( unless anyone beta testing wants to break the NDA and confirm otherwise ) indicates that Valkyrie is a completely stand alone game set in the Eve Online Universe.
valkyrie,3bfjhe,kosssaw,2,Sun Jun 28 21:46:39 2015 UTC,"As of now, Valkyrie will currently be standalone, but within the EVE universe. However, I've heard that they want to have integration after the game is up and running. I kinda want for my actions to help the Gallente, like I do in Dust 514."
valkyrie,3bfjhe,Phoenix_Potato,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:44:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think there will be any integration to start with,  That's a good thing.  It pretty much killed DUST 514."
