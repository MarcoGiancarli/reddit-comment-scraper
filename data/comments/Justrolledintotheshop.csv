Justrolledintotheshop,3e250x,youAreAllRetards,12,Tue Jul 21 12:30:46 2015 UTC,would this really work or are you joking? I have a very slow leak from a finishing/tack nail that is so small I would have to perform surgery to remove... RTV on the other hand....
Justrolledintotheshop,3e250x,Tissue285,27,Tue Jul 21 15:32:17 2015 UTC,No that wouldn't work he's joking. For a small puncture like that you can absolutely use a tire plug.
Justrolledintotheshop,3e250x,HersheyHWY,21,Tue Jul 21 15:33:54 2015 UTC,not with that attitude. Thanks for the info though.
Justrolledintotheshop,3e250x,Tissue285,4,Tue Jul 21 15:36:16 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't plug a pinhole leak... I'd put a small patch on the inside, rubber cement, and roll it with the nubby roller thing to make sure it adheres well. Using a tire plug for a pinhole is like saying that stitches are necessary for papercuts, just gotta rip that wound open a little wider so it actually needs stitches.  Now that I'm on the subject, you should never use tire plugs as more than a temporary repair anyway. Throws the tire out of balance and it's not safe at high speeds. Patch it from the inside or junk the tire. Or do whatever, who the fuck cares anymore."
Justrolledintotheshop,3e250x,TheBapster,93,Tue Jul 21 18:51:58 2015 UTC,I plugged a hole with two plugs one time. This was over a year ago and I've put about 18k miles on it without even a slow leak. This many though... eh plus it looks like the sidewall is budging

The problem is the owner probably spent 500$ on a new tyre and doesn't want to replace it because of a bulge, when it has 10mm of tread left. When you explain to them what happened and what will happen, they usually change their opinion. Some mount it on a trailer. We have a lot of trucks on 385/65 R 22.5 in Europe both on steering and trailer axles, so it's an easy decision. I don't condone it, but it is a little safer than leaving it on the steering axle."

In the case of a screw/nail or other small puncture, they work much better to get you home than fix-a-flat, and I've safely driven on them for 20k miles before my tire needed to be replaced. Just make sure you use the ream tool to smooth out the hole first, and be sure to coat the plug in rubber cement. Oh, and make sure it's at least one tread in from the sidewall. The plugs installed on the inside are better in the long term, but a rope plug can be put in on the side of the road without even taking the tire/wheel off."

Justrolledintotheshop,3dy4if,mpguidry,107,Mon Jul 20 14:13:28 2015 UTC,I doubt that fuse ever blew.  It melted from a poor connection (probably corrosion) on the left leg.  This created a lot of heat near the fuse casing even though the current through the fuse itself was likely just fine.  I've seen the same thing happen to a circuit breaker in a home - loose connection melts the casing even while not overloaded enough to trip the breaker.

Justrolledintotheshop,3dy4if,JoshyRhain,4,Mon Jul 20 20:39:26 2015 UTC,"I had a old motorcycle that would turn the ignition fuse (glass type 25 amp)  into a resistor every three months or so.  Fuse was never blown, but the bike would shut off or not start.  Sometimes the metal end would be hot enough to burn my hand.  My theory was it was running so close to blowing it was tempering it somehow.   Ever heard of anything like that?"
Justrolledintotheshop,3dy4if,tollfreecallsonly,3,Tue Jul 21 04:29:33 2015 UTC,"Glass fuses are notorious for this. Electrical joins that handle high current have a compounding affect on small amounts of resistance. For example, if the fuse holder is dirty, the resistance will cause heat, and the heat will corrode the contact points, creating higher resistance. The higher resistance will cause more heat and it bends the metal etc. The cycle continues until there is no current flow."

Justrolledintotheshop,3dy4if,Beastlykings,14,Tue Jul 21 09:37:55 2015 UTC,"I try with my bad english. i have the same problem in my motorbike and i discovery the problem.   After few fuses melt,  i investigate and discovery its was bad cables problem.  Normally in case of motorbikes, that trouble reside in the cable section from alternator to regulator or  from regulator to fuse box since that sections support the greatest amp/current before split in the fuse box.  My problem was in the regulator to fuse box but i found that problem in other bikes in the alternator part.  Its common problem on Triumphs motorcycles with 955 engines.  The cause its the bad quality of this cables and the excessive amps/current for that cable section. Over time the heat  burned/damage the cable and each time amps/electricity  circulate with more resistance and heat more and more.  The heat extend to the fuse box or to the regulator,  causing a failure in the regulator or in the best case a fuse melt  In my case i lift the fuse box and under it, i can see the cable  clearly damage by the heat in that end (fuse box was partially melt too)  This can cause a fire.  A bad/loose connection can cause that too, vibrations -> sparks -> excessive heat -> Fuse melt.  Fix it changing that cable with better cable (copper quality) or better increase the cable section. Or fix the loose connection in the other case."

Justrolledintotheshop,3dy4if,mckrayjones,3,Mon Jul 20 17:06:42 2015 UTC,So what do they do for fuses in space then?
Justrolledintotheshop,3dy4if,rudieboy,7,Mon Jul 20 17:16:52 2015 UTC,"Neither thermal (bimetallic strip) nor magnetic (solenoid-driven) circuit breakers would be adversely affected by a lack of gravity.  Common household breakers use a combination of the two - the thermal trips on a small overload over a long period of time, the magnetic trips instantly on a large enough overload.  Either one tripping forces the breaker open, in a combined breaker.  I can't see how either would be in any way inconvenienced by a lack of air, either.  Although temperature could be a different story entirely."

I have a friend who actually works for the ISS but she wasn't sure either and never did get back to me and it's not the kind of thing worth bothering her about.  If I had to guess I'd say some sort of spring-loaded circuit breaker like you've got in your house.  Either that or they're using air flow to simulate the effects of gravity the same way they make sure sleeping areas are well circulated so you don't poison yourself in your sleep by a stagnant cloud of exhaled carbon dioxide.

Justrolledintotheshop,3dy4if,OnTheNuts,4,Tue Jul 21 03:58:36 2015 UTC,"There's actually a real failure mode for fuses where they still conduct, until the power goes away. You have to have a LOT of power though. Enough power that you don't just melt the fuse, but you turn it straight into plasma - which is like a gas, but so hot and energetic that the electrons aren't associated with the nucleus of each atom anymore. And it conducts electricity really well, as a result. It's a steady state, if you're supplying that much current, and it'll last until the current stops for some reason - like everything downstream of it is fucked up enough to stop conducting. Then the plasma condenses into burned powder."

Justrolledintotheshop,3dyc35,Crometer,30,Mon Jul 20 17:46:23 2015 UTC,Just because a tire is rated for that pressure does not mean it's the correct inflation pressure.

Justrolledintotheshop,3dyc35,Crometer,15,Mon Jul 20 19:52:54 2015 UTC,"Simple really, the vehicle manufacturer even did the math for you.  The correct inflation pressure is listed on a tag or sticker on the edge of the driver's door or on the doorframe.  It takes into account the proper size tire for the vehicle and what pressure is needed to properly inflate that tire at the ""curb"" weight (weight with fuel and one passenger) of the vehicle.  Just check the sticker.  If the sticker is missing (and it really should not be since it also has the VIN barcoded on it) you'll find the same info in the owner's manual."

Justrolledintotheshop,3dyc35,TheOnlyHighlander,8,Mon Jul 20 20:02:49 2015 UTC,Unless you're going very drastically larger or smaller it's not going to make enough difference to matter.  Go by what the sticker says.

Justrolledintotheshop,3dyc35,TheOnlyHighlander,6,Mon Jul 20 20:20:36 2015 UTC,If you do end up with a very different size set of tires you can use the weight info from the tag on the vehicle and load charts for that size tire from the tire manufacturer to find out what the proper inflation pressure should be.
Justrolledintotheshop,3dyc35,eldergeekprime,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:24:48 2015 UTC,"The problem with those numbers is if you never drive the vehicle empty you have to guess the correct pressure.  I used to always have edge wear on my tires till I figured out the number was way too low for my load, so I increased it 10 psi and the wear is much more even now.  They should really require them to print two numbers: A number for 1 driver no cargo, and completely full with adults and cargo (or whatever the max rating is).  Then people could at least extrapolate between those two number for various loads - might not be perfect, but way better than just guessing."
Justrolledintotheshop,3dyc35,asr,4,Mon Jul 20 21:02:56 2015 UTC,Don't all manufacturers do that? All the vehicles I've seen have had numbers for different loads and speeds. SAAB evem has for different tyre sizes!

Justrolledintotheshop,3dyc35,krakissi,26,Mon Jul 20 17:33:00 2015 UTC,But how it didn't explode after going past 80PSI is beyond me. Most are rated at 40(ish) PSI max pressure.
Justrolledintotheshop,3dyc35,InactiveUser,23,Mon Jul 20 18:23:08 2015 UTC,Because they can handle much more pressure than the number. Think about just how much force there is on the tire if you hit a pothole at speed.  Or even something as simple as bumping down a curb.  The number is intended to take into account potholes and other dynamic load. It's not the actual pressure the tire can handle.

Justrolledintotheshop,3dzvn2,DavidsUsername,13,Mon Jul 20 23:48:32 2015 UTC,Really can't over do it. Just make a note that it's in there so u don't hydro lock it many years down the road. Usually u take the plugs out and crank it over a bunch of times to eject all of the oil. Then replace plugs and about 250 other things and start it up. It will smoke like a freight train but it will clear up.
Justrolledintotheshop,3dzvn2,tjandearl,9,Mon Jul 20 23:59:38 2015 UTC,"If you look at the cars at Henry Ford Museum, you will see a metal pan underneath, with a common red fluid on it. The cars on long term exhibit have ATF in the engine, trans, and rear end. Obviously if they were to be driven, the ATF would have to be replaced with oil.  But you are right to use it to try to free the engine up and loosen up the dirt. I even use it to shut up noisy lifters since Ford's, VW's and Audi's have lifters known for collecting dirt. A quarter or half bottle of ATF, depending on oil capacity, works every time."

Justrolledintotheshop,3dzvn2,hollowlefty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:41:56 2015 UTC,By the same token you can on most straight sixes.
Justrolledintotheshop,3dzvn2,greasyEUtech,4,Tue Jul 21 17:06:37 2015 UTC,That's kind of the point of having a long inline engine is the more cylinders the more balanced if it's engineered to be that way. I don't really know all the sciencey stuff off the top of my head but I know that is why BMW used a straight 6 for so many applications. In BMW school they used to harp on how the straight six was smoother than other platforms.
Justrolledintotheshop,3dzvn2,tjandearl,6,Mon Jul 20 23:50:25 2015 UTC,BMW sixes get that silky smoothness from two 120 degree triples mirroring each other.  The whole mirrored rotating assembly thing works wonderfully at canceling it's own vibrations.  Sort of a mechanical version of a humbucker guitar pickup. In fact this works increasingly well as the number of cylinders goes up.  An ideal straight 8 would be even smoother as it has the mirrored goodness with the more frequent power pulses .  The shakiness that fubaru was referring to is rather the flexing of the crank itself.  As a member becomes longer it is more subject to bending and breaking.  That is why they stopped making them back in the day.  They haven't resumed making them due to the sheer size of engine bay that would require.  Pity.
Justrolledintotheshop,3dzvn2,Shamroc_14,2,Tue Jul 21 01:27:07 2015 UTC,^ yeah what he said... I haven't read up on this specific thing or been to any classes in a long time but that all rang bells in my memory chambers.
Justrolledintotheshop,3dzvn2,xcrackpotfoxx,2,Tue Jul 21 02:53:53 2015 UTC,"BMW sixes are sexy motors, love them.  Bulletproof, at least the base of it.  In the later models it was because everything attached to the block was plastic :-("
Justrolledintotheshop,3dzvn2,Shamroc_14,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:55:16 2015 UTC,"So out of curiosity, could you have say, a 3liter inline 12 with cylinders half the size of a current BMW I6, but because you have more explosions, it would be smoother?  And because the cylinders are so small, you could still have a shorter crank.  I wonder if this is applicable at all. And if so, why isn't it being done? W12s are not smooth at all."
Justrolledintotheshop,3dzvn2,xcrackpotfoxx,2,Tue Jul 21 07:20:08 2015 UTC,"Then you would have the issue of low displacement. It works for F1 because 20k rpm, but in a road car where people want torque, you need a little displacement to help out with torque."
Justrolledintotheshop,3dzvn2,Shamroc_14,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:00:47 2015 UTC,"Maybe it would be a good hybrid system. You could get instant torque from electric, in addition to a high revving gas or diesel. Even more efficient with start stop."
Justrolledintotheshop,3dzvn2,EllisHughTiger,2,Tue Jul 21 14:00:48 2015 UTC,"You can get a v8 to be as smooth as you want for a luxury car, or as high revving as you want for a Racing type scenario. It would be less than half as long as a straight 12, and about half as long as a straight 8. Really, itjust wouldn't make sense to go  that route. In addition, a v12 is 2 straight 6es put together and is also perfectly balanced, while being half as long as a straight 12. It doesn't make sense to make an inline engine longer than 6 cylinders, in my personal not-yet-engineer opinion."

Justrolledintotheshop,3dzvn2,DavidsUsername,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:42:38 2015 UTC,"That darn practicality get's in the way of all the really interesting motors! An inline twelve would be endless fun to mess around with, but for actual use a v12 is what you want.  IIRC the 90 degree v on those things somehow makes everything work out extra nicely to the point where crank counterweights are no longer necessary, thus contributing to the rev-ability of the configuration.    The only practical-ish (emphsais on the ish) way to get a straight 12 that wouldn't be comically long would be to go the VW staggered route.  But that would throw the whole 'really long inline engine' thing out the window.  As long as we're talking hypothetical though... I want one.  Make that two. Overkill is underrated."
Justrolledintotheshop,3dzvn2,CGumina,0,Tue Jul 21 19:00:48 2015 UTC,"surely with modern metals and a relatively small displacement this could be overcome, though."
Justrolledintotheshop,3dzvn2,schicksal_,5,Tue Jul 21 06:53:29 2015 UTC,"The long crank only lowers the max RPM, as the longer the crank, the lower the RPM of self destructing harmonics.
