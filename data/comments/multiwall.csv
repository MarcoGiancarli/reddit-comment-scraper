multiwall,397diz,Frozeth29,11,Tue Jun 9 20:02:23 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing, the computer IS actually outputting the same signal (color, tone, brightness, contrast, ect) to both monitors. The difference you perceive between them is the actual monitor display and its settings, no program can tell what it looks like on your side of the screen. What you can do is calibrate one or both of the moniters to get them as similar as possible so you can't tell the difference.    First up, if there is the option, use a DVI plug instead of VGA, as VGA is standard definition and HDMI is obviously High Definition. this wont effect the color, tone, brghtness ect, but it will mean that one moniter has a more crisp, sharper image.    So to get the moniters the same, there are different calibration tools available but i think that the windows one is sufficient enough. Go to control panel, then in the search bar start typing 'calibrate display' and it should narrow results down so you see the link on the left. Now its a simple as running through this calibration wizard, using the buttons/controls on the monitors themselves, until you have both as close as possible to each other."
multiwall,397diz,Drunken-samurai,3,Tue Jun 9 23:40:19 2015 UTC,"thanks, I'll check it out! I figured the output was the same, but hoped there was a program that could change the settings, but that's a ridiculous notion since there are an incredible variety of monitors available."

I don't have a lot of experience with it, but I did work with such a set-up at my old IT job in college.  We only used the machine for mostly command line operations, where that particular set-up shines. However, I would never want to game on it; 4 vertical breaks would be distracting. Perhaps it could be used for general office work. Again, the only experience I have was for specific work.  As for technical set-up, I believe that particular machine had two nvidia cards SLI'd together, thus providing 6 total outputs, 4 DVI and 2 HDMI. All 1080p monitors, so all in all, 5400x1920 resolution, which would be very annoying to work with, since that ratio is quite rare.  Hope this helps."

Long ago some of my wallpapers made it on to your ""guest wallpaper"" section and it was one of the highlights of my teenage life.

multiwall,32tc0q,TraphicCone,3,Fri Apr 17 02:41:35 2015 UTC,"What's exactly the problem?  Is it not filling the 2 screens?  Are you trying to make sure the image isn't stretched or broken across the two screens?  If it's the second one, I constantly deal with a similar problem.  I have two 22"" monitors surrounding a 24"".  I haven't found software that will automatically deal with the size difference, so for each image I stick in photoshop and do some math and some trimming.  You can find monitor size ratios here.  I have a 16:9 22"" and 16:9  24"" so the the height difference ratio is 27/30.  So I cut off 3/30's of the left and right monitors pixels.  Then stretch the left and right up to fill the entire screen.  The end result will look like this, but when you set it as a background it fills it perfectly.  I'd imagine you could do something similar for a vertical setup."
multiwall,32tc0q,TraphicCone,1 point,Thu Apr 16 17:25:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly the second one. It's a gaming PC/HTPC with the TV above the gaming monitor.

multiwall,2zvyfg,jt121,4,Sun Mar 22 07:55:35 2015 UTC,A trick I've used for making large wallpapers is to take a wallpaper you like and make it bigger by adding the colour from outer edges of the original and fill in the blanks. Not a great explanation. Here's some pictures to demonstrate: It's not perfect but if you take more time you can make them a lot better. If you don't have photoshop you can get a 30 day trial or 'acquire it'.

multiwall,2z9vne,YouKnowABitJonSnow,2,Mon Mar 16 20:50:49 2015 UTC,Looks about as good as it can. Why not find a wallpaper that doesn't split the image in the middle? That's 90% of the problem.
multiwall,2z9vne,FukinGruven,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:12:32 2015 UTC,"I have the same setup, with two 1080p monitors, but the right monitor is slightly smaller at 21.5"" and the larger is 23.6"".  I use wallpapers that stretch across both, but don't have features directly in the middle of the screen.  Your picture is an example of why that doesn't work for me.  Personally, it's less about the size and more about 2 bezels in the way.  I would look for a neutral background or something that has one or two distinct features, but nothing in the middle.    A good example of wallpapers that do that well are images I'm linking here.  As you can see, the portal wallpaper has nothing in the middle, since it switches monitors.  The next two with the starburst and the tron bike both have focal points on one monitor, but activity on the other as well.  I'm not a huge fan of wallpapers that have one subject on one side and nothing on the other.  The last image is one of my favorites, since it's very busy and colorful, but does it in a way where there is no main subject."
multiwall,2z9vne,Onite44,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:46:40 2015 UTC,"Hey man, if that didn't fix your problem, you could use scaling to get it right, split the picture in the middle, then enlarge the right by the ratio 23.6/21.5, then crop to get it back to the right resolution."

multiwall,2yapvc,narcoblix,1 point,Sun Mar 8 01:49:38 2015 UTC,"These wallpapers where rendered using the custom path tracer written by reddit user /u/0ctobox.  The first two images are actually slightly larger than 3840 x 1080, but their aspect ratio is the same as that of 3840 x 1080. The second pair of images are the original 4k renders that  the cropped images are taken from.    A little bit of information about these images:  These renders are done using a method called ""path tracing"", a method which can yield lighting that is perfectly faithful to reality. The downside is that it takes a huge amount of time to render: the original 4k images took an Intel i7-2670QM (quad core with hyperthreading) ~5 hours per image to render.  The renderer for these images is a short, simple implementation written by the reddit user /u/0ctobox. Additionally the model of the dragon has been kindly provided by the Stanford University Computer Graphics Laboratory, who kindly provide many high quality scanned models for use by anyone.    If you would like to download the original source PNG images (since imgur turns them into compressed jpegs), they can be found in this directory. Feel free to use them however you wish.    Just to be clear: these images where rendered and tweaked be me (/u/narcoblix), but the source code for the rendering software was written by reddit user /u/0ctobox."

multiwall,2x5v60,slackware93,5,Wed Feb 25 22:16:42 2015 UTC,I'd love to know how you made those tessellated sphere's around the cubes.  Are these individual cylinders connected by small spheres (all geometry) or is this simply a tesselated sphere with a material/effect applied at rendertime?  I'm a Maya user so blender-specific terms will be alien to me :).
multiwall,2x5v60,Shinji246,3,Wed Feb 25 22:38:12 2015 UTC,"The blender specific terms are actually pretty general so you should be able to understand:  I created an icosphere, applied a modifier called ""Wireframe"" which literally turns your mesh into a wireframe (you can change the thickness of the 'wires'). I then parented a small sphere to the larger wireframe-icosphere and used a feature called duplicate with the parameter set to Verts. What it does is duplicates the child object (small sphere) and places a copy of it at each vertex on the larger icosphere. I hope that makes sense!?"
multiwall,2x5v60,Shinji246,2,Wed Feb 25 23:32:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah that totally makes sense, although I've never heard of an icosphere :)  Thanks for the explanation, it's nice to see some OC walls!"

multiwall,2w4d61,ledfordka,3,Mon Feb 16 21:46:29 2015 UTC,"Here's my modus operandi for creating wallpapers for any topic.   Step 1. Go to google image search. Click on Search tools and click Size -> Larger than 4 MP (or 2 MP if you really can't find anything)  Step 2. Download your base images. Thankfully, Google lead me to a web page that has links to a bunch of really high res pictures  Step 3. Fire up photoshop. There should be ways to do this on any photo editing software, but I know photoshop. Select the crop tool and set the options to Ratio, with 32x9 as the resolution. Crop your image to whatever you want. If you want to center your image/enlarge certain features and keep blank spaces, you can if you're brave. If you don't thats fine, just skip steps 4 and maybe 5.  Step 4. Fill in the blank edges using content aware filling. Select the empty space with the magic wand, then click edit->fill. Make sure content aware is selected. Now, you should get something that looks like this  Step 5. Doctor your image so that it looks nice. You're going to be mainly using the clone stamp, healing brush, spot healing brush, and other easy image doctoring things, then going in and editing details.  Step 6. Save your image. You typically want the initial image to be as high res as possible, but then just save versions. Use File->save for web to customize how you want the exported file to be. I suggest PNGs  This results in a nice 3840x1080 wallpaper made just for you! I'm so nice that I decided to throw in a 5120x1440 wallpaper if you ever decide to upgrade!  Alternatively, run your games in eyefinity across your monitors and take screenshots that way, but this is more useful knowledge :)"

multiwall,2u98pw,LordOfDemise,2,Sat Jan 31 06:49:24 2015 UTC,"Photoshop works with raster images. Raster is probably what you're used to: fixed canvas size, and an image made up of different-colored pixels. Zoom in and it gets ""pixelated"" because you can see the individual pixels and that breaks the illusion.    Vector images don't use pixels, they use math. Instead of putting points on a canvas, you basically define the lines and curves that make up an image. So you can zoom in infinitely without losing any clarity.    I'm sure the Wikipedia article could explain it better than me though."
multiwall,2u98pw,autowikibot,2,Sat Jan 31 19:13:40 2015 UTC,"Vector graphics:       Vector graphics is the use of geometrical primitives such as points, lines, curves, and shapes or polygons—all of which are based on mathematical expressions—to represent images in computer graphics. Vector graphics are based on vectors (also called paths), which lead through locations called control points or nodes. Each of these points has a definite position on the x and y axes of the work plane and determines the direction of the path; further, each path may be assigned a stroke color, shape, thickness, and fill. These properties don't increase the size of vector graphics files in a substantial manner, as all information resides in the document's structure, which describes solely how the vector should be drawn. [citation needed]    Image i - Example showing effect of vector graphics versus raster graphics. The original vector-based illustration is at the left. The upper-right image illustrates magnification of 7x as a vector graphic. The lower-right illustrates the same magnification as a raster (bitmap) graphic. Raster images are based on pixels and so when scaled there is a loss of clarity, while vector-based graphics can be scaled by any amount without degrading quality.

multiwall,2qh658,Pluxar,3,Fri Dec 26 21:34:30 2014 UTC,"It isn't possible. When you increase the size of a picture you are adding pixels that don't exist so whatever program you are using has to 'guess' what should be there. In Photoshop you can select some different options for re-sampling which will effect how the new pixels are created.   Aside from that you just have to be creative about how you scale up an image. If the background is easily replicated like space or sky you can try to leave the original image untouched and add more background and try to match the original style, colors and patterns. If there is an obvious focal point like a person or object you can try isolating it and just scaling the background, this works pretty well if the background isn't in the plane of focus and the scaling won't be as visible."
multiwall,2qh658,TangerineX,1 point,Fri Dec 26 21:57:52 2014 UTC,"There are some nifty techniques to give images a little boost while making it look ok, such as using saliency maps to find a path of lowest saliency and to duplicate it. Photoshop also does some smart scaling to preserve sharpness (or you can manually use the sharpness tool to give things a boost).This should be ok in, lets say boosting an image from 1920x1080 to 1920x1200  But you're right, in general you can't increase the DPI of an image without some serious doctoring."

Someone else might be willing to do that for you, but that involves a bit more work than the typical request given to this subreddit, so I'm not sure how much help you'll get."
multiwall,2p9w3q,crippledplaything,1 point,Mon Dec 15 05:02:51 2014 UTC,"/u/majorscheiskopf gave some great advice. I would check the settings, see if you can get it at 3840x1080 if you want a wallpaper from just one of the images.   I would also maybe do some Googling and see if there is a kind of ""camera mode"" that you can use to remove the little crouch/circle pieces above the animal and whatnot. In The Sims, for example, you can enter camera mode and it will remove the menus and things on the screen. Not sure if this game has it, but it's worth a shot. Maybe post it over to the /r/farcry4 subreddit and see what advice they can give you? :)"
