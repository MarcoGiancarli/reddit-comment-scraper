Welding,3e4mu6,Kiriesh,2,Tue Jul 21 22:38:09 2015 UTC,"It's a Millermatic 135 with the cart (sadly no gas), bought it off my boss for $450. I've done a bit of welding here and there with buddies but never had the ability to practice on my own and actually get good until now. It's only been used a handful of times (he bought new and is still on the original tank fill he bought with it). I'll probably be using flux core in the near future while I shop around for a good tank (hopefully used in good condition). Anyways, just excited to get more into metal working and thought I'd share!"
Welding,3e4mu6,jim314159,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:40:58 2015 UTC,Its a recent model and seems like a solid bargain for $450. Agree with Seamus that you can rent a tank for peanuts and it makes your life easier than dealing with flux cored wire. Airgas sold me a smaller C25 tank for about $165 which lasts a hobbyist forever.  Just don't expect it to weld 3/8 plate with a single pass and you'll enjoy it.

Welding,3dyixt,austenite,7,Mon Jul 20 19:23:20 2015 UTC,I've worked -25F and I'm calling bullshit on not getting cold.  I fucking hate working in the cold without a hooch out on the side of a shovel boom trying to fill a crack you know is going to break because you can't keep any measurable amount of preheat in the steel you're welding on.  Or when the crank case ventilation freezes up and blows the dipstick out of your air pack (which is freezing up all your pneumatic tools by blowing straight up ice down the line) draining all the oil in the engine compartment before you notice it smoking.  You can keep the cold.  Best thing about being an inspector is not having to spool up 100' of lead after 14 hours of getting my ass kicked by the Wyoming wind on a -25F day. /rant
Welding,3dyixt,Doopsy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:51:37 2015 UTC,Personally I loved working in the cold. I was welding enough to keep warm all day.

As a student you really won't have a need for a close quarters hood and you won't be working with the sun at your back. For what you'll be doing you'd probably be better off with something like a fixed shade Jackson with the larger 4 1/2 x 5 1/4"" lens and sturdier headgear.  Trust me, I own both hoods and have a lot of time welding professionally under both of them. A bare-bones $40 Jacksòn is really all you need for most conditions.

Picked up a fibre metal pipeliner and an arc one shade 10.5 ADF.  No flipping from lights or sun, I can wear it all day and it doesn't bother me. Only thing I had to change was that rubber band- get a piece of latex tubing and tie it in there to fit. Now that I'm working outside everyday, I'm so glad I got it. I've had glare inside it one time and the sun was perfect for that weld. Plus, I get sparks down my shirt way less now running flux core overhead about 50% of the time.   Gold 10s are also great, I got one to learn passives and it was wonderful. Then I had to kill it making a mirror set up for my current job. Auto dark is just so much more convenient though.

Grinding/torch cutting will still flip it though, but for those I just wear glasses that fit my face like a glove. Haven't had a really bad experience with metal in my eyes yet, although sparks on the face will get ya sometimes."

I wouldn't spend money on special lenses until you get a feel for what you need.  they should have spare lenses you can use at the school.  the reason I say this is because you don't even know if a shade 10 is right for you yet.  it very well might be too light

Seems like the pipeliner is a decent choice, just will take some extra practise using a passive over auto darkening.   If I were to get a decent auto darkening lense in the event I don't like having to flip the hood all the time, what should I look for? Im assuming there are different quality lenses out there!  In terms of people mentioning modifying the pipe liner; why is that? Are you just talking about shortening it a bit and adding a leather bib of sorts to make it a bit more comfortable or?"
Welding,3e0v0j,Blue_Cypress,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:14:00 2015 UTC,"The rubber band it comes with sucks, almost everybody replaces it, a lot of people (including myself) replace it with a piece of surgical tube (order it at the same time as your hood if ordering through Amazon).  The hood is long so most people cut about an inch off the bottom so they can look down without the hood hitting them in the chest. Some people cut the top off too to lighten it (even though it's about the lightest hood you'll find).  I purchased mine in school and have been using one ever since. I have modified one with an inch cut from the bottom and a flip front adapter so that I can grind with it and I have one untouched so that it provides maximum protection when welding overhead.  They are great hoods."

Welding,3dzscg,OMW,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:03:02 2015 UTC,OK.  I knew there would be some additional equipment required; is any one suitcase feeder better than another?  My guess is to buy the Miller feeder with the Miller welder and so on.  Thanks for the reply.
Welding,3dzscg,canweld,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:37:07 2015 UTC,"For suitcase feeders, I think the Lincoln LN-25 is pretty much the gold standard of the industry. Here's mine  The only Miller suitcase I've owned was an older early 1990's built S-22 (this was before Miller switched to the heavier ""Pelican case"" style housings) and honestly it was a piece of shit. The cases on the old Miller S-22/ Hobart Hefty feeders were downright flimsy. I remember you had to prop it up on a board just right to get it to feed correctly because otherwise a full spool would cause the case to flex it would drag against the inside of the case. Sold it for $400.  Whatever brand feeder you wind up with, it doesn't have to be the same brand as your welder. I'd just go with whatever you can find the best deal on a used engine drive  that has at least 7kw auxillary generator output and a CC/CV option."
Welding,3dzscg,texasroadkill,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:25:19 2015 UTC,Nice thing here is you can mix and match some stuff. I use to run a 305g mostly stick and then had a 8vs miller suitcase. I've now upgraded to a miller 325 trailblazer. I've done a bit of tig with both welders and still have the suitcase.  Additional equipment will be needed for everything. One I recommend is a good remote box. don't buy either the lincon or miller one. A good aftermarket one usually has outlets built into the box making it so you don't need extension cords and you can control your heat at the work. Worth the $500 to me.  the tig aspect on either machine will be okay but not great. everytime I've done it I just set my heat and go. No foot control. Just to much hassle in the field for that. If you get into it a lot it may be worth investing more into it but basic torch and gas adapter get you going pretty easy and cheap.  The suitcase has more options. I like the simple setting for the 8vs miller. It's smaller vs the 12vs and the lincon models. I've only ever seen one lincon on the jobsite and the guy spent all day trying to get it to work and then gave up. We were welding outside with no wind breaks or coverage on some hand rail and he got a lot of porosity all day. He kept blaming the machine yet I had no issues just turned the gas up a bit. I never tried to help him so not really sure if it had a bad connection or what.  If the work is more standing in one spot I'd probably go with the bigger suitcase but moving around I like the smaller one for sure. But the price of $2000 plus for one is pretty high compared to the power source.  Lastly I'd look at the price difference between the machines your listing and the next size up. I've hardly seen the smaller as they don't work well for pipe. A bigger machine might hold more resell value.  Edit: I also should add a general rule is the msrp of your engine driven welder is typically how man hours you'll get out of it before major problems. Keep this in mind if buying used. Depending how well it's taken care of of course but a 4500 dollar machine with 3500 hours on it is likely on its last legs.

I wasn't talking about the weld profile, I was referring to the scratch-marks that often accompany a walked weld that are left by the ceramic cup engraving the base material.  This can be avoided by skilled welder, though, so it's not a guaranteed way to tell, without it though, it's also hard to say conclusively that is was absolutely walked.

Honestly if you are trying to get into pipe and you come here with these vague questions you have a very very long way to go. If you have a big truck (at least 3/4 ton) and a generator style welder that's a huge plus because it's going to be a necessity unless you get on with a company that supplies welding really rigs for you. Good luck with that though. A good rig that you can rely on is going to start around $30,000 and your typical rigs you see on the right of way are easily $60k. Your best bet is to get on as a welders assistant/helper/grinder bitch. If you do a good job and make friends your welder should teach you all you need to know. I know this may sound like a douchey reply but I went down that road. I, however, went to school. Took on 13k in debt. Worked shitty jobs with shitty hours for shitty wages welding everything but pipe (mostly rich peoples houses). I had dreams of making my riches in a ditch or in bell holes. I now work in IT. My all position unlimited thickness certs are now expired (not that they were really worth anything anyway). I'm not trying to dissuade you from pursuing what you want to do, but know that being a pipeline welder requires a mixture of skill, money, and luck. Skill is a huge factor in it as well.

I got on as a helper because all you need is a pulse, ears and hands, and maybe an ass to kick every now and then. learn to speak mumbles so you can understand what welders are saying under a hood with a dust mask on. I got a little to good at being a helper so instead of becoming a welder I ended up a fitter. I can do everything but weld even though I am fully certified. about every week or 2 I get calls from all over the U.S. from welders asking me if I am working. I am fast and accurate and I can push a welder to his max speed every day without wearing his ass to a nub. I make more money as a fitter than I ever could as a welder. with me measuring, cutting grinding and rollout( setting up the workspace ) and roll up ( closing the workspace for the day and putting everything back on the truck ) keeping everything in its place and changing grinding disks and cleaning torch tips, the welder is free to work comfortably without having to stop and start all the time. as a contract road whore a welder with a good fitter/helper can clear an extra 40-80k per year if they do piece work or have early completion bonuses. I usually ask for 20% of any bonuses I helped to achieve. I bought my own rig got all my certs and I am basically back up for sick days and a decent sister welder when needed. I have about 5 welders I rotate through over the year. when one contract ends I usually have another welder hungry for bonuses calling me. I travel a lot. I get asked all the time to train welders kids to help like I do. some of them work out but most are to concerned about phones and gadgets. My advice to you is to get on as a helper, stay busy, do everything that needs doing, learn to measure accurately, learn to cut squarely, learn to keep cords, leads and hoses out of the way, and last but not least keep the truck neat organized and clean.  P.S. work on handwriting welders hate doing paperwork if you do the paperwork with legible penmanship they will love you when tax time rolls around.  I have standing offers for welding jobs and enough references to choke a boss out, but I stay as a fitter/helper because there are hundreds of old welders with thousands of old tricks of the trade you wont find in a book or class room. its the kinda shit they were saving for their son's before they found out they were hooked on dope or became cubicle workers."

This is less true of stainless steels. Vertical-up welding of stainless, or filling large gaps, is a lot more difficult without losing control of the puddle. The high alloy content in SS reduces the surface tension significantly.  The surface tension of aluminum is even greater. For example, it's not much harder to MIG weld aluminum in the vertical up or overhead positions, then it is to weld flat."

Welding,3dom5n,VisualAssassin,3,Fri Jul 17 23:51:18 2015 UTC,"I don't see a real reason to use the high silicon filler on thin sanitary parts. Go with the normal 316L filler.  Silicon is a ferrite stabilizer and tends to increase the ferrite percentage in complete welds, this can reduce cracking in otherwise crack-prone situations.   Most welds in austenitic SS tend to contain 5-10% of ferrite in the as-welded condition. (wheres high silicon fillers may contain 10-20%.) This is actually desirable because ferrite has the ability to dissolve harmful impurities and intermetallic phases which would otherwise form precipitates between the crystal grains, leading to cracking. This tends to make solidification cracking and fusion zone cracking less common, for example. Furthermore as the ferrite regions develop, they have the ability to relieve some of the shrinkage stresses in the weld.  But I doubt cracking is much of a concern on thin-wall items for sanitary parts, rather than, for example, avoiding excessive sugaring on the backside of the welds.    316L-Si would be more beneficial in thick structural items with multiple weld passes.   One of the reasons austenitic SS welds are more crack prone than ferritic SS and carbon steels, (despite having much better overall ductility than the latter), is that welds in austenitic SS have an excessively coarse columnar grain structure.  In ferritic SS and carbon steels, the transformation from austenite to ferrite at about 750 °C results in smaller ferrite grains forming inside the previous large austenite grains in the weld zone. The new ferrite grains don not have the same state of stress so the formation of ferrite relives shrinkage stresses in the weld zone."

The addition of silicon does what you've said it does and a few other things, but it's not a drastic change to 316 chemistry.  Why not 308L though?  Why do you need the molybdenum in the weld?  If this is a DIY project, you shouldn't worry about it.  If you're working for a company, I suggest you talk to their quality people about acceptability (if I had to bet, they'll steer you towards the much more common 316L, given the choice)."
Welding,3doals,algae_man,4,Fri Jul 17 22:12:03 2015 UTC,"You can do it, c10 or c15 is certainly better, a trimix, for welding one exhaust is probably overkill, and won't give much better performance for plain steel.  Using trimix really depends on a lot of things and the machine you're running is one of those. Tri-mixes are great for running spray arc transfer, but not so nice for short arc and pretty rough for globular, so if you've got a hobby grade machine and 99% of your welding is done on 1/4"" or thinner material, you're not really going to be running in a range you'll need it.  IF your machine can run pulsed GMAW, a 98% Ar, 2%CO2 mix would be good for that.  I would love to be able to say talk to your gas supplier, but my experiences with the technical knowledge of many gas supply employees hasn't put much confidence in their advice.  edit: changed wording slightly."

Welding,3doals,W_O_M_B_A_T,5,Sat Jul 18 02:00:52 2015 UTC,"EDIT: If the rest of the exhaust system is carbon steel rather than S.S., there is no need to use stainless filler wire, or buy new gas. Just stick to 70s-6 filler and use the 75/25 gas you already have.   This should be sufficient for simply welding a stainless exhaust tip on for cosmetic reasons.   Under ideal circumstances the best practice is to use 309L filler wire for joining stainless to non-stainless, and I would recommend this if you were doing paid work for someone else's car.  However 309 is expensive and it's hard to justify buying a whole spool of wire for just one weld on your own car.   with a tri-mix being ideal.   It's ideal for the companies that bottle the gas, because they get premium profits from gases with a high %-age of helium.  For the customer, not so much. Don't waste your time with expensive tri-mixes.  The best gas for stainless MIG welding is 98-97% Argon + 2-3% CO2. And it has been for decades."

Welding,3dmi6b,Stereotypy,3,Fri Jul 17 13:56:46 2015 UTC,"NiBSi powder; borides in a nickel matrix. it uses two gases- a 100% Ar for shielding gas, and a 5% Hydrogen/95% Argon gas for propelling the powder. 2-passes total over a roughly 2""x12""x0.75"" rectangular mild steel bar; 0.25"" thickness total on any side.  For those not familiar with PTAW, imagine doing TIG work but instead of having a filler rod in your feeding hand, you have a receptacle attached that propels its powder contents into the arc via gas through the same opening as where the TIG electrode protrudes. It's actually really convenient; you could think of PTAW is to GTAW as GMAW is to SMAW, in a way. just automated feeding of filler material.  This particular powder is used for superior abrasion and friction resistance.  edit- we decided to fully automate the process by hooking it up to the jetline because of the little discontinuities shown in yesterday's photo. looks quite a bit nicer now."

Typical AR plate (such as manganese steels) does have a bit of abrasion resistance, hence the name of course, but it pales in comparison to a carbide coating or what have you.  For example, we have a customer who specialized in ash and coal processing, and they at the time had to replace much of their conveyor system, totally re-building it, every 6 months. couldn't be helped from the amount of wear and corrosion that occurred. half a million dollar repair cost, roughly. They used AR plate. We instead suggested a 5mm high chromium/niobium/carboboride coating on 8mm plate. Their replacement downtime went from every 6 months to every 3-5 years, if i remember correctly.  The cost is admittedly very high when it comes to complex carbide wearfacings and coatings, but the cost savings to the customer is, comparatively, astronomically high in return."

With the customer I'm talking about, many of their conveyor systems are used to transport flue ash, which becomes highly corrosive when mixed with water.  hopefully i'm not crossing any lines with my employer regarding customer info, but here's a youtube video of the exact sort of conveyor system we retrofitted with coated plate."

Welding,3dnddb,pookankou,2,Fri Jul 17 17:58:49 2015 UTC,208 can be single phase or 3 phase are you sure the 208 isn't single phase? This is a common misconception that there is either a 2 phase or running 2 legs is 3 phase... 3 phase has 3 hot legs.. nearly all houses in the USA (if that's where you're located) have 2 hot  legs are are capable of producing 208v please post machine model number so that I can further help you
Welding,3dnddb,theinfamous_MrB,2,Fri Jul 17 18:25:55 2015 UTC,It's an esab 875 it says it can only run on three phase. Tried it on single and that didn't work. runs on 208/230 three phase
Welding,3dnddb,theinfamous_MrB,4,Fri Jul 17 18:31:13 2015 UTC,At which point you're probably better off selling the unit and buying the appropriate one the money you're going to spend on a rotary phase converter to run that will probably cost you more than a cutter would.
Welding,3dnddb,drive2fast,2,Fri Jul 17 18:35:02 2015 UTC,"Fair enough I got it fairly cheap , but its just been a hassle ever since. Lesson learned on that one."
Welding,3dnddb,metfab,2,Fri Jul 17 18:39:37 2015 UTC,"I bought a rotophase used for $500. This opens the door for all sorts of 3 phase shop equipment. Everyone who is into 3 phase gear generally only buys low mileage really nice gear, so older 3 phase equipment is usually super cheap as no one wants it foe their high volume professional shop. Band saws, grinders, plasma cutters, you name it. 3 phase motors are simple and more reliable, can reverse direction and are cheaper to replace than single phase too.   There is also 3 phase on the pole at my shop, so if I ever feel like trenching I can get the whole shop converted. For now, the rotophase is fine."
Welding,3dnddb,greenbuggy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:02:24 2015 UTC,Definitely keep the cutter and save for the converter. It will be worth it in the long run to be able to add other 3 phase equipment
Welding,3dnddb,s800,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:50:24 2015 UTC,"Depends what OP's forecast is for the future of their shop and equipment.  I started with an RPC, and it worked, but I'm definitely happier now that my cold saw, lathe, CNC mill and belt grinder are all fitted with variable frequency drives (VFD's).  Certainly the RPC was a lot cheaper (got a 5 HP motor out of scrap pile and used a lawnmower pull cord to get it spinning, then plugged it in real fast...a real lowbuck setup).  You really need a BIG RPC and big supply infrastructure to run some of the inductive loads presented by a high-amp plasma or welder.  Since then though, I've definitely upped the ante and being able to have essentially infinite spindle speeds means better surface finish and tool life on the mill and lathe, and ability to do a better job and keep blades sharp longer on the cold saw when doing stainless tubing.  The belt grinder I like to be able to really crank up the speed and take material down fast."
Welding,3dmttc,HERPdwaltDERP,2,Fri Jul 17 15:31:06 2015 UTC,"AWS CWI checking in.  Associate CWI is useless around where I live (Western NY). To take the CWI test you need 5 years relevant experience, not 4. You also have to get a notarized affidavit stating your work experience. (You can have a bank teller notarize it) You also need to take an eye test, and have passport photos taken for your ID card. All need to be done before you can be accepted to take the test.  Although I live in Buffalo, I took my test in Chicago after 5 1/2 years of welding. Our instructor was brutally honest. He had no problem telling everyone in the class that at least half of the people in the class will most likely fail. He said it's typically a 40% Pass rate WITH the 5 day seminar. His honesty was what I appreciated most, it made the whole possibility of failing more real. Most people in my class were there paid for by their own work. I paid for mine cash out of my own pocket, including 6 nights at the hotel, travel, food, etc... It ended up costing about $4.5k all said and done, not counting the week I had to take off of work.  There were I think 23 people in the class. I think only 4 of us that were there were actual welders. The rest were Engineers/QA/QC and managers.  I HIGHLY recommend staying in a hotel regardless of where you take it. You NEED ALL of the time you can get to study. It's a very hard test. We had class from 8am-3pm if I recall correctly, then I would study until midnight-1am. My test was scheduled on Sunday because Saturday was booked up. So I got an extra day to study. I would run to Wal-Mart to get supplies (food) as needed, and stop and McD's to stock up on Big Macs. Other than that, I was in my hotel room with my head in the books. They supply you with an insane amount of reading. I recommend taking the API 1104. D1.1 is more useful, but it's MUCH more difficult. I scored a near perfect score on my API 1104 (97%), and I only dedicated 1 day of study to it. The D1.1 guys were down in the computer lab doing all nighters trying to cram material. If you fail your code test, you fail the whole exam. There's no reason to make the test any more difficult than it needs to be. You can take your D1.1 afterward, when there's less stress.  There's plenty of prep material you can buy from the AWS bookstore. CM2005 or something like that is the best bang for your buck. It's like $250 and is full of information and practice tests. Once you can score at least an 80-90% on those practice tests, you are OK to go to the class. When you get to the class, the practice tests they will give you there are 50x more difficult. You will get about 10% on your first test.  The thing is, they TRY to trick you. They intentionally give you trick questions. Every question is a trick. As a CWI you have to pay attention to details. They are testing how good you pay attention to details. ALWAYS check footnotes, they love to use footnotes. The questions are so freaking tricky. They're not difficult, just totally mess with your head. After answering 200+ trick questions, your mind is totally fried. I thought I blew it. I really did. But in reality I did very well. I'll link my test scores below.  http://i.imgur.com/F6pgdo2.jpg  You're a long way off from the test now, but I just wanted to explain the process in case anyone else is wondering. It's worth it. It really is. But don't think it's going to be easy... Even if you're good at welding, welding is just a small portion of it.  After I got back to my job from taking the test, our QC inspector quit for another job. I applied for his job, and moved right in. Right now I'm working on finishing my Mechanical Engineering degree, and I can't wait to see where that leads me.  If you have any questions, ask away.  edit: Here's my itemized list of questions. Keep in mind, I know definitions very well even though I got a few wrong. Every questions is a trick. How it's worded can be very confusing.  http://imgur.com/udgbfJi  P.S. I drove back from home after taking the test on Sunday. We finished the test about 4pm. I got back home at 4am on Aug 11 (My birthday), which left me just enough time to eat and shower then leave for work @5am. Best birthday ever. :)"

That does not mean taking a course is a bad idea. I think it depends upon your level of interest.   Take you favorite hobby. Think about how much you know about it. Did you learn it all on your own or take a class? If you learned it on your own, compare how much you enjoy welding and related technology to your hobby that you spend time learning. If welding information does not seem as interesting, a course may be the way to go.   Just a thought. There are tons of posts on the subject on the AWS Welding Forum with many more opinions besides my own.  Here is a recent one that may be of interest. https://app.aws.org/forum/topic_show.pl?pid=267996"
Welding,3dijlz,NCGeronimo,23,Thu Jul 16 15:37:02 2015 UTC,"Been meaning to post this up for a couple weeks now. Tried to add captions for each image but not sure if worked from mobile.   So here's the breakdown: This is a rotor 20k horsepower electric motor out of a steel mill. The motor failed and is a total rebuild. In order to remove the coils from the rotors the wedges driven into the spider must be pulled. Every time one of these jobs shows up I know I'm in for a shit show. No two are alike and depending on who put it together last and what corners they cut the jobs rides on a scale from fucked to hang up your welding mask and go cry in a corner it's never coming apart.   The old timers all told me this one would make me cry.... They were right.  Here's a brief breakdown of the process. Take special made pulling spade made with 1-1/2"" thread rod and cut a bevel on the end of the spade. After cleaning up the end of the wedge have your nurse/rod-holder/lil helper bitch hold the beveled end at a 45° angle on the chosen wedge. Lay in root with super 35 welding rod (used for superior ductility). Each successive pass your rod-holder will slowly raise the spade until it's level with the wedge. Completely fill and cap then allow to cool to near room temp.   The pulling rig. Custom stand off is passed over the rod followed by 80 ton hydraulic ram. These are held in place with heavy duty plate and nut. Last on the rod is the good ol' beaterizer. Which is just a coupling nut welded to a piece of 3"" round stock. Apply pressure with  ram and start beating your brains out.  There's oh so much to be said about this and I'm willing to fill in any details you may be curious about if this post takes off so don't be shy with questions."

Welding,3dijlz,usernametiger,7,Thu Jul 16 17:01:04 2015 UTC,We sent a rotor from a 28MW steam turbine generator to have a broken bolt replaced.   I guess this bolt was put on before the windings were installed.   I assume they to to do stuff like this to our rotor.  The machinist told me about a ring that held everything together. It was machined so precise you couldn't tell where the ends were.   The idea to remove it it to find an end and heat it then whack it with a hammer and it pops right out.   The missed the end by 45 degrees and when it popped out it bent the whole ring. It tool a week to find the right material just to make the ring.

Welding,3dijlz,mattfromtelevision,6,Thu Jul 16 17:47:07 2015 UTC,"I will try to explain. There are two wedges driven against each other from opposite sides of the coil. When hammered home the wedges pull the coil down to the rotor body. So in this process the basic setup pulls on one wedge hoping that it will break free from the other and pull out. It doesn't always work and there are a thousand ways to tweak the setup to get the wedges out. For this job in particular, both wedges were pulling together (bad). So part of the solution ended up being welding the second wedge to the rotor body.   I hope this helps. Wish I could draw a picture for a reply lol."
Welding,3dijlz,mattfromtelevision,3,Thu Jul 16 19:30:10 2015 UTC,Pictures would definitely help.  It's hard to tell how these pieces fit together in the pictures.  I understand at least 75% more how it works now though.  I at least understand what you're trying to accomplish.  Thanks.
Welding,3dijlz,vyvratit,3,Thu Jul 16 19:56:22 2015 UTC,Can you explain how hitting the end of the rig translates into pulling force on the wedge?
Welding,3dijlz,Blue_Cypress,4,Fri Jul 17 01:51:01 2015 UTC,"Each strike sends a shockwave through the wedges. This vibration assists in the wedges releasing from each other. Besides the fact that these have been driven together into a machined fit and put under tremendous amounts of pressure; there will be rust, debris, galling, and not to mention the weight of each coil when the motor is running is somewhere in the hundreds of thousands of pounds (possibly more, I know it's a literal fuckton) for thousands of hours. These things are really in there. When a weld fails or as I have pictured in the gallery, a wedge snaps, that whole rig will shoot out through the ram like a gun. The hammering goes on and on and on too. Your blisters get blisters, old timers keel over before morning break, it's a for real workout. Making each wedge that comes out worthy of much jubilation.   Tl:Dr- the hammering sends  shockwaves through the wedges to get them to release."
Welding,3dijlz,SayWhatIsABigW,4,Fri Jul 17 02:04:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed response! I get you now. So, you put tension on the wedge with the large nut, then whack at it the back to break it free?"

Welding,3diqlx,Stereotypy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:25:10 2015 UTC,"The aluminum weldment was done mostly with tig. I only used mig for the plates on the gussets because it was impossible to get the tig torch in that tight space.  For the tig, I use a miller synchrowave 250 and for the mig I use a millermatic 300 with a cobramatic wire feed system and push-pull gun.  The steel thing is a molecular still stand.  I don't exactly know why they don't want weld on the outside, but the print says no weld on outside.  My best guess is that it's just for cosmetics.  They don't want much visible welds on the front of it."
Welding,3diqlx,Stereotypy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:36:00 2015 UTC,"I did aluminum MIG for about 6 months at a little shop north of where I live for a bit.

Man, i have NEVER used a nicer machine. beat the hell out of every miller and lincoln welder i've ever used. the level of customization and tweaking you can do with that fronius was insane. ran incredibly smoothly. The gun had a 3-step trigger that you could either set up to cycle through different machine configurations, or you could squeeze it all the way and set it to a higher voltage, let off of it halfway and set it to a typical voltage, and then let off of it most of the way and set it cold. It was incredibly easy to start the weld off nice and hot and penetrative, back off a bit while running the bead, and then use the colder finishing setting to fill in any bead craters left over.  thanks for the info."

And I do enjoy fussy fussy stainless TIG. It makes me happy.  Pick a career path that doesn't have you welding 40 hours a week, or at least a path to get out in a few years. Welders die first, breathing that shit is not ok. Take breaks, and have control over air quality. (Break skulls until you get big fans/ventilation). This makes for work environments you will enjoy. Enjoyable places are ones that are easy to find pleasure in.  Take those welding skills and evolve. You will enjoy it. If you don't, find something better.

I literally just got into it with a guy the other day because of saying basically the same thing in a different thread here the other day, but I prefer NOT busting ass all day, sweating your nuts off, straining your body, blowing black shit out your nose, lifting heavy-ass shit all day.  however, as a counterpoint, while yeah I can or could complain about it, when i was actually there at work doing my thing, it was all good. welding itself and fabbing shit is fun; having to do the same weldment every day for months not out of choice or hobby but due to necessity is not."

I'd like to spend more time welding but it's nice to mix things up with fabrication and machine assembly. I get sent out of town on installations every once in awhile. I used to really enjoy that, not so much now unless I go somewhere fun. I just get bored sitting around the hotel at night since I don't drink much. I'm less than useless with a hangover.

I've seen so many older welders who have stayed in manufacturing and they look absolutely miserable.   About to go out in the field, my ironworker buddy has assured me that it's much better. The hours may not be better, but at least you're more adequately compensated for your exhaustion.   My goal is to make metal sculptures professionally, and I know I'll be happier once I'm doing my own thing. Thinking about the bigger picture definitely makes this all more tolerable.

Welding,3dhvnh,drive2fast,3,Thu Jul 16 19:36:44 2015 UTC,"I was going to chase this career years ago. Then I met 2 different comercial divers with bone necrosis. That where the bones in your body are dying because you dive too much. I dunno about you, but I like my bones.  Money is not going to fix a fucked body. In canada anyways, repairs are free here. Of course, Breaking Bad would have been a boring show if money didn't fix your body down in 'murica. Money still can't quite fix that whole bones dying thing.  I became a millwright instead. I still get to weld sometimes and I mostly make money using by brain. As I age, I can transition more into robotics and controls. A thinkin' man's job.   Diving is just an enjoyable hobby now.  We are entering an era of cheap oil for the next decade as well. Electric cars/plug in electric are coming faster than once anticipated as battery prices have been on a steady trajectory of bring 30% cheaper per KW/H per year. Saudi Arabia's best interest is to sell everything at fire sale prices now. Iran just got the green light to flood the market and prices will stay low for quite some time. Cheap oil means little new offshore exploration. Tight budgets and few welders working underwater. Those with experience will keep working. New welders will have a very hard time finding that once well paying work. Competition for jobs= low wages."

Welding,3dhvnh,frecel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:12:54 2015 UTC,I've been told that it is a lot easier to become a underwater welder if you have a lot of experience diving and none in welding than vice versa.   Considering that it looks like the average underwater welder makes less than a rig welder in northern Alberta I would say this is a career path mostly for people who are very passionate about diving.

I've got a Yeti cup sitting in the shop waiting for me to attach something I can use to hang it from my pack. My first thought was to TIG it but I don't feel like experimenting on a $40 item. My second thought was JB Weld. I stumbled across some old brazing rod and I'm thinking of using my TIG rig to braze something to it.

If you're doing a weld test, don't ask too many questions, but make sure you know exactly what you need to do. A buddy of mine went for a weld test and they gave him a mock CWB plate. He prefers doing three passes on his root, but the super only wanted to see two; which he only found out after the super took a look at his stop/start on the fillet side. It still worked out for him but he had to lay a fat weld on the bevel to cover the whole root.  Also on the note of weld tests... The place I worked at last summer dealt primarily with sheet metal, so the weld test was all 14 ga. sheet. We had several guys come through the shop and try to weld that shit at 30+ volts... Don't be that guy lol."
Welding,3diysv,fuzzyalien77,2,Thu Jul 16 18:48:07 2015 UTC,Our supervisor makes them do weld tests for potential new hires on one of the old machines with the triangle plate that you have to lock to the correct voltage. The wire speed is set to zero also. 90% of the guys come in and they don't have an idea of roughly where to set the voltage and wire speed. In the schools they have all digital machines and they reference the chart under the door.   It filters out the inexperienced guys which is OK with me because our boss is always stressing over ship out deadlines and we don't have time to fix people's fuckups or teach them out to read a print.

Welding,3dhujb,Wilderness29,4,Thu Jul 16 12:18:08 2015 UTC,"You have a small amount of electricity leaking from the oven to probably the frame.  The reason we have gfci is to trip if electricity is leaking. Let's say you have a hand on the oven and lean up against a grounded water line or steel support, the leakage could run through your heart and kill you.  Unless the oven is double insulated this danger exists  Edit: I'm not trying to freak you out. Thousands of people have drills trip gfci when they are working in a shop or garage or outside.

I didn't even touch the work table since I thought I ...well, you know.   What got me comfortable was watching my instructor. He was very kind and patient, and did all of the above with a live arc. He didn't die, so I figured I'd be fine.   The best thing you can do, if you really want to pursue this, is to get a good solid safety foundation. Familiarize yourself with how the machine works, how electricity works, how to set up a safe area, and how to wear PPE.   Get in the habit of making sure your work space is safe every time you start, even if you walk away for a few mins (pranks are common). Always wear proper PPE, no matter if you're welding for hours, or just making a tack or two.

Once you get used to welding you begin to understand what's dangerous just like any other activity. Let me ask you a question. The first few times you drove a car, did it scare you? I assume it did right?"
Welding,3dg34h,Nati0nalxCrisis,2,Thu Jul 16 00:26:26 2015 UTC,It definitely did. You have a good point.
Welding,3dg34h,French_Mustache,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:28:21 2015 UTC,I don't even get how some folks plasma cut without shade. It's super fucking bright! I bet they just drag it along the material.

Welding,3dg34h,donkey90745,2,Fri Jul 17 12:07:44 2015 UTC,"scared you? well, you can get over that eventually. Do you enjoy doing it? The whole end all of you in a welding school is so you can make a living doing it. It is not for everyone. You will burn yourself some, have to dress in leather gear on hot days and make it worse you have a hot torch in your hand. So yea, if you don't enjoy it, I would rethink doing it."
Welding,3dg34h,donkey90745,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:32:02 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy the idea of welding. I think the fact that I was scared of everything was stopping me from fully enjoying it at the time.  I'm thinking I would like it, once I get comfortable with everything."
Welding,3dg34h,GrooverMcTuber,2,Thu Jul 16 00:36:22 2015 UTC,Then by all means continue. You are far more likely to get killed driving to work than get killed on the job. Welders get paid great money. You can do jobs on the side in your own garage eventually.

Welding,3dg34h,Oneiropticon,2,Thu Jul 16 05:32:28 2015 UTC,"Your instructors an idiot and I suggest continue, but in another program not run by assholes. Welding is dangerous, thats all there is to it, but its safe when you know your instructions like not to have exposed wires and standing in water while welding and stuff like that. I took welding for a little over 3 years and after a few months I wasn't scared when I started to get comfortable with it.   I suggest this when welding. ALWAYS wear gloves when you're touching metal. Aluminum especially because aluminum shows no signs of heat and you don't know if someone just welded it, when you get more comfortable and don't feel like wearing gloves, just dab your hands a few inches from a weld to feel if its hot, like checking if a pans hot enough to throw some meat on it. If you're in an exposed shop without curtains I suggest getting tinted safety glasses so you don't get the UV rays that will give you flash burn, which will give you a sandpaper feeling in your eyes. Always wear long sleeves or put some high SPF sunblock on. That only applies with TIG welding where sparks aren't present. All other types, its very wise to wear long sleeves at all times and proper leathers.  Don't be afraid, its a scary field but you will get comfortable with it after a while and find the proper instructors."
Welding,3dg34h,Stereotypy,2,Thu Jul 16 02:02:22 2015 UTC,"First, as is being iterated heavily, always eye protection. If you are vaporizing steel, protect your eyes. Bad instructor, no biscuit.  Second, I spent probably a month being incredibly skittish, every torch pop, every spark, I'd jump and damn near squeak. That said, I love working with metal. I love it intensely, and don't see myself doing anything else for money. Eventually, you will get used to the noises, the sparks, the occasional shocks, and realize that if you use a clue and ignore that instructor you'll be safe enough."
Welding,3dg34h,WelderWill,2,Thu Jul 16 05:27:13 2015 UTC,"fuck your instructor, dude purposely gave you arc eye. fuck that guy  edit- i've actually shocked myself a couple times welding before. it's what happens when you're handling oily-ass parts every day and you're sweating your ass off soaking your clothes and you're like fuck it i need to lay this 10ft. FCAW bead pretty soon to stay ahead of everybody down the line and have gotten a zap. it didn't kill me, but it surprised the hell out of me.  ever try plugging into an outlet, but accidentally having your finger on one of the prongs as you plug it in? yeah, it's a zap like that. no fun."
Welding,3dg34h,kippy3267,2,Thu Jul 16 18:53:12 2015 UTC,"My advice would be to just get a job that has a welding department. That way you can be around the process for free and more than likely be able to practice here and there. And watch the guys that do it for a living. Going to school for something you aren't sure of isn't the best bet. And honestly, welding school is overrated. There is nothing they teach you in school that you won't learn on the job. And it's cheaper"

Almost every one is afraid of it at first but it's easy to mig weld slowly in the flat position once you get used to it. You just kinda get used to it and it becomes normal, then habit, then you love it, then you're raking in the big bucks taking slag showers. I'm on step 3 moving to step 4 currently"

Welding,3dg34h,metarinka,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:23:00 2015 UTC,"like the other guys said use at least a shade 5 with a plasma cutter. I run a plasma table at work and just have shade 5 safety glasses.  If you follow safe work procedures the actual welding part is quite safe.  I've only shocked myself a couple times but that was using high frequency tig. you'll burn yourself a little, spatter landing on your arms, sunburn if you're not covered up, touching stuff that's hot, nothing too crazy.  From what I've seen using angle grinders is more dangerous than welding. I'd say 80% of the time I'd light myself on fire was from grinding sparks and not from welding sparks. I've also seen guys cut themselves with a grinder a few times.  but after all that I really enjoy working with metal and would rather build anything out of metal than any other material.   I'm currently working at what is my favourite job that I've had out of around 20 different jobs in a bunch of different industries."
Welding,3dg34h,some-young-guy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:52:20 2015 UTC,"Do you enjoy it, it's not nearly as dangerous as it looks or seems.  The amount of welders killed by electrocution is wayyyyy less than electricians and most of the danger is more to specific jobs like working around flammables or in confined spaces.  If you work in aerospace it's all clean desk work.  Do it if you like it, I was a total white collar kid and did it and went onto welding engineering, I still love to weld though."
Welding,3dg34h,psilocybe_XL,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:44:31 2015 UTC,"in welding, you need eye protection for everything. Eye protection for welding, cutting, grinding, everything. Think about it, even people who just work in front of computers need to protect their eyes by lowering the brightness or looking away. Plasma cutters are way brighter and have no filtering. Your eyes are probably your most valuable asset besides your brain lol. as for everything else dont worry, I mean I wasnt as terrified as what you described, but when I first started I thought I was supposed to shut off the welder to switch electrodes"

I use nothing less than a shade 5 lense and may even bump up a shade or two when cutting aluminum just because of the added reflection.   Anyway, as with anything, the more you do it the more comfortable you'll become with it. The key is knowing and understanding what you're doing and what you're working with. Know your machines and how they work, their limitations, etc., understand and live by safety, and learn to recognize on the job dangers - both existing and impending.  Statistically, welding is one of the most inherently dangerous jobs out there. However, if you take the time to practice safety, including policing your ranks (call others out on unsafe practices/habits), you'll at least lessen the likelihood of injury.  Is the 17 month course with the instructor referenced above?"

Show up 15 minutes ahead of time for the appointment and speak to their secretary or better yet, the education coordinator IN PERSON. They'll fill you in on what you need to do to join, if you qualify, and if/when apprenticeship slots are open. The best way to get a feel for what to expect is to visit the hall in person and meet the people you'll be working with. It's just like talking to a military recruiter, don't expect them to be of much help over the phone (and take whatever they tell you with a grain of salt).  Union membership has it's perks, but it's also not for everyone. I neither condemn nor affiliate myself with any union at the present time. Which one to join is no different than picking what branch of the military you want to join - It's entirely your decision which one you think you'll ""fit"" best and it requires a lot of research and footwork on your own behalf. The more questions you ask before joining, the better the odds are that you'll be satisfied with your decision."

In fact, economists agree that the U.S. manufacturing industry is currently suffering a “skills gap” of around 500,000. That’s 500,000 jobs just waiting to be filled, if only companies could find adequately skilled candidates.  Welder Shortfall Fires Up Industry Training Programs to Work Overtime. America’s industrial-energy construction boom fuels the push for more welders with top skills.   The National Center for Welding Education and Training predicts by 2024, demand for welders will increase by 30 percent.

Welding,3dag7y,kippy3267,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:19:35 2015 UTC,"repairing CAT tractors   Like actually a Caterpillar authorized repair shop, or just a shop repairing heavy machinery?   Half of everything is broken like the welding machine, the gas regulators   My first 2 years I spent welding was split between fixing trucks, machines, re-organizing the shop and learning to weld.  You can either help make things better or they'll just get worse.  Sometimes it comes down to a matter of keeping the lights on sometimes it making a quick buck and getting the fuck out.  Some employers have too much pride to know when they should shut it down and move on so they keep trying to make it work, some are just greedy mother fuckers who would sell their own kid out to profit. There are excellent employers out there though, who tend to hire excellent employees as well.   Instead of replacing a pretty much ruined transmission housing...     That may have been the customers' choice, not theirs.  Sometimes even employers are limited in what they can have done by their employees.  If they're rebuilding it for someone else, it's not the same thing as covering it up and trying to resell it.  I've done some weird things in the name of getting things running well enough to keep a shift working, it doesn't mean it was the best way to fix it, but it was the right way for the time being.   So are a lot of places like this?   Yes, but more aren't.  You're getting the shit end of the stick, and everyone of us will at some point or another in our careers, but you're learning something there.  You're learning what not to do, you're learning how not to do it; you're learning how you want to be treated and how to treat future subordinates.  You're learning what kinds of shops to avoid in the future. Or you're just coasting through until you get into your cushy union job where everything will be sunshine rainbows and unicorns, because there's no shit jobs in unions, as we all know.  At the end of the day, it's your choice what you're going to take away from it.  welding is a huge field with a lot of little niche areas where you can really make a name for yourself.  Whether that name is as a really good all around employee, a golden hand welder or a dog to beat is going to be your call."

Welding,3dbpay,ecclectic,2,Thu Jul 16 04:06:02 2015 UTC,"Shop welder and machinist here. I've worked at a metal shop for 6 years. I work on lathes, mills, use plasma cutters, torch...everything associated with metal. We repair hydraulic cylinders, make headache racks, build cooling trailers, repair a lot of stuff for people in the oil field, fabricate a lot of things used in businesses in our local  industrial park.     Anyways, my point to all of that, is that depending on your towns size, opening up your own shop will benefit by being able to do a vast majority of things and not just specialize with welding. You may have people come in asking you to make a bicycle into a low rider, you may have people asking you to repair drivelines or tractor parts. Doing that will allow you to see where the most money to be made is in your town. And be prepared, people may need stainless, aluminum, steel, cast welded or repaired. This may mean different equipment or gasses or grinding discs. There's so much to be learned if you've never done it. Once you have a firm grasp you can have a good idea of what you need to start a shop.     Welding is an experience thing. Anyone can learn it if you can handle the heat and getting dirty then you will get there. Every job I've ever had I couldn't wait to get off. But welding is something I feel I'm gaining experience the more I do. I was supposed to be off at 5:30 today but I stayed for an hour because my welds were looking clean, and I didn't want to walk away when I had more parts to weld and I was on a roll. I think you will enjoy it.     As for your weight. It's hot in a shop and it can be hot indoors. But your weight shouldn't effect it. May even help you a bit in tougher jobs involving moving heavier things or in jobs requiring you to put your man hands on.   Anyways. I wish you luck. I love the job I have, but with lathes and machines and welders id probably never be able to afford to open my own shop. Not to mention I would never put myself into competition with my boss.

Welding,3d6jvl,donereaddat,2,Mon Jul 13 23:13:00 2015 UTC,"Wrong part. P/n you listed specs a Miller style bayonet or  ""back end"".  As you can see, Hobart uses a different (smaller diameter) bayonet than Miller on many of their machines. AFAIK, Hobart has used at least 3 different style bayonets over the years so you might want to have exact measurements handy and original mfg p/n when ordering a replacement (look in parts manual).  I'd call the seller to request an RMA and send the whole thing back. After you get a refund, order the right Hobart compatible gun through a more helpful supplier. I prefer the Bernard/Tregaskiss guns over Tweco anyway."

Welding,3d2wmc,WhiskyTangoSailor,2,Thu Jul 16 03:43:52 2015 UTC,"If your voltage is the same, why not. I would verify that you have the proper amperage, voltage and wire size then trim it out with the proper receptacle myself. Then again my Lincoln is ran directly to the panel with SO cord right now lol. Always the electrician's shit that isn't wired right or the mechanic's car that doesn't run."
Welding,3d2wmc,donereaddat,9,Thu Jul 16 20:03:51 2015 UTC,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Welding/search?q=outlet&restrict_sr=on  Look up an outlet chart for information to proceed with swapping out the plug or using an adapter.  The one on the left is single phase 220 just like the one on your welder. The one on the right is 480v 3 phase. You can see the NEMA codes for the outlets on the outlets. I can read them in the picture. Look those up to see exactly what they are. The second number after the hyphen is the amperage rating. Just be sure it is higher than the amperage pull of the machine. (It certainly is)  I THINK! Pretty sure. I am not an electrician. I only know this stuff from running around the shop trying to find outlets for various machines. Also, wiring up my own machines at home to match existing outlets in various rental garages.  Edit: Welding is dangerous. Hire a certified welder instead of being a real man and figuring it out yourself. Typing can give you carpal tunnel, hire an assistant... SHIT... SHUT ER DOWN!!!"
Welding,3d2wmc,OMW,11,Mon Jul 13 02:50:08 2015 UTC,"Receptacle on the right is not supposed to be used for a 3 phase application , If you look closely, it says L14-20 right on it. All 14 series connectors use a 3 pole/4 wire config. 2 hots, neutral, ground. They add a neutral so you can tap 110v without using the ground conductor. Same wiring setup as the newer 14-50 plugs you see on most newer welder generators - 220v single phase with a dedicated neutral.  Important to note is never assume plugs and receptacles are wired like they're ""supposed to be"". Test everything yourself, or call a pro electrician to test the circuit for you and determine if it's suitable for your welder. Nobody is capable of doing that just by looking at a photo. High voltage doesn't care what color the wires are or what style the plug is that it's passing through - If wired incorrectly, it will kill you (or burn your garage down) just the same.  Also note the welder has a 50 amp plug which means (in theory) it could draw close to that current at max load. Without seeing the welder data plate who knows?  Who knows what the breaker is for those two outlets (they appear to be run in series). Wiring may only be safe for 20 or 30 amps tops, and whoever wired it never intended both outlets to be used at the same time. Or maybe the previous owner just used one of the outlets for their weird 220v european coffee maker and never intended either receptacle to power a welder.  Too many unknowns to give a safe answer, OP needs to hire an electrician.  Edit to add: The owner's manual states a Hobart 235 stickmate can draw almost 50 amps at rated output. So yeah, you should definitely consider hiring an electrician for some wiring and breaker panel upgrades."

Welding,3d2wmc,drive2fast,2,Mon Jul 13 17:33:57 2015 UTC,"You can run a welder with lower amp settings off of a lower amp plug. You'll need to explore what settings trip breakers, and you had better have breaker access. Expect to run thinner rod to compensate, but you can do a lot with 30A 240V.  You can easily make up an adapter by looking up nema plug charts to figure out what you have. ALWAYS confirm it with a voltmeter."

Welding,3d2wmc,OMW,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:54:23 2015 UTC,"At a wild ass, but reasonably educated guess I'd say you're probably looking at around $150-200 in materials (roll of 6 or 8 gauge Romex cable, 6-50 receptacle, 60a breaker, misc hardware) and an hour or two of labor.   Depends on a lot of things - how far wiring needs to be run, (need 125' roll or just 20' at $1 something per foot?)if current breaker panel will work, what conduit and boxes are reusable, if anything else needs to be brought up to code, etc.  Maybe take a few pics and measurements and ask over in /r/electricians?"

Welding,3d2wmc,caskey,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:46:46 2015 UTC,"Where are you getting that the cord can only handle 25 amps and OP "" will likely see"" that  the welder draws less than 25 amps? That's simply not true.  Pg 21 of the manual for a Hobart Stickmate 235 states at max output, it draws 47.5 amps @230v   Don't believe me or don't want to flip through a PDF manual? No problem, just take a glance at ""amps input at rated output"" right here on Hobart's own spec sheet"
Welding,3d2wmc,theothernameplate,2,Mon Jul 13 05:40:04 2015 UTC,"I'm getting it from the specs on King Cord part number KC-076 which is only rated at 25 amps and I felt it more likely it was the cord that came with it than one that was bodged on.  Thus ""Likely"".  As for the model information of the welder that wasn't in the post title or the imgur album he linked so I have no way of knowing what the device was or whether it shipped with a cord or without one.  If you read the rest of that comment I said:   If it's rated for more then you have a dangerous piece of equipment with a cord that is not rated for more than 25A   Therefore, OP has a dangerous piece of 50A rated equipment with a 25A cord that happens to end in a 50A plug.  The entire cord assembly should be replaced with a correctly rated one and neither of those outlets are suitable.  Granted that wasn't clearly spelled out in the tl;dr."
Welding,3d2wmc,canweld,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:23:42 2015 UTC,That turnlok on the right should be 50A or atleast easily switched to a 50A turnlok

Frankly looking at the picture I would suspect both outlets share the same circuit. Probably a shared 30A run.  Until OP shares more there is no way of knowing."
Welding,3d2wmc,cyber_rigger,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:30:25 2015 UTC,"True on the sharing. 20A and up should be on atleast different fuses, i think its a regulatory code."

I'm a welder by trade (mostly TIG Inconel, right now), and awhile back I had free access to a small CNC Plasma cutter setup (4 foot x 4 foot cutting area) - all I had to pay for was the metal to cut. One of the last things I cut out were the 8 panels and base for this fire pit. Just a couple weeks ago I finally got together with my Dad and taught him a few welding basics, and we put this together over ~4 hours one weekend. It was finished with 3 layers of matte black high-temperature Rustoleum spray paint.  Everything is 11 Gauge A36 steel (~1/8 inch thick), so it will not rust out like a commercial pit you might buy at Lowe's. The base is octagonal, about 3 feet wide, with the panels coming up about 10 inches each. The legs are 2 inch x 4 inch rectangular tube, about 8 inches tall apiece, so the pit is 18 inches tall and 36 inches wide. Welded to the bottom of the pit are 4 equally-spaced pieces of 2 inch angle iron, to improve airflow. Each of the panels depict guns that my father owns or plans to own (clockwise from top):   Glock 21's Barrett M107's Ruger Vaqueros, 4-5/8"" barrels M1921 Tommy Guns M1911A1's M1 Garands Ruger Super Redhawks M1 Carbines   I hope y'all enjoy! As for the title, he calls it a ""3.34-caliber"" fire pit, because he added up the calibers of each panel (.45 + .50 + .45 + .45 + .45 + .30 + .44 + .30 = 3.34). Picture credit also goes to him."

I'm a fabricator on my way to journeyman, I'm currently working in a shared metal workspace, the picture provided is my workspace that I'm building out, the 4x4 posts are 14' tall and bolted into the rafters and concrete.

I'm going to be using a pallet shelving system to add storage space and want to enclose at least the bottom level so I can leave my laptop out and not come back to it covered in metal dust etc.  My first thought is to find some kind of flame retardant cloth I can use as curtains, second thought is to use plywood sheets attached to pulleys overhead and use angle iron to make a track mounted to the posts that keep the sheet where it's intinded to be.  Any suggestions on materials to use and how to attach them?    TLDR  Looking for some kind of material to make a wall around my bench space that I can move out of my way when I'm working.   TIA"

I welded a frame out of 1"" x 1"" square (about 4' x 2' tall) (I welded the metal pegboard from the frame, not the pegboard first or you won't get enough penetration before you burn through.  Let the puddle bleed to the much thinner pegboard from the frame.  Do some tacks first.  Okay, not much trick there but you can take advantage of your underutilized back wall.  What about the conduit?  Just weld some more square tubing to the top and the bottom.  They sell all sorts of things you can use to hold the items under your workbench -- spray can holder, etc...  Now for your laptop issue.  Grab some 1"" square tubing and make a bottom rectangle.  Then weld one some sides.  Looking at it from the front you've got the profile of a C-channel.  Skin the bottom, back, and the sides with 16 ga.  Now for the top.  Get a three lengths of continuous hinge the width of your box and some 1/8"" plate.  Cut the top into two pieces and another piece for the front.  Hinge the top to the back, and those two pieces to the front.  When it's closed, your laptop should be completely covered with something nice and heavy should something inadvertently fall on it, and the hinges allow you to fold it up and towards the back and out of the way."

I looked at the ground clamp that came with it, and I'm not sure who designed it, but apparently they didn't understand that the larger the contact patch, the better the odds are that you'll get a good ground connection. They apparently tried to make the contact patches as small as possible?  The spring in the original clamp was close to completely useless, as it would slip around even when holding onto rough ground 14 ga. sheet steel.  For $10, I was able to get a much, much better Hobart clamp from Amazon. Swapped them out and it made a major difference with the arc stability.

You did a great job aligning the shaft, from what I can see.  Sprocket hump up and down any?  Bearing housings are usually cast iron of some sort.  Very brittle, can be broken with a hammer.  I've welded housings back together, it sucks.  Preheat, weld, then cover with a cera-blanket and let it cool slow.  Doesn't last more than a couple months ... at least mine haven't.    Next time ya go out there, bring them a grease gun and some grease.  Tell them it's magic downtime preventer.  That bearing was dead long before the shock that made it unusable.

Welding,3cuk97,mystik3309,3,Fri Jul 10 22:07:52 2015 UTC,"It's good that you are taking a prep course, many people are unprepared for the actual examination.  I took my CWI 13 years ago, and I've heard it has gotten much harder.  I've had people tell me that the API exam takes some of the answers from the footnotes on certain tables, so make sure you research those.  Some of the questions and answers are worded to confuse you, so read carefully.  Here is a sample page so you know what to expect.  I recall some pretty poor quality photographs on the practical exam, hopefully they have corrected that. I remember one elliptical radiograph of a 2"" weld that was really bad.  Had I not had some radiographer experience I wouldn't have known what I was looking at.     I prefer to read the answers from the bottom up, this way if a possible answer is ""none of the above"" or ""all of the above"" or ""both a and b are correct"" it tips me off. Also if you discover that two answers are correct... select the most correct of the two.  There is a body of knowledge document that AWS publishes that estimates (via percentage) the categories.  So, on the fundamental exam, soldering is listed as 1%, and terms and definitions comes in at 12%."
Welding,3cuk97,3rdIQ,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:25:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the response! Yeah they've explained a lot to us about how it's changed. Like the code book now also has an annex a and an annex b. So not only do you have a all that other stuff to flip through but now there's two other different types of ""codes"". A is a code for pipelines that may give a more relaxed spec on welds. B is for strictly in service welds. It's confusing. As far as practical I've been told many times that's the only thing that busted people out. Next week is when I expect we'll go over mostly that. There's pictures on it they said, but also plastic samples we have to interpret. Needless to say I'm nervous! Im a welder so the welding parts are easy. I just helped a ndt guy with welding. They're lost on welding and know more about ndt and vice versa for me!  Edit: That same page is stuff we've been going over and pre testing A LOT on. These people are supposed to be the best there is so fingers crossed!"
Welding,3cuk97,3rdIQ,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:49:57 2015 UTC,Quite honestly the fundamental part of the examination is considered very difficult too. AWS takes terms and definitions seriously.
Welding,3cuk97,3rdIQ,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:15:48 2015 UTC,Yeah there's 150 questions on those but to be honest I feel pretty confident about that part. They've really hammered us with that this last week. We took a 150 question practice exam Friday and I made an 85. Not as good as if like but hey only 72 is required. These people deal with AWS a lot so the stuff they're giving us will be real close to what we'll see in the exam.
Welding,3cuk97,Seshan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:15:34 2015 UTC,"I recall in our practice exams, we limited the answer response to 30 seconds per question.  When I didn't know a particular answer I wrote the question number down on the provided scratch paper so I could come back to it later.  Often a future question will help you answer one of the ones you skipped.  Another tip is to verify the line on your answer sheet matches your test question. If you are one line off, all your answers will be wrong.  I checked this every 10 questions or so."
Welding,3cuk97,3rdIQ,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:19:49 2015 UTC,Yeah they were telling us about a guy that did that not to long ago. Got almost done with his test and realized he was one off.

Welding,3ctg8g,TimberWolfOne,3,Fri Jul 10 17:12:32 2015 UTC,"Depends on your company and experience/education.    We have a foreman that's started out as a helper, moved his way to fitter/mechanic, and finally a foreman. He's currently waiting for our industrial piping manager to retire because the guy below him is moving up. The foreman will move into the now newly open industrial piping assistant manager spot.  Are there guys more experienced in this that could have his job? Yes, of course. But none of them want the office spot. He does. It comes with a raise and a new truck. I can't blame him at all. Having someone from the field move into that spot will help us more than some guy out of college in my opinion.  He knows how hard it can be at times.  He also knows how jobs are actually ran opposed to how they ""should"" be ran.  Hope this helps.   Edit: the guys that don't want that job also don't want the headache that comes along with it.

He travels around from shop to shop and is exposed to a lot of different processes other than pipe now. He's more knowledgeable now about the industry than he was when he was in the field with me.

That's what schematic shows and as far as I can figure out, the German word doppeltaster means ""double switch"" or ""double button"". Your contactor switch apparently serves two separate functions. I'm guessing by the way it's shown in the simplified schematic, 1-3 contact initiates gas flow and/or hf start, and then 1-2 contact is for the arc. That's the only sense I can make of it with limited information.  All the Lincolns and Millers I have used with a torch contactor button only use two wires. In ""2t"" operation, that one switch is either open or closed. You would use 5 wires for a remote amptrol (power and ground for contactor solenoid + 3 needed for potentiometer)  It would help to know more about the welder."

Welding,3clcap,kippy3267,5,Wed Jul 8 23:28:15 2015 UTC,"That's a tough call to make, because no one makes anything quite like this set-up.   I own a landscaping company, and this is to hold my hand tools on the front of my trailer. It will hold: shovels, rakes, pitchforks, spades, backpack blower, (maybe?) water jug, anything and everything. The closest I could find was in the $250 range, not installed.   All in all, including consumables (6011 1/8"") I've got probably $60 at the most in this.   I'm no professional welder or fabricator, that's for sure, I have been fabricating for a few years now but only welding since this winter. If I was a pro, I'm sure I could have made this a lot quicker, I've got about 6 or 7 hours in this so far, and all I have left is to attach the rest of the tool holes (1 1/2"" pvc clamped to the lateral rails) and fab up and weld a backpack blower rack and water cooler rack, grind and paint. All in all I'll have probably 12ish hours in it, but today was rainy all day(thanks ohio) which is why I did this today.   I got all the steel from the scrap yard at $0.35/lb, so there was a huge savings on this project.   I just enjoy making things, so the money savings is not as important to me as the joy I get out of doing this, the customizability of the design, and the knowledge of how everything went together. Might not be right, might not be strong, but damn it I did it!  I'll post up an updated picture when I finish"

Eventually, those 6011's will crack from cyclic loads."

Gotta get stuff done!!"
Welding,3clcap,IronJim,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:02:19 2015 UTC,"Glad to hear it man. For what its worth, I prefer a 6010 over a 6011, but really just for the convenience of being able to to a 6g. They both have 60,000 lbs of tensile strength per square inch. Get some 7018's and try them out. That is what you would use for steel construction, because it flexes, and is stronger (70,000 lbs). If you use some 7018, turn your amps up to about 115, and just drag it, don't stitch. If you did it right, the flux will peel up in one solid snake like piece. If you ever need any advice throw me a PM. Or, r/welding is a great resource. Weld on brother"

Three of them ""mysteriously disappeared"" before somebody eventually noticed that one of the laborers had an unusually large and heavy cooler for a lunchbox.  Awesome little machine for how big it is. My only complaint was the lack of hot start, it takes a really heavy and purposeful scratch motion to light up 1/8"" 7018. I think it's because I'm used to welding on a machine with higher open circuit voltage. AFAIK there's no way to disable the low OCV safety feature on the baby Maxstars like you can on the larger 200. Also be aware they work fine with 6011, but in my experience they do NOT like 6010 at all.   The 150 Maxstars are also one of the few Miller models with completely intuitive model number suffix letters: The 150 comes in S, ST, and STH models. The S only does Stick,  The ST does stick and Touch start tig. The STH does stick and tig with High frequecy start.  You can also say that the S also stands for ""Stolen"" because the 150S is the one that's most frequently encountered both on construction sites and in pawn shops.

If you over roll something say 10mm at a high pressure that would be 100mm+ down the other end. Ive seen someone roll a bucket similar to this and he didnt take his time; 600mm over measurement.   I also think that spending an extra 10-20 minutes on the roller getting it perfect is better than spending X amount of hours fixing it when you build.

Welding,3cij49,SoulWager,2,Wed Jul 8 15:17:57 2015 UTC,"So I'm building a large project box / liquor cabinet that will sit on top of a mini-fridge. I did a fair amount of welding a decade ago, but since then, I've only welded something once or twice.  So here I am, trying to weld together two 14 ga. sheets of mild steel at a 90 degree angle, using some Lincoln .035 mild steel flux core wire.   The inexpensive fcaw welder (found here) shows setting it to 5.5 amps for 14 ga mild steel. There's some annoying spatter, but I seem to be running into issues with blowing holes in it when trying to make sure there's actually some fusion in the welds. Some spots it felt like it went great - decent weave, appears to have fusion, etc, others... not so much.   Also, I had some trouble starting an arc / keeping a steady arc. I ground the areas around the welds and where I put the clamp clean, and clipped the end of the wire between bouts of welding, but I'm not sure what else to do? Maybe move closer to the work? There's no feed speed settings on this thing.  I've got an imgur album with a few different shots, any pointers would be greatly appreciated."
Welding,3cij49,SoulWager,2,Wed Jul 8 04:38:57 2015 UTC,"Can you take a photo of the front panel of your machine? On the one you linked, it looks like the knob controls wire feed. If you can't adjust voltage, try faster travel speed.  As for arc stability issues, that might be caused by a crappy ground clamp."
Welding,3cij49,MT_Flesch,3,Wed Jul 8 06:22:40 2015 UTC,"Re the voltage / wire feed speed thing, /u/MT_Flesch made a nice catch and noticed that the owners manual indicates that the amperage knob also controls the wire feed speed. I've never worked with a welder like that, so good to know. When I was in school (sculpture program that had welding, not a proper welding school), they had really nice Miller machines that I totally took for granted, as they were the first I'd ever used. As a hobbyist, they're way out of my price range right now, but I miss all those controls."
Welding,3cgxaw,ThisIsFlight,6,Tue Jul 7 20:42:29 2015 UTC,"Dunno if you're doing this but make sure the end of the rod is bare metal, the flux can form a slag over the rod after you stop and make striking an arc a bit tricky. I usually just use the nearest cinder block or file, just something abrasive to chip it off. Also, when you're trying to light up again, try to long arc a bit, just for a second, hopefully that'll stop you sticking so much. Those are my go to tricks. Some machines have hot start or arc force functions you might want to play with, those may help.  Hopefully someone else has other techniques they'll share!"
Welding,3cgxaw,fuzzyalien77,3,Tue Jul 7 22:12:01 2015 UTC,"Hey! So, three methods I use. You can ""pinch off"" the end when the rod is still hot. You can hit the rod against the metal until the end breaks and strikes an arc (use your hood of course). Or you can take it out of the holder, tap it against a hard surface until the metal shows, ans put it back in.   Best of luck!"
Welding,3cgxaw,French_Mustache,2,Tue Jul 7 22:08:26 2015 UTC,"I used to use the ""pinch"" technique, because I copied it from my CWI/instructor back in school, but did that trick one too many times without realizing my glove had a hole in the thumb - yeeeoww!  Now, I have found that I've fallen into the habit of scratching the rod against the gauntlet of my left glove right after breaking the arc. If I'm working on a concrete floor (typical) sometimes I'll just bend down and drag the tip of the rod against the floor. As long as you do it within a second or two after welding, the slag berry is still molten and wipes right off. It's such a habit with 7018, I'll even catch myself doing it with 6011 sometimes (even though 6011 is totally unecessary to clean prior to restrike) and on longish 7018 stubs that I don't even have a need to restrike. Bonus perk is that it serves as alternate I.D. I can always spot when someone has made off with one of my left gloves. It's the only one you'll find  with all those little burnt sctratch lines on the cuff."
Welding,3cgxaw,OMW,3,Wed Jul 8 06:02:48 2015 UTC,"I have found that re striking an electrode with 7018 is very difficult due to the slag cap that forms, i either throw it away or pound it off.   [7018] If I'm in a shop with a belt sander ill reshape it to like new if most of the rod is left. (I did this in school, now that I buy my own rod, I just Pitch it and start new,)  6010, I personally have never had an Issue restarting.  6013, I usually can restart fine, but might need a quick tap on the base metal before the match style strike."
Welding,3cgxaw,Clicks_Anything,3,Tue Jul 7 22:25:12 2015 UTC,I carry a small metal file around with me or use the rough edge of my welpers to show bare metal again at the end.
Welding,3cgxaw,romasoccer,2,Wed Jul 8 00:29:23 2015 UTC,"If it's a flux issue and you're using 7018, then a rough file will do you wonders until you get the hang of flicking the rod after each pass. Simply file the end of the electrode until you see wire again. If you don't want to do this, then at the end of the pass, pull the electrode up off the work piece and simultaneously flick it in a safe direction. You will see a small blob of molten flux fly off and when you lift your hood, you'll see that the tip of the electrode has a little cylinder of good flux around the wire. Then before you strike up again, bang the rod on the concrete or (if you have to) on the workpiece to break that little cylinder and go for a restart.  If you're having issues with starting technique, then I suggest starting a little bit ahead of where you left off and long arcing it a tiny bit back until you hit that crater of the last bead. Once you get into the crater, get the rod down and hold a nice tight arc and resume welding. I use the long arcing technique all the time, and if you become proficient at it, you can use it to get over bumps or corners too."
Welding,3cgxaw,runt_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:51:23 2015 UTC,"Scratch like a match, basically put the tip down apply pressure and make a quick scratch and raise it about 3mm, if it fires awesome if not repeat. This motion will become instantaneous with practice, and your going to get a lot of practice. A little bit of slag has formed on the tip, that's what we're trying to scratch off.   As for your tie ins, scratch an inch ahead of your crater and bring the rod up 4mm, a long arc, swing the rod casually above the crater and lower it to 2mm a medium arc and try to fill the crater exactly without going wider or back onto the weld then touch the rod and start welding as you would by letting it drag. Practice these motions while your sitting on the couch and visualizing it, it will speed up your learning by making the movements automatic. Good luck 😉"
Welding,3cgxaw,moosecakems,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:15:50 2015 UTC,"Clean the tip like everyone else says. When the metal is still warm is magnetic and tends to stick way easier, let it cool for a few seconds then try striking again."
Welding,3cgxaw,bd_bandit,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:05:11 2015 UTC,If I have to restart I like to take the rod out of the stinger and scratch it on the table a little bit then put it back in and arc up.
Welding,3cgxaw,muppet_mafia,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:06:20 2015 UTC,"Not all sticks are made the same. Some will form slag over the end and you're trying to get electrisity to flow through something it doesn't want to. Most (like all really...) rods burn faster than the Flux around them so break off the excess so the actual metal and Flux is level with one another. Lastly, worth noting that electrodes are tapered at the end to make starting it easier, you're fighting yourself if you stop and restart with the same rod. Easiest way is to not stop, if you have to maybe grab another rod to continue your weld. I keep half used rods for tacking, but never use them to actually weld with. You can, it's just tough and in most cases not worth the trouble. But it's not you, it's not an easy thing to do, don't be shy about it. Hit the work and lift your electrode. Keep at it and you'll get it, or decide that MIG is ""better."""
Welding,3cgxaw,Pengwin126,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:08:49 2015 UTC,Profanity helps. Some electrodes types are worse than others at relighting. 7018 is my least favorite in that regard. 6011/6010 is usually pretty forgiving.

AC, especially from the older power supplies with high OCV (some had over 90 open circuit volts),  has been known to skip the warning altogether and just kill anyone who is unfortunate enough to serve as the most convenient path to ground.  Can't provide a definitive written source, but If you follow OSHA's fatality reports, you may notice a correlation between SMAW in wet conditions, AC current, and dead welders. Every welder electrocution report involving water/wet conditions I've read seems to also include the presence of an AC power suppy (also a definite trend of seeing older machines being most likely culprit, so I think that confirms my higher voltage AC + water = bad news theory).  Also worth mentioning for DC is that it's kind of pointless to use low hydrogen electrodes if you're exposing them directly to H2O . No lo-hy properties with damp electrodes, so added risk of hydrogen embrittlement is a legit quality concern with wet weather."

That even though it says 'weld-through', it isn't?"
Welding,3cgx4g,French_Mustache,2,Tue Jul 7 22:11:58 2015 UTC,"A picture would give us a better idea. But I bet that primer is to blame. Clean it off and try again. Also, be sure to check your weld settings. The table being a ""heat sink"" may also be something to consider."
Welding,3cgx4g,French_Mustache,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:20:52 2015 UTC,"Aye, thanks.    Pix would show ugly welds with blowouts(?)(anytime the welder pops, there's a void, not a weld, so instead of a nice even fill, I get like 1/2-3/4 of the plug hole filled and the rest is just a big mess of openness with the upper metal surface is burned away at the edges of the hole) (also, my long hair and beard start on fire)  My practice bits are not done on table--the cut out piece is self-supporting (the part I'm practice welding on is held above the ground by a curve), so no heat sink.  Pretty much exactly the way it is for the 'real' parts.   I'm thinking it's the primer, just hoping it's the primer, and I'm not neglecting something else that could be wrong.  Voltage is set at ""2"" (scale 1 to 10), and wire feed is set at about 7, I think (any slower and the wire vaporizes right back to the tip and then sticks to the tip.)  Stick out is about 1/4 inch.  On my practice piece, I get a nice, even sound when plug welding + I get a slightly convex fill with good penetration.  Takes about 3 seconds.  When just running a bead, I get a fairly flat, even bead.  As soon as I try on the real pieces (that have a coating of 'weldthrough primer' on them), spatter, pop, and holes."

You could use straight co2, gonna be a bit spattery and a little dirty, but nothiing a wire wheel can't polish up. Co2 changes the penetration shape as well into a more eggy oval shape instead of wide sides And a narrow root. If you have the option on your welder, drop your arc force slightly with that gas, as the co2 becomes reactive at Weld temp and starts digging around. I would personally advise a 75/25% mixture of co2/ar. It's super clean, burns in great, and just overall welds better. Hope this helps."

I think it would cost less in the long run and I could dial in the mix I need if I start welding stainless or aluminium."
Welding,3ce8w4,Tensaiteki,6,Tue Jul 7 06:56:44 2015 UTC,"Argoshield 25C is just C25 (25% CO2, 75% Argon) with a stupid marketing name.  Also, no, you cannot make a decent gas mixer with that set up. Accurate gas mixing is way more complicated than that (there is a reason they cost so much). It is not just a matter of  flow rates and pressures, you also have to account for the specific gravity of each gas as well as the fact that these are not ideal gasses so the Ideal Gas Law does not work.  Sure, you will get some sort of mixed gas out of it. But without a gas analyser, it will not be anywhere close to what you think it is. Keep in mind that a variance of even 3% CO2 content will have a large effect on the behavior of the weld."

Welding,3ce8w4,OMW,2,Tue Jul 7 12:47:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can use straight CO2 (C100). I works for several years (5) in a shop that used pure CO2 for pretty much all steel work (only exception being the rare use of C10 (10% CO2, 90% Argon) for spray transfer.  It is far cheaper than any mix containing argon. Since pure CO2 is liquid in the tank, the tanks last a very long time.  It will generate slightly more spatter than with the C25 (25% CO2, 75% Argon) you've been using and the beads will not be as smooth. C100 will require more voltage than C25 for similar wire feed speeds (and amperage), this will also result in slightly flatter welds (less humped up) and slightly greater penetration due to greater heat input."

Then it got funny again.  My curiosity took over and I had to look into it further. A quick google image search using that picture URL took me to this web page http://kinkybeds.com/thebed.html where it describes it as the following:    The modern geometric space frame style adds a new dimension to bed design. The main structural elements are made from our own unique design employing helical columns and triangular trusses with elaborate corner details. Elements are held together with hidden internal expanding clamps, producing an incredibly strong, stable structure to withstand even the most strenuous bondage session.

Even nice thick walled tubular manifolds can crack under hard track conditions.  It all really depends on end goals. Cheap, reliable track set up? logs all the way."
Welding,3c9pag,Boxman555,3,Mon Jul 6 23:12:26 2015 UTC,That thing is tiny.  I'll bet it's like that due to wedging a turbo onto a car that has no room for a turbo.

Welding,3c9pag,Boxman555,0,Mon Jul 6 20:17:17 2015 UTC,"That might be true but I'm not sure it's always worth it.  It's not impossible to imagine that the manifold could even perform better in some scenarios.  When it comes to turbos, almost all of the energy you collect is coming from the difference in temperature of the exhaust stream before and after the turbo.  There's some to be found in the momentum of the stream but you'll generally be better off feeding hotter exhaust into the turbo than sacrificing some of that to get better flow.  If your losing a lot of heat just to get your runners elegantly routed to the turbine, you'd probably be better off with a manifold."
Welding,3c9pag,lukeatron,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:33:28 2015 UTC,"In my experience, a more elegantly and correctly built tubular manifold will always increase horsepower, or at least reduce lag. The air doesn't have to fight a wall like it does with a tubular manifold. If you're talking about heat loss, imagine the energy being put into the wall of the log manifold, whereas a tubular one will move the hot air much more efficiently. I've seen 1200+ hp cars running an extremely long, thin wall tubular manifold, and let's just say those guys know what they are doing. But I'm the kind of guy that would rather do it right the first time, than mess with a tubular manifold. Everybody is an expert though ;)"

I think certainly, especially at the top end of performance where you're going to want to do whatever it takes to wring the last drops of performance out of the systems you'll get the most out of well designed tubular system like you're describing.  There can be other factors though, like money or in the case of Formula 1, size (they want the car to punch the smallest possible hole through the air).

Welding,3c58x2,frecel,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:55:36 2015 UTC,It's the same as the ubiquitous green jacket. Just black with fancy sleeves.  I short circuit mig in that jacket quite often. If you're dripping puddles on yourself you have something wrong with your settings.
Welding,3c58x2,Randomyeti,2,Thu Jul 9 00:42:22 2015 UTC,Leather for sure. Cape and apron combo are my personal favorite but a full jacket is better if you can handle the heat of one. Revco/black stallion has a great selection of quality gear at good prices.
Welding,3c58x2,shitterplug,2,Sat Jul 4 23:48:43 2015 UTC,"A denim shirt is always a good cheap first line of defence against sparks and spatter, $15-$30 and you are all set, or even less if you go to a Goodwill store. Then additionally for overheads it's good to have sleeves, Praxair sells these cheap green sleeves for about $20 they are made from cotton and soaked in something fire retardant, I've also seen cheap plain cotton sleeves on Amazon for less than $10. I also like to have a bandana on me, I like to tie it around my neck when I'm welding directly over my head and I know that some spatter might be headed directly behind my collar.  That solves your problem for less than $50."

Welding,3c4f6j,Stereotypy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:58:30 2015 UTC,"interesting; the person who trained me for the job i have now (metallurgy technical services) was a weld engineer who got her degree from ohio state, which from how i understand it is one of the few schools that offer a weld engineer degree. she didn't do anywhere near the scope or type of work that you've described though.  i dunno she was awful and psychotic and fat and ugly though and she freaked out on multiple people and got let go, and now i've gotta do all her work now. haha."
Welding,3c4f6j,metarinka,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:56:57 2015 UTC,"so without going on a long rant Ohio state is 'the only welding engineering program' My degree is welding engineering technology. Which means it was more hands-on I'm a pretty competent GTAW and GMAW welder and I hold a few certs, conversely Ohio state is more inline with a traditional engineering degree and it's more like a mechanical/material science degree with a focus on welding.   It's a good program if you want to do theoretical work like design, or hardcore research.    However, in my experience most companies want someone who can lead the welding department from experience and do all the technical tasks, understand or do NDT and just be a  ""go-to"" guy for welding.  Usually the ohio state guys fall short as they don't have a lot of practical engineering or welding experience. I've worked with a lot and count a few as friends and colleagues.  I love welding engineering but I'm slowly migrating away from it as I'm at the limit of where I want to be technically unless I go back and get a masters or PhD which I don't want to do. I love the field of welding engineering, but I want to grow and explore and not just become technically super deep in welding."

Welding,3c2s85,gamblingman2,4,Sat Jul 4 17:36:26 2015 UTC,"Pretty much.  The bigger communities require an amazing amount of work to keep them from going from gardens with a lot of weeds to pull to compost heaps.  I've interacted with mods from larger subs and do some stuff in askreddit and other subs where better tools would really help.  There are user built tools that sort of fill in some of the gaps, but actually getting the admins to step in in situations where they are legitimately needed has been a bit hit and miss.  Then having someone with little to no understanding of the community and user environment put in charge doesn't help when you have something that is inherently user built.  Its irrelevant, since the point of a CEO is to run the company, not interact with the end user, but it can make things awkward. There is a lot more that could be said, but the long and the short of it is that shit happens and people adapt to it and move forward. Either they migrate to other locations more amenable to themselves or they adapt to the local conditions."

CEO tries to make Reddit profitable so it can sustain itself in the long run and removes people who aren't willing to commit themselves for ideological reasons and the community throws a hissy fit.

Welding,3c33nd,French_Mustache,8,Sat Jul 4 08:14:12 2015 UTC,"Alright, so not totally welding related, but I wanted to pass this on:  Trains are surprisingly quiet!   Please, do not play in or around tracks. A cut of cars with or without an engine can sneak up on you very quickly, with very little warning as far as sound.   Finally, if you find a malfunctioning rail crossing, or you find anything stuck on the tracks like a stalled car, look around on the power boxes or crossing signs. There should be a toll free number on it that you can call to let the railway know what it going on. You could potentially save a life."

Welding,3c33nd,French_Mustache,3,Sat Jul 4 19:19:20 2015 UTC,"Most of the noise comes from the power, and defects with the tracks. The freight cars themselves are very quiet."

I look out of the screen and there's a two dumbasses moving the platform down to the other end of the shop without warning anyone or checking behind welding curtains.   Platform was probably only 5'x5' but still."

Welding,3c33nd,French_Mustache,7,Sat Jul 4 14:40:01 2015 UTC,"MT_Flesch has a great list, and I would like to add pinch points to that. When metal and bone meet, metal wins every time. Be sure you're aware of where your body is, how it is handling your material, and any moving parts."
Welding,3c33nd,ecclectic,4,Sat Jul 4 15:11:10 2015 UTC,"Adding to the list:  Falls. Fall restraints suck, they can be uncomfortable, limiting and a pain in the groin if they aren't kept UN good condition, but sudden deceleration syndrome sucks a lot harder.  Rails, harnesses and other barriers are there for a reason.  Fatigue is another  really common thing.  Welders can work under tremendous heat with few breaks and it can really take a toll on the body that goes way beyond ""man up and deal with it."" Working at minimal oxygen levels is another common ""injury"", it's pretty easy to get careless and a bit disoriented.  Back injuries and other lifting related injuries are really common as well.  Generally if there are tools to o  a job, use them. Cranes, hoists etc."

Welding,3c1jz8,tryin_to_weld,4,Sat Jul 4 00:07:58 2015 UTC,"I did a lot of research before buying an Everlast 200DX. I love it but I definitely understand it's not top-of-the-line. It's also less than  half the cost of something like a Miller 200 DX but has most, if not all of the features. I think I paid ~$1200 for mine.   Do you need to weld aluminum or other materials that require an AC wave? If not then you can save even more money. If you need AC then I'd highly suggest getting a welder that has a frequency and pulse adjustment. I messed around with mine and definitely noticed a better bead when dialing in the frequency. The pulse ability really helps to reduce heat input into the piece which reduces warping. Hope this helps!"
Welding,3c1jz8,dime_stacker,4,Sat Jul 4 01:34:39 2015 UTC,"I have a Miller Multimatic 200. It does TIG, MIG, stick. TIG is DC only so no aluminum. I have a Miller Spoolmate 100 spool gun to mig aluminum on it. Works great for my needs. Very flexible system.

Welding,3c1d0w,mingilator,2,Sat Jul 4 22:35:03 2015 UTC,"Because they aren't portable without a big expensive genset.  Not every job can be completed in the shop, and unlike a lot of machine tools I've retrofitted, you can't hook a VFD up in front of a welder to convert single phase input to 3 phase power.  Also, unlimited funds doesn't mean you've gotta be a moron with how you spend...at my parents place my dad once inquired on what it would take to get 100 amp 3 phase 230V service in the garage, power company told him ~$35k to get it to the pole and then he'd be responsible for getting it from pole to subpanel inside garage."

Laying a nice bead can be hard for me and I get alot of the times where the weld dosent penetrate and just balls up around where I want to be welded. I need some basic tips and tricks on tig welding.
Welding,3bzu0l,wiretapp,7,Fri Jul 3 17:18:00 2015 UTC,"watch this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNAAhwieNhU  read this:  http://www.weldingtipsandtricks.com/tig-welding-tips.html  links to the rest of the tips #8-#28 are at the bottom.  If you're lacking pen while tig welding slow down, and use more amperage  and check that gas flow isn't too low OR to high.    and clean everything.    wipe down your filler rod no more than 5 mins before you use it. Oxidation happens instantly."
