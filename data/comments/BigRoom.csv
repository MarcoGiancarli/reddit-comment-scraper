BigRoom,3dj6id,clungedestroyer5000,5,Thu Jul 16 20:21:59 2015 UTC,"Why is it that former Hardstyle artists make the best Bigroom? Showtek, Headhunterz and now Crystal Lake have all joined the Bigroom bandwagon and have made some of the best Bigroom I've heard in years. Here's to more massive Bigroom tunes from these artists!"
BigRoom,3dj6id,psychic_subwoofer,5,Thu Jul 16 20:34:29 2015 UTC,"I think it's because all the hardstyle guys like Headhunterz, DBSTF, and Showtek are actually really talented producers in a lot of different genres. They just don't get as much recognition with hardstyle because it's a rather obscure genre."
BigRoom,3dce34,redheadfever,3,Wed Jul 15 04:18:16 2015 UTC,Do you have a Spotify playlist of this or something? Would love it for the gym

BigRoom,3cp9h5,shades3370,2,Fri Jul 10 02:15:17 2015 UTC,When I heard Hey by bassjackers a few years ago they were instantly my favorite producers and I lost my face when they played it live. Since then... It's been mostly the same old shit. So what I do is listen to podcasts from 2008-2012 which is the stuff that was being produced that really made this scene blow up. The past few years has just been clones of clones of clones. But check out the toxic avenger for some unique stuff.
BigRoom,3cp9h5,Rocketbird,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:56:51 2015 UTC,"Cause sadly... dance music aka ""EDM"" has already turned into a major trend around the world. When you have a certain culture, lifestyle, hobby, art, etc gain limelight into the mass audience, don't be surprised that it will degrade/simplify the quality. You know, cause it will be easier for the audience to consume. So you have these motherfuckers (producer/djs/labels/etc) taking advantage of the party people/young adults who don't give about the quality of music but straight up want loud noise that supports the feeling of getting fucked up at many massives/events aka ""raves"". 99% of the music we post in here are guilty about it lol. Don't worry, the ""EDM"" sound can only stay on the spotlight for so long, there's always a cycle that it goes down to the underground and the quality of music will rise up, easier to compete/reach others when it's not under the mass audience's magnifying glass."
BigRoom,3cp9h5,I_am_who,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:49:17 2015 UTC,At least in the U.S. It seems to be dying down from where it was 2-3 years ago.

BigRoom,3cc3a4,Strongbad536,2,Tue Jul 7 03:21:00 2015 UTC,Depends if it's released as a Beatport exclusive.  It takes about 2 weeks or more to come out on Spotify after being released as a Beatport exclusive.
