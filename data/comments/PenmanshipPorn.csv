PenmanshipPorn,3dyq86,coqdorysme,6,Mon Jul 20 16:53:17 2015 UTC,"as penmanship goes, this is great. From a design standpoint, I would go with a block/serif font for the ""quartet"" part..."
PenmanshipPorn,3dyq86,esteban42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:44:00 2015 UTC,"It might actually be a geometric sans-serif in the end, without that little curlicue, just so it covers both the ""classical"" and ""modern"" angles."
PenmanshipPorn,3dyq86,emmaleeatwork,3,Tue Jul 21 02:55:53 2015 UTC,"The elixir part looks great, but the quartet looks a little weird. I think its the small uppercase Q, same size uppercase? u, and then uppercase A."
PenmanshipPorn,3dyq86,fire_dawn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:41:52 2015 UTC,Love the elixer part. I know an Elixir Trio! Cool name.

It also looks like Elysee created (or I might have this backwards) ST Dupont pens, which this set looks a lot like:  http://imgs.inkfrog.com/pix/UncleDearest/S_T_DUPONT_ELYSEE_TRADITIONAL_GOLD_LINES_BALL_POINT_PEN.jpg"
PenmanshipPorn,3dw5sz,HardKnockRiffe,6,Mon Jul 20 04:52:37 2015 UTC,"It appears to be an Elysee for Elegance pens, but other than that I have no clue about it's origin or value. Any information will be greatly appreciated, thank you."
PenmanshipPorn,3dw5sz,IncompetentFork,14,Mon Jul 20 01:07:02 2015 UTC,Perhaps a closer-up or clearer photo of the pen itself? It might help identify the specific style of it.
PenmanshipPorn,3dw5sz,I_STOP_ALL_PUNS,2,Mon Jul 20 02:47:08 2015 UTC,try /r/handwriting as well.

PenmanshipPorn,3doj57,tehsalt,10,Sat Jul 18 06:39:50 2015 UTC,Is the pen low on ink or is that how it is supposed to look?
PenmanshipPorn,3doj57,dathymes,11,Sat Jul 18 10:04:44 2015 UTC,yes.
PenmanshipPorn,3doj57,Tift,5,Sat Jul 18 12:38:56 2015 UTC,It's not a Yes/No question D:
PenmanshipPorn,3doj57,Salvatio,4,Sat Jul 18 13:46:50 2015 UTC,Yes.
PenmanshipPorn,3doj57,HumongousFunguses,2,Sat Jul 18 13:50:27 2015 UTC,Correct!
PenmanshipPorn,3doj57,MyNameIsOP,3,Sat Jul 18 15:17:24 2015 UTC,"no, it is two separate questions in which the answer to both is yes.  The pen is low on ink and that is how it is supposed to look."
PenmanshipPorn,3doj57,Tift,3,Sat Jul 18 14:03:18 2015 UTC,"Or, if you're a pedantic logician, it's if either are true - xor could be used here"
PenmanshipPorn,3doj57,paultag,4,Sat Jul 18 14:44:34 2015 UTC,It is low on ink but that is a texture they were going for. It can also be done with a more  saturated brush and look solid colored.
PenmanshipPorn,3doj57,AintNoHollenbackGirl,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:04:07 2015 UTC,do you know what pen that is specifically? I can't get my lettering to have that kind of grit/gradient.
PenmanshipPorn,3doj57,Flexappeal,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:02:31 2015 UTC,Looks like a brush pen.
PenmanshipPorn,3doj57,Ansoni,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:30:16 2015 UTC,"It's a brush pen. The most popular brand is pestle, Zig or tombow. Tombows usually have more of the dense ink look but that depends on how much ink you have left too. You can get ones that you fill the handle with water (to use with watercolor paint) or ink."
PenmanshipPorn,3doj57,AintNoHollenbackGirl,2,Sat Jul 18 21:13:37 2015 UTC,Hmm. Feels good.
