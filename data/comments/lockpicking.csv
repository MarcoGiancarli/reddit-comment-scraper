When the cold water ran into the frozen lock it refroze itself, and expanded; breaking (shattering) the lock from the inside. highly unlikely, but very macgyver."

The setting was a bit contrived and it was a ""challenge"". They were put into situations with limited resources, but they found the lightbulb because it stood out (it was not a typical lightbulb). And TV does not like to show actual lock picking.  But, from the look of it, I would say it would have been possible.  Although, I could have seen much easier ways to get out than picking a lock."

They both look exposed to the elements, so the No 5 might be a bit difficult to pick depending on how smoothly it operates. But it has four pins without any security pins.  The 6121 has at least 5 pins and will have security pins (spool) pins and would take more time.  Lock picking is an art, so it is difficult to say how hard it would be, but it would be ""moderately"" difficult for a lock picker.   EDIT: That different view shows that it is indeed a No 5.

lockpicking,3e0mm0,TheTarquin,3,Tue Jul 21 01:16:41 2015 UTC,"More info:  5 straight pins, no security pins, no anti-bump, no trap pins.  Key way is narrow with moderately aggressive curvature.  Made it a bit tough to get picks in and to maneuver them about, but was able to get it pretty easily using a 4mm tension tool and my shallowest Southord pick.  Shackle is free-floating and is captured when open by a wedge-shaped catch in the lock body.  I assume this means it will also have a wedge catch in the lock mechanism, and is should, in theory, be shimmable, but the actual lock mechanism is obscured by a circular, spring-loaded plate in the shackle-way.  EDIT: Finally managed to get a semi-decent pic of the keyway - http://imgur.com/aKWqblc"

lockpicking,3e21ni,XMY420X,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:23:43 2015 UTC,"My experience is that buying a bunch of tools in a kit results in a lot of waste unless one is specifically going to be using all the kit offers (which would be rare).  Peterson tools are also very expensive compared to competitors.  I think it would be best for one to buy individual pieces and construct one's own tool kit rather than buying an expensive set like that.  Of course, one can do whatever one wants with one's own money, but unless one would have been willing to buy each piece of that set individually, I think it would be better to buy the individual picks and tools from a variety of manufacturers of one's choice."
lockpicking,3e21ni,JosephFaolan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:52:53 2015 UTC,I see what you are saying. I would rather build my own kit in the long run. But for now I have just a small idea of what I want. I was leaning towards this because it seems that if I were to expand further in picking this kit would be able to back me up. I could purchase it but it's hard to rationalize spending that much when I don't need all of them just yet or possibly ever. I will be doing much more research but I do appreciate your reply.
lockpicking,3e21ni,JosephFaolan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:45:43 2015 UTC,"That kit is full of lock specific tools, which I do not think most people in locksport would use (and which few locksmiths would use).  If you get a set, I would recommend a set which gave a good mix of picks and, more importantly, a good variety of tension tools.  For Peterson, I noticed that their picks are ""old fashioned"". You get many picks which, frankly, I do not think are that useful at all.  Their small sets look to be a better value.  If you were not restricted to Peterson, I would also recommend you check out SouthOrd and Southern Specialties and Sparrows (among others).   You seem to have enough money to get a wide variety of good tools."
lockpicking,3e21ni,JosephFaolan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:19:11 2015 UTC,At this point I don't have many expenses. I can live on less than $100 a month and I make far more than that. So I can spoil myself a little. This is something I am genuinely interested in and look to further my interest for years to come. I am not sure what tools would be best making a 10 to 14 piece kit from scratch. I have read the beginner's guide on this thread and it seems somewhat minimalist. I am looking for one order I can place where I won't have to make another order for at least a year or so. I am trying to build the ideal kit right off the bat.
lockpicking,3e21ni,ith,4,Tue Jul 21 15:37:57 2015 UTC,"There is an advantage to getting a lot of things to try, but most people only have a few tools they really use.  For me, I use only three picks when picking most of the time.  The set you are looking at has a lot of lock specific bypass tools.   If you wanted them, that is fine, but if you did not, it may be a waste.   You could get a couple of different sets and get more variety of what you would actually want to use (if you were not interested in those specific bypass tools) instead.  That way, you can try a bunch of things and settle on what you want to use for future orders.  Also, because one or two picks get used far more than the others, they wear out faster, so you should be prepared to order individual picks to replace the ones you like to use.  Personally, I have four of one pick design that I use!  With your budget, you could also get a good pick set, and then get specialty picks, such as for tubular locks.   But remember, having a wide variety of picks does not generally help much, but having a wide variety of tension tools does help."

I have a handful of picks that came in sets I bought thinking more tools would be good, but now they sit until I grind them down and turn them into a pick I need and will actually use.  What JosephFaolan said about tension wrenches is also important - I have more tension wrenches now than picks I think. What good is a nice pick if you can't get tension on the lock, right?  Knowing what I know now, I would buy a few picks to start, or a small set that includes a few hooks, a few rakes (including bogatas) and several tension wrenches."

In the USA, some states require extensive apprenticeships and licensing. Others have no such regulations at all and it is run as just another business.  Locksmiths also can work in various fields. Locksmiths may work for institutions to work within that institution or work in their own businesses.  They may focus on lockouts and residential locks. Others may focus on lock and security system installations.  Because of the width of the field, locksmiths may do very different things.   Lock picking almost always is a very small part of the job though. Making keys, keying locks, and opening automobiles are often a very big part of it."

I have gotten so frustrated working on a lock before that I decided to pick something else that I had picked many times before just so I could have a win of some sort. But, I wasn't able to pick it either. I have been told by many that it is important to just walk away for a bit. Just this weekend I was working on SPP a challenge lock I was sent, and I couldn't get anywhere. I was s frustrated. I set it down for over 24 hours and didn't try again until last night, and was able to finally pick it, twice!  So, relax, take a step back for a bit, and you'll be OK.  :)"

The nice thing about the selection of picks you have is they are geared towards individual pin picking, which will teach you a lot compared to things like rakes and bump keys (which are more about quick entry than manually manipulating the lock.)

If you can get good a picking individual pins, instead of just raking, it is a good thing. With different locks, you're going to find your self using different ones, even though they all look very similar. I have one very similar to the fifth one in and I find that is the one that I use most. The sixth one in would be great too. You could really feel the pins with that one. As long as you have enough room in the keyhole, that is a fun one to use.  If you keep posting in here, you're going to get some good advice.

Is this security mechanism typical on cheaper locks?    what you are asking about is the binding order. You never know what pin will set first because of machining tolerances in all locks. It's a good rule to start in the rear but some locks have too small of a keyway to do this. If your getting movement in pin 1 when applying tension then pin 1 is not your first pin to set. Push past and try pin 2 or 3.

If that master key gets lost, they have to replace each and every single lock, costing a fortune depending on how many locks are being replaced (This happened at my school a few years before I arrived, cost them multiple tens of thousands). Instead, with these news locks, if you had a master keycode you simply change it.   The ability to give different people different codes instead of a single key allows you to know who is accessing your house. It doesn't state in the commercial, but programmatically you could set it so the dog walker only has access from 9:00am - 11:00am, can't do that with keys.   If your house was burglarized with no signs of false entry, you could check who entered the house and when.   Yes, you can forget a passcode, but that's far more difficult then losing a key is.

And what happens if the lock gets a big electric shock? Being locked by default would be terrible in case of fire so I can imagine it will open then. (Has anyone tried?)"

If you can't get in that situation, simply hide a camera somewhere and zoom in a lot.   Every system is going to have some weak points. Hopefully you are entering the pin in a way to block anyone from seeing it, but user error is probably the main weakness in this system.    And what happens if the lock gets a big electric shock? Being locked by default would be terrible in case of fire so I can imagine it will open then. (Has anyone tried?)   I hope they tested it for an electric charge, otherwise thieves way be using batteries to break into your home. In a fire if you are inside then you can get out no matter what. If outside then it is no different then a normal lock, it could still be locked and the situation is the same."
lockpicking,3dmmjd,Lampwick,0,Fri Jul 17 19:09:42 2015 UTC,"It may be more expensive upfront, but think of college dorms, apartment buildings, etc that have many locks, and a master key.    Not just up front. The cost of time and materials to replace the goddamned batteries on those things is ongoing, and not insignificant.   If that master key gets lost, they have to replace each and every single lock, costing a fortune   That's why we don't issue that master key to anyone. People get a submaster, so we only have to rekey a small section.  The big problem with electronic access control is the constant maintenance. Mechanical locks can (and do) function for decades without trouble. The facility I work at has locks from when it first opened in 1932. There is nothing in the access control sphere that even approaches that degree of reliability. Large facilities tend to have locksmiths on staff and well defined key issuance policies. In cases like that, the only real advantage to electronic access control is for auditing and setting access schedules.    The ability to give different people different codes instead of a single key allows you to know who is accessing your house.   No, it only allows you to know whose code was used to get in. Keypad entry is worse than keys, because you can ""copy"" a four digit code by looking over someone's shoulder."
lockpicking,3dmmjd,ferthur,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:04:21 2015 UTC,"Worse yet, having multiple codes decreases the number set you have to attack in order to find a working code. It's unfortunate that everyone is so stuck on four digit codes."

lockpicking,3dmmjd,NuggetDestroyer,2,Fri Jul 17 22:08:06 2015 UTC,For a safe - KABA x-10 http://www.locksmithledger.com/article/11369014/the-evolution-of-the-x-10-safe-lock  For a commercial door - KABA Simplex L1000 or E-plex 5000 if access must be audited.   For a residential door - KABA Simplex 919 with a latch as opposed to a deadbolt
lockpicking,3dmmjd,theazman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:28:25 2015 UTC,"I guess that would depend on what you want it for. If it's because you think a lock with an electronic keypad is more secure then you don't actually want a keyless lock, you want a lock with two factor authentication, meaning it requires both the key and the pin every time. I don't know of any locks like that on the market, but even if both factors were relatively easy to defeat, requiring an attacker to defeat both of them is better than allowing entry when just one of them is defeated.  If you just want the convenience of a keyless lock, i don't know that there's really a significant difference between brands, but i'd look for one that solves the problem of how you're supposed to open the lock from the outside when the batteries are dead on the inside and you don't have a key."

lockpicking,3dmmjd,cenobyte40k,2,Fri Jul 17 22:41:32 2015 UTC,"I'm actually inherently leery of any sort of biometric locks. I have this totally irrational fear that someday, someone will use a copy of my fingerprints they got off a print reader somewhere and use them to frame me for a crime and i'll be on the run like Dr Richard Kimball. Obviously, it's totally unfounded because fingerprint readers don't even store a copy of your prints, but i still won't go near them."
lockpicking,3dmmjd,Nailclippers,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:20:29 2015 UTC,Quite a few fingerprint readers do store images of your prints.  They're just as prone to shitty security as anything else.  It's like websites that store your passwords in plaintext  - dumb as hell but appears to work.
lockpicking,3dmmjd,cenobyte40k,2,Sat Jul 18 00:29:04 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine that is true. It would actually require more processing power and more storage to keep a copy on file instead of just the point data on it, otherwise they would have to calculate the data on the fingerprint each time.  Sure it might store that data in plain easy to read language that might make the system less secure but it's not the same as having a copy of someone's fingerprint. And because these systems often use proprietary reading systems, even the data might not be useful in tricking another reader somewhere else."

lockpicking,3dnp4x,ith,5,Fri Jul 17 19:59:33 2015 UTC,I'd retire any of them that are twisted and beat up. Keep those to remember gramps by and replace them with like so you won't be tempted to use (and maybe break) them. Grampa was a heavy handed dude.
lockpicking,3dnp4x,70Bobby70,3,Fri Jul 17 22:10:53 2015 UTC,That seems like a good idea.  A lot of the picks seem to be a bit softer and on the malleable side.  I couldn't tell if it's because they are old or because of manufacturing.

Well, I use them all and needed more! They are easy to make. It might be fun to make your own, to add to the sentimentality of the set."
