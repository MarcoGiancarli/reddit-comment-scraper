CrossView,3e4ohs,early_birdy,2,Tue Jul 21 22:51:09 2015 UTC,It moves when I do!
CrossView,3e4ohs,godlyguitar,3,Tue Jul 21 22:53:20 2015 UTC,"Weird, it looks backwards (concave) to me. Does anyone else see this, or is it just me?"
CrossView,3e4ohs,ggchappell,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:32:16 2015 UTC,"You're probably not looking at it cross-eyed. If you prefer a parallel-view stereo image, then check out the original."
CrossView,3e4ohs,godlyguitar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:59:03 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely looking at it cross-eyed. (I'm not even sure how to do a parallel-view...) Weird. For whatever reason, my brain is interpreting it as a hollow bowl rather than a sphere. Oh well, it's still a great cross-view!"
CrossView,3e3ly3,Thumpster,6,Tue Jul 21 18:20:30 2015 UTC,"This might be one of the best stereoscopic videos I've seen; the motorcyclist kind of ruins it by being on opposite sides of each screen, but, if you look past it, everything else is very well defined."
CrossView,3e3ly3,scurriloustommy,4,Tue Jul 21 19:42:18 2015 UTC,"This rider is testing/comparing two GoPro models. At 1:10 we get a side by side view from both cameras.  They don't line up perfectly, but I found if I tilted my head left a bit and focused an a object further from the camera the effect came through nicely."
CrossView,3e3ly3,gantzphere,2,Tue Jul 21 18:22:40 2015 UTC,Not working for me.
CrossView,3e3ly3,alexropo,3,Tue Jul 21 19:04:21 2015 UTC,"I can get some of the cars to line-up but i can't keep a focus on the whole image, Makes sense that it wasn't intended."
CrossView,3e3ly3,MyOtherAltIsAHuman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:33:30 2015 UTC,"If you ever have a problem with focus, cover your left eye with your left hand so it can't see the left image, and cover you right eye with your right hand so it can't see the right image. Your vision will just snap to the proper focus without having to manually cross your eyes.  That being said, this video is pretty painful. At fullscreen, it was unwatchable. Watching it embedded on this page makes it tolerable, if you focus ahead and not on the motorcycle."
CrossView,3e3ly3,alexropo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:39:27 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't have a problem usually but I'm sure this tip is good.
CrossView,3e3ly3,Hamm1701,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:00:32 2015 UTC,Why does this make my eyes water so much faster than other ones? Are my eyes just week?

CrossView,3dzwq0,weedtese,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:53:10 2015 UTC,"Typical example of a photo which is best seen in 3D. Good job!   The 2D picture would not be this interesting, because the sculpture blends with the background."
CrossView,3dzwq0,Mr_Smartypants,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:37:16 2015 UTC,This one hurts for some reason.  Too much parallax.
CrossView,3dzwq0,heyhowareyaa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:50:48 2015 UTC,Here is the staticflickr so you can save the image easier.  http://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5135/5448835751_1f43fca535_b.jpg

CrossView,3dxjdg,onceamennonite,2,Mon Jul 20 10:33:26 2015 UTC,These are among the best I've seen on this subreddit--how did you take them?
CrossView,3dxjdg,yeartwo,2,Mon Jul 20 22:50:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks, glad you enjoyed them.  Here's too much information about how I shoot. :-)  Anyway, three of the four were taken with a little dedicated twin-lens Fujifilm camera.  The one from the Zeppelin field is a cha-cha with maybe two steps between shots, because of being so far from the subject.  Still a little travel camera though!"
CrossView,3dxjdg,NotMikeLitoris,2,Tue Jul 21 01:16:06 2015 UTC,Dat motion blur. Do you have a 3D rig with two cameras?
CrossView,3duusu,Stereotron,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:22:49 2015 UTC,"Wow, the cutout works perfectly for me. This cross view really stands out."
CrossView,3dt4sy,indridcold137,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:05:11 2015 UTC,this is one of those images that only works if you can see it in 3d. otherwise it's just a jumbled mess

CrossView,3dsfw9,coram_iudice,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:39:58 2015 UTC,I like how the sides of the photos make it look like it was taken on a photoshoot with a backdrop. It adds even more depth to the picture.
CrossView,3dq4gn,onceamennonite,3,Sat Jul 18 10:25:37 2015 UTC,"I always love when reflections have more depth, like on the marble wall in the first picture."
