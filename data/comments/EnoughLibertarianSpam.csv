None of this matters, though, because I will not accept the libertarians' basic assumptions before attempting to justify seat belt laws. ie: I am not going to go through convoluted logic to try to prove why not wearing a seat belt or motorcycle helmet affects others and is therefore not a nanny state law.  Because it is a nanny state law. And it is a nanny state law because some people are too stupid to take care of themselves. And since we (Well, not me personally.

Skydiving, for example.  Two: It allows a libertarian to say ""Well just don't treat them and let them die unless they pay everything.""  But really the problem is that it buys into the libertarian world view, which is that everything is dollars, everything is about money, everything can be quantified.  If I ruled the world, and if not wearing seat belts had 0 impact outside the individual not wearing the seat belt I would still require them. Because it's not about money."

EnoughLibertarianSpam,3d0w1z,Immanuelrunt,7,Sun Jul 12 19:55:02 2015 UTC,"I do dislike Kant, at least in application, as I'm a hardcore utilitarian. HARDCORE! That said, I meant it more as irony, because Ayn Rand famously hated Kant and some of the other AnCap/Libertarian ""leading lights"" were similarly unkind about Kant.  Thus, their ideology can be seen as hypocritical to the degree it relies upon categorical imperatives and mores."
EnoughLibertarianSpam,3d0w1z,kwhitegocubs,10,Sun Jul 12 20:07:42 2015 UTC,"Firstly, there aren't many categorical imperatives, it's just the one, the agreement of all reasonable creatures as such in the deliberative standpoint, formulated in several different ways (with  the formula of the univeral law, the formula of the humanity as an end and of the kingdom of ends being the most well known). There are different duties towards reason (which is another way of saying that there are different things that pure practical reason commands categorically of itself) which are derived from it in reference to other people or ourselves, but there is just the one moral law, which coincedes with autonomy and reason. That's the categorical imperative and it's so far away from anything AnCaps believe in, it needs binoculars to spot them.  Secondly, while AnCaps love to pretend they are deontologists, mostly because it meshes well with their intolerable self-righteousness, their deontological philosophers (on which I must remark. ""AnCap deontological philosophers"" is a phrase much like ""the holly roman empire"", in that they are neither anarchist, nor deontologist, nor philosophers), that is the 'Bard and his friends, are peddling an account -which I have read- that more closely (but not quite since it's not agent-centred, either) approximates very bad virtue ethics. I have also noticed this with Rand (that is neither a consistent egoist, nor a consistent deontologist). They are all moving through hypothetical imperatives and trying to find a shared value-charged (so an objectivist account of the) good. That doesn't match either categorical ethics that don't focus on the good, or utilitarianism where the universally shared good is supposed to be strictly descriptive. So bad virtue ethicists? bad perfectivists? bad philosophy either way. That's a remark fit for those of them that are at least trying to give a bad justification for their central moral concepts like self-ownership, seeing that most of their drones just take it for granted and go from there (seeing as their thinking is foundationalist, they think they just need the given to go on an on in a cartesian deductive format), which more closely resembles deontology in form, but is more like bad divine command theory, I guess. I'm saying all this to conclude that their theories have nothing at all to do with the categorical imperative. Hell, their only theorist that could properly be conceived as a deontologist at all would be Huemer and he's a moral intuitionist.   Their deontological constraints are pulled right out of thin air. This must be understood. Their theories are not actually coherent theories. They are a collection of mismatched corporatist apologia coated with liberal amounts of rhetoric.  I'm sorry for ranting, but I recently relapsed to Kantianism and I am mortified at the idea of them abducting him and fucking his shit up like they did to Locke and those other guys. They destroy everything they touch, man. They are like pesky little goblins or something.  Don't take this the wrong way. My posts are never supposed to be read in a hostile voice.

However, Libertarians and Ancaps are actively working to undermine the only form of representation many human beings have; both in the developed world and developing world. They want to usurp government and replace it with a dystopian reality where those with the most amount of money and influence can essentially do what they want under the auspices of the ""free market,"" while denying those who aren't Captains of Industry an effective representative body.   While they are human beings, they're also human beings with a selfish agenda who, if given the opportunity, will allow and even celebrate someone starving to death on the street or dying from a preventable disease because that person had the unfortunate luck of being born in a time when the silly ideologies of basement dwelling neckbeards became a reality.

The pay, your ability to make payments on the other expenses in your life, the time and risk of looking for another job and possibly not finding one. It also makes the assumption that one has unlimited viable alternatives of equal or superior quality, which anyone knows isn’t the case.

The law would be something like this: You get a license to discriminate, as long as you can prove there is a commercial venture within a certain amount miles of your store that provides a similar service (distance can vary depending on natural rarity of the service being provided) to your store that does not desire to discriminate in a similar way that you do. When a party you wish to discriminate against comes in the store, they must be immediately informed that they will not be served, why they will not be served, and directed to the nearest competitor, but, and here's the kicker: they must PAY the discriminated party a rate of cash per mile, they would have to travel in order to obtain that service. The rate would be based on the average cost it takes to travel a mile in the city, both in maintenance for the average mode of transport used, and the opportunity cost incurred by how long it takes to take such a trip. Because the whole point we rely on the free market is to provide cheaper, more easily accessible services to all people, if you wish to compromise that, then you must pay the population for taking that away from them. So every time an openly gay person walks into your bakery and you don't want to serve them and the nearest bakery is 5 miles away, then pay them 5 dollars to go to that bakery instead. I would go into such a bakery every day, pretend to be gay, and demand a cupcake, and walk away with either the cupcake, or 5 dollars in my hand, almost every day. There could be apps that track such stores and how much you could get from them by claiming your need of their service and there could be a coordinated effort to put them out of business by people coming in every day, demand their service, and be turned away with compensation for being inconvenienced. Discriminated minorities would get a nice chunk of change, and stupid bigots would be put out of business. Win win."

EnoughLibertarianSpam,3cxznv,Rflkt,16,Sun Jul 12 09:14:55 2015 UTC,It can create jobs when the previous minimum wage was causing workers to be paid an amount below their marginal revenue product. If workers are being paid below their MRP it creates a monopsony which causes unemployment. Increasing the wage so that workers are making their MRP eliminates the monopsony and therefore lowers unemployment.
EnoughLibertarianSpam,3cxznv,DeseretRain,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:04:28 2015 UTC,"What? The MRP is talking about the revenue of the business. That has nothing to do with min wage, but the amount of employees affecting revenue.  That doesn't create a monopsony. A monopsony is basically when the business has labor market power and can hold wages low because of the excess supply. They keep it low to maximize profits. Increasing the wage will force the business to increase labor. By how much depends on if the new minimum wage is above the supposed market equilibrium. If it's above, quantity of labor has increased, but there is additional unemployment because QS of labor is no longer equal to the QD of labor. Increasing it above the market equilibrium means that you're actually creating unemployment. If you left it at the current equilibrium then your labor has increased with no unemployment. Either way they're not maximizing profits because the MC is higher.   But guess what? That's where we are now. We are at the market equilibrium. Adding in monopsony wage didn't do anything as we don't really have monopsonies. So... increasing wage leads to unemployment as far as classical theory is concerned.   The reality is different than theory here. Theory tells us high unemployment, but the reality says that's not the case. The problem with just looking at theory is that you can take into account many different factors that affect employment. Ceteris paribus, my friend, can work against you.  Have you read any journal articles discussing this? If so, link please."

Additionally, more than 600 economists, seven of them Nobel Prize winners in economics, have signed onto a letter in support of raising the minimum wage to $10.10 by 2016.

In other words, that is not a study and it doesn't provide evidence of anything either way because there are a virtually infinite number of other factors that aren't controlled for in such a simple analysis.  They don't even seem to be controlling for labor force participation, and anyone who has been paying attention is aware that recent drops in the unemployment rate are mostly due to prime age workers dropping out of the labor force because their job searches are so hopeless.  Labor force participation has been dropping off of a cliff throughout the entirety of Obama's presidency.

I didn't argue that in my own post (and honestly have no idea where the original poster gets his claim from), I was hoping to point out that the relationship between minimum wage and employment isn't entirely clear cut or broadly agreed upon, and overall wouldn't have a drastic effect to a certain limit.

The one actual economic study from Texas A&M that you linked to concluded that   And also goes on later in the paper to say that while growth is negatively affected (and even then not drastically), there is little to no effect on the employment level itself.   While I'm assuming NPR would be disregarded as well for a left-wing bias, there's also the Department of Labor report itself again saying there are little effects on actual levels, but simply the rate of growth itself, and the fact there are many prominent economists still debating the net effects of minimum wage itself shows the topic isn't so easily cut and dry, even among people who specialize in the field and study it in-depth for a living."

I think we also agree that the relationship is complex and not amenable to easy study.  The basic supply & demand analysis assumes that minimum wage hikes will cause unemployment if every other variable is held constant.  In reality every other variable is also changing.  Personally I've never heard a convincing reason to doubt that raising the minimum wage will lead to fewer jobs than would be available otherwise.  Employers only have so much that they can spend on labor costs and remain profitable.  If you arbitrarily raise their labor costs they will either cut back on labor hours, look to substitute capital goods for labor (i.e. automation), outsource their labor, or expand their business more slowly than they would have otherwise.  The NPR article basically parroted the Center for Economic and Policy Research and Obama's Department of Labor statements about the spurious correlation between job growth and minimum wage hikes.  I think it's fair to state that the Department of Labor under this President hasn't exactly been the most dispassionate and unbiased Labor Department in American history.  The previous labor secretary resigned in disgrace because she was openly doing political campaigning while serving in her post, and the new guy isn't any less of an ideologue."

Furthermore, empirical data does not support Keynes theories regarding the ""marginal propensity to consume"".  Keynesian demand management policies fail because of this and Friedman's Permanent Income Hypothesis has been found to be far more accurate.  Also, obviously the types of supply and demand curves learned in introductory economics courses are rudimentary and based on ""ceteris paribus"" (I've already mentioned this), but you would have to be a fool to claim that supply & demand isn't applicable in the real world.

A lot of people working for these wages don't even feel they can afford to take a sick day; how do you think you're gonna feel about spending a week (or two... or more) looking for a new job?   No corporation is risking a major lawsuit over that.   You know that Wal-Mart has been sued by the EEOC for retaliation, right? Like, just a couple years ago, that time, and it's not the only time. They risk 'major lawsuits like that' all the time.  And they're hardly alone; companies not only risk it, but on the occasions when they do get sued, they settle it for some comparatively piddly sum which is nowhere near enough to discourage them from doing it again to others."

He was fired soon after Yishan left as they declared his position redundant, because a Reddit-based cryptocurrency is a stupid idea on every level.  He later came up with a breathtakingly inane Medium post, which has been repeated uncritically by a pile of news outlets and commentators (including this WiReD article), in which he posits a Bitcoin-based decentralised Reddit where popular posts get paid in penny-shavings. I CAN'T SEE THAT GOING SPAMMY NO SIR  Yishan later posted what Ryan was supposed to be working on: an equally ill-defined (but not as gibberingly stupid in concept) decentralised Reddit working something like Usenet used to (and which he explicitly compared to Usenet). i.e., not reimplementing bitcoind in Javascript.

Well, I'm not one of these coward ethnonationalists who say, ""Oh, just give everyone a nation, goiz.""  I don't hide that I think Indo-Europeans are the greatest race that has ever existed; I think Semites and Asians are of inferior aristocratic character.  That doesn't mean Europe-only—Persians and North Indians (upper caste Hindus) are also of extremely admirable psychology. They are our true allies, not Saudi Arabs. Iranians are our actual cousins and brothers ('Iran' itself means Aryan), not Semitic Jews and Arabs.  Now, does this mean I promote active extermination? I think there are far too many problems to solve ahead of that. And even were that not the case, I think subordination in a greater hierarchy would be preferable to outright removal of unique genetics (we don't know what genomes may prove eventually useful).   Do you honestly see no problem with murdering indigenous peoples simply to acquire the land, and then impose 'law' over the land?   I like what the Brits did to Africa, India, and Hong Kong.  Would that I were a Germanic officer in their corps. I would enjoy bringing their ennobled civilization.   That was disgusting. Let's see what we find next:   When one knows that a pure blooded African has the raw IQ score of an 11 year old Norther European—and is just as impulsive as an eleven year old child—it starts to make much more sense why there should be some kind of paternal legal hierarchy of their rights.

EnoughLibertarianSpam,3cvsw4,kapuchinski,-14,Sat Jul 11 16:55:04 2015 UTC,Dispassionate yet supremely logical? I'll take it.

EnoughLibertarianSpam,3cvsw4,kapuchinski,-7,Sat Jul 11 18:44:01 2015 UTC,Many libertarians are deviants and drug users. There is more argumentation about libertarianism internally than in other political worldviews. Conservatives tend to agree with each other and progressives have complete consensus over the most ridiculous things.
EnoughLibertarianSpam,3cvsw4,AnAntichrist,12,Sat Jul 11 19:07:11 2015 UTC,Put a socialist a communist and an anarchist in a room for an hour and you'll have 4 different factions by the end of the day. Nobody beats us lefties for internal bickering.
EnoughLibertarianSpam,3cvsw4,kapuchinski,-9,Sat Jul 11 19:20:19 2015 UTC,"They will trade fantasies about how to control the perfect society, but they all voted for Obama. All lefties pretty much believe in everything Katie Couric believes: Gun control, systemic racism and sexism everywhere, abortion on demand, rocking the vote, religion is the enemy. Sorry, you are only cookie-cutter snowflakes with different icing."
EnoughLibertarianSpam,3cvsw4,AnAntichrist,8,Sat Jul 11 20:02:32 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but it seems like you don't know anything about left political thought. Maybe you should read about different types of left thought. There's huge differences. An individualist anarchist and I disagree on major things. Although neither of us would oorbvaly agree with Katie couric or vote for Obama. Read the Wikipedia page on communism socialism and anarchism. It'll help.
EnoughLibertarianSpam,3cvsw4,kapuchinski,-2,Sat Jul 11 20:43:30 2015 UTC,"I take it back, you are an unique snowflake. People who refer to themselves as lefties typically agree with Katie Couric about gun control, systemic racism and sexism everywhere, abortion on demand, rocking the vote, and that religion is the enemy. If you don't and didn't vote for Obama, you're not the type I'm on this sub to debate with. It may be hard for you to believe but 99% of ""lefties"" of any stripe who voted voted for Obama."
EnoughLibertarianSpam,3cvsw4,AnAntichrist,6,Sat Jul 11 20:49:11 2015 UTC,"Please for your own sake actually read material on leftist ideology. You have no idea what you're talking about. Why would a communist agree with Katie couric? Do you think you'd open Kapital and find the phrase ""basically Katie couric""? Fuck no. No leftists would vote for a a capitalist like Obama."

I have seen claims on 4chan that as many as 60% of rape claims are false and are made due to malevolent intent, among other things.  Snapshots:   This post Link   I am a bot. (Info | Contact)"
