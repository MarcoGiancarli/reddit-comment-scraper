There's also the requirement of needing Empire Control at level V in order to create an alliance which would take 60 days to do from a brand new character.  Arumba's characters don't have Empire Control V yet, and he's made a few comments that he doesn't want to just make an alliance overnight because he probably doesn't feel comfortable managing something that large yet."

Most people won't bother with them save for certain groups like PIRAT, Marmite, etc. The majority of PVP in EVE is in Lowsec and Nullsec because the mechanics associated with them are far more simple to understand and sort out.  Arumba, or the group joining him, would have to pay in-game ISK to go PVP alongside him and for the most part people just don't care that much about Highsec Warfare compared to Lowsec and Nullsec."

In Eve you never actually die.  You can't.  It's not like Call of Duty where you win by killing X number of people per match.  So you have to have a new metric to judge success by.  That metric is cost per kill.  They managed to cost the enemy corp roughly 650,000,000 isk.  While at the same time losing far, far less than that.  Also while the enemy corp is fighting they aren't making money.  So longer terms costs are higher for them.  Same for Arumba's corp as well, but still."
arumba07,3dva84,Alidooo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:27:03 2015 UTC,The enemy corp I am guessing went into the war expecting it to be over in a week when they get paid off to stop blowing up newbies. I seriously doubt they were expecting this much resistance is any.  Currently though zKillBoard evaluates [ARUMB] in a 10 billion isk loss. But most of that looks to be newbie ships which for some reason seem to cost around 500k and pods which are worth a base of 10k and whatever implants were lost.I would definitely say [ARUMB] is winning right now.

I just do what the emperor wants, and prepare to destroy him whenever a revolt is big enough against him.   My warning is that it's a bit of a waiting game. The Ummayads for some reason have been able to stay pretty strong in my game, with Asturias being absolutely murdered by me and Charlemagne dying too early to build his empire. So I'm essentially just biding time over the years while I wait for a major revolt to crush the Ummayads.  My eventual goal is to lead a Basque-led Hispania.

I would personally support closing comments on YouTube and instead having people talk about Arumba's videos here on Reddit (everybody knows that YouTube's comments are often the cesspool of the Internet, so it wouldn't be a bad decision anyway).  And Arumba, if you want to play the crap out of EVE, feel free to do so. A YouTube channel (and its content) is a bit like a train, and you're the conductor. There may be people who get on and off the train at various points, but you get to decide where that train is going and what it's doing. We're just here for the ride.  And besides, we watched you play Microsoft Excel. It's safe to say that you can play whatever you want and we'll be there enjoying it."

I do not participate in the cesspool of twitch chat and I only comment on multiplayer common sense and factorio.   It's too easy to pin the blame solely on anonymity. It's hilarious that people are suggesting reddit as an alternative when it's so much more anonymous than Youtube comments which require linking with a G+ account. The only reason for reddit is that you can actively censor dissenting or negative opinions through downvotes and moderation.   I think that a lot of people became familiar with (and enjoy) Arumba's channel because he was GOOD at what he does. A min maxy type player who understands games through and through. I feel like that's the appeal of this channel relative to others. No offense to arumba, but he hasn't exactly got a lot of charisma or a traditional sense of humor. You watch someone like NL for the ridiculous banter, then you watch someone like Arumba when you want to see things get done, which would make it all the more disappointing when mistakes are made that a viewer THINKS wouldn't they have made. You get pulled out of your immersion and are suddenly just sitting on your ass watching a dude play a game worse than you probably would, and whats the appeal of that?   That, along with the general maturity and fickleness of the internet audience in general, would result in some negative comments. Nothing to do about it other than keep doing what you're doing and learning and improving, not letting negativity get to you and taking the feedback into account, although with a grain of salt (yes, even with eve. if you want to make objectively bad decisions because you want to play the game how you want to play and bumble about learning through trial and error, then don't be surprised when the minmax-y audience you yourself have cultured gets upset)"
arumba07,3dhcbb,can_into_space,5,Thu Jul 16 15:52:18 2015 UTC,"The only reason for reddit is that you can actively censor dissenting or negative opinions through downvotes and moderation.   ""There's no reason to switch to Reddit, except for these reasons."" Seriously, you have no idea how effective they are. Moderators on Reddit can give out warnings and even bans, and the trolls are never as prominent as they are on YouTube. The users actually can learn not to post completely brain-dead comments.  The ACTUAL worry for a YT-to-Reddit switch is that the YouTube culture would overwhelm this sub's culture, and it will expand too quickly for mods to keep up. Personally, I think the ways to solve the problem would be stringent moderation and maybe somehow disabling the downvote button for new users (in an /r/polandball-esque fasion, but I'd like to see how other subscribers would want to handle the issue too."
arumba07,3dhcbb,AticusCaticus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:39:37 2015 UTC,The actual issue with that transition is that youtube comments actually influence search rankings and visibility way more than votes
arumba07,3dhcbb,happy_dayze,0,Fri Jul 17 01:01:17 2015 UTC,"Except that there is often a need for a negative or dissenting opinion. For example, look at Arumba's recent attempt at a renewed hearthstone series. If the only comments visible were circlejerky sucking-arumba's-dick kind, he'd still be doing them that way to the detriment of his own channel. Youtube's comment system isn't perfect, but it's there. Every viewer has the ability and convenience to say whatever they want, and if they don't want to then click a button next to an existing comment that mirrors their sentiment. And if they disagree with it, the other button! And it's already there! Right under the relevant video! So convenient!   If you don't want the negatives and only want the ""omg you're so great just keep being you :)"" then... well, keep coming to the reddit, I guess. But if a negative sentiment is regularly among the highest voted comments, then there might be a problem.  Look at TB, 2 million subs and he actively reinforces using reddit as a comment system, and the most controversial discussion focused videos will still only maybe get a hundred comments. The normal usual vids, maybe 10. There's nothing wrong with having reddit threads in parallel like what is currently happening, but TO IGNORE FEEDBACK is foolhardy."
arumba07,3dhcbb,can_into_space,3,Thu Jul 16 18:54:22 2015 UTC,"I never said that negative or dissenting opinions are bad. In fact, what you stated is yet another positive for Reddit - the anti-Hearthstone comments would be upvoted. Reddit is a display of popular opinions.   Every viewer has the ability and convenience to say whatever they want, and if they don't want to then click a button next to an existing comment that mirrors their sentiment. And if they disagree with it, the other button! And it's already there! Right under the relevant video! So convenient!   This is looking more and more like a parody account."

There are no classes to choose, so no worries there. Any character chan learn any skill and fly any ship (skill requirements apply).   The only significant difference the race makes is the distance you will be starting to Arumba's corp's HQ. Amarr will be the closest, but if their background does not fit you (it's purely roleplay related, any character and race can learn any skill), you can choose any race you like.  If you chose a race other than Amarr, I recommend doing the tutorial/career agent missions in your starting location before heading ou towards Amarr space (that's where Arumba's corp is based)."

One thing Arumba videos do well is that he explains his reasoning on why he's doing something.  Most often the case, what he's doing is min/maxing whatever system.  In Eve that's valuable because time is literally money.  I'm willing to bet something like that would help out his corp as well.

If he had them use antimatter those ships would end up within smartbomb range and his fleet would be decimated once again.

A permaban might be a bit harsh but picking at someone's nerves and ruining his enjoyment of the games is just acting like children. It's one thing to spam salt in the chat when Reynad gets rekt by Ragnaros RNG because it's just a game and he understands that watching him be salty and trolling him is part of the whole experience of watching his channel. He might be frustrated but he isn't genuinely angry outside of the context of the game. Arumba just wanted to stream some impromptu Eve and show off what he's been working on to the people in his corporation who are all playing together and having a good time with it without taking the whole thing too seriously. He wanted to have fun trying to use the game mechanics and come up with his own strategy without everyone yelling at him like he has no idea what he's doing and trying to make him play the same way everyone else does. You're just making his job harder, because making videos is his job and he knows that when he doesn't enjoy himself because of asshole commenters it comes across in the videos and that must be stressful. If you've ever worked hard and had fun making something you were really proud of just for everyone to tell you its shit and to stop trying you know it doesn't feel good. Constructive criticism is a lot different from just being abrasive and shouting at him to do things the way you want him to.  tl;dr you deserved it and his twitch chat would more more bearable without being filled with backseat gamers yelling at him and pushing his buttons."

arumba07,3dhwif,bool_idiot_is_true,-4,Thu Jul 16 16:28:28 2015 UTC,I wish we had 700 more like you last night.
arumba07,3dhwif,justdrop,8,Thu Jul 16 16:32:25 2015 UTC,"You were not banned for attempting to give advice; you were banned for spamming salt and, in general, being complete assholes to the streamer you were ""attempting"" to help. See: rules 2 and 3 of the chat.  Furthermore, rule 4 even after I kindly attempted to discuss said rulings with people was excercised after they continued to not understand he doesn't want you to help.  If you cannot follow the rules that the streamer sets forth, you do not deserve the privilege (and please note that word is not right) to use his chat to discuss your vitriol with other players, you being used in a general term. Have a good day."
arumba07,3dhwif,justdrop,-3,Thu Jul 16 15:26:04 2015 UTC,I like you more and more everyday lol
arumba07,3dhwif,tyler45455,0,Thu Jul 16 17:21:42 2015 UTC,Down votes just reinforce my stance.
arumba07,3dhwif,justdrop,2,Thu Jul 16 17:35:18 2015 UTC,"Neutral on this completely...but another dynamic of this is got to be stated. Look at the EVE forums....just for a little bit. Search around. This is a community that is not nice. Its very cynical...its very dog eat dog. The development of the game and its issues have spawned that over the years...making people more and more bitter and sometimes vile. I think whats happening is that the EVE community (which are made up of alot of hardasses, sadly) is meshing with the much more friendly and cooperative Arumba community. As an eve vet-ish...I can tell you when it comes to eve, this is unavoidable. If arumba really wants to make EVE part of his youtube life...he needs to accept this. And all the war dec's, cus those will never stop. Vocal people are large moving targets in this game and community. Sadly it shoots them down pretty fast. If you make  decions that are not part of the accepted modes of thought in EVE (what ever that means...still trying to find out myself)...they will bite you hard for it. Put that next to the general internet douche-ness...you get what you have here."
arumba07,3dhwif,Vodac120,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:03:45 2015 UTC,"iv got to say. I usualy dont even participate in the stream. Today i made 5 comments in it (2 to arumba and one he answered and everything and the rest to other people).  Im going to quote myself ""@arumba07 still playing with only one account? thats not the way of the true eve player.""  i made this question like 3 times (with time appart ofc) and i got PERMA BANNED.   sad stuff"
arumba07,3dhwif,ACreatorPT,-4,Mon Jul 20 19:28:04 2015 UTC,"Never give eve noobs advice, they don't understand that the meta is the meta for a reason."
arumba07,3dhwif,Willie_f,-5,Thu Jul 16 18:00:48 2015 UTC,"yeah, if there is any game which is bad to break the meta, this would be on a top ten list"
arumba07,3dgcxy,cbeaus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:34:37 2015 UTC,"Seconded! I have suggested this to Arumba on here and in the comments on youtube a few times, I do think he would like it.   It's essentially Dwarf Fortress with a more pleasing UI, and a few other differences. Would be a refreshing change of pace for Arumba and the viewers i think, even just to try out for a few episodes.   Also, after a while of figuring things out, its very min-max-able. Customizing professions, placing workshops just so, mine planning, all for maximum efficiency. I think Arumba would take to it well."
arumba07,3df7yw,tyler45455,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:18:13 2015 UTC,Anyone know if skills progress while the server is down?
arumba07,3df7yw,Redaisenjack,2,Wed Jul 15 21:56:00 2015 UTC,Skills do progress while server is in downtime:)

arumba07,3df7yw,Redaisenjack,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:40:30 2015 UTC,Seems like the servers went online again at 00.40
arumba07,3df7yw,Don_Camillo005,0,Wed Jul 15 22:44:08 2015 UTC,check the eve sub
arumba07,3df7yw,sheogorin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:17:36 2015 UTC,To see the same info as here? http://eve-offline.net/

arumba07,3dh0nl,gormiti100,2,Thu Jul 16 05:09:42 2015 UTC,Context?
arumba07,3dh0nl,timpi3000,3,Thu Jul 16 07:00:29 2015 UTC,"Skip to 1:31:00 http://www.twitch.tv/arumba07/v/7732402  Basically, what happened was Arumba got pissed off and then people starting posting the Salt Can emote (PJSalt) into chat, then everyone got permanently banned without warning or ban appeal from his chat. Some notable people were banned in that wave, then people began lashing at the mods"
arumba07,3dh0nl,YunataSavior,3,Thu Jul 16 08:21:54 2015 UTC,Seems like the Youtube self-help group will get a new member soon.
arumba07,3dh0nl,timpi3000,2,Thu Jul 16 10:23:55 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure he was drunk.  Honestly, I think eve is a very toxic online community.  Arumba is a very open and intentional guy, this type of personality doesn't translate well into toxic communities where having a hard and closed shell is beneficial."
arumba07,3dh0nl,BustyPoser,2,Fri Jul 17 16:30:07 2015 UTC,He doesn't drink.
arumba07,3de8r6,EvaKobayashi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:14:30 2015 UTC,what happend?
arumba07,3de8r6,Don_Camillo005,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:49:51 2015 UTC,"Nothing, but they are pissed because the corp destroyed a Legion I think and the whole home system is blockaded and gate camped so everyone who didn't spawn in the recommended area is cut off from HQ. I know there are at least a few people in the chat who are in the same area."
arumba07,3de8r6,Don_Camillo005,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:12:16 2015 UTC,time for some alternate bases then

arumba07,3dg58c,Inoka1,6,Thu Jul 16 00:29:48 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with the addiction thing. Obviously we can't really speculate about Arumba's case, I only hope he takes the time to keep himself happy and healthy mentally.  But what is obvious is that he's becoming frustrated, and like you said so well, it's disheartening.   Regarding general content however, I think a lot of his current mood is to do with, as he said himself, his lack of interest in games in general at the moment. I also feel like he's being driven to Eve, because his usual channel and content are being inundated with negativity. Enough for him to seem genuinely upset in his agenda.   I hope he reads the comments on his Agenda video and here, because there are some good solutions.   And I hope he just throws convention to the wind and tries things out. Heck, if he changes things up, it might weed out some of the people who are being negative in the first place.   One solution I saw in the comments is to do a new-to-him game each week. Totally clueless, give it a shot for a week, and move on if he doesn't like it.    But I think no matter what changes he makes, variety is key. For both his channel and his mental health. The same old routine isn't cutting it right now.   I'd love if he perhaps got back to what got him into video games first. Rekindle the flame, sort of.   I commented and suggested a list of games that, even if he doesn't want to play, might inspire him to think outside the box about what he plays and uploads.   I'd be curious as to what people here on the subreddit think he should try out (not just games you personally like, but what Arumba should play). Here was my list   Total War games, Mount and Blade, Rollercoaster Tycoon (not sure why but i can picture Arumba playing and enjoying this), Prison Architect, Magicka, Monaco, Sleeping Dogs, Gnomoria, Tropico"
arumba07,3dg58c,hyperlexia,3,Thu Jul 16 01:47:16 2015 UTC,"I agree entirely with this solution. Maybe even part of the reason he likes Eve so much is because it's something entirely new to him, and it's also his style. If he can find something like that, that translates to video better, it would be ideal.  Also, everyone likes RTC. It's a universal constant."
