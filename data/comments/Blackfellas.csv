Blackfellas,3e4zkl,Intrinsic_Factors,2,Wed Jul 22 00:19:29 2015 UTC,"I really wouldn't know how to respond to this if I was a Black man. I wouldn't become defensive about it, but I would probably feel pretty crappy about this even if I did none of those things. However I agree with what's stated.  How can this be stated in a way to help someone to change  without it coming off as pandering?"
Blackfellas,3e4zkl,lovelyone20,4,Wed Jul 22 00:34:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know nor am I sure that it should be changed. I don't see anything to get defensive about. It would be one thing if the statements were factually incorrect or something but I don't see any problem with listening when people are telling you about their experiences and ways you can help them.   In cases where guys tell me that conversations like this one offend them (or white people in conversations about race, cis- and straight people in conversations about the LGBTQ community, etc.) it normally seems to come down to 2 things:  1) Thinking that the conversation about ways black males can help black females paints them a bad person. If they're already doing all 10 things on this list (or more), good for them. I'd see this list as both a way of reinforcing that they are engaged with helping their female counterparts and a reminder to keep doing them. If they're not, they've learned (or been reminded of) something they can do to help. Nothing in this piece passed a moral judgment. If any such judgement was made, they did it to themselves.  A conversation about ways people can be better doesn't mean that those people are bad.  2) They can't find a reason to be doing the things on the list. That strikes me either as general ignorance (not uncommon) or a lack of character (or apathy, which can be just as bad). The former is correctable with information and after that correction is made, something like this can help them. The latter issue not so easily corrected and this piece wouldn't reach them anyway. If someone can't see a reason not to slut shame women, not to persist with colorism,  not to standby while someone else is being attacked, etc. (or see the reason and can't be bothered to do something about it or otherwise refuse to change), there's nothing to be defensive about it. No one can force them to. Society will move right along around them.   EDIT: For a response that starts with ""I don't know"" and didn't really answer your question, that was a lot. My apologies. I guess the best I can offer is figure out why this man felt crappy about it and work from there"

Blackfellas,3e2vn7,lardlad95,11,Tue Jul 21 16:51:27 2015 UTC,SOooooo many people do this though.  So many BM and BW use their white partner as a reason to go off on our own.    I often wonder how the white person in their lives feels about this.  Are they smug?  Do they feel like a trophy and less of a person?
Blackfellas,3e2vn7,Lost_Afropick,8,Tue Jul 21 17:20:44 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason I don't date white women is the whole trophy thing. I've had one too many white girls give me the ""I'm gonna use you to show how progressive I am/piss of my dad/fulfill my fetish"" vibe so I just nipped the entire problem in the bud.  I do think some people don't mind playing that role. I'm sure you've met a black person with ""Only Negro in the Room Syndrome"" where they get visibly agitated whenever another black person shows up. On the flip side I've encountered numerous white people who enjoy being the only white person around black people.  Trying to wrap my head around that type of personality can get a bit exhausting though."

For a night fine lol, but nobody wants to be with somebody who sees you like that.  The other thing that follows yours is where you act as some kind of license for them to step over the line by the sheer fact for your existence.  I've seen white people who've dated friends of mine act like they can behave a certain way now, there's tangible 'proof' they aren't racist if you see what I mean.

Our forebears did not fight for the right to fuck white girls.  That wasn't the end goal.  If some people want to do that, more power to em.  Off you go.  Only idiots want to dictate what happens in somebody elses bedroom... but that wasn't the goal of the civil rights movement or the anti apartheid struggle or similar histories.   You've the motivation all wrong.  Personally I haven't dated interracially and probably wouldn't.  I'm primarily attracted to and feel comfortable around black women.  Not to say I don't find other women attractive or whatever but I see first and like most black women.  Their look obviously but also the similar cultural background and shared experiences... I ain't gotta explain shit or justify shit I can just... be.

It's mind boggling IRR is seen as 'progress', not ending police brutality or mass incarceration of black people or domestic violence against BW. Equally annoying is the victim complex by some minorities in IRR, as if black people were ever opposed to IRR and were the ones lynching or calling people in it racial slurs."

Gonna be honest, I'm getting tired of people saying, ""black people hate this"" when black people historically have been VERY accommodating toward IRR..we never hung anyone for being with a white person like white people did.  Anyway, I just think most black people are pro-black relationships. Also it doesn't help that there are a lot of vocal people in IRR that idealize white supremacy by favoring mixed-looking children over darker ones. Also for black men sometimes it seems like they will get with or marry white women as a sign of financial and social success. But I do believe there are black people in IRR who don't do this.  That being said there are a lot of black people who exclusively like light-skinned black folk and shit on dark people but will convince you they are pro-black and it's ""just a preference"". Lol"

Blackfellas,3e2vn7,blacklonewolf,7,Tue Jul 21 17:31:58 2015 UTC,"The problem is that certain people pursue interracial relationships as a way of validating themselves, because they see partners that are not of their own race as ""better"".  It's a very problematic viewpoint as you imagine because it does nothing to help the overall black image, and also those who do it as you imagine have horrid self esteem issues that they perpetuate onto the black community at large. For instance, we end up with young black boys using the #Whitegirlsdoitbetter tag.  I personally don't take race as a determining factor in who I choose to date and judging others. Yes, by nature I'm more drawn high yellow people like myself. But, currently I'm dating a jewish guy, this is my first time ever in my life dating a white person. But, he has a strong connection to his culture and appreciates my own culture and gives it the respect that it deserves without appropriating it. Elements I believe are necessary for an interracial relationship.  That's why I believe just having a culture is more important than the race someone's from, their culture will not determine their personality, but if you can demonstrate a strong sense of respect and connection to your culture it may be possible you would be able to do the same for mine. But, I can certainly see why some black people would be vehement against it, but you have to see where they're coming from."

It's strange that this guy is specifically looking for white or Asian women and has completely ruled out dating black women.  When it becomes about race like that, it's kind of fetishising whiteness, just like how a white woman that only dates black men is fetishising blackness."
Blackfellas,3e2vn7,11218,14,Wed Jul 22 00:01:10 2015 UTC,"I think you have it backwards, black people didn't fight for/against inter-racial relationships, they were fighting against racism, that is, for Civil Rights. Prior to Loving v Virginia, those anti-miscegenation laws didn't exist to punish white men for raping black women (or keeping them as mistresses), they meant a black man could be lynched for false rape accusations, for as much as looking at a white woman. There's a difference between ending racist anti-miscegenation laws applied unequally and ""hey, we want to marry white people."" A benefit of that was to allow loving inter-racial relationships to just happen naturally not structurally (I'll get to that).  So, contemporary black people aren't against IRR (you don't see much criticism surrounding inter-Asian, inter-any other group) as much they are pro-black relationships and/or not for inter-white relationships. And rightfully so, because of the cultural baggage (history of white supremacy and modern-day racism), as well media standards that promote Bx/Wx, Ax/Wx etc as the 'ideal' inter-racial relationship for all the other groups. You see it in statements like 'mixed' babies are cuter, marrying 'up', the 'white' environments (structures) where IRR often happen which implicitly or structurally project white supremacy. There is also this subconscious post-racial narrative that the 'browning' of the world will end racism, when nothing could be further from the truth... Apart from such dreams not being feasible, 'race' isn't called a social construct for nothing.  Edited for completeness:   it seems black women seem to be more vocal against it while black men also shame black women who are in inter-racial relationships.   Black women are affected by the racism/gender dynamics in IRR (just like in life) more than black men, and I wouldn't say they are the most vocal, they just have a proportional response to it. 'Shaming' is too often a code word for the victim narrative some BM and BW in interracial relationships invent to downplay and live with white societal racism. Are we supposed to believe the so-called black disapproval of IRR is worse than the way whites have treated and continue to treat such relationships? (Black approval rates of IRR have always been historically higher than those of whites, and they still have decades of catching up to do).  If you find those kind of personal attacks occurring (because I know they do), please call them out and you'll find many black people will back you up, just as long as it doesn't mean silencing black women or men complaining about racism against them."
Blackfellas,3e2vn7,GeneralBuhari,5,Tue Jul 21 15:39:33 2015 UTC,"I was with you until you said that not being for inter-white relationships is understandable and acceptable. There is a difference between acknowledging history and the cultural effects of such on society and downright ignoring key concepts of humanity like love and sexual attraction. We are too far along in our cultural development to take such a rudimentary and downright ignorant step backwards.   I seriously dislike this idea that all white-black mixed race relationships are steeped in some sort of underlying social/racial power play, which you seem to hold more important than the fundamental right to be with who we wish."
Blackfellas,3e2vn7,TheKickboxingGuy,6,Tue Jul 21 16:24:26 2015 UTC,"Is this the 'not all white people are racist' version for relationships? Inter-white relationships do indeed fall under more scrutiny than other IRRs, sometimes unfairly, but not as unfair as their effects on people of colour (especially black WOC and Asian males, don't they have such 'fundamental rights' to be free of societal constraints?). This was why I tried to separate natural relationships vs those shaped by societal structures (and the kind of overt racism in the linked video), but there's only so much one can type here."
Blackfellas,3e2vn7,GeneralBuhari,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:34:44 2015 UTC,"I can agree with that, somewhat. It looks like you made a few edits in your first post to clarify certain points about structure.   However, I think in general the whole idea of a social caste system forming the backbone of the majority, or many, black/white relationships though, is still somewhat overplayed due to skewed media perceptions, journals, articles, etc. The majority of people in any IRR will not do so for ""structural purposes,"" but more for the naturally occurring reasons you have already mentioned. There might be structural by-products...but these are still secondary in nature to emotional response.   But because racial structure is a sensitive issue cases that illustrate this are put under the spotlight, and as the news has proven a million times over- drama, especially manufactured drama, sells.   In essence: I think the whole idea of black/white IRR's having a cataclysmic negative effective on woc is bunk and those negative aspects that do exist are simply the inevitabilities of an American culture that is gradually moving towards increased racial awareness. The rejection of black/white IRR's, by any race, is still nothing more than an ignorant hindrance on the path to progress and empathy. It is neither understandable nor acceptable."
Blackfellas,3e2vn7,TheKickboxingGuy,3,Tue Jul 21 17:00:32 2015 UTC,I don't reject IRR but at the same time don't see it as 'progress'. I think it's really secondary to black issues and progress.
Blackfellas,3e2vn7,GeneralBuhari,-4,Tue Jul 21 18:03:40 2015 UTC,"It's absolutely progress, and it is absolutely a black issue. Diminishing racism takes place, first and foremost at the level of the individual, not some hypothetical ""majority"" that can be swayed with tweets and hashtags and facebook updates.   It's the same principles as in business. The goal is never to attract a million people to buy your product, it's to attract one person, a million times. And simply put, romantic relationships are by far, the best way to eradicate systemic perceptions and cultural stereotypes. Nothing else comes remotely close to the effect an individual has on another individual."

And simply put, romantic relationships are by far, the best way to eradicate systemic perceptions and cultural stereotypes.   OMG this is a scary thought, and it's not true at all.   I know of plenty BM who are IRR who demean Black women constantly like they're breathing air. And I know of some BW who put white/non-Black men on a pedestal.   This is usually the case more than not, I don't understand why you would think this would be a solution. Have you ever heard of place South Africa or Brazil?"
Blackfellas,3e2vn7,lovelyone20,-2,Tue Jul 21 23:39:15 2015 UTC,"This is usually the case more than not, I don't understand why you would think this would be a solution   How is it possible to have a reasonable discussion when you say something as ridiculous as this? Do you know how many IRR there are? Are you personally privy to those relationships? Of course not. You are making an emotional judgement based on your immediate surroundings, when the world is far bigger than you and what you read online or see on television.   I'll give you three examples of what I mean. My mother is black, my father is native american indian. When my father and mother decided to get married, our family was essentially excommunicated by certain members of our tribe, including my dad's parents and family. Over time though, when we were born and my grandparents wanted an active role in our lives, we started gradually becoming more involved in their daily life, to the point where my mother was eventually accepted. This in itself isn't that amazing, except that now two of the younger cousins in our family both have black so's, which absolutely would never have been allowed before.   A second example: A very nerdy white friend of mine in high-school had a crush on a artsy black girl, but was quite actively discouraged by his parents because of race. I and my best friend, who was also black, became closer to him and his mother despite the racism, and over time she began to see us more like family than stereotypes. I don't think it's a coincidence that before high school was over, this 50 year old southern white woman gave her son the okay to pursue who he liked.   Finally, I have traveled and worked extensively in China, Africa, and Australia, where racism is far, far more prevalent than in the United States. Nothing is more likely to get someone to change their mind about a group of people than a loving relationship. I have heard everything from: ""I didn't think black people were like this,"" to ""You are very well spoken for a black person."" I take it in stride. If you care about someone and come to understand them, your opinions start to change. Last year a traditional Chinese mother told me she wanted to marry her daughter, when the year before she was (as was described to me) nervous and intimidated by me.   When you say that IRR are all about defamation, you are thinking on an extremely small scale through an extremely limited mindframe. I will maintain that there is nothing more critical to altering perceptions on race and social class than love, and because of what I've seen and experienced around the world for many years you would have to say something extremely damning for me to think otherwise.   Hope that explanation was sufficient."
Blackfellas,3e2vn7,TheKickboxingGuy,6,Wed Jul 22 00:11:06 2015 UTC,"""You are very well spoken for a black person."" I take it in stride.   Why would you take that in stride? That's an insult to Black people. And of-course you're taking this personally since you're a product of IRR.   Well let me clarify what I was saying, I believed we were speaking about IRR with whites? So my comment was only referring to them. And I do believe especially within the Black race. That men who intentionally go out their way to seek white women have underlying issues.    social class than love   No pun intended but what's love got to do with it?  Before dating is even spoken about, certain Black Men/Women rule out their own race in favor of a Non-Black. If these people say they are in love. Then I want nothing to do with that."

Blackfellas,3e2vn7,GeneralBuhari,3,Wed Jul 22 00:41:58 2015 UTC,"Can you name the specific places in ""China"" ""Africa"" and Australia you visited where racism was ""far far"" more prevalent? You're really playing up this hostile world narrative.  I find this to be a strange claim because these places are by and large much more homogenous in their population than America. So encountering any type of race discussion just seems like it would be a strange occurrence.  What was your business in these places? Business? Vacation?"

This idea that all black people should vote Republican to force the party to acknowledge us fails though.  Besides the logistics of getting 40 million people to vote for one party, it would allow for 4 years of policy changes that most minorities don't think would benefit them (otherwise they'd be voting Republican anyway). It might be more effective to just tell AAs to just not vote. There's no guarantee that the Democratic party would change in response.  And it ignores the actions that are already creating change. The protests at the Netroots Nation keynote have already forced the liberal candidates to change the conversation. The question is if we can maintain that focus on our issues. Stephen A could be working on ensuring that happens  Still, I'm more concerned with Stephen A. Smith's statements about All Lives Matter. He clearly doesn't understand the issue or the movement"

This country felt a little different under Dubya's 8 years compared to Obama's, but there were way too many similarities for my taste. It just showed me how close on the political spectrum our Republicans and Democrats are. I want something different and Sanders gives me the best chance to experience that.

He's just the best candidate out there that's even within consideration. Can he beat Hillary? Who knows. I guess we'll see. We know Hillary has the backing of Wall Street and the big banks. Can he beat whoever the Republicans throw out there in the final election? Probably.  Maybe I'm overly optimistic thinking the Republicans are the long shot for the presidency, but I don't think so.  I think the best way to judge him is by his extensive track record. This is usually the criteria I use for any politician."
Blackfellas,3duttk,Jesus_Harold_Christ,5,Sun Jul 19 21:23:39 2015 UTC,"Vermont's 95% white. He doesn't really care about minority issues, but he cares about economic ones. He's a 1930's progressive, concerned with busting banks and corporations and strengthening unions. He's not a 1960's progressive concerned with deeper cultural issues that many minorities relate to or have to face on a daily basis. Yes, he was for civil rights for all Americans, but what's at stake today isn't the legal stuff on paper, but the day to day experiences of minorities rife with prejudice, stereotypes, subtle discrimination, etc."
Blackfellas,3duttk,structuralbiology,2,Sun Jul 19 23:23:48 2015 UTC,"You make a good point. His civil rights for all Americans though led to him being arrested for protesting against segregation. So his civil rights for all Americans did not leave out Black Americans.  That being said I think you are right that he isn't really getting to the meat of the racial issues. He acknowledges that black people are disproportionately affected by many institutions in this country but it still feels like he's not quite connecting all the dots yet...not in his speeches anyway. I'm a huge Bernie supporter but one thing I would love to hear from him is complete acknowledgement of how slavery, jim crow, redlining, unequal provisions from WW11, displacement of black communities, etc. Have historically stacked the deck. But I can see how some people will see that as pandering, and he definitely needs to be sure it is sincere. Bernie is good at talking to people and truly listening to them. So long as he starting talking and listening to some communities of color (which he has already a bit pretty sure) then I think he will continue to evolve. It's not like he has to change any of his platform stances to be more inclusive. Anyway #FeelTheBern"
Blackfellas,3duttk,BoBab,3,Mon Jul 20 16:59:53 2015 UTC,Its weird and reassuring to see this in contrast with the current shit going on with Twitter.  I'd much rather a candidate propose solutions to real issues than pander to us.

He's a major underdog for the Democratic nomination (and probably would still be a significant underdog to win the election if he did) but I think it's too early to rule him out. More realistically, I think he'll move the conversation to the left. At the moment, I'm not satisfied with any candidate on the left (and the right is just a non-starter).  Some of his supporters though... they'd have you thinking he earned the minority vote in 1960 and any vote cast for someone else will bring on the apocalypse."
Blackfellas,3duttk,Intrinsic_Factors,6,Sun Jul 19 19:01:03 2015 UTC,"I think he has the best policies and most genuine character of any potential Democratic nominees, but I have to admit he is still a real long shot against Hillary for the Dem nomination, and part of me worries that he's a bit too academic/intellectual in how he talks about things to continuously generate the soundbytes a lot of voters need to connect with a candidate."

At least Obama did what he said he would, he brought back troops, got universal (ish) healthcare and fixed the economy. Done and done. He is a strong president with good ideas though.   Bernie has some ideas but he hasn't shown he can lead this country or stand tall and put his foot down. Or showed that he is black peoples corner. Obama actually talks about race issues, has Bernie actually said something besides the generic nonsense every other person is saying? Has he said anything about bringing jobs from overseas and cracking down on outsourcing and the environment? Has discussed at length his plan for moving the United States from being dependent on oil from Middle Eastern countries with ties to terrorists? Has he addressed the actual specifics of how police brutality is an issue and how he would focus on law enforcement reform and policies?  Has he addressed the fact that in the past 14 yrs since 9/11 law enforcement has killed at least 7,000 people since then? (And that is the conservative number the number can be as high as 14,000+.). Has he addressed or anyone addressed the fact many black Americans love in poverty and how we will help those and create economic opportunities for those people and in result decrease poverty and crime?    Has he addressed the fact that cities like Detroit and Chicago and Baltimore are experiencing extreme crime waves with over a thousand people shot in Chicago alone so far this year?  No he hasn't?

Blackfellas,3duttk,NSFW895,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:28:57 2015 UTC,"Changed my mind.  First you say:   I need to hear some real solutions to problems not hopes and promises that wont mean shit if he gets nominated.   So I'll just literally copy and paste what I said last time   Since announcing his candidacy he has already introduced  concrete legislation for free college, paid leave, and attacking the youth unemployment rate.  GovTrack.Us shows:  Some of Sanders’s most recently sponsored bills include...  S. 1713: A bill to require the Secretary of Energy to provide loans and grants ...  S. 1677: Responsible Estate Tax Act  S. 1631: Keep Our Pension Promises Act  S. 1564: Guaranteed Paid Vacation Act  S. 1506: Employ Young Americans Now Act  S. 1373: College for All Act   Next you said:   Or showed that he is black peoples corner. Obama actually talks about race issues, has Bernie actually said something besides the generic nonsense every other person is saying?   I'm not going to beat a dead horse. I'm assuming you've heard of his civil rights record. Let's look to something not from the 60's then. Here is Bernie in 1991 (just to prove he isn't some pandering douchebag) being in ""black people's corner"".  More recently? Here's an article he wrote about black youth unemployment  Here's Bernie talking more about how he's against youth getting thrown in jails and he talks about his bill that would employ youth instead of imprison them.  Now I agree that Bernie could be more ""in black people's corner"". But frankly it would come off as pandering. The guy isn't perfect and I would love to see him connect more dots in his speeches between system racism factors. That doesn't mean he's not for black people though, Bernie is for all disadvantaged people, but I agree he should do better about identifying that black people have special obstacles in our way. That's just personal opinion though.  And, Obama talking about race issues, really? Hardly. He only does at ""safe"" times like when a black boy gets gunned down, or a church is shot up, or Selma's 50th Anniversary. Obeezy definitely has tipped toe around talking about race issues...He doesn't want to make it look like he's taking ""sides"". Obama plays the game too much right now. I still respect the guy though  Alright so next you said:   Has he said anything about bringing jobs from overseas and cracking down on outsourcing and the environment?   Really? Bernie is staunchly against the TPP for those very reasons.  Since you mentioned the environment here's Bernie talking about the urgency of Climate Change.  Next you said   Has discussed at length his plan for moving the United States from being dependent on oil from Middle Eastern countries with ties to terrorists?   Bernie talks here about the issue with Big Oil.  Next you said:   Has he addressed the actual specifics of how police brutality is an issue and how he would focus on law enforcement reform and policies?   Here he literally talks about what he would do as president.  He talks a bit more about police militarization and accountability here.  Next you said:   Has he addressed the fact that in the past 14 yrs since 9/11 law enforcement has killed at least 7,000 people since then? (And that is the conservative number the number can be as high as 14,000+.). Has he addressed or anyone addressed the fact many black Americans love in poverty and how we will help those and create economic opportunities for those people and in result decrease poverty and crime?    The above links cover that. He repeatedly talks about the black youth unemployment rate and income inequality. Bernie is suspect of not being specific enough though, I definitely agree with that.  Next you said:   Has he addressed the fact that cities like Detroit and Chicago and Baltimore are experiencing extreme crime waves with over a thousand people shot in Chicago alone so far this year?   What's your source for ""extreme crime waves""? Just curious. Either way, yea shit is bad out there. I think Bernie could talk more about it for sure, but he definitely has not ignored it--once again a lot of the above links have him talking about how fucked up the treatment is of certain communities in this country. Don't act like the dude doesn't give a shit though, he clearly does.  Okay so those were your main points. Then this:   No he hasn't? Well fuck him then. Jill Stein and O'Malley are still my top 2. I extremely dislike hoe people bring him up every 2 seconds and Reddit has become the home of sucking his dick for karma. /r/politics[1] is /r/Sandersforpresident[2] now and anytime you bring up any other presidential candidate you get downvoted.

That kind of internet hype will only watch you fizzle out when you get to the primaries as anyone who isn't vested in the internet most of their day will want real solutions to real problems. And Bernie in the end won't deliver on 80%+ of what he says.   Sanders definitely is not above criticism anymore than any other presidential candidate. As as Sanders supporter I am always on the lookout for things he can do better. I don't care about acting like someone is perfect--that's a great way to let flaws get out of control. Sanders needs to do better about clearly and specifically addressing racial issues, in my opinion. He's already started to get better at it though and I'm confident he will rise to the occasion. Real criticism is what's needed though, not poorly researched attacks...  But honestly, you just sound like you're hating on Sanders for the sake of it. Which hey, that's your prerogative. I doubt you'll even look at half the links I gave you above...  And I get that it can be really fuckin annoying when Sanders supporters seemingly jump down people's throat at any criticism, but shit man, actually bring some good criticism to the table.  I have a feeling Sanders could save you from a burning building and you'd still be like ""Fuck that guy."" And if that's how you wanna be, so be it."

If we really love and care for our own we need to address the real issues. Most of our young men and innocent by standers die in these types of struggles in the community. These young men need direction, we need to all pull together and unite against this cancer tearing us apart from the inside.

Great now all the gang bangers are free to sell drugs and engage in all the criminal activity that comes with it. The police will definitely never patrol the neighborhoods to try to keep innocent civilians safe since the war on drugs is over, so why even bother to go into the communities to stop these thugs? I agree these people need jobs though.   The education is quite dismal in many of these communities yes, but how can er convince these men to put their mind to education.

Blackfellas,3dst3n,CuilRunnings,3,Sun Jul 19 18:58:25 2015 UTC,"and i keep giving it to you:   ending the war on drugs significantly depreciates the value of selling drugs. it's not like they're selling drugs because it's fun, it's because it's the most economical opportunity out there. when it's no longer so, the negatives outweigh the benefits. the war on drugs does nothing to curb gang violence, and in most cases it likely increases violence. since the U.S. abroad is doing a horrible job of actually hindering the flow of drugs into these communities, all the war on drugs does on the community level is create a constant race for power on different blocks as members are either killed or jailed. those vacant blocks leads to a significant amount of the violence.  the war on drugs doesn't result in keeping the streets safe. it has done nothing to curb gang violence. all it does is stir up turmoil in those neighborhoods and lead to a significant number of non-violent offenders ending up in prison with ridiculous sentences, which only compounds the problem when these people get out."
Blackfellas,3dst3n,TheYellowRose,-2,Sun Jul 19 19:22:14 2015 UTC,"Ending the war on drugs is completely different than making all drugs legal. What these people are doing will still be illegal (along with many other criminal activities they engage in in the communities). So you will still have criminal activity in the communities. How do you think that allowing these people more freedom to engage in criminal activity would make things better? What you're saying makes no sense.   You are blaming an outside force for trying to enforce the law, but neglect to condemn the criminals who are killing innocent men women and children in our community? You're confusing criminals with the rest of our people. You think the war on drugs is oppressive to black people. It's oppressive to drug dealers hence the war on drugs. You're not a drug dealer and neither am I, a war on drug dealers is not our concern, why would it be? Why would we want anything other than less of this in our communities? You should have no sympathy to these criminals being relentlessly pursued. If you're not a drug dealer, it has no effect on you.    all it does is stir up turmoil in those neighborhoods and lead to a significant number of non-violent offenders ending up in prison with ridiculous sentences, which only compounds the problem when these people get out.    Weed is one thing, we have already seen from Colorado and Oregon that thinking is changing. However, this is much more than selling weed. It doesn't ""stir up turmoil in the community"". You think we should just let it fester? Allow the criminal elements in our community to grow larger (since they won't be being policed as you suggest)? How exactly does police trying to stop gang activity stir up turmoil in the neighborhoods?"
Blackfellas,3dst3n,structuralbiology,3,Sun Jul 19 19:30:25 2015 UTC,"Yes ending the war on drugs is different than legalizing all drugs. the war on drugs is does not curb violence, the war on drugs not dissuade from engaging in criminal behavior. the war on drugs is responsible for non-violent offenders receiving the majority of prison time. it is responsible for black people being disproportionately targeted despite using drugs at significantly lower rates.  the war on drugs compounds the fact the damage done from a lack of job opportunities. once you're in the prison system, it becomes significantly harder to find a job, and makes returning to selling drugs a much more economical decision. the war on drugs has strengthened the larger drug cartels by eliminating their competition. the U.S. literally facilitates the transfer of drugs into the country by paying off the larger cartels for tips on the smaller. eliminating the war on drugs and changing the current climate on drugs (legalizing some, decriminalizing others) reduces the economic benefit of selling drugs, which is why cartels are very worried that marijuana legalization is gaining traction across the u.s. you're approaching this with a black and white, either or mentality. acknowledging that we're handling these situations incorrectly is not the same as endorsing them.    as I've been saying, eliminate the disease rather than getting frustrated with the symptoms.   talking about these issues as if it's ""criminals vs. people"" is part of the issue. no one is born a criminal, there are situations that make criminality significantly more likely. there are people that are far more often to be seen AS criminals. we're on the losing end of all of that.  I would recommend the New Jim Crow. Very easy to read, and lays this information out very plainly."
Blackfellas,3dst3n,BoBab,-1,Sun Jul 19 20:07:56 2015 UTC,"We're going to have to agree to disagree. I've laid out plainly why I don't think you're viewing this incorrectly, and you clearly have a different perspective. I don't think that trying to absolve those engaging in criminal activity and murder of guilt helps the problem. You are conflating our community and those engaging in criminal activity as one when actually they are separate. Your defense of the very thing killing us is why the problem persists."
Blackfellas,3dst3n,structuralbiology,2,Sun Jul 19 20:18:51 2015 UTC,"/u/E-miles has already provided you with plenty of insight on ways to curb gang violence but you seem to be outright ignoring everything he's saying.    The police will definitely never patrol the neighborhoods to try to keep innocent civilians safe since the war on drugs is over, so why even bother to go into the communities to stop these thugs?   And this is exactly why Black Communities get targeted at such a high rate https://www.raceforward.org/videos/systemic-racism  Did you know that over 40% of drug arrests are not for selling any drugs but just for possession of marijuana? And that White and Black Americans are about equally likely to use marijuana, but Blacks are 3.7 more likely to be arrested for it? And that even if they don't get convicted of a crime that arrest can stay on their record and affect their chances at good jobs, housing and bank loans for the rest of their lives? https://www.raceforward.org/videos/systemic-racism  and  Did you know that in 2010 Black Americans made up 13% of the population but had only 2.7% of the country's wealth? That the median net worth for a white family was $134,000, but the median net worth for a Hispanic family was $14,000, and for a Black family it was $11,000? That the median wealth for a single white woman has been measured at $41,000, while for Hispanic women it was $140, and for Black women, $120?  Did you know that? Do you know what that's called? Systemic Racism, and yes, it's really a thing. https://www.raceforward.org/videos/systemic-racism   The education is quite dismal in many of these communities yes, but how can er convince these men to put their mind to education. If you work hard enough in school you can make a very successful life for yourself.   Did you know that no matter what else is going on in America, year in and year out for the last 60 years, Black unemployment is always about twice as high as white unemployment? And even if you just look at Black college graduates, they're still almost twice as likely to be unemployed as white college graduates? And if you just apply for a job with a white sounding name, you're 50% more likely to get a callback than with a Black sounding name? https://www.raceforward.org/videos/systemic-racism  When your city...  -Lacks jobs (and other opportunities)  -Lacks protection (due to apathetic police)   -Lacks proper education (and extracurricular activities)  ..of course your going to see a higher number of people turn toward gangs, their city has nothing else to offer. If you want to make an impact on gang violence we you need to start with acknowledging and removing the systemic racism in this country that limits opportunities for POC."
Blackfellas,3dst3n,BoBab,3,Sun Jul 19 20:26:12 2015 UTC,"A few major problems here: marijuana Prohibition takes men away from their families and puts them into criminal training camp (jail).

I agree about the children born out of committed relationships as well. Many times though, they not only don't have one of their parents, but the remaining one may not be a good example in their lives, thus continuing a viscous cycle when they have children themselves.

I feel like they're both perceived negatively, it's just in the case of African-Americans it conjures a lot of images of oppression hence they feel less comfortable letting out their true thoughts and they're ashamed of them hence try and correct it by upping their initial estimates. In scenarios like:   For one, it could impact a person's chances of gaining employment. If someone submits a résumé in which he describes himself as black instead of African American, the research suggests that it could raise bad connotations potentially reducing the chances of getting hired.   I don't see it as having too much of an effect because there's no observer, there's no one here grading you, the term African-American is gonna quickly elicit connotations of Black and all the shit that comes with that therefore I don't see you being judged any differently.   We get rid off and start making the word Black taboo like this dude implies then you know what's gonna happen? ""The African-American gang.."", ""The African-American shooter"", ""The African-American suspect"", ""The African-American rapists"", ""African-Americans on average have lower..."" etc you catch my drift.

Blackfellas,3dpogy,kitcat_kittycat,4,Tue Jul 21 15:51:29 2015 UTC,"I wonder if it's a matter of racial acknowledgement and White ideas of ""propriety"". To this White person who grew up in White communities, I was taught ""African-American"" is the term you're ""supposed"" to use, the polite, enlightened term. Subconsciously associated with intellectuals and the upper class.  Meanwhile I got the impression ""Black"" might be slightly racist (because in White culture, mentioning race is racism). It felt more in-your-face, more aggressive. In retrospect, it's obvious that was less about the word and more about the fact it demanded acknowledgement of the existence of race--and thus the inherent inequities I participate in--and has more direct political associations: Black Power, Black Panthers, Black Lives Matter, etc.  It's wasn't until the past few years--a bit before Trayvon--that I started really examining why that term made me squirm and looking for understanding about the difference between its use and African-American. I realized it wasn't my Black friends who had issues with the term, it was my White friends. I'm cool with it now but it's interesting to watch how other White people react when I use it around them.   Anyway, it would be interesting if they asked some follow-up questions after the survey to gauge the White respondents' personal comfort levels after reading questions with the different terms. I would bet you anything the White people who read ""Black"" over and over were feeling a lot worse than those with ""African-American""."

It isn't anecdotal as much as it is video evidence of this   Evidence for anyone who is as innumerate as much as they are illiterate. Have you actually presented your copypasta/infograph in an intro epidemiology class to see how it fares? If whites outnumber blacks 5:1 in America, it stands to reason that none of that statistics has actually been adjusted for size (even though that's besides the point).

So it's a risk-reward sort of thing: you don't think that the ""reward"" of supporting free speech (which is intangible and unquantifiable) justifies the risk of creating new Dylan Roofs who commit acts of racial violence (which is tangible and quantifiable). Well I definitely understand the concern. Even at the legal level, there are certain reasonable limits on free speech, such as defamation and encouraging violence. So I'm totally fine with Reddit banning a sub like /r/rapingwomen, which I'm really hoping is satirical.  The problem with your argument - or at least, what I'm interpreting as your argument - is that no one has been able to link any real-world racial violence to C***town. So it's hard to argue that C***town is actually making the world a more dangerous place. One common sentiment I've heard regarding that sub's users is   ""Haha, bunch of whiny pansies. I bet when they see a black person IRL they don't say any of that racist shit. All that 'white power' shit goes away real quick when they aren't protected behind a computer screen!""

You can't say this, then turn around and claim that the sub is breeding new domestic racial terrorists. Either they really are threats to public safety, or they are not.   You're missing the possibility that it could be both of those scenarios.  I happen to believe the above to some extent, I think a good chunk of these posters are cowards who largely do this because it's online and they're anonymous.  But that doesn't mean they aren't dangerous for having more of a backbone online (through doxxing, extreme harassment especially as threats with death or (sexual) violence) or mean that there aren't any willing to lash out IRL because they receive ample support for their terrible views online.  Mob mentality is a real thing and while a lot of them are cowards, cowards aren't necessarily harmless, there's a reason when they choose to lash out it's always someone more vulnerable."
Blackfellas,3dma69,lawlschool88,2,Fri Jul 17 20:22:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Also, what if that mentality spills over into their day to day interactions with PoCs? Not a big leap to assume that having their toxic views supported by like-minded individuals will affect how they treat PoCs. The sub doesn't need to breed domestic terrorism to be harmful to society, propagating the mentality that supports racial oppression is harm enough."
Blackfellas,3dma69,MusaTheRedGuard,2,Fri Jul 17 20:30:48 2015 UTC,"Precisely.  Even at its best, they could just be doing really passive aggressive behavior, but they're still doing it to people who are innocent/uninvolved and that's still isn't fair.  As if these racist attitude and behaviors are only limited to the extreme.   The sub doesn't need to breed domestic terrorism to be harmful to society, propagating the mentality that supports racial oppression is harm enough.   Boom."
Blackfellas,3dma69,Zer0SuitLucina,2,Fri Jul 17 21:13:00 2015 UTC,"Closer to my argument, but not quite there. Yes, I am concerned to a degree that allowing breeding grounds of hate will lead to the next Roof, but that's not the reason I think Reddit should get rid of CoonTown. I think Reddit should ban it simply because it's a deplorable place that no one in their right mind can reasonably support.   I'm not saying ""Reddit should violate the principle of free speech if the speech leads to violence,"" that's Reddit's argument, and that's exactly what I'm questioning.    Reddit's a company that can do whatever the fuck it wants. Tomorrow, it could decide that we're only allowed to post pictures of cats. I'm sure we'd all be pissed, but its well within its rights as a company to decide what does or does not get posted on the site.   Given that Reddit has complete control over content, why does it allow CoonTown to exist? It can set whatever thresholds it wants on its bars to ""free speech,"" and it obviously has on numerous occasions, so what's the justification for not raising the bar a little higher, and banning subs dedicated to hate?"
Blackfellas,3dma69,E-Miles,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:59:50 2015 UTC,"I think Reddit should ban it simply because it's a deplorable place that no one in their right mind can reasonably support.   So this is your real argument? It seems very weak to me. I could say the same thing about a lot of subs I don't approve of (such as /r/sexwithdogs, which features... well, guess), doesn't mean they should be banned.   Given that Reddit has complete control over content, why does it allow C***Town to exist?   Because they know the effect it'd have on the rest of the site. Regardless of whether you do or don't support the whole ""free speech"" ideal, a lot of users on this site do. I checked C***town's front page shortly after the Yishan post, and it had a ton of support from both new racists, and people who just thought they should have the right to keep doing what they do. Whenever that sub is mentioned or discussed, even in a negative way, it actually grows. People actually like the fact that a group is allowed to express these views as they please, even if they don't like the views themselves. My guess is that banning C***town would result in losing more users than the site gains - and while you don't care about that, the website's employees and senior management probably do.   so what's the justification for not raising the bar a little higher, and banning subs dedicated to hate?   Let's turn this question around: why should they raise the bar? I think I've explained the rationale behind why they would allow C***town to exist - but now it's your turn. What is the real benefit to content-policing subreddits? If your only argument is ""so hateful subs don't exist!"" that's terrible - as long as these subs don't directly interact with me, I am not affected at all by them."
Blackfellas,3dma69,MusaTheRedGuard,0,Sat Jul 18 08:12:09 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: What's so great about free speech in the context of a website?    Well yes, at a basic level, I think it should be banned because it's a hateful sub. It might not be a strong or compelling argument, but I wouldn't say it's terrible.  But to expand, let's go back to your earlier point about the potential for another Dylan. The sub is an echo chamber for hate. It allows people to express their hatred for black people freely and without judgement. It might not lead to another Dylan, but it could. Or, more likely, the things they learn there, and the fact their negative views get support, can bleed out into their day to day interactions with PoCs. It's a breeding ground for hate, and while it might not affect you or I, I find it hard to believe it won't affect others in a negative manner. Simply put, do we want to allow this hatred to propagate? I certainly don't, but Reddit seems perfectly fine with it. And is ""apathy"" because it doesn't affect you directly really a compelling argument?  And this circles back to my question of whether CoonTown is really where you, Reddit, and likeminded individuals want to hang their hat on the ""principle"" of free speech. Again, is the ""principle"" of free speech so important as to justify allowing CoonTown? Do you and others really want to say ""I support this nonjudicial ideal of allowing people to say whatever they want on a private company's website so much that I'm ok with allowing racists to congregate and support each other in hating an entire group of people based solely on the color of their skin.""     To get utilitarian for a moment, does the ""good"" that comes from supporting free speech outweigh the ""harm"" that allowing a racist echo chamber to exist does or could bring about? And vice versa. Does the ""harm"" (presumably some sort of chilling effect, but that gets us to slippery slope territory) to the ""principle"" of free speech outweigh the ""good"" (helping end the propagation of poisonous ideology) that would come from banning CoonTown?  I don't disagree with your theory of why Reddit allows it to stay (i.e. they'd lose traffic), I just think that's a shit reason in theory. The argument you're making is that so many people would be outraged by the affront to ""free speech"" if CoonTown got banned that they'd go off to Voat or somewhere else. That's a satisfactory answer in a business sense, but not in a philosophical sense. Again, back to the ""hang your hat"" bit: would it really be worth getting outraged over the ban of CoonTown, is it really an affront to free speech, and if so, is that really a problem?     Also, I'm becoming more and more convinced that the argument from the nonlegal principle of ""free speech"" is circular. If we say the nonlegal ""principle"" of free speech is that people should be allowed to say what they want, if someone claims that CoonTown should exist because of free speech, all they're claiming is that CoonTown should exist because they should be able to say what they want. But, why should they be able to say what they want? You can't say ""because of free speech,"" since that's circular.   The problem I'm having with the principle of free speech is that people act like it's a justification in and of itself, and use it as the end of the debate. We've blindly accepted that ""free speech,"" solely in the context of what one can or cannot express on a company's website, is inherently good, and because we think it's good we assume that it's sufficient justification to allow deplorable content. But, again, what is so great about allowing shit like CoonTown to exist under the guise of ""free speech?"" Reddit's already imposed plenty of restrictions on free speech (creepshots, jailbait, rapingwomen, etc) that I would hope most people aren't against, so we've already shown that ""free speech"" isn't truly free.  Again, if allowing CoonTown to exist is a victory for free speech on a company's website, is that really a victory you want to be a part of? I assume the answer is yes, but why? Solely in the context of what a corporation allows you to say on its website, that has already imposed numerous restrictions on free speech, is this really where you want to take a stand?     Most of these questions are what my thought process has been over the past few days, following my disillusionment with the ""principle"" of free speech. I certainly think that it's important to legally protect free speech, I (probably) wouldn't advocate any legal action against people who spew racial hatred, but that's not what's at stake here. This is purely about whether or not Reddit wants to be complicit in allowing a breeding ground of hate to exist on its platform, and is about ""free speech"" solely in the context of a company that has already show they're more than willing to restrict what users may or may not discuss.   Honestly, I think this ""free speech"" nonsense is nothing more than a corporate game. When they announced bans on subreddits, the reddit community called out Reddit for being a corporate shill, sanitizing their website in order to entice advertisers. But your point, which I believe is reasonable, is that too much restriction on ""free speech"" will drive users away, which reduces the site's value to advertisers.   So it's all just about how much ""free speech"" Reddit is willing to let us have. I'm in favor of tighter restrictions if it removes things like CoonTown, because I think more harm that good comes from allowing a safe haven for racial hatred. Others, and I assume you, are in favor of the current, or perhaps less, restrictions, for reasons I can't fathom. I assume the reason is ""free speech,"" but I don't see how ""free speech"" purely in the context of what's allowed on a website is a compelling reason to allow subs like CoonTown to exist."

We don't quite know the full story yet or the complete facts. I can tell you living in Texas that I have never ever been asked to step out of my vehicle in any of my traffic stops (one for improper lane change, five for speeding). My mother always told me growing up that when pulled over I should put the car in park, place my keys on the dash, and if it is night-time turn on my inside car light. I am also always cooperative with the officer even if I don't agree with them. This is not only for the officers safety, but my own.   I can imagine Sandra was going through a firestorm of emotion. She just got a new job for which she was extremely excited and was likely going to change her life for the better. In route to this job she was pulled over and subsequently arrested for assaulting an officer (allegedly) which can in some circumstances lose you a job, which may have been weighing on her mind. You never know what she may have been thinking, and she may have just thought it was all too much to handle, just thinking out loud here. And where the hell is the dash cam footage of this, very unfortunate there seems not to be any so we can get a look at the incident from start to finish. What we do have is a video she is complaining of her head, and alarmingly says ""I can't hear"" which is a pretty specific complaint that would definitely come from legit head trauma.

The officers and police chief, who are the targets of the complaints, are white. Some residents are calling for a third of the city's 15 person police force to be suspended, disciplined, or fired. Allegations of racism have led to the Hempstead police chief being suspended and ordered to take anger management classes.  The Hempstead city council has been reviewing the case since last week and finally came to a decision at around 2am Tuesday. A number of residents have come forward with claims of racism by at least four white police officers.  The council reviewed the complaints, along with videotapes before making their decision to punish Chief Glen Smith. Some say it wasn't enough. The chief says he respects the decision.  ""My action during the arrest did not meet professionalism as it should with language and I'm not above policy and procedure, no more than any officer of this city,"" said Chief Smith.""  Wasn't the arresting officer, but the chief, her comment didn't say arresting officer.   White man was found hanged in that same jail three years ago.   He gave no indication of suicidal behavior before found hanged either.   http://m.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Inmate-found-hanging-at-Waller-County-jail-4012244.php"

West comes from a certain flavor/school of Black progressive academia that is really good at tearing down the efforts of other Black progressives who just don't hit his bar of progressiveness.  He's had nothing but rotten shit to say about Blacks who have unquestionably done good by both themselves and the broader ""Black community"" including but not limited to his constant attacks on Obama and the like.

Based on the comments on the writeup itself it looks like you might be getting hit by the upvote/downvote obfuscation - the good part about this is (I'm guessing because reddit's a black box on the obfuscation) it's probably just like 5% jitter rng'd in, and with so much actual data here it's not really affecting the analysis/outcome.

The difference is that the problems a new person will run into are problems experienced people have already run into, spent many painful hours solving, and, accordingly, have the solution sealed as self-evident in the mind to the point where you don't think about it, which speeds up the process -- whereas the new person would be trekking stackoverflow and github and irc for answers to one of the problems that would solve one of the problems that would solve  part of the original problem they were trying to solve (exaggeration but this is how it gets sometimes haha). You don't forget this, and the next time you come across that problem or a similar one you'll be that much quicker, and that much more skilled.

They might have knowingly took them, but if Bill Cosby told them ''I'm gonna have sex with your unconscious body after you pass out as a result of taking these drugs'', then most probably wouldn't have took them. Consenting to taking the drugs is not the same as consenting to having sex. And, if you're sober, and continuously buy drinks for a woman hoping to lower her inhibitions to a point where she'll have sex with you, then that's kinda rapey too."

My perception was he was admitting to buying drugs with the intent of giving them to women and then having sex while on the drugs. The same way plenty of people have sex whether you want to accept it or not. There's a reason Liquor, Weed, Coke, Molly and so on are billion dollar businesses."

Blackfellas,3dja9t,Alienm00se,0,Thu Jul 16 18:50:15 2015 UTC,"Andrew Duncomb (in the video on the article)....I salute your bravery sir. It took some serious balls for him to stand up for what he believes and put his real name on national tv for an interview considering the color of his skin lol. I think especially for those of us who actually live in the south this is a bit of a complicated issue, because many of of (probably) have experience with the flag but not in negative ways. I know there are some people who use this flag as a symbol of hatred, but at the same time I know from first hand experience growing up there are people who do not use the flag for this reason. For instance in high school I had one good friend who I played football with. He had a small confederate flag sticker on his lifted truck. For him it meant pride in a wild, southern country attitude. It meant he was an avid hunter, liked to go ""mudding"" (which always sounded so dumb to me) etc. Me and all the other black kids on the team had no problem with him and we were all good friends. In fact we never gave any thought to the flag. He was absolutely not racist, nor were his parents who I saw whenever I went to his house and were very kind and hospitable to me.   So I pause knowing that, but at the same time I know many people do use it for hate. It still represents the confederates who were mostly fighting to keep the institution of slavery and that is just an inescapable fact. So I think absolutely right that the flag is moved from all federal life and I hope that in time people who do use it for genuine reasons will realize that what it represents is tainted, even if they don't stand for those reasons. Right now though, all this is going to do is make people defend the flag, so we can expect more of this."

I get the sentiment but it is the listener that hears the term white privilege allows it to be a conversation ended. It's more like a notice to shut the fuck up and listen for a change. Dancing around the language to help white feelings is nearly an expression of white privilege itself.

This was in the mid-90s in Eastern NC. I was with a couple of white friends and we were hanging out with a girl I'd just met (but they already knew her). When we arrived at her house, she scoffed at seeing that her dad was home, and turned to me on the porch to say that we were all going to quickly go to her room and not stop on the way in. She got called back by her dad while the rest of us were in her room, and we ended up leaving quickly afterward.  What this clip gets right is the complicity of the rest of the family. The mom telling the husband to ""keep it down,"" because obviously volume is the most problematic part of what is being said. There's no confrontation from the son or the wife as they begrudgingly accept this man's racism, and unfortunately (knowingly) drag a friend into it. I say knowingly because the mom is already thinking about how to soften the blow when the dad learns there's a black kid in his house.

My heart cried as I listened to Felicia Sanders, mother of Tywanza Sanders, say “May God have mercy on you;” Reverend Anthony Thompson, husband of Myra Thompson, “I forgive you; the daughter of Ethel Sanders say, “I forgive you” four times during the hearing of the domestic terrorist (whose name doesn’t deserve recognition).  I wondered, what are the functions of this? I understand forgiveness is for the liberation of the victimized, and not the victimizer. But I must say, I have come to know forgiveness through a noticeably different lense than a large portion of the white American public.

They kept jailbait for as long as they could until it became big enough to become a liability. Same thing happened when they finally decided to end 'the fappening' and FPH (throwing a couple of smaller hate subs into the mix rather than the bigger ones). If they wanted to get rid of the other hate subs they would have done it in a heartbeat, but they'll risk alienating said demographic with each crack down (nothing brings white males together more than racism). I'm pretty sure /u/yishan, sounding like Reddit's own Strom Thurmond, is just concocting another narrative of Reddit, that seeks to revise its own history as one of always being the 'good' guys all along.

Ignore the party affiliations, whatever they may be, and vote for who represents your interests.  This means being open to actually listening to the other side.  You may not agree, but having a better idea of what their position is will give you a way to explain to yourself and others why their position is not the one for you, instead of it being arbitrarily based on their political affiliation."

I lean strongly liberal/socialist, but that doesn't mean there aren't aspects of conservatism that I get, especially in respect to fiscal conservatism.  For instance, I definitely agree that a large amount of governance results in wasted taxpayer dollars... the difference is I really don't believe that this is restricted to governance, I am pretty damn sure large corporations waste just as much money on bad decisions as well.  Yes, government waste is a problem, and I absolutely agree with that (and not just in military spending, I absolutely agree that we have to step back and properly budget things like Social Security and Medicare, it's currently unsustainable), I just have different ideas about what will fix it, as opposed to believing the free market will solve all ills."

I just felt the GOP candidates (especially Palin) were too crazy for me to vote for. I'm a big news junkie, so a lot of things I want to hear are how a prospective president plans on handling foreign policy issues, terrorism, our national security, military operations etc, the kind of bigger picture things about how our Country will deal with the rest of the world, it's leaders and our place in the world going forward.

The GOP clearly doesn't represent my viewpoints/interests and they're too many candidates at this point. Seems like a waste of time. I'll watch it if I notice it's on but it's not something I schedule. I normally watch the later debates (once the field is narrowed) and the GOP convention so I'm informed about who's running and the specifics of their policies.  I'm more likely to watch all of the democratic events leading up to the presidential election. Although I still don't prioritize early debates if there are a lot of candidates, I'm likely to already be interested in one or more of the candidates.

Blackfellas,3d9c2m,BoBab,2,Wed Jul 15 04:08:44 2015 UTC,Sanders is too hyped and doesn't stand or talk what I care about. I support Martin O'Malley and Jill Stein. Both are fringe candidates with small followings. I wish Jill Stein at least made it to the primaries. The party I identify most with is the Green Party and it is a much smaller party with few big politicians in high power offices. But I like it.

Bernie doesn't shy away from talking about the real meat of the issues  And Bernie actually was active in the civil rights movement  If this has nothing to do with your feelings towards him then disregard! I am more than open to talk about Bernie though!"
Blackfellas,3d9c2m,BoBab,2,Wed Jul 15 04:13:28 2015 UTC,"No reason not to give all candidates a look.  I agree he should try and give some concrete plans, but he's at least talking about it right now in the wake of the Charleston terrorist attack.   The thing about Bernie is that he is a senator from Vermont. Bernie, unlike a lot of politicians, truly believes in being a voice for his constituents. He talks about it here how in rural Vermont gun control means a different thing than gun control urban Chicago. I think that is something we can all agree on at the very least. And I agree with him that the two differing gun cultures in America need to keep that in mind during the discussion.  Here's a quote from an Aljazeera article that in my opinion sums up how Bernie looks at gun laws/control:   Sanders defended his record on gun control, noting that he took “very, very difficult votes” in favor of the 1994 assault weapons ban and, in 2013, to close the gun show background check loophole.  “With all due respect, you also cast the vote to allow gun manufacturers to never be sued,” Laszlo interjected.  “Right I did, OK?” Sanders fired back, adding later, “Why would I have voted that way? Because if somebody has a gun and somebody steals that gun and they shoot somebody with it, do you really think it makes sense to blame the manufacturer of that weapon? If somebody sells you a baseball bat and somebody hits you over the head with it, you’re not going to sue the baseball bat manufacturer.”   Everyone may not agree with him (I'm not sure I agree with him 100%), but I do not think he is using flawed reasoning.   He has started already proposing changes for women being treated better in the workplace, namely he thinks women (and men) should actually get a proper amount of paid leave when a women has a new child.  Here is him saying the gender pay gap is completely unacceptable.  Since announcing his candidacy he has already introduced  concrete legislation for free college, paid leave, and attacking the youth unemployment rate.  GovTrack.Us shows:   Some of Sanders’s most recently sponsored bills include...  S. 1713: A bill to require the Secretary of Energy to provide loans and grants ...  S. 1677: Responsible Estate Tax Act  S. 1631: Keep Our Pension Promises Act  S. 1564: Guaranteed Paid Vacation Act  S. 1506: Employ Young Americans Now Act  S. 1373: College for All Act   There's no reason to think he won't continue introducing progressive legislation in regards to topics such inequality in the workplace and gun control. Sanders doesn't seem like someone who rushes decisions though."

Obama was my first presidential election where I was of voting age, and I didn't even feel comfortable enough to personally vouch for him. Obama still felt like a typical politician. I didn't want to vouch for him because I figured he would do things I would be more than uncomfortable with and therefore have my foot in my mouth saying ""he's different, he's awesome!""  I personally do vouch for Sanders though, and feel comfortable letting anyone know. I'm not afraid of having my foot in my mouth or defending him. I may be only in my 20's but I've seen plenty of people twice my age or more saying the exact same thing, and they say that Bernie is the first politician in their lifetime they've felt this way about.

The first is the Academic Index, based on grades and board scores. The second is the Personal Achievement Index, based on two independently graded essays plus six other factors: leadership potential, honors and awards, work experience, community service, extracurricular activities and special circumstances.  Only this last category, special circumstances, can include consideration of race or ethnicity, or, for that matter, economic circumstances, or whether the applicant comes from a home where English is not spoken.  The overall Personal Achievement Index score, a maximum of 6, is combined with the Academic Index score, and then plotted on a graph. Based on the available number of seats, everyone above a certain combined score on the graph is admitted, and everyone below is rejected. The university says Fisher fell below the line.  ""Even if Abigail Fisher had received a perfect Personal Achievement Index score she would not have been admitted ... because her Academic Index was simply not high enough,"" says Gregory Garre, lawyer for the University.    So in fact The University of Texas has a science behind this not just looking at a white and a black kid next to each other and what she is questioning is 1/12th of the equation. It's a very small factor and not entirely based on race either. The University has said here even if she had a perfect Personal Achievement Index (And we can't even presume it was 5/6) she would have fell below the line.    Affirmative Action has clearly led to higher minority participation and graduation in the Higher Ed system, leading to further social equality.   From the same article:   Until 1996, UT operated like most other state schools; it had a selective admissions system that included using race or ethnicity as a factor. In 1996, however, a federal appeals court ruled that any racial considerations in admission were unconstitutional.  The immediate effect was that minority enrollment plummeted by 40 percent, the university says."

Blackfellas,3d2vau,ty1737,11,Mon Jul 13 02:15:21 2015 UTC,"We've reached a point with Black Men's hair, where pretty much anything goes. Basic thing you can do is just take some clippers and keep it short. I shaved my head for about 15 years using a razor, I liked a Mach 3. I'd run the clippers through then shave it. If I was feeling lazy only had to do it once a month and took me 20 minutes. Just make sure to moisturize your scalp. I personally like coconut oil. But I've had some luck with olive oil and a lot of people like cocoa butter.  A lot of men just keep it very short, some might get a fade, and high top fades are back in. I'm getting old because I'm starting to see dudes with fades that look like mohawks. If you keep it even you should go to the barber at least once a month. With a fade you should go at least twice a month to once a week to keep it looking decent. It is important to find a barber to specializes in Black hair. Our hair has special needs, and behaves in special ways, so it takes special skills. Again moisturize with anything I mentioned earlier.   Afros are an option too, but they require more daily up keep, but once you get them started you can go to the barber less often. I'm now doing sponge twists (using Magic Twist, YouTube it). It's a nice forgiving hair style, takes 5 minutes a day to do and I don't have to visit the barber often to take care of it. I've never dealt with cornrows, braids or locks, so I couldn't tell you what that like to deal with.  You shouldn't wash Black hair that often, it's prone to drying out (again moisturize daily), I do mine about weekly with an organic soap, regular shampoo and soap tends to strip out too much moisture. I'll rinse my hair out with plain water after a workout to rinse out the salt from the sweat. I'll use regular shampoo maybe once every couple of months if I want a deep clean, but thats only if it feels real dirty after doing a lot of outdoors stuff.  Shaving, you need to watch out for razor bumps. If you use a razor, make sure you exfoliate (I know...I know). Trust me, spending a few minutes with a loofa in a circular motion before you shave will save you lots of problems later. Sometimes, I will switch back and forth between electric and a regular razor, it lets my skin calm down even though the shave isn't as good. There are a ton of you tube videos for how to shave black skin. Try a few out, take the tips you like, ignore the ones you don't.  The important thing to remember, grooming and finding your personal style is a journey, try to have fun with it. Hope this helped."

To add onto the shampooing once a week, if you feel that your hair is getting dry before then, you can drench your hair in water and apply your favorite oil. I do this 3-4x a week.

My usual routine when showering is detangling with my fingers using Olive Cholesterol. That leaves me satisfied if I'm just going out. I detangle with a Denman brush when I have somewhere important to go or I need to legitimately detangle. That's followed by putting eco style gel in to keep the look for like 5 days. This way I don't need daily upkeep other than spaying with water and shaking my head. It's a process though, so I have my sister do it usually. You have to coat like every strand of hair.

I understand the concept but I don’t want to be on or supporting a site that is increasingly becoming a safe haven for white power advocates. Yes, we live in a world where there are racists but I don’t want to have to deal with them constantly in my house because they’ve set up camp on the lawn.   So I created a site using postatic.com, which I think gives about the same layout and feeling that we’re used to on Reddit. MANY features and customizations (yeah what you see, is what you get, it’s pretty plain) are missing from what Reddit has to offer but I think we could make it work at least until something better comes along if you guys want to. The major plus is that it is an isolated site, so you don’t have to deal with trash spilling in from other subreddits or brigading. If the mods here want to moderate the site as they currently do I have no problem with that (the modding tools don’t seem to be as extensive as reddit currently though).

I use Reddit for two things only - Entertainment & How-to explanations. All of that other content that is offensive or irrelevant to me, I block/ignore/don't give the time of day. I wish that we lived in a world where people were decent, but we don't. And its a shame that this site does support (allow) forums for hate speech under the guise of ""free speech"". Don't think that can/will change anytime soon. B/c it's the internet."
Blackfellas,3d381y,Simon_Brezhnev,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:23:47 2015 UTC,Activity is my main concern. New users stumble upon here and ladies but how will they find there?
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,3xxx0,7,Sun Jul 12 16:42:15 2015 UTC,"Yep, the end is nigh here for me... we can't keep supporting this site with our communities. Maybe it's time we black out and turn it into a private sub or move out completely."
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,deepsoulfunk,10,Sun Jul 12 22:42:45 2015 UTC,"Ever since Baltimore and all of the dog whistle racism that filled the front page, I've been wanting to move elsewhere."
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,Jermaine313,12,Sun Jul 12 22:47:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, I knew this site was prejudice toward blacks but ferguson and Baltimore really brought the stormfront out of reddit."
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,blacklonewolf,7,Mon Jul 13 00:32:55 2015 UTC,I'm about ready to leave too. Does anyone know of any other options?
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,hephaestusroman,9,Sun Jul 12 23:10:57 2015 UTC,"I sometimes roll my eyes at those who ask forums to aggressively police their content, deeming them overly reactionary or divisive.    But not this time.  This was beautifully written, clearly stated and exceptionally measured.  Thank you so much for this.  I hope the writer comes back because the community needs more voices like his."
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,jinnstar,3,Sun Jul 12 21:54:54 2015 UTC,What are the real alternatives though?
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,Cool_Muhl,3,Sun Jul 12 23:41:47 2015 UTC,"I can kinda see why reddit is hesitant to ban coontown or beatingwomen. It's easy to ban those but what about subreddits like theredpill or darkenlightenment? The former is rooted in emphasis of gender-realism undertones and the latter racial-realism so do you also ban them for misoygny/racism? Is it a case of these subreddits are gonna be allowed because they like to intellectualize their racism/misoygny? If so, is that really better? Remember how creepshots got banned yet has now resurfaced under the guise of candidfashionpolice which has 50k subscribers?   There's no mainstream websites/apps (Youtube/Twitter/Facebook/Kik/Snapchat/Tumblr etc) that hasn't got a racist-network. It's just the price you pay for popularity, even in European countries with hate-laws there are always ways to get past them and operate legally.   The most frightening and dangerous racism doesn't come from those subreddits, it comes from articles/videos on /r/news or /r/worldnews or /r/videos or/r/todayilearned. And what to do with these bring us into even murkier waters."
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,esoteric_enigma,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:59:42 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with you here. There just isn't going to be a site, a popular site, without it's racial issues.  The issue we're having is that we're paying heed to all the bad subs on this broad, let me emphasize broad, social network. Yes coontown, and niggers (I think it's still up) are still subreddits that are on Reddit, but that isn't ALL of Reddit. We need to stop giving these subs attention. You're all focusing on the negative here. Yes they're bad subs, and yes they exist, but once we come to terms with that what else is there left to do? Bitching and moaning about it isn't going to get rid of the issue. Turn a blind eye and forget about it. There's nothing you can do to change those people's state of mind or rid reddit of that crap.   What we should do about the main subs is just unsub and move on. I have no main subs on my list anymore. Reddit is so large there are literally dozens of alternatives than the main subs. We act like this problem is effecting us, that we're victims. When we as users have the power to alter what we're exposed to on this site. Racism is there, it's probably going to always be there, what we as users can do is remove ourselves from subs we don't like and move on to something else."
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,theworldisbullshit,-2,Mon Jul 13 02:34:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not going anywhere. I find reddit to be no more racist than every other site online that allows you to just be a username. I'm sure coontown is a terrible place but thanks to the model of this site, I never have to see it. I get why he's leaving. This is a business and they are profiting from coontown, but I just happen agree with reddit's libertarian stance. I think it's better than the alternative, censorship. If you take down coontown because it's offensive to most, then you take down atheism subs because they are offensive to the religious, it won't be long before they are closing down black subs because a lot of white people don't like the shit we say in here. I can already see it ""They shut down coontown but not Blackfellas? Reverse racism!""."
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,SpotLightGuy,10,Mon Jul 13 00:05:06 2015 UTC,"I hate this slippery slope argument. Banning hate subs wouldn't harm reddit, it would actually be a great move. Coontown is nothing like blackfellas even the people who hate this sub know that."
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,theworldisbullshit,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:16:51 2015 UTC,"Bro they just banned a bunch of hate subs and brought on a mass exodus shit storm. Like it or not Reddit exists as an anonymous space for free speech, if they expand the reasoning for bans to include ""offended someone"" there will be a ton of people who leave on principal alone. This would result in a ton of traffic to their competitors, which would definitely be harmful."
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,SpotLightGuy,4,Mon Jul 13 00:25:35 2015 UTC,"Banning fatpeoplehate did nothing. They were all bluffing. They are not going to leave reddit over racists subs being banned and if the racists leave, so what? The site would be better off."
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,theworldisbullshit,0,Mon Jul 13 00:29:49 2015 UTC,"Everybody in r/Coontown used to hang in r/GreatApes. r/GreatApes used to be called r/Niggers until it was banned. It's super easy to create a new sub.   Like you said, banning does nothing. It would be symbolic, empty and only embolden those assholes with an even deeper persecution complex; similar to the whole confederate flag situation.   What it wouldn't do is change Reddit one bit. Check the default subs for confirmation of that."
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,SpotLightGuy,4,Mon Jul 13 00:38:03 2015 UTC,What I meant was that banning these subs won't make everyone leave reddit.
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,esoteric_enigma,0,Mon Jul 13 00:57:36 2015 UTC,I know what you meant. Regardless you can't say that changing the way subs get banned wouldn't harm Reddit when there's a ton of people stating it would certainly cause them to leave and you definitely can't prove how many people were bluffing.
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,theworldisbullshit,-2,Mon Jul 13 02:18:10 2015 UTC,It's a slope because the two subs aren't alike. First you remove the obvious undisputed hateful subs. Then you remove the not so obvious ones. Eventually activist will have the site keep pushing the line further and further to the point where you're questioning the existence of anything controversial or offensive to anyone. You have to admit many of the things we say here are controversial and would not be welcome to the eyes and ears of mainstream white society.
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,esoteric_enigma,8,Mon Jul 13 00:21:47 2015 UTC,"That's not how it works. If reddit came up with a new rule that they were going to ban hate subs, blackfellas wouldn't be touched because it's NOT a hate sub by any definition. It's not about being ""offended"" as you keep saying. These same hate subs brigade and harass users. Why should that be tolerated?"
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,MoreDblRainbows,-5,Mon Jul 13 00:35:09 2015 UTC,"What stops reddit from making new rules after that taking the censorship further? Nothing. Hence the slope. Once you show people you are willing to censor, they will always come back for more. I don't know what brigading is and how does a sub harass you if you aren't visiting it?"
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,GeneralBuhari,7,Mon Jul 13 00:40:24 2015 UTC,"Brigading is going into other subs and encouraging others to do so for the express purpose of downvoting, arguing etc etc. Its against reddit's stated rules.   Subs can harass people by tracking posts and encouraging peole on the sub to constantly comment send PMs etc, its also part of brigading."
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,SpotLightGuy,8,Mon Jul 13 00:43:12 2015 UTC,"None of that 'censorship' claim makes any sense. Reddit isn't a government (you're thinking of North Korea), nor does it  have  total control over your internet. Narrowing or expanding the boundaries of free speech by a private entity like Reddit doesn't constitute censorship nor make it more 'free'.   If you take down coontown because it's offensive to most, then you take down atheism subs because they are offensive to the religious   Yeah, first they came for jailbait, I didn't speak out because there was no natural sequence to be found. A lot of coontown rhetoric is inciteful hate speech (a la Dylann Roof) and harassment, not limited to brigading of this subreddit and /r/blackladies. Thus, the difference between /r/atheism and coontown is context, which doesn't lend itself to your syllogism. In every society, certain things acquire meaning well beyond a dictionary entry. Coontown subreddit or burning a cross is an example of that. There isn't any idea being conveyed there or worth debating; no expressive activity except constant calls to terror or genocide of black people, most of which isn't even protected speech."
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,MoreDblRainbows,-2,Mon Jul 13 05:14:14 2015 UTC,"Hope this fella doesn't have a Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or YouTube channel."
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,SpotLightGuy,5,Sun Jul 12 22:50:28 2015 UTC,"Twitter, Facebook, and Youtube at least attempt to monitor hate language. I can;t really speak for Instagram since I don't use it."
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,MoreDblRainbows,-2,Sun Jul 12 23:51:57 2015 UTC,"Monitor or not you can't deny the fact that there are thousands of users on those sites who use the same language that dude is boycotting Reddit over. The point remains, using ANY of those sites is helping to ""keep the lights on"" for racist hate speech if we use his logic."
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,SpotLightGuy,3,Mon Jul 13 00:00:22 2015 UTC,I guess I(and the author I would assume) see a distinction between people using a site to do hateful things and the site not being able to keep up with it. And a site actively saying they will not monitor it and it is a part of their values.   Ultimately we can't control people but we can control our response to them.
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,MoreDblRainbows,-2,Mon Jul 13 00:03:05 2015 UTC,"My impression is that Reddit is trying to draw a distinction between saying foul shit amongst people who subscribe to see those comments and doing foul shit to others such as attacks, brigading, etc.  Asking them to censor any subreddit that is just saying shit that we don't like is a slippery slope. I'm sure there are plenty of dumbasses who dislike the fact that this sub exists too but we'd all lose our shit if they tried to ban on some ""reverse racism/black power"" shit."
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,GeneralBuhari,5,Mon Jul 13 00:15:34 2015 UTC,"Meh I don't think its that slippery of a slope. I think there is a pretty clear line between stuff people don't like and hate speech.  Just like most subs have rules that 99.9% of people can follow without incident yet still are free to disagree with each other.   I do get the point you're trying to make though, I just think that reddit doesn't seem to be approaching it in the same way you are thinking about it. Though the result I guess ends up more or less the same."
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,SpotLightGuy,5,Mon Jul 13 00:19:21 2015 UTC,"But those sites don't have a default racist frontpage, and you can curate who you follow or add. Here you still get coontowners dropping by ever so often or brigading large subs you share with them.  Youtube comments are rarely legible, and nobody watches Youtube for the comments."
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,GeneralBuhari,-3,Mon Jul 13 00:29:21 2015 UTC,"The default subs have racist people because the world has racist people. That doesn't make Reddit racist, it just makes it an easy way for the punks to be themselves. And just like those other sites you can easily curate which subs you see."
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,SpotLightGuy,4,Mon Jul 13 00:48:11 2015 UTC,"The default subs have racist people because the world has racist people.    The world also has paedophiles (jailbait), spammers, 419 scammers, and poachers. I don't see them on the frontpage."
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,GeneralBuhari,-2,Mon Jul 13 01:28:43 2015 UTC,What exactly is your point? There are no hate subs on the front page.
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,SpotLightGuy,4,Mon Jul 13 01:51:39 2015 UTC,Who mentioned anything about hate subs? You don't need a dedicated  hate sub to promote hate speech or content.
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,GeneralBuhari,-1,Mon Jul 13 01:53:51 2015 UTC,To expect Reddit to delete every single comment you deem to be hate speech is childish and unsustainable.
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,SpotLightGuy,7,Mon Jul 13 02:05:59 2015 UTC,Which is why the title of the post is quitting reddit because the alternative shouldn't be dealing with a deluge of racism on the regular. You were the one that made it sound as if there were no alternatives when nothing might be better than Reddit after a point as the site deteriorates further.
Blackfellas,3d0yq6,Breakfast_Explosion,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:08:49 2015 UTC,"The post was about quitting Reddit because they wont ban every subreddit the author deemed to be hateful, not because he was dealing with a deluge of racism. In fact he mentions how he likes almost everyone he's ever interacted with on Reddit.   You were the one that wants to act like Reddit is the only site that hosts hate speech, my point is that every single social media hub in existence has a dark side that rears it's head. Why do so many activists on twitter have to block people? What has twitter done about that?? Not a damn thing. Because they can't. You're clamoring for some utopian safe space where only things you agree with are able to be said. Hell, one look at your post history shows some negative sentiment toward people who are anti-vaccination, what happens when they try to have you banned for hate speech against them??   You can't erase everything you don't like from the internet as if that fixes the problem. Don't be so silly."

And you must have the power to stop somebody or inhibit somebody from doing something, living somewhere, having a job. We don't have the kind of power in America.""  I don't think this is necessarily true. Racism means you think a member of one race is naturally inferior or superior to a member of another race because of his skin color. Racism isn't limited to the powerful, majorities, or rich.   Edit: I paraphrased the quote before, but that wasn't quite right. I fixed it, but left my initial paraphrasing to be fair to people who have already commented under that pretense."
Blackfellas,3d081u,MediocreMatt,6,Sun Jul 12 20:14:42 2015 UTC,That's called prejudice. Racism is systemic.
Blackfellas,3d081u,HonoluluLion,2,Sun Jul 12 20:41:00 2015 UTC,what!? anyone can be racist lol
Blackfellas,3d081u,MediocreMatt,2,Thu Jul 16 05:40:52 2015 UTC,"Would you not say racism is a form of prejudice?  Racism is systemic, absolutely. But even without power, you can surely be racist."
Blackfellas,3d081u,MediocreMatt,2,Sun Jul 12 20:54:18 2015 UTC,"You can have a racist mindset, certainly, but it still points to the party in power. You are interested in maintaining the power structure based on your prejudices. But for someone to BE racist - that is, to exercise or manifest racism, you need to have the power to do so. For instance, the KKK exercised racism because they had the ability to be backed up by the system. I could stand on the corner screaming about how much I hate the Dutch, but having no real power to act on the Dutch, I'm just a hateful, prejudiced bigot. Racism is a system that negatively affects one group in favor of another. A racist mindset is one that believes in, or is a practitioner of, said system. Capitalism / capitalist, Buddhism / buddhist, racism/racist."
Blackfellas,3d081u,_stillz_,4,Sun Jul 12 22:11:49 2015 UTC,"I could stand on the corner screaming about how much I hate the Dutch, but having no real power to act on the Dutch, I'm just a hateful, prejudiced bigot.   You would be racist. No, you wouldn't have just created national institutionalized racism against the dutch like there currently is against black people in America, but you would be racist. Prejudice doesn't require power, and racism is a ""branch"", for lack of a better term, of prejudice.  I had a complaint about the wording by David Banner in this circumstance. Being a minority or not having power in no way diminishes your ability to be racist."
Blackfellas,3d081u,_stillz_,4,Mon Jul 13 00:16:20 2015 UTC,"So, what's wrong with referring to people with racist mindsets as racist? I mean, you can be a socialist without practicing it.  I mean, I'm biased cuz I'm a psychologist lol"
Blackfellas,3d081u,_stillz_,4,Sun Jul 12 22:43:43 2015 UTC,"Ehh my issue with it is the false equivalence part. Someone saying ""gee, white people sure do get on my nerves"" is not the same thing as the person who participates in a system that oppresses an entire race of people. But we use the same word for both of them as though they're equal. It's a vast disservice to the gravity of the larger issue to fling ""racist!"" at every little prejudiced generalization. Racism actually, actively suppresses or seeks to prevent the mobility or success of a people on a systemic level. Saying ""I think Chinese people can't drive"" is not the same."
Blackfellas,3d081u,wafflebread,4,Mon Jul 13 09:00:15 2015 UTC,"While I understand that, that's why we have multiple terms to discuss these problems.  Institutional racism vs racism, oppression vs prejudice.  It just sounds like the definition has been changed not because of solid theoretical or philosophical reasoning, but instead just a reaction to people using it wrong.  It just doesn't seem well thought out.  I mean, in your discussion with the other dude you gave a hypothetical situation of the person on the corner hating dutch people.  You said that person would be a bigot.  So we're in a situation where a person can be a bigot, but not a racist.  It just doesn't seem to make much sense."
Blackfellas,3d081u,wafflebread,4,Mon Jul 13 14:33:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know, perhaps the problem is in defining people as racist. People are prejudiced and bigoted, but racism as a system is not simply about bigotry. So to avoid people conflating the two, terms should be distinctive.  This system is racist. (Deliberate economic and social disparity)  This occurrence is racist. (police profiling)  This person is a bigot. (Donald Trump)  That is a bit more palatable to me, personally. It makes a clear distinction between irrational dislike based on race and actual society-impacting policies and behaviors."
Blackfellas,3d081u,_stillz_,2,Mon Jul 13 20:08:39 2015 UTC,"I don't know, perhaps the problem is in defining people as racist. People are prejudiced and bigoted, but racism as a system is not simply about bigotry. So to avoid people conflating the two, terms should be distinctive.   I understand.  I mean, it's a big part of why I think racism and institutional racism should be separate, but at the end of the day, this argument is just semantic."
Blackfellas,3d081u,wafflebread,2,Tue Jul 14 00:40:55 2015 UTC,"ya, fair enough"
Blackfellas,3d081u,MediocreMatt,3,Tue Jul 14 02:35:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, I fucking hate this axiom that's commonly spouted. Racism has and continues to mean to the vast vast majority of people prejudice based on race. Sociologist have re-defined it within the context of their work and that's ok, different academic fields use utilize words differently than the majority of people. The dumb thing is when these people are trying to force the majority of people to change their previous held definitions to fit in with these sociologist. They act like definition of racism is some math equation and it's now been worked out that racism = prejudice + power when that's not the case. You know what we use to call prejudice+power? Institutional racism.   Everyone is happy to reject linguistic prescription when it comes to things like defending AAVE but suddenly y'all are now prescriptivist when it comes to this? Stop trying to act like your definition is somehow superior. What good does defining racism like that actually achieve? It just seems like a way of being prejudiced to white people then start screaming at an accusations of racism that ""you're not racist because non-whites can't be racist""? Even if we accept your definitions, why are you devaluing prejudice? How is being prejudiced something okay?   sorry for going on a rant, something that has bothered me"
Blackfellas,3d081u,wafflebread,3,Sun Jul 12 22:57:45 2015 UTC,It just seems like a way of being prejudiced to white people    I find it interesting that this bothers you so much

Blackfellas,3d081u,wafflebread,5,Mon Jul 13 00:29:48 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I think it's weird that there is a black person sitting around feeling really upset that people think black people technically can't exert racism..   Everyone is happy to reject linguistic prescription when it comes to things like defending AAVE but suddenly y'all are now prescriptivist when it comes to this?    And this is totally out of left field and I'm giving you major side-eye for this comment"
Blackfellas,3d081u,MediocreMatt,5,Mon Jul 13 00:35:22 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it bothers me too as a social scientist more than anything.  Like, you think it's weird but this is what happens in academia, people debate it all the time.  I know people online seem to think that we're all uniform in our definitions, but this is something that's discussed all the time.  I don't like how people say that ""all social scientists agree that racism is prejudice + power"" when we really don't agree lol.  Like when you say ""technically only people in power can be racist"", that implies that there's some agreed upon technical definition, and that's just not true."
Blackfellas,3d081u,MoreDblRainbows,3,Mon Jul 13 01:50:29 2015 UTC,"Lol, we monoliths now?

Blackfellas,3czegc,cheese93007,21,Sun Jul 12 04:14:28 2015 UTC,"Redditors are techno-libertarians who believe all ideas are created equal, and an ignorant idea is just the same as an informed one.  So, someone can come with an anti-vaccine article, start witch-hunts (doxxing), post 'jailbait', and  defend racism or child porn with 'facts' (and expect it to be entertained everywhere). That is how white privilege works, it  insulates them from the negative consequences of those ideas even when intruding into other spaces. If you don't like it, you're being 'politically correct' or an 'SJW'.   But when you  talk about racism, white privilege, misogyny, then the pseudo-libertarian mask falls off and their white fragility becomes apparent--those are clearly ""race-baiting"" and ""man-hating"". I think our communities  should start exploring other sites; obviously, there is no way this new arrangement will work for smaller or quality subs."

Watching otherwise fruitful conversation devolve into incoherent rambling or memes is celebrated and has even spawned multiple subreddits ( /r/nocontext and /r/evenwithcontext off the top of my head)  Reddit has a cultural problem at this point and removing the ability to delete comments isn't likely to fix that problem.

Many liberals who claim to be allies are just as fucking clueless/ignorant of the reality as actual racists (this includes myself, as the author of the article astutely points out, even if I don't actively participate, I benefit from systemic racism).  They become incredulous at the idea that they might be wrong about something in respect to race because they're liberal.  That means they're the good guys, don't you know?  /s  White liberals are all too eager to speak for the black community, instead of letting them speak for themselves.  It's just another reason to reject labels like ""liberal"" or ""conservative"" because they largely don't say much about the kind of people in each group.

Black people are killing other black people at an alarming rate. I'm not an economist. I'm not an ethnologist. I'm not going to pretend that I understand why it's happening, but it is.

Worked in the media for a long time and I can tell you similar things happen in the country/burbs but are harder to cover when it is a meth lab at the edge of town. When there is shooting 10 blocks from the TV station you get the video of the victims mother/girlfriend/aunt crying with rollers in her hair.

Is that not reminiscent of how Mike Brown was vilified? Eric Garner? Trayvon Martin? It's certainly not the exact same thind, but the jump people are making on Cosby is absolutely in the same spirit as jumps made on the aforementioned.   And what does it matter that comedians have spoken on it? That doesn't make the allegations more or less true. The only folks with the knowledge that matters are Cosby and his accusers.  I think people are losing sight of what is really on the table: a matter of ""he said, they said,"" with no evidence of innocence or wrongdoing. Sure, it's damning that 20+ women are making these allegations, but truth is not borne of numbers. Think of the 70,000+ people who once claimed they saw the sun fall out of the sky; the thousands of folks who claim to have encountered bigfoot, or leprechauns, or satan; and the hundreds of folks who erroneously pointed fingers at the wrong man after the Olympic Park bombing. Think of the thousands who swore a Muslim set the bomb in Oklahoma, and the Reddit hivemind that identified the wrong Boston bomber. Nobody should have their mind made up, because there's no good reason (and no good evidence) to do so, and those who think they have all the info they need are practicing the worst kinf of intellectual dishonesty."

No it is not even in the same ballpark and stop comparing them. And this is a slap in the face of all the women that were raped and molested that try to speak out. And hear people like you speak on the behalf of the rapist. Why aren't trying to speak on  behalf of the women that were raped?  Any time a woman is raped people second, triple and quadruple guess this woman. A 19 year old who was raped by Pill Cosby went to the police station after it happened. Do you know what happened after that? The police officer took her statement and gave it to the D.A, do you know what the D.A did? He seen Pill Cosby's name and buried that matter. What do you suggest this young lady do at that time?   Let me know tell you something which you probably don't know, 1 in 3 young Black ladies in America have been raped/molested. How many of the women you know told you they were raped or molested? Probably not a lot, it's not something that people like to share.   So before you go backing a rapist, know that 2-8% of the times women lie about rape. So that means 92-98% of the time women are telling the truth about it. Ponder on that for a minute."

Blackfellas,3c5tli,Intrinsic_Factors,11,Sun Jul 5 02:30:06 2015 UTC,"The unique intersection of misogyny and racism that black women face. The term was created by Moya Bailey back when she wrote for Crunk Feminist Collective. The first time she used it was here where she describes it as a ""word I made up to describe the particular brand of hatred directed at black women in American visual & popular culture."""
Blackfellas,3c5tli,Alienm00se,8,Sun Jul 5 03:20:12 2015 UTC,Hatred of black women.
Blackfellas,3c5tli,julepie,-8,Sun Jul 5 02:40:21 2015 UTC,"Literally, it is a portmanteau word derived from misogyny (sexism) + noir (black). It is a form of misogyny against black women i.e, racism and sexism from either white culture (institutional) or within black culture itself.  Technically, I think it is a bullshit term that serves no purpose outside of (white) feminism and I cringe when black women use it. For example, when I go to barbershop and the convo suddenly starts throwing shade at black women for no reason, it's better to just call it out as racism rather than sexism... because it is actually a form of (internalized) racism. Calling it racism shuts everybody up quicker than sexism, and allows them to introspect to see they are putting whiteness on a pedestal and using it against black women. Misogyny or misogynoir for some reason is seen as white feminist noise (which it probably is now) and puts people on the defensive."
Blackfellas,3c5tli,julepie,12,Sun Jul 5 02:43:48 2015 UTC,"In that situation, how could it not be both misogyny and racism? I mean yeah, it's a form of internalized racism, but the barber is not just insulting black women because they're black, but also because they're women.  Similarly to how calling out internalized racism begets inspection of the idolization of whiteness, calling out misogyny begets the inspection of negative attitudes toward women. In conjunction as misogynoir, they paint a fuller picture that allows people to be critical and cognizant of specific attacks on black women as apposed to on any other type of women, or on black people as a whole.  I guess I just don't get how calling it racism is effective, but calling it racism and sexism is not. Especially since there is a sexist element that needs to be addressed."
Blackfellas,3c5tli,Alienm00se,-1,Sun Jul 5 07:17:54 2015 UTC,My point is the term misogynoir is often more confusing than not for a very simple concept. Do you think the average person on the street has that level of awareness? I think racism is the bigger component here rather than sexism (since these men don't often apply that particular form of sexism to non-black women). There is a form of racism that is specific to black men but I don't see the point in stamping a label on it.
Blackfellas,3c5tli,Alienm00se,6,Sun Jul 5 12:34:37 2015 UTC,"I personally fail to see how it's complexity is an excuse not to address it. There are plenty of concepts of oppression, privilege, discrimination, ect., that everyday people on the street don't have a firm grasp on, but that doesn't at all mean those things shouldn't be talked about. With that logic we couldn't talk about things like white privilege or Eurocentrism because a lot of white people don't get them. I've never experienced anyone having difficulty understanding the term, but if they do then just discuss the concepts behind it. If they can understand internalized racism, then they can also probably understand that racism and sexism intersect.  I don't know how you're discerning that racism is the bigger component, but even if you're right, sexist elements just don't disappear from the situation. Say that in your example you discuss internalized racism with the barber and they are receptive. They leave the conversation knowing not to treat black women worse than white women. However, by ignoring the sexist components the barber doesn't leave the conversation understanding why they shouldn't be targeting black women at at all, only that they shouldn't be targeting them anymore than they target white women. There is a difference between treating black women well and treating black women as well as white women are treated. The latter still allows sexism and the former does not. Even then, that's just looking a sexism and racism independently. There is a lot more missed by ignoring their intersection.  Your last statement is a false equivalence. I guess you could make the argument that toxic ideals of masculinity work in tandem with anti-blackness to create specific stereotypes for black men, but we don't experience discrimination for our sex on a cultural or institutional level. Also, those toxic ideals come from the hatred of women and not the hatred of men.   If you can't see the difference just look at the black community and draw comparisons between it and society as a whole. Among black people, black men are the most privileged. We don't get targeted by other black people systematically because of our sex like black women do."

Blackfellas,3c5tli,hozac,8,Sun Jul 5 12:37:28 2015 UTC,I don't really think its academic. Ask any black woman some of the things that they've been called or told about themselves that they wouldn't have heard as a black man or asian woman or whatever.

There's no excuse for the type of behavior we saw. I'm not going to engage in this rhetoric about the media purposely trying to make black people look bad, an extremely large group of ignorant people hijacked the demonstrations and used it to loot and riot. I think this is partially because of all the conclusions people try to jump to on social media and get other black people upset. I may get down-voted for this but I just want us to behave civilly, like they did in Charleston, in the face of complete racial hatred. That community came together over that. I saw white people, black people, asian people, mexican people all coming together peacefully to overcome what happened there. That's how we as humans should act.

If you drive the getaway car at a bank robbery, you are just as criminal whether you went into the bank or not.   No no you're right, all 6 participated definitely.

And how is focusing on the black cops or bringing up gang violence not providing an excuse for white violence and racism??   Well, because I'm not talking about white violence or racism at all? I brought up gangs to speak about the rioting and looting we saw. Guess who the majority of the looters and rioters were once the situation spiraled into complete chaos? Gang members.   Is institutional racism throughout police departments nationwide not there because of 3 black cops?    Who the heck said that? I simply said, the final hand in Mr. Grey's death came from a black officer unfortunately (though white officers were involved, and I certainly don't rule out racism in the way they treated Mr. Grey).  What I take from that is, this is also an issue about Police brutality and a culture of violence from police departments which Mr. Ceasar clearly was a part of, doing things like giving nickle rides is unfathomable to me but clearly this is a prevalent and normal thing in many departments."

In a conversation about police brutality (which disproportionately affects minorities), about institutional racism, is it important to point out that a black person was involved?

The fact that the officer involved in the nickle ride is black is absolutely relevant to balance the discussion were having between racism and police brutality.    BECAUSE IT DOESN'T BALANCE THE FUCKING DISCUSSION!! How is that not immediately obvious to you? All the evidence points to minorities being disproportionately policed and arrested, disproportionately the victims of police brutality, disproportionately dying the victims of police killings. 3 black people participating in the perpetuation of institutional racism does not in any way balance the discussion of institutional racism. It actually helps to confirm its existence.  EDIT: I didn't see this part here (likely because of how foolish the preceding sentences were):   Gangs do have a stranglehold on many of our communities influencing our young people to be menaces to society, and that is something I do not want. Do you? Are you saying we should not address gangs? Because that's blaming black people to you or something?   While I don't agree that gangs have a ""stranglehold"" on our communities, I didn't say we shouldn't address gang activity. I said that bringing up perceived issues within the black community detracts from a conversation about racism and police brutality. Besides, it's not like these issues aren't already being addressed and worked on. If that is what you want to focus on, you won't be the only one doing so. But context matters.  There's a reason people (including you it appears) try to reframe and derail the conversation every single time any racialized incident happens. For someone who thinks the thread is about ""Freddie Gray and the Baltimore riots"", it's interesting that you focused exclusively on the riots themselves. Not the larger peaceful protests they were apart of. Not how the Freddie Gray incident fits into the larger picture of police brutality or institutionalized racism (something they even managed to touch on in the podcast you only listened to for 15 minutes). Not how the Baltimore police department has over 5 million in settlements for police brutality in the last 5 years and how that may play into the response to the Freddie Gray incident. Nope, you went straight to gang violence, respectability politics, and incorrectly conflating Charleston and Baltimore."

And why can't we have these so-called dialogues about why they've not worked?

MLK, whom I believe you're speciously trying to reference, knew about understanding the causes of riots when he said: “I think that we’ve got to see that a riot is the language of the unheard. And, what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the economic plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years.” http://time.com/3838515/baltimore-riots-language-unheard-quote/  Obama has also said this before, that riots (like crime) don't just appear out of thin air, unless we want to deny their enabling conditions. Nobody says you should support the riots but, at least, understand where they are coming from.   What resources are you suggesting might be helpful? Maybe you actually are capable of a dialogue, because this would be a good thing to figure out and would help those who have NO WAY OUT of that kind of culture.   Not trying to be rude, but a lot have been written and said already about this that I've come to hate this ""national conversations"" or ""dialogue"" people pretend to want to have. Because almost all the solutions that will work in the short or long term (gun control, ending the war on drugs) have been opposed mostly by the same whites complaining about ""black on black crime."" It happened with busing and it continues today, yet they keep making it sound as if black people are their own enemies (and it seems you've bought the propaganda as well).

Nobody says you should support the riots but, at least, understand where they are coming from.   Idk where you saw the MLK reference I wasn't trying to..and obviously I understand where the riots are coming from. I am black. I realize that police very often treat blacks differently than whites. I realize that many officers are racist, or harbor racist tendencies on the job. I didn't deny or speak against any of that.   But what I'm saying is that I also know Baltimore descended into chaos. When the riots were in full swing it had nothing to do with Freddie Grey. It had nothing to do with black rights. It was literally gang members, thief's, etc taking advantage of the situation. The camera's on the ground and in the air showed this. I am saying I am ashamed that our people who tried to protest peacefully, and fight to have their voice heard, had their platform hijacked by thugs. The idea that were going to try to excuse these thugs destroying the city now is naive to me. They are two entirely different groups of black people. I think it's unfortunate that the thugs were able to broadcast to the world their ignorance and make other people think that all black people are like that, and that makes me angry at the THUGS, and want to get rid of that mentality in our communities, not at the media for taking footage of news.  You should check Obama's quotes on the Baltimore riots, he was not at all ""understanding"" of it. He spoke out against it, he didn't try to excuse it."
Blackfellas,3bweiw,tonybyatt,6,Thu Jul 2 21:01:34 2015 UTC,"Seriously, if you're more concerned about 'thugs' than the aforementioned issues creating the problem (and the lack of media coverage of peaceful protests), then there's little more to say to you.   The thugs didn't 'hijack' the protest, nobody was covering the peaceful protest. Even your fellow coon Morgan Freeman talked about how the media literally waited for the city to burn before we knew there were peaceful protests.    You should check Obama's quotes on the Baltimore riots, he was not at all ""understanding"" of it. He spoke out against it, he didn't try to excuse it.   Maybe you should watch it again and read the white reaction to it. Like I said, name one solution to any black problem since the 60s in America that isn't massively opposed or hasn't yet been reversed by whites? Affirmative Action? Voting Rights? Housing? Employment? Gun control? Black incarceration rates shooting up by 800% after Civil Rights (when the so-called War on Drugs was declared by Reagan) and schools today resegregating to 60s levels are not just a coincidence of American history, it was white racism re-adjusting itself. You should educate yourself first before bringing your whitewashed views and respectability politics here."

Blackfellas,3bweiw,wisesonAC,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:55:38 2015 UTC,you might be clinically retarded. you think white people won't go to war if they were being killed like blacks in america? do you think the riot just happened because one person was killed? blacks are being killed on a scale bigger than 9/11 every year and you're here preaching respectability. riots are a very very small price for our current injustice. go tell that to the palestinians. i think black people have been far too nice compared to whites and it's because of house niggas like you.
Blackfellas,3bweiw,GeneralBuhari,-2,Thu Jul 2 23:34:10 2015 UTC,blacks are being killed on a scale bigger than 9/11 every year and you're here preaching respectability.   What the fuck did I just read.

Didn't know things were so angry in here. It's alright it's just a hive mind subreddit nothing different than I expected though I did expect maybe one or two to side with me though not many people come on this sub anyway. There are free thinking black individuals as well, friends with plenty of them in person so it's ok."

THIS is why white America is not afraid of you worthless sheboons. Any one of you that doesn't ""fall in line"" with the rest of you, they get called a house nigga or Uncle Tom. Please keep killing each other, too. DYLANN ROOF IS A HERO. The only thing he did wrong was not kill more of you big lipped pieces of shit.  You see now hat we have to deal with?

I don't want to see images of black people destroying a city on the news, do you? It's ok to be angry, it's ok to speak out about injustice, but I promise you the most effective way to handle this is with our minds.  Also, I noticed the piece of shit racist said this:   THIS is why white America is not afraid of you worthless sheboons. Any one of you that doesn't ""fall in line"" with the rest of you, they get called a house nigga or Uncle Tom. Please keep killing each other, too.   He's delighted that all of you would cast me out for voicing a different opinion and call me a ""house nigga"" or an ""uncle tom"". He WANTS to see us work against each other. He WANTS to see black people rioting and looting on TV. Why would you give these people that satisfaction?

Blackfellas,3bx5aw,hozac,13,Fri Jul 3 10:34:41 2015 UTC,"Black people used to vote overwhelmingly Republican. We stopped because the Republican party made the conscious decision to shift ideological gears and adopt the Southern Strategy. They made the choice to drop us in favor of appealing to the white, racist, predominantly Southern voting block. Yeah, some Republicans like Rand Paul are saying some nice things about ending the drug war and all that jazz. I'd be impressed if we ever heard such rhetoric from a Republican already in power, not just one that's come sniffing around for black votes during campaign season.  The truth is both parties have continually fucked us over, and neither deserves our loyalty. It's a bit of a conundrum. There's no good reason for any black person to vote Republican at this point, but we get nowhere as long as Dems can do nothing for us and still take our vote for granted. At some point the black vote will have to become ""up for grabs""."
Blackfellas,3bx5aw,ilovethosedogs,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:04:33 2015 UTC,"The party names may have changed, but the same people are voting the ideology. Saying the Dems have done nothing for us is like saying the Republicans today are great because Lincoln founded the party."

Blackfellas,3bx5aw,Explosive_Diaeresis,4,Fri Jul 3 05:42:58 2015 UTC,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again. The GOP should be dominating in terms of the Black vote, if they only truly practiced what they preached.   Most of my family is highly religious, socially conservative, and have a natural mistrust of government. I don't know any single mothers on Welfare. The single mothers I know all work, and go to school, to make their lives better. The ultimate bootstrappers that the GOP fawn over. The nuclear families I know believe in family values, large family gatherings, cousins who take care of each other. A Norman Rockwell wet dream.  Most black people I know believe more in personal responsibility. I never hear, ""that guy is a drug addict because of society."" It's usually the opposite.  I'm a fiscal conservative, I only think we should spend money where it makes sense and cut out the rest. I believe that government controls on economic activity should be minimally as strong to weed out bad actors in the economy.   Every lofty ideal the GOP touts comes with a caveat, it usually comes with ""except if you're Black."" Or worse ""especially if you're Black."""

Blackfellas,3bx5aw,nhuntwalker,2,Fri Jul 3 10:24:11 2015 UTC,"For me it's not even about who may or may not be racist, because let's face it there's racists in both parties. It's the demonstrated lack of concern (and at times open disdain) for black people, as well as the low and middle-class. I don't support their policies; they haven't put forth much that appeals to me as a voter (except the most recent stuff about reforming drug laws). And sitting politicians under that banner openly call for stuff that I oppose so yeah, no."

Blackfellas,3bx5aw,BoBab,3,Thu Jul 2 22:05:04 2015 UTC,"You know your history. The republicans supports black people until the southern agenda/the 50's. Roosevelt was actually quite racist and so was Truman. When republican decided they wanted/needed more southern votes they appealed to the racist. The dems suddenly wanted the ""Negro"" vote. Things haven't changed since. Though, I'm not really sure the dems have our interest at heart. There is a lot of discrimination and racism in dem controlled states. I'm not sure which party cares anymore."
Blackfellas,3bx5aw,ReanimatedCyborg,-1,Fri Jul 3 01:09:03 2015 UTC,"I'm a young voter (first presidential vote was in 2008) and I would certainly give the GOP a chance if the right candidate emerged. I have been intrigued by several candidates running for the Republican Nomination next year and I don't have any reason not to vote for someone I liked, though so far I don't see anyone. I don't presume any given candidate running for 2016 is racist.....I do know that the party's base of voters as a whole itself has some elements of racist attitudes and perceptions in it so that makes me hesitate.

Regardless, here is Dr. Carson's ontheissues page:  http://www.ontheissues.org/Ben_Carson.htm  We can find issues here that we agree or disagree with. For example. I agree with his stance on immigration, the border should be secure. If I found enough issues I was in solidarity with for any Republican candidate, I would vote for them..it seems you're beating around the bush, are you saying no black person should vote for a GOP candidate because you think they're all racist? I don't understand what you mean by you can't imagine why a black person would vote for a GOP candidate?"
Blackfellas,3bx5aw,ReanimatedCyborg,3,Sat Jul 4 04:46:00 2015 UTC,"The GOP specially caters to the white, wealthy elite, not black folks.  Most black people who are republican are generally wealthy, which at least makes some sense.

Blackfellas,3bwp81,neotheb,3,Thu Jul 2 19:45:55 2015 UTC,"Executive Order 9066, signed by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, was issued on the premise that anyone of Japanese descent could not be trusted and was to be treated as an enemy, even those of us who were American citizens, born in this land. We were viewed not as individual people, but as a yellow menace to be dealt with, and harshly. The guns pointed at us at every point reminded us that if we so much as tried to stand up for our dignity, there would be violent consequences. The order and the ensuing confinement was an egregious violation of the Constitution and of due process as we were held, without trial and without charge, awaiting our fate.  To say that the government does not bestow or grant dignity does not mean it cannot succeed in stripping it away through the imposition of unequal laws and deprivation of due process. At the very least, the government must treat all its subjects with equal human dignity. To deny a group the rights and privileges of others, based solely on an immutable characteristic such as race – or as in Obergefell, sexual orientation – is to strip them of human dignity and of the liberty to live as others live.  It seems odd that Justice Thomas, as an African American, would be an opponent of marriage equality. His own current marriage, if he had sought to have it some fifty years ago, would have been illegal under then-existing anti-miscegenation laws. I cannot help but wonder if Justice Thomas would have felt any loss of dignity had the clerk’s office doors been shut in his face, simply because he was of a different race than his fiancée. It is a sad irony that he now enjoys the dignity of his marriage, equal in the eyes of the law to any others, while in the same breath proclaiming that the denial of marriage to LGBTs works no indignity.    nice smack-down. it's sad clarence thomas' own black history of slavery can't even inform his common sense that he needs to borrow one from an interned japanese american."

That you can be a supreme court justice , marry a white woman as a black man, and be opposed to anyone exercising their right to marry whoever they please is something he should be called out for in perpetuity and should be an undetachable part of his ""legacy"".  I can even understand Takei calling Thomas a clown in blackface despite all the shit he's getting for it. That kind of pointed criticism took ""careful consideration"" and the criticism needed to be levied.  Edit - And we won't excuse the other ignorami conservative judges and their faulty rationalizations. They all need to get some."

Since then, mods have kept in contact with admins about this issue...The new harassment policy is the closest anything has been done about the issues addressed in the letter.

Do you realize that much of this sub is people calling out the racist bullshit they see? Your recommendation is useless and not a solution.

Idk though, I'm not a scientist or a sociologist just something I read.   However, what I will say is that 17 years is a long time for something like poverty to still be such a huge issue for minorities is this country. I mean taking the line:    And still I see no changes can't a brother get a little peace  It's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East  Instead of war on poverty they got a war on drugs  So the police can bother me   Its sad to think that time as we perceive is so fast for us to 'grow up' and so slow for society to catch up.

There's been so much research on the sea of benefits these policies have on the american public and workforce, but fuck that if little Billy can't get into the school he wants.  As much as I loathe Clarence Thomas, one of the points of sympathy I've always had for him is the struggle of being a Black academic/professional and having people constantly question whether or not you ""deserve"" to be in your position.  It can be rough at times going through life with that burden and feeling the regular urge prove that you're the smartest motherfucker in the room.  Worse yet can be the support offered by well-intentioned White people who feel the need to complement you on your intelligence or competence.  Ugh, personal baggage for sure, but it sucks."
Blackfellas,3bounb,idredd,3,Wed Jul 1 14:34:02 2015 UTC,"Thankfully, we have people like Sonia Sotomayor who also benefited from AA at Yale (just like Clarence Thomas) but continues to defend its use to combat past and current discrimination. People questioning whether certain minorities 'deserve' a place are speaking not from a concern for meritocracy but from the same racism that would have prevented (qualified) minorities from being there if not for AA.  It's amazing how Thomas rails against AA yet accepted a political position to SCOTUS based mostly on the fact he was a conservative black figure. Obviously, he will reject that conclusion and claim he was selected mostly on merit, but the corollary would be acknowledging AA paid off for him and, therefore, many underrepresented minorities deserve that chance too."

I'm sure that assertion rankles him and contributes to lots of his weird seeming hate of Black Americans.  In many ways I think Thomas benefited more from being ""that negro"" than he really did from AA, but that's definitely not a step up.  As for Sotomayor I totally agree, I mean what would be ideal is a functioning legislature that represents and defends the rights of the population... but in its absence I guess a bit of judicial activism is the best we as a nation can expect and hope for."

You get to go in there and talk shit about ""man shit"".   But honestly, if you put any group of men together, that's what you'll get. I have gay friends and if they came by my house when it was just me and male friends, they are going to feel uncomfortable because they simply can't relate to the topics we will cover.

We were discussing this some yesterday, and it is a worthwhile discussion for the gaming industry to have.  Fantasy in general has long been really shitty on issues of race (with some super-noteworthy examples [see Earthsea]), and this year's shit with the Sick/Sad Puppy fiasco seems to me typical of all of our broader US issues with race and gender lately.  Sad in particular as the sister-genre to Fantasy (Sci-Fi) has always been kind of cutting edge in addressing issues of race, gender, class and other societal cleavages.  The Witcher series (again I fucking love it) slips up on plenty of issues besides race, I mean in many ways brilliant though the game may be it is kind of written for the nerdy young white dude in the same way that sword, sorcery and sexytime stories always have been.  I've had some really colorful conversations with some of my nerdy white female friends about the game as well, I mean it is hard to argue that it isn't a great video game but the Witcher has a shit history regarding sex as well (gotta catch em all pussy trading cards ring a bell?)."

Scalia is a clown and Clarence Thomas is his puppet. It's just unfortunate that Clarence Thomas will never acknowledge the role of racism in introducing arbitrariness into the death penalty etc  as much as he wishes race shouldn't exist (except racism makes 'race' very real). He pretends to be an impartial referee when he was only appointed to oversee a very rigged game. Still the 5-4 split decision gives me hope for the future of the death penalty... its own death being the only death penalty I'll support."

Blackfellas,3bhxmo,agmaster,3,Mon Jun 29 17:22:43 2015 UTC,"The issue I have with the Witcher is that it, like much fantasy sort of buys into the idea that the whole genre is innately European and that thus characters of other skin tones shouldn't exist.  The line between ""fantasy"" and ""historic fiction"" is pretty broad, and if there's monsters, elves, dragons and shit running around I see no reason there can't also be brown folks.  Generally I hear where you're coming from, yeah that's definitely worse.  Oddly the reason the Witcher gets a pass from me is that you can't make a character at all."

Blackfellas,3bfv7s,Mship2,2,Mon Jun 29 11:24:11 2015 UTC,"Because who reads research articles anymore when we have anecdotes to share?   Of course, the neighborhood gap arises in part from voluntary choices. Many Americans, of all races, prefer to live among people who are similar to them, note Mr. Reardon and his colleagues Lindsay Fox and Joseph Townsend. For African-Americans, such a choice often means living in lower-income areas, given the racial disparity in incomes.  But the neighborhood gap is also a reflection of the wealth gap: White families have considerably higher net worth than black families, even after controlling for income, Federal Reserve data shows. A white family making $50,000 is much more likely than a black family to have the savings for a down payment on a house in a middle-class neighborhood.  And some of the wealth gap, in turn, is a result of outright discrimination.  Many of the generous federal housing programs of the 20th century were for whites only — even in the North, as Richard Rothstein of the Economic Policy Institute has detailed. Through the Federal Housing Administration and other agencies, the United States government essentially ran a whites-only wealth creation program. Although this blatant discrimination has largely disappeared into history, it still has a large effect on family wealth, handed down from one generation to the next.  Meanwhile, more subtle discrimination continues. A 2013 study by the Department of Housing and Urban Development found that black home shoppers were often shown fewer options than similar white shoppers.  Taken together, the research shows that neighborhoods matter enormously to a child’s life chances — and play a big role in the nation’s racial inequalities. Some of the gaps will persist as long as the white-black income gap does. But some of the problems are more easily addressed through housing policy."

While running for the Senate, Paul criticized the centerpiece of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 — the part desegregating public accommodations — because it conflicted with his libertarian conception of property rights. And Rand Paul, of course, worked for a presidential candidate in 2012 (his father, Ron Paul) who claimed that the Civil Rights Act “violated the Constitution and reduced individual liberty” and argued that the Civil War was a senseless mistake.   /   ... I don’t think Paul is a “horrible racist,” or even necessarily a deliberate promoter of white supremacy. I believe he really is naive enough to think that racism by private businesses would have ended on its own because it’s a “bad business decision,” or that it’s possible to bail racism out of the criminal justice system with a legislative thimble, but the effect is the same: By failing to recognize racism, let alone a responsibility to fix it, Rand Paul is maintaining white supremacy."

I think ending more overt forms of racism (mass incarceration of black males or the new Jim Crow) is a bigger priority corporations like Apple and Amazon could way in on  and not just their more superficial symbols.

Part of the reason it is that way is that in certain parts of this country it appears everywhere. Belt buckles, bumper stickers, swimsuits, coffee mugs, neckties and yes, mobile games. They put that up to keep us down, it's not a joke or a novelty, and there's no context outside of a textbook where seeing it shouldn't be viscerally offensive to everybody.   Even white people ought to be offended. Think ISIS is bad? I mean the people under that flag set up a rouge state literally next door and killed Americans by the hundreds of thousands, more than ISIS has managed to do. Imagine if people started putting that flag on their tea cozies. Even if you only care about white folks, seeing it ought to piss you off.
