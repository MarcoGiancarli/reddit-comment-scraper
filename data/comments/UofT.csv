There was no application fee,  no GRE requirement, and didn't require recommendation letters. Acceptance is pretty much deterministic in Europe from my experience and you can pretty much know if you'll be accepted before you apply.   I may have had an easier time being accepted as an EU citizen but in general it was a much better experience than applying in Canada or in US."

The schools I applied to in Europe required that I print my application and send it by mail. That was a pain when deadlines were close and I had to pay $80 for express shipping! Keep that in mind when thinking about deadlines. It could take three weeks to arrive by regular mail.   I also had to get some documents notarized such as my high school diploma and my diploma from U of T.   Now that I think of it... I take back my comment about applying to Europe being a better experience! It was tedious gathering all of the documents and printing them out. In US and Canada all documents were submitted online."

Since then we’ve diagnosed the issue and begun working on a fix, which we intend to roll out as soon as possible. This issue was the result of registration changes outside of ACORN.  Unfortunately, affected students will need to repopulate their enrolment cart. This is a significant inconvenience to those people and for that we apologize. The upcoming fix will prevent this issue from affecting any additional students in the future.
