chloegracemoretz,3cr47q,MattAdams53,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:39:16 2015 UTC,What up? There are more sites watching Reddit than we would probably like to admit... There have been a few times where the TV folks for the Cardinals have discussed something that we already noticed on /r/Cardinals. Such the odd feeling.

chloegracemoretz,3bz15w,MattAdams53,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:04:35 2015 UTC,"Well the image you linked is the same size as the picture that Chloë posted on her Instagram. As seen here. As for the one OP posted, they may have screenshotted the picture and cropped it or found a smaller image somewhere else on the internet that was posted at that size, possibly tumblr."
chloegracemoretz,3bz15w,MrMorlonelycat,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:58:32 2015 UTC,I figured it out right as I was going offline. Evidently instagram is uploading larger size images in the newest version of the app. I figured it out after seeing /r/Instagram had a post on the subject. It just freaked me out for a second.

chloegracemoretz,3b2wle,MrMorlonelycat,11,Thu Jun 25 18:56:34 2015 UTC,Glad it's a clip-on...not a fan of septum piercings :S

chloegracemoretz,3b2wle,absoluteolly,5,Fri Jun 26 13:48:59 2015 UTC,I'm not a big fan of piercings and girls who are heavily tatted but I agree Chloe's taking way too much shit right now. It's not like she's skinning puppies and eating babies. She's young and clearly experimenting with life. That's what you're supposed to when you're 18. Let her live and enjoy herself. And even though I'm not a huge fan of piercings and the tats she still looks breathtaking. She is one gorgeous young woman.

chloegracemoretz,3alhdq,UndercoverOfTheNight,-11,Sun Jun 21 17:29:04 2015 UTC,I'm hoping she doesn't overdo it. A few tats aren't an issue but one of the most unappealing things in the world to me is a beautiful girl covered in them.
chloegracemoretz,3alhdq,prehensile-penis,9,Sun Jun 21 17:22:38 2015 UTC,Thankfully she doesn't give a shit what you think!
chloegracemoretz,3alhdq,johnthered,-2,Sun Jun 21 12:50:54 2015 UTC,Never said she did or that she should. I still think she's gorgeous. Piercings and tats just aren't my thing is all.

chloegracemoretz,3a5cnh,MattAdams53,0,Wed Jun 17 10:25:50 2015 UTC,Can't tell if she's wearing the nose ring or not. Didn't look like she was in the press photos earlier in the week for Fifth Wave.

chloegracemoretz,39vizp,bwump,8,Mon Jun 15 17:54:47 2015 UTC,I hope
chloegracemoretz,39vizp,JuanRiveara,7,Mon Jun 15 22:02:52 2015 UTC,"As far as I can tell, nothing has been confirmed."
chloegracemoretz,39vizp,OtherAlt18,2,Mon Jun 15 06:54:17 2015 UTC,"As long as she can do a more adult sounding voice, I guess it's possible. It would be weird if she sounded almost exactly like she did in Dishonored.  She was talking recently about Dishonored in a Korean interview, so who knows."
chloegracemoretz,39n5zb,cizzlewizzle,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:53:45 2015 UTC,This pic reminds me of Emilia Clark as Daeneyrs Targaryen.

chloegracemoretz,398iy9,MattAdams53,2,Wed Jun 10 00:53:33 2015 UTC,/r/LeaMichele in the thumbnail. Bah. I honestly couldn't have called it without checking.
chloegracemoretz,398iy9,MangoTangoFox,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:58:57 2015 UTC,"Reese Witherspoon should win that category. Theory, Still Alice, and Wild were all excellent, even though the later two did frustrate me a bit. I'd say in overall satisfaction it's a tossup between Still Alice and Theory, but acting quality of the person in question would be Wild>Theory>Alice. An infinitely better choice for this category would have been Alicia Vikander of Ex Machina. But apparently teens can't have nudity, but they can have tons of violence in games and movies, and they can listen to vulgar (and often sexist/pro-drug) music."
chloegracemoretz,392hbe,CJ105,3,Mon Jun 8 19:49:36 2015 UTC,I love her as a brunette.
chloegracemoretz,392hbe,MrMorlonelycat,2,Tue Jun 9 01:33:38 2015 UTC,It definitely works for her. She looked great in If I Stay and that was with a wig.
chloegracemoretz,391ijc,HappyGoUnlucky,11,Mon Jun 8 15:55:16 2015 UTC,"I think Chloe's so naturally beautiful that she doesn't need to be heavily made up. Still, no denying how gorgeous she is here."

chloegracemoretz,37ls3o,RazzleDazzle93,3,Thu May 28 15:34:41 2015 UTC,so beautiful
chloegracemoretz,37ls3o,obibigblack,6,Thu May 28 17:47:54 2015 UTC,Jesus.
chloegracemoretz,37ls3o,cor0094,9,Thu May 28 18:40:02 2015 UTC,Naturally breathtaking.
chloegracemoretz,37ls3o,UndercoverOfTheNight,5,Thu May 28 20:36:14 2015 UTC,It seems natural for her to be insanely beautiful
chloegracemoretz,37ks7b,aomiep,5,Thu May 28 10:25:32 2015 UTC,"I accidentally reposted this without realizing you already posted it so sorry about that.  Here is a higher quality version, plus two more. :)"
chloegracemoretz,37gknw,AaKkisa,1 point,Wed May 27 13:56:14 2015 UTC,Too beautiful

chloegracemoretz,379awg,NormThaPenguine,6,Tue May 26 03:56:35 2015 UTC,Music video
chloegracemoretz,379awg,MattAdams53,6,Tue May 26 03:37:36 2015 UTC,This would be heaven
chloegracemoretz,371xc1,cizzlewizzle,1 point,Sun May 24 02:33:11 2015 UTC,"Hahah, her facial expressions"
chloegracemoretz,370e1e,aomiep,2,Sat May 23 18:17:59 2015 UTC,That third picture tho?
chloegracemoretz,370e1e,DumbStuff88,1 point,Sat May 23 22:27:11 2015 UTC,Her upper lip looks thicker.
chloegracemoretz,370e1e,mclovynn,0,Tue May 26 07:01:18 2015 UTC,"Is it me, or does the big jacket look not great on her?"
chloegracemoretz,370e1e,CoxyMcChunk,5,Sat May 23 19:25:17 2015 UTC,Its you.   Shes made a lot of questionable fashion choices but this hardly seems to qualify.
chloegracemoretz,370e1e,stfu_,0,Sat May 23 21:30:33 2015 UTC,"Aight, there's just something off about these pictures. Idk, maybe Korea doesn't look good on her or something."
chloegracemoretz,370e1e,CoxyMcChunk,-5,Sat May 23 22:23:05 2015 UTC,Is she supposed to be on some interview and plan to poison the leader?
chloegracemoretz,373598,coreanavenger,1 point,Sun May 24 12:51:56 2015 UTC,Anywhere to get this translated to English?
chloegracemoretz,373598,UndercoverOfTheNight,1 point,Sun May 24 22:01:08 2015 UTC,"Not that I know of yet but Chloe's replies should clue you in. The first set of questions are: Do you know kimchi? Do you know Gangnam Style? Do you know Psy? Then he tells her she needs to answer confidently. The next are how she should eat, and dance. The old lady is just shouting expletives at her and Chloe swears back at her."
chloegracemoretz,373598,UndercoverOfTheNight,1 point,Mon May 25 03:15:59 2015 UTC,Were they not happy with how she was dancing? I liked that part a lot :)
chloegracemoretz,36z737,MattAdams53,5,Sat May 23 10:55:08 2015 UTC,"I must have missed something. Why did Chloë go to Seoul? Was it a press tour for a movie, or was it a ""I have never been to Korea and they offered to have us on, so let's go"" deal?  Oh, and source"
chloegracemoretz,36vxv5,yehlrigyeh,7,Fri May 22 15:33:00 2015 UTC,Her expressions...   Edit: I just remembered my album
chloegracemoretz,36vxv5,MattAdams53,1 point,Fri May 22 17:08:28 2015 UTC,Good stuff
chloegracemoretz,36vxv5,UndercoverOfTheNight,3,Fri May 22 18:26:24 2015 UTC,Didn't know Korea have their own SNL show that's  cool
chloegracemoretz,36t8iu,CJ105,1 point,Thu May 21 22:52:17 2015 UTC,I think I'm seeing double Chloë... and I think I like it.
chloegracemoretz,36shy5,CJ105,6,Thu May 21 19:37:20 2015 UTC,Slightly larger version.
chloegracemoretz,36tdtu,btr781,2,Thu May 21 23:34:50 2015 UTC,Don't let tumblr see this. They'll lose their shit.

chloegracemoretz,36q925,MrMorlonelycat,3,Thu May 21 19:01:38 2015 UTC,Traditional clothing
chloegracemoretz,36q925,UndercoverOfTheNight,1 point,Thu May 21 15:57:20 2015 UTC,She looks really tired in a lot of these pictures. The flight to Korea must've taken a lot out of her.
chloegracemoretz,36ozqi,cizzlewizzle,11,Thu May 21 00:00:28 2015 UTC,I think this is my favorite one from the album.
chloegracemoretz,36ozqi,MrMorlonelycat,3,Thu May 21 03:20:21 2015 UTC,Yes! My thoughts exactly! She looks gorgeous...
chloegracemoretz,36ozqi,bloody_william,2,Thu May 21 05:29:01 2015 UTC,God she's gorgeous
chloegracemoretz,36ozqi,UndercoverOfTheNight,4,Thu May 21 15:09:55 2015 UTC,I was thinking Trevor wasn't there until I saw the giant on the right side of the last photo and his guiding hand.
chloegracemoretz,36ozqi,Pallas-Athena,1 point,Thu May 21 00:42:23 2015 UTC,Trevor is ALWAYS with Chloe
chloegracemoretz,36ozqi,Tokyoto_,3,Thu May 21 06:14:58 2015 UTC,Dat jumpsuit though.
chloegracemoretz,36ozqi,MattAdams53,1 point,Thu May 21 00:14:28 2015 UTC,An homage to MASH I'm guessing 😷
chloegracemoretz,36ozqi,MattAdams53,1 point,Thu May 21 00:39:13 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I like it, but it's quite the departure from her norm"

chloegracemoretz,36ozqi,mattoftheD,2,Thu May 21 00:13:13 2015 UTC,Thx.  Stubborn me found it on Google eventually.
chloegracemoretz,36ozqi,Bleafer,-1,Thu May 21 00:35:25 2015 UTC,It's probably the most common question over at /r/Cardinals other than the big red text. Reddit syntax can get confusing
chloegracemoretz,36mtlf,AaKkisa,2,Wed May 20 15:16:47 2015 UTC,"Man, that's a loud dress."
chloegracemoretz,36mtlf,MattAdams53,2,Wed May 20 23:23:38 2015 UTC,What?
chloegracemoretz,36mtlf,seat_filler,6,Thu May 21 01:25:56 2015 UTC,Exactly...
chloegracemoretz,36i7ls,TheGingerLow,2,Tue May 19 16:03:02 2015 UTC,That's not an engagement ring is it?
chloegracemoretz,36i7ls,that_creepy_neighbor,2,Tue May 19 18:13:37 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it's not. She's been wearing a ring on her wedding finger for quite awhile now. Maybe it's a promise ring of some kind from a boyfriend we don't know about but I think it might just be a ring with no value besides that. I see single girls with rings on their wedding fingers all the time.
chloegracemoretz,36i7ls,UndercoverOfTheNight,1 point,Tue May 19 21:50:00 2015 UTC,Today I believe.
chloegracemoretz,36gqs0,JFN1234,3,Tue May 19 07:03:18 2015 UTC,I see an Oscar in the near future for her. Unless she gets the DiCaprio treatment. Which I hope not.
chloegracemoretz,3693ls,MattAdams53,2,Sun May 17 10:56:00 2015 UTC,Hmmm... That title looks like one Gfycat would make
chloegracemoretz,3693ls,dabisnit,3,Sun May 17 17:35:52 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I was thinking
chloegracemoretz,3693ls,1Daniel66,1 point,Sun May 17 18:12:49 2015 UTC,Peacock
chloegracemoretz,3673f5,aomiep,10,Sat May 16 20:16:16 2015 UTC,My God she's beautiful
chloegracemoretz,3673f5,UndercoverOfTheNight,2,Sat May 16 21:22:57 2015 UTC,"I'll take this as a challenge and stare back at hers. She'll win obviously, but still :)."
chloegracemoretz,3673f5,MrMorlonelycat,2,Sat May 16 22:07:16 2015 UTC,Everyone wants to take that challenge :)
chloegracemoretz,35zaik,MrMorlonelycat,11,Thu May 14 19:41:52 2015 UTC,"Wow. I'm loving the cornrows, though. They look really good on her."
chloegracemoretz,35zaik,TheTornJester,1 point,Thu May 14 23:09:38 2015 UTC,Amazing!!!
chloegracemoretz,35yg34,AaKkisa,2,Thu May 14 15:45:34 2015 UTC,Is that the chick from Kickass?
chloegracemoretz,35yg34,kitch99,5,Thu May 14 22:30:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it is."

chloegracemoretz,35pw0b,AaKkisa,12,Tue May 12 15:15:35 2015 UTC,"This is from Azzaro Store Launch and Lucy In Disguise Party, in London. Here's an album of the event."
