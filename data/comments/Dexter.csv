Dexter,3e4ipd,Lyude,3,Wed Jul 22 01:25:45 2015 UTC,WARNING: SPOILER BELOW  Best part of the show
Dexter,3e34mn,Derkanus,3,Tue Jul 21 16:23:03 2015 UTC,"Seems like every iteration of Dexter's creative team/writer NEVER FUCKING UNDERSTANDS THAT DEXTER SHOULD BE OUTED AS A SERIAL KILLER TO THE WHOLE WORLD, AS BOTH THE BOOK AND THE SHOW FLIRTED WITH THAT IDEA FOR MANY SEASONS AND IT NEVER CAME TO FRUITION. Well, except for Clyde Phillips but unfortunately he left and Scott ""I must have memory loss"" Buck took over and ruined the show.  And yes, it says right above that it was revealed Dexter was a murderer... of 2 people. Not the 100 or so he's killed in the books. God damn it."
Dexter,3e34mn,Erekt__Butthole,2,Wed Jul 22 01:39:06 2015 UTC,"Seems like every iteration of Dexter's creative team/writer NEVER FUCKING UNDERSTANDS THAT DEXTER SHOULD BE OUTED AS A SERIAL KILLER TO THE WHOLE WORLD...except for Clyde Phillips...   Which is such a fucking tragedy. Phillips took Lindsay's original idea for the character of Dexter and really ran with it and improved on it in so many ways; I have no doubt that his ending would have been the best one. I wish Clyde would write a full book with his own ending so Dexter could finally get the send off he deserves!   [REDACTED] took over and ruined the show.   Let's just leave his name out of this post, please. Just joking...kind of.  :)"
Dexter,3e34mn,Erekt__Butthole,2,Wed Jul 22 02:12:12 2015 UTC,"It really is. If I could go back in time, I'd find Clyde Phillips and force him to watch Season 8.  There's no way he'd leave the show then. No way.  What really annoys me is that he left for personal reasons. He literally breathed life into one of the biggest cult characters ever, he only needed to stay on for two more seasons, max. I think it was poor of him to leave like that. They write the seasons over about 4 months, so it's not even two years.   Clyde obviously had no idea that without him (and Rosenberg and a few of the other writers that left) the show ceased at being the show. He had no idea what it would become. BUT TWO GOD DAMN MORE SEASONS WHY CLYDE  Buuuut, Showtime didn't let the writing staff kill Dexter, which makes me think that Clyde's ending would have been turned down. Which makes me think the show was always doomed. Which makes me think that Clyde knew this and got out of dodge. Which makes me think fuck you Showtime. If you can't kill Dexter, you can't reveal who he is to everyone, thus ruining everything Clyde would have done."
Dexter,3e34mn,Erekt__Butthole,2,Wed Jul 22 02:26:18 2015 UTC,"I'm officially and publicly naming you the Conservator of the Clyde Phillips Dexter Mythology (COTCPDM for short) and it is your civic duty and honor to go back in time with the season 8 DVD to stop Clyde from exiting the show. Now, this position does not require you to invent time-travel or anything so extreme (though it is encouraged); it is merely your job to deliver the DVD upon its discovery.  We all thank you for your service!  Edit: Also, save Hannibal from cancellation while you're back there in the past."
Dexter,3e34mn,Erekt__Butthole,2,Wed Jul 22 02:33:42 2015 UTC,"Fucking Hannibal. It cost NBC $185,000 to make per episode and they still didn't fucking renew it. It's their best show and critically acclaimed.   If I could go back in time, I'd get Clyde to stay on without a doubt. Or, I would get Dexter on HBO from the start. Anything to get that final, adrenaline-filled, cat and mouse final season.  Whenever a small network gets their standout show, they cling onto it forever until it dies a horrible death. That's why I'm worried about Mr. Robot on USA.  If Clyde still says no, I'll send Scott Buck to space and hire Vince Gilligan. Imagine if Buck and Gilligan worked together.  Buck: ""So... I was thinking we could end it with Dexter becoming a lumberjack after Deb is killed offscreen by a bloodclot and dumped into the ocean right before Dexter drives into a hurricane.""  Gilligan: ""You're fired."""
Dexter,3e34mn,Erekt__Butthole,2,Wed Jul 22 02:37:42 2015 UTC,"[Hannibal]'s their best show and critically acclaimed. I would get Dexter on HBO from the start. If Clyde still says no, I'll send Scott Buck to space and hire Vince Gilligan.   Erekt__Butthole. Derkanus. Both ass references. Clearly we are meant to be together. I will leave my wife and run away with you through all of time and space, my friend. You can be The Doctor and I your trusty companion. Just kidding, again."
Dexter,3e34mn,dejious,2,Wed Jul 22 02:48:02 2015 UTC,"Ha, that's funny. Definitely likeminded about television.  I'm assuming you only watch S1-4 of the show too?"
Dexter,3e34mn,dejious,2,Wed Jul 22 02:51:24 2015 UTC,I'm assuming you only watch S1-4 of the show too?    Of Doctor Who? No actually; I only started watching when Matt Smith came on board (though I subsequently went back and watched the older seasons).
Dexter,3e34mn,TheREALchadizzy1,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:10:20 2015 UTC,"No no, Dexter. Should've made that clearer."
Dexter,3e34mn,hitler--,2,Wed Jul 22 03:31:22 2015 UTC,"I was going to open up a discussion but you beat me to it. With that said, I agree with almost all points here. There were even some points where i forgot i was reading a Dexter book. There were 2 very enjoyable parts: Dexyer and Brian sharing a victim, and the Deb/Brian family reunion chapter. Wasn't the ideal end I was hoping for, but definitely significantly better than the lumberjack ending. I too was hoping for a bit of a reveal to the public of who Dexter actually was. There wasnt really any involvement of any other characters besides Deb, Brian, and Dex (except Masuka/Masoko). Although none of the other characters really ever had big roles in the book.   To defend both versions of the story, there really hasn't been a story quite like the Dexter story before, and I assume it would be difficult to end it in a way that satisfies the viewer/reader. I found myself rooting for Dexter toward the end, although the title of the book gave it away. Perhaps I would have been more satisfied if it weren't advertised that Dexter was going to die. I still enjoyed the read, but there could have been way more. Both dropped the ball in my opinion, however the TV show dropped it way harder, damn near hurled it to the ground."
Dexter,3e34mn,hitler--,2,Tue Jul 21 23:33:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for chiming in!   There were 2 very enjoyable parts: Dexter and Brian sharing a victim, and the Deb/Brian family reunion chapter.   Agreed. In both the later books and TV seasons, Dexter hardly does any killing, so it was a nice return to form when Dex and Brian teamed up. I also really enjoyed Brian's mad scientist laboratory with all his torture implements; it was neat to see how Dexter could have turned out with The Code. (I found that the actual torturing made my skin crawl a little bit too.) And getting Debs and Brian back together was certainly fun too.   There wasnt really any involvement of any other characters besides Deb, Brian, and Dex (except Masuka/Masoko).   This was probably the biggest letdown for me. It felt really unbelievable that Cpt. Mathews would completely and utterly throw Dexter under the bus like this, and that Batista was hardly even mentioned (this is probably just their TV relationships with Dexter bleeding through though--like you said, they're not the same people in the books).  Disregarding the show characters though, I really expected Deb's babydaddy, Kyle Chutsky, to swoop in for the save at some point near the end when shit started to hit the fan. Also, I thought for sure that Doakes would show up to put the final nail in Dexter's coffin--a missed opportunity in my mind. Why keep him around to hound Dex throughout all of the books, and then he never even shows up in the finale? What the fuck?   I found myself rooting for Dexter toward the end, although the title of the book gave it away.   I went the other way with it myself: I thought for sure the title was a red herring, and we were going to get an ending where it seemed like Dexter was dead, but then it would turn out to be Brian's body with the face cut off (similar DNA) or some kind of twist. When I read the actual ending I literally thought I was missing pages or something (I was reading the epub version). I was disappointed, to say the least. It was kind of touching to see Dexter level up his humanity a bit by saving his kids at the end, but the ""big bad"" of the story, Raul, was worse than any antagonist in any season of the show."
Dexter,3e34mn,dejious,2,Wed Jul 22 00:15:06 2015 UTC,"I was mainly pulling for Dexter to survive so there would be a different sort of death. I was hoping for a big reveal of his actual crimes, but as it neared closer and closer to the end, I knew it wasn't happening.   I actually completely forgot that Chutsky was alive, I thought he died, it's been a while since he was used. I remember now that he left Debs because he felt he couldn't be the man she needed him to be. This would have been a nice addition to the story they should have done."
Dexter,3e34mn,hitler--,0,Wed Jul 22 01:11:07 2015 UTC,Definitely an interesting ending.
Dexter,3e34mn,dejious,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:36:26 2015 UTC,I literally posted the ending right in the plot summary above.
Dexter,3e1dyf,zravenette,10,Tue Jul 21 05:20:15 2015 UTC,This is when I start to wonder about some people.    I get mad because it's shitty writing - a character with unfounded motives serves as a plot device.  Some of you people get mad because a fictional 10 year-old girl acts like a bitch and you talk like you want to slap her.  I often wonder if some of you have blurred the line between entertainment and reality.
Dexter,3e1dyf,elmarko44,4,Tue Jul 21 06:09:14 2015 UTC,"Yep, this is exactly right.  The new writers and writing direction was shit and that's the reason for Astor's behaviour. She's simply the writer's easy way out of removing the kids from the story, which wasn't the best idea."
Dexter,3e1dyf,Erekt__Butthole,2,Tue Jul 21 06:41:11 2015 UTC,Season 5 had a different showrunner. A lot of the characters were written differently and he probably wanted to focus on Dexter and Harrison. It wasn't because Astor wanted to leave it was just bad writing (you'll notice a decline as you go up seasons).
Dexter,3dxbnx,swagzaphone,13,Mon Jul 20 08:41:03 2015 UTC,"The answer is the latter of what you said.   And it wasn't them getting lazy, 80% of the writing team changed after Season 4."
Dexter,3dxbnx,Erekt__Butthole,2,Mon Jul 20 09:08:45 2015 UTC,"Yah, I was mostly just fucking around with the post"
Dexter,3dw0ky,cRavenx,19,Mon Jul 20 00:18:01 2015 UTC,"I agree completely,the books were awful after the first two. However a lot of people here seem to think magic demons are less dumb than being a lumber jack, so what do I know?"
Dexter,3dw0ky,JustBigChillin,5,Mon Jul 20 00:48:02 2015 UTC,At least lumberjacks exist making it something that (even though it is really stupid) could technically happen. I was thinking about reading the books until I saw this thread.
Dexter,3dw0ky,Derkanus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:01:54 2015 UTC,"The books other than Dexter in the Dark are more akin to what the show was like; each one centers around a serial killer and Dexter is trying to catch them himself. I'd at least recommend the first 2 books; book 1 is basically season 1 of the show, and book 2 is super twisted: the killer cuts off his victims' arms, legs, noses, ears, eyelids, etc., all while keeping them alive. It's really quite disturbing."
Dexter,3dw0ky,JustBigChillin,2,Mon Jul 20 18:50:45 2015 UTC,I might check those out then. Thanks
Dexter,3dw0ky,sigilvii,12,Mon Jul 20 19:02:48 2015 UTC,Holy shit I'm glad I read this spoiler.
Dexter,3dw0ky,Erekt__Butthole,10,Mon Jul 20 01:13:44 2015 UTC,"Book 4 and book 5 are much better in my opinion. I'm on book 6 at the moment.  I can live with book 3 because Dexter was still very enjoyable to read and flat out hilarious most of the time. But yeah, I went in expecting some crappy Moloch God thing so my expectations were lowered.  The whole story of book 3 is never mentioned again in the series by the way."
Dexter,3dw0ky,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:12:34 2015 UTC,Seriously? Never mentioned again? Jeff Lindsay must have realized how awful it was and decided to pretend it never happened. (Which is what I'm trying to do)
Dexter,3dw0ky,carbonhuman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:05:17 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, he's said multiple times it was a mistake."
Dexter,3dw0ky,mhkehoe,4,Mon Jul 20 21:54:27 2015 UTC,"He openly said that book was a mistake. His publishers and people wanted him to try something different, and he hated it. So take that book out of the series, and it all goes back to normal. No more magic."
Dexter,3dw0ky,Apostle_1882,2,Mon Jul 20 12:46:43 2015 UTC,Ah ok. At least he admits it. And didn't try to add any vampires to go with the demons.
Dexter,3dw0ky,bloodbuzzz,4,Mon Jul 20 18:06:26 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. And I am totally fine with fantasy elements in books, I have read the A Song of Ice and Fire series multiple times. But if you have fantasy elements, you have to layout early on how these elements work within your world.  I don't recall the last Dexter book I read, but they do get better after that one. I just cringe anytime he mentions the demon god thing and try to forget it was said."
Dexter,3dw0ky,Derkanus,2,Mon Jul 20 02:17:12 2015 UTC,"Am I right in thinking the first book is pretty much season 1, but do the stories then separate between TV and literature? I miss Dexter, I'm not a big reader but I will borrow these from the library if they're new stories."
Dexter,3dw0ky,iTrollYhu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:06:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's basically how it is. The books keep a lighter/funnier vibe than the show through most of them as well, which I liked. They're definitely worth checking out."
Dexter,3dw0ky,poopfeast,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:07:18 2015 UTC,"Book 1 is basically the plot for season 1 of the show, but the end of book diverges quite a bit from how season 1 of the show ends.  The books are definitely worth checking out if you're interested. The only problem is there is so much padding in them; like it will take 2 full pages to say ""Dexter waited outside the house"" because Lindsay has to talk about how the moonlight is shining radiantly, and the Dark Passenger is coiled to attack, and the victim is waiting inside unknowingly, and Dexter is so smart and sneaky, and blah blah blah. You can read the books in like 2 days if you skip all the flowery bullshit and just read the important parts."
Dexter,3dw0ky,nuggetinabuiscuit,2,Mon Jul 20 18:57:19 2015 UTC,"Boy, I'm glad I didn't decide to read the books."
Dexter,3dw0ky,DamnitTrevor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:38:29 2015 UTC,"Just started reading this book last night. Going to continue with it, but take it with a grain of salt. I've enjoyed the first 2 books and apparently there is no mention of this after the third book."
Dexter,3dw0ky,dejious,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:42:11 2015 UTC,"Wait, what happened here? can someone give me a rundown of what happens in this book?"
Dexter,3dw0ky,Derkanus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:47:45 2015 UTC,"That was just an experiment, the books after are still really great."
Dexter,3dw0ky,Derkanus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:26:56 2015 UTC,"Yea, they dropped all mention of this in the books following it. It was a terrible novel, ruined the whole born in blood concept. I vaugely remember Jeff Lindsay acknowledging it was a mistake in an AMA. They get progressively better after it. Double Dexter is good, Dexter final cut is also good, and I just finished the final book. Not an amazing ending, but significantly better than lumberdex."
Dexter,3dwnc7,HarlanCedeno,12,Mon Jul 20 03:44:56 2015 UTC,"The show accomplished so much in its four seasons. I'm truly glad that Season 4 has a strong enough ending that it can be considered an ending, for some of us, and also because it's one of the greatest endings to a season ever. Nothing has ever shocked audiences like that. I don't even think The Sopranos, The Wire or Breaking Bad had any scenes as jawdropping as Dexter coming home to find Rita.   I'm sad that the show never got its climactic final season with Dexter being on the run but there is still so much magic in those first four seasons, enough that it's basically it's own show, with AT LEAST a full circle ending. It's better than the real ending too.   TLDR; S1-4 is brilliant."
Dexter,3dwnc7,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:47:17 2015 UTC,"Ha, I never thought of it that way.  Just pretend that the season 4 finale was the actual end of the show.  I like that idea, it would leave it very open ended, and at least you could be sure that Dexter would suffer for what happened to Rita."
Dexter,3dwnc7,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:10:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's that open ended honestly. Trinity's dead, so is Rita. Dexter's son is born in blood. He now has to accept fate. End of series."
Dexter,3dwnc7,Erekt__Butthole,3,Tue Jul 21 08:01:06 2015 UTC,"Right, but it still leaves off questions that were ultimately answered such as:  Does he ever get caught? Does Debra find out?"
Dexter,3dwnc7,red2020,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:01:39 2015 UTC,"The answer is yes to both of them, if Clyde Phillips stayed on and made Season 5 or Season 6 the final season. Just take a look at his proposed ending and what he said about the Deb finding out plot point. ""It would have been great fun to write."" Something like that.  If you can look at Dexter as a Shakespearen story, it ends there. And at heart, Dexter is a show about emotions. If you see it as born in blood, and Dexter ""gets what he deserves"" for being careless, then that's the end.  But yeah, we all wanted a final season of everyone finding out who he is. But it will never happen.  Life doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to be... lived."" Way too fucking ironic that that line is from the final few minutes of the S4 finale."
Dexter,3dw4pp,DawnoftheSuarez,5,Mon Jul 20 00:55:34 2015 UTC,i always thought quinn was gonna be doakes 2.0 because he would find something out about dexter and actually he came pretty fuckin close when that liddy guy or whatever was spying on dexter then dexter killed him and blood got on quinns boot
Dexter,3dw4pp,notmyrealname34,4,Mon Jul 20 06:51:06 2015 UTC,"I don't remember if he was around someone said ""Find the person Liddy was looking for and you find our killer"". But regardless, he probably put the whole thing behind him"
Dexter,3dw4pp,PrivateBlue,2,Mon Jul 20 05:03:55 2015 UTC,"He came close to knowing but then he told Liddy to ""back off"" Dexter, doing so himself. This was because Debra found out about it and he wanted to make it right. Even though he could´ve had some suspicions he didn´t try to investigate again because he wanted Debra."
Dexter,3du684,vulgarswamiyako,15,Sun Jul 19 14:36:51 2015 UTC,"I think the show is mostly about how Dexter develops during the seasons. Harry always said to Dexter that he is special and a psychopath so Dexter never tried to find out who he is and if he could have feelings. In the first seasons he didnt show very much feelings, but in the following seasons he admitted himself that he isnt a insensitive monster. And I think I can remember a scene where Dexter shows feels and Harry comment ""I didnt know you are able to stuff like that"".. what do you think about this subject?"
Dexter,3du684,Shudder951,4,Sun Jul 19 15:03:14 2015 UTC,Well psychopaths/sociopaths can still feel emotions. Maybe his are just more shallow and he only feels them sometimes usually from big events.
Dexter,3du684,BlindStark,12,Sun Jul 19 21:10:08 2015 UTC,"I WISH they had made the show a nature vs nurture show.  Harry was focused on the nurture,  how Dexter's experience meant he HAD to be a psychopath. I would like for the show to have slowly unraveled the fact that Dexter was NOT a psychopath,  that he had feelings and could have lived a normal life.  Harry had made a HUGE mistake in teaching him and giving him the code."
Dexter,3du684,mongd66,7,Sun Jul 19 16:17:15 2015 UTC,seriously. as much as I love the show it would be so much better if they had done it this way. I thought that's what season 8 would be about but they ruined it. writing like that would put this show on the same level as breaking bad or mad men
Dexter,3du684,scofieldslays,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:18:35 2015 UTC,Agreed. They were so close. It absolutely had the potential to be that caliber of a show but they fucked it up.
Dexter,3du684,TheButtiestMan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:43:04 2015 UTC,"Looking back at it now, I think Harry was the real monster & not Dexter!"
Dexter,3du684,spacecadet2023,4,Sun Jul 19 23:47:46 2015 UTC,"That would have been an excellent direction to take the last season... you could even keep Vogel,  demonstrate that SHE manipulated Harry,  SHE had her own pathology of turning normals into serial killers without the psycopathology"
Dexter,3du684,mongd66,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:38:53 2015 UTC,I think it was really a combination of the stuff Vogel and Harry said to Dexter that made him worse than what he would have been if they didn't tell him what he should be and what he is without letting him find out a bit about himself first.
Dexter,3du6k0,Taronyuuu,3,Sun Jul 19 14:40:25 2015 UTC,"I had no problem with the show's ending in terms of Deb and Dexter. I just didn't like the plot events leading up to it or the Hannah/Oliver/Dr Lady dynamic. Should have left Hannah in season 7 and made season 8 about the investigation of LaGuerta's death.  Have Deb get arrested and given the death penalty for that, and then Dexter exiles himself afterwards."
Dexter,3du6k0,Pointwest418,2,Sun Jul 19 16:37:17 2015 UTC,"The final Dexter book was recently released, untitled ""Dexter is Dead"". I haven't read it so I'm not sure exactly how it ends but I'm assuming Dexter doesn't make it out alive. I'm sure it's a much better ending than season 8! (Though almost anything would be ......)"
Dexter,3du6k0,ik1020,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:56:57 2015 UTC,"I saw it, but I also read that only the first book is closely related to the show. (Or better said, the other way around) So I can't just pick up the book and read it I'm afraid."
Dexter,3du6k0,Erekt__Butthole,2,Sun Jul 19 15:02:55 2015 UTC,"I'll just copy paste a comment I left in a thread from a couple of days ago about my favourite proposed ending from this sub.   Deb catches Dexter early Season 5 (this season 5 follows after S4) Quinn is on Dexter's trail. A new killer emerges who is Dr Danco from the books, except he kills bad people this time. Dexter ends up killing him and in that act, accepting that killing bad people is never an acceptable thing and that it leads to the deaths of people he cares for. He's killed in the killer's house, which is perfect as the guy has his own killing room. Quinn who had been trailing Dexter walks in at this point and catches Dexter. Dexter ends up killing him in the struggle and the gunshot rings out into the neighbourhood. He has to escape before the police are called. BHB case is reopened, Laguerta gets a warrant on Dexter's apartment, he has to escape. He is caught, we see some court trial stuff. Dexter is sentenced to death. While being administered the drugs he starts to see everyone he has killed or destroyed in his life in the observatory room. Rita/Doakes etc. Dexter says ""Tonight's the night."" End series.   This is my favourite ending I've read and it also has Clyde Phillips' ending scene in it too."
Dexter,3du6k0,iamdroppy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:20:30 2015 UTC,"I guess the observatory room was kinda obvious, when I was watching it (and didn't readed ANYTHING related to dexter because of the spoilers) thought it... It would have maded an perfect ending though, less lose ends."

Rita questions Dexter all the time about his behaviour but I find this to just be good writing and good conflict, not annoying. Rita is a person with a brain and she isn't stupid, and the writers know that.   Skyler is a woman who was always strong and takes no shit, but then again the only reason she found out about Walt is because he told her. She's seen as annoying because like Rita, she represents stopping the fun of the protagonist.   I love Rita for her strength as a person and Skyler for never believing any of Walt's bullshit."

I mean, who wouldn't want to know where their partner actually are when they find out they've been lied to? It just seems like common sense to me."
Dexter,3dpwb2,SanderCast,10,Sat Jul 18 08:05:55 2015 UTC,"On paper the ending has some symbolic purpose but all of that means nothing due to the abysmal execution of the story. Season 8 as a whole was a trainwreck and S7/S6 had poor twists, aborted arcs and plotholes. Season 5 just wasn't very well executed as well and was let down by a poor finale.  Season 5 and on a larger scale Season 6 set into motion a slew of writing that just got worse and worse after time.   S1-4 is all that I watch and consider canon, personally. S5-8 is like an entirely different show."
Dexter,3dpwb2,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:50:37 2015 UTC,"Yes those seasons weren't great, but they weren't that bad. I do agree with the aborted arcs though, that probably irked me the most in the last few seasons. Koshka seemed to wrap up early, and the whole Zack, er, thing."

He survived on that. Durrrrrr."" Fucking ridiculous.  And I think Scott Buck (i think thats his name...the showrunner for the last few seasons) said something like ""Fans shouldn't think about how Dexter survived, that's not the point."" IF YOU HAVE HIM SURVIVE SOMETHING THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SURVIVE ONLY TO BECOME A LUMBERJACK, YEAH, WE'RE GOING TO THINK ABOUT HOW HE SURVIVED. Goddammit, I thought I was over how terrible this was haha"
Dexter,3dicy1,rtm316,19,Thu Jul 16 17:31:29 2015 UTC,I remember reading an article when this first aired and the director said that was the best ending they could come up with lol yeah right.
Dexter,3dicy1,LordWayne,25,Thu Jul 16 15:31:47 2015 UTC,The best ending they could come up with to screw with the audience. The last season should have been about Dexter getting caught and all his secrets coming into the light of day. Then everyone he worked and was friends with dealing with the fallout from this huge bombshell being dropped on them.
Dexter,3dicy1,denvertebows15,6,Thu Jul 16 16:13:07 2015 UTC,ahhh that would have been an awesome ending.
Dexter,3dicy1,LordWayne,6,Thu Jul 16 18:19:49 2015 UTC,"It definitely would have been awesome to watch. I have a feeling the only reason this didn't happen was because the show writers didn't want to be ""predictable"" so they just wrote the batshit insane 8th season to be the exact opposite of the overwhelming audience prediction."
Dexter,3dicy1,denvertebows15,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:45:19 2015 UTC,That and I think the fallout would take more than one episode to get through properly.

Dexter,3dicy1,4PM,10,Mon Jul 20 16:13:49 2015 UTC,"As much as we all joke about how terrible this season and the finale was, and say ""Haha, at least it didn't end like Dexter"" and ""least its better than Lumberjack Dexter"", it really breaks my heart when I think about how one of my favourite shows (which I considered one of the greatest ever) became such a horrendous pile of shit.  There really is no excuse for what us loyal fans (who suffered through seasons 5-7 but never gave up) were given with season 8. These writers should be ashamed of themselves and should be blacklisted from anymore TV or film writing.   It pisses me off so much because there was so much potential, and really ending a show like Dexter should have been common sense - from the beginning, the inevitable arc is Dexter being discovered. The plot of Dexter being a serial killer coming to light and the repercussions of that on all the characters is an idea that is compelling in itself, even done with subpar writing. It still would have been exciting and a satisfying payoff. But the writers couldn't even do THAT right. Instead we got yet another 'killer-of-the-season' and some bullshit about Musaka's daughter.  The writers somehow managed to find a worse ending than I ever could have predicted; the compelling finish is embedded within the formula of the show's premise. Apparently the reason is because Showtime said that Dexter had to live through the finale, but that's no excuse either.  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to go on another spiel about how bad it was, but it just aggravates me more than anything else. I loved this show so much :("
Dexter,3dicy1,freeebbo,15,Thu Jul 16 15:52:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd rather have seen Dexter in Argentina with Hannah and Harrison. Cheesy, sure, but at least there would have been closure and an ending that made sense. Instead, he goes off on his own, thus making everyone, including himself, miserable and lonely.   Seriously, he abandoned his fucking kid. I still can't believe it. He puts  so much emphasis on his kid, but spends the entire last half of the series chasing serial killers, putting him in danger, putting his own interests and needs before Harrison's, and finally leaving him for good with no explanation.   And, yeah, we got Masuka's daughter for 2 minutes of tits."
Dexter,3dicy1,Alathorn,4,Thu Jul 16 16:08:16 2015 UTC,"I'm in no way defending Season 8, it was terrible. However, it's not entirely fair to say Dexter abandoned Harrison. Season 8 was really about Dexter accepting the idea that anyone close to him will eventually end up dead. That's why he sends Harrison with Hannah - not to abandon him, but to protect him. It's also why he ends up somewhere in the middle of nowhere with no friends.  It's the only way he can avoid having anyone he cares about die eventually."
Dexter,3dicy1,ForumMMX,0,Fri Jul 17 03:23:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm sorry, I don't buy that for a second. I wrote a comment about it the other day, but in mobile right now. IMHO, I would have been very happy with Dexter travelling to Argentina with Hannah."

Dexter,3dicy1,SpicyLikePepper,7,Thu Jul 16 22:22:15 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm concerned, Seasons 1-4 are canon, and Season 5 offers some closure for the ending of Season 4, but isn't ENTIRELY necessary. Everything after that is just hooey.  What kills me is that they actually managed to pull of a GREAT stunner of an ending with season 7, and promptly just pretended like none of what happened actually mattered with ALL of season 8. It was just wretched."

It was just wretched.   YES! Season 8 should have picked right up where season 7 ended. That was an amazing ending. The next hours should have played out for us - setting the crime scene, running the plan, almost getting caught... instead we get a park bench and a lucky break when Batista didn't even check that DVD.  EDIT: The DVD I refer to above is actually the warrants LaGuerta got based on surveillance video, on DVD, of Deb at the service station by the church the night Travis Marshall was killed. Batista never looked at them so Dexter was never in any jeopardy of being caught."
Dexter,3dicy1,BaconAllDay2,2,Thu Jul 16 19:30:15 2015 UTC,DVD?
Dexter,3dicy1,mikeramey1,2,Thu Jul 16 21:17:46 2015 UTC,"It wasn't a DVD, it was a warrant based on surveillance video of Deb from a DVD.   Six months after her death, many of her former co-workers show up at a bench that is being named in her honor. Angel Batista (LaGuerta's former husband and ex-partner) is displeased with her receiving a park bench as a memorial, as he feels she deserves more than that. Batista also gives Dexter a red vase that belonged to LaGuerta (which ends up being accidentally broken by Harrison Morgan while spinning on a rotating chair). At his house, Batista goes through a box of LaGuerta's belongings, ripping up the warrants that LaGuerta had kept during her investigation of Dexter and Debra, which could have otherwise implicated the two in the murder of Travis Marshall.

He's extremely cunning, and I dare say ambitious considering he believes he can keep up his game without getting caught. He's sly by nature, and plays people like a fiddle in order to get what he wants. He is of course very intelligent, and good with logic sense, so Ravenclaw isn't impossible either. Then again, Ravenclaw and Slytherin does sort of walk hand in hand."

Slytherin would not be great for his cover. I think he would debate with the sorting hat internally, like Harry did (unrelated fan theory, I think thats how everyone gets sorted, i.e. literally every student picks their own house) and that ultimately he would pick either Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff so less people would pay attention to him.  Lets also talk about how much more efficiently he could kill given magical means, mostly for cleanup."

Dexter,3dgthk,Darkskot,27,Thu Jul 16 03:58:12 2015 UTC,"I saw a post here earlier with a great ending.   Deb catches Dexter early Season 5 (this season 5 follows after S4) Quinn is on Dexter's trail.  A new killer emerges who is Dr Danco from the books, except he kills bad people this time.  Dexter ends up killing him and in that act, accepting that killing bad people is never an acceptable thing and that it leads to the deaths of people he cares for. He's killed in the killer's house, which is perfect as the guy has his own killing room. Quinn who had been trailing Dexter walks in at this point and catches Dexter. Dexter ends up killing him in the struggle and the gunshot rings out into the neighbourhood. He has to escape before the police are called.  BHB case is reopened, Laguerta gets a warrant on Dexter's apartment, he has to escape. He is caught, we see some court trial stuff. Dexter is sentenced to death. While being administered the drugs he starts to see everyone he has killed or destroyed in his life in the observatory room. Rita/Doakes etc.  Dexter says ""Tonight's the night."" End series.   This is my favourite ending I've read and it also has Clyde Phillips' ending scene in it too."
Dexter,3dgthk,Erekt__Butthole,6,Thu Jul 16 05:00:03 2015 UTC,"I see. Though the first part about Deb catching Dexter at early Season 5 doesn't add to this ending. This ending sounds more ""satisfying"", though it would depend on how the whole season with Dr Danco develops."
Dexter,3dgthk,Erekt__Butthole,2,Thu Jul 16 05:36:38 2015 UTC,"Well my quick summary of the story doesn't do it justice, but Dr. Danco from the books is the ultimate killer in terms of his methods.   Deb catching Dexter doesn't exactly add to the ending, but its something that HAS to happen in the story, and the first episode of season 5, or thereabouts, is a great start. It leads to Dexter questioning who he is and what he does and this effects his killing of Danco in the end."
Dexter,3dgthk,McLovin_56,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:39:22 2015 UTC,I always wanted it to end with him in the electric chair/death sentence scene. It would just provide a proper ending which might not be a fairytale one but realistic at least.
Dexter,3dgthk,WatM85,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:16:12 2015 UTC,"This is nice,but i don't like it too much. I liked the beginning with Dr Danco (I didn't read the books but hes pretty cool from what i've read) but i didn't like the starts to see everyone he killed and in the end says ""Tonights the night"" (i like how its the first line and the last but thats it) it wouldn't satisfy me enough.. Much better than the finale though."
Dexter,3dgthk,BlindStark,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:38:31 2015 UTC,I'd like Laguerta's death tied into this.
Dexter,3dgthk,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:15:52 2015 UTC,She wouldn't die in this ending. She would (presumably) get justice for Doakes with the warrant on Dexter's apartment. She would probably be the only one in the department pushing for his arrest while everyone else would be too shocked to do anything.
Dexter,3dgthk,BlindStark,4,Sat Jul 18 04:23:40 2015 UTC,Yes but I'd like to see her die anyway.
Dexter,3dgthk,PhettyX,6,Sat Jul 18 06:08:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think Dexter should have had a happy ending. One of the points Dexter kept bringing up was that there would never be a happy ending for him. He knew what he was, and he knew what happens to people like him eventually. I feel season 4 should have been the climax of the series, and the follow seasons Dexter's descent into ruin."
Dexter,3dgthk,vertigo1083,8,Thu Jul 16 09:34:15 2015 UTC,"At one point through the final episode, I was fairly certain that the writers, producer, and director said ""fuck all, let them do what they want"". Then they just started filming the actors, who ad-libbed the entire thing after having a round of shots.  So yes, I think literally any other ending would have been better."
Dexter,3dgthk,8u11etpr00f,6,Thu Jul 16 04:40:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, but that doesn't mean that any other ending would have been good"
Dexter,3dgthk,Derkanus,3,Thu Jul 16 05:37:41 2015 UTC,"Woulda been interesting if he got caught, mainly to see the other characters and the general public's reactions to him killing criminals."
Dexter,3dgthk,ForumMMX,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:07:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed. They toyed with Dexter getting caught so many times throughout the series--I think many of us really wanted to see it happen by the end. Maybe they execute him, maybe he escapes and runs away to Florence with Hannibal--either way it would've been better than him becoming a lumberjack."
Dexter,3dgthk,ForumMMX,3,Tue Jul 21 14:27:53 2015 UTC,"Why not an ending where he simply flies to Argentina with Hanna? That would have been so good. OK fine, I will allow him to bury Deb out to sea but come back afterwards and go on the plane!"
Dexter,3dgthk,Swiffer-Jet,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:33:05 2015 UTC,"That would have been a feel-good ending, but it will also get a lot of people angry because there's no actual closure to Dexter's deeds. Though, a lot more people would prefer it over the actual ending."
Dexter,3dgthk,_eggpIant_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:25:27 2015 UTC,"I honestly feel that the actual ending was stupid, as now his son will grow up without him.   Perhaps the writers wanted to show that Dexter is not a genius when it comes to non-killing decisions and that Dexter wanted to punish himself, that he wasn't deserving of an happy ending.  That last part I think I could have stomached over this ""I only hurt people around me so now I will leave them, hurt them now, instead of hurting them so much more in the end and proving that I am not your typical killer; perhaps I wouldn't have become this way if you hadn't moulded me this way"".  Also Hannah was the best fit for him I believe."

Both main characters are highly manipulative, cunning, and methodical. The show itself has an excellent plot line with good twists. And if you dont like anime, dont knock it until you try it.

Dexter,3deh5x,AWholeLottaMidgets,9,Wed Jul 15 17:14:27 2015 UTC,"Dexter, Brian and Deb go out on Dex's boat to save the kids (Deb's son Nicholas, Dexter's daughter Lily Anne, Cody and Astor) from the drug lord that's kidnapped them to get back at Brian. They get the kids back after sneak-killing the guards on the yacht, then blowing up half the boat (which kills Brian). During the whole fracas, the drug lord comes out and shoots Dexter in the shoulder before getting killed by a shotgun blast from Deb. Deb takes the kids back to Dexter's boat and Dexter sets a bomb on the yacht to destroy all evidence (to protect Deb, kids, and himself). While he's setting it he doesn't realize he's bleeding out, getting colder and colder. Finally it's done, crawling and greying out the whole way, he tries to get back to the boat, falls into the water and keeps sinking. Narrative ends, so does Dexter.  Hope that helps!"

Dexter,3daa59,mcweenest,16,Tue Jul 14 18:47:04 2015 UTC,"There's context to this. Dexter is losing control. All of a sudden he's seeing Brian instead of Harry. His world is kind of falling apart. Brian represents mistakes, brash decisions, and regret."
Dexter,3daa59,hollynoats,7,Tue Jul 14 19:00:31 2015 UTC,Exactly. Doesn't change the fact that it's an awkward episode though. Which sucks because Brian is such a cool character.
Dexter,3daa59,Slaytounge,3,Tue Jul 14 19:41:42 2015 UTC,"What was most awkward was that it was so brief so you cram all this strife and ""developement"" into one episode. I thought this premise would have been cool for a whole season. Like on days where Dexter is more under control and things are going OK he sees Harry but when he starts to lose control of certain situations or doubts himself he sees Brian. This slowly changes from seeing mostly Harry to mostly Brian. He struggles throughout the season and towards the end he sees what the Brian side of him has cost him he finally casts those thoughts aside forever."
Dexter,3daa59,broncoz33,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:22:38 2015 UTC,"It makes sense now. But when he returns to Miami, Harry is back.  Was this episode a hint of what's to come later?"

Dexter,3d5zvn,ShizukaNaHaji,16,Mon Jul 13 20:09:12 2015 UTC,it is very quickly covered a couple eps into s4 but was a bad way to go about it IMO
Dexter,3d5zvn,Adrian26795,9,Mon Jul 13 21:07:04 2015 UTC,It gets addressed by a nameless police officer who remarks that he isn't with Barbara anymore a few episodes into the season. Didn't feel like a good way to go about it but it's a minor thing.
Dexter,3d5zvn,Knifferoo,3,Mon Jul 13 22:36:13 2015 UTC,"It would have been more interesting if we saw Batista, a very moral man, start to conflict as he becomes attracted to LaGuerta and has to break off his relationship with Gianna over the course of Season 4.  I'm guessing they couldn't get the actor back, because the show up until that point had never been lazy across seasons."
Dexter,3d5zvn,Erekt__Butthole,3,Tue Jul 14 05:25:56 2015 UTC,"It's kinda brushed away. Angel says ""We broke up, we wanted different things."" I fill the plot hole by thinking that Barbara wanted a more casual fling relationship rather than a real one.  This is based on a few things Barbara says -    The constant circle of ""I don't date cops."" ""I don't date... ever."". It takes Angel a long time to get her on a date. After the bachelor party. Expects him to be hungover, and to have done something sleazy, almost encourages it. ""A man has his needs.""   It seems to point in the direction that she wanted a casual relationship (or even a polygamous relationship, who knows) and Batista probably wanted a more substantial relationship.  In truth, the actor probably couldn't return to the show, but this speculation helps me be at ease with the plot hole."

Dexter,3d7p26,BlindStark,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:39:52 2015 UTC,She had Rudy at her apartment a few times and probably wanted a new apartment as a new start. She stays with Dexter because she offers him security and stability to help her with her PTSD.

Dexter,3d2kfu,embracethepale,13,Mon Jul 13 02:48:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with this premise, but not quite the rationalization. Harry's number one rule was don't get caught, and everything else he taught Dexter was to this effect. He told Dexter to blend in, and Rita and the kids were a cover to look normal.  He provided for them and did the things he did in order to keep this cover. He did eventually care for them in his own way. He was reliable and seemingly stable, but he lied to them constantly. He pretty much forgot about Rita and the kids as soon as they were out of his life."
Dexter,3d2kfu,shanwow90,6,Mon Jul 13 01:49:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  I suppose.   He was a sociopath and had no real emotions.   He never grieved over Rita like a normal person,  but he did love her.   And he loved Harrison."
Dexter,3d2kfu,Treedom_Lighter,7,Mon Jul 13 02:47:25 2015 UTC,He had that murderous freak out at the beginning of season 5 in the bathroom. That was the first real time we saw him show his grief.
Dexter,3d2kfu,sepseven,2,Mon Jul 13 03:05:22 2015 UTC,That was one of my favorite episodes of the whole series. It was so awkward at times but there was like this huge emotional release when he killed that dickhead in the bathroom. Then Harry appears for the first time since Rita died (IIRC) and tells him it's the most human thing he's done since. So well done.
Dexter,3d2kfu,BlindStark,3,Mon Jul 13 14:06:30 2015 UTC,he's definitely not a textbook example of a sociopath.
Dexter,3d2kfu,sepseven,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:26:09 2015 UTC,Why do you say that? Unless you mean he's just more of a psychopath.
Dexter,3d2kfu,BlindStark,2,Thu Jul 16 01:46:14 2015 UTC,he clearly displays feelings ranging from anger to love and everywhere in between imo.
Dexter,3d2kfu,NeGronJames,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:51:37 2015 UTC,"Sociopaths are still capable of feeling emotions though, whether they are shallow or not. I'd say their hallmark is lack of conscience, Dexter though is a bit weird in that regard. I'd say he's on the spectrum but he's not a full blown 100% sociopath, he just has some of the traits. He was also kind of made into one from his environment and what he saw."
Dexter,3d2kfu,NeGronJames,2,Thu Jul 16 02:06:29 2015 UTC,Studied psychology and this is going to sound pretentious to all hell but fuck it. Sociopathy and psychopathy is very different from one another. He's more of a psychopath to me although I don't believe he is a full blown one.
Dexter,3d2kfu,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:03:20 2015 UTC,"People can develop feelings they never had before, whether they have sociopathy or not.   People in arranged marriages typically feel nothing to their spouse,  but will eventually grow to love each other.   Harry spent all of Dexters formative years telling him he was a monster with these dark urges that could never have anything normal.   Like an abusive parent telling their child they are stupid or ugly who eventually grow up with no self esteem.   The more Dexter was forced to have the mask of a normal life,  the more it became a reality and the more it changed him to be a better man than he was when we first met him."
Dexter,3d2kfu,Theodoros9,2,Thu Jul 16 00:51:27 2015 UTC,"Well first off I see your arguement but you have to remember Dexter is not a real person, its fiction, he's a character. My arguement is pretending to make Dexter a real life character and studying his traits. Psychopathy is mostly nature over nurture (although nurture can still play a significant role) meaning certain areas of the brain aren't as developed like that of a normal person or even a sociopath. In one episode Dexter has a flashback to when he was a little kid with Harry, Dexter was getting an MRI of his brain and Harry points out that areas of his brain aren't fully developed like that of a normal child. Also, Dexter has a very strong psycopathic trait in which he plans out everything and is VERY good at lying and keeping calm in stressful situations. On top of that Dexter is a master manipulator and changes situations amazingly well for his own benefit; again, another Psycopathic trait. Sociopaths are generally extremely reckless and violent.   TL; DR: Dexter is a fictious character but if you plop him into the real world he will most likely be labeled a psycopath, not a sociopath."
Dexter,3d2kfu,scarygrandma,6,Thu Jul 16 01:33:47 2015 UTC,"Dexter isn't a full blown psychopath. He's much more complex than that, and I believe he does care on some level. He's just been conditioned to think that killing can be a good thing and thus doesn't feel bad about doing it. He openly expressed feeling terrible about disappointing Rita."
Dexter,3d2kfu,Moronoo,3,Mon Jul 13 06:43:09 2015 UTC,"And he did feel guilt and remorse when he found out he killed an innocent man.   He was devastated about having to kill Brian and when he tracked down the man that murdered his mother,  that was an attack fueled with emotion."

Dexter,3d2kfu,Moronoo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:23:36 2015 UTC,"Dexter doesn't care, he's just tricked himself into caring. His entire life is a shield so he can murder people and not have anyone looking his way. He isn't a good father because he loves his family, he's a good father because it keeps his murderous side hidden. In the end he starts over in a new town, free of all the distractions he had before (Deb, the kids, his job). Psychopaths only care about themselves."
Dexter,3d2kfu,scarygrandma,2,Mon Jul 13 03:13:03 2015 UTC,"Dexter doesn't care, he's just tricked himself into caring.   I would argue that a lot of people who aren't considered sociopaths fall under this classification.   Psychopaths only care about themselves.    Again, so do a lot (if not all) of people."
Dexter,3d2kfu,Moronoo,3,Mon Jul 13 12:09:38 2015 UTC,"No. That's what separates psychopaths/sociopaths from the rest of the world. Regular people may choose not to care, Psycho/sociopaths cannot care."
Dexter,3d2kfu,Psychopath-,2,Mon Jul 13 12:22:45 2015 UTC,what is choice? how do you define choice?  we are all results of our genes plus our environment.
Dexter,3d2kfu,Treedom_Lighter,2,Mon Jul 13 12:25:35 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between holding your breath and being choked to death. One is a choice, the other is not. For psycho/sociopaths they cannot actual have real feelings. They can imitate but they will never truly feel those emotions. Normal people can choose to ignore them, but they are still there."
Dexter,3d2kfu,scarygrandma,3,Mon Jul 13 12:35:42 2015 UTC,"That's an example, not a definition.  I get where you're coming from, but I don't believe it to be as black and white as you see it.  It's a sliding scale. Any cut-off point is arbitrary."
Dexter,3d2kfu,notmyrealname34,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:46:29 2015 UTC,The only people who believe psychopaths have no emotions are people who get all their psychology information from fictional television shows.
Dexter,3d2kfu,Swiffer-Jet,2,Mon Jul 13 17:23:46 2015 UTC,"Ehh I don't know if I buy that 100%. Dexter cared about Deb and he cared about Rita's kids. It may be because his father trained him to care about Deb, but he's always really liked kids. Again, it may be because of his own lost innocence, but for one reason or another, he care about them.  As proof - the first time he broke the code. He killed that pedophile not because he was a killer, but because he was stalking Astor and Dexter freaked."
Dexter,3d2kfu,Treedom_Lighter,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:08:28 2015 UTC,He's a psychopath. There are no real rules for him. That just proves it. He will justify or rationalize it somehow.
Dexter,3d2kfu,venusdoom135,0,Mon Jul 13 15:16:43 2015 UTC,wellllll hes basically a sociopath. he doesn't really love rita i don't think like honestly his character breaks laws of psychology lol but if he is like a sociopath he wouldn't really love you. hes just trying to fit in. he was kind of raised to be controlled and was also raised to control.
Dexter,3d2kfu,Swiffer-Jet,-1,Mon Jul 20 07:05:38 2015 UTC,He's such a good father he let the nanny raise his kid for him! He also dumped his step kids when their mother died because they would interfere with his hobby.
Dexter,3d2kfu,Swiffer-Jet,3,Mon Jul 13 10:33:36 2015 UTC,"He wanted to keep them with him and was sad when they chose to live with their grandparents. Or, rather, when Astor chose that and Dexter told Cody that he needed to stay with his sister."

I can't help but feel like Saxon was meant to be much more fleshed out, but for whatever reason his story felt squeezed in amongst other things. I wasn't really convinced by the actor either. When you consider him compared to Brian Moser, there's no way he seems as threatening or daunting an opponent to Dex. I think they left a lot of loose ends, which was expected as it's not going to be possible to tie most of them, but still, I was hoping for more closure with his colleagues at least. I wish Angel had of taken a personal interest in the Bay Harbour Butcher case after Maria. That would of been really interesting."

Dexter,3d0927,newfoundslander,-1,Mon Jul 13 16:52:08 2015 UTC,its hard because i binged the first 5 and then watched the next 3 like a year later but I would say 2-4-7-3-6-8-1-5. I have no idea if that is a popular opinion or not
Dexter,3d0927,adiman93,9,Sun Jul 12 15:06:11 2015 UTC,really you found 8 better than 1
Dexter,3d0927,const_iterator,8,Sun Jul 12 15:25:11 2015 UTC,wow i've never heard of someone ranking 8 before 1. definitely not a popular opinion (not that it matters).  curious what you preferred about 8 / disliked about 1.
Dexter,3d0927,EyeMAdam,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:48:17 2015 UTC,"We didn't have as much of an emotional attachment with Dexter in season 1 as we do in the later seasons and I also like the fact how Dexter is much more human in season 8.  Also, I really like the Deb-Dexter element once Deb finds out about his secret.  Hannah kind of sucks.  If it wasn't for Hannah I would have 7 and 8 a lot higher."
Dexter,3d0927,Erekt__Butthole,2,Sun Jul 12 21:23:46 2015 UTC,Season 1 was my favourite season....
Dexter,3d0927,Erekt__Butthole,3,Mon Jul 13 03:20:19 2015 UTC,"8 better than 1. Wow. This is first time someone's opinion on this sub has made me feel angry.   Please, go back and rewatch Season 1. There's a reason as to why it's one of the most critically acclaimed seasons of TV ever, and Season 8 is considered by fans and critics alike to be either terrible or the worst final season ever. Look no further than this sub for everything wrong with Season 8, I don't think it needs to be repeated."
Dexter,3d0927,UserIsInto,2,Sun Jul 12 21:22:42 2015 UTC,"it's just a personal ranking, I'm not looking at it from a cinematic standpoint.  I'm purely ranking it based on how invested I was and how much I couldn't wait to watch the next episode."
Dexter,3d0927,Zenith661,-2,Sun Jul 12 21:26:50 2015 UTC,"But almost nobody here wanted to even watch the next episode of Season 8. We all guessed who TBS was and the episodes got worse as the season went on. Again, evidence is in the thousands of threads about Dexter ""going full retard"" in Season 8.   Season 1 on the other hand..."
Dexter,3d0kps,BriSy33,5,Sun Jul 12 14:27:56 2015 UTC,"I liked Hannah in season 7. I liked how they handled her and her whole plot, but bringing her back was a mistake. Nothing against the actress, but there was not much to do with her after. Like, yea she loved him, but she tried to kill Deb. I do get why he loved her, though. They really connected as killers. He loved Rita because she was as broken as him at the time. When Dexter was realizing he loved Rita, he was confused. But Rita understood and he loved her. He loved Hannah because he could talk about who he had to kill with her. He could be himself with her. But, I still think she should have just been done with after season 7. Bringing her back made people hate her."
Dexter,3d0kps,dvfsz,-4,Sun Jul 12 16:46:04 2015 UTC,I wanted to murder her with a lamp long before season 8. Like the second i saw her i wanted her face to look like a beaten cantaloupe
Dexter,3d0kps,adiman93,3,Sun Jul 12 17:06:23 2015 UTC,"she was not written well in season 8 .Thee actress did well with what she was given. I mean they did not know how to write her character as a love interest or as an antagonist. Her reintroduction into season 8 was poorly done,asking Dexter to kill off her new husband because he was controlling, it made us the audience dislike the character. There were plenty of better ways they could have reintroduced the character ,they could have made her the brain surgeon's girlfriend who was targeting Dexter and Debra or she could have spilled Dexter's secret to Batista and Quinn.Similarly if they wanted to reintroduce her as a love interest she could have saved Debra's life.As far the right woman for Dexter is concerned she was the most appropriate,as she actually understood him."
Dexter,3d0kps,Joe_Carioca,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:23:59 2015 UTC,Honestly i think they could have just introduced a new chracter instead of shoving Hannah down our throat while we said No repeatedly and cried.

Dexter,3cp2zp,pottswanna,13,Thu Jul 9 17:39:52 2015 UTC,Am I the only one that liked season 5? Yes. Ok.
Dexter,3cp2zp,yurieu,9,Thu Jul 9 22:48:41 2015 UTC,"nah, you're just the only one bold enough to admit it.  i liked the other seasons, too"
Dexter,3cp2zp,ponyup,2,Thu Jul 9 23:12:47 2015 UTC,"Season 5 was one of my favourites until the final episode. It was different to the first 4 but not in a bad way. Yeah it was weird that Lumen was a relationship so soon after Rita but it was framed in a way that did make sense in that it was his first real ""out"" relationship and that connections like that can be sudden and powerful. I just wish it hadn't been a big old reset button at the end of the season. Episode 6 of this season is, in my opinion, the strongest of the entire series."
Dexter,3cp2zp,BloodChicken,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:57:29 2015 UTC,Agree that the reset button makes it seem like the season never happened. What was ep 6 like btw?
Dexter,3cp2zp,yurieu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:46:41 2015 UTC,"(My memory is a little fuzzy on the details but) Ep 6 is the episode where Miami Metro are infiltrating a club and Dexter thinks he's finally rid himself of Lumen. Then some events happen where all those events combine into this great scene towards the end of the episode where Dexter has to find someone who was set-up in one of his kill rooms  but escaped and Lumen is helping him and it gets crazy tense as the Miami Metro are exploring the same area for a different dude(?) and they almost catch Dexter with the other guy but in the end Dexter is able to get both guys into the same area, kills them both and stages it to look like an Auto-Erotic Mummification, which is brilliantly mimed by Masouka."
Dexter,3cp2zp,BloodChicken,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:33:41 2015 UTC,You should have just the one where masouka does the miming. I definetly love that episode. Didnt know it was the 6th.
Dexter,3cp2zp,yurieu,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:19:40 2015 UTC,i felt that season 5 was one of if not the best seasons in the whole series.. i love Lumen
Dexter,3cp2zp,Budski23,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:15:37 2015 UTC,"yes but don't feel bad, I liked season 7 more than 1"
Dexter,3cp2zp,GrayFox7,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:47:27 2015 UTC,Yeah season 7 was really cool from what I remember.The only bad thing I remember that I disliked was that It got dragged onto season 8 but thats about it.
Dexter,3cp2zp,yurieu,38,Fri Jul 10 13:55:49 2015 UTC,Is pretending the last 4 seasons never happened circlejerk still a thing? Jeez this sub is dead
Dexter,3cp2zp,dylantrevor,23,Thu Jul 9 20:35:27 2015 UTC,That usually happens to TV show subs when the show ends...
Dexter,3cp2zp,I_LIKE_POTATOE,6,Thu Jul 9 20:54:32 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. However, regurgitating the same joke made before the show even ended is extra weak."
Dexter,3cp2zp,dylantrevor,3,Thu Jul 9 23:09:43 2015 UTC,Good point. That joke will never die though unfortunately
Dexter,3cp2zp,I_LIKE_POTATOE,-14,Thu Jul 9 23:30:40 2015 UTC,"Only as weak as the effort put into S5-8, that's what I always say.   EDIT: Haha, 5 downvotes. None of you are seriously going to try and argue that with all the plotholes (The police waiting for their spatter analyst before going into a building, Quinn forgetting Dexter is a killer, nobody in the dept. thinking Dexter is a serial killer after LaGuerta dies), poor story arcs (Oliver Saxon, Travis Marshall have fucking nothing on the complexity and portrayal of Trinity and Brian Moser, or even Lila and Miguel) terrible villains, stupid side plots (Masuka's daughter in a final season, the sergeants exam lmao, LaGuertas death treated as LESS than a side story) and absolute bullshit (Dexter surviving being dumped into the ocean, Dexter leaving bodies behind and killing people in airports and not getting caught... come the fuck on), that a lot of effort was put into S5-8. You can see the effort put into S1-4, it's completely evident. S5-8 is so riddled with mistakes it's laughable that any of those writers are professionals.   Downvote me to death, don't care. At least try to argue your point."

Dexter,3cp2zp,mike_isonfire,5,Thu Jul 9 20:23:01 2015 UTC,I always thought it was weird that Showtime agreed to air four seasons of non-canon fan-fiction after season 4.
Dexter,3cp2zp,kill_dano,2,Thu Jul 9 19:47:28 2015 UTC,You forgot season 7.
Dexter,3cp2zp,kill_dano,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:38:36 2015 UTC,Wrong it's. Better than season 3.
Dexter,3cp2zp,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:35:45 2015 UTC,"No it is not, not even close. Miguel Prado is a much more complex and well-written character/story arc than Hannah, or the aborted arc of Isaak.   Season 3 had more development of Dexter himself than in the entirety of season 7. LaGuerta's death had no consequence, Dexter fucked Hannah instead of killing her, going completely against his code, not to mention Isaak being wasted for no reason. Season 7 is a mess."
Dexter,3cp2zp,kill_dano,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:38:40 2015 UTC,"Laguerta's death aftermath is all in season 8, so idk why you think that's season 7's fault.   Debra's arc dealing with her discovery of Dex being a killer is a story we had been cockteased about for the whole show and it didn't dissapoint.   The whole circle of Deb finally getting ok with Dex's killings and asks him to kill his new murderous girlfriend for her lol c'mon now that was epic and way more interesting than anything season 3 had.   And then there's the widely praised gay hitman from Kiev out to kill dex only to eventually forgive him.   Season 3 had its moments but Miguel Prado was not a well written  character. He, for no good reason, suddenly became a mustache twirling villan to force the end of the season to have a cat mouse think until Dex predictably kills him on the table just like any other killer... And the show resets with all the characters pretty much being the same as when they started.   Like the only new thing was that Dex got married but that plot line was garbage and that's why they spent the rest of the show removing his family from the story... Orlando lol. He even kept his apartment, so season 3 did like nothing to the whole show. It's one season you could remove and everything else would still make perfect sense.   On your points about Hannah and the code. Firstly, Dexter breaks Harry's code all the time. You my have beer goggles on when you watch this show if you still think that the code was something dexter always followed to the letter.   Secondly, him letting Hannah live does not violate the code. The code is not an obligation to kill all bad people. It's to tell dexter who he CAN kill. He doesn't HAVE to kill anyone. That has nothing to do with the code."
Dexter,3cp2zp,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:10:32 2015 UTC,"I think you completely missed Dexter's conversation with Ramon. Miguel had always been a bad guy, that's the point of the season. Dexter had a friend and got manipulated, big time. Ramon says that his troubles were just him cleaning up after Miguel's screwups. He had killed before he met Dexter, most likely.   Isaak was completely wasted. Killed many episodes too early and by a single gunshot to the stomach? So weak. Not Isaak, the writing.   S1-4 Dexter does follow the code at all points besides killing the pedophile in S3E3. Do you really think, S1-4 Dexter, even if Rita wasn't in the picture, would have sex with a serial killer on his table? God, that was the show's shark jump. And then it reinvented the term to ""jumping the treadmill"" with S8. The only reason the family got removed (besides Rita) was because Clyde and a few of the instrumental writers left and the people left had no idea what to do.   Dexter getting his first friend and experiencing normalcy is a huge part of his character. Plus we see him deal with Harry and becoming a father himself.   Hannah and Dexter's chemistry onscreen (or Yvonne and MCH) is null. They do not look like they're soul mates or whatever the fuck the writers try to shove down the audience's throat. She also brings with her the plotline of ""a hot blonde can cure a serial killing psychopath.""  S7 literally rebooted its self with 3 episodes left in the season with that terribley forgettable killer arsonist. It also constantly stalled the LaGuerta arc too. Plus, she dies, Deb/Dexter both not at the party, they arrive at the party and I'm assuming 5 minutes later it's called it that shots have been fired down at the docks? Put two and two together!  I can fully understand people not being too suspicious about Dexter after Doakes, because Doakes being the BHB made sense. But after LaGuerta publically arrests Dexter, and outs him as the BHB, nobody is even the LEAST bit suspicious when she turns up dead like a day later? Not even Batista?  And then there's Speltzer, who is solely written to make Deb more okay with Dexter's stabby stab time. How more contrived could that scene be at the funeral between the two of them?  And all that matrix bullshit with Isaak is just urgh. None of the killers in S1-4 were unrealistic. Isaak basically being the fucking terminator just added another level onto the ever decreasing immersion in the show.  Another reason why S1-4 is basically it's own show, Trinity/ITK/Lila/Miguel were in the realms of reality and still yet scary, threatening and very well written. They weren't, in any way, cliche or trope characters. And if they were, it served the plot in a way that benefited the show, not detracted from it.  S7 is not on the same level as S1-4. Not in writing (this is most apparent by the voiceovers and boring sideplots that amount to nothing), cinematography (doesn't even look like the same show, S1-4 had a sharp, high contrast and beautifully directed look whereas S7 looks dull and the camera movements are industry standard, stuff you see on every other show) and overall plot. The fact that Deb finds out her brother is a serial killer who has killed for like 15 years and killed so many people and all she does is vomit and hit him? Next episode everything is just reduced to smartass comments about Dexter being a serial killer. Pfft.   And you can't argue that S3 was a reset button by the end of it. Nothing from S7 carried over to S8, and if it did, it was dropped within a very small amount of episodes. The end of S3 brought about a married Dexter who had forgiven his father and was at peace with him. It carries into S4: a baby, a wife, a family, a different Harry to the one before it, and a Dexter that now understands that he cannot seek friendship/connection."
Dexter,3cp2zp,kill_dano,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:55:59 2015 UTC,"Nothing carried over from season 7 to 8? Everything carried over. They didn't kill Hannah in 7 so she is in Season 8. Deb leaves the force because of her guilt of Laguarta, and she hate's dexter's guts and doesn't talk to him because of the the events of Season 7. Also, Laguerta is still dead in Season 8.   What Important character had any big changes from Season 3 to 4? None. Everyone who was alive is still alive, and no one suspects anything about Dexter. Everyone still has the same job.   Everything you keep mentioning about Laguerta's death is in Season 8. I would never defend Season 8. Season 8 is garbage. IMO the show should have ended with Deb shooting Dexter in the shipping container."
Dexter,3cp2zp,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:29:31 2015 UTC,"LaGuerta's death is dropped in the first episode. Deb and Dexter are friends again by episode 5. That's not carryover. Carryover is Deb investigating into Harry's CI's and finding Laura Moser. Or Harry being a completely different character now. Or Dexter being a husband and father. What you mention is wrap up carryover. Season 3>4 is basically precedent carryover, as it changes the basis of the series."
Dexter,3cp2zp,kill_dano,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:27:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's cause Season 8 sucks, but if you say nothing carried over or more things from 3-4 carried over than 7-8 you're blatantly wrong."
Dexter,3cp2zp,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:14:13 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree. There's a difference between how much is carried over, and how it actually effects the show. Something that changes the entirety of how an episode is structured is much more of a carryover than a death when all that death amounts to is a... bench."

Dexter,3ct14s,BeautifulKiller,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:32:30 2015 UTC,I actually like the ending personally.. too many people bitching about it not being realistic. It's just fine!
Dexter,3ct14s,deylath,2,Fri Jul 10 21:04:53 2015 UTC,"The majority didn't like it. I am one of the few people who liked the last season. I did raise my eyebrows from time to time, but I really enjoyed it. The last episode made me sobbing and snotting like a wild animal.  My least favorite season is the third, followed by the fifth. So I'll keep watching until there's no interest left, but keep in mind that a few bad episodes will come. There are good ones too though"
Dexter,3ct14s,CastorTyrannus,3,Fri Jul 10 18:35:03 2015 UTC,"Liked Season 8 and rate S3 as worst? Are you for real?  No seriously, im glad im not alone with this kind of opinion. I think S8 wasnt bad either, but probably most people hates it PURELY because of the ending. They shouldnt rate an entire season by just the ending. That said S6 when Dexter talks to Travis the last time and that ending really gave a big pump for me to like it. ( I liked it regardless though )  What bothers me also is S3. Miguel was a good actor and Dexter developed. Who cares about a good actor, if the entire season was boring and had non interesting killers and kills. Who cares about that development, if it didnt change anything? Sure he got a few lines and ideas from Miguel, but last i checked Rita died in S4, which means the development from Miguel did not matter at all...  S6 had plotholes, but i liked the theme, the Killer and Brother Sam and the ending. S7 doesnt get mentioned at all, because Hannah was lackluster? She was, but boy no one can deny that Isaac was a good villian and the story at least went forward unlike in S3..."
Dexter,3ct14s,cyberkitten,0,Sat Jul 11 13:48:35 2015 UTC,Imagine the last season is a dream of Deb's and Dexter dies instead of the actual person and it will be so much better.

Dexter,3cpxsh,stephanjd,10,Thu Jul 9 20:53:30 2015 UTC,"The whole reason Rudy/Brian does all that stuff is to get Dexter's attention. He purposely removed the guy's limbs and left him alive since he knew he would need prosthetics. Deb needs love so it's not surprising she falls for Rudy. She's the only person that would notice the freezer and in one episode actually mentions how cold he is when she shows up to surprise him. She's blinded by love and doesn't think anything of it until she see's those lozenge wrappers and it all adds up.  Doakes see's Dexter as a weird mother fucker, especially since he would smile at crime scenes."
Dexter,3cpxsh,BlindStark,6,Fri Jul 10 00:41:03 2015 UTC,"Yep, this.  Also, Brian had this plan for many, many years in the making. And he is an extremely intelligent serial killer who does a better job at blending in than Dexter so it's no surprise that he got with Deb.   It does make sense that it's his brother because now it adds up as to why a serial killer would be breaking into another serial killer's house and, well, putting things in weird places as a surprise and playing with their bloodslides. Just big brother stuff."
Dexter,3cpxsh,Erekt__Butthole,2,Fri Jul 10 03:39:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah he uses Deb to get close to Dexter without Dexter realizing and after he's done with her he tries to get Dexter to kill her, saying she's not his real blood family. Brian underestimated how much Dexter cares about her though. It would have been pretty cool to see them team up, but you know keep, Deb alive."
Dexter,3cpxsh,BlindStark,2,Fri Jul 10 03:49:11 2015 UTC,Ala the books.
Dexter,3cpxsh,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:04:47 2015 UTC,"People forget that the show is based on books and not only in the book does Brian randomly show up, in the book he looks just like Dexter. The show is far edgier and detailed than the book, however.    like how the guy whose limbs were cut would end up in Rudy's care.   You have to suspend disbelief to watch any show. This is just a nitpick.   n as to why Doakes doesn't like Dexter besides Doakes just having a hunch.   Because of Doakes previous line of work. He sorta has a dark passenger. He recognizes Dexter as being a predator. Some people can just read people. I am one of those, I know instantly if something is not right with you no matter how charming you are."
Dexter,3cnxpr,Lucata6240,3,Thu Jul 9 11:15:28 2015 UTC,"The books and the shows are two different universes. Only the first book and the first season are close, and everything else is way different.  For example:   In the first book, when Dexter's brother has Deb ready for Dexter to come kill, Deb is fully awake. She learns everything there and doesn't go throw a crazy fit like the show Deb did. LeGuerta finds Brian, Dexter, and Deb and she ends up getting stabbed by Brian. We also learn in this book that despite what the show depicts, Dexter actually hates blood. He thinks it's disgusting and messy.  The second book, the main villain in the book is some surgeon who removes his victim's body parts one by one. Doakes ends up getting captured by him and loses his hands, feet, and tongue. He still tries to catch Dexter but there isn't much he can do and has only appeared a few times since the second book.  Harrison is Lilly Ann, a girl instead of a boy.  Astor and Cody are being coached by Dexter sort of like how Harry coached Dexter. He notices that they have signs of a Dark Passenger too. It's been years since I've read these books, but I believe it started when a neighbor's dog was really annoying and ended up going missing or something like that.  Anything after season 2 very different. Lundy, Quinn, Lila, Miguel, Arthur Mitchel, and others never appear in the books. Rita dies in a similar, but different way.  As for the homicides that he has not committed, in Final Cut, Astor is working with someone who promises her stardom, ends up betraying her, and Astor stabs him. This guy was responsible for a number of deaths, and Rita is the only one who can absolve Dexter of fault for them. Rita is killed by Robert before Astor kills him, and since nobody can exonerate Dexter, he goes to jail for the murder of Robert and a few other people that Robert killed.  tldr; read the books. They are different from the show."
Dexter,3cnxpr,steckums,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:52:33 2015 UTC,"thanks a lot steckums! (a lot of good insight!)  but if ""Rita is the only one who can absolve Dexter of fault "" and she is dead then this will either be really weird or interesting.  with the groundwork laid out i'm very excited to get started, thanks again!"
Dexter,3cnxpr,beckoning_cat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:07:53 2015 UTC,"I actually wish that show stuck with the book Astor and Cody storylines. They were interesting.   I also wish they stuck with the Doakes storyline, though I can see how it would be hard to portray a Doaks with his limbs and tongue amputated. But I think the talking box he had to carry would of been funny."

I do, however, never really forget the scene where Dexter talks about his dark passenger at the NA meeting. ""Nothing else could ever love me. Not even... no, especially, not me."" That quote just hit me so hard, and it just made the episode that much greater."
Dexter,3cjlwe,turntechDestiel,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:21:11 2015 UTC,I can see why Dexter likes Lila because she is a free spirit who doesn't go by anyones rules but little does he know who she really is.
Dexter,3cfiy9,Erekt__Butthole,3,Tue Jul 7 14:50:39 2015 UTC,"Have to disagree, it gradually got worse and worse until the garbage fire we call season 8. Season 8 was terrible."

Dexter,3cfiy9,zx7,3,Thu Jul 9 02:55:47 2015 UTC,"I always thought Louis would end up being Season 8's primary antagonist, until he was (mercifully) killed by Isaak. Whatever it was was some seriously bad execution (pun intended)."

In my opinion, Season 5 was the only season after 1-4 that was written well, didn't have a shit ton of filler and wasn't riddled with plotholes. It still has a ton of problems itself though."

DFC left a really bad taste in my mouth, and I didn't think the characters (Dex and Deb in particular) were acting like themselves. Overall, it felt like a completely new set of characters.

Edit: I searched season 6, because the music appeared there as well, but no luck. Not every soundtrack is released i guess, since i had no luck finding what i wanted as well."
Dexter,3cdtyv,vN_GreeD,19,Tue Jul 7 03:25:38 2015 UTC,"I don't hate her as a character necessarily, but I hate Dexter's reactions to her. He lets her go and falls in love? Bah."
Dexter,3cdtyv,Starburstnova,17,Tue Jul 7 03:57:18 2015 UTC,"Hannah being introduced was probably the beginning the show decreasing in quality for me personally. It would have been awesome if Dexter, in Season 7 Episode 6, hesitated in killing her, overcame his confusion through a brief moment of clarity, banged and then killed her. Then, in the next episode, he could've dealt with his guilt and confusion over bangeing then killing her with more stabby stabby murders and total badassery and everyone would've lived happily ever after. But alas, it was not meant to be."
Dexter,3cdtyv,nicedog44,5,Tue Jul 7 04:47:50 2015 UTC,"Him turning her in and her escape should have happened earlier in season 7 after Siirko dies, and then she escapes and Dexter then kills her in the finale before LaGuerta"
Dexter,3cdtyv,Pointwest418,0,Tue Jul 7 10:34:08 2015 UTC,I don't hate Hannah but I agree that her introduction marked the start of most of the show's major plot/characterisation problems from that point on.
Dexter,3cdtyv,minuteforce,7,Tue Jul 7 13:33:30 2015 UTC,"I thought there was potential with her character, but the writers shit the bed. Tbh, I would have preferred Lumen coming back as Hannah's 'hot serial killer chick character', would have been a way more impressive emotional gutpunch. Like, for most of season 7, you have echoes of S1 with serial killings that seem to be leaving clues for Dexter. In like E9 Dexter figures out what the next kill is going to be, gets there, and he catches a glimpse of Lumen just as she gets away. Either setting up a trap for him in E10, with a series end, or a epic cross-country Dexter-Lumen chase to end S8."
Dexter,3cdtyv,ororis,6,Tue Jul 7 06:04:07 2015 UTC,Yep
Dexter,3cdtyv,HappyGilOHMYGOD,6,Tue Jul 7 03:27:10 2015 UTC,"If we can get past Dexter's inexplicable love causing him to not kill her I didn't think she was too bad in Season 7.   Season 8 however felt like her part was written for Lumen, not Hannah. You would barely have had to change Lumen's character at all for how Hannah acted in Season 8 (although possibly you'd need to change why she was on the run), no inexplicable forgiveness from Deb needed, Dexter didn't turn her over to the police so no inexplicable forgiveness needed there, no history of murdering people that complicate her life (Harrison) that apparently got thrown out of the window, and whilst she was a killer she did it for vigilante type reasons rather than just being evil. Hannah on the other hand basically acted the opposite of how she did in S7 for no reason."
Dexter,3cdtyv,duckwantbread,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:12:45 2015 UTC,"Hannah on the other hand basically acted the opposite of how she did in S7 for no reason.   I think this was really my deal with her too. It's like they forgot anything from Season 7 happened, aside from the inexplicable forgiveness angle. I thought it was absurd that Dexter thought it was okay to basically fuck Hannah over and make her go to Argentina, and then stick her with Harrison."
Dexter,3cdtyv,DsquariusGreen,4,Tue Jul 7 22:34:58 2015 UTC,"For me she's at least 80% of everything wrong with seasons 7 and 8. She's not likable, has no personality, adds very little to the actual plot outside of ""Dexter loves her now"", makes retarded mistakes as a lazy way to get Dexter in trouble, and all the while we're being forced to accept that Dexter is infatuated with her. A person with barely any emotions who only truly cares for a handful of people at the most. How are we supposed to believe that somebody like that would just fall head over heels in love with somebody on his table?  Dumb shit."
Dexter,3cdtyv,Sammiyin,2,Tue Jul 7 13:41:06 2015 UTC,They made her too perfect. They tried to make everyone like her but it was a little too forced.
Dexter,3cdtyv,sunshinechild,2,Tue Jul 7 13:02:17 2015 UTC,I knew she was going to survive only because of her casting and I knew she wasn't going to get Dexter's full ritual because she's a very attractive white female. (kind of like how Lila only got a shortened kill ritual) It's a bit too fourth-wall breaking for me and setting up the whole show for her to get a happy ending was terrible.    And why is Harrison more attached to her than Jamie?
Dexter,3cdtyv,Kinetic_Card,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:02:57 2015 UTC,"I would have loved if they kept going with the ""dexter isn't actually a psychopath he just was made into one by the code"" storyline.

Dexter,3cdtyv,scofieldslays,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:23:10 2015 UTC,"Are you sure that Deb would be alive?  She died hunting a killer, she would probably still do it if Hannah was dead."
Dexter,3cdtyv,Never-asked-for-this,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:28:26 2015 UTC,Yeah but many of the decisions that Dexter made including hunting the brain surgeon was influenced by Hannah. Many of the decisions deb made was influenced by Dexter so in the end it boils down to Dexter. I'm only saying that deb MIGHT still be alive. There is a very good chance nothing would have changed in her situation though.

They get a lot of shit on this subreddit, but that's because these people love to complain. I personally think that the books are better than the show. So, take that as you will. I just recommend reading them all."

Dexter,3c7scc,Erekt__Butthole,16,Sun Jul 5 18:21:15 2015 UTC,I don't really think its a plothole. In S3 when he's teaching Miguel the Code they go to the hardware store to buy supplies to set up the kill room and Dexter tells him buy more than what he needs. Specifically in that scene he throws in a couple life vests or something along with the plastic wrap. No one is really going to play much attention to a dude just buying stuff at a hardware store if it doesn't seem suspicious. He doesn't go in there and just buy plastic sheeting every time he mixes it up with different items.
Dexter,3c7scc,denvertebows15,5,Mon Jul 6 04:32:56 2015 UTC,"Oh right, good point. I guess if he buys fishing equipment and gear, the plastic wrap and bags make sense. I still think he'd grab full body overalls and face masks from work. They don't really make sense for fishing."
Dexter,3c7scc,BlindStark,2,Mon Jul 6 06:09:01 2015 UTC,"It's not like he can't just go buy a face mask somewhere, he doesn't have to buy fishing equipment with it. It's not like a minimum wage employee would care. You could even buy stuff online. You can buy industrial size rolls that will last forever. I think his main point was don't buy a bunch of knives, duct tape, plastic wrap, trash bags, etc. all together because it looks weird. I doubt anyone would care or even notice if he came in every once in a while for some plastic sheeting."
Dexter,3c7scc,BlindStark,4,Mon Jul 6 06:12:42 2015 UTC,"I think the point about buying all that stuff was that it could be of detriment during an investigation, like the BHB case.   And he kinder needs a reason as to why he's buying that stuff if it was ever brought up, and the plastic wrap/trash bags make sense for fishing so I used that example."
Dexter,3c7scc,Pointwest418,2,Mon Jul 6 06:39:54 2015 UTC,"It could be if the police are looking for someone who buys it, though Dexter would know if that was the case. Otherwise plastic sheeting is used in a lot of construction and no one is going to notice him coming in every few months to buy some, I'd imagine he just stays stocked with the stuff. He could grab the items he needs while shopping normally for steaks and beers and whatever else he buys. Cashiers aren't even going to notice or care, even if they did ask he could just say he needs it for construction, painting, etc. He's not buying a sign that says I KILL PEOPLE on it."

Dexter,3c7scc,ForumMMX,3,Sat Jul 11 16:41:02 2015 UTC,"He should be buying towels too, I would think that after chopping up bodies most of the blood would run out , and since the plastic is non absorbent,  it would be a fucking mess. But wtf are we watching this show w/o suspended disbelief right?"
Dexter,3c7scc,deliriumtr3mens,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:53:32 2015 UTC,"Because these kinds of things are mass produced, and something like plastic isn't going to have serial numbers you can trace.   It would be like tracking down who bought a case of soda. There really is no way to to do it.  If items were as easily trackable as some shows make it out to be, there wouldn't be mass consumer alerts for e. coli poisoning, they would knock on people's doors."
Dexter,3c72y7,dexterfinalseason,33,Sun Jul 5 14:06:07 2015 UTC,I think the season 5 finale would have been a decent ending to the story. Dexter is celebrating his son's birthday. Debra is happy with Joey. Dexter saved Joey's ass and now Joey is off of Dexter's ass. Basically everything came together. He can go on being a serial killer and take care of his son.
Dexter,3c72y7,briastkam,12,Sun Jul 5 16:16:20 2015 UTC,"And he found hope that maybe there's a way to get rid of his dark passenger.  Seriously, why are people always overlooking that?..."
Dexter,3c72y7,Never-asked-for-this,4,Mon Jul 6 01:18:11 2015 UTC,"It has too many problems for me to be happy with it.  The aborted arc of the Sante Muerta brothers or whatever they were called. Quinn having extremely damning evidence that Dexter was dumping a body on his boat, and what does he do? Amnesia, he simply forgets about it completely.  The Barrel Girl Killers are nothing compared to Trinity as a final season adversary, or even Lundy for that matter.  Plus, Lumen disappears which annoys me storywise."
Dexter,3c72y7,hmongxboi,4,Mon Jul 6 06:07:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think we can justify a different ending by just saying that it was better than the S8 finale because anything would've been better than that. While I agree it would be very fitting and ""full circle"" for Dexter, I can't say that I'd be happy about it ending that way. Stories are interesting because they show growth and change in characters. We see Dexter changing and morphing throughout the show. Rita's death allowed for more development of his character, which was something I wanted to see. If we assume he just moves on after Rita's death and continues his happy life as a serial killer/father, this essentially undoes all of the character development we see in S1-4. Pretty much any ending that results in Dexter returning to his previous lifestyle would be bad in my opinion. And also, DEBRA?! I'd be more upset over them ending the Dexter/Debra relationship that way."
Dexter,3c72y7,falkerman,2,Mon Jul 6 03:29:33 2015 UTC,"It's a good ending for Debra in S4.  She gets justice for Lundy, she learns that Dexter was related to Brian Moser, and she's probably on the brink of getting with Quinn. LaGuerta & Batista are happy together. Masuka and his ridiculous lightning bolt truck are happy together. And now Dexter, the serial killer of many, many people, finally gets his comeuppance. I agree with what Dexter does, killing bad people, but that doesn't make it a good act. Plus, he tried to have it all and finally learned that he could not, and now just like he paid the price as a child, Harrison will too."
Dexter,3c72y7,Warden72,9,Mon Jul 6 06:02:26 2015 UTC,"It left too much open, in terms of remaining storyline, to just finish it right there.  Season eight shouldn't have happened, season 7 should have had Batista taking over Maria's role after her murder.  Start investigating her murder and continue her case on Dexter and Deb.  The two of them team up to save their own asses, culminating in this big showdown.  Dexter & Deborah Morgan vs. Batista, Quinn, and the Miami PD.    Instead, well... we know what they did."
Dexter,3c72y7,deylath,6,Sun Jul 5 17:39:28 2015 UTC,"I would have preferred season 8 starting a few days or a couple of weeks after Maria's death and basically turning into Of Mice and Men, with Deb essentially executing Dexter at the end because she slowly comes to realize over the course of the season that he cannot be helped and is ruining everyone's lives.  Not particularly original, but would have made more sense and been less of a stretch than what the final season turned out to be."
Dexter,3c72y7,deylath,4,Mon Jul 6 02:30:35 2015 UTC,"Well thats the thing. S4 has the best adversary and Dexter loses the most, so it feels like a good ending to me.   Yeah there's unexplored story like Dexter getting caught except... in the following 4 seasons, he doesn't get caught anyway so..."
Dexter,3c72y7,robertdegeus,2,Mon Jul 6 06:04:46 2015 UTC,"Is it a good ending? Yes  Is it a good finale? No  Just ask yourself this: If Dexter really ended ( no more seasons ) with season 4, wouldnt you be angry? I cant read anyones mind, but that would have caused much more harm, than this ending.  Granted, Season 5 was a huge dissapointment and a letdown, but hey S3 was bad as well ( in my opinion ), except for the 1st episode. Season 6 was decent storywise and we had a good villain.  Season 7 was one of the best seasons ( again my opinion ) storywise and actually is in top 3 regardless ( really loved Issac ). Im not sure Hannah was a good inclusion, because without her, there was a chance that the series could have ended in Season 7, but since it continued, no big deal.  Then there is season 8. Storywise not many things left uncovered. Dr. Evelyn and Zach was nice, but not enough. Since we arrived this far Debra had to go.   Long story, short:  The show needed more seasons to close the story. Except S5 and S8 finale, it was worth watching it. I think an ending where Dex ""looses"" Harrison and his sister is an expected thing, thus he becomes totally lonely. Though, ending as a lumberjack or Dex killing himself would be a bad ending. Getting caught, well maybe, but i would love if it would have happened in a twisted way. ( Like Quinn catches him, but out of respect he  helps him in a way, but after realizing its hopeless and dont want too see him suffer he kills Dex in the prison )"
Dexter,3c72y7,brittpinkie,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:13:12 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't have been angry. It would have been an open ending, sure, but it would have been extremely impactful. Michael C. Hall himself said that the perfect ending for Dexter was him coming home to find his wife dead and his son covered in her blood. And then, and I quote, he said: ''But then we did four more seasons. [Laughs]""  Even the actual guy who WAS Dexter thinks that its a good end to the story. I'm sure MCH thought he'd one day be playing a crazy final season in which he gets caught but he quickly realised this wouldn't happen once Clyde Phillips left.  Season 3 was bad if you don't care about Dexter himself. It's about Dexter becoming a father and dealing with his own father. At least the bad guy isn't just some random killer of the week bullshit, he's actually the closest person to Dexter. Miguel marks the first time that Dexter is manipulated.  And S6 decent, seriously? Colin Hanks was terrible as Travis Marshall. He just yelled a lot. He had nothing on Christian Carmargo or John Lithgow. Not even Jaime Murray or Jimmy Smits. And that terrible plot twist that Gellar was dead the whole time was predicted by just about everyone here at the time.  Add to that all of the plotholes that S6 had that I'd be happy to list for you, as well as S7.  Season 8 was completely terrible and I really don't think anybody has to explain why. There's like 300 posts on this sub about how bad it was.  The show needed one more season, MAXIMUM 2 to have Deb find out and Dexter to be caught. And under Clyde Phillips, he would have been caught, just look at the ending he released."
Dexter,3c72y7,yes_it_is_weird,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:25:59 2015 UTC,"You raise very good points.   Season 3 is more of a personal thing. Belive me im all in for Dexter's character development, but for me S3 brought neither story, neither development. + I watched S3 in my own language and Miguel's voice was very boring.  S6: Im rewatching the whole show now, i usually never watch or play something with a critique eye like at all ( i usually doesnt even notice problems in game or a movie ) , so probably i will probably change my mind about S6. Im a fool, i know but i did not predict Gellar's death.  S8 was bad yeah, but some elements of it were good. Dr Evelyn and Zach were good, but i think S8 was doomed from the moment that Hannah was kept, especially with that ending.  And again: yes its a very good ending and yes S4 was the perfect moment to pull it off. Open endings are nice, but as you said it deserved two more season at max, if that two would be heavily story based."

Dexter,3c72y7,JeamBim,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:59:58 2015 UTC,It leaves you having no idea what happens to trinity or dexter himself. In my opinion a good makeshift finale for the show is the season 5 ending. At least then you see what happens to trinity.
Dexter,3c72y7,dpmcg,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:32:53 2015 UTC,What do you mean Trinity? Dexter killed him and dumped his body in the ocean before arriving home in the S4 finale. Miami Metro will just think he fled the country.

Dexter,3c72y7,alsoye,0,Mon Jul 6 06:56:19 2015 UTC,"S4 was the best season of dexter, start to finish, if you ask me."
Dexter,3c5e0e,NecroSpace,10,Sat Jul 4 23:27:43 2015 UTC,"The first four seasons are fantastic. People have varying opinions on the last four, but the general consensus is that the writing became visibly worse. Everyone hates the finale.  Here's what I think in a spoiler-free package, but everyone has their own gripes with the show:   Dexter became too 'normal' after season 4. A big part of the appeal of the show was Dexter's awkwardness and struggle to understand human interaction and emotion. Combined with Dexter's compulsions, this made him a fascinating and funny character with great monologue. After season 4, he started becoming too normal - he become remorseful, empathetic, loving, and social. In other words, a 'normal' guy who happened to also kill people. His quirkiness was the draw of the show, and he lost it.   He also lost his morbid sense of humor after season 4. It wasn't gone completely, but the tone of the show changed in the last four seasons. I think season 4 is actually to blame for this. The writers kept trying to emulate season 4's focused and fast-paced narrative, but the writing didn't measure up. Essentially, the writers tried to turn Dexter into a high-tension thriller. They abandoned Dexter's side kills and plots and focused too much on the central antagonist and Dexter's pursuit of him. Every side interaction involving Dexter was either to further the main plot or a hamfisted attempt at more 'character development'.   Additionally, the new characters after season 4 were terrible. They didn't have to be so bad, but the writers kept adding characters just to kill them off right away. How am I supposed to care about the new guy when he gets 5 lines of dialogue before being killed off? What about this new threat to Dexter that unremarkably ends a few episodes later? The new characters had little personality and even less character development, and it was all too clear that they were introduced just to move the plot forward before being killed off. And man did they ever mess up Quinn.   Dexter also became less 'smart' as the series went on. He started taking people down during the day, in public, without planning, etc. Dexter appeared reckless because of the poor writing. In one of the most ridiculous examples, Dexter sent an inflammatory video of himself, from his personal phone, to a serial killer who was being pursued by Miami Metro.   I have a lot to say about Hannah's failed character and the finale, but I won't get into it because it would be serious spoilers. Suffice to say, the finale was awful and Hannah became just another dull character introduced to move the plot forward. Season 8 was really bad, and I'm kinda bummed that I can't express its true shittiness to you. Maybe the worst thing was that season 8 aired along with Breaking Bad's final season - so viewers got to see the different between good writing and... season 8 of Dexter.  That being said, watch the whole thing. Even the last four seasons aren't completely bad. They have their moments. I like to think of them as a different (and considerably worse) show. After re-watching season 7 for the fourth time though, my option of that season is actually a lot higher than when I initially saw it. The Quinn stuff was pretty dull I guess.   Here's my ranking: 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, - -  - - - - - - - - - - 5, 6, 8  A lot of people rank 4 higher and that makes sense too."
Dexter,3c5e0e,gurglingemu,2,Sun Jul 5 03:53:18 2015 UTC,"Since you bothered writing a story. I have a question.  Why no one bothers one word about S3 and shitting on S6?   Neither of them bothered anything storywise. S3 has uninteresting killers and characters and S6 does not, yet S3 is rated much higher. S6 had a good theme and a good villain. The kills were interesting. S6 had some poor writing, yes thats a bad thing, but S3 brought nothing to the series ( quinn and Rita getting pregnant does not count )   That being said, dunno why S5 considered better than S6 for the same reason, but thats for another reply if you are up to it."
Dexter,3c5e0e,deylath,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:36:19 2015 UTC,"My Pleasure and thanks as well.  I was over exaggerating by saying better characters, i must admit. ( did not remember Jamie or Mike for that season ) Im usually blind to many mistakes in games/movies unless they are very bad or good. Im rewatching anyway so my opinion will probably change because im experiencing a different opinion.  Its just that i did not like any of the characters from S3. I cant appriciate a good actor if he has no real value for the story or character development for the main character. I liked Brother Sam from S6 only, so maybe thats why i said that.  On an kind of unrelated note, im watching season 1-4 in my own language, the voice acting is actually very decent. I have the option to switch to English audio stream, but for no earthly reason that audio stream quality is way worse, but i tend to rewatch a tiny moments in English to see how it is there. ( Doakes's motherfaka, Trinity swearing at Christine, Dexter shouting Miguel, etc ). Dexter 's voice acting is very nice in my language, but it has a different feeling, but still good. I said its decent, but i discovered that my no love for Miguel is very well maybe, because im not watching it in English, because i see the difference, but stick to mine regardless since as i said the overall quality seemed very bad ( music, environment sound quality, everything ). In my version Miguel has a very boring voice and feels like the voice actor did not care too much ( maybe thats his character in English as well ), but regardless i just cant seem to place Miguel anywhere, he just simply did not effect the story or Dexter's character.  Yes. S6 ending was a really big push for me. The talk with Travis before Dex kills him and that cliffhanger at the end. Yeah, the theme can be annoying, maybe it was too much for an entire season, but i liked it.  I see that you rated season 7 among the better seasons and im happy about that there are people that feel that way. Really loved the season, because almost everything was good. Good amount of story, with the exception of Hannah i really liked every character that season.  I would like your opinion on season 7 as well :). Really love to read very detailed analysises, though its a same i cant write those, but at least you seem to care about long comments. Thanks again"
Dexter,3c5e0e,deylath,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:41:21 2015 UTC,"(my comment may have spoilers to those who haven't watched the full series)  I really enjoyed season 7 and I thought season 8 would be cool as it was. Ofc it was different than earlier seasons but I really enjoyed it, specially the finale (even though many people may not like it). Season five was meh until the half of it, then it really became bad with the partner-killing thing. Six had EVERYTHING to be a great season. The killer was nicely done at first. These is what maded the sixth the WORST SEASON for me: Dexter sees a guy ""smiling"" at the crime scene and thinks: ""Whoa hey! This is the serial killer! I MSUT KILL HIM"", other thing is the Professor... He could have been an great character if he existed. But he didn't, they spoiled the feeling to have him on the table. Not to mention Deb's ""love"" with Dexter. Stuff that I hate about Dexter: Producers changing it to make Dexter perfect (always knowing who to kill and who to blame. Like the Travis stuff I mentioned above), Deb's love with Dexter, Hannah Mckey, bad written chars (like Dr. Vogel & her son). I liked and disliked the finale (sometimes I think it was ""good"", sometimes I think it's pretty bad).  Other thing that I want to say is that I guess Dexter is Dead. When he thrown Debra into the ocean, he went to the storm... NO WAY HE WOULD HAVE SURVIVED THAT, EVEN IF HE WANTED TO (WHICH CLEARLY HE DIDN'T, BECAUSE HIS FUCKING SISTER IS DEAD AND HIS EMOTIONS APPEARED WITH MAGIC).  Sorry wenting a little bit offtopic here but I needed to take it out of my chest. Dexter overall is great and the OP should watch it all, but personally, this is the things that upset me the most."
Dexter,3c5e0e,iamdroppy,5,Tue Jul 7 06:41:42 2015 UTC,"Personally really enjoyed how the series progressed, they keep things interesting by always throwing in new curve balls as it goes on. I'm watching it over for the second time currently, I'd recommend going on with it as its still one of my most enjoyed series' I've watched. But as for the series finale....was not much of a fan of that...and you'll get that response from many watchers as well. Overall an amazing show in my opinion!"

Dexter,3c5e0e,deylath,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:21:29 2015 UTC,"I just finished the last episode of season 4 today, so I can't comment on the last 4 (though from the sounds of it, it's less than what I'm going to be hoping for), but season 3 was my favorite. I really liked Miguel Prado and his development. That and I enjoyed Dexters' attempts at being a normal person. I would rank Miguel over Arthur, but I did enjoy season 4. Season 2 was my least favorite, but only because of Lila. I enjoyed the thrill of the season, but I couldn't stand Lila at all. She is probably my least favorite character in a tv show. I'm not sure why, I just found her incredibly annoying."
Dexter,3c5e0e,lemoncatparty,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:23:58 2015 UTC,"I can accept if someone has a strong opinion on something. I watched S3 on my language and there Miguel's voice was boring for me. Maybe his voice actor was even better than the English version, but i just did not like it. Though you are not the only one who says Miguels actor was really good, but i just dont care if someone is a  good actor. Yes Dexter was changing, but it did not matter at the end didnt it? Its just that, nothing happened in S3, no good killers, no good killings, no story and since Rita died, Dexter's develeopment does not even matter.  Same with S2. She will probably stay as your least favourite character. My advice for the rest of the seasons: Do not watch them as a critique eye at all. Im kind of an idiot person who notices 0 problems in any given movie or game, until i read forums,discussions, but at least i enjoyed the show before i read them.  Depending on your personality S6 could be an okay season. One could argue that S7 is as good in quality as the better seasons, though it kind of has the same problem like you have with S2."

Dexter,3c5e0e,fifbiff,6,Sun Jul 5 09:10:27 2015 UTC,I agree that season 6 is much better than what most of this sub thinks about it. You may say cheesy but I loved it.

Show-Dexter got careless toward the end of the series (or the writers did, or both), but book Dexter is an idiot. He constantly internally-monologues about how smart and careful he is then blindly walks into trap after trap only to be saved at the last minute by a homicidal elementary schooler.

It centers around a young Harry as the main character and explains what happened to Harry to make him raise Dexter as a serial killer.

Dexter,3bpxjl,Slaytounge,7,Wed Jul 1 05:39:33 2015 UTC,"Hmm...97% Rotten Tomatoes. 9.4 IMDB. 2.7 million viewers for the first episode. Which is very high for USA Network.   I'm thoroughly intrigued. Hopefully this show can be a catalyst for USA to be a premium channel for top quality content. The next HBO/FX/AMC? I would LOVE to have another channel producing good dramas. Thanks for bringing this show to my attention, OP!"
Dexter,3bpxjl,jpatton89,6,Wed Jul 1 07:55:08 2015 UTC,watched the pilot on youtube a few weeks ago and was really happy with it. the technology lingo they use isn't cliche or said to make characters sound nerdy. they used it in sensible ways relevant to the story.
Dexter,3bpxjl,gl0ryus,3,Wed Jul 1 05:51:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, I know someone who works in this industry, he said it was surprisingly accurate. Also, there's another big Dexter link...he collects trophies. Dexter did blood slides, this guy saves dvds full of the victim's data. He also works for a cyber security firm, another Dexter parallel. I have to wonder if the writer was heavily influenced by the dark passenger."
Dexter,3bpxjl,MICHAELSD01,2,Wed Jul 1 06:06:42 2015 UTC,Came here to post this same opinion.
Dexter,3bpxjl,jpatton89,2,Wed Jul 1 05:44:10 2015 UTC,the main character also keeps CD's as a record of his hacking victims. Similar to the blood slides on Dexter.

He has a great inner dialogue that feels like another (almost guiding) figure, much like Harry, Dexter's dad, in that show. Does anyone see the resemblance as well?"

Dexter,3betp4,frellus,2,Sun Jun 28 19:07:06 2015 UTC,"I had the same thought and posted this in a thread about the show around when it first was online.   Honestly, I couldn't get it out of my mind that it is Digital Dexter. Seriously, watch the pilot with that notion. He talks to an imaginary person/self (us), he works with the authorities during the day and takes justice into his own hands by night, he see's things that aren't there, severe personality disorder, all the way down to the first episode having a criminal doing a misdeed for him to realize his potential (and also he is in awe of their work). Even the scene of him stalking his therapists online suitor and him going on the rant only to have it be in his mind feel like Dexter to me.  Now, I love Dexter season 1-4, like most of the rest. This show definitely has it's own thing going that I think could be spectacular. I watched the pilot 4 times already and honestly can't wait for the show to start."

Underrated: I'd say 3. It's not disliked like other seasons for being riddle with plotholes or stupid plots in general, it's disliked because it just wasn't as interesting or intense as 1/2/4. On a rewatch though, S3 is a solid, entertaining season and I love it."

I like that we really learn more about dexter this season and it shows that he is capable of being a normal human.  The whole season has made me wonder if Dexter is the way he is because his dad rammed it into his head his entire life. Had his dad not pushed the code on him, would he have turned out normal? Granted, I'm only 3 seasons in. Why did I wait so long so watch Dexter?  I didn't care for season 2. Sure it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire season, but I couldn't stand Lila, she really made it a chore for me to finish the season, and Doakes was one of my favorite characters :("

Dexter,3b1dnl,Erekt__Butthole,8,Thu Jun 25 04:34:34 2015 UTC,The only character that I thought was truly bad was Oliver Saxon and he's the one that pretty much screws up Dexter's whole life. Most of the other characters in the show are pretty great in my opinion.
Dexter,3b1dnl,BlindStark,3,Thu Jun 25 10:27:20 2015 UTC,Bad as in a terrible character or evil? Because I think Trinity takes the cake. Brian was also incredibly evil too.
Dexter,3b1dnl,BlindStark,4,Thu Jun 25 11:20:05 2015 UTC,"Bad, as in shit character not evil. You are supposed to hate some characters in shows, like Lila but I thought she was an actual good character. A bunch of people hated Skylar White in Breaking Bad but I thought she was awesome in it.  Oliver Saxon is just a shit character. Trinity and Brian were amazing."
Dexter,3b1dnl,Reverend_Twitch,2,Thu Jun 25 18:42:54 2015 UTC,"Ah, thank you. I was going to be quite ""angry"" if you said Saxon was the best villain lol.   Skylar, on first viewing of Breaking Bad, sucks, because she is constantly slowing down the narrative which is frustrating. Plus we are trained to be on Walt's side since he's the protagonist. Once you've seen the series and know what's coming, Skylar is a great character. Second viewing and beyond for me and I really enjoy her character. She's incredibly intelligent, can manipulate if it's necessary and is almost never duped by Walt's bullshit. Skylar is a wonderfully written and portrayed character too, but what else would you expect from Breaking Bad?"
Dexter,3b1dnl,beckoning_cat,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:48:40 2015 UTC,It's because everyone is watching Breaking Bad from Walt's perspective. If someone was in Skyler's position they would have probably done the exact same things.
Dexter,3b1dnl,BlindStark,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:08:49 2015 UTC,"People tend to not like real women in shows. The hate on Skylar is just misogyny. That was the beauty of BB, they made you root for a guy who was down right evil. Skylar fought against him, but in the real world, people would of crucified a mother for letting a man like that around their children. People hate real women characters who play how women respond because they actually want them to be obliging accomplices and devoted to their man no matter who they are."
Dexter,3b1dnl,unique_id,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:43:26 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call it misogyny at all, there are plenty of reasons why people would hate her. She cheated with Ted, she smoked while pregnant, she's a hypocrite and still used Walt's money. She still ended up going along with Walt anyway she just did it in the worst possible way. Like trying to drown yourself in front of your own family? People root for Walt because he started off just trying to provide his family with money before he passed away. She was never meant to be a strong female character but to be an imperfect and complex one. Which makes her more realistic and is the reason why I like her as a character, I can see why people would hate her though. Walt also goes down hill and does a lot of fucked up shit. In the end most people were really rooting for Jesse to make it out. I haven't seen the show in a long time though so I can't give a real in depth opinion of it. Most of the scenes with Skylar are her getting mad at someone and causing family drama while Walt just wanted his family to be well off and together. Oh and didn't she actually want to kill Jesse? She put her family in danger just as Walt did so I wouldn't say either of them are innocent. People sympathize with Walt more because that's how the show was written, he was beaten down by life and wants to go out leaving money for his family while he's dying of cancer. He just ends up living and it spirals out of control. I understand where Skylar is coming from though and love her on the show."

Dexter,3b1dnl,beckoning_cat,2,Sun Jun 28 07:26:36 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, with all your points.  I liked season 3. It's my third favourite season after 2 and 1. Even though I HATE Lila and skip every scene she's in, she was necessary to the story."
Dexter,3b1dnl,_eggpIant_,2,Thu Jun 25 17:03:36 2015 UTC,"Every scene? So you just skip the entirety of Season 2 besides the first two episodes? Lol, I kid. Interesting to hear that you don't rank S4 first, second or third. What didn't you like about it?"
Dexter,3b1dnl,franch,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:08:25 2015 UTC,Lol Lila's scenes aren't very long.  Season 4 had too much Trinity and baby. The guy who plays Trinity is also Barney's dad in How I Met Your Mother and I just can't think of him as anyone other than Barney's dad.
Dexter,3b1dnl,adiman93,2,Fri Jun 26 03:13:29 2015 UTC,"John Lithgow is an amazing actor. He was hysterical on 3rd Rock from the Sun, to playing the Trinity killer. He legitimately creeped me out."
Dexter,3b1dnl,iNachozi,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:39:36 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I found Trinity to be completely bi-polar and thus, extremely effective as a villain. One moment he's crying, the next moment he's slicing up a woman in a bathtub... I think the point of Trinity was that he was ''Barney's Dad'' in some way, and that's what made him so scary. He was so normal yet such a deranged individual.  I thought Dexter dealing with having a child spawned some great scenes; ""Daddy kills people"" being one of them."

Dexter,3b149n,Munchsicles,2,Tue Jun 30 19:21:05 2015 UTC,I know right. I didn't like the way season 8 began ut what it turned into midseason was pretty good. I liked Dexters protege and the psychologist was cool. But the last two or three episodes made it a truly crappy season.

Dexter,3ayv90,Riker87,0,Wed Jun 24 18:03:54 2015 UTC,Imo i don't like the Clyde Phillips emding it dosen't make sense that he would get caught  when 1. He would be 2 steps ahead of the investigation. If they brought back s1-4 dexter and 2 if he relocated with a new id he could still do what he does best and not get caught
Dexter,3axf3a,Erekt__Butthole,5,Wed Jun 24 07:21:45 2015 UTC,Damn Paul was an asshole. But Doakes starting to stalk Dexter was great.
Dexter,3axf3a,alienfrog,5,Wed Jun 24 09:19:48 2015 UTC,"Assshole or not, he was still right about Dexter. I imagine if the ""you're a drug addict"" assumption by Rita didn't occur, she might have dug deeper and, I don't know, hired a PI on Dexter. Who knows. But Paul's claims about Dexter meant that Rita jumps on the first explanation she can find and thus Dexter is still protected.   Paul also is responsible for two of my favourite scenes: Dexter hitting Paul with a frying pan, and Dexter barely flinching when Paul attempts to punch him. Both amazingly hilarious scenes."
Dexter,3axf3a,alienfrog,7,Wed Jun 24 14:27:40 2015 UTC,It was great how comfortably Dexter dominated Paul.

Dexter,3awbkl,Roach09,7,Wed Jun 24 13:49:45 2015 UTC,It's also the reason he 'meets' Deb... I think he knew what he was doing the entire time.
Dexter,3awbkl,olhomy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:27:11 2015 UTC,"That's a mighty stretch though. I think he saw an opportunity and took it. I mean, how would he know that Deb would be so involved with Tucci, let alone the case?"
Dexter,3awbkl,Roach09,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:53:19 2015 UTC,"It's important to remember that Brian was also keeping a close eye on Deb, not just Dexter.  It's likely he had some knowledge of what was happening with her professionally (recent promotion from Vice, where he also saw her working). Knowing this, it's not much of a stretch to think that he was monitoring Tucci's room/visitors waiting for someone who could get him closest to Dexter.   I'd say 75% planning, 25% luck.  EDIT: He was also killing hookers Deb knew personally. He almost single-handedly secured her promotion himself (with some 'help' from Dexter... But that was Brian's doing as well)."

Dexter,3augcp,Orakk,6,Tue Jun 23 16:52:26 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of her body, face and acting skills - but her character is what started the downfall of this otherwise awesome TV series. If Hannah hadn't happened, I think we could've gotten a somewhat decent ending to this series. But oh well :(."
Dexter,3augcp,Treedom_Lighter,2,Tue Jun 23 23:26:34 2015 UTC,"I think Hannah was an important story arc because it showed that Dexter could in fact be in a relationship with someone and be totally open and honest with her, and have that person accept him for who he is, and love him not only despite of it, but for it. That was huge for Dex. Every relationship he's had he had to hide something from his partner. Rita was obvious, but even Lila he hid things from. First, his real identity, and then after she found out he was the BHB, he hid his deadly intentions toward her as well as some of his better traits (such as his loyalty to his family, Rita and the kids).   He hid less and less from Deb every year, but even when she was questioning him about his killer instincts toward the end he was reluctant to tell her almost anything that she didn't directly ask about.  Having someone like Hannah come into Dexter's life was really an amazing turning point in his life (that still went horribly wrong eventually... but it was nice for a while!)."
Dexter,3augcp,Treedom_Lighter,13,Thu Jul 2 20:03:59 2015 UTC,"Lumen & taking out the RapeRing I thought was a great way to come back from the Rita/Trinity season... Season 7 might've been one of the best complete seasons with 1, 2 & 4. Isaak Sirco and Joey Quinn's super-hot stripper girlfriend were highlights, then the whole Hannah arc with the ""snow at the fair"" kill/sex room. The whole high school reunion was great, especially ""Hammer Time."" The season 6 tableaus were all pretty great & gruesome, and the 4 Horsemen kill might've been the best visual of the entire series.  And possibly my favorite post-season 4 scene of all: Dr. Vogel handing Dexter the collection of drawings he made as a child that showed how dangerously disturbed he was."
Dexter,3augcp,MrMojo39,6,Tue Jun 23 17:15:33 2015 UTC,Dr Vogel was fascinating. Really showed the audience an unexplored facet of Dexter.
Dexter,3augcp,JeebusAlmighty,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:19:05 2015 UTC,Agreed. She helped build his character and added a new dimension to it.

The rest of the villains very much seemed...far fetched, or one in 500,000,000 type of people. But the BGG felt very...real. And that made them EXTREMELY creepy and they made my skin crawl."

Dexter,3augcp,myntex,3,Wed Jun 24 00:16:27 2015 UTC,For me it is personally the season finale of season 6 + the next 3 episodes of season 7. When Deb puts it all together and asks Dexter if he's a serial killer and then immediately storms out and breaks down ... Flawless execution for that much foreseeable plot direction. I get goosebumps each time I see those episodes on rewatches :).
Dexter,3augcp,ChupacabraIsMyFriend,3,Tue Jun 23 23:28:13 2015 UTC,"I'm watching through the series for the 2nd time and S06E07 - ""Nebraska"" is one of my favorite episodes. The Dexter and Rudy/Brian road trip is awesome."

Dexter knows Harry isn't actually there, it's more of a way to show the viewer what Dexter is thinking. Travis actually believes Gellar is alive and making him do these things when in reality it's only Travis. Travis killed Gellar and I think he even killed his own parents. We see the story of Travis how he's imaging it in his own head not how it actually is. He probably wasn't actually chained up and he probably didn't even knock himself out, he just imagined he did. He has psychological problems which make him violent and delusional which he can't control."

Dexter,3ara9o,SolomonReed,3,Mon Jun 22 21:37:47 2015 UTC,I'm okay with it since the show never explicitly says why they didn't show up. They very well could have been out of the country at the time or might have been too sick to make the trip and held a separate event later to mourn his death. It was never explained either way so we're able to fill in the blanks ourselves.

Everyone Dexter knows and works with finds out he's actually the Bay Harbor Butcher. The whole season should have been about Dexter on the run and everyone he knows dealing with the fallout from this revelation.
Dexter,3arbs4,denvertebows15,3,Mon Jun 22 22:57:26 2015 UTC,Yeah they fucked up big time.
Dexter,3arbs4,Slaytounge,2,Tue Jun 23 02:10:45 2015 UTC,Now that I think about it though they probably didn't do that one because that's how everyone expected it to end.
Dexter,3arbs4,denvertebows15,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:18:23 2015 UTC,Just finished the series a few days ago. That ending was terrible! Looked like a setup for a follow-up show/movie/special.
Dexter,3ap4nd,TheChipmunkSeesAll,13,Mon Jun 22 10:38:15 2015 UTC,I was still trying to recover from the hysterics of seeing Dexter stealing his sister's body from the hospital. That sort of dampened any emotional impact the rest of the episode could have had on me.
Dexter,3ap4nd,Sammiyin,4,Mon Jun 22 12:44:56 2015 UTC,"Yea it reminded me of the scene in Little Miss Sunshine. Though since LMS was a comedy it was funny, since Dexter was a drama it made no sense and just felt awkward."
Dexter,3ap4nd,HarryButters,9,Mon Jun 22 13:32:58 2015 UTC,"I did the same thing in the scene where Dexter unplugs her life support and she dies. I have never cried to a tv show or movie before in my life, but there was something about this scene that made me cry like a baby. And same as you, I didn't really like season 8 all that much, but her death really hit me hard man."
Dexter,3ap4nd,Knifferoo,3,Mon Jun 22 12:05:14 2015 UTC,"Same, Deb is the best ;_;  After everything she went through and she just dies, damn. It was a pretty nice ending for Deb though very emotional, as long as you don't think too much about the whole hospital thing and dumping her body in the ocean."
Dexter,3ap4nd,BlindStark,8,Mon Jun 22 22:33:03 2015 UTC,"I had to tear up a bit when Batista answered his phone and was like ""Dexter? No, that can't be"" or something like that. Damn."

Dexter,3ap4nd,Reverend_Twitch,13,Fri Jun 26 02:10:14 2015 UTC,"I just just staring in shock thinking ""what the fuck is happening right now?""  EverythIng was silent, dragged out...then...it was just over. There were so many open ends, and no closure.  I could handle ridiculous, but that was just straight up the most unsatisfying ending ever."
Dexter,3ap4nd,Starburstnova,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:21:30 2015 UTC,I'm with you.   I was honestly too pissed off at what how boring the season was and how poor the (supposedly) last episode ever was going to feel sad...I was pissed for days. One of my roommates noticed and decided season 7 was far enough for him. This added on to watching the amazing Breaking Bad final season was a real kick in the dick
Dexter,3ap4nd,ShadowSora,4,Mon Jun 22 21:38:13 2015 UTC,"I had pretty much the same reaction. I bawled during that whole scene. It was so final, and it really was an intense, emotional scene. And, despite the tears and despite my annoyance with the whole season to that point, I was actually even kinda happy with that ending. It seemed fitting. And then...the god damn lumberjack. Ruined the whole thing."
Dexter,3ap4nd,dubbas,5,Mon Jun 22 16:08:31 2015 UTC,"I know it's kind of become a meme at this point, but I never understood what difference it made what his cover story was. I mean, it's not like he could move to the pacific northwest and get a job as a blood spatter analyst again... He had to do something where he could work anonymously and normally... And there's a shitload of logging jobs in that area.  There's quite a few things off in that last season, but I never thought him choosing a lumberjack as his cover never irked me like it seems to have other people..."
Dexter,3ap4nd,Treedom_Lighter,3,Mon Jun 22 16:48:14 2015 UTC,"When I saw him as a lumberjack, I was expecting him to have moved to Minnesota and have started a life with Lumen. But then nothing happened and I was really dissatisfied with the ending."
Dexter,3ap4nd,mottflagosky,5,Mon Jun 22 19:59:45 2015 UTC,"Well Lumen was kind of out of the question, she was ""cured"" of her darkness with Dexter's help... So showing up again would do nothing but bring up a very dark time in her life.   At the time of the finale, he was all about Hannah and Harrison (and killing). The way I see it, if he was going to have to keep killing no matter what, he may as well remove himself from the people he loved before they all died because of him."
Dexter,3ap4nd,Treedom_Lighter,7,Mon Jun 22 20:07:15 2015 UTC,"See that's why the fucking lumberjack was so shitty. It seemed like he was cured of his desire to kill and the only reason he stabbed Oliver was out of vengeance. The ending doesn't make it clear whether or not he stopped killing, or became a lumberjack to continue on with killing."
Dexter,3ap4nd,mottflagosky,2,Mon Jun 22 20:17:12 2015 UTC,"Personally I believe if he was truly cured he would have just gone with Hannah and Harrison. I think part of what drove him to start a new cover life and let H&H go was that he realized he was never going to be able to stop. Oliver was in custody and would've gotten the death penalty one way or the other, but Dexter himself had to do it. So the best thing he could do was let the people he loved safely believe he was dead while he lived the only life he could on the other side of the world."
Dexter,3ap4nd,Treedom_Lighter,3,Tue Jun 23 13:12:54 2015 UTC,"It was never his choice of cover that bothered me...it was the fact that he DIDN'T die at the end. Not like I was rooting for his death all along, but they ALMOST gave us a beautifully sad ending with him sailing off into the hurricane because he realized that his need to kill wasn't worth putting the people around him at risk. It was almost the most tragically human thing we ever saw him do. But then...""meh, I REALLY like murdering people. So I'll just grow a beard and start over!"" It just felt like a cop out."
Dexter,3ap4nd,dubbas,2,Mon Jun 22 21:11:36 2015 UTC,"Okay yeah I can get that. That's a legitimate gripe with the direction the finale took, and I totally understand it."
Dexter,3ap4nd,Treedom_Lighter,4,Tue Jun 23 13:08:06 2015 UTC,"I just finished Dexter about 20 minutes ago and fuck I kinda agree. Remember knowing that it was the last episode so it hit me extra hard seeing how Deb would be the hero of Miami Metro. So seeing that boat scene was like a shock. Hero from the start and hero in the end. Dexter looking so devastated was another stab into the heart, don't think we've seen him that devastated throughout the series... As for the ending of the finale, him sitting in that secluded house... damn. It just left more doors open, no pun intended. Is he still a killer? Will the truth ever come out to Miami Metro?  Something that has received critique is how easily Dexter was let off after killing the Brain Surgeon. Imo it wasn't so weird that Quinn and Angel let Dexter go without too much questioning at the police station after he killed the Brain Surgeon, their connections always struck me as very deep and truly got to me. Angel and Quinn have always shown great character. All of this together made for a very emotional finale IMO so I wouldn't exactly say that it was horrible."
Dexter,3ap4nd,idkthisname1123,2,Mon Jun 22 21:09:04 2015 UTC,"Well I understand where you are coming from. I think my hate for the finale, besides the boat scene, ties into it being the unsatisfying end to a pretty bad season of one of my favourite shows, but the episode wasn't horrendous."
Dexter,3ap4nd,BeautifulKiller,3,Mon Jun 22 21:48:20 2015 UTC,"It was a roller coaster for my soul. At first Debra was well and fine, then she gets shot and I thought LAST EPISODE OH - FUCKING - NO YOU WON'T! then she gets her shit together again and I was relieved. But then I was over. I sobbed while mumbling but- but- whyyyyyy?  Alone the scene before he unplugged the life support, where the doctor tells Dexter. I couldn't believe what was happening. My brain didn't want to realize, so I thought he was crazy when he unplugged her.   I thought I wouldn't recover from Rita, but damn, that finale was a tough one. That was one thing I definitely DIDN'T expect to happen."
Dexter,3ap4nd,BlindStark,2,Mon Jun 22 20:09:15 2015 UTC,"That Quinn crying, damn."
Dexter,3ap4nd,MrMojo39,3,Mon Jun 22 22:36:11 2015 UTC,"Just finished as well... I thought the ending was interesting. His whole mentality changed when Deb wasn't going to make it.  He had the ""Im fine, people around me aren't in danger"" thrn realizes it most when she dies.   He saves his son and trusts Hannah. Sad ending but he starts a new life and new name, he did it all series long."
Dexter,3ap4nd,dtgl03,2,Sat Jun 27 21:09:11 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you. In fact, i have to start the show again. I don't want to remember Deb is dead."
Dexter,3ap4nd,Presto-Manifesto,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:23:19 2015 UTC,It's called crying out of extreme disappointment.
Dexter,3aqz0c,mottflagosky,3,Mon Jun 22 20:14:37 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with you. The finale felt like a wrap up episode for a good emding. But everything got flipped in the last 20 minutes of it and just made opinion change for so many characters. I never cared for quinn that much but I felt for him in the last episode. I felt so bad for hannah and Harrison knowing how he won't come to Argentina with them, and I loved how they showed how strong hannah was at the end for Harrison though. Dexter throughout the whole show I respected his decisions but the last one just abandoning his son and hannah to become a lumberjack, I don't think I went from loving a character to just hating him in the blink of an eye. He had so much growth as a character and as you said kind of became human, which was an 8 year growth. And have it just be thrown away in the last 5 minutes just completely wrecks everything about his character for me"
Dexter,3aqz0c,vikingsheat6,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:34:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you, at least someone recognized that. But I agree, the last 20 minutes were retarded, he could've joined Hannah and Harrison."
Dexter,3aqz0c,Munchsicles,0,Tue Jun 23 16:12:29 2015 UTC,Its been explained why we don't buy how he got emotions because of having his wife killed and having a son won't give him emotions i doubt some blonde can because she practices alchemy and kills people

Oh well, at least firing a pistol from your car can be somewhat discreet (By discreet I mean the rifle's barrel would have been visible outside the window to passerby), so it's got that going for it."

Dexter,3an2g2,Munchsicles,4,Mon Jun 22 21:31:10 2015 UTC,"He's someone with severe PTSD that was, instead of being treated, manipulated into a way for Harry try and make the world right.   He's not a psychology-textbook-definition sociopath/psychopath (which are the same thing), just someone who experienced a trauma too young and too severe to even consider opening himself up to anything but his defense mechanism which is his way of controlling the chaos, like Harry.  Throughout the series we see him actually develop a positive support circle that wasn't just raising him to use him like Harry and he started opening up until we see an almost-fully-realized human Dexter in the finale; but with emotionality comes irrationality; and you cannot escape your past."
Dexter,3an2g2,alsoye,2,Tue Jun 23 04:11:15 2015 UTC,"He's always seemed partial to being called a monster.  Hard to judge really - although he did seem murderous and stuff when he was a teen, who knows if he'd have grown out of it if his foster dad hadn't trained him (although maybe his mother's death mentally scarred him for life.)"
Dexter,3an2g2,alienfrog,2,Mon Jun 22 00:58:08 2015 UTC,"Psychopath would be someone that was born that way while Sociopath would be someone that became that way from their environment. So technically he would be a Sociopath since him and Brian/Rudy were affected by what they saw when they were kids. There are certain characteristics that go with both and Dexter is kind of on the blurrier line of it. Sociopaths/Psychopaths can still feel emotions, even though they may be ""shallow"". Actual psychologists don't even use these terms anyway.  He's just a victim of shitty writing."
Dexter,3an2g2,BlindStark,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:52:40 2015 UTC,"A neurotically damaged individual, or a psychopath with a tendency to care about things. He cries when he kils Brian so obviously on some level he does feel emotions, whether he believes it himself as a character."
Dexter,3an2g2,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:24:00 2015 UTC,He was an innocent child manipulated by a psychopath to act like one. Essentially Dexter is a victim of brainwashing.
Dexter,3an2g2,hurricanelantern,12,Sun Jun 21 21:07:04 2015 UTC,"Hardly an innocent child, Harry started teaching him shit when he was a teenager after he was killing animals for a while. Not to mention his brother Brian was also a murderer and wasn't raised to be one."
Dexter,3an2g2,Slaytounge,2,Sun Jun 21 21:15:06 2015 UTC,Dexter also got a brain scan in one episode and his brain fit the characteristics of Sociopaths/Psychopaths. They probably couldn't have changed his actual personality but they could have stopped him from hurting people if they tried. Instead they help him kill people and reinforce the idea that he's a monster and can't stop. I don't think he ever actually lacked emotions he just doesn't feel them as strongly as normal people.
Dexter,3an2g2,BlindStark,2,Mon Jun 22 03:10:02 2015 UTC,he was trained to survive. he was already a psychopath. you didn't really understand the show did you?
Dexter,3an2g2,SkaJamas,-2,Sun Jun 21 23:45:55 2015 UTC,He was a kid scarred by his mother's death (which was Harry's fault) he could have been treated but Harry convinced him he was an untreatable psychopath to manipulate him into being a killer.
Dexter,3an2g2,hurricanelantern,2,Sun Jun 21 23:52:00 2015 UTC,"his mother's death wasn't Harry's fault, she chose to get involved with them and she chose to help Harry.  You can't really fix someone like Dexter. it just can't be done."
Dexter,3an2g2,SkaJamas,2,Sun Jun 21 23:59:15 2015 UTC,Did you pay attention to the show at all? Harry only started seeking help for Dexter when he found the dogs Dexter had killed and buried in the backyard and found out he had the urge to kill he couldn't control.
Dexter,3an2g2,denvertebows15,-1,Mon Jun 22 04:02:33 2015 UTC,Harry never even sought to get it controlled. He decided to funnel it into vigilantism without ever attempting to get Dexter any psychological counseling.
Dexter,3an2g2,hurricanelantern,0,Mon Jun 22 04:16:39 2015 UTC,"Harry had Dexter see Dr. Vogel for psychological counseling. From there she determined that he was too far gone and there was no way to stop him from killing, so she decided to test out her theory to save Dexter's life. They only resorted to instilling the ""Code"" into Dexter when they realized there was no other way.   Its not like Harry wanted him to be a serial killer from the get go. Although I'm convinced you haven't even bothered to watch the entire series because if you did you'd know these key plot points."
Dexter,3an2g2,denvertebows15,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:27:13 2015 UTC,"Dexter never met Vogel as a child, Dexter asks her at one point why he doesn't remember her and she says they never met up until she sought his help with The Brain Surgeon."
Dexter,3an2g2,puuq,-1,Mon Jun 22 05:19:32 2015 UTC,"He can't be a psychopath because he can control his urges, and he cant be a sociopath because he grew to actually have feelings. Its simple he's just a serial killer with a conscience."
Dexter,3ajjqp,throw10away,-9,Sat Jun 20 20:36:30 2015 UTC,I notice more and more obese people literally everywhere
Dexter,3ahlki,_Decimation,12,Sat Jun 20 06:38:58 2015 UTC,"This has been explained in this subreddit a billion times, but here goes, again.  Throughout the series, Dexter wanted more than anything to be normal and to have normal connections to other people. But as a result of all the things he did to have those connections, he has lost everything, (Deb, his wife, and his son, and all of his friends). In the end, Dexter is now alone and isolated. It's a tragic ending (as in comedy vs. tragedy) in the style of Shakespearean plays like Othello or Julius Caesar."
Dexter,3ahlki,elmarko44,2,Sat Jun 20 14:56:33 2015 UTC,"Except it was executed in such a way that it came across as:  a) Bad writing.  b) Lack of fucks given.  c) No forethought whatsoever.  d) No thought on the consequences.  e) No thought on what the series was based around.  f) Terrible, bad, atrocious, ''never getting another job in TV'' levels of bad.  g) ''I hit my head really hard and forgot how to write halp pls.''  Pick one, they're all suitable answers."
Dexter,3ahlki,Erekt__Butthole,3,Sat Jun 20 15:18:14 2015 UTC,"a) Bad writing.   How is this ""bad""? Explain what you mean by ""bad"", and how you're qualified to make such a statement.   b) Lack of fucks given.   How do you know that there were no fucks given? What do you mean by this?   c) No forethought whatsoever.   Forethought? Are you talking about in the 6 prior seasons leading up to a finale? I'm starting to think you're just making words.   d) No thought on the consequences.   Consequences?  The last episode of a series  doesn't need to address consequence... it IS the consequence!    e) No thought on what the series was based around.   Well, like I explained, if you paid attention to the character development of the previous 6 seasons, and not just to the grisly murders, you'll notice that Dexter longed for connection. In fact, the series was based around Dexter's longing for connection. And in a tragic ending, Dexter's longing for connection is exactly what left him alone and isolated, and forever away from the people and things he loved.   f) Terrible, bad, atrocious, ''never getting another job in TV'' levels of bad.  g) ''I hit my head really hard and forgot how to write halp pls.''   Now you're just attempting to be clever.  Your assertions are without evidence, and therefore should be dismissed without evidence. And the irony is, your claims that the writing is bad is itself BAD WRITING. You don't just say that a villain is evil, you demonstrate through actions and dialogue that he is evil. You can't just say ""writing is bad"", you need to demonstrate with specific examples and comparisons that the writing is 'bad"".  Or maybe, it's just a little over your head..."
Dexter,3ahlki,elmarko44,10,Sat Jun 20 15:41:45 2015 UTC,"Oh god, someone's sticking up for Season 8 again...  Let's see.  I paid close attention to the character development in the first four seasons and yes, Dexter Morgan longs for connection. That much is so very clear. But please, oh wise one, tell me how a psychopath can be cured by a hot blonde and want to stop killing and cutting people up? Wouldn't something like the birth of your son have much more of a powerful effect over someone like Dexter regarding the control of killer impulses? You expect me to believe a man who LIVES to kill people, is suddenly cured because a woman who MEETS HIS CODE loves him? Not to mention that MCH and Yvonne have barely any chemistry on screen.  Now, onto the writing. Debra Morgan, a main character for 96 episodes, killed off screen. Debra Morgan, a character who in 8.01 is doing drugs and spiralling out of control, and in 8.04 driving her brother and herself into a lake, is completely fine by 8.05. Right.  A known serial killer who escaped from the care of the police who has an entire character dedicated to finding her dresses up in fucking pink dresses and flaunts around like she's got nothing to hide. Okay! Not to mention one of the worst scenes of all time, Harrison falling off a treadmill. Or should I say the obvious 40 year old stunt double falling off the treadmill, psh.  The last episode DOES have to address the consequences. The last episode of a series is crucial to wrapping up the story. Have you seen Six Feet Under, The Wire, Breaking Bad, The Shield? I'm guessing not.  Hannah, a wanted person, leaves the country with someone else's kid with no questions asked? Dexter survives a motherfucking hurricane? The cruel fact that Deb never got a funeral? Hannah injecting Elway on a bus and then announcing ''I just injected you with horse tranquilizer'' you know, just in case our dumb audience didn't get that. OH MY GOD I ALMOST FORGOT, add to the pile of fuckups: Dexter's VO. It went from insightful, beautiful observations from a very different individual to most of us, to becoming the narrator to the audience. Probably the most painful part of Season 8, actually.  The S1-4 writers would have never put together a final season in which Dexter does not get caught, barely kills anyone, that has close to zero conflict that anybody cares about or with such a half-ass ITK ripoff villain. How do I know this? Go read Clyde Phillips' ending. And please, do listen to what I'm actually saying. You ARE right that the show is about longing for connection. That doesn't mean the ending is fucking good though. The ending Clyde Phillips' put forward satisfies two things: Dexter is caught, which is the whole point of a show with somebody leading a double life (see: Walter White) and also, Dexter sees all of the people he had connections with as he is being euthanised and realises that he consumes everything around him, and that this is for the better. Dexter wanted to have it all and learned that he COULD NOT in the S4 (in my opinion, the series finale of the show) finale with Rita's demise at his hand. Why did we need 4 more seasons to reach the exact same realisation again?  The fact that they teased and flaunted for 7 seasons that Dexter would eventually be caught, and it never happened because Buck & Co. decided that it would be a much more interesting story if they turned a psychopath into a ''real boy'', is blasphemous. And yes, I say no forethought. If the master plan was to have Deb die off screen and become a vegetable, be dumped in the ocean, have Dexter ride off into a hurricane, survive, and end up as a lumberjack in wherever the fuck... I really don't know what to say.  Dexter stood outside a fucking cafe watching Saxon and was surprised when he realised that he had been seen and his tyres were slashed. For fuck sakes writers, Dexter has killed a ridiculous amount of people, WHY the fuck would such a careful and meticulous character not just wait in the backseat of his car with a garrote, as he has done so many times before? Sloppy writing all round. Or how about that ridiculously, laughably lazy example of writing with that bullshit facial recognition software Dexter uses? Or the fact that they have the perfectly logical plotline of having Batista investigating Laguerta's claims about Dexter, which would cause REAL TENSION, but they decided not to because fuck it, Masuka's daughter needs more screen time. And damn Quinn, that Sergeant's exam was definitely a nailbiting plotline!   And please, do not give me that bullshit excuse of ''character development''. Character development is having Quinn's shady past come out over the season, or Quinn dealing with Christine's death. I mean wow, take a look at how much Dexter grows every single season in 1-4, and then begins to stagnant COMPLETELY and become a boring character. He goes from a controlled killer to a father, husband, friend/brother (even if for only a short time) as well as the themes that go with all this. S1 you have his past, his brother, born in blood. S2 you have dealing with his mother's death, dealing with Harry's death, having a midlife crisis, being investigated by his own sister. S3 you have Dexter become ''an idea transcended into life (2.12)'', have a true friend and finally accept his father/becoming one himself. S4 you have Dexter asking ''Can I have it all? (4.01)'', being a family man, father to three children, husband to Rita, while still balancing the DP. All of these seasons add greatly to Dexter's character.  Season 5 didn't really add much to Dexter's character past the first episode. Season 6 was based around religion and Dexter was like ''I'm not religious.'' At the end of the season, you guessed it: he was still not religious. Zero character development there. Season 7 he was the same old boring Dexter spiced up by the fact that Deb now knew, but still, besides killing Estrada he really didn't grow much at all. Season 8 he grew feelings and that's where the show died for passive viewers, dedicated fans, and critics alike. Not to mention that Dexter's ''development'' was also surrounded by such starling subplots like Zach, who was killed off just as he gained the slightest modicum of potential, or Masuka's daughter/Sergeant's exam/Elway/Jaime plotlines that have no place being in a final season.  There we go, is that enough for you? Because I can certainly keep going. Oh and excuse the occasional typo, it is 3am in my small corner of the world.   A little over my head.   No real need to be like that, come on now.  Can't wait to hear complaining about my use of profanity."
Dexter,3ahlki,Erekt__Butthole,7,Sat Jun 20 16:36:31 2015 UTC,"THIS is a well written and well thought-out post.  And the truth is, I agree with about 85% of the things you're saying.    I don't take issue with your opinion. I did, however, take issue with the unsupported opinions (e.g. ""lack of fucks given"", etc.).   otherwise, I take back the ""over your head"" comment, and I look forward to seeing more well constructed and thoughtful opinions like this."
Dexter,3ahlki,elmarko44,6,Sat Jun 20 17:11:42 2015 UTC,"Well shit, that was a completely different response to what I thought I was going to receive.  Thank you for that. Civility is a great thing.  I've thought long and hard about the show overall, hence why I only watch S1-4. Honestly, I just wish Clyde Phillips never had a family. Kidding, but I do wish that he stayed on the show for the extra 1 or 2 seasons and convinced Showtime to finish the show off properly. If he hit the final season out of the park, which I have full faith that he would have, Dexter would have gone down in television history for being such a fresh, daring innovation of for the industry. Instead, it's tarnished by the ending and most people sadly have to say when recommending the show to others ''just watch the first four seasons.'' Or then again, maybe it was always completely doomed? Showtime could have just fired him if he refused to do any more seasons, and it was learned that Showtime would not let the S8 writers kill Dexter under any circumstances... Maybe the show was always doomed to not end well?  Phillips leaving after S4 would be like, hypothetically, Vince Gilligan leaving halfway through Breaking Bad and having the show handed over to extremely inexperienced writers. It was always going to fail. If only he stayed on for the extra year or two and finished what he started..."
Dexter,3ahlki,Erekt__Butthole,2,Sat Jun 20 17:17:06 2015 UTC,"I think many ""tryhard"" ( who doesnt even dear shit on the show except the ending )  Dexter fans concede to your points. Very well written criticism and reading this, seriously blew off some steam that i had regarding this show  ( did not want to insult the show just knew it was wrong in someway )  In my opinion S6 wasnt terrible at all, it was just... filler. The villain was well thought as well as the theme and at least S6 tried to change Dexter. Nothing too exciting and it didnt really progress the story, but far from being bad."
Dexter,3ahlki,deylath,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:29:12 2015 UTC,"That's not even close to everything I have to say about S5-8 still, even after that huge essay. Between Dexter surviving getting thrown in the ocean, Gellar twist being figured out weeks early, the nonsensical realisation that Dexter got Travis off a police surveillanced building, somehow, and even the huge plot hole that Jaime represents as a character. All it takes is one off hand comment to Batista about how hard Dexter works and he'd be in trouble.   Then S7, rebooting the entire plotline with 3 episodes left in the season. Having Dexter kill people in airports (this made my blood boil) and naming an episode ""Buck The System"" made me hate Scott Buck past what I thought was possible before. Deb/Dex is also brushed over for Hannah, the worst character and plotline in the show, which ruined any chance of redemption for the show by this point.   Oh and S5 gets the award for humongous fuck up by having Dexter caught by Deb except... he's behind a big sheet of plastic so she can't tell who he is! Brilliant writing guys, now we have another year of filler to throw in before we do the exact same ending! Yay. Not to mention completely disregarding Rita after the first episode, like what the fuck?  So yeah. S1-4 only is the best way imo."
Dexter,3ahlki,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:46:41 2015 UTC,"I can understand where you people coming from with that season 4 is the real end for Dexter, but i wonder. Wouldnt you be pissed if the series would have ended just like that? ( with Rita's death ) Or all the reason on the hate is the FACT that after S4 the show's writing become ""unrealistic"" and unfocused?"
Dexter,3ahlki,deylath,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:02:47 2015 UTC,"You have to look at it another way. Dexter's biggest adversary bests him, and leaves his son born in blood just like him. It's a full circle ending if you look at it the right way and see it as a definitive cycle for Dexter."

Dexter,3agju1,Munchsicles,16,Fri Jun 19 23:45:57 2015 UTC,"The ending was poorly executed in every single aspect of the story.   They reused shots from other seasons.   They had a known criminal who had an entire character dedicated to finding her dress up in flamboyant outfits with no attempt to disguise herself.   They completely shit all over Deb's character.  Saxon was a boring ITK ripoff.   They killed Deb OFFSCREEN, completely ineffective way to kill off somebody who has been in every episode.   Somehow Hannah just leaves the country with a kid that isn't hers.   We leave the realms of reality as Dexter kills someone with a pole through a bed.   No build up whatsoever.   Dexter using the most laughable facial recognition software of all time because the writers were too lazy for him to figure it out any other way.   Dexter kills 1 fucking person in his ritualistic style the entire season, and it was offscreen.  And worst of all, Dexter is cured of wanting to kill people and cut them up into fish food because he's fallen in love... somehow. Even though psychologically he is incapable of that but whatever.  The writers completely forgot that the ENTIRE appeal of this show is that Dexter is a serial killer who kills other serial killers and he keeps up a great facade in order to do so.  Season 8 instead was: I love Hannah ARGENTINA ARGENTINA PSYCHOPATH PSYCHOPATH PSYCHOPATH  Also, Dexter finds out he has a brother, gets married, has a child and is yet STILL a psychopath who wants to kill people. And I'm supposed to believe that meeting some blonde who meets The Code suddenly changes Dexter's entire brain and he suddenly has feelings now? If anything could do that to him, it would be the birth of his son, not some stupid blonde the writers decided was a cure for psychopathy.   This is why S1-4 was the leading vote on the canon poll. The writers of 1-4 knew the characters and what they realistically would or would not do, and that's what made those seasons realistic, funny, believable, intense and brilliant. It's also why I only watch 1-4."
Dexter,3agju1,Erekt__Butthole,5,Sat Jun 20 02:59:28 2015 UTC,"He completely loses his funny jokes and inner monologue in the end, so disappointing. I thought the pole through the bed kill was badass and the scene where he kills Saxon and clicks the button and Quinn is like ""yep looks like self defense"". It's a shame the shittiest villain of the whole show pretty much ""outsmarts"" Dexter and causes Deb to die.  There is scene where Dexter is watching Saxon through a window wearing the brightest god damn shirt ever, right in plain sight and in broad daylight. Saxon already knows who Dexter is and what he looks like, he even knows what car he has.  Dexter, the guy who literally stalks people for a living somehow decides this a good idea and totally inconspicuous. He also has the great idea of parking right next to Saxon's car. So when Saxon runs out because he obviously saw Dexter he slashes his tires. They really did change the characters entirely."

Dexter,3agju1,BlindStark,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:15:55 2015 UTC,"Another bad thing about this season (and maybe some others) is that for some reason even after learning that getting too attached to other people is not good for him, HE STILL FUCKING DOES IT."
Dexter,3agju1,LFrodriguez9,4,Sat Jun 20 14:20:06 2015 UTC,"I think I read somewhere on this sub before that the season itself wasn't too bad, it actually built good suspense and foundation for the climax, but even the very few among us who liked the idea of the finale concede it was very poorly executed. I think that sums it up nicely."
Dexter,3agju1,alienfrog,2,Sat Jun 20 00:40:11 2015 UTC,"I agree. The ending leaves room for speculation, and let's me believe what I want to believe about what happened. The season itself was amusing for me."
Dexter,3agju1,BurkleeG,2,Sat Jun 20 01:52:26 2015 UTC,the first half was good. but the second half was rushed and plot lines are completely abandoned. the acting was bad and it didn't give the series the finale it deserved.

He left after S4.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Buck  This guy is the reason that 6-8 was so bad. Not only was he the showrunner from 6-8 but he also was the one who brought in the Deb loves Dexter arc, as well as the terrible ending. Pray he never works on TV ever again."
Dexter,3a0j5s,Erekt__Butthole,-1,Tue Jun 16 08:01:44 2015 UTC,"I have a hard time worshipping Phillips. Yes, the show was better under him but I feel like the series had a lot of writing problems when he was there too. I felt like it was already on a downward slide well before Scott Buck arrived."
Dexter,3a0j5s,ArtimusClydeFrog,9,Tue Jun 16 13:07:32 2015 UTC,"Still, he's the guy that outlined every single season in 1-4. He's the guy who convinced John Lithgow to join, and he was responsible for pretty much everything in terms of story direction.  Would you mind detailing what you meant by the writing problems? The only writing problems that I noticed were things like half-aborted arcs in S3 like Yuki Amato. That's really about it though. I'll never get the hate for Batista & Laguerta, from the first few episodes of the show I thought they definitely had a certain chemistry together that could be romantic, and was not surprised in the least when it happened in S4. Besides that, I only felt the writing lacked a few times in S3, and that was the writer's strike year.  Moving on though, S5 had no Phillips and you could tell, but it also didn't have Buck at the helm, and it was much better than the hugely flawed S6. Buck was such a huge step down in quality almost immediately, much in the same way Phillips' absence was.  I really don't think he had many flaws as a showrunner. Between ITK, Dexter vs Doakes, Trinity, Miguel, BHB case... he struck gold many times over, a gold that Buck never did. DDK twist was figured out online plus Travis Marshall was horrible compared to the show's past villains. TBS was absolutely atrocious and felt like a really cheap ITK ripoff at times (grew up in a mental institution, released, got a new name, connected to Dexter or someone close to Dexter, did weird things to bodies and displayed them publically etc.) Isaak was good until they killed him off way too early in the most pussy way possible... God damn it Buck.   PLUS, Phillips actually had a fitting ending in mind and recognised that the show had teased Dexter's capture and that it needed to deliver on it, much like the arc Breaking Bad took in its final season. Buck, on the other hand, thought it was a better arc to have a blonde serial killer who fit Dexter's code to seduce him and somehow make him feel human feelings. God motherfucking damn it Buck. Some fun facts about Buck: He thought S8E10 was the first time Dexter had cried (has he even seen the first 4 seasons?!) and he also said the show was hyperrealistic (again, has he even seen the first 4 seasons?) Around S8 time, many people were questioning on this sub as to whether he has even watched his own show before, and I really doubt it.  Essay over, I apologise."
Dexter,3a0j5s,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:27:23 2015 UTC,do you know what Phillip's final season would have been?
Dexter,3a0j5s,footwith4toes,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:34:49 2015 UTC,"Judging by things he said in his AMA and also the ending he revealed he would have used, the final season would have dealt with Rita's death, Deb finding out, Quinn investigating Dexter, Dexter being found out and finally Dexter being euthanised as he looks out over the viewing room and sees everyone whom he has killed or whose lives he has destroyed. I imagine the final line would be ""Tonight's The Night."""
Dexter,3a0j5s,Erekt__Butthole,2,Sat Jun 20 02:49:23 2015 UTC,"I think Dexter still had some great seasons after 4, including 5 and 7 most of all (out of 5-8). However, the execution of the finale season, like how Dexter tried to hunt Vogel in broad daylight by standing outside a restaurant and grilling him for two straight hours then clumsily following him to his car only to find his tires slashed. Seasons 1-3 Dexter would have been hiding in his backseat and had a piano wire around his neck as soon as the key went in the ignition.  As well as leaving Vogel alone in a room right next to all of his knives for Deb to go in and arrest him on her own. He knew damn well how dangerous this guy was and he took absolutely no precautions to protect his sister whom he allegedly loved more than just about anyone. Little things like this added up and added up (especially in the second half of the season) and left people feeling like it rushed and dragged out the finale simultaneously, which left many people very unsatisfied with the ending.  I don't think the general plot for the season finale was too bad, and I loved the surprise of Dr. Vogel producing the drawings that Dexter had made as a child. Unfortunately it was probably the high point of the whole season."
Dexter,3a0j5s,Treedom_Lighter,2,Tue Jun 16 17:50:49 2015 UTC,"They were rushed to get the last season done.  Seasons 1-7 aired August/September to about November/December.  8 aired that summer so they didn't have the same amount of time as the other seasons for writing, casting, filming, editing, etc.  Such a shame they had a bad ending for a terrific show."
Dexter,3a0j5s,todd330,2,Wed Jun 17 01:39:55 2015 UTC,"I just finished season 4 and decided to stop here. Never have I been so heartbroken because of a season finale.. Oh dear god, I'll never watch a show again :("

Dexter,39tpq2,prestico23,6,Sun Jun 14 19:03:14 2015 UTC,The Great: 4- Trinity storyline couldn't have been better 2- Doakes was great and Lila was just hot enough for me to get over her awful she was. 1- The one that started it all. Wasn't perfect but was very good.  The Good:  7- Great rebound season. Didn't like the ending but everything else was very solid. 3- Solid if unspectacular season. Prado was a good character but season was pretty eh. Sandwiched between the two best.  The Bad 6- Hanks wasn't a believable bad guy and Dex/Deb ruins it. 5- Rita's death mishandled and Dexter/Lumen wasn't believable.  8- I just try and pretend this didn't happen

Dexter,39tpq2,abhpro,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:28:47 2015 UTC,12743568  I honestly REALLY liked season 7. Even more than Trinity even though the season 4 finale was by far the best finale. I feel like Debra's character was handled really well and her arc seemed realistic for someone who found out their only family member is a serial killer. And then the writers shit on everything with season 8. I just pretend Deb kills Dexter in the container at the end of 7 and it's not so bad.

The Dexter who loves to eat while driving but doesn't like not being able to employ the 10-2 hand position on the wheel. Season 7 - Deb finds out! Love the first couple of episodes.  Season 3 - The skinner was interesting. Loved the conversation Dex and Miguel had before he kills Miguel.  Least favourites:  Season 4 - Creepy Trinity, Rita dies, Baby Season 8 - Just no Season 6 - Travis  Season 5 - I hate Jordan Chase"

Dexter,39t77s,hectorzeroni69,2,Sun Jun 14 15:36:01 2015 UTC,6 months.
Dexter,39t77s,Team_Realtree,2,Sun Jun 14 19:56:12 2015 UTC,"Currently on a rewatch myself, finished it like 3 months ago. Season 1 was a great season to rewatch as you understand much more and you can actually dig a bit deeper into the show."
Dexter,39t77s,AppTux,2,Sun Jun 14 21:47:45 2015 UTC,"I started rewatching it right after I finished it, so about 30 seconds. But I only re watched the first 3 seasons, then I just kept rewatching seasons 1&2 lol"
Dexter,39rc22,Erekt__Butthole,8,Sun Jun 14 00:18:53 2015 UTC,"Laguerta would be dead.  Maybe a spinoff where Dexter takes trinitys son under his wing.  The fact that he doesn't have a lab would make finding serial killers that much harder. Almost to the point where I begin to think it just can't be done. I can see something like the first season he's the lumberjack, under an alias. Next season he's someone else, like a hermit crab. Have you seen Taking Lives? This is a great example. He just takes different roles. The people he steals the identities from are the serial killers that he's taking out and that were never caught or even in any criminal database. Somewhere along the show someone familiar recognizes him and he's on the run. Or perhaps that someone can aid or assist him after him coming clean and explaining himself.   It has to be done right."
Dexter,39rc22,Harleyhounddog,2,Sun Jun 14 05:27:07 2015 UTC,I'd rather not see Trinity's son under his wing.  What they could do is make Dexter conflicted and start killing good and bad people. He wouldn't have to worry about hunting down serial killers when he can kill anyone. Giving him an interesting plot that could last multiple seasons without him getting caught could be hard though.
Dexter,39rc22,BlindStark,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:54:55 2015 UTC,I don't really see Dexter as someone who kills innocent people willingly unless he has a very good reason. What made him interesting and the show interesting was his particular code.
Dexter,39rc22,Harleyhounddog,3,Sun Jun 14 21:19:24 2015 UTC,"If it had dexter in it as the main character, would it technically be a spin off? It would just be more dexter.  Spin off would be a show following another character from the series, like better call saul is to breaking bad.  But I do think a spin off could be plausible. Maybe some new person who was influenced by dexter in person, from afar, or the news.  Dexter would be their Harry essentially."
Dexter,39rc22,shruber,2,Sun Jun 14 07:26:20 2015 UTC,You'd probably call it a soft-reboot since it would keep some continuity but change everything else.
Dexter,39rc22,BlindStark,2,Sun Jun 14 10:59:24 2015 UTC,"I agree. I'm thinking maybe a Brian moser spinoff, which would be his mental institute days, and how he got off. Basically his life as a serial killer but also an amputee doctor (sorta like Dexter being a splatter analyst). The show would be a lot darker obviously. His Harry would be Dexter and Brian's mom. She would be a darker soul than Harry."
Dexter,39rc22,Harleyhounddog,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:23:27 2015 UTC,That would be awesome!
Dexter,39rc22,shruber,2,Sun Jun 14 23:40:15 2015 UTC,"To live up to Dexter's standard, your first idea would have to have a really good plot because if he's not contacting family again then he hasn't really got anything to lose so you'd have to go through the whole meeting new people that he cares about. He also wouldn't be a blood spatter analyst so finding other killers would be a bit harder which could also make it more interesting actually. With your second idea, it's more of just an idea for a final season which obviously... sounds way better than the actual finale."
Dexter,39rc22,Subulie3,2,Sun Jun 14 05:09:49 2015 UTC,"They should do episodes where the audience is following the point of view of a random serial killer. We get glimpses of Dexter stalking, then awkwardly trying to build a relationship with them. It would be so fun watching a killer walk around thinking they are top of the food chain, all while anticipating when Dexter is going to make his move. Sweet justice."
Dexter,39rc22,austinrks,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:15:15 2015 UTC,no spin off is required. Clyde Philips as showrunner with a smaller group of writers should be hired to give the show the final season that it deserved. Keep Scott Buck on as a consultant
Dexter,39rc22,adiman93,5,Sun Jun 14 08:26:49 2015 UTC,"Scott Buck should be thrown off a bridge, I'd rather have a person that's not completely retarded consult for the show."
Dexter,39rc22,BlindStark,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:01:56 2015 UTC,"I think a film or 2 parter would be better, darker style, not Mr likeable moral compass Serial killer but living up to what he really is at his core.  A full series is a bit much, I'm sure these actors got a bit sick of doing their characters for such an amount of time, people move on."
Dexter,39rc22,huetoob,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:00:50 2015 UTC,"If they wanted to make a spin off that didn't fully star Dexter, it could go like this. It'd have like 3 plots going on at once: one could follow Astor, Cody, Harrison, and Hannah and show how either happy or terrible their lives are now. Another storyline would follow a new cast of characters; another police precinct investigating a series of creative murders, and a new killer who is the main character. (Maybe these guys are in the north west somewhere, where ever Dexter is hiding out.) Then you have Dexter. Maybe one of the new characters meets this mysterious guy living in the woods by himself and begins to figure out who he is. A continuation of Dexter's story could unfold from there. And then eventually all the plot lines would connect."
Dexter,39rc22,Presto-Manifesto,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:27:57 2015 UTC,I think a crazy series finale for your 3 point idea could be a season where dexter decides to track down hannah and harrison in Argentina only to find that his son has become a reckless killer. He is faced with the ultimate decision of keeping harrys code and killing his son as his new alias or lletting him live and kill other innocent people and piss on a name dexter gave him for all that harry did for him.
Dexter,39rc22,weguccison,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:36:52 2015 UTC,"That is pretty neat. Would definitely make for some gripping television. I would think it'd be cooler if Dexter quit following the Code and kind of became absorbed by the dark passenger. You know what I mean? Like he is purely what he is, no BS. But since he still cares about his family, he needs to protect them (only Harrison really. I guess the step kids too.) But yeah, if he sought them out only to find that they too were killers would be kinda cool."

Dexter,39pzvu,Never-asked-for-this,4,Sun Jun 14 11:59:57 2015 UTC,Thank you people for your recommendations.   I liked season 6. The plot was interesting until they ruined it by making Debra having Dexter as her love interest. So could someone answer me about the love plot? A simple yes or no will do.   I'll most likely take Ghoulrot's advice and drop the two last seasons if they keep that plot going.
Dexter,39pzvu,Knifferoo,0,Sat Jun 13 18:11:40 2015 UTC,"Iirc it stays, but it's not that prevalent, it only really comes into play towards the end as it influences some of Deb's decisions. Not really that extreme though. I don't think it appears much at all in S8 either. I might be wrong though, so correct me if I am."
Dexter,39pzvu,RespectThyHypnotoad,-4,Sat Jun 13 18:33:45 2015 UTC,Thank you.  Then I won't bother with the two last seasons. Time to move on and watch something else.~
Dexter,39pzvu,RespectThyHypnotoad,6,Sat Jun 13 19:09:23 2015 UTC,"You should watch season 7, it's the best of 5-8 and I personally think better than 3. The love story was terrible, but it doesn't really stick around. They dilute it,explain it away. For creating such a bad sub-plot they dug themselves out of it pretty well. You should watch the next season. It sets up for a great final season that sadly doesn't come.   Deb is one of the large reasons why season 7 is so good."
Dexter,39pzvu,BlindStark,2,Sat Jun 13 19:49:47 2015 UTC,"""RespectThyHypnotoad"" Your name made me chuckle.  Now I'm having second thoughts...  I like Debra's character, she is  always so strong willed and stubborn about what she want. It's great to see a female character like her, that can be bossy and smart without being made into a bad person. She was one of the characters that fast became my favourite and one of the good reasons I kept watching the show."
Dexter,39pzvu,footwith4toes,2,Sat Jun 13 22:12:39 2015 UTC,"She's the best part about the last seasons, Jennifer Carpenter did a fantastic job growing with her character. Absolutely keep going. Even in the huge disappointment that is season 8 she works great with what little she has to work with."

I don't like the last minute...and season 8 took a bit for me to get into, but...if you've made it this far, it's worth finishing. The end is disappointing, but you shouldn't avoid it.

Dexter,39k5i8,tobinoxdz,1 point,Mon Jun 15 13:54:10 2015 UTC,Yeah well Nebraska was smart enough to name a state long enough that no one bothered to make the name into a joke like the Idiots Out Wandering Around. Also Council Bluffs is the biggest shit hole in the world and probably in the top 5 for most inbreds living in one city.

Dexter,39k5i8,D168,-9,Fri Jun 12 14:39:12 2015 UTC,"If Vince Gilligan had directed this shot, it would have been much more subtle, had foreshadowing to it the entire episode, and you wouldn't even fully understand it until the next season's finale, in which you cry all over again when you remember it...   And that's why it would be praised as a stroke of tv-making brilliance."
Dexter,39k5i8,Slaytounge,2,Fri Jun 12 15:37:00 2015 UTC,I totally missed this. Thank you
Dexter,39k2l6,mikeramey1,8,Fri Jun 12 07:32:14 2015 UTC,"Not really. I think what you mean is that Deb is Dexter's parallel, and that while he fakes his emotions, she has them on display for the world.  ""My sister puts up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable she is. Me, I put up a front so the world won't see how vulnerable I'm not.""  Deb is Dexter's contrast or juxtaposition. Much like how Rita brings out the humanity in Dexter, Deb exists to do the same thing but in a different way, which is by being his complete opposite. This leads onto the other characters, like Batista, who is an example of the type of person Dexter would be if not for his past, or Doakes, who is an example of somebody the same as Dexter but is yet on the good side of the spectrum whereas arguably Dexter is on the other. Masuka really just exists to compliment Dexter's dry wit, especially during the BHB investigation. Laguerta is just, eh, Laguerta. She's a decent character for what she is in S1-4, and she has some good arcs, like her manipulation in S2 or the whole secret about Miguel with Dexter in S3, and unlike everyone else, I thought her romance with Batista made complete sense and on first viewing it felt like natural progression to me. I pretty much always felt like they had tension between them from the first season.  But yeah, every character around Dexter exists to add to him or contribute to him, and this extends to ITK, Trinity, Lila and Miguel too. Dexter walks away from them with huge development as a result (I have a brother, I can learn to hide my passenger from my family, I can have a midlife crisis, I can have a true friend for the first time in my life...) And ultimately, the lesson he learns in the end is that I cannot have any of this, I can have none of this, and I can lose everything.  Deb definitely isn't the main character, and I guess that is my point."
Dexter,39k2l6,Erekt__Butthole,3,Fri Jun 12 08:06:25 2015 UTC,"Well obviously the show isn't based on her but she is a main character just as Dexter is. She appears in every single episode and is totally my favorite character. She goes through a whole bunch of changes which are pretty awesome. At first she starts off unsure of herself but progresses into a more confident individual, Dexter really helps her out. She goes through a whole bunch of pain throughout the series and horrible relationships but still manages to pull through. I was writing a list of all the stuff she goes through but after season 4 it was really long so I just deleted it. She has to deal with something really bad in pretty much every season which affects her character greatly making her stronger or more fucked up. It's a shame we may never get to see her again, Jennifer Carpenter did an amazing job. Now where is my Debster spinoff series where Deb starts killing fuckers?"
Dexter,39hcid,lah2011,49,Thu Jun 11 18:46:13 2015 UTC,"I feels you whenever debra asks dexter somthing she insists on a answer but when dexter Asks her anything it goes like this  ""Where were you last night deb""-Dexter  ""A friends house""-Deb  ""What friend"" -dexter  ""GEEZUS DEX WHAT ARE YOU MOM NOW"""
Dexter,39hcid,Munchsicles,40,Thu Jun 11 19:34:51 2015 UTC,"She is one of the best characters on the show, it will show later"

Dexter,39hcid,imglencoco,18,Thu Jun 11 19:19:19 2015 UTC,Lila is the worst.
Dexter,39hcid,ChupacabraIsMyFriend,13,Thu Jun 11 20:55:35 2015 UTC,"Lila is a cunt, not much more to be said. I think Deb actually becomes more of a character later on and less of a swearing machine."

Dexter,39hcid,threep03k64,3,Thu Jun 11 22:12:20 2015 UTC,I liked her early on. Didn't like her so much in the later seasons but to be honest there were few characters I liked in the later seasons anyway.
Dexter,39hcid,TheJDK,3,Thu Jun 11 23:52:53 2015 UTC,I wasn't a huge fan of her either but her progression throughout the whole series is really interesting. I didn't notice it as much until my rewatch but pay attention throughout the whole show.
Dexter,39hcid,MissFunkyH,3,Fri Jun 12 04:26:44 2015 UTC,"Every time I watch the serie over again Rita just keeps sounding worst than before, complaining... At least Deb is constant"

Dexter,39hcid,Presto-Manifesto,3,Fri Jun 12 08:25:04 2015 UTC,She is annoying at first--almost turned me off to the show during the first few episodes--but she definitely gets better. And she gets hotter in the later seasons.
Dexter,39hcid,mikeramey1,2,Fri Jun 12 08:35:00 2015 UTC,"I'm only half way through season 2   Don't worry, she'll be dead by the end of season 2... just kidding, Deb has one of the really good character arcs in the show. She may have the best story of all the characters."

Dexter,39hcid,CSGOWasp,2,Fri Jun 12 07:44:17 2015 UTC,"Gotta agree with this guy. She was annoying as hell at first, and I literally just finished the series last night, and she had easily become one of my favourites"
Dexter,39hcid,BloodyRedBarbara,5,Fri Jun 12 17:09:53 2015 UTC,My favorite character easily. I like her for the progression. I didn't realize she was my favorite until 3-8 probably
Dexter,39hcid,bbb19,4,Fri Jun 12 00:33:07 2015 UTC,I finished the show hating her so...sorry. You'll probably get more annoyed with her.
Dexter,39hcid,therus,5,Thu Jun 11 21:10:52 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you. Apparently, some people think she's a dimensional and complex character because she says fuck a lot."
Dexter,39hcid,huetoob,0,Thu Jun 11 23:35:38 2015 UTC,Debra is hands down the worst character in the show. It makes me dislike the show entirely.. almost
Dexter,39hcid,LFrodriguez9,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:35:01 2015 UTC,"I felt like I had to endure Deb all the way from season 3 onwards. Her mannerisms were very freakish, I need to make a compilation some time, the way she pronounces words and grimaces in a crazy way. Nervous smiling at random moments spoiling the tension in a scene.  There was a lot of bad acting in this show, unfortunately the worst actress was centre stage, almost became the central figure. Not Dexter himself. All her love interests crap. Who gives a flying fuck about that shit? Also every time she swore (a thousand times at least), it just looked like someone who's not used to swearing, trying to act hard. (I know in the book she swore, the actress was pathetic) So the endurance test has ended. Just finished the last episode just now.  I kept on hearing people recommend it all over the net and people I know. I did like the show a lot, even with all the tedious side stories but the actresses playing Deb and Rita-the-child-woman totally spoiled the enjoyment factor. I dreaded them coming on screen. It's that bad."
Dexter,39hcid,y8u332,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:48:17 2015 UTC,"Hmm its strange you should mention Rita. I'm only on season 3, but I like Rita at the moment though there's plenty of time for that to change.  I completely agree with everything you said about Deb though. I don't know if it's the character or if she's just a bad actress. Either way, any scene with her just makes me uncomfortable. The over-the-top unnecessary swearing is cringe inducing, I hate how obnoxious she is all the time. She does this awful shit eating grin too and often I have to look away.   Dexter is a great show, but Deb makes it almost unwatchable for me."
Dexter,39hcid,WeaponexT,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:46:11 2015 UTC,I feel like she is very self centered and in many times oblivious to stuff around her.
Dexter,39hitn,imglencoco,5,Thu Jun 11 19:24:20 2015 UTC,"Lila is like a natural disaster.   Instead of hating a character, you should try and value them for what they add to Dexter's character. This period of indulging in a crazy woman was like Dexter's midlife crisis. And quite frankly, Dexter's never had a crisis before. Each season (in 1-4) explore some aspect of Dexter and he learns a huge lesson by the end of each season. Lila was a well-written and developed character that you weren't ever necessary supposed to like.  What's wrong with some conflict? Nothing more unpredictable than a psychopathic woman."
Dexter,39hitn,Erekt__Butthole,5,Thu Jun 11 21:43:01 2015 UTC,"As much as i don't like lyla It got me annoyed when deb called her trampy for the pardon my tits scene deb wasn't supposed to be home yet but when dexter walks in on deb fucking some guy she just met, AGAIN she asks confronts him the next morning for coming home to HIS apartment early when be wasnt supposed to come home yet."
Dexter,39hitn,Munchsicles,3,Thu Jun 11 21:05:46 2015 UTC,"no, you're right, that's true! doing that kinda shit is one of the reasons why I don't like Deb but lila's still gross and I support Deb with that lol"

Six Feet Under however, that theme was unskippable for me. Plus it's like half the time as the Dexter intro."

Dexter,39elo6,ChupacabraIsMyFriend,3,Thu Jun 11 16:12:28 2015 UTC,Do you think it took inspiration from American Psycho's title sequence? I'd love to see Hannibal do a light promo with the same concept!

I love that music, if it's on I'll leave it on every time. In season 8, or with the downloads I got, they would show you clips of the next episode, as if that's a good idea? Scandalous if you ask me, so I couldn't get to enjoy my end of show moment in peace."
Dexter,39elo6,LFrodriguez9,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:05:43 2015 UTC,I haven´t skipped any episode either. For some reason when I am in the middle of watching the 8 seasons it is like my senses sharpen all day long. It is a strange but amazing addiction.

Dexter,39dllf,SetFireToTheRane,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:16:37 2015 UTC,That's not the reason. Although that is a good point.
Dexter,39dllf,ChadFromWork,3,Thu Jun 11 16:06:31 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, people are upvoting the guy who revealed the spoiler and downvoting people complaining about it. Let's just think for a minute, what could that mean? What might that behavior reveal to someone in your specific situation?"
Dexter,39dllf,cRavenx,-2,Fri Jun 12 15:32:46 2015 UTC,"That my current behavior is not seen as ""positive"" within this group. I've studied my share of sociology, I know my shit.  Do I give a shit about being downvoted, tho? Nope."
Dexter,39dllf,bennyschup,5,Thu Jun 11 19:16:41 2015 UTC,"No, that's not it. I'll back it up a bit further. We're in a subreddit for the show Dexter. Some guy commented about how on the show the main character Dexter gets arrested and replaced by Debra. So now we have a show called Dexter where the main character is Debra and Dexter is no longer involved. Again, the show is called Dexter.  Ok, back to the comments. This spoiler is being upvoted while the people complaining about the spoiler are being downvoted. Is there anything else you might be able to deduce from that?"
Dexter,39dllf,SetFireToTheRane,3,Thu Jun 11 19:21:46 2015 UTC,I find this whole thread hilarious.
Dexter,39dllf,ChupacabraIsMyFriend,3,Thu Jun 11 19:30:37 2015 UTC,"If you just started watching it, why go to a sub that is specifically for the show and read posts about episodes in the seasons? Just finish watching it and report back"
Dexter,39dllf,SetFireToTheRane,-5,Fri Jun 12 15:30:08 2015 UTC,"... Yeah I'm unsubbing from this now definitely.  You know, you have subs about longstanding shows like GoT where you DON'T have spoilers or at least you have to do it in a way to warn it and hide it properly or you're banned.  Maybe I came here to discuss shit other than ruining the episodes ahead of me?   What a ridiculous mentality for a sub about a tv-show, christ."
Dexter,39dllf,ChickinSammich,3,Thu Jun 11 13:26:15 2015 UTC,"If you just started watching, you don't really have anything to discuss. What are we going to discuss, the evolution of Dexter Morgan's footwear? A poll on who wore the nicest hawaiian shirts?  Who had better hair, Masuka or Doakes?"
Dexter,39dllf,SetFireToTheRane,-2,Thu Jun 11 13:29:08 2015 UTC,"Christ.  This show JUST started playing on one of our channels where I live, I knew nothing about this show before, I seriously watched four episodes so far, I decide to check the subreddit and bam.  Downvoted because  A) I don't want to be spoiled B) I didn't know the series was done already  Great community you've got here.  The books of GoT have been out for years, I don't see anyone on GoT subs spoiling them."
Dexter,39dllf,ChickinSammich,3,Thu Jun 11 16:03:00 2015 UTC,"As someone subbed to both shows and a fan of both:  Game of Thrones is still an active TV show and the mods of that sub have strict anti-spoiler policies on how spoilers need to be marked for book/show/speculation, and the mods actively police spoilers and remove them because that is how they have chosen to run that sub.  Dexter has been over for years, and the mods of this sub have taken a far more ""hands off"" approach with the assumption that 95% of the people on this sub have finished the show.  If you want to better understand, I'll point out that even the upvote/downvote buttons on this sub (hatchets) are actually a spoiler, but I won't spoil anything by telling you why.  The rules DO say ""no spoilers"" but that rule is very rarely enforced.  For what it's worth, I will tell you that the post you replied to is not actually a spoiler and was a joke.  So nothing was spoiled for you.  You're safe.  I hope you enjoy the show, and I hope that when you finish it, you can come back here and complain about how the writing went downhill and how certain characters suck.  Until then, the sub is dark and full of spoilers. :)"

Also each sub has rules, maybe the GoT sub has rules about it. And I know you have already been told, but seriously, I don't mean this in a rude way, but I would recommend avoiding the sub if you've just started watching. Nothing good comes from it because 1. You're just going to get everything spoiled and 2. The most you can do is watch because if you've watched just 4 episodes there isn't much discussion to be had."

Dexter,3971of,Yaka95,15,Tue Jun 9 18:46:12 2015 UTC,"Hannibal starts off like that and is very beautiful. We have Will Graham an unstable man who can understand killers almost too well. The FBI asks him to be a special agent for them to help solve very elaborate killings. They don't want him to get too close so they get a psychiatrist to help him, that psychiatrist just so happens to be Hannibal. It just gets crazier from there. The first season or two is mainly about them trying to solve the crimes but all the killings play into the story very well. It's also just one of the best shows on TV. Though I'm sure there are other shows that are mainly about just solving random crimes every episode like CSI? Maybe? I'm not sure which are good since I don't usually watch those."
Dexter,3971of,BlindStark,4,Tue Jun 9 19:46:30 2015 UTC,"You know, I keep hearing how fantastic that show is. I tried watching the first episode, but I just felt so disconnected...it was so serious. I liked Dexter for the dark humor and the charm. Hannibal didn't seem to have either of those things. I'm sure it's a fantastic drama, but...I dunno.  I really want to try watching a bit more before I judge, but...I just got no motivation to agree watching the first episode. Dexter had me absolutely hooked from the start."
Dexter,3971of,Starburstnova,2,Wed Jun 10 02:23:11 2015 UTC,"I've heard from a few people that it's hard to get into from the start, but now it's their favorite show. Though I didn't have that problem, maybe because I binge watched the first season. The first few episodes mainly introduce the characters and you won't realize the importance of the episodes as much until later. Every episode plays a significant part in the story and it's really awesome how they all tie in to each other. They make it seem like a normal procedural type show at first but completely switch it up later. I think if you watch through it more you'll like it. It's much Darker than Dexter in both the show and in humor. You really should watch more than one episode though, those are mainly just so you understand the characters and get attached to them. The cinematography is amazing and it's almost like watching a movie, the characters are all portrayed by amazing actors, and story is just awesome. The show is pretty wild after they start showing Hannibal more, and the season 2 finale was one of my favorites of any show. That first episode actually plays a huge part, so I'd just watch the first few episodes one after another if you can because it really is a terrific show."
Dexter,3971of,BlindStark,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:46:31 2015 UTC,"I'm sure I'll try watching it again sometime. Maybe soon.  It took me forever to get into Buffy and that ended up being one of my favorite shows, so my first impression isn't always the best judge. ;)"

Dexter,3971of,Psychopath-,3,Sat Jun 13 02:36:53 2015 UTC,"You really should. It's beautifully made and amazingly cast and compelling and brilliant in every sense of the word. You wouldn't think someone could take such a well-known franchise with a character portrayal as iconic as Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal and make something so true to the source but unique enough that you really can't predict what's coming next. It doesn't remain a police procedural, though the first two seasons are still very much an FBI drama in part, so maybe give it three or four episodes if the first one doesn't quite pull you in."

Dexter,3971of,ChupacabraIsMyFriend,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:31:10 2015 UTC,"There are two ""police"" shows I am really liking at the moment, Hannibal and The Blacklist.  The Blacklist: Highly wanted criminal turns himself in to work with a specific agent to catch criminals that have passed under the FBI/Police's radar.  Hannibal: This is pushing it a bit, as I don't consider this show a real police show, it's about the history of unstable FBI profiler Will Graham, and his psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who unbeknownst to almost everyone around him, is a highly proficient serial killer and cannibal. Early season 1 is more of a cop drama, then later it turns into the story of Hannibal and Will. My best attempt at describing it, though I really can't explain it, it's just good.  EDIT: My Hannibal description sucks and /u/BlindStark's is much better, read his."

He realized the only way he could not hurt the ones he loves would be to live in solitude. It makes him one of the most tragic tv characters ever. He doesn't even have his inner monologue at the end. Its his ultimate punishment. Yes it would have been great for him to have been caught and for the audience to see how that played out but at least we got Deb finding out."

Dexter,399h4a,CSGOWasp,0,Fri Jun 12 00:38:45 2015 UTC,They would never listen to a petition for something small like that unless they wanted to reboot the show anyway. Not to mention you are assuming they'd make it any better than what we already got. I'd rather have them just get some really good directors and writers and make something new with Dexter. Forget everything that happened in the previous seasons and just start with a blank slate with brand new actors except for Michael C. Hall maybe. They'd have to come up with a good story though and I'm not really sure where they would take it since Dexter has pretty much lost everything. Plus I miss Deb and if it doesn't have Deb I'll be sad ;_;

Season 6 is a major trainwreck. Although, to its credit, Season 8 is easily 10x worse. Bring on the downvotes, you cannot compare S1-4 to any season afterwards and that's a fact.

Dexter,38uinw,mbdjd,8,Sun Jun 7 06:21:28 2015 UTC,"It comes to life and is the main antagonist of the first new season.   We first meet the bench in episode 2 when Dexter is stalking his next victim in a park. Dexter needs a break so he decides to take a seat on a bench (the bench that could totally crush his ass). but Deb calls him before he can sit down and tells him he needs to get home so they can do their before kill ritual of beers and steak. Dexter is walking to his car when he notices in the side view mirror the bench rushing for him. He rolls to the side but bench Laguerta manages to bust his kneecap and pin him down on the ground. Dexter syringes the bench luckily though and manages to escape before anyone notices. (He would of taken the bench but it's a heavy ass bench so he has to leave it.) Later on Dexter and Deb get together and end up throwing the bench in their wood chippers (they need two people because it's mad heavy) (like really heavy where you need like two people) (like seriously) (also the wood chipper can cut concrete) (Dexter graduated top of his lumberjack class so he gets cool lumberjack shit that can cut concrete.)   This all happens in 10 minutes and the rest of the episode is a very long sex scene.  Also all (this) is narrated by Harry, key lime pie ghost, and Brian, also Harrison but only when Deb is running on a treadmill. Elway is also the ghost antagonist who tries to stop them from narrating but he gets blow up in a cabin. (Which is a totally sick parallel/reference/metaphor/something deep sounding to when Doakes died if you can read between the lines; you'll only notice it if you are really smart tho.)  There is also a scene where Aaron Paul aka Jesse Pinkman from the hit show Breaking Bad comes in and meets the main antagonist. He drives by and yells ""Gatorade me, Bench!"" And then cries for 30 minutes and drives away. It's also raining at the time because rain is cool."

Dexter,38uinw,switchn,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:27:55 2015 UTC,I want to see an alternate 5th season ending where Deb catches Dexter and Lumen behind the plastic.  Then a final 6th season with Dexter on the run and everyone finding out his secret (how the 8th season should have been).
Dexter,38zhqi,darkpassengerrep,10,Mon Jun 8 03:38:45 2015 UTC,Ok
Dexter,38zhqi,HappyGilOHMYGOD,9,Mon Jun 8 03:53:50 2015 UTC,"Good, as a Nigerian princess i'd like for you to write in the script that the finale was just a dream.   Also, send me $1 billion dollars, and i can double your money. I can't personally pick up the check for $1 billion dollars, but if you give me your address one of my servants will pick this up for me."

What's gotten into Dexter, and does it have anything to do with the strange disappearances of members of Miami's largest gang? Deb has a mystery to solve, before she finds herself on the wrong side of a crime scene investigation!"

Dexter,38aiqh,loljksure,21,Tue Jun 2 23:18:28 2015 UTC,"He did have trouble with it (at least he was supposed to, from reading the books).  But she also didn't fit the code that was drilled in his head since he was a child.  Brian did.  So it wasn't really Deb vs. Brian, but Brian vs. everything he's ever* known."
Dexter,38aiqh,Castor1234,6,Tue Jun 2 23:42:23 2015 UTC,Yeah Dexter grew up with Deb and spent more time with her. Dexter only has a few old memories of Brian because he was so young. If Brian wasn't forcing Dexter to kill his own sister they could have been friends. They are both practically his family but Brian was forcing things Dexter wasn't ready for too fast. If Brian took his time and didn't try to kill Deb they could have been best buds.
Dexter,38aiqh,BlindStark,15,Wed Jun 3 04:58:55 2015 UTC,He said if he could love anybody it would be Deb in episode 1. His sacrifice of sparing Deb and killing Brian shows that he is more than just a murderer like Brian and can love. At least that's what I think.
Dexter,38aiqh,BaconAllDay2,3,Wed Jun 3 00:50:31 2015 UTC,"I always thought of it as he did have feelings for Deb.   I know he says he's a hollow monster from the get go, but I honestly thought that's just what he thinks about himself. I didn't quite think of it as true, and when this scene happened, I pretty much believed that he did think of her as his sister and his family.   He saved her because he liked her.   You could argue he saved her because she didn't fit the code. I suppose that works. In my opinion though that's why Brian wanted him to kill her. What excitement could one get from killing someone without a code? Dexter could have found out quite easily.   And it was tempting, but the thought of losing his sister... losing family, was too much for him. He had feelings for her, even if he doesn't want to admit or acknowledge those feelings."
Dexter,38aiqh,Sillycomic,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:16:13 2015 UTC,(Before I type this I swear this is nowhere near as big of a spoiler as it sounds... Okay now.) If you'd prefer it went that direction you should read the books.
Dexter,38aiqh,cam5478,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:12:44 2015 UTC,"Deb didn't fit the code. Plus he had a deep connection even he didn't realize was there at the time. He loved her despite his lack of emotion. Who would you rather have in your life? Someone who you've known for only a few months at most, or someone you've known your entire life? The fact he could be himself didn't matter, he still was more connected to Deb than he ever could be to Brian."
Dexter,38bir8,SyphiliticMonk,3,Wed Jun 3 03:39:47 2015 UTC,Yeah I would say that it would be implied that he offed the poor thing.
Dexter,38bir8,dtc121,2,Wed Jun 3 04:48:21 2015 UTC,Well he's not actually a TV repairman so yes the assumption is he went back and killed her. She knew what he looked like so that's why he killed her or just because he's a serial killer. At the end the old lady was yelling at Rudy but no one noticed which almost got him caught.
Dexter,38bir8,BlindStark,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:52:13 2015 UTC,I'd assume he made quick work of her to cut any loose ends. She could have been really keen and somehow let Dexter know.

Dexter,387290,Ledwick,8,Tue Jun 2 13:46:25 2015 UTC,"You were assigned a topic on which there is little to no information available to you using reasonable means? That sounds like it's entirely the teachers fault. When I was in school, I reacted to situations like this one by either asking for a new topic, or simply choosing a new topic and writing on it under the belief that one well written paper on the wrong topic was better than one poorly written paper on the right one."

Dexter,387290,lvhitch,6,Sat Jun 6 14:15:20 2015 UTC,"South Florida resident and author Jeff Lindsay has cashed in with four novels and a smash Showtime television series, DEXTER,  based on his writings.  Lindsay created Dexter Morgan, a Hannibal Lecter in sheep's clothing...a monster who cringes at the sight of blood...a serial killer whose golden rule makes him immensely likable.  He only kills bad people.  The Showtime series began its third season in September  2008.  The show and actor Michael C. Hall were nominated for 2008 Emmy Awards. A 2008 showtime publicity photo of Hall and the Dexter company is pictured above. Lindsay, who resides in Cape Coral near Ft. Myers, Florida,  has worked as a writer for more than 20 years.  His wife is author Hillary Hemingway, daughter of Leicester Hemingway, Ernest's younger  brother. He has written poetry, plays, films, and television shows as well as songs.  He plays in a band named WILDFIRE. Born on 14 July 1952, Jeff Lindsay came into the world as Jeffry P. Freundlich.  Many of his earlier published works included his wife as co author.  Another of his pen names was Jeffry Lindsay.   Not a great source but better than nothing: http://bandp-book-dealers-int.com/jeff_lindsay__dexter"
Dexter,386e9n,Mlg123,8,Tue Jun 2 04:24:37 2015 UTC,Some schools have programs where you can register your fingerprints on the police database in case of emergency. Or getting a job where you require fingerprint scanning. That information had to be stored somewhere.
Dexter,386e9n,Tesatire,2,Tue Jun 2 06:02:17 2015 UTC,"Exactly, Trinity is pretty old so they probably didn't even do it back then. I remember them taking fingerprints at my school though when I was really young."
Dexter,386e9n,BlindStark,2,Tue Jun 2 07:04:45 2015 UTC,"Yep, your fingerprints can be scanned for all sorts of reasons.  I signed up for the Big Brother program as a mentor and I had to have my fingerprints taken so now I am in the database."

Dexter,384fkv,SolomonReed,7,Mon Jun 1 19:55:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, and there are 2 possibilities for why it was all nice and near in the next episode. Either Trinity made the family clean up and replace the window ( he probably would have had them because of the 4 walls 1 heart foundation). The other possibility is that that the writers made a continuity error."
Dexter,384fkv,Strang404,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:05:41 2015 UTC,Yes I just found it somewhat odd that Trinity would be able to find the exact same container for his sisters ashes.. Must have been continuity error.
Dexter,384fkv,Slaytounge,7,Mon Jun 1 20:10:13 2015 UTC,"It's pretty obvious that it actually did happen. When Dexter comes back later looking for Arthur he looks at the vase and then to Jonah and Jonah says ""It's like Thanksgiving never happened."" or something like that. So they address it."
Dexter,384fkv,ej00262,3,Tue Jun 2 00:28:01 2015 UTC,"I just rewatched this season 2 days ago I think and noticed that it was odd to have another vase so quickly. I just assumed it was so important to Arthur that he'd be able to find an identical replacement quickly.  Regarding whether it happened, I'd say yes. I don't think it would make sense for all the other stuff to have happened and not the meltdown. His pinky was still broken, the Mustang's wind shield was still shattered, he knew about the coffin, etc."

Dexter,381qc9,unique_id,13,Mon Jun 1 10:35:36 2015 UTC,Agreed.  You generally can't just leave the country with someone else's kid that easily.  I had to sign affadavits out the ass so my daughter could go on a vacation to France with her mom.

Dexter,381qc9,BlindStark,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:07:57 2015 UTC,"If so, maybe the fake passports listed the two with the same last name, so it looked like mother and son?"

Dexter,381qc9,CyanPancake,7,Wed Jun 3 15:32:09 2015 UTC,"I never even realized Aster and Cody weren't in the finale, that's frustrating"
Dexter,381qc9,frating,12,Mon Jun 1 17:23:21 2015 UTC,"Not a plot hole at all. They'd presume Harrison was with his dad. They thought Dexter died because they found the wreckage and he was missing so they'd assume the same for his son. There is no way they could look into it and find out Harrison is with someone unknown, and no way to connect him to being with Hannah since they don't even know he's alive. They don't even show anyone's reactions just Hannah reading an article on her iPad and then going to get ice cream, which is a major reason why people didn't like the finale."
Dexter,381qc9,BlindStark,18,Mon Jun 1 10:56:05 2015 UTC,Didn't Elway see Hannah with Harrison on the bus before she tranquilized him? Wouldn't he have said something?
Dexter,381qc9,PoemOfBragi,2,Mon Jun 1 11:49:22 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah it slipped my mind because she tranquilize's him and they never show what actually happens to him. Plus I never really cared too much about them. I have no idea if Elway would try to go after them or not but I'm sure he would say something. That's actually a pretty big loose end that never crossed my mind. I feel like they would assume Dexter could very well be alive and with them too since they never found a body. I have no idea what the laws are in Argentina or if they could even go after her though. If we go by season 8 then she'd probably get busted though since she can't even dye her hair or buy a pair of sunglasses to hide. They'd have no idea though unless Elway said something, OP's post threw me off because he made sound like they'd just make the connection out of thin air. Another thing to add to list of problems with the finale I guess."

Dexter,3814ng,xtunasaladx,9,Mon Jun 1 02:16:32 2015 UTC,"I think that's when Harry was becoming less ""dream like"" the Dexter. He wasn't this hero, this incredible, all knowing force. He was a man with flaws and Dexter was almost beginning to resent him. That's if I remember the time line of the show correctly in terms of what happened in each season"
Dexter,3814ng,jamieblakely,4,Mon Jun 1 05:06:37 2015 UTC,"Dexter started to resent him in Season 1 when he found out he had a brother. This continued in S2 when he said he was an idea transcended into life, no longer strapped to his fathers code. From S3 he doesn't even celebrate his father's birthday and kind of resents him.  All of that is over by the time S5 comes around. He understands why his father was the way he was once he has a child himself, and there's no more ''my father sucks'' talk from Dexter after that."
Dexter,3814ng,Erekt__Butthole,2,Mon Jun 1 06:19:32 2015 UTC,What about when he finds out in S8 that Harry and Vogel pretty much created Dexter and his dark passenger?

Dexter,3814ng,Erekt__Butthole,14,Mon Jun 1 21:37:14 2015 UTC,They got lazy. Harry was ruined when Dexter physically shoved him out of the way. The writers forgot that he was just a figment of dexters imagination
Dexter,3814ng,FedoraTipper15,8,Mon Jun 1 02:35:42 2015 UTC,Well couldn't it be that he represents something much deeper in Dexter?
Dexter,3814ng,monsters_from_ash,3,Mon Jun 1 04:10:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just Dexter's progression? He's more in touch and in control of his own feelings, so he sees Harry more a reality than a dream.   Then again, maybe the producers just got lazy."
Dexter,3814ng,monsters_from_ash,2,Mon Jun 1 06:14:01 2015 UTC,"Contains [spoiler]  I think that too because in the later seasons when the ""dream"" effect is gone Harry is much more vivid and can interact with the environment, also because after Dexter [spoiler] drowns the man brother Sam asked him to forgive we saw an appearance of dexters uncontrolled dark side which was represented by Brian his elder brother who he killed. When Harry was briefly replaced by Brian, because Dexter believed he had given into his darkness, Brian rarely left and was very interactive and even controlling in the environment but only around Dexter."
Dexter,37wtsn,Strang404,20,Sun May 31 01:40:52 2015 UTC,Could also be related to 24.
Dexter,37wtsn,provoaggie,21,Sun May 31 01:43:17 2015 UTC,Or Chuck.
Dexter,37wtsn,jessers25,6,Sun May 31 03:05:23 2015 UTC,I'd rather this. Her character kicked ass on the newest season. Alot better then Hannah McKay anyway.
Dexter,37wtsn,AntMan6,1 point,Sun May 31 02:01:16 2015 UTC,"Much more likely, 24 has had a lot more active buzz and rumors surronding it."
Dexter,37wtsn,RespectThyHypnotoad,6,Sun May 31 18:06:47 2015 UTC,Who's spinoff would it be?
Dexter,37wtsn,monsters_from_ash,9,Sun May 31 01:42:56 2015 UTC,Here's a teaser trailer.
Dexter,37wtsn,Deradius,1 point,Sun May 31 11:21:29 2015 UTC,Haha yeah
Dexter,37wtsn,monsters_from_ash,4,Sun May 31 14:50:21 2015 UTC,Trinity's? I'd watch that.
Dexter,37wtsn,Oh_Sullivan,10,Sun May 31 04:49:54 2015 UTC,The books and the show starts to become VERY different after the first season of Dexter. Some rumors i've heard was that they would make a revival where they follow the books.
Dexter,37wtsn,MyNamesNotObama,4,Sun May 31 04:52:16 2015 UTC,Hmm that would be interesting
Dexter,37wtsn,monsters_from_ash,1 point,Sun May 31 04:59:01 2015 UTC,So they would just start all over staying true to the books?
Dexter,37wtsn,frating,4,Mon Jun 1 17:24:43 2015 UTC,Even if it was a spinoff do you really think they'd bring her back? It would probably focus on Dexter's new life.
Dexter,37wtsn,BlindStark,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:11:05 2015 UTC,I'd assume her and Dexter would cross paths eventually in his new life
Dexter,37wtsn,FourCylinder,2,Wed Jun 3 02:45:26 2015 UTC,"if Hannah's in the spin-off, I don't wanna watch it :/"

Dexter,37wtsn,dukefan15,1 point,Sun May 31 18:26:38 2015 UTC,It could also be Chuck or 24 related. I definitely wouldn't jump to conclusion of it having anything to do with Dexter.
Dexter,37wtsn,NO_KINGS,1 point,Sun May 31 23:14:46 2015 UTC,Yes.
Dexter,37wtsn,flashfrost,-1,Mon Jun 8 04:19:28 2015 UTC,"I really hope it's not Dexter related. I loved Dexter but halfway thru the 7th season I stipped watching, it just wasn't the same show anymore and I lost interest"
Dexter,37wtsn,avengingangele,19,Sun May 31 13:31:49 2015 UTC,Season 7 was pretty good...
Dexter,37wtsn,crackalac,-5,Sun May 31 14:44:31 2015 UTC,"How many seasons are there? I know I stopped on the 2nd last one, I couldn't keep going, mostly becauseof Deb honestly."
Dexter,37wtsn,avengingangele,6,Sun May 31 15:43:42 2015 UTC,8 And Deb is my favorite character.
Dexter,37wtsn,crackalac,0,Sun May 31 15:52:10 2015 UTC,"Doubt it, usually they would make an announcement before it would be filmed"
Dexter,37s0z1,H4ZD4M4N,4,Fri May 29 22:40:50 2015 UTC,"The first book and first season share the same storyline, for the most part.  The ending is vastly different, and from there the books and show take completely different paths.  So no, there's no Hannah McKay, there's no Miguel Prado, there's no minor characters that don't exist within the first season/book."
Dexter,37s0z1,falkerman,3,Fri May 29 23:36:53 2015 UTC,"I may be in the minority here but I loved the books. I read them all. With the exception of the first book,  they're all around quite different from the show but in my opinion, very worth reading."
Dexter,37s0z1,lady_grok,2,Sat May 30 00:51:46 2015 UTC,"The first season is loosely based on the first book. From there the two go in very different directions.  I would caution you not to read them. After the first one, the one you ""already watched"", they get real bad. Cuthulu-esque demons and the like."
Dexter,37s0z1,TheBroox,1 point,Fri May 29 22:52:05 2015 UTC,I only got to the third book (which was pretty bad) but I love the second one abs how different it was. I'm told by everyone that's read them to just push through the third add bad as it is because the rest are worth it.
Dexter,37s0z1,thisisbeethoven,-1,Sat May 30 17:37:00 2015 UTC,"Have you read the one where he has drug addled sex with an underaged girl in the everglades?  They are all bad following the second one.  Stop watching the show after season 4, (season 5 if you just can't). Stop reading after the first book."
Dexter,37s0z1,TheBroox,2,Mon Jun 1 13:58:03 2015 UTC,"I've already seen the whole show and no, I haven't read that one but thanks for the spoiler. As bad as that sounds I've been told they're pretty good minus the third book so I intend to read them."
Dexter,37s0z1,thisisbeethoven,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:53:51 2015 UTC,Awesome show. So-so novels.
Dexter,37s0z1,DarthTyekanik,1 point,Sat May 30 01:41:58 2015 UTC,"The books follow the same general theme of the TV seasons in terms of what Dexter has to deal with or discovers about himself, but the plots are entirely different starting about 30 pages before the end of book 1"
Dexter,37s0z1,Pointwest418,1 point,Sat May 30 02:04:15 2015 UTC,"The books are worth reading, they kinda feel as though they're written for kids/teens but if you like the show then its worth trying them."
Dexter,37s0z1,AphexTwinnn,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:51:49 2015 UTC,"I actually just finished the first book and I loved it! Will be continuing with the series, should be very interesting given what happened."
Dexter,37ptna,Never-asked-for-this,3,Fri May 29 13:21:21 2015 UTC,The only time this happened in Breaking bad was the second to last episode of the series.
Dexter,37ptna,Scapone22,9,Fri May 29 15:42:40 2015 UTC,"I don't really see how you can compare the two.  Dexter was a likable character whereas Walter's only redeeming quality was ""anything for my family"" even if it's the absolute worst possible decision he could ever, ever make. Much like Cersei from GoT.  Breaking Bad built up to an ending that wrapped everything up in a neat package considering all the bad decisions Walt made up to that point to get his money to his family.  Dexter built up to an ending where Dexter magically survived a natural disaster. It was quite possibly the worst way you could've ended it considering everyone knew he had to either get caught or get killed."
Dexter,37ptna,Ashenspire,1 point,Fri May 29 16:06:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think those were the only two options at all. I fully admit the execution of the plot in the second half of season 8 was lazy and just plain bad at times, but I always hoped he'd find a way to move on to a different place and start over again as opposed to getting caught or killed.   The only exception I think is if they did what I wanted season 8 to be about: Miami Metro hunting Dexter Morgan - the Bay Harbor Butcher. We could've watched the inner-workings of the police station trying to find him and the moves Dexter made to stay ahead of them, and Deb's turmoil trying to decide how actively she pursues him if at all.  But, since they didn't go that direction, I think it was kind of awesome to have him get a new cover in a totally different location... I just wish they showed the actual steps or inferred them somehow instead of ""wrecked boat in the middle of the ocean in a hurricane = lumberjack."""
Dexter,37ptna,Treedom_Lighter,2,Fri May 29 20:23:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with the first sentence so much, there were so many other endings possible. On the top of my head   Him killing Harison (or not) and then killing himself because he knows he cant control himself when pressured (the guy in the bathroom after Rita's death) Him and Debra coming together (sick) Him being discovered (perhaps by stabbing the brain guy with a bit more madness, which then reveals to everyone who he really was Him running off (and not being a lumberjack)   So there is many other ways it could have ended, but i think the series didn't attempt to build up any 'ending' except for season 2"
Dexter,37ptna,MyNamesNotObama,1 point,Sun May 31 05:00:07 2015 UTC,"Season 4 was an 11-episode build-up to the finale so I can't really agree with that last bit... But yeah... It could've used something more, or something else... Or something."
Dexter,37ptna,Treedom_Lighter,0,Sun May 31 14:49:22 2015 UTC,"Killing or capturing Dexter would have been fucking retarded. It may not have been the perfect execution, but it was way better than those two alternatives.  By trying to share the monster he destroyed everyone around him AND had to live with it. I am so glad they didn't pussy out and wrap it up neatly like people wanted."
Dexter,37ptna,matttrick,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:14:59 2015 UTC,"Deb or Angel killing Dexter, depending on how they handled it, easily could've been the best way to end the series."
Dexter,37ptna,Ashenspire,0,Mon Jun 1 01:19:52 2015 UTC,Please tell me how that would be good?
Dexter,37ptna,matttrick,3,Mon Jun 1 01:26:00 2015 UTC,"I see you reasoning, but I can't agree.  Walt was doing everything for his family, but then diverging more towards Heisenberg as time went on. Only realizing his mistake in time to ""fix"" things.  Dexter was doing everything for himself, but then diverging more towards family/belonging as time went on. Only deciding against it at the last minute so he could ride a hurricane to Oregon."
Dexter,37ptna,Reddit_Executive,1 point,Fri May 29 19:00:31 2015 UTC,"I just finished the series and was thinking along the same lines, however, Dexter wasn't caught nor killed. I wanted that to be the way it ended, the whole last season felt forced and I definitely though Batista would be the one to kill him, but whatever floats there boat I guess."
Dexter,37nsj2,denvertebows15,5,Fri May 29 00:18:44 2015 UTC,I've been dying to read it
Dexter,37nsj2,J3wfro,4,Fri May 29 00:53:33 2015 UTC,Its definitely worth it!
Dexter,37nsj2,DeJaVath,5,Fri May 29 01:11:48 2015 UTC,"I thought the same exact thing. I don't want to spoil anything, but there towards the end of the book everything takes a completely different turn and makes for an interesting read. If I would have read the book prior to watching the show Doakes' ""Surprise"" scene would have been more of a surprise for sure."
Dexter,37nsj2,J3wfro,2,Fri May 29 01:48:40 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I was thinking. I did not expect that ending. I figured it wouldn't end like season one did, but I did not expect what happened."
Dexter,37nsj2,LegendaryGrunt,3,Fri May 29 03:07:43 2015 UTC,How many books are in the series?
Dexter,37nsj2,ik1020,5,Fri May 29 01:13:31 2015 UTC,There's seven right now. There's an eighth and final book being released in July though.
Dexter,37nsj2,TrustMeImLeifEricson,4,Fri May 29 03:03:02 2015 UTC,"I had no idea there was an eighth until reading your post. I'm so excited now. I thought final cut was the last book and I was upset, not just cause of there being no more story but because the last book wouldn't have had a D title. Thank you for informing me, I just preordered it."

Dexter,37nsj2,OceanCarlisle,2,Fri May 29 02:15:29 2015 UTC,"I waffle on whether I like the books or the show more. The books are  much darker, no contest."
Dexter,37nsj2,PlatonicTroglodyte,2,Fri May 29 05:19:58 2015 UTC,"The first 6 books are all pretty good. Dexter is Delicious is my favorite... but Dexter's Final Cut ruined everything for me. It felt like none of the characters were 'in character', and acted in ways I found contradictory to what the character stood for. I don't have high hopes for the last book any more."
Dexter,37nsj2,PlatonicTroglodyte,1 point,Fri May 29 13:40:22 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately some of the writing get's less good in the later ones, but the first two were my favourite. 4 was good too actually"
Dexter,37nsj2,OceanCarlisle,2,Fri May 29 06:43:31 2015 UTC,"I agree. I remember liking the first a lot, but then I either couldn't finish the second or third one and just gave up on them. It was a while ago, but based on your comment, I'm going to guess it was the third I didn't like."
Dexter,37nsj2,beckoning_cat,1 point,Fri May 29 12:47:36 2015 UTC,Really? I hated the book. I was surprised they were able to make such a good show out of it (at first). If I had read it first I would not have bothered to watch the series.

Dexter,37nsj2,monsters_from_ash,1 point,Fri May 29 15:35:27 2015 UTC,"I found it short, uninteresting, one-dimensional, and not unengaging, particularly in comparison to season 1."
Dexter,37nsj2,OceanCarlisle,1 point,Fri May 29 16:32:26 2015 UTC,"I liked the first book, but still thought the show was better. A complete anomaly as a general rule the book is always better than the movie or TV show, yet this one broke the mold."
Dexter,37nsj2,Minor_Tom,1 point,Fri May 29 16:42:40 2015 UTC,One dimension is a good way to describe them.
Dexter,37nsj2,monsters_from_ash,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:20:00 2015 UTC,Show is much better quality than the books. Books are kind of simple really. The only thing I wish they did in teh show was have Brian look just like Dexter.

Dexter,37chav,BulletsWithGPS,25,Tue May 26 16:48:11 2015 UTC,He does break his own hand to escape the skinner at the end of season 3 because he was highly motivated to keep living to see his son.
Dexter,37chav,Andrado,26,Tue May 26 19:17:25 2015 UTC,What shitty character development that he ends up abandoning his son.
Dexter,37chav,possiblyhysterical,12,Wed May 27 04:59:36 2015 UTC,"I don't really see it as abandoning his son, he knows that his family would never be safe with him around so he sent them far away and went in the other direction for their own good, not out of selfishness. I agree the character development was pretty bad, though, because in season 4 when Trinity leaves his family, Dexter swears he would never do that."
Dexter,37chav,Andrado,2,Wed May 27 05:23:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Argentina was his paradise, that was his reward for all his hard work. If anything it was making up for all his selfishness and destruction he caused."
Dexter,37chav,Nushuktan-Tulyiagby,1 point,Wed May 27 05:26:04 2015 UTC,"I agree as far as Rita's two kids went. But I mean, he left his son in the hands of another known (to the audience, at least) serial killer, didn't he? That doesn't seem like the best idea, honestly."

Dexter,37chav,TQQ,7,Fri May 29 21:36:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know what everyone else is saying, I constantly thought this when watching the Saw series. Who is the ultimate serial killing mastermind?"
Dexter,37chav,IrelandSully,2,Tue May 26 20:57:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I was thinking all the time... what would dextor do in this situation. For me the killing mastermind is jigsaw."
Dexter,37chav,TQQ,2,Tue May 26 21:02:18 2015 UTC,"does jigsaw ever directly kill people though? this is an honest question, i havent finished the whole series (dont worry about spoiling it for me lol)  if the answer is no, then i'd definitely say dexter is the better killing mastermind, but jigsaw wouldn't necessarily lose because he is obviously a strategical genius. and a good strategy beats brutal force and cunning virtually every time."
Dexter,37chav,dukefan15,1 point,Fri May 29 21:50:15 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly he didnt directly kill people but he forced people to kill themselves, so basically he is a murderer."
Dexter,37chav,Snapop23,11,Sat May 30 20:18:19 2015 UTC,I think Dexter would fare better than 99% of other people

Dexter,37chav,Toiletpaperqueen,3,Tue May 26 21:18:40 2015 UTC,I would take both these motherfuckers down. That fucking clown and the grinning psycho will both go down with single fucking shot.
Dexter,37chav,minuteforce,3,Thu May 28 17:49:26 2015 UTC,"Interesting question, also a good comparison. I think both justified their murders based on their victims' histories while also using it as a coping mechanism. But Dexter's behavior is systematic (every victim is disposed of in the same way) while Jigsaw developed ironic endings for his victims.      So what would Dexter's trap be in relation to his crimes? Maybe he would be somehow forced to save a criminal, or someone who has harmed his loved ones, in order to prevent his own death.     And, do you think Dexter would want to kill Jigsaw after discovering his motives? Considering the parallels between them, I'm not so sure, but I do think he would be successful if he decided to kill him."
Dexter,37chav,Toiletpaperqueen,1 point,Tue May 26 23:51:02 2015 UTC,"Dexter would fare better than Hannibal in a Jigsaw predicament, is all I can say."
Dexter,37chav,minuteforce,3,Wed May 27 02:25:41 2015 UTC,I would be more interested in a face off between Dexter and Hannibal Lecter.
Dexter,37chav,Toiletpaperqueen,2,Wed May 27 04:14:02 2015 UTC,Came here to say this. Hannibal Lector is much much smarter than Dexter though.
Dexter,37chav,minuteforce,2,Wed May 27 09:37:28 2015 UTC,"Smarter, yes, but, in a one-on-one fight, maybe with a chase, Dexter would come out on top, I think. He always faces overconfident predators who underestimate him, allowing him to catch them off-guard, and he's likely a better brawler than Hannibal is.  That said, we haven't seen Hannibal let loose enough on the show"
Dexter,37chav,Toiletpaperqueen,2,Wed May 27 13:55:59 2015 UTC,Where are you in the show ( Hannibal) ? I don't think dexter would stand a chance against Hannibal.
Dexter,37chav,Ithier,2,Wed May 27 20:55:55 2015 UTC,"I'm waiting for S3.  We've seen Hannibal and Dexter both be outwitted by other killers (albeit only temporarily) but, one-on-one, I think that Dexter's raw physical strength and Hannibal's overconfidence would tip the balance in Dexter's favour."
Dexter,37chav,BaconAllDay2,1 point,Wed May 27 23:21:13 2015 UTC,"Hannibal has not been outwitted in the show. Is he confident ? Yes. Overly? No. But he knows people and responds to that. Dexter doesn't. If it would come to a one on one fight , Hannibal also has the advantage referring to season 2. I think.   Psyched though about season 3 :)"
Dexter,37chav,HOLY_HUMP3R,1 point,Thu May 28 06:10:07 2015 UTC,"I've seen Hannibal overwhelmed by goons, who could've chosen to kill him there and then, and only by sheer chance, IMO, did Jack Crawford's elaborate scheme fall apart. Worse has happened to Dexter over eight seasons.  Hannibal's S1 fight shows that he brawls as well as Dexter, but I still think Dexter would come out on top. All in all, maybe it is pretty much even, so, all things equal, it'd be close."

Dexter,37bscn,XD5133,13,Tue May 26 13:46:12 2015 UTC,"Really most of us feel the show sa whole started to go downhill after S4 as they got new writers. It became less about dexter and his balance of being normal and his dark passenger, and more lovey-dovey and things dexter was doing were dumb and would land him in prison 10 times out of 10.  In regards to the finale, showtime actually wouldn't let the writers and director do the ending they wanted, which was have dexter killed. They did this so they could end with the possibility of more dexter in the future. But as a result, the ending just seemed rushed and didn't really close any story lines. Batista and Quinn just let dexter go without a word, no one besides Hannah knows he is the BHB, he somehow survived driving his boat into a hurricane, whereas his boat did not, and left behind the two people he loved. He left his son with a woman who has been known to kill, though it's doubtful she would kill harrison. She did try to kill Deb though."

Dexter,37bscn,idkthisname1123,3,Mon Jun 22 20:42:18 2015 UTC,"During the first four seasons for sure. Everything he did at the beginning was a result of his dark passenger and trying to hide it, seem normal. The code was who he was. He dated Rita because that's just what normal people do. He had a job as a blood spatter analyst because it filled his need for blood and it hid his identity. Deb was the only person he cared for. Then he grew to love Rita. He learned the code was not perfect and neither was his father. He learned from his adversaries how to be a more perfect serial killer.   Seasons 5-8 didn't accomplish any of that nearly as well. Story lines were rushed and left open. Nothing made sense in terms of Dexter's personality. Debs love story/crippling depression/hatred sucked. While I liked Hannah since she was the only love Dexter had that truly knew him, it was executed poorly."

Dexter,379iss,ChickinSammich,2,Mon May 25 23:44:04 2015 UTC,"The Spanish 'R' isn't pronounced with a hard ""urr"" sound like the English R is.  Words with an ""R"" are pronounced with a slight tongue roll that produces the subtle ""L"" sound and some regional dialects emphasize it more than others.  The letter RR (yes, it's a different letter than ""the letter R, twice"") is also pronounced with a slight trill (perro, carro, etc) and the trill adds the subtle L sound as well.  The Japanese have a similar problem but for a different reason - There is no ""L"" in Japanese, but the letters RA, RI, RU, RE, and RO are all pronounced with a slight L; as if you were saying the letters L and R at the same time.  Hence why you hear native Japanese speakers pronounced L words as if they had an R - that's the closest sound they are familiar with.  It's the same reason people pronounce ""croissant"" as ""kruh-sawnt"" (should be ""kwuh-soeh"" or ""manga"" as ""mang-uh"" (should be mahn-gah) or ""futon"" as ""foo-tawn"" (should be hu-tone)- they are taking a word and relating it to a sound they are more familiar with or more comfortable with.  Think of it how certain American dialects pronounce ""car"" as ""cah"" or pronounce ""park"" as ""pahk.""  Another different example is the pronunciation of ""water"" as ""wooder"" or the pronunciation of ""wash"" as ""warsh.""  TL;DR - A combination of ""dialect"" and language differences."

Dexter,36yyt9,Mlg123,10,Sat May 23 08:35:45 2015 UTC,"S6's twist wasn't huge. Most people figured it out around here like 5 episodes before it was revealed.  And retreading S1's reveal theme isn't good. Each season from the first four at least did something different, and the antagonists all greatly add to Dexter's character. Miguel, his first best friend. Trinity, a father figure. Lila, a dark indulgence. Brian, a brother. What did DDK contribute to Dexter's character exactly? Or any of the other S5-8 big bads?  S1 - Huge reveal, killer is a secret.  S2 - No killer, huge reveal is against Dexter. Big bad is a combination of Lila, Doakes and the BHB investigation.  S3 - Miguel is the real bad guy the whole season, and had played Dexter from Day 1. Skinner was just a decoy, and sent out by Miguel in the first place.  S4 - Shown from the start. Looms over the entire season.  All that said, 3 is definitely the most underrated. Most people like it a lot more if they watch it a second time."
Dexter,36yyt9,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Sat May 23 09:15:09 2015 UTC,I might have to rewatch season three. I spent most of it despising Miguel and wondering what Dexter was thinking.
Dexter,36yyt9,Psychopath-,3,Mon May 25 15:47:59 2015 UTC,What missteps did Dexter take? Miguel caught him killing his brother's killer and then independently figured out he was a serial killer.  It's not like Dexter sat him on his knee and told him about all of the people he's killed. Miguel forced his way into Dexter's life and Dexter reluctantly allowed it for the chance to have a brother again.
Dexter,36yyt9,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Mon May 25 21:39:21 2015 UTC,"I remember thinking Dexter seemed like he hadn't learned the lesson that should've been ridiculously clear after the Lila debacle. He was being extremely careless in the context of Rule #1, way too concerned with having a friend considering what he stood to lose. For someone who prided himself on being emotionless and driven by logic, his relationship with Miguel seemed to be comprised of a series of illogical decisions. I guess you could argue that was intentionally highlighting the idea that Dexter was made into an emotionless killer and had the potential to be otherwise without Harry's interference. But this is just what I remember thinking at the time, and I haven't rewatched any of the episodes since they aired."
Dexter,36yyt9,Psychopath-,7,Mon May 25 22:17:35 2015 UTC,season 5  Lumen was not a bad character and the theme for season 5 was about Dexter's redemption for Rita'a death.Jordan and his group were not as good as trinity or itk or sirko but they were better than DDK and The Brain Surgeon as antagonists. They should have had Debra and Quinn ask more questions about Rita's death. Quinn should have used the photos Liddy sent him to reopen the bay harbor butcher case.Dexter and Lumen would not have been romantically involved so soon after Rita's death .Debra should have found out about Dexter's secret at the end of season 5 not 6
Dexter,36yyt9,adiman93,2,Sat May 23 16:26:22 2015 UTC,"I didnt even mind season 6, but then again, I did binge watch it"
Dexter,36yyt9,cs_99,2,Mon May 25 18:37:33 2015 UTC,"I'd say 3 and 5 are often underrated.   Season 3 - I don't think that it was as good as the previous seasons simply because The Skinner didn't interest me, but I absolutely loved Miguel as a character (even if I'd have preferred it to end a bit differently). Jimmy Smits was fantastic as Miguel as well, really solid performance.  Season 5 - I understand why this isn't a popular season; the ending felt like a complete cop-out, and the writing definitely started to feel lazier than the earlier seasons. However, I liked Lumen, and though the antagonists were not as exciting as Brian or Trinity, I thought the story itself was actually rather good. People often say that the show went downhill after season four but I think the fifth season is magnitudes better than any of the seasons that came after it (season 7 had potential but didn't really live up to that potential).    Personally, I didn't much like season 6. I saw the plot twist coming a mile off, and I don't really feel that subsequent seasons did a good job of following through with that twist anyway. I also thought that the villain was entirely uninteresting, and I didn't care for Dexter trying to 'save' Travis as it just felt like he was repeating the mistakes of season four (where he got close to Trinity). And though I initially liked seeing Brian again, his return felt incredibly forced and it just reminded me of how much I wished he was not killed off at the end of the first season."
Dexter,36yyt9,threep03k64,2,Wed May 27 00:48:40 2015 UTC,"Season 3 was excellent after I watch it multiple times, it is my favorite season after 4. Jimmy Smits was perfect as Miguel, very talented actor. Miguel just controls every scene he is in, just like Issak Sirko. It is a shame that the weak side stories and the Skinner let his amazing performance go unnoticed I guess. Season 3 is a very deep season in my opinion, with many themes and many issues that Dexter faces, as well as other people."

Dexter,36yvis,Missing_Intestines,2,Sat May 23 08:37:26 2015 UTC,At what points does Dexter hack into password-less computers in S1-4? I can think of him on Miguel's computer and deleting surveillance footage from a Miami Metro computer (which was only unprotected as the person in the room left without shutting anything down due to the fire alarm)... that's about it.  Any instance of this in the late seasons is just chalked up to Scott Buck's careless showrunning.

It's a 20 second conversation where doakes is giving no angel shit about it and he says ""one time and I felt so bad I confessed the next day... Im rewatching the series and just watched that episode this morning."

Dexter,36y7mj,BlindStark,1 point,Sat May 23 04:43:05 2015 UTC,"Masuka is the sex dragon, of course he fucked her. He's had to have fucked everyone in the office at least 5 times."
Dexter,36wsre,Never-asked-for-this,5,Fri May 22 19:38:49 2015 UTC,"I rewatched it with 2 friends of mine who both haven't seen it yet, and finished 3 days ago.  Well today we finished the first season(22 episodes) of prison break and they both love it;) look into that.  If you want to fill the Michael C. Hall void in your heart, try six feet under, starts a bit slow but beautiful show with very good plot:)"
Dexter,36wsre,WFAlex,1 point,Fri May 22 20:39:38 2015 UTC,"Prison Break was the show I finished right before Dexter. You guys are in for some real treat!  Unfortunately the old writers decided to strike (budget thing, I guess) in the middle of Season 3, so that one will be a bit awkward, and Season 4 will be pretty rushed, but still solid, and then there's Season 5... Which is a movie... It's a good movie, but it's really, REALLY rushed.  I hate that it happened to Prison Break, but it's still an amazing show.  And I heard about Six Feet Under. It would be somewhat similar to Breaking Bad, just not the same caliber, from what I've heard. I'll look into it.  Oh, and /r/prisonbreak is currently having a Rewatch of the show. They are on Episode 5 now, so maybe a bit too late for you."
Dexter,36wsre,GordionKnot,6,Fri May 22 21:02:20 2015 UTC,PLOT TWIST DEB WAS A FIGURE OF HIS IMAGINATION THE WHOLE TIME
Dexter,36wsre,BlindStark,2,Fri May 22 23:36:08 2015 UTC,Check out Hannibal if you need a show to watch after. Season 3 starts June 4th and it's an awesome show.
Dexter,36wsre,BlindStark,1 point,Fri May 22 20:55:46 2015 UTC,Isn't that the creepy-ass murderers setting fire to people and sewing horns on themselves?
Dexter,36wsre,JeamBim,3,Fri May 22 21:03:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about that description but the show centers around Hannibal and Will Graham mostly and all the kills are pretty crazy and intertwine through the story. It starts off with Will who can empathize really well with people but he's also unstable. The FBI asks Will to help them solve gruesome murders since he can empathize with the killer (almost too much) and understand how they think to catch them. He works as a special agent though since he could never pass the mental tests to actually work there since he's too unstable. Luckily the FBI asks Hannibal who is a really great psychiatrist and a totally nice guy to take Will in and help him sort through his mental problems so he doesn't lose it.   The artistry in the show is beautiful and it's a lot darker than Dexter was and has some very elaborate kills. Every actor on the show is terrific especially the main characters. It's truly enthralling and season 2 was crazier than any other show I've ever seen. Check it out as soon as you can, it's twisted in a beautiful way."
Dexter,36wcrq,Litn1337,4,Fri May 22 17:42:22 2015 UTC,"""The tits are right there.""  Oh man, unassuming Dexter vs violently bull-headed Doakes before the whole cage debacle is really something special of a dynamic."

Dexter,36upzt,Mlg123,12,Fri May 22 07:37:50 2015 UTC,"She was most likely addicted to being a pyromaniac and starting fires. I'd assume that's why she was there. She burned her ex boyfriends place down, she burned her sculpture and house to get sympathy, she tried to burn her house down with Dexter and Rita's kids inside, and she lit the cabin with Doakes on fire.  I'd assume that's why she went to those meetings and that was her addiction/dark passenger."
Dexter,36upzt,BlindStark,9,Fri May 22 21:19:50 2015 UTC,"Well, if it's true, it makes you wonder about her whole story about her burning down her ex-dealers house and all that... Interesting theory."
Dexter,36upzt,th3f0xx,14,Fri May 22 07:47:06 2015 UTC,"Well, that's what makes me wonder. I don't think she was a drug addict. I think she did kill someone in a fire. She was using rehab in the same way Dexter was, to admit what she had done in a different context, in an acceptable way.  She knew what Dexter was from the start.  Which makes their coffee shop scene mean so much more than just an introduction to their relationship. When she asked him ""how full of shit are you"" She knew he wasn't an addict, but a killer, just like herself and that's how she knew.   That's why she was so comfortable with telling Dexter that she killed someone when they were in the hotel, because when he came back with bloody hands, she knew what had happened, or what he was planning to do. That's why she was so comfortable with attempting to kill the kids and Dexter in the fire.   Most addicts in times of stress wouldn't have done that. Instead they would have fallen back into their addiction. She chose not to cope with her problems through drugs, but to cope with fire. In my opinion, her real addiction was killing / pyromania, not drugs."
Dexter,36upzt,lehmanbp,3,Fri May 22 09:00:25 2015 UTC,"That is an interesting theory. She also mentions that she ""has had other sponsors before"" and that Dexter was the first time she was a sponsor herself.    It makes you think what happened to those that sponsored her."
Dexter,36upzt,Nononopls,4,Fri May 22 14:48:42 2015 UTC,Remind me why exactly Dexter went to rehab? I forget.
Dexter,36upzt,Slaytounge,15,Fri May 22 09:11:32 2015 UTC,Made up a story for knocking paul out and rita basically cornered him into saying he was an addict and forced him into rehab.
Dexter,36upzt,JeamBim,11,Fri May 22 09:21:31 2015 UTC,"Because Rita caught on to the fact that Dexter framed Paul. Dexter admitted that he attacked Paul, took him to his hotel room and injected him with heroin but she kept asking questions and his only go to answer was that he ""had an addiction."""
Dexter,36upzt,snoopy_do,2,Fri May 22 09:33:09 2015 UTC,"Lila is what you would call a 'Chaser', not in the context of like taking a shot of liquor, but someone that chases a type.  I'd be willing to bet her only addiction is co-dependency, and she figured out she could get a LOT of that by shacking up with addicts and the like. I imagine that she's clean as a whistle, but trolls the AA, NA, and whatever groups just to find co-dependent people. I believe that to be her only addiction, being the 'manic pixie dream girl""(look it up, this IS a trope), who's just cooler than cool, and chiller than ice. She's addicted to 'saving' people, or atleast feeling like the person that saves people. Hence why when she found out the depth of Dex's madness, she was into it as FUCK."
Dexter,36upzt,ImLivingLikeLarry,1 point,Sat May 23 04:51:10 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. Her obsession with Dexter and the lengths she went to get his attention repeatedly makes me think she was addicted to people, to relationships."
Dexter,36upzt,Nononopls,2,Sun May 31 22:47:51 2015 UTC,"Pretty late to the party but oh well. I don't think she was a user, she just acted like one like how The Narrator or Marla do in Fight Club to go to the meetings. Although the fire thing is entirely possible."
Dexter,36uutk,placente,3,Fri May 22 08:46:25 2015 UTC,"I think id still be as equally upset with it just cause I wanted Dexter to get away. However, I think I would prefer this ending as opposed to the other because this is a much cooler ending for Deb."

Dexter,36uutk,dnaboe,3,Fri May 22 13:11:07 2015 UTC,"That sounds awful, brah. That's hammy as fuck. That's not really how the whole thing works despite what that batman comic(killing joke) would have you believe."
Dexter,36uutk,JeamBim,2,Sat May 23 04:53:27 2015 UTC,"They'd probably want to change how Deb acts about killing throughout the whole show. Otherwise it would seem pretty out of place and a sudden switch up. If you've seen Hannibal the way Will Graham acts is pretty much how it could go for Deb if she started losing it. If the fall to madness was done right I'd think it would be a pretty awesome ending though and a big surprise. You could have Deb still be in love with Dexter and have her be jealous of Hannah. She could just get progressively worse. Also switch up the scenes of her going after the jewels a bit and make it more hardcore. It would be cool if they didn't show who killed Hannah and then later when Dexter finds out she stabs him in the chest and it's all slow motion and he dies just looking into her eyes while bleeding out.    ""..It was you?""   ...I'm sorry Dex... I'm so fucking sorry.. ;_;"
Dexter,36uutk,BlindStark,0,Fri May 22 21:00:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, serial killer deb would be more exciting than the season 7 and 8 we got, not that they were bad, they were decent. They could've developed deb's evil side from season 7 along with dexters story....and have  two completely diff characters at the finale with dexter losing his dark passenger and deb having hers very much alive...that would be a much better finale because we have closure."

Dexter,36q50c,Living_legend22,31,Thu May 21 06:12:30 2015 UTC,excellent show with probably the greatest ending ever made.
Dexter,36q50c,adiman93,13,Thu May 21 07:27:51 2015 UTC,The best series finale ever. It perfectly wraps up the arcs of all of the characters while fitting perfectly within the concept of the show as a whole. It's just extremely satisfying.
Dexter,36q50c,REMAIN_IN_LIGHT,2,Thu May 21 18:38:53 2015 UTC,"Ya I plan sticking through it, I just wanted some reassurance."
Dexter,36q50c,Murderdoll197666,2,Thu May 21 15:54:30 2015 UTC,"If you can stick with breaking bad, which had a semi slow start - you'll definitely get hooked.  I still prefer the first few seasons of Dexter overall but the story itself from Six Feet Under was really awesome to watch unravel.  Like someone else mentioned, the ending alone just too perfect for a series finale."
Dexter,36q50c,Erekt__Butthole,20,Fri May 22 01:43:01 2015 UTC,"Six Feet Under is built on the emotional growth of the characters, not action or huge conflict. I finished the show and thought it was well-worth watching. It has one of the best endings ever and is one of the best shows of the second Golden Age."
Dexter,36q50c,DallasTruther,8,Thu May 21 08:39:42 2015 UTC,"I love it, but of course, if you don't then you don't.  There's a lot of great performances by actors who used this to further their career (Michael C Hall, of course, Peter Krause, Rachel Griffiths, Francis Conroy, Freddy Rodriguez, Jeremy Sisto).  Again I love it, and this is one of a few shows that I plan on never deleting from my HD."
Dexter,36q50c,surethingsugar,2,Thu May 21 06:42:04 2015 UTC,Don't forget Rainn Wilson!
Dexter,36q50c,AnorexicManatee,7,Thu May 21 21:42:27 2015 UTC,"I started watching it to fill the MCH void between seasons of Dexter, thinking it would be nice to see him in another role for a few episodes before I went back to Dexter. It is now one of my favorite shows of all time. The cast is wonderful, the storylines and characters are engaging, and I am so glad I discovered it. Do yourself a favor and give it a few more episodes!"
Dexter,36q50c,REMAIN_IN_LIGHT,6,Thu May 21 16:28:52 2015 UTC,"SFU is a show all about character studies. If you are willing to give the show the patience it deserves (and believe me, it totally does), you will be rewarded. The characters are layered and complex and well-acted. It's a phenomenal show."
Dexter,36q50c,valeriexcampos,2,Thu May 21 18:41:32 2015 UTC,Seriously the best ending to a show. Nothing has topped it and I watch a lot of shows. It's well worth investing some time into IMO. I would give it a chance though. Usually the first few episodes of a show are not going to be that awesome because they have to set everything up with characters and plot. I'd say watch more episodes and then decide. I know a few shows it has taken me some episodes to actually get in to.
Dexter,36q50c,Mrs_Damon,2,Thu May 21 18:10:37 2015 UTC,"I'm on my third rewatch of the series, I think it's honestly one of my favourite television shows of all time. I originally watched it because, like many Dexter watchers, I was interested in seeing MCH in a different role besides Dexter and I'm really glad I did.  It is super character-driven, however so some may consider that as slow or boring and that's totally their prerogative. There are subtle moments that pull incredibly on your heartstrings and make you want to spend time with your family... after watching another episode, of course. There aren't too many HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!! action moments yet there are moments that make you just sit in silence for the next few minutes, contemplating what you just saw.  And it does have the greatest series finale ever, so sticking with it just to ultimately witness that is worth it imo."
Dexter,36q50c,Presto-Manifesto,2,Thu May 21 18:42:18 2015 UTC,"I also couldn't get through the first episode, and I like similar shows. Guess it's just not our thing. Same with Sons of Anarchy. God that shit sucks for the first couple of episodes, although I hear it's good overall."
Dexter,36q50c,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Thu May 21 07:05:52 2015 UTC,"Urgh, I can't stand Sons of Anarchy. I did end up finishing the show  but once you do, you realise that it's just a huge rip off of The Sopranos & The Shield."
Dexter,36q50c,Slaytounge,1 point,Thu May 21 08:39:10 2015 UTC,"Six Feet Under takes a few episodes to grab you but honestly it's a 9/10 show and probably one of the best I've ever seen. It's very character oriented and watching their life revolve around death is very cathartic in a way, at least for me. Not everyone is going to like it though so be your own judge. It's not really like any of the shows you described though but then again, Six Feet Under is unlike any other show."
Dexter,36q50c,Veranique,1 point,Fri May 22 00:42:30 2015 UTC,It's an incredible show. Such depth and emotion from all the characters. It's in my top five.
Dexter,36q50c,Gangsta_Apprentice,1 point,Fri May 22 01:11:16 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you may enjoy a bit more of an action spruced drama instead of an ""analytical emotional"" spruced drama like SFU. It's an amazing show though and if you stick with it you won't be disappointed, but just know it can require a sympathetic and heartfelt mind. The finale is as good as everyone says it is though. So therapeutic."
Dexter,36q50c,ikevinax,-6,Tue May 26 07:59:11 2015 UTC,"It's a totally decent show, but fans who believe this series had the best finale must not watch many finales."
Dexter,36q50c,Gangsta_Apprentice,2,Thu May 21 21:15:40 2015 UTC,"I just finished SFU and was dumb struck by the finale. It was so well thought out and beautiful. In my opinion, none has touched it and I have watched a lot of shows. The show did defintely get hard to watch at times. All of the consistent family drama in the later seasons for example. But it was excusable to me because of how well written, well acted, and beautifully filmed it was. So just from curiosity, what in your opinion has had a better finale?"

Doakes was sort of innocent in a way and that's why Dexter didn't just kill him outright. He would try to frame Doakes for the kill (which he still does) and if he couldn't do that he would kill him.  Lila killed Doakes and another man which she talks about at the motel. She also tried to kill Dexter and Rita's kids after kidnapping them. Plus she framed Batista and knew who Dexter was. She had to go either way. Dexter would have had to kill Doakes for his survival and it would have been a big decision. Lila did it because she's crazy for that Dexter Dick Dancing."

But he still killed him in cold blood and didn't arrest him or do the ""play by the books"" cop routine.   Although Doakes was a decent cop, he still was a little dirty and did things as he saw fit. I'm sure that would have been Dexters mentality if he had to kill him. Because let's be honest, Dexter is the kind of guy who kills first and molds a reason why he should have killed him later."
Dexter,36n977,beckoning_cat,3,Wed May 20 16:59:01 2015 UTC,"Harry is said to have killed himself, I think a year after the morphine thing at the hospital with the nurse, after he sees with his own eyes Dexter cutting up one of his victims."

Harry tells him to kill her, which he does. Harry lives because of this for an extra year or two (mentioned in the show). Dexter finds what Dexter has become and says that he cant live with himself. After this it gets a bit confusing, we are told that he dies of a heart attack, but we know he killed himself. As far as I am aware we are not told how he (Harry), or the police department covered up his death. I don't think we are actually told how they covered it up, or how he done it to look like he had a heart attack..."
Dexter,36n977,cs_99,1 point,Fri May 22 18:24:57 2015 UTC,This clears it up. Thanks!
Dexter,36n977,kay9ine,1 point,Tue May 26 18:03:16 2015 UTC,Captain Mathews said Harry sent a note to him and it said he was going to overdose on meds iirc
Dexter,36n977,Nononopls,-2,Tue Jun 23 21:28:11 2015 UTC,"The nurse was going to kill Harry by giving him too much morphine. However. Dexter killed the nurse before she could do so, and Harry recovered from his cancer (if it was even cancer). Harry died 3 years later, and everyone thought it was a heart attack. But, as Dexter realizes, Harry actually committed suicide shortly after seeing one of Dexter's kills."
Dexter,36n977,BlindStark,2,Wed May 20 18:19:00 2015 UTC,"I think the episode is, ""There's something about Harry."" Dexter is killing Rinez (the guy who got off and Harry was pissed about) in the garage and Harry walks in and after seeing the body Harry starts throwing up. Dexter asks if he's ok and Harry tells him to stay away from him. I couldn't find a video on YouTube of it though."
Dexter,36nrqw,XD5133,2,Wed May 20 18:55:23 2015 UTC,Do you mean a normal syringe? Or do you need a prop type one?  They probably have normal syringes at Walmart or Walgreens I'd assume but you might have to ask the people in the pharmacy for one. You can buy them online but most come in boxes of like a 100:  http://www.firstoptionmedical.com/bd-hypodermic-syringe-with-needle-precisionglide-3-ml-25-gauge-x-1-inch-box/ecomm-product-detail/186590/?gclid=Cj0KEQjw4fCqBRDM1ZKhk5jfo6IBEiQAZQ97OGVKs_Z09elW3eWzJJ63oTN5J9NQiO4nMjfTL_nocq8aAv0Q8P8HAQ  Here is a cheap one:  http://www.dmesupplygroup.com/32582801.html?gclid=Cj0KEQjw4fCqBRDM1ZKhk5jfo6IBEiQAZQ97OJu42pLuKj_pPaC1PEj04uT-ft0ZOLl6hEtqXrR9xGcaAvOI8P8HAQ

Dexter,36l42r,BlindStark,-1,Wed May 20 06:17:39 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm not sure either. It may have just been the first one that Harry actually saw.

Dexter,368u5a,BlindStark,1 point,Sun May 17 18:44:18 2015 UTC,"It's definitely one of the best kills. It has a unique killer who builds elaborate mazes and makes girls run through them instead of just outright killing them. He even captures Dexter and makes him run through it. Beyond that though he is also what causes Deb to see how Dexter killing people isn't necessarily horrible. She could have saved that girl if she listened to Dex in the first place. Speltzer changes Debs point of view and it's also when Dexter decides to be even more careful and burn his blood slides. It's sad that he was more interesting than Oliver Saxon, hell every killer in the show was probably more interesting than Saxon."
Dexter,368u5a,BlindStark,0,Mon May 18 05:06:46 2015 UTC,"Was about to look up Oliver Saxon, but I'm only on S7 so I'll tread lightly. Also, the way I see it, Dexter didn't burn the blood slides just because he wanted to be more careful. Deb pointed out that keeping the blood slides as trophies was a sign of him reaping self-enjoyment over his kills, much like Speltzer did with the earrings. He burned them to show Deb and himself that he is nothing like the savage, heartless serial killers that he pursues."
Dexter,3663cq,cs_99,15,Sat May 16 14:40:21 2015 UTC,"Fair to say, yes.  MCH's best scenes happen in S1/S2 and the show wasn't paid attention to at that point. He also kills it in S4 and he got a Golden Globe for it.  I think he was downright incredible all 4 seasons but I think he showed his raw talent with Jimenez in S2E5. ""I know exactly who you are! You made me what I am!""  The truth is, according to MCH, the show changed so much that he started to play the role differently after S4. S5 he played the role right and to the best he could with the writing, whereas I think he completely changed his approach somewhere in S6/early S7 and the S1-4 Dexter was never seen again. Not to say that MCH was bad in 5-8 because he was always the best actor on the show, but there wasn't much he could do because the material didn't test him, and thus, he never won. His show got worse since Season 4, Cranston's show only got better from Season 1.  I only watch S1-4 myself and it does annoy me that my favourite actor didn't get much recognition for some truly incredible work."

Dexter,3663cq,DocNoob,3,Sun May 17 01:00:42 2015 UTC,"nope, Jon Hamm would. Jon Hamm fucking DESTROYS MCH. Watch mad men. He should have beat out Cranston a few times honestly."
Dexter,3663cq,BroomPerson21,4,Sun May 17 02:02:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree. MCH in Season 1, 2 and 4 is in his own league.   You have to look at it in the actor's shoes. Walter White and Don Draper are easier to play than Dexter Morgan. WW and Draper are allowed to and can show emotion, whereas Dexter cannot, which makes emoting so much harder as the actor. Just look at MCH in the episode ''Seeing Red'' when he finally recalls his mothers death. Imagine, as an actor, you're playing a psychopath who is yet processing the realisation that he watched his mother be slaughtered by a chainsaw.   There's no go-to ploy. He can't just start crying or yelling to the sky, Dexter has no feelings. He has to emote without any true strong human emotion that he is now realising what happened to him as a child. That alone is a harder feat than most of what Hamm and Cranston did on their shows.   Cranston in Ozymandias, Blood Money, Phoenix, Crawl Space, Face Off, Felina...  MCH in Seeing Red, Born Free, The Dark Passenger, Dex Takes A Holiday, Hungry Man, I Had A Dream, Hello Dexter Morgan, The Getaway...  Hamm in The Suitcase, The Strategy, Waterloo, In Care Of...  They're all incredible actors and on the same level, in my opinion."
Dexter,3663cq,Erekt__Butthole,-5,Sun May 17 05:27:19 2015 UTC,you're nuts. If you've seen Mad Men you know whats up. Have you seen it?
Dexter,3663cq,BroomPerson21,2,Sun May 17 05:30:25 2015 UTC,"Yes I have. I still think they're all on the same level, although MCH/Cranston were tested more as they were put in more life-threatening/breaking situations."
Dexter,3663cq,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Sun May 17 06:19:59 2015 UTC,It is a travesty he did not win anything for six feet under for his portrayal of David Fisher.His performance as David Fisher supersedes anything he did in Dexter and it is better than Cranston's  performance in Breaking Bad
Dexter,3663cq,adiman93,2,Sun May 17 08:31:16 2015 UTC,"MCH was absolutely incredible in ''That's My Dog'' in SFU but overall, I'd say he was far more tested in Dexter and got to show just how talented he is."
Dexter,366fz7,ProClifo,10,Sat May 16 16:44:41 2015 UTC,"They're different. There are two things in particular I much preferred in the books and one thing that was terrible and much better in the series. It's hard to be more specific without giving things away. Other than that, my only issue with the books is that Jeff Lindsay's writing skills are occasionally on point but often leave a lot left to be desired. Dexter is a bit more truly psychopathic in the books- even somewhat sadistic- but like I said, it's hard to really explain without spoilers. For the most part, though, it's pretty much just additional stories with the same Dexter you know."
Dexter,366fz7,Psychopath-,3,Sat May 16 17:13:46 2015 UTC,From what I've heard the books are decent at best. I've heard a lot of people say they're terrible.
Dexter,366fz7,supertroll1999,3,Sat May 16 18:51:59 2015 UTC,"I personally prefer the first-person perspective of the books better. As others have said, though, the books do differentiate from the show quite a bit. Dexter as a character is different, and they even get a bit supernatural at one point."
Dexter,366fz7,JaBray,1 point,Sat May 16 23:10:09 2015 UTC,"I haven't read them all, but I really did like reading it from Dexter's point of view. It felt like there was a lot more insight with his inner monologue. The show tries to capture that, but voice overs can only do so much before they feel cumbersome."
Dexter,366fz7,Arcsis,2,Sun May 17 03:51:54 2015 UTC,"The books, definitely.  Not sure what people have against Lindsey's writing style, he has really clever moments. He's fond of alliteration, and uses a fair bit of creative wordplay.   One warning I can give, though, is that the books kinda go in a very different direction a few books in. That might irritate you, because it's a pretty fucking big swerve."
Dexter,366fz7,iamaneviltaco,1 point,Sat May 16 22:11:17 2015 UTC,"I know which moment you're referring to, but I think the 4th book and the ones after that pretty much disown and completely forget that awful revelation in the 3rd. So it doesn't really change the whole series for me."
Dexter,366fz7,Chalky97,1 point,Mon May 18 21:07:34 2015 UTC,The books.
Dexter,366fz7,the_dooler,1 point,Sat May 16 18:49:05 2015 UTC,"I liked them, but the writing really isn't impressive."
Dexter,366fz7,Nothox,1 point,Sat May 16 19:38:29 2015 UTC,"I'd say the show at its best (S1-4 really) is much better than the books.  I'm on the 5th book at the moment and I only really read it at this point because I love Dexter's POV. There is also some great storylines with a certain character who is dead in the show, and most of the time the books are on point and a joy to read. Overall, totally worth the read and they're fun, but they aren't as good as the show."
Dexter,366fz7,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Sun May 17 00:01:41 2015 UTC,"I hope the books are good, I spent around 7 quid on them.  I hope they live up to the series."
Dexter,366fz7,W0lfQueen,1 point,Thu May 21 18:00:56 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you like really. Do you want to be inside Dexter's head learning the inner workings of his psychopathic mind? Then the books are for you. Do you want to marvel at a monster, but not quite learn how horrible his thoughts are? Then the show is more your style."
Dexter,366fz7,denvertebows15,0,Fri May 29 00:27:13 2015 UTC,I much prefer the show. I read all the books anyways but the books make the dark passenger an actual supernatural-like force. As if he's actually possessed by some sort of literal biblical demon instead of just a name for his urges.
Dexter,36613f,TheFoodJunkie,4,Sat May 16 14:15:48 2015 UTC,What about little candy daggers/knives sticking out of the cupcakes with blood dripping down the side?

Dexter,3652st,BlindStark,3,Sat May 16 12:15:06 2015 UTC,I watched seasons 1-8. I still found it to be really entertaining even though the plot and writing developed some serious issues in the later seasons. I still enjoyed watching Dexter do his thing and seeing where the seasons would go. The ending really pissed me off though.
Dexter,3652st,denvertebows15,2,Sun May 17 04:32:35 2015 UTC,"By watch I mean rewatch, or what you consider canon."
Dexter,3652st,TheLastFreeMan,2,Sat May 16 14:13:02 2015 UTC,"1,2,4,7"
Dexter,3652st,swisspassport,2,Sat May 16 10:08:59 2015 UTC,"Personally I go S1 through S5. While 5 pales in comparison to 1-4, it does have some intense episodes, and I actually like Deb getting within inches of catching Dexter and letting him go.   Plus Dexter's monologue at the birthday party in the last scene of the season is the closest thing to an ""ending"" for me."
Dexter,3652st,Brosephy,2,Sun May 17 04:52:22 2015 UTC,"What the fuck lol. ""How do you drink your coffee, do you finish your cup or leave 2 swallows?"""
Dexter,3652st,Erekt__Butthole,2,Sat May 16 14:04:24 2015 UTC,"1-4 for me. Too many problems with 5-7 to really enjoy them, and the villains just aren't as good as they are in 1-4. S8 on the other hand, is just awful."

Dexter,3652st,oldskoolpleb,1 point,Sun May 17 04:51:44 2015 UTC,"Because I've seen the show, and I know from there that it only gets worse from there? The finale of S4 isn't about the tragic death, it's about Dexter's story coming full circle and he finally learning the lesson that he can't be a husband, father and serial killer without losing everything in return."
Dexter,3652st,-Jarod,1 point,Mon May 25 08:43:47 2015 UTC,"Thats indeed what I think it's about. But something drew me to watching the entire series and not just me, hundreds of thousands of people did too. Its some feeling of having to know what happens next because s4 didnt close the series for me."
Dexter,3652st,MajorWhupass,1 point,Wed May 27 06:20:26 2015 UTC,"This poll was more about what you rewatch, or what you consider canon. For eg, a lot of people like to pretend S8 doesn't exist."
Dexter,360lv7,rehoakman,19,Fri May 15 02:14:15 2015 UTC,I lost it at the end. Surprise motha fucka!
Dexter,360lv7,SORSOREY,32,Fri May 15 04:04:49 2015 UTC,This is not a show where everyone gets a happy ending.Dexter getting caught and expossed for his crimes is the only ending the show should have
Dexter,360lv7,adiman93,9,Fri May 15 03:36:39 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. While the ending we got was garbage, it was at least the right tone. A show like Dexter could never end happily, not after everything he'd done"
Dexter,361g9l,rama_tut,6,Fri May 15 08:11:33 2015 UTC,"No idea. It's implied he killed her because she knew about him being in the area when Joe Driscoll died, but there wasn't an investigation or anything so she wasn't a threat.   Who knows if he even killed her? Maybe he was just returning to solidify his story as the cable repairman by coming around more than once.   If he didn't kill her, she would've had a heart attack when she realised who the cable repairman was on the news not long after."
Dexter,361g9l,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Fri May 15 09:28:51 2015 UTC,I assume he simulated a heart attack or whatever just like their father
Dexter,361g9l,275Adamas,-2,Wed May 20 06:38:03 2015 UTC,You should take the spoiler about Rudy out of the title

It's not easy to notice but I'd be willing to bet a decent amount of time passes from Miguel's funeral to the wedding."

Dexter,35m1ox,frellus,8,Mon May 11 17:42:55 2015 UTC,it was a good season but it was considered a letdown after the brilliance of season 4

Dexter,35m1ox,x2ndCitySaint,3,Mon May 11 22:35:50 2015 UTC,Agree.  Dexter vs. Debra was great. She should have never accepted his Dark Passenger (or whatever the hell they were calling it by then.)

Even season 6 had some great moments and both had really shocking finales, but there was so much wasted potential on both of those story lines. The plot took a huge dive in my opinion and I found myself rolling my eyes constantly at how easy it was for Dexter to get himself out of any situation and find all the information he needed in season 6-8. I just think Season 5 wasn't as cheesy and ended feeling complete. I dunno that's just my opinion though"
Dexter,35m1ox,mr-self-destruct,2,Mon May 11 23:03:36 2015 UTC,"I think a big reason season 5 wasn't as great is because of how quickly he forgot about Rita. Literally after the first episode, it's like she never existed. Also the love thing between him and Lumen was unnecessary."
Dexter,35m1ox,2paymentsof19_95,1 point,Wed May 13 18:19:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Lumen thing definitely felt forced. It really didn't add to the plot of the season, and felt like it was just added because it's expected and y'know... sexy times."

Dexter,35juz5,adiman93,2,Mon May 11 15:22:42 2015 UTC,the only actor who should come back is Michael C Hall
Dexter,35juz5,cs_99,2,Mon May 11 16:18:55 2015 UTC,"Kinda defeats the purpose of a spin off, unless we want a show about lumberjacks. Would make sense if they made it a season 9, but i highly doubt that would happen."

Nevins said that they would only do the show if Michael C. Hall agreed to return.  Hall said he would be open to returning for a spinoff series however said ""I can't even wrap my mind around that. And it's all just theoretical until there is some sort of script reflecting somebody's idea of where it could possibly go. But it's hard for me to imagine what that would be. Yeah, as far as playing Dexter again for an undefined amount of time, that's a little daunting to consider. But doing another television series—there's a lot of amazing stuff on TV. I don't want to do that right away. But I wouldn't say never to that.""  i think they want to do a new series which follow the books"
Dexter,35juz5,cs_99,1 point,Tue May 12 00:17:38 2015 UTC,"MCH might not necessarily have to act, he could just mean to come back in his executive producer role, which would make Nevins quotes make sense"

Dexter,35j7ot,MyNamesNotObama,2,Mon May 11 15:47:46 2015 UTC,"Because people would've gone looking for them and looked at Dexter as a prime suspect. He could do that with Deb cause he knew he was done. But he did realize that anyone he's ever tried to involve in his life always got hurt for some reason or another. ( Rita, Harry, Brian, Deb, Miguel) So to protect harrison and hannah he let them go for now."
Dexter,35j7ot,StevenOnTheMoon,2,Mon May 11 18:49:01 2015 UTC,"On point 2, Deb would still get a police funeral, a body isn't required."
Dexter,35j7ot,blackflag209,1 point,Fri May 22 09:42:47 2015 UTC,"Okay lets see if i can name a few    Masukas daugther why would dex rob Deb of a police funeral, for his own closure? Why wouldent he go to Hannah, all the bad things are gone, his dark passanger for one So many close calls with him almost being discovered and he gets away and no one knows his secret? he gets away felt like no closure for anything, doakes, maria, miquel. NOTHING gets resovled   just want to say i love the show, even though the ending kinda sucked    What about her? It was just filler development for masuka.  Because Deb was important to Dexter. She was all he had for so long and he was all he had. He felt it was his duty as her older brother to mercy kill her and lay her to rest in a place he thinks is peaceful, relaxing. Which is how he describes his boat trips on multiple occasions.  He doesn't go to Hannah because the people around him end up dead. Harry tells him for like 4 seasons that he needs to leave his family behind or they'll be caught in the crossfire or suffer consequences from learning who he is. It took the loss of his sister for him to surrender to Harry. I don't think this needs explaining. If you watch the show it tells you all about it. Gets away? First rule of the code. All of those things get resolved, what do you mean?   I thought the ending was actually very smart. What it lacks in plot resolution it more than makes up for in tying together themes across all the other seasons."
Dexter,35j7ot,275Adamas,2,Wed May 20 06:56:09 2015 UTC,"I'll start by saying you may want to put a spoiler tag on this. I personally don't hate it as much as most people, I thought it could have ended in a worse way, then again it could have ended a much much better way aswell. The things I hated about the finale was the same as a lot of people. Kills deb (technically),fakes death, and abandons family,etc. Another thing that made the ending seem even worse is the fact that it was a great show and had some amazing plot lines. So in comparison, the ending is even worse."
Dexter,35j7ot,TheTvdroid,4,Sun May 10 23:11:05 2015 UTC,An example of really poor plot is where the cop unties Saxton despite Deb saying she needed backup. There's no reason the cop should've done that
Dexter,35j7ot,MX21,1 point,Mon May 11 02:01:59 2015 UTC,He was a marshal not a cop. They're separate agencies. Also he has no reason to believe Saxton would be who he was. Why would he be tied to a chair? He looks like a victim. He responded the way most people would
Dexter,35j7ot,275Adamas,1 point,Wed May 20 06:59:15 2015 UTC,"The perfect ending to the series would have been everyone finding out what Dexter is and what he's been doing for the past ~20 years. The ending was extremely weak for a series that I thought was great.   I mean I get the explanation for why everything happened the way it happened, but there were so many other ways the series could have ended that would have been much better."
Dexter,35j7ot,denvertebows15,0,Thu May 21 15:00:06 2015 UTC,"The finale's pretty bad, but it's just the supersized dingleberry of a diarrhea sundae of a final season that was filled with dropped plots, wasted stories, and terrible CGI. Showtime may not have let the writers kill Dexter himself, but that doesn't excuse an entire season of shitty episodes.  There's no reason at all why the final season shouldn't have been about Batista picking up on LaGuerta's investigation and mobilizing Miami Metro after Dexter."
Dexter,35j7ot,rleclair90,1 point,Thu May 14 13:58:14 2015 UTC,Did we really need a third season of 'try to catch Dexter'? I'm not saying the ending was the best possible ending but the reason the series was done from season one is because the beauty of the premise was hunting down a big catch while daylighting with the police. You can only make hunt a villain kill him and then hunt another villain entertaining for so long. The final four seasons were a result of trying not to stagnate the plot. They just kind of had to wing it since they didn't have a base material to reference.

Dexter,35hf43,Javindo,4,Tue May 12 16:08:51 2015 UTC,"I thought season six was just a little, boring. Generic big bad, not much else going on. Seven was great, no issues. 8 started fine, I really had no issues until Hannah walked through the door. So honestly the only thing that really sucked to me about 8 was the last episode and Hannah's return in general.   So I am with you on not being apart ofthe ""stop after season 4"" train. Yeah, it did decrease in quality a bit after that but overall I still really enjoyed the entire show (minus that last episode, UGHHHHH)"

A lot of people will tell you to stop watching after season 4, or that the last season sucked, etc., but bottom line is if you keep enjoying every season, then keep watching to the next one!  Maybe you really enjoy every season, or maybe you just keep watching because you've already invested enough time in the series that you feel like you need to see how it all turns out in the end.  But honestly, you shouldn't take anyone's advice because it will make you not enjoy it as much as you might had someone not told you that this part is good, this part is bad, etc., etc.  But yeah also as others have said, stay off this sub until you're done with the series."

Dexter,35hf43,livedasdayman,4,Sun May 10 22:30:40 2015 UTC,"3 doesn't deserve to be put anywhere near 8.  3 is about Dexter having a friend, something he's longed for since killing you know who. Season 3 is a solid season and very well written.  Season 8 is just a complete abomination.  My rankings go like this: 4>1>2>3  Although 3 ranks lowest in my season rankings, it's still a great season and full of character development for Dexter. Really sets up the family theme of S4."
Dexter,35hf43,Erekt__Butthole,9,Sun May 10 22:32:11 2015 UTC,"Make your own opinions. The quality goes down a little, and it goes from being a dark comedy to just a drama with very sparse humor...but all of it is certainly worth watching.  Some episodes in later seasons are some of the best in the series."

Now, which seasons you like better or worse is totally opinion based.  I've seen people prefer the second half to the first or just like random seasons.  I know people who like it all and who couldn't get past season 1.  But strictly speaking from a factual, technical point.  1-4 is leaps and bounds better than 5-8.  They changed showrunners multiple times and the budget got lower, more filming on stages etc...  So watch it all, formulate your own opinion, but if you notice the decline in quality keep going, a lot of people love the later seasons."

Dexter,35ibj7,adiman93,1 point,Mon May 11 13:55:02 2015 UTC,"I agree I think it would be a great way to reboot it, he feels like he hurts everyone around him so he takes advantage of it. It would seem kind of weird though for Dexter since Deb and Harry wouldn't have wanted him to do that."
Dexter,35ibj7,BlindStark,2,Mon May 11 14:02:44 2015 UTC,I don't think it would make sense. Harry taught Dexter how to act. It's how he interprets and understands the world. We've seen Dexter and Deb have some big disagreements. He wouldn't exactly look to her as guidance.
Dexter,35iymy,TheTvdroid,3,Sun May 10 20:55:09 2015 UTC,I assume that Harry code encorparates leaving a clean crime scene.... the easiest way to do this would be to use plastic sheeting as a massive condom essentially.... it's never explicitly mentioned but when you think about it it's easily the best way to stay clean
Dexter,35iymy,TheGoodConsumer,2,Sun May 10 21:47:19 2015 UTC,"It's more of just an obvious method to easily clean up the crime scenes. I'm sure he planned out every step before he ever started killing. How to capture them, kill them, clean up the evidence, and dispose of the body without getting caught. That's the first rule after all, don't get caught. He uses plastic so it catches all of the blood even tiny drops that may spray across the room so nothing gets left behind.  If there is a puddle of blood on the ground he can just roll up the plastic and stuff it in the trash bags. If he didn't he would have to mop up blood and get it out of carpets and off walls which would just be impossible to do easily."
Dexter,35iymy,BlindStark,1 point,Sun May 10 21:57:05 2015 UTC,And if looked at under uv will glow until it's that's fully clean. He mentions using bleach which leaves a smell in season 4.
Dexter,35iymy,Insloxnia,1 point,Mon May 11 00:02:07 2015 UTC,"It only glows if sprayed with luminol, bluestar, etc. since the chemical reacts with the iron in hemoglobin. It's not like Dexter would have time to spray all of his kill rooms to find any tiny dots he missed if he didn't use plastic on the walls. If anyone knew how to clean up blood well it would probably be Dexter, it would just take a lot of time. The good thing though is that Dexter would be the guy they called if they did find any blood he missed."
Dexter,35iymy,BlindStark,2,Mon May 11 05:45:48 2015 UTC,"If you pay attention to him testing blood by smashing white dolls' head, he uses some kind of flat pvc to protect walls. Harry could have tell him to use something similar, but easy to mount and dismount."

The only reason it was revealed to everyone that he was a serial killing cannibal was because he chose to reveal himself (and in the process butchered everyone who came for him and escaped to Europe). Dexter on the other hand is always fucking up and making stupid mistakes (S6 and S7 finales for example)."
Dexter,35fdc5,Ciahcfari,2,Sat May 9 21:29:46 2015 UTC,"If we're going by those rules, Dexter was never revealed to everyone.  And Hannibal was tricked into initiating the dinner with Jack."
Dexter,35fdc5,_rattlesnake,1 point,Sun May 10 07:39:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah Dexter could have stayed in Miami and kept killing if he wanted to. Though Hannibal does do some pretty elaborate and crazy kills and leaves them out for the FBI. They are really two different kinds of serial killers. Dexter just thought he needed to kill and didn't want anyone to know so he hid almost all of his kills and followed the code he had to make sure he didn't get caught. Hannibal on the other hand doesn't really care about getting caught. He has a special curiosity and likes to play games with people so he sets up all these interesting kills. Plus he makes them into delicious meals. Even though Hannibal gets ""caught"" he could have killed all the main characters if he wanted to. I'd say if Hannibal hid all of his kills like Dexter did then he would come out on top comparing both serial killers. Dexter also only killed bad people so no one ever spent too much time looking for the people he killed. If we are only going by the TV show, Hannibal is very smart but they haven't gone too much into yet. Dexter is mainly great in blood spatter but Hannibal excels in all kinds of subjects in the books, he's like a genius super villain.  So Hannibal probably is the smarter one but the show isn't over yet. I actually just started rewatching Hannibal last night after finishing my Dexter rewatch. I'd definitely recommend it if anyone hasn't seen it, amazing show."
Dexter,35fdc5,BlindStark,1 point,Sun May 10 11:26:07 2015 UTC,"If we're going by those rules, Dexter was never revealed to everyone.     Technicality. Dexter got caught so many times (Rudy/Brian, Doakes, Deb, Marshall, Laguerta, Saxon and that's just off the top of my head) he just killed them all (some by proxy).   And Hannibal was tricked into initiating the dinner with Jack.   I don't know if I'd use the word ""tricked"". Will did deceive him but Hannibal realized this a day before the actual dinner party (which if he chose to would allow him to destroy any remaining incriminating evidence and leave the country a free man) but decided to make everyone involved pay (Will especially) and nearly killed all of them."

Dexter,35birm,BlindStark,1 point,Fri May 8 21:35:33 2015 UTC,I thought it was weird at first to show his dark passenger be the one to do the kill but it kinda made sense to do it that way because of the reveal later in the season
Dexter,35birm,Lostqwer,1 point,Mon May 11 02:01:13 2015 UTC,"That episode was pretty bad, the writing and acting felt like something you would see in Supernatural.   Edit: Whatever, I'm right."
Dexter,35birm,Slaytounge,1 point,Sat May 9 01:25:06 2015 UTC,Bryan didn't hurt the guy. As the camera pans or reveals that it was Dexter. It was showing Dexter embracing his brother's ways. In that moment he was who Bryan wanted him to be.
Dexter,35birm,275Adamas,1 point,Wed May 20 07:09:50 2015 UTC,"A agree with BlindStark, a devil/angel senario in that episode would feel forced, the Bryan sub-conscience in that episode was already weird, and there was no reason to make it stranger."

Dexter,35avno,DarthLurker420,4,Mon May 11 00:19:33 2015 UTC,"Daredevil is amazing; like Dexter, it doesn't just have an intro episode of him becoming the daredevil, it has flashbacks in relevant places. It's also got a great balance of realism/grit and comic bookishness, as well as some excellently choreographed fight sequences.  House of Cards seasons one and two are great, but season three wasn't too good. Other suggestions would be Rome, The Tudors, and Heroes. Personally I find Heroes was very much underrated, despite its decline over the last couple seasons (much like Dexter in that sense). Every character was fleshed out and very human. It was a great show.  For less serious shows/comedies: Peep Show, Mitchell and Webb Look, Scrubs, The IT Crowd, Archer etc. They're all on Netflix UK."
Dexter,35avno,nerfAvari,1 point,Fri May 8 16:29:31 2015 UTC,"I really wasn't going to check Daredevil out until posting this thread, but I will definitely check it out in the summer, cheers for the suggestions!"
Dexter,35avno,BlindStark,4,Fri May 8 16:33:39 2015 UTC,HBO's True Detective
Dexter,35avno,scofieldslays,3,Sat May 9 00:07:45 2015 UTC,"House MD was a pretty good show. It does a have a pretty precise formula that most of the episodes follow. Bu the characters are fun, and watching how insanely brilliant house is makes it a great watch. I should mention I have no idea how realistic it is. So that could potentially be a turn off. But I definitely thoroughly enjoyed the show I watch the first 4 or so seasons as they premiered when I was younger, and I re-watched the whole series a few years back. Definitely a good watch.   I don't have netfix personally so I am not sure what is available. But I would highly recommend Game of Thrones. Its a wild ride but has great character development that people tend to depend on after Breaking Bad. Another great one from HBO is Deadwood. Its a few years old now but is an amazing western, with again outstanding character development. Plus Anna Gun from BB has a role in it too."

Dexter,35avno,TheREALchadizzy1,2,Sat May 9 01:58:43 2015 UTC,"Hannibal is really good if you want a psychological thriller/ crime drama. (It's not on Netflix though.) The Mads guy plays a really good Hannibal Lecter. If you're into the movies, it's especially neat. Bates Motel is okay; I watched that. It centers around a psychopath and involves some crime drama. And yeah, Breaking Bad is unbeatable. I don't know, I've been watching a bunch of movies instead of tv shows. After Dexter I don't really want to get invested in another long tv series."

Dexter,357qwq,Strang404,2,Thu May 7 20:24:49 2015 UTC,no dream scenario Deb should not be brought back from the dead otherwise it will look as ridiculous as 24 The only way the show can be redeemed from the horrible finale maybe have a detective look into the bhb case and we get to see the show from Dexter's and the detective's point of view
Dexter,357qwq,adiman93,2,Fri May 8 04:32:35 2015 UTC,Or they just don't take the ending as cannon. If they do a reboot/continuation I think they would only have M.C. Hall come back and just start new. I doubt they would try to really explain anything that happened last. I wouldn't mind having Deb back and they just make a new ending to start the season. I agree a dream sequence would probably just be bad.
Dexter,357qwq,BlindStark,1 point,Fri May 8 13:56:11 2015 UTC,"Tbh I dont think its the finale that needs to be fixed, i think it's the entirety of the last season, which was very fucking flawed.  But if we are only doing the last episode then you could start with cutting out the lumberjack scene and perhaps changing the last words of the show from, ""Hey, how about we go get some ice cream, yeah?"" and ""Ok"" to fucking anything else."
Dexter,354xgc,ChagSC,6,Thu May 7 03:24:44 2015 UTC,"I think there's misconception here that people who disliked the finale didn't understand it.   If someone told me that ""Dexter's actions lead to Deb's death and he spends the rest of his life punishing himself."" That would be fine. That sounds like a decent ending. Even now, I think that would have been a good ending.  However, Scott Buck just confirmed that the writer's picked that ending before even writing the script. That's an inorganic way of writing fiction, (and interestingly enough, is the exact opposite of what Breaking Bad's writing room did.) That's a bad strategy, Cotton, because its easy to write cheap ""shortcuts"" to get to the ending you've chosen. The ending didn't feel like a natural conclusion to the events of dexter and its characters motivations (the same goes for the entire season, they had a cast of characters available to wrap up, but they abandoned them all to write a faux ""blast from the past"" slash ""evil destined counterpart"" thing).   For example, The events that lead to Deb's death are not some unforeseen consequence of Dexter's genius plan, they feel like forced, chanced events meant to speed us along to the intended ending. Dex and Deb win, they lock up the killer, but all goes wrong because....... they leave the world class serial killer alone in a room so they can have a heart to heart. That's not dramatic irony that's dramatic stupidity. Adding to that, Deb dies of a stroke-- off screen.  As though the writer on the other end thought ""okay, now Deb has to like DIE-DIE for realz, so....... stroke?""   It could have been a good finale had the events lead up to it. But they forced the ending."
Dexter,354xgc,mcbcol,2,Thu May 7 13:54:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with pretty much everything you said, although there's one point you made that I actually liked about the finale.  You mentioned that Deb died of a stroke off screen, and while that was basically the reason for her death, she was only in a coma following the stroke. Again, essentially the cause of her death was a stroke that happened off camera, but the moment she died was shown in what I thought was one of the most emotional scenes of the show with Dexter saying goodbye to her before switching off her life support.   I thought it was fitting that the last person Dexter would kill would be Deb, because she was really the only person he would never kill, but his hand was forced, and that much I agreed with as far as the finale went.   Everything leading up to that moment where he's forced to kill her is definitely forced and has an uncomfortable aura about it, but I did like the outcome of that. I just wish they'd found a different more suitable way to arrive at that last scene in the hospital."
Dexter,354xgc,JWard515,1 point,Fri May 8 03:57:26 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, I forgot about that part actually.  Funny enough, remembering that made me dislike the finale more.  Because, from a theatric lens, Deb sort of has three exits-- two of them ""false exits.""  It sort of seems like they wanted to Deb to die, and they wanted certain details of the death to be a certain way, so they kill her three times: she gets shot (its a shock and its NOT Dexter's fault!), she has a stroke in a hospital (she gets to say final things to other characters!), Dexter takes her off life support (Dexter had to be the one to kill her but its still a beautiful moment!).  They wanted Deb's death to be nuanced, but in order to accomplish it they ended up writing a really clunky series of events."
Dexter,354xgc,mcbcol,2,Sat May 9 22:00:54 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'm pretty sure the Breaking Bad writers had that ending in mind before they wrote the whole last season. They said they started with the shot of Walter buying a car with a machine gun in the back and said, ""okay so what are we gonna do with this?"" Like, they didn't have Jack and his crew thought out yet, I don't think. I know I heard that in an interview with Gilligan somewhere. Their writers are just better at what they do."
Dexter,354xgc,Presto-Manifesto,3,Fri May 8 05:41:46 2015 UTC,"No, because the whole series flirted with the idea of him being found out.  Our entire premise for watching and staying hooked is that ""what if"" factor of getting caught finally.  Viewers had every reason to believe that is what the final season would give us, and it did not, so I still have blue balls."
Dexter,354xgc,tedbrogan12,7,Thu May 7 13:39:55 2015 UTC,"I hadn't seen this until months after the finale, but the points Buck makes are actually the reasoning behind me growing to accept and appreciate the finale.   I actually was so happy with the finale when I thought he was dead. I was like, wow that was incredible. I was angry when he was actually alive living this lumberjack life.   What sold me on it was what I thought about in the days and weeks after. I pictured Dexter just going to work, driving that truck or cutting down trees or whatever his exact job was, then just going home to that tiny home, lethargically taking off that jacket and tossing his keys down before he sits down at that desk, every single day, and stares out the window into the nothingness alone with his thoughts, thinking about what he did to get him to this point all alone.  I loved the character of Dexter, but deep down I think somewhere we all knew he had to pay for what he'd been responsible for, especially after Deb's death. What more a torturous punishment than absolute isolation away from everything he wanted, everything he knew, with nothing to do all day and all night but think about it?"
Dexter,354xgc,JWard515,7,Thu May 7 05:07:59 2015 UTC,"Many people had a negative reaction to the finale because of everything that lead up to it. We got a pretty disappointing final season as a whole and almost no matter what the ending was, it would not have been enough to save it. The final moments aren't bad but it would have been so much more powerful if the season revolved around him being exposed and causing even more damage to everyone who's been a part of his life throughout the series, not just Deb.   We all knew, expected, and hoped for Dexter to have to pay for all the things he's done, but we needed him to be exposed for what he truly was for the point to be really driven home. And we never really got that."
Dexter,354xgc,Slaytounge,2,Thu May 7 08:49:04 2015 UTC,Which is exactly was the season 8 poster led us to believe.  http://i.imgur.com/cyaL1WQ.jpg  Everyone in the series staring intently at Dexter. In a shipping container. With blood coming out of Dexter.
Dexter,354xgc,dirtynj,2,Thu May 7 15:13:38 2015 UTC,"I was actually just replying to who you're responding to as well and I hadn't even thought of this poster! I mentioned in my comment the trailer that was first released for Season 8, and their song choice for it. It was called Run On and it had this ominous sound to it, and lyrics like ""You may throw your rock and hide your hand, working in the dark against your fellow man but as sure as God made the day and night, what you do in the dark will be brought to the light""... except it wasn't. He was never caught by anyone, and unless I'm missing something, no one who didn't already know found out about Dexter in season 8. Quinn I think knows based on that look he gave him in the interrogation room in the final episode, but even at that I think it was more of a ""I know you went in there to kill Saxon"" look and less of a ""oh shit this is what you do"" look."
Dexter,354xgc,JWard515,2,Fri May 8 03:51:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I definitely agree. As far as the season as a whole went, it didn't feel like a final season. The way it was hyped up, I remember the first trailer had a song playing in it called Run On, and there was a line in it that went ""You may throw your rock and hide your hand, working in the dark against your fellow man, but as sure as God made the day and night, what you do in the dark will be brought to light"" and the chorus went ""you may run for a long time, run on for a long time, run on for a long time, let me tell you that God is gonna cut you down."" and I was so excited, I remember thinking ""shit, it's gonna hit the fuckin fan here real fast when this starts up"" and then it never did. Dexter wasn't being hunted all season like I'd hoped, and I think most people were upset with Oliver Saxon being the ultimate catalyst in the way things went down because he came about so suddenly, it felt like after all these years, the one to bring Dexter down in the end should be someone who'd been on the show for a while."
Dexter,354xgc,JWard515,1 point,Fri May 8 03:45:28 2015 UTC,"What more a torturous punishment than absolute isolation away from everything he wanted, everything he knew, with nothing to do all day and all night but think about it?   Being brought out into the spotlight and shown for who he really is, having to cope with the victims and press and prison and lawyers and evidence and the the consequences for his actions.   I do agree with you that him being by himself with only his own thoughts are a good punishment, but it's not the worse or most torturous thing to have happened to him.   Dexter's name is still good. His reputation is still good. No one knows what he really did, and all of the lives that he truly hurt.   I'm not talking about the serial killers that he took down, he killed innocent people as well. He brought other people down. He killed multiple innocent people, dragged others in the mud, tampered with evidence... and the list goes on.   I wanted Doakes named cleared. I wanted La Guarda's crazy rants to be validated.   I wanted the entire fucking Miami Police Homicide department thoroughly audited to see if anyone was actually helping Dexter, since he was so close to most of them. Were they hiding it, helping him, partners, covering up evidence?    I wanted Angel's name drug through the mud because he was on a bowling team with one of the most dangerous serial killers in America and was too stupid to figure it out.   I wanted the frenzy press that surrounds capturing a serial killer with over 100 kills.   It's one thing to be alone with your thoughts. Dexter can torture himself all he wants, but the real pain would come from tearing away the mask that he made for himself.   I don't care if Dexter contemplates what a monster he is. He has already done that, and accepted it.   I wanted the world to contemplate what a monster Dexter is.  I want Rita's kids to look at him one final time, not with the friendly hugs of someone who has helped them grow up and mature and enjoy childhood, but someone whose actions murdered their mother and tore their family apart. I need Dexter to see the love and acceptance fall from their eyes in fear and understanding.   I wanted a Walter White ending.   That would be the true and final punishment that he needed."
Dexter,354xgc,Sillycomic,2,Thu May 7 19:23:08 2015 UTC,"You make a lot of good points, and I've got to agree. I think your idea of what the ending could have and should have been would have been miles better than what they ended up giving us.   I still think what they went with is acceptable, because Dexter is suffering for what he did, but you're absolutely right him actually having to fully face what he did, having it finally meet the eyes of the world for what it really was would have been so much worse than what he's got going on now. In a sense, even though he's paying for it one way, he still really got away with it in the end."
Dexter,354xgc,JWard515,1 point,Fri May 8 03:39:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is the part that really bothers me. He got away with it.   Is Dexter's suffering acceptable? I agree. I would give it a C- on the scale of consequences that should have happened from his actions.  Honestly, you could have had someone expose Dexter for who he really was, and then had him fake his own death to run away from the whole thing.   At least then everyone would have gotten their own ending. The fallout of Dexter's exposure, coupled with him on the lam for the rest of his life. At least that's a better explanation for faking your own death and running off to the other side of the country."
Dexter,354xgc,Sillycomic,1 point,Fri May 8 16:20:28 2015 UTC,"Until I read Buck's perspective I came to peace with my own theory; that in the disposal of Deb and the abandonment of Harrison, Dexter had succumbed completely to his dark passenger.   The absence of Harry in the final scene supported my stance. No conscience; he had become a serial killer without motive. I could accept that.   Buck's comments blew this out of the water and made me lose even more respect for the show."
Dexter,354xgc,laurandisorder,2,Sun May 17 05:11:51 2015 UTC,"I've always been okay with the way Dexter ended. That doesn't mean I enjoyed the final season, I didn't. I hated the story and the writing was cheap- but I'm okay with the pieces as they are. Deb is dead, Dexter is alone. That's how it should be. People always joke about the lumberjack choice, but that's something I agree with."
Dexter,354xgc,linedrive18,2,Thu May 7 14:51:57 2015 UTC,No.  the only good finale to act as a series finale is the S4 finale. #fuckbuck2013
Dexter,354xgc,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Thu May 7 03:40:32 2015 UTC,Rationalizing the final 2 minutes of the ending after the fact doesn't mean we deserved an entire final season of shit. The execution of the S8 writing and directing was terrible.
Dexter,354xgc,dirtynj,1 point,Thu May 7 15:08:01 2015 UTC,"I think for a psychopath, (although, whether or not he is a true psychopath is debatable) the worst sort of punishment can be found in that person's own mind. I think him being caught--having to face the trials, going to prison, execution, everyone finding out--would have been almost cleansing for him, or a sort of (I hate to use this word) catharsis. It would have been neat though to see everything getting spat back in his face and him having to go through a lawful punishment, for the audience, while he just has this sick smile on his face sitting in the courtroom. But if you, the audience, really want him to suffer, know he is in the state he's put himself. It isn't satisfying as far as conventional storytelling methods go, but I feel like, in his mind, he has by no means gotten away with what he did, and he's certainly being punished."
Dexter,354xgc,Presto-Manifesto,1 point,Fri May 8 05:34:06 2015 UTC,No S8 and the finale will always be shit  They tainted the whole series forever
Dexter,354xgc,JWard515,1 point,Thu May 7 14:23:17 2015 UTC,"I dunno man, I think it's a little harsh to say the whole series is tainted forever. In spite of the popular hate it gets on this sub, I absolutely loved Season 7. In fact, I think Season 7 is everything Season 8 was supposed to be, Dexter on the run again being hunted and on the cusp of being found out for what he was by everyone, having all his lies come unravelled as people put together the pieces to the grisly puzzle he'd been creating over the years.  Really, I enjoyed all the seasons, obviously 8 less than the rest, but still. I think 8 was still good TV, not on par with what I'd come to expect from Dexter but had it been just another season, and not the FINAL season I think it would have stood up as a good season, and obviously that ending would be different, Dexter wouldn't be the lumberjack he is today."
Dexter,354xgc,demanthing,1 point,Fri May 8 04:00:45 2015 UTC,I'm with you S7 was great (better than S5+S6) thats why I had high hopes for S8  S8 has definitely tainted the series reputation its basically become this joke (not just this sub)
Dexter,354xgc,HairyAsHull,1 point,Fri May 8 13:33:40 2015 UTC,They should have altered s7 slightly and ended it there...

Dexter,351jcp,Erekt__Butthole,5,Wed May 6 09:49:45 2015 UTC,"Really good Episode, was the episode where 3 of my friends with whom I rewatched recently, got amazingly hooked and couldn´t stop, well we bingewatched rest of season 1 after that.  Astors Birthday, absolutely BEAUTIFUL Song, one of my all time favourite songs I have ever heard :)"
Dexter,351jcp,WFAlex,2,Thu May 7 19:41:49 2015 UTC,"Great episode, as a young Dexter fan, when  i first watched this i was so certain he was gonna get caught. Great build up, great story with Laguerta and the boy. 8/10"
Dexter,34weun,Sippingin,56,Tue May 5 02:51:28 2015 UTC,I'd agree with you but i think you're giving the writers too much credit.
Dexter,34weun,sky4,8,Tue May 5 03:37:53 2015 UTC,"Dexter has been hinting at this ending to the show forever. He mentions how everything would be fixed and everyone would be safe if he just leaves at least twice a season or more.  Considering that Showtime prohibited the writers from killing Dexter, this was the only way to do it. The last season's plot could have been better though"
Dexter,34weun,Pointwest418,3,Tue May 5 04:23:16 2015 UTC,"Deb also mentions in Season 3 if she is ever ""suffering"" like the file lady with the key lime pie to ""just shoot her"""
Dexter,34weun,100000nopes,5,Mon May 11 04:41:10 2015 UTC,Season 8 was an abomination. Such a damn shame there was so many ways they could have gone to go out on top.
Dexter,34weun,cttouch,2,Tue May 5 08:20:32 2015 UTC,It was par for the course.
Dexter,34weun,moush,1 point,Tue May 5 17:45:02 2015 UTC,They wouldn't let the writers kill him off? Is rather have a ending of him getting caught our killed rather than him just leaving.
Dexter,34weun,thisisbeethoven,1 point,Tue May 5 19:00:40 2015 UTC,"Most long running shows don't want the main character to be killed off. 24 is an example of how a reboot or sequel season can be a good thing.  Still, I think that him exiling himself was going to be the ending they had in mind for a long time. Like I said, Dexter hints at that since season 1"
Dexter,34weun,Pointwest418,3,Tue May 5 19:15:57 2015 UTC,"The original plan from the S1 writers were for him to be caught and executed, so I doubt they were hinting in S1 that he would be an exiled lumberjack in the future."
Dexter,34weun,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Wed May 6 05:27:40 2015 UTC,"Well I mean just because they hint it in season 1 doesn't mean that was always going to be their plan. The first season and the first book are strikingly similar but go their own seperate ways after that, they were just staying true to the book at that point. They couldn't plan it would be a huge show and decide then and there that they couldn't kill him off."
Dexter,34weun,thisisbeethoven,14,Tue May 5 21:48:46 2015 UTC,I actually really like this. Never made the connection of lumberjack chainsaw/death of his mother. Season 8 still was terrible in so many ways but at least the last few moments are more interesting.
Dexter,34weun,Slaytounge,2,Tue May 5 04:21:00 2015 UTC,I find it strange that he chooses one of the most dangerous jobs out there to do
Dexter,34weun,dukefan15,3,Tue May 5 04:36:45 2015 UTC,"Probably because he's just like ""Okay whatever I die, I die."" Makes sense considering how he's torturing himself anyway."
Dexter,34weun,Girafarigging,5,Tue May 5 21:21:16 2015 UTC,What angered me more than anything about the finale was the way he treated Deb's body. She had people that would've wanted to go to her funeral. She deserved better than for body to just go missing like that. Deb was bad ass. I didn't mind the CGI hurricane or the lumberjack ending at all.
Dexter,34weun,red2020,2,Tue May 5 16:06:23 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. I've been thinking he took her body to say his final goodbyes himself.. Why? he caused this, everything that has happened up to the end was his fault. Harry always said ""I never wanted Deb exposed to your actions"" he was right. All that has happened because he wasn't careful enough the guilt was seriously eating at him. Even if they did notice Debra's body gone they probably couldn't do anything about it and blame it on the Hurricane.   Edit: Although you're right she DID deserve better then what she got. Even I don't fully understand why he choose to dump her."
Dexter,34weun,dowieczora,7,Tue May 5 16:17:33 2015 UTC,"Because she was his victim, and he didnt want to pretend that it wasnt his fault maybe"
Dexter,34weun,Girafarigging,3,Tue May 5 17:40:09 2015 UTC,Also he's super selfish. He didn't care about how the other people would feel. It was his sister and his victim and he was going to get the closure he wanted.
Dexter,34weun,pandas_puppet,2,Tue May 5 21:39:41 2015 UTC,"But what about the poor guys at home, like quinn who told her he loved her and batista, he cared too.  I thought jt was a bit harsh to make her body disappear. Just for then really."
Dexter,34weun,Girafarigging,0,Wed May 6 05:57:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah they cared, but Dexter didn't care that they cared. He wasn't right with what he did, but he did it because he only cares about himself. It's definitely harsh but that's just how Dexter is."
Dexter,34weun,jigenvw,2,Wed May 6 11:29:52 2015 UTC,"He buried her at sea, just like all of his victims."
Dexter,34weun,blackflag209,1 point,Tue May 5 17:54:33 2015 UTC,What is it with people that think Deb wouldn't have a funeral?
Dexter,34weun,WFAlex,1 point,Fri May 22 09:56:54 2015 UTC,"He thinks of suicide as ""pathetic"" just sayin"
Dexter,34weun,blackflag209,1 point,Tue May 5 22:42:05 2015 UTC,"Dexter could have killed himself, turned himself in or gotten himself caught, or lived happily ever after with Hannah and Harrison. These endings wouldn't have worked because death would have been to easy and he would've gotten the chair if he was caught. A happy ending would've just been even worse.  They ended it the way they did because he was finally able to feel emotion, he understood empathy and everything was going pretty good for him, until Deb died and he lost all of that. The finale ended with him staring at the camera and for the first time there was no voice over, he was completely dead inside."
Dexter,34weun,elbruce,0,Tue May 5 22:57:28 2015 UTC,I thought it ended just fine.  His wife died in a bathtub full of blood; his secret life came back to destroy his normal life because he thought he could have it all.  It was an excellent four seasons of an excellent TV show.

I pretty much have the same feeling about the series as most in this sub, except 2 things.    I miss Cody and Astor and they really added quite a layer to dexter's character.  Jennifer Carpetener's acting is average at best. I can't stand any scenes with her crying, but it looked exactly like an average actress being asked to cry"

Dexter,34to55,fiibonacci,20,Mon May 4 13:54:40 2015 UTC,"I think they mainly just show Dexter talking to Harry so we can hear what he's thinking. It's much more interesting and easy to show him having a conversation than show Dexter just standing completely still for 5 minutes staring into space. It has nothing to do with being a psychopath. Travis is crazy and thinks Gellar is alive and telling him what to do when in reality he killed Gellar. Travis actually believes Gellar is alive so he has some serious mental problems. Dexter knows Harry isn't really there, he just has his ""Harry passenger"" to help him work though his problems kind of like a conscious. Most people talk to themselves to work through stuff, Dexter pretends he talks to Harry."
Dexter,34to55,BlindStark,0,Mon May 4 14:07:18 2015 UTC,Add a spoiler tag.
Dexter,34to55,BumWarrior69,4,Mon May 4 14:12:47 2015 UTC,Why the down votes? Gellar thing is totally a spoiler
Dexter,34to55,Billyywtf,3,Mon May 4 21:33:27 2015 UTC,What kind of psychopath (pun intended) browses a subreddit for a show that has been over for two years and doesn't expect spoilers?
Dexter,34to55,reiqwer,1 point,Thu May 7 00:08:12 2015 UTC,"Pretty good reasoning, thanks for clearing it up."
Dexter,34to55,hollowaydivision,1 point,Mon May 4 14:23:26 2015 UTC,"It's still somewhat of a narrative shortcut, just like the voiceovers. The idea is that Dexter's personality/Hall's acting opposite Remar, who never had scenes with Hall, the star, just the young Dexter -- also, at the end of S2 they were kind of running out of new information flashbacks could give us. And both of those factors, particularly Hall's acting and how fascinating Dexter's inner life is compared to his outer life, outweigh the cheapness of the shortcut. It's only because the show went on so long that it became kinda noticeable."
Dexter,34to55,ikevinax,7,Sun May 10 11:46:46 2015 UTC,To clarify one point: Harry is not the dark passenger. This is a misconception. His dark passenger is simply his urge to kill.  Source: I read the first book.
Dexter,34to55,thisisbeethoven,2,Mon May 4 23:48:05 2015 UTC,Continue reading them they're great and only share the first season in common. Just force yourself through the 3rd.
Dexter,34to55,TheNameOfTheRose,5,Tue May 5 00:51:04 2015 UTC,Dexter was certainly a psychopath. He fits the profile.
Dexter,34to55,FlyMyPretty,6,Mon May 4 15:23:28 2015 UTC,"To start with, perhaps, but later on less so."
Dexter,34to55,TheNameOfTheRose,7,Mon May 4 17:44:25 2015 UTC,"You are probably right due to the up and down quality of the writing after, say, the fourth season.   It's just a misconception that psychopaths are completely devoid of empathy or able to bond with other humans in a meaningful way. It is possible, just less likely and not as profound, maybe, as in ""normal"" people.   Dexter loved his sister and his son, in his own way, but still almost always put himself first. He allowed Deb to risk her career and even freedom covering up his crimes and he abandoned his son.   Maybe I'm wrong. I haven't rewatched any of the last few seasons after the Trinity season because the dip in quality was so bad. Lol"
Dexter,34to55,sky4,1 point,Mon May 4 20:41:00 2015 UTC,You aren't wrong. They were always camouflage and he ran from everything because he was likely to be caught soon. He got sloppy
Dexter,34to55,kebabmybob,2,Sat May 16 07:07:41 2015 UTC,he got better
Dexter,34to55,thisisbeethoven,2,Tue May 5 03:39:14 2015 UTC,Does anybody have the YouTube video of all the time the doctor says 'psychopath' in the final season? I need a good laugh.
Dexter,34to55,der1x,2,Mon May 4 22:36:27 2015 UTC,"Psychopaths definitely have emotions, they just have watered down emotions. Looking at my DSM-IV-TR (I know the DSM-5 is out now) from college, Dexter definitely fits ASPD (all psychopaths have ASPD but not all people who have ASPD are psychopaths).  A. Pervasive pattern since the age of 15 years as indicated by three or more of the following:   (1) Failure to conform to social with respect to lawful behaviors as indicated by repeatedly preforming acts that are grounds for arrest. (2) Deceitfulness as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or conning people for personal profit or plesure. (4) Irritability and aggressiveness, as indicated by repeated physical fights or assults. (5) Reckless disregaurd for safety of self or others. (7) Lack of remorse, as indicated by being indifferent to or rationalizing having hurt, mistreated, or stolen form another.   B. Individual is at least 18 years old.  C. There is evidence of Conduct Disorder with onset before age 15.  D. The occurrence of antisocial behavior is not exclusively during the course of Schizophrenia or Manic Episode.  TL;DR: Him fitting ASPD criteria alongside with him needing to kill, I'd say it's a pretty safe call to say he's a Psychopath."
Dexter,34to55,elmarko44,2,Mon May 4 22:50:36 2015 UTC,Dexter doesn't actually see Harry. And Travis is just a fucked up crazy possible schizo.
Dexter,34to55,FightFromTheInside,2,Wed May 6 03:06:40 2015 UTC,"Dexter IS a murdering psychopath. The difference is, we're made to ""like"" Dexter.  It's the flipside of the ""flawed hero"" that was popularized by Indiana Jones.  Dexter is the ""redemptive villain"" - an evil person with enough good qualities to be likable. You're supposed to be conflicted about liking him.  Anyway, Dexter is a murdering psychopath"
Dexter,34to55,oldskoolpleb,2,Mon May 4 18:25:42 2015 UTC,And that is one of the things which make this series so good.
Dexter,34to55,JeamBim,1 point,Thu May 7 23:19:12 2015 UTC,"Dexters Dark Passenger is his psychopathic personality. Dexter is very much a psychopath, in that he needs to kill to stop his urges and there are some other very distinct clinical details to his personality that point us to classifying him as a psycho.  Harry isn't what makes him kill, Harry is a personification of his conscience. Its never an hallicunation of any kind, it is just him trying to find the balance between handling with conscience vs. handling the dark passenger mixed up with some psycho thoughts."
Dexter,34to55,kylehudgins,1 point,Mon May 11 05:54:19 2015 UTC,"Psychopaths aren't people who dont feel emotion, they're people who are able to unfeel their emotions, and choose which ones they tune into."

Dexter,34u60v,zoolilba,3,Mon May 4 16:18:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah she found out. The books and the TV series are only similar in plot of the first season/book. After that, the two timelines diverge a lot."
Dexter,34sax4,logdawg,3,Mon May 4 03:19:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's a little wooden box that folds open, I'm not sure if it was knives or if it had his drills and stuff in it though. I can see why they'd get rid of it since it would be harder for Dexter to carry it around everywhere.  Here are some pics:  Before dumping his old tools:  http://imgur.com/LOLSJAR.png  Here is what the box looked like but I don't have any screencaps:  http://imgur.com/GITMNvB.png  I'm sure if you type in season 1 kills on YouTube you can find a video with it."
Dexter,34rpec,Wastelandx,23,Mon May 4 00:01:08 2015 UTC,"Definitely Trinity. To me, he was the most balanced, well executed killer the show had. Not to mention John Lithgow is a fantastic actor who brought the character to life very well."

Dexter,34rpec,Xynthsplit,3,Mon May 4 06:26:08 2015 UTC,The dynamic between him and Dex was just so well done. It also helps that they're both fantastic actors. Watching Sirko and Dexter team up briefly was really great to watch.

Dexter,34rpec,WFAlex,2,Mon May 4 15:50:16 2015 UTC,"I'm probarly the only one that likes Travis Marshall. I liked Season 6 in general except for the confusion that happened with Geller/Travis, would've been so much better without it. Main reason why I like it is because of the way he performed the murders, the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse, the angel and the whore of Babylon. I loved it. I'm not religious but some things from religion always interested me, so maybe that's why I liked it so much."
Dexter,34rpec,Chandelurist,2,Tue May 12 16:19:05 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit late to the party, but I agree! I'm re watching the series and just reached season 6, I had completely forgotten about travis. I'm interested in religion so the way he staged his murders was fascinating. Plus it was good to have a serial killer who was actually insane and unstable rather than more calculated (not that they're not all insane).  I didn't realise how much hats there was for travis or the confusion. I can't remember if they fully explain the split personality disorder in the series, but it's obvious to me that's what happened with Travis."

Dexter,34pxnt,Starburstnova,14,Sun May 3 16:17:33 2015 UTC,Precisely! I think the actress did a great job with the character...I just really can't stand the character or her involvement in the show.

Dexter,34pxnt,Unwanted_Commentary,12,Sun May 3 21:15:58 2015 UTC,I know. I liked her too.   I especially liked her because she understood dexters addiction. For me that was amazing to finally have someone Dexter can talk to about this stuff without it just being someone inside his head.   And then Lila began to obsess over Dexter and I liked that too. I know those kind of women who are manipulative and get their clutches in a guy they want and it's all over. It was really interesting.   I loved all of it. And I even liked when Dexter realized she was the enemy and needed to be taken down. I kind of wish she could have made a decent comeback tormenting dexters life some more instead of getting a post season 2 death.    Oh well.   She was a fun and interesting dynamic for Dexter to play off of. I am not really sure about all the hate for her myself.
Dexter,34pxnt,Sillycomic,10,Mon May 4 00:10:59 2015 UTC,"I liked her better than Rita, that's for sure."
Dexter,34pxnt,FoxIslander,7,Sun May 3 21:31:32 2015 UTC,Agreed. Rita the broken wounded girl who makes Dexter feel safe from season 1 was cool and fun and interesting.   Rita from season 2 became like Skyler Jr and I was not as interested in her as much. I honestly thought it was better if Dexter moved on at that point.

Dexter,34pxnt,bam2_89,2,Mon May 11 04:58:56 2015 UTC,I think she added a lot to the one season.  The people that say we didn't need her are the same ones that would love extra little wrinkles in the plot and story arches in the later seasons such as her.

People weren't supposed to like her for taking Dexter from Rita and framing Batista. She was hot and that's why people liked her. She has an accent and she's pale with black hair and it's probably more unique in Miami so she stands out. She wore see through shirts and walked around naked everywhere which is pretty damn hot."
Dexter,34pxnt,Teqnique_757,1 point,Sun May 3 22:52:15 2015 UTC,She doesn't really have much of an ass.
Dexter,34pxnt,der1x,2,Wed May 6 00:47:26 2015 UTC,"I'll disagree, lumen and the chick from the last season that was dexter's love interest were far worse."
Dexter,34pxnt,Alibear,5,Mon May 4 05:59:31 2015 UTC,"Lumen is bad but I don't hate her for being Lumen.   Yvonne Stravohski(Hannah) is beautiful but I don't think she's a very good actress. She just doesn't seem like she is into it as much as her costars. I can see why you don't like Hannah, but for me it makes sense for them to bring another love interest in after Rita has been dead for 2-3 seasons."
Dexter,34pxnt,bouloo,4,Wed May 6 00:47:53 2015 UTC,I really loved season 2 overall... Except for Lila! Everything about her is just awful!
Dexter,34pxnt,Fuzzy-Hat,5,Sun May 3 16:40:22 2015 UTC,"I'm British and her accent was such an insult. Is the actress British? It was a try too hard to sound sexy accent. I skip season 2 entirely because of her when I re watch, which is such a shame because I really enjoyed Doakes tailing Dexter"
Dexter,34pxnt,bouloo,6,Sun May 3 22:22:37 2015 UTC,Yeah Jaime Murray is English she was in Hustle as well and had the same accent so I think its real.
Dexter,34pxnt,WeaponexT,1 point,Sun May 3 22:48:00 2015 UTC,Thanks! It sounds forced but also very posh. Maybe it's because I'm not very posh ahaha
Dexter,34pxnt,darkboyutz,2,Mon May 4 10:18:04 2015 UTC,I just wish they'd of followed the second book. The screaming potatoes would've been fucked up
Dexter,34pxnt,WFAlex,2,Mon May 4 09:34:17 2015 UTC,She's the reason I skipped some parts from season 2.  I mean how come Batista and others considered her pretty when she was just an anorexic bitch with the most annoying british accent possible?
Dexter,34pxnt,free2live,5,Sun May 3 15:25:50 2015 UTC,"British accent of woman is the most sexy thing I can personally imagine, I on the other hand hate french accent but hey preferences are different;)"
Dexter,34pxnt,santaman123,6,Sun May 3 19:51:06 2015 UTC,"I don't want to argue personal preference... but dude, she's hawt."
Dexter,34pxnt,darkboyutz,-2,Sun May 3 20:16:30 2015 UTC,"I just finished watching SE2E09 and it was revealed that she called Jimenez AND snuck into Rita's house, and she's a total psycho bitch, I hate her character."
Dexter,34pxnt,logdawg,31,Sun May 3 15:39:22 2015 UTC,"If you hate her character, then the actress did a perfect job. You're supposed to hate Lila."
Dexter,34qrzc,rogueherrie,2,Sun May 3 19:12:59 2015 UTC,"I heard that Showtime rushed them in order to get the season started so it can get debut with Ray Donovan.   I don't have any sources but I remember reading it somewhere. It makes sense when at least the seasons before them were ok(3-7).   But season 8 is total fucking shit, especially the ending."
Dexter,34qrzc,der1x,5,Sun May 3 19:19:58 2015 UTC,"3-7? I feel like 3,4 were on a level that 5-7 never reached."
Dexter,34qrzc,Erekt__Butthole,2,Sun May 3 21:42:52 2015 UTC,"5 was very good still compared to most TV, and yes 6 was bad, but 7 was just as good as the early seasons. People forget that."
Dexter,34qrzc,pacoheadley,2,Tue May 5 08:10:55 2015 UTC,"5 still had a ton of screwups. Dexter's kill of Liddy and the blood on Quinn's shoe was resolved faster than it was introduced. Dexter/Lumen behind a sheet of plastic stopping Deb from finding out? Glazing over Rita's death. Killing the family dynamic. Trying to follow up Trinity and failing.  Season 6 was a piece of shit, and I don't think S7 was much better. Dexter killing a guy in an airport, and at a firing range? Dexter being cured of his psychopathy via Hannah, a woman he has 0 chemistry with. Isaak Sirko being killed too early. Deb never asking about Doakes/Lumen etc.   ALL of the big things that happened had NO consequences in S8."
Dexter,34qrzc,Erekt__Butthole,3,Tue May 5 11:00:49 2015 UTC,Erekt_butthole makes a good point.
Dexter,34qrzc,theyak93,1 point,Tue May 5 15:58:57 2015 UTC,Final seasons started a few months earlier than all the rest
Dexter,34qrzc,Presto-Manifesto,1 point,Sat May 16 07:08:31 2015 UTC,"They had that particular ending in mind for a while I guess. But yeah they wanted to do something different; not a typical happy ending, although I think there had to be other ulterior reasons why it ended like it did. The Deb actress didn't want to keep playing her character forever so she was probably for her dying. The show runners wanted to keep Dexter alive for potential future material. I don't understand how it came out so sloppy even though they said they had it planned for so long."
Dexter,34oxc9,Erekt__Butthole,6,Sun May 3 05:12:01 2015 UTC,"They probably shot the first episode or two as a pilot to get support for a full season order. Once production on later episodes started, they probably changed some things that were probably overlooked in the first place."
Dexter,34oxc9,Andrado,3,Sun May 3 06:58:24 2015 UTC,"^ this, but i also think the peadophile he killed, he didnt simply want him too lay on the table, he was actually furiously mad, and went all abeshit on him."
Dexter,34oxc9,MyNamesNotObama,2,Sun May 3 11:41:23 2015 UTC,Doesn't Dexter have a particular distaste for pedophiles? Considering he actually likes kids since they remind him of the innocence he lost
Dexter,34oxc9,xerophyl,2,Sun May 3 19:50:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah i remember another pedophile who took pictures of astor, he killed him in a fit of rage if i remember correctly, so he didn't use plastic that time too, i think depending on the crime, he will go crazy"

Dexter,34l0x1,MICHAELSD01,3,Sat May 2 09:59:53 2015 UTC,"But seriously, there's nothing bonus that's worthwhile."
Dexter,34l0x1,MICHAELSD01,2,Sat May 2 10:00:15 2015 UTC,"Well according to the cast, there ARE blooper reels that are shown at the filming wrap party. There's probably a ton of other cool things they could put in the extras. Why didn't they you ask?  SHOWTIME."
Dexter,34j83i,Erekt__Butthole,14,Fri May 1 16:45:52 2015 UTC,Congrats on having an actual quality post on this sub. There are a lot of times where you try to figure out if Dexter is the bad guy playing the good guy or vice versa. Great analysis
Dexter,34j83i,XA36,3,Fri May 1 17:21:30 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I just watched this episode last night"
Dexter,34j83i,masonrb500,3,Fri May 1 20:49:54 2015 UTC,"Not that I'm assuming you haven't read it, but the book deals with this - although the TV show strays away from the book a hell of a lot - that all of a sudden he'd feel bad for leaving them and that they're a part of him. Always appreciated that they included that small bit."
Dexter,34j83i,th3f0xx,0,Fri May 1 22:52:23 2015 UTC,Nice spoiler tag bud
Dexter,34j83i,fl00rit,1 point,Sat May 2 17:20:46 2015 UTC,This episode came out almost 8 years ago. Don't browse the subreddit until you're caught up.
Dexter,34j83i,fl00rit,0,Sat May 2 23:13:59 2015 UTC,"I am caught up, for the people that havent seen it you should at least mark your post with a spoiler tag"
Dexter,34j83i,fl00rit,2,Sun May 3 04:33:35 2015 UTC,"Why are they on the subreddit if they haven't seen an early episode of Season 2? How does Dark Passenger Speech ruin anything? It just sounds like Dexter talks about his DP, and probably to himself."
Dexter,34j83i,fl00rit,0,Sun May 3 04:42:50 2015 UTC,Saying he killed his brother is a spoiler. And you just threw rhat shit in there with no warning. People browse subreddits becuase they find the show interesting even if there not caught up. But when they see a spoiler tag they know they probably shouldnt venture over that post. All you have to do is post a spoiler tag in the title of your post and that would help people out. Why is this so hard to understand?

Dexter,34dmel,ShadowSora,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:41:44 2015 UTC,I think he'd have to move and get a new identity. It'd be really tough for him to get away with being a serial killer in a small town when the government knows who your dad is and what happened to your mom and sister.

Dexter,34hidj,Upsidedwn7,18,Fri May 1 04:55:39 2015 UTC,Probably.
Dexter,34hidj,ik1020,13,Fri May 1 05:06:13 2015 UTC,"Crying over the person you love dying right in front of you? What are you, some type of normal human being? I'm sure you'll have plenty of other normal relationships that will totally work out for you and won't involve them being serial killers, having their skin pulled off, being your own brother, being married, getting killed, etc. Deb should be in a straight jacket by now with all she's been through."
Dexter,34hidj,BlindStark,3,Fri May 1 06:55:22 2015 UTC,"The Lundy romance was creepy AF. I love Keith, but he looks like a f**king mummy. And he's like 30 years older."
Dexter,34hidj,dukefan15,0,Fri May 1 18:07:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah I totally agree. And I saw it coming early on in the season and the whole time I was like ""ew ew ew ew"""
Dexter,34hidj,Slaytounge,4,Fri May 1 19:15:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, that scene is sort of awkward to watch. I can't say the acting was bad but for whatever reason that scene is uncomfortable. Don't cry like that."
Dexter,34hidj,BlindStark,5,Fri May 1 06:32:39 2015 UTC,I think anyone crying usually tends to be a bit awkward since you aren't totally sure how to deal with the situation.
Dexter,34hidj,Thatonegamerguy,-14,Fri May 1 07:01:28 2015 UTC,"No, we all hate Deb."
Dexter,34cwmb,Erekt__Butthole,10,Thu Apr 30 03:24:51 2015 UTC,"Well in an episode in the first season where they are investigating the murder of Jorge Castillo's wife, Masuka notices an injection wound and does the tox screen, and they do find M99. So I guess it's detectable. But perhaps only if you run the right tests, which you would only do if you saw the injection wound and knew what you were looking for. When they find the M99 Dexter gets really worried because he used a fake name to get it that he thinks could be traced back to him.... Seems like a definite hole in his method where he could easily get caught."
Dexter,34cwmb,cheer4lyfetotally,4,Thu Apr 30 03:36:12 2015 UTC,He also says he used a half dose on a certain someone so it wasn't detectable. So I guess it only shows up if there is too much.
Dexter,34cwmb,BlindStark,1 point,Thu Apr 30 12:55:40 2015 UTC,Unless I'm mistaken you have to test for specific chemicals or whatever when they run tox screens. It's also possible that m99 would only be found at the injection site.
Dexter,349cdd,Erekt__Butthole,3,Wed Apr 29 09:43:23 2015 UTC,I'd give it an 8/10. It was my favourite Dexter villain's debut. A good season 1 episode overall.
Dexter,349cdd,nuggetinabuiscuit,2,Wed Apr 29 19:20:02 2015 UTC,"Love this episode. The husband and wife are both great characters. It manages to involve rita with the maid to show Dexter's problems acme set up a good story with future episodes.   That kill line, ""god bless America"" is so perfect. Also I love when Dexter has real conversations right before he kills someone."

Dexter,345tsr,icantdrawcircles,6,Tue Apr 28 17:49:47 2015 UTC,I'm actually not upset with this either. Season 8 ended terribly imo and maybe this can fix it!
Dexter,345tsr,Boogerschmidt,4,Tue Apr 28 18:36:16 2015 UTC,I'm super excited about this possibility!
Dexter,345tsr,jerekdeter626,5,Tue Apr 28 18:54:30 2015 UTC,"I'd be really happy too, as long as the writing is better than the last season or two. Even if they were to return to their original quality, I don't see how they're gonna explain that ending."
Dexter,345tsr,BlindStark,6,Tue Apr 28 19:10:41 2015 UTC,Pretend it never happened and start a new story hopefully or it was all dream and Dexter wakes up from his terrible nightmare.

Dexter,345tsr,gaylord_buttram_MD,6,Wed Apr 29 01:46:07 2015 UTC,I loved Deb. Jennifer Carpenter's acting was the best thing about the last season.
Dexter,345tsr,nameless88,-2,Wed Apr 29 05:25:12 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't trust them anymore.    I mean...I'd probably watch it, but after I heard enough from the fanbase and was told it wasn't a complete trainwreck like season 8 was."
Dexter,345tsr,ostrichzigga,6,Tue Apr 28 20:50:00 2015 UTC,Or just watch it and make your own conclusions
Dexter,345tsr,nameless88,-1,Wed Apr 29 00:28:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I also just don't want to invest time in it if it's going to be terrible. I'd give them the benefit of the doubt, but, let's be honest, they don't deserve that."
Dexter,345tsr,dukefan15,4,Wed Apr 29 01:26:00 2015 UTC,"Your still here, talking about the show. So they obviously didn't screw up that bad"
Dexter,345tsr,nameless88,-5,Wed Apr 29 01:48:28 2015 UTC,Because I love this subreddit. Bashing how bad the show got was pretty much the only thing that kept this show alive for me in the end.
Dexter,345tsr,Girafarigging,4,Wed Apr 29 02:54:37 2015 UTC,That's a horrible reason to care for a show in any capacity.
Dexter,345tsr,nameless88,-1,Wed Apr 29 03:55:41 2015 UTC,"It's more like I care about this community. But, the people that took charge of the show ran it into the ground, and in the end the only thing that helped me power through it was hanging out with the nice folks on here and all of us lamenting over how terrible it got.    And don't act like it was only me, either. We had an episode discussion thread for Breaking Bad on here during the night that the episode Ozymandias was up against Dexter. We all knew it was an absolute disaster, but, we'd already become invested i the show, and we were all like ""Fuck it, might as well see where this is going."""
Dexter,345tsr,davros_,28,Wed Apr 29 05:31:28 2015 UTC,"Opening sequence:  Shot from above Dexter's bed as he's tossing and turning. Screen flashes white and shows a quick sequence of the events of seasons 5-8. Dexter jolts upright, realizing that it was all just a terrible, terrible nightmare."

Dexter,345tsr,denvertebows15,15,Tue Apr 28 15:28:52 2015 UTC,"That would be a season 9, not a spin-off. A spin-off would focus on like Quinn after Deb dies and maybe Dexter shows up in a few episodes"
Dexter,345tsr,Envious_of_Apathy,5,Tue Apr 28 16:33:26 2015 UTC,"Well, they'd look dumb once they told everyone that season 8 was the final season and then released another, so I guess they gotta call it a spin-off."
Dexter,345tsr,lechattueur,6,Tue Apr 28 17:45:03 2015 UTC,"They can call it whatever they want, but if it just follows Dexter then its not a spin off."
Dexter,345tsr,GeauxOU,2,Tue Apr 28 18:04:56 2015 UTC,"I would still consider it a spin off if every other main character was replaced and they say an exponential amount of time has passed... 8-10 years. Then it really isnt a continuation. Its a new story... a lot can change in 10 years... i wasnt the same person i am today as i was ten years ago. It also gives the opportunity for Harrison, Astor, and Cody to mean more than just a fuckin hole ridden time filler. Especially if... say... one of them were in Law Enforcement?   Even if it sucked itd still be neat to see."
Dexter,345tsr,luismpinto,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:36:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah the only character you could follow is Quinn since they killed the good ones except Batista, but I would not watch a show with Quinn as the main character, that would just be plain boring."

Dexter,345tsr,Xkimberxkae,2,Tue Apr 28 17:42:36 2015 UTC,"No, there wasn't. It was canned before being produced, just like Matrix 2 and 3 and Indiana Jones 4."
Dexter,345tsr,dukefan15,2,Tue Apr 28 20:18:02 2015 UTC,Would that really be a Spin-off? Spin-offs typically follow a secondary character. If the show is about Dexter still then it's really just a new season of Dexter.
Dexter,345tsr,luismpinto,7,Tue Apr 28 23:07:08 2015 UTC,"The show ended the way it did, because they were wanting to bring Dexter Morgan back in a few years. At least that is sort of a rumor."
Dexter,345tsr,luismpinto,2,Tue Apr 28 16:35:32 2015 UTC,Well it looks like that may be the case...
Dexter,345tsr,luismpinto,7,Tue Apr 28 16:45:54 2015 UTC,I just REALLY want to see Dexter in the Avengers Films (since he is technically a Marvel character) even if its just for 5 seconds.

Dexter,345tsr,cheer4lyfetotally,5,Wed Apr 29 05:46:18 2015 UTC,But Jeff Lindsay has basically confirmed it in the tweet.

Dexter,345tsr,ThatFergusonKid,-2,Tue Apr 28 20:01:42 2015 UTC,Not yet. Meaning probably not ever. Wishful thinking is not a confirmation.
Dexter,345tsr,welshwordman,7,Tue Apr 28 20:51:50 2015 UTC,"would be good if it was just focused around Homicide with Masuka, Angel, Quinn etc. and in Season 2 or something they start finding stuff that leads them to beleive that dexter was the bay harbour butcher and we'll finally see their reactions!!"
Dexter,346vsg,rogueherrie,4,Tue Apr 28 19:49:29 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean, no word on a spinoff though. Michael C. Hall said he'd probably be interested in doing one though so maybe one day. We probably wouldn't get any other characters that were on the show though sadly. I'd check out some other shows like Hannibal if you haven't. If they could reboot Dexter with a new director and bring it to art level of Hannibal with a brand new story that would be amazing."
Dexter,346vsg,BlindStark,3,Tue Apr 28 21:23:19 2015 UTC,"I know what you're feeling. I had a love-hate relationship with Dexter. I saw the first 5 seasons in an almost marathon way (I did with season 1 and 2 a big mistake - I started seeing the eleventh episode late in the night, before a work day - but there was no way in hell I could not see the finale after that ;-)  In the 6th season I got fed up. The episode with the dead guy and the snakes was the last one I saw. Meanwhile, I moved to live with my girlfriend, and forgot about Dexter for a long time - and only a few weeks ago I restarted from where I stopped.  I thought that the 6th season wrapped up nicely, even with Colin Hanks and the other guy, and being IMO the weakest season. The 7th was allright, I guess, and the last one was great... Except for the last two episodes. I wish I hadn't seen those.   Regarding other shows, I have really no idea. I guess this is the time to start seeing The Wire, True Detective, and anything else I find.   There was today a post about an 'Untitled Dexter Spinoff' in IMDB - I really don't know.  But imagine how awesome it would be if there was another serial killer in Miami PD - Masuka! A seemingly goofy guy that is really a cold blooded killer, trying to maintain appearences of being a normal guy and trying at all cost to blend in..."
Dexter,346vsg,luismpinto,4,Tue Apr 28 23:16:05 2015 UTC,"How amazing would it be if in the final episode, we start to hear some of the narrating spoken by the other characters and we learn they are serial killers too.  Killing when they haven't been able to get hard evidence on them.  That'd be one fuck up of a twist."
Dexter,346vsg,luismpinto,2,Wed Apr 29 09:04:31 2015 UTC,"That would be awesome! Man, almost all the alternate endings I read about on reddit were much better than the official one..."
Dexter,346vsg,JeamBim,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:33:51 2015 UTC,"Op, I got into Hannibal after missing dex, and it was the bestdecision I've ever made."
Dexter,346vsg,JeamBim,1 point,Sat May 2 21:40:10 2015 UTC,Interesting.  Is it the films or the series?
Dexter,346vsg,Rylingo,1 point,Sun May 3 16:46:43 2015 UTC,"The series. I went into the series having no knowledge of the movies, my first intro to Hannibal lecter as a character was from MadTV. I was basically set up to not enjoy the series, but it's too incredible to not enjoy. Mads is an incredible lecter, and better than Hopkins in my opinion. Give the first episode a viewing, I promise you'll be hooked"
Dexter,346vsg,JeamBim,1 point,Sun May 3 16:51:59 2015 UTC,Cheers - I'll give it a go.  I'm also told The Wire & Fargo are must watches??
Dexter,346vsg,JeamBim,2,Sun May 3 19:10:00 2015 UTC,The Wire is my favourite TV show of all time. The first 4 or 5 episodes are tough though. There's a lot of groundwork being put down.  Couldn't really get into Fargo but I know a lot of people loved it.
Dexter,346vsg,JeamBim,1 point,Wed May 6 09:06:42 2015 UTC,"Never seen either, actually. I want to get into Fargo, I heard its great, but there's simply too much wire for me to watch, cause I have no real interest in it."
Dexter,342xhk,crosscurious227,12,Mon Apr 27 21:58:31 2015 UTC,"In S01E02, Masuka says to Deb ""Come closer Morgan and I'll melt your heart."" That's when he and the rest of the cops are standing around the ice block of fingers from ITK.  Masuka: ""Masuka only swings one way...""  Deb: ""Yeah from vine to vine!""  Also Masuka's truck scene in S04E04, the shemale stuff he mentions to Lundy... Masuka is all over the place. I hate S5-8 but the perfect scene you need is in S06E12, with Masuka doing the Yoda impression."

Dexter,342xhk,AnorexicManatee,3,Wed Apr 29 02:29:39 2015 UTC,"I'm doing a rewatch now so here's a few fresh in my mind.  When he is trying to get everyone at the station to come watch his paper presentation thing.  When he brags to Dexter about being Lead Forensics Investigator on the Bay Harbor Butcher case, then mopes when he is edged out by the FBI. Also when he is talking about the algae they found on the rocks.  When he tells Dexter that he can think of some more uses for the remote controlled table in the Ice Truck Killer's freezer and Dexter says ""that's my sister out there"" and Masuka feels really bad - could be awkward.  Also I thought all of his interactions with the blonde lab tech/intern were pretty awkward.  Spoilers below... . . . . . . . When he says ""a badass like Doakes would rather burn than get burned"" and thinks it would be a great line for his book on the BHB (and assumes everyone involved will also be writing a book).  This isn't really R-rated but a little risqué.. When Deb takes off her shirt to ask him how tall her shooter was, he can't concentrate because he's staring at her boobs.  When the team comes in to see Rita in the tub, he says he has imagined her naked plenty of times but never like this. Not risqué but she is in a bathtub full of blood so it is a little gruesome to show a class."

Dexter,342on0,rogueherrie,6,Mon Apr 27 20:56:24 2015 UTC,"The doctor said it would have to be a miracle for Deb to wake up and even then she'd probably be a potato for the rest of her life. Deb said previously if she was ever like that to just pull the plug. If Dexter wanted to kill himself he would have, he pretty much buried his boat with Deb and used the life raft to get out. He wanted to live with the pain he caused because he felt that's what he deserved."
Dexter,342on0,BlindStark,2,Mon Apr 27 21:53:51 2015 UTC,"So next question - why in God's name did Dex bury her at sea?  Did he want a quick funeral because he decided to move on?  I'm gutted we didn't get proper closure for the guys at Miami Metro.  Loved them all.  All unique.    Dex's main passion was Harrison and Hannah.  I get why he wanted to stay away from them because he thinks he ruins those most closest to him, but the whole point of him moving to Argentina was to begin a new life and he realised he didn't need to kill towards the end - plus Hannah knew the real Dexter which is what counts.  He should have gone!  Poor Harrison is essentially an orphan now."
Dexter,342on0,BlindStark,2,Tue Apr 28 08:38:15 2015 UTC,"I said the same when it aired. It's most likely just because they wanted a cool send off for Deb. It's much more symbolic to do it that way instead of leaving her body at the hospital. White sheet vs black plastic, dumping her like all his vitcims, etc. It's better than being turned into a bench and it was a badass send off in the storm. Season 8 didn't make much sense at all really and I doubt the writers actually had a good reason, at least her dead body wasn't sent off the boat via treadmill.   If you want to think her death in a nicer way, you could say Dexter buried her at sea so every time he goes out into the water he'll be with Deb instead of alone. He may not be able to go back to Miami to see her grave so that's one way he could still feel close to his sister. She'll always be with him. The water was where he found peace and was one place where he could always clear his mind. He even goes there after Rita's death. The water was special to him and so was Deb, it was a good final resting place because it brought closure to Dexter. I'd also say showing Dexter dump her like his other victims shows he takes responsibility for her death. It fits with him going to live alone because he feels like he hurts everyone around him and doesn't want Harrison and Hannah be his next victims.  I agree with Deb though, just go be ""fucking happy."""

Dexter,342on0,dilemmaemma15,1 point,Tue Apr 28 12:31:03 2015 UTC,"I just finished the series as well and everyone told me to stop watching after season 4, but I kept watching. Honestly didn't think the show got too weird until season 7 and then season 8 was just a bit of a disappointment. I couldn't believe he just left Harrison behind, the poor kid was gonna be traumatized either way but now he's living in a foreign country with a person he barely knows. Bad ending. Also thought it was strange there was no Harry hallucination/conversation at the end. The final few episodes just felt so rushed."

Dexter,33zycm,rogueherrie,5,Tue Apr 28 09:04:13 2015 UTC,"Way too early in the grand scope of things, I agree. However, you never know if your show is going to get picked up for another season so they probably wanted to bring in those viewers early on."
Dexter,33zycm,flixated,3,Tue Apr 28 16:35:37 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't have really been a great series finale though, great season finale sure but absolutely no closure at all, season five should have been the last dealing with dexter coping with rita's death and him making big mistakes because of it and miami metro closing in on him"

My wait was 11 weeks. Every part is hand-made including the bloodslides so it takes them time. Plus they only do 10 per month."
Dexter,33oz2p,Deezer19,13,Fri Apr 24 09:42:14 2015 UTC,Do they make a 'fill your own slides' version? The pre filled one feels too boring.
Dexter,33oz2p,futuredestiny,3,Fri Apr 24 09:52:13 2015 UTC,"Fill your own slides? Like they send you a kit of the show-blood lol?  I guess you could make some ''blood'', tear apart the slides (really easy to do actually) and then use a pipette to drop the blood on. I couldn't be bothered myself, I love their work as it is.

Ghosts of people he killed or died because of him watching, too. Except Deb, who is in her car sobbing in the parking lot. Cut to Dexter starring directly in the camera (we got this stare during the actual finale, thankfully), and in Timothy McVeigh style, he stares at the camera long enough that we don't know if he was still alive or dead by the time the screen goes black.  Also, Dexter's final meal would be breakfast. The same ham and eggs meal from the opening credits."
Dexter,33lx78,jabberwocky_,2,Fri Apr 24 01:33:32 2015 UTC,I like this one as well!

Dexter,33lx78,MyNamesNotObama,35,Mon Apr 27 22:32:11 2015 UTC,"One of my bigger problems (of many) with the finale is that there is no payoff or closure for any of the secondary characters (Bautista, Quinn, or Masuka).   Sure, Quinn and Bautista saw Dexter stab Saxon in the neck with a pen, but they kinda let that one slide over the whole ""self-defense""/revenge for shooting your sister thing and they left it at that.    Everyone at Miami Metro should have found out that Dexter was the Bay Harbor Butcher. That's the logical conclusion to the show. Their final realizations to Dexter having evaded them so successfully and for so long while living in their midst would have made for some really compelling drama. Imagine what would have happened if Quinn finally put the pieces together from the shit that went down with the creepy photographer guy from Season 5! Or if Angel learned that Deb murdered Maria to cover for Dex!!  Also,  Deb's death felt like it was shoehorned in for shock value. She should have lived and had to face the consequences of killing Laguerta as well as the other deaths she was implicated in. Or she could have gotten away and ended up eating ice cream in Argentina with Harrison instead of Hannah if you'd prefer a more happy ending.  TL;DR: None of the other characters except Dexter have a true ending to their character arcs, and they shouldn't have killed Debra ""Shit a Brick and Fuck Me with It"" Morgan"
Dexter,33lx78,ozarkslam21,8,Thu Apr 23 18:23:47 2015 UTC,"What about an ending where Deb dies, which angers Dex to the point of killing Saxon and revealing his secret? the whole department now knows he was the most dangerous serial killer ever and it cleanses Doakes and Maria - or to go a different way, Hannah dies by that PI guy and Dex kills him infront of Harrison and a whole bus, but leaves Harrison to Debra?"

When she found them in the shipping crate Dexter was literally moments away from killing her and she was completely paralyzed... Like wtf? I get that the show wanted her to get her hands dirty too but couldn't they have found a more plausible way of doing so?  Maybe I'm remembering it wrong but that show just completely started falling apart in the last few seasons which is why I don't remember them as clearly as the earlier ones."
Dexter,33lx78,iamdroppy,4,Thu Apr 23 19:08:20 2015 UTC,"I think she felt like she had to do something, she wasn't thinking clearly and could have shot Dexter also. I thought it was kind of stupid too because it would have made it harder to set up the crime scene I'm sure since she was shot laying down.

Dexter,33lx78,Presto-Manifesto,0,Fri Apr 24 02:28:25 2015 UTC,"I don't know, but a shower thought here... Maybe we don't know what happened with Miami Metro because Dexter doesn't knows, therefore it all happens from his point of view, the whole show...

Dexter walks in and loses all his emotions that he suddenly gained from the sight of their blood. He kills Masuka's daughter for smoking weed (which was a huge revelation) and puts her in the trash bags with dollar store Ryan Gosling. Deb leaves the hospital perfectly fine no potato problems in sight. After all that we get a proper season that ties up all the character and storylines and has a proper antagonist that could actually bring Dexter down in a smart way (not walking by and slashing his tires because it's parked right next to him in broad daylight). I thought it would be awesome if Quinn and Batista get on to Dexter and he has to do something. People would actually be upset if Batista or someone died. Maybe Dexter is about to kill him but he runs instead.  I'd like to see him die though and everyone figure out who he is. Deb would also have to die with him. They could then show everyone's reactions and it would be pretty awesome, insert news clip montage."

I looked into it and I found that Stars was actually restricting them and said they couldn't kill dexter.  However I read this ending on this sub and it is easily my favorite. So if the redditor that came up with this idea is reading this, props to you.  Basically everything happens the same however, homicide finds out Dexter's secret and he is given the death penalty. The series would end with us in the room with him strapped in a chair waiting to get the shot. You fan see doctors preparing the syringe in the corner and dexter narrates the whole thing and questions his life if his actions really were justified. He begins to realize the pain he has caused by doing his killings. The camera pans around the room and the witnesses are all watching him. It will cut back to the witnesses later and it is every major character who dexter has killed or has died as a result of him. Rita, deb, Trinity, all of them. Dexter is shocked and the doctor grabs his arm to give him the shot and it is his father. Hr would say something along the lines of ""I never wanted this for you Dex."" Or ""it wasn't supposed to end like this"" he gives him the shot and then the show would end there or go back to a scene where dexter is in the shipping crate. Dead. Back where it all began"

It would've been awesome to see Miami Metro hunting Dex. See how the world reacts to a serial killer who hid amongst the good guys for so long. Especially since there would be many people who stood behind what Dexter did. He'd be like Batman to them. Doing good things while constantly breaking the law.   We didn't get that with Walt in Breaking Bad because nothing he did was good in anyone's eyes except for his own. We just saw a man crash and burn.

Dexter,33lx78,alibi6,2,Fri Apr 24 12:35:12 2015 UTC,"The fact that the main character is a serial killer who spends his entire life hiding his true nature from the police department he works in and your end game ISNT a manhunt for Dexter is absolutely 100% outrageous. Yes it would have been obvious, yes it would have been somewhat similar to season 2, but seeing every character react to the discovery would have been fantastic. Seeing Deb stuck in the middle would have actually been great character development. Seeing Dexter come to grips with his dilemma: obey the code to survive if it means killing good people or realize he has a conscious would be a fucking fantastic buildup.  Imagine the manhunt ends in a scenario where Dexter sets a trap for the PD since he is cornered, but instead of killing all those former friends he obeys his morals that have been DEVELOPING over the course of the series and turns himself in knowing full damn well it means certain death. That would have been a thrilling ending.  Breaking Bad had a similar premise to Dexter. A case study on the two shows is all you need to know to understand the caliber of the writing teams"
Dexter,33lx78,mongd66,3,Fri Apr 24 23:37:50 2015 UTC,"Deb catches him, Quinn/Batista slowly figure out everything, Dexter is forced to kill one of them to escape and thus leaves behind evidence which allows for a warrant to his apartment.

Dexter,33f8c4,Ammanda13,2,Wed Apr 29 12:47:37 2015 UTC,Deb and Dex were just adoptive siblings. They weren't related by blood.
Dexter,33f8c4,LevyWife,2,Wed Apr 22 02:00:24 2015 UTC,"crap, I just looked it up. I thought Harry and Dexter's mother were romantically involved and Dexter was actually Harry's son."
Dexter,33f8c4,Ammanda13,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:43:01 2015 UTC,They were involved (I assume) but remember the first season where Dex goes to his father's house (the guy died and left it to Dex) and he has Vince do that paternity test for him? Brian and Deb show up to help him move and Deb freaks out when she finds out Dex had the test run.
Dexter,33f8c4,Slaytounge,-3,Wed Apr 22 02:47:15 2015 UTC,why do u think i am 12 if u read this reddit alot of people hate deb why do u hate lyla she was good characther and saved dexter from doakes
Dexter,33dzea,sweetpatata,4,Tue Apr 21 19:24:04 2015 UTC,"I am no architect, but all I can see is that you extended his house with one room!?"
Dexter,33dzea,Huskatta,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:36:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't do much except adding a room and canceling doors. I just wanted to know which one you guys think is the best if it was real."

Dexter,33dzea,mikeramey1,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:22:03 2015 UTC,"I have only ever had one... Never actually been to a place where there were two... But that sounds kind of cool to be honest... I guess it could be problematic at parties though, if one door is unlocked and people keep running in on you!"
Dexter,33dzea,FoxIslander,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:34:09 2015 UTC,I mean two doors can their perks but I think it's more of a hassle if you lived with at least two people. Always have to remind yourself to lock both doors could be exhausting. And with less doors you've got more space for other stuff like furniture.
Dexter,33dzea,Soileau,3,Tue Apr 21 22:17:46 2015 UTC,Needs more treadmills. A lot more.
Dexter,33f2uk,sillibird,8,Wed Apr 22 00:23:55 2015 UTC,"Nice try Louis Greene, but there is already a woodcutting simulator on steam.   But seriously I think people would be interested in it depending on what kind of game it is."
Dexter,33f2uk,BlindStark,0,Wed Apr 22 00:34:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about that yet.  One of the ideas I had was that the game could switch between two 'storylines,' one being you playing as (Logger) Dexter and one as you playing as some other character (Possibly either Masuka, Joey, or Angel.)  I was also thinking of making the opening scene of the game Angel telling everyone about what (they believed) to have happened to Dexter."
Dexter,33f2uk,BlindStark,2,Wed Apr 22 00:49:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would be bad to go back before season 8 also, I think playing as Deb would make more sense than Masuka or something. You could also start it off with a different ending since most didn't like season 8's. It seems like you would want them all to be in Miami if you are playing as the side characters that are still there. It depends on the playstyle of the game though. If you had them together you could weave the story lines together and then you could investigate the crime scenes you just committed. You could find clues to catch bad guys and choose which character to go after them as, the police or Dexter."
Dexter,33f2uk,REMAIN_IN_LIGHT,0,Wed Apr 22 01:00:35 2015 UTC,"Not a bad idea, I could pick up right after the ending of season 7."
Dexter,33f2uk,iamdroppy,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:04:49 2015 UTC,I could see it looking/feeling a lot like the video game of Stephen King's The Dark Half    You should check that out. It's already got a similar vibe and kind of location based narrative.    YouTube sample
Dexter,33f2uk,jzs1986,0,Thu Apr 23 01:57:55 2015 UTC,I pictured the dexter game as more of a top-down 2d game.

Dexter,33bemr,BowChickaWow-Wow,0,Tue Apr 21 07:06:58 2015 UTC,"Well, she did say ""There were two kidnappers, the younger one let me go.""  So obviously she heard an old man talk with Travis."
Dexter,33bemr,Never-asked-for-this,11,Mon May 25 22:30:33 2015 UTC,She thought that there were two because he always talked about his professor I think and how he wanted to let her go but the professor didn't. I'm pretty sure they didn't show both of them in the room with her at all.
Dexter,33bemr,BlindStark,5,Tue Apr 21 06:33:20 2015 UTC,"Like others said, Travis would ""talk to the professor"" and/or possibly talk as the professor in a different voice.  Either way, she thought that there were two guys talking to each other or one was talking and the other remained silent"
Dexter,33bemr,Pointwest418,2,Tue Apr 21 14:46:37 2015 UTC,They could have thought it was a phone call too?

Dexter,33bemr,aaruni96,1 point,Tue Apr 21 13:36:52 2015 UTC,"A valid point, but during season 6 it says that the Professor probably died soon after he was fired from the University of Tallahassee."
Dexter,33bhxu,Weltall548,3,Tue Apr 21 04:09:59 2015 UTC,"I liked the episode or two where Masuka had to be all dressed up and formal until he gets let loose on the visiting detective guy.  ""Science...is one cold hearted bitch with a 14-inch strap on"""
Dexter,33bhxu,Pointwest418,4,Tue Apr 21 14:49:23 2015 UTC,Or when he is explaining auto-erotic asphyxiation after they walk in after Lumen's first kill. Hilarious.
Dexter,33bhxu,raidonward,3,Tue Apr 21 18:55:11 2015 UTC,Masuka was definitely the funniest support character of all time.
Dexter,339mes,cttouch,42,Mon Apr 20 19:19:02 2015 UTC,"It's like Doakes said, he traded in Med school for blood spatter and he was top of his class. If it wasn't for his dark passenger and always wanting to steer the police in the wrong direction for his benefits, Dexter would be the absolute best."
Dexter,339mes,Harleyhounddog,18,Mon Apr 20 19:44:23 2015 UTC,"Would he be the best though?  I always thought his dark passenger is what made him so good.  His lack of desire to socialize and whatnot probably made him really good at focusing and getting things done.  Without one, he might be less inclined to be studious."
Dexter,339mes,PSkip,16,Mon Apr 20 20:27:18 2015 UTC,In the Miami area? Perhaps.  But most forensic teams would have at least one blood spatter analyst of comparable skill.   Dexter was good but while he's out hunting prey the next guy is reading and publishing research papers.
Dexter,339mes,Zykium,26,Mon Apr 20 20:52:41 2015 UTC,"And while the next guy is just reading, Dexter is getting real world blood spatter experience."

Dexter,339mes,pottswanna,7,Tue Apr 21 17:44:22 2015 UTC,"That's a plot hole that annoyed me though. Top in his class for med school but when Masuka is talking about the algae on the rocks in season 2, he has no idea what basic biology is?  He said something about he wished he paid more attention in class."
Dexter,339mes,der1x,12,Tue Apr 21 04:48:45 2015 UTC,Maybe he doesn't use it that much. It had been like 10 years since med school at that point.
Dexter,339mes,dangerRAMEN,6,Tue Apr 21 05:33:44 2015 UTC,Is Med School supposed to teach you a lot about algae?
Dexter,339mes,Pointwest418,1 point,Tue Apr 21 14:48:14 2015 UTC,No but he was implying that he isn't a nerd. When clearly he is.
Dexter,339mes,der1x,8,Wed Apr 22 00:32:51 2015 UTC,"One of the many many plot holes my friend. Although most are seen past season 4. But to add to that, my guess is you wouldn't need to have such a huge emphasis of knowledge on marine bio to be a top grade blood spatter expert."

Then his escape and how he takes different people's identities. Every season it can be a new identity. This time, we would REALLY be rooting for a REAL bad guy. Although we would get more insight on him (sorta like Dexter's monologues). Throw in a potential love interest throughout the entire series and you got yourself a motherfucking hit show. Boom."
Dexter,3377rb,luismpinto,2,Sun Apr 26 10:40:31 2015 UTC,This article has a great perspective on the idea of a Dexter spinoff.  The fact that they admit to never having even discussed killing off Dexter in the final season just goes to show how completely not creative the atmosphere must have been in their final season writers' room. It's like buying a house and never stepping foot in half of it.

Dexter,332t9c,Adrian26795,12,Sat Apr 18 23:55:59 2015 UTC,worst ending ever to such a great show. Just my opinion
Dexter,332t9c,paulbonerville,6,Sun Apr 19 02:47:55 2015 UTC,yeah wasnt too happy with ending but the 8th season as a whole i dodnt mind and dont really understand the hate
Dexter,332t9c,iNachozi,5,Sun Apr 19 02:55:15 2015 UTC,"It was just written sloppily. (ie. An infamous plot device they use to move the plot forward is Harrison falling on the Treadmill, if he didn't fall, Deb wouldn't have become a vegetable and Dex might be living in Argentina with Hannah)"
Dexter,332t9c,dvfsz,5,Sun Apr 19 03:50:16 2015 UTC,things like that are in all tv shows tho
Dexter,332t9c,denvertebows15,5,Sun Apr 19 04:05:07 2015 UTC,"Yea I liked season 8. It was pretty amusing and had some great moments. I understand the hate, but I liked it. I liked the ending. I looked for the deeper meaning (even if there isn't one)."
Dexter,332t9c,Mattyzooks,0,Sun Apr 19 04:40:36 2015 UTC,"I mean its not like it just came out of nowhere though. They set it up at least two or three episodes before. Plus he's a kid and kids do dumb things all the time. I don't know why Hannah didn't call Deb or Dexter to have one of them take him to the hospital, but other than that it checks our for me."
Dexter,332t9c,LeeCarvallo,1 point,Sun Apr 19 04:37:54 2015 UTC,"Is didn't go in the direction desired by a lot of fans, nor did it go in a good direction in its place.  It went the complete opposite way of Breaking Bad's final season.  One is mostly loved, one is mostly disliked.  The fact that a show about a serial killer working in a homicide department did not feature his co-workers discovering and hunting him down is one of the biggest missed opportunities of all time.  They had a slam dunk final season set up in front of them and they opted a completely different path."
Dexter,332t9c,denvertebows15,7,Wed Apr 22 12:34:31 2015 UTC,Yeah. And no resolution to Masukas daughter smoking or impact of the sergeants exam. Couldn't believe it
Dexter,332t9c,BlindStark,2,Sun Apr 19 04:05:34 2015 UTC,mm yeah the sargeants exam got left open... couldnt care less bout the whole pot thing but i see what u mean
Dexter,332t9c,clsuburbs,3,Sun Apr 19 04:09:15 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they resolved the sergeant exam subplot when Angel told Quinn he was giving the sergeant's job to Miller. Masuka's daughter subplot thing just was absolutely pointless though besides the tits.
Dexter,332t9c,LeeCarvallo,3,Sun Apr 19 04:41:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah they did, Jamie got mad at Batista for it and then Quinn still wanted to prove himself. Then Deb shows up and tells Quinn he's a good cop and doesn't need to prove himself to anyone. Then Quinn just breaks up with Jamie because Deb is bae. Overall it was just pointless filler and didn't really have a place in the last season."

Dexter,330cgy,dalibkid,29,Sat Apr 18 07:02:01 2015 UTC,A cover life is very important in Dexter's case.

Dexter,330cgy,ratbastid,28,Sat Apr 18 07:31:30 2015 UTC,Because she's the perfect cover and finding a new girlfriend when you're an emotionless psychopath isn't easy? He also cared for the kids in his own way and didn't want to leave them days after their father had died.
Dexter,330cgy,StonerJack,16,Sat Apr 18 08:12:47 2015 UTC,"she's the perfect cover   This is a Season 1 point that I think got forgotten as Dexter the cold clinical psycho became Dexter the weepy emotional disaster, as the seasons rolled on.  When we meet Rita, she's a mess. She's fresh out of a brutal marriage. She wants companionship, but her ability to reciprocate love is very severely suppressed. So much so that she literally doesn't notice how poorly Dexter is faking it in their relationship. She's the perfect, numbed-out girlfriend-beard for a psycho serial killer hiding in plain sight."
Dexter,330cgy,benalexnewman,9,Sat Apr 18 12:24:32 2015 UTC,A heroin addiction was a way of getting time to himself. At that point in time he had Doakes following him around the clock as well. A heroin addiction and NA meetings sort of killed two birds with one stone and allowed him the time to plan and execute his next kill.
Dexter,330cgy,pretty-little-liar,5,Sat Apr 18 13:06:36 2015 UTC,He actually developed feelings for her. It wasn't an act anymore.
Dexter,330cgy,pottswanna,2,Sat Apr 18 18:06:43 2015 UTC,"Addict also would have explained away any erratic behaviour anyone would have / could have caught on to. What better cover for a serial killer (read: addiction to killing) than another addiction, right?"
Dexter,32xx9m,DeusExHaxorus,11,Fri Apr 17 17:04:51 2015 UTC,"Deb wasn't really thinking straight, she didn't have a plan. She could have put him in handcuffs and brought him to the station and told them what she saw at the church and what she found and they'd definitely take it seriously. Obviously she didn't and it would be terrible if she did since it would bring her down also. She wasn't really thinking or worrying about properly collecting evidence, she was worried about her brother being a serial killer."
Dexter,32xx9m,BlindStark,5,Fri Apr 17 17:24:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah sometimes people don't look at things from the character's perspective and think that they should have reacted more logically, as though the character is also sitting at home watching netflix and not vomiting in a revelation induced psychosis."
Dexter,32xx9m,Slaytounge,9,Sat Apr 18 03:07:00 2015 UTC,Police don't need a chain of custody on evidence to make an arrest. They only need reasonable suspicion of a crime being / having been committed. Chain of custody doesn't enter the equation until charges are brought and a trial is being conducted.
Dexter,32xx9m,Jovian8,3,Fri Apr 17 19:51:14 2015 UTC,"Along with this, she was lawfully in the apartment to find everything and nothing she did was unreasonable. There could have been an easy process to ensure that the trial would go correctly.   And stated before, Deb was highly emotionally during that confrontation and was more concerned with the fact that Dexter was a serial killer."
Dexter,32xx9m,UrSh4d0w,-2,Sat Apr 18 00:20:04 2015 UTC,"Without a warrant? Yeah that is unresonable and can fuck a whole investigation over since evidence that you clearly found, but obtained illegaly, will be restricted for use in a court trial"
Dexter,32xx9m,WFAlex,2,Sat Apr 18 04:14:01 2015 UTC,"How was any of her finding it illegal? She was in the apartment legally and looking through things legally. She can then bring that to a judge and say ""hey, we need a warrant cause I was literally there and saw it."" She hasn't done anything illegal at this point and all she has to do is go through the proper channels.  Or she could just ""call it in"" like a sister would after finding out her brother is a serial killer. Only difference is she would be the cop coming to the house and could then arrest him that way.  There are multiple different ways that this could play out legally if she would choose to pursue it because she has not broken the law in any way at this point. Her presence in the house was legal and her digging through things was legal. So long as she continues to do things legally, like obtain a warrant to actually retrieve the items from the apartment, the arrest and charges would ultimately have gone through."

Dexter,32vs8t,WFAlex,12,Sun Apr 19 06:40:56 2015 UTC,"Rita was pretty much the only well written love interest.   I think this is because Rita began as Dex's disguise but as the characters evolved through the first 4 seasons she became one of the aspects that began to humanise him, the other being his relationship with Deb. When Harrison came along she wasn't needed anymore so they killed her off because Harrison became the secondary aspect to that character development. Just my thoughts really."
Dexter,32vs8t,StonerJack,8,Fri Apr 17 03:19:52 2015 UTC,I hated hated hated the Lundy romance. I liked the lumen one and hoped it'd go somewhere. Am I the only fucked up one that wanted the Dex and Deb thing to pan out?
Dexter,32vs8t,XA36,5,Fri Apr 17 15:13:08 2015 UTC,I didn't really have a problem with all the different romances in the show. I don't think it really detracted from whatever Dexter was doing. It was more of we need something more than just what Dexter is doing so they filled it in with some romances.
Dexter,32vs8t,denvertebows15,4,Fri Apr 17 03:50:46 2015 UTC,"They could've given us more insight into the characters' personalities, instead of them all having sex with each other."
Dexter,32vs8t,FedoraTipper15,4,Fri Apr 17 14:32:02 2015 UTC,"Yep. I watch the show to see Dexter kill people, not to see people fall in love"
Dexter,32vs8t,rogueherrie,3,Sat Apr 18 21:04:19 2015 UTC,"Yes! Any romance involving Deb was pretty frustrating and boring.  She isn't a likable character at all.  Not sure if that's good writing, good acting or just shite.   But yeah, this show all round had a nack for producing pointless relationship plots. Just didn't suit the show."
Dexter,32vs8t,Girafarigging,2,Tue Apr 21 07:26:38 2015 UTC,"I didn't mind Deb dating so much but I was fairly younger so idk about it now. Dexter and Rita was great and while I'm fine with him moving on past her, I hate that they started it like 3 episodes after Rita died. If they would have held out until season 7 and then introduced Hannah as his next love interest and didn't have him randomly sleep with women, I'd like Hannah a lot more."
Dexter,32vs8t,dukefan15,4,Fri Apr 17 11:23:47 2015 UTC,I liked Hannah a lot. She was/is perfect for Dexter.
Dexter,32vs8t,dukefan15,7,Fri Apr 17 13:04:41 2015 UTC,She also fit his code!
Dexter,32vs8t,WFAlex,2,Fri Apr 17 14:15:42 2015 UTC,So did Deb (kinda)
Dexter,32vs8t,sassman93,3,Fri Apr 17 16:13:06 2015 UTC,care to elaborate?
Dexter,32vs8t,jor1ss,1 point,Sun Apr 19 06:35:12 2015 UTC,Hannah was great in season 7 .In season 8 she was not written well
Dexter,32vs8t,Erekt__Butthole,2,Fri Apr 17 18:18:46 2015 UTC,I loved Hannah :p she is one of my favourite characters from Dexter.
Dexter,32vs8t,BlindStark,0,Fri Apr 17 09:50:56 2015 UTC,"I didn't have much of a problem with the Laguerta and Batista storyline and was not the least bit surprised when it happened. Felt natural to me, there had always been tension between them.  I think the romance subplots did wear a little but I think they were all good enough for me in S1-4, even Barbara Gianna and Batista had enough good moments to make me laugh. S1-4 did romance well, perhaps just a little bit too much.   After that I just... wow. Let's have Deb fuck Quinn in her brother's dead wife's house."
Dexter,32vs8t,WFAlex,8,Fri Apr 17 03:23:58 2015 UTC,After that I just... wow. Let's have Deb fuck Quinn in her brother's dead wife's house.   That scene disgusted me
Dexter,32uvc3,dancinglasagna93,6,Thu Apr 16 22:17:04 2015 UTC,"I felt like that somewhat, but I remembered Dexter has never been put in a situation where someone else has his ""need"" except of course for his brother. As someone who supposedly has no feelings, he was extremely disappointed that his brother had to die in order for his sister to live. Not to mention his brother was killing without a code. So to meet someone who also has his urge to kill and that he could relate with like he wanted to so badly with his own brother, I didn't think twice about it."
Dexter,32uvc3,Brettema,3,Thu Apr 16 23:12:00 2015 UTC,But can't you say Dexter is always meeting people who have the same urge as him to kill? Dexter is being careless and exposing himself to Miguel and I don't understand why.
Dexter,32uvc3,Brettema,3,Thu Apr 16 23:25:07 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I didn't explain fully. Yes obviously he is meeting people with the same urge to kill albeit without a code, but in Miguel's case, he is someone Dexter could possibly relate to, like his brother. He still has that longing to be accepted for what he is, and he finds that one person besides his brother. Someone he can relate with and understand. So Dexter tries to teach him the code, so he doesn't end up being a reckless killer like his brother. However I do agree he is exposing himself and shouldn't put any trust out there like that. Unfortunately that longing to be accepted and have someone he can relate with is a new experience for him and one he decides to test out. It's just one of the human things he develops as the series progresses."
Dexter,32uvc3,ColinMichaelRisley,2,Fri Apr 17 00:21:31 2015 UTC,"Because even though he's organized, calculated and careful; he's naive socially. He's excited by the possibility of having a ""friend"" so he takes risks in order to have that relationship."
Dexter,32uvc3,GLaDOs18,3,Fri Apr 17 09:34:35 2015 UTC,Yeah... I felt that way a lot in that season. The Dexter he was in season 1 and 2 would definitely not have allowed Miguel to get so close.
Dexter,32uvc3,elmarko44,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:05:20 2015 UTC,"It's called ""character development"". They're putting the character into situations outside their normal circumstances in order to stimulate growth and change, and to expose things about the character we didn't know.  The end result is called a ""story""."
Dexter,32uvc3,elmarko44,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:46:07 2015 UTC,"But the character's actions still have to be believable in that ""story"". I think season 3 is really shitty writing. And if that's how it goes down in the books then I'd be shocked!"
Dexter,32uvc3,Harleyhounddog,3,Fri Apr 17 15:57:27 2015 UTC,"You can look at it a few different ways...  I think Dexter, who's greatest desire is to connect with ""normal"" people, is trying something different by connecting with a fellow murderer.  It It fits with Dexter's strong desire to connect and it sets up the eventual tragedy that at the end of the season, Dexter is once again alone and isolated.   I think it's bold writing and it explores the character doing something outside his comfort zone - a sign of desperation. That desperation to connect and be like others IS Dexter... it is the core conflict of the story of Dexter."
Dexter,32uvc3,oldskoolpleb,1 point,Fri Apr 17 16:07:35 2015 UTC,Couldn't have said that any fucking better. As Deb would say.   You're exactly right. Character development is done by pushing the characters limits outside his own comfort zone and seeing how he reacts to everything. That's what molds the protagonist entirely. The show would be boring if we kept seeing the same thing over and over.
Dexter,32nzfa,MICHAELSD01,29,Wed Apr 15 08:59:59 2015 UTC,They better start filming again then...
Dexter,32nzfa,unknown_human,19,Wed Apr 15 09:16:07 2015 UTC,"""His only chance for freedom lies with his brother, Brian, who has a dark plan to prove Dexter's innocence.""  Is his brother still alive in the books??"

Dexter,32nzfa,Chalky97,10,Wed Apr 15 14:16:02 2015 UTC,I thought the end of Final Cut had Rita dying?
Dexter,32nzfa,Fratboy37,4,Wed Apr 15 15:07:55 2015 UTC,I haven't read the books (yet) but I just assumed that from the synopsis.
Dexter,32nzfa,oh_no_aliens,2,Wed Apr 15 16:23:02 2015 UTC,It sounds like he's being arrested for her murder.

Dexter,32nzfa,duckwantbread,3,Fri Apr 24 17:30:58 2015 UTC,Pretty much.  See Dexter in the Dark for reference.
Dexter,32nzfa,dexterbateman,15,Fri Apr 24 19:29:10 2015 UTC,"The books have nothing in common with the show after book 1 from what I remember, that's not always a bad thing though, I'm glad the TV show didn't make the Dark Passenger turn out to be the offspring of a God for example."

Dexter,32nzfa,Pointwest418,2,Thu Apr 16 00:04:46 2015 UTC,No similarities at all?
Dexter,32nzfa,beckoning_cat,2,Fri May 8 17:41:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the end of the first book is like season 1 and 7's finales put together, except Brian escapes. The person who dies in S7's finale gets shot by Deb, who finds out about Dexter too"
Dexter,32nzfa,dvfsz,4,Wed Apr 15 21:25:45 2015 UTC,I thought the Final Cut was it. Still reading the series. I have always wondered how the book series ending is going to be compared to the show.
Dexter,32nzfa,JeamBim,3,Wed Apr 15 12:44:24 2015 UTC,Are the books worth reading? I liked the show and have heard good things about the books. Just wondering if I should invest my time in reading them.
Dexter,32nzfa,marimbaspluscats,2,Thu Apr 16 02:29:21 2015 UTC,"Some of them more than others. 1 and 2 were good, 3 is the weird one, 4 I seem to remember being good. Dont remember much the others"
Dexter,32nzfa,GaiusSherlockCaesar,1 point,Thu Apr 16 02:39:16 2015 UTC,"Yes. Some of the books are better than others. The fifth one is my favorite. Book-Dexter is a better character than TV-Dexter in my opinion, and I love the show."
Dexter,32nzfa,SavingFerris,0,Wed May 13 23:05:41 2015 UTC,"1 and 2 are good. All the books after however, are some of the worst books I have ever read. Bad to the point that I am surprised they are still being made."
Dexter,32nzfa,JeamBim,3,Thu Apr 16 03:30:42 2015 UTC,"cool, another book, I fully expected The Final Cut to be the last."
Dexter,32nzfa,Spycrab_Killer,6,Wed Apr 15 10:15:54 2015 UTC,Misleading title but it was never intended to be the final book.
Dexter,32nzfa,TheJessicaProblem,2,Wed Apr 15 11:21:05 2015 UTC,Not like Jeff could of written a worse ending.

Dexter,32nt1s,Erekt__Butthole,3,Wed Apr 15 07:20:36 2015 UTC,8/10. Definitely a huge step up from Crocodile
Dexter,32nt1s,FedoraTipper15,1 point,Wed Apr 15 22:13:54 2015 UTC,"8/10. Great episode. Not to give away too much, but I felt so much more could have been done with the Jeremy Downs story arc. It was clear the writers didn't want to throw themselves out there and risk changing the dynamic of the show, but at the cost of pissing away a potentially amazing storyline."
Dexter,32n53e,FedoraTipper15,9,Wed Apr 15 02:59:09 2015 UTC,"Well, not entirely. Season 1 is an introduction season more than a ''a new serial killer in town'' season.   Season 2 has no big bad. Season 3 has a friend, who turns out to be a big bad. Season 4 has one, ultimate big bad who you should not fuck with.  A new serial killer starts killing in seasons 1, 2, 3 and 4, so yes you're right. But this is a show about a serial killer who works for Miami Metro, and all of these killers fall under the realm of realism.   Deb falls in love in Seasons 1, 2 and 3. All of her romances make sense and have a reason behind them (daddy issues being one of them.)  Brian knew Dexter was a serial killer from the first episode of Season 1, so he knew before we did. Lila and Doakes find out in Season 2. Miguel finds out early Season 3. Trinity finds out late Season 4, but never really knows he is the BHB.  This is no different to Breaking Bad's formula. Cook meth, family drama, make money, someone is killed. Dexter's version of that is kill people, family drama, Miami Metro, someone is killed. A formula isn't a bad thing and I think it changed enough each season to feel fresh enough. Season 1 was more introductory than just a new serial killer. Season 2 had no serial killer. Season 3 was a first true friend. Season 4 was the ultimate villain."
Dexter,32n53e,Erekt__Butthole,6,Wed Apr 15 08:02:24 2015 UTC,"Yup sad but true, and never gets caught.."
Dexter,32n53e,kpdexds,2,Wed Apr 15 03:12:00 2015 UTC,Not even in the last season.
Dexter,32n53e,macabee,5,Wed Apr 15 07:01:22 2015 UTC,"Dexter learns valuable lessons about making friends with suspicious people, taking risks and putting his loved ones in danger and vows to be more careful in future."
Dexter,32n53e,minuteforce,8,Wed Apr 15 04:31:55 2015 UTC,Dexter inevitably fails to be more careful in the future
Dexter,32n53e,PiTheKhoz,7,Wed Apr 15 05:48:52 2015 UTC,Because its different this time.
Dexter,32n53e,alsoye,3,Wed Apr 15 06:36:56 2015 UTC,It really didn't hit me until I saw the Trinity Killer in the Season 4 trailer when I realised that this was gonna be a recurring formula for the rest of the series.
Dexter,32n53e,freeebbo,3,Wed Apr 15 03:36:38 2015 UTC,Someone also gets kidnapped. Every. Single. Season.  Somehow the person kidnapped is never killed by their captor.
Dexter,32n53e,Andrado,2,Wed Apr 15 06:47:05 2015 UTC,1 - Deb  2 - Astor/Cody  3 - Dexter/Anton  4 - Kid in Pajamas  5 - Lumen  6 - Harrison  7 - La Guerta
Dexter,32n53e,Andrado,1 point,Wed Apr 15 07:54:34 2015 UTC,"if they were going to end up killed, they would have just been killed right off the bat. The only reason to keep someone alive is typically so that the hero can save them. See also the long, deliberate wait before killing off important people to give someone a chance to interfere or for the person to make a breakfree move. You can read all about it in ""how to be a villian"" guidebook."
Dexter,32n53e,qwedswerty,2,Wed Apr 15 09:58:59 2015 UTC,"It just got retarded after a while. By the later seasons, there wasn't even any tension when someone got kidnapped, because you know they're going to be fine."
Dexter,32i6vm,XD5133,18,Tue Apr 14 00:11:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think someone else, with Harry's code, would kill Dexter. Dexter and the other guy would be following the same code, killing by the same rules, which means Dexter would not be doing anything wrong. Remember in season 1 (I think season 1) when Dexter broke into a guy's house and killed the guy who was copying the Bay Harbor Butcher? Dexter still killed the guy because the copy cat wasn't following the code. He was killing for the wrong reasons."
Dexter,32i6vm,dancinglasagna93,6,Tue Apr 14 00:50:36 2015 UTC,"Dexter tends to go after bad people that hurt innocent people. I don't think Dexter would have a problem killing a version of himself but I don't think he'd be top priority unless given a reason to be. Dexter also ends up killing relatively innocent people so he fits his own code. Not getting caught is his main concern before killing innocent people. I think Dexter would also let himself live if he got to know himself. He definitely doesn't mind other people going after bad guys like Lumen, Miguel, etc. but he prefers to do it himself to not get caught. I could see it going either way depending on the circumstances."
Dexter,32i6vm,BlindStark,3,Tue Apr 14 02:06:45 2015 UTC,I'm actually watching season 2 episode 3 right now. Revolves around Miguel. SOOO GOOD!XD I don't understand why Dexter is ok with Miguel knowing he killed roodi  Edit: I meant Freedo! hahaa whoops
Dexter,32i6vm,dancinglasagna93,2,Tue Apr 14 03:59:17 2015 UTC,Miguel is in season 3.
Dexter,32i6vm,NOTW_116,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:17:14 2015 UTC,typo. I'm now on ep 4 of season 3.
Dexter,32i6vm,dancinglasagna93,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:53:38 2015 UTC,"Well Dexter didn't really have a choice, Miguel caught Dexter when he walked out but Miguel was there to kill Freebo also. Dexter didn't want to kill an innocent person so he played it off instead. He was definitely worried about it though but knew Miguel wouldn't call the police or anything. Dexter does have a problem with Miguel sharing it with his brother and stuff also. Luckily Dexter ties up all those lose ends in a black trash bag and dumps them into the ocean."
Dexter,32i6vm,BlindStark,5,Tue Apr 14 06:05:51 2015 UTC,"Spoilers much? He just said he was on episode 3. I mean, we all know how every season ends anyways, but still..."
Dexter,32i6vm,falcon4287,2,Tue Apr 14 06:38:09 2015 UTC,Yeah that was my bad I assumed he was rewatching it.
Dexter,32i6vm,BlindStark,3,Tue Apr 14 06:53:16 2015 UTC,:O I haven't seen that part yet! spoilerz :(
Dexter,32i6vm,dancinglasagna93,7,Tue Apr 14 06:25:33 2015 UTC,"Don't be here, man... Come back after you have watched. I do this with all shows I'm watching, just too big risk."
Dexter,32i6vm,qwedswerty,4,Tue Apr 14 10:52:06 2015 UTC,"My bad I assumed you were rewatching it for some reason, I wouldn't recommend coming here until you are done with the show. Maybe threads about the season you are on but I wouldn't recommend it since there are way worse things that can be spoiled for you."
Dexter,32i6vm,BlindStark,-1,Tue Apr 14 06:49:02 2015 UTC,"I am re-watching. I have forgotten everything! But yeah, I sort of remember he is killed"

Dexter,32i6vm,dancinglasagna93,4,Tue Apr 14 16:26:07 2015 UTC,"I think Dexter doesn't meet the standards of his own code and he knows it. Several times in the series he kills innocent people. He justifies it to himself as anyone would, but there is a trail of bodies in his wake that contains people from all walks of life. Some were not killed by him directly and some were, but there's no denying that he brings death with him everywhere, even when he doesn't intend to.    That said, Dexter has not always followed his code to the letter. He easily grows attached to people if he sees himself in them, and very well may let another serial killer like himself go if they are following the same code as him when they meet. If he later finds out that they have killed outside of that code, he would probably forgive them so long as he felt that they were not in danger of doing it again. If Dexter realized that sometimes the other guy got his targets wrong or messed up in a way that got innocent people killed, I think he would be very torn because it would finally open Dexter's eyes to the damage he had done. I think Dexter's proud enough that he would not want another serial killer imitating him, and he would run the other guy out of town but not kill him."
Dexter,32i6vm,falcon4287,2,Tue Apr 14 06:35:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, in the right circumstances he would. Dexter kills innocent people and makes mistakes. When it's yourself doing mistakes like that, it's so easy to say that it isn't a part of the real behaviour, but when it's others doing it, it is much easier to see that it is a part of it. Unintended, but it's still a result of who he is and what he does."
Dexter,32i6vm,qwedswerty,2,Tue Apr 14 10:56:00 2015 UTC,"Well, in Season 1 (spoiler?) he lets that guy with the long hair go who was trying to kill his friend whilst showing him the ""alligator"", because he found that he had been raped in the past, and killed his rapist. So maybe that's a similar sort of thing. But then again he does kill quite a few people who's guilt was... questionable."
Dexter,32i6vm,MrHouse2281,2,Tue Apr 14 16:11:57 2015 UTC,I think he would. Because Dexter is one of a kind and any imitation or lets say copy of him would have to be erased before any more shit comes along
Dexter,32i6vm,Bazmino,1 point,Tue Apr 14 00:26:24 2015 UTC,I mean... he is a serial killer and stuff
Dexter,32idsd,returningvideotapess,4,Tue Apr 14 01:07:56 2015 UTC,Dexter always had his ways of researching people. I don't think it's any more far-fetched than anything else on the show. All he had to do was take a couple of days off work and tell Rita that he was going to a conference or something.
Dexter,32idsd,provoaggie,1 point,Tue Apr 14 01:10:20 2015 UTC,Didn't she pick up her mail when she walked in? Maybe it was after she already got an apartment there and Dexter found it? I'd have to rewatch it though. It was before Doakes memorial though so he did go after her right away.
Dexter,32idsd,BlindStark,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:17:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I got the feeling that he was on the next flight right after hers."
Dexter,32idsd,Harleyhounddog,1 point,Tue Apr 14 03:08:20 2015 UTC,"He's Dexter. At the end of the day you just have to tell yourself this. If he can avoid so much heat from the police, he can track someone down. He does have access to databases that would aid him in vetting people down. Not everything has to be throughly explained. That's what our imagination is for and its what makes TV shows/movies fun.   ITS FUN BRO."
Dexter,32gk2r,Helvetica_,26,Mon Apr 13 16:56:39 2015 UTC,Dexter did the blood test on his biological dad himself. So it's not really possible that Harry was his real dad. Harry adopted him though because he was responsible for what happened to him. When Dexter needed blood when he was a kid Harry had to get his real dad to do it because Harry didn't have the same blood type as Dexter and his biodad. It would have been pretty cool though if Harry was his real dad.
Dexter,32gk2r,BlindStark,13,Mon Apr 13 17:39:26 2015 UTC,It also seems that Harry was sleeping with Dexter's mom after Dexter had been born.
Dexter,32gk2r,alexaxrossiya,3,Mon Apr 13 18:08:59 2015 UTC,Yeah most likely I remember one episode where Dexter listens to the recording of Harry and Luara and Harry was the one that set up the bust that got her killed and they were being lovey dovey 'n shit. I think she whispered something to Harry but I don't remember what exactly happened.
Dexter,32gk2r,BlindStark,9,Mon Apr 13 19:24:57 2015 UTC,"yeah Harry couldn't be Dexter's father, but I still think it's fucked up for Harry to split up two young brothers like that.  Can you imagine if Harry taught Dexter and Brain the code?!"
Dexter,32gk2r,benGYMin,10,Mon Apr 13 17:48:21 2015 UTC,I always thought it would be cool to have them go on kills together. Now imagine if Deb married Brian and she became a serial killer and then Dexter and Hannah raised Harrison to became one also. Just one big happy serial killer family.
Dexter,32gk2r,BlindStark,3,Mon Apr 13 19:35:17 2015 UTC,Spin-off? Please?
Dexter,32gk2r,mostlyidontcare,2,Mon Apr 13 20:03:07 2015 UTC,"I hope so, atleast for Harrison. Massive spoilers ahead. Spoiler: Born in Rita's blood, Dex left him with Hannah. Perfect recipe for a serial killer. //endspoiler Maybe make it like the second season of American Horror Story. Kinda like Bloodyface's child. Harrison tries to find Dexter, while killing people because of his dark passenger. Because he never learned about the code, he killed innocents aswell. Once he catches up with Dex he asks why he left, Dex explains but suddenly puts a needle in his neck. Harrison whispers ""why"" before drifting off. Screen goes black, Harrison ends up on the table, Dex has to kill him, it's what the code tells him. He whispers ""I'm sorry..."" and kills Harrison thus ending the show. Maybe a bit too morbid."
Dexter,32gk2r,Chandelurist,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:54:59 2015 UTC,"I think Dexter hates what he is. If he has the power to prevent Harrison from becoming a serial killer like himself, he would do so."

Dexter,32gk2r,Zygomycosis,0,Tue Apr 14 10:56:46 2015 UTC,"My idea about it is Harry met Laura after she had Dexter with Joe Driscoll, but had a big part in Dexter and Brian's lives before even meeting Laura. And yeah, in the show, Dexter does a DNA test and matches his DNA with that of Joe Driscoll. I'm writing a pretty neat story about it. If you want to read it PM me, because I don't think they like me posting the link to it on here."

Dexter,32i3nb,FedoraTipper15,6,Mon Apr 13 23:45:33 2015 UTC,Do you mean the trap that kills the angel? Definitely one of my favorite kills. I think season 6 had some pretty interesting and memorable kills out of the whole show. Dexter is usually pretty tame for a show about serial killers.
Dexter,32i3nb,BlindStark,-7,Tue Apr 14 03:26:43 2015 UTC,"No it was cringy, you could tell they ripped it off straight from Saw 3 when the female detective dies in that same position"
Dexter,32i3nb,BlindStark,6,Tue Apr 14 03:28:20 2015 UTC,I've never seen Saw 3 but I didn't think it was cringey at all. It was the angel of death so it made sense. I thought it was more interesting than most kills since they actually cause it by triggering the trap and watching her die. I thought the locust part was kind of stupid but not the kill. Having them walk into a room with just a lady tied to some wings wouldn't be as interesting.  I watched the saw video on YouTube and it really isn't the same at all.
Dexter,32i3nb,denvertebows15,1 point,Tue Apr 14 03:34:45 2015 UTC,"They didn't rip off Saw 3. It was a completely different machine in a completely different context. They are similar in appearance I'll give you that, but besides that they are nothing alike."
Dexter,32i3nb,dirtynj,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:48:56 2015 UTC,"That kill was awesome, one of the more memorable ones. And it fit in well with the religion part. Never seen Saw 3."

Dexter,32dece,Jimmith3eo,14,Sun Apr 12 23:35:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's quite sad how they changed him through the series. I mean, you can say there's a couple of nice things in season 5, 6, 7, 8. But they don't even compare to the first two seasons."
Dexter,32dece,Erekt__Butthole,12,Sun Apr 12 22:52:08 2015 UTC,"You've experienced the insane first 2 seasons, a solid 3rd season and a climactic 4th season.  Aaaaaaand now you have to suffer. Enjoy."
Dexter,32dece,pedomuhammed,2,Mon Apr 13 03:40:43 2015 UTC,Season 7 was good
Dexter,32dece,Erekt__Butthole,5,Mon Apr 13 13:57:04 2015 UTC,"Season 7 had Dexter killing a guy in an airport, barely any falling out to Deb finding out who Dexter really is, Hannah McKay who derails the entire season by introducing an arc of ''serial killer falls in love with hot blonde and starts to feel feelings'' and a whole lotta bullshit.  Just because Deb found out and that spawned some good scenes doesn't mean the whole season was good. They killed off the only good antagonist of S5-8 way too early and replaced him with that shitty side plot of the murder-arsonist. Season 7 is just as bad as the other seasons, I mean it pretty much copied Season 2 just much, much worse. (Laguerta/Sirko play Doakes, Hannah plays Lila, BHB investigation returns.) And when you really take a look at things retrospectively, Season 8 has a lot of the same aspects that Season 1 did. All the show did in the end was mimic itself until it died a horrible death. Scott Buck has no idea how to run a show, period."
Dexter,32dece,denvertebows15,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:32:07 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed the entire series (except the ending, but that's an entirely different discussion). I do admit that they really hammer on your suspension of disbelief after the first two seasons. It was still a very enjoyable series that had really good suspense and drama throughout."
Dexter,32dece,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Thu Apr 16 23:54:11 2015 UTC,"I think the suspension of belief is very plausible in the first 4 seasons. The only thing that is ""iffy"" to me was Dexter escaping the Skinner. Not impossible but not that plausible. Breaking Bad had a habit of pushing the bounds of suspension of belief too, so I can forgive it.  But the fucking shit they pull in the last 4 seasons is just unacceptable. Plain and simple."
Dexter,32dece,denvertebows15,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:39:40 2015 UTC,What in the last four seasons are you talking about specifically? I mean the show has a huge looming suspension of disbelief problem with the fact that it takes Deb six full seasons to finally realize something is up with Dexter. Or the fact that in his whole time murdering at least 60 or 70 people he never slipped up and got himself caught. The show is based on a ridiculous premise to begin with.
Dexter,32dece,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Fri Apr 17 03:44:09 2015 UTC,"In the first four seasons, there's no point in which Dexter is a superhero. All of his kills are within reason and are planned, these scenes are written well and logical. He's a very good serial killer.  In S5-8, Dexter gets dumped in the ocean in a ring of fire and... survives. Dexter kills a guy in an airport. Dexter kills an assassin and leaves the body behind cause who cares, he's a superhero not a serial killer. Dexter kills a random guy in a bar and again leaves behind evidence. Dexter crashes his car and is completely fine afterwards. Dexter gets Travis Marshall off a police surveillanced rooftop. The craziest thing Dexter does in S1-4 is probably the way he kills The Skinner. Every single other kill in S1-4 is within the realms of reason and suspension of belief.  Not to mention Dexter fucking a service station worker, stealing her gun and firing it out the window while driving.  Man, fuck seasons 5-8. Thinking about it again really makes me realise why I don't watch past 1-4."
Dexter,32dece,denvertebows15,1 point,Fri Apr 17 04:07:09 2015 UTC,"I found seasons 5-8 pretty entertaining. I do agree that some of the things he does in seasons 5-8 are a little ridiculous, but no more ridiculous than the premise of the show. He works forensics in homicide supposedly the absolute best they have to offer in blood spatter analysis, yet his reports always have errors or he intentionally overlooks things so criminals get off on a technicality. Then all of a sudden they go missing. You're telling me that Lundy who caught all these big name serial killers couldn't figure Dexter out?   And the fact that his friends and sister who are all detectives can't even put two and two together to figure him out. You're telling me out of all those people only Doakes and Laguerta are the ones who get bad vibes from him?"
Dexter,32dece,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Fri Apr 17 04:26:24 2015 UTC,"S1-4 Dexter didn't throw cases that regularly at all. He threw a few cases but not enough to cause suspicion. People make mistakes, and criminals disappear. Nobody would think the blood spatter analyst who couldn't gather enough evidence was the killer.  Now, Dexter is a master blood spatter analyst and Lundy DID pick up on these ''screwups'' and questioned them as odd. ''Sloppy blood work'' is what he called it.   But any suspicion that Lundy had got wiped out the moment the bloodslide box was found in Doakes' car.   Season 4 Lundy was too focused on Trinity to think anything about Dexter. He just thought Dexter was an awkward yet brilliant analyst whom may be some help to him.   What signs does he give his friends that he's a serial killer? They barely know him outside of work. They wouldn't suspect anything. Deb, on the other hand, loves Dexter too much to question anything. And honestly, he really doesn't give her that much to roll with in terms of her getting the idea her own brother kills people. Laguerta was a big fan of Dexter in 1-4, between liking him in Season 1 and feeling a ''friend'' with him as they both shared the secret of Miguel Prado, she never suspected him. Doakes suspected Dexter because Doakes is a killer, and he recognises other killers.  Dexter throwing cases and giving people signs that he's a serial killer but them not giving a shit happens in 5-8, not 1-4. I mean Quinn practically FORGETS that Dexter is a fucking serial killer just because Dexter helped him out of a case that Quinn would have been eventually cleared from anyway."
Dexter,32dece,welshwordman,2,Fri Apr 17 14:28:01 2015 UTC,"It was the first year of Scott Buck being showrunner. He gave us seaosn 6 and 8, which sucked. Season 7 was good. 1/3 doesn't make for a good track record."

Dexter,32dece,cam5478,-4,Mon Apr 13 04:46:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, but it is a username, and if you want to be even more correct in your answer I guess you could say ""there isn't a partytime in the name Garth which should also be capitalized"" but we know you are just being a dick. So, there is no point. Also, the character uses the term ""party on""  not party time, that you believe I am referring to. So, perhaps it isn't that character at all that my username references.   Edit: Seriously my username is after my SWTOR character.  In that game you could get the title Party time and my character's name was Garrth.  It was a nod to the movie, yeah, but not the same character."

I certainly liked it more during a second viewing, though."

Dexter,32eagd,iNachozi,1 point,Mon Apr 13 02:45:01 2015 UTC,"People take away different things from the show and it's clear we watch it for very different reasons. Season 3 is your least favorite? And season 2 is just barely ahead of it? Madness. Season 6 is when I realized things had changed, it's not bad but it wasn't the show I fell in love with. To each their own though."
Dexter,32eagd,Slaytounge,4,Mon Apr 13 02:41:16 2015 UTC,"I didn't include it but I thought season 3 was actually a long way from season 2, there's just nothing to stick in between.   I guess I didn't much care for season 2 because I liked the killer vs. killer that season 1 presented me with, and I thought Lila was really annoying."
Dexter,32b6rv,OgMattBone,19,Sun Apr 12 06:20:05 2015 UTC,"I said the same when it aired. It's most likely just because they wanted a cool send off for Deb. It's much more symbolic to do it that way instead of leaving her body at the hospital. White sheet vs black plastic, dumping her like all his vitcims, etc. It's better than being turned into a bench and it was a badass send off in the storm. Season 8 didn't make much sense at all really and I doubt the writers actually had a good reason, at least her dead body wasn't sent off the boat via treadmill.   If you want to think her death in a nicer way, you could say Dexter buried her at sea so every time he goes out into the water he'll be with Deb instead of alone. He may not be able to go back to Miami to see her grave so that's one way he could still feel close to his sister. She'll always be with him. The water was where he found peace and was one place where he could always clear his mind. He even goes there after Rita's death. The water was special to him and so was Deb, it was a good final resting place because it brought closure to Dexter. I'd also say showing Dexter dump her like his other victims shows he takes responsibility for her death. It fits with him going to live alone because he feels like he hurts everyone around him and doesn't want Harrison and Hannah be his next victims."
Dexter,32b6rv,BlindStark,3,Sun Apr 12 07:32:25 2015 UTC,"Although I like your answer you forget that he basically took her off of life support and stole her body.  There was no way for a proper burial after you perform a medical act without a license and steal a body; even Dexter last season wouldn't have gotten that sloppy and far fetched.  I think your symbolism is beautiful, though."
Dexter,32b6rv,bigbabybeluga,3,Sun Apr 12 10:40:22 2015 UTC,We uhh....we don't ask questions about the finale around here.  What finale? Is usually the answer we like.
Dexter,32b6rv,ClintonHarvey,3,Sun Apr 12 21:14:31 2015 UTC,Well he killed her though. The finales big moment in my opinion is that he feels forced to kill someone he loves in the end. And just like all of the people he kills (few exceptions) he dumps them in the ocean.  You can find one writers explanation here. Make of that what you will.
Dexter,32b6rv,Domowoi,3,Sun Apr 12 23:13:55 2015 UTC,"I still believe he dumped Deb into the ocean to ruin the things he enjoyed about killing.  Dexter corrupted Deb, he ruined her, he got her involved with his other life when he was supposed to protect her. His need to kill got one of the only people he loved, killed.   He can't take another life without being reminded that he took Deb's. He can't dump another body without seeing his sister sinking beneath the waves. He does this because he finally realizes that he can't protect his son, not from this.   A lot of people hated the finale, but I though it was the best they could do with what they had. Showtime specifically told them that Dexter was not going to die in the finale, so the super artistic lethal injection surrounded by his victims could never have happened."
Dexter,32b6rv,relativelyunbiased,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:03:53 2015 UTC,"That's the only way he buries people. Edit: except that one time with Miguel, I can't remember if he was lying about burying someone or if he actually did it. Can anyone let me know?"
Dexter,32b6rv,AllAtOnc3,1 point,Sun Apr 12 21:16:08 2015 UTC,"The way I saw it, is Dexter dumped the bodies of all his victims in the ocean.  Dexter also felt extremely guilty about repeatedly putting Deb's life/career in danger with what he did.  So in effect he feels as if he killed her, thus he did with her what he did with all the other people he killed"
Dexter,32afbg,ImmurtleTurtle,20,Sun Apr 12 01:23:22 2015 UTC,"Oh yea. That shit was crazy. Cried for weeks after that ending. Don't stop watching. Lots of people are gonna tell you to just stop now. The writing quality does drop little by little throughout each season, but it is enjoyable. Unless you yourself stop liking it, keep watching. Form your own opinion."
Dexter,32afbg,dvfsz,7,Sun Apr 12 01:59:21 2015 UTC,Yeah it's easier to look back and say the last 4 seasons were pretty mediocre but we never stopped watching. Can't expect anyone else to do different.
Dexter,32afbg,Slaytounge,3,Sun Apr 12 05:55:07 2015 UTC,Plus S05 and S07 are really not that bad.
Dexter,32afbg,TheToto1000,3,Sun Apr 12 11:22:32 2015 UTC,"Aside from the first few episodes, season 5 is one of my favorites. The barrel girl gang ate fucking CREEPY. Plus Masuka's interpretation of the plastic man crime scene? Pure gold!"
Dexter,32afbg,Starburstnova,2,Sun Apr 12 14:36:21 2015 UTC,Season 7 is one of my favorites tbh
Dexter,32afbg,HeyYouYoureAwesome,1 point,Sun Apr 12 14:11:51 2015 UTC,"I think seasons 5-8 really weren't that bad all things considered. A lot of people complain that Dexter stopped being Dexter or that it became too unrealistic. And while it does become a bit sloppy it's still quite enjoyable to watch. The suspense and drama is still there you just need to be a little more willing to use your suspension of disbelief.    I mean by the end of the show Dexter has killed over about 60 or 70 people. Which if you wanna talk about ""realism"" isn't very realistic no matter how good he is at what he does."
Dexter,32afbg,denvertebows15,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:04:04 2015 UTC,I remember me and GF went to Jack in the Box late at night after watching this. We got our food and ate in the parking lot inside our car. We said not one word to each other for about 20 minutes. The shock and awe lasted a couple days and the show was never the same.

Dexter,32afbg,nicePenguin,1 point,Sun Apr 26 22:42:06 2015 UTC,"Just watched that finale. When Dexter got home after killing Arthur I was relieved. It felt like closure.  I was watching it alone, and I said outloud towards my screen: ""Don't you fucking dare have this end in a cliffhanger....don't you fucking dare.""  Then the shot of the bathroom came on the screen.   I kept saying ""No, they can't fucking do this, he's imaginging it like he's imagining Harry. No this shouldn't have happened.""  But then I just kept saying ""fuck"" and ""no"" over and over...."
Dexter,32afbg,mle70,-4,Mon Apr 27 22:26:02 2015 UTC,Just stop right here. It dramatically falls off now. Found out after that the original show runner left after this season. It's terrible.
Dexter,32afbg,BlindStark,2,Sun Apr 12 15:24:46 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that, it's mostly season 8 that is really bad. Season 7 is pretty awesome with everything that happens, plus season 5 is pretty interesting. Season 6 has some of the most elaborate kills whether you like that season can go both ways for most people though. If you like the characters in Dexter I'd say it's worth watching entirely. Hell some of the insults Mathews uses on Laguerta are worth watching the rest of the show for. I think season 8 mainly caused the other seasons to look bad. They may not be on the level of the first few seasons but they really aren't that bad. Season 8 is but it's the last season and you have to watch the finale, if you don't end up liking it just pretend you never saw it and don't watch it next time you rewatch it. You could also skip episodes you didn't like but I'd definitely recommend watching the show to its entirety the first time. Plenty of enjoyable scenes that I would have missed if I didn't watch the last 4 seasons when they were on. It's all a matter of opinion though and I'd recommend watching them all to decide for themselves what they like and don't like."

Dexter,32afbg,BlindStark,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:57:47 2015 UTC,So you don't like any of the seasons after 4 at all? I don't think they're master pieces or anything but I'd say they are worth watching if you like the show.
Dexter,32afbg,DarkxCrackerx,-1,Fri Apr 17 18:17:10 2015 UTC,Yea that was an amazing season a great climax for an all around decent show people may tell you to stop watching I would advise against it without trying the last four season as although there is a drop in quality its still a decent show
Dexter,32afbg,dpkonofa,-15,Sun Apr 12 02:09:25 2015 UTC,"Totally... I'm glad they ended the show on a cliffhanger, though.  When you have something that brilliant, you don't mess with it.  Can you imagine if they had kept the show going after 4 seasons?  That could've been a disaster..."
Dexter,32afbg,dpkonofa,3,Sun Apr 12 01:55:09 2015 UTC,That was a great ending to a season but under no circumstances is that a good way to end an entire series. Shows how much you know about screenwriting.
Dexter,32afbg,Seiyith,-12,Sun Apr 12 02:45:28 2015 UTC,"1.  I never claimed to know anything about screenwriting.  2.  It was a joke but you obviously have no sense of humor and have a stick wedged squarely up your ass.  3.  If I was being serious, I could write a better series ending than the pile of horseshit they gave us.  The series ending was insulting."
Dexter,32afbg,Pointwest418,7,Sun Apr 12 02:51:27 2015 UTC,"Wow, he doesn't find the same joke that's repeated in almost every thread in this sub funny! What a humorless asshole!"
Dexter,32afbg,dpkonofa,3,Sun Apr 12 03:01:41 2015 UTC,Do it.
Dexter,328lbe,100000nopes,8,Sat Apr 11 15:37:27 2015 UTC,I have personally chosen to believe that what the ending shows us is that Dexter has given up on his code and living a normal life and has completely given over to his dark passenger.  What better life for a serial killer than living in isolation somewhere in the Pacific Northwest.  He's probably killing hookers or something.
Dexter,328lbe,theotheramy1,2,Sun Apr 12 01:02:07 2015 UTC,I like this interpretation.
Dexter,328lbe,Starburstnova,18,Sun Apr 12 15:02:50 2015 UTC,"It's a tragedy.  Dexter is in the worst of all possible hells.    Dexter always wanted to feel like other people feel. Over time, as he slowly stared to develop feelings (for his son, for Hannah, for his sister, guilt for LaGuerta), he loses everything.  Just as soon as he's becoming normal and can connect with other people, he's forced into isolation.  It's a sad ending.  I get a little frustrated with people who hate the ending because they wanted a neat little wrap-up of the story... instead what we got was a tragic ending for our character."
Dexter,328lbe,elmarko44,6,Sat Apr 11 16:25:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with the frustration of people hating the ending. Although I do agree they could have conjured up a better ending for everything, I don't hate it because I still think the ending was okay.    I did read up about the whole meaning behind the isolation part and understood the ending then. Again, still think they could have written something better. Even if it was just leaving that lumberjack scene out."
Dexter,328lbe,gagsy92,5,Sat Apr 11 16:40:14 2015 UTC,"Y'know, I've come to terms with the ending making more sense than I initially gave it credit for. I've heard a lot of good explanations for it.  HOWEVER, I'm still always going to hate it because it was simply the most unsatisfying, poorly executed ending I have ever seen. I knew it was poorly regarded going in, and I had literally no expectations for it and I STILL managed to be disappointment. I just stared at my screen and went ""...that's it?!"" So much was left unanswered, and the hospital shit was so dragged out...then in the last minute, silence...and...LUMBERJACK! Even if they kept that same ending, story-wise, they DEFINITELY could have executed it better."
Dexter,328lbe,Starburstnova,2,Sun Apr 12 15:01:38 2015 UTC,"Yea I feel when Dexter sailed into the storm, he was trying to kill himself. Like he knew the only way he could stop causing people pain is to die. How he survived we don't know, but it is worse than dying to him. Now he has to live knowing he pretty much killed his sister and left his son without father. I liked the ending, but it obviously could've been better."
Dexter,328lbe,dvfsz,1 point,Sat Apr 11 21:26:49 2015 UTC,When Dexter is showing his boat to a potential buyer he mentions a life raft I think? I've assumed that was the writers way of getting out of that plothole...
Dexter,328lbe,blink182_allday,30,Mon Apr 20 07:17:15 2015 UTC,"Well, see, the writers wanted to end the series on a cliffhanger, so that's why they did it that way. It wasn't part of his pattern, and it happened offscreen, but what you're supposed to take from it is that Trinity was able to kill Rita before Dexter got to him. You can tell it was Trinity from the bathtub, even though she was married and it didn't fit his normal pattern."

Dexter,328lbe,denvertebows15,3,Fri Apr 17 00:13:23 2015 UTC,/slowclap
Dexter,328lbe,dpkonofa,2,Sat Apr 11 23:22:17 2015 UTC,"A lot of people who have been close to him have died because of him. His own father, and in the end, even his own sister. Hannah and Harrison represents happiness, but he is filled with guilt and a feeling of responsibility. So he comes to the conclusion that the only way to properly protect them is to sacrifice his own chance at happiness and create a prison for himself. Kind of doing the noble/tragic thing.  Edit: i think a red line through Dexter has been his search for meaning and him becoming more human, so I don't think that it is that out of the blue at all. His sister is family, and he came to love Rita for more than just her being a cover. He loves children and are protective of them. He chooses his sister or his brother because of personal bounds. He refrains from killing Doakes even though it would have been easy to rationalize from the first rule of the code. He tries to befriend and trust Miguel . He lets trinity live to see how he's doing, and end up hating him because of how badly he treats his family and is afraid he might recognize himself in him, etc. Almost every kill Dexter makes, especially the major ones, are part of personal development and gives him a chance to reflect on himself."
Dexter,328lbe,qwedswerty,-3,Sat Apr 11 22:21:08 2015 UTC,"You keep saying ""his own sister/father"" like if you forgot he was adopted."
Dexter,328lbe,AllAtOnc3,1 point,Sat Apr 11 22:56:29 2015 UTC,I think his mindset is more like he cant love or find happiness because he knows he's a monster and he'll always be one. It definitely calls for more. Leaving it like that isn't really a resolution to me.
Dexter,328lbe,Presto-Manifesto,1 point,Sun Apr 12 04:45:23 2015 UTC,"He always convinced himself that he was incapable of emotion, but he wasn't. Throughout the shows devolopment you see him start to genuinely care for people, and his involvement with them resulting in destroying/ending the lives of those close to them. The central theme of the last few seasons is whether Dexter can truly ""have it all"" or if he'll always be a slave to the dark passenger and all the gruesome events that surround it. In the end, when Debra dies, he finally realizes that he can't and avoids destroying anybody else he cares about by faking his death and fleeing to be alone with his dark need."
Dexter,328mii,100000nopes,13,Sat Apr 11 15:49:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with 3 out of 4 of your ideas. I did like the Zach thing, however. I think if the writers had played their cards right (which they didn't), the Zach subplot could have been pretty cool."
Dexter,328mii,nuggetinabuiscuit,2,Sat Apr 11 16:29:34 2015 UTC,Right!
Dexter,328mii,BaconAllDay2,6,Sat Apr 11 23:26:32 2015 UTC,"Zach could have been a super end-game for Dexter. Passing on the Code to the next generation, etc...  This was the point of Masuka's daughter. NSFW but you've seen 'em before.  I was so done with Hannah. Her return signaled the continuing saga of ""Moral Conundrum Dexter"". Screw that guy--let him go be a sad lumberjack somewhere, I guess. I want ""Ethical Monster Dexter"" from seasons 4 and earlier.  The ending. Oy vey the ending."
Dexter,328mii,ratbastid,2,Sat Apr 11 16:35:02 2015 UTC,So we waste several scenes so we can get a good look at some A cups?
Dexter,328mii,Xaluar,3,Sat Apr 11 21:40:03 2015 UTC,Debs character development went completely out the window
Dexter,328mii,Okuu-Trollzy,2,Sat Apr 11 20:16:50 2015 UTC,"Also, when Hannah came back why did she do absolutely nothing to hide her identity? Like change her hair color or something?"
Dexter,328mii,radiumdial,1 point,Sat Apr 18 17:41:05 2015 UTC,"My complaint wasn't so much what but ""why?"". It's as though they tried to cram way too much into a tiny amount of time, giving unsatisfying endings to just about every character, as though they were trying to finish up quickly because the building was on fire. I think that if 8 was paced the same as previous seasons there wouldn't have been such a log jam of plots elements overcrowding the last few episodes."
Dexter,328mii,dvfsz,1 point,Sat Apr 11 16:47:06 2015 UTC,"Yea I didn't like the Zach plot. It seemed kinda forced to me. Hannah I was ok with. I liked what they with her, but it actually could've been better if they didn't include her. I think Masuka's daughter thing was just time they needed to add to each episode to make it a complete episode. It was very unnecessary. I kinda liked the ending. It wasn't as great as it could've been, but I found a bit satisfying. I saw it as Dexter's hell. He wanted to die when Deb died, so he tried by sailing into the storm. We don't know how he survived, but he did, which was worse than dying to Dexter. He now has to live knowing he basically caused his sister's death and left his son."
Dexter,328mii,Girafarigging,1 point,Sat Apr 11 21:49:24 2015 UTC,"I thought Zach was decent. I think Harrison growing on to Hannah was absolutely horrible, as well as her coming back. The Masuka's daughter subplot pissed me off soooooooo much since literately nothing came from it at all and then it wasn't even in the finale. It was just a 100% complete waste of time."
Dexter,328mii,KomatiiteMeBro,1 point,Sun Apr 12 07:04:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, given how smart Dexter was about a number of other things, it is absolutely ludicrous that he would allow Harrison to see Hannah during the whole time that she was in Miami.

Brian Moser was legit. Lila was manipulative and irritating. Miguel Prado was cool, even though we was also manipulative - he wasn't irritating about it. Travis Marshall was so entitled and self-righteous it made me want to kill him myself. Issak Sirko was also legit. Finally, Oliver Saxon was just...nothing.

Dexter,31oypa,Presto-Manifesto,5,Wed Apr 8 00:49:52 2015 UTC,"It's just a dialogue coincidence. They didn't have the ending figured out until they started writing season 6.  Plus, season 4 is written by a completely different writing staff, including the finale."

Dexter,31oypa,lumponmygroin,1 point,Tue Apr 7 02:41:35 2015 UTC,Sure but the writers will use references from previous episodes and writers from before might help out on the scripts (sometimes without credit). Even if they go in and write something unrelated to previous episodes it'll be changed by other writers before production. I feel the lumberjack was probably intentional.
Dexter,31oypa,Erekt__Butthole,2,Sat Apr 25 05:36:58 2015 UTC,"With how blatant the writers were in Season 8, if their ''ending'' was based off what Trinity said, you can be damn sure we would have seen a flashback to that scene, or, god forbid, Dexter saying to Harry ''Trinity told me this would happen. He was right all along.''"

Dexter,316hw0,ostrichzigga,13,Thu Apr 2 12:57:10 2015 UTC,Lmao this is gold
Dexter,316hw0,_Charlie_Sheen_,2,Thu Apr 2 16:55:42 2015 UTC,That Brokeback Mountain theme
Dexter,316hw0,tuskenmarshmallow,2,Fri Apr 3 07:51:24 2015 UTC,haha I've seen this a while ago; I have only one thing to say about it:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaG5SAw1n0c
Dexter,316hw0,xdel,1 point,Fri Apr 3 10:50:19 2015 UTC,Did you find this or make this?
Dexter,316hw0,REMAIN_IN_LIGHT,1 point,Fri Apr 3 05:03:00 2015 UTC,"I just found it, not mine"
Dexter,319bmz,REMAIN_IN_LIGHT,3,Fri Apr 3 00:57:24 2015 UTC,"Well, the first seasons are driven by the fact that Doakes is on Dexters tail. I guess it could be very good but it is already awesome the way it is i think."
Dexter,319bmz,robinenvy,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:18:49 2015 UTC,"I agree. It was just a random thought. It could have kept Doakes around longer, possibly, and then the season 2 arc could have been applied later on in a slightly different way..."
Dexter,319bmz,robinenvy,1 point,Fri Apr 3 14:25:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, your thought would have been the original Breaking Bad. Jesse was supposed to die after 1 Season and Walt wouldve basically been on his own/with a partner for each Season.  I guess it couldve worked out and I also like Doakes so him being around longer wouldve been cool I guess."
Dexter,31556r,Erekt__Butthole,6,Thu Apr 2 01:53:50 2015 UTC,I've read before that the first few seasons were shot on 35mm film and then subsequently it was entirely digital. So this might explain some of the changes.
Dexter,31556r,aeloen,2,Thu Apr 2 09:48:12 2015 UTC,"Don't have anything to add, per say, but the change can certainly be seen in the very first kill scene compared to pretty much every other kill."
Dexter,31556r,Smartjedi,2,Thu Apr 2 04:50:42 2015 UTC,"I didn't really notice a difference in my first run through but when I restarted the series Season One looked like an eyesore. I hated the over-saturation, the white balance was so bad that Deb looked like she was painted white in the pilot."
Dexter,31556r,brody10123,1 point,Thu Apr 2 16:35:31 2015 UTC,"Still playing with the tone of the show maybe? I'm not sure there were any particular reasons, but I'm sure that getting people to like a serial killer was an approach that had to be done tastefully, whereas once he's established in season 1, the kills afterwards are done a bit more casually. I'm not really sure because the dark humor in the show sort of faded into seriousness and inter-character drama instead."
Dexter,31556r,LeeCarvallo,1 point,Thu Apr 2 07:31:01 2015 UTC,"Why was there a decline after season 4? I had watched the show after the series ended, so I wasn't there for much talk."
Dexter,31556r,tynamite,3,Thu Apr 2 10:03:43 2015 UTC,"Original showrunner Clyde Phillips left. It's hard to explain completely but essentially, the showrunner controls everything. If a show changes showrunners, so will the cinematographic style, editing style and colour palette."
Dexter,31556r,tynamite,1 point,Thu Apr 2 10:07:40 2015 UTC,"Oh really? I guess that would explain the shows decline. Difficult to follow someone's else's story like that.   For me, season 4 finale could of easily been a series finale. Interesting stuff."
Dexter,31556r,Its_thursday,1 point,Thu Apr 2 10:30:43 2015 UTC,Season 1 was the only one they filmed in Miami if I remember correctly. Definitely gave the first season a much more unique and truer atmosphere.
Dexter,31556r,higuy5121,1 point,Thu Apr 2 15:42:51 2015 UTC,"I think it has something to do with the fact that season 1 is the only one based on the books. The books have a different vibe than the show because in the books dexter is just a cold blooded socially awkward serial killer, whereas as the show progresses you see many moments where he just acts normal and he actually cares about others."
Dexter,31556r,JeamBim,1 point,Thu Apr 2 16:43:45 2015 UTC,Season one was the only season shot on analogue film. Everything else is digital.
Dexter,312ey5,vertigo1083,12,Wed Apr 1 15:29:23 2015 UTC,I believe this was at the end of season 2.  Sorry if it toes the line of a spoiler.  Its a different take on the intro that I've never seen on the sub.  I figured it was a good dose of actual content.  It's been getting kind of stagnant around here.
Dexter,312ey5,WhyDexter,5,Wed Apr 1 15:45:14 2015 UTC,"Funny, makes me kind of appreciate life more. Thanks Dex!"

Dexter,316468,dvfsz,1 point,Fri Apr 3 00:14:37 2015 UTC,"Same here. It wasn't the best execution of the finale, but it was enjoyable IMO. I liked it on the sense that it gives closure. I say just watch it."
Dexter,316468,BlindStark,2,Sun Apr 5 05:23:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly I enjoyed the last episode it was just what led up to it that was really bad, the ending could have been way better but it's worth watching."
Dexter,316468,Erekt__Butthole,12,Sun Apr 5 19:42:35 2015 UTC,"The last two episodes are insane, especially with Trinity on Dexter's tail and that huge cliffhanger!"

Dexter,316468,JeamBim,3,Thu Apr 9 05:37:37 2015 UTC,The last two episodes are actually the worst of the entire season 8 trainwreck.

Dexter,313u1p,asliceofkiwi,1 point,Wed Apr 1 20:34:30 2015 UTC,I don't... I just stopped by to see others' reaction to the Season 4 Finale
Dexter,313u1p,pottswanna,2,Tue Apr 7 04:04:53 2015 UTC,I literally just finished the last episode of season 4. Some reason Rita's death made me really bummed.
Dexter,313u1p,ImStillBallin,4,Tue Apr 7 08:28:14 2015 UTC,"Ever since the writers decided to take away Rita's personality after the 1/2 way point of season 2, I was hoping she would have disappeared sooner.  Why all that whispered/breathy voice to Dexter, the spray tan, and completely eliminating her sense of humor or normality?"
Dexter,313u1p,SodSolo,2,Thu Apr 2 06:00:36 2015 UTC,"This is true she really did become a boring character after 1/2 half through S2  The dynamic she provided in season 1 was actually compelling and somewhat of value to Dexter, his story and the overall plot..   I wasn't surprised by her character development however... She was always that basic woman that she was depicted in later seasons in a sense... She just seemed to have more depth when she was that broken, damaged Rita in season 1..."
Dexter,313u1p,Adrian26795,2,Wed Apr 1 22:57:12 2015 UTC,That is true. It made the show so far feel more like a sitcom than a drama

Dexter,314gy8,BlindStark,1 point,Sun Apr 5 19:44:52 2015 UTC,"Assuming they try the ""Season 8 was a dream guys!"" and that this isn't a prank."
Dexter,314gy8,vivolleyball15,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:40:47 2015 UTC,Yeah sadly there really isn't a possibility of them bringing the show back at least with the same characters. Maybe Michael C. Hall if they are lucky and let someone good be in charge of the show but I just don't see that even happening.
Dexter,314gy8,BlindStark,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:19:27 2015 UTC,I don't either. I could see like a spin off with Harrison but that probably won't happen either. Or possibly Michael C. Hall starting a new somewhere else.
Dexter,314gy8,vivolleyball15,2,Mon Apr 6 22:43:59 2015 UTC,I'm okay with this. Edit: this better not be an April Fools prank.

Dexter,313b6a,SatyrSauce,2,Wed Apr 1 18:37:43 2015 UTC,"I won't say whether or not Dexter was a good father, as that's something for you to decide as you continue watching the series.  I will say this, however:  He's helping Lumen not only because he cares about her, but partially to maintain his reputation and to prevent her from talking to the police about him. If he got arrested (or worse), then his son wouldn't have a father at all."
Dexter,313b6a,santaman123,2,Wed Apr 1 19:26:57 2015 UTC,I didn't think of it that way. Thanks for pointing that out for me!
Dexter,313b6a,pottswanna,1 point,Wed Apr 1 19:33:52 2015 UTC,My wife and I talk abo this all the time as we watched season after season.  It seems Dexter spends about 15min a week with Harrison!
Dexter,30zx0t,Erekt__Butthole,7,Wed Apr 1 01:08:03 2015 UTC,"This scene is what hooked me into Dexter from the first episode.  ""And yes, I wanna play.  I really, really do."""
Dexter,30zx0t,vertigo1083,7,Wed Apr 1 15:25:04 2015 UTC,Great Episode 10/10.Easily the best pilot episode ever made. Dexter's monologues were fascinating because it delved into the mind of a serial killer.It also introduced Doakes - the next best character of the show besides Dexter. The banter between Dexter and Doakes made the first two seasons of the show a great watch. The introduction of the ice truck killer was well done. Best part of the episode was when Dexter captures Jamie Jaworski and interrogates him on his table which Jaworski shows no regrets for his actions and Dexter duly dispatches of him. There is nothing in the episode that needed to be changed.
Dexter,30zx0t,sassman93,2,Wed Apr 1 05:26:05 2015 UTC,I would argue that the walking dead has the best pilot ever made.
Dexter,30zx0t,Tightanium,0,Wed Apr 1 15:19:10 2015 UTC,Seconded.
Dexter,30zx0t,BlueWinterRoses,2,Thu Apr 23 17:57:39 2015 UTC,"One thing I noticed in Ep. 1 was the difference of the murder. For the first murder we see in the series, it's clear Dexter has a lot of emotion about it. We see him scream and throw his attacker against a wall. This is markedly different from the stone-cold, smooth killer we see in other episodes. I wonder if it was a style they played around with, but decided would be too hard to maintain for the dozens of killings they knew would be seen throughout the course of the show."
Dexter,30zx0t,GenerationSelfie,3,Thu Apr 2 00:33:32 2015 UTC,"I think he's more emotional about that first kill because he likes kids, and he's appauled by the fact someone would do that to them. Remember, he was affected and made what he is when he was a kid, so I think that always plays a part in this character trait of Dexter's."
Dexter,30zx0t,REMAIN_IN_LIGHT,2,Sat Apr 4 05:29:53 2015 UTC,"10/10. I think it probably is one of the best pilots ever (I also think The West Wing has a pretty stellar one; these are my two favorite shows).    I love the opening sequence, of course. It's perfect at introducing us to Dexter and what kind of acts he performs. I think it also introduces his affinity for children, and that's why he's more emotionally involved with this first kill. He even contradicts himself when he gives Deb advice against getting involved - one more part of his duality as a character.    One of my favorite scenes is the Cocaine Murders crime scene where Dexter explains the blood spatter analysis to the uniform cop and us as the audience. It makes his work understandable, but it also shows his sort of arousal or thirst created by that environment. He gets hungry and eats in the next scene as he stalks his prey - a tie-in to the opening sequence.   The episode does what a great pilot does: it builds the world in which these well-introduced characters live and keeps you intrigued for more. Season 1 is still my favorite."
Dexter,30zx0t,REMAIN_IN_LIGHT,1 point,Sat Apr 4 05:27:46 2015 UTC,"I'm brand new to this series so correct me if I'm wrong, but at the end of this episode when dexter looks into the hand mirror of the doll, is it not his reflection? But the reflection of the serial killer?"
Dexter,30zx0t,tittties,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:05:16 2015 UTC,"I saw a different hair color, it looked a lot like the doctor to me."
Dexter,30zx0t,tittties,-12,Tue Apr 14 07:42:29 2015 UTC,i will never understand why this show was as popular as it was.
Dexter,30zx0t,elemental92,8,Tue Apr 14 13:46:41 2015 UTC,"Then why the hell did you come here?  People have different tastes than you do, and if you're going to go somewhere people go to talk about how much they like a show for the purpose of saying that you don't like it, then please leave."
Dexter,30xv1h,rmwdeveloper,40,Tue Mar 31 16:20:17 2015 UTC,"His conversations with harry are a way of demonstrating that Dex keeps harry with him, but it's also a reminder that Harry's ""philosophy"" and his ""rules"" are not a part of Dexter... they are (in Dexter's mind) another person."
Dexter,30xv1h,elmarko44,25,Tue Mar 31 16:50:07 2015 UTC,"No, it seems as if he's just processing things in his head. We see a projection of what is going on in his mind--his thoughts so to speak."
Dexter,30xv1h,welshwordman,9,Tue Mar 31 16:45:09 2015 UTC,"That's how I always figured it. It's just like on oh so many tv shows (like Scrubs when JD would constantly imagine things) and the show would play some crazy scene out like it was really happening but then the character would snap back to reality and stuff would play out for real.  It's just a way to show that Dexter's having these thoughts, as opposed to having Dexter narrate ""I thought, and then Harry would say, and then I would say, and Harry would reply...."""
Dexter,30xv1h,dudemann,6,Tue Mar 31 20:17:07 2015 UTC,"yeah, very similar to the Six Feet Under apparitions."
Dexter,30xv1h,welshwordman,11,Tue Mar 31 20:28:23 2015 UTC,I always saw it more as a him talking to the voices in his head. Not necessarily as a schizo but hearing his father's past monologues to help him with a current situation. (even if the father is talking specifically about the case) he could just be using those past examples to work out present ones.
Dexter,30xv1h,SkaJamas,6,Tue Mar 31 16:37:27 2015 UTC,"I always took it as just a cinematic thing.   Dexter lives pretty much his entire life (at least through the first chunk of the series) by his fathers code. Everything he does, from planning murders to talking to his coworkers, is filtered through ""alright what did Harry say about this/what would Harry have said if he was here?""   The ""talks"" with Harry are just a TV way to show him working through things without it just being 20 minutes of voiceovers with Dexter staring at a wall."
Dexter,30xv1h,Riseagainstyou,6,Tue Mar 31 20:45:51 2015 UTC,I like when Harry argues with Dexter and fights him on what he wants to do. It's like he's having an internal battle with himself.
Dexter,30xv1h,hockeystew,3,Tue Mar 31 21:06:30 2015 UTC,"I've been rewatching the series, lately.   I see Harry as a corporeal mental representation of the Dark Passenger.   After Season 2 and Season 3 had Dexter moving away from Harry after finding some stuff out about him. I really wanted Season 7 and 8 show some more reflection on that subject. Ultimately, I wanted to see Dexter kill himself by stabbing Harry. Ending the Dark Passenger by destroying the man who really created it."
Dexter,30xv1h,Lecter07,2,Wed Apr 1 13:04:03 2015 UTC,"I mostly felt like it was a way to represent moral discussions and teachings of his dad. His dad was also the person who shaped who he is and gave him the rules, so it makes a lot of sense that he'd be with him in spirit.  There is never any confusion about these voices and he is never caught talking to nobody in any way, which strongly suggests that the intention was that Dexter did not think they were real. Seeing how this show is already about Dexter's mental illness, that would be very strange had they not adressed this."
Dexter,30xv1h,qwedswerty,2,Tue Mar 31 17:56:57 2015 UTC,"I always though Harry was supposed to be a manifestation of his Dark Passenger. But then he seemed to be more of the moral side, so I thought he was representative of the Dexter that would have been without the Dark Passenger. Then it all just kind of devolved into Harry existing purely to point out obvious plot developments, and I lost all notion of what his purpose was."
Dexter,30xv1h,PlatonicTroglodyte,1 point,Tue Mar 31 22:05:59 2015 UTC,"I think so. When he's in the church with Rita and the kids while they mourn Paul's death and he sees Brian, the camera pans back and we just see Dexter sitting alone and no one next to him--I think it's like that. I always considered it a neat flaw of his; he seems very level-headed and stoic, but then we see him having conversations with an imaginary person. It was something that made him seem not so perfect."
Dexter,30xv1h,Presto-Manifesto,1 point,Tue Mar 31 17:38:27 2015 UTC,"Yep, a representation of his inside voice imagining what his dad would think of a certain situation,"
Dexter,30xv1h,Bigstar976,1 point,Wed Apr 1 01:32:12 2015 UTC,"People always say it was just a visualization of what was going on in his head, but I swear someone heard him talking to Harry at some point in the show and interrupted him."
Dexter,30xv1h,Kariodude,1 point,Wed Apr 1 02:35:14 2015 UTC,"In season two, at Paul Bennet's funeral, his brother Brian appears next to Dexter similarly to the Harry visions. It actually shows Dexter talking to someone that isn't there in the background when you see Rita and the kids praying at the casket. So yes, he is."
Dexter,30xv1h,Zenith661,-1,Sun Apr 26 22:57:07 2015 UTC,"It was all in your head. Though Harry was mentioned often in the program, Dexter never had a conversation with him."
Dexter,310va5,SummerDeath,2,Wed Apr 1 05:48:43 2015 UTC,"You're so right, I totally forgot about how the ending wasn't figured out until very late on. I was just excited to see a connection and threw all other thoughts aside"

Dexter,30zhcq,MayorWhy,5,Wed Apr 1 00:08:39 2015 UTC,"The first thing I ever learned about Dexter was that Rita died, because I was on a website where people started invading posts to freak out about it because they didn't have a place to talk about the finale yet.  I started watching the series a couple months later, and yes it was worth watching from the beginning.  Knowing that does not spoil the experience of watching the first four seasons."

Dexter,30zhcq,Acedeh,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:08:38 2015 UTC,"I watched the first 4 seasons completely out of order. The only reason I got into the show was because my friend's house didn't have cable at the time and they just had dexter dvd's of seasons 2, 3, and 4 playing all the time. I think I saw a few episodes of season 3 first, liked it, then jumped in at the start of season 2, then watched 3 again, eventually i got around to watching season 1....then watched season 4..5, 6..until the end. short answer is Yes is absolutely still worth watching."

Dexter,30yizx,Jettest,10,Tue Mar 31 19:09:46 2015 UTC,"You're not the only one. I hated that he choose Hannah over everything. And left his son with her? A wanted killer? Like, high profile killer? She never changed her look? And just kill Deb? Really? Nothing resolved? Now he's a lumberjack? Jesus. The ending kinda felt like the writers just spit in the face of all the loyal fans. Still love Dexter, but yeah, the ending was dissapointing in all areas."
Dexter,30yizx,NedenLotus,3,Tue Mar 31 19:31:40 2015 UTC,"He left him with Hannah because he knew he was not a suitable parent and he knew that Hannah would kill anyone that tried to hurt him.  He felt she was best because she knew him - all of him - and accepted him.  She was not a serial killer in the same way that Dexter was - she killed when she was in danger (at least I recollect that - I haven't seen the show since it ended on HBO).  So... that made sense to me.  Although I think the whole Hannah thing was a little cheesy (in the writing) the fact that Dexter could finally find someone who knew him and still loved and accepted him made him feel she'd be a good parent to Harrison. I'm not sure his intention was to abandon them... but once he saw Deb die and blamed it on himself and felt the guilt he knew he wasn't a suitable parent.  (Again, at least that is how I remember it)."
Dexter,30yizx,bigbabybeluga,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:35:48 2015 UTC,But why did he leave Harrison with a serial killer who is on the run and too stupid to even change her appearance to get away... He could have just left him with Batista and Jaime.
Dexter,30yizx,pizzatacos,2,Tue Mar 31 22:16:21 2015 UTC,"Batista and Jamie didn't know the real Dexter.  Presumably - and again, this is a huge assumption and a way too deep conversation to having about a fictional tv character - he wanted to leave his son with someone who knew and understood who he was.  Although Batista is a nice guy he didn't know who Dexter was and may not know how to channel any urges Harrison had in the future that are similar to Dexter.  The last season was poorly written and poorly executed and I agree with that.  NO doubt.  Giving a child to Dexter was probably a pretty stupid idea to begin with however it was all working up to making him more ""normal"".  I do think the the show ended how it was meant to end: with Dexter being alone.  He always said that he was alone in that no one knew him.  And when he began to love he began to, in fact, be more alone (except for, maybe, Hannah who knew him).  It, to me, ended right - just poorly executed."
Dexter,30yizx,bigbabybeluga,1 point,Tue Mar 31 23:49:30 2015 UTC,"But now he's left his kid with someone who is wanted for murder in the country where the kid's half siblings live, so presumably Harrison will grow up without Astor and Cody."
Dexter,30yizx,_sharkattack,1 point,Thu Apr 2 02:10:31 2015 UTC,"That is an awful lot of thought to put into a fictional character on tv.  But, yes, he gave his only son to the only person he knew who knew exactly where he came from and who he felt could best raise him knowing the inheritable characteristics of his proclivities.  And, further, he knew that she would do whatever it took to keep Harrison safe and could manage the proclivities should Harrison develop them.  Besides - Cody and Astor were not half siblings - they were step siblings - there is no blood relationship between Cody and Astor and Harrison."
Dexter,30yizx,bigbabybeluga,1 point,Thu Apr 2 21:30:24 2015 UTC,Did I miss something? Was Rita not the biological mother of all three kids?
Dexter,30yizx,_sharkattack,1 point,Thu Apr 2 21:35:24 2015 UTC,Rita was the biological mother of all 3. Cody and Astor were from her first abusive husband.  Deb introduced Dexter and Rita to them after multiple domestic violence calls to Rita's house.  Harrison was Dexter's only biological child and Rita's third child. There is no biological connection.
Dexter,30yizx,bigbabybeluga,2,Thu Apr 2 21:38:52 2015 UTC,"there is no blood relationship between Cody and Astor and Harrison  Rita was the biological mother of all 3   If she is the bio mom of all three, then there is a blood relationship and they are half-siblings, not step.  Anyway, obviously the last season was terribly written, but it just bothered me that because Dexter felt some kind of connection to Hannah that Harrison essentially is denied a relationship with his half-siblings (presuming Hannah doesn't want to risk going to the US and getting caught). I finally got around to watching the last season and finished yesterday, still bitter about it :)"
Dexter,30yizx,_sharkattack,1 point,Thu Apr 2 21:53:33 2015 UTC,"Wait - that's right. DUH.  I have no idea why I got that so mixed up.  I guess my hatred for Rita got the best of me.  Once Rita died the relationship with Cody and Astor really fell to the wayside... I cannot imagine if the show were to play out that they would have maintained much relationship to them at all.  But, thank you for correcting me - Rita was the mother of all three. I feel like an idiot."
Dexter,30yizx,bigbabybeluga,1 point,Thu Apr 2 21:59:18 2015 UTC,Step relationship to Dexter though. It bothers me more than it should that he was partially responsible for Trinity killing their mother but he didn't feel any responsibility for making sure they had a good future.
Dexter,30yizx,_sharkattack,1 point,Thu Apr 2 22:15:41 2015 UTC,Well that is where you and I disagree.  I think he feels he gave Harrison the best future he knew how.  I think he felt that Cody and Astor and the grandparents were not equip to help Harrison in the same way that Hannah could.  Biology does not necessarily mean the best life...
Dexter,30yizx,bigbabybeluga,2,Fri Apr 3 00:10:30 2015 UTC,"Every season, Dexter built hope that he could have a relationship with someone.  Every season, that hope was dashed.  At the end, he gave up and figured that he couldn't be in a relationship with anyone without them getting hurt.  The punishment for his ""sins"" is living that life in solitude."
Dexter,30yizx,vedderer,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:44:18 2015 UTC,"Yea it was not all it could've been. I like to think of it as a less than stellar season, but not the end, ya know? Like,there IS a season 9 and 10 etc, we just never saw them. He isn't dead so it doesn't have to be the 'ending' - he just made a temporary decision to be a fucking weird idiot and will come back to do some other shit, more in line with the earlier seasons. Minus Deb :'( of course"
Dexter,30yizx,Brasil_Nuts,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:39:34 2015 UTC,"When it really comes down to it he ruin Debs life. Even though she put herself in slot of bad situations Dexter was the only one she really had and her finding out destroyed her. Him killing her is a mercy kill. Deb had the worst life of anyone on that show. The ending is perfect. Think about it his first memory, the one that "" made him the way he is"" was his mother being killed by a chain saw, and what does he do he puts himself in his own personal hell he becomes a lumberjack. Surrounded by chainsaws all day. He relies finally that he is a bad person. He used to think he couldn't love or feel but he can. And he realises he is not a fit father for Harrison. Yeah Hanna has killed people, she's selfish to the point of doing whatever it takes but I don't think she would ever kill Harrison. I have watched the series 8 times and I am convinced this sums up the finale. It didn't have to make perfect sense. I mean let's face it as likable of a guy as Dexter is he still kills people and cuts their body's in to neat little pieces;)"
Dexter,30yizx,GandalfTheWhiteBear,1 point,Wed Apr 1 05:19:49 2015 UTC,"The original plan wasn't for Dexter to leave Harrison with Hannah, it was for Dexter to be with them in Argentina as a family.  With the hurricane, serial killer hunting him, and the authorities hunting him, Dexter didn't really have a chance to come up with a good plan B before he finally just decided to send them on ahead of him.   With everything that happened to Deb at the end, Dexter firmly believed that anything he loved he would eventually end up destroying.   He doesn't attempt to track down Harrison and Hannah because he believes it will lead to horrible things.   Judging by what happens to everyone he's ever loved in the series,  I think he may be right.  As an added bonus, how would he even track them down now anyway?   He no longer has his connections to the police force to find information and he's not going to be leaving the country very easily either."

Dexter,30qa36,MICHAELSD01,17,Sun Mar 29 19:55:27 2015 UTC,"It kinda has a natural premise built into a decade long hiatus. Dexter comes across news reports that mention Harrison's name alongside a homicide. Dexter tracks him down and, of course, Harrison has the same dark passenger. Dexter feels the need to mentor him, like Harry did. I would watch the hell out of that show. It could be dark, funny, and sweet."
Dexter,30qa36,KurtToons,3,Sun Mar 29 20:22:51 2015 UTC,Dexter comes across news reports that mention Harrison's name alongside a homicide.   Wow that would be an interesting way to start it.
Dexter,30qa36,ChrisVolkoff,6,Mon Mar 30 02:15:11 2015 UTC,"While I agree that the show ended in a place that makes a hiatus make a lot of sense (what has Dex been up to? how long could he really remain in exile?), I'm not sure that a show about Harrison having the same impulses won't go down a ridiculous path. I'd rather have a show where Dexter tries to reconcile with Hannah for Harrison's sake thus prompting an international search for him after he was found out to have been a serial killer, with his faking his death only making him seem more suspicious. I feel like Harrison becoming a killer would be on a comic book-level of unrealism, unless Hannah doesn't protect him well enough from her dark side and he had become exposed to that."
Dexter,30qa36,KurtToons,8,Sun Mar 29 20:29:32 2015 UTC,"I am one of the people that never really liked Hannah as a character, so in my vision of the reboot, she wouldn't be around. Actually, she'd probably be the one that Harrison killed. I think that a teenage Harrison, played by a charismatic young actor would be interesting to watch, as he deals with his impulses and high school. And Dexter would be grudgingly brought back into the world of murder, only to protect his son, but it awakens something in him too. I think it sounds great. You know what? I'm gonna go make it. Be right back..."

Maybe Hannah has died or been caught (hopefully, what a terrible character) causing Harrison to look through her things and find a few clues that lead Dex's way.  Then we can get right back to the essential question of the original 4 seasons... ""Can Dexter be Human and a Monster? Parent and Killer?""

Dexter,3072sr,LaserRed,19,Wed Mar 25 00:17:24 2015 UTC,"As an alternative to having Dexter gradually grow to be a morally good character and quit his life of murdering, I would rather have the writers make Dexter go off the deep end after Season 4, and begin breaking all of Harry's rules until he is the ultimate ruthless psychopath. I think that would be more entertaining than the whole ""redemption"" thing."

Dexter,3072sr,AnorexicManatee,7,Wed Mar 25 03:33:10 2015 UTC,"Also... It was just weird. The therapist emphasizes that they are not blood-related as if that negates their familial relationship. I found that entire arc to be far fetched and pointless, especially for a character like Deb."

If blood related siblings meet later in life, the opposite is true from what I've read."
Dexter,3072sr,Slaytounge,7,Fri Mar 27 04:01:02 2015 UTC,"I would have liked to see Dexter either actually find redemption, not this weird purgatory he seems to be in, or have gone completely insane, abandoning the code and ending up being dragged down thrashing like a rabid dog.  Would have been interesting to see him grow more and more unstable because even S1 Dexter and S4 Dexter are quite different, he had more and more outbursts and became more reckless because of his need to kill. I wish they would have followed through with that a little more. And I mean reckless, not straight up stupid like stalking someone behind a giant window in the light of day."
Dexter,3072sr,DCBizzle,4,Wed Mar 25 02:37:51 2015 UTC,Deb didn't die and in the finale when he rode off into the storm that was it. He dies in the storm.
Dexter,3072sr,ratbastid,3,Wed Mar 25 05:20:06 2015 UTC,"I think it was an enormous cheat that he didn't get the chair in the series finale. He knew from Episode 1 that he was headed there. Not to go there because someone from the network ""didn't want him to die"".... Grow up and tell a fucking story already.  An ethical monster is still a monster. Coming to terms with what he is, in the last episode or two on death row. Deb confronting who her brother is, having to take him down... Could have been SO tense and interesting and rich.   Instead we rob a corpse from a hospital and become a sad lumberjack. Pathetic."
Dexter,3072sr,Drabbeynormalblues,2,Thu Mar 26 02:14:57 2015 UTC,"I thought they had a great concept for the ending, but I thought their execution of the ending was horrible. I would either keep the ending but execute it in a way that was more believable or show Dexter getting caught and having to answer for his crimes.    I would make Debra grow and change as a character more. She gains insight into her daddy issues and it would have been nice to see her get some therapy after she realizes the extent to which she relies on Dexter for emotional support. It would have made a better ending for her to be happy, thriving, and moving on in life and then die at the end.   Dexter did kill a few innocent people along the way like the guy at the gas station after Rita's death. He was in such a rush to get to the funeral that it would have been kinda nice to see him sweat a little and have to explain why one of his fingerprints was found at the crime scene or any number of his other innocent victims."
Dexter,3072sr,John_Foreskin,2,Wed Mar 25 04:38:23 2015 UTC,"Agree with all of that. Showtime fucked itself by making Scott Buck the showrunner.  It fucked itself again when they told the writers Dex couldn't die. As bad of an idea that was, it was the execution of season 8 that was the worst. 7 got our hopes hope. Best season post-Clyde Phillips. Only to take a piss on everything. They turned it into a poorly executioned Soap Opera.   8 should have been Batista (and maybe Quinn) putting it together, followed by a nation-wide manhunt with the FBI. Imagine that for a couple seconds, and then compare that to the frat-boy bile after a rager we were presented with. Fucking tragedy.   Anyone who wants a decent ending to the show should take a look at Clyde Phillips' AMA."

Dexter,3072sr,craigm10,2,Sat Mar 28 16:49:46 2015 UTC,I would change alot of thing after season 4 but I think an easy change would be in season five for Quinn to actually tell and prove to Debra that Dexter is a killer. This easily sets up season six as the last season as its puts Dexter against Debra.

Dexter,3072sr,John_Foreskin,3,Wed Mar 25 01:44:55 2015 UTC,"A soap opera level (at best) ending? Who could think that was bad? Never mind the plot holes and terrible writing. Masuka's daughter? No, fuck that. Dexter's prodigy? No, fuck that. Batista looking through Laguerta's files? No, fuck that. Quinn losing Sargent only for that character to disappear? No, fuck that. Elway's character have a point? No, fuck that. Dex leaving his only son with a psychopathic serial killer? No, fuck that. No one ever learning Dexter's true nature in the Miami PD. No, fuck that.   But, besides those points. It was actually still terrible. You have a point."

I think it would have been cool to see those dueling personalities (Angel vs. Devil) last longer than just one episode. Perhaps it could have come after the Season 4 twist.   I don't know....perhaps make Dexter ""The Big Bad"" for the finale season if you wanted to go in a completely different direction."

Dexter,303ngf,kill_dano,5,Tue Mar 24 13:50:09 2015 UTC,I don't think most people wanted him to win. We wanted season 8 to be about catching him. Instead it was about catching the blonde.
Dexter,303ngf,John_Foreskin,2,Tue Mar 24 18:09:25 2015 UTC,"Man, Scott Buck and his defenders always say something like, "" We didn't want him to have a happy ending. So that's how it had to end."" There are a million fucking things that could have happened that would have been better. Batista and the FBI chasing Dex down and catching him would have been incredible. For all of the Miami homicide department to know they have been working with and unintentionally helping Dex kill all those people. Doakes would have been cleared and his family could have peace.   But beyond all of that, the writing was just lazy and uninspired. It became a Soap about a serial killer by the end. They didn't even take their shitty ending and execute it well.  Fuck Scott Buck. I'm still salty about the murder of this once great show."

Dexter,300242,Presto-Manifesto,4,Mon Mar 23 11:22:26 2015 UTC,"I've linked this on a couple of threads already, but I was hoping to get some feedback on it and figured this was the best way to do it.  Basically, this will be the transformation of Dexter into a killer through the perspective of his father. I get that the general idea about fan fiction is a pretty negative one. Personally, I don’t like reading fan fiction, and I haven’t written anything in my life that could be considered fan fiction since I was 10 about Star Wars, but I was just left with so many unanswered questions after the show’s ending that I had to get my ideas out somehow. Instead of re-writing the end of the series, or going on about what I wish happens afterwards, I went with a prequel story that I hoped would give more meaning to the way the show actually ended. Aside from the sort of obviously whimsical and maybe even silly details and events I’ve come up with for the characters involved in Dexter’s upbringing, I think the actual core of the plot could very well explain the way the show ended and you might feel a little less affronted by it. My hope is that it drives home the tragedy of Dexter’s story through showing what sort of a relationship Harry had with Matthews and what really happened between them, and all the other people in Dexter’s early life. Obviously, there will be things I can’t fix or place meaning to (mostly pertaining to the shitiness of season 8) but I’ll try. I do try to be as accurate to the show as possible, so I don’t retcon anything or change anything that’s already established.  So I’ve posted this not only to get criticism as far as grammar, diction, clarity, etc. because I want it to be at least halfway understandable as a story by itself, but also to get opinions of the Dexter fanbase to see if I haven’t left out any crucial details (so far) to know that I’m not completely off base with this stuff. For example, one thing I noticed is that I spelled Hector Estrada’s name as Astrada for eight chapters, so there might be more things like that. Also, if so far you like the story enough, throw some ideas at me about what you might want to see or what parts of the show needed more backstory so I can make sure to include it later on. Thanks."
Dexter,300242,Bo-mance,1 point,Mon Mar 23 11:28:46 2015 UTC,"I'm only 3 chapters in so I won't critisice anything yet, can't say I found anything to say yet either to be honest. I'd just like to say that I'm a HUGE Dexter-fan and I'm really enjoying this so far. Anything that enriches the story about Dexter will have me intrigued.  You're totally right about all the unanswered question this show leaves you with, not only about Dexter storywise in itself but about Harry! I like what you've done with him as a character so far and also the hinting towards his involvement with other, in the real show, 'not-yet-fully-explored-characters', such as Mathews, Dexter's 'bio-dad' etc. Can't wait to keep reading!"
Dexter,300242,John_Foreskin,3,Mon Mar 23 18:58:41 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks. It's really meant for the more devoted Dexter fan because it gives depth to some characters that weren't too deeply explored in the show who were crucial to the story, and I think you'd have to really know Dexter to sympathize with those characters. But at the same time, I give them new stories and (without spoiling anything) new environments; new kinds of predicaments that hopefully make these characters interesting while also staying true canonically to the show. I'm glad you like it though! Thanks for checking it out."
Dexter,2zs1wr,Mbachu,65,Sat Mar 21 04:46:27 2015 UTC,"It would have been so fucking cool. By the end of the series, Dexter would be classified as the deadliest serial killer in the history of the United States. According to the Dexter Wiki he has 138 victims (deadliest by a lot. The current person with the most confirmed kills is Gary Ridgeway with 39). There are so many awesome things that could have happened. It's a fucking travesty that the show ended the way it did."
Dexter,2zs1wr,iAmMitten1,28,Sat Mar 21 05:06:31 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. And I hate that excuse about how ""Showtime wouldn't let the writers kill Dexter."" They still could've made the season about him being discovered and kept him alive. One of the reasons why the Bay Harbour Butcher season was so thrilling was because he was so damn close to being caught. I was totally expecting the last season to be about that and to this day I'm just astounded at the direction they decided to go in."
Dexter,2zs1wr,bbb19,6,Sat Mar 21 07:52:43 2015 UTC,Yep! They could have picked it right up from where Maria left off. The evidence is right there!!!
Dexter,2zs1wr,mikeramey1,6,Sat Mar 21 22:41:35 2015 UTC,"I would have to agree. I feel like they really play it safe in the last few seasons, resting primarily on in the initial premise. Deb finding out is an exception, but really the only major one I see. Miami metro still loves him. They didn't want to drastically change the landscape of the narrative, which I think is a discredit to what the show could have been."
Dexter,2zs1wr,dopaminutia,2,Sat Mar 21 18:49:57 2015 UTC,"All Dexter ever wanted was to keep his secret from his son. Why would you think it'll be a good idea to have everyone know who he was? Dexter never wanted his son to find out the ""monster"" he was."
Dexter,2zs1wr,AllAtOnc3,16,Fri Mar 27 09:18:07 2015 UTC,"Showrunner and showruiner, Scott Buck claimed it would have been boring because they'd been down that path before....I remember reading that in an interview, will need to do some digging to find it."

Dexter,2zs1wr,John_Foreskin,12,Wed Mar 25 01:04:23 2015 UTC,"I felt like that was what they were teasing and working towards. Very disappointed that it didn't happen. IMO it was the only right way to give the series the end it deserves, almost what it has been working towards the whole time.   But, if I'm being honest (and a bit cynical), they probably just wanted to keep their options open for a spin-off."
Dexter,2zs1wr,0dmeth,6,Wed Mar 25 08:28:13 2015 UTC,"I still don't get it though. They didn't have to kill him off, they could have thrown him in prison. The spinoff could be before his hearing, after, 20 years after, they could've done anything with it. Shit, they could've even had him escape from prison if they wanted to. Get him off on a technicality, kill him and continue with his now fucked up son, have Hannah continue for him, just ANYTHING."

I just don't get it. That's what the whole show was about, him trying to hide that part of himself. The only thing that makes sense is for the end to be about how he got caught. It's been forever but I still get mad when I think about it."
Dexter,2zs1wr,xScreamo,8,Tue Mar 24 20:59:30 2015 UTC,Because they have shitty writers
Dexter,2zs1wr,Kariodude,3,Sat Mar 21 15:09:13 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think that would've been a great idea for the final season. My issue with it though is that it seems too similar to the way breaking had ended and the two shows are very opposite of each other. BB is about Walter White losing his humanity while Dexter is (at least in the later seasons) about developing his humanity. Since at the time the two shows were basically competing which each other, I don't think Dexters plot could have taken that route."

Despite that, it could have ended 1000 ways differently. Don't pretend for a second that , ""oh I'm now a lumberjack and I lost my kid and my pyscho serial killer gf"" is the only way. Also, let's write that shitty ending as worse as we possibly can. Let's not give Scott Buck a break here. Dexter post-Clyde Phillips was a disaster. Soap opera serial killer at best.

Your definitions reek of misogyny, and lack common sense."
Dexter,2zs1wr,tonguegrinder,0,Tue Mar 24 17:18:33 2015 UTC,"It came off as girly, lame, frilly, and very much like a corny soap opera rather than what we should have gotten, or what would have made the most sense as far story-telling goes. I usually don't generalize, but within the last couple of years I've learned that history repeats itself for a reason. Sometimes you can't ignore what's plainly laid out in front of you, no matter how impartial you think you are. If you'd like a more objective standpoint, do the math and look at the number of male writers compared to female writers near the last season. Look, some of the best stuff I've ever read was written by women, but when you take a look at the writing staff at the beginning of the show and what we were left with towards the end--I don't know, it's nothing short of self explanatory. Obviously, a number of things could have and did contribute to why the later seasons fell off, but come on. Whatever, maybe some people like that soap opera bullshit.

Dexter,2zt2xr,dazzy007,9,Sat Mar 21 14:30:06 2015 UTC,"The whole 5th season is about Dexter trying to process her death. Watch the rest and decide if you like the other seasons FOR YOURSELF. A lot of people including me like a lot of what happens in the next 4 seasons. It's not perfect, but it's worth watching."
Dexter,2zt2xr,geogabs,6,Sat Mar 21 20:06:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was completely shocked. You should continue watching though. I personally thought season 5 was mediocre,  but I really loved season 6 and 7. The whole ""stop watching after season 4"" is a bit innacurate. I thought season 6+7 were alot better than season 3. Season 8 was as bad as people say, but I had to finish the story."
Dexter,2zt2xr,Tugga,2,Sun Mar 22 05:40:13 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you. I hate what happened to Rita and Dexter's apathy toward it all.

So many mistakes made in dexter. I dont know what the ending is but it should have been season 2 only later in dexters life with rita still around. Dokes should have stayed also."
Dexter,2zt2xr,GLaDOs18,0,Sat Mar 21 21:06:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know about Doakes, since I actually hate him a bit but I think they should have kept him around to keep blowing the whistle on Dexter and then finally exposed him as a serial killer."
Dexter,2zt2xr,dvfsz,1 point,Sun Mar 22 00:43:57 2015 UTC,"Yea seasons 1-4 are amazing. I liked the rest, but they started to drop in quality. Mostly season 8. The other season are pretty good at keeping the story interesting enough. I say watch the whole series just to get so what if closure, but if you don't like it, stopping would be ok.  Edit: I did like season 8. Sure it dropped in quality, but I liked the way it ended."
Dexter,2zt2xr,denvertebows15,1 point,Sat Mar 21 14:37:40 2015 UTC,"Watch the entire series and decide for yourself if you enjoy it or not. The circlejerk around here is that after season 4 the show becomes unwatchable. Don't buy that hype. I found seasons 5-8 to be quite enjoyable. Of course the suspension of disbelief is stretched pretty thin at points, but that happens with any long running show.   I was left at the edge of my seat for the entire series and the only time I wanted to stop watching was after season 4 because well you know what happens and I was really mad about it."
Dexter,2zt2xr,Domowoi,0,Sat Mar 21 15:01:28 2015 UTC,"If you have it on some service where you can watch it for free, I would definitly recommend that you watch the rest.  After you can always make up your own ending."

Not quite as intensely as, like, Will Graham or something. I think it's because I write and I like to see what makes people tick, and then I put those traits into my characters. Similar to Dexter, I guess I act different than how I really feel; or more accurately, I make myself put up with situations I don't want to necessarily be in."

Dexter,2zg6ja,JohnyRingo,5,Wed Mar 18 08:48:12 2015 UTC,"I don't believe so. Up to that point in the season you are watching, pretty much everything in dexter's past has been brought up. There isn't much more needed for the story going forward without giving away a couple spoilers. Also Harry appearing off and on to console Dexter kinda makes flashbacks not needed. If you notice he will bring up stories from his childhood so no need for as many flashbacks. One last thing to consider, the first season is based off the first dexter novel (except obviously for the ending) ""Darkly Dreaming Dexter"". From season 2 on out its all Showtime. Hope this helps."
Dexter,2zg6ja,Brettema,4,Wed Mar 18 09:25:09 2015 UTC,That actually helped a lot. I've been stuck on this show for a few days now and I'm trying to pay attention to everything. I didn't wanna miss something little. Thank you.
Dexter,2zg6ja,luxchroma,7,Wed Mar 18 09:30:46 2015 UTC,"I was meticulous with paying attention to everything as well. In the later seasons you may start to notice that the writers would have an idea about something, implement it for a few episodes, then a few episodes later it's gone. Nothing relevant to the story, just something that bugs people like you and i"
Dexter,2zg6ja,xxProjectJxx,2,Wed Mar 18 10:28:45 2015 UTC,I can already tell that's gonna irritate me. Thanks for the heads up.
Dexter,2zg6ja,zfinne,2,Wed Mar 18 10:41:54 2015 UTC,"I've always kind of considered each season as designed around a thematic through-line.  Each focusing on an aspect of character which Dexter lacks or otherwise struggles with.  Season 1 is his past, Season 2 is love, Season 3 is friendship, Season 4 family.  The themes each season become a little less clean in the second half of the series, with the exception of Season 6's theme of religion.  Anyway, the reason there's less flashback is because his past is no longer as big of a focus."
Dexter,2zg6ja,Erekt__Butthole,2,Wed Apr 22 17:19:29 2015 UTC,"I've always considered Season's 1 & 2 one-in-the-same. In a good way. That's when the show was at its peak. Afterwards, the show lost its touch. The writing, cinematography, attention to detail all take a pretty noticeable spike downwards. I know it's an unpopular opinion, but I feel like it's just a different show from S3 onwards.   S2 did a great job with flashbacks. There wasn't as much ground to cover, but the flashbacks are still stellar. If this bothers you, you're really going to hate the rest of the show. The flashbacks pretty much stop entirely, and Harry is the devil on Dexter's shoulder, commonly referred to as ""Ghost Harry."" Complete with bright lighting and watered-down, spoon-fed dialogue.   The continuity is pretty awful after Season 2, also.   The show is split in fours for me:  S1-S2: Amazing.  S3-S4: Good, but not up to par. Season's three main arch is entertaining, and Jimmy Smits is actually a lot better than most Dexter fans give him credit for, but the subplots start to show cracks around the shows main focus. Filler. Season 4 is vastly overrated, and is only good because of John Lithgow's acting. The show's subplots take an even further nosedive from this point forward.   S5: This is an interesting season. It's bad, kind of good, mediocre, and terrible all at the same time.   S6-S8: This is where the writers pretty much just say ""fuck it."" Season 6 is hilariously horrendous, and Season 7 isn't far behind. Dex fans like to say Season 7 is a return to form, but, well... wait until you see how many problems it has. If you even get this far. And of course Season 8 is where the writers throw darts at a rotating story-board. It's easily the shows worst season and pretty disrespectful to the fans.   Let's just say the show could have easily been two seasons. Season 2 ends on a satisfactory note. This is how I recommend the show to my friends."
Dexter,2zg6ja,John_Foreskin,2,Wed Mar 18 18:24:43 2015 UTC,"S1 and S2 had filler subplots too, like Deb and her boyfriend, Batista's wife, Laguerta and that kid etc. I'm fine with these subplots as they flesh out these characters for me. I always felt like Batista/Laguerta had some sort of romantic chemistry and the S4 premiere reveal didn't surprise me at all. The filler didn't hinder my enjoyment of the show. Every show has some filler bullshit. In Breaking Bad, Marie and kleptomania is major filler, as well as the ''look at our awesome cars'' montage in Season 5. I can totally forgive that, but my point is, even the highest class of shows have filler. I like the characters enough that their filler is still interesting enough. The only filler that pissed me off in S1-4 was Batista and Giana, but it still had some good scenes and was written well enough that I can forgive it.  I have three problems that are much bigger than filler over S1-4: The biggest problem is the Deus Ex Machina in S2E12, with Lila solving all of Dexter's problems. For me, it's forgivable but it is a bit, again, too over the top. My only other ''problem'' is killing Miguel in S3E11, as the skinner wasn't good enough for the finale. He was a decent villain at best and his death was cheesy and weird. S4's filler amounted to something, like Christine, so I don't think of that arc as filler or a problem.  Seriously though, I only watch S1-4 and it's a stellar set of seasons that I've seen too many times to count. These flaws aren't shit to worry about. Every show has flaws and as long as they're outweighed, it doesn't matter. I feel like S1/2 are in a different league, but S3 is still a very good season of television. It's just not as interesting as ITK or BHB, though it's detrimental to Dexter's character development. S4 has the best close-out run with episodes 9-12, as well as episodes 1-2 and episode 4. Season 4 had so many good episodes and an incredible run to the finale with 9-12 and it was insane, it didn't let up once. Season 4's only bad filler was the neighbourhood watch, but I still find it enjoyable as it is Dexter at its roots: Dex is in a social situation and he's being awkward. I think S1-4's problems and ''filler'' are definitely something to overlook. That being said, fuck S5-8 and its filler, it's absolutely show-breaking, terrible, dropped at any moment and hinders your enjoyment greatly. Another reason why I only watch 1-4. Also, Breaking Bad wasn't perfect either, and with how highly regarded it is, just look at how unrealistic the whole plane thing in S2 was, or the half a face thing in S4. I also think Ghost Harry was great in S3, and good to great in S4.  You have to remember too, the show couldn't continue being S1 every single season. We couldn't have Dexter sitting on the couch with Rita being awkward for 4 years, there had to be some sort of progress. You might like lone-Dexter ''maybe if I don't blink my eyes will tear up'' from Season 1 more than married Dexter in Season 4, but he had to progress. The writers had no choice, he had to develop somehow. Season 1 through to Season 4 feels like a very natural progression and 1-4 will always be my favourite show ever."

Dexter,2zdsmi,sarahgracee,7,Wed Mar 18 02:32:37 2015 UTC,"It's always interesting how different people watching the same show interpret things differently.  You see Hannah as a ""Wanted Murderer"", however if anything, through her character development, I think that we've been groomed to believe that Hannah will be a great mother to Harrison.   Hannah isn't the killer Dexter is or thought he was. She doesn't have to kill, and says she's only done it when there were no other alternatives. (Other than her original spree when she was 15).  She will do anything to keep Harrison safe, and he loves her."
Dexter,2zdsmi,Jaesos,7,Tue Mar 17 21:50:32 2015 UTC,"I cried when I found out how it ends. Poor Harrison indeed.  What I don't get is that the show was about Dexter becoming human - or rather finding the human within himself. But then he throws everything away, even his son. How is that even human?"
Dexter,2zdsmi,ChrisVolkoff,8,Tue Mar 17 20:44:29 2015 UTC,I don't know. Such a great show until the ending. I was hoping everyone would find out and there would be a darker tone the last few episodes of a nationwide manhunt for Dexter. Characters visibly broken and darker much like Breaking Bad. But like I said becoming a fucking lumberjack is cool too I guess. /s
Dexter,2zdsmi,The_Sven_Hoek,2,Tue Mar 17 21:05:23 2015 UTC,"The show was flawed for its final few seasons, the ending itself wasn't just bad, the lead up was bad too"
Dexter,2zdsmi,falcon4287,7,Mon Mar 23 00:35:55 2015 UTC,"From the point of view of someone with his- for the lack of a better term- mental health issues, he did what he felt brought closure to the things he was concerned about.    A lot of people have the same view you have about this finale towards people who commit suicide. They think it's a selfish act. But often, it's done because the person believes that they bring pain and hardship to the people they care about, and removing themselves from those peoples' lives, while it may be painful for a short time, is ultimately the best thing for them.    When I watched the finale, I really did feel like Dexter's intention was to die in the storm. Everything he did prior to going out there painted a perfect picture of someone planning to commit suicide. He paid respect to his sister in an extreme and irrationally emotional way, he made sure that his son had someone to take care of him, and he helped make the two people he cared the most about safe. I think that within the story, his survival of the wreck was either a fluke or just his very strong survival instinct. Obviously meta however, his survival of the wreck and will to cling to life was symbolic of the writer's will to cling to a franchise that was stretched one season too thin. I.E. I think the lumberjack scene was tacked on by producers after the script was finished because they wanted to make all the fans happy and they didn't want to throw away possible future revenue. Also, now Dexter+Beard = x2 merch."
Dexter,2zdsmi,ChrisVolkoff,3,Tue Mar 17 22:17:15 2015 UTC,"A lot of people have the same view you have about this finale towards people who commit suicide.   Interesting point that you bring up, as someone who's been ""there.""   When I watched the finale, I really did feel like Dexter's intention was to die in the storm.   It's the exact same for me. Everything made it seem like he was going to end his life after he ""relieved"" Deb - and it would have made sense, really - but he didn't. Somehow I think he should have done one or the other. Either kill himself or join his son and Hannah. The fact that he's still alive while his son is out there makes me sad.   I think the lumberjack scene was tacked on by producers after the script was finished   That's kind of the same feeling I got. I thought that the ending was something the writers just glued to a script they had written."

Dexter,2zdsmi,denvertebows15,3,Sun Mar 22 19:42:35 2015 UTC,"Dexter states it pretty clearly in the finale. He says something along the lines that he wanted to be normal all his life, but now that he feels normal he doesn't want to feel the feelings normal people do. Also the fact that he believes he is the cause of everything bad in the lives of people around him caused him to fake his death and get away from them. To spare them the hurt that he thinks/knows he'll eventually cause them."
Dexter,2zdsmi,Kraisen,2,Fri Apr 17 04:45:41 2015 UTC,"The best I can come up with is that Dexter would never be able to overcome his dark passenger.  I don't know, I have trouble with the ending, too. But my best rationalization is that he did turn out to be a monster after all."
Dexter,2zdsmi,Freelance_JIDF_Shill,2,Thu Mar 19 06:41:36 2015 UTC,The lesson dexter should've learned is that he fucked up everything he had because he ignored his real personality in favour of being more human. He should've started ended at the same place he started from.

Dexter,2zga5a,upyoars,2,Wed Mar 18 09:51:01 2015 UTC,Not too shabby an ending. Would be interesting to watch the collapse of those around him as you mentioned. The escaping prison seems a little far-fetched as he has slid by so long.
Dexter,2zga5a,FlyRobot,2,Wed Mar 18 18:36:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I just think they should have ended it with him driving his boat into the hurricane.  An ambiguous ending that leaves us thinking he's dead. It would be fitting that the entire Morgan family is dead. (except Harrison, I guess)  I just think that, if someone had to die, it should have been Dexter. And if Debra had to die, then they both should."
Dexter,2zga5a,Kraisen,1 point,Thu Mar 19 06:45:30 2015 UTC,"Aww that would be so sad and I don't think I would like that because I like Dexter's character so much. I guess noone can really be close friends with a character like that in real life but I would be content with watching the life of a real life Dexter unfold as an outsider and I would want a good, fruitful future for him.   It's all subjective but for me personally, I'm kind of attracted to darkness in people. Dexter is the main character, hes dark, and we know almost every single thing about him, including subtle intricacies in his behavior. All of this makes me, personally, feel closer to him than anyone else (so he should keep on living and delve/indulge into a new interesting phase or part of his life) and I don't really care too much about what's the right way to end the story of the life of a serial killer because hes not just a ruthless mindless serial killer, he's more of a vigilante, he's Dexter, a very smart and interesting character who's more logical and objective than he is subjective, and I think I'd like him better than a lot of normal people if he was real and I could observe his life from the outside, its too juicy to resist."
Dexter,2zga5a,Kraisen,1 point,Thu Mar 19 09:53:14 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, I loved Dexter as a character, and wanted him to have a happy ending and get away with everything he's done.  However, as a series, I think it would have been SO much more fitting if it had ended with him riding into the hurricane because it's ambiguous and just feels wrong that Debra dies and he doesn't. I didn't want him to die, but I feel like I would remember the series more fondly because that ending would feel so much more powerful and fitting to me.  Also, I really didn't want anything to happen to Debra, but I kind of expected it a little bit because going into the finale I knew SOMETHING was going to happen and I doubted it would be Dexter being killed."
Dexter,2zga5a,kevintehguts,1 point,Fri Mar 20 08:48:40 2015 UTC,"lol what if dexter died, appeared in hell, and all of his victims are grouped up and they smile at him, then he says ""oh shit"" or something and runs"

Dexter,2z6frf,TheBakeBoss,8,Mon Mar 16 19:24:07 2015 UTC,The slow death of passable writing on the show Dexter. That's what this is.
Dexter,2z6frf,AnalogDan,0,Mon Mar 16 20:07:33 2015 UTC,I actually liked Season 6
Dexter,2z86xs,Weltall548,12,Mon Mar 16 12:53:21 2015 UTC,Yeah season 2 for sure. I always thought the biggest misstep they made was doing that story line in season two. Were they so out of ideas right out of the gate that the only thing they could think of was to take their meticulous and invisible serial killer and have him get potentially caught?
Dexter,2z86xs,broncoz33,7,Mon Mar 16 14:14:26 2015 UTC,"Often in cable, the writing is so ahead of production, and production starts way before the airdate, that the scripts for the finale are locked before the show is renewed (usually on a season-by-season basis). Chances are they had an awesome idea they didn't want to sit on because they had no idea if they were going to be back or not. That's why almost every season has an ending that could more or less work as a finale."
Dexter,2z86xs,welshwordman,2,Mon Mar 16 14:55:41 2015 UTC,That is what I figured but in my mind having that in your back pocket if they were on the fence would be a great tool. Say after the second or third season they are now on the fence about renewing so you bust that out and the pitch would be so easy. Just tell them they can advertise it as the explosive final season and lay out the outline for the hunt for the Bay Harbor Butcher. It is what it is its just frustrating to be on the outside looking in on that one.
Dexter,2z86xs,broncoz33,3,Mon Mar 16 15:00:37 2015 UTC,"the thing that bummed me out was they feared to make LaGuerta hunting Dex the end game when it makes perfect sense (I believe they said ""we've done that before""). They could've ended in the shipping container where ""it all began"", it was exciting stuff, but was ultimately a small part of the whole seventh season. Instead we got ANOTHER boring serial killer in Miami for the end game. I just finished season 7 on a rewatch--small tweaks or as is, it could've been a powerful series finale.  On a side note, I think season 2 being so awesome, and season 4 raising those stakes is why season 3 get overlooked. It's sandwiched between the two most exciting seasons."
Dexter,2z86xs,welshwordman,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:08:36 2015 UTC,"Instead we got ANOTHER boring serial killer in Miami for the end game.   Yeah, I don't get this thinking.  Lets avoid this thing we did once and do something that has been done pretty much every season.  They could have built on it with LaGuerta pulling in other detectives (Quinn, Batista, Mike if they don't kill him off) and eventually Matthews buying in.  I would much rather have seen a slow build of long-standing characters building a case against him culminating in him having to decide to flee, try to fix it, or be caught than the nonsensical and disappointing actual final season."
Dexter,2z86xs,Sideshow_Slob,3,Wed Mar 18 14:37:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think they could've done a LaGuerta arc easily going into season 8 and made every episode feel like the world was collapsing (a la Breaking Bad) but there was so much nonsense with the Brain Surgeon and the mother of the code, ugh."
Dexter,2z86xs,welshwordman,2,Wed Mar 18 14:40:02 2015 UTC,"It was like watching a bad CSI show that last season (especially with that horrific age progression scene and Harrison's fall) and borderline comedic when watched alongside the Breaking Bad one.  I was sure Dexter's world was going to start collapsing around him, but of course it didn't.  Why would someone want to see what they've been teased with for 7 seasons actually happen when they can see one with a cookie-cutter plot that's riddled with plotholes?"
Dexter,2z86xs,Sideshow_Slob,8,Wed Mar 18 14:53:41 2015 UTC,Season 1 y'all can hate me but it was perfect
Dexter,2z86xs,EntWaffle,1 point,Mon Mar 16 23:08:36 2015 UTC,Seconded. That's the only season of the show that I think really lived up to its full potential
Dexter,2z86xs,docrevolt,2,Sat Mar 21 01:42:10 2015 UTC,You sir are amazing
Dexter,2z86xs,EntWaffle,4,Sat Mar 21 19:13:26 2015 UTC,Ending at season 2 or season 4 would've definitely solidified it as one of the greatest TV series of all-time.
Dexter,2z86xs,MICHAELSD01,3,Tue Mar 17 05:14:58 2015 UTC,Season 5 should have been written as a wrap up season instead of a season that just put The show in a position to keep going on. The ending of season 4 was so good and enotional and the first episode of season 5 was great (except for that bathroom murder) showing that Dexter truly does seem to have some feelings and isn't always the most trustworthy narrator. Season 5 should have continued as the epic conclusion.
Dexter,2z86xs,CatapaulonitDude,3,Tue Mar 17 21:57:21 2015 UTC,"I think Season 5 should've ended with Lumen & Dexter riding off into the sunset, the whole separation thing never had to happen. Dexter & Lumen can be a serial killer duo and that's all I want :("
Dexter,2z86xs,Armina-San,2,Wed Mar 18 04:22:02 2015 UTC,"I just don't feel like lumen or her story arc should have been included at all. Giving the season another ""big bad"" that Dexter was after put the show right back in its seasonal formula and put the show in a position to keep going. The season should have stuck with that whole arc about the tribity's son recognizing Dexter, and that should have led to some form of ending to the show."
Dexter,2z86xs,CatapaulonitDude,3,Wed Mar 18 20:20:27 2015 UTC,"Season 4.   The Trinity killer was the most sinister villain of the entire series.  He was the mirror opposite to Dexter. He was a serial killer who could not stop killing no matter how horrible he felt about it. He had a grizzly MO, extremely high intelligence, and a story. He had a story. I sat on the edge of my seat that whole season. I had to know WHY Arthur was the way he was.   Then we find out... Arthur has a family. A REAL Family. Something Dexter aspires to, but he doesn't understand. But we soon find out that Arthur's family is broken, because of him.   Finally, there's the ending of the season. Which shows Dexter as the monster he really is.   ""I'm what's wrong... This is fate.""  None of the seasons after it gave me that RUSH. None of them were as meticulous or well thought out. They didn't have the love and care that it took to make such a season. So, for me, Dexter always ended with the Trinity Killer teaching him a lesson."
Dexter,2z86xs,Lecter07,2,Wed Mar 18 19:39:25 2015 UTC,season 1 or season 4
Dexter,2z86xs,nchasz_96,5,Thu Mar 19 01:27:13 2015 UTC,I'd have to say season 4. It seemed like it would be very fitting for the show to start and end with a boy in blood.
Dexter,2z86xs,VinnyValentini,3,Mon Mar 16 22:12:11 2015 UTC,"Especially since Dexter's arc and conclusion at the end of season 8 (I hurt everyone I love) is just a less powerful version of the ending of season 4 (""this is fate"")"
Dexter,2z86xs,docrevolt,2,Sat Mar 21 01:41:25 2015 UTC,"Yup. As someone who is watching for the first time and just finished season 4, that would've been the most epic finale ever.  I kind of don't want the show to continue."
Dexter,2z86xs,AssaultedCracker,0,Thu Mar 26 15:58:21 2015 UTC,Keep going. Trust me. I'm rewatching it now. On season 6. Seasons 7 and 8 are the only 2 that may not be worth watching but seasons 5 and 6 are great. Season 6 is my third favorite season behind seasons 1 and 4 respectively.
Dexter,2z86xs,VinnyValentini,1 point,Thu Mar 26 16:24:27 2015 UTC,Season 7 would have been a good ending. Season 2 as well.
Dexter,2z86xs,matty25,1 point,Tue Mar 17 00:01:41 2015 UTC,"Season 7 was the redemption season. Dexter should have died in that cargo crate, and Deborah should have followed through with the seven seasons of character development that we had been given. The series' quality HAD dropped, but Season 7 could have sent it out on a high note. Instead, they kept it going 1 season too long."
Dexter,2z86xs,Lecter07,1 point,Wed Mar 18 19:41:16 2015 UTC,"I'm watching for the first time and just posted about potentially quitting after season 4.  It's the only time I've felt like maybe the show could be done for me.  So my vote is definitely season 4.  The return to a boy in blood, the ever growing hints at a redeemed life as a family man, followed by that bleak return to the old Dexter.... it would've gone down as one of the most epic show finales of all time."

Dexter,2z6726,alphadog3939,11,Sun Mar 15 22:58:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, season seven was overall great but I thought there was so much wasted potential. The end really pissed me off. If Dexter killed LaGuerta and that got him caught...oh man, that would have been FANTASTIC."
Dexter,2z6726,Starburstnova,6,Mon Mar 16 00:18:02 2015 UTC,Yeah they really fucked up by making season 8 happen like a year later. The state was set for an epic season 8 if the picked up that very night and they start investigating laguerta's death. Obviously dexter would be a suspect and the shit writes itself.
Dexter,2z6726,kill_dano,2,Mon Mar 16 04:16:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly. 7 ends on a cliff hanger that's really really good, but then 8 picks up without ever resolving the cliffhanger.  It'd be like ending a season with the hero of some adventure series trapped underground in a tomb full of deathtraps, then starting the next season with him at his office a year later talking about how cool it was when he escaped. It was a terrible decision on the writers part for sure."
Dexter,2z6726,MrMagoo22,16,Mon Mar 16 17:47:18 2015 UTC,You're assuming Deb actually uses her brain. Most of the time she acts on impulse.
Dexter,2z6726,redditor13,5,Sun Mar 15 23:41:52 2015 UTC,Despite trying to be one of the guys she is very emotional.

Dexter,2z6726,faggotslapper42069,2,Mon Mar 16 01:09:38 2015 UTC,"Emotional outburst, obviously.   She knew she had to die, but also knew she could not allow Dexter to kill her, so she used her emotional outburst to give her the balls to kill her, because she knew if she calmed down her logic would kick in and she would not be able to allow Dexter to go through with it.  Like ripping a band aid off... you do it quick cause if you know if you do it slowly you won't have the balls to go through with it."
Dexter,2z6726,kill_dano,3,Mon Mar 16 04:19:45 2015 UTC,"I thought season 7 was easily one of the best, which is why it is so sad that season 8 is... well... what it is.  I certainly wouldn't say to stop watching now, but just try not to get your hopes up after enjoying season 7."
Dexter,2z6726,radgry,2,Mon Mar 16 02:21:56 2015 UTC,Maybe Deb shot her because she knew she couldn't kill her brother and she didn't want Laguerta to be chopped up into pieces or whatever Dexter did. And perhaps she also wanted to incriminate herself in her death to further protect Dexter. If turning in Dexter meant turing in herself she'd be less likely to do it in the future and it was a way of protecting him and going in on the deed together. However in typical Deb fashion she didn't think things through.
Dexter,2z6726,AmityN7,2,Mon Mar 16 04:07:44 2015 UTC,Show should have ended with deb shooting dex
Dexter,2z6726,kill_dano,1 point,Mon Mar 16 04:15:05 2015 UTC,"Great point, Deb invited brought that all on herself, per usual"
Dexter,2z6726,pottswanna,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:44:33 2015 UTC,"If the first episode of season 8 deflates all that built up enthusiasm like it did for me, I'd highly suggest you pretend that season 7 is the last season and skip 8. I know a lot of people said to stop after 4 but 5,6, and 7 aren't actually all that bad and 7 especially was actually quite good. 8 is a train wreck. 8 shouldn't have happened."

Dexter,2z0ada,nuggetinabuiscuit,2,Sun Mar 15 19:51:34 2015 UTC,"Favourite: Probably the whole ITK is dex's brother part. I remember at the end of I believe it was shrink wrap, where they reveal Rudy Cooper as the ice truck killer.   Least favourite: None  Rating 10/10  Best episode: Born free or Shrink wrap  My favourite season and what go me hooked on Dexter, the story was great, as were the antagonists, everyone from the therapist, the smugger guy and of course Brian Moser were all great. I even read the book 'Darkly Dreaming Dexter', which is pretty much season 1, with some slight differences."
Dexter,2z0ada,Weltall548,2,Sun Mar 15 19:50:32 2015 UTC,"It's the best season. Rating: 10/10. The ITK reveal was awesome, and the season spent the least amount of time on those awful romance scenes."

Dexter,2yzwt8,Kwugibo,6,Sat Mar 14 06:26:54 2015 UTC,"I think the ending to the series, minus the lumberjack bit, is perfect.  Dr. Vogel points out to us in Season 8 that Psychopaths don't love in the normal way, and that they pick relationships that benefit themselves most (paraphrased).  From this point forward, we begin to see the final ""evolution"" of Dexter's character, as he begin's to make decisions that he feels are in the best interest of others, and not necessarily just for himself.  I believe this was the reason he didn't make the final kill: He realizes that he doesn't have to be the one to kill him, and by calling Deb in, accepting that he isn't the ""be all-end all"" of the world. He's putting the narcism aside and trying to be a person.  Up until this point, Deb or Rita were Dexter's ""mirrors"" of humanity. He needed them to see himself as a regular person. After he made the decision not to make the kill, they were no longer needed. He had broken free of the belief that he is a strictly a person here to kill, rather than a person who has/can kill.   Deb's death also allows Dexter to connect with real feelings that he hasn't truly experienced previously. Yes, he was shocked when Rita died, but with Deb, he feels the range of human emotions.   Finally, after reflecting on these feelings, he realizes that he loves Hannah and Harrison in an unselfish way -- He cares about them too much to potentially take them down the same road as Deb and Rita, so he sacrifices his future with them to ensure that they can take their own path.  While I hate the lumberjack scene at the end, the importance is the look at his face when he sits down at the table -- He's absolutely miserable and empty inside.. but not ""empty"" like he was at the beginning of the series and void of emotion - but empty in the aspect that everything in his life he cared about is now gone, and after all these years of wanting to be a person, he is, but its too late."

Dexter,2yzwt8,geogabs,2,Fri Mar 20 03:26:16 2015 UTC,You nailed my feelings about it.
Dexter,2yzwt8,JiveTurkey1983,2,Sat Mar 14 20:31:15 2015 UTC,"Dexter leaves because he (finally) realizes that he's a poison, a destructive force to the lives of those he cares about... Deb, Rita, et al.  The problem with this -- aside from the overall shitty execution of Season 8 as a whole -- is that it's thematically muddled. Dexter was a poison BECAUSE HE WAS A SERIAL KILLER; his murderous urges were incompatible with the notion of leading a normal life. At the very least, Dexter's loved ones came to harm, and his relationships inevitably fell apart, because he tried to walk in both worlds. To be BOTH a boyfriend, brother, family man, etc. and a killer.  This isn't why Deb died, however. Deb died because Dexter was ""cured"" and opted not to kill Saxon. If Dex is cured, then he no longer need fear that his murderous nature will cause harm to his loved ones.   Deb didn't die because Dex was a serial killer. Deb died because Dex was an incompetent serial killer."
Dexter,2yzwt8,zahsome,1 point,Tue Mar 17 15:43:03 2015 UTC,"I heard that HBO (or whatever channel hosted dexter) absolutely refused to let him die in any way. I have a feeling they wanted him to get caught in the end, but HBO refused to let it happen."

Dexter,2ywtqa,james52262,21,Fri Mar 13 14:16:12 2015 UTC,"Your post isn't marked for spoilers, so just in case: Lots of fuckin' spoilers below.  My favorite is season 2, and by a significant margin. Having Dexter under federal investigation from the get-go, the introduction of SuperAgent Lundy, Doakes and Dex's confrontations (""I own you""), Doakes learning the truth, the Dark Passenger monologue, the BHB Manifesto, Little Chino, LaGuerta's refusal to believe Doakes was the BHB, ""Greetings from Miami"", revenge for his mom, and nearly every single episode had him nearly getting caught and just managing to squirm out of the stranglehold at the last second.   I also loved the conversations between Doakes & Dex when James was in the cage. The revelations about his history and pondering turning himself in. That season just had it all.  I know some people get annoyed by Lila, and pretty much everything about her, but I think she was a phenomenal addition to show what life with someone as whacked-out as he is (or more) would be like, and why it was important for him to have Rita in his life, and the kids.  Man, I'm super nostalgic now. I'm gonna watch some S2 when I get home from work today..."
Dexter,2ywtqa,Treedom_Lighter,10,Fri Mar 13 16:45:35 2015 UTC,"I think Season 2's arc where Dexter is caught between Lundy's and Doakes' simultaneous investigations could have been an amazing final season, minus the Lila layer. Even with the allowance of Dexter getting away with it, pinning it all on Doakes in the same way. It could have been a really simple and compelling dichotomy without all the rubbish of Season 8's character parade.    Also - I think my favorite scene in the entire series (at least in the top 5) is when Dexter fantasizes about confessing to Deb. It's the funniest thing that ever happened in the whole show. ""I'm him...The Butcher"" with that frenzied look on MCH's face. It's so funny."
Dexter,2ywtqa,REMAIN_IN_LIGHT,3,Fri Mar 13 17:32:19 2015 UTC,That scene is gold. His face when he gets shot in the head is so great.
Dexter,2ywtqa,Slaytounge,3,Fri Mar 13 19:44:22 2015 UTC,"Ha, yes! Forgot about that daydream sequence that was gold.  I meant to add kind of what you said to my original post as well... Season 2 would have made a phenomenal final season. I wanted more than anything for Batista and/or Quinn to find out who Dexter really was, and the final season could have been Miami Metro trying to track and arrest him. I think seeing the inner-workings of the station at the same time as seeing Dexter's moves and attempts to throw them off his trail would have been super-compelling. I'd watch the shit out of that.  I'm one of the few who thought that season 8 was pretty decent (for the most part, I'll never forgive the daylight stalking of Daniel Vogel outside a restaurant in plain view of a thousand people then walking slowly after him toward his car. What was your fucking plan there!?!?). But, I think it could have been a Breaking Bad-finale amazing if everyone everywhere found out exactly who he was, and he either got away with it (hell, even to LumberJackTown) or was put down by Deb or Batista in the end. But alas, it is what it is."
Dexter,2ywtqa,Treedom_Lighter,2,Fri Mar 13 20:36:29 2015 UTC,Yes. It was the only season where I felt Dexter was truly in danger of being found out or of being killed. Everyone was onto him or after him in some way. It is by far the most thrilling season.
Dexter,2ywtqa,geogabs,19,Fri Mar 20 03:32:04 2015 UTC,"Season 1 is still my favorite.    You're getting the most insight into the character since he's new to everyone, and MCH is playing it with energy and discovery. You share in his sense of freshness with this ""neat monster."" It might not be his best acting of the series, but I'd argue it's his most interesting.    The only apparent shaky aspect to Season 1 is the contrasting freshness of Jennifer Carpenter – I think she's still getting her footing and comes across a little sophomoric, insecure, but perhaps that's part of her own exploration of the character, adding that layer to Deb's personality. For that reason, I think, it still works really well.    Season 1 is a perfectly wrapped segment (or body part?) of a television show. It's what you suggest to someone to introduce them to the premise, as it is the introduction, but they could have ended the show right then, and it would have been a cult masterpiece.   I love Seasons 2 and 4 though, as well, for obvious reasons. I think the story arc of Season 2 is just as compelling as 4, but for different reasons. Dexter, facing exposure, starts doubting himself in Season 2 only to come to a place of confidence. Season 4 is the opposite, he's confident and then the rug is suddenly pulled out from underneath him.    Also, Trinity was of course the ultimate super bad of the series, but I really enjoyed Issak Sirko immensely. It was just superbly acted by Ray Stevenson. The true bright spot of the second half of the series."
Dexter,2ywtqa,REMAIN_IN_LIGHT,1 point,Fri Mar 13 17:26:58 2015 UTC,"Just my opinion, but I think Carpenter's acting was just as great that season as it was for the rest of the series, it was just way more awkward. She was trying to make a name for herself in Homicide to get out of Vice, so was expectedly nervous and self-conscious. When she presents her idea of the stolen ice truck, she sounds so nervous that she's half-swallowing her own words. Same thing when she brings up the idea of a copycat, and ends up pretty much nailing Dexter's profile without even knowing it.  Dexter's subsequent dismissal of the idea (only to save his own hide of course) and Deb's determination to have it heard by LaGuerta et al made my skin crawl but that was the idea I think, to have the outward dorkiness of the Morgan siblings contrasting for such completely different reasons. It's kind of like the Napoleon Dynamite effect. You feel so awkward for the characters because they're portraying awkwardness so well. Just my two cents."
Dexter,2ywtqa,Treedom_Lighter,2,Fri Mar 20 13:19:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I was kind of processing my thought as I wrote that comment. Her awkwardness is intentional. Maybe it was just her delivery sometimes. But you're right – she does an excellent job of portraying Deb's unsure footing. I think the character got a lot more interesting once she gained some confidence, which is the mark of good writing (at the time) well-handled by Carpenter."
Dexter,2ywtqa,REMAIN_IN_LIGHT,11,Fri Mar 20 14:59:49 2015 UTC,"Season 6, so many twists I was on the edge of my seat"
Dexter,2ywtqa,TheBigBitch,2,Fri Mar 13 16:55:31 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed season 6. 1, 2, 4, and 6 are my favorite. Not necessarily in that order."
Dexter,2ywtqa,Alibear,3,Fri Mar 13 19:11:45 2015 UTC,Season 2 is my favorite. I love how the police is actually closing in on Dexter
Dexter,2ywtqa,Sakheteu,3,Fri Mar 13 18:01:07 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I think my favorite season was really season one. I loved the idea that the ITK was Dex's brother and that both tried to simultaneously help the other and that Deb was caught in the middle. It was a great intro to the show."
Dexter,2ywtqa,GLaDOs18,3,Fri Mar 13 19:49:40 2015 UTC,I love everything about season 1. It's my go to season if I really need something to watch.
Dexter,2ywtqa,nerfAvari,3,Fri Mar 13 20:52:49 2015 UTC,"I really like season 5.  My favorite is actually three. I'm in a minority here, but whenever I get the Dexter itch, it's usually season 3. I love the tone and color of that season.   It's closely tied with season 1, it was a magical season. Whenever I hear them using that track with the female vocalists, I think of Dexter and Rudy."
Dexter,2ywtqa,welshwordman,5,Fri Mar 13 15:05:32 2015 UTC,"Season 3 is one of my favorites as well, the chess game Dexter and Miguel end up playing is fucking great. Also the atmosphere is something to be appreciated, the music really adds a lot in that season."
Dexter,2ywtqa,Slaytounge,4,Fri Mar 13 18:26:16 2015 UTC,"for sure! the music, man, is so good on that show."
Dexter,2ywtqa,welshwordman,2,Fri Mar 13 18:48:55 2015 UTC,"I actually like 4,5 and 6.  The Lithgow season was fantastic.  I liked the Lumen storyline although it started to go off the rails a bit.  Finally I loved the doomsday deaths, the 4 horsemen and the angel were fantastic 'kills' although it did get silly near the end."
Dexter,2ywtqa,DirtyMud,2,Fri Mar 13 20:14:50 2015 UTC,"Spoilers!  I think it was season 6, when his wife gets murdered. I was not expecting that at all!"

Dexter,2ywtqa,minuteforce,2,Fri Mar 20 03:35:53 2015 UTC,"I like the second season the most because I like the idea of Dexter playing cat-and-mouse with law enforcement and being forced to push his boundaries in order to stay afloat. My favourite part of the season is probably when he decides to really fight back, in a sense, by typing up a manifesto, rather than just being reactive.  I actually really would have liked season 7 or 8 to involve him being straight-up on the run and killing whoever along the way in order to survive and evade"
Dexter,2ywtqa,Treedom_Lighter,2,Sat Mar 14 00:33:31 2015 UTC,"Totally agree, and even though I loved him being proactive with the manifesto, I loved the twist of Lundy figuring it out in just one day. It showed that Dex had a real adversary in Frank Lundy, and that it wouldn't be very easy for him to get away with everything."
Dexter,2ywtqa,jgt815,2,Mon Mar 16 14:45:37 2015 UTC,I think season 6 is my favorite. The whole end of the world thing and the whole bible thing was crazy and i loved it

Dexter,2ywtqa,mle70,-5,Fri Mar 13 17:54:14 2015 UTC,Season 4 is where you should stop.  No reason to move forward after it.  It's the best season compared to many televisions shows.  Every other season is half cooked.
Dexter,2ywtqa,geogabs,2,Fri Mar 13 18:27:39 2015 UTC,"Come on, you seriously didn't like season 7?"
Dexter,2ywtqa,mle70,-1,Sat Mar 14 01:46:06 2015 UTC,"ha, no. Barely remember it beside a feeling of abuse. Like having a creepy uncle that took advantage of my innocence."
Dexter,2yqu77,alsoye,27,Thu Mar 12 01:17:13 2015 UTC,You're not wrong. Not wrong at all. He was trying to grow as a person and it backfired.
Dexter,2yqu77,Frothing_Wang,23,Thu Mar 12 01:35:21 2015 UTC,"Dexter said that himself, that he wished he had killed trinity earlier, near the end of the season iirc"
Dexter,2yqu77,SparkzOut,10,Thu Mar 12 02:08:23 2015 UTC,"Thanksgiving episode, ""I should have killed you when I had the fucking chance!"""
Dexter,2yqu77,BaconAllDay2,2,Thu Mar 12 16:11:08 2015 UTC,Best moment of season 4 imo
Dexter,2yqu77,TheBakeBoss,18,Mon Mar 16 19:12:40 2015 UTC,"Dexter tried to become more human for his family through a guy who had done so for 30 years. It made sense that he'd want to learn how to keep up his facade so well, since Dexter's was failing.  ''I should have fucking killed you when I had the chance.''"
Dexter,2yqu77,Erekt__Butthole,14,Thu Mar 12 03:38:32 2015 UTC,"Season 1 he was found out by Brian. Season 2 he was found out by Doakes and Lila...and almost found out by Miami Metro. Season 3 he was found out by Miguel.  He made plenty of mistakes. The Castillos were the first that we see. Befriending and trusting both Lila and Miguel. He was always more reckless and careless than anybody seems to care to admit. It was a slow progression, but he was always far from perfect."
Dexter,2yqu77,Starburstnova,4,Thu Mar 12 04:11:13 2015 UTC,"That's not the issue I had with the later seasons. I just thought they were poorly written for the most part (really just six and eight--I liked seasons 5 and 7).   And yeah, I'm pretty sure that was the whole point of the season, he didn't kill trinity to try and learn from him regarding family, and the price he paid was losing his family."
Dexter,2yqu77,welshwordman,8,Thu Mar 12 14:45:35 2015 UTC,"I don't see the relevance here...the show was totally different after season 4.  The tone, lighting, and entire look in general.  The entire production felt cheaper.  Characters motives changed for seemingly no reason.  Seasons 1-4 weren't perfect (though the story you use as an example with Trinity made perfect sense given the context) but the production value is way higher.  I don't think you understand why people break it down the way they do.  It's totally fine if you personally enjoy all of it, or enjoy the later seasons more.  That's all human opinion, but the technical quality took a blatant hit after season 4.  even the awards if received reflected that trend."
Dexter,2yqu77,Scapone22,3,Thu Mar 12 11:19:50 2015 UTC,well he wanted it all...the perfect life and to have his dark passenger
Dexter,2yqu77,mrleetyler,3,Thu Mar 12 08:43:30 2015 UTC,Was that not the whole point of season 4? I don't get what you're saying.
Dexter,2yqu77,silas34,3,Thu Mar 12 12:31:23 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what the point of this thread was. You point out one large mistake he made from seasons 1-4. I can name about 20 from seasons 4 on. So the people that say he made a lot more mistakes towards the end are right. Your thread really just proves the point you're trying to argue.
Dexter,2yqu77,velocity92c,1 point,Thu Mar 12 13:57:00 2015 UTC,"Not to mention this mistake had a purpose, to see how to be family man like Trinity was. It was just a bad choice. One scene I remember in the last season is Dexter watching Oliver Saxon outside a bar. Dexter is standing right in front of the window in his bright ass colored shirt in broad day light to stalk him and SAXON KNOWS WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE. Not only does he spot Dexter but he runs to his car and slashes Dexter's tires since he parked right next to him. Why would Dexter who stalks people all the time, can lose tails and sneak away from FBI, and all kinds of crazy stuff do something that stupid?"
Dexter,2yqu77,BlindStark,3,Sat Mar 14 07:45:58 2015 UTC,"Dexter's missteps and hardships here are simply part of the arc he goes through in that season, and that doesn't necessarily make the season bad. Dexter has always been a flawed character, or else he'd have been uninteresting.  He tries to emulate Trinity, who projects a false image of success and balance, and it goes wrong in a myriad of ways. I think it was understandable that he had such a goal, and he suffered consequences for his overconfidence. The problem is, in the season after, it became clear that he didn't learn from them."
Dexter,2yqu77,minuteforce,2,Thu Mar 12 14:22:15 2015 UTC,Pretty close to right on. After S4 he began getting 'getting light and loose with the code' and one of TVs best characters began crumbling away into sitcom buffoonery....

Dexter,2yqu77,peacecake,0,Tue Mar 17 15:45:05 2015 UTC,The show had minor problems throughout.  Doakes finding the truth way too early then getting deus ex machinaed by Lila was a huge one but the overall quality was still there.  From start to finish season 8 had no redeeming qualities whatsoever. That isn't being blind that is just a different opinion.
Dexter,2ymsh7,BackAlleyPrisonRape,31,Wed Mar 11 02:05:38 2015 UTC,"I recommend Fargo (the TV series, loosely inspired by the movie of the same name). It's intense and darkly comic. The main characters are for the most part detestable but compelling. Billy Bob Thornton and Martin Freeman nail their performances.  I'll throw in another vote for Hannibal as well. Its serial killers are even more over the top than Dexter's (occasionally almost to the point of unintentional silliness) but the real draw is the dynamic between Will Graham and Hannibal Lecter."
Dexter,2ymsh7,const_iterator,10,Wed Mar 11 03:03:56 2015 UTC,I just finished Fargo a few hours ago and I can definitely say that Dexter viewers will love it.
Dexter,2ymsh7,IupvotestupidCRAP,2,Wed Mar 11 06:24:23 2015 UTC,"I'd watch the movie first and see how the show did it differently. Imo, much more story and the characters are deeper."
Dexter,2ymsh7,bad-r0bot,3,Wed Mar 11 14:22:47 2015 UTC,"Martin Freeman's character Lester is clearly inspired by William H. Macy's original character, and we get MUCH more background and deeper detail in the TV series than the film. The same is true of the female lead police officer in both: we get way more from the series."

Dexter,2ymsh7,thisisadistraction3,1 point,Wed Mar 11 14:14:10 2015 UTC,"Except Dexter is designed to be somewhat of a comedy, especially in the first four seasons (the only seasons).  Hannibal has close to 0 comedic qualities."
Dexter,2ymsh7,Erekt__Butthole,12,Sat Apr 18 18:13:07 2015 UTC,The second season finale is the best finale I've seen on TV(not exaggerating).   That being said there is definetely more filler in Hannibal than Breaking Bad and Dexter.
Dexter,2ymsh7,der1x,3,Wed Mar 11 03:40:00 2015 UTC,"Absurd. The show is slow-moving and contemplative at times, but that's just the way it is. There were PLENTY of slow moments in Breaking Bad. (People seem to forget that because they remember all the cool/flash-bang moments, but for every scene of Walt blowin' some shit up there are fifteen scenes of Skylar staring pensively into the middle distance as she contemplates what her life has become)."
Dexter,2ymsh7,lbcsax,8,Tue Mar 17 15:52:56 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree there. There were so many moments in Breaking Bad, mostly season 2 and with Skyler, that I wanted to fast forward."
Dexter,2ymsh7,der1x,6,Wed Mar 11 04:43:31 2015 UTC,When I mean filler I mean episodes that dont move the plot forward or if they do its very slowly.

Dexter,2ymsh7,jondrethegiant,13,Wed Mar 11 12:25:32 2015 UTC,This! The show is amazing. It's hard to compare the two but if I had to I would say that Hannibal is maybe a tad better than Dexter. It's very edgy and a lot more serious and intense than Dexter. Give it a try.

Dexter,2ymsh7,DistortedEyes,8,Wed Mar 11 12:36:39 2015 UTC,The Fall. I think both seasons are on netflix now. It stars Jillian Anderson and Jamie Dornan. It's only 6 episodes per season and definitely worth checking out. It's along the same lines as dexter where the main character is a serial killer and his family doesn't know. Jamie Dornan is phenomenally creepy.

Amazing show. outlaw motorcycle gang. takes the law into their own hands. usually have good intentions but there is A LOT of killing and crime. the main character is one you can respect and look up to for his integrity and intuition. And also the ending is sooooooo much better then Dexter. I would go on a limb and say it is the best show ending that I have ever seen.
Dexter,2ymsh7,sassman93,-2,Wed Mar 11 13:27:47 2015 UTC,really Jax driving his motorcycle into a truck a better ending. The last season of sons of anarchy was one of the worst last seasons of any show ever.
Dexter,2ymsh7,Beagle2007,1 point,Thu Mar 12 06:10:30 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but I completely disagree. every loose end was tied up at the end there was finally peace. unfortunately the last thing needed for that was for Jax to die. he even says it to the DA Patterson. he said at the end of today it's all over and the bad guys lose.   why was it bad in your opinion?
Dexter,2ymsh7,sassman93,1 point,Thu Mar 12 14:56:19 2015 UTC,"too much filler like chibs and jarry, ,the chinese and august marks. It was fairly predictable that Juice would rat on Gemma about killing Tara. Marilyn Manson's character was wasted.  Bobby should not have been killed.3 or 4 episodes after the sixth season would have been enough to wrap everything up"
Dexter,2ymsh7,Beagle2007,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:40:30 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree there was a lot of predictability  in the last season but I don't think their intentions were to keep it a secret. from the moment Tara is killed you know Jax is going to find out eventually and when Abel overhears Jemma you know it's only a matter of time before shit hits the fan. what I like was the way it was all done. from a theatrical perspective, It was portrayed rather nicely.   as for Bobby getting killed, there was no real reason for it to happen. the only thing that I could think for that is to add more weight to juices actions of lying and blaming the Chinese. up until that moment, no relevant club member was killed."

If you like the psychological and self discovery part of Dexter I have a few that may be out of the ordinary..  Homeland.  Claire Danes plays an exceptional character as a CIA agent. While her job consumes most of her life along with her slight mental hindrance (as you learn throughout the show). I think there can be a few similarities of self concept, especially when it comes to relationships with the opposite sex.   Californication, is also a show that has similar comedic attributes while also containing some serious themes. David Duchovny plays a famous author/sex addict, who typically has a guilty conscious even though he continually hurts his family. He has trouble balancing his estranged wife, daughter and mistresses while usually putting himself in the worst possible situations.   Again, I am a huge fan of Dexter and I love these shows. They are not so much like Dexter from the obvious standpoint but have similar faint psychological issues that drive the characters to do some crazy things."
Dexter,2ymsh7,mostlyidontcare,1 point,Wed Mar 11 05:08:15 2015 UTC,"I love Californication - but it's nothing like Dexter, at all. There's also no 'similar faint psychological issues'.   Still would recommend the show - it's just nothing like Dexter."
Dexter,2ymsh7,m00c0wcy,2,Wed Mar 11 17:36:06 2015 UTC,"A slightly odd recommendation, but the anime Death Note has striking similarities to Dexter. Psychopath murderer who only kills criminals, has inside information from the police department, lots of cat & mouse hunting.    The biggest differences from Dexter are: 1. Heavy supernatural element to the murders 2. The lead characters are actually brilliant, instead of surviving solely due to the idiocy of the police  After Dexter it's a nice experience to watch a show and think ""Holy shit that was smart"" instead of ""Holy shit that was dumb"""

Dexter,2ymsh7,HansBauer94,1 point,Tue Mar 17 15:48:46 2015 UTC,"I'm shocked no one has said X-Files yet. My top 3 favorite shows are Breaking Bad, X-Files and Dexter. Well worth your time and there are 24 45 min episodes per season so there is a shitload of entertainment there. Also, if you like Breaking Bad you'll probably like it. Vince Gilligan started writing for X-Files on S2 or 3 and he wrote some of the best episodes of the series.  But you should not watch X-Files once David Duchovny leaves the show (S8 and S9). And this in not like how everyone says to not watch Dexter after season 4 (which is bullshit). It's really not worth it. Although I hear Aaron Paul was in S8 somewhere."

Dexter,2yo4n5,sekathon,8,Wed Mar 11 14:21:55 2015 UTC,I posted this before but here is how you get the show going again. Few (2-3) years after Dexter dying we open on some fishermen off the coast of Newfoundland. They pull in their catch and see a pair of teeth embedded in a fish with plastic stuck between the teeth.  They have the teeth brought to a lab and the dental records show that the teeth belong to Arthur Mitchell aka The Trinity Killer.  Miami Metro Homicide celebrates the fact that Rita's killer is dead and the case is closed. This doesn't sit well with Angel as he starts to think back about this time in his life and the case.  Why did Arthur turn up in the ocean? And the plastic in the teeth sounds like the Bay Harbor Butcher. Who Laguerta thought was Dexter who's wife was Rita. Could Dexter have been the one who killed Arthur Mitchell and 100's of others?  Wanting to do more research Angel enlists the help Quinn to seek the Dexter who they guess could still be alive.

Dexter,2yi6lt,linx000,19,Tue Mar 10 00:31:06 2015 UTC,I liked Season 7 a lot. They should have had Deb shoot Dexter instead and ended it all right then and there. That would have been a ballsy finale.
Dexter,2yi6lt,matty25,6,Tue Mar 10 02:48:35 2015 UTC,"I wish she tried, dexter escaped, and the season was Deb hunting Dex. That would have been trill"
Dexter,2yi6lt,dylantrevor,3,Tue Mar 10 14:22:46 2015 UTC,Beats Dex turning into a lumberjack.
Dexter,2yi6lt,WienerSnitchelg,9,Tue Mar 10 23:44:44 2015 UTC,"Season 7 was good, but there was so much wasted potential. And the ending could have been great if she'd turned in Dexter. Shooting LaGuerta was SO out of character, but with the writers being the way they were...it didn't surprise me. I actually yelled ""OH COME ON"" at the screen because it was so stupid. At least Deb dealing with it in season 8 was better than her dealing with finding out about Dexter in season 7."
Dexter,2yi6lt,Starburstnova,4,Tue Mar 10 03:00:23 2015 UTC,"Deb should have just shot and killed Dexter at the end of 7...boom, end of series. What a finale that would have been. People would have been shitting bricks and the show would have built itself a formidable legacy."
Dexter,2yi6lt,matty25,6,Tue Mar 10 03:38:50 2015 UTC,"It would have been better, but still out of character for her. I think she'd be way too conflicted to actually kill him at that point. But still better. At very least she should have shot him non-fatally."
Dexter,2yi6lt,Starburstnova,3,Tue Mar 10 05:42:15 2015 UTC,"Really? I thought it made sense. Maybe Deb wasn't still totally ""in love"" with Dexter anymore, or maybe she was, but either way I thought the entire season was basically a story that Deb would go to the ends of the Earth for Dex, because he's her only family and she loves him. When it came down to killing LaGuerta or him, I don't think she wanted to kill either one, but she could live without LaGuerta, she couldn't live without her brother."
Dexter,2yi6lt,JWard515,1 point,Tue Mar 10 05:16:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but she's always been about justice. At that point she knew he'd done wrong. Even if she couldn't live without him, she didn't have to kill either one. She could have turned him in. The only thing I could think of would maybe be self-preservation because she knew about him...but I still don't see it. The whole thing was ridiculous. I get that Dexter was kind of starting to brainwash her into rationalizing it...and maybe as a cop she would buy into it, seeing all the dirtbags who got away...but she still knew he was a killer, and she obviously wasn't happy about it."
Dexter,2yi6lt,Starburstnova,6,Tue Mar 10 05:45:58 2015 UTC,"I loved season 7, my biggest issue with season 8 is that they just swept all of the plotlines like LaGuerta's mysterious death under the rug within the first 5 minutes"
Dexter,2yi6lt,Pointwest418,3,Tue Mar 10 10:26:22 2015 UTC,"I honestly think season 7 was my favorite. I didn't have any problems with any of it, unlike a lot of people. I really liked the dynamic of Deb finally finding out about Dexter's secret because it'd been dangled in front of us for so long, with her almost finding out in Season 5 finale, the whole show seemed to be a build up to her finding out so I though season 7 was really enjoyable.   The finale, I thought, was one of the best season finales I've ever seen. My only regret is that they brushed it off so easily in Season 8. I really think Season 8, as a final season could've been so much more with the LaGuerta killing being a huge deal and Batista looking into it, and Miami Metro putting the heat on Dexter (while not knowing it was Dexter they were putting the heat on until late season) like he'd never been targeted before.   I think if they had made the whole season the most intense case of Dexter being hunted by the department in the history of the show it would've been incredible. Like season 2 but more intense.   Fuck, I would've even been happy with season 8 if he'd just actually died in the hurricane. I've come to understand the logic behind him going into isolation mode and I've made my peace with it so I can enjoy it, but when I thought he was just dead, I was like ""wow that was amazing"" then they fucked me lol"
Dexter,2yi6lt,JWard515,1 point,Tue Mar 10 05:15:21 2015 UTC,"Season 7 was great. Sometimes I wonder if it were to end there, how would we feel? I love seasons 1-5 & 7. 6 bums me out, and 8 makes me mad. I was so excited that 7 didn't bring in some serial killer arc--that, I think was a mistake season 8 made. I think they could've made season 7's arc into an extended one to bleed into 8, but they didn't (most of us assumed that's what they were going to do once they found out they were renewed for 7 and 8 after season 6). Maybe a 16-episode season 7 as a final season would've been an interesting way to extend that arc and give us closure."
Dexter,2yi6lt,welshwordman,1 point,Tue Mar 10 14:34:08 2015 UTC,"Season 7 was a fantastic season. It could have been a great series finale, or it could've set up a great Season 8... neither of which happened"

No one cares and it took up so much screen time)."

I thought his death was pretty satisfying only because they did a good job of getting us to hate him, but I do agree that I wish his story arc had gone on the way they originally intended with him becoming a copy cat killer. That said though, it was nice to see him go, but it was a bit disappointing to see him so causally swept under the rug so to speak. Would've been nice if Dex had done it or something."

With all the implausibilities the show has tried to pull on us with Dexter's character, (occasionally killing innocents, giving a shit about Hannah McKay, letting people go off his table, etc.) why is this such a stretch for Deb's character? It should be no less believable than, say, Dexter getting away with so many murders in such a relatively short span of time."
Dexter,2ydx8q,Presto-Manifesto,4,Mon Mar 9 03:41:33 2015 UTC,"I just feel that it's somewhat out of character for her.

Maybe I'm remembering the show wrong, but that's my take on it.   Oh but I do fully agree on the rest of the bullshit the show pulls.   My biggest otherwise story gripe is Dex leaving Harrison with Hannah as opposed to say Jamie, who he knows isn't a killer."

The way the show presented it made it definitely uncomfortable, but I would have liked to see where that went if it was done a little better. Yeah, the whole Hannah McKay thing made me really question how these post season 4 writers ever got the job. Was it all some kind of inside joke, maybe? Something they all laughed about amongst themselves? I don't know, if I was writing for a show that I knew people would have to pay to see I would try to make it as quality as I possibly could. That's just how I feel about it."

Dexter,2yef7v,froggiekid,-2,Mon Mar 9 02:24:42 2015 UTC,Dexter isn't an introvert if that's what you're getting at.
Dexter,2yef7v,Presto-Manifesto,2,Mon Mar 9 03:45:13 2015 UTC,Why would you say that? He's definitely an introvert because he doesn't show his feelings or any feelings at all and tries to fit in but has trouble doing so. Obviously his problems are deeper than just being an introvert but he definitely falls under the category.
Dexter,2yef7v,BlindStark,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:08:34 2015 UTC,"Nah, man. A real introvert wouldn't be able to live a life like that, even if he were faking his emotions, or whatever. And if you were basing whether a person was an introvert or an extrovert on the article alone, then if he were a true introvert, he would have chosen to live in a mountainous area as soon as he was able, instead of getting a place in Miami."
Dexter,2yef7v,Presto-Manifesto,1 point,Tue Mar 10 04:19:01 2015 UTC,"Yes they would.. there are plenty of introverts that do. An introvert may have trouble expressing their emotions but that doesn't mean they don't have any. Are you saying an introvert can't live a life like Dexters? They aren't mentally challenged or something, you probably know many introverts and don't even realize it. I'm not basing introverts on this article at all really but just because introverts may prefer to live in the mountains doesn't mean they are all going to go move right away just because they tend to like being alone. Dexter has his family and job in Miami and wouldn't want to leave that. He also has his apartment and boat because he has the ""need"" to kill. If he lived in the mountains he may not be able to get the same job or have the same amount of people to take care of. Not to mention once he loses Deb and everything he DOES move to the mountains to be alone. Being an introvert or extrovert is completely normal and some people are more extroverted or introverted than others. An extravert would be more outgoing and expressive which is why Dexter would be an introvert. Understand what I'm saying?  Source: introvert   You could always take a personality test to figure out which one you fall under.  There is also a pretty huge subreddit for it:  /r/introvert"
Dexter,2yef7v,BlindStark,1 point,Tue Mar 10 04:47:01 2015 UTC,"If the writers are trying to paint Dexter as an introvert, or if you, or whomever the viewer may be, are meant to take him for an introvert, then they haven't made him a very believable introvert. He definitely puts on the facade of an extrovert, and leads the life of one. I'd say a true introvert wouldn't be able to do that for very long without developing some sort of schizophrenia or dual personality disorder. I'm not a psychologist, but I imagine it would tear a person a part. Obviously, he eventually breaks after season 8, and his need to kill is part of his coping mechanism, but it's all because he's conflicted. I mean, really, he'd probably be a lot different if he weren't basically conditioned into being a serial killer. I've always kind of appreciated that as part of the tragedy of the story; that Dexter was essentially made into something he's not and has to live a lie. But all in all, he doesn't come off as a believable introvert to me."
Dexter,2yef7v,Presto-Manifesto,1 point,Tue Mar 10 05:10:59 2015 UTC,"He is an introvert which is why most of the people on this sub actually relate with him. He definitely DOES NOT lead the life of an extrovert. The only person in his life he is even close to is Deb. Dexter is the furthest thing from an extrovert. He is not very outgoing or expressive at all. You realize being an introvert doesn't mean he can't talk to people right? He has a whole bunch of awkward moments and tries to fit in. Being an introvert isn't a personality disorder and is not going to give him schizophrenia that's just ridiculous. He isn't even that social at all? If Dexter was really an extrovert he'd have plenty of friends, go out to parties, and have an easier time connecting with people which is definitely not the case. Being an introvert is just a personality trait not a disorder. I wouldn't go by season 8 at all since the show gets new writers and pretty much destroys everything that Dexter was anyway. I don't think you understand what an introvert really is. I don't see how anyone could possible call him an extrovert.  Another famous introvert INTJ would be the serial killer Hannibal Lecter. Go look up what an introvert is because it's not a disability and a large majority of the people on Earth are introverted. If you have seen Michael C. Hall in any other shows you'd actually see him talking a lot more and showing a lot of emotion, the complete opposite of how Dexter acts."
Dexter,2yef7v,BlindStark,1 point,Tue Mar 10 12:30:56 2015 UTC,"Doesn't he want that stuff though? Doesn't he really feel like that on the inside? You can't possibly say he's full on introvert. I never said being an introvert was a disorder. I just don't think a person with a truly, fully, introverted personality would be able to ""hide in plain sight"" like he does, especially when you apply that personality type to what he does: kill people--a lot of people, and quite often. Given the context of being a habitual murderer, I think a person with that personality type wouldn't be able to form a whole lot of contacts with other people at all, whether those interactions are real or fake. Just because I'm saying I don't find it believable that would be able to maintain himself in the many extroverted social interactions he has, and yes I understand he fakes them, (examples: that stupid-ass high school reunion, reaching out to people that he wants to kill, meeting all his new neighbors) doesn't mean you have to assume I'm saying he has a disability. Besides, carrying out his idea of justice, thinking his moral code is better than the law that says it's immoral to kill is an extroverted way of thinking, and that's the core of the show and his character. Also, a truly introverted serial killer-type wouldn't be able to go through college up through grad school. There's no way he'd last long without getting found out or breaking mentally. Sure his emotional responses are inward, but he also claims to have no emotions whatsoever. So I don't know, take that as a consistency error in terms of the writing for his character, but based on that and not how a real life introvert would behave, I'd still say he leans more on the side of extroverted. Certainly he is not unarguably introverted. You'd just have to be plain stubborn not to see that much. As a serial killer and an introvert, he is not completely believable. I don't know. Categorizing personality types is stupid to begin with. The character is definitely compelling. It's a huge part of what makes me like Dexter; this sort of ambiguity as to which part is real, which part is faked. Now Hannibal Lecter I agree is more of an example of an introvert, but again, not fully. He reaches out to people to get into their heads. His whole thing is manipulation."
Dexter,2yef7v,Presto-Manifesto,1 point,Wed Mar 11 05:29:39 2015 UTC,"Being an introvert actually helps him be a serial killer because it keeps people at a distance. He doesn't get very close to people so they can't really find out who he is. Dexter doesn't have that many extroverted experiences at all and when he does he usually finds it awkward or doesn't want to go. An introvert can still talk and meet many people and go to parties all the time, it's not going to be that big of a deal. Both introverts and extroverts could have his sense of justice. I don't see why he couldn't get through grad school as long as he didn't get caught. Obviously it's a tv show but there are plenty of serial killers that went through school in real life and probably more that were never even caught. I don't see why he would break mentally at all unless he has other mental problems. If he's just a ""sociopath"" and lacks emotion then killing people isn't going to bother him in any way. It's no different than going out and hunting deer or any other animal. Most people aren't pure introvert or extrovert they just swing more heavily to one side. The definition of extrovert is being outgoing and overly expressive, the life of the party. This doesn't fit Dexter at all. He isn't only an introvert though he most likely has antisocial personality disorder. Hannibal reaching out to people doesn't mean he's extroverted. An introvert can talk to people and go to parties every day and still be an introvert."

For television viewing purposes, Harry is portrayed by an actual actor that plays a major role so us as viewers can have a deeper understanding of the characters. We don't really know Harry, except through flashbacks. We just know Harry as Dexter saw him. (In my mind, there are two different Harrys) Of course the conversations seem genuine to us, because they seem genuine to Dexter. And during the entire series, we're inside of his mind.  Unless you believe that Harry's an actual ghost talking to Dexter himself... It kind of reminds me of Hamlet."
Dexter,2y7bo6,usbsticksarefun,5,Sat Mar 7 03:43:05 2015 UTC,"I guess the way I've always interpreted ImaginHarry is that Dexter feels like he is a monster, and over time the only part of his self that is truly his is the Dark Passenger. You know how he talks about himself; how he isn't human. I think that Dexter uses Harry as his 'human' brain. I think it began with him wondering what Harry would say in this or that situation, and after Dexter let some terrible things happen/did some terrible things, he could no longer accept that any part of himself could be human and only what Harry said could humanize him. In this way, Dexters subconscious human side could 'manipulate' what Harry says... Dexter just can't come to terms with the fact that he himself might consider something in a 'human' fashion, only 'Harry' can."
Dexter,2y7bo6,MastahShake_____2,3,Sat Mar 7 03:43:16 2015 UTC,"harry was just a device to give structure to the dialogue in dexter's head. having dexter sitting in room talking to himself would make it harder for the viewer to relate to him.   i know people always slag on the writers of the show, and when i say this it's not meant as disparaging, but had there been a group of people who could delve in to what it was that made dexter tick Showtime could have truly had something brilliant on their hands.   over these 8 years we got to see this guy run the greatest con one could ever imagine and no one ever thought about exploring this creature in the shadows that was going to such great lengths to keep itself hidden from the world.   imagine scenes with dex and harry written through the eyes of an actual behavioral/criminal psychologist? people with honest to goodness insight to people like dexter?  showtime could have created another hannibal lecter, instead they came up with a better dressed jason vorhees pretending he was batman."
Dexter,2y7bo6,WH1SKEYHANGOVER,2,Sat Mar 7 05:46:13 2015 UTC,Part of me liked to believe that Harry existed in some way...idk wishful thinking maybe

Dexter,2y13ln,EFC_UK,-13,Thu Mar 5 16:35:37 2015 UTC,Episode 15 now. But the way he purses his lips and his other facial expressions I just feel like the actor himself is trying too hard and it's coming off as bad acting to me.

Dexter,2y13ln,nuggetinabuiscuit,1 point,Thu Mar 5 15:51:18 2015 UTC,Characters have to have specific characteristics that make them appealing or unlikeable.  Doakes for some reason is seen on both sides of the spectrum.    He has the ultimate type A personality towards Dexter with a large mix of anger and aggression.

Dexter,2xvdso,NewsonLAD,1 point,Thu Mar 5 15:25:44 2015 UTC,"First, I honestly didn't give a shit if Dexter got away with it - kind of Silence of the Lambs style. He's smart enough to figure out  way. But I always thought it would be interesting if the last season flipped the script and Dexter became the ""big bad"" for the season. There's always some kind of main bad guy, so what if Dexter was being tailed by someone and they slowly built the case against him and put him in the actualized situation of being caught... Then fake his death after that. Something that made sense as a whole rather than all the new deadend subplots..."
Dexter,2xvdso,REMAIN_IN_LIGHT,1 point,Fri Mar 6 04:41:29 2015 UTC,"My wish is that Deb caught Dex at the end of five instead of six. They were definitely laying down the ground work for it--my guess is that was the plan but Showtime made them pull back and delay it a year because they knew it lead to their ""end game.""   So season six would become more like what we got in season 7. LaGuerta is on to Dexter and Deb decides to help him avoid getting caught but has the same struggle with helping him and allowing him to continue to fight his urges.   The show ends in the shipping container with Dex, Deb and LaGuerta-- Deb has to make a choice. BANG. Cut to black. It holds, much like it did in the finale, and we fade back in, and (maybe this is too similar, but maybe it makes more sense this time) Dexter is alive, Deb shot LaGuerta and we get a prologue where Dexter agreed to leave Miami with Harrison, so Deb doesn't have to live with knowing he's actively killing in the city where she is supposed to catch killers. And we kind of end on a more positive inner monologue similar to season 1.  Six tight seasons--no ridiculous Dooms Day Killer or boring season 8, and Dexter gets punished so to speak, by being banished by Deb? I don't know, I'm not sure about it either, I think it could be interesting.Unless people prefer that Dex died, then you could leave it open ended, maybe she killed him maybe not, or we see her kill him. I didn't mind him relocating, but it was handled so shitty."
Dexter,2xvdso,welshwordman,0,Wed Mar 4 15:59:44 2015 UTC,"My favorite alternate ending is that after Deb dies, Dexter turns himself in. Flash forward to Dexter strapped down to a table, waiting to get a lethal injection. Dexter imagines all of his victims watching him die, like he did to them."

Dexter,2xnu8p,lampdude,41,Mon Mar 2 12:19:08 2015 UTC,"Anyone who thinks Dexter being a father makes him a sympathetic character is kinda missing the point of the show.    He regularly leaves his kids (if you count Rita's kids as well) to go murder people, because he enjoys murdering people.    He is a bad father, and a bad human being.    But probably a pretty good lumberjack."
Dexter,2xnu8p,Kinetic_Card,7,Mon Mar 2 15:09:10 2015 UTC,"In the finale flashback when he's holding Harrison, he mentions he doesn't even know how to raise kids. This is in spite of the fact the clip comes between season 3 and 4 where he's already been raising Astor and Cody for years. So forgetting your stepchildren and forgetting your actual child weren't a stretch for him. Bad dad, bad writing."
Dexter,2xnu8p,LeeCarvallo,2,Mon Mar 2 18:12:40 2015 UTC,"He's definitely a terrible father and person, and I don't doubt that he forgot about the kids, Jamie, and Rita, but if it wasn't integral to the story line to have him text or phone to say he wasn't coming home, I'm sure the writers just skipped over it."
Dexter,2xluvj,4skindeposit,15,Sun Mar 1 22:48:29 2015 UTC,"This show really illustrates how normal Dexter really is- and how much of his idea of his own condition comes solely from what he was told as a kid about his condition.    He read lots of books about serial killers as a child, and thus believed that everything said about them applied to him, and adapted his life to those imaginary rules. He was told, ""you will someday have urges to kill people,"" and then he developed urges to kill people. He was told, ""you don't understand emotion the same way we do,"" and so he believed that the rest of the world understood emotions differently than him.    In some way, Dexter very well may have been a serial killer whose condition was constructed entirely from the placebo effect."
Dexter,2xluvj,falcon4287,2,Mon Mar 2 05:37:15 2015 UTC,"I know I've heard this idea before somewhere, but the way you said it really just set it in there. I always figured that throughout the show he wasn't as much of a psychopathic serial killer as he thought he was. It seemed that the only reason he didn't feel love as strongly with Rita was only because he convinced himself that he couldn't and had believed that his entire life. It's an underlying theme throughout the show but never really gets said as well as you said it."

I think that Dexter disappearing from the life of everyone he once cared about made sense, seeing as he either ended or ruined the life of everyone around him... But dumping Deb in the ocean?  Telling his kid to expect to see him again some day (at the bus station) and then disappearing forever?  Elway takes a nap?  The biggest BS moment of that episode for me was Dexter's jail cell bic pen shanking of Oliver Saxon though.  Completely contrived, and just silly."

Dexter,2x94a3,CHICKENFORGIRLFRIEND,2,Thu Feb 26 22:41:22 2015 UTC,"Well, most of the regulars already gave their opinion on this subject and the number of newcomers is steadily declining, so you have to dig deeper these days.  For example here's mine, from quite a long time ago.  And you could find a lot of stuff in the episode discussion threads and other threads around the time the final season was aired.

Dexter,2x9pft,ralphwiggumdude,8,Thu Feb 26 20:10:24 2015 UTC,probably would've kept him busier than being in forensics. He would be working cases 24/7 instead of being called in and doing lab work. Plus he was able to run DNA tests to make sure people met the code on the down low.

Dexter,2x3x9c,knifebaum,8,Wed Feb 25 13:21:54 2015 UTC,Deb would love that.
Dexter,2x4tlj,XiViTioN,3,Wed Feb 25 17:50:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you pretty much gotta it. The show as stated a few times by the producers is about him developing real feelings but them realizing that he doesn't really want it, and you can get that when he said  “As much as I may have pretended otherwise, for so long all I’ve wanted was to be like other people, to feel what they felt… Now that I do, I just want it to stop.” And I actually think many people missed it, there's lots of complains about how Dexter changed in the last 2 seasons which it was actually something that would happen eventually. Although, don't think someone is not a psycho just because they show emotion, psychos lack emotion, they can have it, and when they do, it's usually superficial, but not necessarily. But if his an actual psycho, I dunno, but it's obvious he have some kind of social disorder."
Dexter,2x4tlj,TheMasterWeasel,2,Wed Feb 25 19:17:52 2015 UTC,Well I mean he's been taught that he has no feelings and when he realises that he does it's confusing for him. I don't think he's a pchychopath but hes probably suffering from something that surpresses his feelings combined with his own subconsiousness.
Dexter,2x4tlj,Presto-Manifesto,1 point,Thu Feb 26 00:42:24 2015 UTC,"I think he genuinely has no feelings in the beginning, and as the story goes on, he starts to develop them. The way the writers do it feels kind of forced/cheesy sometimes, so it's hard to tell just to what extent he has feelings. So I think it's because of all these murders he's committed while operating under the idea that he has no feelings that we get the ending we got, as he was starting to develop feelings towards the end. It could have been good, but it was just executed poorly."
Dexter,2x4tlj,Presto-Manifesto,1 point,Fri Feb 27 03:24:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I mean when I compare him to Walter White AKA Heisenberg whom starts of as a normal guy but later on looses his value of human life, as Dexter starts as a ""Psychopath"" and then developes feelings, the only thing I don't get is, the part that define a Psychopath is that they miss some links in the brain (not taking this from the last season of the series.) and IF he was a psycho from the start it would mean he didnt have those links or as they call it in the series (I don't know if it's the same irl can't bother to look it up at the moment) or the anterior midcingulate cortex, so he shouldn't be able to develope feelings even less Empathy as he shows towards Deb, Hannah and his son Harrison.   There's alot of holes in this series mainly caused by season 8 where personally I think they should've just gone with Hannah being locked up and or on the run instead of making her appear just because they favored Yvonne Strahovski's appearance in the series. And even more they should've stayed away from the ending which closes up 0 loose ends and answers no questions at all."
Dexter,2x4tlj,foscodeepdelver,1 point,Fri Feb 27 14:30:39 2015 UTC,"Well actually, a big part of it I left out of what I said earlier. I think he has no feelings in the beginning, genuinely, because he was essentially made into a serial killer. He was taught a code by his father on how to live with being a killer. He is a regular human biologically (I don't really believe in that thing with the brain you're saying). In other words, he could have been normal the whole time had he not been conditioned to be a killer. He begins to realize this on his own towards the end of the series. It's a sad story really but awesome because of how tragic it is. Him trying to embrace being a human is what sort of ruins everything for him. Just like how you compare how Walter White's spiral out of normalcy brings him down as well.   I'm not into fanfiction whatsoever, but I'm writing one right now that explains the underlying causes of how Dexter was made into what he is. It should make the tragedy of his story hit even harder while at the same time explain the ending the series gives us, and also make it less bitter. It's about his dad, Harry, and what happens with him that leads to the events of Dexter. https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10983790/1/The-Saga-of-Big-Harry"
Dexter,2x4tlj,Presto-Manifesto,2,Sat Feb 28 00:58:30 2015 UTC,"I think his need to kill was real but that it could get supresses by having something stronger than his need to kill, which is being with hannah"
Dexter,2x5ald,welshwordman,2,Wed Feb 25 19:52:57 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't want any hallucinations or 'ghosts'. They were fine in season 3 when they were very rare, but then season 4 and onward took it to an extreme I really didn't like. It felt too cheesy and was just a lazy way to create exposition. There are countless scenes that would have been more powerful if we had just seen Dexter by himself, with only himself to keep him company, but then Harry pops his head around the corner and it just ruins it."
Dexter,2x5ald,Chalky97,1 point,Wed Feb 25 23:07:25 2015 UTC,so I take it you wouldn't be interested in seeing Deb return in a similar capacity?
Dexter,2x5ald,Chalky97,1 point,Wed Feb 25 23:59:36 2015 UTC,"No not really, I don't think the actress would either after wanting her character to die for so long"
Dexter,2x5ald,Presto-Manifesto,1 point,Thu Feb 26 07:39:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with you there; she did seem pretty over it. But as far as the ghost thing: I think a big part of the series was him relying on those disembodied manifestations of his own intuition in the form of his father's ghost. Maybe that can come in a different form, but I think that's part of Dexter's character, communicating with that opposing voice in his head. Although I think he would have evolved into someone who is very sure of himself and wouldn't need to rely on the ghosts of his loved ones telling him what to do in a plot that happened after the finale."

It would also allow Dexter to be killed as the possible sequel, well, isn't 'Dexter' anymore."

Dexter,2x07ft,Slaytounge,0,Tue Feb 24 22:38:01 2015 UTC,I loved Miguel actually. And what was wrong with Hannah? I thought the actress did a great job.
Dexter,2x07ft,crackalac,4,Wed Feb 25 04:25:08 2015 UTC,What was wrong with Hannah? Umm she was one of the biggest reasons season 8 sucked. Easily the worst love interest he had and somehow she got 2 seasons and was involved in the finale plot.
Dexter,2x07ft,matty25,4,Wed Feb 25 13:46:20 2015 UTC,"Hannah was terrible.  Her character added some of the most poorly conceived writing in the whole series. From Dexter boning her instead of killing her to the whole Dexter Jr. Treadmill incident and her as a wanted fugitive taking him to a public hospital, her entire character represented what was so awful about the final seasons."
Dexter,2x07ft,thekalby,7,Wed Feb 25 20:46:09 2015 UTC,I guess I'm the only one who though season 6 was better than 5...

Dexter,2x07ft,thekalby,2,Wed Mar 4 00:08:12 2015 UTC,Sometimes I feel like the only one that didnt see that twist coming. I think people who watched season 6 when it was on probably read reddit and message boards where they got the idea. I can totally see how the seasons would be ruined for you knew if you knew that twist early on.

Dexter,2x07ft,gadesxion,2,Tue Feb 24 18:41:42 2015 UTC,what makes S8 so bad?
Dexter,2x07ft,matty25,5,Tue Feb 24 18:53:13 2015 UTC,It seems like they set up a lot of cool stuff for it in season 7.. And then they junk it all and pull some unrelated shit out. I'm not even going to bother talking about the ending. All in all a disgrace after it seemed like the show was redeeming itself after a solid season 7.
Dexter,2x07ft,matty25,3,Wed Feb 25 00:20:39 2015 UTC,"It seems like they set up a lot of cool stuff for it in season 7. And then they junk it all and pull some unrelated shit out.   Lol I agree, they completely overturn the great buildup of Season 7 by scrapping it with a voiceover within the first 2 minutes of Season 8. Such horseshit."
Dexter,2x07ft,neo7,6,Wed Feb 25 20:51:03 2015 UTC,"Everything. I honestly thought it was so bad that it stains the entire show and has made it go from ""my favorite show ever"" status to just one of my favorite shows among many. It really is that bad."
Dexter,2x07ft,Froggypwns,3,Tue Feb 24 18:59:57 2015 UTC,It starts off not so bad with the first episode and then it went just downhill. And the finale (last scenes in particular) is an insult
Dexter,2x07ft,crackalac,2,Tue Feb 24 22:37:09 2015 UTC,"I have no idea what went wrong, but it went from being a great show to ""what the fuck is this shit?"" in a blink of an eye.  I feel seasons 1 - 7 were great. Some parts better than others, but all enjoyable, then 8 feels like it was written during the 2007 writers strike.  That said, watch it anyway, you might as well see how the series ends."
Dexter,2x07ft,npotash,0,Tue Feb 24 22:59:41 2015 UTC,I would swap 3 and 6 on that but otherwise I agree.
Dexter,2x07ft,keigums,8,Tue Feb 24 22:11:03 2015 UTC,"Seasons 1-4 are pretty consistent and well-written, but season five began a bad trend of having season finales which dismissed the rest of the season. Dexter effectively turns into an unstoppable superhero and the writing really goes downhill to the point that entire characters are introduced for no apparent reason and then discarded. Some people have found stuff to love in the later seasons, but as someone who really enjoyed 1-4, I would have been happier if I had stopped after the season premiere of 5."
Dexter,2x07ft,keigums,10,Tue Feb 24 17:13:10 2015 UTC,"Don't just stop watching it based on other redditors saying they don't like the seasons. Just because others don't like some seasons, doesn't mean you won't love it."
Dexter,2x07ft,thekalby,1 point,Tue Feb 24 19:12:45 2015 UTC,Very true. I love it too much to stop
Dexter,2x07ft,Starburstnova,3,Tue Feb 24 19:14:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah I never understood questioning whether to stop watching something based on bad reviews, I always need closure at the end of a series."
Dexter,2x07ft,pfool,3,Tue Feb 24 19:22:44 2015 UTC,"Season 1, 2,4, and 7 are considered the best usually (not necessarily in that order). No question the first 4 seasons are better than the later 4, but I still enjoyed seasons 6 and 7. I felt like season 5 went nowhere though, and season 8 was just shit in the later half. Most people think 6 was pretty bad too, but I kinda liked it. The general criticism of the later seasons is Dexter gets stupid and too careless, I definitely hear that but it wasn't as bad as most fans make it out to be. Another general criticism is the plot starts focusing on a few subplots that go nowhere, instead of only on Dexter like in the earlier seasons. This is much more substantiated, and something that gets kinda irritating later on.   All together an excellent show and I have no regrets about watching all 8 seasons. Really one of my top 5 favorite tv shows of all time, in terms of main characters could even be my favorite. Deb and Dexter and so great and their relationship and individual personalities never gets old.  Ignore anybody who tells you seasons 5-8 are bad, still excellent seasons of TV, just don't compare to some other seasons of Dexter."
Dexter,2x07ft,Leumas_Loch,3,Tue Feb 24 17:17:14 2015 UTC,"Yes you should absolutely bother. If you enjoy the show, you should follow through. You might not enjoy it AS much, but you'll still enjoy it.  Personally, I love season 5. It starts slow dealing with the end of season 4, but once it gets into it, I think the villain(s) of season 5 are by far the creepiest.  The biggest change is that the plots aren't as thoroughly planned out, and there's less humor.  My biggest issue with the later seasons (7-8 mostly) is just the wasted potential. The had opportunities for storylines that they didn't take that would have been fantastic.  So basically, the later seasons are still good overall, but by the standards set from the earlier seasons they can be a little disappointing. Mostly I was just disappointed with the ending."
Dexter,2x07ft,faeried,3,Tue Feb 24 18:22:23 2015 UTC,"1,2,3 and 4. amazing. downhill from there."
Dexter,2x07ft,Aluxh,2,Tue Feb 24 22:12:43 2015 UTC,Season 8 was the biggest nosedive in quality I have ever witnessed in a TV series. It also didn't help that the final season of dexter and breaking bad were airing at the same time and every week I was reminded what good television looked like. I remember going to the breaking bad subreddit and there would be like tens of thousands or responses in their discussion thread while dexter had like 50 responses. No one was watching season 8 live it got so bad.   Overall the ranking in the top comment is exactly how I'd rank them as well.

Yeah, although it seems like a huge dip after the best season, season 4. After that the quality keeps dropping but it's still watchable."
Dexter,2x07ft,Jaesos,1 point,Tue Feb 24 21:03:00 2015 UTC,"Watch it for yourself, but they aren't very good in comparison and the ending will leave your soul feeling empty for at least a week."

Dexter,2wximn,TheMasterWeasel,2,Wed Feb 25 16:10:45 2015 UTC,"Does that include all seasons? cuz it never tires for me either, but there's a lot of people that keep complaining about later seasons and if you do watch from S1 - S8, that's something rare around here. Which is actually shameful, season 8 can be worst than others but doesn't make it bad."
Dexter,2wximn,welshwordman,1 point,Wed Feb 25 17:15:21 2015 UTC,"They break down differently because of how they aired, so I saw seasons 1-4 twice before season 5 aired.  Season 1: Six Seasons 2-4: Five times  Season 5: Three times Season 6 & 7: Twice Season 8: Once"

Dexter,2wximn,Zhurial,1 point,Tue Feb 24 18:43:55 2015 UTC,"You could argue that dexter thought Dorsey was Travis, but he still didn't verify that it was him.  It was impulsive.    The other guy though...that was brutal.  Death by boat anchor"
Dexter,2wximn,Jakethrowsdwn,1 point,Wed Feb 25 16:23:32 2015 UTC,"Impeccable logic. If memory serves, I believe it was after Dexter realized that it wasn't Travis that he killed when he says ""Who are you?""   And yes, that boat anchor murder is amongst my favorite kills."
Dexter,2wx4wc,Acedeh,15,Mon Feb 23 22:18:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the idea he's just sitting at home doing nothing just doesn't work. He freaks out when he can't kill, that shit doesn't just leave you. He's reverted back to killing small animals I bet."
Dexter,2wx4wc,Slaytounge,9,Mon Feb 23 22:33:41 2015 UTC,"Your comment makes me so sad, to think of Dexter like that. It really angers me how they fucked up the final season so much."
Dexter,2wx4wc,serial_shitlord,1 point,Mon Feb 23 23:38:04 2015 UTC,Think of it as him just hunting so he has good to survive.
Dexter,2wx4wc,soapbutt,3,Tue Feb 24 07:24:58 2015 UTC,I bet he's in Alaska killing people that come in on cruises and everyone just assumes they fell overboard
Dexter,2wx4wc,maegan0apple,3,Mon Feb 23 23:41:35 2015 UTC,"My perspective would be that at the start of the show, Dexter was emotionless. During the seasons he slowly starts having real feelings and he didin't kill Saxon at first because he felt he doesn't need anymore. Then he blamed himself for the death of Deb and decided to not fuck up the rest of the people he loves."
Dexter,2wx4wc,IncineratuZ,1 point,Tue Feb 24 17:02:23 2015 UTC,"Neither do I, I was only joking. He's killing people and I won't accept any other answer even if the writers try and give me one."
Dexter,2wx4wc,Slaytounge,11,Wed Feb 25 04:21:17 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure he'd have less people around, and that means less people to hide with and less people to hunt.   My thoughts:   He'd move to somewhere not far from a city - Anchorage is a large city,  Fairbanks and Juno have populations over 10,000 - those are the three best options. I figure instead of a boat and a bay, it'd be a truck/snowmobile and bears.   Mountain View, Fairview, Spenard, and Russian Jack are high crime areas (Suburbs of Fairbanks)  and might be ideal for ""hunting"" since there is already an expectation of murder.  If he's still abiding by Harry's code of ""no innocents"" he'd have to go on what he witnesses on the streets, or scumbags he could find through the FBI/Local Police ""Most Wanted""   If he's abandoned that part of the code altogether (and it doesn't matter who he kills) anyone weak enough to be overpowered or unsavvy enough to let their guard down is a potential victim.   Either way, let's say he has a new local hangout. Carpentier's Cocktail at 335 Boniface Pkwy in Anchorage, Alaska.  He's not far from the Army Base (Fort Richardson) but that's generally a bad bet because they'd be missed. He'd be on the east side of a shitty neighborhood in a grubby little bar where becoming a regular would just mean putting in time.   There's plenty of wilderness, lots of places a body would just go missing.   Only thing is that he'd either have to roofie someone at the bar (dangerous - easy to be caught) or he'd have to overpower them. Not thinking he'd be able to easily get zoo tranquilizers in his position.   Other option: he moves close to one of the popular trails, like the Appalachian trail - there was a (mostly unsuccesful) serial killer there.   The Pacific Northwest, however, has many successful serial killers... and there is the 1200 mile Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail. Their answer to the Appalachian Trail, but in wilder terrain."
Dexter,2wx4wc,use_more_lube,5,Wed Feb 25 04:25:34 2015 UTC,No way he could move back to Miami way to many question that he couldn't answer like where is Harrison and where is Debs body?
Dexter,2wx4wc,Fuzzy-Hat,2,Tue Feb 24 00:03:00 2015 UTC,"Plus things like wondering where he was for x amount of time, or when he became some sort of demigod that could survive driving directly into a hurricane on his boat."
Dexter,2wx4wc,Sideshow_Slob,5,Tue Feb 24 00:44:40 2015 UTC,"Remember that episode where Dexter ran of with imaginary Brian in season 6? For a short period of time the thought crossed his mind that they could keep running, and he would be free to be who he wanted.   When Brian asked where they would go, what did Dexter answer? Oregon. Where did Dexter go after Debra's death? Oregon.  Why? Oregon is known for the high amount of serial killers.  He has cut himself of from anyone else, has a job that leaves close to 0 paper trail, and located himself in a state with a large amount of serial killers. My interpretation of the ending was that Dexter felt so much pain after Debra's death, that he is trying to go back to the way he was before. He is trying to become just a serial killer again and to shut down all of the new emotions he is experiencing, but he can't."
Dexter,2wx4wc,oromiseldaa,2,Fri Feb 27 18:56:11 2015 UTC,I love you for that post <3
Dexter,2wx4wc,WFAlex,2,Thu Feb 26 12:07:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks :)  Dexter is just my absolute favorite show ever, and I liked every season, some more than others of course.  I think by now I've watched it a total of 6-7 times, and the thought that Dexter confines himself to solitude just to be sad doesn't make sense to me. Everytime his world fall out of balance he turns to killing, so I don't see how it is different this time. Especially with the quote ""As much as I may have pretended otherwise, for so long all I wanted was to be like other people. To feel what they felt. But now that I do, I just want it to stop."", it just seems to me that he wants to go back to when he (supposedly) felt no emotions."
Dexter,2wx4wc,oromiseldaa,1 point,Wed Mar 4 11:27:06 2015 UTC,Have watched the whole series 4 or 5 times and still missed the oregon part :(
Dexter,2wx4wc,WFAlex,1 point,Wed Mar 4 13:50:35 2015 UTC,I agree. I think he realized that everything that went wrong happened because he tried to be more human instead of listening to harry and his dark side (not killing trinity immediately etc.)
Dexter,2wx4wc,Freelance_JIDF_Shill,1 point,Wed Mar 4 23:20:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly, however, I do find that it is important to note that he probably will not be able to go back to that point in his life, where he didn't care about anything. What whould probably happen is one of two things.  He starts becomes a more ruthless killer over time, in the hope that the worse he is, the more numb his emotions will be.  Or he will realize it isn't working, and try stop to stop killing. In the case of the second scenario I'm not sure how he would go about this. I think the most likely thing is for him to finally turn himself in and attone for his deeds."
Dexter,2wx4wc,oromiseldaa,1 point,Fri Mar 20 05:58:38 2015 UTC,He could always try to find Hannah. She's not exactly hiding and he has proven himself to be pretty resourceful.
Dexter,2wx4wc,Freelance_JIDF_Shill,2,Fri Mar 20 11:58:18 2015 UTC,"It definitely is a possibility, but it is the most unlikely one to me. The whole reason he dissapeared is because he is afraid of hurting the ones he loves. I don't think he will ever actually go looking for her and Harrison. However, if they were to somehow meet each other again at random, I  believe it would be hard for him to seperate himself again from them."
Dexter,2wx4wc,oromiseldaa,2,Fri Mar 20 14:30:06 2015 UTC,He's sitting there at that table glaring....at you OP.

Dexter,2wx4wc,bufford_tannen,-1,Tue Feb 24 02:28:02 2015 UTC,I always assumed from the finale that he had moved to Canada :) people are so nice he just can't kill them so he just kills animals and makes a good ol living...until there's a crazy Canadian murderer or the loose who he tracks and kills.
Dexter,2wym2h,Vlad67,1 point,Tue Feb 24 05:43:56 2015 UTC,"I haven't really thought about it, but I guess that The Morgans would've been okay. Like, the way that Rita and Dexter's relationship was going before Trinity killed her was on the up.   I think that because he loved Rita and the kids and he was in a happy, family environment (something he never thought possible) he would've lost his dark passenger to kill and become a ""normal"" guy.  But because he was so fucked up by Rita's death, he retreated within himself and distanced himself from his emotions, strengthening the dark passenger's grasp on him.   But Dexter being happy and losing his need to kill may just be wishful thinking on my part."

Instead he gave up on his son and love interest, and that didn't sit well with me.  If the writers had any guts, they would have had Oliver kill Harrison, Deb, and Hannah and make him live with that fact that He can't have it all."
Dexter,2wu3rm,TurboKnoxville,2,Thu Feb 26 17:23:52 2015 UTC,"Did you like the rest of season 8? For most of us who watched as it aired, we had lost hope long before the series finale. After the penultimate episode, I had no hope that they could save this train wreck with one episode. My execrations were so low and the finale didn't even meet those expectations.   The plot holes in the whole Saxon/Hannah/federal Marshall chase were too much to ignore"
Dexter,2wu3rm,Khal-Stevo,2,Mon Feb 23 20:51:17 2015 UTC,"I didn't mind season 8 to be honest, it was still pretty decent to watch, definitely not the best season however.. But the way it all ended just really pissed me off."

My dad told me it doesn't end well for Dexter, so I really assumed Oliver would be his killer. That I think would be much better, with Dexter just gored, maybe missing that empathy lobe of his brain, Hannah possibly on death row. I'm gonna read the books at some point to gain satisfaction. The rest of the season was okay, but I started watching 2 episodes a night rather than my usual 4 or so from s8 ep1."
Dexter,2wu3rm,matty25,0,Fri Feb 27 16:59:46 2015 UTC,Season 8 was a stain on the show's legacy IMO.  It was my favorite show up until then but now I cannot say that anymore.  My guess is Dexter comes back in a spinoff. Michael C. Hall doesn't seem to be getting big roles and he'll make too much money not too. Part of me wants it to happen so the character can have the ending he deserves. But Season 8 was so bad that it's made me not even really care anymore.
Dexter,2wu3rm,Sideshow_Slob,1 point,Sun Mar 1 06:48:44 2015 UTC,"I think Hall isn't getting ""big roles"" because he doesn't want to, he does a lot of Broadway, or have to.  He got in the range of $20-24 million for just the last two seasons of Dexter.  He just seems to be incredibly selective over what he does and I'm purely speculating but I imagine after the reception of the last few seasons, the script and story would have to be phenomenal for him to play Dexter again.  His own words would seem to confirm that:   “It’s very difficult for me to imagine someone coming up with something that is compelling enough for that to be worth doing. I certainly have no interest right now in playing Dexter. You know, some time passes and somebody has some newly imagined landscape for him that I feel is worth exploring, I would perhaps consider it. Beyond that vague notion, I really can’t say, and it’s not something I have any immediate plans to do. He is still alive, but for right now, I’m leaving him in the cabin.”   Money would obviously play a part but if that were the only issue, I would imagine the spinoff would already be in the works."
Dexter,2wtkls,mysteryfluff,3,Mon Feb 23 01:14:59 2015 UTC,"Season 1 is my favourite season and Season 4 is the best season, with 2 then 3 trailing behind 1. Screw the rest of the seasons."
Dexter,2wtkls,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Mon Feb 23 09:52:08 2015 UTC,"The pilot intro wasn't an intro though; it was the episode's name.  The pilot was called Dexter instead of pilot. I fully agree on the music though, I love the S1/early S2 music. So atmospheric.  It's only natural that they faded away though, as the music changed as Dexter did. (S3 friend/family aspect had different music to Trinity and his reign of terror). Just like with S1 and its cool Miami music that was awesome, whereas the S2 music was more ''twangy'' and different types of Miami music as Dexter's situation was so tense. Not to mention ITK's use of ''Born Free'' in the titular episode, as well as the Vera song that Trinity played in ''Lost Boys'' and Dexter played in ''The Getaway.'' I love when the villain uses iconic songs, and it's done right. You can also do it horribly wrong, like in Season 8. I mean fuck, really? You leave Dexter an iPod on a fucking charging station? Season 1 did it with the computer screensaver which was smart, and S4 did it with the vinyl player.  I disagree on the intro though. I think it's my all time favourite, long or not. The GoT intro is long too and it's still awesome. Breaking Bad's is great but it's a bit too short to be counted as the best for me. Better Call Saul's intro is awesome but again short. TWD has a good intro and so does Hannibal/True Detective. But Dexter's surpasses it for me. The double meaning of all the shots, the beautiful cinematography involved, and the face reveal/walk out of the apartment finished off with the ding... perfect.  Off topic but just because I feel like it... again, fuck 5-8 lol."
Dexter,2wtkls,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Wed Feb 25 04:33:13 2015 UTC,"The intro they used in the show was created before they show was put into post-production, they just didn't use it for the pilot. I remember reading this whole thing about the creation process and the storyboard of the intro before it was made. They originally had the logo like DEX|TER and the TER part was upside down. Pretty strange but yeah, each to their own.  The double meanings are that he's doing day-to-day mundane activities and making it look sinister. Tying up is shoes like he's strangling someone, chopping up the red fruit/chopping up people, killing of the mosquito allows for us to relate to him straight off the bat; it's killing, but we all kill insects. It sounds like I'm reaching but the producers themselves have talked about the intro and how all the shots are something normal people do but with a sinister side to them. It was all purposeful. I think this is the site that talks about the intro:  http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/dexter/"

Dexter,2wtkls,sassman93,1 point,Wed Feb 25 05:54:16 2015 UTC,"Season 2 by a hair over Season 1. I think both of those seasons are the only ones where it felt like every episode mattered, though I admit I would have loved to see Dexter having to make the choice of killing Doakes or not.   Lithgow was outstanding in Season 4 and the ending was the most shocking TV moment I've seen, but there were some flaws to that season that are often overlooked because of how good of a villain Trinity was."
Dexter,2wqbev,mapleleafs64,4,Sun Feb 22 04:29:53 2015 UTC,"Ah, the kind of stuff that made this show amazing.  And then S5-8 happened, and the creative team of those seasons had no idea what the character of Dexter was, which spawned bullshit like Dexter fucking a service station worker, killing people (that didn't fit the code) and leaving the body behind and also, not even setting up kill rooms with plastic. Not to mention getting rid of his bloodslides for no reason, considering he kept his kill knives and M99 needles. All leading up to turning a psychopath into a capable-of-emotion human.   Absolute bullshit."
Dexter,2wqbev,Erekt__Butthole,3,Sun Feb 22 05:29:16 2015 UTC,"Dude seasons 5-8 were the transformation of Dexter being human. That's one reason you may not like those seasons. I mean, I obviously agree that the show wasn't as great throughout those seasons, but I still liked them. That's my opinion though. Plus, I don't remember him killing anyone that didn't deserve it in those seasons. If anything, he killed an innocent in season 4. He also left bodies behind throughout the whole series. Remember Benny?"
Dexter,2wqbev,dvfsz,5,Sun Feb 22 07:27:24 2015 UTC,"Those seasons are unlikeable because they don't make sense. If Dexter was humanised, it would be character progression. But they didnt just humanise him, they made him into an incompetent retard. Part of the joy of the first 4 seasons is how you admire Dexter - his cold-hearted efficiency and systematic intelligence is impressive and entertaining.  In later seasons, it's like he doesnt know what the hell he's doing. Maybe he dropped 30 IQ points from the shock of Ritas death. Basically the writers could have given Dexter emotions whilst keeping him intelligent, commanding and impressive. Instead they just used his paper thin ""emotions"" as a lame plot device for him to do completely retarded stuff."
Dexter,2wqbev,theprocrastinator21,6,Sun Feb 22 10:39:48 2015 UTC,"You're 100% correct, it is almost like he lost 30 IQ points. It's almost like the director (or maybe it's in the script) tells MCH to look dumbfounded and stupid, because Dexter even looked stupid at points in 5-8, and it's definitely not due to incompetence on MCH's part because he's a brilliant actor. His interactions and facade went from great, sometimes shaky with Doakes/Quinn to well, almost autistic."
Dexter,2wqbev,Erekt__Butthole,1 point,Sun Feb 22 11:10:32 2015 UTC,"TL;DR an understanding of neuroscience renders your opinion invalid. Dexter should have been expected to live differently with emotions for the same reason you ""cant teach a dog new tricks.""   You're 100% correct, it is almost like he lost 30 IQ points.    Inaccurate, but the impression makes complete sense if you have an understanding of how we humans and our brains develop.   Our brains functions using billions of communication cells called neurons that send signals to each other, communicating messages to send to our bodies and mind; both consciously and unconsciously, like ""breathe,"" or ""I'm hungry,"" or ""hey wasn't that pair of shoes you liked on sale?""   The more repetition you give to an action, idea, belief, etc.. the stronger the connection between the neurons responsible for the mental correlate become. And henceforth the stronger associations and impulses elicited by that strong neuronal connection are.   For example, Michael Jordan practiced his fadeaway jump shot for years, laying down the neuronal foundation for it and reinforcing it every day with practice in the gym. It's why it was practically an unguardable shot.  It's the same reason why the more you practice, the better you get; but also where  ""you can't teach a dog new tricks"" comes from (which isn't completely accurate, but it is very difficult to work against old habits).  Dexter spend the better half of 40 years reinforcing his neuronal connections and drive to kill, and have a life secondary. He was most comfortable, that was his element: relying on logic to fuel his decisions because an event in his childhood stunted his emotional development and influence on his life.   But then Rita happened. And Lila. And Rita again. Her death, and the aftermath with Rita's family; Hannah, and Debra.  Harry never imagined Dexter having those things. Having people in his life who loved him and, especially in the case of people like Lila and Hannah, people who loved him for who he was. Not to mention the benefit of his friends like Bautista and Masuka.  So after around 40 years of sociopathy, all of a sudden the people in his life start to elicit these powerful, primal motivations that he's never felt or dealt with before (even stood on the edge of a building as a teen in an attempt to elicit an emotion of fear and couldn't do it); why wouldn't he have trouble dealing with them? Especially when ""fitting in and being normal"" is what he's wanted his whole life?  It's like when Michael Jordan, as phenomenal as he was at basketball, switched to baseball and was mediocre at best. He had 30 years of neuronal connections reinforced for the basics and intricacies of basketball, which are not the same as what's necessary for baseball, so it's understandable he wasn't as good; despite how athletically gifted he was.  So despite how intelligent Dexter is, asking Dexter to live his life with the influence of emotions after 40 years of ignorance to them is like the aforementioned Jordan analogy, or asking a 50 year old backwoods, 1800s-Disney-Style old southerner to move to San Francisco and not expecting any turbulence whatsoever.  It was a perfect evolution of a character that wanted emotions his whole life, and once he got them had no idea what to do with them and tried his best to live within these new and foreign parameters.  Does it make for a ""less-entertaining-in-the-ways-seasons-1-through-4-of-Dexter-is-entertaining"" series of Dexter? Yes, I personally miss Dexter of seasons 1-4, but that's why they exist for me to watch again if I please. And which is why seasons 5-8 are different, and so for a reason.   Dexter seasons 5-8, imo, are supposed to be uncomfortable because they were extremely uncomfortable for him. We accompanied him on his spiral downward and eventual retribution for his actions. Because, as much as I question some decisions of season 8, Dexter's fate, isolation upstate somewhere, was perfect given his life circumstances.   As much as he can be forgiven for not understanding his emotions, he's still responsible for his actions and his actions directly led to Debra's death: he should have killed Saxon, I don't care if he didn't feel like he ""needed"" to, he should have because it was right. But then again that's why his aforementioned isolation is a perfect sentence for him.   Dexter the series, while varying between highs and lows of entertainment, is a very accurate representation of the human brain behind Dexter, the evolution of said brain, and what that means for the human being and mind under its influence.   He never ""got stupider,"" he just was handed a different tool belt after 40 years with his old one, and expected to be the same."

Dexter,2wiqgt,theyak93,14,Fri Feb 20 05:40:53 2015 UTC,"I believe that Deb's character development after finding out was awkward and painful and heartbreaking. We lost a wonderful character, whose life was turned upside down and mind was turned inside out. It's probably my least favorite part of the series, but now that it happened, that's how it had to go.  To imagine a Deb that is enthused by these killings would be to imagine a different Deb from the rest of the show. Deb is, above all else, genuine, and she respects human life, both traits that would be inverted."
Dexter,2wiqgt,LogicalEmotion7,1 point,Fri Feb 20 08:34:29 2015 UTC,"At that point, she's questioning Dexter's claim to objective logic. If Dexter kills serial killers, he should kill Hannah.   After this point, Deb was very much broken and her moralities were no longer in sync."
Dexter,2wiqgt,LogicalEmotion7,1 point,Sat Feb 21 18:07:29 2015 UTC,"I know. I understand why Deb reacted the way she did. I just kind of would like to see her be more accepting of it. When Hannah gets away with killing Sal Price and Deb calls Dexter telling him to kill her, then she's  on his side a bit. I would have liked to see a little more of that. I think you're right her character development was weird but I think it was so her inevitable death was more of a peaceful release than a brutal murder.  Side  note: I was thinking this since season 1, but I would have liked to see Deb kill Dexter at the end. I thought that was how it was going to end. That or Dexter would put Deb on his table to stop her from stopping him."

The coffin doubles as something else with which you described.

Dexter,2w2h14,ArkhamOrigins,20,Mon Feb 16 11:47:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, the Criminal Minds team usually finds the ubsub because he leaves a trace or taunt the police. The only thing they could really go on is the victims but I think Dexter has enough self control to stop killing while the FBI is in town if needed. They can't investigate for ever."
Dexter,2w2h14,Sakheteu,12,Mon Feb 16 16:00:53 2015 UTC,"Okay. For an edge to BAU, let's set this around the introduction of Lundy. They just found the bodies and can go over the evidence. They would be able to figure out that the unsub owns a boat, and investigate the bodies. If they figured out that Dexter works for the police (due to the manifesto) then Penelope might be able to figure out that the unsub would search for his victims on the computer and trace the searches of identified victims back to Dexter. However, Dexter is normally able to delete these things through sheer luck and timing. Overall, BAU is more competent than Miami metro and might be able to get Dexter, but only at certain seasons where he is already close to getting caught."
Dexter,2w2h14,Hyde-and-seek,3,Mon Feb 16 18:13:19 2015 UTC,I wonder how they never found his hair at any of the crime scenes.

Dexter,2w2h14,WFAlex,1 point,Tue Feb 17 07:12:26 2015 UTC,"Come to think of it, he'd probably just get rid of the evidence anyway."

Dexter,2w2h14,Casanova__,1 point,Thu Feb 19 21:49:48 2015 UTC,"When he stalked his victims the place wasn't wrapped in plastic. He could have left hairs then. About my point earlier, wouldn't they keep dna samples of their forensic investigators in case they accidentally cross contaminate a scene and leave dna, like a hair or something? I get that they're careful, and I know Dexter would just get rid of the evidence. I don't know, that's what I would do if I were in charge of something like that."
Dexter,2w2h14,Presto-Manifesto,1 point,Fri Feb 20 03:41:25 2015 UTC,"Most likely, i'm surprised Miami Metro never caught onto him. I have a feeling the BAU would definitely catch him. But Dex wouldn't go out without a fight. It would probably be one of those two part episodes for CM."

Dexter,2w2h14,Faux_Shaux,0,Mon Feb 16 22:28:25 2015 UTC,I don't really know what Criminal Minds is but I'm pretty sure any detective crew would have zeroed on Dexter.   Looking at security cameras ain't that hard when a professor gets murdered on campus.
Dexter,2w23vm,theyak93,6,Mon Feb 16 08:05:15 2015 UTC,"and not having the urge to kill   I guess I can't see how what he did would do anything to curb his urge to kill. Even before going into isolation he was still a loner. He told his dad as a kid ""I just like being alone"".   Even Dex the lumberjack still has to interact with people though, whether it's his boss or coworkers or whoever he sells lumber to, or whatever the fuck he's doing. We last saw him as a tree killer, I doubt the animals around are safe either.  Leaving Harrison the way he did was just fucked up. Yes staying away from him makes sense, but shipping him off to another continent with a serial killer and just trusting Hannah will want to raise Harrison without Dexter? And even if she did raise him, he's been uprooted and denied the chance of being raised by ""normal"" people, largely increasing his chances of trauma and possibly becoming a killer himself."
Dexter,2w23vm,teeohhem,1 point,Mon Feb 16 18:59:35 2015 UTC,"Throughout the end of season 8 he says he lost the urge to kill and at some points doesn't kill the person on the table because he just wants to be with hannah and Harrison. I think after he kills Deb he has finally lost hope in leaving a normal life with a normal family so he abandons them. I never said he doesn't have to interact with people I said he doesn't have to get close to people, there's a difference between interacting with his boss and having an emotional relationship with someone. As far as calling him a tree killer, that's just ridiculously stupid."
Dexter,2w23vm,JiveTurkey1983,3,Mon Feb 16 20:27:40 2015 UTC,"""Tree killer"" was a joke.  *I'm not questioning he can avoid getting close to people in his situation now - I was just suggesting since he is still around people he would inevitably build up the urge to kill again."
Dexter,2w23vm,acetylawesome,1 point,Mon Feb 16 22:52:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe he won't. Maybe him killing Deb was the end of his dark passenger. That may be lame but that is the feeling I got while watching it. Also it could be like Lumen, after she killed Jordan Chase, I think, she lost the urge. It's just a theory"
Dexter,2w23vm,Presto-Manifesto,2,Tue Feb 17 01:05:16 2015 UTC,"I'm just wanting to delve into it. It's not a bad theory.   I think Lumen got closure in a positive way. Dexter was just destroyed. My impression of the final scene was that Dexter appeared to be in not in a very good place, mainly by the final look in his eyes. To me it looks like a mix of sadness (Dexter tearless sadness of course), and subdued anger/rage."
Dexter,2w23vm,Vlad67,1 point,Tue Feb 17 01:40:22 2015 UTC,I can't say I blame him. He has lost literally everything he has ever cared about and now is forcing himself to live a miserable life without any emotional attachment to anyone.
Dexter,2w23vm,Presto-Manifesto,1 point,Tue Feb 17 02:13:22 2015 UTC,Let's make something clear: He did NOT kill Deb. She died from injuries. He gave her a proper burial.
Dexter,2w23vm,ratbastid,1 point,Sun Feb 22 13:58:19 2015 UTC,"She was brain dead.  Even if she wasn't in a vegetative state,  she'd have severe mental disabilities.  The Deb he knew died after her stroke.     Also, if Dexter did disappear,  who would make decisions involving her medical care?  All she had left was Quinn who was just her boyfriend.   Would they make her a ward of the state and keep her alive on a ventilator the rest of her life?  Fitting the last kill he did was a mercy kill."
Dexter,2w23vm,rhcp88,1 point,Fri Mar 13 13:28:21 2015 UTC,So unplugging her from life support wasnt killing her?... I bet you believe Kevorkian did nothing wrong too don't you?

Dexter,2w23vm,greyspatter,3,Sat Mar 14 00:27:11 2015 UTC,"I totally get what they were trying to do with the ending. I can even go as far as to say I like it; well, I like the idea, but the execution was just sorta lazy. There were much better ways they could have gone and probably gotten a better-received ending but I like what they tried to do. I know they wanted the viewer to feel empty and sad, but without resolution--that's just sloppy storytelling. They say they don't want to do a continuation of Dexter, so I don't get my hopes up, but there's so much potential for continued material, and besides that, a need for a better conclusion to this story. Dexter isn't rid of his Dark Passenger, it's more like he's become it now. He may think he's rid of it, but it's all he has left. With nothing to lose essentially, it begins to consume him and I think there's a lot that can happen in the process of that."
Dexter,2w0bm8,ArkhamOrigins,4,Sun Feb 15 21:37:21 2015 UTC,"Another interesting connection is when Dexter is talking to Walter Kenny(Tooth Fairy), Kenny says that all serial killers end up the same: alone and isolated from the rest of the world. Look how Dexter ended up."

Dexter,2vzoz4,crackalac,9,Sun Feb 15 22:35:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, honestly the only seasons I didn't like were 3 and 8."
Dexter,2vzoz4,Slaytounge,8,Sun Feb 15 18:39:45 2015 UTC,"Unpopular opinion: I love season 3. The friend/apprentice aspect was great and well executed, I really liked seeing Dexter being able to reveal things about himself to someone and not immediately kill them and it was way more interesting than Lumen. Miguel going from ""friend"" to foe was also great, how many times have we seen Dexter betrayed, tricked, and used so incredibly? Then the game of chess they play at the end, trying to gain the upper hand on each other while still acting like gentlemen, until Miguel crosses the line and Dexter decides to kill him. Their encounter on the roof is one of my favorite scenes in the show. Lastly the music. The music in season 3 had a more like cuban sound to it that reflected the tone of the season and it added a lot to the atmosphere of the show.  Besides The Skinner, I don't find anything particularly bad about season 3 and is on par with 1,2, and 4 in my opinion. And it's not like The Skinner was the actual big bad of season 3 so he didn't have to be fleshed out that much, but a bit more character depth would have been nice."
Dexter,2vzoz4,CyanPancake,2,Sun Feb 15 19:32:24 2015 UTC,"It's funny; if Miguel killed LaGuerta, Debra wouldn't have to."
Dexter,2vzoz4,crackalac,3,Sat Feb 21 11:51:07 2015 UTC,I'm just the opposite. I didn't mind the skinner. I actually liked lumen and season five. I hated the Miguel dynamic.

Dexter,2vzoz4,xcompanioncube,1 point,Sun Feb 15 21:42:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just saw that and I understand where you're coming from. But I don't really see where they could take it, Dex would've just killed him anyway..."

Dexter,2vyaws,Subulie3,10,Sun Feb 15 10:12:13 2015 UTC,"Avoid this sub for spoilers. Otherwise, the popular notion is the show is amazing till season 4 ends.

Some of the plot twists in the second to last season got my heart pumping the most. Form your own opinions and enjoy!   After Dexter I definitely recommend these tv shows on Netflix as well: House of Cards, Sons of Anarchy, Orange is the New Black, Breaking Bad, and Sherlock. Happy watching!"

Jennifer Carpenter's acting throughout blew me away. Last four seasons, regardless of what others might say on this sub, are worth it for her acting alone (but believe me there are other great performances and other plot twists and turns that make it worthwhile )."
Dexter,2vyaws,BlackCatScott,1 point,Sun Feb 15 15:37:30 2015 UTC,Season 1-4 is definitely the best the show has to offer. After that it gets really inconsistent but I still loved a lot of moments right up until the end of Season 7. The final season was a huge let down.
Dexter,2vyaws,falcon4287,1 point,Thu Feb 19 13:54:14 2015 UTC,"If you liked the first season enough to want to go into season 2, then you should stick out even the crappy seasons that are to come later. Ultimately, it's worth it for the closure. I also agree that this sub, because of how long the show has been over for, can inadvertently lead to spoilers.    Since this is a no-spoiler thread, no one touch that statement with a 10-foot pole, please. I completely understand the irony of my statement."
Dexter,2vyaws,Meior,1 point,Sun Feb 15 08:58:24 2015 UTC,What is crappy or not is subjective. This sub needs to stop basically brainwashing new viewers with that the later seasons are shit. Let them decide that for themselves.
Dexter,2vyaws,falcon4287,3,Sun Feb 15 16:15:58 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'll agree to that. However, you have to admit that some seasons are not as good as others. The earlier seasons may or may not be the better ones, but as with any TV show, there are good and bad seasons. Doctor Who, for example, has gone to such shit that I had to take a step back and actually re-evaluate the entire show and have now stopped watching it. Once I no longer had any investment in the characters, I really started deconstructing the plot and concepts of the show and realized that it was not even sci-fi.    Dexter has some low points, but it never got so low that I wanted to quit watching. I didn't think the ending was terrible, and in fact really liked it, although I wasn't a fan of the last season as a whole. That happens in shows, and it doesn't detract from the overall feel and result of what the show portrays."
Dexter,2vyaws,Meior,1 point,Sun Feb 15 17:10:48 2015 UTC,"Of course all series have better and worse seasons. That doesn't mean good and bad.   I never thought the seasons were so bad that I had to go on the sub and profess how shitty they are every single chance I get. I'm not saying you are, but many are. Every. Single time. there is discussion, someone has to comment on the later, absolutely sucky, seasons. Let people decide on their own. It's getting old."
Dexter,2vyaws,falcon4287,3,Sun Feb 15 17:13:26 2015 UTC,"Perhaps its because the first four seasons were just so damn good. Except I didn't care for season 2 as much as some others do.    None the less, you're right, I didn't start thinking about the final season being ""bad"" until after I got on this sub.    There's a lot to that ""fans are the harshest critics"" thing."
Dexter,2vyaws,Meior,0,Sun Feb 15 17:20:49 2015 UTC,"Exactly.   Some seasons are better than others, and it varies from person to person because we appreciate different things. I thought Trinity wasn't an all too interesting serial killer for example, and Miguel was just annoying. Others may think different. It doesn't necessarily mean that the seasons are horrid.   Vogel was rather interesting in my mind for example. I liked the twist and all the information we got about Dexter's young life."
Dexter,2w0uyv,cawnrwoods,4,Mon Feb 16 00:19:33 2015 UTC,So basically you're saying that Dex would just become a normal serial killer?
Dexter,2w0uyv,nuggetinabuiscuit,1 point,Mon Feb 16 00:40:50 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I'd want this but I can see it making sense, as a sequel though, not a prequel. Both their mothers died in a tragic way. But Vera's death is what really destroyed Trinity.   Dexter said in season 4 he'd be lost without Deb. She was his only anchor keeping him attached to humanity. I think he loved Rita, but it's obvious throughout the show Deb is who he cares about most. He's responsible for her death in a similar way Arthur was for Vera's, not their intent but wouldn't have happened without them around.  Unfortunately all we really know is that Dexter survived an apparent suicide attempt and now lives in isolation chopping down trees."
Dexter,2w0uyv,Presto-Manifesto,2,Mon Feb 16 02:04:43 2015 UTC,"I know, the fact that part of Trinity's motivation was because of his sister's death set up as a good parallel to Dexter, showing what he could become if that happened to him. That's why I think Dexter should go on to kill innocents. But I don't know if it would do well as a TV show. It'd be the only way his story could go though."
Dexter,2w0uyv,Presto-Manifesto,1 point,Mon Feb 16 03:12:07 2015 UTC,"Yes. He could totally loose it, kill innocents in a ritualistic way like trinity. My opinion obviously, i think it would be a cool idea for a sequel, regardless of it would make TV or not, etc."
Dexter,2vsv6e,Presto-Manifesto,4,Fri Feb 13 20:23:33 2015 UTC,It's in the Early Cuts episode for Gene Marshall: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Or1EaxLRkM8  I think most people consider it canon since the actors and writers from the tv series were involved in creating it. Plus it was produced by Showtime.
Dexter,2vsv6e,Hrose572,9,Sat Feb 14 02:55:28 2015 UTC,"from the wikia   Dexter reveals a lot of information about the boat in Monkey In a Box when attempting to sell it off to a potential Boat Buyer:  ''She's a 2001 Century 2901 center console. I had this custom rail put in. New paint. Has a radar, GPS, fish-finder, autopilot, emergency life raft. And I had these twin Yamaha 250 four stroke motors put in. They got just over 400 hours, and when you open them up and you're out there...There's nothing like it.""   it doesn't seem to be harry's boat. although, it's possible he's just lying or trying to bolster the sale"
Dexter,2vsv6e,queensavior,12,Fri Feb 13 20:47:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, Dexter inherited it after Harry died. Deb mentions it was the family boat when they were looking at marinas trying to find the Bay Harbor Butcher. Also, I wouldn't be surprised if Harry got the boat in the first place to help Dexter when he started his ""craft."" Obviously it's not unusual for a family in Florida to own a boat, I'm just speculating."
Dexter,2vsv6e,Jakethrowsdwn,12,Fri Feb 13 20:45:02 2015 UTC,No he didn't. It was originally named Slice of Heaven before Dexter bought from a therapist or something as seen in Dexter Early Cuts.
Dexter,2vsv6e,Yallew,5,Fri Feb 13 21:06:10 2015 UTC,"I actually saw this and didn't really know if those Early Cuts episodes were canon or not, so I asked on here. I might have to refer to the episode mentioned above to verify, but thanks to both of you."
Dexter,2vsv6e,Jakethrowsdwn,-2,Fri Feb 13 21:33:08 2015 UTC,"Early Cuts? Do you mean earlier seasons, books, or something else entirely?  Not saying it's not the case, I've just never heard or seen anything regarding it."
Dexter,2vsv6e,Yallew,7,Fri Feb 13 22:05:04 2015 UTC,It's an animated prequel series by Showtime.
Dexter,2vsv6e,Scottiee225,1 point,Fri Feb 13 22:26:12 2015 UTC,"it was shown in the early cuts, that dexter bought the boat off a victim of the Bay Harbour Butcher, Harry could not have bought the boat simply for dexters purpose, because in the pilot episode of dexter, Harry is seen talking to a young dexter on a boat about him killing a neighbours dog, two different boats. hopes this helps"
Dexter,2voyu3,fondeldick,16,Thu Feb 12 21:22:12 2015 UTC,"If they had introduced it earlier and developed it and culminated it appropriately with the revelation of his secret , it could have felt more relevant.  But as for whether it was wrong or surprising I don't think so. Deb just needed someone solid and did crave the companionship of someone like dexter, and no one was like that for her. They aren't blood relatives but she was pushing a delicate boundary and they both knew that. Luckily they didn't have to confront it because she found out his secret"
Dexter,2voyu3,Natezami,4,Thu Feb 12 22:11:03 2015 UTC,"Did she really ever stop feeling that way about him? I don't feel like it's conclusive either way. I always thought it was the primary reason, the only reason, she shot LaGuerta instead of Dexter."
Dexter,2voyu3,coffeeandmuffins,11,Mon Feb 16 00:00:35 2015 UTC,"I actually really enjoyed this development and wasn't as shocked by it as some others. Personally, I think there was buildup to this in Debra's past relationships and her complete fascination with Dexter. I grew to like Deb more than Dexter and thought her character was much more interesting and her story much more tragic than Dexter's. If only they'd used this storyline as an opportunity to develop both of these characters.  The way it was handled was sloppy and awful, though. And to tie a bow on it with a simple ""it's like when you like M&Ms, but shouldn't"" was a fucking crime."
Dexter,2voyu3,elmarko44,4,Thu Feb 12 23:16:37 2015 UTC,"I don't get all of the hate about Deb's ""crush"" on Dex.    I think Deb has a sort of Oedipus complex with Dex - a misplaced and mistaken sense of romantic love.  She never pursues or even entertains a sexual relationship with Dex because she knows that she's really mistaking her strong need to connect with family with being in love.  That's classic Deb, cranking everything up to 11"
Dexter,2voyu3,Cwayon,13,Fri Feb 13 17:47:41 2015 UTC,"I wasn't appalled by it, but I thought it was a dumb and unnecessary plot point that went nowhere. Still, it was pretty cringeworthy for me and seemed out of place so I'm glad that it went nowhere."
Dexter,2voyu3,Raichu93,5,Thu Feb 12 21:43:51 2015 UTC,"However ill-advised, I think there was a reason for this development. It seems like the writers were trying to get the audience used to a muddied Dexter-Debra relationship before they fucked it up for good. But I could just be reading too much in to it.  I do think it came too far out of left field, though."
Dexter,2voyu3,greenblues,5,Thu Feb 12 22:05:02 2015 UTC,"It came out of left field, showing how ill-planned it was, and also was thrown out back into left field just as quickly, showing how shallow it ended up being that they scrapped it by the next season.  It's the kind of subplot where you can practically see the writers discussing it at the table, going ""OK LET'S DO THIS"" before season 6, and then later afterwards, ""alright the audience doesn't really seem to like this much, let's just scrap it as fast as we can, even if it means a disjointed story"""
Dexter,2voyu3,crackalac,3,Fri Feb 13 20:36:53 2015 UTC,"It made Debra seem even weaker, like she depended on him fully on top of needing him at work.  I wanted her character to be a tough chick :l  Just totally unnecessary felt like they ran out of ideas"
Dexter,2voyu3,LostBoy611,5,Fri Feb 13 02:30:50 2015 UTC,Debra was always vulnerable. She had a tough exterior but viewers got to see underneath.
Dexter,2voyu3,GunterthePenguin11,5,Fri Feb 13 16:01:42 2015 UTC,It just didn't fit. It seemed forced and just added for shock value.
Dexter,2voyu3,Scarfaced_zombie,2,Thu Feb 12 21:59:21 2015 UTC,It was obvious that they did it so they could also do the reveal of his identity.
Dexter,2voyu3,JiveTurkey1983,1 point,Fri Feb 13 17:26:27 2015 UTC,I was disappointed that they abandoned it because i felt it would have been a lot more interesting than hannah.
Dexter,2vp4wt,XMenOrangesTangerine,3,Thu Feb 12 22:07:04 2015 UTC,"After Book 1/Season 1, the similarities mainly stick to some characters and that's about it as far as I can recall.   The stories branch off into way different directions after that."
Dexter,2vp4wt,DexterTheSeawolf,2,Fri Feb 13 18:42:11 2015 UTC,Great. Thanks for your reply.
Dexter,2vp4wt,XMenOrangesTangerine,3,Fri Feb 13 18:46:57 2015 UTC,"The ending of the first book and season is where they split... a major death doesn't happen in the book. After that there are similar events (marriages, affairs, new characters, seasonal themes such as religion) but after the first book they're different."
Dexter,2vmhjy,theyak93,12,Thu Feb 12 05:35:38 2015 UTC,"No it was explicitly said in season one that Dexter's biological father was the same man he inherited that house from, as he takes blood from the body at the morgue and it comes back positive against his own."
Dexter,2vmhjy,goozemdoozem,5,Thu Feb 12 06:28:12 2015 UTC,"Oh, I do not remember that thank you!"
Dexter,2vmhjy,welshwordman,3,Thu Feb 12 06:51:47 2015 UTC,"Also, the series finale of season 3 Dexter is dancing with Rita at the wedding and blood stains her white wedding dress from out of his cast....seems like an interesting possible foreshadow of her death one year later."
Dexter,2vmhjy,joeloud,2,Fri Feb 13 01:13:28 2015 UTC,"It was hinted that perhaps Harry stepped out on his wife, and that Dexter was indeed a biological child, but it's never explicitly said to be the case, just that Dexter's mom was one of Harry's CIs. I chalked it up as just a potential bread crumb that the writers decided not to use. Maybe/maybe not."
Dexter,2vmhjy,wracker,2,Thu Feb 12 06:25:23 2015 UTC,Thank you!
Dexter,2vhq3p,Dariangump,7,Wed Feb 11 02:36:07 2015 UTC,Very similar
Dexter,2vhq3p,Need_4_Weed,5,Wed Feb 11 19:39:43 2015 UTC,I would say Death Note is has good as Dexter until mid-series. Then it's a lot slower and has an 'ok' ending.
Dexter,2vhq3p,XeroPT,3,Wed Feb 11 03:01:55 2015 UTC,that sounds exactly like Dexter...
Dexter,2vhq3p,ShadowSora,1 point,Wed Feb 11 20:20:27 2015 UTC,Bruh. The third Death Note arc was a hell of a lot better than the second one with Yotsuba. But the first arc was definitely the best.
Dexter,2vhq3p,Szcynergy,7,Sun Feb 15 19:03:57 2015 UTC,"I never thought of it that way! However I feel like the resemblance could be due to the fact that both characters have psychopathic traits (which would explain their perception of superiority, their ability to charm, manipulate, lie, etc.). We could propably think that every psychopathic character would resemble them. Story wise, I don't really see a resemblance..."
Dexter,2vhq3p,ploufffe,3,Wed Feb 11 19:15:10 2015 UTC,"Totally true, the same traits could apply to most psychopaths i suppose lol but I also saw a lot of similar traits of how the shows are constructed, for instance their inner dialogues being available to the audience and the cat and mouse chase between them and authority. I know these  themes are seen in plenty of shows but there's something about Light's character that just screams Dexter to me. Once again it might just be my wishful thinking holding onto a show that ended so unsatisfactory. Im on episode like, 24 on Deathnote so i still have yet to see how that plays out.."
Dexter,2vhq3p,ploufffe,3,Wed Feb 11 19:40:04 2015 UTC,"Right, there is some similarities. I agree about Dexter's ending... But we talked about that enough. I hope you enjoy Deathnote's ending better!"
Dexter,2vhq3p,shinsoosit,1 point,Wed Feb 11 19:49:43 2015 UTC,Haha i just got into that show yeah it's really similar.

Dexter,2vavz8,welshwordman,4,Wed Feb 11 21:22:12 2015 UTC,"I'm really just indifferent. The ratings on IMDB really don't matter and people are never really honest in what they rate. I guarantee you that most people who hated the ending of the show, but still liked a lot of the other seasons, would have just given the show 1/10 overall. And the people who like most of it, but not all, will just give it 10/10 or 9/10. They're completely unreliable because people always focus on what they're feeling NOW, and never what they felt previously. A reason why the majority of the stupid posts on this subreddit, is ""omg, ending sucked lol"" or ""heard show starts to suck after s4, should I stop?"" That's why I don't look at ratings and prefer to just form my own opinion."
Dexter,2vavz8,Chalky97,2,Mon Feb 9 18:47:08 2015 UTC,Final season must've dragged it down..
Dexter,2vavz8,LOLRECONLOL,2,Wed Feb 11 23:58:37 2015 UTC,The awful final seasons drags the series down
Dexter,2vavz8,Weltall548,1 point,Fri Feb 13 04:52:46 2015 UTC,doesn't matter theres alot of butthurt from season 8 and the finale it's going to happen unfortunately.

Dexter,2v6hk5,dred1367,3,Sun Feb 8 12:13:12 2015 UTC,LaGuerta running for office still makes more sense than anything in that last season.

Dexter,2v2qi9,Erekt__Butthole,14,Sat Feb 7 08:13:34 2015 UTC,I would keep that show running for as long as they can keep it good. I wouldn't want them to milk it. It would ruin the whole series for me.   Heh
Dexter,2v2qi9,LeeCarvallo,4,Sat Feb 7 10:44:12 2015 UTC,"I think i should just stop watching Dexter now, there is no way that the writers can top this season. Anything less will be a disappointment   awwh."
Dexter,2v2qi9,hockeystew,7,Sun Feb 8 16:14:37 2015 UTC,The S5-8 writers should have just written the show based off the /r/dexter comments. Those ideas in that thread alone are infinitely better than what we got.

The ending left me hopefully for the next season and then I saw the first episode of season 5 and started to worry.

It may not have been a long time ago, but hell, lets just move past it. We all know it was bad. And for people just starting to watch the series, don't tell them to stop. Give them advice and warn them that the show slowly gets bad. I myself liked the whole series. The ending wasn't great, but it was ok for me."

Slide number is somewhere between 80-90.   Non-slide number including Fan-fucking-tastic is about 40-50  Edit : Also to note Arthur Mitchell killed more people than Dexter.  So the total should be somewhere around 120-150
Dexter,2v2x5k,ccrraapp,5,Sat Feb 7 10:35:06 2015 UTC,but if you count all kills indirectly by dexter then he killed 164 and trinity only 160 (dexter wiki)

I powered through the show and got half way through season 7 in about 2 months and then it took me a year to finish the series. I was so ready to just finish the series I didn't get to enjoy the finale.. not that it was anything to  enjoy
Dexter,2v21o3,spencc1996,19,Sat Feb 7 03:12:45 2015 UTC,Probably not anytime soon but there will probably a sequel on MTV where Harrison is a serial killer in high school or some shit.

Dexter,2v21o3,rockthemullet,7,Sat Feb 7 04:12:54 2015 UTC,Why is it that Showtime has so few original TV series compared to other premium channels? Maybe they are just a shitty company to work with and nobody wants to deal with them. They did supposedly interfere with the writing of the show by not allowing Dexter's death which is pretty fucking major.
Dexter,2v21o3,kayniggs,2,Sat Feb 7 10:57:34 2015 UTC,Didn't Showtime come out and say they didn't tell the writers anything about not killing any characters?

Basically the producers said that Dexter spends the rest of his life in his flannel isolation because he realizes the death of Deb was his fault and so he thinks hes a monster and he doesn't want to end up hurting Hannah and Harrison so he ""dies"" in the hurricane so that they didn't think he ditched them. (sorry for the run on sentence)"
Dexter,2v0iss,puggalo,10,Fri Feb 6 19:21:30 2015 UTC,"Batista and Quinn know Dexter's ""self defense"" claim is bullshit,  but they let it slide because Dexter got rid of a serial killer who also murdered their friend Deb.  I  can't believe how many people, including critics, didn't get this.  But then again, I  don't think Quinn and Batista were played by the best actors in the world   As far as the search for Harrison, that's a good question. Maybe they think he died on the boat with Dexter. Maybe Elway won't tell anyone that he saw Harrison and Hannah on the bus because he's too embarrassed that he let them get away (like Hannah said when she injected him with the M99).   But,  like everyone is saying, there's a lot of loose ends and implausibilities in this shows finale."
Dexter,2v0iss,elmarko44,2,Sat Feb 7 09:28:05 2015 UTC,"But regardless of them knowing it was self defense, wouldn't there still be some sort of investigation on behalf of Saxon looking in to see if it was really self defense?

Dexter,2v0iss,niioan,1 point,Tue Feb 10 19:57:52 2015 UTC,"it was self defense, Dexter set him up to use the pen first and it was recorded, and even realistically who would push for an investigation on a serial killer who just killed a detective and Marshall...and his own mom.

Dexter,2v0iss,Chalky97,8,Thu Feb 12 01:22:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe if this episode came three episodes before, and it wasn't all rushed and we could see the consequences of Dexter's actions, maybe people wouldn't have hated it..."
Dexter,2v0iss,todd330,20,Fri Feb 6 20:35:11 2015 UTC,Yes.  It's a horrible ending.  We all know.

Dexter,2v1xxm,MugiwaraObsession,5,Sat Feb 7 02:35:01 2015 UTC,"I really wish Zach had a bigger part to play to be honest. I remember a youtube video where the guy explains how he thinks season 8 should have played out and to a point I agree with him that something should have caused Dexter to become almost completely unhinged and become dangerous enough that Zach has to kill him. Of course the ending itself is only part of the issue, there would have to be so much other things throughout the last 4 seasons changed. Oh well."
Dexter,2v1xxm,LeSoleilBrille,2,Sat Feb 7 23:51:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I thought it would have been kind of cool if dexter got caught, but then zack took over his legacy or something."

Dexter,2v1xxm,elmarko44,6,Thu Mar 12 13:12:57 2015 UTC,"From the beginning of Season 8, the distance between Dex and Deb grows as Deb sees Dexter's ""straddling the fence"" between serial killer and normal husband/father as hypocrisy.  Deb's black and white mind can't comprehend the complexities of Dexter's personal struggle. Her eventual return to Miami Metro, her failed relationships and remorse from killing LaGuerta crystallize her sense of righteousness.  In actuality, she's jealous of Dexter's growth and relationship with Hannah McKay, and mostly his child. She can't reconcile how a psychopath with no feelings has a child while she falls into failed relationship after failed relationship. Meanwhile, her biological clock begins to tick louder. Dex doesn't understand Deb's growing distance and pursues her more intensely.  Elway increasingly pressures Deb to find Hannah. Dexter is forced to hide Hannah and Harrison at a cabin in the Everglades. Deb lures Dex to meet her as they go for a ride in her car. Dex, desperate to patch his relationship with Deb, readily agrees. Deb, however isn't interested in patching the relationship and only wants Dex to turn over Hannah to Elway. She tries to convince Dex that Hannah will eventually turn on him and try to kill him. Dex, blinded by his love/need for Hannah denies this. Deb, still suicidal, and frustrated with Dex, drives the car into a lake. She escapes the sinking car and in a moment of panic and instinct goes back to save her brother.  The Dexter/Vogel/Oliver Saxon story plays out like it does in the series, but Deb is not involved in it.   After she drives the car into the lake and saves Dexter, she's racked with guilt for once again making the wrong decision – saving Dexter's life. She rejoins Miami Metro, and learns from Matthews that her father committed suicide. She assumes (correctly) that is was related to Dexter's murderous inclinations. She decides to pursue Dexter criminally, however, since she's compromised by her knowledge of Dexter's murderous past, she needs to catch him red-handed in the act. She follows Dexter as he pursues Saxon and, from behind the scenes, assists him in catching Saxon so she can catch him in the act and arrest him, bringing Dexter to justice with satisfying legitimacy.  However, Dexter, unaware at Deb is setting him up, successfully kills Saxon ruining Deb's scheme.  Deb, furious at another foiled attempt to equal her big brother's wits, confronts him at the cabin where he's hiding Hannah and Harrison.  Deb tries to apprehend Hannah, but Dexter stops her and a fight ensues. Dexter in anger, stabs Deb and she dies.  Hannah, shocked and terrified that Dexter could be so brutal to people he proclaims to love, and in front of his own child, flees with Harrison never to be seen again.   Dexter flees to Oregon and lives out his life working as a lumberjack. In the end, justice is served as Dexter is in the worst prison imaginable – too guilt-ridden over Deb's death to kill anyone ever again, and alone having chased away all the things he was starting to learn to love.  TL;DR - Deb chases Dex. Dex Kills Deb. Dex goes to his own personal hell."

Dexter,2v1xxm,CyanPancake,2,Sun Mar 1 05:19:16 2015 UTC,I always thought that that Dexter would end up on his own table. After the cover of the season 7 cover showed Dexter with a blood slide cut on his face and season 8 cover showed Dexter with Shrink wrap around his face. So I was hoping to see Dexter go in a way that he took so many people.
Dexter,2v1xxm,MikeleKayrara,2,Thu Feb 12 01:25:26 2015 UTC,"Season 5 should end with Deb catching Dexter. Then, cut Season 6 entirely. Season 7 (now 6) should feature more screentime for Ray Stevenson's character and that storyline, and Hannah should be replaced with Lumen, who sticks around and fulfills a similar role. End Season 6 with Deb killing LaGuerta. Remove the Season 8 storyline entirely. Instead, have the main conflict of the season be between Dexter and Angel, with Deb and Quinn as wild cards.   Throughout the last season, Dex will also get sloppier and start killing people who don't deserve it to preserve his secret. Quinn dies somehow, and Dexter purposefully gets caught by Angel, but not before ensuring that Deb won't get blamed. Deb raises Harrison. Dexter is tried, but is found not guilty on some fluke. He has now become exactly what he's been hunting all these years - a murderer who has slipped through the cracks of the justice system. The final scene should be him walking into whatever shitty new job he has, carrying a box of donuts, but instead of being friendly, people just stare at him in fear and disgust because they know what he is."
Dexter,2v0mn5,TheREALchadizzy1,3,Fri Feb 6 19:50:38 2015 UTC,"Someone made a post not long ago saying ""reasons not to watch past S4"" and cited your quote. Maybe that's what happened. But supposedly Showtime would not allow Dexter to be killed, so we'll never know for sure.  Another finale foreshadow if you're interested...if you watch around the 50:30 mark of S7E1 there's a flashback with Dex/Deb/Harry. Harry tells Dex, ""you don't want to lose her, do you?"" Immediately after that you see him dumping a full uncut body in a body bag, not cut up like usual, into the ocean. Then he drops Deb into the ocean the same way, albeit more delicately."
Dexter,2v0mn5,theyak93,1 point,Sat Feb 7 11:01:49 2015 UTC,I actually just posted the same thing on here along with Deb saying if she were ever brain dead to just pull the plug and smother her with a pillow.
Dexter,2v0mn5,prequinox,1 point,Thu Feb 12 05:43:28 2015 UTC,"Good catch on the foreshadowing.  It’s fun to watch a show and interpret it in your own way and I think Dexter does this to perfection.  I found foreshadowing to be a pretty clever construct in this series.  It‘s also a great way to watch it again from another perspective.  For instance, Dexter reiterates starting over again before he enters the house to pack:  “Then maybe one day, not so long from now, I’ll be rid of the dark passenger.  It all begins with a getaway, time away from the old me…life doesn’t have to be perfect, it just has to be lived.” (Damn - each time I watch that, I think of Deb).  Did you catch the naming of the characters as well?  Starting with those created by Jeff Lindsay in the books, each character’s features and actions within the series worked to fit their names.  Most of us know Dexter is Latin for right-handed/skilled, but Rita is a pearl or an object he can show off to everyone (as to keep up appearances), Astor watches Dexter like a hawk, Cody is always helpful and gracious, Lumen is Dexter’s light when he thinks he can’t change after Rita and Hannah McKay is his grace under fire for the sake of Harrison.  For example, in the season 4 finale Dexter mentions how he enjoys the thought of being connected by light with Rita.  It’s not a far-fetched notion to believe that Julia Stiles’ character was named Lumen because of this connection.  It doesn't end with notable characters either.  I thought I was reaching with this idea until some of the dialogue made fun of the names."

""Why, in a building full of cops, is Doakes the only one who gets the creeps from me?""  *I don't at all dislike how the Doakes storyline played out (though I still kinda question the scene where Dexter overpowers Doakes, former Black Ops dude, and captures him.) He was a tough character to lose though and I wish there would have been more of him. Dude was an asshole but he was a badass - in MCH's AMA he said Trinity was Dexter's most formidable foe, but I think an argument can be made for Doakes. Trinity is someone Dex had full justification to kill by the code, and passed up on multiple opportunities to do so. Doakes was a cop and he didn't fit Harry's code so Dex has legitimate reasons for him being much harder to deal with."
Dexter,2utcnq,jlawrence0723,25,Thu Feb 5 01:21:54 2015 UTC,I completely agree!! sometimes people only see Trinity as the most formidable opponent. Doakes was able to sense something wrong with Dexter even though Dexter fooled all the other cops. That's how badass he is

Don't dump off Harrison in another continent or forget Astor and Cody exist. I'm even okay with the S7 finale, as long as they gave some indication as to what happened next.

We would have got to know Dexter and Deb, got to know the back story, the bloody shipping container.. then wham-o! He had a brother that was also there.   As for Trinity, I really enjoyed the character, thought it, too, was a little over the top but still interesting. I think it would have been even better if an unknown actor played Trinity though.

Dexter,2uozud,Slaytounge,8,Wed Feb 4 01:36:38 2015 UTC,There was a side kill that was a cannibal IIRC. Dex broke into his house and found body parts in a fridge a human stew on the stove. I can't remember when this was and I'm on mobile. Edit: turns out I never learned to read

Dexter,2uly0h,Thatguybehindglass,9,Tue Feb 3 05:58:12 2015 UTC,"It would be impressive to see what Dexter's lack of emotion will do up against a sadistic ""teacher"" like Jigsaw. Jigsaw would try to teach Dex to be a better person, but he just wouldn't ""get it."" He'd only go through the motions as he has always done."
Dexter,2uly0h,GLaDOs18,3,Tue Feb 3 07:22:25 2015 UTC,True. Although as oppose to the teacher aspect I was more so thinking that he might have a hard time thinking about the fact that technically he isn't killing them.
Dexter,2uly0h,alibi6,6,Tue Feb 3 14:26:28 2015 UTC,"Jigsaw is finally on Dexter's table. Jigsaw looks around, taking in the implications of the kill room, letting Dexter talk about his victims. With a raspy voice he speaks: Not begging or arguing, but merely stating the truth as he sees it  ""I didn't kill anyone.""  ""No, you just left them in those chambers to die.""  ""They all had their chance.""  ""You knew they wouldn't succeed.""  ""Some did, those willing to learn.....""   Jigsaw turns his head to face Dexter, a knowing glance suggesting Dexter was changed by Jigsaw's puzzle  ""Did they? The police arrested Amanda, your assistant. Did you know she cuts herself these days?""  *Dexter slides his knife out and admires the blade, carefully moving closer to Jigsaw and continuing his response *  ""People don't change because you want then too, they always fall back into what's..."" Dexter sees himself in the blade   ""familiar.""  *He lifts the knife up, looking down at the kill he spent so long pursuing and learning about. Perhaps normal people could learn, and change, but only over time, and he was not normal.  Dexter sides the knife down and let's Jigsaw exhale his final breath*"
Dexter,2uly0h,qwedswerty,2,Tue Feb 3 18:58:52 2015 UTC,Pretty cool!
Dexter,2uly0h,elmarko44,2,Wed Feb 4 03:24:09 2015 UTC,"he ""isn't technically killing them"" in the same sense that people might find a way to survive Dexter as well, by attacking him first, proving that they're actually good people, or managing to get away after having woken up at the table, all of these have actually happened."

Dexter,2uhz42,Orakk,11,Mon Feb 2 11:39:38 2015 UTC,"This circlejerking is just really stupid. It's not like the writers didn't care about the show. It's just that they had a different idea of how it should end than the majority of its viewers. Feel free to criticize the plot, but it's just silly to claim that the writers ""didn't care."""
Dexter,2uhz42,TheExtremistModerate,6,Mon Feb 2 19:05:43 2015 UTC,"S8 really felt to me like they didn't care. It was so awful. As for S5-7, I think they just couldn't live up to the level of greatness Clyde Phillips took the show to. He was just that good."
Dexter,2uhz42,darwinianfacepalm,6,Mon Feb 2 20:41:12 2015 UTC,It's not circle jerking. It's actually correct. if 99% of people hated season 8 you've gotta realize the correlation.
Dexter,2uhz42,stockssn,0,Mon Feb 2 21:38:53 2015 UTC,"No, it's 99% of people's opinion that it is bad or they didn't care. That still doesn't make it a fact.  You can't get inside the writers heads and see how they actually felt."
Dexter,2uhz42,stockssn,0,Tue Feb 3 02:43:30 2015 UTC,"I was replying to a reply about whether the writers cared about the show they were writing or not.  Not about whether or not the show was good.  You can't say, regardless of how shitty the episodes were, that the writers didn't care.  They failed at making a good show, but there is no evidence that they didn't try to make it good."
Dexter,2uhz42,Chalky97,8,Tue Feb 3 09:07:06 2015 UTC,"I think there's points in Season 8 where it felt like nobody cared anymore. Deb's death got spoiled months before it even happened because they didn't bother to try and hide it. The 6-8 writers did start to not care, and did start writing poorly. It's not about a different vision; it's about terrible writing. We have a Breaking Bad spinoff happening, and everyone from the original show wants in... whereas this supposed Dexter spinoff well, nobody wants a piece, not even MCH himself. I can bet you any money if Clyde Phillips and his writers didn't leave after S4, the show would have an amazing legacy and be widely regarded as an all timer, because he really cared about his show and was always upping his game."
Dexter,2uhz42,todd330,3,Tue Feb 3 15:06:42 2015 UTC,"Well they did have less time to write the whole of season that than normal, that could be the reason that the execution of the final season wasn't as solid as previous seasons."
Dexter,2uhz42,todd330,2,Mon Feb 2 20:40:34 2015 UTC,"Thats a point that I thought of as well that I think goes overlooked.  I believe 8 started airing in June or July, just about 6-7 months after 7 finished airing.  They had to write, edit, cast, do their readings, shoot, edit and compose music (if they had new music) quicker than they were allowed for the other seasons."

Season 1 ends with a cliffhanger where Harrison accidently turns all the treadmills on and he surrounded with danger from all sides and he has horrific flashbacks to the treadmill that almost killed him when he was a kid, causing him to have a panic attack."
Dexter,2uezkd,duckwantbread,3,Sun Feb 1 18:54:24 2015 UTC,Spin off  could be Dexter travelling from city to city killing bad guys.                              Or Dexter is captured and cuts a deal with the feds allowing him to assist the feds in certain big cases.  Personally a spin off on Dexter is not needed. A continuation of the original series with a definite conclusion is needed. It can end with Dexter being captured and executed or Dexter given a happy ending with Hannah and Harrison
Dexter,2uezkd,sassman93,2,Sun Feb 1 17:16:51 2015 UTC,"""Harrison"" - Outline of first season  Harrison is 18 now and has moved back to Miami after the death of the woman he has viewed as his mother, Hannah McKay.  In Argentina he began killing, and now that he's in Miami he has more of a playing field when it comes to acting out on his urges.  Dexter has been keeping tabs on Harrison and realizes it's time to return to Miami and help Harrison learn ""the code"" after he sees Harrison being sloppy with his kills.  There's a bunch of drama between Dexter and Harrison, Harrison looking at Dexter as having abandoned him, Dexter trying to explain why he did what he did - that he's a serial killer too, and he helps Harrison learn ""the code""."

I'm a bit surprised though, because they said spinning off would have to be centered around Michael Hall, and he said he probably doesn't want to. I guess words are just words and I haven't seen all context. If there'll be another round, I bet it'll be good since Hall wouldn't have accepted otherwise."

How could they not recognise that we wanted to see everyone realising that Dexter is the BHB?

I get why he felt the need to punish himself to protect his family, but Harrison had to have been crushed by that. He's in a different country and finds out that his father is dead? It's a good thing he loves Hannah but still, the kid's an orphan and won't even see his siblings ever again.  It's also kind of a depressing end to an 8 season long roller coaster of emotion. World's best serial killer ends up spending the rest of his life as a sad, lonely lumberjack? The fact that he faked is death was appropriate but, eh. Not how I would've done it."

But the last scene made no sense to me at all. Can anyone explain it to me?"
Dexter,2u62ps,caseyst,9,Fri Jan 30 05:21:08 2015 UTC,"TL:DR I think it was an excellent nod to his rejection of everything after his loss of the one person who mattered do to his actions.    Taken from Dexter wikia:  Later, in Argentina, Hannah reads a report about Dexter's presumed fate, and she and Harrison presumably live an open-ended life from there. In the final scene of the show, clumps of logs can be seen being hoarded onto large trucks, with a few lumberjacks in the vicinity. One of these lumberjacks is the focus. He finishes up his work and he then returns to his cabin. After a hard day of work, he sits down at a table and looks into the camera, only to reveal that it's  DexterFinal  The final shot of Dexter, in a new life. Dexter Morgan, who has now given up his reign in exchange for a brand new life... This marks the end of a Killer, and the beginning of a new life.    The only thing I disagreed with their assessment was I assumed Dexter went to a logging community because he would never be found by anyone from his past life, he has freed himself from ever causing pain to the few people he ever loved again and because of the dead look in his face I thought he might rediscover his need to kill with that hole in soul reemerging and what better place than a camp where workers literally come and go every day, week, month, season.  It made sense for me. Deb is gone, his world is shattered and he knows playing husband/father was always just a pipe dream of a demented man who never really understand humanity but learned how to mimic it to the point of almost discovering his own. Especially seemingly needing to punish himself for what happened. With all of that gone, and literally nothing to lose why not fake your death and start over in an industry and region that isn't going to ask more questions than physical prowess which he possesses and the intelligence not to do dangerous activities on the clock. Dexter (or Kyle Butler or whatever alias he chose up there) likely would have excelled during working hours and no one would bat an eye that he chose to be alone instead of drunk in a camp bar after hours. I like to believe he went back to killing because it's likely there would be many others running from something (including killing) in their pasts.  A small part of me goes really dark thinking about the end and partly hopes he has rejected everything; his emerging humanity, the code, obviously society and now lives as his brother did without a shred of care but with years of experience in law enforcement with dozens of kills under his belt.  I hated a lot of season 8, a lot, but that last shot really sealed it for me how Deb really was his entire world and without her he could no longer attempt to be human for society's sake. While I didn't love the direction the writers chose to go in the last season, I very much loved how they chose to end it."
Dexter,2u62ps,matttrick,4,Fri Jan 30 05:59:02 2015 UTC,I have yet to find anyone who thinks this ended well.
Dexter,2u62ps,Indeed_A_Murderer,3,Fri Jan 30 20:36:43 2015 UTC,"It did. I was pissed, and that's how I know the ending was good. Dexter couldn't have a happy ending. They didn't fairy tale it. Or wrap everything up neatly. And I am glad."
Dexter,2u62ps,matttrick,5,Sat Jan 31 08:59:12 2015 UTC,"Breaking bad didn't have a happy ending, and yet they wrapped up a lot pretty well."
Dexter,2u62ps,Indeed_A_Murderer,3,Sun Feb 1 04:19:44 2015 UTC,"That actually was a pretty happy ending considering the possibilities. The fam got their money, jesse escaped, hell Walt even got his revenge and cuddled with his true love.  Dexter had to end as a complete mess. If you look at the whole show almost every single person he got close to ended up dead. He went from a precision killing machine to being wreckless.  He made so many selfish mistakes it was time for him to pay. Killing him would have been a cop out. Letting him escape to family land would also be cheap. I hate that they killed deb BUT it made the actual end fitting. He fucked up so many times and it made me feel like it was justice seeing him alone, living in misery.  In breaking bad Walt became so evil you were happy to see him die. You cared about the character, so it was nice to see him enact his final plan but he had to go. With dexter, it was his selfishness that undid him. Even Vogel explains that he doesn't actually love deb, but more the way she made him feel.  The show did get very sloppy as it went on. I had a real hard time accepting the shit he kept getting away with. Had the last couple of seasons been better, I could definitely have seen a better ending. But I think the final episode was very good considering what was left to work with.  I don't know what people want wrapped up. The show was about Dex. He lives in his own prison. Hannah either raised Harrison or sent him hack to be with his siblings. The station... Its homicide. They lost people before and move on. Everyone else is dead."
Dexter,2u62ps,matttrick,3,Sun Feb 1 13:47:58 2015 UTC,"The cops he was friends with slowly figuring it out at least would have been perfect-like actual evidence pointing at him, not how Deb found out. It being slowly revealed and Dexter getting into some kind of a panic, perhaps running, perhaps doing whatever the fuck he does, I don't know I'm not a writer for the show."
Dexter,2u62ps,Indeed_A_Murderer,1 point,Sun Feb 1 20:06:34 2015 UTC,"That wouldn't have been bad, although he already was figured out by how many people and he just disappeared them. Would seem a little redundant to just have him caught. I'm not saying the ending was perfect, just didn't personally think it was bad, and I was actually glad it upset me. At least that's a reaction. I was thinking about it for days after."
Dexter,2u62ps,matttrick,2,Sun Feb 1 21:14:12 2015 UTC,"""Hey look, we're not gonna tell you how he got there or make any story about it, but dexter's still alive and he's a fucking lumberjack ;))""   Fucking hell, it was really just the lumberjack scene that I hated. He basically got away with everything and now has the chance to start again."
Dexter,2u62ps,Indeed_A_Murderer,1 point,Sun Feb 1 21:18:41 2015 UTC,Ok and? So he's a lumberjack. Dumbest reason I've heard to dislike the ending. He's built his own prison away from women and everyone he knew to keep from getting close to anyone because he destroys everything he gets near.
Dexter,2u62ps,matttrick,1 point,Sun Feb 1 21:37:25 2015 UTC,"So you went away from the series feeling happy about it and glad the way it ended?  im don't actually dislike the lumberjack idea, it's just that it comes from absolutely nowhere."
Dexter,2u62ps,-mickomoo-,1 point,Mon Feb 2 01:03:26 2015 UTC,"Yes. I was very upset and then I realized - how upset I was, was an emotion. A very strong emotion to close the series. What more reaction could they have hoped for? And again the lumberjack thing makes total sense."
Dexter,2u62ps,Krisrk,1 point,Mon Feb 2 03:32:50 2015 UTC,"One of the original writers left after season 4. His ending was apparently state execution, which I guess makes sense but it is kind of obvious. While I like the direction the actual ending goes, it still felt lacking."
Dexter,2u62ps,sourninjawr,4,Tue Feb 3 02:52:48 2015 UTC,"I agree I did not enjoy the finale nor the last season. However, I did read somewhere that he may have choose this lifestyle because his mother was killed by a chainsaw... And as a lumberjack he would be subjected to hearing that sound almost all the time.   For a moment I thought, well that's an interesting perspective then I still realized it sucked in my opinion. I think we all expected so much more than what was given."
Dexter,2u62ps,KatieLeigh6,3,Fri Jan 30 15:24:00 2015 UTC,I loved the end. And while the final season was a bit convoluted and boring the second run through of the show gave me a better prospective of the message.  I am the minority that is for sure.

Deb deserved a police burial and Harrison deserved a father, just like Deb would have wanted.  I'm so sad about this! Have to keep reminding myself it's not real haha"

Which is why he snaps and looks at the camera. OR my other favorite was that Dexter and The Dark Paseenger morphed into one. The perfect Psycho."
Dexter,2u4vfm,Acedeh,24,Thu Jan 29 23:07:05 2015 UTC,"I mean, I don't like her so much either, but I think it was probably the uninspired writing that made the finale so mediocre  That is to say, things that the character of Hannah does have no real impact on how the show turns out"
Dexter,2u4vfm,PiTheKhoz,8,Thu Jan 29 23:20:05 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I don't even think the finale was THAT bad, it just could have been much better if it had the same ""chutzpah"" the rest of the show did. The writing is to blame, the way I look at at. Good writing can make anything work, and I certainly think Hannah's character had the opportunity to be great."

Dexter,2u4vfm,destiny24,2,Fri Jan 30 18:27:28 2015 UTC,"""Of"" is pronounced ""uhv"". ""Have"" is pronounced ""hahv"". But, when combined with the preceding word (which is how sentences are rendered in speech), they both come out essentially like ""uhv"" (depending on accent and region and who knows what). A possible reason is from the contraction ""would've"", which is ""would have"". How do you pronounce that? That's ""uhv"". It's a schwa (ə) that's being rendered as ""uh"" when I type it out. The schwa is an unstressed vowel in English. It often takes over in word combinations like this.  Now, if you say this all the time, and then try to type it out, you might make the mistake of using the phonetic version. The phonetic version, using the English lexicon, would be written as ""of"". This solves this case. The person is not stupid. They are just writing in the most logical fashion, but not pedantically. Lastly, they most likely should have written ""wouldn't've"", but that's not common to write (even though it's more common to say). My spell check thinks I'm a jerk for trying to write that. lol. Anyways, ""wouldn't've"" follows all the rules I laid out for pronunciation."

Dexter,2u4vfm,jmarseneault,9,Fri Jan 30 18:59:28 2015 UTC,"Dexter falling in love doesn't ruin his character. It added depth. The first episode of season 5 when he displayed raw emotion to Rita's death provided a facet of Dexter's personality we rarely see: He is in fact human.   It is easy to blame other characters for the show's lapse in quality but in all honesty it came down to one thing: Bad writers. The plot became muddled and Dexter became sloppy. Whether it was intentional or not is up to speculation.   There have been plenty of times Dexter or Deb would have been killed. To place blame solely on McKay instead of Deb regarding Elway diminishes the fact that Deb could not mentally handle the truth. Her brother, whom she idolized and secretly loved, was a cold-blooded murderer who was trained by her own father. Deb's death was due to the fact that she had a downward spiral in which she could not control. If it were not for Saxon, another event which she contributed towards would have aided in her demise.  The characters didn't ruin Dexter. Poor writing did.  *Edited for grammar mistakes."
Dexter,2u4vfm,vmasuka,2,Fri Jan 30 04:17:10 2015 UTC,"I seriously wish Dexter falling in love had been believable and well executed. Honestly, if the ideas of seasons 8 had been written with the quality of seasons 1-4 (with a TON of tweaking and a few major plot changes), it could have been a legendary ending to an amazing show. Unfortunately, season 8 was nothing but disappointment and missed potential."

And even if she did, she should have come back as a villain.  Season 8 should have had Hannah trying to get back at Deb, not looking for Dexter's help.  the problem with Hannah in season 8 is how she becomes this damsel in distress and the second half of the season becomes ALL about Hannah. Dexter kind of stops caring about his own problems and starts caring mostly about her more than anything else. I understand Dexter loved her, but the writers did such an awful job with this."

Dexter,2u1awp,Erekt__Butthole,27,Thu Jan 29 02:16:42 2015 UTC,"Also,   Could be the main cause that Dexter is even a killer in the first place by telling him that he's a monster and all this shit. Maybe he was just a sadistic kid. Harry didn't give him a chance to be normal. He just said ''you have no emotions and you're a monster'' and Dexter believed every word from a young age. We see glimpses of humanity and emotion (and definitely justice) in Dexter, which you wouldn't see in the usual psychopath."
Dexter,2u1awp,-mickomoo-,3,Thu Jan 29 05:35:59 2015 UTC,"While many people see Dexter as a show just about a serial killer, my alternate interpretation of Dexter is somebody who didn't get the mental health help they needed.   As a kid he seemed to have some cluster B personality disorder. The fact that he had such a strong attachment to Harry and the code for so long kind of indicates that he might have not been a true psychopath and that Harry's interference put in a false need to kill.   Besides psychopathy usually is correlated with physiological or neurological correlates (reduced frontal lobe size, peculiar neuroelectrical activity, ect.). Also the anti social behaviors are things that would have manifested in early childhood. His scenes as Dexter Moser are fairly normal."
Dexter,2u1awp,k_ru,8,Tue Feb 3 03:05:49 2015 UTC,"From a character development standpoint, all of these things are extremely important. Harry is human, Harry is fallible, Harry makes mistakes. He did what he thought best in an absolutely horrible situation. Dex used his word as law for so long and held him up on a pedestal.   When Dex starts learning who his father really was, he is forced to question all he's been taught and to find his own way, his own morality, acknowledge his own possibility for emotion. The show couldn't have gone on for so many seasons without this need for growth and change. If he never learned of Harry's mistakes, it would have been easy to just follow the code and live a lovely and charming serial killer life."

He felt like he was becoming like Brian, so who better to come ""haunt"" him?  It was played as light-hearted in a lot of good bromance spots, then you realize that Dexter is just by himself, driving around in Nebraska shooting guns on highways and you remember why he's there in the first place. He needed to prove to himself he wasn't Brian.  Anyway, could it have been executed better? I think so, but I also couldn't tell you how, other than I think a road trip to Nebraska was unnecessary. lol"

It was a nice break from the main storyline of S6. Dexter killed his only chance at happiness, his own brother who loved him, it makes sense Brian would be in his head as much as Harry. I'd have liked to see more of him.  *I know this will never happen but I would watch a Dexter prequel series that centered around Brian, starting with Laura's death and what happened to him from there. Then the series would end with him discovering Dexter as an adult and beginning work on his plan to reunite with him."

Dexter,2tpw4n,SammysGotAGun,23,Mon Jan 26 13:43:37 2015 UTC,Trinity didn't know Dexter's secret. He thought Dexter was just a lab tech that figured out who Trinity was and was trying to get money from him.
Dexter,2tpw4n,Marx0r,11,Mon Jan 26 14:44:44 2015 UTC,"Okay. Maybe ""secret"" wasn't the right word. What I'm saying is that Trinity had to know something was off. Someone that messed up of a person should be able to sense something like that. I mean. First, Dexter tackling him to the ground and saying I should have killed you when I had the chance? That was before he demanded money to try and keep the Kyle Butler persona going.  Secondly, I thought that Arthur never did plan on giving him the money? He was shutting down ALL of his bank accounts to flee the country (Dexter speculated anyways). If he was just going to give Dexter the money I would think he would just empty the accounts, not shut them down completely. That made me think that he sensed Dexter as a threat and wanted to get back at him.  Also. The whole injecting him with chemicals in the back of his van at the bank thing. Aruthur had to have realized then.  If anything I think Trinity would have told Rita about the things Dexter had done and at least that he was darker than Rita could have ever imagined."
Dexter,2tpw4n,Marx0r,2,Mon Jan 26 15:23:14 2015 UTC,The best Trinity could've done was vague statements about dark things inside Dexter. Rita would've attributed that to his recovery from heroin addiction and the role he played in Paul's death.
Dexter,2tpw4n,velocity92c,7,Tue Jan 27 17:29:01 2015 UTC,"Trinity didn't know Dexter's secret until he was already on his table. He only knew him as Kyle Butler until shortly before Dexter killed him, and even after he discovered that Kyle Butler was a lie, he only knew he worked for Miami Homicide, not that he was a serial killer."

Dexter,2tqnnq,qwedswerty,11,Mon Jan 26 17:40:56 2015 UTC,"This is a really good question to toy with, to be honest, I feel as if she may have major suspicion about what Dexter was up to. However, not to the extent of a psychotic serial killer. How much she actually knew? Who knows. It's one of the most mind boggling philosophies of this show. As Dexter says, “There are no secrets in life, just hidden truths that lie beneath the surface.”"
Dexter,2tqnnq,opengrave,2,Mon Jan 26 20:19:10 2015 UTC,When does he say that? Sounds like season 1-2.
Dexter,2tqnnq,opengrave,3,Mon Jan 26 20:27:31 2015 UTC,I believe it was one of the very first episodes.
Dexter,2tqnnq,elmarko44,2,Mon Jan 26 20:29:50 2015 UTC,"She's too naive to have known too much. Any of the ""complications"" she contributed to the story were accidental -  like a sick kid or a kid running away or problems with Paul.  If she had any idea,  her contributions to Dexter's problems would have been more ""intentional"".   It's part of why I hate her character. She offers a few things for Dexter to reflect upon about himself, but for the most part she's just a wildcard source of problems and another reason for Dexter's cell phone to ring with untimely issues."

Dexter,2tp8mq,iFoxMSF,3,Fri Jan 30 23:03:33 2015 UTC,He has no problem with the solve rate after season 2 because they believe the BHB is dead and gone now (Doakes). For most of his kills there isn't even an investigation so it probably wouldn't affect the solve rate anyway. If he played it like that in another city with a higher solve rate then the cops would probably be smarter but Dexter might still have gotten away with it if he followed the code.
Dexter,2tp8mq,Bocaj6487,1 point,Mon Feb 2 17:06:40 2015 UTC,He would just end up reducing the solve rate like he does in Miami
Dexter,2tlkxq,subjectiveoddity,3,Sun Jan 25 08:22:26 2015 UTC,"I didn't understand your question so there may be a LOT of spoilers for people not done with the show.  What do you mean by that? Like what search engine (it was a fake one created for the show) or what identity protocols does he use to hide his identity (not many, relies on the sloppiness of the Miami Metro P.D. a little too often) or what?  He does change from his outdated search engine NetWrangler to Eliot based on Louis (who supposedly knows his shit but was a giant joke in reality compared to people I've known, better than me but not by much.)  I would compare it to he changed from Google that tracks and reports to DuckDuckGo which doesn't and seemingly at least had the absolute bare minimum protection on his laptop at home. Not like the guy was wiping his drive every week or redirecting through a VPN and an alternate wi-fi. He would easily be tracked if someone with proficient technical skills, or access to someone with them, were to become suspicious of him.  In the end ITK didn't need them, Doakes was not that kind of guy, Quinn was about the same, Trinity was an older man and not savvy, Miguel Prado relied on a simple check of the internal records, The Skinner relied on Prado, Jordan Chase didn't have those abilities although he certainly had the resources and could have had his suspicions arisen sooner. Travis was truly insane so wow can't go there, he wasn't aware of his own actions. Sirko didn't need to and the Brain Surgeon didn't need to bother as Dexter did the work for him. Louis was too big of punk to be able to do anything with the skill set he had other than entrapping others for his miscreant actions. LaGuerta had burned all her bridges or she could have received serious help in tracking Dexter's actions to bring him down.  Lundy would be the only one I would say was capable of using resources like these properly and would have but he seemed blinded by his love of Debra into seeing Dexter as nothing more than just an incredibly brilliant but odd duck."
Dexter,2tlkxq,TheExtremeChef2,3,Sun Jan 25 16:47:41 2015 UTC,He uses restricted search engines that are only available to police and PI's for information on people.
Dexter,2tlbmi,dvfsz,3,Sun Jan 25 06:05:31 2015 UTC,"He had a lot of chances, even saved Arthur from suicide. He was selfish, and Rita along with her children and family paid the price for his recklessness. And/or it was fate like Dexter said. Harrison most likely watched his mother being murdered and was left crying in a pool of blood, just like his dad. Rita having to come back home for her ID when she was almost safe gave Arthur that opportunity to fulfill fate, if you believe that's what it was.  Dexter did to Rita what Harry did to Laura, put them in danger that led to both being murdered."
Dexter,2tlbmi,subjectiveoddity,2,Sun Jan 25 08:14:46 2015 UTC,"Harry put Laura Moser in danger over his job, Dexter had finally learned that he truly loved his family even above himself and rule #1 of don't get caught became about them and not himself. His actions showed he didn't want to hurt them by seeing him for what he is and chose to try to learn from a man who seemingly had it all.  I agree with you for the most part that it was an ill formed plan and backfired in the worst way but I would say it was Dexter's most unselfish motivation in the entire series. Not just for his own son; but for Cody, Astor, Rita and even Deb he was willing to hold off his at that point most trophied kill to learn more about being human for the people that loved him.  Edited for lots of spelling and grammar that made no sense."
Dexter,2tlbmi,subjectiveoddity,2,Sun Jan 25 16:52:54 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. He did learn a lot from Arthur about being a father, except the beating part. When he brought what he learned home, Rita and the kids seemed to like it. Sure waiting and toying with Arthur was kind of selfish, but he also learned a lot from Arthur that actually kind of saved his family."

Dexter,2tlbmi,cheddar742,1 point,Sat Jan 31 17:20:44 2015 UTC,"Well, I worded that wrong. It didn't save his family, but he took ideas that made Arthur told him and took them home. Like the activities, they were Arthur's ideas and made Rita happy. So, it didn't save his family, but helped Dexter gain some of Rita's trust again."
Dexter,2tlbmi,TheExtremeChef2,1 point,Sat Jan 31 18:10:30 2015 UTC,"Okay, I don't disagree with any of that. But what about after the Thanksgiving dinner? Well they never actually ate much or anything, but still - at that point Dexter could have anonymously tipped off Miami Metro. He KNEW who Trinity was. But for what, 4 or 5 more episodes, he went after Trinity solo, and even went so far as to frame another man for Trinity's murders to buy him more time to get Trinity himself. He even says in one of the episodes he wanted Trinity for himself...selfish."

Dexter,2tl5rv,LeeCarvallo,1 point,Sun Jan 25 05:15:25 2015 UTC,I thought he said he only murders people that gets away because of lack of evidence. I know that later on he does start to tamper with evidence so he can have the kill himself.
Dexter,2tl5rv,An_Average_Fellow,1 point,Sun Jan 25 07:23:08 2015 UTC,"They say that on occasion his work turns out sloppy, but I think for the most part he only targets people have slipped throught the cracks of the justice system on their own."
Dexter,2tl5rv,scarlet_overlord,-1,Sun Jan 25 19:55:45 2015 UTC,"A few times.   But i feel this was to show he's actually human, and no one is perfect."
Dexter,2tdt32,welcome6,9,Fri Jan 23 07:26:37 2015 UTC,"It felt like a tangential episode. Brian was ghost buddy, then gone. Nothing mattered if this episode didn't air. (I think.) Mostly the Brian thing. In other words, I agree."
Dexter,2tdt32,azoolie,16,Fri Jan 23 13:20:26 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest the high school reunion hookup was cringeworthy too.  Was really, really obvious it was just to advance the plot, and really stuck out as weird because it was so out of place.  IIRC it was the first episode, and I knew things were going to get worse from there."
Dexter,2tdt32,ManFromAnAntiqueLand,2,Fri Jan 23 15:49:42 2015 UTC,"well yeah it was kind of stupid but she only went down on him, and he saved her high school years when she copied his answers on tests, So... I could accept that hook up, in a weird way. but it was at least believable   but the Gas station was just ridiculous, not only because what girl in the world sleeps with some random guy after speaking for 2 minutes, but also because of how young she was. I was kind of disgusted by how bad the whole thing was lol. not disgusted that dexter got laid, but how the writers handled it."
Dexter,2tdt32,Starburstnova,8,Sat Jan 24 07:49:13 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of indifferent. I enjoy it, but I agree it was very out of character and the first time I watched it, I just kept thinking ""what the fuck is going on?!"""
Dexter,2tdt32,Ascurtis,3,Fri Jan 23 13:20:26 2015 UTC,I agree. Plus killing two guys just for the hell of it. Wouldn't that kinda put himself on his own list?
Dexter,2tdt32,WFAlex,1 point,Fri Jan 23 14:15:04 2015 UTC,"It would but during that episode, harry is gone and with him his Code.  Brian takes Harrys place, but in a way darker and careless way, he doesn't need people to fit harrys code, he is trying to reinvent himself and his personal idea of the code, which is manifested by the memory of Brian"
Dexter,2tdt32,Psychopath-,1 point,Tue Feb 17 13:54:50 2015 UTC,"""what the fuck is going on?!""  hahaha, yeah that's how I felt as well."
Dexter,2tdt32,cam5478,2,Sat Jan 24 07:49:48 2015 UTC,I'd be cool with them doing a short webseries with that premise.
Dexter,2tdt32,FoxIslander,5,Fri Jan 23 16:48:52 2015 UTC,"I personally only like it because Brian was back in it, aside from that it was pretty unnecessary."
Dexter,2tdt32,aclays,5,Sun Jan 25 08:16:49 2015 UTC,"....this is exactly why Dexter fell apart for me. Dexter lost his awkward shyness...it was replaced with ""hot"" dexter...who all of a sudden every woman was attracted to. The first two women in Dexter's life was Rita and Lumen...just as messed up as Dexter."
Dexter,2tdt32,nuggetinabuiscuit,3,Fri Jan 23 14:32:52 2015 UTC,"Nothing important, but it was entertaining in my opinion."
Dexter,2tdt32,LlammaPandaCat,3,Fri Jan 23 23:47:50 2015 UTC,"I LOVED the return of Brian (i'm a Brian fanboy). He was not only funny, but he was the perfect manifestation of Dexter's dark passenger. It was different, and refreshing. As for the plot, I wish that Dex had killed Jonah and really shown his dark side. Maybe have Brian stay on for a bit more? The episode was about Dex's dark passenger, and exploring the fact that, when it comes down to it, Dex is just a dark, sociopathic serial killer."
Dexter,2tdt32,Deakul,2,Fri Jan 23 16:45:08 2015 UTC,"about Brian, I think IGN said it best with their review of the episode,   "" And the stuff with Brian himself, the figment, didn't quite work since it was almost immediately clear that Dexter wasn't fully on board with Brian's agenda and yet he was still seeing him. Which meant that Brian was left to nag Dexter for most of the episode. Which meant that Brian grew tiresome very quickly. I mean, this late in the game do we really need someone, even Dexter himself, giving Dexter s*** for loving his son?""  I didn't like how Brian was acting but when I read that review it clicked for me. It did feel like he was nagging most of the time.  To me Dexter and Brian together didn't feel dark, It was too campy  some stuff in the episode (like the shooting of the gun in the air while driving)  reminded me of Spiderman 3, when Peter Parker becomes ""Evil"" and goes dancing in the jazz club  a little bit.   if Dexter was going dark, and Brian was manifesting himself to him, I don't really understand why they had to make it so campy like they did. If anything the episode should have been much darker than usual.  (I understand Dexter was letting go but it didn't feel right, Dexter was really angry about Brother Sam and he was letting the rage take over. I wish they showed a more evil Dexter in this episode)"
Dexter,2tdt32,jesusisaslut,2,Sat Jan 24 04:54:29 2015 UTC,"I thought that episode was like an offshoot episode, similar to when Jay Sherman visited the simpsons from The Critic."
Dexter,2tdt32,darkpassengerdriving,3,Sat Jan 24 07:58:51 2015 UTC,I thought it was generally agreed upon that Nebraska was likely the worst episode of the series.
Dexter,2tdt32,elmarko44,1 point,Fri Jan 23 19:45:34 2015 UTC,"maybe it is but I only saw nothing but praise when the episode aired. Everyone was really happy about Brian returning. Even recently I was reading about Dexter somewhere else and some were saying how the only good thing about season 6 was this episode, so it made me wonder"
Dexter,2taot7,julianedmonds,30,Thu Jan 22 15:45:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think that idea works for two reasons:   I think what Dexter is describing is Masuka's awkwardness as someone who's just not great in a social capacity, but is really trying to fit in. Like Dexter, he's showing people what he thinks they want to see, but unlike Dexter, he genuinely wants to fit in. I'm going by the TV version of Masuka, but they sound about the same. It's a bit of a stretch (almost comical, now that I think about it) that the two forensic guys in the same police precinct would both be secret serial killers, successfully hiding that fact not only from their co-workers, but each other."
Dexter,2taot7,Ozzdo,6,Thu Jan 22 17:19:16 2015 UTC,...is the right answer!
Dexter,2taot7,dpmcg,2,Thu Jan 22 17:28:29 2015 UTC,"That and Mesuka is not fit. He's short and not really muscular. He'd have a hell of a time trying to control some of his kills if they swung a punch or struggled. I also think it's already almost infeasible the amount of unsolved murders, missing persons, and botched investigations that dexter leaves behind, in addition to actual legit cases of each. How many of these can one city have and the team still be considered good at their job?  More plausible spin off could have been Dexter training Zack with Hannah and Vogul as guides, or not killing off Miguel. There were many missed opportunities for stuff like that, especially later on."
Dexter,2taot7,Nebakanezzer,1 point,Fri Jan 23 00:38:35 2015 UTC,"I think that maybe Masuka's MO could be predicated on the fact that he isn't very fit, so maybe he has some alternative forms of killing. I would like to see Dexter and Masuka meet, both trying to get the same target and then both trying to cover up what they're doing. I think this would have to be sort of sitcom style, but it would really be great.  What if Lundy put Masuka as LFA on the BHB because he wanted to keep an eye on him? We could get some pretty interesting story going."
Dexter,2taot7,PiTheKhoz,2,Fri Jan 23 02:51:17 2015 UTC,"I think that's why it would work, it would be more of a comedy. Masuka cracking jokes and killing people would be interesting."
Dexter,2taot7,BlindStark,9,Thu Jan 22 20:24:30 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but I think Masuka as a serial killer is going a bit too far. I'd be too big of a coincidence for 2 miami metro forensic technicians to both be serial killers. Also, the TV show never mentioned that Dex thought that Masuka was 'faking' his humour. Only the novels. One other thing, is that Masuka wasn't putting up a mask, but that he was genuinely funny. They do say that funny people are usually the darkest, and most serial killer like, but still, not Masuka."
Dexter,2taot7,nuggetinabuiscuit,1 point,Thu Jan 22 17:35:50 2015 UTC,Oh yeah I don't know if I can see him as a serial killer I'd just watch a t.v show with him in it.
Dexter,2taot7,chanilastname,1 point,Thu Jan 22 19:35:24 2015 UTC,"Fuck coincidences, I don't believe in 'em."
Dexter,2taot7,-Anti-Hero-,-2,Sat Jan 24 10:32:57 2015 UTC,"You can't know for sure that Masuka wasn't putting up a mask. If you saw Dexter through the eyes of a complete stranger, would you think he was a serial killer? Sociopaths are very good at blending in. You can never know for sure that Masuka isn't a serial killer unless you got a look into his life outside of work. As for it being realistic, there were a bunch of things in Dexter that weren't realistic."
Dexter,2taot7,nuggetinabuiscuit,4,Thu Jan 22 19:13:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I just can't see Masuka killing anyone. If I didn't know that Dex was a killer, then somehow you found out, it wouldn't come as a HUGE surprise. But Masuka? I don't know, a bit of a stretch if you ask me."
Dexter,2taot7,ObsidianRose,3,Thu Jan 22 21:53:09 2015 UTC,The only problem with it is that Dexter's dark passenger (if we are focusing on the books and not the series) can see other people's dark passengers. Dexter would immediately recognize darkness in Masuka so it is unlikely that he would turn out to be a secret serial killer.
Dexter,2taot7,ChRoNicBuRrItOs,1 point,Thu Jan 22 20:05:06 2015 UTC,"Dexter could see if other people had dark passengers in the TV series, sometimes anyway. Not that I agree with OP."
Dexter,2taot7,ask_buck,2,Fri Jan 23 08:28:33 2015 UTC,Compare dexter and masukas actions. Masuka actually laughs and has emotions and is awkward and a sociable person. Dexter would have picked up that he was working next to another sociopath the second he met him. And yes you can know for sure that masuka is not a serial killer because this is a fictional story and he was intended to be normal. This idea is laughable dude
Dexter,2taot7,azoolie,1 point,Fri Jan 23 06:06:02 2015 UTC,"Except that he needed Masuka to cover him in his job. Masuka never fucked with Dexter when Dexter made mistakes. He helped him. Maybe he was helping Dexter cover up his mistakes because he was also doing shit.  Anyways, I'm saying Dexter was turning a blind eye. Similar to how he would try to be normal and engage in normal activities. Doing that means he has to invest in it a bit. Same with investing in Masuka and being happy with his lab partner and not suspicious (even if Dark Passenger inklings were afoot)."
Dexter,2taot7,SpywareAgen7,7,Fri Jan 23 13:28:49 2015 UTC,What if they made him a serial rapist instead?
Dexter,2taot7,BaconAllDay2,5,Thu Jan 22 20:22:31 2015 UTC,I think most people can sympathize with a serial killer taking out the trash but not serial rapist.
Dexter,2taot7,Call_Me_A_Stoat,7,Thu Jan 22 22:48:46 2015 UTC,A serial rapist who rapes serial rapists?

Now, would you like it in the ass or will you suck my dick like a good boy?  Victim rapist: *cries* I am not a good boy! *stiffens up* FUCK MY ASS, YOU ASSHOLE!

Dexter,2taot7,funguy4444,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:45:26 2015 UTC,Ain't no way this would happen. Masuka was just a source of comic relief within a very dark show.
Dexter,2taot7,azoolie,1 point,Fri Jan 23 03:40:45 2015 UTC,"There are different ways of killing. There's Dexter's way, Hannah's way, cop's way, etc. Masuka would not use his muscle, but his perverted mind. Once he gets his mind going (as long as it's perverted thoughts) he can twist the most extreme plot. I think, in terms of contrivance, he would be awesome at extremely convoluted evildoings.  The only issue with this being his show would be what motivation does he have? I can only think of sadism. But I think I'd enjoy the show (if not be totally squicked while watching).  A prequel show, maybe, from before he turned his life around and devoted himself to the department. His daughter being the final nail in the coffin of his past ways. (His past ways being exemplified by all those dirty jokes (which were in reality his evil thoughts).)"
Dexter,2taot7,chanilastname,1 point,Fri Jan 23 13:36:26 2015 UTC,"I like this idea....Masuka was one of my favorites, I was saddened by the lack of him in the final seasons."
Dexter,2taot7,chanilastname,5,Thu Jan 22 16:13:35 2015 UTC,"The problem with Masuka is he's not a very versatile character. His main role in the show is for comic relief. They tried to involve him more in that subplot with his daughter in season 8, but that didn't really work very well."
Dexter,2taot7,BlindStark,4,Thu Jan 22 16:16:59 2015 UTC,Yeah I Dunno ..I haven't read the books but what I did see of Masuka I liked. That story in that point of the series seemed stupid....if they had of made him a bigger character earlier it may have worked. I dunno I think with a good supporting cast I'd watch a show with Masuka.
Dexter,2taot7,chanilastname,1 point,Thu Jan 22 16:21:30 2015 UTC,Not to mention there was literally no point in having is daughter there. If they are going to add plot at least go all the way and finish it.
Dexter,2t8mnv,alphadog3939,20,Thu Jan 22 01:31:01 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. Except for the season 8 part. I honestly think it's better just not watching it at all, but I may be in the minority. It tainted the show in a way for me.  Seasons 1, 2, and 4 are my favorites (in that order), then I'd rank 7 just above 3, 5, and 6.   8 is a trainwreck that never should have happened and I've erased it from my Dexter canon."
Dexter,2t8mnv,der1x,10,Thu Jan 22 02:56:11 2015 UTC,8 just has no fucking substance. Its a waste of time to rewatch.
Dexter,2t8mnv,Cephyran,4,Thu Jan 22 06:40:56 2015 UTC,"For longevity, 7 was a perfectly decent place to end the series. I think overall season 5 would have been a more natural ending to the series, since Dexter's arc ends on a more positive note. The season itself started strong - interesting, wonderfully despicable villains. I felt like the closure moment was unsatisfying, but I think that was the point they were making in regards to the Lumen character.   The cliffhanger off of 6 kind of forces you into 7, but I agree that there is so little substance to 8. Everything that happens in seasons 7 and 8 needed to be a single more-coherent arc over one season."
Dexter,2t8mnv,Zykium,1 point,Thu Jan 22 03:19:33 2015 UTC,Season 8 was terrible. Why would Hannah drug Dexter and Deb as some kind of hello.
Dexter,2t8mnv,TheRealRacker,8,Sun Jan 25 15:48:09 2015 UTC,"All of the seasons are really good, and there isn't much negative about them.  Except season 8.  I only watched it because I had to know how it all ended, but boy was it shitty the whole way through.  I thoroughly enjoyed 1-7 however."
Dexter,2t8mnv,BlindStark,3,Thu Jan 22 04:38:18 2015 UTC,I'd watch all the seasons even if they are bad. It's just after 4 it starts to go down hill in a lot of ways.
Dexter,2t8mnv,azoolie,1 point,Thu Jan 22 20:31:06 2015 UTC,"Season 5 still follows the show's formula. I think 6 might, too. After that there's issues, but then you gotta finish. So close."
Dexter,2t8mnv,Slaytounge,1 point,Thu Jan 22 07:02:45 2015 UTC,"You're an idiot for assuming my opinions are based entirely on what other people think. I noticed a change in tone after season 4 before ever coming to this subreddit. It's fine if people like all the seasons, it's all personal taste, but my opinion has nothing to do with some bandwagon.  And to clarify - there is a change in tone after each season, I just enjoyed those shifts more than the later ones."
Dexter,2t8mnv,dvfsz,1 point,Thu Jan 22 20:37:48 2015 UTC,"I loved every season. Even 8. It wasn't perfect and not very good, but it was ok. Season 5 was really good. So was 6 and 7. I agree with you that some people don't think for themselves. They see what others say and listen. I say just watch the whole show. If you don't like it, then you don't like it, but don't tell other not to watch. If anything, just tell your opinion. Don't tell people not to watch."
Dexter,2t8mnv,LostBoy611,1 point,Sun Jan 25 05:57:12 2015 UTC,"I just finished season 5 last night and it was pretty awesome. I think some people didn't like it because Dex is realizing that while he is damaged goods, he isn't as far gone as he leads himself to believe. Season 1 is still my favorite, but 4 and 5 and right there too. I enjoyed season 2 on a more personal level because I'm a recovering addict and it hit on some personal stuff. I honestly didn't care for season 3 as much. I can't wait to finish the series and see if it all falls apart like people say."
Dexter,2t8mnv,Starburstnova,1 point,Thu Jan 22 13:10:14 2015 UTC,"The writing on the later seasons certainly isn't as strong, but I LOVE season 5. Season 8 started really slow, but even that isn't as terrible as many people make it out to be. I mostly found it disappointing because there was so much lost potential with storylines they didn't take. I'd go into detail, but I don't want to spoil anything.  That being said, the finale was really unsatisfying. There was little buildup and it just...ends in silence, with no explanation with a bunch of loose ends. But up until that, season 8 even had good parts, despite easily being the weakest season. I wouldn't recommend anybody skip it."
Dexter,2t8mnv,Khal-Stevo,1 point,Thu Jan 22 13:49:08 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed season 5 but your argument is ridiculous saying people can't think for themselves. Just because you enjoyed S5 doesn't mean other people had to, in their opinion it may have sucked."
Dexter,2t8mnv,Subulie3,0,Thu Jan 22 16:10:59 2015 UTC,"I was unsatisfied with the ending like most people but after watching for the second time I learned to like it. It's what happened and no ones going to change it so I enjoy it for what it was.  Also, if you love Dexter as much as I do, I wouldn't care what other people said about the later seasons. It's something you haven't seen, I'd still get excited even if I heard it was bad."
Dexter,2t8mnv,flargh86,-2,Thu Jan 22 15:18:28 2015 UTC,"Past Trinity...fuck the show. Seriously. Watch it until the end, OP. You'll come back here raging about what a piece of shit the later seasons and particularly the finale was. I stuck through those shitty seasons hoping that it'd redeem myself and instead...lumberjack. I don't feel bad 'spoiling' it for you because it's just god damn garbage and a waste of everyone's time."
Dexter,2t8uyz,Trenzo,7,Thu Jan 22 02:39:01 2015 UTC,I definitely agree with you. Dexter killing his brother is also high on my list.
Dexter,2t8uyz,Starburstnova,3,Thu Jan 22 12:52:35 2015 UTC,"That was pretty heartbreaking, I'll throw that in my top 3. Seeing Brian tearing up on Dexter's table, not because he was going to die but because he failed to reunite with Dexter. He put years into his plan, all for one person who he missed for so long. I don't think he ever would have given up on him. He was Biney's little brother and he truly loved him.   I think that's the only kill that was actually difficult for Dexter to do."
Dexter,2t8uyz,funguy4444,3,Fri Jan 23 01:31:29 2015 UTC,Seeing Red is by far my favorite episode. It's just so well done.
Dexter,2t8uyz,TK7901,3,Thu Jan 22 13:42:57 2015 UTC,"End of season 4 gotta be my #1 scene. I was completely blindsided, and the thought of Rita dying didn't even cross my mind."
Dexter,2t8uyz,Subulie3,2,Fri Jan 23 03:50:58 2015 UTC,"Dexter said it was fate, maybe he was right. He had so many chances to get rid of Trinity, even saved him once. When Dex finally decided to finish the job he ran into a lot of roadblocks. Harry warned him that he was juggling too many things in his life at once.  Dexter blew it. He kept it a secret from Miami Metro all for his own selfish desire to kill him, after ""learning"" from him.  Harrison, probably witnessing his mother's death, sitting in a pool of blood, just like Dex. I'm sad we'll never know the future of Harrison and whether that affeted him in a severe way or not."
Dexter,2t8uyz,SanderMS,3,Fri Jan 23 04:55:08 2015 UTC,"Mine is after Rita dies when Dexter kills that guy in bathroom. In my opinion that's the best scene, acting wise that I've ever seen in this show."
Dexter,2t8uyz,redawn,2,Sat Jan 24 06:02:22 2015 UTC,"God, seeing this scene again... making me want to go back and rewatch em all."
Dexter,2t6c9g,Erekt__Butthole,12,Wed Jan 21 15:07:16 2015 UTC,"Dude, good call. I'm re-watching the series and just saw that episode again a few days ago.  That scene really gave insight into who Doakes is."
Dexter,2t6c9g,tadow78,3,Wed Jan 21 17:26:44 2015 UTC,Doakes knows of his Dark Passenger and cares enough about his wife to not want to harm her.
Dexter,2t6c9g,BaconAllDay2,3,Wed Jan 21 23:03:55 2015 UTC,"He was the dad in Sister Sister Smart Guy, wasn't he? His scene on the boat totally changed my perception of him. Very powerful"

Dexter,2t6c9g,Checkers10160,3,Wed Jan 21 19:14:19 2015 UTC,"I guess this really reveals why Doakes is so sure there is something off with Dexter, he just sees himself in him."
Dexter,2t7niz,LostBoy611,5,Wed Jan 21 21:05:25 2015 UTC,"I hate how Dexter so easily cares for another woman straight after Rita's death. The show completely jumped the shark that season, making him break character for the first time, and honestly made me hate him a little bit. How could it take so long for Dexter to feel comfortable around his wife, when it takes only a couple of episodes for him to feel comfortable around whatsherface?  Edit: Lumen"
Dexter,2t7niz,Chalky97,1 point,Wed Jan 21 23:11:33 2015 UTC,"The circumstances were different. Rita's death also made Dex more vulnerable and sympathetic. Lumen also resembles Rita which makes it slightly confusing for him and thats why he feels the need to protect her and right the wrong doings that have been done to her, on top of having said feelings for another woman so quickly."
Dexter,2t7niz,sherminnater,1 point,Thu Jan 22 01:10:27 2015 UTC,Because Lumen was different than Rita. They understood EVERYTHING about each other.
Dexter,2t7niz,BloodChicken,1 point,Thu Jan 22 02:57:30 2015 UTC,Dexter got over Rita because deep down no matter what he thought. He didn't have emotions for her. He couldn't and even though he thought he loved her he couldn't convince the dark passenger.
Dexter,2t7niz,ChRoNicBuRrItOs,2,Mon Jan 26 06:08:46 2015 UTC,"I love season 5, but I can't say anything until you finish the season first."
Dexter,2t7niz,dvfsz,-1,Wed Jan 21 21:16:08 2015 UTC,"Save yourself, don't watch season 8. I just finished it today after ample warnings onliine and from friends. Big mistake."
Dexter,2t7niz,ChRoNicBuRrItOs,1 point,Fri Jan 23 08:36:41 2015 UTC,"Don't say that. Finish the series man. 8 isn't great I'll tell you that, but it is somewhat interesting. Don't listen to others. Finish the show and make your own opinion. Seasons 5, 6, and 7 are pretty good. Keep watching, you might like it all."
Dexter,2t4kwl,adamtaylor4815,11,Wed Jan 21 02:44:53 2015 UTC,"[SPOILERS] when Dexter tells Trinity that he could never leave his family, then the finale happened."
Dexter,2t4kwl,Scook98,6,Wed Jan 21 03:45:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Trinty's whole kill scene is very interesting to watch knowing what Trinity knows, especially the significance of ""it's already over"""
Dexter,2t4kwl,Holbreon,1 point,Wed Jan 21 04:07:49 2015 UTC,"""So what's the alternative, Arthur? Leave? Disappear? Fake my own death and start over again?"""
Dexter,2t4kwl,LostBoy611,12,Thu Jan 22 16:29:01 2015 UTC,"I always loved this one. Rita says that she ""never got to say goodbye"" after their first date. They never got to have a real goodbye when she died. Also!....  When she says this, she is wearing the same outfit that she is buried in many years later. I like to think that Dexter chose to bury her in this dress to preserve her innocence, as she was so innocent and naive on that first date"
Dexter,2t4kwl,TheDuskDragon,3,Wed Jan 21 06:43:07 2015 UTC,I believe he said that about the dress when he was talking to her corpse in the funeral home.
Dexter,2t4kwl,tophOCMC,9,Wed Jan 21 11:52:59 2015 UTC,"You could also argue that the flushed fish coming back up was foreshadowing Dexter's victims ""resurfacing"" from the ocean in season 2."
Dexter,2t4kwl,haxoral,6,Wed Jan 21 04:36:26 2015 UTC,"Same episode, ""storms coming"" said by Harry. Then the finale."
Dexter,2t7eum,ReverendGanja,7,Wed Jan 21 20:02:36 2015 UTC,"I think in season 1 he actually references the original rudy, implying that he did in fact kill him and take his identity."
Dexter,2t7eum,scarlet_overlord,4,Thu Jan 22 23:45:24 2015 UTC,"A good killer knows that he needs to be as inconspicuous as possible. He went to medical school so that he would seem like a nice guy that wanted to help people. Nobody expects a doctor to be a killer. Of course, nobody expected John Wayne Gacy (A Clown) to kill 33 men and boys."
Dexter,2t7eum,iAmMitten1,3,Thu Jan 22 05:39:10 2015 UTC,"Interesting theory, but no. Brian was incredibly intelligent. Not only fooling the police wise, but just general intelligence. Just like Dexter. He told Deb that he studied at the University of Paris, Sorbonne. That's where he learned how to extract blood from his victim's body. Also, you really have to be good at your craft if you want to be hired by a hospital as a prosthetic doctor. It was all part of his great disguise."
Dexter,2t2172,NaSTyNewYawK,14,Tue Jan 20 15:15:45 2015 UTC,"That last look into the camera. You spend the whole time thinking as the lumberjack scene is playing ""What the fuck why the fuck how the fuck"" and then he slowly sits down, gazing out the window. Silent. And then he just looks at the camera like he has done numerous times before, but it's different. Before, it was a confident stare, like ""Yeah, I'm good at what I do."" This last time, it was solidified regret. ""I am where I am because I deserve to be."" For me, out of all the sad moments (Rita dying, letting go of deb, etc) that stare struck me the deepest."
Dexter,2t2172,roak2nd,8,Tue Jan 20 22:22:16 2015 UTC,I don't remember anything besides Deb dying and the Lumberjack. So... the opening credits because that's the last time id ever see it.
Dexter,2t2172,Chiddaling,10,Tue Jan 20 16:47:14 2015 UTC,"""I'm here to kill you with that pen..."" or ""I can't leave you like this. I'm your big brother."""
Dexter,2t2172,Chalky97,27,Tue Jan 20 19:36:07 2015 UTC,The credits
Dexter,2t2172,krashmania,4,Tue Jan 20 15:59:09 2015 UTC,buh dum tsss. except when he burries her (deb) in the ocean shes in white sheets rather than black bags because he killed her as well but she wasnt a douchecunt like the other people he killed.
Dexter,2t2172,SkaJamas,1 point,Tue Jan 20 18:56:38 2015 UTC,"I did like the way they did it, though it didn't really make sense. Why not kill her and leave her in the hospital to be buried with her family? He also didn't weigh her down so she'd sink so her dead body would just wash up and now Batista and Quinn would show up to find her dead body on shore."
Dexter,2t2172,BlindStark,1 point,Fri Jan 23 18:56:20 2015 UTC,Damn you. Beat me to it...
Dexter,2t2172,buckeyenut13,6,Tue Jan 20 21:38:28 2015 UTC,"Just finished a minute ago and still don't know how to feel about this. Deb dying?! Dex leaving Harrison behind?! The last few episodes were showing how Deb could be happy again and how Dex, Harrison, and Hannah could be a normal family and then that shit?! I'm a little angry."
Dexter,2t2172,Caitlyn26,16,Wed Jan 21 06:06:05 2015 UTC,"I gotta say when Dexter, Quinn and Batista were in the room together and were watching how Dexter stabbed a pen in Brain surgeon's neck. Batista was horrified. Quinn was cheering silently. Dexter just sat there not giving a fuck about what they're watching. I liked it.  Other than that, the final moment."
Dexter,2t2172,Dininiful,6,Wed Jan 21 00:49:46 2015 UTC,That was the only moment I enjoyed in the finale. It was a solid send off for Quinn and Dexters relationship
Dexter,2t2172,Khal-Stevo,5,Wed Jan 21 03:13:03 2015 UTC,The part when dexter jumped out of the trunk of the car and got him just as he thought he was going to get away. Also how he finds Rita and Harrison surrounded by her blood coming full circle with his story. Best ending for that show I could have asked for.
Dexter,2t2172,sforero,4,Wed Jan 21 00:58:37 2015 UTC,This one is a bit confused.
Dexter,2t2172,Laktoa,9,Wed Jan 21 01:43:07 2015 UTC,It's meant to be a joke. He's implying that the end of S4 was the end of the show for him
Dexter,2t2172,Holbreon,0,Wed Jan 21 06:52:40 2015 UTC,"Deb's breakdown after killing LaGuerta, then seeing how much the look in her eyes had changed when she was walking back to Batista's party. Seeking his comfort she reached Dexter's hand, and they both walked on together with an uncertain future ahead of them."

Dexter,2szzfe,monkeycycling,3,Tue Jan 20 04:52:51 2015 UTC,This subreddit kind of sucks. Beware.
Dexter,2szzfe,saveusnck,2,Tue Jan 20 22:04:18 2015 UTC,Welcome to Dexter!  I wish I could watch the show for the first time again.  I remember I binge watched the first season in two days.
Dexter,2szzfe,ikevinax,2,Wed Jan 21 19:18:30 2015 UTC,I love seasons 1 and 4 especially.
Dexter,2szzfe,Caitlyn26,1 point,Tue Jan 20 17:09:27 2015 UTC,I personally enjoyed every season and every episode EXECPT for the last episode. Enjoy...I just finished my month long binge.
Dexter,2szzfe,transmogrification,0,Wed Jan 21 06:08:09 2015 UTC,First 4 seasons are fantastic. I think most of us watched all the remaining seasons but you could pretty much skip the last one and save yourself some pain.
Dexter,2szzfe,I_HATE_YOU_SO_MUCH,7,Tue Jan 20 01:24:35 2015 UTC,"I never understood this. Who starts a show and watches the entire thing except for the last season. Even if it's not good you have to respect the show enough if you've watched it that far to at least finish it. Not to mention not even knowing the ending, it's like reading a book and not the last chapter because your friends said they didn't like the ending."
Dexter,2szzfe,iAmMitten1,2,Tue Jan 20 19:20:33 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. I could never start a show, get invested in the characters, and then not see how it wraps up."
Dexter,2szzfe,Giggles_McKing,1 point,Wed Jan 21 01:28:08 2015 UTC,Season 8 honestly isn't as terrible as everyone is making it out to be.
Dexter,2szi3w,astupidwhitekid,6,Mon Jan 19 22:44:48 2015 UTC,"Yes. Just because they're not vocal, doesn't mean they don't exist. I am one of them. This question is asked in this sub about 2 or 3 times a week."
Dexter,2szi3w,astupidwhitekid,1 point,Sat Jan 24 06:59:22 2015 UTC,you can't blame people for asking because the hate on this season is just soo widespread   what did you like about it if I may ask?
Dexter,2szi3w,Zinolium,2,Sat Jan 24 21:41:49 2015 UTC,"I liked everything from season one to season eight. It will always be my favorite TV series of all time. I feel like a lot of people, especially in this sub, complain about the last few seasons and people read it and blindly agree with them. I really liked the main serial killer in season 8 (not gonna say his name, for any spoilers.)   I pretty much loved every second of the show."
Dexter,2szi3w,aimeecat,-1,Sat Jan 24 22:22:32 2015 UTC,I have already watched the show liked it too but I remember S8 being the weakest season and overall just very bad   I don't want to skip it since there is no closure with the S7 ending thats why I'm looking for reasons to like it  so good reasons would be nice
Dexter,2szi3w,mbene913,5,Sat Jan 24 22:40:10 2015 UTC,"The fact that you find out more about Harry and Dexter's history was a plus for me (rewatching it as we speak, just got to season 8). And indeed, at least the final season offers some closure, even if that closure makes you want to put the writers on a table, covered in plastic."
Dexter,2szi3w,aimeecat,6,Mon Jan 19 23:10:26 2015 UTC,Loved it.   Every season pits Dex against an antagonist he must overcome.... in season 8 it was himself.  What better way to finish?
Dexter,2szi3w,420LaysIt,2,Tue Jan 20 14:31:42 2015 UTC,Him dying. Him getting outed.
Dexter,2szi3w,420LaysIt,1 point,Mon Jan 26 04:30:38 2015 UTC,How would they be better? They are basic plot points in what is fundamentally a character driven series.
Dexter,2szi3w,nekotanlol,3,Mon Jan 26 14:36:09 2015 UTC,"I honestly quite enjoyed the last season. Yes, the whole Vogel thing was a bit slow, but apart from that (which admittedly is hard to ignore) I liked it. I can see where the hatred comes from but I just don't tend to have the same gripes with the ending. Sure people didn't like how it ended but the show was never really about being a serial killer without consequences and the idea of everything slowly starting to crumble around him with the ultimatum of him starting a new life made sense, at least to me. This is probably one of my favourite shows and I've re watched it maybe 3-4 times, and I don't think I'll be skipping season 8 anytime soon."
Dexter,2szi3w,ReginaldFarnsworth,1 point,Tue Jan 20 01:58:16 2015 UTC,what did you like about the season if I may ask?
Dexter,2szi3w,RowUrGoat,3,Tue Jan 20 02:25:10 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed Hannah as a character, and I found the plot line of everything starting to fall apart and him realizing he destroys everything he touches made sense to me. The ending just kinda made sense to me, and given the nature of the show I really don't think a happy ending would've made sense."
Dexter,2szi3w,RobMoore,1 point,Tue Jan 20 02:45:31 2015 UTC,Did you enjoy the destruction of Hannah's character into an overly-agreeable ditz?
Dexter,2szi3w,RamiroAuditore,2,Mon Jan 26 02:40:55 2015 UTC,I thought that the scene where Dexter puts Debs body into the ocean was well done. That's about it though. The rest of the episode and most of season 8 was a total mess.
Dexter,2szi3w,flargh86,2,Tue Jan 20 05:39:10 2015 UTC,Loved the finale up until the final 10 minutes
Dexter,2szi3w,DAE_90sKid,2,Tue Jan 20 17:09:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's like the writers is this show and HIMYM were in a contest for who could piss of their fans the most with the last 10 minutes of their shows."

Dexter,2swq6z,Naxxremel,-3,Thu Jan 22 19:37:40 2015 UTC,"Hahahahahahaha, wow.  It's truly fascinating to me how people can get so ridiculously angry over nothing. A pure look into the human condition. The only reason I didn't state the price is because I paid in a different currency and I was on my phone when I replied. I couldn't be bothered to check the difference for US/UK (the probable demographic of this sub) prices so I just dropped the comment, with means to edit in the price later since I'd be at my computer soon.  And then I got your so very helpful comment, so I didn't edit it in.  What a complete cunt you are, sir. I'd tell you that acting like a cunt isn't beneficial to you, but you aren't acting. Have a nice day."
Dexter,2sy18r,southpaw101,5,Mon Jan 19 16:13:33 2015 UTC,The finale isn't bad. It's just the last 11 episodes before it that were really trash.  I honestly think the finale was the only good episode of season 8. The finale had great ideas but they were just executed poorly.
Dexter,2sy18r,dashdashpls,3,Mon Jan 19 17:51:18 2015 UTC,I actually liked it. It kind of made mad but that's what series finales do to ya right? I didn't think season 8 was awful I liked how they made you think the brain surgeon was gone for a few episodes and I was wondering why they weren't building up any drama for the finale then he came right back.
Dexter,2sy18r,magneticfish,2,Mon Jan 19 18:27:53 2015 UTC,... aaand what are your thoughts?
Dexter,2sy18r,runadi,5,Mon Jan 19 17:42:54 2015 UTC,I thought the finale was pretty good it sucks to be done with the show though it was so great
Dexter,2sy18r,ImNotArab27,-1,Mon Jan 19 18:28:24 2015 UTC,really... a lumberjack? you liked it?
Dexter,2sy18r,runadi,1 point,Tue Jan 20 21:28:37 2015 UTC,I just watched the final episode today an thought the lumberjack part was supposed to be symbolism for something initially
Dexter,2sy18r,matttrick,1 point,Wed Jan 21 06:47:50 2015 UTC,yup a lumberjack
Dexter,2sy18r,JF_25,1 point,Thu Jan 22 02:14:57 2015 UTC,He's murdering...trees.
Dexter,2sv465,julianedmonds,29,Sun Jan 18 21:01:06 2015 UTC,"I also viewed the intro as ""This is played before every episode because this is Dexter's exact routine every morning"" because Dexter is the type to have the exact same routine every single day"
Dexter,2sv465,echo_of_silence,8,Sun Jan 18 21:55:38 2015 UTC,"This is true, it shows that he's a guy of routine and almost perfected repetition. But it also mirrors his true self."

Dexter,2sv465,BlindStark,19,Fri Jan 23 19:49:38 2015 UTC,But then there was this one intro when harrison was born wich was totally different. Kinda funny.
Dexter,2sv465,Johgor,9,Sun Jan 18 22:56:02 2015 UTC,I remember that one. What really made that joke for me was the altered music. That alternate intro was very amusing.

Dexter,2sv465,opengrave,4,Mon Jan 19 02:24:22 2015 UTC,"It also represents ability to function (almost) normally. I think its fantastic. All of the symbolism for killing. What I can't seem to put my finger on, is the somewhat quirky music."
Dexter,2sv465,opengrave,3,Mon Jan 19 01:01:31 2015 UTC,I completely agree with you on the music. It doesn't seem to fit Dexter at all but it still just seems right when it goes with the intro. I can't imagine the intro with any other music.
Dexter,2sv465,DueceX,3,Mon Jan 19 02:47:57 2015 UTC,seriously. it's amazing.
Dexter,2sv465,gr8pz,6,Mon Jan 19 03:12:00 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing the mark slightly.   The into is meant to portray the 2 sides of dexter, the refined family man and the killer balancing within. Also I think it portrays his fascination with blood and his separation of him and the rest of the world, he's always there smiling and waiting."
Dexter,2sv465,sky4,9,Mon Jan 19 00:12:53 2015 UTC,There are many interpretations; it doesn't mean one is wrong compared to another.
Dexter,2swp2f,crackkfoxx,3,Mon Jan 19 05:39:56 2015 UTC,"Lazy end to one of my favourite series of all time. Lumberjack completely out of the blue, Dexter turning off Deb's life support is also somewhat out of character.  Season 8 felt rushed in comparison with all others, the ending was no different. Ultimately a very disappointing end to an otherwise great show."
Dexter,2swp2f,pink_azalea,1 point,Mon Jan 19 23:37:39 2015 UTC,"Well earlier in the show, Deb says to Dexter that if she were ever on life support to ""pull the plug"". She didn't want to just lay around and be a vegetable, and I don't blame her."
Dexter,2swp2f,Subulie3,2,Thu Jan 22 15:34:53 2015 UTC,But everyone loved the finale when it aired...
Dexter,2swp2f,Chalky97,4,Mon Jan 19 06:35:55 2015 UTC,"I found Deb's death so much more sad than Rita's. Overtime Deb became a favourite character and to see her die just hurt quite a bit. But, in my opinion, you couldn't really have Dexter run away to become a lumberjack and still have Debra alive. It wouldn't feel right. I would've been a lot happier if Dexter had died just for that sense of closure."

I knew that there was never going to be a happy ending for Dexter. It just wasn't possible. It's a tragic, depressing ending, but that's what had to happen. His dark passenger was never going to leave him and it only brought bad things to the people around him. Dexter himself never was directly effected, but everyone else was. I'm glad that Dexter is out there somewhere as a sexy lumberjack instead of in prison."
Dexter,2ssp4d,rorschach8989,49,Sun Jan 18 03:07:46 2015 UTC,have her replace Harry as part of Dexters inner monologue
Dexter,2ssp4d,handsthefram,17,Sun Jan 18 03:13:51 2015 UTC,"I like this, but I think she should be with, not replacing, Harry. I actually think she should be Dexter's conscience, to balance out the Dark Passenger.  After all, we know that Dexter isn't as feeling less as he (or we) used to think; and I think Deb really manifests that very well. So you could have Harry and Deb disagreeing about what Dexter should do. ( Maybe some comic relief with Deb getting really pissed at Brian/Dark Passenger)"
Dexter,2ssp4d,PiTheKhoz,5,Sun Jan 18 07:32:09 2015 UTC,What? All his victims could have a party in his head. A multiple personality disorder serial killer.
Dexter,2ssp4d,azoolie,2,Sun Jan 18 19:31:19 2015 UTC,"That doesn't sound like too bad of an idea.  It would be an even more broken Dexter, we would see him really conflicted about whatever he's doing by having 3 different perspectives either brainstorming or arguing about his next move. I would like to see a very unstable Dexter Morgan."
Dexter,2ssp4d,Slaytounge,11,Sun Jan 18 09:39:34 2015 UTC,"She's Debra Fuckin' Morgan, she just fucking will!"

Dexter,2ssp4d,BlindStark,2,Sun Jan 18 03:39:35 2015 UTC,They replace Dexter with Deb.  Debster then becomes the hash slinging slasher.
Dexter,2srb88,Tugga,39,Sat Jan 17 19:27:22 2015 UTC,"They hinted early on in the show that he was a ""dirty cop"", which usually implies that they sell out to criminals."
Dexter,2srb88,therus,24,Sat Jan 17 19:45:49 2015 UTC,Yep. That and the time Dexter watched him steal cash from the evidence locker.
Dexter,2srb88,TinyFluffyMagda,18,Sat Jan 17 20:27:45 2015 UTC,Actual it was from a crime scene. Quinn only gave up half of what he found to evidence from the safe
Dexter,2srb88,XA36,16,Sat Jan 17 21:17:33 2015 UTC,And Dexter tells him he doesn't care if he's a dirty cop and he gets all butthurt
Dexter,2srb88,Zykium,10,Sat Jan 17 22:18:33 2015 UTC,Then he makes it his job to shit on Dexter.  I SMELL A DOAKS 2.0
Dexter,2srb88,peacecake,7,Sat Jan 17 22:33:53 2015 UTC,It would have been great for Quinn to have found out and just doesn't give a fuck.
Dexter,2srb88,GeneSplice,2,Sun Jan 18 00:48:58 2015 UTC,"But at the same time, realistically him and doaks are cops doing what they do (besides Quinn being dirty), so you gotta feel bad for these guys just doing their job.  Then BOOM. Propane explosion"

Dexter,2srfb8,Breaking_Dexter25,2,Sun Jan 18 05:23:54 2015 UTC,"That's kinda true. He attacked Dexter, but I don't think he was a serious threat."
Dexter,2srfb8,dvfsz,2,Sun Jan 18 05:37:49 2015 UTC,"I really liked the series. I agree there were story lines that could have been much greater. I didn't really like Zack, but Isacc would have been such a nice story for season 7. I really liked Miguel and his story. He was one of my favorite characters."
Dexter,2srfb8,xerophyl,1 point,Sun Jan 18 07:10:23 2015 UTC,I completely agree with you on the season 2 manhunt. I would have liked that story line to be the season 8 arc. It was really well done and resulted in my personal favorite season of Dexter.
Dexter,2srfb8,Cardbox,1 point,Sun Jan 18 07:44:59 2015 UTC,"They tried too hard to make him human and then instantly regretted their decision. I fucking loved how he killed that innocent guy in season three. And then they just left that arc, it made me very sad."
Dexter,2srfb8,ForumMMX,1 point,Sun Jan 18 16:55:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I totally agree with you on the last point. Dexter did the wrong move . Also, won't Harrison get pretty screwed up with losing his dad too?"
Dexter,2srfb8,Presto-Manifesto,1 point,Mon Jan 19 07:08:23 2015 UTC,"About your last point, the thing is he knew he didn't have to be a serial killer and said, standing over Rita and Deb's bodies both times, that he would take it all back if he could. He knew it was his fault that they were ever put in that situation in the first place because he chose to be a killer (even though he didn't ask to be made into a killer; that's the sad part.)"
Dexter,2sp5wg,Tugga,16,Sat Jan 17 02:58:39 2015 UTC,"Just loved that Edward James Olmos was in it. The big plot twist with him and Travis caught me off guard, although I probably should have seen it coming. An underrated season for sure since everybody says stop after season 4."
Dexter,2sp5wg,nicolauz,2,Sat Jan 17 04:59:01 2015 UTC,"My gf guessed it like 2 episodes in.  It's pretty obvious he doesn't interact or no one interacts with him, only the killer."
Dexter,2sp5wg,luxandlumens,4,Sun Jan 18 03:02:11 2015 UTC,"I absolutely loved Colin Hanks. Never saw the plot twist with Gellar coming - in hindsight, and through rewatches, it's so obvious, but I was completely blindsided the first time I watched through. I actually loved Brian/Rudy in Nebraska. ITK was my favorite villain, and the relationship between Dex and Brian is something I wish could have been explored more.  I did feel that there was way too much religion being shoved down my throat. I was fine with it as a theme and thought it was interesting watching Dexter try to rationalize his code with Brother Sam's religion, but I felt it was a little over kill."
Dexter,2sp5wg,TheExtremistModerate,1 point,Sat Jan 17 15:43:42 2015 UTC,"in hindsight, and through rewatches, it's so obvious, but I was completely blindsided the first time I watched through   That's the perfect kind of twist. If it's too easy to spot, you catch it on your first run-through and lose the surprise. If it's too hard to spot, with almost no foreshadowing, then it's kind of like deus ex machina (but for twists, not solutions to problems)."
Dexter,2sp5wg,stinkyxxchickenfeet,7,Sat Jan 17 17:22:45 2015 UTC,"I liked it too, especially Mos Def's role as a troubled but enlightened man, working to redeem himself and turn his life into something positive. And even though I'm not a big fan of Colin Hanks, I thought he worked well in his part, and nothing tickles me more than greeting my bf on the phone with a chilling deadpan ""Hello whore."""
Dexter,2sp5wg,dvfsz,6,Sat Jan 17 06:28:51 2015 UTC,"I absolutely loved season 6. Honestly I loved every season except season 8. Doesn't meant I hated it though. I liked 8, but it obviously isn't like the other seasons. Six is my 3rd favorite though, after 4 and 1."
Dexter,2sp5wg,xxThe_Artist,2,Sat Jan 17 07:06:00 2015 UTC,I agree. 8 was pretty much a weak season from episode 1. 6 is very underrated. And I think 7 was great until they killed off Isaac. Definitely thought he should have been the focus for the entire season.
Dexter,2sp5wg,dvfsz,2,Sat Jan 17 12:34:36 2015 UTC,"Isaac would have been such a good character IMO. He had potential to be like Arthur Mitchell, only with more power. I would have loved to see how him and Dexter would face off."
Dexter,2sp5wg,Dr_Toast,1 point,Sat Jan 17 19:02:25 2015 UTC,"This is where I would rank 6 as well, a great supporting cast (Edward James Olmos, Colin Hanks, and Mos Def) really help this season shine."
Dexter,2sp5wg,HarlyRoper23,8,Sat Jan 17 19:09:06 2015 UTC,Agreed. Underrated season for me. Loved how all of Travis' killings with Bible like.
Dexter,2sp5wg,TheExtremistModerate,3,Sat Jan 17 04:27:21 2015 UTC,"I really liked 6. It's my 3rd favorite season. I thought Colin Hanks was terrific. I didn't see the twist coming until right before it happened. And I loved the exploration of faith with Dexter.  Also, Travis was a really unique nemesis at the time. Sure, all of his nemeses had to have been mentally off in order to be serial killers i nthe first place, but they all seemed to be in control of themselves. But Travis didn't even know he was the one killing them. And that added a new level of insanity and unpredictability which I thought was really entertaining."
Dexter,2sp5wg,prestico23,3,Sat Jan 17 17:20:17 2015 UTC,"I won't go as far as to say I loved it but I would agree that it's criminally underrated. I thought it was better than 5 and 8, and just about on par with 3. It didn't hurt that I didn't watch it as it was airing and thus the big plot twist was a complete surprise."
Dexter,2sp5wg,LeeCarvallo,2,Sat Jan 17 05:01:12 2015 UTC,As one of the people who didn't see the plot coming I enjoyed the heck out of it. Nebraska was one of my favorite episodes. I liked it more than 5 for sure
Dexter,2sp5wg,zsombro,1 point,Sat Jan 17 09:46:34 2015 UTC,I didn't think it was as bad as people make it out to be. Edward James Olmos would have made a much better main villain though.
Dexter,2sp5wg,nuggetinabuiscuit,1 point,Sat Jan 17 10:56:20 2015 UTC,"Travis (DDK) is such an underrated Dexter antagonist. I'm glad someone agrees with me here. However, I have to disagree with your nebraska episode thoughts. I'm really glad they brought back Brian. He made me crack up a couple time too."
Dexter,2sn5dz,CG1991,15,Fri Jan 16 16:49:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think I made that connection, but that is nice. I still think it was horribly executed, but at least they threw that in."
Dexter,2sn5dz,Starburstnova,3,Fri Jan 16 18:22:42 2015 UTC,I completely agree. Terribly done; hence finding the need to have it justified.  Great telelvision doesn't need justification. I just thought it was a neat little detail
Dexter,2sn5dz,turntechDestiel,18,Fri Jan 16 18:58:12 2015 UTC,"Might sound stupid, but I thought that was the best part of it. He threw her in the ocean. He left her with all of his other victims, because that's exactly what she was. She died because of him, and as a way to punish himself, he made himself watch her sink like all of his other victims."

Dexter,2sn5dz,Chalky97,1 point,Fri Jan 16 19:21:15 2015 UTC,"Weird was always safe, deviating from the ritual is what fucked everything up almost every time, I choose to view it as a conscious decision,  a personal correction,  deviating from the ritual messed him up so many times.  This is a major leap but perhaps he feels if he never strayed from the original plan or tried to modify it then things would have ended differently and he's showing Deb respect by returning to the ritual instead of altering it... again."
Dexter,2sn5dz,Pointwest418,1 point,Fri Jan 16 19:26:43 2015 UTC,"Throwing people in the ocean is the only way Dexter has ever been comfortable with death. Dexter throwing Debra in the sea was his way of coping. It's fucked up, yes, but the whole show already established that Dexter is a fucked up guy."
Dexter,2sn5dz,Jimmith3eo,2,Sat Jan 17 01:27:24 2015 UTC,There are a lot of things that make sense. Dexter constantly voiced his fear that the only way Debra and Harrison and Rita will be safe is if he abandons them and exiles himself

Dexter,2sl07c,nuggetinabuiscuit,3,Fri Jan 16 19:55:54 2015 UTC,I feel like a format like The Wire would work great for Dexter. Half of the show being focused on him killing and half of the show focused on the detective force hunting for him. It would be like what season 8 of Dexter should have been.

Dexter,2sl07c,YellowThread,2,Tue Jan 20 02:26:43 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who feels like a spin off of show focusing on the original show's titular character isn't a spin off but just a continuation of the original show.
Dexter,2sl07c,Neitling,2,Fri Jan 16 20:33:46 2015 UTC,Yup. That's no different than a new season of 24 that has a new cast.

Dexter,2s9ni7,Hallager98,3,Tue Jan 13 10:02:00 2015 UTC,"Just recently watched all seasons but my memory is really sucky. I'll do my best:  1: Dexter is taught his code from his Dad, Harry. He learns he has a biological brother that also witnessed the death of his mother, who I'm sure had a name. It fucked them both up. His brother became the ""Ice truck killer"", dated Debra and tried to kill her. Dexter was forced to chose; his sister or his brother. He obviously chose his sister.  2: Rita (his girlfriend) starts getting suspicious about Dex's behavior. He blames it on a drug addiction, then he meets the hell spawn that is Lila. They start dating, Rita finds out. The police find out about Dexter's murders and creates a ""Bay Harbour Butcher"" identity for it. Doakes get's suspicious which leads to Dexter capturing him and Lila killing him.  Dexter kills Lila. Doakes gets framed as the Butcher.  *  *  *  *  SPOILERS BELOW, SRY OP LOL  3: Dexter starts questioning the code he was taught from Harry. Tries to patch up his relationship with Rita. Makes a friend, Miguel, after killing his brother. Dexter makes Miguel a companion, then their relationship is broken when Miguel kills to save his ass, and not by  a code. I dunno. Dexter marries Rita.  Beginning of 4: Dexter gets sloppy, loses a body. Probably kills some more."

""The novel concludes as the Cult of Moloch kidnaps Astor and Cody, thereby forcing Dexter to engage them head-on. However, the cult soon captures Dexter through a supernatural captivation of music. Though confined in a small concrete storage closet, Dexter escapes and encounters an old man who is the current avatar of Moloch. Though Dexter is instantly humbled and frightened of Moloch, he continuously mocks the malignant spirit, which in turn entrances him and the children and orders them to be sacrificed in a flaming pit.""

Dexter,2s4tzl,Kishoto,1 point,Mon Jan 12 17:23:23 2015 UTC,"While the concept is right, the mentoring, I'm not sure Zach was the right character to take after Dexter. Dexter was an innocent.

Dexter,2s4tzl,azoolie,2,Mon Jan 12 19:00:32 2015 UTC,"Well, while I agree him killing off his parental figures wasn't good, he also hasn't had a Harry in his life.

Dexter,2rytev,TheStabbingHobo,8,Sat Jan 10 16:03:30 2015 UTC,I think that would've been better off than the finale they aired.
Dexter,2rytev,unrecoverable1,2,Sun Jan 11 07:27:06 2015 UTC,"One way to look at it is that Dexter is always worried about, or even resigned to the fate of eventually getting caught and eventually executed, but throughout the series the exact opposite happens. People who went against him like Doakes, LaGuerta, Louis - all dead (highly abridged list there), and he didn't even kill those 3.  But worst of all, everyone who actually loves and/or cares about Dexter are the ones who get hurt or killed as well.   *Here's a quote from the movie Legends of the Fall about the main character that may be relevant:    I thought Tristan would never live to be an old man. I was wrong about that. I was wrong about many things. It was those who loved him most who died young. He was a rock they broke themselves against however much he tried to protect them."

I'm now in the process of wiping season 8 from my memory, and I recently rewatched Dexter up to season 7 and accepted that as the end of the series.

Dexter,2rxvdd,azoolie,1 point,Sat Jan 10 07:11:41 2015 UTC,"I noticed this on my first or second viewing. I thought it was part of the structure of the show. Also there was usually a cliffhanger on each odd episode, making them essentially 2 hour shows.  Those things didn't hold up well in later seasons. I wished it was true because it really helped absorb the story."

Dexter,2rxhy3,TheRealRacker,19,Sat Jan 10 03:35:00 2015 UTC,"Debra's pretty clingy. It's because Harry essentially ignored her so that he could train Dexter instead of be a father to her. Her mom also died. So she grew up very alone. Remember her birthday scene, or the flashbacks to her as a kid bitching about Harry always taking Dexter on hunting trips? And on top of that, her fiance was the ice truck killer and Trinity's daughter killed her boyfriend. She is super fucked up.   And then after Harry died, Dexter was all she had. Dexter is STILL all she has. Dexter realizes this, so he feels bad about ignoring her all the time. He doesn't tell her to leave him alone because he knows that she deserves him to pay attention to her.   Keep watching. Something happens that makes it all make more sense.   I didn't like Debra at first either but eventually I realized what complicated character she is. She acts really tough on the outside because she has to be...she's damaged and vulnerable on the inside. Anyone who doesn't want to just hug her really hard would have to be a psychopath like Dexter."

He can't push her away in any way, because she's the living link to his past. He has no idea how to treat a sister, and his constant improvisation when it comes to Deb is his biggest danger. The issue is that he's never pushed her away before, and he knows she'll spy on him to figure out any sudden change in behavior. My take, at least."

Dexter,2rp51h,daveyandgoliath,24,Thu Jan 8 17:47:12 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think Monk could catch Dexter.   If anything I want to say this would be a Monk episode where Monk already knows who the real killer is, but just needs proof for everyone to believe him.   Could monk find this proof? Oh sure. It's all over the place. It might take a little digging but I am sure monk could find it.   But herein lies the problem. Monk couldn't do any digging around about Dexter or his crimes without Dexter knowing. This is one of the greatest strengths that Dexter has going for him. He is smack dab in the middle of the police force.   Not to mention Dexter's own skills of observation. Dexter will know what Monk is doing in a matter of minutes.   The question is, what does Dexter do if he knows a legitimate detective who could catch him is after him?   Well Dexter has a few tricks up his sleeve when it comes to this, but I truly feel that Dexter is smart enough to figure out how to get Monk off the trail without blowing him up in a shed by the swamp. (heh heh)  Dexter would just play up to Monk's phobias and whatnot. He would use it to his advantage. Want to find the blood slides, sure thing Monk... it's right over here next to all of these unclean needles. Just dig through it, I'm sure you will find them sooner or later.    I am reminded of a Monk episode where someone convinced monk that a person had faked their own death and were really alive. Normally Monk would have seen right through this rouse, however this guy told monk he had leprosy... And monk refused to go near him. Without being close to the person and using his awesome observational powers, even Monk was convinced temporarily.    I think this is what Dexter would do. Dexter loves throwing people off the scent, it's something he is good at and has a lot of experience with.   Would Monk be able to figure it out? Yeah. Very easily. Probably before he even had any concrete evidence. I love it when Monk points at some random nice person 10 minutes into an episode and says, ""Yep, that's the guy."" Despite ALWAYS being right before no one believes him until 30 minutes later when Monk monologues one piece of random evidence and it all falls into place.   But, could Monk catch Dexter? I doubt it. By the time Dex is finished with him, Monk would be crying in a corner covered in wet naps and hand sanitizer.   Edited: for humor and clarity."
Dexter,2rp51h,Sillycomic,6,Thu Jan 8 08:09:39 2015 UTC,This would've been the perfect final season.
Dexter,2rp51h,TheAlexBasso,2,Thu Jan 8 20:25:27 2015 UTC,"I agree so much friend.   I actually thought this is where they were going with the final season in that first episode. When we first met Dr. Vogel I thought pretty much that the final season would be a battle between Dexter and someone who has figured him out and just needs to find proof for it.   It made me so happy, because it would be closing and dealing with a lot of loose ends of the other seasons and honestly bring a smart and dependable rival to Dexter, which he has been sorely lacking since around season 4 or so.   But no, Vogel turned out to be Dexter's Mommy, and with that the rest just went downhill from there.   Actually, I still haven't finished watching the last season. I think I stopped right after Debra tried to kill Dexter by plunging her car into a lake... I was pretty much done at that point."
Dexter,2rp51h,Sillycomic,1 point,Fri Jan 9 18:23:55 2015 UTC,Just don't watch the last episode
Dexter,2rp51h,LogicalEmotion7,2,Thu Jan 22 03:51:48 2015 UTC,"Monk would figure him out easy, but Dexter would kill him. I agree."
Dexter,2rp51h,qwedswerty,4,Thu Jan 8 19:36:09 2015 UTC,"Dexter can't kill him. Doesn't fit the code. He'd be paralyzed by the two greatest rules of the code, just like he was with Doakes."
Dexter,2rp51h,Bad_Auk,15,Thu Jan 8 20:03:51 2015 UTC,Dexter relies on the ineptitude of the miami Police department a lot. Agent Mundey comes close to catching him several times. Any TV detective would have a good chance I think.
Dexter,2rp51h,Andrado,31,Thu Jan 8 03:25:36 2015 UTC,Lundy?
Dexter,2rp51h,Bad_Auk,37,Thu Jan 8 04:08:39 2015 UTC,I love my mistake so much I won't even edit it.
Dexter,2rp51h,LeeCarvallo,10,Thu Jan 8 04:21:25 2015 UTC,That's his name! I've been calling him cucumbers & cream cheese for like 2 years.
Dexter,2rp51h,TheBelgianBrawler,10,Thu Jan 8 05:55:49 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, Shawn Spencer from Psych would have solved any of his murders before lunch as well. Would concur that pretty much any truly competent detective would have figured out Dexter's MO pretty fast."
Dexter,2rp51h,SkaJamas,9,Thu Jan 8 04:06:29 2015 UTC,finding the proof might be harder. and Shawn would probably get himself killed because hes always going in alone or off the books. and im fairly sure he'd just run and scream eh so maybe he might survive lol
Dexter,2rp51h,TheBelgianBrawler,4,Thu Jan 8 05:57:32 2015 UTC,Yeah but just imagine the hilarious Gus comments that could be made in he intervening time. I think it'd be worth it.
Dexter,2rp51h,SkaJamas,3,Thu Jan 8 06:43:53 2015 UTC,this has got to happen

Dexter,2rp51h,qwedswerty,6,Thu Jan 8 14:23:44 2015 UTC,Patrick Jane takes one look: That man is a sociopat and a serial killer.  Different police shows have different kinds of villians. Dexter is a perfect villian for Patrick Jane to catch!
Dexter,2rp51h,nchasz_96,5,Thu Jan 8 20:02:16 2015 UTC,kinda hard to solve a murder if you're dead (RIP Liddy)
Dexter,2rp51h,animallover2472004,4,Thu Jan 8 04:20:43 2015 UTC,I've always wondered things like this. Could the BAU on Criminal Minds Catch him?  EDIT: I apparently can't type. BAU not BUI. Duh.

Dexter,2rp51h,YoungDeebzy91,2,Thu Jan 8 20:14:47 2015 UTC,I wonder if Rust and Marty from True Detective would be able to track Dexter down?
Dexter,2rp51h,arodhowe,1 point,Thu Jan 8 15:09:11 2015 UTC,"Monk wouldn't have caught Dexter, but I think Rust from True Detective would have, especially if there were 8 years of missing persons to rifle through in a massive investigation. He also would have been able to mentally profile the killer to being someone involved with the justice system quickly after seeing the whole ""victims were all people who fell through the cracks"" thread.  Unless Rust has a personal interaction with Dexter. Then Dexter would have hallucinated Harry, who would be all ""I taught you how to preserve yourself, but this is a cop, Dex."" Then Dex would have captured and killed him just as he's about to arrest Dex without any backup, for no goddamned reason."
Dexter,2ro4pj,x24x,10,Wed Jan 7 21:23:24 2015 UTC,"Mmm, I'm not sure if any specific clip can really show what the show's about.  For me, episode 1 alone was enough to get me hooked. I loved it from the first minute."

I would maybe intersplice some scenes of Dexter killing people in between, (not major ones of course). Ie ""Drained him of his blood,"" show Dexter plunging his knife into someone and the blood spreading through the plastic wrap; ""Way to take out the trash,"" show Dexter putting dismembered body parts into trash bags, then placing them in his trunk or throwing them overboard"

Dexter,2ro4pj,ChagSC,0,Thu Jan 8 03:43:38 2015 UTC,"There is a reason why the chose to open with this scene.  While I don't think it completely shows Dexter's character (nor could it, really), as he typically isn't that angry; it does however immediately show the viewer that even though he is a self proclaimed monster, he would never do anything horrible like murder children.    It sets the tone very early that Dexter is a vigilante.  He may be crazy, but he is not the one you should be afraid of, unless you deserve it.  It sort of puts you on his team right away, even though he is a serial killer."

Dexter,2rm801,pandarann,3,Wed Jan 7 12:12:56 2015 UTC,"Doesn't fit the code in the sense that he isn't a murderer (that we know of) and will very likely lead back to him. Not that he would get caught, but Dexter do not want any such attention. Every time he is the suspect in a murder investigation is one step closer to people realising. Rita would probably be worried if he just dispeared, etc."

Dexter,2rkzvk,Tugga,8,Wed Jan 7 02:08:32 2015 UTC,Quinn develops a lot more and becomes a much better character in season 7 especially imo.

Dexter,2rkzvk,velocity92c,5,Wed Jan 7 02:17:28 2015 UTC,Season 3 is great (make sure to finish it) and Season 4 is pretty much the undisputed best season of Dexter. You're in for a treat getting to watch them both for the first time.
Dexter,2rkzvk,qwedswerty,1 point,Wed Jan 7 03:45:30 2015 UTC,Undisputed? Really? Is it even the most popular season? I would've guessed season 1.

Dexter,2rkzvk,superbek,2,Fri Jan 9 23:56:19 2015 UTC,Season three was personally my second favorite season. Miguel was a great opponent for Dexter. I am currently rewatching the series and am on season 2. I  am really exited to get to season 3. And Quinn will be important. You just wait. And season 4 is the best season in the series. You'll love it.

Dexter,2rgh3q,todd330,6,Tue Jan 6 12:14:12 2015 UTC,"This was a really good episode, no doubt. My favorite; however, is the episode when Dexter kills his brother, Brian Moser. It was really emotional and if it's your first time watching the series you really get to appreciate Dexter's display of emotion in that episode. You can tell he is genuinely saddened by killing his brother off. To complement that episode, it was really nice bringing Brian back toward the end of the series when Dexter is so conflicted with his life choices and Brian is there as the ""evil angel"" on his shoulder telling him to mess everything up and in that same episode its where Dexter has some final closure with Brian."

Dexter,2rfq20,escaped_reddit,2,Thu Jan 8 18:44:25 2015 UTC,I read somewhere that he was supposed to be in more episodes but due to scheduling conflict with Thor his role was cut short. which was total bullshit because he had like 5 lines and 7 minutes of screen time in that movie.
Dexter,2rfq20,Lucidleaf,6,Tue Jan 6 00:40:56 2015 UTC,I liked the bay harbor butcher 😏
Dexter,2rfq20,Weltall548,5,Tue Jan 6 10:35:24 2015 UTC,"Brian Moser (ITK) was by far my favourite. He had such a good backstory, a great cover personality (as Rudy Cooper) and a really deadly serial killer. I kinda felt sorry for him at the end, all that work just to reunite him with his brother, and Dexter just kills him. A shame, I wish Dexter spared Brian and he would come back in a later season."
Dexter,2rfq20,gnasher5,4,Tue Jan 6 04:40:19 2015 UTC,"Probably Isaak Sirko. He says in one episode something along the lines of ""Under different circumstances I think we would be good friends"" and I would've loved them to be mates. Isaak is such an interesting character, one of my favourites."
Dexter,2rfq20,nuggetinabuiscuit,2,Tue Jan 6 17:06:25 2015 UTC,Dexter.
Dexter,2re1on,alphadog3939,17,Mon Jan 5 10:08:44 2015 UTC,Miguel gave dexter the bloody shirt with the pretext that it was freebo's blood on Miguel's shirt so that it could be used to connect Miguel to the murder. It was kind of an assurance that Miguel wouldn't turn dexter in. If the blood is fake then that was all just a trick.
Dexter,2re1on,Dukeee03,13,Mon Jan 5 11:12:41 2015 UTC,He lied. Then he broke the code and killed Hellen Wolf.

Dexter,2re1on,Robin_TheBoyWonder,6,Mon Jan 5 21:35:54 2015 UTC,"Dexter discovered many lies by Miguel in a row. He told other people's stories, gave the same compliments to Rita and himself, he then goes to check the shirt, which isn't even human blood.  They had been fighting with eachother for some time before this, but it mostly (atleast to me) seemed like something that grew overtime because of ""philosophical differences"". However, with this discovery, we know for certain that Miguel was playing Dexter all the way from the start, long before any cracks in their friendship."
Dexter,2re1on,qwedswerty,6,Mon Jan 5 13:32:33 2015 UTC,"Miguel did use Dexter. Dexter has every right to feel like he was used in this situation.  Dexter  taught Miguel all of his skills with the intent of Miguel only using the code: only killing people who have killed before and will kill again and you can get away with it. There are other parts to the code but these are the fundamental aspects.    Miguel learns the code and promises to follow all of dexters instructions. But then decides to go kill that Wolf lawyer.   She does not match dexters code description in any way. Plus Miguel is too close to her. And on top of that dexter specifically told Miguel that Wolf was off limits.   Miguel does it anyway.   This is a violation for dexter on so many levels, but the biggest one is that dexter no longer has a partner and a friend.   Season 3 was all about dexter having a friend who embraced all of him, even his dark passenger. Because of Harry's code Dexter was sure he had to be alone in his hunting. Thanks to learning a few things about his father, dexter decides he can bend the code a little bit to have a friend.   Then Miguel goes and breaks promises, kills on his own and has no remorse. Dexter finds it a betrayal to his budding friendship, but also realized that Harry was right. The code is the only thing keeping dexter alive so he has to keep following it. He can't throw the code away because he feels lonely."
Dexter,2re1on,Sillycomic,1 point,Mon Jan 5 19:08:12 2015 UTC,"If you're asking those kinds of questions, you might want to rewatch at least part of S3, maybe episode 1&2 and then like 7 through 11 again.   Without any spoilers, you should try to pay more attention to Season 4, because there is a lot of amazing plot and it's one of the favorites amongst fans of the show."

It does start a bit slow (first one follows the books pretty closely), but I believe by 5 if you're not into it, you likely won't be ever. On the other hand it might just be worth finishing out the season, because why not at this point.     Also: I'm not a cop, but do you think the reason the show seems so drab to you is because you are a serial killer?  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

I think every season should be watched once, there is some cool stuff in season 5 with Dexter, but some of it feels like filler, kind of a rehash of the other seasons.  i would say watching the first 3 episodes of season 5 would tell you if it is worth it or not."
Dexter,2r5bgk,TheHellFish,5,Fri Jan 2 23:05:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'd be okay with it. Well, more than okay.  Was he admitting he had been in love with her too? Well, that's entirely a matter of opinion but I like to think that he meant it that way. What was the intention of the writers? I have no idea. Actually, I have no idea what their intentions were at any point of that damn final season.  If you don't mind reading (and even if you do), try this fanfic, it's the best one out there and there's a good chance you'll like it."

Dexter,2r5bgk,rhcp88,1 point,Sat Jan 3 10:37:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's anything but short, but there was no way around it considering how much of a mess was season 8 and all the side characters (which needed to be given more depth). Also the author, who's about to publish a second book, wrote it more like a novel, which added to the length, but made the fanfic stand out thanks to complexity of the plot and amazing descriptions. And honestly, if you really like it, you'll be craving more after you read it all anyway, no matter how long the story is. :)  And for me, this is canon, not that stupidity that is called the 'real' season 8."

Dexter,2r1gi0,Jowsten,1 point,Thu Jan 1 22:48:22 2015 UTC,Deb got worse and worse. Some people will like her in the later seasons but I found her to be more annoying and bitchy
Dexter,2r1gi0,upsided0wnn,1 point,Fri Jan 2 02:36:05 2015 UTC,I think she gets worse. She says fuck more and more.
Dexter,2r1gi0,Weltall548,0,Sun Jan 4 00:16:35 2015 UTC,She gets hotter as the seasons go on. Is that a good answer?
Dexter,2r1gi0,spencc1996,-3,Fri Jan 2 00:06:52 2015 UTC,"Women, amirite fellas!?!"
Dexter,2r1gi0,ccc66,-1,Fri Jan 2 00:44:56 2015 UTC,I also started binge watching Dexter. I'm up to season six and she is still annoying. I have grown to dislike Dexter and his selfish serial killer ways. But I guess that's how you're to feel.  I just found out an hour ago that Deb and Dexter were married. But that is a southern United States thing right.
Dexter,2r1gi0,Etobocoke,3,Fri Jan 2 04:09:43 2015 UTC,The people who played those roles were married...
Dexter,2r2j58,LivingLikeLogan,5,Fri Jan 2 04:25:03 2015 UTC,"It's just vandalism, she isn't. Also I wouldn't recommend reading the wikis if you're only on season 2, I mean do what you'd like but I really messed up the show for me by doing that. :("
Dexter,2r2j58,rainbows-eat-socks,1 point,Fri Jan 2 05:07:51 2015 UTC,Ok. I probably stop browsing the wiki. Thank you for the response :)
Dexter,2r2j58,Goatsac,2,Fri Jan 2 05:42:22 2015 UTC,This is why wikipedia is a joke.
Dexter,2r1lvw,Scook98,4,Thu Jan 1 22:54:49 2015 UTC,"I have read a couple. They are good and entertaining but a difference you will see is sometimes Dexter sounds arrogant in the books where Michael Hall makes him very likable. Also the books have the same characters, but completely different story lines/fates than the show."
Dexter,2r1lvw,Mode09,6,Thu Jan 1 23:06:40 2015 UTC,"They're different but I enjoyed them. The first book follows the first season but after that they diverge. Book-Dexter is more of a psychopath. He's more gleeful with the killing. Brian doesn't die. Cody shows signs of psychopathy and Dexter is teaching him. I like those differences. The writing is sometimes amateurish and the book explanation of the Dark Passenger is ridiculous and terrible and made me want to throw something. I don't overall regret reading them, though. They got me through a couple summers between seasons."
Dexter,2r1lvw,Psychopath-,1 point,Thu Jan 1 23:13:51 2015 UTC,I've only read the first two books and they were pretty good. I wouldn't say they are better than season 1 or 4 of Dexter but definitely are better than the seasons after 4. I don't really think it's 100% necessary to read the first book as it is very identical to the 1 season with a few minor changes but you can.
Dexter,2r1lvw,ICookTheBlueStuff,1 point,Fri Jan 2 00:52:30 2015 UTC,"Well I think it's worth the read, regardless, just so that you don't end up confused at the start of the second one. I think it's a relatively short book too, if I remember correctly"
Dexter,2r1lvw,PiTheKhoz,1 point,Fri Jan 2 03:21:03 2015 UTC,They are definitely worth reading if you enjoyed the show

Dexter,2qve4x,ohwowcanyounot,28,Wed Dec 31 00:59:39 2014 UTC,Kind of sad how he's basically just there to deal with the tangent plot with his daughter in S8. :|
Dexter,2qve4x,YourMe,7,Wed Dec 31 01:06:15 2014 UTC,"I know this is pretty bizarre, but I've only watched seasons 1 and 8... I loved the first season, but got partway through season 2 and just felt like something was missing. But I still wanted to see how the show ended, so I read Wikipedia summaries for the seasons in between.  Was there any real reason that they introduced the subplot with Masuka's daughter? Because watching season 8, it seemed really... forced. It felt like they just needed to fill up some time in each episode."
Dexter,2qve4x,ohwowcanyounot,5,Wed Dec 31 06:34:37 2014 UTC,"You should watch seasons 2,3 and 4 seriously. You can stop after that lol it goes down hill. You're right, it was forced (for other fillers?) they ran out of shit to do the last seasons."
Dexter,2qve4x,YourMe,2,Wed Dec 31 06:48:00 2014 UTC,"I've heard that a lot!! I think I'll give it another shot one of these days :) I'm not quite sure why season 2 felt so different to me; I guess because the first season had source material maybe?  I also seriously hated the Zach subplot... or at least how it ended. I thought he was pretty cool and tried to predict all sorts of crazy possibilities with his character, and then they  just trashed the character for no reason. Ugh."
Dexter,2qve4x,somewherein72,2,Wed Dec 31 06:56:55 2014 UTC,"Trust me, season 2 gets soooo good near the end though! Yeah they did that :/"
Dexter,2qve4x,mikeramey1,1 point,Wed Dec 31 07:03:47 2014 UTC,"Nah, it was pretty much pointless and took him away from being more of a part/say in the main plot scenes. Was kind of dumb. :/"
Dexter,2qve4x,somewherein72,1 point,Wed Dec 31 14:35:38 2014 UTC,"The only logical reason I've been able to arrive at for that whole Masuka's daughter subplot was to give his character some kind of closure. Otherwise, it adds absolutely nothing."

Dexter,2qve4x,_Goose_,8,Wed Dec 31 01:45:18 2014 UTC,Then they ruined the character by trying to give him a backstory / going into his personal life.
Dexter,2qve4x,Cowboys2410,7,Wed Dec 31 01:53:10 2014 UTC,I've always considered him a masukist  Masuka laugh

Dexter,2qve4x,qwedswerty,3,Wed Dec 31 04:58:21 2014 UTC,Rewatching season one at the moment. I forgot this show actually used to be funny. Whatever happened to his whole not having feelings thing? Suddenly the things he hadn't been able to do magically seemed possible in such a small space of time in the later seasons. Season 1 he seems so cold!
Dexter,2qve4x,Mikjaash,3,Wed Dec 31 02:56:08 2014 UTC,That's the point of the series. What do you think that stuff with Rita was about?
Dexter,2qve4x,jupiterwray,3,Wed Dec 31 04:37:50 2014 UTC,"It is also the point of the earlier seasons. He starts growing more and more fond of Rita beyond the use for her he has as cover. All of season 1-4 he is also fighting to improve himself, reaching out and trying to connect to others.  But even from the start, he is protective of children, curious about Doakes, protective of his family, respects his father, etc. He is not the robot he always explains himself as being. The constant reminders that he is almost seems like he's trying to convince himself.  But then again there are plenty of evidence towards exactly the opposite of what I just wrote, too..."
Dexter,2qve4x,Lucidleaf,3,Wed Dec 31 06:58:29 2014 UTC,His laugh.
Dexter,2qve4x,Itchiest,3,Wed Dec 31 16:36:56 2014 UTC,I love that scene when he brings Dexter home in his ridiculous blue pickup truck while rocking out to country music....

Deb needed an escape. I know she is also playing the guy but I think Deb just kinda fell into the drugs with the new job and it was an escape. That's my take on it anyway."

On one hand, killing LaGuerta was huge, but the inability to do anything about it is what makes it even worse."

Dexter,2quvnl,dvfsz,3,Wed Dec 31 00:22:47 2014 UTC,Uhh keep watching?

Dexter,2quvnl,azoolie,3,Wed Dec 31 07:04:48 2014 UTC,"Embrace the routine. Remember, Dexter functions by routine (as he develops). So does the show.  I appreciated that. Some seasons might not fulfill this as well, but close enough.  Maybe space out the seasons. Makes the routine more palatable, like visiting an old friend."
Dexter,2quvnl,Etobocoke,1 point,Thu Jan 1 13:28:12 2015 UTC,"Up to season six, binge watching and just now looking at any info on Dexter. I found that season four was the end of the good stuff. Not sure but maybe they should have ended it there."

Dexter,2quvnl,crackalac,0,Wed Dec 31 10:07:47 2014 UTC,OK I kind of understand why some people say to only watch the first 4 seasons but I have never heard anyone say to stop after 5. I thought 6 and 7 were both better than 5.
Dexter,2quvnl,crackalac,1 point,Tue Dec 30 23:30:14 2014 UTC,I liked the doomsday season. Mainly due to factors outside of dexter vs the big bad but I liked it all the same. And 7 was the badass Isaac sirko storyline.
Dexter,2qqhws,astupidwhitekid,22,Mon Dec 29 19:14:28 2014 UTC,"Can't speak for the realism (or major lack thereof) of the show, but I know in the book series Dexter explains that he buys new clothes and disposes them with every kill. It's the absolute safest way to do what he does, but I would imagine it gets very expensive.  (related: Novel Dexter also doesn't have one mass graveyard for all his victims. He has a variety of ways in which he disposes of bodies and evidence)."
Dexter,2qqhws,ArchStanton27,11,Mon Dec 29 19:59:31 2014 UTC,"It's the absolute safest way to do what he does, but I would imagine it gets very expensive.   It might, but how many kills does he really have? 100 or so across like 15 years or something like that? That's a lot of wardrobes but over time it doesn't seem like it would be too expensive considering it's his favorite/only hobby. :)"
Dexter,2qqhws,matty25,7,Mon Dec 29 20:50:39 2014 UTC,"Agreed. It's been a while, but it's usually a green henley, and a pair of khakis, right? You could easily get those two things for like $35. Add in underwear and shoes, and you're still looking at under $100. If he has a kill 4 times a year, that's $400 a year, or less than $40 a month. Just go out to eat a little less often. And like you said, it being his favorite hobby, that's not that bad. Car people, collectors, etc probably go through more than that a month."
Dexter,2qqhws,Checkers10160,2,Mon Dec 29 21:37:05 2014 UTC,"I forget where or who but someone said that they're military surplus, so he can get a lot of them cheaply"
Dexter,2qqhws,DutchMuffin,2,Tue Jan 6 14:37:50 2015 UTC,"I feel like he kills a lot more than 4 times a year though. Also, what if he buys cheap clothes for his kills? Go to Walmart and you can get some khakis for $10, and a shirt probably won't run him too much."
Dexter,2qqhws,avengingangele,4,Wed Jan 14 01:58:14 2015 UTC,I would imagine it gets very expensive.   Pretty sure he makes some nice bank with his job.
Dexter,2qqhws,Thizzlebot,3,Tue Dec 30 05:44:50 2014 UTC,"Mhm, since you have read the books I have a question as well. Might have been answered in the series as well but I don't remember.  Where does Dex get all the money from? He's generous, has a house and an apartment close to the sea, casually buys a new car, and never talks about money. Except for once: he said he doesn't take the money of his victims, because only the kill is important for his dark passenger.   So you know anything about where he gets the money from?"
Dexter,2qqhws,mostlyidontcare,2,Tue Dec 30 12:40:17 2014 UTC,"That, and think about all the driving he does when he's investigating. I mean, none of that is coming from the police or reimbursed by anyone. Driving around an SUV ain't cheap (especially in Miami, where you have to run your A/C nonstop) and when he has a victim in his sights, he doesn't stop following them (except to deal with work or family) until he's finished his kill."
Dexter,2qqhws,dudemann,1 point,Tue Dec 30 17:42:20 2014 UTC,"I don't know, I bought a treadmill for my gf at the time for a few hundred bucks, brand spanking new. That's pretty minor, if you ask me.  The amount of gas he uses driving everywhere, and then also what he uses driving his boat out to god knows where to dump bodies... that's a few thousand bucks over a year's time, easy. Well, at the time, at least. Now, the way things are at the moment, it might be like half as much money."
Dexter,2qqhws,dudemann,10,Tue Dec 30 18:45:15 2014 UTC,"He has that brown 'stalking' shirt, but for killing he wears a different shirt over it. I guess he either has a couple of these or just has really good laundry detergent."
Dexter,2qqhws,nuggetinabuiscuit,9,Wed Dec 31 02:08:51 2014 UTC,I think the answer is pretty obvious...
Dexter,2qqhws,CowboyNinjaD,3,Mon Dec 29 20:42:34 2014 UTC,This is the best comment in the thread
Dexter,2qqhws,avengingangele,7,Tue Dec 30 16:48:20 2014 UTC,The shirt is the American Apparel baby thermal henley in army color. Currently selling for $30.00 USD. So it's not too bad but over time would get expensive.  Source: I own one.
Dexter,2qqhws,LarsViener,6,Wed Jan 14 01:59:08 2015 UTC,Protip: Spray NeverwetTM on your brown henley so the blood just rolls right off!
Dexter,2qqhws,swisspassport,6,Tue Dec 30 00:07:38 2014 UTC,"We overrate the amount of killing Dexter does in a year due to not getting to see all of the hours and hours of nothing interesting at all happening. Imagine how often we get to see him purposefully messing up evidence, and they still consider him to be amazing at what he does.  Even if he has killed as many as 100 people, that's still only 30 dollars * 100 = 3000 dollars over several years. But I'm also guessing he won't get blood on his actual shirts that often.  I think we can see his wardrobe in one of the episodes, I think I remember noticing that he had a lot of ""kill suits"", but I can't swear on it."
Dexter,2qqhws,qwedswerty,2,Mon Dec 29 21:37:27 2014 UTC,Yeah he probably does buy clothing.
Dexter,2qqhws,wigwam2323,0,Tue Dec 30 00:18:18 2014 UTC,"If I remember right he said in season 1 that he makes his own shirt, to make it harder to get traced."

Dexter,2qogc1,DCBizzle,4,Mon Dec 29 05:08:17 2014 UTC,"5 and 7 are actually my two of my very favorite seasons. 5 because I loved Lumen and 7 because...well, I can't tell you without spoiling. But there's an interesting twist. 6 is awesome too. 8 was probably the weakest overall, but I didn't hate the ending like a lot of people did. Anyways, it's definitely worth it to keep watching. You should decide your opinion for yourself, and even if you feel the later seasons are weaker...it's still Dexter and it's still better than 99% of everything else you could be watching."
Dexter,2qogc1,Metazoan,1 point,Mon Dec 29 06:17:06 2014 UTC,Yeah I just finished Season 5 and am like halfway through The Walking dead Season 4. And my God is season 4 of TWD bad. So I'm going to finish the show.  So I think I'm going to push through. Besides I've heard that S8 is really the only horrible one.
Dexter,2qogc1,Metazoan,2,Mon Dec 29 16:57:07 2014 UTC,Season 5 (the current one) of The Walking Dead is amazing though. Best since season 2 for me. I didn't like 4 much either.
Dexter,2qogc1,WellHello87,4,Tue Dec 30 22:13:58 2014 UTC,"I really liked season 5, him having to take on a whole group was a new twist, and Jordan seems so untouchable."
Dexter,2qogc1,Cacklion,3,Mon Dec 29 07:12:12 2014 UTC,"Season ratings IN MY OPINION   SPOILERS ----- So...don't be ""Surpise(d) Motherfucker""  Season 1 - Fantastic really introduces the character as someone you don't want to get behind but someone who have to get behind. It's strange but it wrestles with the idea of right and wrong.  Season 4 - Just a great season, showing Dexter another killer well adjusted like he, BUT makes one great mistake that ruins the rest of the show. It goes from making Dexter a guy that you shouldn't like but are charmed by. Into just...the good guy. It kinda sucks but overall a great season.  Season 2 - A great compliment to the first season, introduces character development in Deb, makes you like/hate her more/less...sounds dumb but all it does is push you to one side or another with Deb.  Season 6 - I'm personally just into bible stuff. I like Se7en so I liked this season, even though the ending AGAIN really fucks stuff up.  Season 3 - Shows Dexter with a partner and how trying to BE the good guy or trying to be a hero doesn't work. Because what he's doing is not a heroic act. Again a relatively good compliment to the first season's Good vs Bad argument.  Season 5 - Eh Lumen was nice. But it was right after a character we spent 4 seasons with. If season 7 and 5 were switched as far as the ""Season's bad guy"" then there'd probably be a little bit more love for Lumen.  Season 7 - Shit. Sorry, it is. It's basically just the mafia. He's a serial killer WHY THE FUCK WOULD HE EVER GET INVOLVED SO HEAVILY WITH THE FUCKING MAFIA...sorry this whole season makes me mad.  Season 8/Final Season - It tried, it really did. It tried jumping back to its roots of whether Dexter is good or bad, but it just throws the ""HES A GOOD GUY HE HAD NO CHOICE"" message in your face. ""HE CARES ABOUT PEOPLE"" when in all seriousness...we've been lead to believe he has no feelings or remorse for his actions up until...ehh season 7 (There she is again..classic season 7). You could say that Rita's death was him showing remorse...but I think it was more the fact that HE FUCKED UP...as opposed to, he cared deeply and emotionally for her death."
Dexter,2qogc1,Cacklion,4,Mon Dec 29 07:06:40 2014 UTC,Edit: Never answered your question. Yeah keep watching. Don't you want closure?  Edit 2: That wasn't an edit. God damnit.
Dexter,2qogc1,brob,1 point,Mon Dec 29 07:07:20 2014 UTC,"I've just finished re-watching Seasons 1-3 so far. Season 3 really impressed me the 2nd time around. I think it gets too much grief since it is in the middle of 1, 2, and 4 which are perfection IMO."
Dexter,2qogc1,qwedswerty,2,Mon Dec 29 17:34:02 2014 UTC,"Don't search for a problem where there is none. How good we think something is is completely subjective, so don't listen to what others say and let that take away from your experience."
Dexter,2qogc1,NJS212,2,Tue Dec 30 00:19:34 2014 UTC,"I think Season 5 gets a bad wrap from a lot Dexter fans, though not necessarily here. I like the idea of him helping out Lumen as a way to exorcise his own demons about losing Rita. I liked the Lumen storyline and as someone who had a good friend raped violently years ago, I enjoyed it each time one of those guys were murdered.   I do hate the cop out they did with Deb at the end, but still a solid season that's above Season 6, Season 7, Season 8 and in my opinion, Season 3."
Dexter,2qogc1,welcome6,2,Tue Dec 30 08:41:39 2014 UTC,the thing that i really hated about season 5 was the Santa Muerte stuff.  I guess for me it was a drag to see the team working the case without Dexter being there and giving his usual input.  the beginning of the season was pretty boring in that sense.   the bad guys in season 5 were interesting and i Liked Lumen a lot but Joran Chase was not strong enough for me. the actor was not charismatic enough (which is Ironic for the role he was playing)
Dexter,2qogc1,broncoz33,2,Sun Jan 4 14:18:46 2015 UTC,I really liked season 5. Never understood the hate it gets. The show goes downhill hard after that but I would say ride it out and then commiserate with us.
Dexter,2qogc1,fuzzyperson98,3,Mon Dec 29 13:11:36 2014 UTC,"Just finished it and it might be my favorite so far.  I thought most of season 4 felt uninspired, and having yet another miami mega serial killer was really pushing my ability to suspend of disbelief."
Dexter,2qogc1,broncoz33,1 point,Tue Dec 30 03:56:59 2014 UTC,Well to be fair Trinity moved all over the place if I remember right. He just so happen to end up in Dexter's playground but I'm sure he would have moved on eventually.
Dexter,2qogc1,welcome6,1 point,Tue Dec 30 15:01:46 2014 UTC,"I never understood this complaint about the show If you think about it, no one really bats an eye that new york is full of crazy bad guys with suits in spiderman. no one ever really says anything about Gotham being full of bad guys in weird costumes.  Yeah, I get that comics and superheroes are more fantastical and dexter is meant to be realistic. But why is it so hard for some fans to accept that in the show's universe miami is full of killers?  I always thought it was weird that a lot of people would get mad about this aspect of the show."
Dexter,2qogc1,FoxIslander,1 point,Sun Jan 4 15:43:38 2015 UTC,"...definitely keep watching it and you will then join the ranks of the Dexter fans that wonder what the hell happened. In season 5 a more confident Dexter emerges, a Dexter that can have any woman he wants...a ""hot"" Dexter. I prefer awkward Dexter."
Dexter,2qogc1,tuckeran1999,1 point,Mon Dec 29 23:28:45 2014 UTC,"I watched Dexter for the first time over the past month. S5 was a very solid season in my opinion. I loved Julia Stiles as Lumen especially, it seems that a lot people hate it simply because it's not S4 and it comes right afterwards. S6 and 8 are my least favorite seasons. 6 is honestly just kind of boring to me. I didn't find 8 to be as terrible as a lot of people here thought it was, but was just really tense for me (I get WAY too emotionally invested into shows, lol)."
Dexter,2qogc1,rjames190,1 point,Tue Dec 30 00:20:36 2014 UTC,Astors such a bitch in these past too seasons ya know
Dexter,2qogc1,camo750,-1,Wed Dec 31 07:19:28 2014 UTC,"Season five was pretty awful, i think that's generally agreed upon. It's an emotional rollercoaster of a show, so there's no way to explain why you should keep watching without spoilers. This said, keep watching. You have to ride it out to get the real gritty gravity of things."
Dexter,2qod60,FtotheLICK,13,Mon Dec 29 03:27:27 2014 UTC,He did.
Dexter,2qod60,pizzatacos,6,Mon Dec 29 03:29:25 2014 UTC,"IIRC, he flat out admitted he did, didn't he?  And even if he didn't, it's not like there was anyone else who was more likely or even ""almost as likely"" to have done it instead."
Dexter,2qod60,ChickinSammich,-2,Mon Dec 29 03:33:55 2014 UTC,I feel like Trinity would have somehow told Dexter. Also Elliot the neighbor is a possibility. Rita denied furthering a relationship with him as his motive.
Dexter,2qod60,suctionpolecat,7,Mon Dec 29 05:15:22 2014 UTC,What makes you unsure? Who else could it have possibly been?
Dexter,2qod60,scarlet_overlord,-3,Mon Dec 29 03:44:52 2014 UTC,I feel like Trinity would have somehow told Dexter. Also Elliot the neighbor is a possibility. Rita denied furthering a relationship with him as his motive.
Dexter,2qod60,Andrado,5,Mon Dec 29 05:15:09 2014 UTC,"When Dexter kills Trinity, before he finds Rita, Trinity's final words are   ""It's already over""  This confirms it for two reasons:  1: This is what Trinity says to all of his victims, and killing Rita made Dexter his victim.  2: The literal definition of the phrase. When Trinity says it, he's basically saying ""it doesn't matter what you do right now because I've already won, and there's nothing you can do about it. It's already over.""  It really was an amazingly written scene."
Dexter,2qod60,Andrado,3,Mon Dec 29 05:15:57 2014 UTC,"If you've seen the later seasons before, you know there is no other suspect, not even mention that it could have been someone else. The reason Dexter was sending Rita and the kids out of Miami was because Trinity had discovered his real identity, and he wanted to prevent him from harming them. In the final episode of season 4, Trinity picks up his car in the middle of the afternoon, but when Dexter catches him driving out of Miami it's late at night, so he must have been doing something while he was still in town that day. It's super obvious that Trinity killed Rita, how are you not convinced?"
Dexter,2qod60,Andrado,-6,Mon Dec 29 05:07:11 2014 UTC,I feel like Trinity would have somehow told Dexter. Also Elliot the neighbor is a possibility. Rita denied furthering a relationship with him as his motive.
Dexter,2qod60,nuclearnoodle13,3,Mon Dec 29 05:14:57 2014 UTC,"Here is a clip of the Trinity kill scene: http://youtu.be/_FhAJgn-cUE?t=3m21s  Notice Trinity laugh when Dexter says he's good for a family, that he dreams of a heaven he'll never see. He says he accepts his fate as god's plan, and that Dexter will have to accept god's plan too. It's pretty clear that he's done something.  And the writers are trying to make the episode as dramatic as possible. If Trinity just said ""I killed your wife"" it would be a shock, but not nearly as intense for fans as seeing Dexter dispose of Trinity, thinking he'd won and ready to rejoin his happy family, only to realize that he was too late.  There is zero evidence to make you think it was Elliot. He never demonstrated violence or contempt towards Dexter, his family, or anyone else. And why would he kill Rita in the the bath tub, the way Trinity has been known to kill?  It was Trinity. Trust us on this."
Dexter,2qod60,kindadinosaur,2,Mon Dec 29 05:27:19 2014 UTC,"Plus Trinity was never one to brag about his kills. Most people didn't even realize they were connected, or that there was a fourth victim in each cycle. Why would he brag about it to Dexter. Telling him would change nothing."

Dexter,2qod60,nuggetinabuiscuit,2,Mon Dec 29 03:39:57 2014 UTC,"OP I agree with you. I haven't seen the episode in a while but from what I remember, dexter reaction to the killing didn't strike me as the same as if trinity killed her. If trinity killed her I feel like dexter would have been worse because of the timing of her death. Also, the one thing tha bothered me was that the police didn't investigate the murder. They just assumed it was trinity, they were making the trinity killings public, what if someone wanted to kill her but used trinitys MO. The police didn't even try to figure out how trinity got to her, aka,how he got in the house ( I guess they just assume Rita left the doors unlocked)"
Dexter,2qod60,ccc66,1 point,Mon Dec 29 06:19:19 2014 UTC,I've been looking for evidence of this. Open and shut case bro.
Dexter,2qod60,astupidwhitekid,2,Mon Dec 29 11:16:12 2014 UTC,"There's no way Elliot did it. He wouldn't know that whole 'killing a women in a bathtub' thing. Even if Elliot wanted too, why would he kill Rita in the same fashion as Trinity? It doesn't make sense. Plus, he doesn't have a motive to do it."
Dexter,2qod60,Fabien_Lamour,0,Mon Dec 29 17:42:52 2014 UTC,I feel like Trinity would have somehow told Dexter. Also Elliot the neighbor is a possibility. Rita denied furthering a relationship with him as his motive.  Thoughts?

Dexter,2qkd6v,sirawesomeness0826,9,Sat Dec 27 22:16:17 2014 UTC,Join the club.  It was one of the worst finales ever.
Dexter,2qkd6v,rhcp88,11,Sat Dec 27 23:08:30 2014 UTC,"I don't think you're alone in feeling unfulfilled. In fact, I don't think I've ever encountered someone who enjoyed the end of Dexter."

Dexter,2qkd6v,greyspatter,-1,Sun Dec 28 17:11:14 2014 UTC,Explain please
Dexter,2qkd6v,Natezami,6,Sun Dec 28 19:34:51 2014 UTC,I thought it was fitting for the character and the show to end ambiguously with Dexter still in control but very much out of control
Dexter,2qkd6v,greyspatter,2,Sun Dec 28 19:38:45 2014 UTC,"Exactly. I just finished the series, myself, and I think the finale was fitting. It worked well, and left just enough loose ends to leave me wanting more, but satisfied. I wouldn't say it gave me a sense of closure, but it fit.   Edit to add: The point is, you're not alone in liking it. We are few, but proud. :)"
Dexter,2qkd6v,peticus1990,2,Wed Jan 14 08:06:25 2015 UTC,I'd go as far as to say it was never meant to be tied up in a happy little bow It was meant to feel unsatisfying because that's how life works and the show is about Dexter gaining feelings and losing control because of it

Dexter,2qkd6v,ashawayrock,4,Tue Dec 30 23:40:57 2014 UTC,"I literally cried, when I saw Dexter holding Deb.. sending her to the depths of the ocean. Don't think she deserved that.  Also It was a horrible idea, the show was rushed to the end. Like most people say, what about the other characters?,  and about Dexter living isolated, alone, left out, abandoning his son Harrison!!"
Dexter,2qkd6v,thousandecibels,3,Sat Dec 27 22:49:26 2014 UTC,"Abandoning his son was pretty bad, but especially having him uprooted and sent to Argentina with a serial killer who was fully expecting Dexter to join her. Everything about Dexter's character development from S1E1, even before that during his childhood with Harry, was just completely reversed and undone in the finale. Considering what happened he may as well have just killed Deb and joined his brother at the end of S1."
Dexter,2qkd6v,thousandecibels,2,Sun Dec 28 17:47:56 2014 UTC,"I completely agree, I mean we spend so much of our time, got attached to the characters. Come on, at least they could do, was do some justice to the ending, fill some plot-holes, show some other character endings. :("
Dexter,2qkd6v,thousandecibels,3,Wed Dec 31 10:15:00 2014 UTC,"Yeah...Deb's death was terrible too...  ""She got shot!""  ""Oh, it's minor, she's gonna be alright!""  Then out of the fucking blue, ""SURGERY COMPLICATION, VEGETATIVE STATE FOR LIFE, TIME FOR DEX TO KILL HER AND FAKE HIS DEATH AND ABANDON HIS SON IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY WITH A SERIAL KILLER""...it was just so what the fuck. The finale felt more like a 'fuck you' to the viewers than anything else."
Dexter,2qkd6v,colgatesmiles,2,Wed Dec 31 15:21:19 2014 UTC,"They say, Dexter might get another spin-off title, that's why he's alive. I say psst... F*ck DEM!"
Dexter,2qkd6v,Smartjedi,2,Wed Dec 31 21:07:46 2014 UTC,I totally agree. Dexter was 1 of the only 3 shows that ever made me cry. The others being supernatural and Futurama (shut up it was the episode when fry's dog from the   90s died waiting for him to come back)
Dexter,2qkd6v,Bigstar976,3,Wed Dec 31 23:31:27 2014 UTC,"Aye, the finale was poorly thought out. Season 8 was supposed to be all about Dexter letting go of his ""Dark Passenger"" and realising that he didn't need the code, then, in the final two episodes that all goes out of the window? Pointless."
Dexter,2qkd6v,Honduran,2,Sun Dec 28 18:10:03 2014 UTC,You know what I never understood? All those times Hannah's name was mentioned in front of Harrison and he never said a word.

I do feel as though the book wouldn't have been nearly as enjoyable if I wasn't already a fan of the show however.  It's impossible for me to see it from an outsiders perspective but I'd be interested to see what someone who never watched the show thought of the books."

I arrived at the conclusion that what I dislike about the later seasons was Dexter's increase in confidence, his having a new great looking gf every 10 mins.  I prefer awkward Dexter who could only attract a woman as ""damaged"" as he is, to hot Dexter."
Dexter,2q9s09,FoxIslander,4,Wed Dec 24 18:35:26 2014 UTC,"I agree. Also, I'm a mostly-aromantic asexual who has never really understood or particularly liked people and I used to really relate to Dexter. He was predominantly empty of emotion, so he led a life of analysis and science. He saw himself as an outsider, observing people like they were a different species. Then in later seasons he had normal people emotions and spent his time fucking everything that moved. It really disappointed me.  Edit: I should maybe add that sex scenes (especially those involving guys) make me pretty uncomfortable"
Dexter,2q9s09,notanimposter,4,Fri Dec 26 04:49:45 2014 UTC,You sound fun... Lol

Dexter,2q9s09,qwedswerty,3,Wed Dec 24 20:57:48 2014 UTC,Preach. Season 1 is a perfectly crafted work of art.
Dexter,2q9s09,the_kraken_queen,4,Mon Dec 29 10:53:16 2014 UTC,Totally. Season 1 was a friggin' masterpiece. Season 8 is just mind-bogglingly bad.
Dexter,2q9s09,the_kraken_queen,5,Mon Dec 29 10:51:23 2014 UTC,This is why it's important to keep the original writers.
Dexter,2q9s09,compoundbreak791,3,Thu Dec 25 00:24:12 2014 UTC,"I think season 1-2 are among my favorite seasons of shows. When they are hunting the Bay harbor butcher, I just love it.  Aside from S4, its all down hill from there."
Dexter,2q9s09,A-Little-Stitious,-1,Wed Dec 24 19:29:44 2014 UTC,Be careful. I commented on how the first season didn't have much of a soundtrack and people yelled at me.
Dexter,2q9s09,bygod_weaver,11,Wed Dec 24 12:11:40 2014 UTC,I remember the music to the first season quite well. I barely remember any music that played in 8
Dexter,2q9s09,ChronaMewX,2,Wed Dec 24 17:48:31 2014 UTC,"There wasn't any. I remember every episode wondering why so many scenes had absolutely no music. Or more accurately, why so few scenes had music at all."
Dexter,2q9s09,BloodChicken,2,Wed Dec 24 21:23:14 2014 UTC,"Yeah. I remember that song from Lost being played in some Vogel scenes, but that's literally it"
Dexter,2q6181,dexterfinalseason,7,Tue Dec 23 11:39:58 2014 UTC,"A great rendition of the story. I only had two major problem with it though. First, not even Doakes could find out about Dexter's past and relation to Brian, he had to catch him in the act. That being said, Doakes was a fair superior cop then Quinn, even having experience in the military. If Doakes wasn't able to find out about Dexter's past then I highly doubt that Quinn would be able to. Second, it's impossible that just because Quinn found Dexter killing Martin that he could conclude that Dexter is the Bay Harbor Butcher. Also that means Miami Metro couldn't open the Bay Harbor Butcher case until they found the slides, then leading them to reopen it. Otherwise, it's great, those are the only major problems I see. Also it seems like Martin is influenced by the serial killer in Book 2 of Dexter, is he?"
Dexter,2q6181,ICookTheBlueStuff,2,Tue Dec 23 18:58:51 2014 UTC,yeah that's where i had a problem too. Quinn is crooked. honestly if he suspected someone else was crooked in the dpt. he'd do no research at all. he'd drop it so hard
Dexter,2q6181,kingkoons,1 point,Tue Dec 23 22:08:09 2014 UTC,"Yep he is.  The BHB case was reopened because Quinn was killed in a BHB kill room, and it was obvious that somebody had stumbled across it (Quinn) and got killed by presumably the butcher. Finding Dexter's DNA was the nail in the coffin.  I agree about Doakes/Quinn angle, but if Deb could figure it out at the end of S4, I'm sure somebody else had to eventually. I'm pretty sure seasons 5-8 Quinn could find Dexter murdering the whole department and he wouldn't suspect anything, but the S4 Quinn that pretty much started to turn into his own cool version of Doakes was ready to hunt Dexter in S5, but the old writers left, so for some stupid reason the storyline got half-scrapped and Quinn forgets he has evidence on Dexter, because the new writing staff are/were retarded. Oh, and there's also no Carmela to get in his way too."
Dexter,2q6181,Maxm1812,3,Wed Dec 24 01:39:40 2014 UTC,Damn this would've been so much better than what we got
Dexter,2q6181,BaconAllDay2,2,Tue Dec 23 20:59:58 2014 UTC,"I wish we did get something like this. I mean, there's so many episodes dedicated to Dexter introspecting about being captured and he even said it himself that it will happen no matter what he does. But the new writers were like ''nah fuck that shit'' and gave him emotions instead. You can't give a psychopath fucking feelings in the first place. It's pretty much why I despise seasons 5-8. Absolutely stupid."
Dexter,2q6181,BaconAllDay2,2,Wed Dec 24 01:50:17 2014 UTC,I like it. I would prefer seeing the Slasher early on though but great prompt.
Dexter,2q6181,phuckdolphins,3,Tue Dec 23 15:32:56 2014 UTC,"Ah well, I think it makes sense for episode 1 to focus just on Rita's demise. Episode 2 on Deb dealing with Dexter being a serial killer. And then the Slasher is introduced in episode 3. It's not too much of a wait but I get your point."
Dexter,2q6181,PiTheKhoz,3,Tue Dec 23 17:00:27 2014 UTC,Hey remember you are only one guy writing an entire season outline. How did that go for the real writers post season 4? Not as good.

Is the slasher just something you made up? I haven't read the books, but it occurs to me that the slasher might be from the books.  Anyway, good read. I love the idea of Dexter getting caught and everybody knowing what he did. I'm not sure I agree with the idea of replacing the last four seasons with just one, but this would be pretty cool for an 8th Season, if things were reworked a little bit :D"

Dexter,2q609m,Lucidleaf,1 point,Wed Dec 24 07:59:27 2014 UTC,I feel your pain. I really liked Rita. I always ran it over in my head about what she would do when she found out about Dexter's secret but now she won't ever. I've never seen a show kill off such an important character and I just sat there slackjawed like an idiot. Shit's fucked.
Dexter,2q609m,SomethingNotWitty,2,Mon Jan 5 06:34:23 2015 UTC,She may have found out some stuff about dexter. Maybe trinity told her some things while they were in the tub. I am curious as to what may have been said.

Dexter,2q5umy,alphadog3939,10,Tue Dec 23 09:49:56 2014 UTC,"To be honest, I didn't. I cannot feel sorry for anyone who abused his wife (and kids? - don't think so)... Also, he seemed like a dick to Dexter, even though he did nothing wrong - well, except for, you know, banging his wife."
Dexter,2q5umy,mostlyidontcare,3,Tue Dec 23 12:31:18 2014 UTC,"People deserve the chance to change. He and Rita were separated, Dexter did nothing wrong."
Dexter,2q5umy,Slaytounge,3,Tue Dec 23 18:03:28 2014 UTC,"I'll say of course, because after all, we're talking about a show where the protagonist is a serial killer. People in this show are complicated."
Dexter,2q5umy,ZombyWoof1992,3,Tue Dec 23 13:45:24 2014 UTC,"He deseved to be in prison, but not die. Dexter didnt intend for him to die at least, though he is indirectly responsible for getting locked up again. He never really seemed like a changed man to me, mostly because of when his aggressive tendencies start showing. He puts on that happy friendly face for the kids. He DOES seem to care about them, but that's about it, all his behavior towards Rita seemed really faked, and it was for the best that she kept her guard up, even if it was harsh.  Most people dont have the strength to stand up to their abusers the way Rita did with Paul. She still clearly cared about him because his death did really upset her, but he clearly didnt show he deserved that much from her.  But no, I dont really feel that sorry for Paul. He beat Rita, he emotionally harassed her even after the fact, and he had the balls to try and seek legal action against her for defending herself from him when he got drunk and tried to have sex with her.  On a moral level, he's not worse than Dexter, but at the very least, Paul deserved to be in prison, and didnt really prove that he'd changed enough to be out of prison either."
Dexter,2q5umy,chickenrapist,8,Tue Dec 23 17:20:03 2014 UTC,No. You beat and rape your wife? You deserve worse than death.
Dexter,2q5umy,hannahsongla,2,Tue Dec 23 15:55:37 2014 UTC,Did you miss the part where he tried to rape her again and then pressed charges for the baseball bat to the head he got?
Dexter,2q5umy,Starburstnova,2,Thu Dec 25 00:00:28 2014 UTC,"Yes and no. I don't think he deserved to die. He cared deeply for his kids, but he was still quite the scumbag."
Dexter,2q5umy,xhorizen,2,Tue Dec 23 12:51:08 2014 UTC,"Absolutely no pity ever entered my mind toward that man. He abused his wife and honestly, I've seen enough abusive men in my life to think that Paul wasn't actually sorry for what he did to Rita and their kids, he just knew what Rita wanted to hear so he could try to get into her good graces again."
Dexter,2q5umy,em0ng,1 point,Sat Dec 27 01:41:45 2014 UTC,"I thought it was really cut and dry. If he cared so much for his kids like he claims he does, then he wouldn't best on his wife, I mean after all, they are a extension of her.."

Dexter,2q44r5,MotorMonkey,5,Tue Dec 23 03:14:34 2014 UTC,"Reminds me of a weird story...  I was in middle school, at a friend's house, and his father asked us if we wanted to watch one of his favorite shows: Quantum Leap.  I'd never heard of it, but said I didn't like the show, and us kids left and played outside.  THE NEXT DAY: My school had this daily morning contest thing...they'd play a song over the speakers, and somehow you could submit your guess of identifying the song, and they'd draw your name out of the collection of correct guesses, and you'd win...something,  I don't remember what.    No fucking joke, it was the Quantum Leap theme song.  After school, I was over at his house again, the show came on, I heard the song, and I lost it as only a middle schooler could, a few seconds of AAAAAHHHH and Noooooooo!    I told his dad ""I should have watched it yesterday!"" and asked my friend if he had recognized the song...  He recognized it, but didn't turn in a guess because he thought I would recognize it, and he wanted me to win the prize."

Season 3 is on par with the quality of later seasons. It's got it's slow parts, but it's the same show. You may not enjoy the ending itself, but if you got this far, see it through.  The villains in season 5 are by far the creepiest if you ask me. Starts slow but I LOVE that season."
Dexter,2q61ie,Starburstnova,2,Tue Dec 23 12:53:52 2014 UTC,"The drop in quality happens well before then.   Seriously? Season 4 was amazing, way better than 3 or any subsequent season IMO."
Dexter,2q61ie,Starburstnova,2,Fri Jan 2 21:21:47 2015 UTC,"Better than season 3, sure. Not better than 1 or 2. Season 1 is MILES ahead of the rest. Don't get me wrong, I love season 4. But I don't get why people make such a big deal about it. It wasn't half as intricate a plot as season 1."
Dexter,2q61ie,Gamb,1 point,Sat Jan 3 09:03:37 2015 UTC,"Season 1 was my favorite also, always will be. Nothing can compare to how amazing that season of television was. Next is a tie between 2 and 4, then the rest in some lump together, then 8 doesn't exist.   I think Lithgow made 4, he was just a great villain with a lot of depth, who someone Dexter should have killed (and once let die) a hundred times over, and due to his own selfishness and lying it all came back to haunt him and his child. Just like Harry brought Laura, Brian and Dexter's fate upon them, Dexter did the same to Rita and his son (tl;dr S4 finale). I thought those last few episodes, especially the perfectly painful finale after Rita had given Dexter some hope for helping him, was some of the most memorable television ever. Acting, writing, everything.  *The great cost of that perfect fateful ending was Rita, which both character and show Dexter never really seemed to recover from."

Dexter,2q6qa4,gagsy92,10,Tue Dec 23 16:37:04 2014 UTC,"Dexter must die an impersonal, grotesquely bloody death. I want him eaten by a starving pack of wolves outside his lumberjack abode.   Stretch the death out over half a season. It's a foregone conclusion but before it begins, Dexter needs to do some reflection in his final moments.   First, Dexter abandoned his son in the hands of another serial killer. But it's also Rita's son and her other children were born of a real piece of shit father, too. Given that Harrison has half-siblings, and Dexter's presence caused the death of Rita's ex as well as Rita, there needs to be some time spent enumerating the minor characters in Dexters life who were shat upon but hardly understood.   Given the trend of serendipity throughout the show, why not bring two separated and estranged people to cross paths. Dexter has had a few femme fatales and two survived. They need to meet. It should be tense and result in bloodshed. This must awaken Harrison's dark passenger.   Harrison's journey to find his family will lead to his siblings, where Dexter will he cast as the deadbeat of a father he was. Harrison will grow conflicted until he wants to confront his wayward father.   We should hear Harrison's inner thoughts instead of Dexters during this portion. Harrison is there to tell us what Dexter and the other seasons did not - Dexter was no hero.   The show should end with Harrison unable to find his father but manages to find the lumberjack cabin. Unknowingly, he will stand over the long since lapped up pool of blood that left Dexter wolf food. And as he does, Dexter will speak to him the way Harry spoke to Dexter. Harrison will shake it off as whispers in the woods and prepare to leave. When he enters his car to pull away, he'll look in the rear view mirror and see Doakes staring back at him. Harrison's dark passenger has joined him as he searches for more clues about his father.   From there spin off a Harrison the Hunter and wrap it up with a revelation about Harrison enlisting in the military as his Dark Passenger, Doakes, licks his lips at all the carnage to be had in war torn countries."

Dexter,2q3j39,Atticustom,2,Tue Dec 23 01:10:02 2014 UTC,All the lovey relationship moments. It felt like a cheap soap opera at times.
Dexter,2q3j39,Deezer19,2,Tue Dec 23 03:26:09 2014 UTC,"That's the thing though, if you're referring to Dexter himself. All his interactions with people are faked. They'd appear like a soap opera because he's just acting, and to him that is how people interact."
Dexter,2q3j39,Deezer19,2,Tue Dec 23 03:41:16 2014 UTC,"I get he's ""emotionless"" and pretending, but they go through a lot of effort to prove that point. I went into the show thinking it would be more about the serial killer and less about the relationships."
Dexter,2q3j39,Weltall548,3,Tue Dec 23 20:34:36 2014 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but the relationships do make it about the serial killer more then not. I forget the statistic, but I think there is something like 50 serial killers in the States at any moment, and in order for them to succeed at their craft, they need that human side, which is what Dexter showcases. You need the stable life in order to maintain your habit. Who would suspect someone in law enforcement does what Dexter does? I feel the show strikes a nice balance. Dexter cannot kill every night, there is months inbetween kills sometimes, the show would be bare without his day to day. His daily life and faked relationships are just as important as his kill rooms and tools."
Dexter,2q3j39,Slaytounge,1 point,Tue Dec 23 20:56:40 2014 UTC,"Great point.

Dexter,2q1yno,Erekt__Butthole,11,Mon Dec 22 19:47:54 2014 UTC,"1) He's consistently well-written for a psychopath. Sometimes he gets a social situation right, sometimes very wrong. He's bad at anything emotional obviously, so it's just luck if he does well socially, especially if it is a difficult situation.  2) Masuka was good 1-4, but just like EVERY side character, they all decayed in 5-8.  3) Oh yeah, we all know. Season 8 was fucking atrocious.  4) Dexter, under the original showrunner, would've been about 5 or 6 seasons, but he left the show unfortunately. You can read his original ending online and fill in the gaps. Probably something like Quinn chasing down Dexter in S5 like Doakes in S2, Deb finding out, the department slowly figuring out who Kyle Butler is etc etc. Then it ends with Clyde's original ending, put down by the State of Miami, as he looks out across the room at all of those he has destroyed. Poetic.  5) I disagree. Season 3 is a very strong season. It still has great writing, a great performance from Jimmy Smits and it's extremely solid compared to anything in seasons 5-8, even S7. S7 had terrible Hannah, and killed off the ONLY good character in the season with Sirko. Someone else summed up S3 v S7 well, with something like ''S3 was a solid season by competent writers. S7 was an exciting season by incompetent writers.'' I rank the seasons 4,1,2,3 but season 3 is still a very good season.  6) Yep. Season 6 was bullshit.  7) Yep, 5-8 writers again.  8) Yep, 5-8 writers again.  9) Yep, 5-8 writers again.  10) Yep, 5-8 writers again."

Dexter,2q1yno,ipown11,2,Mon Dec 22 12:44:01 2014 UTC,"I am 100% with you on your ranking. For me, season four should have foreshadowed a rampage in S5 leading to his capture/ execution. There was no art left to the series by S5, which I believe was a move towards profitability instead of popularity. Shame. A damn shame."
Dexter,2q1yno,Khal-Stevo,1 point,Mon Dec 22 18:43:13 2014 UTC,"Agree with season 3. The skinner was incredibly forgettable, but I absolutely loved watching Miguel spiral out of control and Jimmy Smits was great"
Dexter,2q1yno,Tay-Rex,1 point,Mon Dec 22 18:16:59 2014 UTC,"1) I agree, but if you have the time, watch just the first 10 minutes of the first episode. Dexter seemed very, very relaxed in social settings. He had a lighter feel to him, which sort of darkened and dulled as the show went on.  2) Yeah..........  3) Yeah....  4) Oh, I didn't know that there was a different showrunner. On the Quinn angle...didn't Quinn have photographic evidence that Dexter was doing shady things during Season 5? It seemed like Quinn was initially slated to pick up where Doakes left off, but then fizzled and became an annoying side character with different love interests that were of little consequence. Would have loved to see the show head in a direction where he's found out...shame.  5) I don't know...Season 3 seemed alright, I agree Jimmy Smits was good. I think it may have just been overshadowed by the viciousness and suspense of Season 4. As for Sirko, I really liked Sirko, but hated pretty much everything around Sirko. The Koshka Brotherhood story was meh. I would have liked to see Sirko a bit longer, personally. The last two seasons felt extremely rushed.  6-10) Do you know if there were certain batches of writers during seasons 5-8 that differed from the earlier seasons?"
Dexter,2q1yno,Slaytounge,6,Tue Dec 23 01:02:09 2014 UTC,I actually liked Lumen as a character. Up until they made her a romantic interest. Then I just couldn't stand it. Season 5 isn't all that popular but I quite liked it up until the whole romance shit.
Dexter,2q1yno,Atticustom,2,Mon Dec 22 13:22:42 2014 UTC,Dammit! Season 3 is good!
Dexter,2q1yno,ristoman,2,Mon Dec 22 22:46:39 2014 UTC,1) I noticed that too. I assumed he got really tired of pretending.
Dexter,2q1yno,NeuroCore,2,Tue Dec 23 01:12:31 2014 UTC,Personally I can forgive almost all of the flaws you point out. In the end Dexter was a fairly daring show; when you tread into new territory you're bound to have hits and misses. But #7 cannot happen in a show where the premise is for someone to not be found out. I'd say it's on par with replacing a main character in a run of the mill sit-com. The show loses all reasons to exist.  Breaking Bad didn't have the same premise but it was a big chunk of it and they orchestrated that whole aspect beautifully. I think the worst thing about Dexter as a character is that he spoke of internal struggle and feeling it all slip away but you could never really feel it; at some point in the series we all accepted that nobody would care about this or that mistake. Compare that to BB's Kid and bike disassembly in season 5. Nobody talks but you can see and feel what the guys are thinking.   I can only wonder where this show would have ended up had it not been for MCH keeping it all together.
Dexter,2q1yno,born_again_atheist,1 point,Mon Dec 22 14:08:12 2014 UTC,"That's not what he means. Often times in the show, Dexter would say something like ""I wear a mask and I can feel it... slipping."" and we hear about how he struggles to keep that facade up. An exceptional show, instead of saying it over and over, would present the scene in a way that you would just know it. Because of the situation, of Dexter's facial expression, or his emotions, or whatever it is, you would feel his struggle as he experiences it.   I don't think I conveyed that point in the best way but I tried."
Dexter,2q1yno,General__Specific,2,Mon Dec 22 16:05:25 2014 UTC,"11) Dexter manages to slink around unnoticed in places that should be filled with security cameras (the airport, hospitals, etc.) constantly.  This one always bugged me about the show."
Dexter,2q1yno,AnalogDan,3,Mon Dec 22 18:06:23 2014 UTC,"That airport shit is literally my biggest gripe.  It's as if no one involved had ever been in or seen an airport, much less a security camera.  And the idea that there aren't routine security checks going on that would have interrupted him is just ridiculous.  What airport has a room full of peoples luggage that doesn't have a camera in it?  An airport with a lot of thefts.  And on the same note,  he traveled to Europe just out of nowhere and back to the U.S. without anyone looking into the fact that his crazy ex disappeared while he was in the same country.  Even if he had fake ID's and she was living under an assumed identity, police aren't so stupid as to completely miss all that."

We basically watch him reek havoc on the city. Also there's Molly the cop trying to catch Malvo and the murder of a fellow cop, as well as a Mob Boss, who is trying to maintain control of his empire. Such a good story. Malvo reminds me of Heath Ledger's Joker and Lester is a Walter White-like character. Excellent acting and writing. i recommend watching this first. its a small 8-10 episode season."
Dexter,2q08b5,dws817,4,Mon Dec 22 03:26:30 2014 UTC,"It's not that similar but I recommend The Fall, on netflix. It's about a serial killer and the cops trying to catch him."

We watched Psych and loved it. It's sort of like Dexter with the father-to-son relationship aspect of the show. Highly recommend it for a good laugh.
Dexter,2q08b5,LAUNCHERMONKEY,5,Mon Dec 22 03:01:43 2014 UTC,"While very dissimilar shows in tone overall, I am also a very big fan of both and will recommend Psych whenever possible. The writing and delivery the actors give are top-notch and it's one of the few shows where I honestly cant say I dislike a single character."
Dexter,2q08b5,TattsMcGee,5,Mon Dec 22 07:25:34 2014 UTC,"Oddly enough, Death Note its very similar.  However breaking bad is an amazing show."
Dexter,2q08b5,Gaitsa,6,Mon Dec 22 17:41:46 2014 UTC,I watched death note and absolutely loved it
Dexter,2q08b5,engineeratlarge,4,Mon Dec 22 20:59:20 2014 UTC,"The Killing. It's a very intense show, and very addicting."
Dexter,2q08b5,TheVeeginator,3,Mon Dec 22 17:01:06 2014 UTC,"Hannibal, The Killing, Fargo"
Dexter,2q08b5,engineeratlarge,2,Mon Dec 22 05:01:35 2014 UTC,Breaking Bad/Weeds for binge watching if you subscribe to netflix. If you are more into serial killer and police procedural stuff I would recommend True Detective.
Dexter,2q08b5,Szcynergy,1 point,Mon Dec 22 02:14:35 2014 UTC,Weeds was so good until it jumped the shark. If I would've known how badly it was going to go I never would've started watching in the first place
Dexter,2q08b5,Slaytounge,6,Mon Dec 22 04:32:31 2014 UTC,Agreed it went downhill after they ditched the suburban setting and moved to mexico.
Dexter,2q08b5,Nekronicle,2,Mon Dec 22 04:46:10 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with /u/LAUNCHERMONKEY , Deathnote is really similar to Dexter in terms of the whole ""eliminate criminals"" thing. It also has some awesome psychological stand offs and the aspect of staying one step ahead of the cops.  Also, Hannibal is awesome."

Dexter,2py2zo,spencc1996,21,Sun Dec 21 04:15:53 2014 UTC,"I personally would love to see another add on of Dexter, but I'm pretty doubtful. Michael C. Hall is pretty busy with Hedwig, and when asked in an interview he said he was glad Dexter ended because he was ready to move on to other roles."
Dexter,2py2zo,bigsickselby,2,Sun Dec 21 04:25:04 2014 UTC,Hedwig can only go on for so long. And im not even looking for a complete new series. just give me a a Dexter mini series to properly end the Dexter's story. I want him in prison or dead.
Dexter,2py2zo,kobayashimaru13,1 point,Sun Dec 21 04:52:44 2014 UTC,John Mitchell Cameron is taking over Hedwig in January.
Dexter,2py2zo,Smokey_666_1989,0,Sun Dec 21 04:57:12 2014 UTC,good news!
Dexter,2py2zo,ImperviousSeahorse,24,Sun Dec 21 05:13:34 2014 UTC,"I think a new series of Dexter would have to be much darker, dirtier and dangerous. He would lack most of the tools and resources he had in Miami..... They should do a movie where he's hunted across america and where he ends up an uncontrollable serial killer"
Dexter,2py2zo,SomewhatSly,6,Sun Dec 21 05:37:34 2014 UTC,i like that idea but not a movie. only because movies can only be so long.
Dexter,2py2zo,ImperviousSeahorse,-29,Sun Dec 21 05:41:25 2014 UTC,"only because movies can only be so long.   So...you're proposing that another series be made? you realize that most TV shows in the US have like 20 hour long episodes, right? I don't follow your logic at all.  EDIT - I still stand by what I said. I am correct."
Dexter,2py2zo,XPapaMoonX,6,Sun Dec 21 12:00:38 2014 UTC,can only be so long.   He wants it to be longer than a 2 hour movie (a 20 hour season would be better).
Dexter,2py2zo,Slaytounge,-28,Sun Dec 21 12:33:39 2014 UTC,"That's not what he said. He said that movies are too long, what else is there if a 2 hour movie is too long?"
Dexter,2py2zo,dpmcg,13,Sun Dec 21 12:35:17 2014 UTC,"No, he said movies can only be so long. As in movies are designated to a length of time usually two hours which he believes is not adequate enough for our favorite sociopath."
Dexter,2py2zo,BeaverAndTheGoose,6,Sun Dec 21 12:39:25 2014 UTC,"Nope, go back and read it."
Dexter,2py2zo,BaconAllDay2,3,Sun Dec 21 16:15:12 2014 UTC,You misread what he said. I made the same mistake.
Dexter,2py2zo,FourCylinder,-13,Sun Dec 21 12:44:32 2014 UTC,"No, that's exactly what he said"
Dexter,2py2zo,BaconAllDay2,14,Sun Dec 21 12:37:50 2014 UTC,My way you'd bring back the show. Fisherman off the coast of Newfoundland are deep sea fishing and haul in a load of fish. Inside the load is a two teeth that the fisherman brings back to have tested. At a lab they find the teeth belong to Arthur Mitchell aka Trinity. They also find a piece of plastic stuck between the teeth. Miami PD celebrates as Dexter's wife can rest in peace now. Batista doesn't celebrate and instead starts to think back to what Laguerta said. Maybe Dexter was the Bay Harbor Butcher? Why did he disappear along with his sister? He tells Quin and they start to try and find where Dexter went after his boat sank.
Dexter,2py2zo,IINSULT,2,Sun Dec 21 07:05:50 2014 UTC,I live in Newfoundland and I support this.
Dexter,2py2zo,Bigstar976,2,Wed Jan 7 05:47:56 2015 UTC,It makes the most sense in my opinion considering the ocean currents Dex dumps the bodies in goes North and likely near your beautiful home.
Dexter,2py2zo,WH1SKEYHANGOVER,7,Wed Jan 7 06:00:18 2015 UTC,"Yep, MCH has explicitly stated he would not be interested in a continuation of Dexter, but maybe a spin off.  I fear we will forever be left wondering what happens to Dexter the lumberjack."
Dexter,2py2zo,WH1SKEYHANGOVER,2,Sun Dec 21 05:40:15 2014 UTC,"I would've liked a spin-off with the Zach Hamilton character being mentored by Dexter. But, so much for that.  All in all, the end of season 8 feels like they thought they were gonna have a season 9, and then got cancelled and had to scramble to tie it all up in the last episodes."
Dexter,2py2zo,qwedswerty,4,Fri Jan 2 22:36:26 2015 UTC,"ive said it before. ill say it again. showtime produces a full length dexter movie. pick it up where season 7 finished.   the x-files have done two feature length movies. firefly fans got their serenity, hell even Veronica Mars got it done. someone launch a kickstarter campaign to get this done. im too damn lazy"
Dexter,2py2zo,NIHLSON,5,Sun Dec 21 18:05:18 2014 UTC,You mean pick up were season 8 finished right?
Dexter,2py2zo,qwedswerty,0,Sun Dec 21 23:01:07 2014 UTC,No....because season 8 is a pile of shit. Movie would pick up after Deb shoots Laguerta and the entire cast would publicly denounce season 8 during promotion tours for the movie.
Dexter,2py2zo,Sullyjr77,2,Sun Dec 21 23:51:36 2014 UTC,"It'd seem weird and dishonest to continue with a spin off with Dexter as a killer. The message of the ending of the show was clearly that his adventures was over.  A prequel might be fun though, showing the mistakes that led to all of the carefulness... But still, I don't think it'd seem right.   A spin-off with another main I guess has the best chance of being good, one could make it much darker and focus more on some sort of relative hunting for Dexter, etc, but having a completely different style as far as the killing is concerned. If it's built up through a couple of seasons first, and then just ends with the new protagonist killing an older and defenceless Dexter or something, that could definitely work."
Dexter,2py2zo,falcon4287,1 point,Sun Dec 21 13:17:46 2014 UTC,The only thing about the ending that gave me the impression it was over was what writers said about it.  My personal impression is that Dexter is a long haul truck driver and is killing people in random towns and truck stops.  The only difference is he has no one close to him he can hurt.
Dexter,2py2zo,Sullyjr77,1 point,Thu Dec 25 15:23:34 2014 UTC,"The ghost of Harry disappeared, and he chose not to kill a very deserving serial killer that he even had good personal reasons to kill.  He doesn't blame his sister's death on avoiding Harry, he blames it on that he has been doing wrong for all of this time.   The whole season 8, and a big part of the rest of Dexter is about his fight to change who he is to something better.  I'd love to see more of Dexter, so I can imagine some ways that it would work, but there'd have to be a catalysator in his new life."
Dexter,2py2zo,falcon4287,1 point,Thu Dec 25 15:36:31 2014 UTC,God I hope your right but I doubt it.
Dexter,2py2zo,Manthejelly,2,Sun Dec 21 04:17:26 2014 UTC,"It's as likely as getting a second season of Firefly... so if we're praying to the TV Gods for a miracle season of a show, I say we go with the one that never had a real chance for closure. Dexter had plenty of time to write an actual ending to the show- they chose to write what we saw and ended the show due to necessity to the story."
Dexter,2py2zo,cobyarem,2,Sun Dec 21 09:11:43 2014 UTC,I miss firefly soooo much!
Dexter,2py2zo,LeTrukTruk,1 point,Wed Dec 24 23:17:30 2014 UTC,"I would personally be happy with a prequel series, but I believe that the ending to Dexter was carefully constructed to appease the most number of people (rather than writing something either realistic or fitting in tone with the series, unfortunately) by leaving Dexter alive and open to interpretation on how his life would continue, but it was clear that he intended to have as little human interaction as possible and have a low-key life, even if he did continue killing.    Of course, most viewers and even Michael C. Hall wanted to see Dexter die at the end of the series, and I have to agree with that. But having him ""die"" to the world without actually dying was just a way to try to make everyone happy and was very poor writing in my professional opinion. I like to forget about that last minute of the episode and just tell myself that he died, which in all fairness probably was the character's intention when setting out.    I think a prequel mini-series would be great because they could bring in the actor who played teenage Dexter to do more stories about him learning his craft."
Dexter,2py2zo,NIHLSON,1 point,Sun Dec 21 09:07:46 2014 UTC,I would love for netflix to do what they did for arrested development and do another season and get some of the original writers with the same cast of course. That'd would be great...

Try not to read any more threads or comments on youtube or anything, though...I had the series finale spoiled to me on a youtube comment. My fault, but still.  Some people don't like how it ended, but I still say if you enjoy the series so far and like the characters, it's worth seeing through to the end."
Dexter,2puyj3,scottydo423,4,Sat Dec 20 06:01:23 2014 UTC,"Someone spoiled it for me before I started watching the show too, even mentioning exactly when it happens. I found that this did not take away any enjoyment of the series up to that point. When I got to the episode where it happens I ended up experiencing feelings of extreme dread, and at one point thinking that maybe the person who spoiled it for me was wrong and it happens in a different episode, or not at all. While it was a different feeling than the shock everyone else experienced I still felt the same emotional turmoil after it happened."

Dexter,2puyj3,Tooth88,2,Sat Dec 20 06:52:03 2014 UTC,"I would definitely recommend watching it, as the first four seasons are better than any series that I've ever seen.

They usually do not spoil anything in the descriptions but there was one where they spoiled something big (Don't ask me what it is I won't tell). I accidentally read it and it ruined a giant surprise. And you should also not go on this subreddit if you are trying to avoid spoilers."

Dexter,2pma88,Mikjaash,16,Wed Dec 17 21:58:26 2014 UTC,Arterial blood is also a higher pressure than veinous.
Dexter,2pma88,myotheralt,7,Wed Dec 17 22:42:05 2014 UTC,"I believe this is the correct answer.  An injury to the carotid would spurt blood because arterial blood flow is created by the heart's pumping. Venous blood flow relies on muscles and physical movement to ""push"" the blood through the veins.  Here's a video of the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypCGyhSTb2I"

Dexter,2pma88,sauerbreiale,5,Thu Dec 18 04:15:09 2014 UTC,It was touched upon that he had actually gone to med school but ended up dropping out.
Dexter,2pma88,saldigenova,3,Thu Dec 18 08:23:42 2014 UTC,"I'm aware of that, but still, the carotid artery and the jugular vein are so close to eachother. I'm just gonna go ahead and guess that he saw the difference in the blood. Arterial blood being slightly brighter red while venous is slightly darker."
Dexter,2pma88,dasher11,0,Wed Dec 17 22:14:38 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure how he could tell. He was standing several meters away when the woman got the spikes into her neck, and he could tell right away that she was already gone because the jugular vein was severed. How did he know this? Is it because there's a difference in the darkness/brightness in the jugular vein and carotid artery?   I think you are overthinking this. Med students could likely tell the difference fairly easily."
Dexter,2pma88,shit_storm_,2,Wed Dec 17 22:39:39 2014 UTC,"It was most likely a quick guess, or just something to say. If either one is slit you're fucked within a few seconds anyways.  However, if you really want to get technical, since he did go to med school he probably knew that the jugular vein is located peripheral to the coratid meaning it is easier to be cut."
Dexter,2pma88,ChappyMcFlappy,2,Thu Dec 18 01:05:18 2014 UTC,Blood from veins is dark red and doesn't spurt out.  Artery is bright red and sprays errwhere.
Dexter,2pma88,IanRankin,2,Thu Dec 18 02:36:57 2014 UTC,"Although the people here are giving you reasonable answers, I'm going to speak up as a med student: it's inaccurate TV drama.    In the scene in question, it's not easily distinguishable whether it's the carotid or the jugular (or both).  Color and pressure are different, yes, but not to the extent that they will look remarkably different to someone standing 20 yards away.  Not to mention, the woman's neck was partially constricted by the collar.  To sum it up:    It's very possible that the woman could survive, considering that EMS-trained staff was present. ""Jugular vein"" was only said because it's a much more recognizable term to the audience."

Dexter,2pgzv7,Cowboys2410,8,Tue Dec 16 17:32:59 2014 UTC,"Hmm, no I think Dexter talks specifically about how they brought him, Brian, and his mother to that shipping container to murder her. I think, it was somewhere in...season 2 when he's kind of letting himself go t Lila's suggestion, and working on the 12 steps and he goes and finds Jimenez to show forgiveness and ends up killing him.   Or, when he's in the shipping yard and Doakes finds him. It's some internal monologue, but I'm about 80% sure he says the guys took them to the shipping container."
Dexter,2pgzv7,ShardikOfTheBeam,3,Tue Dec 16 20:01:00 2014 UTC,Oh ok then I guess you could be right. I'm not too sure just for some reason them being found there sounded familiar for whatever reason.

Dexter,2pgzv7,Cowboys2410,16,Wed Dec 17 01:29:39 2014 UTC,Maybe they wanted to get her to confess or tell them what she told the police. Dexter and Brian could have been used as leverage in order to get information.
Dexter,2pgzv7,axleander02,5,Tue Dec 16 16:54:46 2014 UTC,This is what I'm thinking. She would have been more resistant to giving the information if her children were safe and elsewhere. Didn't really matter much though.

Dexter,2pbsyu,Drabbeynormalblues,5,Mon Dec 15 05:25:22 2014 UTC,You're completely right but that doesn't mean she ever accepted it as the truth. I don't want to spoil anything but the fact that she believes he's innocent comes out in a later season.
Dexter,2pbsyu,Nebakanezzer,11,Mon Dec 15 04:37:05 2014 UTC,"unfortunately, there's a lot of things that happen like this due to somewhat poor writing. It's hard to even call it that, but it's just one of those unspoken agreements between tv shows and viewers.   They're silently going, ""we're gunna just kinda, botch the details on this, which would make it completely unbelievable in real life, but you really don't want to sit through 15 minutes of mundane shit that is not really relevant to moving the story forward just to satisfy your skepticism, do you?"".. and as viewers we silently agree, ""yea, screw that noise"". Most people get so caught up in the story they suspend disbelief for stuff like this unless it's a huge plot hole.  I mean, look at all the stuff we accept. (spoilers) Dexter's brother is the ice truck killer, he's caught up in the bay harbor butcher fiasco, which in real life would make people suspicious for years, even if they did eventually ""prove"" doakes was the killer, trinity kills his wife, he becomes close friends with the ADA, who then promptly is murdered, he starts seeing jordan chase, who then goes missing, etc etc etc.  An entire police department, and several friends and family, and no one is suspicious after 3 or 4 things being WAY too coincidental?   There's plot holes all over the place because something like this would be near impossible to exist in real life. Batista's younger sister takes up babysitting for Dexter, so now he has no responsibilities and can just dump harrison on her all the time, at little notice, through the night. She thinks he's working insane hours at work, yet could easily cross reference this with her brother, yet never does, and it never comes up in casual conversation, ever.   Why doesn't this inevitable thing happen? Because then Batista would be like ""hey, why is this guy lying about where he is all night. Maybe I should look into that, you know, his best friend, wife, brother, next door neighbor, sergeant, religious advisor/friend, and several other people close to him died.. that's a bit too much for coincidence.""  And this is just the blaring ones that I can come up with off of memory. You can only go so many seasons of a guy killing dozens of people, many who his own station are investigating, many who are close to him personally, without it being completely ridiculous that someone hasn't gotten suspicious and caught on. Seriously, a neighbor who wasn't even interested in his business would realize after a month or two of the weird shit he does, at the hours he does them. Dexter would die of sleep deprivation halfway through a season, and be broke by the end of one.  As long as for the most part, the story is original, creative, fun, and entertaining, I am willing to look past most of that stuff, as I'm sure you and everyone else already has, or we wouldn't be here."
Dexter,2pbsyu,Almathecool,1 point,Mon Dec 15 12:29:54 2014 UTC,Wasn't she mad at Miguel because she saw how he was with her lawyer friend (Ellen?) and it kind of clicked with her more when they found her dead.

Dexter,2p9shi,joetheschmoe4000,3,Sun Dec 14 18:19:03 2014 UTC,"Yeah, for me personally, I liked the whole Saxon/Vogel thing. If I had to re do the series, I would put Saxon as the antagonist in season 3 (not replacing Prado, it's just I never considered him an antagonist). Dexter would kill Saxon in the same way in S3, causing suspicion on Dexter. This would lead Quinn/Laguerta to investigate Dexter, finding out who he is in S7, leading to a showdown in the shipping container. Deb shoots Dex, the end."
Dexter,2p8wzf,falcon4287,7,Sun Dec 14 08:21:12 2014 UTC,"The final episode itself wasn't terrible. It had a lot of ""really?"" moments, taking deb out unnoticed, surviving the ship wreck, lumberjack. It was an alright finale for what the season allowed. The problem was more so the final season.  Season 7 redeemed a show that lost it's luster since 4, it had a great set up for a shit storm of consequences for Dexter. It delievered none of that. If it wasn't the last season it wouldn't have been judged as harshly but it was. It could have been so much more."

Dexter,2p8wzf,RespectThyHypnotoad,5,Sun Dec 14 08:49:47 2014 UTC,"I don't mind him living, I think deb dying was handled pretty well and a good emotional end. The problem was all in the execution. The ending should have been a season long thing, planned and dealing with the incoming finale rather than a plain old season with a end thrown together in the last episode."
Dexter,2p8wzf,dexterbinge111,3,Sun Dec 14 09:12:45 2014 UTC,"You thought Deb's death was handled well? An apparently non-life threatening gun shot leading to a stroke convenient for the rushed, sloppy ending is what I saw. Then, to add onto all of the absurdity, Dexter is somehow able to carry her off to his boat without anyone noticing and speeding off into some bad CGI. It was bad. I cringed all the way to the credits."
Dexter,2p8wzf,magic8ball88,1 point,Sun Dec 14 09:47:35 2014 UTC,"Not that this makes the shipwreck believable, but when dexter was trying to sell his boat he mentions that it has a life raft on it. The plan all along was to fake his death not to kill himself."
Dexter,2p8wzf,ZombyWoof1992,3,Mon Dec 15 21:17:05 2014 UTC,"I dont think it deserves as much hate as it's gotten, but after such a brilliant show being so great for many years, I get all the reasons why season 8 and especially the finale feel like a slap in the face for people.  It seems the general consensus is that most people dislike Hannah McKay, or at least feel like she had no business coming back in season 8. Dexter didnt want to have to turn her in, but he loved Deb more, and needed to protect her, giving him no choice but to choose Deb, same way he did with Brian in season 1 when he was forced to kill him to protect her. That and because Hannah remained so unlikeable, and is still a dangerous serial killer, a lot of fans thought that it was very stupid and wrong of Dexter to trust Harrison to her. Maybe she really would shape up and be a good mother to him and prove everyone wrong, but we'll never know. Dexter would do anything for Harrison, and yet in the end he leaves him with the worst person he could've ended up in the care of.  Another thing people hate obviously would be Deb's death. Not everyone loved her character from what I've seen, but personally she was my favorite character on the show, and seeing her not only die, but be essentially ""killed"" off screen for such a stupid and lazily written reason (the blood clot that caused a stroke leaving her a vegetable) just seemed to be an insulting end to her. Not to mention it's rather ridiculous that nobody noticed Dexter leaving with her body on his boat or stopped him. And he also buried her at sea. It's never really made clear exactly where at sea he is, but this is where he dumps all his victims. He's leaving his beloved sister to sink into a trench full of dismembered body parts of killers, that's pretty fucked up. I dont know where else she could've gone, but most fans agree that she shouldnt have been given that kind of burial.  I guess to another extent also the notion they try to drive into your head about how dexter poisons everything he touches and how he cant have a happy life and be the bay harbor butcher. He's more of an antihero than an outright protagonist, because regardless of the fact he only kills bad people (most of the time) he's still a serial killer. And yet you still like Dexter for some reason, you root for him cause you still care about him. You dont want to see him lose everything, so seeing his entire life spiral out of control like that may have been the only possible thing that could've happened to him down that road, but you dont feel good seeing it happen to him. It doesnt feel like justice being served to a serial killer. It feels like your main character literally dying inside, it's hard to watch.  And of course the whole part about him randomly being in exile as a lumberjack seemed out of nowhere and it probably would've worked just as well if they'd left that scene out and the last scene was hannah walking off with harrison. I mean no one expected a happy ending, but I dont think anyone thought THIS is what we'd get.  Overall I'd say that Season 8 isnt as bad as everyone says. But it's certainly the weakest of them in terms of writing, and I can see why people wish this show had a more likeable sendoff."
Dexter,2p8wzf,ZombyWoof1992,1 point,Thu Dec 18 07:32:57 2014 UTC,"Thank you. I kind of figured most of those points, but I had yet hear anyone articulate them and was hoping for a response like this. I completely agree that adding the lumberjack Dexter at the end was a shitty way of trying to make the audience happy by not killing him but still ending the show the same, which shows that they were far too concerned about meta writing instead of thinking about the characters that they had spent 8 years building.    As far as Deb, I liked that it was grounded and unexpected, but it did seem forced for the plot. The show traditionally has been more grandiose and cinematic rather than grounded and gritty, so the complication with her becoming a vegetable wasn't in tune with the rest of the series.    I personally didn't have a problem with Hannah, but it felt a little forced when Harrison was suddenly in love with her at the first mention of her name, which I don't recall that being his feelings towards her the previous season (maybe I just don't remember, it's been a while).    I definitely didn't like the entire Dr. Vogel plot, and can see how that would have left a bad taste in anyone's mouth.    I guess I was just still feeling bitterness towards Season 7 and thus didn't have my expectations so high that there was anything to dash, which is why I didn't come away from the Season 8 finale with the ""wow that completely sucked balls"" mentality."
Dexter,2p8wzf,memo_rx,1 point,Thu Dec 18 07:53:47 2014 UTC,"I didnt ever want Dexter to die, and on some level that self exile makes sense, as the entire events of the show just prove that Dexter cannot maintain this double life and expect them to remain separate forever. It was eventually going to come crashing down at some point. There was just a lot about how the finale was handled that didnt make sense. I've heard a lot of people say that they felt like they were watching an entirely different show when they saw it, as something about it just didnt feel like Dexter.  And totally on board with you there about Deb. I know characters cant really be immortal, especially on a show like this, but killing her off just seemed cruel and unnecessary to do. All of that stuff with her death and Daniel Vogel just felt like more reasons to sell the ""Dexter kills everything he touches and he needs to save everyone from himself"" thing.  And I do remember being kinda taken by surprise how Harrison acted around her. I couldnt really recall much extended interaction between them. I know Harrison was only 3 or 4 in the last two seasons, but he jumps out of nowhere into saying he wants Hannah to be his new mom. Seems like a large leap out of nowhere.  I actually really liked the Dr Vogel plot at first really, the first time she mentioned that she didnt fit Harry's code and she walks off leaving Dexter dumbstruck was one of my favorite moments on the show personally, but I can totally understand why it kinda trailed off later...and of course yet again cause Dexter cant be happy, she dies too.  I still feel at the end that Season 8 gets a little too much hate, but I've never really been on board with the people who feel like the show stopped being good after the end of season 4"
Dexter,2p8wzf,chromofilmblurs,2,Thu Dec 18 08:07:38 2014 UTC,"I thought apart from the lumberjack thing the last episode wasn'T that bad.. just the whole last season was complete shit  After an awesome 7th season (probably the best with S2 and S4) they really fucked up its like they changed the writers no suspense or tension  boring ass vogel with her family problems, Hannah who was interesting in S7 gets boring, boring side plots, no hunt for dexter etc..  yep S8 was boring I will always stop at S7 on rewatches (and imagine Deb killed Dexter) much better ending"
Dexter,2p7q38,T-PRENDY,3,Sat Dec 13 23:38:15 2014 UTC,"Well, the writers clearly wanted to do an ending where Dexter (and the audience) realize that Dexter is poison, that every life he touches is destroyed. And they're right, the theme of the whole show revolves around this.  However, in season 4 when Dexter is talking to Trinity before he kills him, Dexter says ""Nothing is inevitable.""   That quote always stuck with me for some reason. It's very uplifting. I think it means that fate isn't set in stone, that we still have time to prevent something from happening as long as it hasn't happened yet.   So here is my ending:   At the end of season 7 where Deb's life is basically ruined, Dexter realizes that he is destined to destroy everyone around him. Season 8 is about Dexter trying to prevent his fate. He is frantically struggling to repair his relationship with Deb. Along the way, he realizes that his (platonic) love for Deb overrides his Dark Passenger, in a similar way as how his love for Hannah got rid of the passenger in the original ending. Dexter refuses to go back to Hannah in season 8 because the whole point of him turning Hannah in was that he was putting Debra first. Hannah comes after Dexter and Deb. Dexter is forced to kill her and it's really hard for him to do it, but he does it anyway. We think everything is going to be ok but then Saxon shoots at Debra. However, Dexter takes the bullet for her. (or some other situation where Dexter has to sacrifice himself for her.) Dexter dies. Debra lives on to raise Harrison, marry Quinn, and become a detective again.   Essentially, Dexter goes through a complete character transformation. However, I feel that the buildup of the show justifies it. This ending  would wrap things up a little neater and give the story some real closure. It is much more consistent with the previous events as well. No stupid plot holes. And I think Dexter's sacrifice would send a really positive message to the audience.   ""Fate is not set in stone. Who you are is not set in stone. People can change. Nothing is inevitable.""     Oh and I'm a sucker for Debra. She was a really complex character and you can't help but feel bad for her through the whole show. She deserves more than a random and amazing unlucky twist of fate."
Dexter,2p7q38,MysticExarch,1 point,Wed Dec 17 09:19:23 2014 UTC,"This has been discussed/thought about by a lot of people, with varying responses. But I think it's generally agreeable that most people would want to give a more definitive conclusion to Dexter's story (for example, when he drives his boat out into the storm, he would actually die) rather than the open ended conclusion that is given."
Dexter,2p7q38,shadow56399,1 point,Sun Dec 14 03:23:43 2014 UTC,I really wanted him to get caught. I wanted Doakes to get his named cleared and then realize that dexter had killed the people that went missing. Would probably save Miami metro a lot of time and money if Dexter came clean.
Dexter,2p7q38,magic8ball88,1 point,Mon Dec 15 21:19:01 2014 UTC,"For me the simple route would have been okay. He didn't have to die.  I would have liked to see Deb find peace and just to back to Miami homicide.  Dex meets up with Hannah and harrison in Argentina and all is hunky dory.  Other than that, I hated how horrible of a detective Quinn was and would have loved to see him go down for being a dirty cop.  I was fine with Batista just being himself and none more the aware.   I know my ending is too cliche or vanilla.  Jut locking up Dex would have been just as boring.  The only other option is saw was Deb killing Dex but that would be too much for her psyche and she would just go into Jesse pinkman mode and cry like a little bitch for the rest of her life."

Then Deb shows up impregnated by Angel. Angel, distraught, kills himself by erotic asphyxiation. Then Brian comes back and stabs dex in the heart. Walt kills him with the help of Don Draper. Then when Walter leans in to kiss Dexter one last time, Dexter reanimates and bites Walt in the neck. Walt falls on the ground bleeding out as baby blue plays. Then Jesse  calls the cops. and when he hangs up says, "" Shit i forgot to..."" then cuts to black Soprano style. After the credits, there's a scene where Michael C Hall, Jeff Lindsay, John Dahl, and some more of the cast stand in a black room with straight faces. then they start to laugh and flip off the audience. It ends with the words, ""U Mad, Bro?...Fuck You Very Much - Showtime"""
Dexter,2p7q38,kingkoons,1 point,Thu Dec 18 03:58:40 2014 UTC,"SO I just finished the series last night and in an attempt to cope with the shitstorm of Hurricane Laura, I stayed up another hour and created this alternate Season 8 that I would've thoroughly enjoyed while still keeping some elements from the writers. I like the idea of the Brain Surgeon and Zach in the story before they were both pointlessly killed off, so I'm going to change their stories a bit, but I'm leaving Hannah out of it. I imagine this taking place over 4 or 5 episodes.  Deb drives off the road to kill herself and Dexter. In that episode, the Brain Surgeon also kills Jamie in Dexter's apartment but makes it look like it's Zach. Dex and Harrison come home and find Jamie on the floor, and Dex tries his best to protect him. He's pissed that his son is exposed to this violence once again.   Dex is forced to drop off Harrison with Deb, who's still shaken but willing to watch Harrison, and goes to his house to kill Zach in his studio, but Zach has evidence it was the Brain Surgeon setting him up. They work together to kill the BS, and find out he was Dr. Vogel's son. Dex confront's Vogel and she breaks down, but ushers Dex to leave immediately. Vogel had no idea her son was alive. Dex gets to Debs to pick up Harrison and finds both of them gone.   Dex gets a call from Batista, shaken up by the death of his sister, who calls and says Harrison is at the station. Batista explains that Harrison and Deb were here together, but she just dissapeared. Deb had come to Batista with ""something important"" but now she was no where to be found. While picking up Harrison, he finds sign of a struggle in the parking lot and finds another brain part in a jar hidden nearby. Vogel.   He speeds to her house with Harrison in the back seat asleep, locks the doors, and hopes he'll stay this time. He goes inside and finds Vogel's house is set up as a kill room. Deb's on the table, Vogel and Zach standing around her. Vogel explains that Deb's death was inevitable, that with Deb in his life, Dex couldn't be the true psychopath that he really was. It doesn't matter what Dex wants to be because he is already a serial killer, and this was the only way he could remain focused and do what he needed to do to keep the world safe. Vogel screams at Zach to do it, to kill Deb. Dex leaps across the room and tackels Vogel, startling Zach. Zach runs in frame and tries to pull Dex off of Vogel, but Dex wrestles the knife from his hand and stabs Vogel. He gets up quickly and goes after Zach who's on his way out of the room, then he spots the knife in Deb's chest.   She's still alive, but barely. He grabs Deb and rushes her to the hospital. He can't call cops to the scene just yet. Deb's condition is stable but she's badly hurt. Metro Homicide arrives at the hospital and questions Dexter. It's revealed that the only way Deb survived this long was because she was wrapped in plastic, but they have no idea where Deb was stabbed or by who. Dexter uses his son as an excuse to quickly leave, but he knows he doesn't have much time until he's arrested and questioned.   Dex is terrified for Harrison and drives him to Orlando to be with Aster and Cody. When Metro can't find him, they think he's left town. Dex comes back and knows that he needs to hunt down Zach. He sneaks back into the hospital to see what clues Debra can give him on Zach's whereabouts. Debra tells him some helpful information on Zach, but she's upset that he cares more about catching the killer than caring about her or Harrison. She says that he's a hurricane, destroying everything in his path, and that he deserves prison. Debra's rage pushes her body of the edge, and Dexter watches her have a heart attack. The doctors try to save her, but she's gone.   The moment he's alone with her, he sneaks her out of the hospital and takes her out to sea on his boat. He dumps her body off the boat and lets the water claim his last victim. Deb was right.   Meanwhile, Batista and Quinn heard Deb mention something about Dr. Vogel and decide to go talk to her. At her home, they find her body on the floor, the kill room, and the bloody knife. Forensics finds Dex's fingerprints, as well as Zach's on the knife, which was the same one that killed Vogel and Deb. The hospital calls and informs them that not only is Deb dead, but the body is missing. Dexter was spotted putting what looked like a body in the trunk of his car and frantically driving away from the hospital. Batista and Quinn issue a manhunt on Dexter. Quinn deducts that Dexter might be taking her out on his boat and they both jump to check Dexter's pier.   Dex arrives back at the dock and spots the police cars pulling up. He jumps off the boat and hides in the shadows. Voice over, ""This is it. This is what my life has come to. This is what I am and what I'll always be. Running. I'm a serial killer. A murderer. I feel alive."" He smiles. The police spot his boat, quickly search it, and fan out to see if he's still nearby. Dexter's trying to slip away when...  Zach jumps out of the shadows and injects him with M99.   Dexter wakes up gently. He stares at the camera dreamily. Then he realizes he's strapped to a table with plastic wrap. He's in a kill room very similar to his own.   ""What do you think?"" Zach asks.  ""It's okay for a beginner. Not as many mistakes as I made at your age.""  ""Do you know why you're here?""  ""You're gonna kill me?"" ""I'm sorry I have to do this,"" Zach replies. ""I need to do this. My life depends on it. I'm going to disappear. The police will think you killed me along with Debra and Vogel. You're the Bay Harbor Butcher. Vogel told me about the drug guy you killed in Nebraska, the convenience store guy you killed just south of here. It's nothing compared to all the good you've done, but enough to justify all this. You're a killer, Dex. And so am I. But unlike you, I don't crave a family. Love. Normality. You can't have it all Dex, and it was foolish of you to try.""  Dex's voiceover comes in over a slow overhead zoom in on his face. ""All the innocent lives I destroyed. LaGuerta. Doakes. Deb. Harrison."" his voice flickers ""I'm the evil the code trained me to kill. I'm the hurricane. I'm the psychopath."" He smiles with tears in his eyes as Zach's knife stabs him in the chest. ""I'm the monster.""  Black out.   This is just quick summary of the ending I wanted to see. Sorry if it's a bit jumpy. I'm not a TV series writer."
Dexter,2p7q38,cornbreadsays,1 point,Thu Dec 18 21:45:13 2014 UTC,"It doesn't really make sense to me that Zach and Vogel would do that. It's not really in their character. Zach's an amateur and kind of an aloof fool, so there is no way he'd learn fast enough. Plus he's not really such a good guy like you make him out to be, especially if in your ending he kills Deb.    EDIT: Also, I don't think Dexter is as a destructive influence on people's lives as some fans seem to think he is. In fact, it could be argued that he has a more positive affect on people than a negative one. Think about what Dexter has done:  -Deb would have had a mental breakdown without him to support her -got Deb promoted -saved Deb's life 3 times (Brian, Travis' crazy follower, Speltzer)  -saved Astor and Cody's lives from Lila -got rid of Paul Bennett  There are really only two things he fucked up on: Rita's death, and Deb shooting Laguerta. In the case of Rita, it was bad luck. In the case of Deb and Laguerta, well Deb has to take responsibility for her own actions.    Just my thoughts."
Dexter,2p7q38,MysticExarch,0,Fri Dec 19 07:45:36 2014 UTC,literally change the last season so deb rats out dexter to the police and the entire season is one giant manhunt for dexter.Doesn't really matter whether he escapes or gets caught from there because then the show would be forced to actually have consequences and plot progression

It doesn't feel like ""Dexter"" anymore. I didn't like season 2 because of this one really, really annoying character and the fact that it was just too up-in-your-face ""high stakes"" constantly.   Do not watch season 8. You may be tempted to see how it ends. Please resist the urge, it's what is in your best interest.   So 1-7 and then stop. Or just 1, 3, 4, 7 if you want the best of the best."
Dexter,2p63mn,shikamaruispwn,1 point,Wed Dec 17 09:36:46 2014 UTC,"Writing quality drops noticeably after season 4, and if you're looking for a place to stop with the least amount of loose ends season 4 would be a good place.  I thought season 5 was pretty good, but after that the show just felt like a joke to me. I guess whether or not you like the last 4 seasons depends on why you liked the first 4. However, the series finale is the biggest train wreck I've ever seen on TV. I still think that the writers wrote it as some kind of joke and it somehow got approved for production."
Dexter,2p63mn,Pointwest418,2,Sat Dec 13 16:36:24 2014 UTC,"Season 7 was one of the better seasons, at least to me"
Dexter,2p63mn,dexterbinge111,1 point,Sun Dec 14 15:14:09 2014 UTC,"Watch seasons 1-2, skip 3, watch 4-5, skip 6, watch 7. Stop."
Dexter,2p0s2h,Agastopia,3,Thu Dec 11 23:04:34 2014 UTC,Its not very dexter like but I like to think he left her there
Dexter,2p0s2h,bounty1663,7,Thu Dec 11 23:54:05 2014 UTC,I mean even if he did leave her there how would the French police ever catch him so I guess that's an option
Dexter,2p0s2h,em0ng,1 point,Fri Dec 12 01:56:05 2014 UTC,He injected her with (poison or potassium chloride?) and left her there.
Dexter,2p0s2h,cheekybrat,5,Fri Dec 12 01:32:24 2014 UTC,Didn't he stab her?
Dexter,2p0s2h,rollingintheshallow,3,Fri Dec 12 01:53:53 2014 UTC,"Yes, he stabbed her and zipped her into a (body?) bag."
Dexter,2p0s2h,so0ks,6,Fri Dec 12 08:16:17 2014 UTC,"No, he strangled her with a bike lock and put her body in a bath of hydrochloric acid."
Dexter,2p0abk,Mikjaash,20,Thu Dec 11 20:40:19 2014 UTC,Spilling red wine on a wedding dress is seen as a bad omen for the marriage - I think it was an allusion to that.
Dexter,2p0abk,Splogan,7,Thu Dec 11 21:37:08 2014 UTC,That is perfect!
Dexter,2p0abk,Lilrev16,2,Thu Dec 11 21:56:13 2014 UTC,"Remember he saw her before the ceremony too, more bad luck.  But personally I think the drop of wine foreshadowed her death more than anything else..."
Dexter,2p0abk,NameForMyAccount,10,Fri Jan 2 22:32:19 2015 UTC,I always saw it as her being tainted by dexter
Dexter,2p0abk,penquinkid,5,Thu Dec 11 21:06:24 2014 UTC,Could be foreshadowing the fact that she dies at the end of the 4th season due to Dexter's secret life as a serial killer

Dexter,2p0abk,southpaw101,2,Thu Dec 11 23:41:40 2014 UTC,Oh true.  I completely skipped over that word.

Dexter,2p0y1z,kingkoons,1 point,Thu Dec 11 23:55:37 2014 UTC,"I liked the books a lot!  They go off in a very different direction from the show, though, after the first one.  For me, they are a great complement to the series. If I were you, I would start with just one or two to see if you like them, then go from there."
Dexter,2p0y1z,GinaZaneburritos,1 point,Fri Dec 12 07:54:23 2014 UTC,"For sure. Completely different storylines (after the first book), different people from the show die/survive, and Dexter remains the cold, perfect killer he was in the early seasons of the show."
Dexter,2p0y1z,nuggetinabuiscuit,1 point,Fri Dec 12 13:18:44 2014 UTC,"I just finished the first book, Darkly Dreaming Dexter, it's pretty much the groundwork for season 1 of the TV show. Darkly Dreaming Dexter is missing a lot of the sub plot of season one (Deb falling in love with ITK, that Cuban smuggler, the suicide shrink). It's over simplified season 1, basically. Also, the books have a lot more humour."
Dexter,2p0y1z,enoz_moth_balls,1 point,Sat Dec 13 04:42:03 2014 UTC,"Yes.  I just started the book series for the second time.  The show really captures the feel of the books, while offering different plotlines."
Dexter,2p0y1z,hannibalmorgan,0,Sat Dec 13 06:52:23 2014 UTC,"The books are interesting, they are very different from the TV show but are still interesting, and deal with dexter and his problems in the world in a more season 1 way of the show perspective."

Dexter,2ox77h,sfrasermait,7,Thu Dec 11 00:35:03 2014 UTC,"The first book is very close to the first season of the show. You get some smaller details that they couldn't fit into the show, and there are some major differences near the end. It's a good read though. Good writing. Get the rest if you like the first! :) If you liked the show, you'll like the book. Gets more into his emotionless side because he can monologue."
Dexter,2ox77h,Zombilina,2,Thu Dec 11 02:52:26 2014 UTC,"Thinking of reading the series, how is it?"
Dexter,2ox77h,PM_ME_Y0UR_PR0BLEMS,1 point,Sun Dec 14 22:25:30 2014 UTC,"If you like the show, you'll like the books. Sometimes they get kind of slow, but they're not very long books either so they pick back up quick even when that happens. You get to see a lot more into Dexter's mind, and he has actual conversations with his Dark Passenger and such. They're pretty good."
Dexter,2ox77h,Zombilina,1 point,Sun Dec 14 22:57:18 2014 UTC,"So it's written in 1st person, yes?"
Dexter,2ox77h,bigsickselby,1 point,Thu Dec 11 15:38:34 2014 UTC,"Yes. Or first personS, since the Dark Passenger kind of takes over as the narrator at some points."
Dexter,2ox77h,Treedom_Lighter,2,Thu Dec 11 16:33:11 2014 UTC,The first one is good and worth reading. The rest... not so much.
Dexter,2ox77h,whateverthatis,2,Thu Dec 11 19:04:44 2014 UTC,"I've learned not to talk about the books on this subreddit because everyone shits on them. I'm not sure about later ones, but the first one is quite good and I honestly couldn't put it down. It's nearly the same plotline as season one, but with some HUGE differences. It's a really dark, funny, and exciting read."
Dexter,2ox77h,GrammarWizard,1 point,Thu Dec 11 04:03:58 2014 UTC,"After the first book, the book and the show kind of split off. The show kind of tries to portray dexter as more human and focuses on that side of him, whereas the books kind of accept that he is a cold blooded killer and don't try to add any sort of ""human"" aspects. I like the books a lot better that way personally."
Dexter,2ox77h,higuy5121,1 point,Thu Dec 11 04:35:48 2014 UTC,No one mentioned the Dexter in the show is a lot more introverted than the one in the books.
Dexter,2ox77h,webowinitsaura,1 point,Thu Dec 11 06:46:06 2014 UTC,"Just go into it expecting for it not to be the same. It's basically the same premise but a totally different story after the first half of the book or so. As long as you're expecting it and not disappointed in that, you will love it. The books are really great!"

Dexter,2ow0ro,R0ckymarshmalow,3,Wed Dec 10 20:10:49 2014 UTC,yes you should. you have to decide for yourself if you think season 8 is bad or not.
Dexter,2ow0ro,Manakete,1 point,Thu Dec 11 19:55:55 2014 UTC,"I just finished watching Season 8 about five minutes ago. Watch it, you need closure with this type of show."
Dexter,2ow0ro,buccofan,1 point,Thu Dec 11 02:09:38 2014 UTC,I felt the same way and asked this question a few days ago. Season 8 is different. Its not horrible but it seems like the writers just wanted to end the show. Its not good but it wasn't enough to ruin my favorite TV show.
Dexter,2ow0ro,PCGCentipede,-5,Wed Dec 10 22:48:01 2014 UTC,"No, the ending is bad enough that it taints the entirety of the show."

Dexter,2okoi0,imisscrazylenny,23,Sun Dec 7 20:37:37 2014 UTC,"came here to say the same thing... like clearly he HAD to adapt to real life. people were trying to catch him. they were getting closer. if police were after you and getting closer would you want to stay in one place for too long, especially when there is blood and shit? the show cant stay the same forever. if thats the case watch season 1 over and over. people evolve and adapt. get over it  sorry about ranting. people just get annoying about him changing."
Dexter,2okoi0,SkaJamas,16,Sun Dec 7 20:47:26 2014 UTC,and couldnt there be a possibility of sloppiness in his desperation? Like idk...they did this kinda stuff on purpose?!?!?
Dexter,2okoi0,McWeaksauce91,6,Sun Dec 7 21:45:40 2014 UTC,"This, exactly. He isn't a static character. A main conflict in the show was him getting sloppy as he went on. He was caught several times, as early as season 3.   The whole point of the damn show was him trying to reconcile his dark passenger to the needs of the every day family man. That's what gave us the Trinity case study. Dexter wanted to know how another serial killer managed a family on the side."

Dexter,2okoi0,Stalast,11,Sun Dec 7 20:50:55 2014 UTC,"Well, if it's fresh blood, then maybe it would have washed away quite easily unlike a dried up patch of blood."
Dexter,2okoi0,thecurbstomper,3,Sun Dec 7 21:03:10 2014 UTC,"The reason he was so specific with cleaning blood is because it leaves a story. In this case, washing it with a hose wouldn't really clean it. If you were to be looking for evidence, a simple tool would reveal the huge pool of blood that Dexter simply hosed down.   As mentioned higher up, I don't think it's an inconsistency. It's character development."
Dexter,2okoi0,Devchonachko,2,Mon Dec 8 11:48:58 2014 UTC,It's called character arc.
Dexter,2oi7mi,jazzGiraffe,20,Sun Dec 7 00:21:07 2014 UTC,I never sympathized with Hannah. She tried to kill Deb and then I wanted her ass dead forever.
Dexter,2oi7mi,bumtowntrainer,16,Sun Dec 7 08:27:19 2014 UTC,I didn't really feel that he was a bad father until the series finale. I didn't like Hannah mostly because I didn't really understand why they brought her back for season 8. I thought her storyline ended just fine at the end of 7.
Dexter,2oi7mi,badwolf7850,12,Sun Dec 7 02:30:32 2014 UTC,Agreed. My dad really hated how he abandoned Harrison with her though. He said if he truly loved his son he would do absolutely anything to raise him in the right conditions and try to keep him from going down the same path that Dexter did.
Dexter,2oi7mi,xcompanioncube,16,Sun Dec 7 03:16:45 2014 UTC,"I think Rita's parents would have been the best option, if he wasn't going to keep him."
Dexter,2oi7mi,badwolf7850,13,Sun Dec 7 03:55:34 2014 UTC,"Definitely. It feels selfish. He's taking Harrison away from his family, leaving him with another serial killer because he loves her."
Dexter,2oi7mi,xcompanioncube,1 point,Sun Dec 7 04:41:07 2014 UTC,"agreed, and yes Jamie Dexter's nanny pretty much took care of Harrison. Where do I find a nanny like her ?"
Dexter,2oi7mi,Philligan123,7,Tue Dec 9 12:56:01 2014 UTC,Well he was a sociopath so you can't blame him for not winning #1 Dad
Dexter,2oi7mi,Tooky17,2,Sun Dec 7 07:29:14 2014 UTC,He was kind of a terrible human being all around but you gotta love him
Dexter,2oi7mi,HO8NO8GO8LIN,2,Sun Dec 7 04:51:59 2014 UTC,He seemed to destroy the lives of anyone that was close to him. He was a horrible person. Yet somehow we loved him anyway.
Dexter,2oi7mi,rhtufts,4,Sun Dec 7 07:06:29 2014 UTC,"Season 8 pretty much ruined Dexter as a character for me. This is one of the reasons why. Hannah, firstly, shouldn't even be given a second thought. He should have just ignored her, for his kids sake at least if not for his own sake. Secondly, Dexter spent most of the previous three seasons caring about his child more than anything and what not. Then in season 8 he just leaves him with Hannah and decides to be a lumber Jack and gives up on himself like the previous seasons meant nothing.   I like to pretend season 8 didn't exist."
Dexter,2oi7mi,Envious_of_Apathy,0,Sun Dec 7 16:11:37 2014 UTC,"You know who was a good father? Charles Manson.  Seriously,  don't debate the validity of a serial killers parenting ability... Kind of a silly plot point to get hung up on for a show like this lol"
Dexter,2oi7mi,bikesNmuffins,1 point,Sun Dec 7 10:25:23 2014 UTC,"Charles Manson isn't a serial killer...  Anyway, I don't think Dexter is capable of love. Isn't that sort of the point? He feels it necessary to be a good father, but knows that he ultimately won't be."
Dexter,2oi7mi,Envious_of_Apathy,1 point,Sun Dec 7 11:59:28 2014 UTC,"Charles Manson isn't a serial killer like OJ didn't do it, just because you don't get your hands dirty doesn't mean you aren't culpable for the crime. No, that isn't the point, the point wasn't to run away from being a father, the point was to run away from EVERYONE he cared about, not just Harrison.  I'm not defending his ability as a parent, I'm saying that out of the whole series I don't understand why his neglect of harrison was any more stunning than predeath Rita  Dexter gets into an intense situation, Rita calls ""Dexter I need you"" ad infinitum... They solved the fact that was getting stale by getting rid of Rita and everyone wants to know what's up with Harrison instead of Astor and Cody who just get written out for the next like 20 episodes...   In the grand scheme of Dexter, Harrison,  in my opinion, is the absolute least important point of focus and was only put in the show for the ""oh my god he has my son"" scene."
Dexter,2oi9tf,Erekt__Butthole,3,Sun Dec 7 00:43:14 2014 UTC,"I agree with you entirely, except for the season 4 finale option. Yeah, that was a great season finale, but it was exiting waiting to see how dexter would deal with it, take care of the kids on his own, see if people got suspicious about maybe him killing his wife, etc. I personally would have wanted a finale where dexter was found out, and died, not neccasarily by the death penalty, but in some other way. I want closure, not anything open-ended"
Dexter,2oi9tf,scarlet_overlord,10,Sun Dec 7 15:48:52 2014 UTC,"After the first season, I was hooked. After the 4th season, it was my favorite show on television. Those last couple of seasons just completed ruined everything."
Dexter,2oi9tf,mcgaheyd,1 point,Sun Dec 7 07:28:10 2014 UTC,"I thought there was way more potential for season 7 with Deb finding out about Dex. Way more should have happened with that, along with Deb's infatuation with Dex. Could have made that the final season with a whole shitstorm flipping Dexter's world upside down. Instead Deb handled it too well, and the sideplots of Hannah McKay and the Koshka Brotherhood were thrown in to eat up more time, and meh."
Dexter,2oi9tf,hockeystew,1 point,Fri Jan 2 22:36:43 2015 UTC,"definitely agree. I also think they should consider writing an alternate season 8. one where batista is a little more persistent. could be muuuch better, and it would be interesting as no show has really done that before."
Dexter,2oi9tf,blink5694,3,Sun Dec 7 16:56:47 2014 UTC,"I thought the worst part about Season 8 was how easily the police and investigators just shrugged off everything Dexter did.  The season could have gone so much better if the police were looking in to him and he was starting to lose his grip on the façade he held for so long.  As his identity comes peeling away he could have gone through the personal transformation of wondering how much of his humanity was faked similarly to what they attempted to do with the whole ""oooo do I love Hannah?"" plot."
Dexter,2oi9tf,super_sayanything,1 point,Tue Dec 9 16:31:21 2014 UTC,What didn't make sense to me is it seemed like Joey knew who Dexter was at one point and then that totally went away.  A good last season would have been Joey and Batista figuring out who Dexter was then maybe needing him to catch the biggest killer yet despite wanting to bring him in. Coming to grips with his reality and maybe getting off but his dark passenger not being a secret anymore and he's banished never to kill again. It had to be Dexter coming in to his own reality vs. Everyone in his life he's hid from.
Dexter,2oi9tf,blink5694,1 point,Sun Dec 14 20:19:43 2014 UTC,"Yeah there was that plot line in I want to say season three where Joey sort of figured out that Dexter killed people.  He didn't have it all figured out, but he knew something was up with Dexter.  It seemed really bad when the writers just abandoned that thread and didn't have Joey pursue his suspicions or even mention them again."
Dexter,2oi9tf,super_sayanything,1 point,Sun Dec 14 20:24:54 2014 UTC,"For him to have all those people close to them be killed because of him and never have to own up for that, well as we all know it's poor writing. He should have had to face Angel over killing LaGuerta."
Dexter,2oi9tf,blink5694,1 point,Sun Dec 14 20:57:31 2014 UTC,It would have been much more dramatically satisfying to have everybody know the truth about Dexter.  Seeing people's reactions and having the truth come out would have been poetic.
Dexter,2oi9tf,super_sayanything,1 point,Mon Dec 15 00:39:11 2014 UTC,Agreed.
Dexter,2oi9tf,blink5694,1 point,Mon Dec 15 00:56:53 2014 UTC,"I would absolutely love for this to happen.  I think they could write a great mini season that wraps everything up perfectly.  I don't know if they would have it be an alternate season or a follow up, but I think those original writers are skilled enough to bring everything together well.   Even if they have to take some alternative means to get around legal stuff like making it a comic book series or a novel or an animated series I would be happy.  Any way to get me a satisfying conclusion to what could have gone down as one of the best shows ever.  It's just such a fucking shame that Dexter ended with such a bad taste.  It will forever be remembered as ""that show with the terrible final season"" instead of ""that show that was great and intense all the way through""."
Dexter,2oi9tf,kingkoons,1 point,Tue Dec 9 16:28:23 2014 UTC,"i'd love it. they should do a season where Dexter goes on a self destructive rampage killing in overtime because the death of rita makes him realize his life is short. at the end they catch him, or he commits suicide, or some other major failure and realizes that despite all the 'chaotic good' he has done, his greatest achievement was Harrison and he wont get to watch his kid grow up"

Dexter,2oh80y,buccofan,6,Sat Dec 6 18:39:16 2014 UTC,"First episode is not bad, actually good in my opinion. Then it gets downhill until the finale where it hits rock-bottom.   But seriously, just watch them and don't worry much about it. Just keep in mind that the first four seasons were probably one of the best seasons in television history."
Dexter,2oh80y,neo7,9,Sat Dec 6 19:12:25 2014 UTC,"Apparently I'm some kind of mindless fucktard compared to others around here, but I loved every season."
Dexter,2oh80y,gtaguy12345,1 point,Sun Dec 7 03:41:23 2014 UTC,"I agree.  However, I already had my expectations set so unreasonably low for Season 8, just from talking to friends, I think anything would have surpasses them."
Dexter,2oh80y,frating,3,Mon Dec 8 03:01:33 2014 UTC,Lower your expectations... greatly... expect it to be the worst season ever which is putting it lightly...
Dexter,2oh80y,Chiddaling,2,Sat Dec 6 18:58:59 2014 UTC,"I just did my first re-watch since the series ended last year. Currently watching Season 8 Episode 11 and I've gotta confirm for you: this is the worst season of Dexter by far. It's like a half-assed spin-off series. Honestly, I'm going to watch Season 1 again after this ends, just to wash the taste out of my mouth.    Seasons 1-4 are in the top 10 seasons of TV period, in my opinion. Season 5 is different, tough to follow Season 4 but still it did its job. Season 6 was interesting, personally I liked it. 7 was interesting as well, but 8 is just, eh. So much potential for a unique show like this, and they just dropped the fkn ball."
Dexter,2oh80y,Brasil_Nuts,1 point,Sat Dec 6 20:51:53 2014 UTC,Thanks for the feedback guys
Dexter,2oh80y,bigsickselby,1 point,Sat Dec 6 22:40:22 2014 UTC,"Whether or not season 8 is good or not is completely subjective. I found it to be okay, but my sister was disgusted by it. Just watch it and try being open minded."
Dexter,2oic5p,Mattpalmq,4,Sun Dec 7 01:08:14 2014 UTC,"In season 1, episode 9 (Father Knows Best) we learn that Dexter's biological father was a guy named Joe Driscoll. He died and left his house to Dexter. Rita and Dexter spend the weekend cleaning it out, and Deb and Rudy (the ITK) show up surprisingly to help. While Joe Driscoll's body is still in the morgue, Dexter manages to get a sample of his DNA, to test it against his to be sure. Deb finds out and berates Dexter for doing so, claiming that it shouldn't matter because Harry was always there for him, and raised him as if he were his own."
Dexter,2oic5p,Jakethrowsdwn,2,Sun Dec 7 01:37:39 2014 UTC,"No, Harry is not his biological dad. Harry took the case because Dexter's biological mother was a CI (confidential informant) for Harry and Miami Metro in general. It was an affair on Harry's part, and he adopted Dexter because he felt largely responsible for the death of Dexter's mother."
Dexter,2o9s5m,Blasti,12,Thu Dec 4 16:35:16 2014 UTC,I didn’t anticipate things would go this way. Maybe I’ll just go to the Pacific Northwest and chop down trees.   Oh you.
Dexter,2o9s5m,Kyursworn,3,Thu Dec 4 22:47:30 2014 UTC,"That's the best post-DEXTER interview of MCH's I've read.    It's interesting to hear him admit that playing Dexter kind of fucked with his head, if only slightly. Also interesting is his recounting of the confluence of events that occurred right after season 4. It kind of makes a little more sense, after reading that, why the second half of the show was so scattered compared to the first."
Dexter,2o7ene,Manthejelly,26,Wed Dec 3 23:44:16 2014 UTC,Damn yo... They did Rita dirty. Not even an honorable mention
Dexter,2o7ene,joca23,6,Thu Dec 4 04:51:36 2014 UTC,"I'd put season 4 rita ahead of lyla honestly,and of course lumen, and a close second to hannah in her seasons."
Dexter,2o7ene,der1x,4,Thu Dec 4 07:49:56 2014 UTC,"It would be a better kill,fuck, marry scenario. I think most would marry hannah."
Dexter,2o7ene,DCBizzle,13,Thu Dec 4 05:42:44 2014 UTC,"Personally I would go fuck Lyla, marry Hannah, kill Lumen. Lyla just seems like she would be such a good lay, I'd stick my dick in that crazy."

Dexter,2o7ene,qwedswerty,0,Thu Dec 4 19:53:21 2014 UTC,"Lyla is a fucked up psychopath who deserves to die while lumen is just... Not the same atleast. Remember kill isn't a null-choice, it's probably the most important choice, while fuck should be by far the least important."
Dexter,2o7ene,Skdeuce,6,Thu Dec 4 17:14:40 2014 UTC,Yeah this was probably the best response in the thread. Great AMA. Reminded me how much I miss that show.
Dexter,2o7ene,AlWinchester,9,Thu Dec 4 05:45:13 2014 UTC,"I don't know, ""100 duck shaped doakes or 1 doakes shaped duck?"" was a great one too."
Dexter,2o7ene,FRE3STYL3R,6,Thu Dec 4 08:29:48 2014 UTC,Yup I haven't found a show that has field dexters void....
Dexter,2o7ene,DumbHotdog,5,Thu Dec 4 07:39:19 2014 UTC,Sherlock's good in it's own way but not a Dexter replacement. We don't quite have a Doakes or Debra or Masuka there.

Dexter,2o6uam,r3djak,23,Wed Dec 3 20:51:55 2014 UTC,"Such a calm, authentic and well-thought AMA, no meaningless half-assed answer,   Really felt the human transpiring in those.   And as a bonus, all of those little italic written gestures or thought ""chuckles"" ""smiles"" ""hahaha""... felt a bit like dexter's inner voice trying to sneak in."
Dexter,2o6uam,LoneRavers,9,Wed Dec 3 22:20:16 2014 UTC,"If you already knew this, just forget about it, but someone from Reddit's staff was actually reading the questions and typing out his answers, so anything in italics was either her input, or her typing out how he responded non-verbally. I thought that added a lot to the AMA, getting insight into how he was responding physically."
Dexter,2o6uam,nanapuss,7,Wed Dec 3 23:06:05 2014 UTC,That whole AMA was full of great responses. Was definitely one of the better AMA's I've seen on reddit
Dexter,2o6uam,bowhunter6274,5,Thu Dec 4 03:43:23 2014 UTC,Link to the AMA
Dexter,2o6uam,bumtowntrainer,2,Thu Dec 4 02:08:35 2014 UTC,I loved his honesty about how it was working with his ex wife. And that John Lithgow was his favorite villian.

Dexter,2o9ejr,PurpleAkisMuscleRub,6,Thu Dec 4 14:21:05 2014 UTC,"Seems like once a season.   Then again, his apartment has all those wall-window things to vent and let ocean air in.  Not like it's the most secure place in the world."

Dexter,2o67yy,mrsnorthman,1 point,Wed Dec 3 18:50:19 2014 UTC,One good thing about the finale is that it did leave it open. I could definitely see someone picking it back up again.
Dexter,2o67yy,x_glo,6,Thu Dec 4 04:48:44 2014 UTC,"holy fuck, that was one of the best AMAs definitely. He (and Victoria typed out) answered a ton of questions."
Dexter,2o67yy,stash0606,3,Wed Dec 3 20:26:57 2014 UTC,Agreed. That is one of the best amas ive ever read! His answers were interesting. He even answered the fuck marry kill with good choices. :p
Dexter,2o67yy,shinosai,8,Thu Dec 4 00:14:12 2014 UTC,"The 100 Doakes sized ducks question was brilliant, so glad he answered it."
Dexter,2o67yy,alienfrog,2,Wed Dec 3 17:56:32 2014 UTC,Thanks for the link! I commented with a question but noticed he'd already answered it in another's question so I doubt I'll get a reply but hopefully he'll read my comment! :)
Dexter,2o7h7d,lol_vagina_lol,2,Thu Dec 4 00:06:30 2014 UTC,He could be 200 lbs.

Dexter,2o7h7d,Caps-Unlocked,1 point,Thu Dec 4 08:09:35 2014 UTC,Oh really? That's odd.
Dexter,2o7qti,claudiasaywhatt9,1 point,Thu Dec 4 01:29:16 2014 UTC,"I don't even think the wording is that odd. I think you can just be interpreted as ""does anyone know if they get their own separate location,"" or ""does everyone know each separate location?"""
Dexter,2o7qti,wato89,1 point,Tue Dec 23 21:17:59 2014 UTC,"Yes, he kills them in different locations. Didn't you watch the show?"
Dexter,2o7qti,Caps-Unlocked,1 point,Fri Dec 5 18:55:21 2014 UTC,Pretty sure that OP knows that. I believe he's just asking for the locations of each kill throughout the show.
Dexter,2o7qti,Mikjaash,1 point,Thu Dec 11 20:41:30 2014 UTC,The way he asks it seems kind of odd.
Dexter,2o7qti,Caps-Unlocked,1 point,Fri Dec 19 23:23:17 2014 UTC,That may be so. Gotta take into consideration that English is not everyone's primary language.
Dexter,2o4nwr,silentnsky,6,Wed Dec 3 05:47:39 2014 UTC,If only Dexter had become a carpenter.
Dexter,2o4nwr,njwatson32,7,Wed Dec 3 08:30:24 2014 UTC,"Well, he divorced one."
Dexter,2o4nwr,Captain_Higgins,2,Thu Dec 4 03:48:38 2014 UTC,"To answer the ps: I'm pretty sure it's meant to be seen as a great sacrifice for the best of his son (and hannah) since every grown up member of any family he has belonged to has died, all but one because of him (Rita, Harry, Debra, the mother, Rudy, the mother being the one who didn't die because of him, I'm sure I'm forgetting someone...) and he sees himself (rightly) as the problem. Wouldn't you say that's an honorable sacrifice?"
Dexter,2o4nwr,qwedswerty,1 point,Wed Dec 3 15:47:41 2014 UTC,"I don't think that makes it right. Obviously he loves his son and sees leaving him as a way to protect him. But if someone wanted to hurt Dexter or control him, kidnapping Harrison will still work. The proximity doesn't matter, because Dexter has a heart and still cares about him and Hannah."
Dexter,2o4nwr,duckwantbread,1 point,Wed Dec 3 15:57:31 2014 UTC,"Everyone thinks Dexter is dead, the only people who know Dexter is alive are ones from his lumberjack life, and they don't know he is called Dexter, or that he has a son."
Dexter,2o4nwr,qwedswerty,1 point,Wed Dec 3 16:13:49 2014 UTC,"All of the listed deaths have been helped by proximity, and only one was really for the purpose of getting back at him.  People that are close to him spends time with him, and that's the biggest danger.   Also, finding Dexter's son that he will pretend never existed won't be that easy. I can't think of anyone from Dexter's past who would want to hurt him right now anyway, but if Dexter was with his family he would have to avoid living in hiding like he does now. Things would be more dangerous for Harrison if we assume that Dexter keeps up his lifestyle.   His choice feels mostly emotional though, mainly because we're meant to believe that he will never kill again and has been freed from those urges. I assume that it's largely to show a sacrifice and accepting responsibility to the viewers."
Dexter,2o4nwr,b3d0u1n,1 point,Wed Dec 3 16:16:57 2014 UTC,"Our reality is limited by our perception.  Matter is not created or destroyed, it merely changes.  With that, our perception changes.  There's dimensions that we cannot perceive where what may seem illogical is the norm.  That's why I believe in an afterlife, not with any hopes that I'll encounter anyone I knew in the past."
Dexter,2o4nwr,DrDexterMorgan,2,Wed Dec 3 10:28:26 2014 UTC,"While matter cannot be created or destroyed, our consciousness is not matter in and of itself. It is created by matter, but I think it would be hard to assume that the result of matter being in a particular state remains the same when the state of that matter is altered. A light bulb produces light when electricity is applied. However, when that bulb is shattered or the electricity is removed, the light is gone. All the matter is still there, but it has been changed in such a way as to stop the result, in this case light. I'm not trying to be a downer, just my thoughts on it.   I agree with OP and I think it is hard for us to grasp and actually live with the fact that everything in life is really pointless. Like it or not, death is coming and regardless of what you have done in this life, you're going to the same place as everyone else. In the end, if the ""end"" can exist in this universe, nothing ultimately matters. I just hope if there is an afterlife, I get to be a lumberjack."
Dexter,2o4nwr,Ledwick,1 point,Wed Dec 3 15:51:48 2014 UTC,"I agree here. If there is anything that can be considered an afterlife, it won't be just hanging around the handful of individuals you met in your short lifespan, it will be something wholly new and incomprehensible."
Dexter,2o4nwr,hels,1 point,Wed Dec 3 12:25:46 2014 UTC,"You know, we're just space dust.  Our brains are space dust and look what that has created.    I am agnostic as I have no fucking clue what happens after death.  I can't understand life so how can I have a belief afterwards when there is zero proof?    Science is awesome and I believe the scientific history.  It's just we can't explain consciousness or even life.  So how can we be sure about death?"
Dexter,2o3gnf,PresidentPlate,28,Tue Dec 2 23:17:38 2014 UTC,Why would Hannah go through all the risk of poisoning a child when she could just leave him alone in a room with a treadmill for half an hour.
Dexter,2o3gnf,future-madscientist,5,Wed Dec 3 05:58:58 2014 UTC,30 whole minutes? Someone's being generous...
Dexter,2o3gnf,maximumreign,9,Wed Dec 3 06:00:39 2014 UTC,"i myself have just this minute finished the series, an i cant say i thought that, fucking fuck I am now  Also why did they have to fucking kill off Deb, I mean what the fuck, I get too mother fucking attached to fucking characters.  And another thing, was the ending left open for a reason, i thought we were getting closure when the wreckage was found"

Dexter,2o3gnf,Mutasyn,5,Wed Dec 10 01:06:23 2014 UTC,"You shut your damn mouth, Harrison is too fucking innocent to be killed off by Hannah. I'll admit I wouldn't put it past her to erase every part of Dexter from her life with the assumption that he's dead (maybe he'd contact her eventually? Though from the looks of the ending, I'd say not), but for her to stoop to killing a child? I'd like to believe she's a bit more human than that. She's known to only kill people who get in her way, and Harrison is simply just going to be a challenge in her life once he starts asking questions about Dexter's whereabouts."
Dexter,2o3gnf,joetheschmoe4000,3,Wed Dec 3 05:48:47 2014 UTC,"Really? I thought ""Ice cream"" was a reference to Wayne Randall. In his last few days before killing himself, all he really wanted was some ice cream to bring him back to the ""good old days."""
Dexter,2o3gnf,Pab94,5,Wed Dec 3 23:56:33 2014 UTC,no
Dexter,2o3gnf,LoneRavers,2,Tue Dec 2 23:40:09 2014 UTC,"May I ask why not? I'd love to think that Harrison survived the series, but Hannah has a habit of killing when things go wrong."
Dexter,2o3gnf,TheHellFish,2,Wed Dec 3 01:07:47 2014 UTC,"No she's got what she wants, south america, freedom. She usually kills when she has something to gain, it's just a kid i doubt it would be much of an obstacle she would have to get rid off so badly.  Plus like the guy above said, subtelty isn't this last season's strong suit."
Dexter,2o3gnf,mostlyidontcare,2,Wed Dec 3 22:25:16 2014 UTC,"I thought about that few times as well and I don't think they really wanted to imply that, since the final season had exactly zero subtlety, but it could very well be true, given what we know about Hannah."
Dexter,2o3gnf,Subulie3,2,Wed Dec 3 05:11:52 2014 UTC,"Mhm, I actually never thought about that and never saw anybody else mention it here, but that's a really  good thought."
Dexter,2o3gnf,eatmyshortsken,1 point,Wed Dec 3 05:32:46 2014 UTC,"Good theory, never thought about that myself. My thinking was that she would care for Harrison as a mother would because Harrison is all that is left of Dexter. Who knows that, interesting stuff."
Dexter,2o3gnf,RobertPaulsen39,-2,Wed Dec 3 06:58:06 2014 UTC,Who cares? Dexter slowly devolved into a laughable shell of its former self.

Dexter,2o0ice,der1x,7,Tue Dec 2 06:27:51 2014 UTC,"Honestly if we're going to speculate about that I'm guessing he had some part in it. The general idea seems to fit nicely with his views on Dexter.   Having said that, let's pray for there being none of those boring questions!"
Dexter,2o0ice,qwedswerty,18,Tue Dec 2 09:35:41 2014 UTC,He probably had something to do with it. He was a producer for the later seasons.
Dexter,2o0ice,Slaytounge,3,Tue Dec 2 07:10:39 2014 UTC,In an interview he said they completely rewrote the intern louis story arc because he didnt like the idea of 2 serial killers in miami metro.   MCH had enough control on the plot to take blame.

Loved amazing theme, that creepy drawn-out sound, the happy Latino music, how well it all came together and was added at all the right places. Just genius! My favorite sound track to a show by far."
Dexter,2o1p4i,qwedswerty,3,Tue Dec 2 21:29:31 2014 UTC,The original music on Dexter is probably my favorite of any show.
Dexter,2o1p4i,rhcp88,2,Tue Dec 2 19:00:57 2014 UTC,The West Wing    Really nice suite by the show's composer.
Dexter,2o1p4i,REMAIN_IN_LIGHT,1 point,Tue Dec 2 18:45:17 2014 UTC,Pretty ironic for the guy who composed Dexter's soundtrack to be called Snuffy though haha.
Dexter,2o1p4i,etrius0023,2,Tue Dec 2 18:50:49 2014 UTC,Dexter really did have great music.  Although it's very different I'd recommend trying Hannibal (the TV show) it has some very nice (and in some cases while coupled with the imagery; disturbing) compositions.  One of my favorites is Bloodfest [The Last Supper].

Dexter,2nu826,ratbastid,31,Sun Nov 30 12:07:34 2014 UTC,"I think one of the worst things about Season 8 is that the Vogel storyline had so much promise. It potentially recast everything about Dexter's backstory.   Now, to really do it right, you needed to be hinting at her from the start. Some half-remembered female figure, we might have presumed all along that was Ms. Morgan, or Dexter's mother. Then the big reveal to wind up the final season, that it was Vogel, the psycho-mother-figure Dexter never new he had.  That could have been hot. Instead we get a one-episode micro-reveal that changes all the relationships in the show, and every single main character sort of shrugs and goes along with it. Including the big bad. Cheap, lazy, thoughtless, and tacked-on, like most everything else in S8."
Dexter,2nu826,ratbastid,3,Sun Nov 30 18:05:28 2014 UTC,"Definitely would have been much better if it was hinted at early on. I don't get why S8 went so bad, what the hell happened? It's not like ratings were tanking and there wasn't a reason to give a shit. I just don't get it.  The more I think about it the more I like the unofficial alternate ending out there for S7, where Deb kills Dexter instead of Maria. I'm not mad Dexter didn't die, but it would have prevented the horror that is S8."
Dexter,2nu826,Breaking_Dexter25,5,Tue Dec 2 22:58:38 2014 UTC,"I don't know in terms of reasons, but I think it's clear that somewhere along the way the writers just decided their audience was too stupid for them to have to work very hard. Nobody could be proud of what season 8 turned out to be. They had to know it wasn't their best work. They either had serious short-timers' syndrome, or they just figured fuck the audience, they're too dumb to work at it so why should we?  At least that's how I felt about it. I was actually insulted by the last few episodes."
Dexter,2nu826,_Charlie_Sheen_,21,Tue Dec 2 23:45:20 2014 UTC,"The addition of Vogel is one of the worst parts of that season in my opinion. For 7 seasons, it was dexter and harry who shared this bond of the code, and a father looking out for his son, but then all of a sudden, Vogel comes out of nowhere saying I knew everything the entire time. That was when I really checked out of the season. It really put me off that the premise that is so essential to the series was just changed in the last season. Something about that really didn't sit right with me."
Dexter,2nu826,crackalac,8,Sun Nov 30 16:29:36 2014 UTC,"Instead of Vogel they should have had  Mathews confess that he knew all along and helped Harry, would have made the season way better  Edit: forgot the word Mathews"
Dexter,2nu826,NJS212,7,Sun Nov 30 21:57:58 2014 UTC,Who. Matthews?
Dexter,2nu826,A_Bitter_Man,4,Mon Dec 1 01:53:20 2014 UTC,I actually agree with this. Mathews being substituted for Vogel would have at least made us care about the character more. One of my biggest pet peeves with Season 8 was all the new characters introduced. This would have helped in that area.

Dexter,2nu826,kingkoons,1 point,Tue Dec 2 23:02:26 2014 UTC,"Definitely should have ended at S7. Some have suggested Deb killing Dexter instead of Maria would have been better. Perhaps so, but still, just ending it how it did with an uncertain future, Deb and Dexter hand in hand killers, fan speculation of a new Bonnie and Clyde, would have been not so bad. Plus the potential for a follow-up series, if it was done right.  In another thread we discussed whether or not S8 was a big ""fuck you"" by the writers, either to Showtime due to unknown problems the two had with each other, or to the fans who complained about S5-7 (which would really suck to me since I liked all of S1-7)."
Dexter,2nu826,duckwantbread,16,Wed Dec 3 00:00:53 2014 UTC,"Nah, I agree. Seemed perfectly in character. Hell, I don't even agree that season 8 sucked. I don't rabidly hate the finale either, although the first time I watched it I accidentally stopped early, with everyone thinking he died on the boat. This subreddit is the only reason I realized I missed something.  THANKS, GUYS."
Dexter,2nvtt6,thekalby,7,Sun Nov 30 22:59:47 2014 UTC,"I agree. I thought it made complete sense for Harry to have a confidant in this. Hannah is where the series turned for me. I didn't like the guy tracking Hannah, I felt like both characters took screen time away from characters that had been there longer. I really wanted Batista and Quinn to figure everything out. Hunt him down and I could see Dexter convincing Deb to act like she knew absolutely nothing and for her raise Harrison. He would be put to death."
Dexter,2nvtt6,badwolf7850,3,Mon Dec 1 01:19:35 2014 UTC,"I agree. I liked Hannah back when she was the actual focus of season 7, but when she just barged into season 8, poisoned Deb and Dex for the stupidist reason possible, and then railroaded the entire second half of the final season just to recreate the love story that Dexter had already been through, It just felt forced, and rather stupid. Season 8 started out looking like it was going to be all about re-examining Dexters past, and look at how he's changed since the beginning of the series, which would have been great, but instead, they just brought in a new love interest."
Dexter,2nvtt6,scarlet_overlord,1 point,Sat Dec 6 22:41:32 2014 UTC,"And a whole storyline about her with a new character specifically for her. Too much time when her storyline had ended and felt pretty natural. And, I'm sorry, but why couldn't she dye her hair?"

It is not that i would say, a killer should die in the end, nor am i for a happy  ending for the protagonist in a tv-show."
Dexter,2nvtt6,panix199,3,Tue Dec 2 02:09:08 2014 UTC,The first episode of season 8 got me excited. Vogel seemed interested then. But I was disappointed with every episode that followed.

Dexter,2nqi4c,dFluxx,6,Sat Nov 29 15:01:49 2014 UTC,"Especially since her character had such potential to become Dexter's protege, or even just as someone who knows Dexter's secret and can help him deal with it.

Dexter,2nqi4c,noahboa9,1 point,Thu Dec 4 03:35:54 2014 UTC,actually enjoyed this. up until that episode i hated S5. It showed Dex's true colors. he is only half a psychopath. he feels emotional pain and doesn't at the same time. he also totally understands his darkness for a brief moment. the deepest episode for dexter personally
Dexter,2nqi4c,kingkoons,11,Tue Dec 9 04:38:38 2014 UTC,"It wasn't quite as good anymore after season 4 but I didn't find it horrendous until the last season. They just gave up. Everything about it was bad. Heavy exposition in the dialogue, unenthusiastic delivery of lines, stupid actions by the characters, the treadmill scene, etc, etc"
Dexter,2nqi4c,hivoltage815,15,Sat Nov 29 12:51:59 2014 UTC,"IMHO, Season 5 is way better than people give it credit for. Season 6 is where it went downhill for me, with some good moments in Season 7. Edward James Olmos was criminally underutilized in S6."

Dexter,2nqi4c,k0fi96,7,Sat Nov 29 09:34:20 2014 UTC,"I thought the show could have ended perfectly at the end of Season 5. The poignant shot of Dexter holding Harrison at the end of the picnic table, with the birthday cake, realizing how incredibly alone he is, and always be, while all the people around him are all happy together with the people they love.  That, to me, is the end of the series. S6 through S8 are a tacked-on epilogue."
Dexter,2nqi4c,swisspassport,11,Sat Nov 29 13:31:32 2014 UTC,"Watch it. I thought the whole series was great, to be honest. Take what people say with a grain of salt"
Dexter,2nqi4c,ariesbabe,6,Sat Nov 29 07:27:25 2014 UTC,"I agree. I also think some of the earlier seasons were spoiled by things that people complain about in the later seasons. Lila was probably one of the worst characters in the entire series. I seriously hated her and when I rewatched the series I skipped that part. I do think the series finale was rushed and poorly done though. That should have been at least two episodes, maybe more."
Dexter,2nqi4c,DrDexterMorgan,3,Sat Nov 29 16:47:49 2014 UTC,"I'd say probably at season six. 5 was nowhere near as good as the four before it, but it wasn't crazy over the top like six."

Dexter,2nqi4c,memo_rx,2,Sat Nov 29 11:28:32 2014 UTC,Dexter is not supposed to have emotions. That is the problem.
Dexter,2nqi4c,duckwantbread,5,Sat Nov 29 18:20:43 2014 UTC,"Even in the first season Dexter is capible of limited emotion, he chose Deb even though his brother would have been the more logical choice. He also struggles over killing Doakes, you could argue that was due to Harry's code but a true psychopath would easily dismiss the code when logically killing Doakes would help Dexter out. He also becomes attached in a similar way to Lumen (minus the sex) to Miguel in the third season."

Dexter,2nmuku,BroomPerson21,5,Mon Dec 1 02:11:19 2014 UTC,"Well, like I always say, the ideas presented in the finale weren't all that bad, but their execution was a bit poor. And the final season as a whole didn't make any sense.  As far as the finale is concerned:   Dexter loosing his need to kill was a good idea, but the reasoning was really weak. If it should have been because of somebody, it should have been because of Deb and/or his son, not because of Hannah (who didn't make any sense in the final season anyway). Deb's death was handled really poorly. They could have (and should have) given her a death more worthy of her character, not making her a random collateral of a subpar big bad. And the fact that she died in the last minutes of the show was really disappointing, her death should have been used to drive the story forward, tear the characters open and show us their reaction and subsequent chaos. They robbed us of that. Also, the sea burial was overflowing with interesting symbolism, but the general consensus is that a proper burial would be better. Leaving Harrison with Hannah? Come on. They are right that Hannah is a different kind of killer, but she doesn't kill for self protection, but for personal gain. And she enjoys it. Remember the giraffe reminding her of her first kill? Remember her killing Beverly for money? Remember her killing her husband just so that she won't loose anything during the divorce? It's sad to think about this but that ice cream she decided to get him could very well be poisoned. And Dexter not being revealed was a cop out."
Dexter,2nmuku,TheHellFish,2,Fri Nov 28 09:43:56 2014 UTC,"The final season was a mess as a whole, it felt like two or three seasons worth of ideas, squeezed into one. Also, the previews to the last season is the most misleading bullshit in television history."

I remember that I was wondering whether there was any connection, but I dismissed it as probably unrelated.   If anything, it might have had a subconscious effect (I mean that he just connected 'remote area' with 'mountains' more easily based on the last conversations he had then for example 'deserted island' or 'great plains'), but it definitely wasn't a conscious decision (As in: 'I lost the only person I've ever truly loved, so I'll exclude myself from society to grieve and blame myself in solitude. Where will I go? She said something about hiking in Argentina... Oregon it is, then.')"

If a serial killer is murdered alone in the woods, does he make any sound? Splash a bright, blood red ""Dexter"" over the black screen. It runs like spilt blood and faded into credits.   omg. you should be a writer.  I think it made sense that he went into exile with no human interaction."
Dexter,2nmuku,ChronaMewX,2,Fri Nov 28 04:31:14 2014 UTC,"I just thought it was super lame that he survived and went in hiding as a lumberjack. Just have the balls to let the main character die, its not against the laws of physics."
Dexter,2nmfpw,Natezami,1 point,Fri Nov 28 00:17:37 2014 UTC,Merch?  I think this quote/quotes are a perfect representation of Dex and Deb's relationship once Deb learns of Dexter's true nature. Facial expressions to fit as well.  Art by me!
Dexter,2ngm61,Subulie3,26,Wed Nov 26 08:09:56 2014 UTC,"Tough question.  'Long' answer: I'd be thrilled to see the show end like this.  'Shorter' answer: There are many possibilities, but in my mind they all have some basic points in common.   The show would be focused on the already established characters and especially on Dexter and Deb (I'm a 'debster' shipper, but I don't view it as a necessity - it could go either way, but the focus on the core relationship of the series just has to remain there). No need to introduce half a dozen new characters which roles could be fulfilled by the side characters already there. Hannah would either return as a villain, or she would be revealed as one eventually. If i hear anyone say 'Argentina' ever again I'll snap. Dexter would be found out. Preferably not red-handed in a stroke of luck (again), but after a prolonged investigation. No sloppiness without proper reason. Dexter losing his need to kill (this one is optional), but under different circumstances and with some reasoning that makes sense."
Dexter,2ngm61,TheHellFish,10,Wed Nov 26 09:41:39 2014 UTC,"Piggy backing because I like the idea of his need to kill escalating and him taking bigger risks. Meanwhile an investigation starts after someone finds puts the pieces together and realizes someone is killing former prisoners and killers. The pressure builds, Dexter gets sloppy ad the pieces fall into place for whomever is investigating (Angel maybe?). We would have a few episodes of him on the run, maybe going to Deb for help(she may or may not already know about his dark passenger and need to kill).  It would have to end with Dexter's death though, either by the hands of the police, or even his own. Maybe he envisions it's Harry holding the knife instead of himself to finally release him from his dark passenger and to kill one final person."
Dexter,2ngm61,sumguythere,3,Wed Nov 26 14:00:34 2014 UTC,A good way of dexter being found out could be them looking back at the trinity killings. The reason I say this is because Angel looks directly at Dexter and Trinity talking but nothing ever comes off it. The case could be reopened as someone is copy cat killing like trinity and they look through old case files and Angel recognises Dexter and him talking and maybe starts an investigation.
Dexter,2ngm61,iFoxMSF,5,Wed Dec 3 16:17:03 2014 UTC,Argentina
Dexter,2ngm61,superzepto,4,Wed Nov 26 21:54:34 2014 UTC,Fuck off and die... then die again. :)
Dexter,2ngm61,TheHellFish,19,Wed Nov 26 22:19:15 2014 UTC,"well for the last season i was hoping that the MPD would focus on laguertas death, and that angel wouldnt let it go. Was hoping he would get on dexters trail, a little bit like doakes did but less obsessive. have the final season be a angel v dexter showdown."
Dexter,2ngm61,rageking5,16,Wed Nov 26 13:32:08 2014 UTC,I still like the scenario that Deb shoots him instead of LaGuerta
Dexter,2ngm61,Kembawalker1,5,Wed Nov 26 14:50:34 2014 UTC,"I would have preferred this too. Season 7 was actually pretty good, good enough to make me forgive Season 6, so I would have been fine with it ending there. But nothing will let me forgive Season 8."
Dexter,2ngm61,abhpro,14,Wed Nov 26 22:58:20 2014 UTC,"Certainly everyone should have found out about him. Other than that, I don't care. Maybe Dexter should have mowed down a room full of Nazis with a robot machine gun instead of becoming a lumberjack."
Dexter,2ngm61,Anzat,12,Wed Nov 26 15:28:07 2014 UTC,"I still would've liked Deb to die, just not the fucking ocean drop thing, and Miami metro finding out who Dexter really was but assume he died in that storm, they don't tell the press because that would be the biggest fail in history to work along the biggest serial killer ever. Also Dexter to Argentina, no urge to kill --> live happily ever after"
Dexter,2ngm61,Farm_the_karm,5,Wed Nov 26 15:31:06 2014 UTC,Yes!!! I wanted the happy ending for him. :(
Dexter,2ngm61,Pinkilicious,8,Wed Nov 26 20:51:09 2014 UTC,"I'm a big fan of the series ending with Dex in the execution chamber. The entire show could have been being told to a jury even, but the last moments should have been either happily ever after or Dex getting executed."

Dexter,2ngm61,perfectdrug659,12,Wed Nov 26 16:39:10 2014 UTC,"I would've liked to see Deb try to turn Dexter in, but that backfiring because he never admits guilt, and even though everyone starts to think Debra is right, they can't actually find any solid proof to back that up, so he gets off. During this, Hannah tries but fails (again) to kill Deb. Debra, being angry at the justice system for failing her, sets up a kill room and kills her Dexter style. This pisses Dexter off, bit he gets over it.   All in all, I feel like where the show really screwed up was with forgotten storylines, things would start but never really finish. Hannah is one of them that bother me the most, Dexter just forgives her for shit like trying to kill his sister. Seems pretty out of character."
Dexter,2ngm61,ristoman,5,Wed Nov 26 08:40:27 2014 UTC,"I agree. I can understand why he wants to spend the rest of his life with her because he can be himself around her but, at the start of the series Dexter says ""If I could have feelings for anyone I'd have them for Deb"" and Hannah attempting to kill Deb should have put Dexter off Hannah for good."
Dexter,2ngm61,kobayashimaru13,3,Wed Nov 26 09:25:30 2014 UTC,"I would have toyed with the foundations that kept him (and the series) going and made him feel like he was doing 'justice'; Vogel would have been a great catalyst for him to find out that a lot of the things he was taught were BS or at least not as important as the series made them out to be.   There were a lot of moments where the plot could have pushed situations further, then decided not to by falling back into trope territory. His key decisions felt more like 'welp, guess I'm doing this now' instead of real internal struggles.  Another interesting angle would have been for Dexter to find out he's not alone in his endeavors, he's just a 'stereotype' perpetuating itself. A lot of his self-righteousness would have flown right out of the door.  Cheesy but also interesting would have been for Dexter to go on an identity crisis and decide to turn himself in thinking that life in an isolation cell is the only solution for him to stop killing, then somehow get scott-free on a technicality he has no control over and be resented by everyone for the rest of his life as a mass murderer that cheated the system (especially given that he works for MPD) and walked free. It would have been an awesome contrast to his vigilante attitude."
Dexter,2ngm61,ampmz,3,Wed Nov 26 19:11:05 2014 UTC,"I honestly would have been fine the way it was if, when it did the close up of him being all lumber-jacky, there was a voice over that said ""Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again and again."""
Dexter,2ngm61,satandollars,3,Thu Nov 27 00:58:18 2014 UTC,"I'd like to have seen Dexter get caught red handed by the Police. The last season would show Dexter in Prison trying to deal with life in a Max pen and the surrounding media coverage and court case. The should he be executed or should be live debate would be interesting, the finale with Dexter sitting in the electric chair."
Dexter,2ngm61,kimmykinsssss,3,Wed Nov 26 20:00:56 2014 UTC,"I like everything up til season 8, and even parts of season 8.  But I really enjoyed the popular alternate ending with Ray Romano was floating around for a while.  But Dex should have been found out by everyone. They missed like some of the most potentially dramatic plotlines on TV by just ignoring that.  God damnit, fuck those writers"
Dexter,2ngm61,StuntinDunton,6,Thu Nov 27 01:24:17 2014 UTC,"I would have liked it if Dexter set up a proper kill room for Saxon and gotten caught. Harrison and Hannah left to Argentina and Hannah finds out over the news. And Dexter forces Debra somehow to pretend she knew nothing so she could live on her life. I dont know though, Would've loved to see all the mixed emotions at Miami Metro"
Dexter,2ngm61,cheddar742,2,Wed Nov 26 08:13:12 2014 UTC,There's an anonymous tip that Dexter has been murdering people for years. He's on the run. He's the most wanted man in America.  There's a shot of him getting sentenced before a judge and going to prison.   But wait. It's just a dream...  Dexter awakens and he's tied to a gurney in some abandoned warehouse covered in plastic. He looks around. Someone who has the same agenda as him (killing other serial killers) heard of Dexter and he found dexter and drugged him and now he's going to kill him in the same manner as Dexter has killed his victims. Dexter dies.  And the anonymous tip was from Deb who was racked with guilt
Dexter,2ngm61,gz33,2,Sun Nov 30 09:51:20 2014 UTC,"After season 4 i would like to have seen a different route. I always assumed dexter had schizophrenia(seeing hallucinations of Harry and such), and schizophrenia can get worse as you get older. I kinda wish dexters mental state would have just gotten worse over the seasons until he went completely insane. Possibly began killing innocent people and having crazy hallucinations to the point where he had to be put down."
Dexter,2ngm61,JMM123,2,Wed Nov 26 09:13:35 2014 UTC,"I think the show just made Harry a physical entity to display Dexter's conscience, he was aware that his dead dad wasn't actually with him all the time."
Dexter,2ngm61,yeew21,1 point,Wed Nov 26 18:54:07 2014 UTC,"I honestly liked the last season, up until he faked his death just to be a lumberjack. It didn't make sense, since the whole reason he was harming people around him was his urge to kill. With nothing to protect his loved ones from, he was free to start again in Argentina. Unless of course they wanted to show that Deb's death triggered his urges returning, in which case the end scene would be the same except show him pulling out a needle or something. Or have him not fake his death, and actually die in the storm."

To kill a guy.  Harry Morgan: Not so great Dex. When you take a man's life you're not just killing him, you're snuffing out all the things he'll ever become.

Dexter,2ngm61,humphrey288,1 point,Sun Nov 30 07:30:43 2014 UTC,"Keep first four seasons the way they are.  Season 5 - Move Louis subplot to this season. Have Deb pull down the curtain at the end of the season and discover the truth about Dexter.  Season 6 - Eliminated completely. With the Dexter reveal in 5, this season isn't necessary.  Season 7 - Eliminate Hannah. Keep the Isaak Sirko storyline generally, but have him getting the drop on Dexter, with Dexter only being saved by Louis. Louis knows Dexter's secret, and it turns out he's the illegitimate child of Brian Moser (I've always thought there was a resemblance), and Dexter's nephew. Dexter kills him in the season finale when he threatens to reveal things, but as a final trick Louis orchestrated having LaGuerta and Deb walk in on the act. Dexter kills LaGuerta, pushes Deb to the floor, and runs away.  Season 8 - Miami Metro deals with the fallout of LaGuerta's death and the revelation about Dexter. He's on the run, and the most wanted man in America at this point. He runs to Minnesota, and hides with Lumen (screw Hannah), the one person alive who's been able to accept who he really is. Turns out Lumen has managed to move on through therapy, and is threatened by this new Dexter (it doesn't help that she's heard all about his extensive history on the news). She plays along, but secretly informs the cops. After some ensuing dramatic chasing, Dexter is caught alive. Then the show cuts to black, and the final scene occurs as Clyde Phillips described it:   In the very last scene of the series, Dexter wakes up. And everybody is going to think, 'Oh, it was a dream.' And then the camera pulls back and back and back and then we realize, 'No, it's not a dream.' Dexter's opening his eyes and he's on the execution table at the Florida Penitentiary. They're just starting to administer the drugs and he looks out through the window to the observation gallery. ""And in the gallery are all the people that Dexter killed—including the Trinity Killer and the Ice Truck Killer (his brother Rudy), LaGuerta who he was responsible killing, Doakes who he's arguably responsible for, Rita, who he's arguably responsible for, Lila. All the big deaths, and also whoever the weekly episodic kills were. They are all there. That's what I envisioned for the ending of Dexter. That everything we've seen over the past eight seasons has happened in the several seconds from the time they start Dexter's execution to the time they finish the execution and he dies. Literally, his life flashed before his eyes as he was about to die. I think it would have been a great, epic, very satisfying conclusion."

I've heard/read that many decisions were made while writing each episode before each season, though by Gilligan himself.    I think what really sets the two shows apart is that every detail of BB ended up being meaningful, many very significant. DEXTER didn't hold true to that.    What's funny is the show about The Code veered away from itself, and the show about spiralling into madness held to its own principles.    I still like DEXTER more though, mostly because of the premise and the original cast. I just don't kid myself into think it's ultimately ""better"" than BB."

Moser is dead, but appears as if he is actually there. This is like Travis and Gellar, everything that Gellar does, Travis actually does. As for getting to that atheist professor first, I'm guessing that it was just lucky timing."
Dexter,2nbhdy,nuggetinabuiscuit,2,Wed Nov 26 15:18:38 2014 UTC,Fair point. The fork stab scene? So Dexter never actually seen Gellar then?

Going back to when Gellar hit Travis with a spade, either Travis hit himself, or that just flat out never happened.

They both have taken a life because they felt it would provide balance to the world (except Dexter takes it waaaaaaaaay farther) and they both wind up acting towards what they want in any given situation, one way or another.  Doakes is the anti-Dexter, another dark soul kept in check by a ""code"".  As stated a couple times before, Dexter is just so much worse on such a larger scale."

I knew that if I didnt get bombed and watch it I would just be angry about it so I got sloshed and had a semi-satisfying (emotionally anyway) final episode of what used to be one of my favorite shows...then I woke up to the truth the next day.

Dexter,2mpq2x,SteampunkPirate,8,Wed Nov 19 13:21:54 2014 UTC,I still can't believe how badly they messed up Season 8. After Season 7 I really felt as if the series was going back in the right direction.
Dexter,2mpq2x,Pbever,7,Wed Nov 19 01:33:03 2014 UTC,It seems to me like they KNEW how much they screwed it up. They advertised a completely different season to get people hyped

Dexter,2mpq2x,dasher11,5,Wed Nov 19 19:17:56 2014 UTC,"How possible would it be to bring back all the actors and film a alternate season 8? One where Batista doesn't just get over LaGuerta's death, and actually looks into it. He could find Dex and Deb's phone records and they have to go on the run.  Eventually Dexter gets Jamie killed which makes it worse for Batista. In the end Dexter gets caught, or executed, i don't know. I'm not a writer.  But i think it would be a really interesting idea. can you imagine the hype?"
Dexter,2mpq2x,hockeystew,3,Wed Nov 19 16:38:01 2014 UTC,I do wish he had been caught or at least been discovered. I think it would've been fantastic to see the world's reaction after finding out such a prolific serial killer existed. And also how he was received after it was made clear who he killed and why
Dexter,2mpq2x,WassDogg304,2,Wed Nov 19 05:32:48 2014 UTC,"Oh wow, I hadn't actually seen that before.

Dexter,2mpq2x,Subulie3,2,Wed Nov 19 03:33:27 2014 UTC,"Wow. That's actually a really good promo.

Dexter,2mq75u,BaconAllDay2,11,Wed Nov 19 01:47:25 2014 UTC,"I presume he did his usual investigation work off-camera, before the series proper started."
Dexter,2mq75u,ArchStanton27,9,Wed Nov 19 07:20:37 2014 UTC,"I figured the writers wanted to show Dexter as practically prefect in the Pilot. They wanted to start right off with a kill. Starting off the series with ""Tonight's the Night, but let me do some more research"" isn't as spine chilling."
Dexter,2mq75u,astupidwhitekid,3,Thu Nov 20 06:25:40 2014 UTC,"Well the way I would do it...  Perhaps he noticed a string of children going missing, possibly in close neighbourhoods.   But Dexter is smart, so he likely did some quick investigating of the families. I'm sure the articles that spoke about missing children listed the names of the families, especially if they were proactive about finding their kids.   A quick Google search would go on to reveal they were actively involved with a church, or maybe the original article itself would speak about the support of their community church, which they were actively involved in. I say actively involved, because in order for the kids to be in regular close proximity with the priest, they would likely be more than your Weekend Warrior and Chreaster(Christmas/Easter) attenders(which is something Dexter would go on to realize in retrospect, but not notice at the moment). They would likely be a little more involved in church activities, and, lo-and-behold, probably mentioned on sections of the Church's website, like when they helped with the Annual Barbecue, and the Christmas fundraiser and bake sale.  Through further investigations of the church, Ol' Darkly Dreaming Dexter would begin to notice other families who attend this church who've had missing children in the last few years. He'd see a thread, and following the thread might lead him to actually checking out the Church one fine Sunday morning. He might watch the families, and see who they talked and interacted with, because Dexter knows most child abductions are not actually a result of Stranger Danger, but most often by someone closer to the victims like friends and family.  Or maybe Dexter didn't even need to take this last step, because he likely had a little encouragement from his Dark Passenger the second he set his eyes on the Man giving the sermon. I'm sure Dexter took one look at him, and his Dark Angel flexed his own wings, whispering down the back of Dexter's neck. Once his Passenger snarled, the priest likely became Dexter's focus, especially after he noticed the alter boys are all in the same 10-12 age group as the missing ones, and how the Priest interacted with them.  Dexter would keep eyes on the priest, or likely go the quick route and break right into his private room behind the church stage. Maybe there were no photos lying around in the desk drawer, but the Laptop and thumb-drive would likely be another story. However he gathered the evidence, evidence was there to gather.  Pick up where we left off, and PILOT."

Dexter,2mmzud,john_toker,16,Tue Nov 18 05:26:01 2014 UTC,"I assume most people will say after Season 4 since it was easily the best season, but I personally think it wasn't until 8. 5-7 were some of the weaker seasons, but I didn't find them 'bad'. The problem was season 8, it had so much potential. I thought the first episode was really well done and could have set up a lot of stuff. They had the perfect opportunity for a man-hunt on Dexter that simply never happened.   There was a scene where Batista had a box and he was going to look into Laguerta's death. I think that's the main focus the season should have taken, having the entire Miami Police Department after him as opposed to Season 2 when it was only Doakes. They could have had Batista become suspicious and then slowly have him investigate with other officers. But they kind of just brushed it off and never had him investigate again. Adding the kid and Masuka's daughter was a complete waste of time. The kid would have simply been killed by Dexter if it wasn't for the therapist, and the daughter basically had no correlation to the story. It seemed they wanted to give Masuka more character background, which is fine, but it should have come far earlier in the show. The whole season just seemed to be a complete mess. The infamous treadmill scene, the scene with Dexter in the window being 'sneaky', just a mess in every sense possible. It's almost as if they weren't ready to write the show.  I personally think the show should have ended with Dexter being locked up. Him escaping and becoming a lumberjack is laughable, and him getting killed is too cliche. Dexter ruined the lives of the people he was close to, killed hundreds of people, and simply got away with far too much. It's almost absurd and insulting that he was never hunted down. I guess you could argue that he is a prisoner of his own mind now as a lumberjack, but a literal prison would be better.  The thing about seasons 5-7 were that they were weaker seasons compared to the brilliant 1-4. Though some people weren't fans of 3, I really liked Miguel's character. Very well written and casted. Seasons 5-7 weren't the best seasons, but it still felt like a Dexter show. Season 8 didn't even feel like Dexter, the darkness of the show was almost non-existent. There weren't any amazing Dexter monologues, any cool kills, it was just utter non-sense."
Dexter,2mmzud,destiny24,7,Tue Nov 18 08:13:47 2014 UTC,"I started seeing traces of the decline in Season 5. I still enjoyed it as a whole, but I didn't like how they brushed off Rita's death so easily. IIRC the show has always had this tendency to move on from stories just like that, but Rita dying was such a major event. There should've been a bigger amount of focus put on its aftermath and how it affected the characters, especially Dexter.  Season 6 was where I felt it really got off track, though. Travis Marshall was not a compelling villan at all (to me at least) and I just felt like nothing really happened in that season. They could've cut S6 and have Deb walked in on Dexter and Lumen killing Jordan chase instead, and it wouldn't have made a big difference plot-wise.  From there, the show wasn't able to recover. The Isaak Sirko and Laguerta plots of Season 7 were strong, but Hannah dragged it down. And then, 8 happened, which was just a huge clusterfuck of a season, leading up to such a disappointing finale."
Dexter,2mmzud,molly-ringworm,1 point,Tue Nov 18 12:19:05 2014 UTC,"That was my first thought too, the episode that dealt with Rita's funeral was probably the last good episode but even then I still wasn't fully satisfied with that one. It definitely declined afterwards, had a random good episode here and there. I'm so mixed with my feelings for this show only because I fell  in love with the first 4 seasons"
Dexter,2mmzud,PoisoningPerception,4,Tue Dec 23 11:57:25 2014 UTC,"I truly think it was the season 5 finale. Season 5 catches a lot of slack, but I thought it was perfect for what it needed to be--the show mourning Rita.   The problem was, they laid down tons of groundwork for Deb to catch Dexter at the end, and then they bailed him out  with that plastic curtain (which stinks of Showtime telling them not to do it yet b/c it was always end game material).  That gave us season 6 which spent little time doing anything productive until the last 4 seconds, which should've been the end of season 5 not 6.  So in my dream time line. Deb catches Dex at the end of season 5 and season 6 becomes more or less what we saw in season 7, but ends the series with 6 tight seasons, rather than padding it out with MORE serial killers and loose plots (like Masuka and his daughter)"
Dexter,2mmzud,welshwordman,5,Tue Nov 18 19:36:21 2014 UTC,"I loved Colin Hanks as Travis Marshall, and I enjoyed that season as a whole. But I agree with the above comment that post Season 4, post Rita's death, the show was not as strong. Season 8 was garbage though, for sure. They should have done a complete public exposure of Dexter and made him a 'Hannibal Lectare' type, renowned villain."
Dexter,2mmzud,816am,8,Tue Nov 18 09:57:17 2014 UTC,After Rita died it seemed to be the climax of the series. Slowly going down hill from there.
Dexter,2mmzud,bhaconwaffles,1 point,Tue Nov 18 06:44:38 2014 UTC,When Dexter turned his boat around in the season 5 premiere and came back to Miami. Season 5 or 6 should have been the last season and it should have involved Dexters secret getting out and him being on the run.
Dexter,2mlkgr,Werfel,6,Mon Nov 17 21:33:30 2014 UTC,"I had forgotten how much I enjoy the Dexter-Doakes dynamic. The constant jabs back and forth, and the sub-plot it creates really give a lot to the series.   When Deb is helping Dexter pick a tie for court, she says ""this one brings out your eyes."" I felt that she had more affection for him than a sister should.   Dexter's internal monologues are much deeper than I remember then being in the beginning"
Dexter,2mlkgr,phuckdolphins,6,Tue Nov 18 01:55:40 2014 UTC,"Ahhh the first few episodes were so crisp. He's a serial killer, not any sort of anti-hero yet."

Dexter,2mkp2n,LucretiusCarus,4,Mon Nov 17 22:45:02 2014 UTC,"Don't skip it. It's pretty much the same storyline, but there are some huge plot differences. Plus, you should always read the first book to see the way the author portrays the character."
Dexter,2mkp2n,GrammarWizard,2,Mon Nov 17 21:48:29 2014 UTC,"Reading the first book was the most interesting for me. It both explains some of the reasons for how things were set up, and it describes some character traits that weren't so obvious to me without reading about them. Some of the things that might seem just a little bit weird in the show can be explained by the writers wanting to follow the book, but put their own idea to it."
Dexter,2mhc0q,bjeanjade,37,Sun Nov 16 18:07:19 2014 UTC,"Sigh. Literally anything else could have been a better ending.

Dexter,2mhc0q,michaelkeene,15,Sun Nov 16 21:35:50 2014 UTC,"For me, the hardest part was that I actually read a description of the supposed leaked finale. It sounded pretty legit, but it also sounded terrible. Pretty much the big thing was that Quinn partnered up with Dexter, if I remember correctly. It was super dumb, but I thought to myself: ""Well, this is the worst possible way it could end, so at least there's that.""   Then we got something worse."
Dexter,2mhc0q,Corarium,2,Sun Nov 16 20:32:54 2014 UTC,"I honestly think that Showtime could just say S9 wasn't canon and redo the whole thing and most people would be fine with it. I think the way the to end the series should have been with Deb dying in the penultimate episode as a way to build suspense, but in the finale, Dexter should have been discovered and executed in a federal penitentiary. One way that might have happened is maybe he goes on the run with Hannah and Harrison, but they get cornered near the Mexican border (they're going to Mexico to then fly to Argentina or something along those lines) and Dexter turns himself in so that Hannah and Harrison could escape.  This should have been the way the execution goes down, I would have cried tears over it if it did: http://www.eonline.com/news/461558/chills-former-dexter-producer-clyde-phillips-reveals-how-he-planned-to-end-the-series"

Dexter,2mhc0q,inlinesix,4,Sun Nov 16 21:26:16 2014 UTC,"How in the fuck did he even survive being in the ocean during a hurricane? I hate that he just threw Deb in the ocean. Technically, she was one of his victims as he shut off the life support, but fuck, that's just harsh."
Dexter,2mhc0q,guntabon,5,Mon Nov 17 15:24:15 2014 UTC,"I think that was kinda the point. She was indirectly one of his victims by exposing her to his dark side so he ""buried"" with the rest of his victims."
Dexter,2mhc0q,Corarium,3,Mon Nov 17 17:45:40 2014 UTC,"That's understandable. I've read a lot of opinions on Deb's death but I don't think I'll ever be okay with it. Despite her being hated by a not-so-small amount of Dexter fans, she was still a main character that added a lot to the show in terms of story lines and the character development of Dexter, and I felt that an ending that seemed rushed and, to be honest, a bit of a cop out wasn't deserved by that character."
Dexter,2mhc0q,brody10123,3,Mon Nov 17 17:57:12 2014 UTC,...People don't like Deb? IAlwayslikedHer
Dexter,2mhc0q,Dunyal,1 point,Wed Nov 26 09:16:01 2014 UTC,"All in all, I would have been fine with Deb being killed by Dexter in the end, that would have been fitting for the show's dark theme, but the I agree with your description of the way it was executed, rushed."
Dexter,2mhc0q,NOMMING,2,Thu Nov 20 03:13:44 2014 UTC,"The worst part was she was dumped in the exact same way as all the criminals Dexter killed. Call me crazy, but didn't Deb deserve a funeral with full police honors instead of a killer's fate?"
Dexter,2mhc0q,ElRed_,8,Thu Nov 20 18:55:44 2014 UTC,"The lumberjack this was actually kinda smart.  As a punishment to himself, Dexter sent himself into isolation to cut down trees with a chainsaw. The same tool that was used to massacre his mother. I think he believed that he needed to be punished for his actions throughout his life but as the justice system couldn't punish him, he decided to punish himself.   Nevertheless, it was an extremely mediocre ending to the show."
Dexter,2mhc0q,NOMMING,8,Mon Nov 17 11:04:05 2014 UTC,"That chainsaw reference feels very far-fetched. If they were going for this, working on a boat shipping containers would have been easier to piece together."
Dexter,2mhc0q,Dunyal,3,Mon Nov 17 13:45:22 2014 UTC,"wow you just dropped the mic on me there  i never even thought of it like that, honestly this makes the ending a little better for me.  but yeah, the show's ending was definitely not on par with how well written the rest of it was."
Dexter,2mhc0q,Tooky17,3,Tue Nov 18 01:31:04 2014 UTC,It's a bit of a stretch. I doubt the writers planned it. We're just looking into it too much. When I think lumberjack I think of an axe not a chainsaw.

Dexter,2mhyqu,Werfel,1 point,Sun Nov 16 21:40:44 2014 UTC,"So, a few things I noticed...  Dexter's personality is so charming in the beginning. He's almost ""too much"" as compared to later seasons.   Dexter's first kill that we see is done by a drill, not a blade. Usually if there's an alternate kill method, there's a reason but I can't find one.   Laguerta clearly has a thing for  Dexter in this episode.   And when Dexter is on a date with Rita, and he comes across the ice truck killer's victim, he becomes aroused to the point that he 'feels up' Rita while talking about with with her later.   Edit: spelling"
Dexter,2mhyqu,Natezami,2,Sun Nov 16 21:53:37 2014 UTC,"Well a lot of the kill was very different from the rest because it was the pilot and nothing was really well established yet...  I think also a reason his personality was so overt, was also because it was the pilot and they had to make the distinction between his lives even more intense..."

His last victim was Deb, the person he'd always been trying to protect. In order to avoid doing more damage, he faked his death to leave his son and Hannah safe together. But he still has to live with himself knowing that he was the cause of essentially his worst fear coming true, which is pretty much Dexter's version of hell"

And just when she's getting into it, you grab her by the hips, and you yell another woman's name, and, bam, you're riding her like a bronco, because she's trying to buck you off.  Dexter Morgan: [thinking] Many times in life I feel like I'm missing some essential piece of the human puzzle. This is one of them."

Dexter,2mcr2y,Beagle2007,5,Sat Nov 15 05:51:15 2014 UTC,"Read the first book. If you love Dexter's monologues, you'll be in for a treat. Here are the first two paragraphs from the first book, Darkly Dreaming Dexter:   MOON. GLORIOUS MOON. FULL, FAT, REDDISH moon, the night as light as day, the moonlight flooding down across the land and bringing joy, joy, joy. Bringing too the full-throated call of the tropical night, the soft and wild voice of the wind roaring through the hairs on your arm, the hollow wail of starlight, the teeth-grinding bellow of the moonlight off the water.  All calling to the Need. Oh, the symphonic shriek of the thousand hiding voices, the cry of the Need inside, the entity, the silent watcher, the cold quiet thing, the one that laughs, the Moondancer. The me that was not-me, the thing that mocked and laughed and came calling with its hunger. With the Need. And the Need was very strong now, very careful cold coiled creeping crackly cocked and ready, very strong, very much ready now—and still it waited and watched, and it made me wait and watch."
Dexter,2mcr2y,furiousBobcat,8,Sat Nov 15 15:29:27 2014 UTC,Obviously read that in Dexter's voice. Great read.
Dexter,2mcr2y,qwedswerty,4,Sat Nov 15 17:17:07 2014 UTC,"I always felt book-dexter was way more creepy than show-dexter. But once I rewatched it from the start, at season 1 episode 1, show-dexter is almost as creepy as the books. The biggest thing the book gave me, though, was emphazising more clearly a lot of the small character traits that is also shown in the show, and it makes me appreciate the show more, to see that they included all of those stuff, even when it's just details that hardly or not at all even get mentioned."

Dexter,2mcr2y,cracktacular,3,Wed Nov 19 04:32:30 2014 UTC,Ok here's the thing. It doesn't get BAD. Season 4 was just so fucking incredible. There are a couple good seasons after it like 6 and 7 I found enjoyable. 5 was alright too. The main season people had a tough time with was the back end of season 8. I HIGHLY recommend you watch the entire series. It was honestly my favorite show.

Dexter,2mbh88,John_Foreskin,6,Fri Nov 14 21:04:41 2014 UTC,"I don't think this sub was here back then.  When enough of us want to start a marathon, there may be."
Dexter,2mbh88,heruskael,1 point,Fri Nov 14 20:53:34 2014 UTC,Well... I'm in!
Dexter,2m7864,Dream_Out_Loud,25,Thu Nov 13 18:06:52 2014 UTC,"Absolutely. The impact would have been stronger as our surprise would be the same as his.  But showing deb come in was pretty effective in heightening that constant sense of ""is he gonna get caught"" to a degree that is almost unbearable so I think it was OK anyway  But I think you're right"
Dexter,2m7864,Natezami,7,Thu Nov 13 18:54:33 2014 UTC,"Right, and I think that ""is he gonna get caught"" fear is incorporated into the show so often on purpose. Idk about y'all but my adrenaline rushes every single time I think he's gonna get caught (even after re-watching the series tons of times)"
Dexter,2m7864,yubugger,2,Thu Nov 13 19:07:57 2014 UTC,"Yea definitely. I think its one of the best parts of the show. It gives it a sense of purpose ie don't get caught, making every event and choice just as important as the last."
Dexter,2m7864,Natezami,11,Thu Nov 13 19:25:34 2014 UTC,"The thing I really love about that ending was that the overall theme of the season was religion, and it's pretty obvious that Dexter doesn't believe in God.  Then the last words the audience hears just before the season ends when he gets caught are, ""Oh God."""
Dexter,2m7864,nickces,2,Thu Nov 13 20:53:41 2014 UTC,"You're right and I remember saying something similar to that. It would have been a little more entertaining and shocking to the audience rather than it be suspenseful. Could have made a scene where Deb is like ""im calling it a day"" and have the audience believe everything is back to normal when Dexter is making his kill and then off the scene hear Debs voice ""Dexter?"""
Dexter,2m7864,im_lost_at_sea,2,Thu Nov 13 18:56:27 2014 UTC,"You're totally right, the scene would've been much better like this. But I still liked it nonetheless and thought it was a huge cliffhanger."
Dexter,2m7864,bigsickselby,2,Thu Nov 13 21:05:55 2014 UTC,"In a way I kind of liked it, it reminded me of the Season 5 ending so the whole time I'm thinking, ok, how's he gonna wiggle his way out of this one...and when he's caught dead red it was pretty shocking.  Though I bet your way would be overall better"
Dexter,2m7864,ShadowSora,-1,Thu Nov 13 22:11:48 2014 UTC,"I disagree. 'How will he deal with revealing this to the closest person in his life?' Is a much more emotionally gripping and difficult question than 'who was phone?'  It asks more questions, harder questions and it builds better suspense to have debs lead up to catching him be halted and not resolved."
Dexter,2m7864,Brookface,2,Thu Nov 13 21:37:58 2014 UTC,"That's not what OP was suggesting. He's only stating that they shouldn't have let the audience know Deb was approaching the scene, and instead increased our surprise when he looks up to find her."
Dexter,2m7864,r0ryb0ryalis,0,Fri Nov 14 02:42:41 2014 UTC,I addressed that in the first comment.
Dexter,2m7864,Brookface,2,Fri Nov 14 02:51:19 2014 UTC,"| to have debs lead up to catching him be halted and not resolved.  Still think there's some misunderstanding. OP's scenario does not halt Dex's being caught and the resolution remains identical to the season ending we got. The only change is the lead up to it: knowing Deb is there ahead of time, or only finding out alongside Dexter, in the final moment of the season."
Dexter,2m7864,r0ryb0ryalis,2,Fri Nov 14 03:54:08 2014 UTC,"Right, i prefer the build-up. No misunderstanding."
Dexter,2m7ept,Ironnhead,19,Thu Nov 13 19:03:28 2014 UTC,You have now finished Dexter. Great series.
Dexter,2m7ept,JoelKizz,4,Thu Nov 13 23:46:45 2014 UTC,"When I saw Rita dead, I stopped watching the show until season 8 started. I seriously could NOT imagine the show without her, and especially Dexter. That was a really depressing moment in the show. Eventually, I had to be eased back into the show."
Dexter,2m7ept,MorganAlyssa95,6,Sun Nov 16 19:22:21 2014 UTC,"Don't worry - I cried so much when Rita died. It does get better, yes... Season 5 is a drag (I felt) but season 6, 7 and the first half of season 8 is fantastic. People on here seem to think the show declines from S4 onward but I personally enjoyed the whole series from start to finish - excluding the last few episodes of season 8 but you will see why when you get there."
Dexter,2m7ept,Fallingfromreality_,0,Thu Nov 13 19:16:42 2014 UTC,"I agree with you. I didn't like 5 that much, but really enjoyed season 6 and 7. 8 was meh of course."

Dexter,2m5h9k,LazyWatermelon,5,Thu Nov 13 04:39:45 2014 UTC,Have you seen chuck? It has that same element in wear generally most episodes have something happen in them. The characters are ridiculous and funny but the show also has its dramatic moments.

Dexter,2m5h9k,Subulie,3,Thu Nov 13 16:09:19 2014 UTC,Breaking Bad was one of my favourite shows as well.
Dexter,2m5h9k,qwedswerty,3,Fri Nov 14 01:16:22 2014 UTC,"I feel exactly the same way as you do, favourite show by a fkn mile and I've found it extremely hard to move.. I'm sorry I can't really help you with other shows but what I've done is, because I didn't like how it ended (or the last minute of the series at least), I've started going around looking at fan written endings. I guess it's not really moving on but the thought about reading something new about Dexter is exciting."
Dexter,2m5h9k,Dukeee03,3,Fri Nov 14 13:29:31 2014 UTC,"Any show that has this leangth also typically have more significance in every episode. The two ""must-sees"" are ofcourse Game of Thrones and The Wire. Neither of them are really similar to Dexter, though. I can't think of a show that is. Breaking Bad might be the most similar I can think of, but I didn't enjoy it."
Dexter,2m5h9k,Dukeee03,2,Sun Nov 16 14:16:30 2014 UTC,I recommend reading the books  Edit: whoops you were looking for shows
Dexter,2m5h9k,Monsieur-Anana,3,Thu Nov 13 13:44:22 2014 UTC,Well I didn't really consider the books because I heard that the show was way better. Do you think the books are still worth a read?
Dexter,2m5h9k,der1x,3,Fri Nov 14 01:17:54 2014 UTC,I enjoy them. The first one is very similar to the first season but after that the stories are different. It is also constantly from dexters perspective so it's kinda like one big monologue

Or possibly a sample from Isaak Sirko saying Dexters name (since it's more British sounding lol)"

Dexter,2lzdmv,TrueStriver,16,Tue Nov 11 17:24:53 2014 UTC,"I still think the entire final season went in completely the wrong direction. It seemed like the entire series was building up to Dexter getting found out by his colleagues at Miami Metro, and spending the final season dealing with that. The betrayal, the ""it was you the whole time!"" all of that would have been amazing.   Instead we had a total letdown of a season where 1) Everyone forgot completely about LaGuerta and the fishy circumstances under which she died, 2) we had a totally boring and not-believable romance between Dexter and Hannah, 3) bullshit acting from Harrison (OWWW OWWWW), and 4) that ending. Ugh.   I agree with your breakdown of the finale for sure. I just think the issues definitely extended beyond just the finale, but through the entire final season."
Dexter,2lzdmv,bonesaw_is_ready,5,Tue Nov 11 20:53:41 2014 UTC,"My biggest problem with the final season and even a little of 7 was that Dexter abandoned a lot that he valued.  Like in the other seasons he would do anything to protect his children and be a good father but then he leaves one in Argentina and the other two without even a goodbye.  Also that he fell so ""deeply"" in love with Hannah. I guess its because she understood him but so did lumen so why did he risk getting caught and dissapointing deb to be with this impulsive and dangerous woman? It seemed unfair to Rita how much he wanted to be with hannah .  It just seems like Hannah's impulsive nature is what caused him to make all the changes and mistakes that he did including sparing Saxon and allowing deb to get shot...  That's just me though. The ending left me very disspointed in him"
Dexter,2lzdmv,Natezami,2,Wed Nov 12 00:19:45 2014 UTC,"Dexter was and still is my all time favourite show but as much I hate to admit it and face the truth, the ending was such a disappointment. The way I thought it was going to go was, Dexter was going to ride out on his boat and die to the storm (Which would have been better but still not the best), but the fact that he's left alive just leaves way too many questions unanswered. The biggest thing that annoys me is, I just can't imagine Dexter being able to live his life with Debra... sad that she died... I can just see the guilt eating away at Dexter and later leading to his demise."

I would have liked the last series be about them hunting him down. The end of the 7th LaGuerta doesn't get killed but Deb turns the gun on Dexter. He flees. 8th season everyone is hunting him, but Deb still has contact, helping him escape. The love interest between her and Quinn grows but he is hot on Dexters tail. Final episode, Quinn finds him, they fight but Dexter gets the better of him, just as he is about to kill him Deb bursts in, pointing her gun at Dexter. She has to choose between her brother or the love of her life. She chooses Quinn and shoots Dexter. Final scenes have Deb taking Harrison as her own now, but not letting him know what happened to her father, leaving audiences thinking ""will he go down the same path"".  Anything would have been better than the lumberjack scene!  Edit: Still one of my favourite series of all time! It's about the journey, not the destination"

Dexter,2lrihh,Jowsten,2,Mon Nov 10 20:28:09 2014 UTC,I was in it for dexter. I viewed the other characters just as dexter did. They were just people he surrounded himself with to make him normal or to keep up appearances. For the most part it was him isolated from them internally. I connected with that and looked at them like he did. I didn't honestly care about what was happening in their lives. But I tolerated it just as dexter would.  It was me and dexter through the whole show.
Dexter,2lrihh,DesertTortoiseSex,3,Sun Nov 9 23:35:16 2014 UTC,"I mean it's impossible to view the characters are more than that. Because the writers did a godawful job at making them anything but little pawns that are terrible at their job until the plot demands they have some brilliant insight.   I feel like this is brushing off some really shitty writing and character development as ""just how Dexter sees it."" Not to mention, Dexter isn't even anything resembling a consistent, or particularly deep, character himself."
Dexter,2lrihh,Jowsten,2,Tue Nov 11 04:22:24 2014 UTC,You bring up a great point. I just never thought of it like that. I was just saying my immediate reaction and how I took it all as I watched the show. I never really thought of why I might have taken it as such.

Dexter,2lrihh,Discoteca,7,Wed Nov 12 05:26:10 2014 UTC,"I mean, I get it. The point of this season is that he isn't 100% psychopath like Vogel thought. But he could have just gotten it over with, rather than getting Deb involved. Saxon has the potential to reveal everything about Dexter to the cops, and even if they don't believe him, it's still suspicious why this lab geek keeps getting involved with these crazy serial killers."
Dexter,2lrihh,ccc66,5,Sun Nov 9 16:53:21 2014 UTC,"As much as I hate season eight and how ham-handed it all was, I completely disagree with you as do the makers of the show form the beginning. Dexter was never actually intended to be a remorseless psychopathic serial killer as we learn in season 1 episode 8 with this scene. This is why Dexter is truly fascinating as a character.  The problem is, the earlier seasons handled this with elegance, subtlety and prowess - season 8 was a forced rehash of what was already established both to the audience and to Dexter himself.  They didn't redefine who Dexter was halfway through - I'm not sure how people miss this massive character trait of his. I think people wanted him to be a remorseless, straight-forward sociopath, so they would ignore every telltale sign. Signs such as each season revolving around Dexter trying to find someone to connect with; Dexter bonding with his family; Dexter feeling emotions.   So, you're wrong, and I think you should rewatch the show because you missed out on what really makes it special (until season five that is!)"
Dexter,2lrihh,dickdarkstar,2,Sun Nov 9 16:58:42 2014 UTC,"What made the final season of Dexter special for me was it becoming a spectacle like The Room, and getting to enjoy the hilarious discussions.

Dexter,2loqy5,shiggydiggypreoteins,34,Sat Nov 8 17:21:14 2014 UTC,"SPOILERS FOR SEASON 5. I think killing her off was the right thing to do. However, what they did after that was what ruined it for me. They handled the aftermath of Rita's death horribly. It takes Dexter so long to find someone he's comfortable with and the whole point of Rita's death was to prove that Dexter can't be with anyone because ""he's what's wrong"" and can't keep them safe. So what do they do just a couple episodes later? They get him another girlfriend. One that he somehow falls for almost immediately even though it took Dexter years to care for Rita. It just felt like a giant slap in the face to me and Rita's character."
Dexter,2loqy5,Chalky97,9,Sat Nov 8 17:49:29 2014 UTC,"THIS is my main problem with the rest of Dexter. I liked the ending overall and season 8 wasn't THAT bad (although it did seem rushed and I wanted more from that kid working on the video game), but the romance shit they do with Dexter after season 4 is just bad. I'd be fine with the Lumen story IF we had more time, like maybe a season or 2. I wasn't that interested in Hannah, especially at the end where they just tried to throw her on as a loving character and good mother for Harrison. But I get his attraction to her at least and he had time to actually build that a bit. My main problem after Rita is when Dexter gets that blowjob from that woman at his high school reunion. That was straight up just meant to show us boobs and made no sense."
Dexter,2loqy5,Girafarigging,9,Sat Nov 8 19:12:38 2014 UTC,"nah season 8 was terrible. I agree with you otherwise but the main issue with the last four seasons is the characters no longer have consistent motives. Dexter is an anti-social guy who doesn't have sexual feelings except through the single woman he ever loved? Let's show him getting a blowie! Batista, arguably the most dedicated and sensible detective in Miami PD, finds that his lover has been killed? Let's build a nice bench and then never think about her again! Debra has become a burn out druggie who gives not a single fuck? Nevermind she is fine, doing basically the same job for a private org."
Dexter,2loqy5,mtf612,3,Sat Nov 8 20:57:00 2014 UTC,"Ah, right. I forgot a lot of that lol good point. Yeah, not a great season lol"
Dexter,2loqy5,Girafarigging,7,Sun Nov 9 02:00:17 2014 UTC,"If Dexter was a movie instead of a television show, that's exactly how it would have ended - with Harrison crying in Rita's blood.  Then, a few years later, we would have some awful new director make a terrible sequel (S5-8) that everyone would hate. In fact, season eight would've probably been split up into two movies alone just to stretch it the fuck out to make more money off the franchise."
Dexter,2loqy5,FinchyGurl99,3,Sun Nov 9 05:52:42 2014 UTC,"ENDING WILL BE MENTIONED: I am rewatching the show. I have just finished season 4. It is interesting rewatching it all again. I am supporting other characters and not just Dexter. I find that his actions annoy me more, and i am seeing how destructive he is.  I think the ending of season 4 was very good. I also enjoyed the series quite a lot. It probably has the best ending of the first 4 series for me. Rita really annoyed me a a character, but she didn't deserve to die. I think that probably part of the reason she dies, another innocent as collateral damage. Oh also earlier in S4 when Dexter kills the photographer he says it is the first innocent he has killed? Was he meaning on the table? because he went through the whole 'i fucked up' phase after he killed Miguels brother at the start of S3.  As i am rewatching the show i am wishing characters had not died (Rita, Doakes, Brian) but they all needed to die for the show. What does annoy me about the ending is that we don't get to see everyones reaction. I want to see the others after they have seen Dexter has been the Bay Harbour Butcher. Or even if Dexter had died it would have been a better ending. You get a glimpse of it (from what i remember) when he stabs the dude in the neck with the pen and he talks to Batista after... but they just let him go.   It's just a huge fucking anticlimax. A real let down we don't get to see those reactions."
Dexter,2loqy5,hi-i-am-new-here,3,Tue Nov 11 23:58:02 2014 UTC,"Season 2 was fantastic, but eliminating the foil to the main character should not have happened so soon.  Season 4 was even more amazing, but eliminating so much plot potential made it very difficult for them to move on.  The writers had a thing for writing themselves into a corner over and over and then they handed the show over to a less capable group after season 4.  I try my best to focus on the characters and the good times. I liked those things."
Dexter,2loqy5,Neobo,2,Sun Nov 9 08:25:42 2014 UTC,Fuck off. Dont join the bandwagon of ignorance.
Dexter,2loqy5,Rawrsicles,-2,Tue Nov 11 02:48:17 2014 UTC,"It only goes downhill after season 4 son, sorry.  You've seen the best of it"
Dexter,2loqy5,Arkamus,0,Sat Nov 8 21:37:36 2014 UTC,thats what ive heard a lot. So just looked up the last 4 seasons on wikipedia. The ending was very disappointing
Dexter,2loqy5,StoicGunner,7,Sat Nov 8 22:01:58 2014 UTC,Half of season seven was damn good honestly. I forget the villains name but he was very tenacious and enthusiastic. Until they kill him half way through the season. Ugh.
Dexter,2loqy5,kaztrator,7,Sat Nov 8 22:14:05 2014 UTC,Isaac Sirko is probably my favorite character in all of Dexter.
Dexter,2loqy5,FireLordIzumi,4,Sun Nov 9 00:10:40 2014 UTC,You should watch it and form your own opinion. IMO season 3 was super weak and I enjoyed season 6 a lot
Dexter,2lmpwx,DatMac10,42,Sat Nov 8 00:15:23 2014 UTC,"I love Dexter, but I acknowledge that Walter White is a much better antihero.   Also, watchmojo is shit."
Dexter,2lmpwx,SkyMaro,5,Sat Nov 8 04:45:37 2014 UTC,"SPOILERS FOR BREAKING BAD BELOW:  Walter White is not an anti-hero, he's a villain.  He had a boy poisoned not for the greater good, but so that he could get Jesse on the anti-Gus train.  Dexter is probably more of a villain too."
Dexter,2lmpwx,PSkip,9,Sat Nov 8 06:07:31 2014 UTC,"Thats bullshit, you are forgetting Walter blackmailing his former business partners into paying for his family's well being after his death.  That and Walter goes back knowing full well he will die to save Jesse. I don't know what you are smoking, but thats pretty anti-hero to me."
Dexter,2lmpwx,HairyAsHull,1 point,Sat Nov 8 06:34:38 2014 UTC,"It's not bullshit.  Walter realized he was being a cunt after everything was over and he realized what he had done.  Walter White was villain for most of the show, it wasn't until Hank died that he realized he was shitty person and had fucked everything up, and that's when he went back to the Walt that he was at the beginning of the series.  He said it himself, he did everything for him, because he liked it.  The whole show is about the fine-line between anti-heroism and villainy.  I think we could argue for either anti-hero or villain and neither of us would be wrong."
Dexter,2lmpwx,PSkip,-1,Sat Nov 8 21:41:13 2014 UTC,"Your points are well said, nonetheless, I interprut a villian as one with little to no saving attributes, the one who cares for none but themselves.  Dexter throughout the series has relationships he develops that he is willing to put above himself, as difficult as it was for him. Walter did the same thing. He ruined Jesse, and tried to attone."

Dexter,2lmpwx,Hereforthefreecake,2,Sat Nov 8 06:26:12 2014 UTC,"But Walt is a chemical perfectionist. He took the exact amount to get him to the hospital without dying. He would never kill a child. And also, for the first 4 and a half seasons he was an anti hero, the show was about him becoming a villain and he did, but only towards the end.He was IMO the greatest antihero on tv and became the greatest villain."

Dexter,2lhl94,paulrulez742,6,Thu Nov 6 17:47:30 2014 UTC,"Yeah. I had to go in this with a clear head because I had just wrapped up Breaking Bad, which I loved. I knew from the first season I wouldn't like it as much."
Dexter,2lhl94,hellshot8,2,Thu Nov 6 18:03:12 2014 UTC,"I agree, it wasnt THAT bad. Though it is an extremely noticeable lower quality than seasons before. Along with that, it wasn't even what the season did that made people angry, its what people didnt do. Fans were promised like..dexter maybe being caught, stuff with the police(these things were even hinted at in the previews) and just none of that happened. Instead, dexter fell for another ditsy crazy woman and tries to feel love again. Understandably, lots of fans felt lied to"
Dexter,2lhl94,Dream_Out_Loud,3,Thu Nov 6 18:48:10 2014 UTC,"Ok, so I have to admit I feel like the ending was a letdown. After all of the drama with Harrison, he just decided to send him to another country with a woman that has a history of poisoning people, including himself?... Yeah, I feel like that's a last resort and they should have just let him be dead in the hurricane. Also, I feel like killing LaGuerta was kind of lazy and pulled away from the sympathy that I had for Dexter's need to kill.  Also, I almost cried when Rita died. I was so not ready for that. I knew something would happen eventually, but I almost would have preferred that she found out that he was a murderer and took the kids away. In my mind, I figured she'd leave and make a return during the 7th or 8th season and we'd get this wrapped up as a happily ever after kind of thing."
Dexter,2lhl94,Dream_Out_Loud,2,Thu Nov 6 17:04:32 2014 UTC,i didn't like the ending because i didn't like the course they chose.  but i enjoyed Season 8 a lot leading up to that.  I maintain they should have ended the show one episode (and about 3 minutes) early.
Dexter,2lhl94,bigsickselby,1 point,Thu Nov 6 20:27:51 2014 UTC,I'm gonna rewatch that episode up until that moment.
Dexter,2lhl94,MisterChet,1 point,Thu Nov 6 20:49:32 2014 UTC,"spoiler alert:  my position is that Dexter started as a murderous robot who faked all his emotions. and years and years of hard work and his understanding what caused the need to kill in the first place has helped him have real emotions and have real relationships with people.  As such, he could easily be able to manage his urge to kill and sacrifice it for others.  so, the point the show should have ended was when Deb said goodbye to Dex and was about turn in the bad guy who was tied up.  Dex said goodbye to Harry for good, and then he was going to leave with Hannah and Harrison.  it would have been a very satisfying ending.  but alas they added another hour and totally changed that ending.  i didn't like that (though it was well done)."
Dexter,2lhl94,_rattlesnake,2,Fri Nov 7 17:25:47 2014 UTC,"It had its faults like every TV show does, but I personally stuck through with it just because of how phenomenal of an actor Michael C. Hall is."
Dexter,2lhl94,matty25,4,Fri Nov 7 00:11:33 2014 UTC,I think it just should have ended around 5-6 seasons. It's just almost impossible to keep a show like Dexter running without it losing creativity/plausibility.
Dexter,2lhl94,Subulie,2,Thu Nov 6 23:11:28 2014 UTC,"If felt unlikely. Especially after the ending of Season 7.   I expect something much bigger to happen. Luckily I wasn't exposed to the trailers, so I didn't really set too high of an expectation."

If I could re-write this season, I would have had Dexter suspect Marshall after the first killing, leading to a confrontation where Marshall confesses to being a puppet. Marshall would escape and Dexter continues to go after him. Because Dexter never meets the puppeteer, he continues to go after Marshall since Vice is suspecting Gellar as the killer. Plus, according to Dexter's code he'd probably wait a bit longer to make sure that Marshall led him to Gellar and that Marshall wouldn't do this on his own, willfully. Then I'd introduce the interactions between Marshall and Prof Gellar. Towards the last couple episodes the Vice would find Gellar's body and we'd find out that what we're seeing of Gellar is just flashbacks. Then it'd pick up with Marshall following through with the doomsday plans.  TL;DR I would have preferred Gellar be flashbacks and Vice find Gellar's body."

Dexter,2lfzls,iamdroppy,-2,Thu Nov 6 08:51:29 2014 UTC,I called the twist in like episode 2 and then they revealed it in 8(?) and they acted like I should be shocked. The whole religious motivation and schizo killer was a cool idea but i just kind of hated the way they did it.
Dexter,2lfzls,broncoz33,-3,Thu Nov 6 16:43:49 2014 UTC,Season 6 is better than Season 5. You can pretty much skip season 5 except for maybe the first episode and you wouldn't be confused next season.
Dexter,2lfzls,der1x,2,Thu Nov 6 17:15:45 2014 UTC,Season 5 was my least favorite season mostly because I was already tired of Dexter being as bad at relationships as Dexter was. Everything that happened that season was awkward.

I feel like Deb just dying like that was bullshit and just plain sad -- Deb dying wasn't particularly a bad thing, but I kept watching as he killed her and he drove off in his boat, waiting for something surprising to happen... Nope, no surprises, he dumps her body.   It would have been truly satisfying for Dexter's killings to be exposed, going down as a historical serial killer, admired by many in law enforcement for his code -- the formulation of which by Harry and Vogel is also exposed.   I once read an ending something like: On the last episode, Dexter is in a kill room killing someone. The person he is killing tipped off the police, outsmarting dexter. Dexter just stabbed this person in the heart and Deb is first on the seen, opens the door and sees Dexter. Closes the door and behind the door many more police officers."

Hannah is the hottest, IMO, so definitely the one to fuck (I have the hugest crush on Yvonne Strahovski; I'm a huge Chuck fan). And I couldn't stand Lyla, so kill that bitch in the face."
Dexter,2ku0ck,Koalaz,7,Fri Oct 31 02:23:36 2014 UTC,"haha, chuck is the reason i love hannah so much...if it wasnt for the fact that i fell in love with her from chuck...she'd get the kill in this game lol."
Dexter,2ku0ck,XA36,10,Fri Oct 31 02:27:50 2014 UTC,Anyone who says differently is wrong. There are no opinions here.
Dexter,2ku0ck,Alibear,4,Fri Oct 31 04:05:34 2014 UTC,"Yes! Lyla is just crazy and evil and I hate her. And Lumen is like... One of the few people on the show that actually seems like a pleasant person. Hannah is too controlling (and crazy). If we are using fuck in the non literal sense, I would be fine with that. I do not like her... But she isn't crazy and unpredictable like Lyla at least."

Dexter,2ku0ck,suckerswag,55,Fri Oct 31 09:23:28 2014 UTC,"Fuck Lyla, marry Hannah, Kill Lumen.   Lyla is nutso... but the hottest imo, so I'd bang her.   Hannah is pretty hot, and showed herself to be fairly faithful towards the end, so wife her up.   Lumen isn't the hottest, and was really a needy handful. Off with her head."
Dexter,2ku0ck,skepticscorner,1 point,Sat Nov 1 18:33:01 2014 UTC,"Word, the only thing I have to add is that even with years of therapy, Lumen is totally fucked in the head forever. Put her out of her misery."

Dexter,2ku0ck,Shnuggums,13,Fri Oct 31 03:34:08 2014 UTC,I'd probably marry Hannah because she makes one fine as hell trophy wife. Fuck Lyla because I have a thing for British women. And kill Lumen because I hated her character and was the worst part of season 5 for me.
Dexter,2ku0ck,PSkip,8,Fri Oct 31 02:44:39 2014 UTC,I hate Hannah so I'd kill her. Obviously fuck Lila because she's crazy. Marry Lumen because I like her character.

Dexter,2kjlfz,walterpinkman45,10,Tue Oct 28 05:49:10 2014 UTC,She does get a little bit better by the end but my god she is such a fucking teenager for the first like 5 or 6 seasons
Dexter,2kjlfz,socxc9,3,Tue Oct 28 16:40:18 2014 UTC,Season 4's got nothing on Seasons 1 and 2.
Dexter,2kjlfz,Weltall548,1 point,Thu Nov 6 04:32:32 2014 UTC,I loved seasons 1 and 2. I just thought that 4 was a little better than those 2. John Lithgow made that season so much better by playing the Trinity Killer. And the end...oh god that ending of season 4.
Dexter,2kjlfz,walterpinkman45,7,Thu Nov 6 04:39:36 2014 UTC,"bad news for you:  she doesn't stop being Deb.  it's the same all the way through.  Good news for us:  she doesn't stop being Deb.  it's the same all the way through.  Deb is awesome.  great character.  messed up emotionally, smart, conflicted, upstart, confident, fearful, insecure, defensive, and many more.  she's a GREAT character and she does a great job."
Dexter,2kjlfz,Dream_Out_Loud,15,Wed Oct 29 21:44:04 2014 UTC,Get to season 4 then drop it after that. Season 4 doesn't include Deb all that much and includes one of the best villains on the show. Everything past that point won't be worth your time and ending on 4 works pretty well as a series finale.
Dexter,2kjlfz,MrMagoo22,5,Tue Oct 28 09:09:36 2014 UTC,I second this. The show goes downhill really fast after season 4.

Dexter,2kjlfz,PCGCentipede,7,Wed Oct 29 03:31:24 2014 UTC,I agree on eight and understand five and six but seven was amazing. It set up what should have been a great final season very well. Eight sucked though.
Dexter,2kjlfz,RespectThyHypnotoad,4,Wed Oct 29 04:49:28 2014 UTC,"Past season 4 Deb starts to play a more significant role in the story. Her performance in season 7 is the only real reason to watch season 7. If OP does not like Deb, then season 7 sucks for them."
Dexter,2kjlfz,MrMagoo22,4,Wed Oct 29 19:31:31 2014 UTC,"True.I hated deb but she grew on me a lot. I don't think the actress was very good at the start and she gets a lot better, I'd say she has the best character development on the show as well."

Throughout each season she falls into the same plot and plot holes. I love the emotion, frustration, and level of commitment she brings to the role in the middle of the series - you can tell Carpenter is really relying on her emotions from divorcing Hall. And it makes for wonderful television."

That being said, she's a really interesting character, and comes out with a few good lines.  Rita really pissed me off, but I continued watching because I knew it added to the plot that I loved so much. It'll be worth it - trust me."

Dexter,2kjqop,gtaguy12345,2,Wed Oct 29 01:49:41 2014 UTC,"""I just started watching Dexter, and one episode in I'm already hooked""  I'm certain what you said is what he meant to say, but look at what he said. Saying he is hooked after one episode implies he just started watching (which he explicitly states). He must have meant to say ""I was hooked after watching one episode"". Unless he really decided to skip the first 24 episodes of the series."

Dexter,2ke062,turntechDestiel,4,Mon Oct 27 12:46:53 2014 UTC,"I think the problem is that most people won't even accept that someone actually liked something they hated. It's fine to hate season 8, and it's fine not to hate it. The problem lies in the fact that the people here refuse to accept that anyone enjoyed the last season."
Dexter,2ke062,ThreePenisWin3,4,Mon Oct 27 16:12:24 2014 UTC,"YES! That's exactly right, it has gotten to the point where it seems like people think it's cool to dislike the last season and don't even give it a shot.

Dexter,2ke062,masonrb500,5,Mon Oct 27 19:00:56 2014 UTC,It was dissaponting but I thought it was a decent ending.
Dexter,2ke062,BroomPerson21,5,Sun Oct 26 18:55:17 2014 UTC,I didn't enjoy the last season but I personally liked the last episode except for the last 5 minutes. I really enjoyed the way Dex killed Saxon
Dexter,2ke062,Slaytounge,3,Sun Oct 26 18:57:35 2014 UTC,you havent seen any better shows then
Dexter,2ke062,REMAIN_IN_LIGHT,6,Sun Oct 26 19:00:12 2014 UTC,"The resolution we got was pretty weak. He should have been hunted, caught, and executed by the state. All the supporting characters are just kind of ignored, no resolution for them - no clear arch. We should have had an entire season dedicated to the truth being revealed and how it affects everyone in his life. The only thing we even see as closure at miami metro is Batista hearing Dexter is dead and all we get is a close up of him saying ""Dexter?!""  No one wanted a ""happy"" ending, we wanted a fucking good one."
Dexter,2ke062,caseyst,1 point,Mon Oct 27 00:26:21 2014 UTC,"All true. But I don't think he necessarily had to die for it to be ""good."" I would have been happy, too, with a 'Silence of the Lambs' type ending, where Dexter could have actually gotten away but still been on the loose. Where we see a less jarring jump in the timeline and its revealed that he's out there somewhere. It's all how they built up to the finale that killed it.  In my opinion, Dexter should have been the ""big bad"" of season 8. They could have flipped the script, where he's discovered unbeknownst to him and made it really interesting again. At any rate, I think they failed to make any decisions and/or omissions to the pool of ideas, and it all turned into a cluster fuck."

Gives you hope for something later on.  So, as endings go, meh... but as something that could be worked on later, it had potential."
Dexter,2ke062,pass_the_flask,2,Mon Oct 27 06:08:19 2014 UTC,Showtime reps said in an interview that they didn't give the producers any notes on what they could/couldn't do.

Dexter,2kb9sf,WeaponexT,13,Sat Oct 25 20:20:39 2014 UTC,Debra needed to kill Dexter. It was the only ending that should've happened.
Dexter,2kb9sf,kaztrator,6,Sat Oct 25 20:44:45 2014 UTC,No.  It needed to be Masuka.
Dexter,2kb9sf,Unwanted_Commentary,8,Sun Oct 26 03:25:07 2014 UTC,Or his daughter which had no plot point other than bewbs.
Dexter,2kb9sf,Orakk,5,Sun Oct 26 15:39:16 2014 UTC,"Agreed.  I think she should have killed him at the end of the second to last episode.    The last episode could have been him being outed.  We would have been able to see the reactions of every character we have grown to know, love and maybe even hate.  We would have had a chance to see how it affected the people who interacted with and trusted Dexter.  Ugh."
Dexter,2kb9sf,Potentially_Erect,3,Sun Oct 26 04:17:24 2014 UTC,"He should have been outed at the beginning of the final season, Breaking Bad style. The whole show was leading towards the hunt for Dexter and Batista was in the perfect position to be a huge antagonist to Dexter, hunting him down for murdering his ex-wife. It would have been exciting, suspenseful, exhilarating... basically the opposite of what we actually got."
Dexter,2kb9sf,kaztrator,7,Sun Oct 26 04:40:14 2014 UTC,"Damn, you're dead on. I never even considered that, but given everything that played out at the end yeah. She should have killed him, of course at the consequence of being fucked up over it forever probably, but such is the way it goes."
Dexter,2kb9sf,dickdarkstar,2,Sat Oct 25 22:46:54 2014 UTC,"It's the perfect ending. Not only is it the most poetic ending, but it's controversial enough to leave people thinking that ""they might not go there"". So even if you've considered it, it would still be shocking to see them actually go through with it."
Dexter,2kb9sf,kaztrator,3,Sun Oct 26 02:40:14 2014 UTC,"Indeed, I remember remarking after the series ended about how it could be argued that it's a story about Deb, as she had the most development and emotion growth/change of any other character in the series. It's sadly about a cop with a geeky brother who is apparently 'too perfect' compared to her chaotic life, only to find out the worst on top of everything, not even to mention the couple of other people she was close to getting killed largely on account of something to do with Dex.  This is why the Dexter universe needs to be considered a comic book universe, so we can explore other ideas like this"
Dexter,2kb9sf,dickdarkstar,1 point,Sun Oct 26 03:46:33 2014 UTC,They had it in the palms of there hand. If she just woukd of shot him in the shipping container in season 7 it would of been the perfect ending to the show.

Dexter,2k5mk4,imakittymeow11,12,Fri Oct 24 01:45:30 2014 UTC,"I'm currently on a rewatch. Dexter is a pretty subtle show that's big on meticulous behavior so I catch alot of subtle things now like glances between the characters, foreshadowing, small side comments etc. It's pretty relaxing in my opinion. Just do it, you'll find the reasons you liked the show again and maybe even appreciate a few seasons that you initially didn't like."
Dexter,2k5mk4,Spineline,4,Fri Oct 24 03:44:10 2014 UTC,"Either watch with someone who hasn't seen it, or give it more time. I honestly didn't mind the ending, but I recognized they could have done it better. Don't worry so much.  Season 1 alone is a standalone masterpiece, and a very close adaptation to a great book. Much after is easily digestable with enough time and interest. I personally liked seasons 2 and 3, tho many don't like 3. I also like the second book of the series the most, which is nothing like season 2 except in small, unimportant ways.   Season 4 is considered a masterpiece by many, on par with season 1, which again points to how good season 1 is, which, BTW, was also shot on film and not digital and leads to some beautifully shot, saturated, almost 'pastel' scenes that could never be achieved in digital, which I believe the rest of the series was shot in. (The first episode/20 minutes alone is a great example of this)  Much after, again, is fun after enough time and interest. I liked a lot of season 5, 6, 7, and even 8. Of course we all know how it goes, but just be zen about it. How could a story about a serial killer possibly end anyways?"
Dexter,2k5mk4,dickdarkstar,3,Fri Oct 24 04:20:12 2014 UTC,Good post but I'm still going to say   How could a story about a serial killer possibly end anyways?   Much better than it did. Much better.
Dexter,2k5mk4,burlal,2,Fri Oct 24 11:05:37 2014 UTC,"I rather liked Season 5 too (though it's not up to the strength of Season 4) but 6/7/8 went were just the pits. What's worst is that they set up some interesting stuff starting in Season 6 that seemed like it was going to play into an endgame for the show since they knew the end was coming and when... but then every time they introduced a new element that seemed like it could really be interesting they fucked it up later.   With Louis it seemed they were setting something really cool up where he could actually be a formidable force for Dexter to deal with... then he was cut out of the picture and Isaak had already been introduced + became more important, and was one of the best villains in any season of the show IMO, up there with Trinity and ITK... but his promise was squandered too.  Then Season 8 just pooped all over everything. It wasn't so much the ending that sucked, it was that you could see everything coming a mile away and even though they were setting stuff up you knew they were just going to fuck it up anyway. So many elements ended up being totally unimportant, Deb's baggage was quickly swept away, and then we just had the lame plot that led us to the end. Even the US Marshal was interesting, but he came in way too late in the game and then was cut out too in the end. The Dex/Deb romance was mentioned but never turned into anything, there were few real consequences of Deb finding out about him at the end of S6, etc. They made these big things happen, but then did barely anything with them.  It really felt like they could have consolidated some of those elements and turned them into a bigger continuous storyline to end the show... and worse, that was the route they seemed to be going at first but then threw it all out the window.  If I were going to re-watch the show now I'd probably stop after Season 5. I actually liked Colin Hanks quite a bit in Season 6 but the episodes just weren't very well-written and a lot of it seemed to be based around the spectacular nature of the crime scenes which did nothing for me."
Dexter,2k5mk4,caninehere,1 point,Sat Oct 25 19:33:48 2014 UTC,"I actually like a lot of season 7, it had what a lot of people wanted in it, someone who knew about Dex, but wasnt OK with it for a while, and the turmoil she faced dealing with it.  But I agree, they should have done MANY things differently."
Dexter,2k5mk4,dickdarkstar,1 point,Sat Oct 25 19:35:24 2014 UTC,"Season 7 wasn't bad in and of itself, but it was a crucial season in setting things up for the endgame and the show was already planned to end at that point. While it was alright as another season of the show, it fucked up pretty big in that it didn't set up any grand plotlines for Season 8... it tied off all the loose ends except for the events of the finale with Deb. I was actually quite excited watching S7 because, like I said, they introduced some cool stuff - but I was disappointed when it all faded away. The biggest problem with S7 wasn't S7's quality, it was S8's because they left nothing for the last season and then had to come up with this whole new plot with Vogel... IMO we should have already known what we were getting into when Season 8 started, and from there it's just watching the endgame unfold. S7 left S8 with nothing and going into S8 it was already a given it was going to suck."
Dexter,2k5mk4,caninehere,2,Sat Oct 25 19:39:15 2014 UTC,"I've watched it all 3 times now. Once by myself, then the other two times I watched with first timers. Seeing their reactions to shit was the best part."
Dexter,2k5mk4,walterpinkman45,2,Fri Oct 24 03:49:10 2014 UTC,"Maybe it requires some sort of drinking game as well. ""Dark Passenger"" = 1 shot, every time Deb swears you have to take a sip of beer (you'll likely get drunk off this last rule the most), etc."

Dexter,2k5mk4,BlackCatScott,1 point,Fri Oct 24 12:42:09 2014 UTC,"I actually just finished rewatching the entire series beginning to end. It was just as amazing as I hoped it would be. There are so many phenomenal characters and moments throughout each and every season. Seasons 1, 2 and 4 are great for obvious reasons, but there are subplots that you can forget about sometimes that blew my mind even the second time around. The way Deb goes super-detective and figures out the Vigilantes in Love about the barrel girls, the reappearance of a boyhood hero of Dexter's, Walter Kenney aka the Tooth Fairy, in his own city and the subtle foreshadowing of how all serial killers move to the Pacific Northwest.  Some of the killers Dexter hunts during the middle seasons (even though people were complaining about the quality of the show slipping) are just awesome. The female cop that tries to kill Dexter at his house, Ray Bull Axe Speltzer, the whole Brother Sam arc with Nick and the road trip with brother Brian that follows, Little Chino, Emmett Meridian the murderous shrink, Nathan Marten (one of my favorite kills, and the first time Dexter really breaks his code of only killing killers, yet he never feels one second of regret or conflict about it), there's hardly a single episode where you don't come across something that makes you go ""oh yeah, I loved this storyline!""  I highly recommend rewatching the series, with a newbie or not. It really reminds you of how great the show really was."

One thing that this show lacked was deep, complex characters that we cared about. Dexter and Deb were the only two characters like this. Sure there were others that you liked. But I'm the type of person that gets real attached to amazing characters and unfortunately, Dexter was usually pretty bad at character development. But Rita...she was amazing! Her story. The progression of her personality. I just really wanted her to stick around. It would have saved us 4 seasons of terrible relationship plot-lines.

Dexter,2jxsb1,Unwanted_Commentary,2,Wed Oct 22 21:09:40 2014 UTC,Lila was batshit crazy but at least she was intelligent.  Hannah was a typical dumb blond and ultimately made decisions that partially lead to the disaster that was the last season.
Dexter,2jxsb1,pero914,2,Wed Oct 22 20:36:05 2014 UTC,"i absolutely hated lila, and im in the minority that actually really like Hannah. That being said I didn't like the final season was well written and almost everything that happened in the final couple episode was over the top and just terrible. The only real problem I had with Hannah was her trying to kill Deb and just coming between Dexter and his only remaining family. I (like most people here) thought Lumen would've been the best for him to stay with after saving her, opening up to her about everything, and including her in his ritual."

Dexter,2jxsb1,rqk811,1 point,Wed Oct 22 09:49:23 2014 UTC,"i liked hannah. aside from rita, lumen was my favourite of dexter's women.  i did enjoy lila aside from using her to kill doakes."
Dexter,2jxsb1,peacecake,2,Wed Oct 22 01:54:49 2014 UTC,Lila is better because she went away more quickly.  Although killing Doakes was a really cheap way for the writers to take that decision from Dexter.

Dexter,2jynmf,skylerw,5,Wed Oct 22 04:06:30 2014 UTC,"Oh god, just wait for Hannibal.  I was like literally the biggest Dex fan, even defending the finale from a year ago.   I was never into any of the Silence of the Lambs or Hannibal stories at all, and got into Hannibal on a whim being so bummed that Dexter was over.  I was instantly hooked. Hannibal makes Dexter look like an autistic child. Dont get me wrong, still love Dex, and you really cant compare the shows, but Hannibal is fucking beyond epic.  I implore everyone here to start watching it immediately. IF you start on an episode a night, you'll finish the series so far in a month, and be ready for Season 3, which is going to be fucking insane.  OK, I'm done. Just be ready to be quoting a new favourite.... ""When the fox hears the rabbit scream, he comes running.... but not to help."""
Dexter,2jynmf,dickdarkstar,5,Wed Oct 22 04:28:26 2014 UTC,"""There is no god.""  ""Not with that attitude.""  Love Hannibal."

Dexter,2jynmf,Szcynergy,3,Thu Oct 23 03:20:37 2014 UTC,"Yes, Hannibal is a fantastic show.  The writing is good, the acting is good, the cinematography is GREAT, but what really sets it apart to me from other network shows is their ability to push the envelope.  The shit I have seen on Hannibal is nothing close to anything really they ever showed on Dexter.  Not just gore (although a lot of gore), but also just general crazy ass shit.  That being said, if you are a fan of the Hannibal series (Silence of the Lambs, Red Dragon, Hannibal), you will like the show even more.  They embody all of the main characters from the past movies, and even continue with very similar storylines.  It is an incredibly interesting adaptation of the whole Hannibal Lecter genre, and I would also highly recommend it."

Dexter,2jynmf,Chiveronreddit,1 point,Wed Oct 22 12:56:47 2014 UTC,Comparing the last episode of Dexter with Oxymandias is a big no no.
Dexter,2jynmf,BlackCatScott,1 point,Fri Oct 24 12:43:51 2014 UTC,"If Breaking Bad ended on Ozymandias, it would have been fine if they wrote in conclusions Jesse and Skyler's stories.  Dexter's ending wasn't bad due to the lumberjack bit, it was awful because the collective season 8 was such a waste of something that should have been so much different.  All of the contrivances, mistreatment and betrayal of characters amounted to nothing redeemable in any circumstance.  I actually like the fact that Dexter didn't die or ride into the sunset, that he must endure his formerly longed-for isolation at a time when he wanted it least.  He lives in misery.  That is the part of the ending I liked.  Deb dying off screen while CGI tornadoes raged through a CGI hurricane, I did not."
Dexter,2jynmf,_rattlesnake,1 point,Wed Oct 22 04:28:06 2014 UTC,"My frustration with season 8 stems from the fact that it had SO much potential.  They built up all this tension leading to the end of S7, then they basically just reset it and said ""everything is basically normal except Deb is depressed.""  Even then, she gets better... Wtf.  Imagine if they had opened S8 right where S7 left off... The first half of the season was Dexter trying to cover up what happened.  Mid season his bubble bursts, and it's an all out man hunt.  Maybe he ""escapes"" and ends up in the same place.  Maybe Deb gets caught and does jail time.  I don't know, but the series had huge potential for an insanely nerve racking last season.  Unfortunately, the actual last season was pretty boring.  A few new characters that all die without even giving us a chance to get attached.  Masuka's daughter... Wtf was that!?  The whole thing was just so boring.  Also the actual execution of the final episode was just horrid.  Why were the waters perfectly calm before a hurricane.  How in the fuck would he just walk out to his boat with a body?  So much potential just wasted..."
Dexter,2jynmf,GDIBass,0,Wed Oct 22 07:35:04 2014 UTC,"I actually found it similar to Ozymandias in Breaking Bad.    ludicrous.    If BB had ended there, I'm sure the reviews would have been horrible as well.   asinine."
Dexter,2jxf6p,LiquidAsylum,19,Tue Oct 21 21:19:22 2014 UTC,"Everyone has a different reason.   Some people expected that he will get caught/killed/revealed and were unsatisfied with the actual outcome. Some people wanted him to get away and start over with Hannah and Harrison and were unsatisfied with the actual outcome. Some people (including me) didn't really have that much of a problem with the finale, since the ideas presented there weren't all that bad, but were disappointed with the final season in general, since the events leading up to the finale (and the execution of said ideas) were poor to say the least. Some people were outraged by the 'convenient writing' reaching a whole new level in the finale, for example no-one giving a fuck about Deb dieing at the ICU ward and the subsequent snatching of her corpse from the hospital. And finally, some people just hate the lumberjack thing.   I think that basically covers most of the possibilities. :)"
Dexter,2jxf6p,TheHellFish,7,Tue Oct 21 22:12:08 2014 UTC,"I've always liked the finale. I like how it turned out that Debra is Dexter's last kill. He ended up having to kill the person that he's always loved and who was his link to 'humanity'.  It wasn't the ending I expected, but I liked it."
Dexter,2jxf6p,boomerhfp,2,Tue Oct 21 22:45:58 2014 UTC,I think a lot of the hate is due to the fact that the last few minutes of the finale completely undo everything that the season had been building up to.
Dexter,2jxf6p,phuckdolphins,-4,Wed Oct 22 02:02:03 2014 UTC,I think people just wanted a more cliche or happy ending and got really upset when they went a completely different route.
Dexter,2jxf6p,joethejoe222,6,Thu Oct 23 04:44:40 2014 UTC,"Deb didn't have to die .. That was cheep. Just to make her his ""last kill"" was a poor ending for her character. She was far more meaningful than that."
Dexter,2jxf6p,frellus,8,Wed Oct 22 02:19:52 2014 UTC,"I had no issue with Deb being Dexter's ""last kill"", rewatching the series there was alot of forshadowing that that would be the climax of Deb and Dex's relationship. What I cant forgive was how Dexter takes her corpse and tosses her in the ocean to be buried in a sea of killers. That was just a deplorable action on Dexter's part taking away any meaningful farewell to Deb and the other characters of the show."
Dexter,2jxf6p,Hero4ever,1 point,Fri Oct 24 02:05:10 2014 UTC,"I thought it wouldve been more ridiculous if Deb didnt die, after all that happened because of Dexter, there wasn't going to be a a happy ending for anyone involved."
Dexter,2jxf6p,Mrhiddenlotus,6,Sat Oct 25 03:12:11 2014 UTC,"It wasn't so much the episode, just the season in general lacked any direction and at times seemed more like fan fiction (especially the 180 from Hannah)."
Dexter,2jxf6p,duckwantbread,4,Tue Oct 21 23:33:26 2014 UTC,"It didn't lack direction. Season 8 was heading head-long into a brick wall of confusing character development. Up until pretty much the last episode, they were setting up for him to become 'normal', then said ""FUCK IT"" at the last minute."
Dexter,2jxf6p,venn177,3,Thu Oct 23 12:29:27 2014 UTC,"Well, aside from what everyone else in this thread said (poor lazy writing, plot holes, etc.), I was stunned by the lost potential of the final episodes.  I love Dexter and would hate to see him executed, but it honestly would have been riveting if everyone that knew him found out his secrets. Imagine the reaction of Matthews, Batista, Jamie, etcetera, and then imagine how thrilling it would've been had he been on the run from those closest to him. Each of these characters, as a whole and individually, would have had to make some hard decisions.  Again, I love Dexter the character and the show, but he should not have gotten away with everything that he did. He screwed up way too many times and I was really expecting the whole Miami PD to come down on him. Ffs, they had already mentioned GPS tracking on phones, but then they easily got away with La Guerta's murder.  Just my two cents."
Dexter,2jxf6p,thealienelite,2,Sun Nov 2 04:36:10 2014 UTC,"I hated it because Hannah, I was so mad when she came back."
Dexter,2jxf6p,Caps-Unlocked,2,Tue Oct 21 23:15:07 2014 UTC,"I hate that, after everything, the other characters like Angel get pushed to the side at the end and aren't given any real ending."
Dexter,2jxf6p,mguniverse,5,Sun Nov 2 07:04:19 2014 UTC,"It was spoiled for me but I saw it anyway.  It wasn't not what I expected.  It was exactly what I wanted.  Not a big bang, but a silent whimper... a walk into darkness from which there is no return.  The loss of everything you ever loved, everyone who ever cared for you.  Some wanted to see him behind bars.  Some wanted him killed.  Some wanted to see him executed by the state.  But none of them compared to the true punishment reserved for our anti-hero.  It was hell.  The ending, was Dexter going to living hell."
Dexter,2jxf6p,oh_no_aliens,4,Tue Oct 21 22:00:26 2014 UTC,"Read older posts, it's been described very well."
Dexter,2jxf6p,Slaytounge,3,Tue Oct 21 21:23:30 2014 UTC,"Because some people didn't get the ending they wanted, and they're mad about it. They either wanted Dexter to be caught and executed, which I think would be a great ending too, or Dexter living happily ever after with Harrison and Hannah, something that wouldn't even fit with the type of show Dexter is. Not saying those are the only two endings people wanted, and that there are other aspects of the ending or what lead up to it that is critiqued, but I hope this helped out."
Dexter,2jxf6p,Brusah,0,Tue Oct 21 21:25:25 2014 UTC,The whole final season was just laughably bad and terribly written. Seeing the final payoff to go along with the terrible season just made it worse.
Dexter,2jxf6p,Bleafer,0,Tue Oct 21 23:41:23 2014 UTC,"It was really the ridiculousness of it all. Of course, the premise of Dexter is quite crazy as it is, but the show was always grounded in some loose sense of reality. The final episode turned that entirely on its head. In what universe would Dexter be able to ""sneak"" Deb out of a hospital in plain sight of most of the hospital staff? That seems very nitpicky, but I look at that as just plain lazy writing. The writers ignored any sense of plausibility just to move the plot along. Pretty much sums up the last season -- lazy.  Then, to cap it off, we find out that Dexter didn't die in the hurricane (Surprise!... Straight out of a campy soap opera). Honestly, the finale wouldn't have left such a bad taste in my mouth if they didn't have the final scene be a grizzled Dexter as a lumberjack. That scene just felt tacked on as if the writer's were going for a ""thought-provoking"" ending. Once again, lazy writing.   I honestly enjoyed the show through must of its run (even after season 4), but the final season was a train wreck from about episode four or five onwards. Lazy, cliche writing everywhere."
Dexter,2jxf6p,jettj14,-2,Tue Oct 21 22:02:34 2014 UTC,"Based on your attitude I'm not sure you watched it. Double check, make sure you actually watched the last episode. Once you discover that you havent seen it, watch it and then come back and tell me what you thought."

Dexter,2jwg8w,FoxIslander,13,Tue Oct 21 19:03:40 2014 UTC,I've said it many times but: The death of Rita marked the decline is what was a very well written show IMO.
Dexter,2jwg8w,pfool,4,Tue Oct 21 17:32:26 2014 UTC,"It wasn't Rita's death that specifically ruined the show, that's just coincidentally when the original showrunner left."
Dexter,2jwg8w,venn177,2,Thu Oct 23 12:30:08 2014 UTC,"I totally agree. Rita was my favorite character because she was written with the most depth on the show; she was an excellent dramatic and occasionally comic partner for Dexter, so she was often at the center of the show's finer intense and humorous moments. I said back when it happened that I thought her death was largely unnecessary and damaged the show's future promise."
Dexter,2jwg8w,PessimisticCheer,5,Wed Oct 22 21:48:12 2014 UTC,Season 5 could have been done differently to wrap up the show and end it there in my opinion. I'm gonna pretend it ended about 3 minutes before the final episode in season 5.
Dexter,2jwg8w,phuckdolphins,5,Tue Oct 21 17:54:45 2014 UTC,"I think the writers forgot what was so interesting about the show. The look into the mind of a serial killer was just so fascinating, has the show goes on and becomes a soap opera love story, the show just falls apart.  The humanizing of Dexter Morgan was the death of Dexter IMO"
Dexter,2jwg8w,r3nagade,5,Tue Oct 21 20:17:43 2014 UTC,I thought it was awesome seeing someone so twisted become a person.
Dexter,2jwg8w,gtaguy12345,5,Tue Oct 21 21:31:06 2014 UTC,The show was great at first but it just went on a downward spiral once they killed off Sgt. Doaks. After that plot line it felt like it was a steady decline.

Dexter,2j95lw,Nebakanezzer,2,Wed Oct 15 01:43:20 2014 UTC,yes
Dexter,2j95lw,BroomPerson21,16,Wed Oct 15 00:31:41 2014 UTC,Fuck no
Dexter,2j95lw,coffeeandmuffins,7,Wed Oct 15 01:54:11 2014 UTC,"yes, but people are disagreeing with you because you're not giving them enough of a pitch. people still have a bad taste in their mouths from how those characters have been written in the past, so you have to reinvent them.  the ideal way to segue this from dexter would be an alternate ending to dexter in the first episode as a brief re-imagining and introduction. bullet points. zack never dies. dexter is instructing zack on the code. they plan to use some of his funds in the move to france/argentina/wherever start over as a family unit with hannah, zack, and harrison. shit goes wrong. they get split up at the airport, dexter and zack almost get caught. hannah has to continue on with the plan and flee with harrison, they expect to meet up with the others later. shit goes even more wrong. dexter and zack are nationwide fugitives, the BHB case breaks open, zacks murders come out, a bunch of information from Vogul's files get leaked some way or another and the cat is out of the bag. they are on the run. two teams of killers sent in two different directions, with two different goals.  dexter and zack head south and try to cross the border into mexico, to make their way to a south american country where they will not easily be hunted down, extradited, or exposed for the murders they continue to do. zack's money helps fund this adventure, as dexter teaches him more about the code, discipline, the things he learned as a forensics analyst, etc. He realizes as he guides zack through hunting/picking kills, and eventually the kill process itself, that his dark passenger begins to shrink. his need is less and less as he watches zack grow into a more refined, controlled, precise killer. he is living vicariously through his spiritual/adopted son. in time, the torch will pass, and he can live a normal life with hannah and harrison, guiding zack from the sidelines, taking harry's position. but how to get to hannah and harrison?  meanwhile, elsewhere, hannah and harrison are surviving on her ex-husbands money, and desperately trying to find contact with dexter and zack (to no avail) without giving away either their location, or her's and harrison's. harrison is also getting older, and as such, begins to remember things about his childhood, particularly a dark night in a bathroom sitting on the floor covered in blood. the class hamster at school goes missing and is found days later in another classes janitorial closet, in the sink, throat slit, floating in its own blood. as dexter tries to teach zack the ways of harry's code, hannah is struggling to NOT have to do the same with harrison (unsuccessfully). as time goes by, his urges worsen, and he eventually targets people. hannah and harrison now must move often, and it's getting harder and harder for them to throw money at the problem and cover up their pasts. the viewers are given the idea they may be being tracked from country to country as too many coincidences have arisen the suspicion of inter-government agencies.  people from the past come out of the wood work to track down dexter and zack. a colleague of lundy, a newly pissed off, motivated, and now hotshot CIA agent joseph quinn, ill-tempered loose canon bounty hunters, mexican drug cartels, and well paid highly trained mercenaries to name a few.  can both teams outrun and outsmart the forces after them? how will the two teams meet up and reunite as a family again? can they hide forever? will dexter accept harrison as he is now? will harrison accept dexter as the new hands off mentor to zack, or his disapproval of his own actions? how will they live a somewhat normal life with several active killers working together?"
Dexter,2j95lw,lopey986,12,Wed Oct 15 05:44:16 2014 UTC,Holy shit no
Dexter,2j95lw,coffeeandmuffins,13,Wed Oct 15 02:33:57 2014 UTC,"Harrison and Hannah ruined Dexter, so no."
Dexter,2j95lw,lopey986,8,Wed Oct 15 00:37:23 2014 UTC,"I thought introducing the Hannah theory was... Intriguing. He had Lila whom he thought he shared a connection with, but she didn't really get him at all and was just a psycho bitch. He had Miguel who he thought he shared a connection with, but he ended up just wanting to use dexter to his advantage. The character played by Mos Def had the most potential of them all but was wasted and killed off so quickly, same with the British dude who was, again, wasted and killed off quickly. Introducing someone like Hannah who was possibly the same as Dexter could have been extremely intriguing if handled well, unfortunately it just turned into ""Dexter might be cured because he's in love... Or something"".   Then again, I thought the debra being IN LOVE with Dexter was a good, weird, fucked up place to take the show, but they just half-assed it and basically white washed it after a few episodes."
Dexter,2j95lw,venn177,3,Wed Oct 15 15:33:30 2014 UTC,"I didn't hate Hannah right away. I think they could have done that entire storyline much, much better. I really wanted the Deb being in love with Dexter thing to pan out - I think it could have been really interesting. Instead, they were all ""haha this is like when you like M&Ms but shouldn't"" and then never talked about it again."
Dexter,2j95lw,nolson1211,3,Thu Oct 16 18:09:39 2014 UTC,"Deb tried to kill herself and dexter. I mean, that alone was extremely fucked up. Then all the sudden they did some therapy and voila! She's cured! It was such a waste."
Dexter,2j95lw,zmegadeth,2,Thu Oct 16 18:55:44 2014 UTC,"Hannah didn't ruin Dexter, they just kinda lost where they were going with her.  She definitely wasn't the best part of season 7, but I think this subreddit can mostly agree that season 7 was the best part of the second half."

Dexter,2j95lw,BlackCatScott,1 point,Wed Oct 15 03:02:26 2014 UTC,It's definitely something. The problem would be that they'd have to differentiate it from Dexter completely or it would feel far too familiar

Dexter,2j5fyi,gtaguy12345,1 point,Tue Oct 14 03:03:55 2014 UTC,For the video we managed to detach the music audio out of from the actual scene. We didn't use the soundtrack.

Dexter,2j6my9,jondonbovi,2,Thu Oct 16 00:13:50 2014 UTC,The final 5 episodes or so was thrilling. That's what people remember. Kind of like season 3 and season 4 of Breaking Bad.
Dexter,2j6my9,jondonbovi,0,Fri Oct 17 16:23:37 2014 UTC,"I'd say the only thrilling and good episodes from that season, more like scenes actually, were the thanksgiving scene, the hello dexter Morgan scene, and the final scene of the season finale  Breaking bads 3rd and 4th season had actually good episodes all throughout though"
Dexter,2j6my9,Khal-Stevo,1 point,Fri Oct 17 16:38:08 2014 UTC,Beginning of the 3rd and 4th seasons of Breaking Bad felt kind of slow to me. It had the same story line- Walt's rough marriage and Jesse's depression.

Dexter,2j6my9,PhantomTriforce,3,Wed Oct 15 03:42:31 2014 UTC,"Can you honestly explain why you think season 8 is better than 3 and 4, especially the finale being better than the finale of 4? I don't understand"
Dexter,2j6my9,jaycatt7,4,Tue Oct 14 22:42:21 2014 UTC,"I liked Vogel's plot and I thought season 8 was well-put together. The finale aside, I kept waiting for it to get boring like people said it would, and it never did. Both season 3 and season 4 tried to stretch a single idea too thin (season 3 with Prado and season 4 with Trinity). The plots for both seasons were so worn out by the end that I really didn't care what happened. Season 4 built up some real intensity and then it tried to carry that same intensity for multiple episodes. I lost interest by the end of the season.  As for the finales, season 8's ending made sense to me. I would have done it a bit differently, but it's the final episode of the show and I wasn't bothered much. If there were a season after it, then I might look at differently. Season 4's ending had no rhyme or reason. It wasn't just a plot twist; it was a punch in the plot that made no sense. I tried looking up info about why the writers went with it and it really sounded like bullshit to try to get the actress off the show. That was the worst writing the series ever received and the praise it gets is ridiculous to me."
Dexter,2j6my9,TheHellFish,4,Wed Oct 15 02:28:30 2014 UTC,"6th is in your top 3 and season 8 better than 4, either you have terrible taste or you're trolling"
Dexter,2j6my9,jaycatt7,2,Tue Oct 14 05:35:39 2014 UTC,"Thanks for posting this thread. I just finished watching the series tonight and really wanted some place to hash out the ending.   I didn't get what I wanted or expected. I went into the finale with one thing in mind: Deb and Harrison had to survive. And Dexter had to pay for his crimes with his life. That would be his redemption.  So much for that.  But in some ways they made good choices in the finale. Death isn't always logical or deserved. So Deb's awful fate was an intrusion of reality into Dexter's world of clean death. I can't decide if she deserved it or not: Deb is a fully developed moral person, unlike the almost inhuman Dexter, so she really is morally responsible for LaGuerta's death. But Deb is also a genuinely good person. If anybody deserved to die, it was Dexter. Of course what he got was worse: no quick, simple death, but an enduring lifetime of isolation and despair. That's pretty fucking grim. In many ways the tone of the ending didn't match the happy funny cop feel of the rest of the series.  One moment that seemed glorious, if improbably, was Dexter carrying Deb's body onto his boat, white shroud blowing in the breeze like a wedding dress.  That's fitting--Deb is Dexter's key relationship throughout the series. The ""carrying the bride over the threshold"" image also fits the recurring incest themes. But overall Deb is an innocent at the end. Only she gets dropped into the depths in white, of all his victims. She's the only one Dexter killed for mercy's sake, though he blames himself for her death. It's troubling that the writers chose to reward his act of mercy towards his would-be last victim and his newfound trust in the legal system with Deb's loss as a stroke from God.   It was a deeply unsatisfying ending... which is probably what the show deserved."
Dexter,2j6my9,Dream_Out_Loud,1 point,Tue Oct 14 15:43:53 2014 UTC,"That's more thought than I ever put into it. I came in having no wants or expectations. I generally find show finales to be the writers giving us their version of the ending, and in many shows that leads to disappointing or unsatisfying endings.  I like your analysis of it though. Never really thought about the symbolism of Dexter bringing Deb's body to the ocean."

Dexter,2j3lww,DiabloTheThird,12,Mon Oct 13 08:20:12 2014 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, trinity was planning his suicide before everyone's shift started (hence why people randomly showed up right after) but Dexter was curious and lonely and wanted to find out more about himself which is why he saved him last minute as oppose to making it look like a suicide.. if you haven't noticed, Dexter has a compulsive characteristic of needing to control the situations around him, even if that meant ""assisting"" in Trinitys' suicide.

It looked like clear kool-aid on camera. Also, I couldn't get an exact replica of Dexter's slide box, so I had a red one.

Dexter,2iudmo,Omnipraetor,48,Fri Oct 10 11:18:41 2014 UTC,"Ok, didn't clue in on that at all. Thanks man. Good catch OP."
Dexter,2iudmo,Foghorn225,-28,Fri Oct 10 11:41:40 2014 UTC,"Oh fucking fuck, this subreddit is retarded! I'm out"
Dexter,2iudmo,dasher11,39,Sat Oct 11 01:38:06 2014 UTC,"I dunno. It doesn't look like a cut, it just looks like smeared blood. It's plausible that you're correct and caught something many of us did not notice, or it could just be coincidence."
Dexter,2iudmo,Aguilareal13,9,Fri Oct 10 13:16:22 2014 UTC,"I'm sure it is smeared blood (I don't think Dexter was actually injured when his mom was killed), but that doesn't mean the symbolism isn't still there.   I don't think it's coincidence either.  A makeup artist did have to deliberately place that blood there."
Dexter,2iudmo,poopfeast,12,Sat Oct 11 00:19:46 2014 UTC,Most likely.

Dexter,2iudmo,samiam026,2,Sat Oct 11 13:24:49 2014 UTC,Tip of the cap to that child actor for a great facial expression. In this particular still you can almost see in his eyes how fucked up this is going to make him. How in an instant he changed.

Dexter,2iudmo,Bcarey1233,-3,Wed Oct 22 16:21:04 2014 UTC,I fail to see how this is related to Dexter's method of drawing blood from his victims other than coincidence.
Dexter,2iujer,Trenzo,10,Fri Oct 10 11:44:49 2014 UTC,"A child can't survive without water, but you're proposing that he survived by slurping up stale, hot, and dirty blood, with zero nutritional value, from the floor?"
Dexter,2iujer,ArchStanton27,8,Sat Oct 11 06:27:38 2014 UTC,"zero nutritional value   The nutritional value of blood is non-zero.  There are about 450 calories in a half-liter.  You won't be healthy consuming blood in the long term, but it might keep you alive.  The Maasai and some Inuit both consome raw blood (from cows and seals respectively).  There are issues with coagulation and accessibility that I'm wondering about, though.  Would he be scraping large quantities of congealed or partially congealed blood off of the floor to eat?  Is that even possible?  I'm not sure what a large amount of blood does after a day, for example."
Dexter,2iujer,Deradius,2,Sat Oct 11 14:29:02 2014 UTC,Well I guess that you have a point there haha
Dexter,2iujer,_rattlesnake,11,Sat Oct 11 13:16:54 2014 UTC,"I like your theory, makes sense.  Thought if that was responsible for his blood obsession, don't you think he would have added blood-drinking to his ritual?"
Dexter,2iujer,awesomeman77,3,Fri Oct 10 16:15:32 2014 UTC,"No I don't think so. Drinking blood is not good for your health and Dexter, knowing a lot about blood and the human body, would not do that. At least that's what I think."

Dexter,2iujer,qwedswerty,3,Sun Oct 12 03:43:55 2014 UTC,"I'm going to say that they're is good answer for this. I honestly don't think that Dexter would have ended up drinking the blood of his mother, that just doesn't seem to fit with the story that was told. I think the bottom line is that the writers didn't account for the idea that two days without food or water would probably kill a three your old.  As such, I think that the most likely, and probably canon, answer is that Dexter and his brother did survive in a cargo container for two days with no food or water. It's certainly not absolutely impossible, so I think that's the most accurate and likely answer."
Dexter,2iujer,osfala,1 point,Mon Oct 13 04:55:24 2014 UTC,"Interesting idea!  Maybe it was raining that day in the show. Afterall there is no serial killer named Dexter working for the real Miami police department. (I hope atleast, that'd be a pretty big oversight.) Things such as weather are typically not exactly in line with reality in fiction stories. Still, 2 days does sound  like pretty much. Maybe it is also closer to one day? Like them getting killed in the night and found in the morning.  Also, wouldn't blood clot in that time frame?  If we're going to assume that Dexter did drink water, I think that there would be blood all over his face. I don't understand how they are not completely covered in clotted blood when they were found to be honest. Maybe a case of making things a little bit more dramatic and pretty than ""reality""? I hadn't really thought of it before, so I don't mind too much."

Dexter,2ilqjr,koreanpenguin,9,Wed Oct 8 21:18:03 2014 UTC,Did you know the original writers left after season 4? That's why the show seemed to change after that.   I can't remember who - the head writer I think said how he would of ended it was: for the final shot its zoomed way in on Dexters eyes. When he opens them the camera slowly pans out and around the room and hes strapped to a a chair about to be executed by the state. Everyone he's ever killed and all his friends are standing around watching and we the audience realize everything we just watched was Dexter's life flashing before his eyes before the state executed him.
Dexter,2ilqjr,drdingo,2,Thu Oct 9 00:13:33 2014 UTC,Did they film this at all or was it just written? That'd be fucking awesome
Dexter,2ilqjr,Yeo0,-1,Sun Oct 12 01:29:28 2014 UTC,"that ending >>> this ending, I cant fully blame this team of writers tho, because its impossible to keep the steam up for 8 seasons especially by how the tone was set for the first 4, and after so many character changes the show just isnt the same anymore. I was watching season 1 episodes the other day and just seeing newbie Deb and the rest of the crew made me realise what i disliked about the last couple of seasons, Deb was a newbie on the force and her growing into the role and her innocence was so good to watch, she got too fucked up too fast. Dexter  was funny awkward and was truly different now hes just mr oh you got a problem Deb, Hannah or Vogel ill come to the rescue. And eventho Rita dying was such a ""good point of the show"" it also is conflicting since you dont want Dexter to be with anybody else but at the same time you want Dexter to be happy. And ofc that you spend 4 seasons with Astor and Cody and then theyre gone."
Dexter,2ilqjr,shebendstheboxes,3,Fri Oct 10 16:21:12 2014 UTC,"I just finished Dexter and I could not agree with you more.  I am so fucking annoyed that they killed Deb, and the whole lumberjack thing was ridiculous.  The best part about the Finale was when Hannah gave the bounty hunter a shot of tranquilizer on the bus.  I liked how Dexter took out Daniel Vogle too, it was pretty badass for him to do it in the police station.  All the drama with Deb was completely unnecessary.  If they really wanted to go that route they should have had Dexter just carelessly drive himself and Deb's body into the hurricane on his boat FOR REAL.  Then they both could have died and that would be that.  It pisses me off that Harrison and Hannah are out there and Dexter is just fucking chopping down trees what the actual fuck?"
Dexter,2ilqjr,rollingintheshallow,2,Wed Oct 8 06:55:29 2014 UTC,yeah it feels so dissatisfying knowing that Dexter was the worst father ever and now he just left his son even if its with good intentions.
Dexter,2ilqjr,Malreg,3,Wed Oct 8 22:41:56 2014 UTC,Also the Cuban music and the atmosphere in the earlier seasons is what made it so much better..

I was horrified when Rita was killed and even more so when deb died."

Dexter,2ifoqw,DiabloTheThird,21,Mon Oct 6 10:09:46 2014 UTC,"I dont think So.  I think he has a feeling that something is wrong with Dex. He does not know what - it is more of a gut feeling.  when he gets to see him at the NA meeting - this gives doakes a viable reason why he gets a wierd/bad vibe from Dex.  At this point, I do not think there is any link to Ice truck etc."
Dexter,2ifoqw,FoolsErrend,2,Mon Oct 6 10:21:10 2014 UTC,Doakes literally directly says that he knows he's linked to the Ice Truck Killer.
Dexter,2ifoqw,FoolsErrend,4,Mon Oct 6 10:27:04 2014 UTC,in that episode?  I did not recall  him saying that then - will check it out tonight.
Dexter,2ifoqw,qwedswerty,2,Mon Oct 6 10:34:35 2014 UTC,"Either that one or the one directly before it, yes."
Dexter,2ifoqw,silviod,5,Mon Oct 6 10:36:41 2014 UTC,"He has certainly said it several times up to the point where OP is at. He mentions it several times in Season 1, in the final episode of that season he says it atleast twice that I can remember; once when Doakes and Laguerta visits him at home, and once after the resolution.  Doakes conviction that he's connected  to the Ice Truck killer leads to the famous Surprise Motherfucker scene btw."
Dexter,2ifoqw,eavesly,2,Mon Oct 6 12:28:03 2014 UTC,"I think his suspicion that Dex knew something about the ITK was more him just trying to land on something - a hunch, as others have said, that he hoped would work. Nothing came from it except the fact that Dexter was somehow marvelous in a fight and the little he dug up about Dexter (""What does a lab geek like you need to know jujitsu for?"" - not verbatim quote) and finding out about Dex's apparent drug addiction quelled that. He probably thought, ""Oh shit, he wasn't connected to the ITK case, he's just a junkie!""  Anyway, OP, keep watching. Doakes ain't as stupid as you're thinking."
Dexter,2ifoqw,qwedswerty,7,Mon Oct 6 22:04:10 2014 UTC,"I guess it's a bit of military and police interrogations training. Doakes says it with certainty to elicit a reaction in Dexter. Doakes is following the aggressive approach to a confession by attrition. Doakes will stay on Dexter purporting to know all his secrets so Dexter will feel the breath on the back of his neck, so to speak, and that pressure will cause him to crack. Doakes relentlessly suspects and accuses Dexter but that's a ruse; he starts tailing Dexter to uncover something he can use to get Dexter in an interrogation room. Instead, Doakes, who knows he's bluffing about the Ice Truck Killer connection, feels foolish just long enough to believe that Dexter is a junkie. It's simpler than any other theory he was chasing and it explains quite a lot. But Doakes never really dropped his hunch, did he?"
Dexter,2ifoqw,Aguilareal13,10,Mon Oct 6 16:58:29 2014 UTC,"Doakes certainly has other suspicions aswell, but Doakes isn't 100% logical. He connects NA with other things that make Dexter weird. He also explains that he has seen a lot of cops going down the addict road and has mental problems himself, which causes him to suddenly realise that maybe he has been witch-hunting and suddenly strikes up sympathy for Dexter. These are all hunches, and hunches are never exact.   In Doake's mind, the main part of why he dislikes Dexter is realising that there's something wrong with him. Now he realises that this thing that is wrong with Dexter is drug addiction, and so all of the other ideas follow along, he wouldn't have seen them anyway if he didn't already hate Dexter to begin with. Notice that no one else seems to notice these things, even though they have just as much information as Doakes on a logical plane."

I was really just waiting for Dexter to be revealed to everyone, I know the directors didn't want that because it's predictable but my 2 favorite moments of the whole series were when doax says 'you're the bay harbor butcher!?' and when Deb sees Dex doing a kill in the church, I'm pretty gutted there wasn't some sort of big finale with everyone finding out about Dexter.  But holy shit 8 seasons and that's what I'm left with? No happy ending (which I would have liked) and you're right the whole story arc towards the end was just shut down in the last scene which really is bullshit.   Man there are countless different ways it could have ended, the one they chose was just so underwhelming."

But then when he tossed the cell phone in the water and I knew he was going to ride off into the storm, I was like ""why the fuck did this entire redemption season happen?"" Just like you've asked.   I don't get it man. And then to throw that last scene in where he's actually alive, but we don't know if he's killing again or just going on in life... It's just.... Well as you say:  WHAT THE FUCK?

Dexter,2hyrf7,Slaytounge,14,Wed Oct 1 06:27:41 2014 UTC,"people like to regurgitate the same opinions they hear/read.   Season five and lumen worked well. It was interesting and exciting. I don't like Julia as an actress, but her character brought something to the series that was very needed and her dynamic with Dexter was new and it worked well. Most of the other female characters were annoying and didn't fit. Julia also ended up doing a pretty good job IMO, and again, I'm not a fan.   I personally thought three was shit. the whole season focused around miguel and his family, then the end of the season drags along as they try to shoehorn this skinner bullshit in the end. Ramone was also a cookie cutter shit character. it would have been interesting to keep miguel alive as an ally. maybe someone who just approves of what dexter is doing, but doesn't get personally involved. it would make more sense that Dexter is able to successfully evade police and being found out with the help of an ADA, and it could also make some of his kills easier."
Dexter,2hyrf7,Nebakanezzer,4,Wed Oct 1 08:32:49 2014 UTC,"Don't trivialize other people's opinion that conflict with yours by saying they are simply regurgitating.

Dexter,2hyrf7,iamnotimportant,6,Wed Oct 1 20:02:22 2014 UTC,"I LOVE season 5. I think that Episode 6 of this season ""Everything Is Illumenated"" is the best episode of the entire series. I like that the season focuses more on Lumen's struggles than Dexter's and I think that even though Jordan Chase wasn't the BIG BAD we had come to expect from the first 4 seasons it was an apt villain for Lumen.  My only problem, and I think the biggest problem lots of people had with Season 5 is the ending. It was a lazy, network meddled ending that hit a big fat reset button on everything and turned what could've been an amazing season into simply filler."
Dexter,2hyrf7,Nothox,4,Wed Oct 1 17:47:06 2014 UTC,"Yes the fucking ending, they should've just not cast Julia Stiles if she wasn't going to stick around for more than one season, her character disappearing like that was a big middle finger in an otherwise wonderful season."

I watch Lumen, Viktor, and Hannah scenes (especially season 7). Season 4 was fine, but maybe it was overhyped for me, I never think about rewatching it.  Looking at what I wrote, I would say these characters were more interesting/complex than the trinity killer as they all had LIGHT and dark aspects to them, trinity only had dark."

Dexter,2hx9v0,Kracker5000,17,Tue Sep 30 20:30:45 2014 UTC,"Not a bad argument. Obviously almost everyone has a predisposed dislike for Season 8, but you made some good points, and it was definitely a satisfying kill despite how much of a chore it was to get through the final season.  I thought Saxon was kind of a lame villain in a way, only because I thought the final season should have had the greatest villain yet, but he definitely got under my skin. The final two (or three) seasons were more of an internal struggle for Dex rather than taking down evil killers. Wrestling with his conscience (Harry) regarding his personal life which was once his mask, but now something he valued, whether or not the Dark Passenger really existed, etc.  I go back season by season thinking which ""big bad"" could be more satisfying but it isn't easy. The satisfaction of killing Trinity was taken away once we see that he had already got to Rita and Dexter acted too late. Doakes was obviously an annoyance, but personally I loved his character and the second time around I felt bad that he had to die. Brian Moser, Miguel Prado, George King (The Skinner), Jordan Chase, and Travis Marshall are the other big names off the top of my head, but none of them stand out in my mind as the most satisfying.  Definitely a good topic and argument and you might just be right."
Dexter,2hx9v0,murphymac,3,Tue Sep 30 20:55:34 2014 UTC,IMO Prado was the best take down due to all of the anger.
Dexter,2hx9v0,Unwanted_Commentary,11,Wed Oct 1 01:29:37 2014 UTC,"Saxon was not worthy of being the final boss of Dexter. Not even close to Trinity, or even Jordan Chase, the ""anti-Dexter."""

Dexter,2hx9v0,Unwanted_Commentary,4,Wed Oct 1 01:30:59 2014 UTC,Sigh. Now I want to rewatch the damn show.

Dexter,2hx9v0,gambit61,5,Wed Oct 1 05:37:22 2014 UTC,"I'm in the minority that I didn't hate the whole season, and with the exception of the last minute and a half, didn't hate the ending. Saxon was over the top, and kind of shitty, but his death was fantastic. It worked well, in my opinion, because he got to do out in the open what he had been hiding from everyone for years. AND GET AWAY WITH IT.   And it wasn't that Batista and Quinn suspected him of being a psychopathic killer; it was that they saw a man, whose sister was just viciously attacked to the point of being brain dead, take revenge. And they couldn't blame him. They wanted to do it, too. Deb was one of them; a police officer, a detective. Family. They let him do it, and made up an excuse (self-defense!) so that he knew they were behind him. To me, that's what made it the most satisfying kill."
Dexter,2hx9v0,darkdenizen,1 point,Wed Oct 1 05:04:44 2014 UTC,"Just burned through the series for the first time....and I'm still reeling from the ending.  I agree. The last season isn't as bad as what I was told to expect. The worst part is that none of the mini-arcs they set up ever amounted to anything. They could have done anything for the entire season and ended up with the same conclusion. There was no build up and the ending feels completely removed from any ""progress"" that season presented."
Dexter,2hx9v0,deadhead6391,5,Sat Oct 4 06:30:43 2014 UTC,"When he said ""I'm going to kill you with this pen"" I felt it was like a metaphor for the slap in the face the final season was to every person watching it for the past 8 years. Also, yeah I kind of agree with your point when you put it that way."
Dexter,2hx9v0,ratbastid,6,Tue Sep 30 22:35:37 2014 UTC,"Totally. While the actual kill was a good moment, it was immediately overshadowed by Batista and Quinn reviewing the footage and shrugging.   ""You killed him good der, Dex. Iss almos like you're a psychopathic killing machine."" ""Yeah. Almost.... WELL case closed!"""
Dexter,2hx9v0,duckwantbread,3,Wed Oct 1 02:28:01 2014 UTC,"Meh Quinn seems like the kind of guy who would want revenge for Deb's death and Dexter is one of Batista's best friends so I can understand why they looked the other way, Dexter killing one guy that he had a clear vendetta against wouldn't really give much indication that he is the Bay Harbor Butcher, Miami Metro deals with murders for personal reasons all the time."
Dexter,2hx9v0,peacecake,2,Wed Oct 1 23:08:19 2014 UTC,It didn't strike me that way.  The way the writing of the show and all the characters fell apart in 8 made me not really care what happened.
Dexter,2hx9v0,veintisiete,2,Tue Sep 30 22:57:18 2014 UTC,"I know, but come on. The death of the secondary character in the show didn't strike any sort of nerve?"
Dexter,2hx9v0,StillPersonal,5,Wed Oct 1 00:14:17 2014 UTC,"No no, I don't find anything satisfying about him. I agree that he was a bad character (as were a lot of characters introduced in Season 8). What I found satisfying was his death. If anything, getting pleasure from his death shows my hate for him."

Dexter,2hu0y0,gtonizuka,3,Mon Sep 29 22:45:12 2014 UTC,"A) It's a TV show… so, take that into consideration. B) It was an emergent situation so that could explain it.  Although, as one who works in a hospital, I know there is strict protocol that would dictate how things would work in such a situation and it would not be nearly as chaotic as the TV show would make it seem (See A for further explanation)."
Dexter,2hu0y0,bigbabybeluga,2,Tue Sep 30 00:21:50 2014 UTC,"I actually watched it with a 4th year medical student I was living with who had never seen an episode of Dexter before, so he was quite unbiased. He walked in the door when the hospital scenes were happening and just remarked about several different things that were complete bs. The main one was that a hospital in Florida on the water was incredibly unprepared for a hurricane, cause those never happen in Florida aparently. They let a guy walk out with a dead body in his arms and a disconnected heart monitor alarmed no one, it was all complete crap and a great example of the lazy, hurried writing of Season 8"
Dexter,2hu0y0,ShadowSora,1 point,Wed Oct 1 01:24:07 2014 UTC,Weren't there like a ton of people attending to the other harmed in the hurricane or something?
Dexter,2hu0y0,blue1748,1 point,Tue Sep 30 01:36:35 2014 UTC,That's what bugged you about Deb's role in the series finale?
Dexter,2hu0y0,_rattlesnake,1 point,Tue Sep 30 04:53:39 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I know it's a TV series, but it's a TV series that replicates real life moments. So if they're doing something, it should of been like it was in real life. I remember unplugging the hook up to all of my electrodes and the nurses ran into my room, short of breath and their desk was only 10 feet away from my ICU room, and this was during someone else having a code blue in the room next to me."
Dexter,2hu0y0,_rattlesnake,3,Tue Sep 30 05:35:17 2014 UTC,I'm not denying the legitimacy of your issue.  I just think it's a funny thing to focus on out of all of the horrendous writing-room decisions that went into Deb's fate.
Dexter,2hr9el,walterpinkman45,6,Mon Sep 29 03:25:02 2014 UTC,Because he got so focused on the revenge to get Dexter and didn't listen to George when he told Isaac to stop. So George turned on him with the rest of the brotherhood.
Dexter,2hr9el,froderick,2,Mon Sep 29 04:32:39 2014 UTC,"Isaac was above George in the hierarchy, but in his obsession with revenge he began to neglect Brotherhood business and let it fall to the wayside in pursuit of Dexter, which would hurt their profits and potentially endanger the organization if Sirko was ever caught by police in his quest for blood, since he could conceivably give them information in exchange for a deal."

Dexter,2hl7gp,stereoslams,5,Sat Sep 27 03:36:02 2014 UTC,After season 4 it really seemed like Dexter had no responsibilities despite having a son.   Nobody questioned his 104 hour work week. Laguerta had a fuck ton of evidence against Dexter and Deborah but instead of presenting that she just goes off the deep end.
Dexter,2hl7gp,Zykium,3,Sun Sep 28 23:13:24 2014 UTC,"I loved all of the seasons. It sucks when Rita died,  but the storyline was so good and you never knew what was going to happen. That could be why some people hated it, but I enjoyed it."
Dexter,2hl7gp,Leighanneee,7,Sat Sep 27 12:12:49 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure people necessarily hate the later seasons, it's just that they can't hold a candle to the first 4, particularly 2 & 4.  For starters, there was no way in hell anyone could beat John Lithgow as the big bad. He was on another level.  Killing off Rita and essentially writing out Cody and Astor was a mistake IMO. It made for an incredible finale but, as with the big bad, they could never live up to it or outdo it later on.  Probably because of Rita, they lost their balls and grew too attached to their own characters moving forwards. More people in Dexter's life should have suffered because of him.  The writing in general really took a nosedive, too. Hannah just wandering into a packed hospital, and never bothering to take even the most basic steps to hiding her identity - dying and cutting her hair for starters - was infuriating to have to watch. Not to mention the number of halfbaked or just plain unresolved subplots and meaningless, tacked-on character 'development' like with Masuka.  The ending is another divisive subject. I liked it personally.  I still have a real soft spot for this show and still consider it one of the greatest shows ever, but I don't think anyone can say with a straight face that it didn't outstay its welcome."
Dexter,2hl7gp,opermonkey,7,Sat Sep 27 14:09:12 2014 UTC,"The writing was all over the place, inconsistent behaviors from characters, and asking us to watch with a large amount of ""suspension of disbelief."""
Dexter,2hl7gp,hysteria613,5,Sat Sep 27 03:59:34 2014 UTC,"I liked 5. But after that dexter starts to become more ""human"" and rarely even kills anybody. Gets kind of boring."
Dexter,2hl7gp,walterpinkman45,7,Sat Sep 27 15:18:32 2014 UTC,That's one of the things I enjoyed. I liked how he began to change and think spiritually and stuff. I thought the killing was getting a bit stale. But to each his own haha
Dexter,2hl7gp,welshwordman,6,Sat Sep 27 19:26:14 2014 UTC,"I personally loved every season. Even with all the hatred towards season 8, I really liked it."
Dexter,2hl7gp,darkdenizen,2,Sat Sep 27 04:03:40 2014 UTC,"Season 5 is certainly different, but I like it a lot. I don't like season 6, it felt like a waste of time all for the four seconds of the finale. After my first rewatch of season 7, I felt it was a rather good season and would've been the perfect story for the ending. It would've bookmarked the series nicely and I think Dexter would have a much better legacy with some. But 8 was truly a disaster. It wasn't good. I like 1-5 and 7."
Dexter,2hl7gp,iamdroppy,2,Sat Sep 27 17:36:20 2014 UTC,"I just burned through the entire series this past week and can definitely see why people prefer the first half. It felt a lot tighter.  That said I do like Season 5. I liked Lumen's character and appreciated that Dexter's need to recover from Rita's death. However I was pretty disappointed at how the show handled Astor and Cody. Without Rita I thought he would really have to think about dropping killing to focus on being a father, and later seasons even hinted at that idea. But nope, nothing changes.  Season 6 was alright as a stand alone thing. The major takeaway was that Harrison could be endangered by what Dexter does....but we learned that in Season 4 with Rita...apparently Dexter did not.  Season 7 showed a lot of promise. LaGuerta catching on to Dexter was something that needed to happen, especially leading up to the final season. Also meeting Hannah was a good way to have Dexter control his urges like when he first met Lila, focus on his family and avoid the cops.  Season 8 drops all that by trying to fill 12 episodes with the same hunt killer/kill them thing from before while teasing at a bunch of mini-arcs that are never resolved. Vogel feels important in the beginning but quickly loses interest. Masuka's daughter is..yeah. Hannah and Dexter make incredibly frustrating mistakes and all the ""plot driving"" characters are new people that no one cares about. Oliver was boring (seriously, his method of killing is beating people to death. Compare that to any of the other main antagonists), Elway's role should have been switched with Batista and the hunt should not have been about Hannah but DEXTER."
Dexter,2hl7gp,pearlz176,2,Sat Oct 4 06:59:16 2014 UTC,"I loved S05... S06 sucked at the ending, except by the last scene, and I really enjoyed S07/08. Well, I think it was because Rita died, and instead of he becoming more dark, it was the other way around... I miss every single season of Dexter. Don't ask me why."
Dexter,2hl7gp,nolka,0,Sat Sep 27 03:56:31 2014 UTC,"Seasons 7 and 8 were a little off, but I loved season 6!"
Dexter,2hl7gp,Nothox,1 point,Sat Sep 27 04:14:32 2014 UTC,Season 4 was brilliant and set a really high bar. Unfortunately the later seasons failed to deliver. From plotholes to plain ridiculous scenes.
Dexter,2hl7gp,jointed98,1 point,Sun Sep 28 13:10:37 2014 UTC,I wouldn't call Season 4 as a whole brilliant. John Lithgow saved this season.
Dexter,2hku3a,Gaughanzola,3,Sat Sep 27 00:45:48 2014 UTC,I would simply say he prefers his tea over anyone else' beer.
Dexter,2hku3a,heruskael,2,Sat Sep 27 01:01:20 2014 UTC,I understand now. For some reason I thought he was referring himself as dexter oolong instead of dexter Morgan. And that confused me. Now I see that he was referring to dexter oolong as a non existent tea that would resemble himself.   I am so slow sometimes. Haha
Dexter,2hku3a,hysteria613,3,Sat Sep 27 01:09:24 2014 UTC,"Don't feel bad, you just explained it and I still don't understand."
Dexter,2hku3a,dyingenglish,2,Sat Sep 27 15:29:53 2014 UTC,Oolong is a type of tea. I think he's basically saying that what he enjoys doing is literally darker. Sitting around and having a beer isn't his idea of fun.

Dexter,2haaw7,henrikali,21,Wed Sep 24 01:11:31 2014 UTC,"after the first 2 seasons of the tv show, i decided to hunt down the books. i found the first three at a used book store in town and frantically raced back home to get started.  you know how everyone says ' the book was so much better than the tv show or the movie?   not the case here, for me. i only read the first one, then gave all three away. the book was dry, dull, flat and boring. the tv show lets you see the inner thoughts and processes of a serial killer trying to cope with his dark passenger.  the book was about a whiny little bitch. to me, the book felt more like the thoughts of an angsty emo 16 year old high school girl than a serial killer.  if i'd read the book first, i would have never watched the tv show."
Dexter,2haaw7,thenagel,12,Wed Sep 24 03:52:20 2014 UTC,I agree. I think I've read like 5 of these books and the author just rinses and repeats the same formula every time. Laaaame
Dexter,2haaw7,whateverthatis,5,Wed Sep 24 04:35:05 2014 UTC,Dexter gets captured and saved EVERY TIME.. I mean seriously?
Dexter,2haaw7,Nothox,9,Wed Sep 24 11:19:32 2014 UTC,"The worst part for me was during a huge stretch of the books, Jeff Lindsay tried to make it some kind of psuedo-sci-fi nonsense with the dark passenger being an actual demonic entity.    The show does a much better job in making it a euphemism, instead of a presence that the story takes way too seriously.  It ruined the books for me, aside from the dry writing and wit.   Seasons 1-4 captured a much more interesting Dexter than Jeff Lindsay's version.  But without his novels, who knows if the show would have ever come to pass, in one form or another."
Dexter,2haaw7,vertigo1083,2,Wed Sep 24 12:09:22 2014 UTC,"To be honest I didn't really mind the fact that the dark passenger was the spawn of an ancient babylonian god, even if it was retarded and wasted the third book.  What bothered me the most was how stupid Dexter was, overlooking obvious things and getting always captured or outsmarted or framed by the antagonist."
Dexter,2haaw7,Nothox,1 point,Wed Sep 24 12:17:13 2014 UTC,"The way I read the book was firt in terms of it being a metaphore, then changing my mind to he must be schizofrenic, and then slowly realising that it's actually a fantasy book. Also a lot of things are very different concerning the characters, especially Dexter. From what I remember he doesn't even once use the show's trademark tranquilizers. He comes off as much more creepy in the books too. Oh, and the talks about full moon etc. But they have also kept in a lot of traits, like the love and sense of protection for children, dogs not liking him and him eating so much. I think the books are funny, like the descriptions of Doakes in the later books, etc, and the superagent Debra dates, but yeah, wouldn't really call it the same kind of top quality piece of art that the first seasons of Dexter is."
Dexter,2haaw7,qwedswerty,3,Wed Sep 24 18:24:09 2014 UTC,"The first book was AWFUL, the second book was GREAT. I said the exact same thing about the first! Someone had to tell me they got better before I would even try the second.   I started reading after the TV series, and the first book was a lot like the first season, so on top of it being bad it just drug on because I (thought I) knew what was going to happen.   Can't speak for the whole series though; I started school so the second was as far as I've gotten :("
Dexter,2haaw7,MastahShake_____2,1 point,Wed Sep 24 05:01:33 2014 UTC,"I liked the first book, mostly because it was pretty much season 1. I didn't know the other ones were so bad."
Dexter,2haaw7,nuggetinabuiscuit,5,Wed Nov 26 15:48:36 2014 UTC,"the books are okay. definitely not good enough to save the ending of the show. i read all the books in a row from first to last one after the other and the plots all sort of blend together for me now. by the end of the book series i was just going through the motions waiting for it to end.   all in all, not a terrible read for a big dex fan looking for a fix, but the books are not great literature and it definitely does not deliver the powerful ending that you would hope for such a memorable, dynamic character like dexter. the show at least offered closure of some sort (however awful it may have been), the books leave everything open-ended. maybe for another book?   So if youre dying for some dex then go for it, but dont have your hopes too high"
Dexter,2haaw7,eamuscatuli1908,2,Wed Sep 24 06:24:04 2014 UTC,Is it possible for the books to have a worse ending??

Dexter,2haaw7,Spider_Bear,1 point,Wed Sep 24 16:32:48 2014 UTC,I disagree. The comics are awful. Really lazy witting and poor story with dull predictable characters.   Marvel isn't the publisher I'd go to for mature subject matter.  It's got nothing on the show but might be more similar to the books.
Dexter,2haaw7,mrchainsaw361,1 point,Thu Sep 25 13:08:55 2014 UTC,"Already been said, but first 2 books are the best, but if you do continue, skip the third for the supernatural element that he dropped in the next book, and the one right before the latest book is also a good one to skip.   The story was pretty exciting, but he REALLY over did the stupid Rita-stuttering trope, and it was a fucking pain to read. Or just skip over the parts with her, and be ready for the ending to kind of suck.  I havent read the latest release one, but I believe Lindsay said on twitter that he's already given the next book to the publisher, but they decide when to release, so it isnt the last book."
Dexter,2haaw7,dickdarkstar,1 point,Thu Sep 25 03:46:31 2014 UTC,"Like most series, it goes downhill as it continues, but if you like the show a lot, go for it. I've read all of them so far (I believe there won't be anymore) and I thought the last one was terrible. I still read it though.   Like they said, I suggest at least reading the first 2/3 to see. If you're anything like me you'll finish the series just because it's been written."
Dexter,2h9idq,Bo-mance,34,Tue Sep 23 20:43:52 2014 UTC,it's just different to anything else really.  to be able to write a show where you are on the side of a serial killer and don't want him to get caught is amazing.
Dexter,2h9idq,mrleetyler,9,Tue Sep 23 22:20:41 2014 UTC,"It's like the perfect anti-hero dilemma. I can't believe it hasn't been done earlier. (It probably has, but, yeah.)"
Dexter,2h9idq,effman1,30,Tue Sep 23 22:43:40 2014 UTC,"I think it's the fact that everyone feels like they're hiding a part of themselves from other people. Everyone has a dark passenger on some level (obviously not as dark as Dexter's), and so we as viewers/readers sympathize with his character."
Dexter,2h9idq,venn177,5,Tue Sep 23 22:33:08 2014 UTC,This is very true.
Dexter,2h9idq,Khal-Stevo,22,Tue Sep 23 22:38:23 2014 UTC,"The humor. Holy shit, in the early seasons Dexter was as much a snarky asshole as he was a psychopathic killer. It was incredible."
Dexter,2h9idq,grenadia,38,Wed Sep 24 01:49:06 2014 UTC,"I really enjoyed how he didn't understand human emotions whatsoever, and watching him try and be human was fantastic... Which is one of 1000 reasons why the last season bothered me so much"
Dexter,2h9idq,Cookie1995,11,Tue Sep 23 22:04:23 2014 UTC,"This! Thank you.  I really enjoy how he tries to be authentic without really having anything to bring to the table, so to say ;); for example in season 3 episode 4, which ends with him prosposing to Rita in, what sort of is an authentic way, but the words he's saying are literally someone else's (rewatch the episode to understand better). I love that sort of paradoxical way in which the entire story of Dexter is told (there are ALOT more examples throughout the series, especially sesasons 1-4).  And as you say, these are just one of the endless reasons why to love Dexter as a show.  I really feel like I could write 1000 paragraphs on this subject... :)"
Dexter,2h9idq,alina_314,3,Tue Sep 23 22:20:48 2014 UTC,"I think what was really interesting about that proposal is that after he borrowed the words of someone else (I think it was taken from some crazy lady who killed a man she ""loved"" even though this person didn't even know who she was), he began to express his feelings for Rita in his own words. ""I never want to miss another pizza night again,"" etc. So it kind of shows how he does understand emotions regardless of whether he thinks he does"
Dexter,2h9idq,reggieLedoux26,5,Wed Sep 24 02:04:24 2014 UTC,"Sometimes I find myself acting in a certain way only because it's the way I'm supposed to act. The show made me question whether I was being true to myself, or acting the way I was supposed to or just hiding my true self."

Dexter,2h9idq,Balasarius,5,Wed Sep 24 04:35:44 2014 UTC,The fact that he does what we all dream of.  Taking out the trash.

Dexter,2h9idq,united1020,2,Wed Sep 24 01:11:26 2014 UTC,"Have you re-watched season 4 recently? That season really hasn't aged well, a lot of the problems that plagued upcoming seasons (horribly filmed Harry scenes, uninteresting side plots [batista and laguerta? yikes], captain obvious dexter inner monologues become a thing this season, the cinematography starts to decline, the scores and soundtrack start to decline, etc.), i think lithgow's performance was great but that was the only thing that has aged well, seasons 1&2 were so much better"
Dexter,2h9idq,reggieLedoux26,2,Thu Sep 25 03:41:56 2014 UTC,I completely agree with this.  People seem to overlook these things due to Lithgow and the season finale.  But it really was as poor as 3/5/6/7 in terms of direction and production.  Nothing will compete with seasons 1 and 2. They were special.
Dexter,2h9idq,gtonizuka,4,Thu Oct 2 22:39:55 2014 UTC,Two words: season 2

Dexter,2h9idq,hugojunior10,3,Mon Oct 13 21:44:36 2014 UTC,"It's rather unique. You're able to see inside the mind of a very interesting character, the setting is great, steady progression from seasons 1-4. If the show had stopped then it would be considered one of the all time greats. Michael .C. Hall is superb, hearing his thoughts takes the show to a new level, like Frank Underwood in House of Cards."

Dexter,2h8w6m,Stewart_ner,5,Tue Sep 23 17:32:37 2014 UTC,Dexter goes through like three slide boxes throughout the show. Why would the FBI give Dexter the box that was evidence against Doakes? He got a new box.
Dexter,2h8w6m,Andrado,6,Tue Sep 23 19:13:42 2014 UTC,"After Doakes is gone, Dexter purchases a brand new slide box with no slides in it. It obviously isn't not the same one that was put in evidence, that'd be pointlessly risky"
Dexter,2h53fm,turntechDestiel,16,Mon Sep 22 16:57:11 2014 UTC,Michael C. Hall is probably one of the most amazing actors I've seen in a TV Show. There's something in the way he constantly plays two characters at once.
Dexter,2h53fm,Slaytounge,12,Mon Sep 22 19:08:22 2014 UTC,You should watch Six Feet Under if you haven't already. He's great in it.

Dexter,2h53fm,rollingintheshallow,15,Mon Sep 22 21:17:58 2014 UTC,"Yeah that S4 ending was brutal.  Really, it was so powerful, there was no way the show would ever really be able to top that again.  The decline of the show over the last couple seasons was unfortunate, but that sudden steep drop at the end was just unforgivable.  Still leaves a bad taste in my mouth for the whole series."
Dexter,2h53fm,Dalek_Genocide,4,Tue Sep 23 04:35:02 2014 UTC,I cried like a little girl at that ending.
Dexter,2h53fm,rollingintheshallow,3,Mon Sep 22 19:52:54 2014 UTC,I called my wife right after I saw it. His son sitting in the bathroom disturbed me so much. I've never been so affected by a show.

Dexter,2h53fm,orflin,41,Wed Sep 24 19:22:13 2014 UTC,"Some of my favorite moments:  The Ice Truck Killer reveal. The Ken/Barbie email, the ""oh shit, Deb's in big fucking trouble"" feeling, it was just phenomenal.  All of season 2. The constant, building pressure of the FBI narrowing it down right to Dexter's very department. Doakes finding out Dexter's secret, the confrontation where Dex overpowers Doakes for the second time, the conversations between Dex and Doakes toward the very end. This was my favorite season, for sure.  When The Skinner has Dex on his table, and he's playing mind games with him throughout the whole ""interrogation."" The escape and fight scene were great, but nothing compared to the insanity MCH conveyed simply talking to the Skinner while tied to the table.  The return of Super-Agent Lundy. I loved this character, and was so pissed when he died. The whole Trinity arc was fascinating, and so frustrating, and finally, tragically shocking. The actors who played his tortured and scarred family, Rita going from demanding wife and mother, to getting so close to accepting Dexter and his ""dark side,"" and then BOOM, dead. That was killer.  The revenge/redemption season to follow I thought was great as well. As viewers, we needed to grieve, and hunting and killing some of the most despicable characters ever written into television was exactly what the doctor ordered.   Isaak. Fuckin'. Sirko. One of my favorite villain/anti-villains of any TV show, ever. Kept you guessing as to why he cared so much about Victor, vengeful vendetta ends in simply being fascinated by the man who ended his lover's life. ""So why do you do it? Why do you kill?""  The end of S8E1. Vogel giving Dexter the fucked up drawings he made as a kid. This may have been the biggest ""holy shit"" moment since Rita died. I loved getting some end of the road backstories on the characters we all knew and loved by that point. It was just a phenomenal idea for a last season IMO. Execution through the last episode? Debatable. But a great construct for a finale season.  ""Because I own you.""  Brian's return in season 6. After Dex kills the man who shot Brother Sam ( :'(  ), he looks up to see his brother applauding him, and then they go on a road trip the next episode. Good times.  And one of my favorites of the entire series: The two-episode arc of Ray Speltzer. The stalking, bringing Deb in, the initial hunt, getting captured, escaping, then one of the best kill scenes in the history of the show, with the literal and symbolic burning of his past/trophies/etc. This was fucking brilliant, and what made the show so great to begin with.  I'm one of the few who thought that some of the execution of Season 8 was done poorly (Dex leaving Vogel in a room right next to all of his knives and leaving Deb alone to handle him... ""Stalking"" Vogel by standing outside the restaurant in broad goddamn daylight staring menacingly at his target for an hour... ugh...) but the finale I didn't think was bad at all. I picture Dex living a long, lonely life killing some bad fuckers in the Pacific Northwest, and maybe eventually finding bigfoot out there. My favorite TV show ever. Great post, I love revisiting these moments."

Dexter,2h53fm,Spider_Bear,6,Mon Sep 22 20:49:36 2014 UTC,"James Doakes. Loved every single part of him being in the show. Too bad they killed him off, I think he really added something to the show and it was never getting boring. Just amazing banter.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJfTVix_kRw The first scene is so good.  I also loved a moment where Dexter is just out on the boat, I think it's from the very first episode, and thinking about how nice and calm it is, and how he doesn't understand other humans, and how he doesn't have to pretend when he's alone on the water. In a way I think a lot of people can relate to that, even though most people can't relate to it on quite the same level as he does.  Dexter hunting a pedophile. Love every part of this. Just his super focused and protective stance. And because of t he quote: ""Because in a land of predators, a Lion never fear the Jackal"". The theme of him being protective of his children just makes him so much more a likeable person.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk3p3QGVWh4"

Dexter,2h53fm,Kembawalker1,4,Tue Sep 23 02:02:00 2014 UTC,"I just finished watching the series finale last night.  My wife and I binge watched it over the last 2-3 months.  Going into the series, we already had an idea that a lot of people thought the show went downhill over time and had heard that most people were very unhappy with the ending.  I completely disagree with the idea that the series went downhill over time.  I think some seasons were better than others.  The season with Colin Hanks was probably my least favorite, but I thought it was still entertaining and suspenseful.    As far as the ending goes, I wasn't a fan of it.  I understand the reason behind it, but wish they would have chosen another direction.  I would have preferred him to go away with Hannah and Harrison and give Harrison the childhood he was never able to have and help him become a good person.  I believe Harrison is in good hands with Hannah, but he now has to grow up knowing his mom was murdered and his dad was killed in the storm.  I think he has a tough life ahead of him.  Perhaps it stands out so much because it was one of the last scenes I watched, but I really liked the scene in the last episode when he is in the room with Quinn and Bautista watching the video of him killing Saxon.  As soon as they watched the video, the camera turned to the reactions of both Bautista and Quinn and the looks on their faces stuck out to me.  They both saw the precision in which he executed his plan.  They finally saw the side of Dexter that the audience has seen since the first episode."
Dexter,2h53fm,mikeramey1,2,Tue Sep 23 07:10:13 2014 UTC,"Yes! That scene was perfect! I think they were both a little shocked at how calmly he was able to kill him, but couldn't fault him because they both hated Saxon and Dexter was their friend.  Edit: I actually don't mind the ending because it was fitting that he would be responsible for the death of Debra and then dump her as his last victim. I'm pretty sure he didn't expect to survive the storm, so I guess I see that as misfortune that he'll live the rest of his life alone and probably let his ""dark passenger"" consume him."

Dexter was the only thing that could get me to pass up on Sunday Night Football during the fall. I wasn't nuts about the final season airing in the Summer. It didn't feel right watching new Dexter in June. Autumn was Dexter time, and it felt right.   Mondays when I got home from class, I'd stop at McDonalds or something and grab lunch, go home, and rewatch the previous night's episode.   Again, say what you want about the final season, but at least when it was airing, we were still getting Dexter. Even if you hated it, bad Dexter was better than no Dexter.

I don't know about the story line surrounding her, but everything about her just seemed great. Dexter somehow manages to find someone who knows him completely and loves him for who he is. Someone who can feel safe with a serial killer, and he in turn also can feel safe with a serial killer. The scene where Dexter changes her mind on killing her is super intense and one of the sexiest things I've seen on TV ever. I also thought Yvonne Strahovski's acting was amazing, and that's probably a big part of why I fell in love with the character.  Least favourite... I really don't know. I had a hard time getting the love for Quinn for a long time, but he developed into something better, even though I was never able to love him strongly."

We just used to pilot episode for stages of a plot (exposition, rising action, climax etc.)  We used Dexter because she was a huge fan of the show! And we had also started studying Freudian theory in literature, which is why she pointed that out (phallic object)."

Dexter,2gtcks,veintisiete,3,Fri Sep 19 02:29:53 2014 UTC,"I watched R rated stuff in English class and History class in high school.  They usually have some parental permissions sheets for stuff like that.  My English teacher used to block the screen during nude scenes, but I remember seeing a nude scene in Schindler's List in my history class.  That being said, we read Less Than Zero, which is by Bret Easton Ellis - the guy who also wrote American Psycho.  Less Than Zero is not remotely as disturbing or graphic or violent as American Psycho, but it contains some pretty disturbing rape and snuff scenes involving young teens as well as a 12 year old.  We also read Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk.  I don't really see any justification for watching Dexter in an English class.  It was pretty high brow and clever in the beginning, but I think if film is included in the curriculum, it should be a little more serious."

Dexter,2gtcks,Kracker5000,0,Fri Sep 19 16:43:33 2014 UTC,"In my high school, over the years we watched a few movies not very suitable for children. Platoon and American History X, for example, and those were watched earlier than senior year. If the movie was rated R, we had to have a signed parental consent form. That could've been the case here. But 17-18 year olds can handle one episode of Dexter."
Dexter,2gtcks,EmoKidSid,0,Fri Sep 19 19:58:55 2014 UTC,"Platoon and American History X are relevant in historical context and serve some academic purpose.   Dexter does not, and there are plenty of better, more appropriate examples of story arc."

Can't blame her for that."

Dexter,2gtcks,veggiter,2,Fri Sep 19 16:37:08 2014 UTC,"This isn't 1922, media/movies/tv is incorporated into almost every class."
Dexter,2gtcks,Kracker5000,-4,Fri Sep 19 18:14:12 2014 UTC,"Considering those media are nearly ubiquitous and pretty much inescapable, while books aren't, I think studying English from the written word is still the best way to actually learn anything.  There is a difficulty and discipline to reading that doesn't come into play with the typically passive activity of watching film.  It sounds like lazy teaching to me.  I get the occasional film here and there, but a short story would provide everything your teacher needed to teach, while providing a challenge to the students."
Dexter,2gtcks,veggiter,0,Fri Sep 19 20:21:42 2014 UTC,I'm sure your opinion is highly valued over someone with a teaching degree.
Dexter,2gtcks,Kracker5000,-3,Fri Sep 19 18:56:37 2014 UTC,"A teaching degree = 4 years of college with possibly a double major in English.  It hardly makes someone an expert in their field, and I've also had plenty of shitty teachers over the years who've had the same training.  My opinion is the result of going to school my whole life.  I know watching a TV show is not nearly as enriching or difficult or educational as reading a book, with perhaps very few exceptions."

Dexter,2gup1v,MICHAELSD01,16,Fri Sep 19 11:32:01 2014 UTC,"In terms of critical acclaim, the early seasons of Dexter don't really compare to Breaking Bad. The 4th season was seen as above average to good with some fantastic performances and a fantastic finale. Remember, the show wasted about 20% of the Season 4 air time to a LaGuerta and Batista romance and featured a ton of ho hum episodes along side the classic ones like ""Hello, Dexter Morgan"".   Meanwhile, Season 3 was widely panned as a huge step back from the previous two. In particular, this was the season that cast aside the show's rules for realism. Once that happens, the stakes are dramatically lowered. Personally, I enjoyed it, but it was certainly silly. And while Season 2 is a classic season of television, the ending was widely panned.   The show was always saddled with weak supporting characters (the actors are great - the characters were weak). Breaking Bad took its clownish cartoon (Hank Schraeder) and developed him into a rich and complex character. I do think you're onto something that if Dexter had been planned as a 5 season show, the writers would have made different choices and avoided the repetition and ridiculous means they used to keep the show moving forward. But it wouldn't have reached the Breaking Bad/Mad Men stratosphere."

Dexter,2gup1v,TK7901,2,Fri Sep 19 18:31:28 2014 UTC,"Contains Spoilers:  Chase storyline was amazing. The only part of it that I didn't enjoy would have to be how Lumen and Dexter hooked up since in season 1 Rita who had suffered much less wasn't able to have sex with dexter for quite a while. I liked the season because I felt Lumen wasn't a safe character, which added tension.  DDK had it's ups and downs.. personally I liked the plot twist, it allowed DDK to escape out of dexter's pity, only to fuck things up when he came back. I liked brother sam subplot too. What I didn't like was the countless boring episodes. But it had some pretty intense moments, the gas bomb and the Batista hostage moment both in particular had me thinking that shit was going down, the last episode was amazing.  As to the seventh season, the popular opinion is actually that it was a great season. Personally I loved the whole Mafia/Hannah/La Guerta storyline and the only small issue I had was that I saw a lot of potential at Dexter having to work as Isaak's hitman. I was upset it all happened in 1 episode. If I was in charge i'd have Magda killed. It's better than having her dumping Quinn after all he did tbh.  Personally I think season 3 was around the same level as season 6."

Dexter,2gup1v,Partytimegarrth,0,Fri Sep 19 23:30:32 2014 UTC,"In season 5, lumen and Dexter never should've been 'involved', it was an unnecessary relationship. DDK shouldn't have been there at all and Season 7 was by far the best storyline since season 4. The mafia was a good idea, and the developments with Dexter and Isaak were great"
Dexter,2gup1v,jmanning0236,2,Sat Sep 20 13:22:58 2014 UTC,Why shouldn't there have been a ddk? What the hell kind of statement is that? Would you rather have no show?

Dexter,2gsez7,Slaytounge,2,Thu Sep 18 21:57:05 2014 UTC,"It wasn't just Quinn but also Angel. It just seemed odd given the fact that:  1) Dexter was a member of the police force  2) he killed Oliver in his cell  3) why aren't there prison guards to stop this?  4) why aren't there more questions for Dexter to handle? some sort of official testimony or proceedings following the murder?  5) Dexter's number one rule is ""Never get caught."" This pretty much breaks the rules of all of the the previous episodes of careful planning and killing.  It's like the writers were thinking 'fuck, we have this guy in jail and we need everything to wrap up nicely in the last episode so, hey, we'll make this completely improbable murder happen.'"
Dexter,2gsez7,Slaytounge,6,Thu Sep 18 22:05:24 2014 UTC,"I always felt that they gave him a ""pass"".  Dexter has worked for Miami Metro Homicide for years at this point.  EVERYBODY in that department loved Deb. Batista saw her as a little sister, Quinn had just admitted he was in love with her.  Oliver stabbed Dexter first, after that it was easy to declare it self defense.   Did Dexter overreact to the attack? Maybe, but Oliver had 1) JUST stabbed him and 2) was implicated in the murder of his sister.  Quinn and Batista both loved Deb for different reason, they just put Dexter in the holding cell with Saxton, who he believes just killed his sister, to take a swab for DNA.   So from Quinn and Angel's view point Dexter was stabbed by his sister's killer, who they both loved and KNOWINGLY put her brother in a confined space with him.   I think this is more a matter of a Miami Metro Homicide fucking up and covering their as than covering for Dexter"
Dexter,2gsez7,WFAlex,1 point,Thu Sep 18 22:31:42 2014 UTC,"They didn't put him in there. Dexter went in there of his own accord, he made up the DNA swabs to cover his back."
Dexter,2gsez7,WFAlex,1 point,Sun Sep 28 22:55:54 2014 UTC,I always felt that this indicated that they somehow knew about the kind of person Dexter really was.
Dexter,2gsez7,Zenith661,10,Sun Sep 28 21:59:57 2014 UTC,"I feel like the writers had someone with Aspergers write the scenes involving Dexter and Rita + Kids. The family dynamic between Rita and her kids is ridiculously cringe inducing. I get it when Dexter is awkward, but they have no excuse."

Dexter,2gp1s9,PiTheKhoz,3,Thu Sep 18 01:59:50 2014 UTC,"I watched s1-4 twice within a year, because the second time I was showing someone. The third time was a year later, then another year, and then three years. So, seasons 5-8 feel new compared to those first four"
Dexter,2gp1s9,PiTheKhoz,2,Thu Sep 18 02:03:36 2014 UTC,"Well, I think that showing someone a show is an exception also, because part of the enjoyment is being able to talk to other people and gauge their reactions. But still, I'm not even planning a Dexter rewatch for a while. I've got Psych and Lost to rewatch already. ;D"

Dexter,2gp1s9,Fabien_Lamour,-5,Thu Sep 18 02:01:25 2014 UTC,"A song is five minutes, a season is 10 hours.   They're very different mediums. There's no intrigue in a song.  Your comparison is stupid"

Dexter,2gp1s9,eyeslikepotatoes,2,Thu Sep 18 00:29:28 2014 UTC,John Lithgow is an amazing actor. It was crazy seeing this tv dad be this evil serial killer. It was why his performance was so captivating.

Dexter,2gjfus,Zcougar,12,Tue Sep 16 07:12:26 2014 UTC,"I don't agree with this at all.   First of all: He's made to have human characteristics because to succeed with a show, you need to have a likeable protagonist. So how to do that? Give him guilt, give him a sarcastic view on society, give him family values, give him being really competent at his job, and give him a code that says he can only kill bad guys.  Second: He doesn't follow his code always, though. We have seen numerous times in the show, that when things go wrong for Dexter on an emotional level, he breaks, and he starts acting like a true psychopath. He kills random people for in rage without remorse, like it was nothing.  Third: Even without that, though, he has this urge to kill, like an addiction. If it's been too long he starts getting anxious. He longs for it, he ravels in it, it is his highest amount of pleasure. He has a ceremony, and he even takes trophies. He started with killing a dog that annoyed his family, and could barely hold it in until he got the chance to kill again. He speaks of his first human kill like if he lost his virginity. He is also completely detached from all of human emotions, just simply don't understand it. Even when he's married, he makes more effort towards learning about other serial killers than his wife. He chose Rita because she's emotionally damaged, and easy manipulate, and a good cover. Not because he loves her.  My Fourth point is: Yes, if we watch the show from start to finish right now, like it was a perfectly thought out plan all along, then yes, you're probably right, that is what the show is. However, that's not how it was written!  How the show ended is how it became after the original writer left the show. The original writer's plan was not that everything would just be something that Dexter imagined. The original plan was for Dexter to get caught like a serial killer and killed. If you only watch the first 4-5 seasons, then there will be no evidence that the intended meaning of the show is that Dexter is in fact not a psychopath. It was added retroactively. I might add that the reason that many people don't love the last seasons as much as the earlier ones is because this idea doesn't really work 100%.  Fifth point, for good meassure: I haven't read the whole Dexter book series, only like 4 books, and let me just say... There's no question as to wether he's a psychopath there. I don't want to spoil too much, but he's definitely not a normal person that just happened to have a father that tricked him into becoming a serial killer in the books, that's for sure. The book is not the same as the show though, but this is a bonus point."
Dexter,2gjfus,qwedswerty,13,Tue Sep 16 14:22:44 2014 UTC,That's basically the entire point of the show...
Dexter,2gjfus,Aysaar,4,Tue Sep 16 12:56:06 2014 UTC,"Yea...I was reading this and was like...so where is the part that I never thought about before?  When the show was still on air, this subreddit was full of this type of discussion regarding if or if not Dexter is a sociopath."
Dexter,2gjfus,GreyWalker,7,Tue Sep 16 14:25:57 2014 UTC,"Why did Dexter trap and flay small animals as a boy? This prompted Harry to believe Dexter was troubled. Dexter is a sociopath and the question was whether he could be rehabilitated or not (nature or nurture). He tried to blame a dark passenger but finally embraces that he is damned either way. Harrison's best hope is to fend for himself, which takes the disposition of a sociopath to understand.   The original Dexter was troubled and by the end still is. How does he abandon Harrison if he isn't off? There's no repentance in isolating himself; he's the Unabomber with a cleaver and axe."
Dexter,2gjfus,eavesly,1 point,Tue Sep 16 14:55:27 2014 UTC,I agree. I think along the way the writers got too concerned with making Dexter likeable and got desperate for storylines.
Dexter,2gjfus,longgonelol,1 point,Thu Sep 18 21:45:58 2014 UTC,"I also feel like they start being very serious about showing that murder is in fact a bad thing and that we as an audience shouldn't try it ourselves around season 5 or so, can't remember exactly when it started, but it's definitely there. Maybe it was there a little all along, but towards the end it became much more obvious to me."
Dexter,2gjfus,qwedswerty,5,Wed Sep 24 19:02:32 2014 UTC,"What about when he bludgeons the random stranger to death after Rita dies, then he's like, ""ah, I needed that.""  Also all the social interactions he doesn't understand."
Dexter,2gjfus,peacecake,6,Tue Sep 16 17:50:10 2014 UTC,"The show is much more interesting if you can understand that Dexter is actually a bad guy.   If you assume he's a murderous Batman that's the emotionally and narratively safe route. While that take isn't completely dishonest to the show's premise, I feel it's a cop-out. Kind of like how the last episode is a cop-out.    This is a dude who genuinely feels the need to murder other humans, and abuses his police privileges to circumvent the law to do so.    He has a workout physique and a high-performing normal job. This is kind of TV logic and while it's pretty atypical for a psychopath it's TV and that's what it is.    But what he certainly is, is a terrible husband and father. He would leave his wife and child for long periods of time to go out to hunt and murder people. After his wife died, he constantly left his son with babysitters to go out to hunt and murder people.    He killed one innocent man because his vetting process didn't work out. Nothing came of it. He killed another man in the bathroom just because the guy was being a jerk. That man did not deserve to die at all. Nothing came of it.    He thinks he loves Lumen because she accepts him for who he is -- until her revenge is complete. She gets closure on her story but Dexter still needs to kill people. Lumen walks away, and this rejects the core of Dexter's entire being.    Deb, wow. Her headstone should just say, ""Fuck'n fuck."" Got less attention from dad because her brother is a psychopath, dated Ice Truck Killer, got shot multiple times, tanks her entire moral code and career covering for brother, and finally vegetables from a blood clot. Dexter is a bad brother.    That final scene with lumberdex, despite all of the flaws of that season, the look on his face of having nothing, deserving nothing, and being nothing....perfect.    Dexter is a brilliant, likable, horrible human being."
Dexter,2gjfus,Kinetic_Card,3,Tue Sep 16 18:13:01 2014 UTC,"I agree that dexter doesn't exactly exhibit traits of a normal psychopath  towards the end of the show- but in season 3 episode 3, Harry shows Dex a picture of a psychopath's brain and shows him how their brains are exactly the same."

Dexter,2geirt,rollingintheshallow,17,Mon Sep 22 23:33:25 2014 UTC,I always wondered that too. Also wondered why nobody questioned his search history or stray samples. You would think there would be some record of him running samples an finding matches to all these people who then disappear... They weren't all currently under investigation.
Dexter,2geirt,sillyribbit,4,Sun Sep 14 23:34:25 2014 UTC,There were even a few times where he would search for a suspect of an investigation and make the perp dissapear- then later on the police would ID the perp and try to find him.  You'd think that they would catch on that in all of those occasions Dexter ID'd the guy but didn't tell anybody about it.
Dexter,2geirt,gerrettheferrett,1 point,Mon Sep 15 04:11:51 2014 UTC,That's exactly what he said.
Dexter,2geirt,nemyhlol,2,Mon Sep 15 04:34:09 2014 UTC,No. He said that they weren't all currently under investigation. He was more talking about the more cold-er cases Dexter talks about.  I was specifically talking more about the times when he literally stole the perp from the cops.
Dexter,2geirt,gerrettheferrett,2,Mon Sep 15 04:58:15 2014 UTC,If I remember correctly in most of those situations the department just assumes they skipped town. Admittedly it happens a lot in the show and Dexter would definitely be in prison within a week if it were real life. He takes phone calls DURING kills.
Dexter,2geirt,nemyhlol,2,Mon Sep 15 16:55:42 2014 UTC,"I don't think taking phone calls during kills is actually that bad for Dexter, If someone asks where he was during a kill he can be like oh I was wherever talking to my sister on the phone, that forms part of an alibi for him.Though I guess the gps data from the phonecall could be incriminating but because of the way he prepares his kill rooms there is no evidence a murder happened there."
Dexter,2geirt,Fuzzy-Hat,1 point,Mon Sep 15 18:09:15 2014 UTC,"But he sometimes takes calls while stalking his victims too.  And the GPS data was a huge plot point later sure, but it should have been a problem for him from day 1."
Dexter,2geirt,gerrettheferrett,1 point,Mon Sep 15 18:26:31 2014 UTC,Correct. Cellphone timestamps and tower triangulation would land him on death row (since Florida practices capital punishment) in a matter of days. Not to mention your original point of researching suspects and them suddenly disappearing time and time again.
Dexter,2geirt,nemyhlol,7,Mon Sep 15 21:57:25 2014 UTC,"They'd have to talk to each other about that.  ""You know, I always see Dexter's computer screen is blank""  ""Me too!"", and that isn't likely."
Dexter,2geirt,bobbob1016,3,Mon Sep 15 00:48:57 2014 UTC,"Yep, any sane person would just assume he's browsing porn or something of the like, not something you'd bring up to other detectives.  Unless you're Doakes, Doakes would do something like that."
Dexter,2geirt,PanRagon,6,Mon Sep 15 21:58:03 2014 UTC,"Only the times that we see. That's probably less than 1/50 of the times that people actually do walk into the office. The show is about Dexter's killings, not unimportant boring analysis that he'll probably spend most of his time with."
Dexter,2geirt,qwedswerty,8,Sun Sep 14 23:40:32 2014 UTC,"He also has to maintain a cover life, which would include actually getting work done and avoiding any kind of suspicious behaviour."
Dexter,2geirt,ChickinSammich,7,Sun Sep 14 23:49:20 2014 UTC,"I've always found myself curious about why it seems like he can leave work and fuck off wherever he wants, whenever he wants, and no one stops him or says anything about it."
Dexter,2geirt,turntechDestiel,6,Mon Sep 15 14:29:04 2014 UTC,"I think this is actually a thing that, in my opinion, should have a pretty obvious reason from the first episode. ""The only real question I have is why, in a building full of cops - all supposedly with a keen insight into the human soul - is Doakes the only one who gets the creeps from me?"" And that's kind of an important theme. He's the blood guy. He brings everyone donuts. He's the friendly neighborhood blood-spatter analyst who, in most people's eyes, doesn't have a shred of bad in him. Throughout the entire series, Batista was completely blind to everything he did that was shady, because he so genuinely believed that Dexter was good to the very core. They're ignorant to what Dexter hides because they're unable to believe that he does anything but good."
Dexter,2geirt,antuna,30,Mon Sep 15 18:52:52 2014 UTC,That's the one thing you think his coworkers would notice? How bout when he straight up killed someone on camera (S8) and they just write it off as self-defense when it clearly was not.
Dexter,2geirt,alibi6,27,Sun Sep 14 22:49:55 2014 UTC,"I believe that was more the officers turning a blind eye to what he did. That video will probably end up ""misfiled"" if anyone asks serious questions."

Dexter,2geirt,antuna,18,Sun Sep 14 23:44:41 2014 UTC,Worst ending to a show I've ever seen. I'm disappointed but I knew it was going to be bad.

Dexter,2geirt,ventus,2,Mon Sep 15 04:29:55 2014 UTC,I actually didn't mind the Seinfeld finale.
Dexter,2geirt,PanRagon,3,Mon Sep 15 04:34:23 2014 UTC,Totally agree
Dexter,2geirt,ventus,9,Mon Sep 15 00:02:10 2014 UTC,Is there a thread somewhere where people liked the ending? I've lurked here for a while and everyone seems to have hive-minded their way to this big clusterfuck of an ending. I want to know where the people that liked the ending are.
Dexter,2geirt,GoodOneRandy,14,Mon Sep 15 02:59:22 2014 UTC,"Warning: Finale Spoilers  For the most part I didn't actually mind it that much. I can understand why people reacted the way they did but in truth it really wasn't the worst ending. And the original series creator's/showrunner's(?) one was even worse IMO.   Season 8 was a mess, that much was apparent. In fact by the time the finale rolled around I really wasn't expecting much. But what they gave us is actually kind of interesting. The theme of S8 is basically that Dexter can't change who he is. Vogel constantly tells him how ""perfect"" he is, and that being a psychopath isn't something he should be ashamed of. He can control who and how he kills yes, but stopping isn't something he can or should do.  The problem is that this conflicts with most of the series, which features Dexter growing from a hollow shell of a person to someone actually capable of empathy. Because of this people expected one of two endings to occur. There's the ""happy ever after"" where Dex and Hannah and Harrison move to Argentina where he presumably continues killing, and maybe even in the future has to instruct Harrison in the code. And then there's the ""tragic downfall"" where everyone finally sees him for what he is, he's caught, and summarily executed.  People don't like that it didn't fall into either of these. Instead what you get is something that falls more in line with S8's theme, and also mirrors a lot of what is set up in S1 and S4. The series ends with Dexter finally accepting himself for who he is. A killer. While he may be capable of feelings/emotions/empathy (possibly all along or something he grew, there is evidence supporting both) it doesn't matter because as long as there are people in his life that he cares about, they are going to be hurt.   And so he does the only thing that makes sense to him, and isolates himself. Yes Harrison has to grow up without his father, but he certainly likes Hannah enough and she herself has always wanted a family. And without Dexter around anymore, the two of them are safe(r). The whole lumberjack thing was too colorful for most people to read past it.  But just take a look at the final scene (which people also hate, a lot) with Dexter in his cabin. As he stares there is no music, no ghost Harry to console him. This is very important. You see he doesn't need to comfort himself anymore, he doesn't need to justify himself anymore. He is empty, and isolated because he has to be. To protect the people he loves, he has to be alone."
Dexter,2geirt,brob,2,Mon Sep 15 03:45:39 2014 UTC,"A lot of people hated the final because of just how poorly done it was, what they were going for wasn't bad they just really fucked up telling it"
Dexter,2geirt,ryoe123,2,Mon Sep 15 21:12:56 2014 UTC,"The only thing I didn't like about the last scene was how pointless it really seemed. He somehow miraculously survived this huge fucking storm only to lead a life of... Nothing.  Yeah, no ghost of Harry, no pictures of his son, completely isolated. But him surviving that storm seemed so impossible, and why would they make him survive only to do nothing. Giving his own life would be quite the sacrifice aswell, especially for a psychopath with no emotions.  Outside of that the ending didn't bother me to much, I see where they were going with it, I just wished they killed him.  But of course, the ending of S2 is still the best ending of all the seasons."
Dexter,2geirt,antuna,1 point,Mon Sep 15 21:54:10 2014 UTC,"I'd think it's supposed to be poetic. The storm washes his identity away, leaving him empty.  And having him die to some noble suicide actually wouldn't fit. One of the big points of all of this is that Dexter is never the one to answer for what he's done. The people around him always pay the price. He's the psychopath, the one who has evolved for survival. And that's whether he likes it or not.  And killing him? Nowhere near as powerful as killing all of the hope he had for becoming normal, as forcing him to live every day understanding what he's lost and why he lost it.  Plus killing him completely ruins the arc of another character. Leave him alive, so that one day the true hero of the show can take another crack at his lizard-glidin' ass. It's only a matter of time."
Dexter,2geirt,maneyack,5,Mon Sep 15 23:55:37 2014 UTC,"This is exactly why I was fine with the ending, he made the ultimate sacrifice for the people he loves."

I never saw him as a person that would have a happy-ever-after ending and I never saw him as a suicide. If he was going to die it would be because of something else, not necessarily a mistake on his part but something else."

Dexter,2geirt,antuna,6,Sun Sep 14 23:06:22 2014 UTC,"Closest thing to how some departments are actually run. Cop = good, murderer = bad, and Dexter saved them a ton of time and money getting that guy to trial.   ""He's been under a lot of stress"" - ""Yeah, how about we ""malfunction"" this recording?""  Given the rash of Houdini Suicides in actual news, I can see that as plausible within the storyline."
Dexter,2geirt,falcon4287,3,Mon Sep 15 02:25:05 2014 UTC,"I meant, didn't the guy stab dex with it right after Dex said ""I came here to kill you, with this pen."", thus making it self defense?"
Dexter,2geirt,ariesbabe,2,Mon Sep 15 04:00:20 2014 UTC,"Closest thing to how some departments are actually run.    In Hollywood, maybe...    Given the rash of Houdini Suicides in actual news...    You mean the one? Because there's only been one.   Your bias is showing."
Dexter,2geirt,ariesbabe,-1,Mon Sep 15 04:10:17 2014 UTC,"Well yes, but keep in mind that this was the same guy [spoiler] (s/ that put Debra into a coma, eventually leading to her death), so it would be understandable for any normal person to react negatively (i'm not saying it's ok, but it was logical.) So the station turned a blind eye and excused it."
Dexter,2geirt,Nebakanezzer,-1,Mon Sep 15 00:36:42 2014 UTC,"You did that spoiler tag wrong, and no, I don't think that is at all a reason for the police department to ignore a blatant homicide recorded on camera."
Dexter,2geirt,falcon4287,3,Mon Sep 15 00:48:05 2014 UTC,"Actual police departments turn blind eyes to much worse with less reason. I think it's safe to say that most of the other officers wanted to do exactly the same.  In this case, Dexter's action was that of a completely rational, normal human being. He didn't do anything a regular person wouldn't have done. Committing one crime of passion is certainly not something that will make someone suspect of being a serial killer."

Dexter,2geirt,DarthTyekanik,5,Mon Sep 15 02:08:37 2014 UTC,Or him running background checks using police computers on people who aren't current cases that later end up dead.
Dexter,2gexfb,falcon4287,33,Mon Sep 15 00:28:08 2014 UTC,"Most of the time, he goes after criminals who slip through the cracks of the legal system. He rarely goes after people who are currently under investigation, although he does start to do that more often later on in the show, particularly season 7."
Dexter,2gexfb,SexLiesAndExercise,7,Mon Sep 15 02:19:18 2014 UTC,"Yeah, they kind of gave up on actually showing Dexter doing what he's supposed to do all the time, making it all seem a bit hypocritical.   He even flies into a mad rage in one episode and kills a guy he doesn't like because he's in a bad mood. They tried to thinly justify it with ""oh but he was definitely a bad guy"", but Dexter had no way of being sure about this at the time, making him barely better than some of the people he's killed."
Dexter,2gexfb,Fuzzy-Hat,7,Mon Sep 15 10:21:21 2014 UTC,Are you talking about the guy he killed in the toilet in episode one of season 5? I think that can be forgiven because of what had just happened to Rita.
Dexter,2gexfb,rollingintheshallow,1 point,Mon Sep 15 20:11:05 2014 UTC,Cold blooded murder is cold blooded murder.
Dexter,2gexfb,Fuzzy-Hat,1 point,Tue Sep 23 22:19:55 2014 UTC,Well any murder is bad and Dexter is a psychopathic serial killer. So him flying off the handle and killing someone that didn't fit the code is entirely understandable when you consider what he is and what just happened to his family.
Dexter,2gexfb,Meior,0,Tue Sep 23 23:04:10 2014 UTC,"They didn't get to thinly justify anything. Dexter have killed innocent people, its no secret or unintended issue."
Dexter,2gexfb,ArchStanton27,12,Sun Sep 28 11:25:07 2014 UTC,Let's think of everyone (up till that point) who he has hunted while the police have.   Jeremy Downs (s1e7) Ice Truck Killer (s1e12) Little Chino (s2e1) Ken Olsen (s2e6) James Doakes (s2 end) Freebo (s3e2) Miguel Prado (s3e11) Benny Gomez (s4e1) Jonathan Farrow (s4e7) Trinity Killer (all of s4) Everyone involved in the Barrel Girl case.   So yeah. I'd say that he's full of shit.
Dexter,2gexfb,gerrettheferrett,6,Mon Sep 15 03:26:30 2014 UTC,"You also have to realize that the stuff we see is like 1/10 of his life.  The rest is boring, mundane, everyday shit at home and work that he does in order to blend in.  So, in that sense, he's telling the truth.  But, even 1/10 is a lot. So yeah, you could say he's full of it too."
Dexter,2gexfb,PiTheKhoz,8,Mon Sep 15 04:18:00 2014 UTC,"Well, we see, what, 10 hours or less of each year of Dexter's life? Presumably, there is at least one violent crime in Miami each day, probably two or three, so Dexter is working between 300 and 800 cases a year, of which we see between 5 and 20. Now, those are the ones where he goes rouge, but there are also some we don't see. Now, being generous, I would guess that would be about 50 kills a year (which I think is way more than Dexter actually does, could be wrong). So basically, we see less than 0.05% of Dexter's life in a given year, which would be the interesting bits. Dexter works with the police for the majority of any given year, with only small bits done working against them.  So, I think that we, as an audience, would say that Dexter is full of shit, but Dexter himself wouldn't see it that way.  But the writers would see that Dexter works against the police all the time, so basically I think they're full of shit."

Sherlock also is worth a look.  12 episodes over 3 mini seasons.  Both are super-intelligent detectives with completely different personalities and therefore M.O.s.  High quality and easy to watch over a relatively short time.    I'm on a break from TV as I've done the above plus Bteaking Bad, Dexter and True Detective over the summer.  Next up on my list is Sons of Anarchy as everyone keeps saying it's addictive."

Dexter,2gf7fv,sleuthysteve,1 point,Sun Sep 28 11:28:09 2014 UTC,"My opinions, which seem to coincide a lot with some others here:   Better than Dexter's average quality, centered on a protagonist with moral ambiguity but a Washington twist (Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright): House of Cards Similar to Dexter, following serial killers, though I cannot personally relate as I have not watched it consistently: Hannibal Dissimilar to Dexter, but with more crime-solving, consistently clever writing, (Benedict Cumberbatch, Martin Freeman): Sherlock Similar to Sherlock, but far more formulaic (Hugh Laurie): House Funny, but falls off after a few seasons with formulaic plots and increasingly 1-dimensional characters (James Roday, Dule Hill): Psych Funny, has a mediocre penultimate season, but otherwise no fall in writing quality plus kung fu, Yvonne Strahovski, and Jayne from Firefly: Chuck Dark, great writing and acting, with a cavalcade of good guest stars (Martin Freeman, Billy Bob Thornton): Fargo   As for some of the other suggestions here:   I'd advise against Game of Thrones if you plan to read the books as they are far better and cannot really be read after watching. Otherwise, great series. Avoid The Blacklist if you dislike shows whose quality is inconsistent, especially those that fall off part-way through a season. It's somewhat similar to this genre though. I started about half-way, but I could see others keeping up with it until the end. The Following has a solid fan-base, plus the Bacon. Can't say I've watched it though.   Hope these recommendations helped. The links are for expediting your decision. :)"
Dexter,2gf7fv,heiney_luvr,1 point,Tue Sep 16 01:55:07 2014 UTC,"I was in the same boat as you and found these two shows - though not nearly enough episodes, they get the story done: The Killing and Durham County. Both are dark and suspenseful. I enjoyed them both. As others have said, Hannibal is probably the best TV out there now (which means it will probably get cancelled, unfortunately) Good luck on your search! Edit: I herp-a-derp at reddit formatting"
Dexter,2gcjc9,united1020,11,Sun Sep 14 05:00:38 2014 UTC,I think where she died is perfect timing. Rita has to die for Dexter to realize that he had become that attached to her in the first place.
Dexter,2gcjc9,NamelessNinja66,1 point,Sun Sep 14 09:01:18 2014 UTC,"I agree.  I think Rita went at exactly the right time.  The show could have ended after season 5 ep 2, with Dexter jumping out of his boat like he had originally planned.  I think the show would have been legendary if it finished right then and there."
Dexter,2gcjc9,Toobis,4,Sun Sep 14 11:19:22 2014 UTC,"There's so much wait and anticipation in the Dexter community for Season 5, following the extremely epic finale of Season 4...  What's next for him now that one of the only few things he actually cared about in his life is now gone?  Season 5 comes along. Finally... We've all been waiting for this continuation...  Ok, that was a pretty decent first season episode. Now, we wait to see how all this continues in the second episode...  Ok... Dexter jumps out of his boat... That's the ending?  ...  WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT"
Dexter,2gcjc9,FunSkan,1 point,Sun Sep 14 13:50:02 2014 UTC,I think maybe it should have had everything the way it was up to season 5 which should be switched with season 7 and after deb kills LaGuerta the guilt maybe could have driven her to suicide and then dexter goes to live in isolation
Dexter,2gcjc9,NamelessNinja66,3,Sun Sep 14 20:40:15 2014 UTC,"Her death was great, and epic, and well timed, but if it hadnt happened, I'd have wanted something else to be a catalyst for them falling apart, like maybe she starts to learn about Dex's midnight activities before Deb does, but maybe is killed before it comes out more."
Dexter,2gcjc9,Mark_Fatley,2,Sun Sep 14 22:41:04 2014 UTC,Couldn't agree more about the timing! It was a fantastic leaping point into other territories
Dexter,2gcjc9,Mark_Fatley,2,Sun Sep 14 22:54:57 2014 UTC,"Indeed, but maybe it would have been fun for Rita to catch onto something dark Dex was doing, but knowing it isnt his fake drug addiction. It would have been interesting for the neighbor guy to have gotten involved, maybe investigated dexter, and then Dexter had to take him out, and then his world came crashing down.  Ah, the ways it could have ended."

Dexter,2gcfm6,welshwordman,2,Sun Sep 14 05:06:03 2014 UTC,I had 6 and 7 switched. the rest were the exact same though.

Dexter,2gcfm6,merlin242,2,Sun Sep 14 05:16:15 2014 UTC,"Have you guys re-watched season 4 recently? That season really hasn't aged well, a lot of the problems that plagued upcoming seasons (horribly filmed Harry scenes, uninteresting side plots [batista and laguerta? yikes], captain obvious dexter inner monologues become a thing this season, the cinematography starts to decline, the scores and soundtrack start to decline, etc.), i think lithgow's performance was great but that was the only thing that has aged well, the show peaked in seasons 1&2"

Also I think S5 was a great follow on from the consequences from the ending of S4.  I could almost bump it over S2 because i wasn't convinced by lyla's character and found her annoying, but the tension was great."

Dexter,2g65c2,bigjayrulez,5,Fri Sep 12 20:21:43 2014 UTC,"He really isn't, but early on in the series, when it drew more directly from what the novels paint the character as, he was far more meant to be seen as a psychopathic person for sure. Throughout all of the novels (in so far as I've read, and heard pretty much everyone support this), he's never meant to be seen as human or developing feelings and emotions. In his AMA, Jeff Lindsay even said that sociopaths can't ""grow a soul"" as the show had him do.  Since Angel was saying this from episode one I believe, it'd make sense that it was totally intended."

Dexter,2fz8xj,Kiark,1 point,Wed Oct 1 04:23:47 2014 UTC,The problem season 8 had was that it was airing literally the same night (possibly the same time slot?) as the final season of Breaking Bad. The direct contrast in storytelling was just incredibly jarring and probably made it far worse than it actually was. I'd like to see your opinion on the season being untainted by this comparison.

Dexter,2fz8xj,HerpDerpMapleSerp,1 point,Wed Sep 10 14:55:29 2014 UTC,I honestly thought season 8 wasn't that bad until the last 3 episodes. Once I saw how good the last couple episodes were and how fast paced and good it was getting I realized the whole beginning of that season sucked and then the finale takes a big dump on your chest. I mean I get the finale I understand what the writers were going for but it just wasn't what everyone wanted

Dexter,2fz8xj,Slaytounge,2,Wed Sep 10 08:54:26 2014 UTC,"I agree. It started slow, had some potential in the middle and got kinda interesting even if it was a little ridiculous. The last episode is what killed it for me. But I couldn't not watch it."

Dexter,2g095k,bigbabybeluga,6,Tue Sep 16 01:18:53 2014 UTC,I also think he didn't hate himself.  I think he saw who he was pretty clearly and was willing to accept the consequences of that.  Which is why I saw the ending as so fitting.  He knew that with what he was he would always be alone.  He ended up alone and apart from everyone who mattered to him.  In that regard he wasn't a sociopath in the true definition - he had a conscience.
Dexter,2g095k,rachiedoubt,2,Wed Sep 10 23:39:54 2014 UTC,"I always wanted the show to end that way. Not that I wanted him to, but I felt it would have been a good ending. I know he said multiple times he found it weak and pathetic, but that doesn't mean that's necessarily true. Many people in real life have said that and ended up killing themselves."
Dexter,2g095k,timmehfx,1 point,Wed Sep 10 17:22:23 2014 UTC,"In Season 4 he actually ponders, right before Trinity tries to kill himself, if his life might one day come to that. So Dexter did say it was weak in Season 2, but also entertained the possibility later.   I don't think it's a stretch to think he could have reasonably chosen to take himself out within the show."
Dexter,2ftxv2,garretth10,12,Mon Sep 8 18:44:55 2014 UTC,"I could not stand Zack, the last couple times we saw him he was starting to grow on me then BAM"
Dexter,2ftxv2,DueceX,8,Mon Sep 8 22:38:47 2014 UTC,Just watch the following season 2.. Hes a way better serial killer in that.

Dexter,2ftxv2,Andrado,3,Tue Sep 9 05:50:50 2014 UTC,I always thought that Zach would be the one to kill Dexter and assume his legacy. Would have been a better story progression IMO.
Dexter,2ftxv2,westlax34,1 point,Tue Sep 9 17:11:43 2014 UTC,I always thought Deb would kill Dexter.
Dexter,2ftxv2,zx7,1 point,Tue Sep 9 18:22:08 2014 UTC,"I didn't stand up when he lived, but also I haven't stand up when he died. Indeed it would have maded a great spin-off. Such an non-sense kill, or even character, to have such an short story and die like this. The only thing that messed with me was because most of S08 characters popped from nowhere."
Dexter,2ftxv2,iamdroppy,1 point,Thu Sep 11 00:18:52 2014 UTC,"I started the show when it was on originally and then only finished all of it recently. When I was first watching it, I had high hopes that Dexter would train the kid who killed his rapist and then himself. Show him the way. Bring him ""up to code."""
Dexter,2ftxv2,wato89,0,Sun Nov 23 10:36:51 2014 UTC,"Out of the characters introduced for season 8 he was by far my favourite but that's not really saying much. I was pretty broken up when he died though, he was the only interesting part of the season."
Dexter,2ftxv2,JKOTV,-2,Mon Sep 8 23:23:14 2014 UTC,Ehhh he's about #11 on my character list. So much quality ahead of him.
Dexter,2fsl5t,mrleetyler,8,Mon Sep 8 09:19:48 2014 UTC,"Basically, Dexter covers for Quinn, so Quinn covers for Dexter. They purposely botch the investigation for each other."
Dexter,2fsl5t,LimeJuice,7,Mon Sep 8 18:23:47 2014 UTC,"I haven't seen these episodes in soo long. But I think that a major thing in this show is that you have to remember these are all cops. Not only cops, but they are the task force working with exactly these crimes. There are many different forces that will work against any kind of legal issues towards them. Maybe it isn't a plot hole? Maybe it's simply the police department jumping at the chance of letting go of this unconstructive investigation. Would have to rewatch to comment on the details unfortunately. Also, remember that the name of the show is Dexter. Maybe there were some continuing investigation after this part, but it just broke appart because the key proof was really the blood?"
Dexter,2fsl5t,qwedswerty,8,Mon Sep 8 10:05:37 2014 UTC,Another instance of an unfinished Quinn related story. Haha
Dexter,2fsl5t,veintisiete,2,Mon Sep 8 10:54:43 2014 UTC,"Did Quinn get his money from an inheritance, or was it from being a dirty cop when he took bribes?"

Dexter,2fsl5t,welshwordman,1 point,Mon Sep 8 11:27:40 2014 UTC,I was always super bummed that they didn't wrap this around and have Quinn come back into the fold more toward the end. It would've been way more interesting than the Brain Surgeon.
Dexter,2fsl5t,CSAman,1 point,Tue Sep 9 18:56:16 2014 UTC,I was kind of bummed by the whole change between Season 5 Finale and the Season 6 opener. So much changed with very little explanation.
Dexter,2fr0ub,ShaqTheDrink,21,Sun Sep 7 21:18:20 2014 UTC,Honestly being on this subreddit ruined my enjoyment of that season. People were calling out the Travis/Gellar twist after the first episode and the entire time watching the season that's all I could think of. I think I would have liked it a lot more had I not been on this subreddit when that season was airing!
Dexter,2fr0ub,OrderFromSnakes,1 point,Sun Sep 7 23:33:04 2014 UTC,/r/Dexter is the main reason I typically unsubscribe from a television show's sub until I finish the season.  I go on outside-information-blackout until I have made my up my own damn mind about what I think of it.
Dexter,2fr0ub,antigravity21,5,Mon Sep 8 15:04:59 2014 UTC,I thought it was ok. But IMO season 7 was so much better.
Dexter,2fr0ub,Szcynergy,4,Mon Sep 8 02:19:21 2014 UTC,"I thought it had some of the best guest stars of any season. With Mos Def and Colin Hanks both playing characters that I thought were way out of their comfort zones. I think the religion plot fell apart about half way through the season but overall it was enjoyable when I watched it, so I can't complain."
Dexter,2fr0ub,CFMoss,3,Mon Sep 8 01:19:39 2014 UTC,"why do you think mos def was out of his comfort zone? From what I've seen from his acting, it didn't stray too far away."
Dexter,2fr0ub,hendyhawk1234,1 point,Mon Sep 8 07:53:27 2014 UTC,"I guess I've seen him play an ex con in 16 Blocks and an alien in Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, but never anything religious like a preacher before."
Dexter,2fr0ub,CFMoss,5,Mon Sep 8 10:14:07 2014 UTC,"The big twist of the season was easily predictable. I know I had a strong suspicion after episode two that turned out to be correct. Otherwise, I felt it was by-and-large a re-tread of things that had already been covered — Dexter discovering that, wow, he really CAN feel things!, a villain who was decent enough but not memorable in any real way, gaping plot holes like Dexter seeing Gellar and following him into a building or Deb's promotion being handwaved away. The writing wasn't great, either, and the dialogue really suffered for it.  The major redeeming point of the season, IMO, was Brother Sam. Mos Def was a captivating speaker and it was a damn shame to see him written out so soon."
Dexter,2fr0ub,GivePopPopYourHair,4,Sun Sep 7 23:33:27 2014 UTC,"To be fair, if you watch the season again Dexter never once saw Gellar, I know the scene you are talking about, when they are in the car, Dexter is looking the other way, travis ""sees"" him then dexter goes to look but gellar is out of view, awful season but that wasn't a mistake"
Dexter,2fr0ub,GivePopPopYourHair,1 point,Mon Sep 8 02:56:57 2014 UTC,"Ah, that may very well be revisionist history. Cheers for the clarification."
Dexter,2fr0ub,iNachozi,2,Mon Sep 8 18:02:20 2014 UTC,Agreed. Brother Sam and Biney were the only good things about S6
Dexter,2fr0ub,nikkissippi121,4,Mon Sep 8 05:16:37 2014 UTC,"I loved it. I notice a lot of people didn't - mostly because of the incest subplot (which, I agree, was a little gross, but sort of made sense) and a lot of people said the Gellar thing (is this still considered a spoiler? I'm new to the subreddit) was predictable and many of them knew very early in the season. I had no idea what-so-ever, and neither did my parents, until maybe the episode before the finale, so it made for a really good season. I loved the religion theming, too - defenitely and interesting twist. Plus, the ending of the finale was just ""whoa"". XD Like any season, it had it's good and bad points, but it was one of my favorites, frankly. /endrant"
Dexter,2fr0ub,Eimona,7,Mon Sep 8 00:55:43 2014 UTC,"Generally considered the worst season behind 8, I agree, the acting was really bad (""hello, whore"" yikes"") the big twist was awfully executed, dexter's inner monologue was at it's worse this season, Dexter was just fucking retarded (he sent a fucking video message to travis saying he was going to kill him, dexter would NEVER do that), it introduced the awful, unneeded incest sub plot, the cinematography was poorly done, the soundtrack and score were underwhelming and all in all the only important thing to come out of this season that actually plays a role in the rest of the show are the final minutes of the season finale"
Dexter,2fr0ub,TheAlexBasso,7,Sun Sep 7 23:31:03 2014 UTC,"I just looked up the ""Hello, whore"" scene and it made me lol a lot more than it should have."
Dexter,2fr0ub,Mevansuto,8,Mon Sep 8 00:31:05 2014 UTC,"I think his acting was supposed to make you feel uncomfortable. Not because he said it very devilishly or girzzly, but because Travis was so fucked up he just said it very matter-of-factly."
Dexter,2fr0ub,MrWestx,0,Mon Sep 8 04:04:49 2014 UTC,Pretty sure it was just a badly written character and Hanks wasn't directed well enough to know what the fuck he should be doing
Dexter,2fr0ub,sweatymannipple,3,Mon Sep 8 13:20:01 2014 UTC,God it's even worse than I remember.
Dexter,2fr0ub,pooticus,2,Mon Sep 8 00:56:09 2014 UTC,Funny you should think that. Many think it to be the worst (after season 8).
Dexter,2fr0ub,united1020,2,Sun Sep 7 21:25:57 2014 UTC,"I enjoyed season 6, too. I think that whole religion-theme added a good atmosphere to the season. Of course there are some dumb things (e.g. Brian returns) but I liked it."
Dexter,2fr0ub,Psychotron7x2,6,Sun Sep 7 21:43:21 2014 UTC,"I really enjoyed Brian's return. I can't recall why, but it left me with a good feeling, and it seemed fitting. Dexter was going through an identity crisis of some sort, and couldn't rely on his father."
Dexter,2fr0ub,bigL162,4,Mon Sep 8 01:58:13 2014 UTC,"Dude that was my favorite episode of the whole season.""Nebraska"" showed us what it would be like if they actually teamed up."
Dexter,2fr0ub,elligre,3,Mon Sep 8 03:01:58 2014 UTC,"I enjoyed the religious tones as you mentioned and the huge villain shocker, coupled with Deb's big realization made this a very enjoyable season for me, not as incredible as Season 4 but certainly one of my favorites.   Also a huge fan of Colin Hanks and it was great to see him in that role."
Dexter,2fr0ub,prestico23,2,Sun Sep 7 21:52:14 2014 UTC,"I agree with all criticisms people have mentioned about season 6 but my biggest complaint about this season is that they stopped trying to make Dexter explore his inner demons in an interesting way. When he drowned Brother Sam's murderer in the water and gave in to his dark urges they showed his dark passenger for the first time, manifested as Brian. I thought the rest of the season was going to be Dexter throwing the code away and follow his evil urges for the rest of the season until it caught up with him.   Instead he sees the error of his ways immediately in the next episode and Brian goes away forever. What a waste of an opportunity. The rest of the season focused on catching Travis, who everyone knew was the killer and none of the audience gave a crap about. Too predicable and not enough originality. Very boring season to sit through."

Dexter,2fr0ub,Schikierski,1 point,Mon Sep 8 10:52:40 2014 UTC,"I definitely didn't mind season 6, perhaps because I watched it after the fact and didn't know about the Gellar twist until it happened. It's not my favorite season by any means but I'd put it above 8, and 5 and just under 3. I'm not a huge Colin Hanks fan but I thought he played the role fairly well. Like most, I wasn't a fan of the half-dropped incest subplot but it could have been much worse"
Dexter,2fr0ub,Insloxnia,1 point,Mon Sep 8 15:15:38 2014 UTC,"Season six would have been a real treat if it weren't for some glaring plot holes.   For one the Travis/Gellar thing was poorly executed. Travis, with the way he was portrayed the entire season should have gone mad and upset that he killed Gellar instead of immediately turning into a bad guy. Maybe it would have been better that Travis found out he killed Gellar, ran to his sister, confessed everything and his sister would call him out on being a monster and that'd send travis over this edge. That would have made him a believable nutcase.    Mos Def should have been on longer, and his death should have happened maybe in episode eight or nine wherein you'd have Dexter suddenly get a crisis of faith.   Bryan should have stayed on in Dexter's head for a lot longer and get Dexter to turn to the dark side for a bit. You could have dedicated an entire episode of Dexter stalking a kill with the sole purpose of breaking the code and at the end he couldn't go through with it not because of Harry but because of Harrison and he'd resolve that he wouldn't believe in a higher power but doing what he can to not give his son the dark passenger.   The incest arc...ehh. Its been done before where the step brother and sister become lovers but it was sudden and the relationship was already defined and to turn it around and attempt to make it a romantic one is a bad move in general. I think Deb's therapy should have come to the conclusion that she admired her brother and that all  this time, she wasn't impressing her dad but was trying to live up to her brother and that the he's the one thing that keeps her level headed. She'd be comfortable with the knowledge that her and Dexter are blood regardless of their origins until everything is shattered when she sees Dexter kill Travis."

Dexter,2fsii3,united1020,3,Mon Sep 8 08:24:07 2014 UTC,"Favorite Quotes:  “He doesn’t have a family.”  With Harry trying to push the question of Dexter’s decision to have a family so much how did I not see the foreshadowing of the season finale?  “I’d rather risk them knowing the truth, than lose them.”  This is a huge step for Dexter! He genuinely cares for Rita, Astor, Cody, and Harrison and does not want to lose them.   Other Thoughts:  Dexter gets three days all to himself, so great to see the old Dexter back again!   As soon as the Trinity Killer sees Lundy he rushes right over and bumps into him to have an interaction in person. I just wonder why he would do something like that?   In the restroom with Zoey, Dexter shoots down all the places she threatens to shoot him with his knowledge of blood spatter, able to know how his death would be solved."
Dexter,2fsii3,kingkoons,3,Mon Sep 8 08:24:43 2014 UTC,"for you second thought, i'd have to say that Trinity knows Lundy doesn't know. He's basically saying haha after all these years i was inches away from you and you'll never know. One of the reasons Trinity was such a great villain was he exhihbited so many textbook behaviors of a real psychopath. This was one of them. They often like to be in control of everything and know As much as possible. They love to flaunt their victories. This is why most seriel killers get caught. they keep flaunting and taunting. This was Trinity's way of establishing in his mind, the victory over the detective. He also shows remorse, PTSD, and bi polar tendencies. he was so complex but more than that realistically complex.                                                                                                                                                               EDIT: Used the wrong word at the end there"
Dexter,2fsg5o,united1020,3,Mon Sep 8 07:36:59 2014 UTC,"Favorite Quotes:  “…if you want I can go stick an ice pick in his head.”  The Trinity Killer convincing this woman to jump, without physical force is creepy as hell.    “…but I’m happy the killer chose this city”  Lundy, come on man, you’re a professional dealing with a prolific serial killer. Just wrong.   “It’s my community.”  Dexter really hates his neighbors.   “The neighborhood shithead.”  Dexter does not cuss as much as his foul mouthed sister but when he does I love it.  Other Thoughts:   There is a scene where Dexter watches his neighbor playfully push Cody into the pool, Dexter looks around to see how the others react before reacting himself. This is just one subtle instance I think Michael C. Hall nails exactly how someone like Dexter would act.   While on probation from driving Dexter suffers through “Karma Chameleon” by Club Culture. Damn that song is annoyingly catchy!   I have to sympathize with Dexter, that neighborhood would annoy the hell out of me.   Woah! While reading of a list of cities Lundy believes the Trinity Killer has visited, he lists Louisville, my hometown!"
Dexter,2fsclu,united1020,1 point,Mon Sep 8 06:33:39 2014 UTC,"Favorite Quotes:  “If they find Bennie in my car, its lethal injection time.”   Reminding us just how easy it would all be over for Dexter with one slip up.   “…and if you smell me again, I’ll punch you in the throat.”   Always will love the banter between Deb and Masuka   “Turns out all that cream cheese wasn’t doing anything for my cholesterol.”  The relationship between Deb and Lundy was always strange to me, I thought the chemistry between the actors was good, but a lot of reason is due to the age.   Other Thoughts:  When the cop looking over Dexter’s car after the accident and comes over to Dexter lying in the ambulance, mentioning how he found something, a bag. Only to reveal it was Harrison’s medicine is nerve racking!  Arthur Mitchell sitting at the outdoor area, only to spot the next victim in his cycle, and stand up to follow her, casually discarding of his paper is so creepy and great.   Dexter having to investigate his own crime to find where he hid Bennie’s remains for proper disposal was interesting!   Dexter drinks a Red Bulltm in this episode, and several mentions of an iPodtm last episode. Product placement at its finest.   First time I have ever noticed this! When Rita comes to visit Dexter at work after she discovers the severity of Dexter’s accident the baby in the stroller is fake!   Vince Masuka is the first to pick up on the LaGuerta/Angel relationship, everyone always overlooks him it’s a wonder how much he actually noticed and picked up on…"
Dexter,2fs9vb,united1020,3,Mon Sep 8 05:48:21 2014 UTC,"Favorite Quotes:   “Tonight’s the night…”   Does this ever get old? Such the perfect transition from Dexter Morgan, family man, to Dexter Morgan, serial killer. Also Rita utters it when breaking out candles and such for a special night with Dexter.   “…the perfect husband would have gotten rid of his old apartment. But I kill people.”  Perfect Dexter thought banter on display.   “Wanna know a secret? Daddy kills people. Real bad people""  Watching Dexter admit to his son about being a serial killer as a baby is just priceless.   Other Thoughts:  Michael C. Hall, the fact this will probably be his most memorable role is certainly a good thing he plays the role to perfection.   Despite usually hating LaGuerta personally, I am already remember liking her this season, specifically the relationship with Angel Batista. Also, her and Deb actually are getting along.   Anton is John Diggle if there are any Arrow fans!  Quinn is still fairly new, he was a roller coaster character for me throughout the season, and although he starts off the episode as an asshole to Dexter, I forgot that Courtney Ford plays Christina Hill, his love interest. Damn lucky guy.   Dexter sets up his kill room in an old boxing area, going down for me as one of the best kill rooms ever.   Finally, John Lithgow, although he doesn't say much and we see a lot of just his butt this episode, we already know he is going to be most likely greatest foe, as Lundy speaks of his long list of murderous accomplishments. What a great choice for the role."

People dislike it because the finale, as well as the entire last season was at best poorly written and at worst it was laughably bad.  An awesome show like that deserved to go out much better than the way it did."
Dexter,2fow0y,rhcp88,6,Sun Sep 7 04:08:44 2014 UTC,"The problem with the ending wasn't a matter of whether or not it made us feel good, the problem was that the entire execution of the final season was absolute garbage, starting with skipping ahead six months after the last incidents of Season 7."
Dexter,2fow0y,timmehfx,3,Thu Sep 11 21:18:05 2014 UTC,"Giving him an unhappy ending was about the only thing the ending did right, illogical plot devices like Dexter being able to walk Deb out of the hospital without anyone noticing and a general lack of plot in the whole of the season is why I didn't like it, it was more of the whimper at an end of a terrible series than anything the episode itself did that made it bad."

Somehow, nobody noticed that he had done this so nobody would have seen her die or known that she was dead. So she would have just been listed as a missing person. Her body would have never been found so, according to any remaining family and friends, Deb is missing, not dead."

Dexter,2flqyd,Nichase,2,Sun Sep 7 04:04:18 2014 UTC,"I liked the ending. Dexter is secluded and has no one relying on him. This both protects the remaining people he cares about (namely Harrison, but also Hannah, Astor and Cody, etc.) while allowing him to continue existing and even killing (although it must be hard to find proof now; maybe he's no longer following Harry's Code?). It was a shock, definitely, but I think it's really fitting."
Dexter,2flqyd,nikkissippi121,0,Mon Sep 8 00:58:54 2014 UTC,Why would people expect a good ending to a show that should never end?

Dexter,2fjbvu,bruddahmacnut,9,Fri Sep 5 23:07:17 2014 UTC,"I like to think he was so full of rage, he said fuck the code (or didn't think about it) and just didn't care... he just left the body as an unsolved murder."
Dexter,2fjbvu,Sillycomic,9,Fri Sep 5 18:25:37 2014 UTC,"Agreed. This kill was honestly the epitome of who Dexter really is. He is a serial killer, and gets the urge to kill. This kill was meant to help show that deep down, without the code, without everything Harry has taught him, this is what he would be doing... and he would be caught very quickly because of it.   Every other kill Dexter dealt with was without emotion. Cold, calculated, exactly what Dexter was used to. This kill was the opposite. It was hot, it was quick, it was messy.   I imagine this is the same as a dirty junkie who normally is so cautious and careful now goes dumpster diving for his next fix.   I would also like to point out there while Dexter's DNA evidence is at the crime scene, and possibly a fingerprint... Dexter isn't in any of the known systems they would use to check these. Most DNA and fingerprints are from known criminals who have committed other crimes. (even if he was, I imagine Dexter would be smart enough to make sure he is not in these systems)   Dexter, to all of our knowledge hasn't even been arrested. (He was held by police at the end of Season 4, but I would assume since they had other police officers get him off, he was never processed or anything)   So, while there may indeed be an unsolved murder, there isn't really any way to tie it to Dexter without linking him to the scene in some way.   But, it is sad that it's never mentioned one way or another. I think Dexter having to somehow fix this one simple mistake that took him over the edge would have been a great season honestly.   The fact that it was so important to Dexter's arc and yet gets barely any screen time is unfortunate. It was truly the beginning of the end for the series."
Dexter,2fjbvu,hotelindia,3,Fri Sep 5 19:55:54 2014 UTC,"I would also like to point out there while Dexter's DNA evidence is at the crime scene, and possibly a fingerprint... Dexter isn't in any of the known systems they would use to check these.   I'm not positive on this, but I believe that as a crime scene investigator, Dexter would have his DNA on file in case of accidental contamination of samples. I think at one point it was mentioned as a plausible way to explain away any of his DNA that turns up at one of his murder scenes."
Dexter,2fjbvu,Sillycomic,0,Fri Sep 5 20:16:59 2014 UTC,"I was thinking about that as well. If it is mentioned in the series it wasn't very clear.    Although by the time you go out to season 5, things get less and less clear so that might have something to do with it."
Dexter,2fjbvu,greenblues,1 point,Fri Sep 5 20:55:13 2014 UTC,"am I crazy, or didn't they match his DNA one time ---and then Dexter killed them ORRRR just erased it from the computer (his Asian friend can't think of the name... Masuka or something) :l"
Dexter,2fjbvu,kleiner352,2,Sat Sep 6 03:37:45 2014 UTC,"Actually you might be thinking of, when in season 1, the ITK leaves one of Dexter's victims at a crime scene (the guy who was committing human trafficking and killing immigrants who wouldn't pay him) and they found traces of M99 in her system after noticing the injection point in her neck.  Dexter remarked at the fact that it's a highly controlled substance and he was using the fake name of Dr. Patrick Bateman to acquire it (which was a nice little American Psycho reference, by the way) and then went into the file that Masuka had of all known purchasers, knowing it would come up as a bullshit name, and erased it, using the excuse of needing to check his email and his computer being down to explain why he was on his computer."
Dexter,2fjbvu,TheHellFish,31,Sat Sep 6 21:17:40 2014 UTC,"You didn't miss anything. Yes, it's a plot hole. I like to pretend that he cleaned it up before he left."
Dexter,2fjbvu,DivineJustice,12,Fri Sep 5 09:44:55 2014 UTC,I always figured he just split and the random nature of the crime left him unconnected to it in any detectable way. Also just because we don't know what happened doesn't mean it's a plot hole. Plot holes are things that contradict other things.
Dexter,2fjbvu,PiTheKhoz,1 point,Fri Sep 5 22:53:58 2014 UTC,"This, exactly. It was some bathroom in the swamps, no one gives a crap anyway. As far the Police or the people nearby are concerned, this probably isn't particularly out of the ordinary."
Dexter,2fjbvu,ccc66,1 point,Sat Sep 6 06:01:43 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't consider it a plot hole. We established that Dexter is a forensics expert and that he knows how to clean up crime scenes. Using this logic that the show has given us it's easy to assume he cleaned it up. There's no inconsistencies.   Edit: Clearly some people disagree with me. I know 'plot hole' is a great buzzword to use, especially when we want to hate on seasons 5-8, but in this case it's incorrect. A quick google search will show that."
Dexter,2fjbvu,CivilianNumberFour,3,Fri Sep 5 20:58:55 2014 UTC,He wasn't the clerk. He was just some low life who probably wouldn't be missed by too many people. Dexter touched only the boat anchor he killed him with and no doubt dumped him far into the ocean.

Dexter,2fhx20,GammaGames,1 point,Fri Sep 5 02:47:59 2014 UTC,I understand ur point but if dexter was to die on screen they would have to make it look like all his other kills looking  into their eyes a the life ran out the cycle of a killer being killed him an deb both killed innocent people la guerta and dex he killed a few people through out the series that he shouldent have
Dexter,2fhx20,Nathan_reynolds,5,Fri Sep 5 22:50:53 2014 UTC,I don't understand what you're saying.
Dexter,2fhx20,daleksareannoying,-2,Sat Sep 6 15:38:48 2014 UTC,Well thats probably because i wasnt commenting to you. But my point was the ideal death on screen for dexter is for him to die while the camera looks him dead in the eyes as he sunk that what he did to all his victims
Dexter,2fhx20,Nathan_reynolds,3,Sat Sep 6 23:14:12 2014 UTC,"I can still read every comment and yours, meaning I should be able to understand, so that doesn't really make sense. The reason your comment is confusing is because it is one grammatically incoherent sentence."

Dexter,2fhx20,ChiliFlake,1 point,Fri Sep 5 15:58:35 2014 UTC,"The idea of WHERE Dexter ended up--doesn't bother me as much. But the I just felt the handling of the plot got too messy in season 6,7,8.   There was so much momentum for Deb catching Dexter in season 5, but that plastic sheeting cover up felt so much like Showtime telling them not to do it just yet (to buy more seasons, I assume). And the whole season 6 didn't really drive much plot forward. I think end of season 5 should have been the Deb catches Dexter, and season 6 becomes the end game with LaGuerta catching on. A lot of tension--but it just got distilled and ANOTHER serial killer story in season 8 and it just wasn't good."

I don't know what it is about her but every thing she stands for and every thing that happened to Dexter makes no sense to me at all and just seems unlikely. Like I was okay for him feeling ""love"" or something for Deb but you're telling me this person who he's had a violent history, brings nothing but trouble in to his life and just came back to use him shows up and they fall in fucking love are you kidding me? and then he leAVES HIS SON WITH HER?

Lieutenant died and she was very nervous about Dexter, and instead of looking into it more after her mysterious death, everyone just kind of...let's it go.    The last season should've been the cracks forming in Dexter's ironclad defense. It should've been his desperate attempt to stay hidden and come to terms with what he was as Deb was slipping more and more into a complete meltdown over what she had done.    Instead, we got his dipshit girlfriend coming back, his son tripping on a treadmill, and some of the biggest cop outs in a show I have ever had the displeasure of watching."

I definitely was not expecting it."

But simply because having him tied to those kids and his own son after she went just made it really boring. We hadn't had enough establishing of his character before it all got into relationships and kids.   I agree with the other comment about Brian. It's almost like the series happened the wrong way round. Debs should have known in series one. Then maybe the Trinity killer should have killed her. Then Dex goes off the rails. That's when Doakes stuff happens. Then after his clever escape from that (perhaps using a better antagonist than Lila), at his most dangerous and morally corrupt he meets Rita. Then it's all about them and Paul and stuff for a bit but then Biney rocks up and everything goes horribly wrong. Perhaps he kills Rita.   Then final series is Biney's death then they find all the bodies. And Dex is about to get caught or killed but at the last second he gets away and he gives that look to camera  with a slight smile and no lumberjack.   Ok so I've suggested a totally different plot there.   But yeah, no knocking up Rita might have helped."

Dexter,2fei5z,Irongawd,5,Thu Sep 4 00:30:06 2014 UTC,Dexter dies at the end.
Dexter,2fei5z,Irongawd,3,Thu Sep 4 03:27:40 2014 UTC,"I don't exactly know the seasons by number(in regards to the events) anymore.  However the season that depicts Deb developing feelings for Dexter was actually one of my favorite plot ideas. It was in some ways so twisted, yet at the same time it almost made sense for them. The Morgans were such a screwed up dysfunctional family.  A young boy whose mother is killed in front of him grows up in a foster home that helps hone his sociopathic tendencies to become the perfect serial killer. A daughter that lived all her life trying to impress her family only to find out that her role models were rather dark people.  Deb relied on Dexter for everything, and her love for him made sense.  So at the very end of that season (After Deb has confessed her love) and she finds out that Dexter is a serial killer. That was almost the height of character tension out of all the seasons combined. Someone that we know Dexter won't just kill/die off finds out his secret. However this person is also battling the feeling of being in love with him.  So then enter the season with Hannah Mckay. A lot of people didn't like her character. I however just felt that she served a poor role.  I felt with her introduction, the more interesting element of Deb's confused and screwed up love for Dexter went on the back burner before dying out entirely in favor of building Dexter's relationship with Hannah.  Hannah was the perfect introduction needed, yet served the wrong purpose. Her character should have been exactly as she was, a woman that was a killer that could accept Dexter for who he was. Yet as they grow closer and closer, and his relationship with Deb becomes more and more difficult because of that, Dexter finds himself battling his dark passenger telling him to kill Hannah because it is the ""Right"" thing to do.  Gradually Dexter comes to the realization that no matter how perfect things may seem with this woman, as hypocritical as it sounds, he could never find himself with another killer. As in Dexter's twisted sense, killing is wrong, and he kills for justice.  So this ultimately leads to Dexter revealing to Deb that he can't be with Hannah because she is a killer. Deb finally is happy that they see eye to eye on something.  Hannah finds out Dexters' intention to split with her, and in turn poisons Deb.  Dexter kills Hannah in front of Deb, and saves her life. Deb in a brief passion kisses Dexter, forcing all of the convoluted emotions that have been building up in her for the past two season to be forced to be addressed.  However before either of them have much time to think about it, Laguerta is on to Dexter.  The season finale consists of Deb revealing to Dexter that she wants to be with him, and that she knows it's fucked up, but she wants more than their brother-sister relationship.  Dexter says he needs time to think. The episode carries on as Dexter mulls the prospect over in his mind, not really believing he is agreeing with the idea. The quote from the very first episode coming to the forefront of his mind. ""I don't have feelings for anything, but if I did, I'd have them for Deb.""  So Dexter agrees to try this strange relationship with Deb.  Then the same beats play out as the final scene is Deb killing Laguerta to save Dexter's life.  However now the context to it is drastically different. Dexter just killed Hannah and admitted to Deb that he could never be with a killer, no matter how perfect things were, nor how hypocritical it sounds.  Deb wanted a relationship with Dexter, which Dexter has since agreed- up until the point she killed Laguerta. Now Deb is a Killer.  So then we go into a final season. Dex found a perfect lover in Hannah, yet killed her because she was a killer. Could he do the same to Deb?  This also frees up the Hannah episodes in the next season. Instead I'd have those used to showcase more of the distance between Dex and Deb.  Deb was forced to kill for Dexter.  Dexter can't love a killer.  Both of them are disgusted for one another, and they both know the reasons why, and they both feel at fault for their actions. They know the relationship they were about to start could have worked if that one night had went differently.  Mid-season finale finds Deb on Dexter's table. Here Deb asks Dexter if he  feels anything about this moment.  Dex replies that the thought makes him feel empty. He brings the knife down hard and the screen cuts to black.  Mid season promo doesn't show a single scene with Deb in it, almost suggesting her death. However it does show a lot of the force catching on to Dex.  However you find out upon the return that Dex didn't kill Deb. He admits that the thought of her(or Harrison) not in his life made him feel empty, and lost. Yet he loves her and could never lose her. (That sound sappy written out here, but dialogue would obviously need to be changed.)  So they return try to fix the pieces of their strained relationship and romance.  They return to Miami metro, and in their absence Bautista has gotten hot on Dex's heels.  The second half of the season is Dex desperately trying to cover his tracks, as he tells Deb not to get involved.  Dex gets backed into a corner by Miami metro.  And the season finale would be Deb using her sway in Miami Metro to get Dexter out of the crosshairs, putting them both in jeopardy.  The final scene of the series would be Dexter reenacting the intro, and a throwback to the pilot(with donuts).  However things are different. It adds in him waking up out of bed alongside Deb. Cooking more food for Harrison, and Deb.  And as he steps into the building, Deb is already there. On the wall they have pinned the murder of Laguerta and others on someone Dexter was looking into.  You get a satisfying but foreboding ending. The two character don't necessarily have a happy ending. It is more one of survival, and blending in with camouflage. Yet you see that this is the new face of Miami Metro. One where the head uses her own rank and pull to cover up Dexter's tracks."

Dexter,2fei5z,kibblepigeon,10,Thu Sep 4 19:27:14 2014 UTC,"Dexter didn't have the need to fulfil his dark passenger's deep-seated desire, having being born in blood, to rid his unquenchable thirst by killing the immoral .... but rather through ultimate speed walking/treadmill championships as shared with coach, and the later fellow rival, Debra Morgan."
Dexter,2fei5z,Seiyith,-12,Thu Sep 4 19:43:34 2014 UTC,Oh thank god a treadmill joke I was worried we would go an entire thread without someone repeating it for the umpteenth time

Dexter,2fei5z,gerrettheferrett,2,Thu Sep 4 04:55:26 2014 UTC,"I would have liked to seen the episode ""Nebraska"" to sort be the beginning of Dexter's downward spiral as he finds it harder and harder to resist only killing other murderers which would eventually lead to him accidently killing someone important to him and segue to his arrest/manhunt. Edit: a word"
Dexter,2fei5z,xerophyl,3,Thu Sep 4 21:32:42 2014 UTC,"Minor thing, a segway is something you ride. A segue links two situations together via a smooth transition."
Dexter,2fei5z,Iceman-79,11,Wed Sep 3 23:35:03 2014 UTC,Maybe the man just wants a segway manhunt chase scene.  Is that too much to ask?

Dexter,2fei5z,nikkissippi121,2,Thu Sep 4 00:00:36 2014 UTC,"Maybe just go a bit further back and not have Brian meet Deb, or not date her.  Then Dexter wouldn't have been compelled to kill Brian.    I'd replace Miguel Prado with Isaak Sirko in season 3.  Isaak would be brought in to fight in a drug war in Miami.  Instead of killing his lover, Dexter would investigate the Koshkas and find that Isaak is the head of the brotherhood.  This is stemming from Isaaks comment to Dexter about how under different circumstances they would be good friends."
Dexter,2fei5z,NJS212,2,Thu Sep 4 00:03:50 2014 UTC,"Never kill off Doakes, keep him around similarly to what happens in the novels to provide a constant tension to Dexter being found out. But, no need to turn the guy into a walking horror show that communicates with a keypad, that's just cruel."

Dexter,2f5hpz,Pyloink,25,Mon Sep 1 07:38:38 2014 UTC,"There were plot problems and inconsistent character issues, but what made me really dislike it was that it didn't feel like a finale. It lacked any of the weight and build up that should accompany a final episode. Not until the last 15 minutes did it really feel like it was wrapping stuff up. It's probably unfair to compare anything to Breaking Bad, but that show had a very clear build to the final episodes, and the finale was heavy and meaningful. They should bring back Dexter just to finish it right."
Dexter,2f5hpz,KurtToons,14,Mon Sep 1 12:27:53 2014 UTC,"Dexter limped to the finish line and was put out of its misery.  Breaking Bad raced to it.  I mean, even Seasons 1, 2, and 4 did the ""amp up to the finale"" thing really well (particularly 2 and 4). Season 8 peaked around episode 1 or 2, ran out of steam, and barely made it."
Dexter,2f5hpz,StickerBrush,2,Mon Sep 1 15:39:44 2014 UTC,"Yeah, watching the final season of breaking bad really put things in perspective for me.   It unfortunately made it really easy to see the mistakes Dexter was making."
Dexter,2f5hpz,monstercake,2,Mon Sep 1 22:16:40 2014 UTC,I'd say that's fair. I just finished the last episode and it wasn't the best but I don't think it deserves the heat it gets.
Dexter,2f5hpz,cookiemountain18,2,Mon Sep 1 23:40:58 2014 UTC,"The actual ending scene isn't that bad, it's just bad in context of the final season.  The final episode has a lot of terrible plot and logical inconsistencies, and while it's not the worst episode of Dexter ever, it's the unfortunate culmination of everything that was wrong in S8. The final hour was never going to redeem it, but it was possible for it to stick the landing, somehow.  The sins of the final season are leveled against the finale now."
Dexter,2f5hpz,StickerBrush,11,Tue Sep 2 01:06:53 2014 UTC,"Hard to say much without spoiling, I guess that the reason was inconsistency of the main plot coupled with meaningless subplots and frequent usage of idiot balls.  Also, um, get out before you finish, spoilers everywhere. Literally."
Dexter,2f5hpz,TheHellFish,3,Mon Sep 1 08:42:32 2014 UTC,"Lots of problems with Season 8, but ultimately, the most frustrating thing is this:  if you watched episode 1 through 11, you would never guess it was the final season.  It's the most pedestrian season of all of them.    This show of all shows, the final season should have been massive ;("
Dexter,2f5hpz,TensionMask,5,Wed Sep 3 05:26:41 2014 UTC,"For me, the killer was the disappointment of seeing what looked like really promising, interesting, high-potential plot threads get wasted by having them mismanaged and ended prematurely. Then we spent an awful lot of screen time on boring B plots that didn't go anywhere either.   There were numerous instances of the plot only being able to move forwards because characters did blindingly stupid things or failed to notice things in plain sight. Then it all wrapped up with an unsatisfying conclusion where no-one really got any closure."
Dexter,2f5hpz,noggin-scratcher,1 point,Mon Sep 1 20:30:29 2014 UTC,"So agree. B plots and inconsistencies with characters.  My basic impression of the last season was that the writers were constantly fighting over what to do with the characters, how it should end, and all the other important stuff. It was like in the end they decided to throw in everyone's ideas in different ways.   I like to pretend the last few seasons don't exist so I can still consider myself a fan :x"
Dexter,2f5hpz,KintoUn88,2,Tue Sep 2 22:45:58 2014 UTC,"-It's a stand-alone season which makes no attempt to reference, explain, or conclude anything that happened earlier in the series.  -The final season introduces plot twists that are ignored an episode later.  -The writers and directors and even special effects people make no attempt to hide their laziness."
Dexter,2f5hpz,-iamthebuddha-,1 point,Mon Sep 1 21:12:14 2014 UTC,"So since it's a standalone season, is it worth it to even watch it? Or should I just watch season 7 and ignore season 8's existence?"
Dexter,2f5hpz,GrammarWizard,5,Tue Sep 2 00:24:33 2014 UTC,"I could never do that. If you can legitimately just ignore it then sure, but I have to finish a show, regardless of how bad everyone says it is.  EDIT: a letter"
Dexter,2f5hpz,YarharALC,3,Tue Sep 2 00:55:42 2014 UTC,I just finished it the other day. I'll be honest here: It was better (for me) to have the crappy ending than no ending.
Dexter,2f5hpz,KintoUn88,2,Tue Sep 2 17:45:41 2014 UTC,"Yes. Ignore. You're still free, start running away."
Dexter,2f5hpz,KintoUn88,1 point,Tue Sep 2 22:46:51 2014 UTC,"Im halfway through season 3 but seeing all the negativity toward the later episodes honestly makes me want to see them more.  Also, does it ever get as good as the season 1 finale or should i keep expectations low?  Please refrain from spoilers"
Dexter,2f5hpz,somewherein72,2,Sun Sep 7 20:31:57 2014 UTC,"It absolutely gets as good as the season 1 finale. My personal favorites are 2 and 5, so you have a lot to look forward to.   I honestly try to only think back to those seasons with Dexter because 7 and 8 were very disappointing and felt very disconnected from the other seasons. Overall the writing wasn't as good and the way some of the characters change felt off for me. But I understand your temptation to watch so you can make your own decision about the finale."
Dexter,2f5hpz,Acidic_Jew,2,Tue Sep 9 01:33:42 2014 UTC,"Short answer. The show runners had it in their mind to give closure to every character on the show, when they should've been concentrating on the title character. This resulted in the creation of new characters that had no bearing on the outcome of the series and a weak storyline which felt as if it were phoned in to a third grade elementary school."
Dexter,2f5hpz,jmcgit,2,Thu Sep 4 10:27:01 2014 UTC,"Minimal action, minimal tension, minimal conflict, in a show that was driven by conflict, external and internal."
Dexter,2f5hpz,Dispersions,4,Mon Sep 1 22:40:19 2014 UTC,"Basically people were expecting an epic, climactic season like what Breaking Bad had, and instead received a mediocre, run-of-the-mill season (and the weakest yet) that didn't really even think about wrapping up the series until the last couple episodes.  Allegedly Showtime wanted to have room to continue the series if MCH had a change of heart and/or the money was right.  MCH confirms he's done and they have to scramble."
Dexter,2f5hpz,jmcgit,0,Mon Sep 1 13:57:27 2014 UTC,Dexter's finale was way before breaking bad ended...
Dexter,2f5hpz,Hunt5man,-1,Mon Sep 1 14:55:54 2014 UTC,"The final seasons overlapped, but yes Dexter ended a few weeks before Breaking Bad.  Doesn't really have anything to do with my point, though, Breaking Bad was an example of what Dexter fans were expecting.  They may not have been able to cite that specific example going into the season (though personally, I was confident that they were on the right track), but they were expecting one big climactic season where shit hits the fan and everything crumbles down."
Dexter,2f5hpz,hytone,3,Mon Sep 1 14:58:39 2014 UTC,"If I recall correctly the breaking bad finale aired 1 week after the dexter one, and that was what made the dexter finale so painful for me because when the next week I watched the breaking bad one it made me realise just how weak Dexter's was."

It was at that point that I was so on board for the mentor-mentee dynamic being the center of the rest of the series. I thought that's what they were going to do with Dexter's legacy, since that's what the advertisements were hyping up."

Dexter,2eoi5w,Notsoh,5,Wed Aug 27 23:08:31 2014 UTC,Reminds me of when he was getting real excited over the Ice Truck Killer's work and started feeling up Rita in the car while describing it to her.  Hilarious.
Dexter,2eoi5w,AlWinchester,-4,Wed Aug 27 21:14:42 2014 UTC,That describes the general nature of man and women.
Dexter,2eohqk,EndlessKillz,5,Wed Aug 27 00:31:45 2014 UTC,"I just finished the season 8, my only problem was the U.S marshal just happening to over hear Batista, just happening to walk to the asylum, just happening to know Elway, too much coincidence for my taste"
Dexter,2eohqk,Simi510,4,Thu Aug 28 02:43:45 2014 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. I loved the entire show, until the last thirty seconds' lumberjack bullshit. So I chose to believe that the final thirty seconds don't exist, and that Dexter died. End of story. I thought the rest of the finale, and the show for that matter, was great."
Dexter,2eohqk,Cshock84,5,Wed Aug 27 21:36:33 2014 UTC,"I've read reports that this was the original plan, and Showtime meddling insisted that Dexter be kept alive as it would then be easier to continue the franchise down the road."
Dexter,2eohqk,jmcgit,4,Sat Aug 30 17:08:44 2014 UTC,"Great show, just watched the whole story in about 4 weeks. If you got this far, yes SPOILERS. It was in the thread title. Deal with it if you continue to read.  I loved the show, but there was a point that got just down right contrived. Dexter kills the guy is the church. Deb helps cover it up. Sure, seems all good. Story is progressing nicely, everyone thing is making sense mostly.   UNTIL, fucking LaGuarta somehow sees a blood slide in a floor vent? Uh, talk about low hanging fruit, and I mean super easy cop out bullshit. How in the fuck did she just see that shit? The whole scene made it look so shitty,. After that scene, I gave up and just needed to see the end. And it sucked. Yeah, Dexter, offing his sister and walking out of a hospital with a body under a sheet and on to a boat. NO QUESTIONS ASKED....  THIS IS HOW YOU END IT?"
Dexter,2eohqk,wasdy1,3,Fri Aug 29 05:42:56 2014 UTC,"When I was watching it I started to get the feeling that the writers were angry at the fan base for some reason and were trying to progressively hurt and confuse us more and more with each scene. Deb gets shot-Holy fuck she's going to be ok!  Deb isn't going to be ok- at least Dexter is going to get away! Dexter kills Deb and decides they should be buried at sea together- tragic but beautiful in it's own way, Dex believed Harrison and Hannah would be better off without him, I kinda get it! Dexter somehow survives and is a lumberjack in an undisclosed location- FUCK THIS SHIT! I really enjoyed all 8 seasons of the show (with 3 and 6 being the low points for me), but the finale seemed like a big middle finger to the fan base."
Dexter,2eohqk,chronicwisdom,2,Sun Aug 31 15:14:29 2014 UTC,Totally agree on the walking out of the hospital with a body and no one questions it.....I feel like the writers got lazy and rushed it..

Dexter,2ejm7p,Pete_Worst,3,Mon Aug 25 17:39:11 2014 UTC,"The original showrunner said on Reddit after the finale that his ending would have shown that the whole show was basically Dexter remembering everything from his seat in the execution chamber, with all the other surviving characters watching as he was executed."

Dexter,2ejm7p,karmapuhlease,2,Tue Aug 26 20:07:03 2014 UTC,"I've had this discussion a lot.  I really enjoyed season 5 and thought the tone/pacing was perfect to follow the shocking finale of season 4.   The thing I would've done differently was to have Deb discover Dexter at the end of season 5 (that situation reeks of Showtime telling them they couldn't yet because it would kick off the end game, rewatching that season it seemed clear that's what would happen, but it didn't).  Then season 6 the stakes are raised and you have a similar Deb/LaGuerta situation that we saw in season 7, but a year earlier, instead of wasting 11 episodes on nothing to GET to the Deb sees Dex. And maybe end it on a high noted season 6 rather than throwing in some filler and more serial killers (Miami has a serious serial killer infestation)"
Dexter,2ejm7p,welshwordman,2,Wed Aug 27 20:53:39 2014 UTC,"My handful of changes to Dexter post-season 4:   Merge the Lumen and Hannah characters into one. Not a biggy, but I think this series suffered from an overabundance of characters. Cut one of them out. Even if you have Lumen leave in Season 5, you can always bring her back.  Midway through Season 5, have Dexter commit a sloppy kill that leads to suspicion from Miami metro. Whether it's a blood-slide or any other piece of evidence that could link him, do it. As Season 5 moves on, LaGuerta and Deb slowly become suspicious, both remembering that Miguel Prado and Dexter were great friends. Make Miguel's murder comeback and haunt Dexter.  Deb catches Dexter/Lumen at the end of Season 5. That's the final scene of the season.  Merge Seasons 6 and 7 into one final sixth season. The plots of Season 6 and Season 8 really did not matter towards the end game. Season 7 was a strong season even with its flaws. In the first half of Season 6, have one final bad guy that's eliminated. Save the second half for a manhunt of Dexter that results in a final solution to the show."
Dexter,2ejm7p,NJS212,2,Mon Sep 1 03:30:21 2014 UTC,He should never end up as a lumberjack. He should have died or been imprisoned.
Dexter,2ejm7p,DarylsCrossbow,1 point,Tue Aug 26 00:34:29 2014 UTC,Death would mean he wouldn't need to suffer for all the death and pain he has caused. And a show about a serial killer... just ending up in jail? Is that supposed to be original or creative in any way?
Dexter,2ejm7p,alina_314,1 point,Tue Aug 26 01:08:44 2014 UTC,"Death would mean his character arch is truly finished with no ambiguity, and it's ultimately what he deserves - the same fate as all his victims. Jail would have been fine as well, he is still suffering for all the pain he caused and he could end up running shit in there lol. But seriously, you honestly think the way they ended it was the best possible way?"
Dexter,2ejm7p,Slaytounge,0,Tue Aug 26 01:53:45 2014 UTC,I just think death or jail would have been too easy to write and too expected. I prefer to be surprised.
Dexter,2ejm7p,alina_314,1 point,Tue Aug 26 11:32:47 2014 UTC,"I agree with this. Death punishment feels a bit cliché. I'd like to see him go crazy and hide or something. Actually, if we just summarized the key points of the end season it's pretty decent. Everybody he loves dies because of him but his son and his true soul mate Hannah. He hides himself after finally been lifted from the curse and realising that he's poision to every relationship that he has. A final act of selflessness and guilt. Overall it's not a bad ending at all. It was just something about how it happened that didn't make it work as well as people were hoping. In some weird way I also like to think about Dexter as invincible, but maybe that's just me."
Dexter,2ejm7p,qwedswerty,1 point,Sat Aug 30 15:33:09 2014 UTC,Her being Captain Morgan alone is better writing than the ending.
Dexter,2ejm7p,wato89,1 point,Sun Nov 23 11:00:25 2014 UTC,I think the show would have been great if they had just never had 6 or 8 and ended it with Deb shooting Dex at the end of Season 7.

Dexter,2ehi70,RLLRRR,7,Mon Aug 25 04:16:16 2014 UTC,It would have opened up a multitude of complexities on how he dealt with her passing. But then he had tons of relationships afterwards that it completely eradicated the meaning of her death. Especially when the kids were completely retconned.

Dexter,2ehp4m,Fitzelli,7,Mon Aug 25 01:31:10 2014 UTC,Step 1: Don't turn Dex into a fucking lumberjack.
Dexter,2ehp4m,Cyan-Eyed452,5,Fri Aug 29 09:27:04 2014 UTC,"Season or just final episode?   Season: Without writing too much about it, I would pick Season 8 right up where Season 7 left off. Investigation of LaGuerta's crime scene. Investigation continues and by the fourth or fifth episode, Miami metro figures out Dexter's secrets and a manhunt begins. The series ends with Deb killing Dexter. Not too detailed. I would not introduce one new character this season. No new bad guy. It's Miami metro/Deb vs. Dexter. I know they did that in Season 2, but that's the only way you could have ended it.  Just the final episode: I'd keep Deb alive. No Lumberjack madness. Dexter doesn't ditch his son with a woman who's a serial killer herself. One scene I add for sure is some type of montage of members of Miami metro finding out about Dexter being a killer. Even if the current final episode had at least confirmation Miami metro figured it out, it would have ended on a better note for me personally."
Dexter,2ehp4m,NJS212,2,Mon Aug 25 03:26:16 2014 UTC,"Dexter is assumed dead out in the hurricane and Miami Metro somehow finds evidence and realizes that he's a serial killer.   Dexter claimed that he didn't feel the urge to kill anymore and to me the whole ""I'm destroying everyone i love --> Lumberjack thingy"" doesn't make any sense since the killing is what got his loved ones killed and that he doesn't need to anymore.   Also Batista and Quinn (the people finding the evidence) decides to destroy it since it would be the biggest fail ever and would ruin Miami Metros entire reputation to have the biggest serial killer working among them. (a longer part of the episode is dedicated to them). Deb still dies.   It all ends with Dexter meeting up with Hannah and Harry in Argentina, and maybe he gets mad with his killer look on someone walking by them but as the person walks past his family Dexter's eyes stops at them and he realize that his new life has begun."
Dexter,2ehp4m,Farm_the_karm,1 point,Mon Sep 1 19:24:29 2014 UTC,"Dexter hears a snap outside. The moon is nearly full and the snow is crisp enough to crackle beneath your feet. A low gurgle resonates from a nearby shadow. Dexters eyes narrow as he scans for the source of the sound. It's hard to locate because Dexter hears the echoes around him.   Dexter takes a cautious step forward when a chill races up his spine jolting his nerves and seizing up his muscles. He tries to swallow. Dexter realizes he wasn't hearing echoes; he's surrounded.   Three sleek, hungry wolves close in around Dexter as he eyes an axe back towards his cabin. A larger wolves steps between Dexter and the life he was starting for himself. Several miles away a deer lifts its head from water and perks its ears. The faint resounding of Dexters final moments warrant little else before the deer resumes drinking."

It's just nature's way."

Dexter,2eejug,Yosheth,19,Sat Aug 23 23:41:12 2014 UTC,"Both Dexter and Hannah (with Harrison) are in different places in the world. We know that when Hannah says this line, Harrison & Hannah are in Argentina, while Dexter is (so we assume) somewhere in America. It reflects on how Dexter had two separate lives; the one that made him normal, and the one that gave him the need to kill. Argentina represents the normal side of Dexter, being a family man and caring for Harrison. We can see that after Rita's death, Harrison (along with Deb) become his number 1 priority. That being said, Argentina also represents happiness, a new beginning and hope. In the season where Hannah gets taken away by the police (season 7???) she explains that Argentina was something that she looked forward to, as a new beginning to get away from the old life with Wayne Randell and to be with him (much like how she's going to be with Dexter in the same place, but the plan fails - yet again. Possibly hinting that not everything is as perfect as it seems, or how plans are easier said than done).   The line ""let's go get some ice cream"" is something that every child would love to hear. Children love ice cream, and they'd see it as a happy thing - a happy memory. Hannah is protecting Harrison from the truth (or so, the truth) of what really happened to Dexter. Hannah is caring for Harrison, and it's seen as something a family member would do (back to how Argentina could represent family and happiness).   Personally, I think that this is a good line to end the season. Better than Dexter having some monologue in his cabin or whatever. His silence really gives emphasis on just how isolated he really is in the world, especially as towards the end of the show, Harry said ""you no longer need me"".   Edit - the final line could also be Dexter's last wish - for Harrison to have a happy and easy life."
Dexter,2eejug,DanniiTheFannii,7,Sun Aug 24 02:59:24 2014 UTC,"I love you :) I feel very alone in actually liking the ending of Dexter. I don't understand why people are so unhappy with it. To me, it was perfect. I assume most of the people who don't like the ending just can't empathise with the feeling of 'I'm no good, everyone is better off without me'. Thank you for explaining this the way you have :)"
Dexter,2eejug,ana-mia,2,Sun Aug 24 11:21:33 2014 UTC,"Thank you!  A lot of people have different outlooks on the ending. I finished it about a week ago, and was told that the ending was going to be really bad. I must admit, I thought that it was a nice way to wrap everything up. The look in Dexter's eyes also hints at the possibility that he's still killing. To the audience, he's still the Dexter we know, but it's the Dark Passenger Dexter instead of the one constantly feeling pressured to do things. Perhaps Rita's death and the loss of Aster and Cody hinted at the possibility that this was going to happen, that he was going to lose everyone because of who he is.

She leaves, with the assumption that she realises that he will never get there. She also shows that she will take care of Harrison. She doesn't show any resentment or anger towards the child, nor happiness. She accepts the situation she's in. This also symbolises Dexter's sacrifice, and that it atleast was correct to leave Harrison with Hannah, if he's going to leave him with someone."

Dexter,2e9pun,kootchi,2,Fri Aug 22 17:18:38 2014 UTC,How large is a large quantity?  Some of these crime scenes have a lot of blood.
Dexter,2e9pun,KrustyFrank27,1 point,Sat Aug 23 00:48:05 2014 UTC,More than 20 ml of blood
Dexter,2e9pun,Buttered_Penis,2,Sat Aug 23 03:17:29 2014 UTC,Many of those crime scenes easily top 20ml
Dexter,2e9pun,Buttered_Penis,2,Sat Aug 23 03:58:54 2014 UTC,"In total, yes, but he studies individual ""spatters"" on the walls and floors to determine how shit went down. There could be a total of 50 ml, but it could be 10 individual spatters consisting of 5 ml each.   If we're getting technical, I guess you could say he studies both."

Dexter,2e9pun,oh_no_aliens,0,Sun Aug 31 20:21:14 2014 UTC,"While you're absolutely correct in your definitions, my only point was that, as far as I can tell, the proper title of a forensics investigator doing bloodstain pattern analysis is a blood spatter analyst. Hell, I didn't know the difference until that episode where Sirko sternly corrects his colleague–was it the strip club manager? I just found it amusing that the show's description includes a minor mistake that is addressed and clarified within the show itself.  It would kind of be like IKEA teaming up with HBO to release a set of collectors plates, each featuring the sigil and words of one of the main houses of Westeros, and the Lannister plate saying, ""A Lannister always pays his debts."" It was clarified within an episode that it's actually, ""Hear Me Roar,"" and the former is just a common misconception."
Dexter,2e9pun,the_dooler,1 point,Sat Aug 23 01:09:40 2014 UTC,"There's also the fact that blood spatter analysis is a field of study. In everyday grammar I think the distinction is pointless, but I don't blame Dex for correcting Sirko."

Dexter,2e61oo,Moronoo,9,Thu Aug 21 14:12:18 2014 UTC,That would definitely be an interesting twist haha. So basically Masuka would rape people who deserve it?
Dexter,2e61oo,Nothox,5,Thu Aug 21 16:24:11 2014 UTC,only rape people who rape other people?
Dexter,2e61oo,PhoenixTwonkie,4,Thu Aug 21 16:53:19 2014 UTC,Exactly...and him being Masuka would make it creepy and awkward enough that the rapists would reform on the spot or commit suicide.

Dexter,2e5brm,turntechDestiel,1 point,Thu Aug 21 05:16:47 2014 UTC,"I actually wrote a Dexter fanfiction where I went through exactly how I imagined Dexter covered it up. If everything had gone according to plan, it would obviously look very clear to the police that they killed each other, but instead, it was Debra that killed LaGuerta with her own handgun provided by the police. Ballistics could've easily figured that out, so I think Dexter must have gotten rid of the bullet and bullet casing that actually killed LaGuerta and fired another bullet with the correct gun through the pistol hole (the same way he did with Estrada's stab wound.)"

Dexter,2e1tsm,GlaciersMoving,6,Wed Aug 20 21:40:11 2014 UTC,"All you need to know is that the entire show was based on a serial killer trying to remain anonymous and live amongst normal minded people.  The last episode convinces him that he can only bring pain to those he loves and he, as a serial killer, does not deserve a happy ending.   So he selflessly banishes himself to become the animal that he's always resisted being, leaving all those he cared about safely behind.  I also am in the minority of loving the show's ending, so I'm sure I will receive disagreements."

Dexter,2e1tsm,r0addawg,2,Wed Aug 20 14:18:51 2014 UTC,"As most commenters have been saying, I feel like you're barking up the wrong tree with this one. Here's why:  -The first screenshot is explicitly used the imagery of the mirror to symbolize Dexter's many roles. The second screenshot does not seem to be that explicit. I would guess that if it were a callback to Season 4, then it would be another obvious shot of a mirror (with ghost Harry or voice-over).   -Even if the shot from season 5 was legit symbolism, where's the rest of the mirror imagery throughout the show? There is none in the rest of season 5 through the end of season 8 (almost 4 seasons). It would be pretty shitty of the writers to think that they had a motif of reflections going on, if half the show ignored that motif. In other words, if the final scene was a callback to reflections, then why weren't the viewers prepped for it with more shots of Dex and mirrors?   Good effort though! You are looking for the right kind of technical cues to find themes in shows. However, based on the quality of the latter half of Dexter, I don't think you'd have much luck finding any real ones. :("
Dexter,2e1tsm,UNAMANZANA,2,Thu Aug 21 03:35:22 2014 UTC,"Interesting theory. I commented on another post just a second ago with way too much analysis. Admittedly, it wasn't too top because it's 4:00 over here, but nonetheless.   In the post I recently commented in, I mentioned something about Dexter not having any final lines in this scene. I think it links in nicely with what you said about him just being on his own and as one person. The fact that he doesn't say a word also emphasises that he's even more alone because there's no sound, there's nothing. It's just him in a log cabin and nothing else."
Dexter,2e1tsm,DanniiTheFannii,2,Sun Aug 24 03:03:00 2014 UTC,"I agree with one of the others, that the mirrors in the room are totally intentional (and I hadn't noticed). But I don't believe they intentionally made further links in your other screenshots."
Dexter,2e1tsm,andrewthemexican,2,Sun Aug 24 13:44:24 2014 UTC,I agree that you're really reading into things... but I love it! :) It's actually a really neat way to look at it all.
Dexter,2e1tsm,nikkissippi121,1 point,Mon Sep 8 01:27:21 2014 UTC,"I think basically Deb was what allowed Dexter to feel human. Deb was the one person who was consistently in his life and who he had genuine feelings for. Before Deb died, Dexter was at a critical point where he was in love with someone and was fully prepared to give up killing because he didn't need it anymore. When Deb died, I don't think Dexter wanted to be a normal person anymore. He says he's afraid that he'll cause the demise of Hannah and Harrison too, but I think he's terrified of feeling that loss again. When we find out he has survived, he's kind of an entirely different person. It's hard to say if he reverted back to full psychopath, or if he's stuck in his own personal hell, continuing to feel that loss forever. Based on his face, I'd say the latter. So basically Dexter chooses to turn away from killing, but because of this, he's stuck dealing with pain that he doesn't know how to handle properly."

Dexter,2dt66s,scorpio245,3,Mon Aug 18 04:14:14 2014 UTC,"Having recently finished watching Dexter too I understand where you are coming from. For me, the reason that I watched Dexter was because of the intrigue that came from the show revolving around a serial killer that was a blood spatter analyst on the side. When Rita died that came to an end and the show became about a blood spatter analyst that was a serial killer on the side. I felt that it fell into a slow decline after the second episode of season 5, with the first episodes being among my favorites in the series as a whole. The show became much more of a family drama, what with Astor and Dexter's relationship falling apart. In my opinion what they should have done is had something happen that risked Dexter being caught, not like Laguerta going after him but more like the whole department going after him like in S2. That would have forced the show to be about Dexter's ""professional"" life rather than his personal life."

But if you watch breaking bad over again and look at things from Skyler's perspective, she's not nearly as annoying. Walt went off the deep end quickly and when you consider what he's doing from an outside perspective I think she responded quite well according to societal norms."
Dexter,2dt66s,terriblehuman,4,Mon Aug 18 04:08:12 2014 UTC,"Exactly. Though, it is definitely a testament to how good the show's writing was that we can root for the guy who's cooking meth, and root against his wife because she's fed up with his lies."

Dexter,2dt66s,charlesthe42nd,0,Thu Aug 21 06:08:13 2014 UTC,"This is true, and a lot of conflict could have been avoided with more avid communication of feelings on her part. But consider what she was witnessing- she figured out it had something to do with drugs pretty early on, so she was likely suspecting for a while that Walt was involved with something illegal. So she may not have been acting completely rationally, but reasonably for all the emotions she was experiencing - fear, distrust, anger, sadness."

Dexter,2dt66s,jarwastudios,2,Sun Aug 17 22:47:19 2014 UTC,I'm with you. I liked her at first when she was kinda awkward and socially broken. Somehow she went from that to blonde uptight trophy wife that only seemed to exist to bitch at Dexter.

Dexter,2duqyg,TheWalkingTroll,2,Mon Aug 18 03:47:40 2014 UTC,I say a bit of both. It's still enjoyable. Watch it and then form your own opinions. Don't give up on it if you never gave it a chance.
Dexter,2duqyg,Slaytounge,1 point,Mon Aug 18 03:57:09 2014 UTC,"Watch the whole show, the story doesn't end after season 4 so if you enjoy all the seasons then watch them, but there is a reason why people don't hold seasons 5-8 in such high regards compared to 1-4, the show seems to lose some focus and makes some plot decisions that many of us weren't fans of. It's not bad it's just not what it could have been.   With that said, Season 5 Episode 1 is one of my favorite episodes."
Dexter,2duqyg,kingkoons,1 point,Mon Aug 18 04:56:01 2014 UTC,i loved season 6. it was dark and gruesome and fresh. Season was good too but there was some mistakes. 5 wasn't very good IMO but it the most important for Dexter as a character so even that one was pretty good now that i think of it. 8 is the only one i didn't like.
Dexter,2duqyg,DaklozeDuif,1 point,Tue Aug 19 00:22:13 2014 UTC,I'd watch season 1-4 and then season 5 episode 1. After that everything just goes downhill. You should certainly not watch season 8. The writers didn't even try.
Dexter,2duqyg,Coooturtle,1 point,Tue Aug 19 15:05:24 2014 UTC,"Just no. It was still really good after S4, S8 was terrible tho."
Dexter,2duqyg,BroomPerson21,1 point,Wed Aug 20 18:15:09 2014 UTC,Season 7 was the best of the bad seasons.
Dexter,2duqyg,Slaytounge,-1,Mon Aug 18 23:27:29 2014 UTC,"This is like affirmative action. In your truly honest opinion, you think season 7 is better than 1 & 2? If it is and you're not just trying to balance the weight of the overall dislike of seasons 5-8 (season 7 is still regarded as good but generally not as much as 1-4) then my mistake."
Dexter,2duqyg,Buttered_Penis,1 point,Mon Aug 18 04:49:46 2014 UTC,"It's not as good, but it's still good.   Besides, you can't just stop watching a show part of the way through. You're really missing out if you do that.   Also, even if you don't like the later seasons, it doesn't ruin anything. People exaggerate like crazy when they dislike something. Nothing changes how good the first four seasons are. The content of the early seasons don't change. It's illogical to say they were ruined."
Dexter,2duqyg,terriblehuman,1 point,Wed Aug 20 03:10:09 2014 UTC,"Just see for yourself. Some people hate it, some people like it. I didn't think 5-8 were as good as the other seasons, but still good, and I wanted to see the story play out."
Dexter,2duqyg,fuckindexter,1 point,Thu Aug 21 02:55:59 2014 UTC,NO. I think you really should keep going. It's not like ''OMG those seasons are amazing'' but i think you should finish it. IMO season 6 is pretty good its worth to watch. but its your decision :)

Dexter,2dricn,terriblehuman,13,Thu Aug 21 02:50:36 2014 UTC,"I finished it earlier today and my gripe is that it's all completely out of character. Or rather, it fits perfectly with his season 8 character, which wasn't consistent with what he had been. Season 8 feels so different from the rest of the show, and it's a shame."
Dexter,2dricn,mawbles,10,Sun Aug 17 02:06:59 2014 UTC,Season 8 Dexter was sloppy and careless. Everything was so out of character for him. He also was a firm believer in the code and he allowed harrison to go with someone who could never help him survive if he ended up with his own dark passenger.
Dexter,2dricn,Bubble_Pop,4,Sun Aug 17 04:42:48 2014 UTC,"Help him with his dark passenger? Dude, she was probably going to poison Harrison's ice cream to get rid of him in that last scene."
Dexter,2dricn,Nothox,3,Sun Aug 17 05:30:00 2014 UTC,Exactly! Who's to say she won't get tired of Harrison and just poison him. Oh he's now a sullen pain in the ass teenager. Done! Stupid Dexter!
Dexter,2dricn,Bubble_Pop,4,Sun Aug 17 14:38:35 2014 UTC,"I just finished season 8 today too. I think the writers could have established what they did in S8 in a much better way (it seemed way too rushed). Although I still enjoyed the ending. It makes the older seasons that much more sad. The small glimmer of hope that Dexter could find a balance.  But in the end he accepts who he really is, and his loved ones would always pay for that."
Dexter,2dricn,kniny,1 point,Sun Aug 17 05:35:33 2014 UTC,"I thought it felt rushed, too. It might be because I watched four episodes today (I'm home sick) but it seems like so much random alloverthplace shit happened in the eighth season. Dexter started losing control, and then suddenly he was a lumberjack."
Dexter,2dricn,sillyribbit,23,Tue Aug 19 04:54:42 2014 UTC,The ending sucked.  No one will ever convince me otherwise.  Glad you liked it though.
Dexter,2dricn,rhcp88,10,Sun Aug 17 01:27:40 2014 UTC,Developing a conscience doesn't excuse what he's done? He destroyed hundreds of lives including Debs. All for his own hubris and obsession. Dexter dying was the only way to end the show. He had to be put down.  all imho
Dexter,2dricn,f0rmality,1 point,Sun Aug 17 01:11:24 2014 UTC,I'm not sure I follow how that he destroyed hundreds of lives.
Dexter,2dricn,terriblehuman,2,Thu Aug 21 02:49:22 2014 UTC,"Besides literally, he also took/destroyed the many innocent lives that were attached to those he killed. And those he wrecked by being the way he was - harry, deb, rita, aster, cody, doakes, angel etc."
Dexter,2dricn,f0rmality,0,Fri Aug 22 05:57:34 2014 UTC,That's why I said it's poetic.  Not realistic.
Dexter,2dricn,Sideshow_Slob,5,Sun Aug 17 01:13:28 2014 UTC,"I wasn't so much dissatisfied with the actual end (Dexter fleeing), but the ""buildup"" was just atrocious.  The completely pointless subplots (Masuka's daughter, the PI associated with Deb, Dexter training that kid, even Vogel was pretty pointless) made it hard to watch, then the ridiculousness of the main storyline finished it off.  Dexter rolls her out of the hospital and nobody cares, Hannah roams around near-freely without being recognized despite a Marshal visiting the house she was at, calm waters before a hurricane, Dexter suddenly being cured, Hannah moving in with Debra, Dexter somehow getting back to shore after riding into a hurricane, Debra trying to kill Dexter then immediately changing her mind, and so on.    And the missed opportunities, oh god.  LaGuerta's death (which was also done in a horribly disappointing fashion) was rendered absolutely meaningless when Angel tossed those warrants aside early on in the season.  It didn't even feel like Dexter.  It was like Dexter was suddenly being written by bad soap opera writers."
Dexter,2dricn,DuncSTL,2,Sun Aug 17 16:17:43 2014 UTC,"I just finished watching last night, and feel the exact same way.  I was so disappointed in the writing - the last season was painful to watch.  Why did RIta's mother never come back after her death, oh I have so many unanswered questions.  Oh well, was a great journey... I just feel incomplete with the ending."
Dexter,2dricn,Sideshow_Slob,4,Sun Aug 17 17:43:00 2014 UTC,"Hadn't thought about that, but yeah.  And speaking of Rita, those flashbacks in season 5 completely conflicted with the first season.  She's this shell of a person in season 1 and they presumably had been dating for weeks or even months.  In the flashbacks, she's bubbly and cheerful on their first date.  I mean come on, her fragility is a point of emphasis for the entire first season.  Yeah, it's one of my favorite shows ever, but that makes the dismal ending all the more brutal."
Dexter,2dricn,dontyouleavemehere,2,Sun Aug 17 17:52:47 2014 UTC,"IMO, he chose the dark passenger over his family. That stare wasn't a sad stare, that was the post-kill stare."
Dexter,2dricn,terriblehuman,2,Sun Aug 17 21:30:10 2014 UTC,"I don't think that's true. I think Deb was so important to Dexter and the humanity he had, that when she died, he no longer knew how to be human, so he chose a life that isolated him from any social interaction."
Dexter,2dricn,TheDogsMeowww,1 point,Thu Aug 21 02:52:09 2014 UTC,Could be.  I got a more dejected/lost sense from the final scenes... but you could be right.  I know the books put him moving on ti Australia to keep it up.  Who knows.

Dexter,2dricn,guineapig_16,1 point,Sun Aug 17 09:14:31 2014 UTC,"I agree with you.  I think Dexter was meant to end up alone and having lost everything he ever loved.  He, by his own admission, was a monster.  And it was a fitting end to a monster… I didn't think the writing or the lead up was the best - I think it was sloppy; but I felt it was where his character needed to be.  Poetic is the word I would use, too."
Dexter,2dricn,TheExtremistModerate,1 point,Sun Aug 17 17:27:40 2014 UTC,I think the ending is something the character Dexter would never do. Before he would always look out for himself before anyone else and now he decides to do whats best for his family. Just isn't the true Dexter. Also I really hate how they tried to make Dexter more human and relatable. I much prefered him with no emotion or empathy.
Dexter,2dricn,terriblehuman,0,Sun Aug 17 21:12:06 2014 UTC,"The treadmill, though... The second half of Season 8 was pretty much just PIS."

Dexter,2dricn,sillyribbit,3,Sun Aug 17 23:19:17 2014 UTC,There's two extremes. A complete disney's happily ever after and a complete shakespearean tragedy.   I can see why they didn't want to be boring by picking either of those cliches.  Their solution was surprisingly that they found a third extreme - complete and utter stupidity.
Dexter,2dricn,terriblehuman,1 point,Mon Aug 18 03:48:54 2014 UTC,"I really did NOT want him to go on living happily ever after in Argen-fucking-tina. I wonder if he meant to survive the hurricane, though. I certainly didn't expect him to.

Dexter,2dpu9f,PresidentChef,8,Sat Aug 16 12:31:51 2014 UTC,Dexter was also the first show (in a long time) I watched from start to finish. I would recommend Breaking Bad since I rank it the best drama series ever created.

Dexter,2dpu9f,samarthur8,3,Sun Aug 17 03:13:25 2014 UTC,"IMHO to be fair, Game of Thrones can't be compared to Breaking Bad, because they don't fall under the same category. The first is mostly medieval fantasy and adventure (albeit with plenty of drama), whereas the later is pure criminal drama, much like Dexter. Having said that, I watched both and loved them all, just in a different way."

And everyone suddenly never mentioning LaGurta? And all of the new cops, i mean. Seriously? And the Hannah comeback, please. Everything was just perfect when she got to jail and Dexter was just thinking rational again. In season 7, i sort of liked seeing another side of Dexter when i comes to Hannah, but it should just have ended after she got in jail (or they should have hated eachother when she got out) Hannah just screwed up everything in season 8, what is it about this ""loving""-Dexter who does EVERYTHING for her, and even leaves Deb behind? I mean - ITS DEB. He shouldn't leave her, ever. Destroyed it all to me.   EDIT: I mean, i love this show so much, i guess i am just disappointed about the last season. God dammit."

As I recently just re-watched the entire series, I found many plot holes that either are ignored by writers, or just plain take me out of the story and piss me off.  I'm glad you mentioned the ""following too closely"" problem.  Looking back on earlier seasons, Dexter has always had this habit of tailing his persons of interest for miles and miles from just a few dozen feet behind, and the person is always none the wiser.  It is some grade-A, top choice, high shelf, cream-of-the-crop bullshit if you ask me."

Dexter,2dkxio,wil4,6,Fri Aug 15 05:27:32 2014 UTC,"I understand that throughout the entire show you could find many things to nitpick about. But with season eight it goes far beyond nitpicking and goes into the realm of lazy writing. I'm not one to turn off my brain and enjoy something like that, I'm just a sucker for good writing. Once plot conveniences start showing up just to push it towards an ending the show just becomes forced and predictable."
Dexter,2dkxio,caesar_primus,2,Fri Aug 15 06:29:02 2014 UTC,Yes it has. No it wasn't.
Dexter,2dkxio,michael73072,2,Fri Aug 15 10:52:07 2014 UTC,It was very solid until the last few seasons. Then the writers got very lazy.
Dexter,2dlphh,Aylapsz,6,Fri Aug 15 03:12:45 2014 UTC,"There are two ways to view the ending. The first is your view and the one that most of us (including me) see, that Dexter had an extremely disappointing and crappy ending. He  abandoned his son, went into hiding and what we were all waiting for.... He never got caught or died. The second view is that in the end he got what he wanted and chose his dark passenger over what was left of his life. Harrison was another liability and Hannah only brought bad news for him. Debra was a massive loose end who as we've seen earlier in the final season can and will let her emotions take over and possibly spill her guts. By leaving Miami and going into isolation, Dexter is free to embrace the true sociopath and killer he is without having to hold up appearances , getting in the way of his kills. The stare we see in the end is the post kill stare, a sign that he is still at work and considering where the fuck he lives, he can probably kill anyone without thinking twice or worrying about it."
Dexter,2dlphh,jmanning0236,4,Fri Aug 15 04:25:48 2014 UTC,"Wow. I never thought to look at it that way before. He DID chose his dark passenger over family and friends! So glad you opened my eyes to that second view, now I won't be as stressed out about the shitty ending. Lol thanks!"
Dexter,2dlphh,turntechDestiel,2,Fri Aug 15 05:01:20 2014 UTC,"There are, as previously mentioned, several ways to view the ending. It's all about your personal interpretation, I suppose. Now me, different from 99% of the fanbase, actually liked the ending. The last season in general was nowhere near good, but the ending redeemed it, I think. The fact that he dumped Debra on the sea was not out of spite or heartlessness. That's how I see it, at the very least. When Dexter has his flashback of Debra talking to him about the monsters on the wall is when he comes to the terrifying realization that he has broken the one person he loves the most in the entire world. Throwing Debra in the water was nothing less than a way of telling himself that, in the end, Debra had become another victim. He hates himself so much for what he's done, and to show that to himself as vividly as possible, he puts Debra in the same place that all of his other victims ended up. And then he tries to kill himself, but for some reason, he survives. Dexter is the only person Dexter cannot kill. So instead he isolates himself and his dark passenger in an attempt to punish himself. The writers actually confirmed this, I believe: The stare Dexter gives the camera in the end of the show is a look of constriction. He is trapped in his own hell, most likely for the remainder of his life."

The development between Dex and Rita was just so much more compelling and believable. Hannah was a completely unlikeable character in every way (excluding hotness factor).  There's also the fact that she is apparently the permanent caretaker of Harrison, who will never have anyone to tell him about his mother, and will probably never see his brother or sister again. Aaah so terrible."
Dexter,2dfe5s,dead-fan52,10,Fri Aug 15 06:44:29 2014 UTC,"Hannah.  She killed innocent people. Suddenly Dexter gave up the code just because she was hot.  I especially hated how he was about to kill her, but somehow he ended up having sex with her instead (and all is forgiven).  Bleh..."
Dexter,2dfe5s,sunshine_fairy,6,Thu Aug 14 07:59:29 2014 UTC,"Lumen. Not necessarily a bad character but I really disliked her arc and relationship with Dexter. It seemed a bit too contrived (which I know is ridiculous in this show but still). Also, there is the fact that I enjoyed almost every other character. Also, everyone new introduced in season 8 not named Zach."

Dexter,2db8nx,Slaytounge,2,Tue Aug 12 06:51:26 2014 UTC,Exactly. I wanted to see a bit more of that.
Dexter,2db8nx,asanimasa,1 point,Tue Aug 12 18:27:27 2014 UTC,You nailed it. The problem was not that they had a lot of screentime. The problem was that they did not share enough scenes with Dexter.
Dexter,2db8nx,Nebakanezzer,14,Sat Aug 16 07:01:31 2014 UTC,"I don't. every time they tried it was cliché and terrible. Angel and his wife, Angel and Leguerta, Ange not with Leguerta, Mesuka's random daughter because we need filler and lets make up some ridiculous sperm donor story to explain why he would have one in the first place, despite it completely contradicting everything about his character.  They are supporting characters for a reason, they support the main character. They were in depth enough to be fleshed out, but not enough to where it took away from the main story, which was fine. At the end of the day, this is still just his cover, and his ""friends"" are there for him to keep up appearances, and they are actively hunting him most of the time without knowing it. No need to draw away from that action with some nonsense about how Joey isn't getting along with his parents, or god knows what other crap they would have made up.  The one thing I would have liked is to have known a bit more about the one black lady that randomly became important in the later seasons, then seemed to disappear just as quick. I don't even remember her name, if it was ever mentioned, but she just pops up and says a line one episode, and you're left like ""who the hell are you, lady?"". I think she was also up for sergeant at one point in time as well, also kind of random and unexplained for some really really secondary character who has little to no back-story or importance to the station or dexter.  The addition of angel's sister was ok, Vogal was even a decent idea to an extent, their main crime IMO is not sprinkling in new characters throughout the seasons that would later become important. Vogal could have been a super crazy reveal and mindfuck had she appeared here and there and had some foreshadowing, but when someone just shows up in a season, having never been on the show before you end up assuming they're either going to be killed, are a killer, or are important to the plot some other way, it takes the drama out of it."
Dexter,2db8nx,Khal-Stevo,5,Tue Aug 12 07:06:46 2014 UTC,Agreed. They tried to introduce way to much backstory on the Vogel-Dex situation in season 8 and it just didn't work at all.
Dexter,2db8nx,quigglepuff,7,Tue Aug 12 13:31:21 2014 UTC,"You get to see it more in the first two seasons, specifically in Angel. That being said I really hated Quinn, his many story archs were a waste of time that added nothing to the show."
Dexter,2db8nx,Slaytounge,3,Tue Aug 12 13:22:39 2014 UTC,"Quinn was my favorite side-character, especially 3 & 4. He was the most ""normal"" person I'd say on the show - his character added more of a sense of realism in my opinion."
Dexter,2db8nx,franch,3,Tue Aug 12 19:17:47 2014 UTC,"I actually liked Quinn. His character was a hell of a lot more well-rounded than Angel or the others. Granted, he was a bit cliché (slightly dirty cop with a good heart), but I felt he was well-done."

Dexter,2db8nx,IronCupcake,2,Tue Aug 12 16:08:32 2014 UTC,"I wanted some payoff at least. We saw how dedicated Angel was to his loved ones yet he refused to take Laguerta's investigation seriously. Then Quinn suddenly becomes ambitious only to not make sergeant and promptly abandon his character growth. Of all the flaws with the end of Dexter, these were the worst. For 8 seasons they were the focus of mundane sideplots; the least they could do was affect the ending."
Dexter,2db8nx,General__Specific,2,Tue Aug 12 14:26:29 2014 UTC,"I feel liked they showed too much of the side characters in the wrong way. Throughout the entire show, they forced alot of character development into each side character that felt unnecessary to the plot. Every time Dexter would be in the middle of some crazy situation, the show would cut to some random encounter between side character A, and side character B, fixing their sub-plot problems. Examples being, the Masuka and his daughter thing, or the Batista and that cop he dated for a season. Those sub-plots really took me out of the show because they had nothing to do with anything. Lets say they show character development in the side characters like they did in Season 1, my favorite season, where each character would have a current or later effect on the plot and would actually interact with Dexter. I liked season one so much for many reasons, and this  being one of them. Having relevant and interesting characters without them being shoved down our throats really made the show seem better overall."
Dexter,2d9zyb,jmanning0236,48,Mon Aug 11 22:21:40 2014 UTC,Deb overcome by guilt turns her self in and confesses everything she did and everything she knows about Dexters crimes. Season 8 is a manhunt. Dexter fully gives in to his dark passenger because he cant easily track down other killers now. He uses the first rule of the code to justify this at the start but the dark passenger slowly takes over and he  kills anyone he can while trying to evade detection. There should also be a scene where he has the chance to say good bye to Harrison but the police are closing in and he has to decide between seeing his son for the last time or running. Because of the first rule (dont get caught) he runs. Leaving Harrison by himself in the middle of a mall or something. Im not sure exactly how it should end probably with Dex getting caught and the last scene is him either getting sentenced to death or getting a lethal injection.
Dexter,2d9zyb,Fuzzy-Hat,8,Mon Aug 11 23:35:38 2014 UTC,"I like all of this except I feel as though there should be a scene where he encounters Vince or Angel as he's running and he either comes close to killing them and then leaves or he kills them to cover his own tracks.  I also feel like the only person who doesn't want him to die.  Alternatively (and there's a million other possibilities that are probably way better), we see him alone in a shack from the real finale after all the lumberjack stuff, but then he comes out and we get a short montage of him going hunting.  Eventually, the 3rd or 4th prey he walks up to is a human, to which he just says, ""Whoops.""  He then interrogates the guy in one of his clean rooms about something awful he's done to which the guy says that his boss is behind everything and tells Dexter who his boss is.  We then see a boy ~13-15 years old come from behind Dexter and ask, ""So what'd he say, dad?  Are we all set?""  To which Dexter replies, ""Yup.  Tonight's the night.""  As he's about to stab the man they caught, he turns to Harrison and says, ""Actually son, why don't you give it a try?""  An excited Harrison then revels in his first human kill as his father watches.  A scream and a blood splatter are all that's heard before the credits.    Kind of overkill, but I feel like this ~10 minute scene (and taking Hannah out completely) would put a neat little band-aid over the wound left by the finale."
Dexter,2d9zyb,mightynifty,2,Tue Aug 12 07:42:53 2014 UTC,Holy shit that's fucked up... And infitintly better than the actual ending.

Dexter,2d9zyb,__ADAM__,10,Tue Aug 12 03:31:12 2014 UTC,A suggestion I have is to not completely disregard Batista and act like he was never an important character.  They did him no justice in season 8.  I always thought he would find out about dexter.
Dexter,2d9zyb,hectorzeroni69,3,Tue Aug 12 04:24:16 2014 UTC,"I was so sure he'd figure it out! The whole time, anytime Angel had a scene with Dexter I waited for him to see or say something. When LaGuerta was onto him and she told Angel, I thought it was the beginning of the end."
Dexter,2d9zyb,sillyribbit,7,Tue Aug 19 05:23:30 2014 UTC,"Not in season 8, but i was hoping in season 7, when LaGuerta was closing in on Dexter and she involved Matthews in her investigation, that Matthews would reveal to Dexter that he's known the whole time about who he is and that he purposely sabotaged LaGuerta's investigation so Dexter wouldn't get caught.  Then in season 8, Dexter is being chased by the police and people like Matthews and Deb and others from his past who know what he is are being brought in for questioning and are making deals to catch Dexter in return for their own freedom, partly at the behest of Dexter.  This leaves Dexter on the run and unable to trust anyone.  The FBI comes in and takes over from Miami Metro, and thus begins a season-long, nationwide manhunt, ending with Dexter getting caught and being paraded as the most prolific serial killer in U.S. history.  Show then ends with Dexter in jail on deathrow, and eventually the electric chair.  Final scene shows Harrison was left in Deborah's custody, but at the very end, he's begun showing signs of the same sociopathic tendencies as Dexter, and she realizes that the only way to save Harrison is to teach Harrison the code.    Thus beginning a new cycle of the warmhearted cop who wanted to save the sociopathic child by teaching him a code to protect himself."
Dexter,2d9zyb,skizofrenic,2,Sun Aug 17 09:47:39 2014 UTC,"Oooh, I like how it comes back around... Bravo!"
Dexter,2d9zyb,sillyribbit,19,Tue Aug 19 05:26:15 2014 UTC,I always thought Dexter should have died. I really wanted him to take a student that was better than him. The student should then remorsefully kill Dexter for breaking his own code. Dexter would accept it as the final training for the student. It would be a nice ending and leave a nice opening for a sequel starring his successor.
Dexter,2d9zyb,rhinojazz,6,Mon Aug 11 23:05:33 2014 UTC,"I really, really liked this guy's Season 8 re-write.  Personally, I like to imagine this is what actually happened."
Dexter,2d9zyb,Mrs_Damon,3,Sat Aug 16 17:40:19 2014 UTC,"I would have liked to see some killer come after dexter. Potentially someone his brother knew before he was killed, or someone who was a friend of doakes or laguerta(sorry for spelling..). The killer would have come after dexter not to immediately kill, but destroy his life. First he would start fucking with dexters friends/coworkers, maybe even killing one. Then he would leak to the police/press that dexter was really a killer somewhere halfway through the season. The second half he would be hiding out trying to think of a way out and to catch the guy etc. Then it would end similarly where debra or dexter dies."
Dexter,2d9zyb,kazuri85,2,Tue Aug 12 23:53:18 2014 UTC,"I actually really liked season 8, except the very final scenes.  I feel the story-telling was a little off compared to earlier seasons but it was still a great story.  I would have liked Deb to have lived and Dexter to have moved to Argentina.  It could have simply ended with him still struggling with the dark passenger or even his son starts killing small animals or something.  It was such an offbeat show that I would have been totally fine with him finding happiness.   I don't know, maybe the finale will grow on me as time goes on.    my girlfriend and I started watching the series Six Feet Under after we finished Dexter to get our Michael C. Hall fix."
Dexter,2d9zyb,wil4,1 point,Tue Aug 12 04:41:37 2014 UTC,I don't know why this finale got so much flak. I personally thought it was pretty decent. The only part I didn't like was Deb dying like that.
Dexter,2d9zyb,Elias_S,2,Tue Aug 12 05:25:41 2014 UTC,"The scene plays out the same, Deb dies by the hands of Saxon, and somehow dexter is caught, and punished for his crimes, and it turns out that every season Dexter was just telling his story, and the last scene they zoom out and he is about to be electrocuted or given a lethal injection. with some end line like ""the Dark Passenger can't be tamed"" something cliché. because in reality dex can't remove his psychopathy. maybe that would have been better?"

Dexter,2d9zyb,BeautifulKiller,0,Tue Aug 12 06:16:35 2014 UTC,"Everyone seems to want: a happy ending for dexter,  him dying from something, or getting caught. So ill make up all those 3.  Happy:  Deb immediately informs the P.D, everyone says thats impossible. Dexter catches wind, and he realizes its time to BOLT. He gets into gtfo mode and gets everything ready. By this time Debs going crazy thinking she cant wait for a warrant,  so she goes over to dex's to arrest him without one. But, coming back from shopping or something Hannah knocks her the fudge out. Dex gives her some tranquilizer so they get a little bit more time. When they leave the door, camera zooms in on her phone from Batista saying they got a warrant. Show ends with them either driving into the sunset or them doing ninja shit to Argentina.  Dex dies:  Debra shootd him instead of laguerta.  Joining aside, maybe he gets shot down running away with Harrison from the police. I dont know a good way to end him, just like the writers of season 8 who should have ended before.  Getting caught but not dying:  So here I think is my favorite one, as he gets caught, is happy, and doesn't die. Deb is super emotional from errthang, and dex doesn't know what to do, but is ready to bolt. A big case comes up, and its something from dex's past, lets have that crazy British bitch comes back. She is stalking dexter and all that jazz. He comes home to her playing with harrison, saying glad for you to join us. He doesn't want to kill her now, harrisons here! She says she needs help, and dexters the only one who can help her. He agress as his hands are tied. Think of a crime that would be death sentence able. He helps her do that, but nearing completion Dex is about to kill her so they dont do this crime. Right as hes about to kill her, the PD comes in and arrests them. Dexter gets a plea deal of life in prison, along with blaming hannah getting her in for life as well. The british ex gets death penalty since she had a record after dating dex. Harrison goes to deb, Dex is happy since he can easily kill people in jail and determine if they fit the code. Plus visits from Harrison if deb allows it or if its legally required."

I like to think that even El Sapo was killed by Saxon and Deb was framed by him, because honestly, that kill doesn't really make much sense as well. Where would Deb get a second gun? Was her arm scratched? Where did the jewelry go? Why would she take that (and forget about it), but not take her gun? Season 8 is a mess."
Dexter,2db9qn,TheHellFish,3,Tue Aug 12 08:21:53 2014 UTC,I was thinking joey did it the whole time. I see what you're saying. It didn't make much sense that deb killed him.
Dexter,2db9qn,qwedswerty,1 point,Tue Aug 12 16:18:36 2014 UTC,"When I watched it I was thinking that it was obviously Saxon. He's the only one with ill intent that knew about Zach in the first place. Right? I forget, since you're talking about Quinn, I'm guessing that he was following Dexter again or something? I can't remember that part of the season. Is it really there?  From a story telling perspective it doesn't seem to make sense that it would be anyone else, if it was Quinn, what did his suspicions lead to? Where were they going with that story line? Maybe I'm just simply forgetting too much from that season, but I can't remember Quinn being any amount of important to it at all."
Dexter,2db9qn,qwedswerty,1 point,Tue Aug 12 23:08:55 2014 UTC,Yeah but saxon killed zach anyway. Joey wanted to catch zach so bad to prove he was a good cop. Plus he had a shady past with the Russians

Dexter,2d9hdi,jmanning0236,9,Mon Aug 11 19:36:35 2014 UTC,"Season 1 will always be tops for me, it introduced me to everything I would grow to love about the show. It was fresh and exciting, the premise was so unique. The intro credits were unique, and the shows music was different but engaging. I've heard people say that they had figured out or guessed that ITK was Dexter's brother, the thought never crossed my mind so it was an incredible revelation. I had become a fan of Michael C. Hall from watching him in Six Feet Under, and was excited to see him in a new role. I thought Deb was a very fresh character. I know lots of people dislike her, but I have enjoyed her character through the entire show. She was completely opposite of every female character that I can recall at the time on other shows. To me, she was just plain fun. Her lines and character alone just made me have fun, on top of the great drama and serious matter. She's a great counterbalance to the shows darker themes. I had watched Season 1 on my computer, the season finished and I just sat in my chair in awe. I literally got up out of that chair, put my pants on, and drove to Wal-Mart to buy seasons 2, 3, and 4. Season 1 hit me that hard at the end that I knew I needed the rest. I appreciate all the seasons in their own way, but Season 1 will forever hold that charm and oddness that I recognized less and less as the show became familiar to me. The intro sequence wasn't special after a while simply because I had seen it plenty before, the music became just a part of the show, but for Season 1, it was all fresh and exciting to me."
Dexter,2d9hdi,Deezer19,6,Mon Aug 11 21:56:34 2014 UTC,"I loved S4 like everyone else, but you have to remember that the overuse of Ghost Harry and the appearance of meaningless plotlines started here."

Dexter,2d9hdi,MuchDance1996,6,Tue Aug 12 01:52:54 2014 UTC,I think season 2 is on the same level as 1 and 4. When they pulled those trashbags up out of the water my heart literally sped up and I've never had a show do that to me before.

Dexter,2d9hdi,prestico23,2,Tue Aug 12 23:56:48 2014 UTC,"S4 was definitely my favorite but I can see why people love Season 1. It's the one that started it all, and it's plot line is borderline flawless. Unlike most fans of the series, it took me a while to get into Dexter. It took me as long to finish season 1 as it did for me to finish seasons 2-5. Not sure why but I didn't really get into it until 6-7 episodes into it. In retrospect, after finishing the series, I can see it's brilliance but watching it for the first time, season 4 has an edge over season 1. I was more heavily invested in the fates of the characters. Also, the Trinity killer storyline was one of the greatest storylines I've ever seen on modern television. John Lithgow was simply tremendous and the final scene of the season couldn't have been more of a shocker. Unlike most people, I also enjoyed the interactions with Lundy/Deb/Quinn over the years and season 4 was a big part of that. (I know Quinn and Lundy weren't really simultaneous but separate arcs)."
Dexter,2d9hdi,sunshine_fairy,2,Tue Aug 12 01:45:07 2014 UTC,"Season 2 had the most suspense for me (which is why I like it best).  Pivotal moment for me: Dexter is being taken to Lundy and the blood slides, assuming he has finally been caught.  I was watching it on Netflix and for some reason the video kept buffering.  ""NOOO.  Please computer!  Have mercy on my soul.  PLEASE!""    It was torture..."
Dexter,2d9hdi,Szcynergy,1 point,Thu Aug 14 08:08:22 2014 UTC,"Season 1 would have been perfect if standalone is perfect, but I absolutely love season 4. The main reason for that is just the one episode of thanksgiving with the Mitchells, as well as just being crazy intense. I just feel like season 4 was more unique therefore I liked it more."
Dexter,2d9hdi,IronCupcake,1 point,Wed Aug 13 06:15:28 2014 UTC,"There's one thing about season one that pushes it WAY past season four, DEXTER MORGAN. Dexter, being the main character of the show, pretty much makes or breaks the entire show. So having a very mysterious and interesting Dexter, like in season one, made the show more interesting to watch. Dexter in season one was not as predictable as in later seasons, and he actually felt like a psychopath. The later seasons give Dexter alot of character development, which ultimately ends up making him less interesting and more relate-able. Giving characters development throughout a TV series is important, but this is a special instance where I think it hurt the show. For example, at the beginning of the show Dexter was very mysterious in that he could not form relationships with people very well, he was always pretending to be normal, and the show focused on him being a killer, which is why he actually KILLED people in this season. In later seasons, you see less of Dexter killing people and the voices in his head, and more of his relationships and how normal his life is becoming, this is what killed it for me. Don't get me wrong, the whole show is great, especially season four. Season four brought back the old Dexter in season one by having him be alittle selfish and not focusing on Rita as much. Dexter could be Dexter, which made that season work. But regardless, season one takes it for me due to the more mysterious and interesting Dexter Morgan."

My only problem with it was that it came way too late so it never had a chance to fully develop. I liked Hannah's return as well.

Dexter,2d68jh,mguniverse,11,Sun Aug 10 20:29:09 2014 UTC,"As much as the later seasons get a lot of hate, I think season 7 is criminally underrated. It's no season 4 but I'd say it's the 4th strongest season."
Dexter,2d68jh,prestico23,7,Mon Aug 11 05:44:29 2014 UTC,"I like season 7 more than season 4. It's painful to watch Dexter make the same mistakes that destroy his family, I can't do it. He does so many stupid things in season 4."
Dexter,2d68jh,ubiquitous_archer,5,Mon Aug 11 17:55:37 2014 UTC,I love season 7 just for the scene with Dexter and Isaak talking at the bar. Such a great scene.
Dexter,2d68jh,BeeGinger,19,Tue Aug 12 23:15:08 2014 UTC,I like this scene BC it's reminiscent of the old slightly crazy Dexter

I love the show, and I didn't finish it until about 2 months ago and was so excited to actually be a part of the community and didn't have to worry about spoilers! Now, the people saying the ending was bad are FAR worse than the ending itself. God people, there's self aware, and there's being annoying."
Dexter,2d68jh,KillerCh33z,-1,Mon Aug 11 06:01:03 2014 UTC,The Sargent storyline in season 8 was one of the most dull storyline in the history of television
Dexter,2d68jh,scarlotsky,4,Mon Aug 11 04:04:10 2014 UTC,If this clip went for a couple more minutes it would have been my favourite! The ah ha moment he has when he realizes he needs to practice what he preaches is brilliant. Can't remember the exact quote but I know it's in this scene!

Dexter,2d6uuq,terriblehuman,3,Mon Aug 11 01:07:12 2014 UTC,The brightest bulb? Absolutely not. But I have imagine even an average cop would at least be intrigued enough to follow up on it. Still an enjoyable season.
Dexter,2d6uuq,jmanning0236,4,Mon Aug 11 03:52:10 2014 UTC,"On top of that, there's the scene where Quinn is at Debs apartment when Dexter walked in and he said ""it's a little warm for gloves"" . Also when Dex kills Oliver Saxon and Joey reviewed the tape.. No suspicions Quinn? Really?"
Dexter,2d6uuq,Wisecan,3,Mon Aug 11 02:38:24 2014 UTC,"We can just write off pretty much anything from season 8. But the gloves, just another piece of the puzzle that apparently is outside of Quinn's age range."
Dexter,2d6uuq,Wisecan,4,Mon Aug 11 03:53:00 2014 UTC,Just wanted to add that I don't think Quinn was working in homicide at the time the Bay Harbour Butcher was being hunted down.
Dexter,2d6uuq,Derugo_,4,Mon Aug 11 18:22:49 2014 UTC,"Doesn't matter. It was a widely publicized, national case. He knew about it."

Dexter,2d6uuq,Derugo_,1 point,Mon Aug 11 18:42:31 2014 UTC,I don't think he would think twice about it. Even if it was a national case I really don't think he would remember the details since he didn't personally work on it. I doubt many people in real life would.
Dexter,2d7eih,General__Specific,5,Mon Aug 11 04:16:16 2014 UTC,"The last four seasons aren't that bad at all. Seasons 6 & 8 have some bad moment, but I think seasons 5 & 7 are very good."
Dexter,2d7eih,Crankrune,7,Mon Aug 11 04:31:24 2014 UTC,"Though 8 was pretty rocky, I still think Season 3 is the overall ""worst"".  Fuck Miguel, fuck the Skinner, fuck Key Lime Pie, it was just boring from start to end.  I had high hopes for Jimmy Smits joining the cast, but the result was just mediocre and way too predictable."
Dexter,2d7eih,prestico23,5,Mon Aug 11 14:50:55 2014 UTC,"I think it's a bit overstated how bad the last few seasons of Dexter truly were. It's clear to most that the peak of the series is Season 4 (with the preceding seasons being very good) and the rest is downhill. Personally, I thought 5 was pretty meh but I loved 7, and I honestly didn't mind 6. 8 was the only season I truly came away unsatisfied."

Dexter,2d7eih,Notsoh,1 point,Mon Aug 11 23:13:15 2014 UTC,"just finished the series and tbh, don't sweat it.   You will like the rest of the seasons (except maybe 8, I will admit it was a little ridiculous)   5 and 7 are probably the strongest out of the last 4 seasons but 6 and 8 both have their moments of decent to pretty damn good episodes.  keep watching"
Dexter,2d32no,emmapkmn,24,Sat Aug 9 18:11:16 2014 UTC,"Did you listen to his monologue shortly before boating into the storm? He is convinced that anyone close to him will end up hurt or dead, and so he decides not to bring that pain to Hannah or Harry."
Dexter,2d32no,mfranko88,12,Sat Aug 9 18:49:07 2014 UTC,"Which was kinda sad really, because over the progression of the series he was learning that perhaps he could control the urges, and that the Dark Pasenger was entirely his own creation, hence the decision to not kill Saxon, and let him die at the hands of the justice system.  Had Deb not died, he could have gone on to Argentina and started a new, normal life. Deb's death kicked him right back into monster mode during a fragile and optimistic state of mind, so he tried to kill himself by hurricane. Until that point, he really was on the edge of becoming a human being."
Dexter,2d32no,wil4,1 point,Sat Aug 9 23:48:35 2014 UTC,he faked his own death.  it's still possible he'll join them some day.  I like to think so.  a dexter movie has not been absolutely ruled out
Dexter,2d32no,turntechDestiel,5,Sun Aug 10 03:36:29 2014 UTC,"he faked his own death.   I'd say it was more a failed suicide attempt, myself. Maybe not though."
Dexter,2d32no,sillyribbit,4,Sun Aug 10 15:06:02 2014 UTC,"I love the idea of it being a failed attempt at his life. I think the writers themselves said that he did it on purpose, but I like the idea that Dexter tried to kill himself, but then he woke up on some shore with some cuts and bruises, only to be struck by the terrifying reality that he can kill anyone, even his sister, but he is unable to end his own life."
Dexter,2d32no,sormonsar,1 point,Sun Aug 10 17:17:27 2014 UTC,This is the conclusion I came to as well. Depressingly beautiful.
Dexter,2d32no,CoccyxCracker,1 point,Tue Aug 19 17:14:15 2014 UTC,This is an idea I've held on to since I finished the series. I'd love it to some.

Dexter,2d32no,Pointwest418,3,Sun Aug 10 16:11:47 2014 UTC,Some people just like to watch the world burn.
Dexter,2d32no,Pmp529,0,Sun Aug 10 19:33:10 2014 UTC,"But everyone close to his has died, and Harrison almost died in season 6.  Deb, LaGuerta, Harry, Doakes, Vogel, Rita, and a few more all died directly because of Dexter's Dark Passenger"
Dexter,2d32no,sillyribbit,3,Sun Aug 10 01:36:40 2014 UTC,Gotcha! I guess I blatantly missed that.
Dexter,2d32no,Pmp529,6,Sat Aug 9 18:57:55 2014 UTC,Because he thinks he will end up hurting them. I personally just like to think that he wised up and went to Argentina a week after the finale and met up with Hannah and Harrison.

Dexter,2d0l9d,flemhead3,5,Sat Aug 9 16:47:23 2014 UTC,Hahaha. Well I'm glad the writers dropped the whole love story thing they were trying to force into the series. I like how it happened after witnessing this too. That's two people who were secretly serial killers she's fallen in love with (and they just happen to be brothers as well.)

Dexter,2d2m1h,iFoxMSF,13,Sat Aug 9 19:28:00 2014 UTC,I took it as meaning Dexter would have a lot harder time hiding his dark secrets.

Dexter,2cyaa0,argonia,13,Fri Aug 8 04:27:27 2014 UTC,"I like to think she always kinda knew. She knew Dex's origin before he did, she wasn't an idiot."
Dexter,2cyaa0,quigglepuff,7,Fri Aug 8 09:26:10 2014 UTC,"Apparently, she realized that the Ice Truck Killer was Brian Moser, Dexter's brother, when she saw the news in the papers but at the same time, she didn't tell anyone else. She might also have unconsciously known or suspected that Dexter was a killer, hence the request to die at the hands of a friend. Just before she passed on, when she heard that Dexter was the one who killed his brother, she accepted the fact and praised him, saying that ""It's good... you did""."
Dexter,2cyaa0,CHEECHREBORN,8,Fri Aug 8 12:07:31 2014 UTC,"I think she may have suspected he killed Brian, but didn't know it until he told her. I think the reason she asked him to kill her was because she was devoutly Christian and couldn't commit suicide, and she knew he was an atheist, with no such religious compulsions. So she asked him to do it for her so that she wouldn't be sent to Hell for suicide."
Dexter,2cyaa0,TheExtremistModerate,6,Fri Aug 8 18:33:48 2014 UTC,I doubt it. But they never revealed any more details than that.
Dexter,2cyaa0,mguniverse,2,Fri Aug 8 05:48:42 2014 UTC,"It may have been suspected but I doubt she knew the whole truth. If you're thinking she asked him to do it because maybe she knew, that's not the reason. Dexter has made it known he is an atheist or is agnostic with no true belief one way or another. She figured it wouldn't bear anything on his conscience to fulfil a lifelong friends one last wish. I was surprised he had such a problem with it originally when she first asked."
Dexter,2cyaa0,Tightanium,2,Fri Aug 8 20:02:59 2014 UTC,"Well, as for that last part, Dexter may be an atheist, but he has a moral code. That's one of the themes of the series, that he's a serial killer with a moral code. And part of that moral code is to not kill people who don't ""deserve"" it. That is, people who have never killed before.  Camilla had never killed anyone, so killing her, even as a mercy killing, was against his moral code."
Dexter,2cyaa0,TheExtremistModerate,1 point,Fri Aug 8 20:18:05 2014 UTC,"No, I think the recent ""oh the adults always knew"" speculations are downright idiotic. He is a killer, and anyone in their right mind wouldn't just sit on it if they knew."

Dexter,2cr7lp,BlackCatScott,3,Wed Aug 6 08:55:50 2014 UTC,"I ended up watching season 7 all the way thru in 2 days, and I came to realize that some shows are kind of MADE to be watched week apart per episode or two. You need the full week to get the impact of some of the moments, feel the turmoil, the WTFness of a situation.   You just dont get that when you see a cliffhanger episode, then it's resolved within 7 minutes. Lot's of shows are like this, where a lot of other shows are becoming much more enjoyable when you watch like 3-4 episodes in a row, like Parks and Rec, Always Sunny, etc."
Dexter,2cr7lp,dizzlerrr,13,Wed Aug 6 06:42:38 2014 UTC,"Season 1: Loved it, got me hooked  Season 2: Got really involved and loved it  Season 3: Hated it.  Season 4: I really enjoyed it  Season 5: It was okay, but I didn't like some of it.  Season 6: I enjoyed it quite a bit. But some parts were kind of dumb.  Season 7: Arguably one of the best seasons IMO.  Season 8: Despite what people say, it was okay IMO, sure, the finale wasn't great but it wasn't horrible."
Dexter,2cr7lp,Snannybobo,7,Wed Aug 6 04:56:23 2014 UTC,"I watched seasons 1 and 2 back to back. It felt like one whole season. The Doakes arc was so great. Lundy was a fantastic character. If one and two are the best seasons then four is the most dominate season. It's incredible.  Season 6's ""Oh God"" might be the best line in the show that isn't ""Surprise mother fucker."" I think you can make the argument that seven is one of the best. I believe it could have been so much better. I wish 7 and 8 had flowed together better like one and two."
Dexter,2cr7lp,mikeramey1,3,Wed Aug 6 06:34:10 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the repercussions of season one were flowing into season 2 perfectly."
Dexter,2cr7lp,Snannybobo,7,Wed Aug 6 18:35:13 2014 UTC,Season 7 one of the best of the series? Seriously?  Everything after 4 is at best okay.
Dexter,2cr7lp,ManFromAnAntiqueLand,-2,Wed Aug 6 18:32:26 2014 UTC,Season 7 was the best. Sirko is one of my favorite villains of all time. Right beside Professor Moriarty.
Dexter,2cr7lp,Snannybobo,3,Wed Aug 6 18:45:35 2014 UTC,"Yeah he was a pretty good villain, too bad they had one of the worst send offs I've ever seen, ""Oh hey Dexter, I randomly now like you, lets be best buds even though a couple of episodes ago I said that wouldn't be possible, oh wait a character from an awful subplot just shot me dead, oh well"" the writing was garbage in that season, that subplots were awful and didn't amount to anything, it ruined an actually interesting subplot from the previous season (dexter's video game stalker), introduced an awful character/unneeded love plot, I could go on but I'd run out of characters to type up"
Dexter,2cr7lp,adsdasaddadas,0,Wed Aug 6 19:42:09 2014 UTC,"Completely disagree. It was laughably bad.  Hannah McKay's whole character is bad.  I mean, the writing in general is terrible.   Season 4 was hands down the best. If you don't agree with that, your standards of what constitutes good television don't align with what most people consider to be good tv.  Edit:  Sirko was the only good thing about season 7, but compared to the rest of the show he was out of place. Everything else was bad."
Dexter,2cr7lp,ManFromAnAntiqueLand,-2,Wed Aug 6 18:52:47 2014 UTC,"I loved season 4, but i like season 7 better. I hated hannah, both because she was written in poorly and I hated her character, but I think she was meant to be hated."
Dexter,2cr7lp,Snannybobo,3,Wed Aug 6 19:30:07 2014 UTC,"No, the worst thing about Hannah was that we were supposed to love here. From the moment Dexter saw her, we were supposed to buy that he was completely smitten with her. That he would give up ANYTHING to be with her, because she's.. what, pretty? We were supposed to feel really, really bad when it was revealed she tried to poison Debra."

Dexter,2cq0it,ImperviousSeahorse,75,Tue Aug 5 20:36:21 2014 UTC,"Lundy never believed that Doakes was the real butcher, but he also knows that the BHB must still be in that police department.  One of Lundy's first questions for Doakes was the suspects who got off under his watch, Doakes' reaction to this tipped him off.  Dexter worked on those same cases, and it was actually his faulty blood work that set those people free.  Not to mention that Dexter's meticulousness and forensic knowledge matches with what would be expected of the BHB, Lundy must have harboured some secret suspicion."
Dexter,2cq0it,_rattlesnake,74,Tue Aug 5 21:08:16 2014 UTC,harboured   i see what you did there ;P
Dexter,2cq0it,Notsoh,23,Tue Aug 5 21:11:56 2014 UTC,"Watching thru again, I definitely think he was aware of the evidence against Dexter, but I got the vibe he didnt want to persue it(for fear of finding out it WAS true) because of his involvement with Deb"

Dexter,2cq0it,Ammanda13,13,Wed Aug 6 02:08:42 2014 UTC,"He did say to dexter in the morgue the only time to kill a person was to save an innocent life, then kinda just stared at him."

Dexter,2cq0it,Ammanda13,2,Wed Aug 6 05:36:03 2014 UTC,"They enjoyable, but Jeff Lindsey is not the best writer, atleast not around book 6(second to last), I just finished that one. I seem to remember enjoying the others, but maybe I was jaded, cant remember.  The first book is great, and Season 1 is basically the book 1 shot for shot, aside from some plot details, and a different outcome for the Dexter/Brian situation.  Book 2 I remember liking alot, but thinking now, I dont remember why. Book 3 had it's issues, and seemed to be much longer, making it most people's least favourite. 4 I dont remember much, but seemed to enjoy it, same with the 5th one.  The 6th often times seemed boring, and too much of Rita who for some reason is retarded or something. I like the character of Rita, but this was just too much, and too annoying and scattered. He over did her gimmick of being kind of scatterbrained, and fast talking, and having several trains of coversation at once. They're annoying, but only somewhat important to the plot. But again, this book seemed kind of boring in a lot of places.  I kind of started the last book a few days ago, but I hear from reviews  it's one of the worse books, and kind of ridiculous.  Also, even tho the stories all change from the show book 2 and onward, there are weird parallels in some of them that coincide with the seasons, even tho they're not related at all.  EDIT: LOL, did Jeff Lindsay downvote this?"
Dexter,2cq0it,dizzlerrr,2,Wed Aug 6 06:00:09 2014 UTC,"Nice, well ill definitely have to look into them"
Dexter,2cq0it,Ammanda13,3,Wed Aug 6 06:05:50 2014 UTC,"Yeah, he did know his dad closely."
Dexter,2cq0it,Snannybobo,15,Wed Aug 6 04:50:15 2014 UTC,"I like to think that he knew, but he thought of him as a ""necessary"" evil."
Dexter,2cq0it,Nebakanezzer,17,Tue Aug 5 21:12:48 2014 UTC,"I don't think you spend your entire life's work and your retirement chasing killers just to deem one a necessary evil. he spent the majority of his professional career tracking trinity and showed the same obsession for the BHB.  it was a mixture of suspicion and poor writing IMO. He didn't believe Doakes was the BHB and had his suspicions about Dexter due to some of the mistakes he made, but a lot of the snappy dialogue and awkward moments are the writers just baiting you along, making you think Dexter is always an inch away from getting caught."
Dexter,2cq0it,nameless88,8,Tue Aug 5 23:08:45 2014 UTC,"Or maybe he realized that he could use him to help him track down other serial killers.    Enemy of my enemy is my friend sort of thing, maybe?"
Dexter,2cq0it,patiofurnature,10,Tue Aug 5 22:08:47 2014 UTC,"I always assumed he had his suspicions about Dexter, but I definitely don't think he 'knew.'"
Dexter,2cptku,TasbirM,13,Tue Aug 5 19:34:43 2014 UTC,"I can't tell you exactly why some people didn't like 5-7, since I still did like those seasons, but I can tell you why I didn't like season 8.  Personally, I wasn't disappointed with the finale nearly as much as I expected myself to be after the episodes preceding it. It wasn't anything stellar, but I believe it made more sense than the half a dozen episodes before combined and raised to the power of ten. It was just rushed and the execution was lacking."
Dexter,2cptku,TheHellFish,8,Tue Aug 5 20:53:06 2014 UTC,"I think that the first thing you have to realize is that people had  nearly an entire year of speculating about how the show would end. And of all the endings I could imagine ""Dexter retires to Alaska, with no consequences or followup"" is the worst.  Second, the season aired at a rate of (about) one episode a week. Filler isn't so bad when you can click ""next episode"" right away. But the ""Sergeant's exam"" plotline? They introduced and tried to develop an entirely new character for that - in the final season - and then nothing ever came of it. Instead of spending their air time closing all the final plots to satisfying conclusions... they gave us Masuka's daughter.  Finally, the final season of Dexter was airing at the same time as the final season of Breaking Bad. Comparisons are inevitable (two shows about criminal anti-heroes coming to an end), and how well Breaking Bad was done just highlights the missed potential of Dexter."
Dexter,2cptku,FirstRyder,2,Tue Aug 5 23:39:16 2014 UTC,"Filler isn't so bad when you can click ""next episode"" right away. But the ""Sergeant's exam"" plotline? They introduced and tried to develop an entirely new character for that - in the final season - and then nothing ever came of it   Hey.. This is a great point.   I think why many at the /r/Dexter subreddit are still angry with the finale, or at least I am, is because we didn't have a ""skip episode"" option! We literally had to wait an entire week feeling disappointed but still having that TINY glimmer of hope that maybe we'll get something not shitty next week! I think for someone to truly understand how painstakingly awful the final season was, they have to watch one episode a week and then tell themselves how they honestly feel after however many episodes aired."
Dexter,2cptku,Mrs_Damon,12,Wed Aug 6 14:35:17 2014 UTC,"I was actually angry at the finale. Disappointed would be putting it mildly.  The show spent the vast majority of the beginning seasons building Dexter up as a non-sexual serial killer with a code of conduct. And within the last season it was like there was a completely different character on screen.   Hannah... where can I even start with this load of crap. From the very beginning with them banging on the kill table.. seriously? Non-sexual Dexter is so overwhelmed by passion for a woman he doesn't know, who is a genuine killer that he lets her live and falls in love with her. It basically made Rita mean absolutely nothing. Hannah was his big love. One of the most selfish serial killers they ever showed.  All of the other seasons killers were flat out psychopaths.. with mental issues. Hannah not only was crazy but she killed for her own personal gain or to get people out of her way.   Dexter in the beginning was always one step ahead of the police, was meticulously careful. In the end he's stalking people outside of buildings just standing by the window. Where the hell was the smart killer he was all those previous seasons.   The final season he had finally tied up every single loose end, everyone who knew his secrets was dead and gone and the child he supposedly loved, he could have finally had a life with. The whole show he struggled with his humanity and while I agree that it would have been a cop out for a happy sappy ending, it took his sister dying to make him change his mind completely on leaving the country? Trinity killed Rita, his wife and mother of his children and he still kept pursuing some kind of life for him and his son. It made absolutely no effing sense he just gave up.   On top of that he leaves his son with a woman who has murdered people for money, or who got in her way of her pursuits? ARE YOU SERIOUS?  Everything in the last season was just completely laughable. Hannah was wanted and all over the news so she stands outside of homes that the police should be watching, in plain clothes and even goes to a public hospital without a disguise. They may seem like minor details but there were sooooo many of them it was like the writers just gave up. Almost every scene I had an issue with could havebeen completely different with one small change. Had Hanna dyed her hair, or acted even remotely like a criminal on the run it wouldn't have felt so sloppy. Had Dexter even tried to stalk whats-his-name without standing in front of a picture window. Such small details that made a huge impact.   Throwing his sister into the ocean, with murderers he dumped there was horrible and I really thought he was going to follow her. I would have accepted that ending. To die with the one person who was always there for you. To realize you can't keep running and can't escape what you are so you off yourself, fine. But a lumberjack? Seriously?  When the people on the internet write better endings in a few paragraphs than writers do after 7 seasons, its just bad."
Dexter,2cptku,Gabrielleofthewaters,8,Wed Aug 6 01:55:48 2014 UTC,"May I direct you to a thread I always post when this question arises (not that I mind, I want people to realize how fucking bullshit Season 8 THE FINAL SEASON was), /u/furiousBobcat's great thread about how the entirety of Season 8 was simply filler.  To call it ""terrible"" is insulting to the word ""terrible."" If you can honestly say you didn't mind Season 8 and that you didn't roll your eyes at least 20 times throughout the season, then I have to applaud your patience. I absolutely loved Dexter. I gave the first few episodes the benefit of the doubt because I don't like judging shows based on a few episodes (even though this was the 8th fucking season) and Season 7 honestly made me believe the final season would be great.   But no. We got some shitty, not-even-close-to-subtle-symbolism about Deb's death and ooh-look-Dexter-has-to-be-alone-now-because-something-about-deserving-it-or-some-shit. Yeah, Dex. Leave Harrison alone with Hannah. Fuck your stepkids. Clearly fuck Hannah because now she's stuck with this kid she barely knows because she was under the impression you'd join her except you fake your death instead of actually facing your responsibilities. AND OH YEAH. BAD ASS US MARSHALL WHO IS ALL BAD ASS AND KNOWS EVERYTHING? OF COURSE YOU'D BE DUPED INTO THINKING NOTGOSLING WAS A REGULAR OLD JOE WHEN HIS MOST WANTED FACE WAS PLASTERED EVERYWHERE. My memory's a bit fuzzy on these events because I only watched it that one time when it first aired and I was so blind with rage everything was being all jumbled around."
Dexter,2cptku,Mrs_Damon,21,Tue Aug 5 22:29:40 2014 UTC,"They took a great show/series and rendered it into a giant heap of steamy shit.  Dexter used to be a meticulous, methodic and intelligent psychopath anti hero and they turned him into a bumbling, non threatening fool of a lumberjack.  Why does this need explaining again?"
Dexter,2cptku,MrBae,3,Tue Aug 5 19:46:20 2014 UTC,Isn't the reason why he turned into a boring lumberjack is because of what he was doing since it hurts the people he cares about and doesn't want Hannah or Harrison to to end up like Debra? It seems totally logical.   What do you think would have been the perfect/good ending?
Dexter,2cptku,ImperviousSeahorse,15,Tue Aug 5 20:44:30 2014 UTC,"Debra's death was totally contrived. The whole ending felt rushed and it didn't do the show justice. The lumberjack thing was just a total cop out. Dexter should have been caught, that's what we all wanted to see. I wanted to see how all his co-workers would react.  A guy that worked on Dexter said that there were several potential endings being considered for the finale. The best one was Dexter being given the lethal injection with all his victims watching in the gallery. Just imagine Harry Morgan watching Dexter pay the same price as any other serial killer."
Dexter,2cptku,nameless88,4,Tue Aug 5 20:59:33 2014 UTC,That's definitely better ending. Thinking about this actually made me dislike the writer's decision and the finale. huh.
Dexter,2cptku,Mrs_Damon,7,Tue Aug 5 21:42:36 2014 UTC,"Because it was terrible.    Deb deserved better than that. Dexter dumps her corpse unceremoniously into the water, and for what? So we can symbolically say that she was his last victim? What about her friends and loved ones? Do they not get to have a final goodbye to her, too?    Dexter is a selfish bastard. And it was supposed to be written off to us as artistic or something.     But he wasn't always that dumb/terrible. He was a smart, well written character in the beginning, and the entire series was about him learning how to be more human, and then they decided to just throw that all away in the last season.    And then he throws it all away for a character that, frankly, was not very interesting. Hannah is dumb as a fucking rock. She's internationally wanted, and she doesn't even dye her hair, or change her appearance at all? She could wear a pair of groucho glasses and managed better than she did.    All the characters act like a bunch of idiots.    I will admit, however, that I liked season 7. I liked where it was going. But, even back then, shit was going downhill.    The last 3 seasons consist of a ton of broken side stories. They do a story arc for three episodes or so, and then the writers are like ""meh, I'm bored with this, let's do something else.""    They introduce a character, try to get us to like them, and then an episode later kill them off for shock value, or to try to give us feels, or something.    It was sloppy. It was just a poor written last season or so.    And there was no sense of urgency.    Let's compare this, for a second, to the end of Breaking Bad. I think that's fair, since they were both ending around the same time, and they were both wildly popular series.      Skinny Pete and Badger are fun side characters, they're kind of the comic relief for the series, if you don't know about the show.    In the last season, when the serious shit starts to go down, they are nowhere to be seen. They show up every once in awhile when needed, but we don't have 10 minutes of side story every episode devoted to their shenanigans.    Dexter, on the other hand, gives us a side story with Quinn's love life, Masuka's daughter, all these side stories that are just not needed at all.    In the end season of a show, we should be seeing every character's end game. Not bringing brand new things to light, looking at them briefly, and then discarding them to look at something else inconsequential."
Dexter,2cptku,nameless88,1 point,Wed Aug 6 00:39:04 2014 UTC,"Saved this comment for future use. You summed up my feelings absolutely perfectly, particularly with the Breaking Bad parallel.   And also how it was fucking ridiculous for them to bring a bus load of new characters with no real purpose for them except to take up airtime."
Dexter,2cptku,superzepto,2,Wed Aug 6 14:31:56 2014 UTC,"Yeah, every time this topic comes up, I make these points.    I'm still pretty upset about it, if you can't tell, haha.    Dexter Season 8 is like a text book case of wasted potential."
Dexter,2cptku,monchiz,3,Wed Aug 6 22:40:04 2014 UTC,"The wrong became horrifically sloppy and lacked any consequence for the main characters. LaGuerta was killed? Barely any mention of it in the final season. Deb finds out? Short stint of hating Dexter then all is well. Dr. Vogel knew his secret? Nothing happened. The series became more about what guest stars they could write roles for. If I were to shoot Chekhov's gun at the last four seasons of Dexter, there'd be barely a scene left. I started writing and developing the series I'm currently working on a pitch for at the same time that the last season was on air, and I quickly realized that the writing and production team for Dexter were even more amateur than I am. The only thing I cannot criticize is Michael C. Hall's acting. He did the absolute best he could with that shitty writing and made the character memorable. My next project? A spec rewrite of the last four seasons just for my own fun and to prove that any old hack can do it better than they did."

Dexter,2cptku,Hardensbeard333,2,Fri Aug 8 00:51:39 2014 UTC,"I wasn't even really on this sub until the show ended, and I can honestly say that all on my own I thought season 8 was not good. There were so many plot holes (why would Hannah, a wanted fugitive, not even TRY to disguise herself when she takes Harrison to the hospital? That's just one example), story lines that felt rushed, story lines that were brought up for no reason etc. The ending was so unfulfilling, I mean who just sticks someone with their own child? Where did him becoming a lumberjack come from?? The writers even admitted that Showtime sprung on them that the last season was being bumped up a few months, so they really did write it in a rush and I just feel it really hurt the final season."
Dexter,2cptku,GO1NGD0WN,3,Wed Aug 6 05:04:46 2014 UTC,"I liked seasons 1-7 actually. 5 was ok, 8 was really bad."
Dexter,2cptku,Brian2112,2,Tue Aug 5 22:43:41 2014 UTC,"I agree with this! Everyone complains about seasons 5-8 but the only season I absolutely hated was season 8 and the series finale was probably the worst ending to a show I have ever seen simply because it left too many questions. In my opinion, dexter showing up in Argentina and meeting Harrison and Hannah after everyone thought he was dead would have been a great way to end the show."
Dexter,2cptku,panzerkampfwagen,2,Wed Aug 6 01:10:19 2014 UTC,the last scene is literally the only piece of the last season I can remember vividly.  and only because I was so mad.   it was actually forgettable. and forgotten.
Dexter,2cptku,united1020,2,Tue Aug 5 20:18:42 2014 UTC,You loved the finale?  Were you drunk?
Dexter,2cptku,ParadoxOO9,1 point,Wed Aug 6 11:06:11 2014 UTC,"If you were as methodical, and as accomplished of a serial killer like Dexter, wouldn't the best plan to be abandon everything that has distracted you from your main goal (killing people)?   I like to think of Dexter becoming a lumberjack as a good thing, he's starting new, a place where no one knows his face and he's going to continue to do what he is best at."
Dexter,2cptku,monchiz,1 point,Tue Aug 5 21:08:19 2014 UTC,After season 7 I personally thought that season 8 would be Dexter trying to cover his tracks and gtfo with Miami PD slowly coming down on top of him. Then as /u/ImperviousSeahorse said he would be given the lethal injection with his victims all watching. Instead we got a massive cop-out and he became a lumberjack...
Dexter,2cptku,kazuri85,1 point,Wed Aug 6 18:18:31 2014 UTC,"I just watched the entire last season yesterday. My biggest problem through the middle of the season was that Dexter somehow didnt figure out the brain surgeon was someone other than the comcast guy who was murdering women. Different methods of killing, clearly angry against women in particular, and somehow they just assumed he was the brain surgeon. Made no sense. Also, Dexter not killing the brain surgeon (Daniel) having a thousand chances to do it. Also, risking Deb's life by assuming Daniel could not possibly escape. Also why would Deb leave the dude alone in the room giving him a chance to escape, grab a knife or a gun and kill her. Then the Marshal releasing Daniel. agggh! Why Hanna never even tried to put on a fuckn hat, glasse,s or dye her freakin hair? makes no sense. And then Dexter assuming Hanna will take care of his son, forgeting about his step kids. So much crap and unanswered questions. Is he still killing people? is he keeping tabs on his kids? how could the hospital not notice him taking a body out the front door? ahhhhh In my head i have chosen to believe he eventually met up with Hanna."
Dexter,2cptku,NJS212,1 point,Thu Aug 7 20:13:52 2014 UTC,"Reasons I hated it  Added new people to the show for no compelling reason when there were already people on the show.(at the very most a new badguy would be necessary but he should have been fucking with dexters friends, not some shrink we never knew about until the last season)  No reason to have dexter pretend to die then bring him back if there is no hope for any more seasons. There is just no reason for it. Also I like to think dexter would have had the balls to kill himself in that situation.  It could have been epic if the writers/directors had the balls to kill dexter, or have everyone find out he is a killer etc. This is a fucking tv show, no reason he needed to be 'good' when they could have had truly one of the best series ending shows ever, instead it is generic as hell. There is literally nothing special about the last season other than the debra thing. Which I commend the writers for, but it could have been so much more.  Dexter dying, or everyone finding out he was the killer were the correct choices, anything else just isn't good enough for this show."
Dexter,2cptku,nuckle,1 point,Mon Aug 11 01:20:05 2014 UTC,"I liked Season 7. It wasn't great, but I liked the new characters introduced and the season finale was a pretty great episode filled with drama.   My big beefs with Season 8 were the following:   The LaGuerta murder never being addressed. This should have kick-started the final season. Instead, we get a bench. Too many new characters in the final season. To me a final season needs to develop core characters even more and bring them towards an ending. This....did not happen. I thought Matthews should have played the role the female doctor. Also, substitute Bautista and Quinn for Elway and the U.S. Marshall. Those two changes would have been a major improvement.  The finale to me wasn't as bad. It was the episodes leading up to it. Season 8 never felt like the final season. That's a problem!"
Dexter,2cptku,pRo_BackpackBro,1 point,Mon Aug 11 02:48:39 2014 UTC,"I liked it all the way up to the end. Some of the story lines in 8 felt rushed and incomplete (Masuka's daughter, for example), but I enjoyed the season and the ending."
Dexter,2cptku,Slaytounge,-1,Tue Aug 5 22:22:05 2014 UTC,I totally agree with you! At the end he said he's a monster and a monster doesn't deserve happiness and that's why he disappears and becomes a boring ol' lumberjack. I guess people didn't pay attention or understood and expected a happy ending?
Dexter,2cptku,eavesly,4,Tue Aug 5 20:23:43 2014 UTC,"That's a happy ending compared to what I wanted to happen. We're not too stupid to understand what they were trying to do with the show, we just didn't like it."
Dexter,2cptku,Heff228,3,Wed Aug 6 00:40:59 2014 UTC,"Dexter deserved to die an impersonal death by a killer with no code; I would have enjoyed an ending where Dexter was attacked and eaten by a pack of wolves. Just think of all the small animals he killed as a boy.   Instead, he's working amongst rough lumberjacks in remote locations telling himself, ""tonight's the night."" How long before he has an urge? How long before he meets an unsavory truant with dark tendencies?   Dexter is just starting over without the burden of a kid and domineering sister."
Dexter,2cptku,Slaytounge,-1,Tue Aug 5 20:37:57 2014 UTC,"It was a mob mentality thing.  People starting complaining about every little thing and it just snowballed into pure hate.  Nothing would of pleased this sub.    They want to hate it, even going as far as running the ""Dexter is a lumberjack"" joke into the ground.  He isn't even a lumberjack.  When you have to really reach to make fun of something, it looks like you are trying way too hard."

Dexter,2clwo8,forgotmyfuckingname,40,Mon Aug 4 18:02:47 2014 UTC,"It was all about symbolism.  He felt like she was his victim (and she was), so he buried her where he buried all his other victims. He also mentioned that he feels peaceful there, alone on the water, so you could look at that as him giving her the peace she deserved. You could also see the contrast between the 'angelic' white sheets and usual black trash bags.  There might be more, but I really don't want to rewatch the finale now, maybe later..."

Dexter,2clwo8,Mrs_Damon,5,Mon Aug 4 20:13:31 2014 UTC,"Well, it resembled the 'we don't give a fuck anymore and there's nothing you can do about it' attitude of the writers (the reprecussions of the scene) and the director (well, no explanation necessary). Also, if you want to dig deeper, this is the 'real' meaning behind the treadmill incident."

What was your favorite Season? Which was your favorite of Dexters enemies? Who was your favorite cop? Who did you hate more, Astor or Cody? What was your favorite kill? Dexters best girl?  Which of Dexter's lady loves did you hate the most? Saddest death? Lastly... your lumberjack thoughts?  Anyone can answer. Mine are below. Thanks everyone!!!"
Dexter,2clwo8,Jimmith3eo,4,Tue Aug 5 04:25:23 2014 UTC,"Season 5. I know it's kind of against the grain, but I adored Lumen, and I really wish she would have been their longer.   Zack. I like that he morphed from enemy to protegé.   Deb and Batista, hands down!  Hard, I actually loved them both, but Cody turned into a bit of a shit, although I understand why he did.  Jordan Chase. As someone who's been raped, I'd be lying if I said I'd never imagined myself in Lumen's position before.  A cross between Rita & Lumen.  FUCKING LILA. She ruined the name for me.  DEB & RITA. I LOVED THEM!  Fuck lumberjack Dexter. I will always love the Dexter pre-season 6."
Dexter,2clwo8,TheHellFish,2,Tue Aug 5 04:36:45 2014 UTC,"What was your favorite Season? 4  Which was your favorite of Dexters enemies? Doaks, he was the man!!! Who was your favorite cop? Quinn Who did you hate more, Astor or Cody? Fuck you Cody, Astor sucks too. What was your favorite kill? Lyla... couldn't stand that crazy bitch. Dexters best girl? Jamie... I know they didn't have a thing. But she was the best!!! Which of Dexter's lady loves did you hate the most? Hannah... FUCK HANNAH MCKAY. She ruined the show for me. I loved her in Chuck. She was so aloof in this show it just bugged the hell out of me. Saddest death? Doaks... he was my favorite character. Favorite Sidekick: Issac... I feel like they needed to high five or fist bump after they threw that body overboard on the boat. Lastly... your lumberjack thoughts? Personally I like the lumberjack idea. the fact that he left his son with some dumb shit bugs the hell out of me. Argentina, what a joke. That demon span succubus Hannah ruined the hell out of Dexter. Her whole Arc was so lame and felt so forced. I was so thankful when she went to jail, only to be resurrected to ruin Dexters life. He put the pussy on a pedestal and look what happened. His doctor mom died, his sister died, she doesn't know how to watch a child, she doesn't know how to disguise. How the fuck did she find her way to Argentina is anyones guess. As for the lumberjack thing... I guess thats pretty cool. Otherwise, FUCK YOU HANNAH MCKAY!!!!"
Dexter,2clwo8,ShardikOfTheBeam,1 point,Tue Aug 5 04:35:19 2014 UTC,"What was your favorite Season? Season 4. Which was your favorite of Dexters enemies? Definitely Brian. Who was your favorite cop? Deb (and Doakes ofc). Who did you hate more, Astor or Cody? Um, neither? Idk, I didn't mind them, I was actually disappointed when they disappeared without a trace. What was your favorite kill? Brian, Speltzer, Travis (he sucked as a big bad, but the kill scene was quite good actually) and LaGuerta. Dexters best girl? Deb. Well, they didn't have a thing, but... Which of Dexter's lady loves did you hate the most? Hannah 'fucking' McKay. So. Many. Objective. Reasons. And even more subjective ones. Saddest death? Deb, Rita, Brian (sort of). Lastly... your lumberjack thoughts? Long story short: interesting idea, screwed up realization."
Dexter,2clwo8,Szcynergy,1 point,Tue Aug 5 07:58:12 2014 UTC,"Favorite Season - Probably the first. Those episodes were so good and got me hooked into the show. So sad that as the show went on it lost a lot of what made it so great at the beginning. Favorite enemy - I'm gonna go out on a limb (hehe) and say The Skinner. I remember feeling an actual fear for Anton, and many of the other victims just because The Skinner seemed like such a ghost. Secondarily, Brian. I loved the twist that they were brothers, and he wasn't actually Dexter's enemy, but just wanted to be his brother again. Things like that are what made the show so great at the beginning. Favorite Cop - Batista, hands down. (I don't count Deb because she's more than just a cop character.) He's just genuinely such a great guy, he has his flaws, but he's honest. And he owns up to them, even when pressured not to. One of the best characters in the entire show in my opinion. Astor or Cody - Weird question, I didn't hate either. I think overall I disliked Astor more, but that's only because she was growing up and all pre teen girls are little shits. Not really a valid question. Lady love hate - Lila fucking West. Fuck her. Stupid british twat. Saddest death - hmmmm, tough one. I think the one that got me the most was Lundy, because of how it affected Deb. To be fair, Deb is pretty dramatic, but her life took a huge turn after Lundy died. Lumberjack thoughts - I thought it was really weak. Overall, from where the show started, to where it ended, it lost a lot of momentum and overall fandom for me with each season. The last season I really really enjoyed was the Lumen season, because it was a different take on the classic main villain for each season, and after that it just lost it's luster."
Dexter,2clwo8,bobbob1016,1 point,Tue Aug 5 17:38:18 2014 UTC,Favorite season: Tied between 4 and 7 Favorite enemy: Trinity Favorite cop: Batista Who I hated more: Astor Favorite Kill: Snuff film guy in the pilot Best girl: Lumen Most hated girl: Lila Saddest death: Rita Lumberjack my ass
Dexter,2clwo8,bobbob1016,2,Mon Aug 11 19:34:47 2014 UTC,"Another way I see the ending, although some people didn't like this way to look at it the last time I mentioned it, is that ""there are lumberjacks in Argentina"".  How do we know that Dexter didn't go to Argentina, and is currently working as a lumberjack with her in Argentina?  They don't explicitly say otherwise in the show.  The writers may have, but they didn't convey it in the show without a shadow of a doubt."
Dexter,2clwo8,greenblues,3,Tue Aug 5 11:33:27 2014 UTC,In my head I actually saw him in Canada.
Dexter,2clwo8,dizzlerrr,2,Tue Aug 5 12:48:41 2014 UTC,"If he's lumberjacking in Argentina, it fixes the ending a bit.  As in he made it look like he died so he could live free with her in Argentina."
Dexter,2clwo8,sealman911,2,Thu Aug 7 17:00:28 2014 UTC,"Yea exactly WTFFFFF ending :/   Agree, he thought he had killed her. The first time, besides pulling the cord lol. Ever since Debra found out, things started going bad for her... because of him -at least indirectly."

Sure, she wasn't like him the way that Hannah or even Lila were, but that was sort of the point. She showed him different perspectives and proved to Dexter that he could feel real human emotions."

Dexter,2co2hy,Mrs_Damon,3,Tue Aug 5 22:42:42 2014 UTC,"As crazy and manipulative as Lila was, I think she really accepted Dexter and all of his baggage. She probably would have been able to offer the only thing close to a real relationship, but I doubt that would have made him happy."
Dexter,2co2hy,sadbbygrl,3,Tue Aug 5 18:13:27 2014 UTC,The minute Dexter spent slightly less time with her she injured herself. Shes a stage 12 clinger. I dont know why I was attracted to her when I first watched.

Dexter,2ckgj7,Havokboi,25,Mon Aug 4 07:05:43 2014 UTC,"Continue. The quality dips a bit, but Season 7 is one of the top seasons for me, with one of the most interesting characters in the whole show. You've come as far as 4, finish the journey."
Dexter,2ckgj7,Deezer19,4,Mon Aug 4 07:04:59 2014 UTC,Continue.  Season 5 I thought was good (not great). Season 6 rivals season 8 in the horrid department. The main antagonist is a joke (both the role and actor they listed). Season 7 was pretty good.

It's ok when a show has ups and downs, but Dexter is much about the build and integrity of the main character, everthing has a reason and a deep understanding, and after the 4th season (when producers and scripters went replaced) is not ""ups and downs"", is about RUINING the basis, and when runners ruin the main character there's no point.  Think in ""The mask"" with Jim Carrey and ""The mask 2"", and every ""sequel"" edited directly on dvd just ""for the money""... that's my point of view about post-4thseason's Dexter."

They could get all of these characters to appear as separate times and slowly develop Dexter into a different person when each person appears to him. Occasionally they'll clash and cause conflict. That would be fun."
Dexter,2cgxg2,FrodoFraggins,2,Sun Aug 3 22:14:55 2014 UTC,"I can't imagine a single way to bring back Dexter that would feel right.  Forgetting Harrison and Hannah would be best, or avenging their deaths I guess."
Dexter,2cgxg2,GreenVevu,1 point,Sun Aug 3 23:02:28 2014 UTC,"Would it be too dark to have it set in the somewhat distant future where Harrison has become a killer brought up by Hannah? Could be a deep opponent of Dexter. Would be bold, but very dark."
Dexter,2ce4y2,faiintx,78,Sat Aug 2 02:22:53 2014 UTC,I'm pretty sure Trinity didn't even know Dexter was a serial killer until he was tied to Dex's table. Trinity just thought Dex was an extortionist.
Dexter,2ce4y2,Szcynergy,18,Sat Aug 2 06:32:03 2014 UTC,This is the correct answer.

Dexter,2ce4y2,HerpDerpMapleSerp,1 point,Sat Aug 2 07:21:45 2014 UTC,I thought Dexter tried to kill him once and failed?
Dexter,2ce4y2,Pointwest418,3,Sat Aug 2 17:30:55 2014 UTC,"\\HUGE SPOILERS\\  He was going to and then saved his life.  Something along the lines of ""He can't go this way, it has to be me."" when Trinity tried to commit suicide."
Dexter,2ce4y2,red_sky,2,Sat Aug 2 19:45:24 2014 UTC,"Yeah, wasn't he trying to commit suicide and Dexter saved him because he wanted the satisfaction of killing him himself?"
Dexter,2ce4y2,Iamnotyour_mother,2,Sat Aug 2 21:13:59 2014 UTC,That's exactly it.
Dexter,2ce4y2,red_sky,2,Sat Aug 2 22:05:44 2014 UTC,Dexter was holding onto his leg arguing with himself to drop him or not. He then appears to almost do so until the other construction people came to help Arthur up.
Dexter,2ce4y2,argonia,0,Tue Aug 5 18:11:38 2014 UTC,This. ^
Dexter,2ce4y2,TheMintron,17,Sat Aug 2 09:48:04 2014 UTC,I'm pretty sure it's been discussed before. I'm sure he told her. I doubt she believed him. Would you believe some psycho naked old guy in your bathtub if he told you the love of your life was a serial killer? Because I wouldn't. I'm also pretty sure he intended to kill Rita. Probably would have staked out his apartment if he was trying to kill Dexter.
Dexter,2ce4y2,niggalodeon15,4,Sat Aug 2 04:25:23 2014 UTC,"Dexter was also a perfect fit for Trinity's ""code"" He had a wife and two kids."
Dexter,2ce4y2,TheHellFish,13,Sat Aug 2 14:00:51 2014 UTC,Three kids.
Dexter,2ce4y2,Sven_88,8,Sat Aug 2 17:58:38 2014 UTC,I like to think that he did tell her before he killed her.
Dexter,2ce4y2,soccerman95,2,Sat Aug 2 02:54:51 2014 UTC,Huh...never thought about that. Interesting. I think her death would have more closure of sorts if she found out the truth before she died.
Dexter,2ce4y2,greenblues,2,Sat Aug 2 03:54:19 2014 UTC,I think Trinity realized Dexter's wife/family was a perfect fit ...but he didn't intend for her to die from the start. Only when Dexter started to cause trouble.  If I remember correctly Dexter refused to talk about his family with him at first

Dexter,2c911e,ContourTherapy,3,Thu Jul 31 23:53:08 2014 UTC,"When I was watching an episode once per week I would normally watch the intro, as it's part of the whole experience of the show.   If, however, I was binging a few episodes, then I would skip it (except for the first time), I do the same for any show where the intro takes too long (Suits, NCIS, The Walking Dead, etc)"
Dexter,2c911e,madmanwithabox11,3,Fri Aug 1 00:09:09 2014 UTC,Thank you all for your coherent and nice responses.  I've been binge watching the show and usually skip the intro except episode one and the final episode of the season. I also skip the previously part though I appreciate if you're watching the show in a more spaced out period of time the intro's a pretty cool thing. Thanks again!
Dexter,2c911e,k0fi96,1 point,Fri Aug 1 00:43:35 2014 UTC,"usually skip the intro except episode one and the final episode of the season   My method exactly, regarding the intro. Though I never did skip the 'previously on Dexter' portion. To be honest, even when binge watching I think it just never crossed my mind to skip over that. But in hindsight, I think it was fine getting to see what plot points the producers felt were relevant to the current episode."

You will be disappointed, but the show doesn't suddenly become terrible. The quality of the writing does visibly slip, but I still enjoyed some moments of the last seasons. Season 7 might be my favorite among them."

You might feel like the later seasons aren't as great, but it's only because you have such high expectations (because the earlier seasons are just so good, except 3).

Dexter,2bv5qt,Moronoo,5,Mon Jul 28 13:28:26 2014 UTC,Dude I know right? It took me like 4 episode and then I remembered he played travis here.
Dexter,2bv5qt,blue1748,1 point,Mon Jul 28 02:20:30 2014 UTC,I was wondering for a while where I had seen the Fargo guy from. Can't believe I completely forgot about his role on Dexter.
Dexter,2bv5qt,Discoteca,5,Sat Aug 2 07:14:43 2014 UTC,In television we call this a continuity error.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_(fiction)#Continuity_errors
Dexter,2bv5qt,timtimkev,3,Sun Jul 27 19:06:18 2014 UTC,lol at the zip code. That area is totally landlocked.
Dexter,2bv5qt,saxyroro,8,Sun Jul 27 19:56:39 2014 UTC,"I know its a small detail, but I deal a lot with USPS mailing labels and noticed it.  Season 6, Episode 12. Time - 26:45."
Dexter,2bv5qt,GaGaORiley,9,Sun Jul 27 16:08:54 2014 UTC,"What's to elaborate? The first label has the address hand-written in red, but when it arrives the address is typed in black. Good use of the word ""retarded"", though."
Dexter,2bv5qt,BlinkAgainst44,3,Sun Jul 27 16:34:53 2014 UTC,"Dexter's name and address that are written in red in the top picture don't seem to be in the second picture with Travis, yet it's the same package."
Dexter,2bv5qt,RLLRRR,8,Sun Jul 27 17:27:38 2014 UTC,"What if, and bear with me, the red in the package represented the Illuminati conspiracy to restore communism in the world...? We have to go deeper..."
Dexter,2bv5qt,joeloud,2,Sun Jul 27 16:43:35 2014 UTC,"What probably happened here is that they initially printed the label in the bottom photo, and when it came time to shoot the insert shot of that label (the top photo), they realized it's not quite as easy to read as they would like, so they slapped a sticker over the address, and wrote it in big red letters. It happens."
Dexter,2bv5qt,tynosaur,1 point,Sun Jul 27 17:04:58 2014 UTC,"This is definitely exactly what happened, you can tell it is still the same label underneath (with a rectangular white sticker placed over it)"
Dexter,2bv5qt,dazzledor,2,Mon Jul 28 03:49:45 2014 UTC,"Well thats it, this how is officially ruined."
Dexter,2bv5qt,nardonedylan,1 point,Mon Jul 28 14:47:05 2014 UTC,"I work for FedEx, and it's actually common. We are supposed to generate a new shipping label and place it over the old one. Makes it more generic, but it actually is the correct way to do it"
Dexter,2bv5qt,tHobbs,1 point,Thu Jul 31 21:14:33 2014 UTC,"You do that after its been delivered and in the guys house within 30 seconds? The point was it was at the doorstep in the show, he picked it up and then went inside and placed it on the counter.Label changed within 30 seconds. Also its USPS, not UPS or Fedex. I understand it may be common with those carriers. With USPS you can write on a potato and mail it.  Its not a big deal, I just like to find ""continuity errors"""
Dexter,2bqzvr,KioraTheExplorer,16,Sat Jul 26 02:39:32 2014 UTC,"I, for the most part, enjoyed the books. The last couple get a little bit meh in my opinion, but they are completely different from the show (except for the first) and follow an interesting plot of their own. I like getting Dexter's internal monologue, and his dark humour that you find in the show. If you enjoy reading and don't go in expecting it to be the best book you've ever read, I would definitely recommend them. At least try the first two and you should be able to tell if you want to continue. Happy reading! :)"
Dexter,2bqzvr,afili,11,Sat Jul 26 04:23:28 2014 UTC,I don't think the books are as good. They have this weird supernatural element to them.
Dexter,2bqzvr,darkeside324,6,Sat Jul 26 03:58:28 2014 UTC,The dark passenger nonsense is definitely milked to all hell in the books.
Dexter,2bqzvr,vertigo1083,3,Sat Jul 26 15:51:59 2014 UTC,"I think I'd have liked the supernatural elements more if I hadn't seen the show first. I usually like supernatural themes, but my brain was categorizing all ""Dark Passenger"" talk as entirely metaphorical, so it seemed really weird when it became clear that it was an actual thing. I think that, without my preconceptions from watching the show, I would have paid more attention to the hints and clues and it would have seen like a more natural development."
Dexter,2bqzvr,MangoBitch,2,Sat Jul 26 22:19:26 2014 UTC,"He dropped the DP as being an entity, and it's just a metaphor again."
Dexter,2bqzvr,dazzledor,2,Thu Jul 31 21:17:37 2014 UTC,"No they dont, it was an experiment in one book that he never touched on again.  Be better informed."
Dexter,2bqzvr,dazzledor,5,Thu Jul 31 21:17:06 2014 UTC,"The show is definitely better than the books. Better characters, better writing, better story lines (though there are some things in the books that I wish made it to the screen). The only exception would probably be season 8."
Dexter,2bqzvr,defeasiblefee,7,Sat Jul 26 20:51:20 2014 UTC,"Books are better as far as story goes. The first season follows the book, then they're two different worlds."
Dexter,2bqzvr,RobertPaulsen39,2,Sat Jul 26 03:50:42 2014 UTC,"With the exception of the first two books, the series is awful."
Dexter,2bqzvr,kstar22bassist,2,Sat Jul 26 18:26:58 2014 UTC,"I wiki'd the books after watching about half-way through the show... they seem alright until they get to this supernatural theme, and then it just seems like BS. Why make something about Dexter supernatural when his appeal is in the psychological? It just seemed like it was trying to take the power away from how amazing it is the different ways people can differ from the norm."
Dexter,2bqzvr,StolenAphrodite,2,Sun Jul 27 01:11:36 2014 UTC,"late to the party here, but I read the first two books and couldn't really do the writing style. The books were incredibly fast reads with very over-simple language. They remind me of those trashy crime novels you always see for sale in airport kiosks. The show adds a lot of good complexity to the story, in my opinion. The show generally took the idea of the characters and then ran in whatever direction they wanted with them."
Dexter,2bqzvr,Delinquent_Turtle,4,Sun Jul 27 20:02:35 2014 UTC,"I would say seasons 1 and 4 are better than any of the books. Books 1 and 2 however are better imo than any of the other tv seasons. These are followed by season 2. After that it's very much hit and miss.   Seasons 3 and 7 though ultimately underwhelming are still quite strong and are tied with books 4 and 5 though I'd lean more towards season 3 considering Jimmy Smits incredible performance (he's a personal fave of mine).  Finally books 6 and 7 are pretty meh with some twists and turns that end up being very contrived though I'd still read those over the terrible seasons 5 and 6.  And last and certainly least, season 8 and book 3 are just... I don't even have the words...  Keep in mind the above are to be treated as opinions and not fact."
Dexter,2bqzvr,ThePis7olStar,5,Sat Jul 26 04:32:01 2014 UTC,Too late. The show did that already.
Dexter,2bqzvr,DallasGayBoys,1 point,Sat Jul 26 12:28:56 2014 UTC,"I read some of the books after season 1 came out. I've only done the first three books, but I felt like it was a downward slope. I thought the first book (Darkly Dreaming Dexter) was good, the second (Dearly Devoted Dexter) was so-so, and the third (Dexter in the Dark) was meh. Personally, I think the first 4 or 5 seasons of the Dexter TV show are superior to the books."
Dexter,2bqzvr,Kastro187420,1 point,Sat Jul 26 14:55:45 2014 UTC,"Not sure why people didn't like the books. With the exception of #3 (where they introduce the super natural element, but stop with it in subsequent books), they were all pretty good.  It's not fair to really compare them to the TV Show. They have 2 different standards and directions they're taking the story. The first Book and first Season pretty much line up, up towards the end where they branch apart and take different paths.  If you don't compare the two (books/tv series) and just accept them as their own twist on the same concept, the books are actually a really good read. I won't spoil anything for you in case you decide to read them, but I will mention a few points:   After Book 1, everything is different from the series Book #3 (Dexter in the Dark) contains a supernatural element, don't let that scare you from 4+ though, as after #3 it goes back to normal Rita is obnoxious   If you can accept those 3 basic points, combined with what I mentioned above, they're worth a read through. Don't let the negative comments scare you off from them. If you have a local library, odds are they contain at least the first few books, so look into checking them out rather than buying them if you're still unsure."
Dexter,2buai0,Kappicard,12,Sun Jul 27 06:15:00 2014 UTC,"Dexter had themes and plot lines for each season.  Lila was a vehicle in Season 2 for Dex to compare his dark passenger to a narcotics addiction.   It also provided Dex an outlet from the Rita relationship (he wasn't previously that committed) after which he realised he was 100% committed to Rita, something he never believed he could do.  So it provided Dex some character growth.  It was an interesting theme, and provided a plot line for Dex's character growth.  However it had to die under the knife so season 3 could focus on Miguel. Dex had a romantic partner.  Now could he have a bestie?  Could he have a bestie that knew his secret?"
Dexter,2buai0,_tweaks,65,Sun Jul 27 08:18:35 2014 UTC,"I can't speak for the whole fan base but I found her character to be totally annoying and overwhelming. I didn't like what she brought out in Dexter as a character, as well. She was the only part of season 2 I didn't really like, which is too bad because season 2 was pretty killer. I don't know if this helps or reflects anyone else's opinion, just wanted to put my two cents in since you were asking."
Dexter,2buai0,Abra_Ka_Daniel,13,Sun Jul 27 06:35:12 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I would have likely stopped watching if she became a regular character"
Dexter,2buai0,XA36,3,Sun Jul 27 08:35:34 2014 UTC,"It also seemed like what Dexter would have done anyway, what with her actually endangering every part of his lifestyle"
Dexter,2buai0,FoxylambA,8,Wed Jul 30 02:41:33 2014 UTC,"Yea, she honestly ruined that season for me. I couldn't stand any scene with her, and I'll never understand why someone would pick her over Rita."
Dexter,2buai0,Heat55wade,7,Sun Jul 27 13:53:05 2014 UTC,"Maybe I'm crazy, but I thought Rita got hotter with each passing season.  She may have been a bitch for the duration of her last season, but still gorgeous."
Dexter,2buai0,vertigo1083,7,Sun Jul 27 15:47:39 2014 UTC,"Oh yea, she definitely got hotter."
Dexter,2buai0,Heat55wade,21,Sun Jul 27 18:34:51 2014 UTC,"If Dexter didn't kill her, I would have. Couldn't stand that character."
Dexter,2buai0,swedy17,10,Sun Jul 27 06:41:26 2014 UTC,"my cousin always wanted her to be the ""one who got away,"" and who comes back several seasons later to fuck Dexter'd shit up. that would make so much sense. it'd be better than that piece of shit that they called a last season"
Dexter,2buai0,turkishdelightbribe,2,Sun Jul 27 08:47:03 2014 UTC,Completely fucking agree with you on that
Dexter,2buai0,jmanning0236,4,Sat Aug 9 16:25:15 2014 UTC,"Dexter is about trying to live a normal life and finding someone he can live with. Lila was killed off because she couldn't fit that role, plus she fit his code perfectly. Let's look at the situation:  Lila was one of Dexter's girlfriends, but she only liked him for his killing side. His desire to be ""normal"" was irrelevant to her, which only makes her half of what Dexter needs/wants.  Secondly, she tried to kill Dexter's kids. Sorry, but that's not going to fly by him. He wasn't even in love with her enough to forgive her. He kills killers. Lila killed Doakes and ATTEMPTED to kill his kids. Bye bye."
Dexter,2buai0,AdmiredFob,5,Sun Jul 27 08:58:47 2014 UTC,she was literally the most annoying cunt in the show. I was so happy when she died
Dexter,2buai0,vBaz,3,Tue Jul 29 22:24:51 2014 UTC,"She was alright at first, but she got really annoying....she had some nice boobies though..."
Dexter,2buai0,J_Spak,3,Sun Jul 27 16:01:55 2014 UTC,"Sorry, but watching her die was very satisfying."
Dexter,2buai0,Nice_Lady,2,Wed Jul 30 01:01:13 2014 UTC,"Well, if he didn't kill her should would just be in Great Britain, and also she was the big bad of the season so ya know......  I also hated her."
Dexter,2buai0,miggyzee,2,Sun Jul 27 07:30:53 2014 UTC,"The response so far proved my point. I guess I'm out of step on this, maybe it's because season 2 was so good. She's the only lover dexter straight up killed if I remember right. Lumen who I also liked got to live in Minnesota and Idk what happened to Hannah.  But hey Matsuka and Batista agree with me.  Also Lila's place reminded me of the Joe Spinelli movie Maniac and the remake with the fucked up mannequins."
Dexter,2buai0,RLLRRR,9,Sun Jul 27 20:04:52 2014 UTC,good eyecandy   Gross. She was absolutely gross.
Dexter,2buai0,Finneas_,8,Sun Jul 27 06:42:05 2014 UTC,Gross vampire titties.
Dexter,2buai0,bruddahmacnut,9,Sun Jul 27 08:39:34 2014 UTC,Did you pardon them?
Dexter,2buai0,Mrs_Damon,6,Sun Jul 27 15:37:26 2014 UTC,Evidently he preferred fucking her rather than setting her on fire
Dexter,2buai0,CarsonMcLee,2,Sun Jul 27 19:53:21 2014 UTC,"It wasn't either of those. They wrote out the plot before the season and had her killed off before they knew the likability. They had plenty of money to pay her had the plot needed to keep her, but they didn't. They made her extremely unlikable on purpose so people wouldn't care as much when she finally was killed off. Plus, Dexter wouldn't have looked the other way to her trying to kill Astor and Cody, of course he'd kill her. And good riddance,"
Dexter,2buai0,XA36,2,Sun Jul 27 14:02:30 2014 UTC,I wish lumen would have stayed. Fuck everyone else.
Dexter,2buai0,duckwantbread,8,Sun Jul 27 08:36:24 2014 UTC,Lumen coming back for season 8 would have made so much more sense than Hannah.
Dexter,2buai0,XA36,2,Sun Jul 27 19:39:19 2014 UTC,"Yeah, Hannah just wasn't likeable like they were trying for in season 8"
Dexter,2buai0,jmanning0236,1 point,Sun Jul 27 21:35:22 2014 UTC,Imagine a spinoff season with that as the main plot hook. First episode ends with her being reintroduced
Dexter,2buai0,walterpinkman45,1 point,Sat Aug 9 16:29:34 2014 UTC,Rita got really hot. Deb was my eye candy through the whole show though.
Dexter,2buai0,jmanning0236,1 point,Mon Jul 28 04:31:30 2014 UTC,I thought she looked like mouse with her big ass ears but god did she get DIME
Dexter,2buai0,greenblues,1 point,Sat Aug 9 16:22:34 2014 UTC,Because she was a control freak arsonist :l
Dexter,2bpbqj,Jurgen_von_shmurgen,12,Fri Jul 25 16:25:54 2014 UTC,I believe this would be a better fit.
Dexter,2bpbqj,Szcynergy,1 point,Fri Jul 25 17:54:21 2014 UTC,I mean for like the ending song in the credits but that is Very fitting too
Dexter,2bpbqj,Szcynergy,2,Fri Jul 25 21:37:54 2014 UTC,"I know, I was kidding :P"
Dexter,2bpbqj,oh_no_aliens,3,Sat Jul 26 18:30:38 2014 UTC,"Talking Heads doesn't fit... to go from serious to comical is a rough transition.. I don't disagree with you but also don't think this song fits too well as a final theme.   Just look at the end of The Sopranos and ""Don't stop believing"", it sends a message, and it translates well.  Something similar to leave dexter on whatever note the producers want would translate equally to the big picture."
Dexter,2bpbqj,Maester_Hodor,9,Fri Jul 25 22:59:58 2014 UTC,This seems more fitting.
Dexter,2bpbqj,hugojunior10,1 point,Fri Jul 25 21:39:39 2014 UTC,nice
Dexter,2bpbqj,almeida37,2,Mon Jul 28 17:28:51 2014 UTC,It fits with the writing staff's complete inability to write subtlety so sure
Dexter,2bpbqj,twhite5,1 point,Sat Jul 26 08:11:06 2014 UTC,"I felt they shouldve used ""Make Your Own Kind of Music"". It had been used throughout season 8 as a creepy song and was the song featured in a couple kills. Now that Dexter had killed himself off to all the peopke who loved and cared about him. It would have fit. Maybe not closing credits, but definitely the last scene"
Dexter,2boq5t,jerkuspeenus,5,Fri Jul 25 12:31:18 2014 UTC,"The biggest reason why Seasons 1 and 2 were my favorite was because it felt like each episode was important. No fat, not a lot of side plots and the side plots that did exist mattered to the story. Deb/Lundy's relationship, for instance, mattered because of who the BHB really was.   It just felt every episode in those first two seasons mattered. Season 4 was very good and I enjoyed Seasons 5 and 7.   But 1 & 2 were the best, with 2 edging out 1 for my favorite."
Dexter,2boq5t,NJS212,3,Sat Jul 26 04:53:59 2014 UTC,Everything after 2 focused a lot more on bullshit relationship problems and balancing it with his killer lifestyle. That was more of a side story in the first two seasons but from 3 on..that was the main story while killing was the side story and I really hated it. I still hate season 4.
Dexter,2boq5t,TwistedChemical,2,Fri Jul 25 17:55:40 2014 UTC,you just described season two
Dexter,2boq5t,rawrslcles,0,Sun Jul 27 22:11:38 2014 UTC,Agreed.
Dexter,2boq5t,greyspatter,3,Fri Jul 25 18:03:39 2014 UTC,Every season of the show was Dexter. All different but all Dexter and all great.
Dexter,2boq5t,Sphexus,7,Fri Jul 25 17:47:52 2014 UTC,Did you just say that season 8 was great?
Dexter,2boq5t,greyspatter,-4,Fri Jul 25 18:06:22 2014 UTC,"Compared to the rest, no, but compared to other shows yes"
Dexter,2boq5t,Mrs_Damon,12,Fri Jul 25 18:51:07 2014 UTC,"I truly, honestly believe Season 8 of Dexter is one of the worst seasons of a television show to have ever been put on air. Huge claim but ""disappointing"" really doesn't begin to describe it. I recently rewatched Season 2 with a few friends that have never seen Dexter and I was honestly amazed how intrigued I was for every episode.. and I already knew what was going to happen! Good times.  As a whole, the final season took everything that was built up in the past 7 seasons of this series and just took a great, big dump on it. Seasons 5 & 6 were not well-received but putting aside all their weaknesses, we always had the hope that maybe next season will be better and Season 7 really did give us that hope. From the fantastic character of Isaak Sirko (played fucking brilliantly by Ray Stevenson) and the HOLY SHIT LAGUERTA ACTUALLY DIES?! moment, we were anticipating something that at least kept us entertained for however many episodes. If you can honestly say you watched Season 8 of Dexter and didn't roll your eyes or get bored at least 10 times, I applaud your patience. I gave it the benefit of the doubt, I thought maybe it'll get better in the final few episodes, maybe it's just starting out slow but no... we were Treadmill'd.  In these types of threads I always like to point out /u/furiousBobCat's great thread about how the entirety of Season 8 is essentially a great, big filler."
Dexter,2boq5t,TheHellFish,3,Fri Jul 25 20:30:29 2014 UTC,"Thank you, that thread is awesome!"
Dexter,2boq5t,Sphexus,3,Fri Jul 25 21:25:45 2014 UTC,I honestly can't think of a show that had a season worse than Dexter season 8. some shows are bad but Dexter season 8 took every good thing about Dexter and took a giant shit on it.
Dexter,2boq5t,macjunkie,1 point,Fri Jul 25 20:43:14 2014 UTC,The season with trinity was best one IMO and should have been season 3 and the last one
Dexter,2boq5t,Delayeddd,1 point,Sat Jul 26 02:07:03 2014 UTC,I get what you mean but do you think there would have been enough story line to have 8 seasons focused solely on Dexter?
Dexter,2boq5t,walterpinkman45,-1,Wed Jul 30 14:13:52 2014 UTC,Lila was new in season 2
Dexter,2bn4hm,jerkuspeenus,76,Thu Jul 24 23:13:48 2014 UTC,Biggest mistake was not having season 8 be a massive inquiry into LaGuerta's death with Dexter as prime suspect.
Dexter,2bn4hm,Pete_Worst,16,Fri Jul 25 10:53:03 2014 UTC,still cant believe that they let that situation go quietly into the night
Dexter,2bn4hm,FoxylambA,42,Sat Jul 26 16:52:49 2014 UTC,Part of me always wanted there to be a copycat Ice Truck Killer in one of the later seasons. I thought it would have been interesting for Dexter to see his brother's work popping up even though he already knew what happened to him.
Dexter,2bn4hm,xerophyl,33,Thu Jul 24 23:55:51 2014 UTC,"They tried really, really hard to make Oliver Saxon as interesting as Brian was, but well, it didn't work."
Dexter,2bn4hm,Nothox,37,Fri Jul 25 02:19:37 2014 UTC,Louis Greene in season 7 was such a wasted character in my opinion. I thought it was really interesting watching him send Dexter that box. I really thought they were going to turn him into a killer.
Dexter,2bn4hm,xerophyl,14,Fri Jul 25 02:26:44 2014 UTC,"I've read somewhere that Louis was supposed to be the big bad in season 8, but Michael C. Hall didn't agree with this idea. Not sure if this is true tho."
Dexter,2bn4hm,Nothox,13,Fri Jul 25 02:30:20 2014 UTC,That would have been so much more interesting than Saxon. That way we'd have his character more developed and build him up to be a big bad instead of Saxon popping in out of nowhere.
Dexter,2bn4hm,xerophyl,6,Fri Jul 25 02:37:56 2014 UTC,And that's why you shouldn't always listen to the actors
Dexter,2bn4hm,Fabien_Lamour,2,Fri Jul 25 11:28:47 2014 UTC,He was a producer as well.
Dexter,2bn4hm,jetpacksforall,2,Wed Jul 30 12:47:17 2014 UTC,"I heard that as well, apparently Louis's actor wanted to do Broadway as well and since Hall didn't like the story (rumoured to be because Hall thought it was stupid that Miami Metro would have 2 serial killers working independently of each other in it) they decided to let Louis die."
Dexter,2bn4hm,duckwantbread,2,Sat Jul 26 21:49:52 2014 UTC,"rumoured to be because Hall thought it was stupid that Miami Metro would have 2 serial killers working independently of each other in it   Which I don't really understand.  It's not as though Louis just happened to be working at Miami Metro, it is clear he sought Dexter out specifically.  It's a shame too, because he seemed like he was developing into a decent 'villain', but then he turned into a pissy manchild and got killed off in a really dumb way.  I hope MCH is just covering for someone."
Dexter,2bn4hm,Sideshow_Slob,10,Tue Jul 29 13:14:21 2014 UTC,The least they could have done was just hire Ryan Gosling instead of a lookalike.
Dexter,2bn4hm,SexLiesAndExercise,55,Fri Jul 25 10:23:33 2014 UTC,Biggest mistake was introducing multiple love interests after Rita. It just didn't work.
Dexter,2bn4hm,echopath,12,Fri Jul 25 06:03:22 2014 UTC,Agreed. I could never quite forget the first season where he is fairly asexual and using Rita as a convenient cover.
Dexter,2bn4hm,MargotFenring,40,Mon Jul 28 05:20:49 2014 UTC,"I'd say having Doakes find out Dexter is the Bay Harbor Butcher, then killing him off in the second season is the worst."
Dexter,2bn4hm,hashtagLJB,23,Fri Jul 25 04:21:24 2014 UTC,They played the whole Doakes detective thing perfectly. I just wish they found SOME way for him to live.
Dexter,2bn4hm,HerpDerpMapleSerp,14,Fri Jul 25 07:36:09 2014 UTC,"Reprise, motherfucker?"
Dexter,2bn4hm,nameless88,11,Fri Jul 25 12:54:17 2014 UTC,There probably wasn't one without making him a 'season 6 Quinn'...
Dexter,2bn4hm,TheHellFish,9,Fri Jul 25 08:20:25 2014 UTC,"I would have preferred ROBO DOAKES if it meant him staying on. Or maybe he could have escaped into the swamp and not be seen until say s5? Or maybe instead of killing him and then getting killed, Lila could drug him and drag him off to Paris or something without Dexter finding out and stay there for a while."
Dexter,2bn4hm,HerpDerpMapleSerp,2,Fri Jul 25 08:23:20 2014 UTC,Just hearing Robo Doakes made me laugh... I would pay to see that movie
Dexter,2bn4hm,kirotokai,3,Fri Jul 25 08:59:57 2014 UTC,I'd almost be willing to fund it.
Dexter,2bn4hm,HerpDerpMapleSerp,2,Fri Jul 25 10:06:21 2014 UTC,Would have been fine if they wrote a better season 3 and ended it after 4.
Dexter,2bn4hm,SexLiesAndExercise,3,Fri Jul 25 10:24:10 2014 UTC,"If I had the power to make one change, I'd flip Season 2 to the end. Season 2 was what Season 8 should have been. You can't blame the writers for going with their best shot early on since it's no guarantee how long a show last, but Season 2 was the best season and the most tense season episode to episode."
Dexter,2bn4hm,NJS212,10,Sat Jul 26 04:49:55 2014 UTC,"killing him was kind of intricate to that plot line, and a lot of things that came up later in the series.  his return in the form of his dark passenger is what should have stayed. it was great to see dexter back to his season 1 self when brian was showing up after dexter's real dad died.   it should have been like.. an angel on one shoulder and a demon on the other with harry and brian, dexter always caught in the middle, trying to figure out which side to embrace. that's a true sociopath. not someone gradually becoming more and more human."
Dexter,2bn4hm,Nebakanezzer,1 point,Fri Jul 25 05:16:47 2014 UTC,"Weeeeeelll  A psychopath is not a sociopath.  Although a psychopath wouldn´t even have an angel/devil conflict or any empathy for his victims at all.  Sociopaths, by the term are people that can actually feel or relate to their victims in SOME way, it is a mix of behaviour they have been born with any social circumstances that changed their behaviour for the worst."
Dexter,2bn4hm,WFAlex,15,Wed Oct 1 11:42:10 2014 UTC,Lumberjacks.
Dexter,2bn4hm,daveleclair,8,Fri Jul 25 07:51:15 2014 UTC,"I feel the same!!! Should have saved the sibling rivalry for season 8. If his brother had killed his sister, it would have added so much!"
Dexter,2bn4hm,MrRational92,9,Fri Jul 25 01:44:34 2014 UTC,I'd say the biggest mistake was not having and endgame and working towards it organically over the course of the several years of storytelling.
Dexter,2bn4hm,dpmcg,4,Fri Jul 25 15:59:53 2014 UTC,"Exactly, from the very first season it was clear the show could only end one of two ways: Dexter is either dead or on death row."
Dexter,2bn4hm,Moronoo,1 point,Fri Jul 25 16:49:32 2014 UTC,"it was clear the show could only end one of two ways: Dexter is either dead or on death row.   It could have ended a number of ways and been great.  The actual ending could have been good if the rest of the season wasn't so brutal.  The thing that should have happened in the final season is people finding out and/or Dexter being tracked down.  It seemed like they were building up to that in season 7, but they inexplicably tossed that aside in season 8."
Dexter,2bn4hm,Sideshow_Slob,1 point,Tue Jul 29 13:31:08 2014 UTC,"Oh I agree, the whole season was bad, the lumberjack thing didn't even really bother me. I just couldn't take anything seriously anymore."
Dexter,2bn4hm,Moronoo,5,Tue Jul 29 15:40:51 2014 UTC,Agreed. Have you read the books?
Dexter,2bn4hm,RobertPaulsen39,3,Thu Jul 24 23:38:59 2014 UTC,I haven't.
Dexter,2bn4hm,RobertPaulsen39,4,Fri Jul 25 00:03:11 2014 UTC,Sounds like you should. You might enjoy the fresh perspective.
Dexter,2bn4hm,jmarseneault,2,Fri Jul 25 00:13:16 2014 UTC,What perspective are the books written in? I love dexter but for some reason loathe reading fiction. I may give em a shot.
Dexter,2bn4hm,RobertPaulsen39,1 point,Fri Jul 25 03:58:47 2014 UTC,"It's a mix of first person and third. Mostly first. After the first book, all the books are like an alternate timeline from the show. New stories and characters. Also, familiar faces that differ from the show."
Dexter,2bn4hm,latsyrcami,3,Fri Jul 25 14:22:36 2014 UTC,"Def read the books! they are so good. But after the first one, the series didnt follow them at all. Even the first book's ending is way different than the first season. Personally I like the books a lot!"
Dexter,2bn4hm,IRLDisneyPrincess,5,Fri Jul 25 01:03:45 2014 UTC,"I'm with you on this one. Brian was my favorite character in s1 (and probably the entire series, to be honest) - I wished we'd gotten to get into his head a little more."
Dexter,2bn4hm,kesuaus,12,Fri Jul 25 09:07:03 2014 UTC,Biggest mistake was that blonde bitch
Dexter,2bn4hm,bmilo,4,Fri Jul 25 09:07:51 2014 UTC,Rita was ok in Season 1.
Dexter,2bn4hm,kesuaus,4,Fri Jul 25 17:19:36 2014 UTC,I do not have a problem with Rita...
Dexter,2bn4hm,bmilo,4,Fri Jul 25 20:17:30 2014 UTC,"See what I did there, you did not."
Dexter,2bn4hm,kesuaus,4,Fri Jul 25 21:18:34 2014 UTC,"It is hard to predict what is going on in your mind , it is not like I can see your face neither hear the tone of your voice . There are a lot of people with different opinion .. hell , there are people who like Joffrey (GoT)"
Dexter,2bn4hm,bmilo,3,Fri Jul 25 21:33:34 2014 UTC,"I knew you meant Hannah, but honestly I couldn't stand Rita season 2 on."
Dexter,2bn4hm,kesuaus,3,Fri Jul 25 22:03:33 2014 UTC,"Hm ,idk man Rita was ok  not my favorite character but she was ok  but the ending ... Dexter becoming  lumberjack is ok becuase he deserved that shit .. but his sister dieing and that  blonde bitch getting his kid is just unfair .. she should have died ."
Dexter,2bn4hm,ura0124,1 point,Sat Jul 26 08:42:10 2014 UTC,"all of the ladies were blonde except for Lila (i'm only on season 7), example :Rita, Lumen, and Hannah"
Dexter,2bn4hm,kesuaus,1 point,Fri Aug 8 11:35:45 2014 UTC,Hannah is that bitch
Dexter,2bn4hm,sean7291,19,Sat Aug 9 00:27:14 2014 UTC,Hannah Mckay..
Dexter,2bn4hm,Texas_Rangers,4,Fri Jul 25 09:08:32 2014 UTC,shit i liked ehr
Dexter,2bn4hm,broncoz33,6,Mon Jul 28 07:56:24 2014 UTC,I really liked the part (cant remember what season but I think it was after he drowned that dude in a fit of rage) where his dark passenger was represented by his brother rather than Harry. I felt like that could have been a really cool full season arc and then they had the whole thing come and go in a single episode.
Dexter,2bn4hm,Fuzzy-Hat,3,Fri Jul 25 13:07:05 2014 UTC,"That might have been diffeicult to do though, If James Remar was under contract they couldn't just be like oh you aren't going to be in this season . But definitely would have been really cool to have Brian as the dark passenger for more than one episode."
Dexter,2bn4hm,Beehzy,3,Fri Jul 25 14:19:30 2014 UTC,I was actually thinking a few days ago of how the series could have turned out if the first two seasons were the last two season and all the plot wholes in between got fixed... Any thoughts?
Dexter,2bn4hm,Kembawalker1,2,Fri Jul 25 14:16:48 2014 UTC,The worst decision I always thought was the horrible was killing of Doakes. I understand how the tension and issue between Dexter and Doakes led to his demise but he was just such a badass character and will always be my favorite.
Dexter,2bn4hm,NJS212,2,Fri Jul 25 17:46:46 2014 UTC,"Trinity deservedly gets a lot of love, but Biney was my favorite villain on the show. I loved his story and his character."
Dexter,2bn4hm,xBi11,2,Sat Jul 26 04:48:20 2014 UTC,Not having Deb's eyes open as she sinks to the bottom of the ocean with Dexter being unable to save her.
Dexter,2bn4hm,agamedivine,1 point,Sat Aug 2 06:36:05 2014 UTC,"Agreed. Deb should've been dead in the first season, not Brian."
Dexter,2bn4hm,kingkoons,1 point,Fri Jul 25 07:46:22 2014 UTC,yes! this and killing doakes. they kinda painted him into corner so that they only way to continue the show was kill him. i thought that he had so much potential and was/is my favorite Dexter character.
Dexter,2bn4hm,MargotFenring,1 point,Sat Jul 26 15:25:09 2014 UTC,"I always wanted them to have a season where Dexter finds out his father was murdered and made to look like a suicide by one of his colleagues. The season would follow the arc of Dexter's discovery, his investigation, the reveal of who did it and why and how and of course, Dexter gutting them like a fish. Would that not have been awesome?"
Dexter,2bn4hm,Lecter07,1 point,Mon Jul 28 05:17:56 2014 UTC,"There were many issues with the series.  The biggest misake IMO, is renewing it for an 8th season. It was obvious that the writers just said fuck all to writing the series seriously and just didn't care anymore.   This show has two parts for me, Part 1 is season 1 through 4. Part 1 ends with Dexter's wife murdered by the Trinity Killer.  Part 2 is Season 5 through 7. At the end of Part 2 Dexter is shot in a shipping container by Debra Morgan, and he imagines that she shot La Guerta as the synapses and chemicals in his brain begin to disengage and his entire thought process begins to break down."
Dexter,2bn4hm,dazzledor,1 point,Tue Jul 29 17:04:37 2014 UTC,"Because stupid assholes were coming online and spoiling season 1 based on the book, so they had to change some things."
Dexter,2bn4hm,Kembawalker1,1 point,Thu Jul 31 21:18:45 2014 UTC,Killing Doakes and Brian was the worst thing
Dexter,2bn4hm,mrpud,2,Fri Aug 8 02:58:15 2014 UTC,no it wasn't
Dexter,2bn4hm,Dwight--Schrute,-6,Fri Jul 25 02:02:51 2014 UTC,Making this show is the biggest mistake. The ending sucks so bad. Walter White made Dexter his bitch.
Dexter,2bn9gy,lutzauto,5,Fri Jul 25 00:03:59 2014 UTC,"i JUST watched this episode (never watched the show before, wife and i have powered thru 7 seasons on netflix in ~<3 weeks)"
Dexter,2bmrnq,nitram916,12,Thu Jul 24 21:16:16 2014 UTC,"I can give you my personal season score, but bear in mind that it is way too subjective.  Season 1: 9/10  Season 2: 9/10  Season 3: 7/10  Season 4: 10/10  Season 5: 7/10  Season 6: 8/10 (I'm one of the people who really liked that season, despite it's flaws)  Season 7: 8/10 (I'd give some parts even 10/10, but some other episodes bothered me, so only 8/10 overall)  Season 8 part one: 7/10  Season 8 part two: 2/10  That being said, watch it all and make your own opinion, it's worth it. And despite what my score probably suggests, I don't regret watching the second part of the final season."
Dexter,2bmrnq,TheHellFish,3,Thu Jul 24 21:34:08 2014 UTC,I actually agree with this exactly. The Trinity killer was the best thing that could have happened to the series.
Dexter,2bmrnq,BigMacka,13,Fri Jul 25 11:24:29 2014 UTC,How can people rate season 4 above season 1?  It really wasn't that great.
Dexter,2bmrnq,jerkuspeenus,3,Thu Jul 24 23:11:16 2014 UTC,"I think the ending really makes Season 4 better than it was. I LOVED Lithgow's performance....one of the five best I've seen when it comes to TV shows.   That said, there were a lot of wasted moments in that season. Some of the side plots could have been cut without it effecting the overall plot. Season 4 is third on my list behind the first two."
Dexter,2bmrnq,NJS212,2,Sat Jul 26 04:58:46 2014 UTC,"Mainly because John Lithgow played a serial killer. I had no idea who he actually was until I finished season 4, and overall I like seasons 1-3 better.   PLUS THEY FUCKING KILLED OFF LUNDY! He waa supposed to be the one to find Dexter out! :("
Dexter,2bmrnq,iNachozi,5,Sat Jul 26 06:08:40 2014 UTC,Looking forward to season 4 based on your ratings :>

Every season had it's ups and downs, but for the most part I loved all of it."
Dexter,2bmrnq,Beehzy,5,Thu Jul 24 21:29:54 2014 UTC,Season two is love season two is life
Dexter,2bmrnq,ariarows,5,Thu Jul 24 23:15:22 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the answers, I really dislike the new characters introduced in S3 (especially Joey) RIP Doakes best character"
Dexter,2bmrnq,Spencer1199234,10,Thu Jul 24 21:56:34 2014 UTC,Joey gets better.
Dexter,2bmrnq,PARK_THE_BUS,2,Thu Jul 24 23:34:50 2014 UTC,"Agreed  Just started rewatching, and I still hate Joey."
Dexter,2bmrnq,TheHellFish,3,Thu Jul 24 22:58:08 2014 UTC,From best to least in my view:  Season 2: 9.5/10  Season 1: 9/10  Season 3: 9/10  Season 5: 8.5/10  Season 4: 8/10  Season 7: 7.5/10  Season 6: 5/10

Forget season 8.  I say simple because that IS simple compared to the complete rewrites I'd like to have ideally seen."
