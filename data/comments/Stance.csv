Stance,3dqlt1,Bo5ibbs,2,Sat Jul 18 20:14:04 2015 UTC,I'm about to toss some 17x9's on my supercharged RSX Type S real soon. Def wanting to go with the functional look.
Stance,3dqlt1,lifegoes0n,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:36:48 2015 UTC,I like these wheels but they are on the larger size. Fronts are 18x9.5+22 with 265/35/18 and rears are 18x10.5+22 with 235/40/18.  I kinda want to go with all 4 wheels and tires the same to keep a track stance.
Stance,3dqlt1,lifegoes0n,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:54:47 2015 UTC,Wow that's huge. That would need insane camber on an rsx.

Stance,3dpi17,That_Other_Person,2,Sat Jul 18 20:38:27 2015 UTC,Actually they are totally fine! I've had friends open up their headlights and paint the housings and they have a lot of trouble because it covers the chrome reflectors. Mine still work really well because it's just vinyl tint.

Stance,3dfgou,Kabizzle,9,Wed Jul 15 21:35:42 2015 UTC,So I notice one is basically touching the ground and tucking the entire tire while the other one still has a sizable amount of clearance and upper tire showing.  Are these two different actual types of stance?  If so explain what they are.  Or is it the same style one just happens to be slammed harder?
Stance,3dfgou,BucketOfBiscuits,18,Wed Jul 15 22:29:25 2015 UTC,Kinda like track stance to hella flush
Stance,3dfgou,Kabizzle,5,Wed Jul 15 23:05:27 2015 UTC,"I'd say they're on opposite sides of the spectrum of what's considered stanced. My legacy is static with lots of ground clearance, mild camber and no tire stretch, while the impreza is bagged with almost 4° of camber, decent stretch, and not a whole lot of ground clearance."
Stance,3dfgou,Volcanicz,2,Wed Jul 15 23:11:47 2015 UTC,Is there a specific degree of camber where it turns from functional to show?
Stance,3dfgou,ThatFuckinGuy-,3,Wed Jul 15 23:58:26 2015 UTC,I guess that depends on what you use the car for. My buddies with drift cars all have rediculous camber in the front so that they get more grip when the wheel's turned.
Stance,3dfgou,Matador91,3,Thu Jul 16 00:09:08 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen or heard of anything more than maybe a couple degrees on the front wheels. If your friends are running some crazy shit, I'd love some specifics if you can get em."
Stance,3dfgou,TrueTurtleKing,2,Thu Jul 16 06:46:25 2015 UTC,"I run -3.5 front  Not for any good reason really, just what it came out to with the strut tops. I find it handles more than adequately, but 2.5-3 might be better than what I've got.   http://imgur.com/a/uttzj"
Stance,3dfgou,adamthebeast,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:22:21 2015 UTC,I always understood it as form vs. function. Form is achieved by laying frame as low as possible while tucking the wheels with absolute perfect amounts of camber. Function still lets the driver get a lot of daily use out of the car while still maintaining some stance.

I highly suggest that you get to know your car better, by doing it yourself. It's a good habit. I could have spent $150+ for someone else to do the install, instead I did it at a hobby shop and paid $55 for a stall, taking my time.  A quick google came up with this guide: http://www.myturbodiesel.com/wiki/strut-and-shock-absorber-replacement-for-mk4-vw/  It looks better than the one I used yesterday for my coils."

It's fun as fuck to spend hours in the driveway with a pizza and some music just doing things. And I absolutely understand that poor high school or college students aren't gonna go out and drop 2k on coilovers or whatever but it's worth remembering that while you may be confident in yourself, the things you do to your car can effect other people on the road as well.  A lot of the stuff they do is dangerous and irresponsible not necessarily on purpose but just because of that ""fuck it"" attitude. It's entertaining but important to remember not to fuck up your suspension, brakes or tires too much because those are what keep your car actually on the road.  That said, for how much these kids come across as annoying fuccbois to me most of the time, I'll be damned if it isn't entertaining to watch their antics."

Former American military here myself, I can tell you, there was not a week that did not go by that we got briefed on a DWI or DUI that happened within our squadron. Just think about that, once a week there was at least one DUI or DWI in my squadron. It was such a issue that there was a counter at HQ that displayed the days, hours, minuets and seconds from the last DWI we had. I never seen it go past 7 days in the 3 years I was there. This is in the Marine Corps too. Just to think that the other branches are much bigger than us, puts a very startling idea of how many more military members are still not getting the message or the frequency of DUI's and DWI's.   Sorry for your buddies loss and I hope the solider gets whats coming to him. I think these days just one DWI or DUI is a first class ticket out of the military and a dishonorable discharge.  I hope everyone survived and will make a full recovery."

The number of people who were at risk (Yes I drink too much, yes I think about hurting myself, etc) was too high, so you know how they addressed it? They made us do it again.

Sold it about 4 years later and threw all the money from that car into the next one. 21 now and still put money into the car. You'll never have it done in a week.

Stance,3cdbtd,michaelbrewer7,2,Tue Jul 7 06:28:35 2015 UTC,"The core of stance is rebuilt suspension. Choose a reliable platform, new struts, springs, suspension hardware, depending on the platform upgraded suspension doesn't have to cost a ton of money. Some may disagree, but Amazon, Rockauto.com and eBay have decent parts if you research what you are buying first. Research the forums, get a decent tool kit ( Sears has full kits with warranty starting @ $200), download a good shop manual and jump in. Make friends on the forums, ask for help, get an alignment to dial in suspension settings, and have fun. Read up on basic automotive safety, and invest in a decent jack and jackstands. Harbor freight and most auto parts stores have these at a decent price."
Stance,3cdbtd,takeitapart4x,2,Tue Jul 7 18:33:34 2015 UTC,"I grew up on a farm, fixing shit is a given. Learning how to fix things is just part of the game so when I got my first car all I wanted to do was learn how everything worked and went together. If you don't know how to do something, ask a friend who's done it before or look it up on Youtube. Most importantly take your time. Rushing to get something done is how stuff ends up broke. If you get frustrated or confused, step back and take a second to think things through."
Stance,3cdbtd,anussnake,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:41:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly? Your biggest and most difficult purchase, is actually finding a car that you like, and envisioning what you want out of it.  Everything else slowly falls into place. Saving money, making plans, doing things yourself. Meeting great people along the way that'll help you do your suspension for some beer and food, rather than paying a shop to do it.  Keep your eyes out for good deals, and just enjoy it at the end of the day.  Cars don't get modded over night, they take time. Be patient, tha'ts something i've learned. Don't rush, don't half ass it. Do it once, do it right, you'll save more money that way. There's a reason why some things are more expensive than others, even though they ""seem"" like they're the same thing!"

This is just based on speculation but I think the reason Kei Miura decided to go with such a crazy front end is because there's a huge number of enthusiasts in Japan who are interested in classic American muscle. It's sort of the same idea as it is in North America, we all want something rare, sought-after and difficult to obtain (i.e every Skyline ever when it comes to enthusiasts in North America). This kit is basically a response to that, have a cool, vintage muscle car without having to pay upwards of $30,000 and trying to figure out how to get it imported to Japan"

If you have a big turbo look for a 3"" inlet and outlet.  You can find any Mr muffler type shop and they should do the work for you.

Stance,3bndq8,S13Josh,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:03:59 2015 UTC,"Grip royal is one of the better lower end brands. I've heard great things while never personally having one. If its out of your price range I highly recommend saving the money until you can afford a better wheel. The problem with the cheaper wheels is they aren't one piece, they are multiple pieces glued together and over time they wear out and break. Now when you're dealing with something that controls the entire vehicle you really don't want to run the risk of it breaking when you're driving 60+ mph down the freeway. Just my .02."
Stance,3bndq8,lostamusement,2,Tue Jun 30 18:47:06 2015 UTC,"This. Going cheap on something like a steering wheel is not smart. Like s13Josh said, the steering wheel is essential (obviously) to driving, and if it breaks mid-drive, youre gonna have a bad time. I own a Grip Royal wheel on my s2000, and its a really nice wheel for the price. I didnt have 500$ to spend on a Nardi, so I got a Grip Royal. Definitely save up some more money and get a Grip Royal."

Stance,3bhhyb,pearsond,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:35:50 2015 UTC,Yeah  exhaust resonator mufflers it alot but it still shoots them. the main reason I bought it was because the ecu I put in raised the red line to 7.5k were the stock was 7k and I didn't want to harm the engine so I used the bee*r to lower it back down to 7k just to stay safe

Stance,3bfi1h,ButtersWorth124,9,Sun Jun 28 19:35:07 2015 UTC,"The HDR look doesn't work on this, and you definitely need more light. The ISO looks pretty high leading to grain and the image is flat over all. Definitely could use some color. If you had gone out an hour or two earlier, you'd be in perfect sweet light, aka the golden hour.  Also, definitely try to find a better location. Your shutter speed was pretty short which means the background isn't blurred enough and takes away from the subject. Leading lines are a necessity in rolling shots due to the naturally formed lines because of a longer exposure. This shot is a decent example. Still, the background is pretty distracting."

Stance,3bfi1h,Mr_ForTheNguyen,2,Mon Jun 29 18:05:16 2015 UTC,"Digging it. Aggressive, but subtle."
Stance,3bfi1h,redpointholds,2,Sun Jun 28 20:58:30 2015 UTC,"Only recommendation I have other than what has already been said is try to get different angles (safely). It's kinda boring if I can just look out my window and see the same thing as the pictures. Getting low, closer to ground  always looks nice. Just be careful not to drop your camera. Or if there's a sunroof on camera car try to get a high angle. Just get creative with it!"
Stance,3bfi1h,mynameisgoose,2,Mon Jun 29 01:11:54 2015 UTC,"Hey man, good composition on this, I like the sign in the back, the car is positioned well and the angle is pretty decent. Like everyone else says, lighting is far from ideal. Did you post process in Lightroom? If you selected a mask on the car to lighten it up, thats good but make sure nothing bleeds around the edges like on the front end.  Try not to take any pics in direct sunlight, you get very sharp reflections from the sun that makes a very dynamic light range so its hard to get a full representation of the curves on the car. Golden light, or even a bit after the sun goes down is ideal since the light is still warm but soft enough it bathes the curves and you get a very nice sense of the vehicle without the aggressive shadows and highlights.  Shutter speed should be about 1/40-1/60 travelling at about 80km/hr to get a nice amount of movement so compensate ISO accordingly. Try to shoot with a high f-stop to give it some nice depth.  In post, you can add some blur if you want, but I like to just tone down the highlights, bring out the shadows, play with exposure and boost clarity & saturation."
Stance,3bfi1h,i-jk,2,Mon Jun 29 02:42:01 2015 UTC,"Check this out if you already haven't.  As you've probably already realized, you need more light, higher vehicle speed, and slower shutter speed to accurately capture the ""speed of travel"" in the photo.  Take a lot more shots and pick ones that came out best. Good luck.  Looking forward to your next shoot."
Stance,3bfi1h,dubson,3,Mon Jun 29 03:31:23 2015 UTC,"Here ya go, have a edit. I noticed the original was a bit light so I messed with some values to make it looks a somewhat cleaner. I think it's a little too sharp but let me know what you think. http://i.imgur.com/9UFzfer.jpg"
Stance,3bfi1h,redpointholds,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:20:15 2015 UTC,"If there was a bit more light that would be good because you could bring the ISO down and reduce grain. Lower ISO = clearer image typically, but will make the image darker. But also when you make the shutter speed longer, the picture will be both less dark (longer time for more light to get in) and have a blurrier background/wheel rotation. The catch for the blurry thing is that the camera has to be super stable. The moving background will be blurry, but so will everything else if the camera is shaking around like crazy. Better if the camera car ISN'T stanced lol.   Dusk is typically the best time to take pics, especially like this. If you do it right in the middle of a bright day, and you do a longer shutter time to get the blurry effect it will be way too bright.   I would go out right before the sun goes down probably an hour before you did in this pic. Turn the ISO down to 100-200, shutter speed of 1/8-1/4"". Keep these set on those settings and adjust the aperture to get the right brightness. Some things like depth of field (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field) change when you change aperture, but because your car is the only thing you're focusing on in rollers, this shouldn't be a problem. With shutter speed and ISO fixed, if the pic is too dark, widen (lower number) the aperture. If the pic is too bright, close (higher number) the aperture.   TL DR:  Slower shutter speed = brighter and blurrier background/wheels. Lower ISO: better image quality, but darker. Lower aperture number: brighter.  After I've finished writing this I have this sinking feeling that you aren't shooting this with an SLR lol.  Good luck, nice car!"
Stance,3bfi1h,Bodie217,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:04:03 2015 UTC,hahah Im shooting with a 60D the issue with the slower shutter speed is our roads are terrible its all slit concrete so it blows so we need to take a field trip to a long smooth road with higher speed limit

Stance,3bc2y0,I_Am_ZapBranniganAMA,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:10:40 2015 UTC,Wood is so the weight of the car can be let down onto the wood without the rims being the thing touching the ground. To get the suspension low you just spin your coils down. For finding out tire size you just see how the wheels fit and then I just look at pictures on the internet of different size tires on my spec wheels till I find one that should work.

Stance,3b4d5j,Hordiyevych,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:24:50 2015 UTC,"As fair as I know, air bags inherently lose stiffness of the suspension, since its air and can be compressed more easily than springs or coilovers. If you're building a track cars you shouldn't go for airs however for normal day to day HSE and maybe some light hooning you'll be fine with them."

Stance,3ark0h,MacAttack0711,6,Mon Jun 22 23:22:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks man! its lowered ~3 inches right now, I was thinking low enough to have no fender gap and have to tuck the wheels slightly. Bags would be super nice, but not really in the budget currently."
Stance,3ark0h,MacAttack0711,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:36:51 2015 UTC,"Tuck is always the cleanest option in my book, just a mild tuck though. Why not save up for some bags instead of going ""half the way"" now? Just an idea... Not to sound dodgy but if you ask the right people you can get a full airlift set up for under 2k..."
Stance,3ark0h,ersenseless1707,3,Tue Jun 23 00:54:33 2015 UTC,"I agree, if you can afford it I would go air. I had air installed on my Passat a few months ago and I will definitely put it on future cars I own. The ability to drive/park slammed but still be able to get into driveways and over speedbumps is worth the money IMO"
Stance,3ark0h,becausebags,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:40:30 2015 UTC,"Air suspension is awesome. You can go as low as you want without sacrificing performance or ride height when you want to drive. That means you can always hit the track day if you want. Also, Air Lift Perfomance's kits offer adjustable dampening allowing you to adjust the suspension to your liking. Paired with the right management, you can have a super reliable air suspension setup."
Stance,3ark0h,deanprkr,2,Thu Jun 25 17:18:46 2015 UTC,"As a Mustang guy, I'm sure you know about AmericanMuscle.com , but in case you don't, they have some coilover kits with lots of examples of how low people have gotten with them.  The SR kit which is only $700 seems to be the most popular (i wonder why...) but there are lot of great customer shots of them installed.  http://www.americanmuscle.com/mustang-coil-over-kits-9498.html  I kinda feel like the domestic muscle cars are starting to test the waters on the stanced style.  I have a 2002 Mustang convertible and that I've gotten pretty low, but i don't know if you'd call it stanced."

I love it, it's comfortable and fast as hell with a little work. I have to say it has been a fairly heavy financial burden though because it's getting old but nothing crazy. Still original clutch, transmission, engine and turbos working like a charm (knock on wood). My dad has a nagaro blue one he got in 2001 when it was new and has done work to it ever since. It's stage 2+ and so fucking fast. Pushes over 20 pounds of boost and gives you whiplash when you step on the gas. We love the cars would recommend but they're getting old dude so unless you find a gem the car might have a few issues. Kind of rambled a bit but hope this helped."

Stance,3afcm2,Lilgti,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:48:33 2015 UTC,Theyre 15x8 et0. I wouldnt recommend any offset less than et10 though. Those fit perfect in my opinion. These stick out just a little bit too much. Would look nicer with a little more negative camber all the way around. the tires in front are 195/50 and the rears are 205/50. The rears rub a ton; I had just bought the wheels like this with these tires. I will be selling these once I get BBS RA's.

Or a combo of one of those items and a TINY bit of camber."

Does flashy aftermarket sideskirts and spoilers make any difference to your aerodynamics? Not really. Does alot of camber and stretched wheels make you car get more grip? Not really.   Stanced cars are attractive to me because they look clean. There's not really that much room between the fenders and the wheels which in my opinion makes the car look really clean. I don't really extreme amount of camber but some people do. I understand that they like their car in that way because that's a big portion why people buy fancy cars because they look good."

Fill out the wheel well and flush or tucked to the fender. That's what I love about this scene. We can take $500 cars or $50k cars and get them low.

Stance,3a2647,that-freakin-guy,12,Tue Jun 16 19:17:06 2015 UTC,"Met a guy in NY this weekend that leased an S4 and put it on bags. I think he was a moron because he's literally pissing money away. His argument was he had a certified Audi mechanic do his work for him so he didn't have to worry about the car needing maintenance, but I was just wondering if he was just really well to do or just an idiot. Not only is he pissing money away on a lease, he spent money on an air system that he'll get shit money for when he takes it off in a couple years to resell it, he's also spending money on maintenance on a car that should have had the maintenance paid for from the get-go, then he returns the car and has absolutely zero capital to bargain with. 100% he's going upside down on his lease because he was a moron. I explained all this to him and he just gave me this retarded expression, like I just showed him the exact moment his parents dropped him on his head when he was a baby. I mean, yeah we drive more in LA but it doesn't take a genius to realize he literally pissed away like $50k he'll never get back, this guy was dense as a board."
Stance,3a2647,tjones123,7,Tue Jun 16 19:50:59 2015 UTC,"Lol jealous? I buy and sell cars, let me explain.   A lease is a loan. You're renting a car basically and with rentals you don't own anything. When you buy a car, you buy capital. You have money when you sell your car, whatever that may be. Let's say you bought a car for $50k and you sell it for $30k, you essentially have $20k you lost so you in essence only spent that amount. You walk in with $30k and you use that money to buy a new car. When you lease a car, you don't have anything. No money to put into the new car, you start at 0. This doesn't negate the fact that you have to out more money out of pocket to buy the new car so you're in even deeper with every car you buy.   So home boy leased his car and lost whatever he paid for the lease, say it was $30k since he didn't pay the full value of the car when he leased. He also spent money on the bag system, on wheels, and he made some of that back when he sold them but only half.   When you modify a leased car you also spend money on maintenance because it's not your car to modify so you don't even get the warranty work that you're offered, so that's more money out of pocket.   Let's say he spent $30k on the car, $3k on bags, $2k on installation, and $2k on annual maintenance, then he returns it and sells what he can and walks out with $1500 for the airbags, but he also spent $2k on removal anyway, so that negates the $1500 he got from selling the bags, so he's in the negative anyway.   If he had bought the car for $50k and sold it for $30k, the same prices would apply for maintenance and such but now he walks out with $25k in pocket.   So you tell me who loses here."
Stance,3a2647,seventh7in,4,Tue Jun 16 22:56:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for explaining this. A friend is about to sell her Subaru and thinking of leasing a Mini Countryman for $210 a month.  So she will have $210 in payments x 36 months = $7560 plus $3250 due at signing. So roughly $3,700 per year to borrow a car vs financing and selling it on the outset. Is there ever a situation where financing makes more sense than purchasing?  I'd guess she would lose a bit of money on the overall value of the car after 3-4 years if she financed the cost, but if its $11k to lease, it might only lose $7-8k in value after 3 years when it was resold if it were financed... Significantly less devaluation if it was a car that held its resale value ie Lexus or something like that."
Stance,3a2647,diphiminaids,6,Tue Jun 16 23:38:50 2015 UTC,"Personally, I never have and never will lease a car. It's so stupid to just throw the money away like that, and my dad made sure I knew this. I also always buy used to avoid immediate depreciation, I'll never buy a car new off the lot. Even just a year old car will save me a ton of money in immediate depreciation.   Just me though. I'd rather have the capital on hand than spend money I'll never get back."
Stance,3a2647,wlee1987,4,Wed Jun 17 00:20:12 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar mindset.

All in the whole lot including the adapter for the canon came to about £45 (~$70).  The f2.5 gives the nice shallow depth of field, the manual focus makes me have to work harder though, so less pictures than normal.  I also haven't done much in the way of post-processing in recent years so I was having a bit too much fun with sliders.  I think next time I'd process them in a slightly more subtle manner :)"

Stance,39swon,diphiminaids,2,Sun Jun 14 22:17:33 2015 UTC,About $2800.  Coil overs were $1300. I got the swift spring upgrade. Without them they're a few bucks from $1000  Wheels were $1000. Bought them off someone who had them for 2 weeks. Came with tires. But i switched them from 205/35 to 205/40 so the tires ran me another $500. The wheels are $280 a piece brand new.

I mean drag racing, autocross, and rally racing are all harsh on cars, but that's what those cars were made for. I don't know of any factory cars whose sole purpose is to scrape over every little bump and dip, while putting an excessive amount of wear and tear on one side of your tires. Help me to understand senpai!"
Stance,39py3e,Arayder,5,Sat Jun 13 20:53:25 2015 UTC,"We don't care that they weren't made to do this. Some people do engine mods and break those parts, other people slam their cars and break different parts. We're all car enthusiasts, some people just express it in different ways. You said it yourself, drag cars, rally cars, race cars, they didn't come from the factory like that. They were modified for those different reasons and, like you said, it's hard on them and they break. Slammed cars also were modified for a purpose, just like every other car that is changed from stock to something different. It is a good way to break your car. Even stock cars break at some point though, and atleast my car is breaking while I'm doing what I like to do."

Stance,39j2u6,seanmcgeef,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:33:20 2015 UTC,"I can give you some tips.   When you shoot, try to keep your car as far as possible into your lane and the subject as far as possible from your car into his lane so you have more room to shoot without shooting your own car.  On this picture, the car is a little bit too far at the back, try lining the front of his bumper to your doors (may vary depending if you have a 2 or 4 doors).  Your best friend while shooting cars is a CPL filter, it'll remove most if not all reflections and it'll help with you avoid being mirrored into their paint.   You can also play with your shutter speed to make different effects (like the car is moving faster or slower, it'll also let you see the wheels or make them blurry)."

However mine was mostly due to my car being the test drive model so it never got a chance to warm up before people smashed on it.  Letting those cars warm up properly is super important because of the head being made from like 3 or 4 different kinds of metal that all heat up at different rates.

Stance,38rxz0,BlackMacGyver,5,Sat Jun 6 08:05:04 2015 UTC,"People don't slam their car with stretched tyres, negative camber and all that jazz for performance reasons"
Stance,38rxz0,ebolacast,2,Sat Jun 6 19:41:35 2015 UTC,"Some of the cars have bags, some don't. I used to have bags and got rid of them so I could ride lower, rather than just park low. I'm on 34k springs to make up for how low I am now.   When you stretch a tire, it doesn't move around on the wheel. There's no real reason for stretching other than getting more clearance for most people.   To a certain extent, negative camber can be helpful. Up to probably negative 3 or 4 degrees, it can help with cornering and grip. Anything more than that is mostly stylistic at this point. It's also very helpful in fitting much more aggressive wheels than the car could normally run."
Stance,38rxz0,Solarcoaster,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:23:54 2015 UTC,Thank you.
Stance,38rxz0,phamtime,2,Sun Jun 7 05:27:32 2015 UTC,"Hopefully I can chime in and give some input (being a huge stance fan myself)  The camber/stance thing is a style (or lifestyle as many put it). Being low and as cambered as possible while still being somewhat functional.   Most cars that have no clearance on the wheel well typically are driven like that. People take pride in being low and still being able to get around. If you are slammed, tires rub against the fenders/wheel wells all the time. You can fix this by rolling your fenders or stretching a thinner tire to get more clearance. Some cars have the proper stiff suspension to handle being this low but some just cut their springs or find cheaper ways to lower their car. Most times it really isn't feasible to drive low, people make sacrifices such as taking alternative routes, avoiding speedbumps etc. Wheel sticking out further than the tire is called stretching heres an example . As mentioned below, most people going the stance route just want a smaller tire to fit on a bigger rim because how nice it looks or simply for clearance (a 235/35/19 allows you to be lower and not rub the fender/wheelwell/etc. than a 265/35/19). Negative camber allows people to get lower (and also a clearance issue). As you lower your car camber will typically camber negatively."

However, if it were mine, a few minor changes. I think it needs to come down just a little bit more. Like0.75-1 inch.  You need more aggressive tires. Lower profile giving a shorter sidewall and narrower as to allow a little bit of stretch. The stretch both for its aesthetic and for fender clearance.  If you did these subtle changes, in my opinion, this car would be a lot sexier and a lot more aggressive.  *The back needs to be dropped slightly more than the front to give it that aggressive squat. I think I heard someone refer to that as rake.  Edit after looking at it again, I think 0.5-0.75 drop may also work too.  TL:DR beautiful car, some minor tweaks would set it off."

If we're talking about stance though, there's minimal wheel settings and the suspension tuning still has a lot missing.  In reality they need to take ProStreet's wheel tuning/autosculpt (it had wheel width, size, tire size, and limited stretch), Shift 2's tuning, add offset, and allow more camber. I'll be happy with that as long as the driving is semi realistic and fun."

Stance,37ytu4,Monkeycrunk,3,Sun May 31 16:20:44 2015 UTC,I love how this is a car you've not seen before so you can enjoy it for what it is. Here they have a stigma as bad / unreliable British cars etc that are sort of fake luxury. Personally having ignored stigma and owned a Rover I rather enjoyed mine. Very rather pleasant cars. This model did have an option with an old Mustang engine in it though which was odd. Not sure if the estate had that option.

Stance,37mf5x,WhenTheFairladySings,3,Thu May 28 21:49:59 2015 UTC,"1 - Its certainly not recommended, but some people do. Then again - Most VW/Audi stuff lay frame when installed properly with ARB removal and chassis notch. This basically makes it near impossible to move without airing up.   2 - The V2 system uses an on board controller that lets you adjust the bag volume at any time. Heck - You can watch the PSI/Bar change mid corner depending on how hard youre driving/   No effect in turning radius Only when aired down. If you air up to a decent height, wheel will clear arch no problem :)"

Stance,37qmcx,flamingXunicorn,3,Fri May 29 16:49:15 2015 UTC,How much camber are you running?  Unless its 7-8 and above you shouldn't be having camber wear problems.  Most wear issues are when the toe is out of alignment.  I ran 6 degrees for over 20K+ (kilometers) and was still able to sell them.  I currently (different car) have less camber but more tire wear simply because my car does not have rear toe adjustment.
Stance,37qmcx,scrapedcrusader,2,Fri May 29 18:43:31 2015 UTC,"I'm only running 3 degrees of camber and 0 degrees of toe, but I guess it's possible they could have gotten out of alignment and maybe that contributed to it. I drove pretty hard on them so I'm sure that didn't help."
Stance,37qmcx,becausephilchow,3,Fri May 29 20:32:49 2015 UTC,"I've run -3 Front / -5 Rear.  Never had to replace a set of tires due to camber wear. That's usually because I sell my wheels.  But, I did 15,000KM on a set of 215/35/18 on 18x9 and 215/40/18 on 18x10 Nankang NS-IIs, and when I took them off, they still easily have 80% tread left on them.  -3 Front, -5 Rear.  Drove down to H20, Ottawa, Montreal, without a single hiccup."
Stance,37qmcx,ccinthed,2,Sat May 30 13:56:49 2015 UTC,"Also, what size tires are you running on what size wheels? I'm running 225's on 9""s and I barely feel stretched, must be the camber that got me.   Tire stretch shouldn't affect tire wear. And you can definitely run more stretch than that, depending on the size of the wheel. Unfortunately in a lot of bigger sizes, 215/225 is the smallest sidewall you can get, especially in 19-20"".  Sidewall height is a big factor too, a 225/30-20 on a 20x9"" was a huge stretch on my wheels when you consider that 225mm = 8.85"". A 225/35 on the same wheel wouldn't be any stretch at all."
Stance,37qmcx,lectrin,1 point,Sat May 30 13:15:34 2015 UTC,"Depends on your tires too. I had some falken azenis that lasted me about 11k miles w/ 3 degrees of camber and 0 degrees toe all round, and I drove extremely hard on them.   Some tires are designed to grip, and some tires are designed to last."

Variants of the Gol were marketed in North America as the Volkswagen Fox from 1987 to 1993.  It has been produced (depending on the generation) as a three and five-door hatchback, four-door sedan (the Volkswagen Voyage), three or five-door station wagon (the Volkswagen Parati) and two-door coupé utility (the Volkswagen Saveiro).  The Gol has been the best-selling car in Brazil for 26 years straight (since 1987) as well as in Argentina since 1988, with over 5 million manufactured in South America since 1980. In March 2013 it was announced that cumulative production of the Gol and its derivatives (Voyage, Saveiro, Parati) had reached 10 million units.

There are 3 that I know of on air. @distorto on instagram has Airlift performance and @tylernol_xtrastrength has distorto's old custom set up (but I think he has airlift performance front struts now??). And then I'm not sure if the newest guy to bag has IG, but he is on the forum.   The only reason its not that popular is that most people don't want to spend $4k on air suspension. Most people on the C30crew are either nearing middle age and more into the performance aspect, or younger and broke."

Stance,3749cj,SHAJ_S4,5,Sun May 24 23:14:56 2015 UTC,"Whew, the rumors seem to be a-flying. The ""SHOW"" aka the VW/Audi show known as Southern Worthersee is was not granted permission to be held within the city limits of Helen, GA. This does NOT mean that Southern Worthersee will not happen in 2016. This only means that it will likely be held outside of the city limits. So it will not be held on the ""mayor's"" field, as it has been for the past few years. The breaking and entering accusations were some attendees that broke in to an abandoned theater to ""sleep"" I suppose. Not necessarily anything harmful, but still illegal.   Reagardless, the way a lot of the attendees acted (specifically on Saturday night) was not acceptable. The show has become so large, that it is definitely difficult to control 25k people in a town which only has 1/50 of that population on a regular basis.  I hope that people that attend next year will be more respectful, especially of the show organizers, who are the only people that have really lost out. We owe it all to them, and it's not fair that people act the way that they do and a completely innocent party is left to suffer the consequences for our doings."

It's a fairly small town, population of 523 I believe, and the show brought in 20k people. I had a great time with my friends, yeah we stood around watching the Burnouts and whatnot I feel kinda guilty for that but that breaking and entering shit, I doubt that was anybody from the show.....but I did see some douchebag having a verbal altercation at a hotel parking lot, then he went back to his c6 corvette to grab his gun, DROPPED IT, then walked with his chest pumped to the other guy. He got held back then told to leave by who im guessing we're his friends, then he drunkenly took off in his vette hauling ass....only to get chased down then taken out of his car and slammed on the ground by a good officer. In daylight.  Other than that the snacks and food were fucking incredibly delicious. Better than the gas station meals I had on the way there and back haha"

Stance,36xxor,rznballa,3,Sat May 23 03:02:11 2015 UTC,I can safely ride lower with coilovers. That's about it.
Stance,36xxor,diphiminaids,3,Sat May 23 04:44:29 2015 UTC,I thought bags were lowest and safest? What dangers did you face bagged?
Stance,36xxor,__celli,6,Sat May 23 04:54:25 2015 UTC,"You can park lower with bags most of the time. But for me to ride at this height on my previous air setup, I would have almost no air in the bags and the suspension would bounce everywhere and provide no support. With very stiff springs, I can ride at this height and no worry so much about bumps."
Stance,36xxor,__celli,2,Sat May 23 04:58:19 2015 UTC,34k?! Holy mother of fuck.   That has to be like riding on a brick for suspension.
Stance,36xxor,namesflory,1 point,Sat May 23 03:01:07 2015 UTC,Honestly with how heavy this car is it's still a little bouncy haha. I wanna upgrade to 80k T-Demand coilovers next year.
Stance,36xxor,__celli,1 point,Sat May 23 04:45:23 2015 UTC,You're talking 80 kilograms per square centimeter suspension? That is absolutely crazy. You literally might as well weld in a bar instead of suspension.   Edit: like I was running 12k/9k on my Celica and that was stiff as fuck. I didn't even know they made 34k.
Stance,36xxor,flyingliz45,2,Sat May 23 04:54:39 2015 UTC,I'm admittedly lost. What does this all mean?
Stance,36xxor,__celli,1 point,Tue May 26 15:05:03 2015 UTC,"Suspension is based off pound per square inch or kilograms per square centimeter.   Essentially, at 500 pounds per square inch (about 10k), it takes 500 pounds of pressure to compress the spring one inch. 34k would be somewhere around 2000 pounds per square inch meaning it would take 8000 pounds to make your whole vehicle drop 1 inch. Essentially meaning there is no bump in the road to make you bottom out unless it's deeper than your car is high."
Stance,36xxor,flyingliz45,1 point,Tue May 26 16:15:50 2015 UTC,i know a few people with 12k on miatas and they don't move almost at all lol.  i guess the weight of the car plays a huge role in that.
Stance,36xxor,__celli,1 point,Sat May 23 05:28:11 2015 UTC,12k on a Miata means you're pinching credit cards.
Stance,36xxor,soflowy,1 point,Sat May 23 05:30:05 2015 UTC,usually yeah haha.  i know a few people with megans track series and bc setups with 12k springs for the track.
Stance,36xxor,diphiminaids,1 point,Sat May 23 05:46:35 2015 UTC,12k track spec on a Miata ? That's just silly. It would cause way too much rear end instability. A track spec Miata should be running around 8k/6k deleting on how much weight reduction.   12k on the rear end of a Miata is just ludacris for performance. You'd fishtail like a motherfucker.

Stance,36vrgk,Rusty_Cabbage,1 point,Sat May 23 06:48:17 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm considering spacers and a taller sidewall with a bit more stretch to account for rubbing; the combination should keep the meat away from the fender.

You'd only have a quarter inch of clearance, not accounting for the width of the hangar... So assume an eighth of an inch for ground clearance, and seeing as how the wheels sit in cutouts which reduce the stiffness of the board. Where the trucks sit, you have to put both feet square in the middle of the board... This thing isn't going anywhere.  Edit: And if it does roll at all, even while scraping, the board is jammed right up against the hangar, so no turning is going to be happening."

Instead you and OP want to leach of the hard work companies put into wheel design by buying the cheap alternative.    Bargain shoes argument is dumb.  The bargain variety isn't a direct copy. Even those guys don't directly rip off other established shoes.  If you bought fake Jordans, I'd make fun of you......like OP.  TE37 = Jordans, Grids = Jawdins.   The ""style"" you mention is directly influenced by the big wheel companies. Grids, XXRs, half of Rotiforms lineup, and all direct copies of well established wheels.  If you and OP keep buying shit wheels, the innovative companies dial back their R and D.    Your mentality kills the after market industry.

If anything your cars worth way more than mine. However, I don't go around boasting about rep wheels like they're anything special.  Your cars fine, looks great, leave it at that.

Stance,36stnp,scrapedcrusader,1 point,Wed May 27 14:56:55 2015 UTC,"Dude didn't claim them to be special. Rota Grids, although they are a knockoff, have more of a name for themselves than the TE.   The OP probably didn't even know they were a knockoff. I'm sure he'd love the TEs instead, given their customization options and company backing, but he only knew of the Grids.   Not everyone is a wheel whore, or is knowledgeable about wheels and the different manufacturers. Some people just see a sick set of wheels at a meet and ask what they are. Go back home and Google them, see that their super affordable and can't wipe the grin off their faces knowing they can actual obtain something they really like.   I wouldn't mind a koenigsegg agera r, but I don't see it and think ""shit, some day I'll afford that. How much can it be? A hundred grand?"" that bitch is millions of dollars.   My dream car and your dream car isn't on a spectrum most people, especially guys new to the car culture, can comprehend.   I'm sure you'd love a nice Alpina B7. But that shit isn't cheap.

I've hung out with him multiple times, hell he even flew out to spend a weekend with me and a couple buddies, and he's always been super cool. He's actually very humble and doesn't brag about his money. Just because he posts pictures of the things he does and has on his instagram doesn't make him an asshole."
Stance,36omr3,BE46ST,1 point,Thu May 21 16:32:21 2015 UTC,Idk who the guy is but is that why people are saying he's a douche and what not? It's just a jealousy thing going on here?
Stance,36omr3,WhenAllElseFail,1 point,Thu May 21 17:33:27 2015 UTC,Essentially yes. He has countless people comment rude things on his IG account about how he's spoiled and ungrateful and it's all his parents money. The funny thing is he doesn't even deny that it's his parents money. He's open about that and constantly thanks them for everything they give him on his instagram account. I don't see how thats being ungrateful at all. I really don't understand where people get such a sour opinion of him. He's actually a really awesome guy.

I enjoy seeing his cool life. One that I work towards being able to live one day. The kid obviously is thankful for what he is fortunate enough to have, has a job,(albeit an incredible one that was handed to him) loves his parents and seems somewhat down to earth.   Who gives a fuck if he has money or not? It's not your problem. Don't dwell on what you do or don't have. Just do what you can to make sure your kids can live as comfortable as he does."

Stance,36kh1c,michaelbrewer7,8,Wed May 20 04:20:48 2015 UTC,"Had a cop drop my ticket from 81mph ticket to a 75 warning because I pulled over immediately, killed the engine, put the keys on the dash then put my wrists over the steering wheel so he could see them as he approached. I only moved when instructed and handed him all needed paperwork. Had me out of there quickly since he knew I was late for work. Most cops are on hair triggers because they've been taught to distrust the populace and negative interactions have reinforced that as you remember negative memories better. They've seen people they thought were nice and normal become animals like a light switch has turned on so they are wary of any approach. The few have ruined it for the many and training/ work culture doesn't make it better."

Stance,369f2j,geromy,2,Sun May 17 22:15:13 2015 UTC,"I was at the cruise'n this year in Ocean City, MD. It is complete bullshit that the city makes this event a sanctioned one, and try to stop h2oi. I love both car shows, but the hot rods are just as obnoxious as the tuner guys."
Stance,369f2j,BoxuvRox,1 point,Mon May 18 01:26:49 2015 UTC,"Except it would be impossible. You can ban the show, but most of the people that go down don't even go to the shows."
Stance,369f2j,ctheit,9,Mon May 18 01:03:19 2015 UTC,"I left when people started throwing bottles at GSP last night, didn't go back this morning. Was the town really trashed?"
Stance,369f2j,budra477,9,Sun May 17 16:09:44 2015 UTC,"It was but there was people right afterwards cleaning everything up. There was guys in the middle of the road last night,  sweeping up the bottles. A buddy of mine saw guys at like 6am still cleaning"
Stance,369f2j,mcd_sweet_tea,11,Sun May 17 16:16:50 2015 UTC,"After going I agree that its sad that Helen was trashed, however these car shows aren't our dad's Good Guy meets, there's a whole different scene and mentality and I think a lot of that is a party scene. While I agree it's terrible that happened to such a nice town as Helen, I think that maybe SoWo needs to move to a more remote area, so that the scene maintains the way it is and the way it thrives, but is far enough away that people who are not overjoyed with that lifestyle do not have the effects forced on them.   I think Helen is an amazing setting due to the whole European style of the town, but as someone who lives in Atlanta and has visited Helen many times with no events going on there, its a tight knit community with a laid back older generation running the whole thing and a more family oriented attraction.   Some people that go to SoWo are not interested in the party aspect at all but let's be honest, almost everyone there was gearing up for last nights block party at 4 p.m. we need to find a remote location thats 20 miles out but close enough to hotels to make it doable. Because like it or not h2oi and sowo are about the whole party atmosphere as much as the cars, its a bunch of people with a shared interest letting loose. And if sowo doesn't get banned next year its going to be the exact same thing."
Stance,369f2j,ctheit,3,Sun May 17 19:35:10 2015 UTC,"So kinda like a Bonnaroo/Woodstock but for cars? It's a good idea, I just cant think of a large enough paved area that you could do it at. Also a big issue is partying at the hotels. Here in Nashville the hotels become party hot spots after Import Alliance closes for the day. The hotels get trashed just like this town, and races go down on the streets and highways around the hotels. The only way I could see that working is if camping at the meet is mandatory to attend."
Stance,369f2j,budra477,3,Sun May 17 20:23:17 2015 UTC,"So, I keyed the words Bonnaroo and cars together and came up with Forza Horizon. How fucking cool would that be?"
Stance,369f2j,budra477,3,Mon May 18 01:30:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah something to that extent. I agree it'd take some work and planning and also you'd have to probably work out some deals with hotels or something to that extent (such as bonaroo/counterpoint etc).  But I feel like this would be a lot more acceptable and more oriented towards the type of crowds these shows attract. I think expecting a show and crowd of these type of people in such large numbers in such a small area is bound to result in issues like these. And I don't feel like its really anybody's fault however I completely understand why the residents of Helen are upset. We just need to hunt down a huge spot in Atlanta with enough accommodations and hotels to handle the people and scene such as this.   I think the way Counterpoint is handled would be a great way to handle things such as SoWo and H2Oi (on a smaller scale than counterpoint obviously.) In georgia. It'd result in a lot more friendly environment to the people going to the shows, and a lot less hurt feelings of the locals."
Stance,369f2j,avidworks,2,Sun May 17 21:44:36 2015 UTC,"Your totally right, it would definitely be better than what went down. Honestly at this point If that cant be done than meets this big need a large police presence. I know some of the cops can be dicks but the meets I've attended with chill cops rocked. No drama no bullshit just a fun time.  Like you said, The locations also really need to prepare for meets this big. Ive been to lots of meets and half of them you cant even find a trashcan to get rid of your trash. No food or drink vendors either, and this is in the summer in the South."
Stance,369f2j,budra477,9,Sun May 17 21:51:46 2015 UTC,"Just saw some pics and videos of what went down. What a bunch of dumb asses. Absolutely trashed that town, shit like that is why meets are getting banned. Stuff like that is happening way to often now. Import Alliance in Nashville almost got shut down for the same thing a few years back. Looks like the locals have started a petition to ban SoWo and they already have over 200 signatures.  Edit: They have over 1000 signatures now on the petition. Good by SoWo in Helen."

At that point it was mostly people coming with show cars and trailers and in the car/fabrication/vendor business. some people got shitty,  but overall not bad. Saturday shit hit the fan. People started flooding in after work and school. Drunk 17 year Olds holding cars in the street to try to make them burn out. Including an elderly family in a mini van, a fire truck, and mini bikes, ripping all the plastics off. Beer bottles smashed in the street, fights... it had so much potential."

H20 is known to be a party, but sowo had a respectable name that was built up for over 5 or 6 years. This respect was easily lost in 2 days cause fuckbois of the stance game wanna be a star. No respect for the VERY LENIENT law enforcement, the people of Helen, the property and roads. Very poor taste. There were reports of someone being robbed at gun point, cars getting trashed, crashed cars, fights, broken glass, robbery, breaking and entering, and then some. Helen has a population of about 530 people, Sowo supposedly brought 20k down there.  Fuck a highway got shut down because people wanted 2 blow some maad dank clouds out of their vapes.

A lady walked up with her child and politely asked them to walk on the street so they wouldn't get it. The kids replied ""It's SOWO. Fuck yourself lady"" right in front of her child. What a bunch of assholes. Also, these same kids decided it was a good idea to tag the cop cars with ""Cambergang"" stickers. Again, what a bunch of assholes. Situation number 2: Last night the cops gave everyone 30 minutes to do as many burnouts as they wanted to. Everyone took advantage of that and started to literally riot in the middle of the streets, causing traffic to back up. The cops at Helen are extremely lenient, and everyone there took advantage of them. Situation number 3: A corvette got pulled over at gunpoint for doing dumb shit and running. Surprise. Situation number 4: There was a video going around of someone mugging a dude at gunpoint and recorded it and put it on Instagram. Smart right?

For the past two years I've been watching videos of SoWo from Mike K and Krispy, dreaming that one day I would have earned a car nice enough that was worth the drive from PA to show to other people. Heck, just this morning I got out of bed and turned on Krispy's 2014 SoWo video for Stance Nation, inspiring myself to work hard enough to have a car among the likes of quality builds from the Dapper Fam guys and others. Just two weeks ago I got my first 5 speed Japanese car, a 97 CD6, and she's not much of a looker but she's mine. I've always loved stance and the stance culture but I can't build this car because I'll be headed to college soon.   For the past two years I've wanted to go to SoWo and hang out with awesome people who love what I love. But thanks to a small group of people who completely trashed the town, I don't think I'll ever get that opportunity. I really respect the people who stayed and cleaned everything up into the early hours of the morning. What a shame."

It was crazy at night, but the Helen PD even said that the people there for SoWo were respectful, and in fact all the officers that I talked to enjoyed the event and talked about how polite people were, and how this was the only meet that cleaned up the mess that was made. People that are complaining are people that don't like car meets, or shouldn't have been there (like many ?I saw at 12am that had their stroller aged and younger children out in the streets. I live in a neighboring city and we have approximately half a million people come for a yearly event (not car related) and all the locals just stay at home or leave town if they don't want to be there.

In most Meets Jury walks past Japs, other Euro's like vauxhall, Peugeot,... cause it isn't a VAG ;-) 85% seen on meets is vag. And  You can't say that a Golf 4/5/6/... on BBS or 3SDM is something special and new.

Stance,3619gh,throwawaystance,14,Fri May 15 06:30:32 2015 UTC,"Now don't get me wrong, I love (moderately) stanced cars, but let me play devils advocate...also, I'll add, that I'm talking about daily driven street cars. (Show cars and track cars are a different ballpark.)  The haircut analogy is stupid. Your haircut is not a potential safety concern.   That F1 car is not driven on the street, they also change their tires after a few laps, and they are running significantly more sidewall than any stanced car. Giving you more sidewall flex, drastically reducing the probability that the tire will debead.  If you can see the bead on the wheel, the tire is stretched too far. Ask any tire manufacturer in the world if their tires are designed to work like that and they will tell you no.  Camber...yes there are a lot of benefits to running some camber, but if you can see daylight. It's too much. Again, safety concern. If you think that you are going to have just as much traction in inclement weather than someone with the full contact patch on the ground then you're delusional. (Also, a small contact patch will INCREASE straight line speed (less friction) why do you think cars running on the salt flats run such skinny tires? ;) )  And lastly...this isn't 'art'. Yeah they do look nice, but I would hardly call buying whatever ""fad"" car 5000 other people have and doing the same mods (wide wheels, air suspenseful, fender flares) unique. I mean, how many stanced miata's have you seen lately? 5 years ago there were hardly any... Mk4 gti's? Wrx's? There's shit tons of them. Not hating, just observing the facts.   I guess the bottom line is that a lot (not all) of these cars are safety concerns to most people. If it's really something you want to do, then so be it, I'm not going to knock you for it. But if you're going to do something 'against the grain' then don't be surprised when people hate on you. I see these posts every so often of someone trying to justify it. If you're really trying to be different and unique, then why do you care so much about what other people think?"

There will always be a bajillion guys doing similar things, why? Because they hang out together and go to the same shows and are generally like minded individuals with similar tastes. Of course some of it is just trending, but nowhere as much as your comment implies."
Stance,3619gh,The_Burt,0,Fri May 15 17:39:09 2015 UTC,I would say the cars that are dangerous are largely the minority. There isn't anything dangerous about a low car. And you have to stretch a tire very far before it becomes dangerous. Further more I've been in cars with stretched tires that got flats and its no different. The only real danger is shoddy mechanical work but that's just as big a threat (if not more so) of the everyman diy'er that fucks up his brake job. Know your shit before you spout shit.
Stance,3619gh,dumbbutugly,3,Sat May 16 02:06:23 2015 UTC,I find it hard to believe that some people don't see the aesthetic in a properly done slight camber and a little bit of tire stretch.

The car comes with enough power that I'm happy with it and I don't wanna push the motor too hard in fear of the ringland issue.   It's mostly cosmetics for my car. Air lift air ride, CCW's, GT spec camber and toe arms, SPT front strut bar, Cobb short shifter, WC lateworks shift knob, Pioneer double din, 8"" sub under the seat, vinyl wrapped roof, rain guards, front lip, side skirt extensions, and rear spats... a lot of small stuff too. The car is great though, I love it."
Stance,35zdjb,Mordaine,1 point,Mon May 18 17:25:25 2015 UTC,"How do you like the Cobb short throw shifter and shift knob? And lastly, where did you get your rain guards?  Yeah, Kelly at the shop was showing me around and showed me some dyno numbers from similar setups that ill have done and it was around 350+hp and 340tq, I think that will be plenty!  The AOS is strongly suggested if you want to avoid your ringland issues. No performance notice from it but also no more oil going back into your intake system.   IAG AOS that I have installed  I really really recommend it if you would like to save your engine and get some good power out of it later on down the road."

Stance,35yh3x,The_Burt,2,Thu May 14 17:57:20 2015 UTC,"I actually have a friend who was working as a model there for the weekend. She got some insider info.  Basically what happened was FD has been pissing off their sponsors by not doing a good job of pushing them and just treating them poorly, and as a result they're at risk of losing some of their big sponsors. So apparently the judges were feeling some pressure to push through the big name sponsors as best they could in order to keep them happy.   Shitty for the judging, but honestly I don't care all that much who wins - I just wanna see sick drifting. The unfortunate result is that either FD will get dropped by sponsors or drivers will stop taking FD seriously and go elsewhere to compete."

Stance,35j3bo,michaelbrewer7,2,Mon May 11 06:01:32 2015 UTC,What are the pros and cons of bagged vs static? I know stance nation says form>function but are airbags worse for suspension performance?
Stance,35j3bo,Chipjacket,3,Mon May 11 00:25:28 2015 UTC,"Back when bags first came out they were not uo to par. Now the technology has come a long way. Some of the die hard static guys like myself build staic because there is so much extra thought pu in when you can't air up. It takes a certain skill to drive a static car. Bags are more practical and at a half inch of the ground neither car is hitting corners too hard.  Now days it's personal taste more than anything else. (Also maybe some fanboy hype), as for price a bag set up can be done for around the same as decent coilovers so it really does just come down to who builds it and what they like.  I like my trucks bagged and my cars static. That's just me though  Edit: fixing small phone issues"

Stance,35j3bo,Chipjacket,1 point,Mon May 11 02:55:44 2015 UTC,I highly disagree. I did an autocross on my airlift performance bags.

Stance,34zvem,Puravidalv,5,Wed May 6 03:29:49 2015 UTC,I actually didn't do it to be Vip. I did it because I'm unable a achieve the stance I want. But thanks! I'll think about it!
Stance,34zvem,linkkyy,2,Wed May 6 03:38:18 2015 UTC,What exactly is radiusing a fender?
Stance,34zvem,linkkyy,4,Wed May 6 07:14:13 2015 UTC,"Very common in the Japanese VIP scene, you basically recut the stock line of your fender higher up, allowing you to run bigger wheels while still laying frame. It looks really good IMO too. It's really commonly paired with a slight metal widebody when the work is done too, which is why I brought it up.  Example."

Stance,3502m4,ctheit,1 point,Wed May 6 00:46:21 2015 UTC,All depends really. Im a dealer so  I can afford to cut people slack and cheaper labour/fitting rate due to making slightly more profit on the kit. I dont need to rip people off so ROUGHLY the following :   £2200 - Mk4 Golf Setup with V2.  £400 - Fitting inc. boot build and chassis notch  £20 - Per corner to roll and pull arch  £40 - 1 Hours labour to camber rear  You get the idea anyway. Around $4100 all in.
Stance,3502m4,diphiminaids,2,Wed May 6 00:58:39 2015 UTC,"What does cambering entail? This car looks great IMO, perfect camber"
Stance,3502m4,IrPOWERranger,1 point,Wed May 6 01:22:47 2015 UTC,"Not that hard. Remove rear wheel. Remove caliper and carrier. Remove disk. Remove rear axle bolt ( The big center one). Pull off bearing CAREFULLY. Remove 4 bolts that holds the Stub axle to the full axle.. From here, Install camber shims ( Or washers depending on how you want to do it. Camber shims are recommended but washers are common.). If youre using washers, put them between the stub axle and axle on the BOTTOM bolts. Rebuild as normal. But when it comes to the caliper carrier, put washers between the holder and the hub. This angles the caliper  aswell so it lines up with the disk correctly when braking."

Stance,3502m4,harleydt,1 point,Mon May 25 20:59:44 2015 UTC,"Hard to say buddy. The front is just a Mk4/5 Golf strut. The rears are different though! It sits on leaf springs. To do it right, youre meant to do a 5-link system which replaces the leaf springs. Ive even heard guys modifying a Mk5 rear beam to fit. A company in Germany? ( i think) had developed a conversion kit for the rear which is bag friendly, but if i remember right, it was near £2000 for the axle system alone!"

Stance,34xb60,Swannyone,1 point,Tue May 5 12:45:20 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I fully understand the whole p plate thing but I assume it's when you just pass your test or something... But they have a m3??
Stance,34xb60,Swannyone,3,Tue May 5 11:00:36 2015 UTC,"P plates signify you're in different stages of your license, limiting certain things you can do.   So red P's mean that you're in your first 12-18 months of driving. Red Ps bring a bunch of restrictions, such as speed limited to 90km/h (even in 110km zones), no more than 1 passenger after 11pm and loss of licence on any speeding offence. Green P's is the next 24-30 months of your licence and gives you more demerit points and ups the speed to 100km/h.   All P plates carry a restriction on the vehicles you can drive. It used to be all V8s and anything with forced induction, but we recently had a change of rules and there's now a lot more you can drive.   That said, it often doesn't matter to some people and they drive whatever they please. So if it is a real M3, yeah they're probably just driving it anyway. If you encountered a dickish cop or a defect station they could fuck you up for that though."
Stance,34xb60,AIternate,1 point,Tue May 5 11:21:25 2015 UTC,Oh okay that's a lot smarter than what we do here... Oh you passed your test go buy what ever car you can afford

Stance,34plry,avidworks,7,Sun May 3 13:02:33 2015 UTC,Buy extended studs and spacers. Don't buy spacers and extended bolts. The studs are much safer if you really want to use spacers.
Stance,34plry,31794ty,8,Sun May 3 16:35:44 2015 UTC,15mm is safe. 20mm might work with a good roll if your springs are stiff enough.

It's just everything else that fails around it. It eats stock turbos, My s4 (this one) only has 73k miles and I'm already on my second set of turbos. Oil leaks from everywhere on the valve cover seal, turbo oil lines suck, syncros suck, tons of opportunities for boost and vacuum leaks on stock lines. Etc. The list is long. But that being said, once you upgrade everything around the block (and if you don't hate on your Transmission too much), they're a hell of a lot of fun.  Many say (and i agree) that they're more reliable at stage 3 than stock.  The only problem is getting there, because a ton of the maintenance and upgrades is motor out type work."

Stance,34gb2x,magic8ball88,2,Fri May 1 06:32:37 2015 UTC,"There are some incredibly attractive wraps. It's preferred with many people just because it's temporary and you can get much more involved with the detail than with paint.  That being said, it's exponentially more expensive.."
Stance,34gb2x,T-and-C,2,Fri May 1 11:14:49 2015 UTC,A wrap is more expensive than paint? I find that hard to believe.
Stance,34gb2x,magic8ball88,2,Fri May 1 17:56:39 2015 UTC,I suppose it depends on the wrap and where. But wraps can easily set you back $1k
Stance,34gb2x,T-and-C,3,Fri May 1 22:50:10 2015 UTC,And a paint job can easily set you back $20k. My grandpa just got his 1953 Ford painted and it set him back $4000. And it was a friend deal.

Stance,34bkfi,SweatyHandshake,5,Thu Apr 30 07:59:59 2015 UTC,"Well if you live in an area that gets snow and you don't swap out the coils for the winter. A fair amount of rust can build up on the strut body or the spring itself. To prevent this is to coat the coil in something that prevents rust (obviously something translucent). All this rust is unsightly and it can become a problem to adjust your coils if rust builds up on the strut.   Naturally dirt, grime, etc will build up on the strut body between the thread so I suggest you spray down the strut with some PB Blaster, let it sit and then use a good brush to clean the thread. Just do it every 3-5k miles or another good indiciator is whenever you change your oil.  If you live near salt water then you definitely need to be on top of your coils because you have to deal with rust all year round.  Hope this helps.  TL;DR: Take the steps necessary to prevent rest and the build up of grime and dirt on the strut thread."

I'm essence, it has a ""stance"" mode. That isn't it's normal (optimal) ride height.   And there has to be a transport mode for the suspension because I've seen them very tall before.

I parked and still had a nice backdrop of the yard and trains (and a really cool looking graffiti covered train car) I was there for no more than 5 minutes when a guy rolled up (they must've had cameras) and told me I couldn't be there because it is private property...  I responded with ""That's great and all, but I am not in/on the property""   which he responded with ""well you can't take pictures of the trains""   which I laughed at and asked ""why not?"" and he replied with ""you just can't""...and he just stood there in the way of the shots and wasn't leaving  so I was like whatever, I got some decent shots.  When I was getting back in my car he started reading my license plate number over his radio...I laughed at that too.   Then I found that overpass right up the street and took some photos there.

So I'd say it is a great car as long as you also have a more practical car for things other than daily commuting.   Idk how I'd scale it 1-10. But I will say I enjoy it more than my Mazdaspeed6...which was a 300whp beast and my favorite car I've ever owned, until the Miata came along lol despite the tremendous difference in power."

You could try using diamond racing wheels for starters and getting the parts to adjust your ride height and camber. Or you could find a cheaper cooler project car like a miata, or a 240, cressida, 510, rx7, old supra, golf, jetta, etc... and mess with one of those for a bit, and then move on to a nicer project after. Good luck."

Stance,33syv6,J0HNNYCUPCAKES,1 point,Sat Apr 25 20:17:07 2015 UTC,This one didn't have any markings. I believe it was an Undercover? The cop who got out was also in civilian clothing. He only pulled the guy over for having a taillight out though.

All sorts of stuff you end up having to worry about and check and re check and triple check. Make sure no water is in there, clean the leads and all sorts of fun stuff. Then if you are anywhere where it gets really cold, be prepared to enjoy the issues that come with that.   But this was about 4 years ago or so for me. Im sure it has changed and improved since then. I had accuair E level on my B7 A4 and that was something else to deal with too setting up...ugh air is nice, but getting it right and all set up and maintained on a daily is a nightmare."

But these days they make struts for everything and I would imagine the tech has gotten better since the launching days of E-level and Bagyards from Austria.

But your lines would get water in them and freeze up. Had to make sure your struts where all in good shape along with rear shocks. They would blow all the time on me. There is quite a bit of maintenance and money set aside for publi transport. I'm sure more than we have to keep up a fleet of our cars.

Stance,32p9uw,tiannagismywaifu,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:39:33 2015 UTC,Yeah i just confirmed that they are fittipaldi. Do you know where they sell them? I'm going to repair the wheel but i just want to make sure that repairing it won't cost more than just buying one.

Stance,324sox,LazerKitty,2,Fri Apr 10 23:30:19 2015 UTC,"As a guy who used to drive a half inch off the ground you'll need 4 things. Some 2x4 (I used the 12x because they were wider and easier to sling under the tires), something to keep them from sliding forward, a scissor jack (torin makes one with a flat top that is about 1.2-1.5"" and the lowest I could find when fully closed), a low pro floor jack.   Step 1 drive over the 2x4 (or 12s), Step 2 push scissor jack up next to the pinch welds, Step 3 lift by the fender and toe the jack under the pinch weld, Step 4 wind the car up enough for the low pro jack, Set 5 repeat as necessary.  Normally it took me about 15-17 minutes to float my G on jackstands. If you're really stanced out this will be the only option. Upside was I never had to worry about my wheels being stolen.

Stance,31zdxg,On-a-tims-run,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:18:56 2015 UTC,"I know it goes completely against the hive mind, but drifting is turning into a turn off for me. There's all these awesome cars that are so high performance turned into something a 240sx with an ls could do just fine with more than plenty of power.  An example is a srt10 turbo supra called ""vipra"" it's an insanely cool car, but it feels wasted to me for it to just slide around on a small track. Obviously it's their cars, money, and lives, but it's just so much cleaner to me for it to be a nice street car or track car, not something like that turned into a demolition derby car."

I've never been in a coupe with a back seat that I would call comfortable, and especially not one that I would EVER have as my DD with children. Hell when I was REALLY little my dad drove a 2 door Chrysler, and even that was a pain.   Nissan Altima? Cramped and awkward,   Monte Carlo? REALLY hard to get in and out of.   Plymouth Satellite? Actually not to bad, but who can DD a '67 Plymouth.   Chrysler LeBaron? Pretty much a tangle of seatbelts every time you go in and out.  1970 Coupe De Ville? Once you're in it it's great, but low roofline and large amount of legroom means crawling in and out of the back seat like a gorilla.  Mini Cooper? Cramped, at best.  '96 Camaro? Nope, and riding in it as an adult I ended up putting my feet on the passenger side seat and sitting across the back.  3rd gen camaro? Yeah another nope  Integra? It's basically a 3 seater  Eclipse? That's not a back seat, that's a place for me to throw some groceries  Porsche 911? That's not a back seat, agreed; that's a spot for me to toss my purse. When I drove one the back of the front seat was actually touching the back seat.  There's NOTHING wrong with sedans, I picked a sedan over a coupe for my current car even though I'm single and child free because I just like the convenience."

Stance,31n6c5,steadilyshinesince99,2,Mon Apr 6 16:40:17 2015 UTC,I'd love to learn more about these cars. Soarers or early sc430s correct?
Stance,31n6c5,Sandwichmixto,3,Tue Apr 7 08:14:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah soarer chassis are funny things, they're all basically coupe versions of the supra, so mine is a jzz30, based off of the ma80 (mk4 supra) chassis, the jdm soarers like z20 are based of mk3 supra,  z10 are mk2 Celica supra,  The cars incredibly stable and fun to drift but like most supra chassis you really need modified knuckles for more angle, mine were done a while ago and unless you're really being an idiot there's no spinning this thing between the 1jz and stable chassis it's a blast..   And it still has ac haha"
Stance,31n6c5,deanprkr,2,Tue Apr 7 12:51:10 2015 UTC,Any side profile shots?  Would love to see the wheel selection
