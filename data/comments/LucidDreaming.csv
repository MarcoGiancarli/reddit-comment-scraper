LucidDreaming,3e386q,cliffholly,2,Tue Jul 21 16:54:37 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice.
LucidDreaming,3e386q,WhiteMike32,3,Tue Jul 21 17:15:02 2015 UTC,"To keep going on this.  When you start to feel like your LD is leaving or you are fading or maybe think you're dreaming.  Rub your hands together and then stare at them. All the creases, crevasses, and your fingerprints.  The longer you stare x repeat, then the more vivid your LD will be and you will use this if you feel like the LD is losing vividness or quality.  It always helps to get the deeper descriptions"
LucidDreaming,3e2dgj,momscooking,7,Tue Jul 21 12:44:07 2015 UTC,"I find the techniques and chakra meditations an interesting approach and I liked the more mystical discussions of dream origins.  I thought the way that they divided the types of dreams into the basic karmic dreams, messenger dreams, and clear light dreams to be fascinating.  I respect their reverence for the power of sleep and the sheer profundity in some the discussions about the significance of the Clear Light.  Having read the Tibetan Book of the Dead, or Bardo Thodol - Good documentary, I found the significance that they placed on why sleep and dream yoga is important to be particulatly fascinating.    While there is a plethora of particularly folksy aspects to some of its practice that don't quite resonate with me (i.e., dakini visitations), I understand their use and context and would not mind incorporating some of those practices in a more secular way (like interviewing a deceased loved one in lieu of a ""spirit guide"" while lucid dreaming).  I mean, I don't necessarily believe in mystical chakra healing, but I do respect that there are large bundles of nerves transporting continuous electrical energy through your central nervous system and that you can focus and listen to what your nervous system is ""telling"" you.  I think their use of overtly religious iconography is a product of cultural identification; a finger pointing in a direction from a particular vantage point -- just as LaBerge's strong western rationalism looks at such a perplexing phenomenon in its own way.  I definitely recommend ""The Tibetan Yogas of Dream and Sleep"" to any aspiring oneironautic adept.  It provides a very unique and ancient perspective on something that, despite scientific study, eludes real, true understanding."
LucidDreaming,3e2dgj,CivilBrocedure,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:37:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with you with the religious imagery. In someways I find it distracting and hard to cut through in order to know what I should be doing because there is simply so much of it I'm unfamiliar with. It seems like what Laberge (and really what most of Western rationalism has done) was distill it into it's forms without the dependence on cultural icons.   I've tried some of the techniques it suggests, such as the 9 breathes and the laying in different positions through out the night, but in all honesty I haven't had any luck. To be fair, I have had any luck with any technique so I'm not judging it for it's validity.   I really have no idea what I'm doing so I'm up for learning about anything. It could be that I'm doing too many things."
LucidDreaming,3e2dgj,CivilBrocedure,2,Tue Jul 21 19:02:41 2015 UTC,"I think in terms of induction techniques, LaBerge hits it spot on.  He seems to have considered a lot of the Tibetan practices when formulating his techniques in the Stanford sleep lab.  However, one particular lesson I think you can take from Tibetan Dream Yoga is meditation practice before bed.  I've found that a quiet, calm, cross-legged meditation, with soft gaze on a tea candle helps tremendously.  I find that it lulls me into a good pre-sleep mental state, it gives me a mental image to focus on while falling asleep, and training your mind like that helps you appreciate the ""dreamlike qualities"" of waking life.  The only WILD I had was induced through the prescribed meditation on the ""red tigle of the throat chakra.""  I also think that looking to Tibetan Dream Yoga solely for lucidity techniques is a little off-point; lucidity in the practice is just one aspect, a hurdle to clear.  The real practice is self-knowledge and the realization of the dream of life.  I think to fully appreciate what is being taught through these practices, one needs a little bit of a working familiarity with Buddhist, particularly Vajrayana, philosophy."
LucidDreaming,3e2dgj,digdog303,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:42:47 2015 UTC,Do you have an established meditation practice? Visualizations and advanced pre-sleep practices like he's describing in the book are relatively worthless if you're not able to get to a deep and stable place with basic meditation first.
LucidDreaming,3e2dgj,Claritypleas,5,Wed Jul 22 00:59:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've work with this a bit. Don't let he imagery get in your way--imagining lights in the throat or head or navel, and the colors is enough. Many people notice that when they fall asleep focusing on different ""chakras"" the feel of the dream changes--throat (red) produces pleasant, soft dreams. Head (white) produces clear, bright dreams often occurring in high places with open vistas. Lower chakras induce stronger and sometimes darkwer energies, etc.  Although the techniques are similar to induction of LD, the follow-through in DY is different: in DY you work with lucidity in order to investigate the nature of mind and reality, Attaining lucidity is just the first step. The upshot in a nutshell is that just as you create dream-worlds, you create the one you are now inhabiting. Both are the result of neural processes. So while there are differences between dream and reality, the brain mechanisms used to create and interpret those worlds are similar. All of the judgements and decisions and  definitions and categorizations we use to interact with reality are mind-created. And those mind-created judgements, etc., are what hinder us, make us angry, fearful and such. DY shows us that vividly and invites us to go deeper into the nature of mind and its relationship to the world, and how that relationship determines our general happiness and well-being."
LucidDreaming,3e2dgj,OsakaWilson,6,Tue Jul 21 19:27:37 2015 UTC,"Stephen Laberge was familiar with this approach and personally knew some practitioners when he was developing his approach. From his description, I summarize that he took from it what appeared to be consistent with scientific understanding. So when you read Laberge you are mostly getting the best of what Tibetan dream yoga offers, but updated.   I have read the book and many others from Dzogchen and my impression is that they were effective and dedicated lucid dreamers, but mixed it in with a lot of unfounded religious stuff.   I did take something good from that book. The general attitude is very positive. I like the ""watches"", at different times during the night you approach maintaining lucidity with different mind-sets and in different positions. That made for some interesting dreams influenced by the mindsets. It both nurtures dreams of various types and positive elements of personality. Very cool."
LucidDreaming,3e2dgj,bobbaphet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:41:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that. I agree that the attitude or intention is extremely important. I haven't had any success becoming lucid, but I have noticed on the days that I think about dreaming all day I have much more vivid dreams than the days when I don't do my RC's. Like I said in the other comment, it seems like Laberge really boiled down what the important aspects where of the techniques and then did away with the cultural iconography."
LucidDreaming,3e2dgj,digdog303,2,Tue Jul 21 19:04:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's the first book that turned me on to LDing. The techniques generally give the same result. The difference is most methods here are scientific as opposed to spiritual/religious."

It was my first successful SP, but it didn't induce a LD. I think I was just a bit freaked out from the experience still, i wasn't scared the second time maybe i got too excited? I just didn't enter the dreamscape and don't know what to think about the whole experience really."

Q2: There really is no method. It's different for everyone. Some people can say I was to fly now and they are flying. Other's they say it and nothing happens so they close their eyes and imagine they're flying and then when they open it they're flying. Sometimes that doesn't work and they just need to keep trying and practicing or try a new method.

I haven't written anything down for months because I lost interest for a while, but starting tonight I'm going to give myself a month long trial-run to see if dream recall improves and like you said, see if it's worth the effort.  When I wake up at odd times during the night I'm going to record myself using the recording app on my phone and then when I fully wake up I will transfer that to my dream journal. Perhaps you should try that too and see how it goes."
LucidDreaming,3e3upj,Zombater,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:20:05 2015 UTC,Rem dreamer works technically very well.  The problem is the need to train to recognize the flashes in a dream. It didn't work for me but I believe that's it's a great  tool to wake you at the beginning of a rem session without need to move.  So fild or other wbtb technique will improve with it.

Usually if it takes longer, it's a sign that it didn't work.. which is common btw. ie I get half way but the dream doesn't form.

What you described sounds like you were very close to achieving WILD, I would recommend cutting out caffeine and doing a WBTB, but other than that, it sounds like you are in the right mindset for doing WILD. About the breathing, I can't say that I have ever heard of having trouble breathing during WILD, but you might have been congested, which is always bothersome when trying to fall asleep. If this is the case, I recommend rinsing out your sinuses with a saline solution. If not, maybe you were in a position which made it difficult to breathe, in which case just make sure you are in a comfortable position before trying WILD."

Don't overdo it though (since if you try to hard, you tend to loose the LD). -Just remind yourself that you are everything but a passive observer, but is constantly creating the world around yourself.  Something that has obvious implications if you truly manage to realize it inside the dream; like distances doesn't exist, physical laws are build on memories and any 'tricks' you have are by default work-arounds since you are always only tricking yourself."

I repeated the imagination of walking into the bar. When I entered the bar the second time, I wasn't as focused on the imagination, so it started to wander. The bartender poured a glass of water, which was something I hadn't been focusing on, so that was a definite sign that the imagination exercise had worked. I had managed to influence the hypnagogia.

LucidDreaming,3dxph8,Nefandi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:23:56 2015 UTC,I instead remembered what it was. I closed my eyes and remembered the last time it snowed   don't you have problems with closing your eyes in dreams? when I do that I always wake up once I open them again
LucidDreaming,3dxph8,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:11:44 2015 UTC,"No, that's not supposed to happen; it isn't a hard habit to break, though. You just have to remember that you can still see things (blackness/lights/etc) with your eyes closed while awake, and that you don't need vision to dream anyway."
LucidDreaming,3dxph8,TriumphantGeorge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:27:14 2015 UTC,"Hmmm interesting.   The first ever LD I remember, I could do anything just by saying what I wanted. I 'spawned' in a 4 way corridor which is when I realised I was dreaming.   I said 'teleport' and I was on a beach, I said 'fly', and so I did. But then I said 'brain', I only remember the colour purple. What I believe I tried to do is 'talk' to my brain, sort of giving it a command that the next time I will dream I will LD and that I would be aware of myself, but I woke up before that. Every now and then I LD 30% (I am able to feel everything like it is real, but cannot really control it. I do what I would do if I controlled it, but it is not the same), and just before I wake up, I try to talk to my 'brain' and giving it that same command. It happens in every LD I have...  Try giving it a go..."

LucidDreaming,3e21zr,ImNotACopStopAsking,2,Tue Jul 21 11:17:14 2015 UTC,"Only had FILD work twice for me. The very first time I tried it, and after a few months of not attempting LD at all. I think I have the same problem as you, I get too excited. When you do get it right, it just feels so natural. One second you are awake, the next you are dreaming. I didn't really feel a transition, or know that I was dreaming for sure until I did a RC. Good luck!"
LucidDreaming,3e21zr,Bassraider,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:46:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for your feedback!
LucidDreaming,3e21zr,HallowSingh,2,Tue Jul 21 19:45:39 2015 UTC,"I felt like trying FILD 1 1/2 years ago and it worked for me. What I did was wake up in the middle ofthe night, like 3am, turn off my alarm (which was my phone which was my next to me) then went back to sleep.   When performing FILD you don't want to move around or get out of bed. You simply want to wake up, close your eyes then go back to sleep. Move your fingers, pointer and index, as if you're slowly pressing down 2 piano keys that are right next to each other but DO NOT lift your finger off of your bed. Make this movement involuntary, only thing that should be moving are your fingers but don't pay them any attention.  As you drift off to sleep, maybe every 30 seconds perform a reality check. I find the transition in FILD really confusing because i'm used to simply doing a reality check in a dream. Sometime this reality check can wake you up because you move or it can work. I know one time I did a reality check and when I thought I was still awake I ended up being asleep and my dream was my bedroom. It was really freaky because I thought I was awake in my bed the entire time. When performing FILD I find it really easy to experience a false awakening. Make sure when you move your fingers you perform a reality check every 30 seconds but also don't try to stay awake. You want to fall asleep so for this my best reality check is holding my breath and trying to breath through my nose. Hope this helps  Staying calm and relaxed is very important. Don't try too hard or you will just wake up and not be able to go back to sleep"

LucidDreaming,3e3m9c,LucidityPowered,2,Tue Jul 21 18:22:35 2015 UTC,"SP will only be scary if you expect it to be, relax and disregard all the warnings about SP, its just a phase that will end and you can skip it through FILD(at least mostly). Traditional WILD though will lead to full SP."
LucidDreaming,3e3m9c,Not_A_Unique_Name,2,Tue Jul 21 19:01:04 2015 UTC,"Even still, is less scary if your expecting it. The stories you hear are usually when people are not trying to induce it. The images people see are scary because at that moment they don't know why they cannot move, so there mind, dream mind, whatever creates a reason why out of fear."
LucidDreaming,3e3m9c,nxsia,2,Tue Jul 21 19:39:56 2015 UTC,"You won't notice the sp with the fild however. You should be to tired and skip right into the dream that's the beauty of it. Wild is different. It's all about your mind set. A good trick I do to control your thoughts, if you find you are unable to think of something happy, keep the old smile trick in mind. It's impossible to be sad whole smiling. Imagine yourself with the biggest smile on your face. If you do by the of chance see some asshole figure looking at you, know it's nothing and just tell it that you fucked it's mom last night and that she still owes you 10 dollars. Own that bitch. :) little harsh and dramatic but these tricks have worked for me no problem."

Obviously there is the whole doing RC and maintining and journal and all of that. Experiment with different methods. I stuck to DILD for almost a month and got a barely vivid and medicore LDs, I tried WILD and for 3 days in a row I got extreamly vivid LDs that were pro longed. On the fith day(yesterday) I finally managed to fly(that shit is harder than it looks but its also more fun than it looks). I will try FILD today. Also a tip which you should apply to every skill you try to accomplish, look at your progression, don't be discouraged by your failures and only analyze them to prevent future failures(for example I noticed that I got too excited in my hyper vivid LDs when I attempted to move to different environments to start all the fun stuff and it made them collapse so I was more carefull about that).  Also here is another thing that you might want to know, the LD you had is nothing. I'm going to guess it didn't feel exacly like reality and it was a bit fuzzy but know that when you get to the real LDs they will be amazing and extreamly vivid, they won't be half assed version of reality, they will be reality itself. Also you will be there and live the actions you do, not a memory of yourself(that's how I feel in the rest of my dreams, that I don't make my choices and I don't live them, I merely remember them)."

Lie down on your back while your arms are above your head on your pillow,but don't touch your hands.  Drop.  If you have relaxed enough,drop your arms to your sides to release the remaining tension. Now,you are going to wait for the roll over signal to build up. Don't move a muscle.  Roll.  Once you feel the urge to move is too much,roll to your side slowly while keeping your eyes closed. Once you're on your side,DON'T MOVE."

You either realize you are dreaming once you are already in a dream, or you go from being consciously awake to consciously dreaming.  I think once a lot of people realize this it will open up more possibilites. They can take pieces and parts from every method and put something together that works for them.

LucidDreaming,3dyxbo,clouby,6,Mon Jul 20 17:42:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is really a case of your subconscious not wanting you to lucid dream, but rather you are doing too much. Also, there is a big difference between Lucid Dreaming and being able to Control Dreams. What you are doing, while you do become lucid and aware you are in a dream, is pushing past that and trying to control your dreams, which depending on the person can be easy to train or difficult.  The next time you realize you are in a dream, try to just act out the sequence in which the dream is playing for you. Just because you are aware(lucid) doesn't technically mean you have to try and control the dream and bend it in to something amazing like flying and creating storms. Start with something simple and then try to grow from there.  I know from personal experience (although studies may beg to differ, but it seems to be correct in my case) that if I try to change too much too quickly, like major scenic changes, that my dreams will tend to crumble a bit faster. So next time you become lucid, don't worry about controlling the dream, just let the dream play out  while you are aware. Then build on the controlling step by step from there.  As I said, it is completely different for each person, so you have to find your own gauge of what may be too much. Hope this helps!"

LucidDreaming,3e03eu,TheMackFather,2,Tue Jul 21 00:24:14 2015 UTC,"It's nothing you're doing wrong. The key is to have patience.  You should treat lucid dreaming like a sport. Common sense would tell you that you can't just be a pro at a sport overnight or a week. Practice makes perfect. Try out new things but be very consistent with them.  As far as something vital goes, it may not be anything at all. Everyone is different and you just have to find what works for you. Like someone else said, you've only been full-on practicing for about 5 days now so you should really be patient with yourself."
LucidDreaming,3e03eu,gigajosh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:55:22 2015 UTC,"According to LaBerge's book your dream recall should be very good before you start to try to practice induction techniques. He says you sould at least be able to recall one dream every night (in reasonable detail). I'm a beginner too (with just 5 LDs) but I think the secret is just patience and practice and starting with dream recall. Keep the dream diary, focus on that first. When your dream recall is great, you will probably already have started having lucid dreams more regularly already (according to LaBerge)"

LucidDreaming,3dwqm9,CrimsonGuardian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:40:29 2015 UTC,"Nice one!  I often hear that people get lucid early on. I did too pretty soon after I first started reading about it. I think that because your dreams often contain material that you are processing from daily life - I.e. what is concerning you the most at that moment in time - it can pop up in dreams early on.  In my first lucid dream I was walking along telling people about lucid dreaming (cos I was pretty excited about finding out about it) and I was like, ""yeah you should try stuff that you can't do in real life"" and I jumped up onto this really thin sheet of glass and it didn't break. So I was like ""shit this is IT! I'm lucid."" so I jumped back off the glass, kept walking turned a corner and was a the top of a flight of stairs and at the bottom was a wall.  I was like, ""right I'm gonna fly down the stairs and through the wall"" and I just did it. On the other side were a whole bunch of old friends and I started telling them really excitedly about lucid dreaming,.. ""omg did I tell you about lucid dreaming it's so amazing.."" and they were all so vivid. And one of them was like, ""er yeah Josh you did.."".  Amazing. But I've only had a few random LDs since then despite doing a fair amount of work on it (dream diary, RCs).. still persevering and will not stop until I can LD at will."

So your hit with the flight or fight response. You are choosing to flight. Needless to say don't flight. We want to fight. But not physically fight. Unofficial rule of dream world I have learnt is you cannot kill a nightmare. No matter how hard you try. You accept is a night mate but further more accept the nightmare is you. Note this week take practice. This is what you do. We need to change the emotional environment. You know when you're mad, or sad and they say, just smile. It's impossible to be mad if you're smiling. We want to do this. Smile in your nightmare with the realization your dream. Keep realizing your dreaming, the further you can bring your conscience mind in the better. Just because you think you know of a dream isn't enough. Keeeep brining it in. Then, face the nightmare. Embrace the nightmare. If it is something chasing you, were going to turn to it. Take it in and smile, open your arms and say ""give me a hug, I love you"" and now chase it and try to hug it. Let's play its own game. Whatever the nightmare is use a similar idea. Accept its you. And tell yourself howich you love yourself. This will change your mood, hense defeating the nightmare which is just a projection of your emotion. From there, have fun. It's all about confidence in what you can do, which is directly related to how much you beleive its a dream. There are ""layers"" of lucidity . nightmares are no different in this. Just knowing your dreaming isent enough. You need to REALIZE it and the implications of it. Test yourself but always embrace the nightmare being. Advance yourself towards it and play its own game laughing and smiling. I hope this helps"

Sometimes when you're really busy at uni/work or you're stressed out then you can completely forget about it for weeks or even months. You have to make it a lifestyle choice. As for your question I usually have at least one LD per night, usually more, but on the odd occasion I have none. It is not something you will see immediate progress with. It takes a while to get into it, but I feel that it is one of the best skills a human being could learn. And lets be honest, it isn't the biggest commitment to do regular reality checks and keep a dream journal."
LucidDreaming,3dwbas,TrogidyTrog,4,Mon Jul 20 03:03:56 2015 UTC,"Wow. Once a night is way more often than I would have expected. That's encouraging.  To your comment about making it a lifestyle choice: I definitely agree that it's one of the less time consuming habits that one can develop. I've been an on-off meditator for the last 8 years or so (had my first lucid dream about 2 weeks after I started meditating, oddly enough), with the last six months really picking back up. A lot of the mindfulness practices have been pretty helpful with remembering to do frequent reality checks."
LucidDreaming,3dwbas,TrogidyTrog,2,Mon Jul 20 04:01:06 2015 UTC,"Reality checks are a big one, it's probably the easiest way to have a LD. Probably around 50% of my LDs are from reality checks. Have a look into WILD if you haven't already. Your first WILD will amaze you, they are the most vivid of LDs but also the hardest to induce. They really feel like waking life, it's incredible. It took me around 2 weeks of trying every day to have my first WILD. It is so worth it though."

LucidDreaming,3dwbas,TrogidyTrog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:07:35 2015 UTC,"You have to make your reality checks a habbit, because you even act out your habbits in dreams. Once it is a habbit it will inevitably happen in your dream, at that point you will become lucid. You can't half arse your reality checks though, or you will half arse them in your dream and could miss that you're dreaming. When you do your reality check you must think about it, are you dreaming? My default reality check is looking at my watch, looking away, then looking back again. If I'm dreaming the time and the numbers will change/move strangely. Another is to pinch your nose and try to breath in/out through it. If you're dreaming you can breath through it while pinching your nose. After performing a reality check, think carefully about how you got to where you are now, starting from getting out of bed. Once you start to think about that, it should just click that you're dreaming."

Otherwise, I would just fall asleep. It is at this point that you should start to feel the SP. It seemed to take a long time, around 20-40 minutes, or at least that's how long it felt. Then I just got bored and decided to try and get some sleep, so I did a reality check just in case and it turns out i was already in the dream. This is how I start all of my WILDs now, After what feels like around 15 mins I attempt to float/hover out of my bed so I don't have to move and break the SP. If I'm dreaming then I will float out of bed, if it feels like it has been a long time then I just do a manual reality check and most of the time I'm already in the dream."

LucidDreaming,3du8ee,cliffholly,8,Mon Jul 20 07:07:39 2015 UTC,"Yes. I did this for a semester when I was working hard on learning solfege and training harder at playing by ear and understanding and knowing pitches without an instrument.  That semester I saw myself excel in learning things that I wanted to get better at. I had takin up a healthy sleeping routine, regularly ate and ate well, walked regularly for exercise, and explored and trained at lucid dreaming (to the point where I was lucid dreaming 5-7 times a week with the ability to alter dreams however I wanted). All these things contributed to growth I've never experienced before. It was hard af tho to maintain and after a semester I was pretty drained. This also made dreaming kind of suck after a while as it made dreaming boring, empty, tedious, and exhausting.   I'm considering to do it again as I'm taking on a huge goal and need to improve as quickly as possible. Harder now with a job and obligations that take up time from training to lucid dream regularly. If I can do it though, I will try to not over do it like I had done back then. I'll probably only try to push it 3-4 times a week."
LucidDreaming,3du8ee,whamwazz,5,Sun Jul 19 18:57:46 2015 UTC,"You're unlikely to receive any new information in a lucid dream (save for the result of pondering on things you already know, and self-reflection).   Repetition, however, is another issue. For instance, physical motor tasks trained in a lucid dream are about as effective for creating a permament skill as real training is.  So in a sense yes, you can study."
LucidDreaming,3du8ee,Ilforte,4,Sun Jul 19 20:35:38 2015 UTC,I've been wanting to do something similar; design something in a lucid dream.
LucidDreaming,3du8ee,Joat35,3,Sun Jul 19 18:49:07 2015 UTC,"During sleep you're brain kinda ""sorts and organizes"" all the information that you have obtained during the day. I don't think you could learn anything new, but definitely practice something that you already know. A foreign language would be a good example of something you could practice."
LucidDreaming,3du8ee,suoarski,3,Sun Jul 19 20:05:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, sort of.  You can't learn new information that your brain doesn't already have 'on board'.  So for example if you read half of a book, you can't read the rest of it in the dream because your brain doesn't have that information to work with.  However you can use a dream to process information you already have.  In your case, you already had all the information in your brain, and going over it in the dream helped you process and organize the information so you understand it better.    A lot of LDers have reported similar experiences.  I've heard of people using LDs to practice actions that require fine motor control, such as playing instruments, and reporting an improvement after practicing in the dream..."

LucidDreaming,3du8ee,whineyramen,2,Sun Jul 19 22:30:25 2015 UTC,"If it's already something you've studied, it can definitely be a chance to go over everything again. The same way trying to recall it while awake will help cement it in your brain a little more each time."
LucidDreaming,3du8ee,lurrz,2,Mon Jul 20 04:10:13 2015 UTC,You always study in your sleep. Your brain goes over the things you learned and encountered throughout your day. Studying with 45 minute map breaks is great because you get rest and double study the whole time.
LucidDreaming,3du8ee,mikeydrew,2,Mon Jul 20 06:08:55 2015 UTC,"They say going to sleep earlier rather than staying up all night reading the textbook is better when you're having a test or learning a new skill because during sleep,your brain processes all the information,therefore you understand it more.

I think he eventually became my dream guide, because now he can control my dreams better than I can... all I have to do is ask (though sometimes he gets annoyed and refuses)  It makes me think that if you bring someone around enough, you can eventually elevate them to dream guide status. I don't know.  I don't really have much sex anymore. I'm all about exploration and subconsciousness and all that now. It's fun to set specific goals and try to meet them.

On a serious note yeah I think I get what you mean, if you know the girl then you can insert personallity to the DC which makes it more fun. Personally I look at LD sexy as a glorified fap,its obviously much better than a normal fap but its the same principle and therefore sex is just one od the advantages for LDing rather than my goal itself."
LucidDreaming,3dv85f,elasdickband027,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:05:28 2015 UTC,I just think that LD sex is a waste of LD'ing potential. There's so much more to do. Lucid dreaming should be more about expanding your reality than making up for things you miss out on.
LucidDreaming,3dv85f,Not_A_Unique_Name,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:26:02 2015 UTC,"I completly agree but expanding your reality include expanding you experiences.

Instantly I start doing scoot pop full pop full pop full pop full over and over on the grass like it's spring floor.

The details were amazing, I took some food from the fridge to try it out and I ate chocolate, it tasted exacly like it does in reality,I could feel my teeth breaking it and the taste on my tongue. Eveb without super powers LDing is amazing and has infinite uses. Pedophilles could use it to fullfil their fantasies in a dream and not do it IRL, drug addicts could use it instead of drugs which they won't be able to use because it ruins recall, depressed people could heal themself from their depression, cripples and people who lost someone could restore what they lost, it could heal traumas, give people practice on many things, help you make the right desicison by talking to your sub-conciousness, help an artist create amazing music or a painting, the options are literally infinite, its amazing that something so incredible even exist."

LucidDreaming,3dy3xv,luiggi_oasis,3,Mon Jul 20 14:09:04 2015 UTC,"Lol it basically isn't a problem caused by Lucid Dreaming. It sounds like you have a hard time falling asleep. Simple. Here's how I sleep.  This is a guide on how to fall asleep. Very effective when you find yourself lying in bed,eyes closed but all you've been doing is staring into your closed eyelids while thinking about what happened during the day. Worry not,because now I'm going to tell you what I do every single night to fall asleep.  ""The Distractions"" 1. Make sure your bedroom is dark and comfortable. Make sure there is going to be no distractions,or as little as possible when you perform ""The Distractions"". 2. Lie down on your bed in your preferred position. Close your eyes and relax your body. 3. Breathe in and out slowly,as you calm your mind. Don't think about stressful things. Instead,distract your mind by daydreaming about the things you like. As you daydream,disconnect yourself from the outside world. Focus all of your attention on daydreaming and let it distract your mind to falling asleep. If you find yourself regaining consciousness from your daydream,don't worry. Just find something new to daydream about or continue the same daydream,and this time it will be so much easier because you're sleepy already. 4. Repeat step 3 if you still can't fall asleep. Change your sleeping position if you wish.  Good luck and say no to being Insomniac!"

Most actions came from myself.. but communication isn't different than flying, going through walls, time dialation etc. in that it takes conviction to make it happen.  It's 'only' a matter of realizing that you are constantly in control. You are constantly creating the dreamworld and everything in it, so whatever you say goes. The major issues are memory and logic. The moment you can raise the bar on either, lucidity becomes simpler and control even more so."

I mean, I can make them talk to me, but that's more like talking with myself. The best I've been able to do is a sort of ""mind control"" where I project an intent at them and then ask them a question. Like, I'll project thoughts of a specific place (like a spaceship) at them, then ask something like ""So, seen anything interesting lately?"" 9 times out of 10 they'll tell me about the place I want to be and where I can find it."

If you got enough momentum it seemed like you could keep it going for a while, but even then it was hard to change directions in mid air.  The trick that helped me was realizing it was a mental thing.  Rather than trying to run and jump into flight like I did before, now I focus on a place or thing with my mind and picture my self flying there.  Its almost as if my mind is a grappling hook and I focus on a place and use that thought process to bring me there.  As I got better at this I became more confident and used to the process and now I can basically fly superman style with little effort.

If you want to fly really fast there is a method for that too. Focus on the dream look all around you and draw energy from it, you will see a surge of energy coming to you from all directions, it will look like a vortex that goes smaller and smalle(though no weaker, just more focused) and you are in the middle of it, when it gets to the center(that's where you stand) it will launch you to the sky in amazingly high velocity and you will be able to fly."

Things just blur all the sudden and change form as well but here is what you need to do: stabillize the dream and enhance you senses(you don't really need control for that, just focus and give vocal commands) you do this to make sure it won't crash. Now the next stage is here, focus on the dream, in reality day dreaming is just day dreaming but in the dream day dreaming alters reality so imagine yourself draw energy from the dream, see it happens in your mind and it will happen in your reality as well, you can even add inspiring music to add to your moral. Day dreaming is extreamly powerful in a dream but you must remember to focus because if you lose focus or focus too much your dream will either collapse or you will become non-lucid.

It's also hard to get the volume so that it's loud enough to be heard but not so loud it wakes you up.  I'd suggest recording a fairly short sample of environmental sound (e.g. ocean waves, traffic noise, etc.), setting it to play repeatedly with a longish gap of silence in between, and using it as a reality check. --- e.g. if you can hear ocean waves, but do not appear to be anywhere near the ocean, suspect that you might be dreaming and so further checks."

LucidDreaming,3dxa3g,TerribleAtPuns,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:36:43 2015 UTC,For me the key for determining is reading. If the story on the page changes or advances as you retread a page I know it's dream life.
LucidDreaming,3dvzg5,Koyaaaa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:07:55 2015 UTC,"The reason you could have a dream right when you fell asleep is because you were still in REM (rapid eye movements) state - you usually are in the afternoon. It's very normal that your first lucid dream was empty, mine was too. I have become lucid 6 or 7 times now and none of those dreams were very long and I didn't accomplish much in any of them but I make some progress every time.. I have a question for you, did you actually succeed at making this girl appear directly in front of you? Normally, it's very hard to make someone or something appear directly in front of you - you have to, for example,  open a door and expect the person to be in the other room. I've tried to make a girl appear too in my first few LD and it never worked even with the door trick! If you were able to make her appear so easily, I think you're gonna be a very good lucid dreamer. :)   And about your last question, ""if you are just patient instead of trying to get immediately what you want out of the dream, can you control it better and materialize whatever reality you want?"" I think the answer would be ""yes"" because the more calm you are, the better it is. Too much excitement and rushing is not too good.   That's it for me, I can't really give more advices because I'm not veteran and it would take long to explain you everything I know.. But there are some Youtube channels dedicated to lucid dreaming and I recommand listening to them rather than reading!  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC82JRYhU0yRWKS9q1MXGWaw https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCohbKYGvyyvH1RgQ-sX_3_g https://www.youtube.com/user/GizEdwards/featured"
LucidDreaming,3dvzg5,brutalpicklez,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:36:48 2015 UTC,"hey thanks a lot for the reply ! First of all, I'm glad that it's a normal occurrence that the first lucid dream might appear empty.. I assumed it was just different for everyone and that maybe I was the type who has ""empty"" lucid dreams. Glad to know it can improve ! (and to know I'm not the only one who started by trying to make a girl appear :D)  I did not know about the door trick, and I'm not even sure I could have even walked to a door, because the whole time I think I felt sleep paralysis, and it made me unable to move in the dream as well. I just tried to move through thought, trying to make things appear and move only through thought.   The girl did not really materialize, it was more a wild projection, only a face (two actually) appeared, successively, which was a bit of a letdown, because when I get wet dreams that aren't ""lucid"", it's a whole body and a whole place that appear and it just seems extremly real.   I think you're right, I should calm down next time and not focus that strongly from the beginning on ""getting pleasure"", that wrecked my chances of potentially improving that void space for this time. Thanks for the tip !   Also could the way it happened to me (don't know it if was the same for you, with waves of sleep coming, sound in the ears, flashes in the head, in short consciousness that sleep was coming) be described as WILD then ? Because as far as the definition of WILD goes, that's when you maintain consciousness while the body falls asleep, which is pretty much what happened, though it was by chance rather than by trying. Also I don't see what is so scary about it except for the sleep paralysis a little bit maybe, at least for what happened to me (since it's written ""not for the squeamish""). I wonder about that.  Thanks as well for the youtube links ! I'll be sure to give it a look :) Thanks again !! (ahah I love how one of the first videos on the first channel is ""how to have awesome lucid dream sex"" :')"

LucidDreaming,3dv4wf,IAmTheNight2014,6,Sun Jul 19 19:47:25 2015 UTC,"I think that's wishful thinking. The brain operates at a set frequency depending on its level of awareness (and that determines the different brain waves: delta, theta, alpha and so on). For serious time dilation (like the sort seen in Inception), that would require the brain to operate much faster than it's made to. I do not think it is possible in any way, shape or form for a human brain, without external influence, to experience a month's worth of activities in the span of an hour.  This says the same (from wikipedia's section on dreams, source 46). Basically, time spent in a dream is 1:1 with real life time. Granted, the experiment did not say if they used lucid dreamers, so I assume not, but I highly doubt that even being lucid gives you the ability to warp your perception of time that much.  As an alternative, maybe you could try convincing yourself that you have been there for a month, without actually being there for a month. It's not the same, but it's within the realm of plausibility at least.  And besides, if there was a way for people to spend a month every night being gods in their own little worlds, we'd probably have heard of it by now. And also, given that the average length of a lucid dream is somewhere around an hour, being able to spend a month every night in a dream would mean that, if you lucid dream for your whole life and you live to a hundred, that'd mean 100 years for an hour every night, you'd experience 3144 years of life, not counting non-lucid time spent asleep.  Napkin maths:  1 month = 365.25 / 12 =30.44 days (.25 in 365.25 is leap years)  100 years x 365.25 = 36,525 days = nights = hours spent lucid dreaming  30.44 * 36525 = 1111821 days lucid  1111821 + 36525 = 1148346 perceived days existing  1148346 / 365.25 = 3144 perceived years existing, not counting time spent asleep but not dreaming/lucid."
LucidDreaming,3dv4wf,SaberToothedRock,5,Sun Jul 19 20:51:52 2015 UTC,"As a minor addendum, it's believed that when people experience dreams of entire days or years, it's a ""cinematographic trick"": montage, plus backfill. Essentially your brain happily fast forwards to a relevant timeframe and then justifies it with artificial memories to fill in logical gaps."
LucidDreaming,3dv4wf,cathalgarvey,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:18:19 2015 UTC,"True, the brain is very good at fooling itself, so artificial memories don't surprise me. I've even heard something along the lines of the brain rewriting/altering its memories every time they are accessed."
LucidDreaming,3dv4wf,SaberToothedRock,4,Sun Jul 19 21:31:23 2015 UTC,"Someone else posted about this recently, I'm gonna copy my response:  One year of experienced time simply is not possible overnight. The feeling you've had after experiencing a year of time, however, is.   On that scale, your brain can replicate the feeling of passed time, but not passing time. It tricks you, by telling you you've just experienced a year or whatever. Anyone who tells you they experienced more than eight hours of dream time in eight hours fell for it.   You fall asleep and dream for twenty minutes or whatever, and your brain is just putting on this show for you. It's like ""so now you're walking through the forest, and uh, that girl from class is there and she needs help with her bicycle. And you start to chat and like fall in love and oh wow dude you totally just spent a whole year being married and you made monthly payments on a house and finished your degree too, and got a puppy who's now almost grown up!"" And you wake up.   Technically your dream spanned a year. But you only experienced it for twenty minutes. Somebody saying ""dude I was trapped in my dream world for twenty years"" is like someone walking out of a screening of Cast Away saying ""dude I can't believe we were in that theater for four years!"""
LucidDreaming,3dv4wf,m0nday,-2,Mon Jul 20 01:54:00 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but I watched Inception so I'm pretty much an expert. What you do is have a dream inside the dream, then have another one inside that one. Something about minutes equaling hours. It's turtles all the way down.  On a serious note, I would think that, were this possible, the psychological side effects could cause a psychotic break. Imagine you spent so much time in dream reality that you forgot what real reality was. You ""wake up"" and either experience extreme depression, understanding that the last few months of your life was not real, or you reject the reality as some illusion and probably get institutionalized. It's likely much more healthy to take your lucid dreams in small doses... You don't want to OD."
LucidDreaming,3dv4wf,floggeriffic,4,Sun Jul 19 21:34:16 2015 UTC,"""Inception"" is the best example of it.. Years went by in the movie, but you only spent 2 hours watching it.

It appears that some people who like to micromanage their dreams are over-doing it at times and the subconscious mind isn't comfortable.  Dreams can have a purpose and if you're not allowing the subconscious to express itself then it will 'fight' back.  At least you aren't encountering an active adversary like the previous poster had talked about.  That guy had this evil character rip his dreams apart and wouldn't let him do anything.  Some might even argue that these characters are not even a part of your own mind and that they are trying to teach you something, but I don't know if that holds any water or not.  I guess it depends on what you believe."
LucidDreaming,3dtlxc,MarcusDrakus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:48:22 2015 UTC,"Odd. It also doesn't seem to be that rare an occurrence, that of people's dreams getting away from them. I don't lucid dream that often, about which I don't have a problem. I've never lost control, but I also don't put much time and/or effort into managing the environment. I'll go where I want and intertact with whom I want, doing whatever I please. I barely recall undesireable characters, which might be because I don't remove them; I just ignore them, where it really doesn't require any deliberate effort. My thinking is that maybe deliberate effort is resulting in some sort of backlash or feedback. I'm happy enough to give the dream a very slight nudge regarding the surroundings and circumstances (including whatever peculiarities might exist in terms of ""rules"") and act as I please with whom I like, the emphasis being on positive desire (that I want to see someone) as a opposed to negative desires (I'm not devoting much, if any, effort into wanting characters to go away or be removed). I hardly do any active editing. Just a thought.  Edit - Something further is that, regarding undesireable dream characters, there have been characters who I've fought, but I can't say that I wished that they were there. I might go as far as to say that, even though I disliked them, I kind of didn't mind that they were present just so I could beat them."

I was actually also scared to try it (although I'm not a very anxious person, so I can't compare it to your experience), but once I initiated WILD, I felt a little scared, but I remained calm and it worked.  Basically, WILD isn't a requirement for LDs (it's sort of a trade-off situation where MILD/DILD is easier and doesn't usually involve SP and WILD is harder, involving SP, but giving you full REM-cycle length LDs that are usually more vivid). I've had LDs with WILD and MILD/DILD and the difference is not worth it if you're scared of SP.   If you REALLY want to get past the fear of SP, it's going to be hard because it's a normal phenomenon of sleep that we just aren't normally aware of. If you can convince yourself that it's just your brain kind of ""preparing your sleep and readying your dreams"", then SP won't be scary. I'm not scared of SP because of this one reason : I know it's normal and my body is just doing its job.  If it reassures you, I didn't feel particularly scared or anything during WILD and SP, but I don't know how anxious of a person you are, so you know better than me in this situation. Good luck!"

LucidDreaming,3dtf4e,cliffholly,2,Sun Jul 19 08:36:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is why WILD is also tougher than other techniques. I started with MILD and DILD + regular RCs. The reason why some people like WILD is because you don't need to ""realize"", you just ""know"" you're dreaming because you just fell ""asleep"" and you transition directly into the dream. This way, you start controlling everything immediately (so you get the full-length REM cycle to LD instead of just becoming lucid halfway through a dream with MILD/DILD).  For WILD, you just gotta remember that it's normal (the body isn't supposed to be awake during the time you're falling asleep, so you're just witnessing what happens after we fall asleep normally, but that we're just not normally aware of). Once you can calm yourself down and fight it, you'll be rewarded with WILDs (but I highly suggest you start with DILD/MILD, to get the feel of LDs and also do RCs, as they're your only way of knowing if you're dreaming or not)."

He should meditate for few days until he is ready to WILD and when he is he should try it,until then he should stick to DILDs."

I did it to make someone appear and I wasted a LD like that - you're gonna wake up! One trick I've heard about, to change the environment or make someone/something appear is to spin around and convince yourself the environment will change when you stop spinning. Another good trick to make someone appear is to put your hand on your back and wait for that person to grab it. I have not tested those yet but they seem to work for some people."

As you black out, you should always force an extra lucid dream. Take a breathe right before you black out, then hold completely still for ~5 seconds (either without breathing or without consciously breathing). This will trick your body and you will get another dream instantly. Sometimes you can continue where you left off, often you will get a false awakening start (get up and walk out of your house and try again)."

LucidDreaming,3drrpi,LycanicAlex,4,Sat Jul 18 20:51:08 2015 UTC,"Lucid dreaming offers you a way to overcome nightmares.    2.1.2   Overcoming Nightmares  Unfortunately for many people, instead of providing an outlet for unlimited fantasy and delight, dreams can be dreaded episodes of limitless terror. As is discussed in the books Lucid Dreaming (LaBerge, 1985), Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming (EWLD) (LaBerge and Rheingold, 1990) and Lucid Dreaming: A Concise Guide to Awakening in Your Dreams and in Your Life (LaBerge, 2004), lucid dreaming may well be the basis of the most effective therapy for nightmares. If you know you are dreaming, it is a simple logical step to realizing that nothing in your current experience, however unpleasant, can cause you physical harm. There is no need to run from or fight with dream monsters. In fact, it is often pointless to try, because the horror pursuing you was conceived in your own mind, and as long as you continue to fear it, it can pursue you wherever you dream yourself to be. The only way to really ""escape"" is to end your fear. (For a discussion of reasons for recurrent nightmares, see ""Overcoming Nightmares"" from EWLD.) The fear you feel in a nightmare is completely real; it is the danger that is not.  Unreasonable fear can be defused by facing up to the source, or going through with the frightening activity, so that you observe that no harm comes to you. In a nightmare, this act of courage can take any form that involves facing the ""threat"" rather than avoiding it. For example, one young man dreamt of being pursued by a lion. When he had no place left to run, he realized he was dreaming and called to the lion to ""come and get him."" The challenge turned into a playful wrestling match, and the lion became a sexy woman (NightLight 1.4, 1989, p. 13). Monsters often transform into benign creatures, friends, or empty shells when courageously confronted in lucid dreams. This is an extremely empowering experience. It teaches you in a very visceral manner that you can conquer fear and thereby become stronger.   Source"

When you're being chased, you stop running.  When you know something is hiding somewhere you go confront it.    It is a very weird feeling.  Sometimes you can't talk in the dream because of fear, your legs shake, etc.  But it surely is a trip and it stops when you want it to."
LucidDreaming,3drrpi,MandiSue,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:37:44 2015 UTC,"Had one the other night. Went downstairs from a normal building, opened a door, and walked into a long hallway like something out of Silent Hill. I'm at the end of the hallway, there are probably seven or eight doors on either side and one door at the end. All very worn down and abandoned-looking. There's a general feeling of fear and tension.  The door at the end of the hallway stays shut but all the others are slamming closed and coming back open randomly, but intensely. I get the feeling that whatever is behind the door at the end is controlling the others, and that it doesn't want me to get to its door. At this point I become lucid. I remember that reflections sometimes look strange in a dream. I open one of the doors and walk inside. In the room is nothing but a dim, bare lightbulb dangling from a wire and two body-length mirrors on the wall side by side. The mirror on the left is cracked and my reflection is distorted. The mirror on the right is flawless and my reflection is perfect. Good job brain.

LucidDreaming,3dpbh9,Ch1ef_,23,Sat Jul 18 03:48:22 2015 UTC,"My lucidity always follows after I realize some sort of inconsistency. My reality check it to read something twice to see if it changes. When the text is different the second time, my lucidity starts.  This is when the dream becomes fragile. If I'm able to maintain lucidity, things usually become stressful, or negative.  I had 3 lucid dreams today and when things got stressful, I had a button that reset the dream. The first two times I pressed the button, I forgot I was dreaming and had to reality check again. The last time, everything that was bothering me immediately got better.  I'm looking forward to experimenting with this."

When I fell back asleep, the dream picked up in more or less the same spot.

I had just long enough to think to myself ""oh my god, it worked... I'm lucid dreaming! I can do whatever I want!  What should I do?"" as I was looking around survey the wreckage of all the bad guys, when I realized that one of the leaders of the bad guys hadn't been knocked down and got confused.

Take it slow! 2) not sure 3) thats how my second lucid dream happened! 4)I use the awoken app. It sends a chime during the day to remind you to RC then it does at night to signal you to RC in your dream which can help you have more DILDS 5) i use a flying aid because im still fairly new to LD. Turn around and imagine a hovercraft or a plane behind you. Then turn back and it should be there 6) Do some mindfull meditation and Utilize the variety of induction methods. I use MILD and FILD.

LucidDreaming,3dpu5e,Mozzarellaphant,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:37:38 2015 UTC,Not exactly but I've had dreams get faded....then really dark almost like bootleg movies. I think i may have had a dream where everything was square but it was a sick dream when i had food poisoning.

LucidDreaming,3dp2r0,WalterWhitesLeftNut,2,Sat Jul 18 09:59:32 2015 UTC,Well the good news is that you may be closer to being naturally good than the general population. I would look at this as a plus since similar genetics yielded a natural lucid dreamer.   Also have you ever tried mediating to increase your lucid dreaming? It has increased my dream frequency and dream recall greatly. I actually looked up lucid dreaming after I started meditating because my dreams were becoming so vivid.

LucidDreaming,3dpq5v,Only_Santiago,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:39:55 2015 UTC,Well what commonly occurs when WILDing is Hynagogia. It's like a daydream. While in SP this occurs often and is what leads to a Lucid Dream.

LucidDreaming,3dpq5v,Only_Santiago,2,Mon Jul 20 06:05:59 2015 UTC,"Day Dream a little, imagine something like a scene and usually the hypnagogia starts to form into the dream then as you see it unfold try and take a step in the dream and see if you can do a reality check."

LucidDreaming,3dncn6,newscrash,8,Fri Jul 17 17:53:04 2015 UTC,Every night we dream. You just dont remember it anymore. I would just start writing down any fragments you do remember to build up dream recall.
LucidDreaming,3dncn6,Sadghost16,7,Fri Jul 17 18:31:12 2015 UTC,Thanks I'll start a dream journal tonight :)
LucidDreaming,3dncn6,TheZbeast,5,Fri Jul 17 18:53:46 2015 UTC,"I find that as an adult my life is much busier and more stressful (not always in a bad way, just more stuff to juggle). Also adults tend to need and get much less sleep that kids. Or we choose less sleep due to our schedules.   On top of all of that we drink caffeine to wake up or drink beers occasionally in the evenings too. All of these things combined really drop my dream rates.   If you sleep like you did when you were a kid: go to sleep when you're tire and wake up when your body tells you to, you'll dream much more again. Just a product of our environment, I think."
LucidDreaming,3dncn6,TheZbeast,2,Fri Jul 17 18:22:37 2015 UTC,"Good points, do you think being online at night (looking at screens) decreases dreaming as well?"

My recall has always been pretty good, but after I started dabbling in LD and keeping a dream journal, my recall shot up tremendously. Just the simple act of having a journal (I've never actually went back and read it!) seems to be key.  I've been less successful with the LDing - I always wake up once I realize I'm in a dream - but my dreams are usually strange/interesting enough that I don't quite mind."
LucidDreaming,3dncn6,CeramicLight,2,Fri Jul 17 21:48:28 2015 UTC,After answers from this thread and starting a dream journal my recall is improving steadily. Thank you!
LucidDreaming,3dncn6,sophi,3,Sun Jul 19 20:35:14 2015 UTC,"For me, it's always about how tired I am and how long I sleep. I always get the best dreams when I'm completely exhausted and get the chance to recover with a long sleep. The more I need sleep, the better the dream is when I get it. It doesn't work when I don't get enough hours of sleep... and I wish I could tell you what happens if I'm well-rested, but that hasn't happened in a very long time. For example, I had a bit of a flu two days ago. I got home, completely crashed in bed, slept for five hours, and slept for twelve hours more that night. I'd break the character limit trying to retell it all. It was incredible.  Basically, my suggestion is to be good to yourself and sleep when you really need it. You know when it has to happen, and your brain will reward you."

LucidDreaming,3dofwx,Clark_Maxwell,11,Fri Jul 17 22:56:40 2015 UTC,"One year of experienced time simply is not possible overnight. The feeling you've had after experiencing a year of time, however, is.   On that scale, your brain can replicate the feeling of passed time, but not passing time. It tricks you, by telling you you've just experienced a year or whatever. Anyone who tells you they experienced more than eight hours of dream time in eight hours fell for it.   You fall asleep and dream for twenty minutes or whatever, and your brain is just putting on this show for you. It's like ""so now you're walking through the forest, and uh, that girl from class is there and she needs help with her bicycle. And you start to chat and like fall in love and oh wow dude you totally just spent a whole year being married and you made monthly payments on a house and finished your degree too, and got a puppy who's now almost grown up!"" And you wake up.   Technically your dream spanned a year. But you only experienced it for twenty minutes. Somebody saying ""dude I was trapped in my dream world for twenty years"" is like someone walking out of a screening of Cast Away saying ""dude I can't believe we were in that theater for four years!"""
LucidDreaming,3dofwx,m0nday,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:11:09 2015 UTC,I don't know much about lucid dreaming as i am still learning myself but that sounds like it would be cool.

But it definitely seems like an interesting idea... will try in next dream. Maybe a 2 or 3 day dream and work up to longer ones.

During SP try not to think of anything that will freak you out or you can scare yourself awake as you have been doing. Try to will yourself to float/hover out of your bed if you're not certain you're dreaming yet. If you're certain you're dreaming though, you can force yourself to move out of bed. This has a similar feeling to when you move out of SP before you're dreaming, but instead you force yourself out of SP into your LD. Once you're in your LD in your room, you can change the dream world by imagining a new place behind a door, or jumping through a television."
LucidDreaming,3do2kb,folkmama,2,Fri Jul 17 21:08:28 2015 UTC,"You have to REALLY focus on doing something interesting. One time I remember becoming lucid and thought ""What's something fun to do? Sex, drive a car, fly? Yes, FLY!"" Then for 10 seconds I was thinking about flying until...  I was in an airplane that just blew up with people and myself falling out of it. I did eventually start to fly after falling a few couple of feet though so I guess I accomplished my goal in the end.  BUT most likely you just were never 100% lucid. You probably thought ""Huh, I'm dreaming?"" and truly realized it somewhat but maybe only 90%."

If you somehow know you are dreaming, but the dream just goes on with something usual, you are more likely to have to stabilize your lucidity.  In this article, you can see the levels of lucidity.

When you see it just take in your surroundings, recall what happened a minute ago.   Another that I read is if you wear a watch, check the time. Check it a second time while asking if you're dreaming. Reading this is difficult in dreams often times and watches and clocks don't really work well.   Those are things I used to do, but haven't in a long time (haven't practiced ld in a long time either unfortunately.)"
LucidDreaming,3dmpyh,Necrowizard,3,Fri Jul 17 15:38:37 2015 UTC,"To add: If writing ""are you dreaming?"" on your wrist is not preferred (It might be strange to other people in public) - I'd suggest to make a sigil.  You could use this site for example: http://sigilscribe.me/ and either use something like ""do a reality check"" or ""I want to lucid dream"" - and draw the result on your arm.  Even if you don't believe in magick, it saves space from writing full sentences on your arm.  Also, make sure that checking your arm for the sigil (or full sentence, whatever you choose) - is part of the reality checking. Like a first step.

I never remembered, even when there were some glimpses of dreamyness. the RC I practiced during waking hours were hand-related (counting fingers, motions, etc.). But I simply don't seem to pay much attention to my hands in dreams.  But later on I found this ""breathing through plugged nose"" RC that really worked for me. For some reason, dream-me likes that one better, and I often find myself becoming lucid after the failed RC in a random dream (sometimes I don't even prepare a technique).  So you're doing some blowing through nose, but you don't remember it in your dreams. My advice is: move to another RC and keep trying."

Nobody seemed to care about me so I walked around and saw a window. It looked so different than everything else there. Then I realized that it was showing my real backyard. When I looked back, it was just my bedroom and I was awake.  Another Time I had huge spiders crawling on my ceiling. At that moment, I didn't even question, why I could see them in the dark. They instantly disappeared, when I switched on the lights.  I think I can somewhat understand why some people believe in ghosts n stuff."

LucidDreaming,3dlknt,TheMackFather,12,Fri Jul 17 06:46:26 2015 UTC,"First of all you need to do WBTB,this isn't an option.You must do it. Now after sometime  you returned to bed and layed in a comfortalbe position.Some guides will tell you to lie in a certain position but just go with something that is comfortable to you. If you like to sleep on your back like I do then tilt your head to the sides inorder to make sure that you won't need to swallow.Now focus on what you see and on your breaths.Try to perform mindfull meditation to get to SP,that's what I do.Also make sure you are highly aware all the time so you won't fall asleep and most importantly don't let the voices distract you. SP is not scary as the rumors say so don't worry."
LucidDreaming,3dlknt,Not_A_Unique_Name,2,Fri Jul 17 06:59:27 2015 UTC,"WBTB seems like a very effective way to get to SP. But I have a couple questions.  How long after I've fallen asleep should I wait to wake back up (with an alarm of course)?  How long should I stay up? It seems like whenever I do WBTB, I end up waking myself up to the point to where its slightly difficult to get comfortable again and fall asleep."
LucidDreaming,3dlknt,Not_A_Unique_Name,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:04:58 2015 UTC,"WBTB should happen somewhere between 5 to 6 hours. Set an alarm to 6 hours after you go to bed. Stay up for 20-60 mins and do mindfull meditation,its great for lucid dreaming and life in general."
LucidDreaming,3dlknt,lost-cat,4,Fri Jul 17 07:11:32 2015 UTC,"Easiest and most effective way is distrubing dreams and sleep every so often, say about every 30-60 mins of sleep. So if you were to sleep 4 hours right wake up and set a alarm, better yet mental alarm for every 30min-60min of sleep. Now for each waking up, THERE IS NO NEED TO WAIT, resume same sleeping  position, reclose eyes, go back to bed instantly, this is where it should kick in, for each time you wake up, SP should kick in.  Oh ya sleep on back, like a mummy if you can, seems to help, cause its uncomfortable.   Take for example, I sleep about 9-10 hours, a bit much for me hehe.  I sleep 4 hours, wake up, back to bed instantly, from here its either a LD/SP. If i go into SP, I can usually sit up naturally out of it, and act it out as a LD, now once the SP dream ends, another LD will began automatically, once that LD ends, then I wake up finally, then I can go back to be again for SP, so you see, its like never ending for me hehe, I do get tired of it, so plus I have to work 16 hour shifts sometimes depending. I can rack up a lot of random dreams, from long to short.  This is what I do, example . Step 2 >technique 2, while this is actually repeatable for each event of SP. But Mine is more modified, I use different imagination techique, but this gives the general idea to attempt a ""chain"" of dreams. Cause once you dream in SP, then it leads to LD. Quite fun, once you get the hang of it.  You can modify time from 30-90 min, whichever works more natural I say, I have my natural rhythm of waking up now.  Now if you want to do it just the lazy way of using SP, just follow step 2^ in example, this should just give you 1 SP chance, instead of going through my more destructive WBTB method which I use.  Once you Get SP, you can do whatever method of choice you liek or whatever, It will lead to LD anyway; I have my own so, just giving a idea if anyone finds useful in their adventures.   Be patient and have fun, don't be fearful or mad or negative during this attempt, cause your imagination will use it against you.  Meditation is good for sorting out those useless ""feelings"", to get rid of, then SP is easy to master in terms of imagination trying to screw with you. If you want you can also use those emotions and see how they work inside that SP paralyzed lucid dream. Thats enough random rambling from me, enjoy :)"
LucidDreaming,3dlknt,AReverieofEnvisage,2,Fri Jul 17 08:57:07 2015 UTC,"Are you really sure you want to induce sleep paralysis?  You might not like it at all.  If you are thinking that you might be able to project or something, it's not as easy as that.  It's sometimes terrifying, and what roams around in there is not always pleasant.    The times when this happens I found that putting my head as well as the top of my back on pillows or raised up for more support, would usually trigger this.  I also had the idea that I might be able to induce a lucid dream much quicker using this method, but to be honest I failed each time because it was unnerving feeling something was watching me.  Anyways, good luck if you decide to try it."

LucidDreaming,3dlknt,_MoreNowAgain_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:20:44 2015 UTC,"like other people have commented...do the WBTB technique, this works for me almost every time if my intent is to WILD.  Although I dont sleep 6 hours than get up and go back to bed, I usually will sleep 2 hours than ill get up and walk around in my apartment for 30 mins then go lay back down.   Also you could drink a lot of water before bed so that you will wake up even if you are extremely tired, then you can make the decision if you want to WILD or not while your pissin"

LucidDreaming,3dly4s,LonelyCrowbar,2,Fri Jul 17 09:59:21 2015 UTC,"From my understanding, sleeping walking occurs during a non rem stage, while lucid dreams occur during rem stage where sleep paralysis is active. I would state that you would not have a problem. You cannot avoid sleep paralysis during REM. Depending on your induction method however, you may or may not notice the onset of sleep paralysis. I am not a doctor. This info excluding more serious sleeping disorders however. You could consult your physician for a little more knowledge. Hope this helps, glhf"
LucidDreaming,3dly4s,nxsia,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:20:01 2015 UTC,I thought sleep walking happens to people who don't get paralyzed during REM?
LucidDreaming,3dly4s,cliffholly,2,Fri Jul 17 17:15:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think sleep walking will ""prevent"" you from lucid dreaming, or that lucid dreaming could be harmful to you in any way.  Just read about the techniques, practice your RC in waking hoursnote and prepare a good environment for visualizing. Good luck!  note: RC practice may even be beneficial for your sleep walking episodes"
