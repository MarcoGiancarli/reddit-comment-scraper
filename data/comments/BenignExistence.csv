BenignExistence,3e1tut,cobaltquill,3,Tue Jul 21 08:36:11 2015 UTC,I talked to mine too but I live with her so that makes sense.
BenignExistence,3e1tut,klongbor,2,Tue Jul 21 19:39:18 2015 UTC,i didnt. in fact i am to turn 23 in a couple months and still have never talked to my girlfriend
BenignExistence,3e1tut,smashbro1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:25:44 2015 UTC,I didn't talk to anyone today.
BenignExistence,3dytn0,LordPizzaParty,2,Mon Jul 20 17:16:58 2015 UTC,That was a close call for unnecessary automobile hygiene.
BenignExistence,3e1fvf,slippers456,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:40:16 2015 UTC,Same here. I managed to squish it with a shoe shortly after.
BenignExistence,3e1b3t,redwine_blackcoffee,2,Tue Jul 21 04:50:26 2015 UTC,Quality content.

BenignExistence,3dw54h,OpiumAnarchy,2,Mon Jul 20 00:59:32 2015 UTC,I saw a cat once
BenignExistence,3dw54h,computeBuild,2,Mon Jul 20 01:05:17 2015 UTC,what was it like?
BenignExistence,3dw54h,computeBuild,4,Mon Jul 20 01:07:28 2015 UTC,It was grey
BenignExistence,3dw54h,HLAW8S,2,Mon Jul 20 01:09:07 2015 UTC,There are two cats that live around my building. One is a laid back gray cat and the other is a black cat that doesn't have a tail.
BenignExistence,3dq2pf,whatsthehaps_boozer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:55:18 2015 UTC,I can't do a party or a 1 on 1 conversation. You're doing swell sir.
BenignExistence,3dnrtu,ProphetChuck,3,Fri Jul 17 19:45:42 2015 UTC,I bought some brats at the grocery store. I ate one the other day with my lunch.
BenignExistence,3dnrtu,reverend_green1,3,Fri Jul 17 20:07:34 2015 UTC,"Yum, what did you have with it?"
BenignExistence,3dnrtu,reverend_green1,3,Fri Jul 17 20:13:40 2015 UTC,I actually decided to have breakfast for lunch because I was feeling adventurous. I made eggs and bacon and decided to get crazy and grill up a brat as well.  I live an extreme lifestyle.
BenignExistence,3dnrtu,pockoman,2,Fri Jul 17 20:25:25 2015 UTC,"Wow, normally I can only eat one."
BenignExistence,3dnrtu,recessionbeard,2,Fri Jul 17 20:14:47 2015 UTC,"Someone has to, I suppose."
BenignExistence,3dnrtu,UnderseaGreenMonkey,2,Fri Jul 17 20:31:38 2015 UTC,you must be full
BenignExistence,3dnrtu,firebrand0135,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:27:04 2015 UTC,I kind of hate German food. Maybe I should try it one day. I eat burgers and sandwiches all the time but not actual German ones. I wouldn't call McDonald's and Subway German food. Whatever.
BenignExistence,3djp67,joedeacon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:38:14 2015 UTC,"Mmmm, couscous"
BenignExistence,3djp67,Lantry,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:17:48 2015 UTC,"My cats basically get all my food scraps, vegetables included. They love it. :D"
BenignExistence,3djp67,Alicornprime,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:44:53 2015 UTC,"Ha, these two are very picky and used to their gourmet foods. Basically I've been catsitting for 10 days. All the rules have gone. Last night I just let em do their thing they woke me up several times purring and generally being mystical night csts."
BenignExistence,3dhq4s,apparentlycan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:57:06 2015 UTC,Cute. Pic soon?
BenignExistence,3dhq4s,UnderseaGreenMonkey,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:20:17 2015 UTC,You could begin to knit yourself a cardie for next winter and perhaps a matching scarf and gloves
BenignExistence,3dh6hn,Drecake,4,Thu Jul 16 06:16:37 2015 UTC,"Oh, markdown doesn't work in the title. I'm sorry."
BenignExistence,3dh6hn,computeBuild,2,Thu Jul 16 06:16:55 2015 UTC,It's okay.
BenignExistence,3dh6hn,Blarty97,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:08:00 2015 UTC,I think you did a good thing. Maybe people will post their experiences on both. If you are lucky enough to have 2 screens you could see both at the same time.
BenignExistence,3dfpxd,kiki000,3,Wed Jul 15 22:28:18 2015 UTC,"Nice, I don't like admitting it but I have never found one"
BenignExistence,3dfpxd,wesbod,3,Wed Jul 15 22:36:50 2015 UTC,Is your dog having a poop?
BenignExistence,3dfpxd,mister_moustachio,3,Thu Jul 16 14:15:48 2015 UTC,"I wonder ... if you put it up for sale on eBay, would someone buy it? That was my first thought."
BenignExistence,3dfpxd,220hertz,3,Fri Jul 17 00:59:55 2015 UTC,"I've heard 1 in 10,000 clovers has four leaves."
BenignExistence,3dfpxd,UnderseaGreenMonkey,2,Fri Jul 17 02:57:25 2015 UTC,The rarities provide accomplishment within one's self. Good4you!
BenignExistence,3dfpxd,megapizzapocalypse,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:25:08 2015 UTC,I found one a few months ago and my roommate preserved it in epoxy for me! Maybe you can find a way to preserve yours?
BenignExistence,3dfewm,Koolaidwifebeater,2,Wed Jul 15 21:06:18 2015 UTC,"I like your username.  Mine sounds that way to me, but when I listen to a recording it sounds sort of midtone. I would prefer to have a low, bassy voice."
BenignExistence,3dfewm,Cewkie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:13:11 2015 UTC,"Roll with it, man."
BenignExistence,3dfewm,220hertz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:40:37 2015 UTC,"Well you're practically Tay Zonday, then. You should record some songs for us."
BenignExistence,3dd9v2,whatsthehaps_boozer,3,Wed Jul 15 10:53:25 2015 UTC,My girlfriend works at a Walgreens.
BenignExistence,3dd9v2,RichardNoggin101,3,Wed Jul 15 14:27:51 2015 UTC,Mine too
BenignExistence,3dd9v2,sure_bud,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:48:11 2015 UTC,That is a great deal. More than half off.
BenignExistence,3dd9v2,pantiloons,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:38:23 2015 UTC,"oh heck yeah, that's awesome"
BenignExistence,3dd9v2,slowfreq,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:57:50 2015 UTC,Is that the tins or the bottles? The bottles are bigger.
BenignExistence,3dd9v2,Blarty97,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:51:45 2015 UTC,Both my thirsty homie!
BenignExistence,3dd9v2,Blarty97,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:51:40 2015 UTC,A bargain. In the UK they are $14.82 for 6 on amazon
BenignExistence,3dcl6t,bDuke_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:27:51 2015 UTC,"That's fun! Some good advice is to work someplace for at least a year. That may be kind of difficult, since McDonalds has a high turnover rate but try to stick it out til then.  It looks good on future applications and shows you are competent enough to not get fired your first week."
BenignExistence,3dcl6t,Cewkie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:46:32 2015 UTC,I got my second job ever this summer. I don't like it though. I might quit and work at a stable instead.
BenignExistence,3dbs14,Cewkie,3,Wed Jul 15 01:17:14 2015 UTC,I'd be dieing.
BenignExistence,3dbs14,Rekusha,2,Wed Jul 15 03:59:48 2015 UTC,Update: it's either dead or sleeping. Do wasps sleep?
BenignExistence,3dbs14,Rekusha,4,Wed Jul 15 07:13:58 2015 UTC,"They don't sleep, they seethe and froth in anger."
BenignExistence,3dbs14,Rekusha,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:20:41 2015 UTC,"Wonderful. I have no idea how they keep getting in.  They just kind of sit on the window, wandering aimlessly. However this one is on the outside of the blinds, which perturbs me slightly.   Normally, I either try and open the window to free them or close the blinds. But now I can do neither."
BenignExistence,3dbs14,Rekusha,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:27:48 2015 UTC,You are the in between for these terrible creatures. The only solution is to set fire to your home that has been invaded
BenignExistence,3d4ac8,Jawthumb,5,Mon Jul 13 12:12:42 2015 UTC,happy birthday my man
BenignExistence,3d4ac8,slowfreq,2,Mon Jul 13 14:22:42 2015 UTC,Thanks internet stranger. Your reply meant just as much to me as wishes on my facebook wall.
BenignExistence,3d4ac8,pantiloons,5,Mon Jul 13 20:24:40 2015 UTC,"Happy birthday, save time to party on the weekend."

BenignExistence,3d4ac8,UnderseaGreenMonkey,2,Mon Jul 13 20:25:03 2015 UTC,Happiest of Birthdays!
BenignExistence,3d4ac8,Gogohax,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:13:29 2015 UTC,Thanks. It's been good so far. My present came in the mail but nobody is home so I can't open it. I'll be gone when they get back.
BenignExistence,3d4ac8,Gogohax,2,Mon Jul 13 20:24:05 2015 UTC,How old art thou?
BenignExistence,3d4ac8,tinycatsays,2,Mon Jul 13 23:50:42 2015 UTC,My birthday was yesterday.
