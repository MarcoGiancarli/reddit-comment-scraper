EDIT: Re-reading this, I feel like it sounds like I'm disputing that women are harassed the same as men. I am not at all surprised that women would get harassed more. My comment was more the point that I think people who feel like they are ""losers"" may try to climb the totem pole by trying to knock others down.

Some of the deleted posts, were self-deletion after having their comment downvoted. For example, one of them argued that the sample size was not big enough (without offering any reasons why it is). And you would be correct, there was a confusion with some on what status meant. A lot took it as general status, while in the study it strictly referred to their gaming skills.    The study is sound, but we should be careful when we interpret the results and not fall to the hindsight bias."

It's generally more exciting (more scoring) and there is much less theatrics involved.  As a writer from DNews put it:    Women soccer players fall down -- for both real and faked injuries -- far less often then men do. The women's game is slower, less explosive, easier to follow and more pure.    I find it much much easier to watch as a casual fan than the hectic men's matches. Additionally, many of the best players in the world play in North America whereas the best men play in Europe and it's hard to find time to watch.  tl;dr I prefer women's soccer even though I am a man.
