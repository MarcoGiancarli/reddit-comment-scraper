Your second has his arm to the left, fingers crinkled, which makes it appear that he's just reacting to the sway of the boat, trying to catch himself.

ImaginaryLeviathans,3aul1n,TommBomBadil,2,Tue Jun 23 20:23:02 2015 UTC,"According to some website he's 21'04""   or 6.5 m tall if that helps."
ImaginaryLeviathans,3aul1n,kelminak,3,Wed Jun 24 02:29:16 2015 UTC,"Can you really imagine for a second, as a pokemon trainer to catch this beast? Like really, even with some strong pokemon, they have to go into the water which is Gyarados' natural habitat, and get it weak enough for me to capture it by throwing a little ass ball at it. Let's put aside the childish parts of pokemon and act as if the pokemon aspect themselves were real, as dangerous as animals and such. So really imagine being on the end of a wooden dock, or a concrete seawall telling your little pokemon to fight this 21 foot giant, as he sifts through the ENDLESS ocean and out of sight as he's deep under. Gyarados would really be one frightening Pokemon to find randomly with no before-hand knowledge."
ImaginaryLeviathans,3aul1n,Idgafu,2,Wed Jun 24 02:52:05 2015 UTC,Imagine meeting an enraged Tyranitar. This Pokemon is capable of leveling mountains and its body is extremely strong.
ImaginaryLeviathans,3aul1n,TheLoneDovahkiin,2,Thu Jul 9 05:07:20 2015 UTC,I approve.
ImaginaryLeviathans,3aul1n,GYARADOS_LVL100,2,Wed Jun 24 05:38:43 2015 UTC,"Gyarados is my favorite pokemon, partly because he's an imaginary leviathan, and partly because he's the first Water-type I ever trained."

ImaginaryLeviathans,3aeaf7,Lol33ta,5,Fri Jun 19 12:33:59 2015 UTC,"This place. It was strange. All around us we saw things that we had never before believed we would see. To a normal onlooker it would seem dark and boring. Worthless of further exploration. But to us, there was every manner of new species lurking at the bottom of this coral reef.   Strange coral species coated the sea floor concealing most of it. There was a bright purple manta ray gliding near the surface just barely out of my reach. If I extended my hand just the smallest bit I would be able to reach it.   Not to mention that the bits of the sea floor that weren't obscured by the coral were in the strangest kind of formation that I thought possible. Never before in my career as a marine biologist had I seen such strange outcroppings. We would have to take pictures somehow. Or at least strap our geologist onto a scuba setup and have him come down here along with us.  Despite all the life around us the entire place still seemed dead somehow. Everything save for the manta ray that was passing overhead was a dark dull color. Almost as if it was trying to blend in with the sea floor.   One of the members of my crew pointed out a large crevice in the sea floor the motioned with two fingers towards it indicating that we were to begin moving towards it.  I drew the attention of those behind us by waving my arms about and passed on the message by repeating the hand signal to them. The all readily obliged and our group began swimming deeper into the reef.   Descending the crevice the scenery of the ocean floor began to change. There was less coral around and you could see the rock of the ocean floor. It was even stranger looking without the coral to cover it. It seemed as if layer upon layer of thin rock had been laid down in order to create a multitude of platforms lining the ocean floor.   Littering the sides of the crevice were what seemed like hundreds of caves. Some of them I could see into, but for the most part they were all too deep and the light provided by the sun did not reach far enough into them for me to see much.   I wondered if we had enough time to explore any of them a little before returning to the surface. With this thought in mind, my gaze moved down to the pressure gauge of the air tank. It was a little over a third filled. That meant it was time to resurface.   We'd have to explore some other time. Perhaps with our geologist in tow. I for one wanted to know how all those caves had formed so perfectly around the crevice without any sort of collapse on any of them.  I looked to the leader of my team, the one who had originally suggested that we enter the crevice, to tell him that I was going to resurface. He was staring right at me.   I briefly waved to him to make sure he knew I was talking to him. I pointed to my pressure gauge and then to the surface. He gaze didn't waver. He gave no indication that he was paying any attention to me.  Swimming over to him, I took my fingers and waved them in front of his face. No reaction. I turned to what he was looking at and suddenly realized what had him so spooked.   Floating above one of the platform outcroppings of rock there was a large mass of... something. It looked vaguely like coral, but it couldn't be. It was moving around too much. Coral didn't do that. Plus there was the whole floating without any noticeable form of propulsion thing it had going on there. It definitely wasn't coral.   I couldn't help but feel compelled to stare at it as well. The mass of... whatever that was seemed to have a mental pull to it. Once you began to look at it, you couldn't look away. I was completely mesmerized by it and I had no idea why.   I was there mentally, and I registered that what I was doing made no sense within my mind. But I couldn't bring myself to look away. It was like it was speaking to me. Whispering, in thousands of voices at once.  Thankfully I was soon snapped out of it by the movement of water around me.  ""What could have caused that?"" I wondered to myself, finally distracted from the thing at the bottom of the crevice. The tide coming in? No, we had specifically chose to go out early to prevent that. Plus we definitely didn't have enough oxygen in our tanks to keep us breathing until high tide.   Then I saw it. This massive beast moving around. Just the very motion of its body caused massive amounts of water to shift and move around it. I don't know exactly how to describe it other than to say that it was serpentine and the biggest thing that I've ever seen. I could see its head, but even by following the trail of its long body to one of the caves on the wall I couldn't see the end of its tail. The thing's body could have gone on for miles.  Again, I was petrified. This time not by some freaky sense of wonder but instead by fear. Plain and simple. I was afraid of that thing. I didn't know what it was going to do but I was sure that it could kill me at any moment if it wanted to. That scared me.  The serpent moved throughout the crevice completely ignoring me and my team. I realized that it didn't care about me, or my team. Were were nothing compared to it. That realization gave me some comfort but my body remained as it was before, frozen in fear.  The whispers that I had been hearing before got louder and louder as time went on. They only served to entice my fear to push my mind even further into oblivion than it already was.   The serpent coiled around the crevice creating more waves as it did so. It began to look at the thing in the center of the crevice. In its eyes I could see something. Or rather, not see something. While it was looking at that thing it appeared as though there was no life in it. Just a vacant body occupied by a mind who's only desire was to gaze at the thing until it died. No soul, just a body and a mind.  The longer I floated in the middle of the crevice the louder the whispers got. Eventually they became audible voices, even screams. They were all yelling at me in a language that I could not understand. I felt like a child who had not yet learned how to speak his native tongue.  I probably would have just floated there until my oxygen tank ran out had it not been for my body's natural reaction to fear. Adrenaline coursed through my veins giving me the boost that I needed to turn tail and run out of there.   I didn't look back to get my friends. I knew that if I tried to shake the hold that thing had on them I would only die along side them down there. Sometime between exiting the crevice and getting to the surface my tank ran out of oxygen. I held onto the last breath of air I had and didn't let go until I reached the surface.  Once I got to the top I began gasping for air, greedily gulping in oxygen to fuel my burning lungs. My ship soon arrived with the portion of the crew that opted not to go diving along with us and hoisted me out of the water. They wanted to know where the rest were.  Obviously I didn't tell them. I couldn't possibly tell them what had happened. So I lied and said that they hadn't been paying attention to their tanks and ran out. I tried to pull them up to the surface but couldn't carry all of them so I did the best I could and saved just myself.  I regret not trying at the very least to save them. I have to hear their voices every day echoing in my mind. Tormenting me every chance they get. They know that I regret not trying and they'll never let me forget it.  They never stop whispering in my mind's ear. It hurts to know that I could have saved them. Hurts enough to put an end to it. I wish someone could hear them to. At the very least that might make things easier. But nothing in life has every been easy.  Do you hear the voices? Do you hear their screams? Please tell me you don't..."
