The less you pay attention to it, the better it is? What is this, Twilight?   That's not what I said at all. You need to pay far more attention to it since it's much more subtle in presentation than most other titles are. It's certainly not Lain-tier, but it's probably around Texhnolyze (as I mentioned above.)    Part of it was very literal and straight forward.. then there was this miasma of bullshit that just demolished the second half.   That's because the part of it you thought was straight forward actually wasn't. I feel like it didn't do the ""descent into madness"" perfectly by any stretch, but things start getting weird from the end of the first episode.    It was poorly written. There would be no controversy if it wasn't.   Yes, controversy does work like that, but remember poorly written can only be graded subjectively. I feel like people really hated it when it first came out but the reception now is probably a lot better than it was then (especially since we've had more time to get into it.)"

I want to see more Lain-tier. A lot of Ergo Proxy fans insist that it is Lain-tier, annnd it's not. We agree on that.  As for Texhnolyze, I'm only partway through that.. and I think that has done a better job of world building and story telling so far.  Ergo Proxy strikes me like Elfin Lied does. I'm sure it seems super impressive if it's your first exposure to that sub-genre of anime.. but it definitely isn't best in class.  Ergo Proxy earned its place in my top of most disappointing anime because it has a tremendous amount of potential... and then utterly squanders it.   but remember poorly written can only be graded subjectively.   That's not entirely true. There is an established set of rules for writing and story telling. Good and bad are subjective, but doing well and doing poorly can be objectively graded against a standard. This blog post (not mine) is a little rambly, but explores the concept well."

animenocontext,3d56b8,aspyhackr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:16:01 2015 UTC,I've got the Steam version. I didn't even realize there was a patch. Gonna go get it now!

I just thought the original was just super ecchi, but no actual nudity. I guess they needed it censored to put it up on steam."
