AcademicBiblical,3dyt2u,Curipoi1,46,Mon Jul 20 17:13:08 2015 UTC,"It's not just Ehrman, it's pretty much all critical scholars. The Gospels never had titles until the 2nd Century when they were attributed by Irenaeus. This is actually a case where the internal evidence is sufficient because the authors never identify themselves internally. That, by definition, makes them anonymous. Anonymity of authorship is a statement about internal evidence. Technically, a piece of writing can be anonymous even if it's possible to know who the author was from external evidence. For example, the novel, Primary Colors, was written anonymously. Even though the writer (a journalist named Joe Klein) later identified himself publicly, the book still technically has an anonymous author. The Gospels are internally anonymous and have no external evidence to identify the authors either. All the attributions are guesses made in the late 2nd Century.  One of the other reasons scholars believe they didn't have titles is because they do not match the genre of other pseuodoepigraphs  (the authors are not posturing as anybody else, the narratives are not presented in the first person or as personal memoirs) and because, while the Gospels are all quoted by others before Irenaeus, none ever use those titles. They appeal vaguely to ""memoirs of the Apostles,"" but none of them use those titles, ""Matthew, mark, Luke and John,"" before Irenaeus.  As an aside, the Gospel of Mark may have been originally entitled, ""The Gospel of Jesus Christ,"" since that its the first line in the Gospel and first lines were often the titles."
AcademicBiblical,3dyt2u,brojangles,8,Mon Jul 20 19:28:53 2015 UTC,All the attributions are guesses made in the late 2nd Century.   Why do we think they were guesses? Why can't the external evidence attributing the authors be Irenaeus?

AcademicBiblical,3dyt2u,brojangles,4,Mon Jul 20 22:49:58 2015 UTC,Would you please expand a bit further? So why was Papias mistaken?
AcademicBiblical,3dyt2u,mmyyyy,23,Mon Jul 20 23:02:50 2015 UTC,"It's not really that Papias was mistaken, necessarily, it's that the books he describes do not fit the descriptions of the Canonical Gospels in question. Papias (as quoted by Eusebius - Papias' actual writings are lost and all we have is quotations of his work by Eusebius) say the following:   For information on these points, we can merely refer our readers to the books themselves; but now, to the extracts already made, we shall add, as being a matter of primary importance, a tradition regarding Mark who wrote the Gospel, which he [Papias] has given in the following words]: And the presbyter said this. Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a regular narrative of the Lord's sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took especial care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictitious into the statements. [This is what is related by Papias regarding Mark; but with regard to Matthew he has made the following statements]: Matthew put together the oracles [of the Lord] in the Hebrew language, and each one interpreted them as best he could. [The same person uses proofs from the First Epistle of John, and from the Epistle of Peter in like manner. And he also gives another story of a woman who was accused of many sins before the Lord, which is to be fount in the Gospel according to the Hebrews.]    Papias Fragments VI  Papias does not quote from these Gospels or give any indication that he is talking about the Canonicals. He said that these two guys wrote Gospels, and Irenaeus decided that he must have been talking this one and this one, which were anonymous up to that time, and Irenaeus then gave those anonymous books those titles. Papias did not point at Canonical Mark and say ""Mark wrote that,"" Irenaeus pointed at a Gospel with an unknown author and said, ""That must be what he was talking about. I'll call it the Gospel According to Mark.""  The major problem with those identifications, as I mentioned above, is that what Papias described does not match those Gospels. Canonical Mark does not claim to be written by anyone who knew Peter or be a memoir of Peter. Papias says that Mark wrote down everything Peter said verbatim, without putting it into any kind of order. Canonical Mark follows a chronological narrative arc and uses complex Greek literary structures (such as interlocution and chiasm) which can't happen spontaneously from natural speech. Canonical Mark contains a number of geographical and legal errors that would not be expected to come from a witness, it contains several scenes at which Peter is not present and could not have witnessed (e.g the baptism by John, the temptations in the wilderness, the prayer at Gethsemane, the trial before the Sanhedrin and the empty tomb). It is hostile to Peter and portrays him as a dunce and a coward and it ends without Peter ever knowing about the resurrection. If Peter was going to give his testimony, why would he leave out the most important part?  Matthew likewise doesn't match what Papias described. It doesn't claim to have been written by a disciple or by anyone named Matthew,  It's not a sayings Gospel, it's not written in Hebrew and most significantly, it copies almost it's entire narrative word for word from Mark. About 90% of Mark's Gospels is copy-pasted virtually verbatim into Matthew. Why would a witness copy from a non-witness?  I'm giving a shallow treatment here, and I could go deeper but those are kind of the bullet points."

Ehrman's position is that Jesus was originally believed to have been adopted as ""son of God"" after his death. He thinks Paul believed Jesus was an angel. Ehrman also says calling things ""God"" was sometimes figurative rather than literal and shows examples in the OT of people or angels being called ""God"" in a sense meant to convey an entity who speaks or acts with God's authority.   The ending of John is an appendix not written by the original author, The actual author does not claim to be an eyewitness and is definitely not a disciple."

Ehrman specifically cites speeches given to Paul and Peter in Acts as expressing a post-crucifixion adoption Christology.   I disagree since we know the writer of Luke is the writer of Acts.   And we know Acts was written after Luke.   Your theory is: The later the document, the earlier Jesus becomes the son of God.  But if Luke was writing Acts after his gospel, the theory doesn't hold anymore.   And saying that he just quotes Peter and Paul without agreeing with them wouldn't make sense because on your theory, Luke added to what Jesus (and the angel) said to make Jesus look like the son of God. So it would also make sense for him to add to whay Peter or Paul was saying to establish his view.    Matthew has Jesus born as the son of God, Luke at conception.    I don't think the authors there meant it differently.    John preexistent.    That's the only gospel that says that yes but Paul mentions that in Colossians as well which implies the tradition that Jesus was divine wasn't an invention by John.   Colossians 1:16  For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him.    How can we possibly know that John was definitely not written by a disciple?     So what you mention show why it is unlikely that a diaciple would have wrote it, but that's quite different from saying that whoever wrote it was definitely not a disciple. I'm no expert but it looks like these objections aren't particularly strong.    Too late   so?   too Greek   it was written pretty late. The disciple may have learned greek or used a scribe.    too educated, too developed in its theology   again because it was written late. By that time the theology would have been properly established.    shows dependency on the Synoptics (especially on Luke)   The disciple writing the gospel, if he finds something in Luke that he indeed remembers Jesus saying, what's wrong with including that?    has long speeches that are demonstrable (through stylistic/stylometric analysis) as the author's own composition   But that's the case with all books of the Bible. Even the OT. This isn't the quran where the author just writes what he is told. I don't expect NT authors to write what Jesus said word for word. Surely their style would end up in the document one way or another. What I care about is that he's relaying the same meaning.    makes anachronistic mistakes that a witness would not have made.   hmm I don't think I know anything about that.. Would you please elaborate?    New Testament scholars regard John to be the least historical of all the Gospels.   Because it is embellished and late. I wouldn't say they are wrong in saying that though, that's a fair enough conclusion to arrive at given the uniqueness of John.   BTW, thabks for the great discussion.

There wasn't much reason for anyone except merchants or government officials living in cities to know Greek. Most of the apostles were from Galilee and Greek wasn't spoken there.  The 1st Century historian Josephus wrote:  I have also taken a great deal of pains to obtain the learning of the Greeks, and understand the elements of the Greek language, although I have so long accustomed myself to speak our own tongue, that I cannot pronounce Greek with sufficient exactness; for our nation does not encourage those that learn the languages of many nations, and so adorn their discourses with the smoothness of their periods; because they look upon this sort of accomplishment as common, not only to all sorts of free-men, but to as many of the servants as please to learn them. But they give him the testimony of being a wise man who is fully acquainted with our laws, and is able to interpret their meaning; on which account, as there have been many who have done their endeavors with great patience to obtain this learning, there have yet hardly been so many as two or three that have succeeded therein, who were immediately well rewarded for their pains.  —Antiquities of Jews XX, XI"

There is no conceivable way he could write Greek as well as he does without knowing it quite well from a fairly young age.  He's simply adopting the self-serving humility typical of ancient historians.  There are many reasons to doubt the apostolic authorship of the Gospels; their use of Greek is not one of them.

A curious diversion occurred here where the question of whether the personified Wisdom of Proverbs should be connected with Jesus, to which koine_lingua linked to his post.   You might also find the following comment interesting or the ensuing discussion helpful, at the very least as a reminder of the skepticism applied to the traditional attributions:  BackslidingAlt:   See, when John wants to be nice in the New Testament, such as in John 1:47 he uses the word Israelite ""A true Israelite, in whom there is no guile"" ""Ἰσραηλίτης"" (is-ra-el-ITE-es) but when he is being mean he will use the word Jews such as in John 7:1 ""The Jews sought to kill him"" ""Ἰουδαῖος"" (i-you-DAI-os)   He continues by musing:   Strange that he would choose a word that means ""Praised ones"" to be critical while using a word that means ""Struggle with God"" to be complimentary.   To which our esteemed SF2K01 responds:   Because the author of the Gospel is not thinking of the names Jew or Israel in terms of the word's literal meaning, just as if I refer to a person named John, I do not think about the literal meaning of the name John coming from יוחנן, Yochanan meaning divine favor. You can often play those kinds of word games in the Hebrew text because it is more aware of those meanings, e.g. in Ruth there is a famine in Bethlehem. Bethlehem is a transliteration of בית לחם, beit lechem, which means house of bread. So there's a famine in the house of bread.   BackslidingAlt:   You don't think that a first century document written in Israel by a Semitic author who is making a distinction between titles for Hebrews is aware of the Hebrew meanings of those titles?   SF2K01:   Who said the author was first century, Semitic or knew Hebrew? Knowledge of the Hebrew language is not commonly present when it comes to the Gospels and it generally has to rely on the Septuagint when relating biblical quotations.

AcademicBiblical,3drh43,JoyBus147,10,Sat Jul 18 19:18:08 2015 UTC,"Tacitus tells us that the Roman emperor Vespasian cured the blind and lame in Alexandria. Tacitus makes it clear that he doesn't necessarily believe the story but does say that there are people still living at the time he was writing who swear they saw it happen. Suetonius tells basically the same story in the context of Vespasian's initial apprehension about becoming emperor and that his ability to heal people with his touch inspires confidence in his leadership abilities and divine favor. Cassius Dio uncritically reports the miracles and adds that the Nile flooded in anticipation of Vespasian's arrival in Egypt.   So we have three views on one miraculous story. Tacitus, who was alive (though a teenager) at the time this supposedly happened, is the most critical. Suetonius wrote about it ten or so years later and used it to craft a narrative about Vespasian without commenting on its authenticity. Dio wrote about it almost a century later and seems to accept it as being self-evidently true. By Tacitus' own account, there were people who claim they were there and that they believed the literal truth of it and that they continued spreading the story more than 30 years after the death of Vespasian and more than 20 years after the end of his dynasty (when there would be no purpose in continuing to lie about it) in the expectation that it would be seen as factual. Reading it symbolically during Vespasian's life would have been pointless and likely would have undermined his claim to being worthy of being emperor.  It would be a lot easier to say for sure if the Bible was just written by one person with one intention, which obviously isn't the case. Daniel is all about symbolism and the how the Seleucid Empire's domination of Judea mirrored the Babylonian Captivity. Any Jew reading it in the second century BC would understand that pretty clearly. It's obviously not meant to be taken as a literal record of Daniel's adventures with Nebuchadnezzar. I'm sure the overall narratives around Abraham and Moses, on the other hand, were taken literally even if the finer details weren't.  As far as Christian stories are concerned, it was probably the same thing. Some things were taken at face value and some weren't. Just based on the laws of probability, I'm sure some early Christians didn't believe in a literal resurrection of Jesus. I doubt that was the majority opinion and I doubt that was the intention of the authors of the various versions of that story. Like Vespasian's miracles, reading Jesus' resurrection as symbolic undermines him as the messiah, especially at a time not very far removed from the alleged event itself.  I have to agree that literal and symbolic readings aren't mutually exclusive. Given the fact that so many different authors and so many different sources and so many different perspectives went into creating the Bible and all the other books that didn't quite make the cut, it's impossible to say that everything is meant to be taken just one way."

The whole point is that Jesus is the unexpected messiah, not at all the kind people thought would come: humble and ultimately executed. Not a king. Not a conqueror. To accept Jesus as messiah requires a massive shift of expectations from a hero to one who is internally strong. A figurative resurrection fits this model perfectly."
AcademicBiblical,3drh43,wuxist,5,Wed Jul 22 06:03:50 2015 UTC,"As others have voiced here, I too would express caution in following Crossan down the rabbit hole on this one. In this sweeping claim, Crossan might be influenced by general 1st century trends that find themselves in the works of Philo, Putarch's On Isis and Osiris, or pseudo-Heraclitus' On the Homeric Allegories.  That said, pertaining to the resurrection, or claim thereof, and the development of the beliefs and ideas associated with Jesus' resurrection (literal/figurative), I would be more inclined to draw conclusions from the textual data and see where that takes us. So. . .  1 Cor 15:8 is the earliest reference to the tradition(s) concerning the appearances of the resurrected Christ, which seems to be part of the kerygma that Paul claims he himself received (15:3). It is interesting to compare this early tradition with those found in the gospels, all of which are vastly different from one another.   First, Paul’s order—Cephas (i.e., Peter), the 12 disciples, ‘the 500,’ Jesus’ brother James, then all (?) the apostles, and lastly Paul himself—is not attested in any of the later traditions preserved in the gospel narratives. For starters, all four gospels depict Mary Magdalene (and other women) as the first to spot what commentators have traditionally understood as the resurrected Christ (in Mk 16:1-5 the women see a young man dressed in a white rob; in Matt 28:1-4 it is an angel which descends from heaven; in Lk 24:1-4 its two men in dazzling apparel; and in Jn 20:11-13 it is two angels in white). Regardless of who this individual(s) was in this initial encounter with the empty tomb, the gospel traditions depict either Mary as the first to see the resurrected Christ (Matt 28:9; Jn 20:14-18), or Cleopas and Simon (?) on the road to Emmaus (Lk 24:13-35).   There are other differences as well: Matthew has the resurrected Christ meet the disciples in Galilee, while for Luke they happen in Jerusalem and for an extended period of time. Moreover, there are only 11 disciples in the gospel narratives who see the resurrected Christ, thus accounting for Judas’ demise. It is therefore apparent that the empty tomb tradition, the tradition of the women first seeing the resurrected Christ, and the story of Judas’ betrayal were unknown to Paul and the tradition that he claims to have received. Could these later additions be an attempt to provide more credulity to this tradition, or reinterpret an initial symbolic understanding into a literal one? I would not necessarily draw this conclusion, but it's a question worth asking.   Noteworthy also is the tradition preserved in Luke is quite adamant about displaying a resurrected Jesus in “flesh and bones” (24:39), and one who on repeated occasions eats with the disciples. Although the large majority of scholars feel that Paul too is speaking of a bodily resurrection, albeit as a raised ‘spiritual body’ (1 Cor 15:44), it is nonetheless quite different from Luke’s portrayal of a flesh and blood Christ. Paul adamantly denies such a thing (see 1 Cor 15:42-50). So we might initially concede that Luke definitely understands a literal, i.e., physical flesh and bones, resurrection. Or did Luke's readers read this text symbolically? I might argue that it looks like Luke is writing against such readers and/or understandings. But back to Paul.   In addition to these textual observations, there is the curious use of the verb ‘to see’ in its passive voice by Paul to describe all these appearances: Jesus “was seen.” How so? We know that when Paul speaks of his own experience it is in an ""apocalypse"" (a revelation) that Jesus appears to him (Gal 1:12). The event does not seem to support the idea of Paul encountering the flesh and bones resurrected Jesus (which as we have already seen is contradictory to Paul’s own views), but rather a vision of some sort. It must be in this sense then that all the sightings in 1 Cor 15:5-8 are to be understood, as a vision of some sort. This is particularly revealing in the tradition where Jesus ‘was seen’ by 500 all at once!   Is this proof enough that Paul understood the resurrection as symbolic? I would be hesitant about drawing such a conclusion, and feel that Paul understood the resurrection of Jesus as a soma pneumatikon---but quite differently from Luke's literal/physical understanding.   Second, I would argue that Paul actually gives us a symbolic/metaphorical reading of a biblical resurrection so we see what a figurative reading for Paul would be. The verb zoôpoieô (15:22): literally ‘to make” (poieô) ‘living/alive’ (zoô), and its cognates are used by Paul to express the making of life from the dead. It is God who is able to do this (Rom 4:7; 8:11), and contrarily not the Torah (Gal 3:21), according to Paul. Furthermore, it is used by Paul in Rom 4:17-19 as a adjectival participle describing God as “he who makes [the dead] alive.” In the context of Rom 4 the reference is to Abraham's metaphorical resurrection since he, and Sarah's womb, were ""already dead."" and in similar fashion it is used in Rom 8:11 in reference to the believer’s resurrection, since he/she is already dead (seen through the context of Rom 6:2-5). See also 1 Cor 15:36; 15:45.  Notable as well, there are a number of good grounds to suggest that these “certain” believers mentioned in 1 Cor 15:12 might have understood Jesus’ resurrection, and thus the Resurrection in general, as figurative or symbolic, which Paul was then arguing against. For instance, it seems as though some of the congregation account themselves already “spiritual” beings, and, puffed up on account of this. Paul's whole demonstration seems to counter this symbolic (?) view.  So the textual data clearly indicate that, at least from our writers' perspectives, Jesus' resurrection was variously understood. I don't see how any of these are symbolic or could be used to substantiate Crossan's claims about the resurrection being understood symbolically (even in pre-Christian Judaism I don't think we find an example). Even if I wanted to conclude that Paul understood the resurrection in terms of a vision---which I am inclined to do---it still seems that Paul is arguing for a literal spirit-bodied resurrection (as opposed to Luke's literal physical-body resurrection). I think if we pursued this survey of texts in chronological order into the 2nd and 3rd centuries, we would find the emergence of symbolic readings of the resurrection---perhaps in reaction to this initial literal understandings."
AcademicBiblical,3drh43,BackslidingAlt,4,Sun Jul 19 09:44:58 2015 UTC,"What's interesting for Crossan and others about Paul is that he never seems to mention the bodily portion of the resurrection. Even our resurrection he seems more interested in leaving the flesh behind than he is in being raised literally from the dead. How you interpret this, either as a result of those things being taken for granted, or as a result of Paul not really believing those things, depends on your starting position."
AcademicBiblical,3drh43,veritasserum,11,Sun Jul 19 15:49:38 2015 UTC,"Crossan is a brilliant guy but he's an intellectual flimflam artist.  The idea that none of the major themes of the texts were taken literally is just as absurd as everything should be taken literally word-for-word.  He and a lot of so-called ""progressive Christians"" (two words that should never be juxtaposed, the cognitive dissonance is giving me a headache) want to have the Christian cake but don't like the ingredients.  It is entirely clear that the Apostolic church - at least some of it - believed in a literal resurrection of Jesus.  Crossan and his fellow travelers have to apply some hefty deconstructionist goo to history to say otherwise.  I thus see him much like I do the Biblical inerrantists - they want to inflict modern ideas about textual analysis on a time and people and their writings that does a great disservice to the original material.  For recent very interesting interview with Crossan, see:  http://miltrosenberg.com/show/the-search-for-the-historical-jesus/  Like I said, I respect him, but I think his exegetics are dishonest in search of a desired end goal."
