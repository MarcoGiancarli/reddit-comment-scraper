truegaming,3dzkte,blasto_pete,173,Mon Jul 20 20:28:07 2015 UTC,I often have an internal monologue in-character of my character responding to their world in games like Fallout and Skyrim. Helps me develop a character in ways the game would never allow.
truegaming,3dzkte,bluebogle,128,Mon Jul 20 22:56:59 2015 UTC,"Skyrim became a lot more fun for me when I started actually role-playing.I made a new character, a big dumb orc barbarian who wasn't interested in alchemy or magic but would take anything shiny by force if necessary. He became a little more civilised after visting an orc stronghold and started doing the occasional quest and ventured into human towns."
truegaming,3dzkte,Bangersss,102,Tue Jul 21 09:17:45 2015 UTC,"I do this all the time when starting a new character in Skyrim. Add in Live Another Life and the Khajit speak mods and suddenly I start out as a wandering Khajit who got jumped in the woods and left for dead. No map markers, no use of the in game map outside of a tavern, and no fast travel. Da'Rava has become one of my favourite characters I've ever created, mainly because he went out of his way to not give a shit about the civil war and kept being dragged back into it because he thought that sweet rolls on tables were free for the taking. Apparently the Empire calls that theft.  Or the time where he was headed to Riften from Solitude because Riften apparently had some amazing meadery, only to end up in Falkreath for a while fruitlessly trying to open this weird black door that talked to him. Da'Rava was really curious about this door, especially about how it could talk without moving it's lips."

truegaming,3dzf4b,MayorOSeedy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:33:21 2015 UTC,"Oh, hey. That's pretty cool! Thanks for making me aware of it.  Do you think a racing game has to be a simulation in order to be suitable for competitive play?  Just looking for some more thoughts on this."
truegaming,3dzf4b,AgentUmlaut,4,Mon Jul 20 21:39:19 2015 UTC,"Not op but to answer the question you asked, personally I feel when it comes to competitive sort of stuff in a higher profile tournament setting, something closer to simulation based might be better at drawing in more interest and be the most practical.  Not trying to discredit other racing games shooting for more competitive nature and all that, but I'm just thinking how when it comes to tournament play, generally there's restrictions and other rules that ends up chopping down a bulk of the game's features. I feel with more simulation/""realistic"" racing games, there's a bit more breathing room to have some variety in things and less blatantly cheap things going on.  Again not trying to generalize but I think of a basic Mario Kart game where there's painstakingly obvious standout setups/characters that are without a doubt ""the better/best"" choices. Sure freak things happen where someone can kick ass with a lower tiered character but more times than not this isn't the case. Also with the looser nature of these games it generally comes down to a very skimpy list of fair game things. Not trying to say this inherently makes something less entertaining but personally I enjoy variety in competitive stuff like this.  In contrast I think of a game like Forza or Gran Turismo where you could easily chart out rules like restricting class, weight, horsepower, certain cars etc; still have wider variety and have things  reliant on a giant number of factors(tire pressure, gearing, etc) without things being so cut and dry and a matter of ""you must pick one of these characters or you're not gonna stand a chance"".  Personally as someone who enjoys racing games, I always loved when I'd do a race where someone in cars that people overlook and think ""suck"" kick major ass due to properly tuning their car for the track and just having an overall better grasp than others.  Looser racing games do have their place without a doubt and shouldn't be overlooked in competitive environments, but personally I've always found the more simulation based stuff more interesting due to the wide array of factors that could be considered into the whole race, it's a deeper faceted area."
truegaming,3dzf4b,mrvile,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:14:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the thoughtful answer. That makes a lot of sense, and I don't necessarily disagree. I honestly gravitate toward the anti-grav games like F-Zero and WipEout because I like the aesthetic and the twitch-reflex style of gameplay, and because I'm not all that interested in cars personally. But if the gameplay is that deep, I'll check some out. Any suggestions for a starting point?"
truegaming,3dzf4b,AnongenesOfSinope,2,Mon Jul 20 22:21:01 2015 UTC,"When it comes to racing games, that's a good question, because  sims are very different from arcade racers but both have a lot of competitive potential in different ways. Simulators are generally viewed as having a higher skill ceiling and require a deeper understanding of its real-world counterpart, but there are many arcade racers out there that have similarly steep learning curves (like Trackmania) and can be more relatable. While good sims are pretty much facsimiles of real-world driving, it can actually be a bit difficult to know what's going on to someone who doesn't share the understanding (driving fast IRL is very difficult and obtuse), while good arcade racers are designed to be easy-to-play, hard-to-master.  If you look at other games in the competitive scene, both approaches are represented. A game like Counterstrike is actually pretty easy to watch, but there's a lot of skill and strategy involved. Games like DOTA or some fighting games, on the other hand, can come across as being quite arduous but still have big competitive communities. For a competitive game to flourish, it really needs the right combination of fun, balance, skill ceiling, marketing/support, and a bit of luck. There are tons of games out there that strive to be competitive multiplayer games with good effort, but the vast majority of them just don't stick for some reason or another.  Racing games definitely have competitive potential. iRacing and Trackmania represent two ends of the spectrum on PC. I'm sure the console games (Forza/GT) have their own competitive scenes as well. Ultimately it's just that racing games tend to err on the casual side compared to other genres because that's just what most gamers like. Those that take racing games seriously, however, take them very seriously.  Come check out /r/simracing for a better look at the genre."
truegaming,3dzf4b,BanjoKazoople,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:42:03 2015 UTC,Came here to post about iracing. It's not esports like LoL is but it's competitive for sure. It's in depth and played by many real world racing professionals.
truegaming,3dzf4b,BanjoKazoople,2,Tue Jul 21 18:21:29 2015 UTC,i don't know much about competitive MK/trackmania but the issue i have with the concept of competitive racing games is that it seems like it'd be more reliant on your individual skill in a vacuum without as much emphasis on interaction with your opponents. i think these games tend to be more suited to a time trial/leadboard sort of thing on the competitive side. though if there is a tournament format for these games that actually works for them that i'm ignorant of please let me know.
truegaming,3dzf4b,Kered13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:25:45 2015 UTC,"I think items which allow you to sabotage your opponents, as well as the ability to bump one another, can lead to a greater deal of player interaction. The biggest problem seems to be that it's very easy for items like that to become too powerful, making the game swingy and arbitrary rather than just tense.  I know Mario Kart is very popular as a game that people play against each other, and if you've ever played it, I think you'll agree that both the racing skill and the items matter. The problem is, which items you get are a matter of luck and placement (with more powerful items going to those in the back in order to keep the race close) so luck can carry someone to a victory. Of course, more races can mitigate this somewhat, but limiting the number and kinds of items can have an effect there.  I know that in Formula Fusion, the ""weapons"" are going to be things that affect the opponent's visibility slightly and things that eat away at their armor (making any errors they make more harmful) but nothing like rockets or anything that just hurt the opponent directly. Presumably, this should make it so that a good player will still win but the player in back can make things harder for them.  TrackMania does have a kind of leaderboard style thing. Players literally pass through each other and it's just simultaneous time trials where if you screw up you lose. I don't enjoy this as much.  Ultimately, I think the trick will be to make player interaction possible without making the game reward bad driving or making it so that the best position is behind the other players until the last lap when you want to spring into the lead. This seems like it might present some challenges, but not insurmountable ones."
truegaming,3dzf4b,Kered13,2,Mon Jul 20 20:43:15 2015 UTC,"the main reason i never liked MK is because while there's an element of skill with all the items that are aimable like green shells and all the throwable ones, there's not really a defensive mechanic for the player in front. it's still a test of individual skill in a vacuum for the person throwing the item, there's not much you can do to prevent getting hit other than using another item to shield the hit which is a bit silly and luck based. and of course theres a bunch of stupid unfair items in MK aswell.  designing a well rounded combat racer with a healthy tournament format would be a challenge and a half. not impossible though.  BTW i'm not saying that there's anything wrong with time trial/leaderboard formats they're just competitive in a different way, so racing games with that style couldn't really occupy the same space as other esports. it's kind of a niche audience too but i could see it growing in the future. speedrunning is decently popular on twitch so there is definitely an audience for this type of competitive format."
truegaming,3dyusc,roussell131,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:24:50 2015 UTC,"i feel bad posting here, cause ""challenge"" is never something that really interests me, but if i'm playing an FPS or a fighting game or something i'll always set the difficulty to hard.  i don't think the lack of challenge in a lot of games (most indie) recently is a sign of the industry as a whole going in a new direction, i think it's a sign that technology is allowing a shit tonne more diversity into the gaming scene as a whole. the fact that you can go on steam, click ""top sellers"" and see a blissful, artsy indie game with deep themes and little challenge next to CS:GO shows that any ""fad"" or ""direction"" doesn't really matter. i think the more gaming tries new things, the more places creative people can explore. now i really dislike ""walking simulator"" games (even though i fucking despise that term), but the fact that The Stanley Parable let's plays are about as popular as let's plays of the Souls franchise shows that gaming is becoming as diverse as it ever has been; and that's really, really exciting.   i love Journey, a lot. it had different priorities to other popular games; visuals, sound direction, control responsiveness, avant garde storytelling, lore over a general ""plot"", it explored ideas i'd never seen in gaming, at least not for a long time. what i love most about Journey is that although it went against a lot of gaming conventions, i don't think it could work as any other type of medium; and that's probably the most important point in terms of your post. Journey is a game, absolutely 100%. you're never out of control of your character, you gain upgrades over time, you go through a genuine interesting experience whilst flying around new environments and coming against new challenges that would either bore an audience or fall apart completely as a book, movie, whatever. because of that, i think experiments in the form of games like Journey should be celebrated, encouraged, critiqued fairly, and never marginalised.   that said, i think Dear Esther is really shitty direction for games to go. where Journey has its own fail states (be it platforming challenges, puzzles to solve, i think even death is a possibility at one point), Dear Esther i think fails to prove its worth as a game. there are no puzzles, no interesting manipulations of a 3D space, no challenges, no fail states, no fear of death, nothing. i think if it wasn't for the possibility of the ""ghost sightings"", i wouldn't really want to call it a game (even though it undoubtedly is). Dear Esther should be a movie, and a short one at that. the reason i despise it so much, though, is because it charges money. someone created what is essentially a ""make your own movie"", got rid of any possibility for interesting game mechanics or challenging development, read a thesaurus 100% 6 times over, chipped in some bullshit imagery and actually put a price tag on it. i think that's cheap, manipulative, and my ignorance causes me to feel like until i hear from the developer otherwise, i'll always see Dear Esther as a con.   but, to end my rant, difficult games are decreasing in numbers; other game types are just increasing. there are tonnes of difficult games made constantly, be it the spree of ""survival games"", horror games, Souls games (and their derivatives); gaming is getting varied as fuck and i think it's great."
truegaming,3dyusc,EdEmKay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:04:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree, I don't think the presence of new games implies a looming death of the old. And I also agree that games like Journey are unquestionably games in that they simply could not operate in any other medium.   I half-agree on Dear Esther. I think it grossly overcharged for the experience, but mostly because of a lack of content, rather than what it represented. I think it's still a game, but one that very much challenges what we've always meant when we use that word. I think that's where its value lies. For so long games were these obstacle courses to fight our way through, but Dear Esther boils the process down to the simple act of interacting with an environment and constructing a story in a way that's largely independent of its author. Like there is a story, but how it unfolds differs from player to player depending on how they choose to navigate the game world. And the ""puzzle"", if you want to call it that (I do), is to piece together what that story is, in the particular order you received it. Like Journey, it could never work in any other medium, because the narrative would be forced into a certain order and everyone would experience it the same way. The environment would be traversed the same way every time, and a cinematographer or writer would be in charge of what was seen and what wasn't. Someone would be forced to curate the experience for us. Being in charge of when you round a corner or crest a hill is a very small but powerful tool of immersion that only games are capable of, so as long as it's preserving that capability then for me it's still a game. It's one that maybe doesn't need to be ubiquitous, but shouldn't be stricken from the industry either."
truegaming,3dyusc,Boris_Ignatievich,2,Tue Jul 21 00:05:19 2015 UTC,"I haven't played dear Esther personally, so can't comment in detail, but I know some people who loved it, and then others who hate it - but isn't that OK? Me hating RTS doesn't delegitimise other people's love for thst genre, so as far as I'm concerned the existence of people who get a lot of satisfaction from DE easily justifies it. Am I ever likely to buy it? Fuck no. But it's just another genre, whether it counts as ""game"" or ""interactive experience"",and I like that it exists for the people who want it"
truegaming,3dyusc,EdEmKay,2,Tue Jul 21 15:52:26 2015 UTC,"well yeah, of course. i'm not gonna be starting boycotts or donating to causes to stop games like Dear Esther, they had a go at something and, for me, failed horrifically. it just the way that they've slapped a full-game-price tag on what is essentially a vaguely visual audiobook. gaming is expensive, but i've always felt a game should charge based on how much content there is in it. the fact that i can pick up the Orange Box now for about the same price as Dear Esther baffles me.   it's not its existence that offends me, it's the amount of money they charge for it, or the fact they charge anything for it at all."
truegaming,3dyusc,Alex__V,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:12:39 2015 UTC,I adore Journey and Dear Esther - to my mind they are incredibly similar experiences. It's odd to me that they could so polarise reactions like this.

I did play the unfinished swan, and I liked it. I tend to like games that don't have an overall challenge but rather have a single element and the game is built around simplicity.   For example, I'd rather have an anime that's straight forward, and artistic in the writing, than an anime thats way too complicated because it takes so many artistic choices. It's like Cowboy Bebop vs Evangelion. Bebop is enjoyable and simple, Evangelion is complicated and an acquired taste."
truegaming,3dyusc,OccupyGravelpit,-1,Mon Jul 20 17:55:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't put Journey and Flower in the same category as Gone Home, which is going to muddy this discussion quite a bit.  Flower isn't even a particularly easy game. It has some explicit score chase elements and (to me) is a direct descendant of arcade games, the bastion of 'challenge'. People forget that arcade games, like pinball, were also pretty mysterious and light on explanations.   So it seems like you're confusing genre with tone here."
truegaming,3dwn2p,zigludo,13,Mon Jul 20 03:42:12 2015 UTC,"I think you answered your own question. Yakuza makes money while Shenmue didn't.  The Yakuza games don't sell as well as Shenmue did but Shenmue's budget was huge. Apparently to recoupe its costs more copies of Shenmue had to be sold than the number of Dreamcasts. Meanwhile Yakuza just chugs along making money.  Overall Shenmue just didn't make Sega enough money to continue to gamble on it. As for why they don't do a HD release it is probably because if a 10 year old game didn't make much money in the first place why try it again. It could also be like Silent Hill's HD collection where they don't have the proper code or documentation anymore.  They did try to make a Shenmue MMO that went  no where and did release a phone game that never left Japan and was eventually discontinued, so it's not like Sega completely forgot about Shenmue."
truegaming,3dwn2p,Marsiglio,3,Mon Jul 20 05:39:16 2015 UTC,"Now I'm not terribly familiar with Shenmue as a series, but it seems to me like one of the potential major reasons it may not have sold well is because, at least for the first one, it was only ever released on the Dreamcast, which had a measly 10 million units sold over the system's lifetime.  Even Shenmue II still had a pretty limited release, the only other platform it was ever available for was the Xbox.  I can't help but think that if the games had had a release on a more popular console (like the PS2, or an HD re-release on the PS3/360) then they may have reached a wider audience."

Could be true but the market has changed since then so who knows. Not to mention they were already losing money from the poor performance of the Saturn and Dreamcast. Shenmue fanbase is pretty rabid so they probably would have bought a rerelease if it meant a chance at 3 but that ship may have sailed now. Makes me wonder how well 3 will actually sell when it's such a plot heavy game and the first 2 aren't exactly easy to come by. The MMO sounds like a terrible idea from the start so i have no idea what they were thinking there.
truegaming,3dwn2p,Gargenville,2,Mon Jul 20 08:10:09 2015 UTC,Sega are incredibly demanding of any outside studio porting their games. The good news is that means no Silent Hill 2 HD shenanigans but the bad news is their ports need an actual budget and take years.   Here's a lovely interview with Sumo Digital staff about the process of porting Outrun 2 (which happens to be a Yu Suzuki/AM2 game just like Shenmue). Highlights include Sega shipping a man off to the UK to live in the Sumo offices and bug reports about flower beds misaligned by a single pixel.
truegaming,3dwn2p,rokama,2,Mon Jul 20 12:55:53 2015 UTC,"Actually, according to rumors (offline, archive here, or via IGN), HD ports of Shenmue have been finished in 2011 already. Some guess they weren't released due to lacking commercial interest, while others say there was a legal knot that Sega didn't want to bother untangling:   Why SEGA didn't make a Shenmue HD Collection for PS360 again? Afaik, it's mostly due to legal/copyright reasons. back in '12 you may remember that Sega went into a port spree. JSR, Nights...they thought it was a great idea, with very low risk and nice proft potential since, well, they don't want to fund traditional AAA anymore. Multiple ports were in development, among them was the canceled Skies of Arcadia port. Shenmue case was special since not many people know this, but apparently the engine for both games uses licensed technology. It's not Bink Video or Sofdec codecs, apparently it's related to the very own engine. Well, the thing is, according to what I've been told, the owner of those technologies folded years ago, and it's not clear who owns the copyright now. Someone shown Sega a working Shenmue prototype for Xbox 360...but after disappointing sales by JSR and Nights, they didn't care enough to bother with the legal hassle. So it never went through the prototype stage, and the Skies of Arcadia port was canceled.   Something similar might actually be preventing the remake of Sonic 3 & Knuckles (great and acclaimed remakes of Sonic CD, 1, and 2 have been released on mobile platforms the past few years). The issue there is probably the licensing of the music - everyone has heard of Michael Jackson's supposed involvement in the soundtrack (still no proof that he himself directly contributed anything, but his producers, e.g. Brad Buxer and Cirocco Jones, definitely did)."

truegaming,3dva4y,arbaard,5,Tue Jul 21 00:11:35 2015 UTC,"I believe some terms which will help you are ""changes in scale"" and ""changes in kind.""  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlBR1z-ue-I  TL;DW:  Change in scale: a change in a variable. More health, a higher jump, more enemies.  Change in kind:  a change in tone. God mode, player can fly, no enemies.     I assume you're after changes in kind. That video asserts that these are good things for a number of reasons. Changes in kind are a tool in a designers toolbox, but their inclusion, of course, doesn't automatically make a good game.   Assuming all those phases in the game can be held with a consistent story and flavor, how would you react playing such a game ?   I think this is a gimmick. That's not to say that such an idea isn't a good one on face value, but the concept alone needs to be in service of something greater. It would be better to think about the way these changes are supposed to make the player feel something different.   For instance: invert the control progression of the game. At first, you are a basic cube, with immediate, arcade-style controls, like Mario. From there, your cube discovers a body, and jumps on its head to take control of it. The body is tall and its limbs are physically-simulated. The player progresses from being tiny and nimble to lumbering and sluggish.  So what do you want to make the player feel, and how can you go about doing that? That's the essence of game design."
truegaming,3dva4y,Gloamite,2,Mon Jul 20 00:03:05 2015 UTC,"Depends on how well it's done and why it's being done. As a gimmick on its own I wouldn't be into it. If a game told me it's a platformer/driving/action-adventure/turn based RPG all in one I'd just assume they did all of them shittily.    Often people buy a game for a particular style of gameplay, and anything outside of that can feel like a nuisance if it's mandatory. That ""Ugh a forced mini-game"" or ""ugh a forced stealth mission"". I found Far Cry 3(and probably 4) to be a recent example of this getting in the way of my enjoyment of the game. The story mission content could be in pretty stark contrast to what made the open world fun at times. And the tower climbing got stale really fast as well.  OTOH there are some games with very different styles of gameplay for doing different things, though usually it's not a linear thing. An example is any game with an ""overmap"", like a total war game where the battles are very separate from the tactical turn based stuff in between them. In that case it's usually done with the aim of creating efficient/interesting ways of allowing the player to manage different actions that are better off abstracted/simplified in some manner."
truegaming,3dva4y,Pete_Venkman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:48:49 2015 UTC,"Well I was not thinking of a gimmick, more something like a story/flavor explanation. Anything meta is probably exploitable, throwing examples : the character realizes he's in a game and he has to break into the 3rd dimension, the story is about the game developer... I want my question to be answered without taking that into consideration too much, but knowing that it would contribute to vindicate those gameplay changes."
truegaming,3dva4y,Nambot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:15:17 2015 UTC,"There's a flash game series called Upgrade Complete which kiiiiind of reminds me of what you're talking about. It was a pisstake of the grinding for upgrades/DLC craze that really kicked off in the late 2000s. In that game you don't just need to upgrade your ship, but the game mechanics, the graphics, even the menus and save systems. So you start out with a wonky pixel game and end up with a high graphic (for a 2009 flash game) shooter.  But the actual mechanics of the gameplay don't change I guess. For that I immediately think of Hand of Fate, which bounces back and forth between a card game and a brawler. And that works for the most part.  Also South Park: The Stick of Truth did it when you got to Canada, but there the jarring difference in gameplay was part of the joke.   I'm sure there's a game in the back of my brain that fits your description. I seem to remember playing something where I was surprised and disappointed that there were styles of gameplay that only appeared once and never turned up again. And I was disappointed because the alternative gameplay was really good. But I can't remember it for the life of me, might just be some weird Deja Vu.  One concern is whether a developer should focus on doing one thing well vs maybe 4-5 things poorly. I mean look at Arkham Knight, they ""just"" had to make a 3rd person brawler with some driving elements and even then the PC port went screwy. Ditto Assassin's Creed:Unity. Those games just had to get one or two gameplay ""sets"" right but still struggled in different ways. Vehicle mechanics in FPS shooters are often sketchy, Bioshock sticks with super basic minigames for its lockpicking and hacking puzzles. Making a game is really really hard and there's only so much resource to go around. So to have a game jump through 5 different game types, and have every one of those be polished and enjoyable? Yikes.  Having said all that - yeah it would be interesting to play if it works. Just needs a reason for being."
truegaming,3dva4y,andres9231,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:14:14 2015 UTC,"The problem is this: What do the people who only wanted the 2D platformer do?   Very few people want the complete swap of genre to be so pervasive. If people bought the 2D block platformer, they were hoping the majority of the game would be the 2D block platformer. People who want the 3D melee game might not want to play through the entirity of the 2D block platformer to get what they want, while those who wanted the 2D block platformer may feel annoyed to have to play a different genre to finish the game.  It's generally implicitly agreed that most games don't change their genre, save for the odd mini-game, and when a game does include those it brings them up early to allow the player to be aware of the fact that these things are included. That's not to say it never happen, because it has happened. A lot. Spore tried to do it, being different games at each stage of evolution, starting as a 2D survival game, and ending as a space exploration game. Crash Bandicoot Warped had the mandatory jet ski, airplane, and motorbike levels, while Sonic Adventure forced the player to go fishing for the ending.   Then there are games that like to include the mini-games to break up the repetitiveness. Spyro Year of the Dragon included hundreds of mini-games ranging from using existing controls to complete an out of genre objective, such as tower defense, or sneaking up on someone, or play cat hockey, to changing the controls altogether to go skateboarding, be an FPS, or do some yeti boxing. Ratchet & Clank includes gameplay specifically as Clank who plays very differently to Ratchet, being more puzzle focused, as well space combat sections, and so many games have hacking/door picking mini-games just to break up the combat.   The thing is, if you intend to do it, you need to be upfront about it, and accept that some people are going to be turned off by the idea of a genre change. What makes most of the above games work with there genre changes is that the initial challenges that are out of genre are either not hard enough to be sticking points that prevent the player moving forwards and getting back to the content they came for, but also that for many they can be tackled at there own pace. Sure, for full completion of the games story, you have to do them, but you're never forced into a position where it's your only choice. You can choose to go fishing now, or you can come back to it later. You can choose to do the yeti boxing now, or you can leave it until you're going for the full 100%. You can do the race now, or you can do it after another platforming level.  But the big hurdle is that this requires each section of gameplay to be fun and competent. Putting a lot of gameplay styles in requires a lot more work. Different tools need to be created to make and test it, and the design philosophies for different types of game are different. Many games that decide to swap genres handle it poorly. Everyone has played a game that has included an awkward stealth section, or poorly done driving level, or an annoying escort mission, and everyone has resented these moments for ruining their fun by taking them away from the main reason they bought the game. This is always a bi-product of a developer not really knowing what they're doing and trying to fit in these sections without the amount of work or time needed to actually make them any good."
truegaming,3dva4y,WiseOctopus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:16:29 2015 UTC,What do the people who only wanted the 2D platformer do?   Buy a 2D platformer game? Seems like you wouldn't advertise this theoretical game as a platformer and then release something that constantly changes and evolves - you'd market it as a game that constantly changes and evolves.
truegaming,3dva4y,Abdul-Rahollotasuga,0,Mon Jul 20 16:54:22 2015 UTC,"What about the people who buy it for both, and then realise they don't actually like the 3D gameplay? They're just going to give up. That's basically the reason you don't see games like this often. If you have one gameplay style throughout the entire game, then you just have to focus on making that good. If you've got two gameplay styles, then you have less time to spend on each of them, and you still have to make both of them equally fun."
truegaming,3dttph,jtc11492,52,Sun Jul 19 11:59:58 2015 UTC,"Big fan of Dark Souls and Vaati's videos. The interesting thing is, as you said, everything Vaati does is interpretation. Very little of the lore, even things universally accepted among the fan base, is confirmed or definite. In a way, playing through and experiencing the story of Dark Souls is like being an archaeologist. This world you're traversing is a defunct civilization well past its prime, and everything you know comes from the items you find, the areas you travel through, and cryptic stories told by NPCs. It's pretty unique and not for everyone, but I think the gameplay really compliments the lore in a way.   Another great Dark Souls youtuber that does a lot of lore is EpicNameBro. And as far as the NPC costly in Vaati's vids, most of the NPC, boss and enemy armor and weapons can be found in game one way or another"
truegaming,3dttph,UberDoogee1,18,Sun Jul 19 12:59:03 2015 UTC,"In a way, playing through and experiencing the story of Dark Souls is like being an archaeologist.    This is the best way I've seen it described so far.  It's a bit of...an acquired taste, because sometimes you want to experience everything this world would have to offer. But it's really interesting. Lore-wise, I think someone like Artorias would've lost some of his weight in the story had too much been revealed about him."
truegaming,3dttph,femio,4,Sun Jul 19 15:34:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the mystique is definitely a huge draw for me. And I don't think I know a single Souls fan that was into it from the get go. All my friends who play needed to push themselves past a certain point. I was the same way, but once you've got the hang of it and a taste for the gameplay and presentation, it really changes the way you look at games.   I often wonder about what would happen if Dark Souls were around before the internet got huge, because so much of the lore and information about the game is fan-created online. It'd be interesting if it had the same effect through word of mouth."
truegaming,3dttph,UberDoogee1,18,Sun Jul 19 21:26:15 2015 UTC,"As a normal player, I could not care less about it. In fact, the main aspect of Souls storytelling that I like is that I can completely ignore it. I don't care about story in games, especially if it stands between me an the action. Dark Souls does not do that. A short cuts-scene at the beginning of the game, a few NPC dialogues that can be completely skipped or ignored, and that's virtually all the engagement required of the player. It's wonderful, reminds me of older games, where the story was merely an excuse to have action.   However, and this is a big however, I did not experience the games like that. I came to Dark Souls late, and had absolutely no knowledge of the game. For various reasons, I decided it might be interesting to attempt a written let's play of the game, and a completely blind experience with it. My intention had been to focus on mechanics, since even I, as someone who paid no attention to the game, knew of its notorious difficulty. But it wasn't long before I ran out of mechanics and gameplay to write about, since I'd figured most of it out.  Which is when I had to start dipping into story and lore, and for my sins I ended up with nearly 200,000 words, and it will likely be even more for Dark Souls 2.  Thing is, if I were actually to critique the plot, and even the method its delivered in, I think that many lose the intent, which is partially the fault of the players, and partially the fault of the developers.  Dark Souls is a game of themes and ideas, of atmosphere and intent, not plot, or even characters. Obfuscating the details helps to bring themes to the forefront, but people dig and dig anyway, trying to find explicit points they can latch onto, and then ending with slight disappointment when they find the holes. The holes don't matter, because the story doesn't really matter, either, but--simply because they're so mysterious--many players seem to put far too much attention and importance toward those details, and end up missing the point. It's like trying to unravel a magic trick; the audience is often disappointed when they find out how it's actually done.  For my part, when I did insert my own bits of fiction into my writing, I tried to keep away from specifics. At first because I had no idea what I might be getting wrong (since I was playing blind, and had no access to compiled resources), but later because that seemed more fitting. The few times where I did speculate, it was around things that weren't important or lacked any sort of explanation otherwise, and that was just for something to do.  edit: words and a link."

ENB is quite possibly the biggest name the Souls games have ever seen and he's done a lot for the community, he even helped write official guides.   Back to his playthrough though. He does an extremely good job of reading every item description or piece of lore he can find and explaining them and the world. If you're into Vaati's lore videos then you will love ENB's playthrough.  As for myself, I'm quite a fan of the way the story is told in those games. You have to look for clues, it is not spoon fed. However, when you do look for it, you discover a very deep and well thought out story."
truegaming,3dttph,busteross,14,Sun Jul 19 13:37:06 2015 UTC,"I think the beauty of Dark Souls story telling is that it tells a pretty plain fantasy tale in an extremely interesting way, and has as much depth as you want it to have. It's amazing to me that the Dark Souls ""play how you want"" approach to design informs every aspect of the game, including the storytelling.   Dark Souls is a perfect example of the fact that you don't need a crazy, convoluted plot to have a good story. It's about telling your story in a compelling way. Another good example of this is Mad Max: Fury Road. This is something that a lot of people who don't read a lot struggle with. They get wrapped up in allegory and symbols, or they get their tits blown off by a crazy twist, and think that that's good story telling. But it's not. It's just an interesting plot. A good storyteller can take even the least interest plot and make it compelling, and a bad storyteller can take a very interesting plot and make it boring as hell. If someone were to demand that I sit down and re-tell the story of A Farewell to Arms in my own words, I could hit every single plot point, but it still wouldn't be as good as the original book, because I'm not as good a storyteller as Ernest Hemmingway.   If you want to know more about the story, I've found Quelaag's and EpicNameBro's lore videos to be the most in-depth. ENB's especially, because he's worked in person with the From guys and bounced some of his theories around in their offices."
truegaming,3dttph,freeogy,8,Sun Jul 19 14:38:06 2015 UTC,"To be fair I believe Dark Souls storytelling is a huge hit or miss. I particularly love it, but I know plenty of people who haven't been hooked in the story because it's hard to get into and some key lore elements are pretty hidden or subjective; I think VaatiVydia, DaveControl, ENB and other Dark Souls ""scholars"" became popular not just because they spread the word about this great series, but because most people wouldn't get into its story without them. Which makes me wonder how much would it be loved without this kind of complementary material made by fans."
truegaming,3dttph,cardosy,2,Sun Jul 19 16:12:41 2015 UTC,"I would call that a strength though. As yo usaid, it created something for the community to talk about."

truegaming,3dttph,cardosy,2,Sun Jul 19 17:04:27 2015 UTC,No disrespect but fuck 'em. Not every game has to appeal to every last person on the planet.
truegaming,3dttph,Gargenville,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:27:21 2015 UTC,"The thing is, though, that the method of storytelling is consistent with the holistic design of Dark Souls. The game teaches you all kinds of things about itself without actually verbalizing it. For instance, the game never says, ""Be aware of your weapon arc and the space you're fighting in!"" It teaches you by putting you in combat scenarios that reprimand you for not respecting your arc.   So, while the plot or technique itself might not be effective for everyone, it fits into the game in a way that makes perfect design sense. And, to be fair, what story is compelling to everyone? It seems to me that the storytelling is generally effective with people who enjoy Dark Souls from a gameplay perspective which, I think, is indicative of it being effective at what it seeks to do."
truegaming,3dttph,freeogy,2,Sun Jul 19 18:23:57 2015 UTC,"Oh, by no means I'm saying that DS storytelling isn't great or doesn't fit the game. They're masterfully crafted together! But its delivery method isn't as accessible as pretty much any other game. A player can (and I imagine a lot of people did) literally finish the game without knowing who the main caracter is, who is everybody he's fighting against, and why he is doing it... And even if you can learn a lot of things about the lore by reading item descriptions and etc, some plots are still pretty hard or even impossible to understand without speculation, which is a bit harsh for people who really want to understand the story but doesn't know how to look for it. A detail only explained on a description of an item which has 0.5% chance to drop from a boss you fight against a single time on New Game +2? Come on! Not saying such item exists, but the example isn't that far from ones which actually exist in the game."
truegaming,3dttph,cardosy,3,Sun Jul 19 23:52:44 2015 UTC,"This is so true and it baffles me that developers aren't experimenting with storytelling more. I remember reading an article by Hitbox Team the developers of Dustforce. They brought up some really interesting points about cutscenes and compared cutscenes to silent movie in the early 20th century and how games using cutscenes lose their interactivity and movies using text lose their cinematography. Here's the article for anyone interested : http://hitboxteam.com/designing-game-narrative  I would personally like to see more games limit themselves by not using cutscenes as much. Cutscenes restrict storytelling to the point where most games have divided story and gameplay, so there's the gameplay bit and the cutscene bit. I think Dark souls uses cutscenes perfectly, it uses cutscenes mostly to introduce certain things. The first cutscene is used to introduce the world and the story and the after that they're used to introduce the bosses. There are some cutscenes used for wow factor like When Gough shoots down Kalameet, which was cool as fuck. Aside from Dark Souls  there are very few games that i can think of that tell their story in an interesting way. Of the games that i've played that have good storytelling (no indie games) Bloodborne, Half-life series, Shock series, Metroid Prime series and Call of Juarez : Gunslinger. Feel free to correct me on these as well as suggest more."
truegaming,3dttph,skinny__panda,5,Sun Jul 19 16:23:52 2015 UTC,"Shadow of the Colossus approaches its story in an interesting way, using its design and visual cues to turn the apparent ""twist"" into something the player actually expects. As you progress through the game, it becomes clear that your goal is doing damage to you, and it is clear that the Colossi are not ""bad guys"". But because the game only gives you a singular goal -- kill the Colossi -- you are forced to move forward with the same single-minded... what's the word? To tunnel on a goal and ignore all the red flags that maybe that goal isn't in your best interest. A sort of desperate determination.   The Vanishing of Ethan Carter also fuses its design with its storytelling well, by introducing individual elements of the story in no particular order, and forcing the player to sort of piece the timeline together, just like how the player solves mysteries as part of the game itself.  Probably my favorite example of using the game's design and mechanics to tell a story in recent years is Papers Please. Not only because it tells the PC's story so well, but because it manages to incorporate dozens of side stories and player options, despite the player's level of interactivity with the world being extremely restricted.  As for cutscenes, The Walking Dead, I think, is a game that uses cutscenes well, but it's because the nature of the game is such that cutscenes don't feel particularly jarring."
truegaming,3dttph,freeogy,2,Sun Jul 19 16:57:59 2015 UTC,"Papers Please is amazing and is easily one of my favorite indie games. I have yet to play the other games you mentioned, can't get a copy of SotC and don't really know why i haven't bought The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and The Walking Dead. Gonna have to check them out now."
truegaming,3dttph,skinny__panda,6,Sun Jul 19 17:23:17 2015 UTC,"I will say that I didn't find the actual story of Ethan Carter particularly interesting, I just appreciated how the ""solve the puzzle"" paradigm pervaded every level of the game, including how it tells its story. This is something that I think is important in video games -- telling your story in way that fits into the holistic design of your game.   This is actually where I think Half-Life 2 fails in its storytelling. A lot of people say, ""Oh cutscenes are overused and generally bad, and Half-Life 2 doesn't use cutscenes, so it is good."" I think that's kind of facile. Half-Life 2's storytelling stops are often bizarre, because the silent protagonist and freedom of interactivity becomes less and less believable as the game gets more and more crazy. Why is nobody completely weirded out by this messiah figure either staring dumbly at them or, worse yet, not reacting at all to me jumping on the table and kicking their stuff around. The latter is also a problem in Elder Scrolls, though the inclusion of dialogue choices (no matter how mundane) does away with the former."
truegaming,3dttph,freeogy,2,Sun Jul 19 17:40:20 2015 UTC,"I've never really thought of Half-Life 2 that way, i can barely remember the last time i played it. Now that i think about it it is weird having Alex around you pretty much talking to herself since nobody is responding. If i recall correctly the original Half-Life didn't have that problem, there were fewer storybits and it wasn't to awkward since you weren't seen as a holy figure and you weren't able to interact the same way you could in Half-Life 2. I mean you could throw things at the characters like a mad man and nobody would comment on it.  As for The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, I'm fine with it not having a great story. Half-Life 1 didn't have a particularly good story but i still found it interesting."
truegaming,3dttph,skinny__panda,4,Sun Jul 19 18:18:21 2015 UTC,"Half-Life 2 is why I generally consider the ""silent protagonist"" to be a bad trope in a conversation-heavy game. It works in a lot of other games (we've mentioned a couple games already) but anytime you're going to frequently have people speaking directly to the player character, I think creating player dialogue -- either static dialogue or dialogue options -- is a must. Zelda is also problematic with this. As storytelling in games grows in maturity (not content maturity, but just mastery of technique), Zelda's use of a silent protagonist feels increasingly quaint and undermines any attempts at gravitas the story might attempt. This is fine in the light-hearted Zelda games, but it's hard for a serious story to be effective when I can't take the protagonist seriously."
truegaming,3dttph,freeogy,5,Sun Jul 19 18:38:41 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls tells a story without a narrative. The only plot available to you is a history and your goal. The narrative comes from the player themselves as they uncover information about the world.   Since most lore is contained in item descriptions, the player has to act as a archeologist/historian. It's a hybrid role because of the need to find items (archeology) and interpreting their item descriptions (history)."
truegaming,3dttph,CarrionComfort,10,Sun Jul 19 18:15:52 2015 UTC,"How was the Dark Souls stories for you? If you would please, watch a video, how does his interpretation compare to your own? Was anything missed? Anything possibly a lie? Anyone have similar videos for other videos? How easily could you grasp the depth of the Dark Souls story without actively trying to dig into it?   Vaati is well know for being very liberal with his interpretation of the lore. The goal of his videos is ultimately to tell a compelling story, and he is willing to veer off accepted lore to do that. A fairly clear example of that is his Solaire video, where he makes Solaire be the firstborn of Gwyn when it is, at best, a very debated topic. I'm personally less interested in this kind of content, but it is still pretty good."
truegaming,3dttph,MechaSoySauce,6,Sun Jul 19 18:06:53 2015 UTC,"he makes Solaire be the firstborn of Gwyn when it is, at best, a very debated topic.   I think it's confirmed that this is not the case. Pretty sure that Miyazaki said that Gwyn's firstborn was completely excluded from the game in an interview in the design book. Andre of Astora's model was originally created to be a descendent of Gwyn, so people have speculated that he was the original firstborn."
truegaming,3dttph,freeogy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:49:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, that is why I said that it was at best a debated topic.

I just think that, if it's a given that Andre was originally supposed to be a descendant of Gwyn before whatever the character was was scrapped, then the firstborn is the most likely candidate."
truegaming,3dttph,freeogy,8,Sun Jul 19 19:01:47 2015 UTC,"The thing about Dark Souls' story is that you're never given all the pieces. I recall reading some article about how Miyazaki as a kid would read these English fantasy novels that he didn't fully understand, so he would read one part, then go a few pages without really knowing what was going on, then when something new he understood popped up, he'd piece it together with his imagination, and that's why we have this sort of storytelling in DS.  Anyway, what this results in is that we're given a sort of ""foundation"" to build up from, but in the end it's entirely up to us to actually interpret it. A lot of theories are easily disproved by showing other pieces of information, but in the DS community, you'll find that some things have a lot of possible theories still standing, because there's really no way to tell for sure, and it's just up to personal preference, and at the same time, you'll see a lot of things that pretty much everyone agrees on, even though it's just a theory.  I like this, because it ""involves"" the player on another level (as long as they actually bother with item descriptions and the like, of course). Everyone can come up with their own interpretations that fit how they see the world, which really brings the ""RPG""-experience to a whole other level.  But yeah, Vaati is also someone who interprets this in his own way (though a lot of things he mentions are what's widely accepted as the ""true"" theory), so you can't really call anything he says a ""lie"", even if you can't prove it's entirely correct. Watching lore videos, I think, are a great way to get the story (and backstory) of the game(s), though you'll be stuck with ""their"" interpretation, so to speak, without having played it yourself.  As far as other similar youtubers go, a lot of people have already mentioned ENB here (as they should have), but there are also people similar to Vaati, like Silver Mont, and I know DaveControl has done a few videos as well."

truegaming,3dttph,wolfman1911,0,Sun Jul 19 20:31:15 2015 UTC,"Congrats Reddit, this was enough to make me finally go from lurking to commenting. The salt was too real and I had to comment on this. So uh, hello!  I watched Vaati's videos from way back, and was never part of the more central Souls communities (although I knew people that were.) As a critical thinker prone to heavy analysis myself, it kind of pains me to see the people who are jumping to Vaati's defense after his very weak statement. Let me get into my three reasons why:  (Edits for formatting; first time and all)  1) Paleblood Hunt Plagiarism Maybe it's easy to misjudge how this software works if you've never been in college or had to have a paper under academic scrutiny. That software is no joke and is used in academia to raise flags of caution for plagiarism. Plagiarism in academics is a serious claim not taken remotely lightly, and due to this program has to be heavy-duty to be trusted to raise that alarm. These claims of 'similar words' and 'using item quotations' hold no water, as it is already designed and used around papers that are often on specific subjects that are using quotes from articles as well.  And again this isn't SOME plagiarism being detected. Some sections had 90%+ plagiarism detected. A professor could toss him from a course for less thievery. This is not merely 'stealing' material and ideas. This is stealing tone, stealing voice, stealing narrative.  2) The Lucatiel Scene Leading from talk of narrative and tone, NOW I'm going to bring up the original claim. People are eating up this whole 'limited resources' thing like candy and I'm frankly befuddled. Why did they have to literally sport fence? Why the Heide Knight set? Why the god damn fist pump? These are actually SPECIFIC lines of thought that are not simply going to be what people instantly go to.  Personally I didn't take Aslatiel as some cocky bastard who would fist pump when he beat his sister in a duel for the umpteenth millionth time, and I certainly wouldn't have fallen back on the people who fought with greatswords as sport fencers in practice. And Heide's was some instant go-to for completing the look? The game has dozens of armor sets: off the top of my head I probably would have gone with Throne Watcher or the Monastery Shirt to complete a sport fencing look, not tattered Heide's chainmail.   3) All the Coincidences Once is a chance, twice is a coincidence, thrice is a pattern. Again, this 'minds go similar ways' thing doesn't hold water, and I'm not even bringing up the final duel they both portray (THAT I am willing to give Vaati a pass on.) They both just so happen to have identical armor and weapons, identical choreography, identical locations.   Which leads into the final point, and if anyone can prove me wrong please bring forward evidence for me: has Vaati ever put out any of these major videos prior to these videos or posted theories? If he has no videos where the reverse is true (and why wouldn't he? As the biggest Lore poster on Youtube, why wouldn't he have copycats) and you keep seeing these coincidences of someone else posting information just before he does? It just can't keep being chance.   source https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/3cj1w4/vaatividya_responds_to_alleged_plagiarism/csw70ou"

Don't understand the hate, especially after how Hellkite Drake left the community after it turned toxic.  Vaati is an inarguably positive force in the Souls community."
truegaming,3dttph,cheatisnotdead,3,Sun Jul 19 21:03:01 2015 UTC,"I did not play the original Dark Souls, and did not watch this video so I'm probably wrong. Still, I completed Dark Souls 2 along the 3 DLCs and BloodBorne and I really think people try too hard to make out something out of it. Just like an English teacher reading a book and finding references that the author did not even plan to. (ex: Oh the flower are blue, that represent the sadness of the character!). In my opinion, DarkSouls games make the world lore seems bigger than it is really by keeping introducing new unique character and location names out of nowhere. They always look like important names, but ultimately represent nothing."
truegaming,3dttph,Dunge,6,Sun Jul 19 16:33:40 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, DarkSouls games make the world lore seems bigger than it is really by keeping introducing new unique character and location names out of nowhere. They always look like important names, but ultimately represent nothing.   Dark souls 2 is very guilty of that, but it's basically not like that in any other Soulsborne game imo. Lots of fans of the series do not like its lore for that very reason, in fact. On the other hand, Dark Souls 1 has very strong characters that you end up meeting (or not). An interesting thing is that the DLC came out at a much later point than the initial game, and much of the lore had already been researched by that time. People had already figured out that Oolacile was formerely in Dark root garden, that Ciaran was female or that humanity was the dark soul. The DLC basically came to confirm that, which was pretty cool."
truegaming,3dttph,MechaSoySauce,3,Sun Jul 19 17:58:47 2015 UTC,"I mean, the reason the developer did the story like that is so you could have fun trying to solve the mystery of it.  Saying people are reading too much into it is like saying people are wrong for trying to go for a really high score in another type of game. Some people just get really into certain games, if they're having fun, then nothing's wrong with that.  Also I have to add that Dark Souls 1 has pretty definite lore, 2 is a little open ended which leads to a lot of debate, and Bloodborne was literally made to be hard to understand. There are some definites in Bloodborne but the meaning of it all is kind of ambiguous, the director did that specifically so he could ponder the games story as well. So you kind of had bad first encounters with lore in Soul's games to be honest."

Not that you can even believe me, but I'm an English major at MSU, about to start my 4th year, and these games tell truly deep stories. What Dark Souls is, in fact, is a literary deconstruction of the light/dark binary. And Bloodborne, who's story is fantastic, is essentially a battle between gods representing human evolution vs. devolution.   It's really deep in there, but it's there, and it takes some expansive thinking to reel in all of the loose ends. But that's why I love it."
truegaming,3dttph,bendovergramps,5,Mon Jul 20 03:38:13 2015 UTC,"I'm going against the grain here, possibly getting downvoted for it but whatever. I'm on mobile, so sorry for any mistake.  I hate what the ""lore"" or ""story"" is in Dark Souls 1 and 2. I never played Demon Souls so I don't have an opinion on it, but I doubt it's much different.  I'm a casual lore-nut, I like it when a game has a good story and completely makes me forget the world around me. DS has shite lore. It's a complete joke. It all relies on speculation on our end. That's not ""AMAZING STORYTELLING"" as many would like to claim, it's just lazy. ""B-But Zyvron, it's all up for your own interpretation...."" I hear you say. Well that's all fine and dandy if it actually has a solid lore as basic and we the player can expand upon that. DS just has a setting, plops you in on the spot and say ""Go my stupid player, go kill some monsters until you kill the end boss."" Congratulations! Game complete! Every boss drops 1 item which has a short description, maybe you find some items in (hidden) chests along the way, and you'll encounter roughly 5 NPCs who can tell you a story. That's as far as the game is willing to tell you the lore. All other lore has to be read up on from fansites or the wiki, or taken from YouTube like the videos of Vaasi, taken from the most cryptic of cryptic shit found in the games. I walk around in the world of DS and it's empty. Walk around, kill some monsters, die 3 times before you reach the boss, try to beat the boss, die 50 times (YAY FUN TIMES), kill the boss, enter next area. What just happened? I don't know, because the 1 NPC that was willing to talk to me went full retard and started repeating the same sentence over and over again. Now I've to turn to the internet to even understand anything basic about the lore that the game should have told me in the first place. Why am I here? I don't know, because the 1 NPC that was willing to talk to me went full retard and started repeating the same sentence over and over again. Why do I want to kill the bosses? I don't know, because the 1 NPC that was willing to talk to me went full retard and started repeating the same sentence over and over again. Why would I even bother doing anything as I turn in one of the doomed (forgot the name, the monsters you fight all the time) eventually? I don't know, because the 1 NPC that was willing to talk to me went full retard and started repeating the same sentence over and over again. ""B-But Zyvron.... INTERPRETATION..."" >insert spongebob rainbow pic here< Who cares about interpretation of the lore if the lore is such an empty shell that you could go the whole game casually playing and understanding fuck-all about it? Having to look up lore on the internet because the game isn't clear isn't ""absolutely amazingly awesomely intuitive"", it's lazy. They let the writers write a weak story which they can loosely connect through items in-game, and let the playerbase do the rest. How anyone can see that as amazing is beyond me.  That's what I think about the lore and storytelling of DS."
truegaming,3dttph,Zyvron,5,Sun Jul 19 21:52:47 2015 UTC,"You're so close to getting it, almost more than the people who try to understand the lore.  Dark Souls is a game about an empty, dying world.  Dark Souls is a game about the player wandering randomly about killing shit for reasons they don't quite understand.  Dark Souls is a game about how the past fades into legend, becomes an obscured narrative.  Dark Souls is a game about how the player dies over and over again, and how they either give up or make it through what was once impossible.  Dark Souls is a game about how everyone you meet, and everything you conquer, is a nearly pointless remnant.  Dark Souls is not about when which God did what, or how dumb time travel is in such a universe, or the agriculture of a made-up, barely mentioned fantasy kingdom, or anything else like that.  The meaning is in there, but players seem to miss it consistently, either for reasons like yours, or because they care too much about insignificant details."
truegaming,3dttph,page0rz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:24:26 2015 UTC,"That's one of the reasons I think Dark Souls 2 may actually be even more brilliant than the first in terms of lore. People talk about how the first has all sorts of great lore, etc, etc, but in the second one everyone is so dreary constantly. No one knows why they're doing what they're doing, even the Bearer of the Curse. You just go for heaven knows why from place to place, driven only by the player and ultimately reach a goal that doesn't even matter because of the cyclical nature of the story."
truegaming,3dttph,meikyoushisui,3,Mon Jul 20 03:37:40 2015 UTC,"Playing the game and simultaneously reading about the lore on the Internet was one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.   I was never one to care much about the backstory or lore of games and movies like lord of the rings but the dark souls world was so interesting and hidden that it pulled me in.   Just like the other comment said, you feel like an archeologist walking through a world waiting to be discovered. If there was no Internet I don't think I could've finished dark souls since the game simply doesn't give a shit about telling you where to go.  It's a true adventure in the way the first zelda was an adventure."
truegaming,3dttph,mobilegod,2,Sun Jul 19 16:48:57 2015 UTC,"I have similar sentiments to people who aren't too fond of the story in Dark Souls and this is my general experience with the souls community in a nutshell: ""Dark Souls (DS) is the Game of the Generation!"" And there are also those that love to do mental gymnastics and spout a lot of fluff to exaggerate how revolutionary the game is, how all other games are doing it wrong, and that developers need to learn a few things from FromSoft.   I love DS, invested over 250 hours in to the game, and collected all the achievements (which really does open you up to most of everything the game has to offer). It just bothers me when people say that DS does things better than other games in different genres that specialize in those specific features that DS supposedly ""trumps"".  The story is pretty cliched if you ignore the lore. You're basically the chosen one (chosen undead) who saves the world by killing baddies (purging the land of the Undead curse), with a few so-so plot twists here and there. There's also the standard fare of being able to choose between a good and bad ending.  As for the lore, it's only interesting if it suits your tastes, but it doesn't make the game's story great. A lot of games have deep lore if you put enough effort into looking for it. I frequent quite a few fan forums of a number of games and I read interesting lore discussions all the time, but most don't equate the quality of a game's story being based on the lore behind it all. It comes off like a double standard when people claim that the story in DS is great because of it's lore, but they fail to acknowledge that mostly EVERY game has lore in it and it's just a matter of it appeals to you more than others. For example, the Devil May Cry (DMC) series has lore based on Judeo-Christian themes which I find more interesting than the lore in DS, but I have never stated nor seen anyone say that any of the DMC games have great stories because of their lore. In fact, there's a near consensus in the community that their stories are pretty bad compared to others and that the games' main appeal is their combat and action set pieces.  As for the combat in DS... a lot of the stuff I read frustrates me a bit. ""It's difficult, but fair."" ""Git gud."" ""[Insert older game] totally rips off Souls combat."" How is it even possible for a game to rip off DS when DS wasn't even being made yet!? I don't even know how people can say the combat in DS is great. It's okay-ish at best, and it's not that hard at all. The barrier of entry or learning curve to the combat may be high, but the skill ceiling is relatively low compared to other games with higher levels of gameplay; particularly in competitive and/or fast-paced action games (e.g., Fighting, Hack and Slash/Beat 'em Ups, FPS, MOBA games, etc). The combat in DS isn't ""difficult"", it's just very punishing. It was basically marketed as being ""hard"" and a masochist's wet dream, but it really wasn't. I've died more in games where mastery of a specific aspect of combat is needed to succeed while in DS, I can just lock-on, circle strafe, occasionally dodge/block/attack, and repeat until I kill mostly everything. It's formulaic. There's nothing in the combat that you can't find in other games, provided you're not a casual gamer and actually play other games at higher difficulties which basically adjusts the damage a player deals and takes. I just believe that a lot of people who claim DS is ""hard"" haven't really played many games at level near their skill ceilings and really shouldn't be jumping the gun to that conclusion. Although I will admit, the combat complements the most important thing that DS does well compared to many games, and that's atmosphere. Also, FromSoft looks like it's going in the right direction with action and combat in Bloodborne as it requires stricter timing and a greater sense of awareness than the slower paced, turtle-style combat of DS.  To me, the atmosphere should be the main appeal of DS and shouldn't be overshadowed by it's ""difficulty"". Everything complements the atmosphere very well, from the art style, pacing, combat, cryptic mechanics, horror elements, etc. And the atmosphere does a great deal for immersion that I haven't found in many other games. Those discrete pieces that make up the atmosphere in DS, when analyzed alone, can't compare to pieces in other games that specialize in them solely, but it's the holistic bringing together of those okay-ish to pretty good elements which sets DS as a superior package to many other games out there for me."
truegaming,3dttph,lostl0ok,3,Mon Jul 20 04:52:09 2015 UTC,"A comment I made on a different topic, but also about Dark Souls.   The difficulty is a smokescreen, though. In the grand scheme of things, the Souls games are not difficult. Even by action game standards they're not a big deal--though that can depend on difficulty modes. They do have a pacing that, while not unforgiving, readily punishes impatience. It's the series focus on death as a part of the game world, as an aesthetic, that suggests there's more standing in the player's way than there actually is.  The Souls games are about dying, and that's part of what sets them apart, but that doesn't mean any game in which the player dies a lot is comparable.   It's true that the games aren't that hard, really. It's a marketing gimmick paired with some clever game design, and then plopped down in a market filled to the brim with incredibly easy games."
truegaming,3dttph,page0rz,0,Mon Jul 20 05:04:10 2015 UTC,"Easily one of my top 3 favorite game stories, because it doesn't shove it down your throat. Think about it, if you actually were that character in the game (as in living the character) you wouldn't have a legion of people explaining the world for you. You wouldn't need to be told that Skyrim is in the midst of a civil war, or that you signed up for Vault-Tec and somehow forgot about it.  Dark Souls basically says ""here's a sword, go find your destiny"" without going on about how important you are. You're a wanderer who's along for the ride, enjoy it as it is. Dragonslayer Ornstein is my favorite video game character of all time, because I don't know his life story and the exact length of his dick in centimeters. He's enigmatic, like most other characters in Dark Souls. He's a badass whose story won't be told by NPC dialogue, but by the speculation of those forced to fight and kill him. He's appears bigger than his fellow game characters because the devs don't outline his character with pre-recorded voice lines, his greatness is fluid and unknown, much like the rest of Dark Souls."
truegaming,3dttph,Greyfells,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:08:51 2015 UTC,"I recently started watching a ""let's play"" by the guys over at Extra Credits of Dark Souls.   In case nobody's mentioned it, you might also enjoy Matthewmatosis's Demon's Souls commentary.   How was the Dark Souls stories for you?   Fragmented, stilted, and largely left to the imagination. Mostly irrelevant, really. And, personally, I think it was perfect that way.  Consider the horror genre. The monster in a work of horror is often at its very best when the audience knows very little about it. They'll conjure to their minds individually forms so terrible and personal that the author would never even have considered them in their wildest flights of fancy. It is when the monster shifts from this ephemeral terror to a known quantity that the magic is suddenly gone. The audience gets some cheap thrills and catharsis, but that superior horror - possible to experience only in imposed ignorance - vanishes forever.  I believe wonder is the bright opposite of the horror monster in this regard: that the feeling of fantasy, awe, and inspiration dull instantly in the face of authorized explanation.  Time after time in Dark Souls I felt wonder, and I think such a thing is only truly possible where the author exercises significant restraint. For example, Sen's Carnival Funhouse, or I suppose Fortress if I must, straddles that line between the realistic and the fantastic. It is precisely because Dark Souls feeds you information in stilted snippets, devoid of significant context, that you feel satisfied there is an explanation of Sen's Fortress, and yet you do not feel satisfied that you know what it is.  The entire game embraces this idea. Players are only given few words to convey messages to each other - you get the gist, but not the details. You only get the story in grandiose, vague snippets. The game exists in a perpetual cycle, never truly ending - just getting harder and harder, until you decide to call it quits.  Dark Souls purposefully leaves empty space in lieu of closure and explanation in order to preserve the player's sense of wonder. It provides powerful, but isolated, bits of information. Here's a fantastic location full of lava and demons. Here's a small paragraph describing Gwyn bringing his knights to the Kiln of the First Flame. Here's two sets of stairs - one too large for humans - right next to each other. It creates tiny and remote points of light in your intellectual landscape, and then lets you marvel at the darkness.  That's what I like about the story of Dark Souls. It exercises the restraint necessary to makes you wonder."

I'm sure, no I KNOW there's some incredibly deep story that ties together all of your objectives, but it does not do a good job of explaining what this means or why you should care about this.   Bloodborne did a SLIGHTLY better job with keeping the story interesting, by throwing in pieces of information that you can slowly tie together yourself.

I can say I was part of the speculating fanbase that made up many of the theories. It was fun trying to analyze everything and realizing how much attention to detail was put in this. Vaati has put toooooo much speculation by now though, the quality of his lore videos went downhill after he ran out of quality things to say, they're still entertaining though.

truegaming,3dqgil,Rekthor,66,Sat Jul 18 13:30:27 2015 UTC,"I really think Deus Ex:HR did this quite well. There were certain abilities that were overall 'better' than others (Icarus fall system vs. carrying a few more inventory items), but every choice was significant. And while many abilities were locked within a small tree, you could really mix and match without too much loss--whereas in most skill trees if you don't make it to the capstone you're losing a huge lead. It allowed for more varied play style, and some tweaking as you played more (I didn't need a few of the sneaking augs bc I was fine without them).  I think the issue the number-systems have is that they give you too many 'points' to spend. If you have 50+ levels to get through, which each level being at least one point (Witcher having 3 bronze points/level at the beginning). It would be developmentally exhausting to create a skill system big enough to account for at least 75 unique skills for 50 levels (bc you want people to be able to customize their play style), and don't even think of having multiple classes then. However, if you do have a lot of points being awarded, a gradual increase in percentages is simply the one of the better development-vs.-playability balances. I would prefer fewer, more rewarding abilities, but that's a player preference. I don't think one system is inherently 'better.'  As for Skyrim, I've just started playing so take this with a grain of salt, but I think it actually does it pretty well. I'm playing as a thief, and while some abilities are number increases, there are some significant abilities that come out to make me feel more powerful as I level up."

Often boils down to getting to skip combat occasionally - which almost never outweighs being stronger in combat - or having more gold to get better gear for combat - but being better at combat helps you get more gold so... Plus Skyrim had nothing expensive worth buying aside from crafting materials because the player was the best smith/alchemist/enchanter in the game.  I could rant on and on about the details but the short story is Skyrim just has sucky character building elements and combat.  They really should've scrapped their lazy ass level scaling system and just let players use common sense to avoid obviously more dangerous creatures at low level. It makes the world much more interesting. People who wanted to burn through the main quest could've just set the difficulty to easy(or make ""normal"" even more extremely easy to bother people's egos).  It just made no sense having bandits that were more likely to kill me than most dragons because they had some adjective next to their name.

They really should've scrapped their lazy ass level scaling system and just let players use common sense to avoid obviously more dangerous creatures at low level   That leads to situations where you have trivialized content because you were on the other side of the map when you were in the appropriate level range, and it no longer presents a challenge or is in any way fun. Definitely not a great solution either.    It just made no sense having bandits that were more likely to kill me than most dragons because they had some adjective next to their name. They wear the same terrible armor as a level 1 bandit but take 10x as much damage to kill woo, how exciting.   Yeah, they messed up the dragons. Overusing them, and gimping them so you could kill them at low levels as a part of the progression."

Imo having helpful companions being stronger based on your social skills and your gear being better based on your crafting skills would really help alleviate the combat skill advantage."
truegaming,3dqgil,emikochan,25,Sun Jul 19 13:13:42 2015 UTC,"The only gripe I really have with Skyrim levels is that me getting better at Speech and Smithing also counted toward the ""Oh your higher level? So are the draugrs!"" quota.   Skyrim is actually a massive improvement over Oblivion for that. In Skyrim, some enemies will always stay the same level, while Elites like Draugrs scale with the players.  In Oblivion, literally everything scaled with the player, meaning that if the player didn't leave the starting city after escaping from jail and instead decided to spend 5-8 levels doing the Thieves Guild quests, they would leave the city only to find that all that sneaking and talking to shopkeepers they've done has caused even the wimpiest imp to suddenly tear them a new asshole."
truegaming,3dqgil,Skitterleaper,3,Sat Jul 18 21:47:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Skyrim's system is actually an improvement over both Oblivion's ""scale all the things!"" and no scaling ever. Not only that, it had area-dependent spawn lists, so you could have bandits of level 3-8 in one area and 7-13 in another.  According to the average time played most people didn't really get far in Skyrim though (10 hours?) so they didn't notice bandits actually don't get that much harder.  Granted, I knew what I was doing, but I solely leveled non-combat skills especially sneaking and lockpicking, in anticipation of all that sweet loot when I finally got my ass around to traveling. Sure, it was a little tough at first, but nowhere near impossible like many apparently claim. I haven't met anyone who can back up their claim that the game becomes impossible to play because the enemies are too hard if you spend a whole bunch of early levels raising non-combat skills. I find it unbelievable they didn't resort to sniping using archery and spells, which is how I finally got started with combat at level 20+."
truegaming,3dqgil,dankisms,2,Mon Jul 20 10:42:02 2015 UTC,"It's a much improved system, and I very much prefer it over Oblivion's system,  but it did lead tothe slightly unsatisfying situation where I'm kicking down doors to dungeons and slaughtering my way through unopposed, killing enemies in one hit and teleporting around in combat with my shouts, only to find the Draugr at the end of the dungeon is this overleveled arrow sponge that can disarm me and send my weapons rocketing over the horizon while doing half my health in damage with every hit while my slashes bounce off him. I get that not every enemy is a mook, but while I do have maxed out one handed it takes my maxed out smithing and speech as well and makes the scaled enemies WAY too powerful.  Maybe if it weighted non combat skills less heavily when determining level..?"
truegaming,3dqgil,Skitterleaper,7,Mon Jul 20 13:32:03 2015 UTC,"Smithing is a combat skill, though. It buffs weapon damage and defense for both you and your follower. Its not as efficient as the dedicated weapon/armor skills, of course, but that's because it buffs both categories for all of you."

Not sure if an enchanted item fault, or a heavy armor perk from PerMa).

The perks are also quite noticeable (with the exception of a few ""numbers perks"")."

truegaming,3dqgil,CutterJohn,5,Tue Jul 21 07:50:00 2015 UTC,"This makes me think of the game ""Path of Exile"" Which is at it's core a massive numbers game.

I don't have the expertise to go into thoroughly however so I will just link the online talent viewer.    Behold, The ""Passive skill tree"" http://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-tree  Certainly, This style of approach has given Path of exile a harsh learning environment and if you feel you have picked the wrong or suboptimal talents it's easier and quicker to just reroll the character and start a new. But At the same time there is a lot of fun in ""But....What if I do this next time?"""
truegaming,3dqgil,Anjilo,24,Sat Jul 18 15:02:42 2015 UTC,"I started playing PoE just a few weeks again, and I really do love the passive skill tree. Some passives are truly game-changing - they aren't just % this or % that, the keystone passives add new effects to the game, introduce new strategies/playstyles, etc - and it opens up a myriad of build possibilities as there are very strong interactions between the different passives, and the passives are much more ""in depth"" than in most games, allowing a huge range of customisation.  I find it to be a great way to do passives; you're not thinking ""hmm, +5% damage, nice"" but ""hmm, +30% damage when I'm under 50% life ? That's nice.. And if I couple it with this passive which allows me to spend life instead of mana for spells, and this other one which allows me to rely much more on energy shields than on health points for survival, allowing me to safely bring my health down.. And use these skill gems with it..""  But PoE does this by ""freeing"" active skills which are no longer linked to any kind of tree. All in all I find it to be a great system; it allows for a huge amount of individual experimentation and an incredible diversity of builds. Of course, the problem is that it's very hard to come back on your decisions without having to roll a new character.  Then again, I'm rather new to the game, so maybe I'll become disenchanted with it all as I learn more about it, but I feel like a passive skill tree of this sort would really be amazing for a game like Dark Souls, due to the already high diversity of playstyles, of effects brought into play by different weapons and equipment, etc (movesets, attack speed, evade versus block, damage types, ...).. Less so for games which rely less on customisation, and thus offer less tools to tweak, like the Witcher."
truegaming,3dqgil,SuperBlaar,13,Sat Jul 18 15:37:46 2015 UTC,"Nah, as somebody with over a hundred PoE hours, and who's friends with players who have thousands under their belt, there are always new, fun and viable builds to try.  A key part is that the game is PvE, so they have an easier time balancing a wide variety of fun and interesting builds. If you dare browse the forums now you'll find DOZENS of completely viable builds per class, and there are many, many more, if you'll experiment. Stay in Wonderland and see how deep the rabbit-hole goes."
truegaming,3dqgil,TunaSammich,2,Sun Jul 19 05:05:51 2015 UTC,"To be fair Path of Exile can get away with the skill/talent tree being like that because they still allow for the change in gameplay the OP was looking for they just don't do it as much through the passive tree.    Between keystone passives, unique items, and the skill gem and support system you can get gameplay changes more than standard unlock new skill and/or increase in stats.  For example they keystone ""Ancestral Bond"" lets you have 2 totems up at the same time (default is only 1) but the cost is you can't deal damage yourself anymore. This means you can't self cast/attack and need to rely on totems, traps, mines, and minions (zombies and things like that). This totally changes the way you play because most builds do all their damage from self casting/attacking but you can't do that any more.  Another example is the spell Fireball. You can build it so each cast you send out 5 Fireballs with the support gem Greater Multiple Projectiles and each of them have huge AoE because of the Increased Area of Effect support gem. Or you could build it so you hit super hard on one monster and trigger an ignite with Chance to Ignite support gem and then make that ignite ""infect"" other mobs near by with Elemental Proliferation so all mobs melt to the burn. Two totally different ways of using the same exact skill.  So yes 99% of Path of Exile's passive tree is just stat increases but they do the gameplay changing stuff with the 1% of the tree and things outside it."
truegaming,3dqgil,Zoogy,2,Sat Jul 18 15:45:29 2015 UTC,"I believe you aren't doing PoE justice. Sure, a lot of thos tiny nods are just regular +x nodes, but there are some major nods which change the gameplay drastically.   In PoE I just don't feel like every level up is a ""real"" level up, maybe every 10th is.  the reson why the talent tree is so massive is, because every charachter has the same one, but only uses roughly 10% of it."

truegaming,3dqgil,Anjilo,6,Sat Jul 18 23:35:02 2015 UTC,"A part of the issue is how a player thinks about that talent tree.  For example, as a seasoned player, when I make a build I think of the core passive talents I would like for my character, and then I think about creating an optimal path to those talents that gives me a good balance of offense and defense.  I think a lot of new players will just see this tree as a queue of passive talents.  Instead of seeing the talent tree as just an ever increasing set of new skills, PoE players see it as a plan to create a playstyle and the path to fulfill that plan.  For example, this is my current build's passive skill tree.  While many may look at this and have no clue what this means, since I was the one who created it, I understand what this means for my character.  For example, the Celestial Punishment, Elementalist, and Freeze talents are the core of my build, an ice-based melee magic find character.  For defense, I chose to take the Acrobatics and Phase Acrobatics talents.  With these core talents in mind, I also know I want a good balance of life nodes and critical strike chance nodes.  The challenge then is creating a tree that can accomplish those goals.  For me, this was a much more fulfilling experience than just: ""Click on next available skill"", since I had to choose how to optimize my experience."

The swirling appearance of all the nodes is very misleading.  http://media.gameinternals.com/ffx-sphere-grid/straightened-sphere-grid.png  Meanwhile the paths down the PoE tree take you in entirely new directions, you aren't just jumping between these straight lines of passives. The Final Fantasy tree is just the WoW tree, but you can skip from the end of one tree to the middle of another and vica versa.   Edit: This isn't to say the FF tree is bad, its just that it only appears similar to the PoE tree because of the UI."

It decisively does not have a talent system at all, and leveling up to get stats boosts your numbers a tiny amount, sure, but increasing stats has much more to do with meeting requirements to wield a weapon/spell than making your defense or damage two points higher."
truegaming,3dqgil,daemonicBookkeeper,18,Sat Jul 18 16:27:02 2015 UTC,"I've been complaining about this for years.  Incremental percentage increases of stats have always been a part of leveling up, but in the early years of gaming, developers WISELY kept this information hidden from the player -  because it's just not important to the game experience.  It's breaks immersion and has nothing to do with the role playing experience, especially in a medieval fantasy game setting.  The problem started when MMO's like Everquest, Diablo and WoW got fiercely competitive, players started demanding to look under the hood, to SEE the numbers associated with certain skills, weapons & armor.  To get the competitive edge, players decided to get scientific and run their own math and determine what loot and builds really were the most effective.  This is also when player-created concepts started emerging, like DPS.  Soon, every player who wanted to be included in high end play HAD to be aware of all this - if your build and play style did not conform to standards, you were not included.  Many developers got on board with this new ""under the hood"" approach and started offering more and more information to the player regardless if it made any sense in the game.  Now you could SEE the percentage increase in the power of every upgrade.    This is where things went off the rails.  Developers started thinking that the underlying math of the game was now a REWARD for a player and brought it out into center stage, believing that we should somehow be excited about leveling up and spending that point on 2% bonus to melee attack.    I do hope the trend stops and sanity is restored.  I mean, what is Geralt actually doing when he sockets a red mutagen that will upgrade his attack power 40%?  Is he sticking them up his butt?"
truegaming,3dqgil,Silvershanks,9,Sat Jul 18 15:19:07 2015 UTC,"To get the competitive edge, players decided to get scientific and run their own math and determine what loot and builds really were the most effective.   I think this is why you can never go back, at least in MMOs with individual roles. With any type of talent tree, people are going to spreadsheet that stuff to death and find out the optimal path through the talent tree to get the most efficient build for their individual role (DPS, tank, healer, etc). Even if you take out the exact percentage increase from a talent and/or take out damage meters, people are going to run their own tests to find out the increase for a talent, or how a new ability increases their efficiency.  I'm not sure there's any answer to this, at least for online games. When I played the Witcher 3, I didn't research any specific build. I went with talents that fit my playstyle. But if it was an online game, I would feel the need to make sure I was getting the most of out of my character as to not be a detriment to my teammates. If my role is to DPS, I should be doing the most DPS I can. If my role is to tank, I owe it to my healer to have the best tanking gear and spec I can.  This is one of the reasons (among many others) that I am burned out on MMOs. I've been playing them since old school MUDs in the 90's, to Everquest, to WoW, to all the new variants.

For me though, adventure is even more important.  I like games that put a heavy emphasis on actual player skill rather than level.  Dark Souls is a decent example of this, although not as much as I'd like. Essentially, a SKILLED low-level player can still beat an unskilled high-level player.  If you think about it, wide stat-range levelling doesn't make a whole lot of sense in terms of realism. You start with 26HP, and later in the same week, you have 900HP? I don't buy it.  Another thing that I hate is when enemies level with you. Oh, those level 2 wolves that were hard when you were level 2, and now are super easy against your level 5 character? They're all level 5 wolves now, and hard again. What?  ""Below"" by Capybara Games, coming out in a few months, looks incredible, and they promise that there is no level system -- it's going to be all about learning from experience. Your brain levels up. Now there's an idea!  That's all I ever wanted anyway. It feels silly when my weapons fluctuate in damage output depending on how high level my enemies are. A sword in the neck is supposed to kill most everything. How about letting the player encounter enemies with increased weapon skill, dodging and armor as they progress, rather than 10x HP?  It all tastes like game engine laziness when using the same attacks with increasing values.  Oh right! Adventure!  Tell us a story! Give us a lot of lore to (optionally!) dig into! Set some intesting tones. Make us feel the world! (Oh, and some high places to look at the game world from are always appreciated, as long as it fits the setting!)"

I remember in EQ I went after a ton of wisdom items for my shaman, because hey, the character creation screen said I needed wisdom! After like 40 levels I decided to test out some shit, and amazingly, found that all it did was increase my mana pool. Absolutely nothing else. At which point I stopped caring about getting more wisdom, and was indeed rather annoyed at how much time I'd spent in the past to snag a piece of gear with +2 more wis when that barely even made any difference in my effectiveness.

If it's completely up to ""sword skills"" then if I want to replay, or it's a sequel that has a similar system, I can just skip massive parts of it.  You need to have some kind of barrier for skilled players, and stats are the most intuitive kind of barrier."
truegaming,3dqgil,freeogy,2,Sat Jul 18 21:08:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but these barriers can be embedded into your character history, like to enter a zone X, you need the suport of some rebels to break a gate.  That would be like a real world, where you can go to many places, but without following the history you would lack an objective to do so, or the tasks to accomplish.  Personally, i am past the vanilla mmo`s out there, and like more sand box games / mmos that let players themselves setup whats going on. No gates, no artificial boss-fights, just people being people, forming communities and fighting over their differences."

Would be weird if you start the game as a nobody who can just shit on dragons, Skyrim aside."

truegaming,3dqgil,Ayjayz,11,Sun Jul 19 09:52:27 2015 UTC,"Different styles of game need very different skill trees.  Far Cry 3 was primarily a shooter. The takedowns and so on were in service to this rather than the main focus of gameplay. It's also primarily a single-player story-driven experience.  I think skill-trees in pseudo-RPGs or games that have some RPG elements are a lot more straightforward because you only need a limited number of different playstyles and you likely have far less balancing to do between different classes.  The Diablo series is entirely about those skills because they're the totality of your interaction with the world. It's a loot-grinder, so it's paramount that you can stay the course with a wide variety of skills available.  As far as primarily skill-driven games go:  On one side of the spectrum, you might only unlock a few skills that are completely different to others - a fireball, magical armour, teleportation - skills that all do very different things.  The downside there is either you don't have many skill points to invest so your're not getting a steady stream of rewards, and the difficulty curve needs to be quite ""jumpy"", with spikes coinciding with the huge jump in power of a totally new ability.  Or, you do get a steady stream of skills, but they're often redundant or you have so many skills that they're unwieldy.  On the far side of the spectrum, everything is just a steady increase of your numbers - a small number of skills or attributes that steadily increase with largely static gameplay.  Diablo 3 has too little steady progression IMO.  Each level (or couple of levels later on) unlocks a new ""Rune"" or variant on an already unlocked skill (because they're all unlocked around level 35 or so). Although this means there's a fair bit of variation in the skills (and some are quite fun), ultimately you have so much flexibility that it can be a burden, and there's nothing pushing you to play through the game from the start again, so you instead just end up grinding the same way for extended periods of time, rather than exploring the constraints of the early game again in more detail. This leads to a very fast turn-around in getting from the start to the end, and without replayability, the point where I stopped playing.  MMOs are on the far side, and there are too many skills that fulfill the same small number of niches and too many incremental improvements that don't change gameplay but rather, string you along to encourage you to keep spending money. The idea is to get you addicted to the little buzz of a minor improvement. It's similar with the stats-driven gear upgrades.  This leads to an extremely lengthy duration for even small improvements, leading to the possibility of just getting bored by the lack of progress. As a result I don't really like MMOs. The only one I play is SWTOR, but I feel like that's a Star Wars game held hostage by MMO elements rather than really enjoying the MMO aspect itself.  To me, something like Diablo 2 was an earlier example of how to get the best of both worlds.  Every 6 levels you unlocked a new tier of skills and you could mix and match any combination of 3 skill trees to any intensity you wanted (up to 20 skill points in 1 skill).  You could go all fire spells, and eschew lightning and cold, you could go all Summoning and avoid damaging attacks or curses and so on for each class, or you could make any combination you liked.  This for me is the template of what I like the most for a primarily skills-driven game. It was quick enough that you felt like you were receiving fresh abilities at a steady rate, it encouraged you to go back to the start and try not only other classes, but also the same class in another way. At the same time, you got regular feedback from the game giving you incremental improvements that would maintain a sense of steady progress, both in terms of the story and the difficulty curve."
truegaming,3dqgil,grogleberry,23,Sat Jul 18 15:10:54 2015 UTC,"I really like Diablo 3 progression and would really like to play a story-oriented game with similar progression. Unfortunately, ""real"" Diablo starts at the end game, so you have to go from 1 to 70 as fast as possible setting difficulty to have no challenge whatsoever."
truegaming,3dqgil,pavlik_enemy,9,Sun Jul 19 08:51:00 2015 UTC,"I mean no disrespect, but I very much disagree with all of your post.   The 'numbers higher' is a issue of power creep if (and only if) it is across the board for the character: all skills, all attacks. Talents that improve damage or crit to specific skills encourage players to use them more, which (in a good game using talents properly) modifies gameplay, and not just by prioritization. For example, if your pyroblast talent is used in conjunction with other talents, like halving the mana cost of all fire skills cast after 'arcane blast' for 3 seconds, and pyroblast has a cooldown of 4 seconds (luckily it's not the only fire skill you have), and maybe cooldown can be reduced with gear... skill pacing, tactics, gearing, and prioritization are all significantly altered. What I'm trying to say is a damage talent on its own is very much boring but if a talent tree is done properly, it can be a vital part of gameplay shift.   I don't know a thing about The Witcher 3, but you're example of Skyrim and Dark Souls, to me, are completely incorrect. In Dark Souls, gameplay can change significantly with a switch of a weapon let alone a with different stats, and even though the base talents are not the most interesting in Skyrim, nor the combat skillful, a character invested in one-handed and heavy armor, and another character invested in sneak and archery, play very differently. Which is the exact opposite of your point, about variation in gameplay.   I'm unsure if I agree with your opinion that in action RPGs the protagonist needs to ascend in power. I was also very intrigued by your analysis that talent trees become popularized by MMOs that cannot significantly alter the gameplay because of the playerbase, and how single player games shouldn't adopt such a restrictive system. Though I also disagree. As long as a system offers enough rewarding gameplay changes per play-through, I really don't care what they use.  Shadow of Mordor I have played, and the Arkham games I have watched. Compared to something like Dark Souls or even, if I could make this stretch, Borderlands 2 (talents, leveling, gear, though an FPS), their gameplay in terms of an RPG and variation, is incredibly hollow. Yes, you get new abilities. By the end, everyone's character is the same. The ""new attacks"" are button combinations that mimic (or are the exact same) as previous attacks, maybe an extra X or two tapped, a trigger held, etc.. It would be good and not so... hollow... if I wasn't playing a fighting game slowed down to the point of triviality. Yet even worse, you rarely have to worry about positioning. Yet even worse, and in contrast to your point, the flow of gameplay doesn't change at all! (More on this below.)  My roommate loves this genre but he constantly rages at the lack of control of his character. I call the genre 'sticky combat'. Because while you do get new gadgets (gimmicks) and power is grown exponentially, the combat system is always the same: you analyze targets, sabotage and sneak, go for key enemies, then easily assassinate or continue mashing counter while looking for cues above the enemy's head (because, for some odd reason, all attacks are visually choreographed with symbols). I don't even know why these games have graphics. They can be entirely played with the compass, targeting reticule, and choreographed enemy symbols. So you get more power and attacks, but the flow of gameplay stays the same. In contrast, I think the worst thing about this genre is the total lack of gameplay variety. So of course I totally disagree: the gameplay stays the same. And the power increase, very shallow, in spite of flashier moves or a vehicle mini-game.   In an action RPG, I'm personally not looking for increasing power a la Shadow of Mordor or Arkham. To me, they have zero replay-ability, the combat is shallow, and ironic to your points, the power is entirely the new unlocked skills: the talents without major choices removed from the tree. I want replay-ability, deep combat, some good lore in my ARPG / RPG. I want the power creep to be either my skill or my unique choices. With different characters and choices, gameplay changed a lot in both Dark Souls and Skyrim. And the power increase in Souls, mostly skill, or Skyrim, talents and numbers, was visceral. In dark souls, after 3 playthroughs, I could murder every enemy in most zones without taking damage... at level 1. After a time in Skyrim, dragons were a joke, but each type of character the joke had a different punchline. Each system offered significant variation.   All that to me makes a good RPG / action RPG.  And now, onto your questions....  I think people use talents because it's the easiest way of providing enough gameplay choices to the playerbase, while also allowing them to easily keep and maintain balance. Should they move away from this? Yes. Here's how I think one could do it....  Many MMOs have tied repetitive action to training skills, like sword skill or woodworking. So let's just say you have a combat system with the depth of a souls game. Doesn't need to be the same, as punishing, weapon focused, etc.. Just combat with depth.   If, out of let's say 100 max skill, your character had 3 break points: 25, 50, and 75. Each character can have 1 skill over 75, 3 skills over 50, and 5 skills over 25. All can be leveled to up to 25. You choose in the menu systems which skills to allow past certain break points. There are 20-50 skills (game dependent). You have different weapons as skills, sure, but also magics, guns, tech, and if it's more of an RPG, crafting, lock picking, etc.. For a devil may cry action RPG, each weapon and gun type would have its own skill. It would have to be balanced around it, but I think you catch my drift.  Littered throughout each skill you get, for lack of a better term, ""talents"" (passive or active) that do not supplement each other, but interact with other skills. ""Katana"" skill at 70 causes enemies to bleed, which is a small dot, but greatly enhances the next ""blood magic"" attack. Level 51 talent for blood magic is a weapon buff that lasts for three slices, and heals you. Of course weapons have a large variety of attacks, so you wait for an opening then do a 2 handed charge attack....  This sort of system in an action RPG like Devil may cry or Dark souls or God of War would make me really, really happy."
truegaming,3dqgil,zyphor77,3,Sat Jul 18 17:44:24 2015 UTC,"I was messing around in the WoW trial, as I hadn't played in years at this point and, ironically, the ""WoW-style"" talent tree isn't even in WoW anymore.   I'll point out that WoW's original talent systems (the one you're referring to) drew heavily from Diablo II, so calling it the ""MMO-ization"" isn't really accurate. As was mentioned, it's just another thing to add in so that ""with RPG elements"" can be a talking point for your game in reviews."
truegaming,3dqgil,freeogy,6,Sat Jul 18 14:13:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the new talent system feels incredibly bland compared to how it used to be.

truegaming,3dqgil,ToastedCupcake,4,Sat Jul 18 15:05:51 2015 UTC,"I disagree somewhat. It's bland now, but it used to be worse. There was no choice at all before - there was an optimal way to spec your talents in each tree with maybe one or two options that were not subpar to choose from. Everyone used the same talents for the same things, there was no creativity or variation. If you were a healing druid you had almost no choice - the best talents were obvious. At least with this version you're forced into a choice, even if it's not a very good one."
truegaming,3dqgil,KingMoonfish,2,Sat Jul 18 18:32:27 2015 UTC,"I never got far enough into it to judge completely, but there were things I didn't like about it.   15 levels between points was a lot. 15 levels between points was exacerbated by the fact that they didn't really seem to alter your play significantly. It seems like if you're going to have that much of a gap between points that they should have a bigger impact on your character. It seemed like there was always a clear choice depending on your focus, rather than a choice based on style. Like, there was always ""The PvP One"". It seems like once you're max level, you just gotta go down the list and find the skill that corresponds to what part of the game you're building for."
truegaming,3dqgil,freeogy,4,Sat Jul 18 15:11:43 2015 UTC,"It's true that some talents are simply optimal for PvP or PvE, but there were always a few talents that you changed on a per-fight basis. I remember when I was raiding SoO in 5.4 I would switch to hand of purity for the Dark Shamans for some ability. I frequently found myself changing my talents to be optimal for given situations.  That being said, it doesn't feel that way when you level up. I leveled up for the first time in cataclysm, and each talent point felt like a cool bonus, and it was consistently rewarding because it happened so often. The current talents don't really feel that way. They're definitely designed with endgame in mind and have depth at that level."

Every time I got a new point I would get giddy, and then be immediately disappointed by the options. In the old trees, every 5-10 points you got something cool. Now you wait 15 levels and you get something marginally useful by itself.   I know it's not popular, but I also kind of miss having to go to a trainer to learn spells. It built the excitement for going back to town, and it made every return to town feel like a huge power spike. Now your character's power grade is a lot gentler.

It opened up for hybrid playroles whereas that was effectively shutdown with Cata (unless you brought dual talents and second gear sets). Additionally,  I just love the element of being able to spend time planning a talent tree spec and then slowly progressing towards unlocking it rather than just getting stuff given to you instantly or automatically as you progress through the game.   But I can see your point of view, even if I personally disagree with it."
truegaming,3dqgil,guy_from_sweden,2,Sat Jul 18 14:15:48 2015 UTC,"There was no option in those talent trees though; there was only the illusion of choice. You could theoretically take any path you wanted, but if you didn't take certain talents that were mathematically and empirically proven to be better, you were at a demonstrable disadvantage. Thus, we had cookiecutter builds that were figured out inside of an hour after their reveal and virtually nobody would deviate from them.

truegaming,3dqgil,Scotlander,8,Sat Jul 18 14:36:54 2015 UTC,"I used to play a druid too; I joined WoW in late 2.4 and got to endgame before 3.1, so my first raid was 10-man Naxx. I can sympathize with that, at least: my guild wasn't terribly large either and this was before the LFR days, so we'd have to occasionally demand that a DPS soak up some damage during Four Horsemen or yell at every class with a heal ability to help out during Loatheb. I played feral DPS, and I remember more than once having to take the adds during Kel'Thuzad because the OT had her hands full, thanks to the fact that my build demanded I take a few damage reduction abilities. Same thing with Razorscale, Ignis (God, I loved Ulduar) and a couple of the Icecrown fights.  Despite all that, I wasn't disappointed when they gave druids 4 specs rather than three. Sure, it was sort of fun to have to switch roles now and again and play the hero of the fight, but face it: the fact that they tied feral tank and feral DPS together at the hip just hindered their primary roles at the expense of giving the spec a bit more utility that 80% of the raids didn't need. I played as a cat because I wanted to beat stuff up, not tank it."
truegaming,3dqgil,ifandbut,3,Sat Jul 18 15:30:29 2015 UTC,"The talent trees nowadays offer more specialization based on the type of encounter you are facing.  As a WW Monk, I got through about 40 tomes per clear of HFC as I'm changing my talents up every fight to add more burst AoE or Cleave or Single target sustained damage as necessary."
truegaming,3dqgil,kemitche,27,Sat Jul 18 16:12:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that >90% of the time there was always one optimal build with the pre-cata talent trees. If you were lucky there would be 2 or 5 ""dump"" points that you could put anywhere.  However, in the pre-cata talent trees you got something every level. For me, this provided that little extra motivation to keep leveling. ""Sweet, next level I get 5% more crit"" or ""Just one more level until I max Cone of Cold"".   Post-cata you only got a new talent every 15 levels. And often, at least for me, the talent choices were mostly meh for the classes I played and were just 3 slightly different ways of doing the same thing."
truegaming,3dqgil,guy_from_sweden,31,Sun Jul 19 02:26:07 2015 UTC,"However, in the pre-cata talent trees you got something every level.    Yup! People always seem to forget the leveling process when they bash on the ""old"" trees, but it made it that much more fun to level up. And it didn't matter that there was one hyper-optimal build for raiding when you were leveling.  The new choice system has the SAME problems with respect to optimization in raiding. You have, generally, an optimal talent for each tier. The only difference is now you might have to change talents on a per-boss basis - which is just annoying. You're still looking up the optimal choices, but now you have to do it every boss.  Oh, also - now you have a bunch of passives hiding in your spell book as you level, instead of clicking on them to unlock their talents. It makes it that much harder for a new person to learn their class when they aren't realizing that spell X is actually now better because of random passive Y."

I literally never felt there was an illusion of choice.   On the other hand, an issue with the wotlk (and TBC to an extent) trees was caused by Blizzard reducing the roles people had in raids. When the only job you would have as a damage class was to output maximum DPS you indirectly spawn these cookie cutter builds because fuck it - what else are you supposed to do?"

In what world did talents allow you to do something more than what role your spec was?   Hybrid DPS/healers were a fantasy created by bad players that didn't understand that they weren't actually doing anything effective, and hybrid anything with a tank was just awful.   You ""could"" deviate from a build that made sense in the same way that you ""could"" just take off pieces of gear, but that didn't mean it was a good idea. Everyone else that played the game knew that the ""creative"" players that tried to make their own specs were actually just bad and it was a nice way to easily point out who was clueless.   If you never felt that there was just an illusion of choice, then you really just had no idea how the game worked. That was the only upside to that talent system; it gave bad players hope that their bad choices were valid and it gave good players an easy filter to ignore bad players."

truegaming,3dqgil,bvanplays,2,Sat Jul 18 15:30:56 2015 UTC,"A DPS spec that does more DPS than going to the bottom of a tree is only a ""hybrid"" in the sense that something un-intuitive is actually more DPS. It's not actually mixing two of anything, just taking the mathematically best approach and applying it.   People talk about hybrids in two different ways.  There are the ""hybrids"" that were just a DPS speccing into different DPS trees because that produced more DPS than going to the bottom of one tree. These very rarely changed gameplay at all, and in most cases were just substituting one weaker ability for a stronger ability and the passive buffs that came with. I played a Rogue from Vanilla to WotLK and several times going either halfway down Assa/Combat or Combat/Sub was better than going all the way down one tree, but that was just another cookie cutter build that happened to do more DPS. There was no choice involved there and no innovative gameplay, just running all of the potential talent combinations and picking the one that did the most DPS. People didn't really screw around with these because there was no point; at best you were trading one or two abilities and some passive effects, not like you were drastically changing the class or anything.  The other ""hybrids"" that are actually combining roles (what the new talent/spec system explicitly forbids) never existed in any capacity that made sense with the single exception of Shockadins in PvP that were really just Holy Paladins that also did a lot of damage. These were people that thought they could be Holy and Shadow at the same time, or Bear and Cat spec at the same time, or like Ele and Resto. Combining roles never worked and was generally a dumb idea to even think about because it had such a long history of never working.   There was nothing innovative or game changing about the Frostfire build, it just did the most DPS. All you did was press Frostfire as your nuke instead of Fireball or Frostbolt, hardly a massive benefit to an archaic system that presented false choices everywhere."

Especially now that everyone has become relatively knowledgable and are measuring DPS and such. But I like hybrid builds. If I'm playing a single player game, I want that option still.

Hybrid DPS/healers were a fantasy created by bad players that didn't understand that they weren't actually doing anything effective, and hybrid anything with a tank was just awful.

Yes, hybrid was always worse than any one person that you could have swapped with them, but that was entirely working as intended. But   you could reasonably do one thing on ONE boss, and another on the next, you could reasonably be that tiny gap closer in one thing, while mostly doing another.

You could be a hybrid and still do things like MC and BWL because the difference between a full Feral Druid and a hybrid one wasn't much bigger than the difference between a good Mage and a bad Hunter. When you needed 40 bodies for the earliest raid content the game had, it was okay to be terribly ineffective at any one particular thing. But that wasn't hybrids being good or useful, just that nothing was difficult enough that couldn't be done as long as you had 40 bodies and the right number of tanks and healers until Naxx.   Meanwhile in BC, even High King and Gruul would slap any raid in the face that was dumb enough to bring people trying to pretend to be multiple roles. The quality of play required to raid stepped up a lot from pre-Naxx to the earliest BC raids, and there any hopes anyone had to playing hybrids in content that mattered died.   It's funny that I haven't heard the term ""min/max"" in years because these days if you don't, literally no one will take you seriously. In Vanilla that was just for the tryhard no-lifers, in BC it was something only Sunwell and BT guilds did, and in Wrath it was what 25 man guilds did. By the time Cata rolled around and the option to choose bad builds was removed, anyone that wasn't already ""min/maxing"" just wasn't even worth having in any kind of raiding guild.   Things were different when you could just bring any 40 characters to raids and get things done. That died very quickly though, and there was far more time in the game where anyone even thinking about being a hybrid was wasting their time than there was the short period where it was something some people legitimately did."

And you still clutch healed some idiot who otherwise would have died. did that heal matter HPS wise? of course it didn't. Did it let you keep your Brez for the next one to screw up? you bet.  Especially Gruul where you kept running a fair bit anyway, why not pop out and heal your mana away (well, just so you could get back into cat.  Would you have made a ""only hybrid"" raid? no, you wouldn't. But you don't know ""clutch"" until you pulled EVERY rabbit out of your druid hat in one fight, even if that wasn't planned.  Yes, most of that came into play when someone else screwed up, but not because there was one less specialist in the raid that would have needed rotating. I still very favourably remember my ""all hots and go"" tanking starts. Or the moment I was allowed to tank rag because our MT was on vacation followed by us finding out that the ""jojo bear"" didn't give to shits about knock-back.

It was what you do once you were done with that.  Sure, you could have constantly swapped members for each boss, to remove tanks you don't need.

That doesn't mean there was a choice; just that it was the group everyone was listening to that were the actual bad players.   This is what I mean; solving an equation to find the most damage answer is not choice, just doing a math problem and the person that gets it right wins.   Of course, most of the time people ""found out"" these things and never told anyone was because it was actually wrong and they had no proof aside from using anecdotal evidence of performing better than whatever baddies were on their server. It happened all of the time with isolated players that were good mechanically thinking they found ""teh s3cr3t build!"" when in reality they just played better with that than other people did with the best build and fooled themselves into thinking they did better because they knew something other people didn't and not that they were just better at pressing buttons."

truegaming,3dqgil,AngryafricanRW,2,Sat Jul 18 22:04:29 2015 UTC,"My argument wasn't ""it doesn't work"" in the first place, it's that ""this is boring, unnecessary and doesn't utilize single-player gaming to its fullest extent"". In MMO's, I understand the necessity of number talents (though frankly I don't see any reason why we couldn't bump up those numbers more for the endgame), but in a single-player RPG, it displays a lack of creativity. There are plenty of ways to make a player feel more powerful without creating entirely new abilities, animations or effects. The hit streak example was a good one, as is removing other restrictions that may have previously been in place.  But for the record, yes, half the point was also that MMO skill trees are generally unbalanced. I'm not convinced it's actually possible to make a perfectly balanced talent tree, as even the current WoW one has preferences (though it's far more nuanced than before) and it only deals in auxiliary abilities like stuns, heals and mobilities. If you upgraded that to primary abilities that the player would use in every fight, there would almost certainly be a mathematically best one."

If the pre-Cata tree was well balanced, then you could spend a lot of time planning your character's tree route to what you find more interesting.   While I do agree that a tree that just adds numbers and stats may be boring, I don't think it's a bad system at all. As long as there's lots of paths and you can't choose all of them, it works."

truegaming,3dqgil,DaHolk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:12:16 2015 UTC,"I think this brings up an interesting distinction first pointed out to me in an episode of Extra Credits. When a game gives you options, sometimes it is asking you to make a choice, but sometimes it is asking you to make a calculation.  Deciding to make your character's armor red is a choice, but picking armor that gives you fire resistance in a lava dungeon is a calculation.  Now, many options in games are a hybrid of these two concepts (you might pick a healer class because you like that play style or so it will shorten dungeon queue times), and those are probably the most interesting options you'll have, but I think the core of the issue you're highlighting here is that sometimes, when building your character, you're not picking a play style, you're solving a problem.  That problem is, of course, how do I become the most efficient at these tasks I can be, but so often the answer to that question is not how you necessarily want to play, and sometimes you have to pick between those.  I personally think developers need to focus on providing players the tools for any play style while also challenging them to calculate effective returns on that play style.  I know that's a, ""Well duh"" kind of thought, but I think this needs to be the framing of the conversation."
truegaming,3dqgil,dluminous,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:31:00 2015 UTC,That only applies to MMOs where all you care about is fitting your specialized role.

You can't do that anymore because the talents are more cookie cutter than ever, usually there is maybe one spell in the talent tree that people vary on, but the rest is just the same shit.

You could theoretically take any path you wanted, but if you didn't take certain talents that were mathematically and empirically proven to be better, you were at a demonstrable disadvantage.   I think you are missing a psychological aspect. And that is that your character is STILL made up of more variables that define him, even if a lot of them are obvious choices.  And calling it ""the MMO tree"" is ignoring that they existed before (and as with the difference between Diablo 2 and Diablo 3, people disagree with whether that is a good idea or not.)  these types of decisions have impact on players beyond their immediate gameplay effect.  ANd it is the same debate as the whole ""you are only allowed to carry 2 weapons in shooters"" paradigm. Yes, I probably don't need all those guns. Yes, mostly I will use these 2.

I played a healer from Vanilla til Cataclysm (holy priest and resto druid) and, depending on what bosses you were fighting, or who you were healing, or what your arena comp was, you certainly had some options. There were always points you had to take, but I had some pretty nutty builds that I saved for very specific situations.  Of course, that's probably still true, but there was certainly some reasonable variance among top players. The variance was usually only a few points out of, you know, 61 or whatever, but it existed."

I had three different builds that I used with regularity -- a nuke build, a DoT build, and an AoE build -- all with glyph, gear, and talent variance. So, yeah, some specific builds died in Cataclysm, but specific builds died almost every time a class had its talent tree altered."
truegaming,3dqgil,tunnel-visionary,2,Sat Jul 18 14:40:11 2015 UTC,"That is true, but the issue specifically with Cata was that Blizzard would force you to spec all the way through your tree before you could spend the few points you had left somewhere else.

But I suppose we digress now."

truegaming,3dqgil,thatdan23,9,Sat Jul 18 15:03:34 2015 UTC,"I think Cataclysm's talent tree changes is orthogonal to the issue at hand. The death of hybrid specs was brought on not by a reduction in the number of flat number increase talents but because they literally forced you into specializing by locking you into of the trees until you put 31 points or whatever the number was. Not to mention they still had flat number increases here and there.  In terms of making individual talents more interesting, I'd say it was a step in the right direction over putting 5 points into something for a 30% damage increase to a spell."
truegaming,3dqgil,ThatPelican,4,Sat Jul 18 15:08:53 2015 UTC,"That idea doesn't come from MMOs. That's the system used in D&D and most tabletop role-playing games. And those numbers do matter. CRPGs are based on such systems after all.  The way you differentiate higher level enemies from lower levels is their attributes, primarily their defense stats. All of this is math, calculated by RNG or simple dice. To be able to defeat the higher level enemies, you need higher level stats. You do this incrementally to give the player a sense of progression.  Now, some games deal with this by having the necessary increase bundled in with the character's automatic progression (e.g. levels). To give you an example, Dark Souls increases health and resistance stats a little bit each time you level up, but you still need to put points into Health if you want anything more than a glass cannon. Dark Souls and most of the games you mention don't use RNGs to calculate hits, but they do use numbers for everything else, and higher numbers means better characters.  Of course, in a well-designed game, the player is given more options than just number increases, but those number increases may open up those other options. Partly, this is a system-mastery mini-game, where the player has to decide which choices will better improve his character. It's also a way to give the player control over their character's progression and create diverse play experiences.  However, you're completely mischaracterizing the games you're describing. The stat progression is only one element of character advancement. I haven't played Witcher 3, so I'll use Dark Souls for my example, since it's the series I've spent the most time with. It's been too long since I played Skyrim anyway.  In Dark Souls, the player does level up by increasing the amount of health, endurance, faith, intelligence, strength, or dexterity (never level resistance). Increasing endurance has a huge impact on play. It affects how much attacking, sprinting, or rolling you can do before resting. Everyone needs high endurance, so you could argue it should just be bundled in, but you do see its effect on your character. Try playing a character with 40 endurance versus one with 30, and you will notice the difference. That's probably another swing with your greatsword.  Take the other stats; each one determines the amount of damage you will do with a certain attack type and allows you to use different weapons or spells. Instead of a talent tree where you click on a button and get your magic spell, you have to first collect the spell by finding or buying the scroll. Then you have to level up your intelligence to its requirement. The idea is that this process is much more rewarding than just clicking a button.  Also, if you think Dark Souls has ""painfully slow attribute bonuses,"" you must be new to the series. Every game in that series has ways of getting to high level very quickly if you know what you're doing. It's also possible to beat the game without leveling up at all. You can use the other methods of advancement, like upgrading your weapon, which is a completely different system.  From what I can tell, what you really want is for the whole process to be streamlined so you don't have to muck about with stats. So maybe this type of game just isn't for you. You brought up Far Cry 3 as an example. Personally, I don't want my RPGs to become more like FPSes; arguably they're already too much like them.  You made a better point in another comment:   There was no option in those talent trees though; there was only the illusion of choice. You could theoretically take any path you wanted, but if you didn't take certain talents that were mathematically and empirically proven to be better, you were at a demonstrable disadvantage. Thus, we had cookiecutter builds that were figured out inside of an hour after their reveal and virtually nobody would deviate from them.   Again, this is system mastery. Understand that this is not an objective flaw; many people like this type of design. To go back to Dark Souls, you should never level up Resistance. It seems like a good idea, but the other options are almost always better, and you can boost your resistances with your equipment if necessary.   Every game has good and bad choices. If you're playing a TCG, there are cards that are objectively better than others, although this is affected somewhat by your deck in general. Even if you're playing a game like Chess, where every piece has a use, you still have to make tactical decisions based on your experience.  Even to go back to a game like Diablo 2, I remember that some talents were much better than others, and I'm not talking about stat increases. In the Torchlight games, often the most important ability was the one given at the start. Most of the others weren't very effective.  To go back to the stat-increases, the player's ability to asses their effectiveness is always going to be poor. A 10% difference may not be obviously better, but on average can be a huge boon. On the other hand, it may just be a ""tax"" ability, a prerequisite for a more helpful one. These ""tax"" abilities are often necessary to balance out the ability tree, and I agree this can be disappointing. Arguably, this is poor design, but no system is going to be perfect, and sometimes this is a necessary ""band-aid"" when redesigning the entire tree just isn't practical.  So what I'm getting at is that a lot more effort goes into creating these systems than you're giving credit for. In addition, most of what you call problems are anything but for people with different preferences. Finally, all games have these features in some form or another. There's nothing to ""improve"" unless you want games where no choices are made. If you don't like games with stats, that's fine. There are plenty of games that don't have them. You're also free to play games that do have them and complain about it, but remember that games without stats also have these ""problems."" Arguably, choices in some games are more interesting than others, but again that's a matter of opinion."
truegaming,3dqgil,CheshireSwift,12,Sat Jul 18 15:13:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with most the stuff here, and I really feel that the op hasn't played dark souls. Dark souls is one of the games with the highest amount of different builds out there. While you always want a decent amount of endurance, everything else relies heavily on what sort of weapon you want to use, and practically all of them are viable in some way. You can go pure strength with a club or dragon's tooth, str dex with a loooot of weapons, almost pure dex and go for parries/backstabs, go for spells, or mix everything. Dark souls does an amazing job of having the stats support your playstyle rather than define it, and solo play it's largely a crutch to help people who would have trouble progressing in the game, hence people often doing sl1 runs. The biggest reason to get more stats is to wield a new weapon or spell rather than to get a pitiful damage increase. The damage and defense progression is almost solely based on weapons and weapons upgrades rather than levels."

Not all the talents were exciting per se, but the system as a whole was interesting:  You'd have to ask yourself 'What can I cut to get 21 points into this tree?' or run into situations where you could create true hybrids."

Some weapons have huge scaling on them and do massive damage. The game makes you earn everything and so when you finally attain these awesome weapons of power you feel like you actually accomplished something and deserve said reward. So it seems painfully slow in the beginning, but the hard work certainly pays off."

truegaming,3dqgil,s0ck,2,Sat Jul 18 14:08:44 2015 UTC,"The change in Warcraft's talent trees was deliberate, and caused a lot of concern in the player community at the time. Here's a talk from Blizzard's game designers (2011) about their goals and what they did.  Agreed that the Witcher 3 talent system is not very exciting. It's not quite as bad as you depict: putting 4-6 points in some skills does unlock an alternate mode which is like a new skill. And there's a set of 20 talents that putting one point in makes significant changes, more like Mordor. But there's a whole lot of filler points to spend too.  League of Legends is in a weird middle ground right now. Talents do provide customizations, but a lot of the community uses cookie cutter builds to get the ""best"" build for any particular champion. And most of the actual points you spend are more in the ""make the numbers better"" camp than giving interesting significant changes."
truegaming,3dqgil,sheepcat87,3,Sat Jul 18 18:03:11 2015 UTC,"You're right about League. I used to change my masteries quite a bit depending on the team comps and lane matchup, but it was always just a matter of MR vs. Armor, or Defensive stats vs. Offensive."
truegaming,3dqgil,laonious,2,Sat Jul 18 15:39:02 2015 UTC,"Personally I liked the old talent trees. I don't think Blizzard replaced them in Cata due to simple and ""boring"" they were despite what they say.  It's far more obvious Blizzard replaced them because they were too complicated, and as players had grown in level it was getting harder to balance classes around certain abilities.  An exampl would be at level 100 I would have 90 talent points, but even with additional expansions the talent trees themselves would have hardly grown at all. They would have only developed a few more tiers which would have left players with MANY more points to throw into the other talent trees. So as time went on players would be getting more talent points than places to put them within their given specialization. At level 100 you could go full Ret and have a third of your points in the Holy or Prot trees.  It would have been unsustainable from a design standpoint.  If anything I think the new system is much more benign and boring than the old system ever was; though that's really depending on the class. I think Paladin talents are super boring, rarely change gameplay, and don't add a huge amount of DPS or utility; whereas say Warrior talents are pretty powerful in comparison.  Personal Anecdote: Why cookie cutter isn't cookie cutter.  When I first started playing WoW 8 or so years ago I played a Rogue, and I was new, and terrible. My talents were all over the place, I was dying or having to eat after every mob. I couldn't pull more than one mob at a time, etc.  In the mid to late 30's I got the quests for Scarlett Monastary that both give really good ""rare"" quality swords. A friend suggest I got sword spec. I didn't know what that was, but WoW had so much depth and I loved that aspect of it so I went and researched. I didn't figure it out for myself, but I did discover it for myself. I switched to Combat Sword Spec and my whole game play changed. I was tankier, I had a burst cooldown if I got into trouble, and I stopped dying, and reduced my down time after mobs significantly.  The game became much more fun, because I felt I was getting better at it. The game was satisfying because I had ""unlocked"" a secret of the game. It made me feel clever.  Sure players may look up what smarter players did before them, but it doesn't remove the satisfaction of researching a class or a spec and then implementing that change and seeing personal improvement.  I imagine theorycrafting is a huge draw for a lot of players; even if they aren't the ones doing the math.  The new talent system doesn't let you fail, and as such it doesn't really let you succeed either.  One of my greatest complaints against the modern WoW dev team is that they have removed ""game mastery"" from all levels of play but the HIGHEST level of play.  You just can't really fail anymore other than raiding. PVP I guess, but that's a whole other issue."
truegaming,3dqgil,CutterJohn,3,Sat Jul 18 16:35:45 2015 UTC,"The problem really just boils down to this:  Advancement. At the start of most games, you can just do a basic attack. But as you advance through the early levels, you unlock spells and abilities. Like the first time you get the heal spell, or fireball. That disappears after the tenth level of a fifty level game.  That's the problem.  And the reason why that happens is because it is very difficult to balance abilities against each other. Extremely difficult. Because you know what happens in every single game that is released with a lot of skill advancement? Min-maxers come in and spread all this data around that tells you to flat out ignore a huge chunk of the game because ""this way is the most powerful, you're an idiot to play any other way"". And so you only use the five skills they tell you to use, instead of trying to learn how to master the other skills.   Min-maxers tell you how to win the game, not how to play it."
truegaming,3dqgil,laonious,2,Sat Jul 18 14:59:37 2015 UTC,"FF14 completely does away with talent trees. Since all characters can be all jobs on one character just by changing the weapon they have equipped, there's no real incentive to diversify each class over and over so that you don't get bored with it. Get bored, play another class.  It's really kind of a breathe of fresh air as you know each class has a specific optimum way of playing you can strive for, as well as like you said, never having to deal with BS number talents like +5% fire damage.  Having said that, technically those DO exist in the game, but they are passives automatically acquired as you level, you don't get a say in them so it's really no concern."
truegaming,3dqgil,retrotrinitygaming,2,Sat Jul 18 15:18:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm sick of talent trees. They are so overdone and usually unnecessary. Especially in single player games there's a bit of a catch-22: either you can fill out the tree completely so that the 'rpg' elements have only short term meaning, or you can't. And only being able to unlock some abilities makes no sense outside of a pvp context. I don't want to see better talent trees, I want to see fewer."
truegaming,3dqgil,laonious,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:21:14 2015 UTC,"I think they make sense in some instances, but are definitely overused. Witcher 3, for instance, had absolutely no need whatsoever for a talent tree, or even leveling. It doesn't fit the story or the character in the slightest.  But mainly, I dislike them because they rarely hold up to their original promise of 'Make any character you like!', because its virtually impossible to make a talent tree where every path is equivalent. This ultimately means that you either play a weak character, or you play a character you don't want to play. And it will always be a weak character, because the devs are going to balance for the best possible arrangement, not the one you chose because you thought it was fun."
truegaming,3dqgil,BisonST,2,Sat Jul 18 20:55:57 2015 UTC,"Excellent point.  If not handled with extreme care, talent trees can take the rp out of an rpg.  ""Am I a fire mage?

truegaming,3dqgil,rokkshark,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:41:55 2015 UTC,"I think you may be underestimating the value of certain numbers skills.  I think you have a point that certain upgrades have the same effect as armor and in some cases it wouldn't be noticed by the player.  But take Skyrim for instance.  A numbers skill level up in Skyrim actually does cause a noticeable effect; the issue is the enemies scale so whenever you have a chance to level up the enemies also level up.  This makes the appearance of the numbers skill less noticeable, but the effect is still there.  As far as the items issue goes...  it's not necessarily that the item equipment that does the same thing as a numbers upgrade is ignored or not noticed... it's that when it comes to equippable numbers skills (which is really what items are in the first place) there are so many other variables that sacrificing x percentage of attack or whatever is viable to increase other stats.  I think it's important, however, to ensure that numbers skills have an actual tangible immediate effect on gameplay rather than being a small boost.  Xenoblade Chronicles, despite all the new things it tried, was terrible at this.  Skill points were gained every battle but all they did was marginally upgrade the skills to yet another seemingly insignificant percentage.  Over time this had an effect however each chunk of points you spent took a long time to accrue and the effect, overall, was pretty disappointing and left a hell of a lot to be desired.  And even the equippable materia had such small stat boosts that it was useless to waste time managing.  Recently my husband and I have been playing Dungeon Hunter: Alliance.  The skill progression is similar in some ways, but in a lot of cases you can buy new skills which do some admittedly awesome new things but also you can dump skill points to raise the numbers.  Some skills that were numbers seemed all but useless, but there's a function that lets you re-spec your skill points and stat points so you can redo your character if you mess him up.  My personal thinking on the subject?  What if, upon a level up, you not only get skill points, but you get spec points, and even stat points, as well.  (Doesn't even have to be level based.)  The Skill points let you learn new skills; the Spec points let you train the skills, and the stat points control everything's base level from the background.  Of course that's a band-aid.  I would be interested in skills that levelled up on their own as you use them, thus giving you an incentive to train them."

As discussed elsewhere in this thread, being able to deviate slightly to fit your play style allowed for a much more massive assortment of plays, players, and skill sets.   I am not a fan of the now very basic talent trees. To me it makes finding meta easy and thus limits players to only play that style.

In D&D, for instance, there were a lot of straight-up statistics, like Strength, Charisma, Intelligence, etc. These meant that straight numbers would be influenced largely by those, (as in weapon damage was influenced by strength) which I found much more immersive than markedly unrelated stats and upgrades being connected.   It also meant that there could be a very clean and obvious divide between stat-related upgrades and then non-stat-related upgrades, which I at least liked.  Fallout also did this well, with the split between SPECIAL and Perks."
truegaming,3dqgil,mushpuppy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:02:51 2015 UTC,"""Why?"" Because making those is immeasurably easier than making full fledged skill tree. Also because many people become acquainted with RPG via the MMO and publishers want to cater to this new wave of gamers by offering them something similar to what they already know (or in most cynical phrasing - lure them in with something resembling game they like).  Also there's a two different ways to do ""number talents"": MMO way - ""+3% resistance to slice damage from wolves on midnight"", and more impactful way - ""+100% damage to poison"". With first one you can gain 10 levels of this skill and it barely affects your game, just giving you slightly better odds in very specific situations. Second one is more akin to traditional skills because it allows you to completely alter your play style.   That's the way it was done in the Witcher 2 with most skills. +50%/100% to ingredients harvested - suddenly doing alchemy become so less tedious. +20%/100% damage boost to oils and bombs - things that were mere secondary tools now turn into the legitimate way of eliminating enemies."

I'd read, rightly or wrongly, that its devs were trying to follow the Demon's/Dark Souls' paradigms, but those games didn't do that at all.  I think maybe to some extent it's a programming issue, as maybe it's simpler to force players into set roles (I might be wrong about this though).  Definitely in terms of game design I don't particularly like it.  In fact, even in MMOs, which I'd played long before (early days of) WOW, I'd tried always to generalize.

And it doesn't feel like you're getting better at one-handed, it feels like you're getting worse at everything else! At the beginning of the game, since everything is pretty weak, you can kill things easily with one-handed or two-handed or archery or magic, and as you put numbers perks into one of those choices, you maintain the status quo for it while the others get weaker... Pretty awful. There are a FEW fun perks that aren't numbers based, but those are typically at the very tops of the trees, and to me they serve to emphasize how boring the rest of the perks are."

I hesitate to answer 'why' because it's hard to attribute intent, but one common effect of many popular changes over the past 15 years is a game that is easier to balance.  If a characters abilities just get better upon leveling, it is easier to make the enemies more difficult by a similar amount. Encounter scaling. Ability timers. Healing after every combat. These all make for more predictable encounters and therefore the game requires less skill to balance. This frees up the budget for more important cough things like particle effects and voice acting.  Remember when creating your character meant picking race, attributes and class or skills that would set your progression arc for the entire games? Now it means picking your eyebrows."

But even if you don't like it I don't think it's fair to say they are tacked on. The multiplayer is what most people talk about but there are still quite a few people who enjoy the campaign. For the people that don't it would be nice to be able to just buy part of the game though.  I don't really think that they would get more sales if they were separate however. They might get more sales of one part over another but overall I don't think they would make more money. But that's just a guess really.

truegaming,3drd7m,rapturerocks,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:00:41 2015 UTC,"I guess one of the reasons is inertia. AAA games are still criticized if single player campaign is bad. Pretty much every Titanfall review went something like ""you have to have a proper campaign in $60 game"". I really don't agree with that point because a good multiplayer experience offers way more value than a typical 5-6 hour FPS campaign. Interestingly enough it seems that no one cares about absence of campaign in upcoming Battlefront game.  BTW, I can remember at least one game that looked like two games merged into one - Mass Effect 3 with MP component being F2P horde mode."
truegaming,3dn2lx,roussell131,26,Fri Jul 17 16:38:43 2015 UTC,"games operate as artistic and narrative experiences first, and as challenges second     But challenge is one of the factors that influences artistry and narrative as well. You cite Dark Souls, so let's run with that. A large portion of its artistry is the challenge it presents - the risk/reward gameplay, the ambiguity of statistics, hidden mechanics to uncover, etc. The game is artfully urging players to explore, try new things, etc. Punishment isn't for arbitrary reasons, it is a design tool used to make you better at the game, and it succeeds. Dark Souls' challenge also factors into the narrative, the repetition hints at the futile nature of its world, the Chosen Undead isn't only one person, but could be many. Very specifically, the game is about a prophecy that any could fulfill, if they are able enough. Completing the plot of Dark Souls requires the character/player to be of equal skill and cunning - how lame is a prophecy about a chosen undead if that person doesn't even need to be all that special?    There is room for all kinds of games - ones without failure, ones that use failure as a teaching device, ones that are punishingly difficult, ones that are outstandingly easy, ones with rich narratives, ones that don't have any interest in any kind of storytelling.     I think making games difficult by default is an obsolete concept that alienates potential new players and prevents busy adults from having the same experience as other demographics,      Making games difficult is not an exclusionary tactic, it's a targeted one. Not everything should be made accessible for anyone. There are millions of games for millions of gamers, just let people make the ones they want. You can have difficult and easy games, some games that are both, but you shouldn't recommend the elimination of one. You shouldn't tell a painter not to use blue pigment anymore, just as you shouldn't tell a game designer not to use difficulty. Maybe, instead, urge people to think more about why they are making a game difficult, because yes, sometimes it doesn't really factor in to the narrative or is detrimental to the narrative - i.e. The Last of Us is amazing, but that amazing story gets muddled when your character dies 15 times in a scene."
truegaming,3dn2lx,dogger6253,10,Fri Jul 17 17:14:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not the OP, just jumping in on your train of thought.   First quote: Honestly, you should have straight up refuted this -   games operate as artistic and narrative experiences first, and as challenges second   outright. As a statement of fact, it fails. It depends on the game. (Edit: Noticed the OP said ""for me"" in the original post here. Still, there are games for that, and there are games that aren't about that.)  Secondly, with your art metaphor. I think OP is saying something more like, there should be room in every game for some green (easy) along with the red and blue. Rather than saying ""don't use blue"", they're saying ""there's no good reason for a painting that doesn't at least offer a little green for us lovers of green, there's enough space to fit green in there and every painting will be better with some green"".   I think this is wrong. Going along with your difficulty-can-be-artistic line of reasoning, there's a place in the world for 100% shades of red-and-blue paintings (games that have no easy mode), or even 100% red-shades (always hard).  Bear in mind, I'm not disagreeing with anything you've said... More like nitpicking your metaphor for clarification. Mine, yours, OPs. :)  Difficulty isn't an obsolete concept. Games aren't factually narrative art experiences first and foremost. It varies by the game and the designer, and of course some games are artistic narratives whose difficulty is somewhat out of place. But plenty of games are a strategic or eye-hand-coordination challenge first and foremost, and a narrative, artistic experience secondarily (if at all). Some balance both well. Some of those work well at adjustable difficulty for various levels of skill and desire for challenge. Some don't.  IMO, the state of difficulty in gaming is only problematic in how it's implemented - i.e. a lot of ""difficulty"" is poorly crafted. But the balance of difficult vs. easy vs. effective-difficulty-slider games representation in the market is fine. Suggesting hard games no longer need to exist is as silly as it would be if an ultra hardcore difficulty player suggested easy games were a travesty, and all games should be made harder than the current hardest modes as 'easy' with optional much harder (super-ultra-difficult-god) modes."
truegaming,3dn2lx,Torunou,7,Fri Jul 17 17:55:56 2015 UTC,"I think to clarify my analogy, I see OPs suggestion (though OP calls for an inclusion feature for everyone) is limiting on the artist. If every painting had to have green in it, some artsits' visions would be compromised by it. There are some people who can't see blue, so to include them should no painting be allowed to feature blue for fear of some of the audience missing part of its content?"
truegaming,3dn2lx,dogger6253,4,Fri Jul 17 18:06:58 2015 UTC,"Right, I agree. Inclusiveness-as-the-rule is an exclusion of games that are exclusively about one thing!"
truegaming,3dn2lx,Torunou,3,Fri Jul 17 18:13:49 2015 UTC,"I've clarified this elsewhere, but I'm actually not arguing for it as a rule, and it's on me that so many people took it that way.   Somewhere in this growing jungle of comments I used Uncharted as an example. For some games, difficulty is simply not an element of their design goals, and can even feel like a slight betrayal of those goals. This is an even greater crime when they could have found a much larger audience (I mean, theoretically—even if they did what I wanted most people still would have no idea they existed) if they hadn't shoehorned in the challenges. It's only in those cases that there needs to be accommodation for a wider variety of player. Hard games have their place, without question, and that place should be respected.   Maybe the painting analogy /u/dogger6253 used can be useful. Let's use the traffic light coloring system, even if it is kind of mixing metaphors. I see most (AAA console) games as having yellow and red in them, with only a handful including green. Most people need green to get into it; after a few green paintings they can start to move into paintings with a wider palette, but they have to start somewhere.   Some games, many, don't need red; they're throwing it in because red and red-loving players are considered inherently better, or at least necessary, because that's just what games are. Not by everyone, but by more people than there should be. I'm fine with keeping the red, even if I do believe it's not really necessary, as long as there's some green in there, too. Paintings which are only red should stay that way; paintings which are only green should be a little more common (though there are more all the time, admittedly). I'm actually arguing against uniform design, and for diversity, in which games where difficulty truly is part of the artists' vision are preserved. I just don't think games fitting that description are as common as some people believe."
truegaming,3dn2lx,Torunou,7,Fri Jul 17 19:56:46 2015 UTC,"I think the reason people have taken it that way is because that's the way the whole situation with games design has been going, for purely money-chasing reasons, often to the detriment of the quality of games.  From a money-making perspective, a big audience trumps a connoisseur audience.  Trying to design games to be highly inclusive of large/multiple audiences, when done poorly, can turn a game that could have been good in concept into a cluster. Even in cases where it's well done, it may be at least a little bit to the detriment of the quality of the game, at least from the perspective of the connoisseur of the highly targeted-audience game (not even necessarily talking about difficulty here).  From any individual person's perspective, a loss of something they would have wanted in a game, or seeing less of the types of games they like, is a bad thing. From a broad perspective, your argument in the mouths of moneymen has already had games design sliding down a slippery slope, for at least 15 years.  In other words, people aren't just arguing your post here. The post obviously and easily hits on a large, long-lived argument in the world of gaming, and they're getting into the whole kit n' kaboodle."
truegaming,3dn2lx,Torunou,5,Fri Jul 17 20:10:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean I brought this up knowing it's a huge, divisive issue, and I wanted to see all the perspectives. So I definitely knew going in it would be a big thing. But that's fine. I like big things.  Sure, obviously all my arguments can be used for cynical, greedy purposes. But when moneymen talk about inclusion they're being insincere, and hawking products that don't actually accomplish that goal. I'm not arguing for Wii-style shovelware here; I'm talking about games like The Unfinished Swan or Flow. Even World of Warcraft, despite what people may think about it, is an enormously complex game without being difficult, and has drawn a lot of new people into gaming for that reason. And it's hardly a poorly made game. Blizzard is one of the best in the business.   As I mentioned to someone else, what seems like a loss to a lot of gamers will seem like a breath of fresh air to a lot of others, myself included. While some feel left behind, I finally feel like I'm not being ignored or condescended to. I don't mean to seem like I don't care about the feelings of the people who see this as a betrayal of their needs and values, but one side of the see-saw has to go down for the other to come up.   I think if we include areas like mobile gaming, oh yeah, the chase for more money has had a hugely negative impact on design. But in the console sphere I don't really think that's true. If anything, the artistry in games has progressed in leaps and bounds in the last few years. The publishing of a game like Gone Home hasn't prevented The Witcher 3.  Agreed, when done for the wrong reasons or without the right level of talent, designing for a broader audience can be a disaster. But overall—and again, I have to discount mobile here—I think the industry is doing a good job of side-stepping that problem."
truegaming,3dn2lx,page0rz,3,Fri Jul 17 20:40:51 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned to someone else, what seems like a loss to a lot of gamers will seem like a breath of fresh air to a lot of others, myself included.    I think this is kind of the cusp of the issue. We're talking about games as entertainment here - a perceived loss is a real loss, as much as anything can be in the subjective area of entertainment.  I think the heart of the... urgency, of the opposing perspective is, quite simply: zero tradeoff should be required, and the way you're putting it definitely sounds like a trade off to me. Make you and others like you happier with more games, but make X portion of 'hardcore' gamers less happy with those same games. It's not really necessary to take some difficulty away from games, or alter games that can't really be made less difficult without compromising their enjoyability for their most ardent fans.  I'd rather see developers err on the side off caution for the enjoyment of their existing audiences with these things. They haven't been so far, and that's an issue.  I'm not going to say they can't make games that appeal to lots of audiences, managing to satisfy the 'difficulty is annoying' crowd and 'easy is boring' crowd at the same time with clever design choices... In some cases. But in a lot of other cases, that's certainly not going to be possible without otherwise compromising a design choice to make it possible. I don't want that. I also don't want to see the number of games directly targeted to hardcores decrease further."
truegaming,3dn2lx,OccupyGravelpit,71,Fri Jul 17 20:57:45 2015 UTC,"So I'm coming from the opposite spectrum--I put every game I play at the highest difficulty it will let me, I have no interest in a game's narrative or artistic ambitions (could not care less about ""games as art"" debates, outside of mechanics), and though I have consistently less time to play games, I don't mind focusing on one at a time in order to get through them.  First, let's take this comment:   A lot of players view beating a game as a mark of skill, but let's be honest—it's frequently a mark of how much time you have, or the length of your attention span.   And? I'd be better at golf if I had time to play it, and the attention span to care. Every skill requires time and attention to foster, which makes this come off as something snide.  Moving on.   It's odd that you blanket AAA games, and then single out Dark Souls. If Dark Souls had been released 15, or even 10, years ago, it would not have the reputation it does for being so hard. Because, overall, it really isn't that hard. It only looks hard compared to how much easier every other AAA-type game has become. When it comes down to it, in 2015, you, as the player who wants an easy ride, has the glut of choices, while I, as the player who is looking for a challenge, has to search far and wide for hidden gems. Even the few AAA games that I enjoy, like the Arkham Asylum games, are consistently disappointing because of their utter lack of difficulty, even on the hard modes, and I have to constantly impose restrictions on myself to get more enjoyment out of the gameplay.  Honestly, a topic like this reads like someone who is a big fan of super hero movies complaining that there aren't enough movies he's interested in being made these days."
truegaming,3dn2lx,Chlikaflok,11,Fri Jul 17 17:05:36 2015 UTC,"I think probably the issue here is that you and I are coming from the absolute polar opposite ends of the spectrum. You are unusually into a difficult experience, and I'm unusually into an easy one. The result is that we both feel like our options are limited because games are designed for the group that lies in between.   I don't find most AAA games that easy—even the lowest setting of The Last of Us took me a while. So from my perspective, the industry does not abound with titles tailored to meet my expectations any more than it does yours. I think that probably has to do with my available time and, by extension, my patience. I simply don't want to devote so many hours to developing my facility with a game via repetition. But I certainly still want to experience the game the devs worked so hard to build. My point is that neither of our perspectives should be devalued. That's what I meant by the line you quoted above. I don't mean that games should never take your time and commitment into account; I do mean that they should not privilege that attitude over any others. The industry is still deeply entrenched in the mindset that my lack of interest in replaying portions of a game to build skill is self-evidently bad, and that those who do have that interest are entitled to more and better content.   Golf is an inherently poor analogy, because golf is a physical activity, not a medium. Its rules never change. It's a single game you play repeatedly. Every new video game title has different systems and, normally, a different story to experience. If all of video gaming were just playing Super Mario Bros. I would feel differently, but that's not how it works. So the difference between thinking of games as a skill and thinking of them as an experience doesn't apply to something like sports."
truegaming,3dn2lx,MyPunsSuck,32,Fri Jul 17 17:26:45 2015 UTC,"If all of video gaming were just playing Super Mario Bros.   But it kinda is, from my perspective. Most games are a mixture of relatively unimportant narrative beats that create a theme around the main event: the mechanics/action.  Whether that's Civ, or The Last of Us, or a MOBA, or Heavy Rain: the basic premise is the same. If you really want less game and more fiction on a fundamental level, you should look for the adventure games and visual novels that are tailored to people who share your tastes. But I don't think there's much reason to think that 'game/'story' should really be half and half, or that 'both sides' need to be treated the same. Most game players are there to be challenged, even if the challenge can sometimes be extremely forgiving and relaxed."
truegaming,3dn2lx,MyPunsSuck,7,Fri Jul 17 18:24:59 2015 UTC,"I'm mainly a gameplay player too and really, what makes a good game from that perspective is great basic mechanics, and progression. Just to show an example, let's take a newer title : rocket league. Its mechanics are solid with tight controls and a simple and clean system. It'll probably not hold my attention as long as csgo for example because it seems relatively easy to gain mastery over the mechanics, so it lacks progression."

truegaming,3dn2lx,MyPunsSuck,25,Fri Jul 17 19:30:50 2015 UTC,"Should books with difficult wording be obliged to offer an ""easy"" version for people without the vocabulary to understand the original? My point is that carefully crafted games impose challenge on the players in part as a way of getting them to play the ""right way"", and thus have the intended gameplay experience. Easy modes often allow players to slack off or play carelessly, which is in the long run much less satisfying than thriving through discipline and attention. Most works of great literature are ruined when reduced to Cole's Notes, because removing the specific choice of wording or muzzling the specific mechanical systems of a game is tantamount to removing the crust from a meat pie. Might as well just eat a pile of ground beef if you don't want the whole experience"
truegaming,3dn2lx,FallingSnowAngel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:37:48 2015 UTC,"Modes by their very definition are options. If you find playing at a more difficult mode to be more satisfying, then you should definitely play at a more difficult mode.  Other players might find a less difficult mode to be more entertaining, though.  It just seems odd when people try to dictate how other people should enjoy their media.  If someone wants an easy difficulty or if an easy difficulty is present and they want to make use of it, that's their business.   removing the specific choice of wording or muzzling the specific mechanical systems of a game is tantamount to removing the crust from a meat pie.   More like removing the onions from a burger or going for mild instead of spicy with their chili."
truegaming,3dn2lx,page0rz,0,Mon Jul 20 14:41:46 2015 UTC,"Here, I'll give an example to better illustrate what I worded poorly. I agree that everybody ought to be able to play the flavour they like; it's just that sometimes the gameplay cannot be easily modified without messing up some of the core mechanics.  Let's say a game has a wonderful set of offensive and defensive abilities to spend points in, and is ordinarily difficult enough that you need both to survive. On an easier difficulty, the player is essentially already stronger and tougher, and so doesn't need to invest in defense nearly as much. Despite fun and interesting defensive skills, the player will generally invest fully into offense - on top of the offense bonus of playing easy mode - and the game will start to fall apart at the seams.  Just by fiddling with some of the monster hp/damage numbers, the game is now paced too fast, and is bloated with useless defensive skills. My point [tl;dr] is that there's no simple fix to offering different difficulty modes, unless the devs are willing to put the effort into individually designing and playtesting each one."
truegaming,3dn2lx,page0rz,8,Tue Jul 21 05:12:56 2015 UTC,"The problem with your comparison is that you're arguing instead for the publishing industry to be limited to early comic books. Sloppy characterization, and a fetishization of repetitive violence. You're only really rewarded with the full experience if you've read enough comic books to understand the universe's mechanics.   Oh yeah, and I prefer books to challenge my understanding of the world, not reinforce it with primitive stereotypes, the way AAA games do. It's sad how it all seems to be leading to the atrophy of other cognitive functions, like social intelligence and empathy, just because some people are chasing the same highs and lows over and over again, and they're terrified of change.    difficult wording   Hey, if you enjoy that kind of decoding game, more power to you. All we're asking is that you don't pretend it's actually representing the art of writing at it's highest level."
truegaming,3dn2lx,NanoNarse,7,Sat Jul 18 00:46:12 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're an acknowledged outsider, you should be prepared for disappointment, and I'm still not seeing what you want. If most players are just fine with the way things are, why does your demand to make things even easier trump my desire for more challenge? They're both extremes, and video games are the biggest entertainment industry going right now. The trend continues toward the easy anyway.  The golf analogy works well enough, because video games do have relatively consistent gameplay ideas and mechanics. If I were good at Super Mario Bros., I could expect to be better at other platforming games than someone who wasn't. The same way a player who is experienced with one FPS can transition easily to another--which is a big reason why so many use similar controls and mechanics. Or do you think some players are just preternaturally skilled? And even if each game were its own thing, I could still take the time to learn how to play it well. Having less free time to do that in would mean it would take longer, but I could still do it, and so could anyone else, if they wanted to."
truegaming,3dn2lx,Akolyte01,17,Sat Jul 18 06:45:17 2015 UTC,"why does your demand to make things even easier trump my desire for more challenge   It absolutely doesn't. I'm actually really bothered that everyone is thinking this is the takeaway. I stressed several times that our two needs should be equally met. At no point have I said challenge should be removed to make way for ease. I specifically argued for two distinct modes of play. I even acknowledged that some games are already doing this, and that's great.   Games are only the biggest entertainment industry in terms of revenue, and that is only because of their cost—$360 or so for the first game, more than that if you want to play on PC. In terms of their cultural penetration or simple number of users they are still not there, unless you count mobile. Technically I do count mobile, but those games don't usually give people a way to engage as meaningfully as traditional games. Maybe I'm not talking about ""gaming"" generally so much as the particular type of gaming represented by console.   That's the crux of my argument here, really. Most current players are fine with the way things are; there's an enormous untapped demographic out there for whom games might be a really good experience if they weren't so hard to get into. People I show certain games to are frequently impressed by their narrative and presentation, but shy away from holding the controller themselves. I don't like having to replay sequences to beat a game, but I obviously put up with it. I'm primarily making this argument for all the non-gamers out there more than for me. Maybe in ten years, when games like Dear Esther are more common, this will cease to be an issue. But it is an issue right now, and I guess I just thought it would be interesting to discuss."
truegaming,3dn2lx,SuperKirbyFan,8,Sun Jul 19 03:31:26 2015 UTC,"I think the issue here is that, in my mind, and in the minds of many other players, the pendulum has been swinging in your direction for a while, and shows little signs of reversing any time soon.  Aside from that, and this is going to move toward the ""games as art"" nonsense that I always catch flak for, what sets video games apart, aside from interaction and challenge? Nothing, really. Every other medium is almost universally better at doing narrative or spectacle. All video games really have is their mechanics, and, personally, that's all I'm interested in getting from them. I can watch a movie or read a book for a better story, characters, and emotions. I don't need video games for that.  There are those non-mechanical games, as you said, they do exist. But if I were going to tell someone why they might want to play video games, I could not help emphasizing the game part of that. In 99% of cases, there would be no point in playing a game if there were no challenges, or worse challenges, to overcome. Even the people playing crappy mobile games are doing it to get to the next stage.  Should every game ship with a ""story mode?"" More and more of them are already, especially the ones where the devs seem to care about that story. The adventure and exploration genres continue to expand as well. I see no need to impose those ideas further than they're naturally going to go, especially when the acknowledge trend is to make things easier and more ""accessible"" across the board anyway.   I mean, we live in a world where one of the biggest devs around, Blizzard, talks about how they get their grandmothers to beta test their games, and don't want anything in there that is too tough for them to understand or beat."
truegaming,3dn2lx,TheBigBadPanda,10,Sun Jul 19 05:00:13 2015 UTC,"I think the issue here is that, in my mind, and in the minds of many other players, the pendulum has been swinging in your direction for a while, and shows little signs of reversing any time soon.   If that's the case—and I'm certainly open to the possibility that it is; as someone who doesn't desire challenge I'm probably just not tuned in to the growing lack of it—then in a way it's just as much of a problem as what I'm talking about. My whole point is not to allow one to overtake the other, and shut out the people who want whatever's not in style. Several games have well-balanced settings for the two demographics; I'm really just saying that I wish that were more common. There are outliers like Dark Souls at one end and Dear Esther at the other, and that's fine. I'm mostly just talking about the middle-ground titles.    what sets video games apart, aside from interaction and challenge? Nothing, really. Every other medium is almost universally better at doing narrative or spectacle.   Two things. One is that games are only worse at narrative because they didn't put much stock in it for so long. It's not an inherent quality. They are rapidly getting better, which is part of why it's important to me that more people be aware of them. But you're right: interaction is definitely what makes them unique (I would not say the same about challenge—there are challenging works in any medium, and challenge isn't a fundamental part of what defines the others).   But consider a game like Journey. Journey is a relatively humble, basic experience. It's very forgiving of errors, and takes very little time to get through from start to finish. But that doesn't stop its design features from surprising and impressing and—in some cases—even moving us. It has no plot, but does have some things to say. Each new sequence brings with it the discovery of how your limited abilities can be used to interact with a new environment, and these changes and interactions are up to you to figure out. It's just that figuring them out isn't hard; anyone can do it. This to me gets at what defines games: discovery, yes. Interaction, yes. But challenge? Not really. If you want challenge, though, I do think you're entitled to it; maybe Journey should have had a hardcore mode where losing all of your little tail results in a total do-over.   Someone else also made the point that this change is already in progress, that it's just a waiting game. And I think that's fair. In that case, though, I would still say that I think the current crop of gamers should see this as a good development, that it's less about the whiny casuals winning than it is about gaming being available to everyone. But that doesn't mean you guys should be denied what you get out of gaming, either. No one should be left behind here. I think what I want is for gaming's landscape to resemble that of other media: a pretty low bar of difficulty generally, but with select pieces, or select modes within otherwise accessible ones, tailored to those who are looking for a challenge. And right now I don't think we're there yet. Even most games with Story Mode, in the hands of a non-gamer, would be incomprehensible in a way that listening to a song or watching a movie wouldn't be."

Catering to both casual and hardcore demographics costs money. The hardcore demographic more so. Good, satisfying difficulty is very difficult to achieve, and there seems to be less money to be made from it than funneling those funds towards making the casual experience more memorable. And to be honest, games are like any other artform. Each product is usually better catered towards a specific demographic than trying to dilute itself appealing to everyone.  While I agree with your overall sentiment, you have to see where some of the complaints are coming from. Many of us are aware that our preferences are being sacrificed to create a more accessible gaming landscape. We've been turned away and are left searching the AA and indie scenes for developers that value us. The tides continue to move against us, and seeing someone say ""games need to be easier"" - even if it doesn't grasp your full sentiment - is going to rile up pent up frustration."
truegaming,3dn2lx,TheFuzzyUnicorn,-2,Sun Jul 19 17:56:46 2015 UTC,"Ugh, this will be a difficult point to respond to, but I'll try.    Good, satisfying difficulty is very difficult to achieve   That's exactly right. Which means that it has always been fairly rare; you've never been able to find it easily. The desire, and the ability, to make a game that accomplishes that goal hasn't gone away. It's still there, and it's still uncommon. What is being abandoned—though not quickly enough, is essentially what I'm arguing—is the rampant desire for arbitrary, artificial difficulty layered onto experiences that don't call for it. And hopefully you can agree that games that do that don't benefit you any more than they benefit me.   I think what is truly changing has less to do with actual frequency of difficulty and more to do with the attitude toward it. Developers are starting to see that difficulty (or clumsy approximations of it, anyway) doesn't have to be the default position, that fun, interesting experiences can be made without it. They're just realizing it very, very slowly. In first posting about this I think I sounded like I meant those attitudes hadn't changed at all. I don't know, maybe I even did mean that; enough people have made good points that I'm changing my position now. But it's more like I just wish they'd hurry up, because I have lots of smart, thoughtful friends that I'd like to be able to talk about video games with.   But to your point. I do understand that it can feel like this constitutes being left behind, I really do. But try to envision what it looks like to me: after decades of feeling looked down on for my tastes, I finally feel more included. And a lot of other people could be made to feel that way, too, if they were aware of the changes being made, and if those changes continued on the path they're on now. By no means do I want those changes to leave you out altogether, but again, I don't think you're truly being left out any more than you were before. The pendulum swing right now probably is favoring easier experiences, because that's what's mainly been missing before now—games' history, like I said in my first post, is rooted in brutal difficulty. But it's likely to find equilibrium sooner or later, at least relative to what it may seem like now. And if well-crafted difficulty really is hard to find, well, that's not really very different from how any other medium works, anyway."

There are very few, if any, good stories that couldn't work as well or better in another medium.   Challenge is a part of it, even if that challenge is minimal (And that challenge is fundamentally different than the challenge presented in appreciating art, or reading a book, or whatever, and I list the likes of Catch-22 and Naked Lunch amongst my favourite books, so I'm not apposed to that type of challenge, either.). Without obstables, there's no point in playing most games. Both in gameplay and narrative, they are about beating things and winning things. Even a game like Journey, though it may not be hard (and that's still subjective), it's still about figuring things out and getting through puzzles. It would be a far poorer game if it was just wandering around, with no goals.  The entire thing comes down like this for me: I would gladly play through a game with a terrible or nonexistent plot if the gameplay and mechanics were engaging. The reverse is not true.  And there are entire genres based around telling stories, like adventure games and visual novels. They've been around forever, and are only getting bigger."
truegaming,3dn2lx,boopaboopa,6,Fri Jul 17 18:38:19 2015 UTC,"One is that games are only worse at narrative because they didn't put much stock in it for so long.   Not necessarily true, I won't get into specifics (that is a topic in and of itself) but I could come up with several very compelling reasons why other mediums have inherit advantages over video games so far as their ability to craft a narrative. Neither of you can really state your positions as facts."
truegaming,3dn2lx,Cottonbuff,7,Fri Jul 17 19:47:42 2015 UTC,"I think the games industry will continue to grow out by making more games for different markets. Trying to make the games that are being made now for current markets appeal to those unexplored markets by changing parts of them is a fool's errand, IMO.  Also, for what it's worth, what I took away from your OP and other responses in the thread isn't that 'games shouldn't be difficult', but that most, or at least many more games should be made with significantly easier modes available. That the exclusion of difficulty-averse players from many titles isn't okay.  Basically my response to that is if they're difficult, those games are about difficulty, and that's fine. The games industry doesn't need to make the lion's share of all games have better downscaling difficulty-for-everyone. They need to make more games for other people.  You said elsewhere that everyone watches TV or listens to music, but not everyone plays games. But not everyone watches The Walking Dead or Breaking Bad, and I know a lot of people who can't stand it. I know a lot of people who can't handle The Pixies, or classical orchestras. But once upon a time all music was classical. The amount of classical music didn't decrease, the amount of music everywhere went up, built up around or entirely away from the 'old' styles. Which continued to go on where they could be found, in similar quantity. That's the way of these things.  Where I think you're wrong (and I've kind of already said this elsewhere, but not quite so clearly as I could, and I'm feeling talkative) is in thinking that many games wouldn't be lessened in their value in some fashion by offering easier modes for everyone. I think a great many of them would, at least for a significant portion of players. I think it's not obvious to you because you just don't value the same things that those players do in those games, and you assume that the feature of difficulty could be tweaked with options without any harm to the enjoyability of those games for those people. I think in most cases, that's either questionable thinking or outright wrong, because there's a functional, artistic connection between difficulty and the intended visceral experience of the game. It's not necessarily easy to tweak difficulty in a meaningful way that won't effect every level of difficulty adversely, because there are many kinds of difficulty."
truegaming,3dn2lx,boopaboopa,6,Fri Jul 17 20:19:27 2015 UTC,"I tried replying by quoting you and responding piece by piece, but that took too long, so my blanket response is good points all around. I particularly like the analogy of classical music; it seems to properly equate the media in ways I don't think other people have managed. Basically, I agree that expansion over reinventing the wheel is a good approach, and that probably that is what's going on right now. I don't need every title to accommodate both types of gamers as long as there's a wealth of choices out there for both; my issue is just that I don't think there is (though it's probably just a matter of time). I'm still a little disappointed that older titles will remain forever inaccessible, but that's a much more minor gripe.  As to the last point about the connection between difficulty and experience, if it's a game where difficulty truly is a fundamental part of the game's statement, I would naturally not argue for changing it. Dark Souls, to use my now perennial example, should remain untouched. I absolutely agree that it would be damaged by a downshift in difficulty, even though I am not of the type to appreciate it. What it's doing is inextricable from the challenge in playing it. So consider my argument to only apply to games where that is not the case, and those games are out there.   For example, all the Uncharted games have a pretty clear intent, which is to provide a sort of wish-fulfillment experience for the player: be Indiana Jones. You swing on ropes, you solve ancient puzzles, you run through dazzling set pieces, you watch yourself crack wise and get the girl. All of these could be accomplished without difficulty. And yet, there are these sequences in all three games, sometimes spanning several in a row, where you find yourself pitted against literally dozens of enemies, even on ""Very Easy"". Not only does this fail to aid the game in its goals, it actually works against them. Indiana Jones never had to fight off a small army with an assault rifle, nor is the ability to do so a defining trait in his character. He certainly did fight people, but often in cramped set pieces (usually moving vehicles) against no more than a handful of people, and when Uncharted replicates this experience is it amazing—but it's also not hard.  I accept without reservation your point about expanding the options, but let's say we did want a game to appeal to both me and, well, most people responding here. It doesn't have to happen all the time, but I'd guess most publishers would want it to happen sometimes. It's easier to set Uncharted's difficulty to a low baseline and raise it for a greater challenge than it is to balance it around being hard and then lower it. If those sequences against dozens of guys were effortless, that would feel weird and unearned—but then, they don't really need to be there in the first place. Better to build encounters against small numbers, and just make those enemies more powerful if that's your bag. That one-off Prince of Persia game did a pretty masterful job of one-on-one encounters, so it can certainly be done. But again, this only applies to games like Uncharted. For those games where challenge is part of the package, yeah, I agree, don't change anything."

I believe this is a big part of why not everyone is keen on the idea. Just like taking Uncharted as it is now and just cranking things down until anyone can stride through without any effort probably wouldn't make a satisfying experience, remaking Uncharted with a mind for a satisfying 'story mode' and then cranking the difficulty up would run the risk of making the game feel terrible on higher difficulties."
truegaming,3dn2lx,boopaboopa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:01:17 2015 UTC,"The golf analogy works well enough   The golf analogy is fine. Golf is a series of physical motions relating to a club and a ball. There are many different games in golf, all require learning a new set of rules for how you use the basic mechanics - Scramble, Best Ball, etc.    Video games require much less complicated motions (press A, press triangle, tilt analog stick, etc) those physical motions translate into different games with different rules for using those same motions. Also, anything takes time to learn... If you don't grow up playing golf you can still learn it, same with video games. Just because golf is typically considered a sport doesn't mean it's not also a game. In fact, I played golf most of my life and video games most of my life...I'm not too bad at video games, but I sure suck at golf!"

truegaming,3dn2lx,Intelligensaur,4,Sat Jul 18 03:46:22 2015 UTC,"games can truly become a form of entertainment everyone understands and values, in the same way that they understand music, film, or books   This is simply not true. There are many filmmakers, authors and musicians whose work is very hard to understand for the average person, and I feel that's quite alright to be honest, not because of some misplaced elitism on my part, but simply because those media, just like games, allow for sooooo much depth.  Reading is more than just identifying words on a page, watching a film is more than staring at flashing images on a screen for two hours. Or they can be. The same applies to games: they are more than button mashing. Games are a mix of storytelling and challenge, and that's what makes them compelling for people.  Arguing that ""challenge"" can be harmful to gaming trying to strip down the medium to its simplest form, like arguing the English Wikipedia should be replaced by the Simple English version so everyone will understand it. The majority of people I know play games, and only a handful of them would fit the definition of a ""gamer"" (as dumb as it sounds) in the sense of being actually immersed in the industry. They use games as a distraction, something to help them pass a few minutes while waiting for something else. They couldn't care less about achievements, or New Game+ and that's totally fine.  If you want to get someone into gaming, you need to follow their pace, see what interests them and figure out the best way to do it without them feeling overwhelmed or frustrated. You don't toss 'em into Dark Souls right away. Show them an arcade-style hack-and-slash and allow them to grasp the basic concepts. If they're into it and want more, try a more challenging game and keep going from there.  The truth is gaming is pretty big, even outside of ""real gamers"" and people who participate in discussions such as this one. Gaming is doing just fine with the general public. One of my friends has been playing Fallout Shelter for days despite never playing a Fallout game before and having no interest in doing so. I doubt boiling every game down to a movie with button prompts will get people interested in more complex gaming. There are lots of games for people who just want something to waste 10 minutes, there are lots of games for people who are interested in mastering a certain style of gameplay, unlocking secrets and replaying on higher difficulties. And there are enough games in between for people who want to get into gaming without dying a thousand times on the first level of Dark Souls."
truegaming,3dn2lx,wonderloss,5,Sat Jul 18 03:59:44 2015 UTC,"I'm not arguing for high standards of difficulty to be removed altogether; I think I was very clear on that point, even in my TL;DR. And that's mainly because I agree with you on this wholeheartedly: not every game needs to be accessible to everyone. Dark Souls is like the, I don't know, Mulholland Drive or Ulysses of games. It's targeted specifically at people who want something not so easily digestible. That's a valuable part of the gaming ecosystem, and I would never want it to be lost. But with Dark Souls, the difficulty is pretty much the whole point. Like those other works, it very explicitly only has something to say to a certain type of people. But that's not true of other games. Naughty Dog makes narrative-driven experiences that require only a minimum of difficulty to meet their goals, and yet remain unplayable for someone not deeply immersed in gaming (not so much in its exploration sequences as in its combat). What is most crucial about the experience of playing it—the story, the sense of role-playing an Indiana Jones like-figure—could be enjoyed by everyone, but isn't.  The difference between gaming and other media (and I should be clear I'm talking about traditional console- or PC-based gaming, as opposed to Facebook or mobile) is that right now the median standard of difficulty is high enough to exclude a very substantial number of people, in a way that isn't an issue in other arenas. Everybody listens to music, goes to the movies, and watches TV. It's extremely rare that someone actively avoids any of those things. But many, many people still don't play any games that aren't named Candy Crush. And the reason why this matters is because 1) games have evolved and matured by leaps and bounds in the last several years, and now have things to say that are often on par with other media, which a huge chunk of potential audience is missing, and 2) without exposure to that evolution, the general public still equates all games with Call of Duty and World of Warcraft. The overwhelming majority of my friends have no idea that something like The Last of Us exists, and they are genuinely surprised when I show it to them. The result is that if I want to discuss games as a meaningful and fascinating art form like I do with other art forms, I have very few places I can do that. In fact, this sub is probably the only place I can do that."
truegaming,3dn2lx,dogger6253,2,Sat Jul 18 11:43:42 2015 UTC,"Right, sorry for misconstruing your argument in that case, though I should say I feel this reply is clearer than your OP.   Naughty Dog makes narrative-driven experiences that require only a minimum of difficulty to meet their goals, and yet remain unplayable for someone not deeply immersed in gaming (not so much in its exploration sequences as in its combat).   I'm with you on this one. I think games in general rely too much on combat, and I find it refreshing when games like Gone Home, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter or Outlast drop combat altogether in favor of other mechanics. I can see how combat (or combat difficulty) can be, for people who don't have the skill or time/interest needed to learn the most basic combat mechanics, an obstacle to enjoy a narrative experience. On the other hand games with strong, interesting narratives are so rare, especially in the AAA side of things, that most games would simply vanish if you tune down the ""challenge"" part of the game.   Everybody listens to music, goes to the movies, and watches TV. It's extremely rare that someone actively avoids any of those things. But many, many people still don't play any games that aren't named Candy Crush.   This is the argument I don't really buy. Sure, everybody listens to music, goes to the movies and watches TV, but the overwhelming majority don't listen to Rachmaninoff or watch Bergman films. They listen to the same rehashed music, and watch Generic Comedy Film #1635 and Reality Show #3542.  Now, if I get your point, what you're arguing against is artificial difficulty in games, right? ""You have to replay the same mission fifty times because you have 20 bullets and 20 enemies coming at you, and you can't continue if you can't headshot every one of them on the first try."" Yes, that's stupid and frustrating and completely unnecessary. I can handle failing in a game just fine and try again a few times, but when it happens again and again it takes me right out of the experience.  That being said, I think many games wouldn't really benefit from the changes you suggest. Some story-driven games could do with being more accessible to ""casual"" players, but open world action RPGs for instance not so much. Take The Witcher as an example. The sheer amount of content in those games can become an obstacle for many people to enjoy them, simply because you need to spend a lot of time on it to get the full experience. You won't find many people willing to sit through a 6 or 8 hour movie or read a 3,000-page novel. The amount of time most people are willing to devote to a single experience is quite limited, and I think when it comes to games that's a bigger ""obstacle"" than difficulty.  In the end, I think the industry is going to end up in a similar place to movies. You'll find the easily digestible stuff and the stuff for dedicated fans. Many movies have extended or deleted scenes, director commentary, behind the scenes footage or tie-ins that expand on the experience, but most people don't care for that. Many games are like that nowadays. You can finish the main quest in Skyrim in a few hours if you're in it just for the story, but there's so much more to see if you spend more time and effort. It can be rewarding for both casual and ""hardcore"" players, even if ""rewarding"" means something different to each group.   The overwhelming majority of my friends have no idea that something like The Last of Us exists, and they are genuinely surprised when I show it to them. The result is that if I want to discuss games as a meaningful and fascinating art form like I do with other art forms, I have very few places I can do that.   It's pretty much the same with other art forms, if you think about it. You can discuss The Lord of the Rings to an extent with pretty much anyone, because most people know about it, but if you want meaningful discussion you'll need to go to talk with dedicated fans. I've found that trying to build someone's interest in games slowly works quite well. I recently got a friend interested in playing Alan Wake by telling her about the story and how it's influenced by Stephen King and The Twilight Zone, which she loves. Another friend, who loves fantastic literature, said she'd like to know more about The Elder Scrolls after I gave her a brief introduction to the lore, comparing it to LotR. Both friends see games as a) Candy Crush, 2) Call of Duty-style mindless shooters, or 3) Crack-with-a-keyboard-WoW. When I get the time to sit with them and actually show them the games, I'll make sure to present a welcoming, digestible experience that they can enjoy, but there has to be something else. If there's no challenge, they might as well keep reading LotR or Stephen King."
truegaming,3dn2lx,Torunou,2,Sat Jul 18 12:05:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, partly I'm being forced to clarify (rightly so) as people respond, and partly some people are making good points so I'm sure my perspective is shifting.    On the other hand games with strong, interesting narratives are so rare, especially in the AAA side of things, that most games would simply vanish if you tune down the ""challenge"" part of the game.   Yeah, but that's changing. The whole reason this is an issue for me is because the narrative is getting better across the whole industry, and I want my friends to be aware of that so they can engage with these stories and talk about them with me, like we do with books and movies.   Sure, everybody listens to music, goes to the movies and watches TV, but the overwhelming majority don't listen to Rachmaninoff or watch Bergman films.   Right, but they still listen to something or watch something. That's my point. Many, many people play no games at all, though, again, to be clear here my definition of game is being temporarily narrowed for the purposes of this argument. Candy Crush has achieved a fine level of ubiquity, but isn't a game in the sense that a Naughty Dog title is. Maybe a good way to think about this is that I'm talking about games that are meant to be discussed in some way. Current industry practices exclude a lot of people from that discussion.    That being said, I think many games wouldn't really benefit from the changes you suggest.   Sure, and there's a place for those games, as I've discussed with other people. Of all my points, this was probably the most poorly made: I don't want these changes to apply across the board, only to enough games for everyone to have a good shot at finding many titles they enjoy. Someone else suggested just making more games altogether, which is even better and also probably how it will play out.     In the end, I think the industry is going to end up in a similar place to movies.    Yeah, I agree. I don't even have any qualifying statements to accompany that agreement. I just wish fewer people would be so disappointed about it, as though we're letting in interlopers. Not that you are, necessarily; that just seems to be a common sentiment.    You can discuss The Lord of the Rings to an extent with pretty much anyone, because most people know about it, but if you want meaningful discussion you'll need to go to talk with dedicated fans.   Not sure this is quite the same idea. It's not that I need everybody to love Final Fantasy VII as much as I do—that would be a tall order!—but I need there to be some common ground. Nearly everyone has a movie they loved and would enjoy talking about. Or an album, or a book, or a show. Not so with games. Not once, for instance, have I ever been in a relationship with a woman who plays games. So that's a big part of my life that can never be shared. She might have interests I don't share, too, but I am capable of at least, say, going to a single opera and experiencing it for myself in order to offer her some limited outlet for talking about that thing she loves. As long as games embrace difficulty in the way they have in the past, I can't do the same—though, as many people have said, including you, that's likely to change soon enough."
truegaming,3dn2lx,Intelligensaur,4,Sun Jul 19 12:42:54 2015 UTC,"some people are making good points so I'm sure my perspective is shifting   Yes, reading peoples thoughts here is shifting mine as well. I believe most games on an ""easy"" difficulty are easy enough for people to get into if they're so inclined, but now I'm starting to question that.  I think this is going to be a challenge for the industry as a whole going forward, making games more accessible to ""casual"" gamers and still interesting and challenging for experienced gamers. It's a difficult balance to achieve, but it can be done and, overall, I think we're moving in the right direction.   I just wish fewer people would be so disappointed about it, as though we're letting in interlopers. Not that you are, necessarily; that just seems to be a common sentiment.   I don't quite understand the mindset of people who are angry or disappointed with that. Maybe it has something to do with the mainstream concept of gamers as awkward, fat, lazy geeks who waste their life playing with virtual toys. Welcoming those ""outsiders"" into our highly-criticized hobby could be taken the wrong way by some, but I can't see how more interest in gaming would be bad. A bigger audience means more and better games for everyone. Sure, some studios will drastically change their focus to more casual experiences, but for every Konami leaving PC/console games, there's an inXile working on a new Wasteland or The Bard's Tale.   Nearly everyone has a movie they loved and would enjoy talking about. Or an album, or a book, or a show. Not so with games. Not once, for instance, have I ever been in a relationship with a woman who plays games. So that's a big part of my life that can never be shared.   I completely agree there. I was in a relationship with a girl who is every bit into games as I am, but it's far from the norm. I'm also into pro wrestling, and I've never been with someone who enjoys it (nor have any friends who do, really), and it's hard not having people to share those interests with. But games will get there eventually. Consoles are bigger than ever, and lots of people are being exposed to games other than mobile/Facebook stuff for the first time. It's only a matter of time and them finding the right games, and maybe some friendly guidance to show them how awesome this medium can be."

While that's mostly true now it certainly wasn't always that way. When those were young mediums people that didn't grow up with them didn't really consume them. The old generation never understands the new generation. 50 years from today, I don't think you'll have as many people outside of gaming just because they didn't grow up with it. If difficulty was a barrier for entry you wouldn't have kids getting into it because they wouldn't have the experience needed to understand these complicated systems..."
truegaming,3dn2lx,MormonPartyboat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:12:04 2015 UTC,"While that's mostly true now it certainly wasn't always that way.   That's true. I'll totally concede that point. I mean other media took a while to catch on for different reasons; film took a while to be taken seriously as an art form, for example. It wasn't that it was just too hard or confusing. But those differences probably aren't enough to make games fundamentally different in this way. So okay, I can agree that it's probably just a matter of time, waiting out the generations who didn't grow up with it. The only thing that complicates that idea is that even in my generation, which did grow up with games (I'm 31), I know many many more non-gamers than gamers. And these are people with the capacity to really appreciate games if they ever had the proper chance, i.e. if they could pick up a controller and not feel instantly overwhelmed.    I think difficulty is one tool used to encourage discovery and experimentation, what I view as the design point.   I think it's the other way around. Mechanics in Dark Souls aren't that hard to understand in theory; their appeal is in how hard they are in practice, and ultimately in the satisfaction that comes from perfectly pulling off something as a result of that practice. Yes, there's discovery and experimentation, but generally you'll figure out what the game expects you to do long before you can do it. Actually executing on your plan takes multiple attempts, multiple deaths. Unlike many really hard games, Dark Souls is famous for being a balanced experience, but it's balanced around the idea of doing it again and again, like playing scales or shooting hoops. By the end, once it's been mastered, the player will feel as though the route from novice to veteran was as simple as comprehending this or that tactic, but the process was really a lot messier than that."

I had no idea what stats did, how to upgrade stuff, etc. Every significant encounter with enemies or traps in that game also taught me a skill or tactic that I could use later as well. It wasn't just banging my head over and over again until I got it, it was thinking about why I failed and then trying a different approach. Sure, sometimes (Capra Demon) I had figured out what to do and was just failing because I wasn't executing fast enough, but that was the outlier in the game. That slow, methodical nature made the transition to Bloodborne difficult, but once the game taught me to be aggressive and always moving things steam-rolled until I eventually had that mastered as well. I dunno, for me it's certainly not the difficulty I chase, I tend to play story-driven games on their easiest setting, and I didn't feel like Dark Souls was about being difficult at all, though it certainly has been marketed that way!"

The last thing I need when gaming is to be forced to endure the same five minutes a dozen times in the one or two hours I can spare in a work week.  ""Easy"" (or the dreaded ""Casual"") as a setting implies that you're too lazy or unskilled to play the real game, an attitude that is both reductive and a little condescending.   It sounds like ""casual"" describes your relationship with games pretty accurately. An hour or two a week of any hobby would be a pretty casual hobby. There doesn't need to be anything condescending about it, it's just an observation."
truegaming,3dn2lx,Decap,3,Fri Jul 17 19:37:59 2015 UTC,"Games aren't made with the intent of pleasing everyone. There are millions of gamers in the world, all with their own tastes, and making a game for everyone is a fool's errand.  The fact that we get such a huge variety of games nowadays, from Dear Esther and Journey to Dark Souls, is wonderful. Is it really necessary to fall into the 'grass is always greener' attitude and long for the games that don't suit us to be changed, when we could be playing the multitude of stuff that already has us in mind?"
truegaming,3dn2lx,Decap,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:11:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The idea that all AAA games should have a Story Mode would be as ludicrous as a call for Dear Esther or Gone Home to have combat added for those who find them too easy. Gamers should find the games that are right for them, and stay away from the ones that are not."
truegaming,3dn2lx,Decap,7,Fri Jul 17 18:00:01 2015 UTC,"I don't get why people think this industry is too small for the variety we have. There is no shortage of easy or difficult games out there...

truegaming,3dn2lx,AdricGod,5,Fri Jul 17 18:18:52 2015 UTC,"for me, games operate as artistic and narrative experiences first, and as challenges second (or fourth or fifth, really). Unfortunately, the industry still widely indulges in a preference for one approach over the other.    I'm jumping in here. I think the quote above is kind of the point that catches, for me. I've also read your responses to others in the thread up to now, and I think I understand what your thoughts are pretty well.  There's a good reason for these preferences to be a focus. Lack of focus on one over the other can create a highly ""diluted"" experience. It's very hard to make a good game that can be challenge-focused for one person and narrative focused for someone else. And sometimes, we, the player, don't understand consciously what the game designers are doing, we only experience it viscerally.  For instance, The Last of Us.  I honestly believe the difficulty in this game was part of the narrative experience. Not that it was incredibly difficult, but what made it feel that way were the occasional catching points, where you basically had to fail at least once to understand what it would take to succeed. These would happen that way regardless of the difficulty you played the game on.  I think this is a point being made, an artistic, narrative point, via the difficulty. I think the omnipresent danger that they're in wouldn't be as real or visceral if these 'difficult' (and 'surprise!') combat scenarios didn't pop up occasionally. I think that's why it was done how it was, and that was the designer's vision. It's an ongoing theme in the entire sub-genre (zombie (-ish) explore-and-survive action games). Difficulty can and in this case is being used as a tool to increase the impact."
truegaming,3dn2lx,PDK01,5,Fri Jul 17 18:27:57 2015 UTC,"That's definitely a huge part of it. A game mode that the player can just steamroll through isn't going to feel anything like the game was intended to.   A horror game where enormous, terrifying beasts hit you with less force than a wet noodle, an FPS where the NPCs just came out of the stormtrooper academy, a puzzle game that stops the countdown at three seconds so you can keep going, and a platformer that just plops you onto the other side of a jump if you fall short are all still games, but they're not the same game that the dev originally made anymore.  And while sometimes it might be possible to give people that watered-down experience by toggling a few switches in the back end, other times they could involve more considerations that would take effort away from making the original game, potentially giving everyone a worse experience."
truegaming,3dn2lx,ImHidingInYourPants,6,Sat Jul 18 05:38:33 2015 UTC,"More egregious, perhaps, are the instances of a ""hard mode"" in games. Often it's just a matter of doubling the hp and damage of all monsters, (or lowering the amount of xp they give) and that's it. This is especially horrid when you're already at a point where you can't afford to take any damage ever (making a lot of mechanics fall apart and/or turn into a total lottery) If you already can't take any hits, doubling enemy damage does nothing in the first place. Doubling enemy health then serves no purpose except to make the game more grindy  From what I've seen, a somewhat broken easy mode to a well-balanced game is a whole lot more palatable than a 'hard' mode to an otherwise easy game"
truegaming,3dn2lx,Akolyte01,5,Fri Jul 17 20:20:27 2015 UTC,"I personally have no use for difficulty in games. I set every game to its easiest setting by default. I understand and respect the tastes of players who set it higher, but for me, games operate as artistic and narrative experiences first, and as challenges second (or fourth or fifth, really). Unfortunately, the industry still widely indulges in a preference for one approach over the other.    I think you need to take a step back and examine from an artistic viewpoint what a game is and what it does in terms of its interaction with the player.  Think of it this way - a game is a dialogue between your chosen actions and the game's determined response set.  Difficutly ensures a rigorous approach to that game's response set - in a hard game, you have to play well.  The artistic side of things comes from the vibe of that conversation.  A 'game' where you have to memorize 100 digit strings of random numbers is certainly challenging, but empty.  A game with multilayered simulation elements that allow you to interact with the world along several axes may offer complex difficulty and a deep joy in navigating the decision space.  Take a game like Bioshock Infinite - if you play at the easiest difficulty, you experience the story and the rough idea the creative intent was working towards, but that's about it.  You have a shallow dialogue, so your involvement with that game's systems is minimal and your takeaway from the experience is largely narrative or visual.  However, if you play the game at the hardest difficulty levels, many flaws with the gameplay become very strongly highlighted (bullet soaking nature of enemies, the idiotic weapon upgrades system, the poor fight design, the bland enemies).  You have had a deep, meaningful dialogue with the game and discovered it is wanting.  Only when you engage a video game's systems at every level like can you really appreciate and experience the entire artistic vision that went into creating a video game.  If you don't engage those systems, you're losing an entire channel of artistic expression, and your experience is like watching a movie without sound, or looking at a painting with color deadening glasses.  That's not to say that many of your complaints are invalid - they certainly are (edit: certainly are valid, that is).  But they are driven by difficulty inserted for stupid reasons (like the 100 digit memorization 'game') rather than artistic reasons.  Milking artificial difficulty to extend game length is tied with deriving difficulty in dull ways for being the most pestilent design decision in gaming today.  And many people certainly do not care about the artistic value of video games and only want to consume them like a book or movie.  Which is fine, I guess, though it does obviate the purpose of games as a distinct form in the first place."
truegaming,3dn2lx,MyPunsSuck,2,Fri Jul 17 16:49:59 2015 UTC,"But difficulty continues to be a highly valued facet of the gaming experience, decades after either of those ceased to be an issue.   Challenge is in inherent part of what makes a video game a game. If everything was done for you, can you consider it a game any longer? Sure you can in the broadest sense, but then what's the point? Aside from significant interaction from the player, a video game must also contain some degree of difficulty otherwise everything you can find in a video game is infinitely better in other mediums. Story? Well you have books for that. Don't like reading? There's movies. Take Journey for example. If there were no puzzles in the game, you could easily say that a movie could achieve what the game was attempting to do much more effectively."
truegaming,3dn2lx,stoutcarrot,4,Fri Jul 17 17:47:16 2015 UTC,"That's how I view this issue, more or less. If someone doesn't want a challenge, go read a book or watch a movie. You don't see me complaining that I can't control any characters in a movie or that a book has too many words."
truegaming,3dn2lx,TheFuzzyUnicorn,7,Fri Jul 17 17:55:27 2015 UTC,I just wanted to comment in saying that a challenging game can turn me off immediately if their idea of a challenge is to turn enemies into bullet sponges.

So many people here are equating challenge with mastery, and those are just not the same thing. Figuring out how something works, practicing it, exploring its nuances, and seeing your efforts rewarded—all of those things can happen without a hundred Game Over screens. Many, many games have proven that you can have one without the other, although most of them are still coming out of the indie scene."

As you said many games alienate those that play them, much like a elementary student taking college level courses. They don't just jump right there, there's a whole evolution and process of gaming before you jump into Dark Souls, you don't pick it up as your first game and enjoy it...   Story mode is the lowest common denominator, and any game that wants to appeal to the largest consumer base possible SHOULD include a story. I'm actually curious as to which more recent AAA titles have not included a story, as traditionally those games are big budget and HAVE to reach the most people possible in order to see a profit, so story is very big for them.  There is plenty of room for varying opinion on difficulty and challenge, but I think calling the concept of challenge in games obsolete is a bit far reaching. Games were built on challenge, from Go to Solitaire to sports to video games."

truegaming,3dn2lx,Stop-Hanging-Djs,3,Fri Jul 17 20:40:08 2015 UTC,"I'm going to disagree with your premise here. Challenge is not an impediment to gaming becoming popular with people who've never tried games, in fact I'd say it's important to it. Look at two of the most popular mobile games, Candy Crush and Angry Birds. We think of them as casual games, but they're pretty tough in their own way. Once the difficulty ramps up you'll be playing levels over and over to beat them trying to get and use special items the most efficiently or memorizing the best angles of attack. Candy Crush specifically is designed to be hard to get you to buy more lives to keep playing. It's bullshit hard at points and casual gamers don't care. I've seen parents and grandparents get really sucked into them. The fact that people are genuinely challenged by these games is what keeps them coming back.  I get that it's your thing, but most people don't play games for narrative and making narrative easy to access isn't going to make gaming more popular. Compelling mechanics that offer a challenge to overcome get people into gaming. The most popular books and movies offer mindless entertainment and the most popular games are about the mechanics.  What really keeps people away from gaming is the time and money investment of accessing a game. The average person isn't going to buy a $300 console and a $60 game just to give gaming a chance. Plus there's the challenge of learning how to use a controller or keyboard/mouse. It seems natural to me, but I have decades of slowly building my skills from when I was a kid. Even if you make a game like Assassin's Creed as easy as possible someone who has never played a console game will have to learn the concept of using a controller to navigate an avatar in a 3D space. It's not intuitive at all. What is intuitive is swiping a piece of candy to make a match.  Like it or not people are more likely to get into gaming and accept it by playing a game on the smart phone they already have and they're going to try a simple mechanic based game that's easy to control (Candy Crush and Angry Birds are simple point and swipe games) and as they've already shown by making challenging games the most popular they do want something that will challenge them and force them to master a skill."
truegaming,3dn2lx,Anon_Amous,2,Fri Jul 17 20:44:30 2015 UTC,"How are you supposed to connect with a character that is supposedly thrust into a challenging situation, when the only time they actually face any challenge is through scripted events?   Challenge synchronizes the experiences of the player and the player character, so when you surmount an obstacle you aren't just controlling a badass, you are a badass."
truegaming,3dn2lx,Reinhardt_HS,2,Fri Jul 17 20:53:58 2015 UTC,"If there is no reasonable danger of a win or loss state, then it literally is not a game.    the concept privileges certain types of gamers    This is utterly the wrong way to think about challenge. The whole point is to take a player who sucks at the game, and throughout the length of their interaction, improve their skills until they can succeed. It isn't supposed to be like standardized education, where the player is tested and tested without ever learning anything - the player is meant to grow and improve to meet the new heights that come with mastering the system.  We can all agree that arbitrary modes of determining win/loss are detrimental (For example, luck-based missions, utterly unintuitive mechanics, or pure trial-and-error), but there ought to be resistance against the player's efforts, or there would be no satisfaction in victory. The player has ideally become that little bit smarter or faster or wiser having played the game, and that game-over screen is a badge of distinction to show for it.  As an aside:    unless a game is designed with remarkable precision and care, as with Dark Souls    Ugh no, the difficulty in DS was terribly designed; especially the balance between different styles of fighting. It prizes experience over skill, rewards trial-and-error to the exclusion of careful consideration, and many of the challenges are commonly overcome by finding a way to break the intended system. They made a great combat system and a fantastic world to play in, but there's no way the difficulty was designed with precision and care."
truegaming,3dn2lx,ravenmeister,2,Fri Jul 17 20:58:56 2015 UTC,Not every game is meant to be an immersive cakewalk like TLOU. There's an immense satisfaction that comes with beating NES/Genesis platformers and your personal opinion / lack of skill doesn't change that fact.
truegaming,3dn2lx,Dronelisk,2,Fri Jul 17 21:07:18 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to add that the only thing that makes a game a game is some sort of challenge and the ability for the participant(s) to interact with the game. Anything else people attribute to a game (such as difficulty of said challenge) in no way has any bearing on whether or not it is a video game.   So far as #3 on your edit, I have never heard anyone conflate mastery and challenge. Challenge* is simply some sort of obstacle one must overcome to achieve a goal, and mastery is reaching a certain level of competence in some skill.   *Obviously in English Challenge has different meanings depending on the context, but none of them are relevant except perhaps the one(s) that refer to a contest of some sort, which is really just a macro version of the definition I gave."
truegaming,3dn2lx,Twinge,2,Fri Jul 17 19:24:50 2015 UTC,"but for me, games operate as artistic and narrative experiences first, and as challenges second (or fourth or fifth, really)   Yeah you're kind of painting difficulty as tangential to a video game's appeal here and it may be so for you. But I'm going to guess that it isn't for most people, that mechanic mastery (basically challenge) is the reason most people even play video games.   There's nothing wrong with 'content tourist' type games like Journey either, but I'm not sure what you're arguing for here, those games are already being made. Now more than ever.    But games, at their most fundamental level, are about learning a system, experimenting, connecting the dots. This process doesn't need to be hard to be satisfying   In a game that emphasizes this type of process, there has to be some amount of difficulty in there to get you to engage fully with all its systems. Puzzle games are meant to get more and more difficult with each level. There wouldn't exactly be a learning process if I could beat all the puzzles without thinking about the mechanics."
truegaming,3dn2lx,thomasjthomasj,5,Fri Jul 17 21:19:17 2015 UTC,"I love a challenging game. I played through Far Cry 1 on Hard recently, and while the writing is a clusterfuck (especially later in the game) the action was tight and the challenge interesting enough that pushing through it was fun. I would have put the game down after an hour if i could just breeze through the gampley elements, but since the game forced me to use all avaialble resources and scramble for every win (in a way i found enjoyable) it held my attention. Since i enjoyed the gameplay it was easy to accept the story as a pulp-y red herring for the sake of gameplay and actually enjoy it somewhat as well.  Also, from a narrative standpoint, some games need to be dfficult to sell the narrative. Dark Souls, for example, would be a completely different narrative experience if the gameplay was easy. The same thing goes for System Shock 2 or Bioshock or Far Cry or X-Com; Making the gameplay easier would trivialize the core premise of those games. The recent announcement of what is the canon ending of X-Com: Enemy Unknown is a prime example of this.  If a game is ""too easy"" and is obviously holding my hand i will often put it down, it almost feels like an insult, like the game/designers is underestimating me.  Im working towards a career in game design and have just finished a 3-year college education in the field, so i might be a bit biased. I find it very easy to pick up on design choices which were obviously made for fear of scaring the player away with challenge."
truegaming,3dn2lx,AtlasShruggedTwice,3,Sat Jul 18 07:15:36 2015 UTC,"I have started and deleted several drafts to put my thoughts about this issue into words. Each time my reply gets super long winded and doesn't say what I really want. But every time the TL;DR is the same. So I decided to just expound upon that a bit. So I'll start with the TL;DR.  TL;DR: The reason why most games default to a challenge and then have a single easier setting and multiple harder settings is because the vast majority of games are a competition. And when you compete against a vastly inferior opponent, you might as well not compete at all.  Sometimes this competition is overt. If you're playing CSGO or Madden against real people, you're obviously competing. If you're playing Chess on your computer against an AI, you're obviously competing. In these situations, having an opponent who is dramatically inferior to you defeats the purpose of having an opponent at all. If the AI you're playing against in that game of Chess barely knows the basic rules, any slightly competent player is going to destroy them 100% of the time. You might as well not play the game at all and instead just tip their King over at the beginning of the game and call it a day.   Other times the competition is less obvious. All those genres/games we think of as generally single player experiences? Adventure games, Action games, single-player RPGs, FPSes, and Strategy titles? Etc etc etc? Their  still a competition. You're just doing it in a more ambiguous fashion. There computer isn't playing by the same rules as you are (like it would be if you played an AI at chess), but it still follows rules. It is still opposing your victory. Therefore, challenge is still just as important.   If you're the sort of player who doesn't want a challenge, what real difference is there between playing the game against a cardboard enemy and watching someone play the game in a Let's Play? The answer is ""Almost none."" Yeah, you might choose X in an RPG when the Let's Player chooses Y. Or you might move your soldier to this tile instead of that one in a turn-based strategy game. But the results are going to be similar almost all of the time. A game like Gone Home, with a basically non-existent default challenge, is a great example of this. There is almost no difference between playing the game yourself and watching someone else silently play the game.  I will agree that locking away parts of the game behind difficulty is a bad idea. But not because difficulty shouldn't be rewarded. If I have paid 60 bucks and you've played 60 bucks, I shouldn't get 80% of the game just because I want to play it on Easy. A good example of a company doing it right and a company doing it wrong is Wildstar vs World of Warcraft.  Both games have very challenging end-game content. Wildstar locks theirs away behind a massive grind for attunement (grindy challenge) and then requires large groups of players to coordinate perfectly to beat it's ridiculously challenging raid encounters (skill challenge). WoW, on the other hand, has challenging raid encounters too (and for all those WoW-haters out there, data is showing that Mythic WoD raiding is, by far, the hardest raiding ever). But the grindy part is gone, and there's an ""Easy"" version of all the raids, in the form of Raid Finder, for those who aren't interested in a challenge and just want to see all the content in the new xpac.  But very few games go the Wildstar route anymore. It's not profitable to make games that lock away content behind really challenging gameplay. Games are, by far, easier than they've ever been. And more ""non-difficult"" games, like Gone Home, are released than ever before. In other words, what OP wants is already here. He's complaining about something that doesn't happen, chiding devs for things they don't do, and demanding features that are already present.  And that's too bad too. Because there are a lot of people who think like OP. And game devs keep making games easier and easier. New Mario Wii allows you to let the AI beat levels you can't. Order 1866 is basically a QTE, Push-Button-To-Win simulator. Basically every AAA game released in the last 5 years has had unlimited saves/reload/continue features. And the reason that Dark Souls is talked so much about is because it's basically the only truly unforgiving major release in years.  I think the issue here is that OP has a very skewed perception about game difficulty. I'm struggling to think of a single game that locked content behind difficulty recently that isn't made by FromSoftware. Again, with the exception of FromSoftware's games, I can't think of a single game that didn't have a ""So Easy You Could Be a 5 Year Old and Still Beat This Game"" difficulty setting. So yeah. I'm not sure what more OP wants...Maybe I'm just missing something fundamental to his argument?"
truegaming,3dn2lx,utzbas,2,Fri Jul 17 22:29:53 2015 UTC,"I'm both challenge-oriented and story-driven. I always plays games on the highest difficulty, and my current favourite game is Life is Strange, which features absolutely no mechanical challenge.  I believe games shouldn't compromise with the difficulty the way they do nowadays. They should be straight-up advertised as difficult or not difficult; the difficulty slider is now irrelevant for the most part, as the highest difficulty is almost always a cakewalk for people looking for a challenge, and everything between ""easy"" and ""hard"" is useless baggage.   If you're introducing a difficulty slider of sorts, you're trying to make two games with the same material, aimed at two vastly different audiences - and chances are, you will fail both, even players who fit both profiles."
truegaming,3dn2lx,TheBigBadPanda,2,Fri Jul 17 19:26:36 2015 UTC,"I'm with you in that I don't care for difficulty either, I just don't have time in my life to concentrate on a game like that.   However, I still stick to ""normal"" difficulty, as I assume most of the developer's balance tuning has been oriented around this difficulty mode. Thus, I'd be able to get the purest perspective on the developer's vision for how this game should feel. Too often I find that the easy mode difficulty breaks too many mechanics in the game and it changes the atmosphere of the game. Last of Us for example, definitely suffers if you turn the difficulty down, since the act of scavenging for resources is not just a balance issue, but also a part of the game's atmosphere.  Thankfully, most games make ""normal"" mode something where you won't have to restart too many times to progress. If the game has accumulated a reputation as an innately ""hard"" game, then those are the games where I'll turn down the difficulty so that I won't be turned off from playing the game entirely."
truegaming,3dn2lx,Stop-Hanging-Djs,2,Fri Jul 17 23:02:28 2015 UTC,"I generally agree with your sentiment. I think a good example of a game that did this well was Mass Effect 3, which included a new difficulty setting for the series, ""Narrative"". On Narrative, you have to try pretty hard to get killed—at least for the first half of the game—but there are still some parts towards the end that you couldn't completely phone in. Since this is a series that warrants multiple playthroughs, I started on Narrative because, honestly, I played that series for the stories and the characters, and I didn't want to have difficulty being a barrier.   I didn't realize how tuned down the Narrative setting was until a much later playthrough, but I can say that the lack of difficulty on my first playthrough did not make it any less enjoyable or exciting because it still provided an experience where it felt as there were situations where there was a real threat, danger, and urgency.   In subsequent playthroughs, I would increase the difficulty and ultimately played the full game (DLC included) on Insanity, start to finish. I would have been far more frustrated with that experience on my first playthrough.   Anyways, one series I've loved—the first video game that really fell in love with because if its narrative and story—is Metal Gear Solid. I feel in love with it on the PS1, but fell away from the series with the PS3-exclusive MGS4. I tried MGS:GZ but I have to admit, the lack of an Easy difficulty setting has made it tougher for me to really complete it. As you, I have limited free time for gaming and it is hard for me to justify myself spending a great deal of time on a game where I have to replay from the last checkpoint/auto-save when I screw up, which can admittedly happen pretty frequently. Even the ability to choose my own save points would have been a huge help, as I would be far more forgiving about replaying a couple minutes vs. 10 or 15 minutes because there was a soldier on patrol that I didn't spot, ran around a corner too quickly and ended up with the entire base on my ass.   I think MGS is such a story-heavy series—and it's a very huge part of what I've always enjoyed about the games—that I don't think it's fair to say it is a game that relies on difficulty as a core element of the gameplay... I know that it is for a lot of people, if not most, and I certainly wouldn't want the entire experience's difficulty to be diminished. Certainly a Narrative-esque difficulty setting—one that didn't give you a mission rating at the end, or count towards the game's completion percent—would not take away from those who play it largely for the tactical challenge, would it?    I just wish there was an easier (or at least a more forgiving) way to play the game to experience it. Watching a YouTube video of a playthrough is too passive of an experience—you don't feel invested the way you do when you're playing it, yourself—and it is nowhere near as enjoyable to me.   I wish I could say that someday I will have enough free time to really be able to sit down and invest into MGS:GZ and finish it... but I know that, at this stage of my life, that is becoming increasingly unlikely.   In the end, I can certainly relate to your point and would agree with you on principle. I'm late to this discussion, but many people (on both sides of the issue) have made good points... so I don't know if it's something that's even realistic or plausible. It seems that allowing games to be more accessible would alienate a large portion of gamers... so I question is there is really a correct answer to this.   Either way, this discussion has given me quite a lot of new points to consider in the subject."
truegaming,3dlmgp,Sencat,139,Fri Jul 17 07:08:42 2015 UTC,"Achievements are optional though. There are bad achievements, sure, but there isn't much point in trying to control them. Especially as some rules would mess up some games.  For example, why force a game to include respecs just so people can get optional achievements? It could easily mess up the balance and/or story of a game.   Why remove the random achievement from the Stanley Parable when it fits the game so well? I'm pretty sure the point of that achievement was just to mess with people who obsess over achievements.   Personally I hate grinding achievements but all that means is that I usually don't bother."
truegaming,3dlmgp,ToastedFishSandwich,-4,Fri Jul 17 08:40:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess a few of these would screw some games up. This is my opinion on games and genres that I play. I didn't really think about other games.  My thought on respecs is that if you've focused on one or two trees, you have quite a bit invested in the materials and items related to boosting those skills. For example in say, Witcher 3, I have a sword heavy playstyle. I use armor and enhancements that increase bleeding, poison, and burning chance. If I respec and decide to go full on magic playstyle, suddenly, I need to buy/grind for items and equipment that help increase magic intensity and duration. Yes the combat augments will be helpful, but I won't be using them often enough to fully quantify having them instead of magic upgrades. This would cause you to have to sell everything, and lose money (if the game makes shops buy things for less than what they sell them for), and have to buy a new set of armor and augments. Or you can try lugging around equipment for every class and have to manage your inventory very carefully. This may be a bit jaded from my perspective because in Witcher 3, the enhancements you put on armor are permanent and you have a fairly limited carry weight.  I understand what you're saying about the Random Achievement, and you're right. At least there is a way to get it if you go into the game files and you're really desperate.  Thanks for another perspective!"
truegaming,3dlmgp,th3guys2,53,Fri Jul 17 09:20:32 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying about the Random Achievement, and you're right. At least there is a way to get it if you go into the game files and you're really desperate.   Its this kind of mindset that a lot of people just don't understand about completionists and people who care way too much about achievements.  I mean, just step back for a second. You basically said ""I am really desperate to get that virtual icon, and it looks like I can satisfy this overwhelming desire by going through the game files and modifying the game experience just to get an achievement"".  You really have to understand, that this is obsession over virtual points, and not obsession with the game. Achievements are not designed for completionists to just get 100% for doing a bunch of trivial tasks. They are designed to give challenge and validation to players who are obsessed with the game.  This is a bit longer/more directed than I intended, but I was really trying to help you reset your perspective, because I don't quite think you understand how warped your perspective is. This was made obvious with your Stanley Parable comment: the whole game is a commentary on both gamers and games, and you missed it because you were obsessed about the achievements rather than experiencing the actual game, which was trying to make you understand how arbitrary achievements are."
truegaming,3dlmgp,whatamidoing11,-2,Fri Jul 17 13:21:28 2015 UTC,"How can you tell people that enjoying the metagame means their perspective is warped?  He doesn't mention anything about how he enjoyed the main game, and you tell him he missed it.  Let's go back.  New Super Mario Bros. Wii has no achievements.  You do get stars next to your file depending on if you found all the Star Coins, or all the secret exits.  The stars sparkle if you didn't die 3 times on a single level for your whole gametime.  I restarted my file once I figured out I had saved after doing that.  One way of looking at it is that I did this for an animated .gif to play at this meaningless point next to my file.  Another is that I feel a sense of pride when I see it and recall the experience.  Let's go even further back.  In the 90's Resident Evil games, you'd get different costumes for beating the game under certain conditions.  You could say you did all that for a different .mdl file to play as you went through the game again.  I liked it because it as something the game was challenging me to do, and I did it.  To me, achievements are the natural continuation of these sort of metagames that I played.  I don't think it's weird that something like an icon can be symbolic and make you feel happy recalling what you did to get it.  I mean, people bring back trinkets from vacation for this very reason.  Even more video gamey, you might get a little sticker that says ""I took the hard path"" on a hike you went on or something.  I don't think the idea of achievements is as warping or dangerous as you make it sound."
truegaming,3dlmgp,th3guys2,22,Tue Jul 21 11:03:24 2015 UTC,"The perspective is warped when compared to the kind of experience that was created for the majority of users. Yes, that option is there and you can do it, and it is totally fine to want to enjoy the game that way.  When you have a warped perspective, you are unable to appreciate some achievements for what they are, as the player is focused solely on the 100% aspect. When this happens, frustration comes from the achievements preventing one from reaching 100%, as the OP and many commenters supporting this thread seem to suggest. Once you reach that state, then these kind of threads come up, where the warped perspective of the OP starts to make sweeping rules for how achievements ""should be done"", to satisfy his desire to 100%. Its this warped perspective that called for changing how achievements work, and the play experiences of others.  Many people already enjoy achievements for what they are: a challenge, validation, feedback on progress, bragging rights, and sometimes with some minor real rewards. Changing them to meet OP's requirements (or changing them to meet 100%-able requirements) would alter this experience. And I have seen no real proof that altering that experience would produce a better outcome (because all arguments are about this desire to 100% are from those with warped perspectives).  Metagames are fine, I have played many games where the meta is really strong (Android: Netrunner, for example). But I would never ask the game itself be changed because I can't get optimal satisfaction from the meta. Because at some point, you have to play the game, and if your change isn't improving it, then it really needs to be justified in the metagame as having some truly significant impact."
truegaming,3dlmgp,HighlordBaiden,-2,Tue Jul 21 12:56:39 2015 UTC,"Some of us obsess over a game and don't care about the achievements. Some of us obsess over the achievements and don't care about the game. Some of us do both. What does it matter how we derive our satisfaction from games? You are writing from a perspective of someone who seems to not care about achievements as much as playing the game. To you, his perspective is warped. To him, your perspective is warped.  It's about how we feel that we've had fun. I've got a good bit of OCD in me, so I feel complete when I have finished all possible playthroughs of a game and have completed all achievements. I understand some of his gripes and agree with them for the most part. For those of us who do want to complete all the achievements these things are real and are frustrating. The utmost frustrating for me is things like Civ 5 where the devs have to actually be on for you to get the achievement for playing with a mod, since mods turn off achievement AFAIK. That's annoying."
truegaming,3dlmgp,th3guys2,2,Fri Jul 17 14:47:09 2015 UTC,"The issue with achievements, unlike games at large, is that they are absolutely binary.  Either you achieved it, or you didn't. Either you achieved all of them, or you didn't. When it comes to buying a game, are you going to change your decision to buy a game because it has a couple achievements which you deem unfair, or force you to play a way you don't like? If you would, then do you also buy games for genres/styles for which you don't enjoy, simply because you want to complete them, too?  The analogy is of course not great, but its to try and illustrate a point. That a game isn't judged or solely created for its achievements, as they are minor things. This push from, as I have seen, several posts on Reddit with many users supporting the OPs to have achievements be always achievable, makes little sense. How ""hard"" can an achievement be? Why no multiplayer achievements, and why no replays? His ""rules"" for the kinds of achievements which shouldn't be allowed are just as arbitrary as the achievements themselves.  And this is where these debates that come up every couple weeks/months on Reddit just get tiring to read. Some players want achievements to mean something impactful in relation to the game experience, others want achievements to represent completing all aspects of a game, some want them to denote obsession with the game. All of these competing needs necessarily can not exist side by side with binary 100% completion, and binary achievement status.  But those calling for changes the most often are those in the camp of ""I want achievements to mean I can 100% it, within my preferred playing style"". And the only proper rebut to that is, ""achievements are arbitrary, and its up to the game creator the kind of experience and audience that they think would best enjoy the small added benefit of achievements"", rather than the OP.  Who wants sweeping changes to all games, regardless of their intended experience or audience, to satisfy their overwhelming desire to 100% any game they happen to like.  So, that is why I called his perspective warped. Because it totally doesn't take into account the experiences of others, or the desires of others, as its an obsession."

They shouldn't be diluted so everyone can get them just to have another notch on their e-belt.  Just don't do them if they suck. They should not be designed around appealing to people obsessed with them.
truegaming,3dlmgp,Febrifuge,2,Fri Jul 17 09:11:38 2015 UTC,"I understand that. Hard achievements are good! Getting through a stealth game on maximum difficulty without being detected or killing is one of my favorite types of achievements! I also didn't say anything about achievements for never dying or only dying a certain number of times. Mile High Club is a difficult achievement, and I respect that. I don't want it to be removed or changed at all.   There's a line between difficult and ridiculous. Maximum difficulty with a time trial? Difficult. 100,000 kills? Let's assume you average 3 kills a second on average. That's 300,000 seconds. 300,000/60=5000. 5000/60=83.3333333... That's over 80 hours.

That's ridiculous, it is difficult, yes, but it is also ridiculous.   Well, once again, those achievements are there for people who want to really put in time to get an achievement, not completionists.  Devs will never do what you're asking, because easier achievements = less play time.  Just like how if leveling up completely in an RPG only took 25 hours, people would not feel the need to work toward anything and stop playing it after they reach that point.   That's why there is a curve to leveling after all.  Keep people coming back.  You get them addicted with the first few levels hitting in an hour or so of gameplay and then you make them work longer and harder for that rush as time goes on.  Achievements are pretty similar."

If you were asking why devs want the achievement system this way, it's simply to give people who want to really delve into a game the opportunity to do so. It takes very little effort and it keeps people playing the game to get the achievements if they so choose. Typically, people will 100% a game at most and then stop playing as much.  It keeps people who want to keep playing feeling like there is a reason to play. If you can't think of a reason why that would be a bad thing, look at destiny.

I'd much prefer cheevos like Blizzard does for WoW raids, like this one: ""Allow Necrotic Plague to stack to 30 before defeating the Lich King in 10-player mode."" (letting NP stack 30 times means everyone in your group is taking massive damage). It's an alternative way to defeat a boss, a more challenging way.

You can experience everything a game has to offer without getting most of the trophies (unless you get trophies for simply completing parts of the main story/campaign). But if we're talking a trophy like what OP is talking about, a trophy for 300,000 kills, you aren't experiencing anything less by not achieving that trophy. I doubt many of those 300,000 kills are going to change or add to the experience of the game. Experiencing 1000 kills is very likely just the same as experiencing 300,000, but with a lot less tedium and time spent on trying to get an arbitrary trophy.

truegaming,3dlmgp,jimmahdean,5,Fri Jul 17 19:38:45 2015 UTC,"Disagree strongly.  On #2, the entire point of Stanley Parable is that it's an art game. Bending the standard rules of achievements is what it's meant to do. Hell, there's an achievement for not playing the game for five years.  Regarding #4, #5, and #10, this massively restricts what achievements some games can do. X-COM has an achievement which requires you beat the game five times.  For #6, I imagine there are people out there saying ""if it's a multiplayer game, and there is a singleplayer, there should be no singleplayer achievements"". And some of them are probably thinking of the same game.  Nothing says you should be able to get all the achievements easily. Some games have fuckin' crazy achievements. I don't have a problem with that. Just put the game down when you're done and enjoy what you have."
truegaming,3dlmgp,MunchToast,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:57:58 2015 UTC,"#6, in my opinion, runs into the issue that the community dies over time, especially with smaller indie games. You can get all of the achievements, but if you try to get 100% and you literally cannot because nobody is ever online, it's really frustrating."
truegaming,3dlmgp,th3guys2,3,Fri Jul 17 14:22:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the only point on which I really agree with OP. There are a lot of people in areas without internet (or really bad internet) that literally can't even attempt to 100% games with online achievements."
truegaming,3dlmgp,jimmahdean,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:13:36 2015 UTC,"Why is it frustrating? Is it frustrating because you can't experience a part of the game, or frustrating because you can't get an achievement which says you did a part of the game?  If the first, that is understandable, but a natural cycle of the popularity of games. If the second, then I think you have an unhealthy obsession with achievements.  Do you also dislike achievements that could only be earned if you played during a particular event/date of the year? What about for players who really like the game, and did stick around for all those events? Do they not deserve the recognition because of some players who want to only get 100% achievement status as they are obsessed with achievements for things which anyone can do, as opposed to those who really were obsessed with the game?"
truegaming,3dlmgp,th3guys2,3,Fri Jul 17 16:45:52 2015 UTC,"Do you also dislike achievements that could only be earned if you played during a particular event/date of the year?    If they're part of 100% completion and you can't get them anymore, then yes.  Stuff like D3's Feats of Strength don't bother me.   Do they not deserve the recognition because of some players who want to only get 100% achievement status as they are obsessed with achievements for things which anyone can do, as opposed to those who really were obsessed with the game?   Not really. If it's a multiplayer game, give them an exclusive skin, or a medal in game or something. If I've completed 100% of the achievements that are possible, Steam should show that, instead of it being stuck at 49/50 because I didn't own the game at christmas 2011."
truegaming,3dlmgp,jimmahdean,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:50:17 2015 UTC,"But why is your need to 100% greater than the desire for someone to get recognition for completing something special or exclusive? If the argument is that its better game design, as part of the feedback/satisfaction loop, then I might agree. But it sounds like many arguments are actually achievements are meant to be 100%-able for personal obsession, rather than to have achievements be particularly unique or special."
truegaming,3dlmgp,th3guys2,2,Fri Jul 17 17:31:36 2015 UTC,"But it sounds like many arguments are actually achievements are meant to be 100%-able for personal obsession, rather than to have achievements be particularly unique or special.   You're completely accurate here, but you're acting like that's not a valid reason. We play games to be satisfied, people are satisfied by different things, such as 100% completion.  Also, unique/special achievements don't need to be restrictive."
truegaming,3dlmgp,jimmahdean,44,Fri Jul 17 17:37:17 2015 UTC,"Those two statements are at odds with each other.  You can't have both unique/special achievements, that only some particularly skilled, dedicated, or obsessed player could achieve, but also have achievements for which the casual player who ""just wants to 100%"" a game could not get.  Again, I am not saying your source of satisfaction is invalid, but I am calling it an obsession. But you haven't responded to the core of my argument, which is why does your personal preference to be able to 100% a game, necessarily dictate the direction and meaning of achievements? I am all for making every achievements for every game 100%-able, if there is reason for it. But I don't see it, because all the reasons are personal.  And if the argument comes down to a simple majority statement such as, ""some >50% of players want to 100%"", does that mean every game has to be designed that way, because its good design, or has to be designed that way, because its the only way to satisfy a large player base? And do games which deviate from this, like Stanley Parable, necessarily bad, or forced to reside in the ""art"" category, rather than be appreciated as a game, all because of arbitrary achievements?  See my comment elsewhere here which better clarifies/details how achievements can not be designed for all audiences: https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/3dlmgp/there_need_to_be_some_guidlines_for_achievements/ct6oyf8"
truegaming,3dlmgp,th3guys2,7,Fri Jul 17 17:44:48 2015 UTC,"Woah woah woah, hold on. You're taking my argument out of context.   You can't have both unique/special achievements, that only some particularly skilled, dedicated, or obsessed player could achieve, but also have achievements for which the casual player who ""just wants to 100%"" a game could not get.   This not the same as an achievement that requires you to play during a specific event wherein if you get the game after said event, you can no longer fully complete the game. Unique/special achievements, like BoI's Platinum God, are awesome, complete the game in pretty much every single way possible. It's hard, but it's doable  If you cannot achieve an achievement, why is it there?"
truegaming,3dlmgp,jimmahdean,15,Fri Jul 17 17:51:40 2015 UTC,"But you could achieve the achievement, if you were around or did something extraordinary. Its meant to be an extreme example, not an example which necessarily makes up my argument.  The OP of this Reddit thread has many restrictions on achievements, some of which he calls too grindy. It may be achieveable to get 100,000 kills, but is that a good achievement? Why is that any worse than an achievement which only 1% of players have the physical skill or dedication to put into the game to earn? And how is that necessarily different than an achievement which can only be earned by performing something during an exclusive event?  There are differences, sure, but the core of those differences is: some players aren't going to get those achievements, and so some (if not many) will not have 100% status. And if its the case that we don't have to worry about how many players can achieve 100%, why not have fun with the design of the achievements to make them more than they could be? Because if they have to forever and always be achievable, it does take away some more interesting achievements. What about achievements that necessarily require playing the game for so many hours, or years? What about achievements for creating mods, or backing a game during testing? Are those not valid achievements because not everyone can achieve them, or are they not valid because no one else can achieve them, for technical reasons?  It might sound nitpicky, but I really want to see where people stand on this, other than the OP who clearly stems from the ""it must all be 100% achievable in a reasonable way"", which destroys many unique/plausible achievements.  Why do achievements have to be always achievable? Maybe they should have had a different name, like medals, instead. That would have allowed for a wider variety and kind of visible validation of completing some task, without the connotation that they must be completable by anyone/always/forever.  Apologies for taking your position out of context, I wasn't quite sure where you were coming from and overshot."

The only game I know of that did this, Universe Simulator, actually got quite a bit of flak for that   What about achievements for creating mods, or backing a game during testing?   Two different things here, achievements for creating mods, sure, I suppose those are acceptable, but you aren't really achieving anything in game. The backing the game/testing the game, no, I don't think those should be achievements. A forum tag, or something of that sort, sure, but don't put a steam achievement in for doing it.

I don't really like grinding achievements if they're ridiculous or out of place, but that's a pretty fuzzy line, and they're not that big of a deal to me (relatively, none of this is really that big of a deal, just an annoyance)  You shouldn't have an achievement in call of duty to kill 50,000 dudes in the campaign, because that would require you to play through the campaign several times solely for that one achievement. Luckily, there isn't one.  Physical skill achievements are awesome.   They're different from exclusive event achievements because they are actually achievable and don't require you to have purchased the game before a certain date."
truegaming,3dlmgp,ImperfectSanity,-4,Fri Jul 17 18:16:00 2015 UTC,"I feel like you and i (and many others, it seems) have very different views on what an ""achievement"" in a game is/should be.   From what it looks like in your complaints (and please correct me if im wrong) you feel like a good player should be able to unlock most achievements in a game without going out of their way too much. I deduce this from your complaints against grinding, unlocking multiple achievments for a single high-dofficulty playthorugh, desire for respecs, and complaints about unknown qualifications.  In my mind achievements exist specifically for those few completionists who want to go out of their way and then be able to brag about ""yeah, i got Seriously 3.0 in Gears of War, no biggie"". More bizarre achievements lend themselves to some ARG-flair where the community might get together to figure out what all those hidden achievements are.  The concept explains it self: an achievement isnt really an achievement if you didnt need to achieve something special to get it, right? Getting 100% achievement completion in a game should garner an equal mix of respect and ""damn dude you need to get out more"". Otherwise whats the point of incudling them at all except for a little skinner-boxy pop up every now and then?"

I'm not the op but I agree with you on most parts except the part about having to unlock different difficulties. For me, my complaint isn't with achievements but just the fact that some games I want to play on the highest difficulty setting right out of the gate.   A good example, for me, is Halo. I've been playing the Halo series since 2002, if not since 2001. I've mastered Legendary on the first 3, ODST, and 4, plus I'm pretty okay at multiplayer. So when I play a new Halo game I like to jump in right at Legendary because that's what's fun to me in a Halo singleplayer campaign. A similar situation with Gears, just because the enemies in Gears aren't usually bullet sponges on Insane. I don't really care about the achievements but I would like the ability to jump right into the hardest difficulty if I so wish."
truegaming,3dlmgp,crimsonedge7,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:55:35 2015 UTC,"I disagree with 9 and 10.  9: In Braid for example there is a very slow cloud moving, almost not noticable. You'd have to wait a certain amount of hours on it to get a star (not an achievement but very analoguous).  Or Gran Turismo has a 24 hours race, again not an achievement but shows long playthroughs can be fun for hardcore players. And on that subject, hardcore players like achievements, too. It wouldn't be fun if there was not an achievement after completing something big.  10: What's wrong with completing a game multiple times? Maybe the game is short with multiple endings?  I think that 9 and 10 both come down to 7; no grinding. If it's not fun to play 4+ hours for anyone, or complete the game multiple times, that I'd say it constitutes as grinding. But I don't believe there is anything wrong with 9 and 10 per se.  Finally, I would like to add that no achievement should be rewarded for parts all players will go through in a normal playthrough anyway. There's little point in rewarding the player for completing the tutorial or performing the first jump."
truegaming,3dlmgp,bblluueebbiirrdd,21,Fri Jul 17 23:13:29 2015 UTC,"Finally, I would like to add that no achievement should be rewarded for parts all players will go through in a normal playthrough anyway. There's little point in rewarding the player for completing the tutorial or performing the first jump.   These achievements exist for 2 reasons, usually.   They serve as a progress barometer.  ""Oh, you got that achievement?  You had to have beaten level 4, so I know I can ask you about X that happens in level 4."" (this also applies to all other achievements) They give stats to devs about what players are doing in their game, and perhaps more importantly, where they stop.  If they can see that 50% of players don't have the level 6 achievement, maybe they can take a look at level 6 and see if there's anything out of the ordinary there that is causing players to give up, like a bug of some kind or a huge difficulty spike."
truegaming,3dlmgp,ToastedFishSandwich,8,Fri Jul 17 09:38:59 2015 UTC,"Part of my reasoning for 9 is that it's rare for many people to have a long enough time to sit down and play for several hours straight. The main achievement that influenced this was 7 day survivor, where you have to spend 14 hours in one session, making sure you don't die by eating every twenty minutes.  In Braid could you just set the game down and go to work then come back, or would the cloud come back?  If the game is short, then definitely 10 doesn't apply to it. If I'm playing say FTL or Gunpoint, it's really easy to just start a new game and play through real quick. Maybe not exactly for FTL because of RNG, but it gets the point across. My main point with ten was like in Max Payne, you have to play through the entire 8-10 hour game multiple times to unlock a new hardcore mode, then you have to beat that mode that restarts you if you die to get the achievement.  Yeah, I guess they do kind of simplify to number 7. Thanks for the other perspective!"

But if the guideline for achievements is ""all of them should be achievable for an average player"", doesn't that completely remove the point of them? On a greater scale, if a player like you regularly aims to get every single achievement in every single game they buy, are they even achievements anymore? Shouldn't an achievement be something difficult enough that attaining it is rare, and a mark of pride/effort? It seems like that building the achievement system around the guideline ""must be convenient enough that most players can get every single one"" is just patronising."

Achievements are arbitrary, and should be seen as such. They may or may not indicate mastery, or dedication, or obsession with the game, or obsession with the achievement, or skill.  Each achievement should be judged for what it is, rather than judged for whether or not that achievement prevents some players from getting 100%. When you starting judging it for that, then suddenly achievements are forced to mean a very particular thing, and that is what I think the user z4cz0r is getting at. That by mandating that all achievements for all games are 100%-able, it necessarily creates a lot of rules and obsession over each achievement that forces it to be a very particular thing. This necessarily creates a lot of discussion, over something that many players feels is unnecessary over something which is by its very nature arbitrary."
truegaming,3dlmgp,th3guys2,3,Fri Jul 17 16:48:40 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm not quite understanding, but I still don't understand why people would complain about optional additions to a game. There's no need to aim for a high score, a top position on a leaderboard, or the completion of a ""hardcore"" mode. We do these things anyway because we enjoy them for the challenge. Then you have others who don't care about those things, but they aren't forced into it. That's how I see achievements. If I really love, for example, Arkham City and want to enjoy an additional challenge outside the main game, I might attempt the achievement for completing all challenge maps with three stars. The achievement itself does nothing to affect my ability to do so, it just adds a neat little digital trophy that makes me happy.  As for rules for achievements, I get the premise but most of the rules stated above don't make sense to me. Again, no one is making you do this, it's an added bonus. There is no achievement in Minecraft for making a massive fountain that spews live cats, but it's been done anyway simply because people enjoy doing that sort of thing. Making a box pop up and acknowledge your having done it doesn't make it any harder or easier. Again, I admit I may not be understanding the premise of this argument, but to me it seems pretty open and shut."

truegaming,3dlmgp,rowedrage,7,Fri Jul 17 17:48:36 2015 UTC,"To add on, if you look at several of my posts around this thread, you'll notice I use the word ""obsession"" a lot, because that is what the ""strong desire to get 100%"" for achievement status is.  I agree this should be an open/shut case, but it isn't because a vocal minority, who are very obsessed with achievements, are only satisfied if they can 100% complete them. For which I have been trying to recenter the discussion around that idea: that there is nothing wrong with achievements as they are, its the players who are obsessed, and don't know it, that are the problem."
truegaming,3dlmgp,cathartis,0,Fri Jul 17 17:55:59 2015 UTC,"It's an easy way for developers to make gamers care more about playing the game than they would otherwise. I don't really like the idea of trophies and achievements, and I have to assume the compulsion over them is largely reserved for younger gamers whose early gaming started on Steam or Xbox360 or PS3. Achievements and trophies simply weren't a thing before then. Before then, a rare achievement gave the player a tangible reward for performing something difficult. Now the icon is the reward itself. The icon that you can do nothing with but have on your profile like a reward.   You make an average game, people like it, they play through it once, and that's it. No real desire to replay or go back, unless they loved the game. But toss in some arbitrary trophies, and the serious gamers who thought the game was alright will spend a bit more time replaying it and going through it to get those trophies for this fleeting reward. Kind of a short cut to increasing your game's replay value without having to actually improve or add content.   That said, I do actually get a sense of achievement from some trophies and achievements I get in games. It's nice to see them, but it's no excuse to spend extra hours on a game that otherwise isn't that compelling."

Because the timelines were so short we'd have to make horrible compromises on design, one of which was achievements. Since achievements had to be translated, the publisher would require them to be done well before the game was even in alpha, so the designers had no time to find out what would be challenging or interesting for the player before making the achievements. As a completionist this just drove me crazy."

truegaming,3dlmgp,Pencliff,2,Fri Jul 17 13:04:36 2015 UTC,"I think anything goes as far as achievements are concerned. It's all just extra shit to do if you want to play the game more after finishing it. A goal beyond the end of the game, if you like.  I think the current console achievement system is flawed. It encourages people to go to silly lengths to get imaginary points that don't mean anything. Is 25 points for playing as two specific characters in a Lego game worth the same as completing Bayonetta on it's hardest difficulty setting? Not at all. The only comparison is ""how many other people have this specific achievement?""  There are many categories of ""achievement"" that should be something else.  Typically there is progression. Complete chapter 3, complete the game on Normal or higher. That kind of thing.  Another is collecting the tedious UFO parts in GTA V, or feathers in Assassin's Creed. That should be a progress bar. The idea that there's one achievement and only if you get all of them is off-putting. A better solution would be a simple statistic. ""You have 138 out 200. 14% of players have achieved this"".  Another category is secrets. Things like picking the two Chris Evans characters in that Marvel Lego game. Obscure but entertaining things to find. The game shouldn't even have to reveal the name or how many there are.  You can put all of these under a number of predefined categories. Exploration, Progression, Challenges, Secrets, Multiplayer, etc.  You can have any level of grindy progress, as long as you keep track of it. It's no longer about completion. It's about competition.  The only stipulation I would add is that DLC achievements are listed as such. I spent hours trying one in one of the Assassin's Creed games, that would only unlock if you had the extras, despite only using regular game features."
truegaming,3dlmgp,leuthil,2,Fri Jul 17 13:09:00 2015 UTC,"Having categories would be cool. It would let you know if you've completed all the quest related achievements versus collection achievements.  I'm guessing you're on console, because Steam does the percentages and has progress bars.   I like difficult achievements, I just find that some achievements are ridiculous. To get 100,000 kills in GoW while averaging 3 kills per second takes over 80 hours."
truegaming,3dlmgp,Amauriel,2,Fri Jul 17 10:29:26 2015 UTC,"IMO there's only really a few things that bother me when it comes to achievements. I agree 100% that beating the game on the hardest difficulty should unlock all achievements for beating the game on lower difficulties (there's little sense of achievement to be felt beating something easier than what you already beat), and leaderboard achievements are a bit iffy to me, especially some older games. I was revisiting some 360 games I never had a chance to play and some of the achievements are literally unobtainable at this point (not just hard, either the servers arn't online, or the leaderboards are glitched/cheated with someone completeing a level in 0:01 or something obviously impossible).  That said, those are really the only two things I feel should be the limits. Grinding, multiple completions on newer game modes, long sessions are all achievements in all sense of the word, and I think that's the key. You're being rewarded for achieving something."
truegaming,3dlmgp,IrishWeegee,2,Fri Jul 17 10:39:37 2015 UTC,Things like seriously from GoW are just there to increase how long people play the game especially multiplayer. In my cynical opinion most achievements and trophies are just a means of artificially lengthening or increasing the difficulty of a game.   As someone who tries not to care about achievements but sometimes goes out of they're way to get them I think they can really ruin a gaming experience especially if they force you to play a certain way or follow a very strict guide (me and dead rising) and not just pay how you want and enjoy the gameplay or storyline for what it is.
truegaming,3dlmgp,Katallaxis,2,Fri Jul 17 13:34:16 2015 UTC,"A lot of your reasoning behind these rules are good, but I don't think the restriction is always correct. I do agree with some completely though. Here are some thoughts on ones I may differ in opinion slightly:  4 - I'm not sure if this is technically possible with certain achievement systems like the built-in system with Xbox. I'm not sure but I understand it, especially if creating a new character in the ""default"" decision tree doesn't allow you to get those achievements then it is technically impossible without owning the previous game and replaying it.  5 - Maybe a little more clarification is needed, but doing multiple play throughs are part of certain game's achievements and I think it's completely fine. Depending on the type of game, why should you be able to get every achievement on one play through?  6 - It's the same thing. A ribbon and an achievement become the same thing if you restrict achievements from the multiplayer aspect. I understand where you're going with this. Someone that only wants to participate in the single player portion of the game shouldn't have their OCD of achievement completion squashed by not playing multiplayer. Truthfully though it is a good way to encourage multiplayer play as that really hooks players to continue playing the game. Overall though I think someone's OCD and decision to only play single player (unless they can't like not paying for Xbox Live or something) shouldn't be enough reason to remove achievements from multiplayer.  7 - Getting 100,000 kills is what I would call a pretty fair achievement. It's grinding to some, or it could just be a badge of length of game time. They are a war veteran. Someone that has played that long gets recognition and what's wrong with that?  10 - Not sure why this shouldn't be an achievement? The harder something is to achieve, the more the few people who complete it want to be rewarded and recognized. If you're suggesting that all achievements maintain some level of reasonable attainability then I think that is up for debate because some gamers have crazy dedication to games they love and how do you draw that line and determine what is reasonably attainable? It's different to each player."
truegaming,3dlmgp,Grammaton485,2,Fri Jul 17 16:52:45 2015 UTC,"Absolutely on #6. I have a game from Xbox Live that technically had multiplayer, and I bought it early on, but I never saw enough people playing to get into a ranked match. I booted it up recently and have every achievement but ""Win a ranked game 25 times"". Of course, years later and with that game now on things like Steam, there's no way they are going to have people playing online, even if they DID when the game launched, which they didn't."

truegaming,3dlmgp,SuperKirbyFan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:04:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with 1-3, 7-9, though with some caveats. I disagree with 4, 5, and 10.  For 4 and 5, you seem to be saying that, for example, in a game like Skyrim, your decisions about how to build a character shouldn't lock you out of particular achievements while playing as that character. That seems kinda dumb. Analogously, would you say that there should be no achievements dependent on moral choices the player made earlier in the game?  I'm inclined to agree with 7, because I think achievements should avoid falling into the category of ""only possible if you have an unhealthy obsession with this game and it's literally ruining your life"", because that's grossly unfair to the completionist in all of us.  For 6: I just think singleplayer and multiplayer achievements should be partitioned into separate lists, with separate scores, icons, and so forth. This may help the completionist write-off the multiplayer component and still get the sweet satisfaction of a nice juicy 100% complete stat in his singleplayer achievement list, or vice versa."

Lots of times when I go to play a game and look at the trophies, I'll notice that there are multiplayer trophies and the server is either dead, or shut down.  A while back I thought about getting all the trophies in the Assassin's Creed games, but I don't see the point when Brotherhood, Revelations, 3, and 4 all have multiplayer trophies and no one really plays those games anymore.  Then there's games such as Playstation All-Stars.  That game makes sense to have multiplayer trophies since it's meant to be mainly a multiplayer game, but they made it so all but one of the online trophies can't be obtained against friends, it has to be against random opponents.  Not so easy when some of them require 4-player matches and it's hard to find opponents."
truegaming,3dlmgp,BrightNooblar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:55:58 2015 UTC,"I think you are absolutely right. Just because the sky's the limit for what an achievement can be, doesn't mean it's all good design.  I've been playing Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, and I've been keeping notes on Jiggy placement rules because Nintendo games are great at disciplined design like this. For example, you never have to die to get a jiggy because (at least in my opinion) it's not good to encourage players to do the thing that would normally cause them to lose.  To address some of your guidelines, one big recurring theme is the idea that it should not put an unreasonable burden on your players to get all achievements. So grinding insanely is out. Requiring tons of replays is out. If you can't find a single person on your dev team who wants to or has gotten all achievements, that's a red flag.   Another theme is that achievements should be only a collection of things that are possible for you to do with your current game. So no DLC, until it's bought. And multiplayer achievements should probably be in a separate pool, for those who like multiplayer but don't like singleplayer.  Those are both just really sound concepts to me.  Just because developers are allowed to make an achievement require anything, doesn't mean any achievement will be fun for players.  I don't think there are guidelines from Microsoft, Sony, or Valve on this stuff, except that they all need to be achievable, but you've proposed a good start."

If there are multiplayer achievements, none of them should require you to throw a match to achieve them.  A perfect example of this is Halo 3. The achievements were only achievable in ranked games and even playlist restricted, and some were completely absurd, such as splatter an enemy with a mongoose. Not only could you not do this on some maps, but even attempting to do this is absurd. There is no reasonable situation where this action would be better than just shooting at someone. At best it is just a random event, and at that point it isnt an achievement."

Getting 100,000 kills is quite literally the definition of ""an achievement"". It's something to be proud of that you can look back on, show off as proof that you actually did it, and nothing else. Whether it's something easy or straight forward to do, or whether it's impossibly difficult to do, that should not matter in the slightest.   I don't understand the achievement hunting sub-culture of gaming. It just doesn't make sense. A list of achievements in games does not service the purpose of being something that needs to be completed. Achievement completion doesn't indicate anything about ""mastery of a game"" or anything else like that. It's perception is entirely based on the individual gamer; if you think it has value, you'll try to complete it in the way that it was designed to be completed. If you don't think it has value, it won't bother you in the slightest (and this is where most people fall).   No achievement should ever have any effect on the game itself. It should always be the other way around.  Sorry, whole-hardheartedly disagree with this entire post."
truegaming,3dlmgp,gk3coloursred,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:51:51 2015 UTC,"Achievements are great when they're skill-based or dedication-based. In some cases, I really don't mind grindy achievements, since they show you've put a lot of time into the game.  The one thing that really ruin it for me are ""impossible"" trophies. I don't understand why they can't just go in and fix these or remove them, if necessary. It's not that I don't care about the game itself, but I get OCD about it, and I know a lot of gamers are like that just by personality.  Other things that suck are temporal trophies. Whether this means having been able to download this certain thing at a certain time or playing online for a server that may go down, regardless, it's annoying. It basically makes a game become impossible to 100%, removing the ""timeless"" aspect of the game.  Mind you, I think achievements are a great thing to have come to gaming. Some may say that it has ruined the gaming experience, but personally, I like it as a checklist to whether you have mastered a game. Before achievements became something on the platform, sometimes they were just their own thing within the game itself, and I loved them. Making them impossible just makes it so inaccessible for late adopters to come in and enjoy the game if they're completionists."

truegaming,3dlmgp,Scrumpert,0,Fri Jul 17 21:44:25 2015 UTC,"I feel like the Stanley Parable achievement is kinda part of what that game is. It's supposed to be unreasonable.  I disagree with 4 and 5. If you want to get all those particular trophies then you should start a new game with a new character and make new decisions. If you can respec then people will just level up their character a bunch, respec and get the trophies near instantly.   To 6: A game is not inherently single player. If their is multiplayer then it is ALSO a multiplayer game. Having achievements for MP then makes sense. This point only gives preferential treatment for those who prefer SP and may not touch MP. But plenty of other players who achievement hunt also play MP. So they shouldn't get the opportunity to earn them through MP because some people don't play MP?   10 I also disagree with. Achievements should be achievements. Not hand outs. Most games only require you to beat the game once (either any difficulty or the hardest one) to unlock another mode. So if you have to play a game twice to get a trophy for the most difficult mode then so be it. Hopefully you like the game enough to play it more than once. Don't know why you would trophy hunt in a game you didn't like enough to play more than once anyway."
truegaming,3dlmgp,AchromaticSky,2,Sat Jul 18 08:01:01 2015 UTC,"Achievements shouldn't be random with unknown qualifications, i.e. Stanley Parable Unachievable, 1 in 15 chance.   Do you have a better example? Stanley Parable achievements are literally made to troll you.   Unbought DLC should not count towards the total achievement list until it is purchased.  If it is a singleplayer game, and there is a multiplayer, there should be no multiplayer achievements. That's what ribbons and ranks are for.  If there is a leaderboard, there should be no achievements to reach the top/in the top # on the leaderboards  Decisions, if transferable from previous games, should not block the ability to unlock achievements in the current game.   I read another comment suggesting something like achievement categories which would separate these, which I think would make sense. I think multiplayer feats are worthy of an achievement, but some cases may make these impossible to get down the road.   If there are achievements that require skills from different trees, there should be a way to respec that resets skills and allows reallocation.   I think the underlying pain of these is that it doesn't recognize what you did to accomplish it. The first one is basically just ""get your character to level 60"", and the second is ""get your character to level 60, twice"". And while it seems to aim to make you experiment with different specs, I find that these types of achievements might ask me to make a less interesting character. For example if I chose spec A on my first character and my second character's build makes spec B worthless.    Intense grinding should not be required. Such as the Gears of War 3 achievement, ""Seriously 3.0: Get 100,000 Kills""   This is a pretty vague rule, and some games thrive on intense grinding.    No achievement should require playing one session longer than 3-4 hours. This is negated if you are not required to be constantly engaged. Being able to set the game down and go do something else, and then come back is more acceptable. And no achievements should require you to beat the game multiple times to unlock another mode, and then beat that unlocked mode. This is subjective to how long the game is.   I disagree here. In another post I think you mentioned Dead Rising's 7 day survivor mode, but that is a whole mode built specifically for you to attempt this challenge. I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with any of these."
truegaming,3dlmgp,Khanstant,-1,Sat Jul 18 16:19:34 2015 UTC,"I generally agree but a few I'll expand my thoughts upon.    3 and 4 should just be the norm.  You shouldn't be made to feel inferior by not having the 'full' version of the game you just paid full price for because you lack DLC.  Sometimes you simply don't want the DLC or think it offers poor value for money.  I realise that pointing out to players they haven't '100%d' a game may very often push players to buy the DLC and gain the company extra sales, but I think it's a shitty tactic for doing so.  Likewise not being able to 'complete' because you never completed/played the previous game is BS.    6 and 7?  Well, yes and no.  By all means include some, but don't go over the top and have the majority of them there in order to force mass playing of a bolted-on multiplayer mode - esp if it is primarily a singleplayer game.  Was it 'Special Ops: The Line' where the MP mode was bolted on against the developers wishes?  Play and win once or a small number of times in each mode/map?  That's OK though.  8 - I know of this being done, but wtf?  Be ranked #1 in the world?  Not top 10% in a day/week/month, but #1 since the game came out?  Not only would that be helluva tough to get, but it becomes rapidly harder the longer the game is out for."
truegaming,3dk7na,SwarPM,16,Thu Jul 16 22:57:53 2015 UTC,"A focus on team modes is an interesting idea, but I can't help but think it's like giving up.   Starcraft is never going to beat League of Legends, for a variety of reasons. The inherent problems of 1v1 gameplay are a big part in that, but not the only part. However, I think that chasing that dream is rather missing the point now. Starcraft only wants to be on top because it used to be on top, back when there was very little at the bottom. But history shows that there's plenty of room in the middle, if you're willing to settle.  Fighting games, another perennial 1v1 competition, do not, have not, and will not, pull in League or DotA numbers, in terms of players and cash, but they keep on trucking. Same with Quake duels, to a lesser degree. They've long since been supplanted by team-focused FPS, but people still compete in 1v1, and with recent updates and interest in the genre, there'll be a bit more money and attention.  People who watch ice hockey don't have to compare their league to baseball or basketball's draws in order to keep enjoying the game. Sure, there's less money, less fans overall, but as long as the game can sustain itself, it's good enough for everyone.  It's possible that Blizzard has done irreparable damage to competitive SC2. I really don't know, since I stopped paying attention sometime before the release of Heart of the Swarm. If they can pull it out of the fire with Legacy of the Void, and fans learn to be content with no longer being the top dog, then it might still do well enough. As much as money is a driving factor for people, players still play what they like, and a game as unique as Starcraft has something to offer.  edit: words"
truegaming,3dk7na,page0rz,5,Fri Jul 17 01:12:16 2015 UTC,"I agree. Blizzard has botched up competitive SC2 despite being given such a commanding position originally. That's why I am looking to the future of the RTS genre to help allow a new popular and competitive game arise. I think for that it's important to note the mistakes of SC2 and look at what other Esports games are doing right.  It pains me to say it and the reason I bothered to write this was as follows: I'm certain that there is no hope for LotV as an Esport.  Lastly I would say that it's not about beating LoL or any other Esport but about making an RTS which fills that gap and does it properly. A game that is fun and takes the best aspects from success stories (hence the discussion on it being a team-based game) and crucially keeps that player retention rate. SC2 never got that retention rate at the popular level that it started at. RTSs can do better and will be in the future, that's why the comparison is there, not to beat LoL but to show how much better the genre could be doing."
truegaming,3dk7na,page0rz,9,Fri Jul 17 01:20:20 2015 UTC,"I'm just not sure the genre, as is, could be doing that much better in today's market. If they can carve out a sustainable niche, that might be all there is to do.   Fundamentally altering the way the game is played is drastic, and changes the landscape. I'm sure many games could be more successful if they became something else, and it's entirely possible that team games are the future of RTS as well--but it's just as possible that, by entering that team arena, and competing directly with the likes of LoL and DotA, they'd be doing double duty by alienating the players that stick with RTS because they like 1v1, and not quite reaching the players don't play traditional RTS for other reasons."
truegaming,3dk7na,HereComeTheColdJets,2,Fri Jul 17 01:54:38 2015 UTC,"they'd be doing double duty by alienating the players that stick with RTS because they like 1v1,   This is what instantly came to mind, sure there's been strategies, setups, and other cooperative styles to concisely play team matches of games like AOE, AOM, etc but sometimes a lot of enjoyment that was best had from these titles was when it was just 1v1 squaring off. People like to have total control in these games and it might turn some off when there needs to be teamwork and reliance upon the other player's actions.  Yeah having 3v3 with people having specific tailored roles can lead for things that are exciting and have some good action when good things fall together, but I just feel like people enjoy not having to be so reliant on others in these kinds of scenarios. If you completely have a person screw up, it's going to be super shitty playing as if you're a man down in need of what that player's civilization/team brought to the 3 man paradigm.  At least in something like a traditional RTS, if someone's fucking up yeah it might make life a little annoying and you might waste resources sending units to save their ass etc, but it wasn't necessarily total game over for your team. A person could still power through and dominate on their own accord, again total control allowing this.   There is potential for the idea in question OP has, but I think we find ourselves back at the common retort with this kinda stuff where RTS's in general can be a bit taxing and complicated to create, and it might not really be seen as worthwhile specifically shooting for this sort of game type that might not exactly be the most popular thing to do at the moment."

I only ask because the past few weeks have made me extremely optimistic about the future of LotV. There has been an immense amount of communication between the community and the dev team and it seems like the dev team's goals are in line with the things that, in my opinion, make an exciting esport (fun to play, fun to watch, high skill ceiling, etc.).   Firstly, is it looks no more or less impressive than a normal 1v1 game meaning that the play doesn’t seem much more interesting beyond a couple of micro tricks.   David Kim actually addressed this point and stated that they are exploring ways to make the actions of the different parts of the archon more distinct from each other. While an archon mode game may look like a 1v1, I feel like showing who is doing what is a great way to address the issue.   in effect playing different games   Could you also expand on this point a little? I'm just having a hard time imagining an archon feeling like they are playing ""different games"". Coordinating army positioning, sharing map awareness, and coordinating reactions to the enemy archon (there are probably other factors I can't think of) seem like things that would make the archon game feel like a single unified game for the players."

Fourth, I don't see Blizzard having sufficient economic incentives to do the kind of overhaul required, they get their money mostly from selling the game rather than beyond it and a large amount of buyers that they have are from people who want to play the campaign and dabble with the format - not the Esports section.  The fact that David Kim is trying to make them distinct suggests they're not distinct enough - go further and make it team based (it's what an Archon Mode equates to anyway as all those 'team problems' occur within it).  By playing different games I mean that in my suggested system each person has their own base and things they clearly call their own and each person has to do everything another person would do (collect resources, micro). Within Archon Mode what you get is 2 people doing 2 different jobs, one will micro and the other will macro. Within a game one person misses out on half of the core aspects to the game...

The fact that David Kim is trying to make them distinct suggests they're not distinct enough - go further and make it team based (it's what an Archon Mode equates to anyway as all those 'team problems' occur within it).   I think the difficulty here is that balancing an RTS for 1v1 is hard enough and so having to balance for 2v2 or 3v3 in addition to 1v1 would be way too difficult to accomplish in any meaningful way. Sure you could just say ""to hell with 1v1 balance"" but I firmly believe that would piss people off more than anything.

I don't think it's necessarily true that this is the optimum way to play archon mode. One of the things that David Kim is interested in is the way tasks are divided up in archon mode (he mentioned this at the recent WCS finals I think). It could very well be the case that just dividing things up by macro/micro is not the optimum way to do things. There's also the fact that the players themselves have agency in the way they play and if two players decide they want to do a little of everything, they can certainly do that."

That is, Quake failed because it didn't become Counter-Strike (a team game).   People still do play Quake duels, simply because it's the only 1v1 (and TDM, and CTF) still left in FPS. Just like Starcraft is the only good 1v1 left in that type of genre. In fact, QuakeCon starts next week, with a $40,000 prize pool just added by Intel, and I plan on tuning in to watch.  By the way, Quake Live is a free to play game that is part of a substantial franchise, so why isn't it doing as well as Counter-Strike, which is a paid game? Could it be that the gameplay matters? That team games are inherently more popular than 1v1 games, which was my poiint (and OP's point as well)?"

truegaming,3dk7na,Putnam3145,20,Mon Jul 20 04:35:37 2015 UTC,"RTS has a problem: The fantasy of RTS is smashing two massive armies into each other, thats why people play them. The sad reality are raids, and boring ""oh, I got out APMd.""  Starcraft 2 is especially bad because just how quickly the game goes from ""start the APM fest"" to ""you were 5s too slow, and your base crippled"" to ""you lose"".  The widespread GGing of games because comebacks are so hard as to be impossible in professional play shows that the game has no competitive balance, that it's a snowball without any actual sporting play.  Lets throw out your idea of team RTS, it's a stupid idea. Instead, let us look at features of MOBAs other than the team aspect.   The game cannot be rushed. MOBAs have phases, where there are escalating risks, rewards and power levels.   Early game, people match up in lanes to accumulate levels and xp, and try to harass for advantage. Kills rarely result in much more than one defensive structure or neutral objective. Mid game, teams group because the individual matchups are over, and it is a time-space problem to reach the inner defensive structures. Here, teamfights occur, and the winning team takes 1-2 objectives if they win. Late game, teams will fight, and usually the losing team will lose the game.   You can see that starcraft rewards winning the early game with winning the game, instead of an advantage in the midgame. RTSs need to have distinct and followed phases of play. A player in a MOBA never loses power, and the maximum power is capped. This means that comebacks are always an option. Losing a fight makes your opponent stronger from kill gold, yes, but it does not weaken you, unlike is almost every single RTS. A change so that you can easily recover offensive power after a lost battle is needed to implement this. Additionally, some form of unit cap is also needed so that in the longest games, advantages are neutralised as both side reach full capacity. MOBA maps start off very controlled and slowly lose control. By placing the only sources of power in a small area between where each team controls, you cause players to engage in conflict, unlike RTS, where players accumulate power without conflict. Thus, players fight to retain control and to break down their opponents control.   Well balanced esports such as I dunno, Quake had these features. Winning the early game might mean getting the first damage amp, but that never won you the game, it just gave an advantage. Sure, getting killed sucked, but you could easily pick up weapons and get back into the game on an even footing. Finally, moving around the map was dictated by places you could get power, such as the damage amp and the respawns of such.  A good esport RTS will have features like: You start with a base preconstructed with defenses that kick say, T1 units away easily. Early game: No chance of winning, so you must fight over neutral objectives. having units killed gives back most of the resources used to buy them, so you don't really lose power, just time. Resource points are hard to defend, and few in number unlike every SC2 map I've watched with room for 6! expansions and minerals out each players ears!  Esports are good when the game moves in phases, when comebacks and hope are constant, and when maps encourage non capital conflict, something RTSs are basically useless at. Take a look at why 40min no rush was such a favoured mode among casuals and you'll see what people actually want.  EDIT: My three points about phases, constant power and control all apply to esports fighting games as well."
truegaming,3dk7na,Axeran,8,Fri Jul 17 03:33:42 2015 UTC,"Losing a fight makes your opponent stronger from kill gold, yes, but it does not weaken you   ...except in Dota 2, where losing a fight makes you lose large amounts of gold and certain items (one of which is the highest damaging item in the game, though the risk is big enough that people almost never go for it these days)."
truegaming,3dk7na,LeVentNoir,3,Fri Jul 17 06:33:07 2015 UTC,"The only items that drop on character deaths in Dota2 is the Divine Rapier (the big damage item you mentioned) and the Gem of True Sight. Otherwise you get to keep everything you are carrying.  For as long as I can remember, the Rapier has always been a last-resort option item when a team is far behind. Which makes sense, given that it is a high-risk, high-reward item."
truegaming,3dk7na,Bernabuss,-6,Fri Jul 17 07:45:24 2015 UTC,"Gold is not power, gold is the potential of power, and in general, your items stay through death.  Your death did not cost power, only time, (which you spend getting the gold back)."

truegaming,3dk7na,Seveneyes7,15,Sun Jul 19 23:14:10 2015 UTC,This is rich... Opening with how 'impossible' comebacks in Sc2 are... And then explaining how MOBAs are great. As far as I can tell the mythical 'comeback' is rare at best in high level MOBA leagues.
truegaming,3dk7na,Spartancfos,2,Fri Jul 17 04:30:43 2015 UTC,"Completely agree with this. Specifically because a lot of a MOBA team's ""comeback ability"" resides in the character select.  In a MOBA game if you pick a truly early game team composition and you lose the early game then there is no comeback happening.  The way I see it, the reason there is an apparent lack of comebacks in SC2, whereas there are more comebacks in MOBA's is because of solo vs team.  It is much easier to ""push for the win"" or to ""complete the snowball"" in a solo setting than it is in a team setting. As if one member of your team makes a mistake then it opens up avenues for comebacks."
truegaming,3dk7na,page0rz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:15:02 2015 UTC,"This is an incredibly butthurt response.   Like them or not the MOBA genre is a very clever design that promotes matches that allow players to keep playing in the face of disadvantage early game. In RTS there is not really a facility to do this. The loss of units and structures is relatively irrepreable because those units would be needed to make a comeback. In a MOBA other options exist, jungling, gathering resources, fighting under your towers etc. These very literally allow comebacks after short term loss."
truegaming,3dk7na,LeVentNoir,10,Fri Jul 17 09:34:47 2015 UTC,Which is an interesting observation considering that the lack of comebacks in some games in the genre (LoL) and the inability to surrender out of a losing game (Dota 2) are consistently hot topics in those communities. Not to mention the more casual focused new kid on the block (HoTS) has as a main selling point that games are over quickly.  You're getting close to trying to have your cake and eat it too with such statements.
truegaming,3dk7na,LeVentNoir,-4,Fri Jul 17 15:58:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you for observing this.  I am attempting to offer a design for RTS where comeback mechanics, such as overpowering static defenses compared to early game power levels (turrets in mobas), as well as the idea that you cannot cost the opponent power, only time, so instead of destroying invested resources, you deny them to them for a period of time, then they are regained, much like respawn timers in any numbers of games.  Comebacks are absolutely essential, and in a decisive victory game, you must design mechanics which encourage advantage gaining conflict without being decisive.  When RTS gets its head around non decisive combat, the genre will flourish again."
truegaming,3dk7na,Reefpirate,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:12:14 2015 UTC,"Actually Fanatic made two comebacks just last weekend in the EU LCS. So much so that a comic was made about it.  But I'm refeering to how MOBA teams don't surrender after losing the first fight and keep playing, presenting a much more hopeful and watchable experience to the viewer.  Yes, comebacks are not overly common, but the stats show that even in pro play, the team with an advantage at early game still only wins 75-85% of the time. Thats enough to keep playing instead of GGing like SC2 does."
truegaming,3dk7na,LeVentNoir,15,Fri Jul 17 04:36:00 2015 UTC,"Yep, and comebacks happen in pro SC2 all the time as well. Some comebacks are more legendary than others.   My main grievance is that the 'comeback problem' is a shitty way to start a comparison between RTS and MOBAs."
truegaming,3dk7na,Purlox,-1,Fri Jul 17 04:42:01 2015 UTC,"I found one, from 2012, which isn't the 15-25% that MOBAs have in pro games.  Lets move off that to my main point: ""The comeback problem"". An esport needs to have hope at all stages. Hope, that the person you're supporting can win. RTSs are notorious for being buildup, kinghit, and over bar the chasing everything down and systematically killing it. This is so routine and common that surrenders after kinghits are common in pro play.  The game itself needs to support comebacks as a uncommon, but not overly rare occurrence. You need to be able to be put at a disadvantage, but not have it decide the game. And for an RTS to support that, you need to change a fundamental mechanic: Losing a fight does not mean losing power. Every single esport of any note and health has this baked in. MOBAs respawn you with the same items. FPSs let you pick up weapons within seconds and you're back. Fighting games do not decrease your damage output with your HP.  RTSs from AoE1 onwards have linked your power to an irrecoverable unit, which causes disadvantages to be incredibly hard to come back from. Entertain, for a moment the idea that when a RTS unit or structure was destroyed, after a delay, you were granted its resource cost back. Now you're on the level of all other esports: You cannot cost your opponents power, only time.  And there, you have comebacks."
truegaming,3dk7na,LeVentNoir,2,Fri Jul 17 05:00:02 2015 UTC,"Not every RTS is like that though. Take something like Company of Heroes 1/2 or Warhammer 40k: Dawn of War 2 for example.  I don't know that much about CoH, but comebacks are easily possible in DoW2 and they happen regularly.  Their maps pretty much require that you fight for them or you lose, so there are engagements constantly. (Also you both start controlling pretty much nothing of the map)  I think they have phases as well, but they aren't that obvious."
truegaming,3dk7na,page0rz,7,Fri Jul 17 14:24:52 2015 UTC,"Please don't come to this forum and just tell me the idea is ridiculous without discussing why.  On to what you said... I totally agree with you commenting on the issues of SC2 it's really been well documented and discussed by figures such as Day9 and Jakatak.  You seem to ignore a game which had that story down right for an Esport (to a large degree) Broodwar. Broodwar doesn't share the mistakes in gameplay that SC2 has and that part (see things like StarBow) is something I'd assume would work in tandem with my ideas.  Your 'solutions' to a problem which was solved back in BW seem odd. By killing the chance of winning you make the excitement of watching in the early game dead, there should be the capacity for cheese. The natural defences are things that needn't be done (again... BW). Resource points are something that should be discussed and have been done well in Warhammer40K but I'm skeptical about how fun it is to be forced to go to X point, it constrains rather than frees strategic choice. Day9 discusses it within the link of my main post for a different blog.  All of these discussion can work alongside my comments, so the discussion is how relevant the idea of a team play RTS game is to helping make RTSs succeed as an Esport (assuming they can work as a proper Esport - which requires sustained popularity)."
truegaming,3dk7na,LeVentNoir,-4,Fri Jul 17 03:43:35 2015 UTC,"I'm convinced your mindset has been poisoned by high level RTS to the point where you're fundamentally incapable of seeing obvious facts.  Hear me out.  I am a Casual RTS Player. You need to win me, and enough like me, to fill the bottom of your pyramid of esports. You make it hard or mess with ""the fantasy"" and I leave your game, you lose. The fantasy of RTS, for the entire history of the genre has been: You, a commander in charge of an army, smashes it into the army of another commander. Notice anything about teams in there? No. RTS is best 1v1.  If you want me to handle the mental load of running an RTS army, and teamwork on a MOBA level, you've failed both the fantasy and making the game too hard for casuals. Either one of those two tasks is hard enough. So, there you are, without a casual base, you lose.  I'll throw your discussion a bone: We talk about what would make a good 1v1 RTS.  You make reference to a game as if I have a deep knowledge of high level play of it. Thats absurd to assume, it's 17 years old. What I do know of broodwar was that it was nearly perfectly balanced, with very limited top tier strategies and was all execution focused rather than strategically focused. It's a blight. It fails to fulfil the RTS fantasy, as the tech is shallow, the game is cheeseable, and the maps are very poorly designed. Much like the sequel.  Now, lets jump back to my opening statement: You're incapable of seeing things.  You attempt to pathetically claim that no chance of winning early makes early game dead. DOTA and LOL both say fuck your dying little game and genre. Refering back to my original post, point two, you don't decrease in power, which means you can have engaging, watchable, and meaningful fights early game which grant advantage, but don't decide the game.  And then you ask for the capacity of cheese, something which makes casuals desert your game in droves, just ask how AoE3 is doing compared to AoE2? Thats right, adding cheese kills RTS. Whats more, it throws off the game pacing and phases, killing esports. Nobody watches matches over in 5 minutes from cheese. Most dissapointing esports was one barcraft where some guy cheesed 5 matches in a row and the grand masters was decided in about half an hour all up.   You claim BW didn't need static defences, but assumed that simply referencing a 17 year old game was enough of an argument. Games with single points of victory need to start games with enough intrinsic defenses that players are simply unable to reach this before the game pacing dictates it should be reachable. MOBAs do this, but also look at Supreme Commander and Planetary Annihilation: Your starting commander unit is strong enough to let you get up your army without insane APM or being cheesed. Esports which don't have a single point of victory (fighting games, fps, etc) can allow decisive play because you have to accumulate victory there.  You attempt to argue that placing points of power and interest on the map constrains strategic choice, but your vision is blurred by high level SC2, where you think of expansions and how expansion timing and placement is a large strategic component. Think more like MOBAs where the minion waves are the resource, and you are simply forced to harvest there, but that has little to no impact on the strategy of the game. It's what you do there, or the timing of such power that makes it interesting. Imagine an RTS where the resources were spawned in lumps, at various points on the map with offset timings. Would you surrender point 1 and secure point 2? Contest both? Split your forces? Yes, you have to go there, but it generates conflict and thus, fun.  And finally, you attempt to ruin my casual RTS fantasy and the ability of me to play the game with allied humans, which means again you lose on the popularity front.  An RTS with high unit variety, where the game had capturable resource points, which promoted conflict and granted advantage without outright wins, which had defined game stages of power, where defences started off better than units but got outscaled, and had a good tech tree and large armies... man it would be great.  WarZone2100 although old and dated has a large number of the features which create a good RTS. It lacks comeback mechanics and the pacing isn't suited for pick up matches, but it's a much better candidate than anything made by Blizzard."
truegaming,3dk7na,page0rz,7,Fri Jul 17 04:19:47 2015 UTC,"You are kind of talking in circles here.  First, whether you like it or not, Brood War was a successful esport--arguably the best there's ever been. It clearly didn't need to win you over to accomplish that, because the fantasy of Starcraft esports is not your fantasy of casual RTS. The fantasy is beating an opponent and being the best, and the game is just the medium through which that's accomplished.   That's not to say that Brood War is necessarily the answer. That game was lightning in a bottle, and it's possible--even likely--that it can't happen again.  Second, your ideal RTS seems to already exist, to some degree, in many forms. Yet, none of those games are even competitive, let alone nearing an esport. It's difficult to buy the point that RTS would be so much better as esports if they did XYZ, when every RTS that does XYZ fails as an esport.  Third, and this is just to clear things up, Brood War's maps were not poorly designed. In fact, one of the major things that people complained about in SC2, at least at first, was that the maps weren't as good as those in Brood War. The top-tier strategies were not all execution focused, either, because Brood War regularly cycled maps out. Once a map had been solved to the point where no more new strategies were coming, and it did start to come down purely to execution, tournaments would drop it and add a new one. A new map meant new strategies, new strategies meant new counter-strategies, and so on. Competitive Brood War lasted for a decade, and that wasn't a decade of playing Lost Temple and The Hunters."
truegaming,3dk7na,LeVentNoir,-2,Fri Jul 17 04:59:19 2015 UTC,"the fantasy of Starcraft esports is not the fantasy of casual RTS   Sorry, you just insulted the casual playerbase. Your game is dead without anyone playing it.  There is not a single successful sport in the entire world, digital or otherwise where the fantasy of casual and professional play is not perfectly aligned.  MOBAs have it, FPS have it, Rugby has it. RTS does not, which might explain why the genre has no esports presence, and why it's so unpopular right now given the hamfisted attempts to push one against the fantasy of casual players.   RTS would be so much better as esports if they did XYZ, when every RTS that does XYZ fails as an esport.   But I do have to ask, please, tell me exactly which RTS were a: casually popular enough to support a possible e sports scene, and b: had all the features needed to have healthy e sports. It'll be fun to watch because you can't name a single one where losing a fight did not cos you power, which is a crucial factor in comebacks, which are required for healthy esports."
truegaming,3dk7na,page0rz,5,Fri Jul 17 05:09:24 2015 UTC,"The answer to both of those has already been stated many times: Brood War.  Whether you like it or not, it was a successful esport.  You can't keep saying, ""sorry, you lose,"" when it's been demonstrated in the real world that it worked just fine.  Besides that, even Starcraft 2 did just fine as an esport. Compare it to your other genres, your fighting games and FPS, and it stood up to them. Its only problem is in relative numbers compared to the biggest kids on the block, or, I suppose, Brood War itself.  You're the one dictating all these special rules about what an RTS needs to be casual and an esport. Brood War doesn't do what you think it should casually, but was fine as an esport. All your casual games don't work as esports, though. You want to say that the problem is with Brood War, when it could just as likely be that the game you think would be the perfect RTS esport by catering to casuals doesn't actually work the way you want it to, since all the games that do what you want don't work as esports."
truegaming,3dk7na,Seveneyes7,-1,Fri Jul 17 05:27:02 2015 UTC,"Note the past tense. Brood war is done, and the sequel is in death throes. Why? Because SC2 is losing players, not gainging them. A mere ~200k active accounts, 6 months ago, down from 1.5 Million at patch 1.1  It's gone, it's past, and it only took 5 years.  Of course, games like counter strike global offensive, which is pretty much the same core game as came out in the '90s is still going strong.  Because when I play CS, I play to shoot people and place / disarm bombs. This also happens to be the best way to play to win. Fantasy and optimal play line up == Casuals are retained and drawn into the pro scene.  Then we have RTS, where the fantasy of amassing a massive army and crashing it into your opponent isn't anywhere near the best way to win, and so the entire genre is a weak shriveled husk.  You keep saying ""All your casual games don't work as esports, "" I'm not the one trying to push an RTS esport, I'm totally uncaring about if one makes it or not.  I'm actually saying ""Your Esport needs to work as a causal game"". I'm just trying to show what you need to have to have a good casual RTS, that means less / no APM focus, comebacks, and big old armies."
truegaming,3dk7na,instantiatedObject,4,Fri Jul 17 06:09:25 2015 UTC,"You admitting that you're not trying to push an RTS as an esport is the first valid point you've made, and you should have started and ended with it.  I can tell you that, as a casual Starcraft player, my fantasy is not, and has never been, to mass a big army and crash it into my opponent's. But I suppose you're going to tell me that your idea of what a casual RTS player wants--and bearing in mind that you've admitted you don't even care, and you probably don't particularly like the genre--is more valid than mine. Sure.  Because Brood War is past tense means nothing. It still shows that a game that is nothing like you think it should be can succeed, both casually and as an esport. Make all your proclamations about how it's not enough, but Brood War is one of the most beloved games of all time, in any genre, and pretty much birthed the entire notion of esports to begin with. Because Starcraft 2 isn't doing as well doesn't mean that it's an invalid formula, it only means that Starcraft 2 isn't doing as well.  There are also many ways to cater to casuals as well as esports that don't involve dumbing down the game, or changing its nature. Brood War did it with extensive custom maps and game modes. One of the major criticisms against Starcraft 2 is that it didn't do the same thing.   It's completely disingenuous to compare those games to Counter-Strike, which has existed across various iterations, and owes much of its current success to Skinner box cosmetic gambling. It's entirely possible that Starcraft's problem is that it can't exploit microtransactions in the same way as LoL or TF2 can.  And Starcraft 2's ""weak shrivelled husk"" is still comparable to, or stronger than, many other esports, including the fighting games you're such a fan of."

truegaming,3dk7na,LeVentNoir,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:29:47 2015 UTC,"you make some good points, but also some weird ones.  ""cheese"" is present in every game in the form of strategies that are very effective and require specific game knowledge and timely reactions in order to deal with. things like ""camping"" in FPS, grab-throw spam or button mashing in 2D fighters, or kill-lanes in LoL are all examples of what would be called ""cheese"". saying that BW is ""cheeseable"" is not a meaningful statement; you may as well say, ""the game allows for strategies that i find annoying and don't want to learn to counter"" which would be true for just about any game ever.  ""insane APM"" is relative to your opponent, which again, is true for any game out there. in many of the games you list, such as CS:GO or LoL, if all else is equal and your opponent plays faster than you, they will win. that is a part of any game that is ""Real-Time"", which again is every game you list. you only need ""insane APM"" if your opponent has ""insane APM"".  i also feel like your points about ""Casual Fantasy"" are inaccurate in that    a commander in charge of an army, smashes it into the army of another commander   is absolutely how you win in RTS, especially SC2 where individual unit micro is less pronounced. ""A-move"" compositions (as they are called) are very popular and will win you games up until Plat or Diamond, even with relatively low APM (~45 to 60). i'm not really sure where you keep getting this idea:   Then we have RTS, where the fantasy of amassing a massive army and crashing it into your opponent isn't anywhere near the best way to win, and so the entire genre is a weak shriveled husk."
truegaming,3dk7na,Kered13,4,Fri Jul 17 17:12:50 2015 UTC,"The fantasy of RTS is smashing two massive armies into each other,   The main complaint about SC2 is that the meta revolves mostly around building up a max size army and then throwing the armies at each other. This is boring for players and spectators alike. People want constant action, from start to finish. Not twenty minutes of buildup followed by a one minute fight to end the game.   Well balanced esports such as I dunno, Quake had these features.   Haha, you know nothing about competitive Quake. Competitive Quake is the most lopsided game ever if the players are not very close to even. If one player is 10% better than the other, he takes map control, denies all major items, and wins the match 10 to 0. Getting back in control after dying can take 2 or 3 minutes in a round that is only 10 minutes long, and every time you die you have to start over again.   You start with a base preconstructed   So no strategic variety.   with defenses that kick say, T1 units away easily.   So nothing interesting happening in the early game.   having units killed gives back most of the resources used to buy them   So no consequences for failure.   Resource points are hard to defend, and few in number unlike every SC2 map I've watched with room for 6!    So it's a one or two base turtle fest.   Take a look at why 40min no rush was such a favoured mode among casuals and you'll see what people actually want.   Haha, oh my god. I thought you were something like a 20 minute no rush scrub. But no, you're a 40 minute no rush n00b. That's hilarious. Have you ever considered why no competitive scene ever developed around an X minute no rush meta? No? Well you should give that question some thought."
truegaming,3dk7na,jus7addwater,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:29:58 2015 UTC,"Thats not the problem, the problem is SC2 gives you one objective, whereas games with multiple objectives each suited for phases of the game have constant conflict. MOBAs generally have tower 'rings' set up to be objectives of the early, mid and late game. There are things like the dragon buff in lol, for midgame conflict generation and Roshan in DotA2 for late game conflict generation.  You must have missed all the times I talked about lower risk / reward conflict generators for the early game.  You assume that a preconstructed base means identical bases. It could mean each player defines what they would start with before the match starts, so instead of having to perfectly micro such a crucial time, it's just there. This would of course, be savable and your saved choices could be selected from before each game. It's not hindering strategic variety, it's minimizing the impact of APM in that early stage of the game.  You attempt to claim the inability to attack bases head on leads to nothing interesting in the early game. An RTS with a properly paced game would have objectives which grant advantage placed in the neutral area of the map. For example, in CnC Generals, oil rigs were a strong resource objective which people aimed to capture, and early game fights over them were common. In AoE3, the treatures were a similar conflict generator.  You say no consequences for failure, but it's actually the principal of ""you can cost them time, but not power"". The consequence for failing is you are now behind, and have to dedicated time to catching up, or are at a lower power for a time. Anyone who knows about respawn timers in games understands how victory gives you a period of time against a weaker enemy, allowing you to control the game for a while, but they will come back.  The reason to make resource points few in number is so that each economic source, including our early game conflict generators such as oil rigs, but also, smaller expansions such as CnC:G supply dumps are fought over. In SC2, with people punching out 2, 3 expansions, with sites for another 4-5, each expansion spot is not really worth fighting over, as you can simply take another one. If they are scarce, then it's critical to ensure you gain at least equal numbers and try to attack them.  While you try to attack me, I'm actually proposing changes which make turling basically suicide, which encourage constant conflict that generates advantage without being decisive before the game phase is ready for it, and a game where you are never completely locked out of victory, you can make a comeback."
truegaming,3dk7na,Kered13,5,Fri Jul 17 10:08:35 2015 UTC,"Thats not the problem, the problem is SC2 gives you one objective, whereas games with multiple objectives each suited for phases of the game have constant conflict.   If you can't see all the little objectives that lead to the ultimate goal in SC2, then you're not very good at the game. Fighting for expansions, denying expansions, denying tech, getting upgrades. All these things contribute. If the only thing you're thinking about during the game is ""destroy the other base"", then you're going to lose.   You assume that a preconstructed base means identical bases, where it could mean each player defines what they would start with. This would of course, be savable and a variety of saved choices could be selected before each game. It's not hindering strategic variety, it's minimizing the impact of APM in that early stage of the game.   So you're going to replace the strategic depth of build orders, of having to scout your opponents build and adapt in response while denying your opponent's scouting, with a game of rock paper scissors. Your proposal has even less depth than choosing your starting race.   You attempt to claim the inability to attack bases head on leads to nothing interesting in the early game. An RTS with a properly paced game would have objectives which grant advantage placed in the neutral area of the map. For example, in CnC Generals, oil rigs were a strong resource objective which people aimed to capture, and early game fights over them were common. In AoE3, the treatures were a similar conflict generator.   Please, don't even talk about Generals. You know nothing about Generals. I have played nearly 2000 games of competitive Zero Hour. I cut my teeth on that game, and I still consider it the best RTS ever made.  Generals and Zero Hour are probably the fastest RTS games ever made. An average match lasts only ten minutes. It's speed chess for RTS. You can be in your opponent's base destroying shit in two minutes. The standard build orders for almost every matchup require selling your starting command center just to get more money. Generals is the antithesis of everything you have described, and that's why it's so great.   You say no consequences for failure, but it's actually the principal of ""you can cost them time, but not power"". The consequence for failing is you are now behind, and have to dedicated time to catching up, or are at a lower power for a time. Anyone who knows about respawn timers in games understands how victory gives you a period of time against a weaker enemy, allowing you to control the game for a while, but they will come back.   That ""loss"" of time is trivially countered by just having more factories. The only way you can make that work is by restricting the ability to increase production with more factories. But that just further reduces the depth and variety in your hypothetical RTS.   The reason to make resource points few in number is so that each economic source, including our early game conflict generators such as oil rigs, but also, smaller expansions such as CnC:G supply dumps are fought over. In SC2, with people punching out 2, 3 expansions, with sites for another 4-5, each expansion spot is not really worth fighting over, as you can simply take another one. If they are scarce, then it's critical to ensure you gain at least equal numbers and try to attack them.   You don't have to fight for direct control of resources to generate conflict over them. In SC2 you're not going to steal your opponent's expansions, but you will deny them, and that's what you spend most of the midgame doing. If you don't make a substantial effort to deny expansions, you will lose the game. Either fighting for direct control of resources or fighting to deny them can work, but they have different requirements and different implications for the rest of the game.  Starcraft has to have many expansions because each expansion runs out relatively quickly. If you only have two or three expansions per player, the map quickly runs out of money, leading to a boring end game. Expansions run out of resources quickly to prevent turtling in your starting base, but starting bases are defensible to control the effectiveness of early game rushes. All of these design decisions work together to make the game work.  Generals has few expansions. Typically two safe expansions per player, and two contestable expansions in the middle. This works because expansions last a long time relative to the short games and there are tertiary resources structures/units in the late game that provided unlimited money when the map runs out. Additionally, bases are extremely exposed, preventing turtling and allowing harassment of even ""safe"" in-base expansions.  The design of focusing on resources that must be directly controlled also makes comebacks harder. If one player controls these resources, he is simultaneously increasing his income and denying that income from his opponent. This makes it extremely difficult to take the position back. For example, in Generals if one player can hold the middle resources for more than two or three minutes, they will almost certainly win the game.  I've explained how Starcraft and Generals have different designs, but the design elements that each game makes complements it's other elements. On the other hand, your design elements are in conflict with each other. You want to encourage comebacks, but you have chosen elements that make comebacks more difficult. This is because you don't understand how RTS games work."
truegaming,3dk7na,LeVentNoir,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:14:02 2015 UTC,Save generals never made any splash in the esports world because it had a weak community that could never get the ball rolling on anything outside a sub 1K tournaments. A good game squandered by communities like gamereplays that hadn't a clue about how to grow the game.
truegaming,3dk7na,Bernabuss,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:20:26 2015 UTC,"I mean, at that time, the only RTS games that made a splash in esports were BW and WC3. But there were a lot of RTS games back then with healthy competitive communities, ZH was one of them. I don't really see how GR.org squandered ZH, if you want to blame someone then blame EA for giving absolutely no support. The GR.org management made some really retarded decisions later, especially around the time that SC2 came out, that killed their own community (along with the decline of the RTS genre). But in it's earlier days it was the best thing the community had ever seen, hosting replays, replay reviews, strategy guides, and competitive discussion. You look at what all the other community sites were doing at the time, and GR.org was amazing.  They fucked it up when they decided to promote all the different game portals as effectively separate websites. Because obviously when your audience is already declining what you want to do is split your community into five or six different pieces.  <-- One of the last remaining posters on the GR.org general discussion boards."

You're incapable of being debated, I shall leave you to be. I will however, tell you that your arrogant tone of assumed superiority is really naff, after all you're claiming professional status of a dead game in a dead genre. Then you insult a casual player, the kind of person you really should be attempting to appeal to because we are the people who drive the game popularity to allow an esports scene."
truegaming,3dk7na,LeVentNoir,5,Fri Jul 17 11:19:50 2015 UTC,To be honest you are the one that seems to be misunderstanding how RTS's work. Starcraft has it down to pretty much perfection and people who like RTS's love it for that.   You don't seem to understand the genre and it may be not your speed. I recommend you head back to LoL.

truegaming,3dk7na,LeVentNoir,2,Sun Jul 19 20:44:55 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. There are elements present but they are all spread across many games. Supcom, PA, AoE2, Warzone2100, and CnC:G have elements I really like, but sadly, rushers will play all of these games to win in the least entertaining method.  Someone in this topic said how the best way to play CnC:G was to sell command center for more $$ and win in <10 minutes most of the time.  Thats not a strategy game, thats an APM twitchfest.  My favourite RTS is one which breaks the ""base building rush"" mould so hard that most people in this thread would lose to AI: Wargame Red Dragon.  Now, I'm sure high level play for that has all kinds of tricks and tips, but the basic fact is: It's high level strategy about smashing two big old armies into each other. Rushing gets you killed, recon and strategic movement are king.  Semi ironically, removing economy and base construction lets this game focus purely on strategic battling, much like a tabletop wargame instead of the rush filled tactical spam games like SC2 which is what pass for 'strategy' these days. Since there are no bases, and resources are earned by capturing and holding a limited number of areas, conflict is common from the beginning of the game onwards.  To see more about, watch ICBMRaptor, who has a host of great videos of this game. I linked you a full gameplay video, which shows just the difference in pace and tone you can get while still having a full conflict game from beginning to end."
truegaming,3dk7na,page0rz,-1,Mon Jul 20 02:46:35 2015 UTC,"sadly, rushers will play all of these games to win in the least entertaining method.   This is the heart of the matter, at last. It's not that Starcraft is designed poorly, or in a way that's unbalanced, it's that it's designed in a way that you personally don't like.  Which is completely fine. Nobody has to like it. But that doesn't mean it's wrong.   Now, I'm sure high level play for that has all kinds of tricks and tips, but the basic fact is: It's high level strategy about smashing two big old armies into each other. Rushing gets you killed, recon and strategic movement are king.   Again, this is a completely different style of RTS from Starcraft. That doesn't mean the games you like are bad. I'm sure they're great at what they do.   But consider this: Brood War, and Starcraft 2, and even C&C, the games you don't like and think are poorly designed, are more popular (in sales and competitive play) than all those other games, including Wargame. Coincidence, or could it be that there are a lot of people that like this other, more aggressive style of RTS?"
truegaming,3dk7na,LeVentNoir,2,Mon Jul 20 04:51:51 2015 UTC,"Actually, you're missing the point: Lots of casual players enjoy playing games in a sub optimal manner because that way is most fun. They then fail to support esports because the best way to win is not fun to play, play against or watch.  Imagine, for a second, some FPS, where the person with the highest KD won. You would get 1 kill and hide for the rest of the match, on zero deaths. And thats likely how pros would play, but casuals would have fun running, shooting, killing dying, and then completely fail to support an esports scene. And then the game gets changed to further supports the 1 kill and hide playstyle, to the point where people give up on the game because what you have to do to win simply isn't why they play.  Public games become less and less frequent, as people only play with friends in the agreed casual way, and slowly the game withers and dies. You want to talk popularity? SC2 has dropped from 1.5Mil players to <200K. Thats a 86% drop in players. Why? Because people realised that they don't enjoy winning or losing. The playerbase is gone, esports is crumbling. It's not just me who doesn't like it.  But then, my ever eternal counterpoints: CS:GO and fighting games. Both are old. Both have old core gameplay. Both have very, very strong casual and esports scenes. Because the way to win is fun for casual players. What they want to do when they play is also the best way to win."
truegaming,3dk7na,page0rz,0,Mon Jul 20 05:58:47 2015 UTC,"Uh, we already have plenty of FPS where the highest KD wins, and they absolutely don't involve getting 1 kill and running away.   Starcraft 2 drops from 1.5 million to 200k, fine. That's great. But the point is, have any of these other games even reached 200k, let alone 1.5 million?   Counter-Strike I grant you, and we've gone in to detail about why and how it is what it is, but fighting games? Even now, at their absolute peak, they're not Starcraft 2, let alone Brood War. Most fighting games don't last a year, competitively or casually. It's not a strong argument.  But you are right about the casual players wanting their casual play. Which, as I've said, is a known problem with Starcraft 2. It has lousy custom game support, where Brood War had amazing custom game support. That's what the very casual players want, and what they didn't get with Starcraft 2. But that has nothing to do with the way the core game is designed."
truegaming,3dk7na,LeVentNoir,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:10:45 2015 UTC,"Name ONE FPS where highest KD wins? None. They're all objective or total frag based. Sure, the winner usually has the highest KD, but thats not why they won.  While fighting games do not need to reach the lofty heights of 1.5 million copies because they get their playerbase then keep them, I'll refer you to Super Smash Brothers Brawl, which hit, oh    By March 31, 2015, the game had sold 12.77 million units worldwide, according to Nintendo   And then the various flavours of Street Fighter 4 sold a combined 8 million units, (3.3 mil SFIV, 1.9 mil SSFIV, + assorted others). And SFV is making massive waves in gaming press atm.  Sure, they're not starcraft: They're kicking starcrafts arse so hard you didn't even know it. Why? Because casual play and pro play line up.  Oh, if it's just custom game support then why is the entire genre basically dead? Vs high profile releases in FPS and Fighting games? Because FPS and Fighting games are giving people what they want.  RTS needs to give people what they want and boom, you'll be back in the club."
truegaming,3dk7na,page0rz,0,Mon Jul 20 06:55:21 2015 UTC,"Street Fighter 4 is the best selling fighting game of all time, by a wide margin. Smash is more, if you want to call it a fighting game. They do well. Every other fighting game dies within a year or two of release, and most can't dream of selling a million copies. If we're just talking pointless sales figures, then Starcraft has sold over 11 million, and Starcraft 2 over 6 million. They're competing just fine there. Unless you only care about absolutes, in which case I suppose Smash is a complete failure because it only sold 12.77 million, while Grand Theft Auto 5 has sold over 50 million.  If you want to talk esports, Starcraft 2 has more money in prize pools than Street Fighter 4 and all Smash games combined.  If the entire RTS genre is basically dead, what does that say about all those RTS you think are better designed than Starcraft? And why is each and every one of them selling worse than Starcraft? If your point is that RTS is dying--and nobody here is disagreeing with that, the entire thrust of this topic is that it's not doing well--why do all these better designed games, the more appealing ones, do worse than the poorly designed game?  Also, what is the difference between K/D and frags? Each frag is 1 kill, and each death is 1 kill for the enemy. That's exactly how duelling and TDM work in FPS. A player with 1/0 K/D wins the game 1-0. It's not usually has the highest K/D, it's literally the highest K/D wins the game."
truegaming,3dk7na,Kered13,0,Mon Jul 20 08:15:37 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure you know how to play FPS, let alone debate a coherent line.  Just to bring you up to speed, a time limited, frag limited duel has victory triggered when the time limit or frag limit is reached.  There is no victory triggered at any point based on K/D. Do you even understand the difference between causation and correlation?  You're dismissed."
truegaming,3dk7na,meikyoushisui,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:43:50 2015 UTC,"What, exactly, do you think frags are, besides kills? A 10 minute Quake duel is won by the player with the most kills when the timer runs out. A player with a 1/0 K/D will have 1 kill and 0 deaths. That means they will have 1 point, 1 frag. Because they have 0 deaths, their opponent has 0 kills. They have 0 points, 0 frags.  What else do you think is going on there?  Your argument was that a game where the player could get 1 frag--1 kill, 1 point--and then run away would never happen in FPS, because it would be terrible. Yet that is exactly how FPS duelling has worked since Doom and Quake in the early '90s."
truegaming,3dk7na,sharknice,4,Mon Jul 20 08:46:52 2015 UTC,"I don't really enjoy team games in RTS. When I'm playing an RTS, I want  to be playing 1v1. Furthermore, 1v1 eSports have been successful in the past (Quake, BW, fighting games), and I'm sure they can be successful in the future. There are many popular 1v1 sports as well, like tennis and boxing, and FFA-ish sports like golf and track and field. So I don't see any reason to give up on 1v1 RTS."
truegaming,3dk7na,meikyoushisui,4,Fri Jul 17 03:11:16 2015 UTC,"I hate to simplify too much, but you've kind of proposed making a MOBA. MOBAs literally take all the team based elements that you're explaining here and minimize the more ridiculous parts of them like the how the entire game for the first two-three minutes is just an APM fest.  And even within mobas, there are plenty of characters who rely on RTS-like micromanagement to do well. I only play Dota2 a whole lot, so I can't speak for LoL, but in Dota characters like Broodmother (basically has an army of spiders), Chen (can make friends with neutral units in the jungle), and especially Meepo (he's basically several units at once) benefit from micromanagement.   What MOBAs succeed in is removing the ceiling created by APM wars, though. Since you only have one character to control, you'll rarely run into instances where you have too many units to be able to micro every group at once.   Another problem with team RTSs is that strategy isn't as varied as it can be in something like a MOBA. Look at SCII for example. In your 3v3 example, there are 81 possible games that can be played total. Even in 5v5 there are only 60000 or so possible game combinations that can be play. In a MOBA with 50 characters, there are  3.7*1016 combinations even assuming no two players play the same character.   Balance also becomes an issue -- remember when in the original Starcraft their was a moratorium on two Zerg players on the same team in 2v2? Since these games are generally designed for 1v1, team balance will need to be completely different.   I feel like my train of thought may have strayed a bit, but did I manage to make my point that the current designs of RTSs don't lend themselves to team play very well and that if they were changed to be so, they would just be mobas?"
truegaming,3dk7na,E7ernal,2,Fri Jul 17 04:49:22 2015 UTC,"You didn't stray at all :)  But I think you did simplify too much. It'd still be very different to a MOBA as there is base building and resource collecting, and larger unit control etc. etc. that makes for a grander scaled game.  MOBAs will always have less APM, that's just an inbedded reality. What isn't so inbedded, however, is an RTS being a team game. Btw by team I mean 3v3 where you and your allies are all a race. To use an SC2 example the balance would be a different kind of PvZ (to be made to be fair for 3v3) but would be viewed as PPP v ZZZ within current SC2 context. That would keep the variation in check. The variation comes from the different races, not from the variations of the races in a team, which would be a balancing nightmare."
truegaming,3djadm,kaijujube,18,Thu Jul 16 18:50:55 2015 UTC,Bravely Default had the option to turn encounter rates from 200% to 0% so you could choose how often you wanted to fight. There are obviously problems with this where you can just walk around looting everything but I think it is better than having a set rate.  Chrono Cross also tackled this pretty well where every enemy can be seen on the map and most can be avoided if you want to. You also only gained levels from bosses so you never really had to worry about grinding because random fights only gave loot and sometimes small stat increases. So if you didn't need anything you could just run from them.

truegaming,3djadm,freeogy,0,Sat Jul 18 14:24:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wouldn't call them random encounters either.  Chrono Cross was actually pretty ahead of its time to implement that type of enemy, and it's a system I much prefer, just throw a couple enemies onto each map and the player can choose to fight them or avoid them all they want.  Played Trails in the Sky not long ago and the system was the same, if you got to close to an enemy they'd start running after you and you either out run them or fight, later on in the game you got an item which allowed you to avoid all fights, which can be both a good thing and bad thing, I didn't fight any normal enemy on the last like fifth of the game which left me a bit underleveled for the final boss but at the same time I'm glad I did because the enemy also got really tanky and even a normal fight would take a long time."

If it's just boss fights, the boss fights aren't special. So it ought to be just enough to do that.  Historically, high random encounter rates were needed to cover over the fact that the games didn't have much content. FF1, the original, is frightfully small, literally smaller than a prose description of the game would be. Of course it needs a lot of fights to pad the game into something reasonable. But I think a lot of developers haven't thought it through entirely.  The need to make everything 3D and glorious doesn't help either... who wants to create the freshest take on threating bouncing doohickeys of doom from before the dawn of time, just for the player to defeat 3 of them in 24 seconds and never see them again? Of course we've got to fight them a few dozen times! SMT's approach of a very large stable of recurring baddies starts to look pretty smart here; it's not hard to put together another SMT game and see a dude once or twice, total."

truegaming,3djadm,retrotrinitygaming,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:49:01 2015 UTC,"I think that's an excellent point. I find it very difficult sometimes to frame gaming in a broader system of aesthetics. I'd say something like Candy Crush has elements of pen-and-paper games like sudoku, but then other huge games like minecraft don't particularly have a real-world parallel or reference point in other media. Maybe Lego, but the community aspect really sets it apart, along with the ease at which you can change your avatar and the more narrative elements.  I think though that most massive games like that tend to have a sitcom-like root to their longevity: nothing fundamentally changes in the gameplay, only your ability to affect and personalize it and a sense of a learning curve. I think the 'next big thing' might be something that bridges the gap between episodic/ quest games and more sandbox games. I think GTA shows huge potential for this and Skyrim put the first foot on the ladder (obviously with mods playing a key role).   But then so many games have a novel-like structure where you go on a journey with a relatively fixed environment and with specific 'quests' or just one main plot and that's alright, so long as it only takes as long to get to the end as reading a book or something. Maybe with more AR it will reach some kind of zennith before going into a more escapist direction but there are so many different ways the industry could go really."

It was a design choice that was used for a specific purpose. It would feel really weird if I were roaming a war torn countryside and the only time I was ever in any danger was at the boss fight. Imagine I'm playing a game where I'm infiltrating a secure base or something like that, and I can just walk around freely until I get to the boss's office. That would be silly.

truegaming,3djadm,Nachtfischer,6,Fri Jul 17 08:13:09 2015 UTC,"I bet that padding was a significant benefit of having trash fights in old RPGs, but I fear you may be neglecting some other really big purposes these kinds of fights serve:   Making the world feel dangerous. Adventure in RPGs tends to be characterized by danger, and the fact that you're at risk of being attacked while traveling or being in a dungeon makes the overworld and dungeons feel more dangerous than towns. Characters in adventure stories tend to get into trouble while traveling, and so having forests with dangerous spiders, trolls, etc. simulates that experience. Having no trash but just strong bosses gives a very different characterization to the world: it means that these things are interfering with an otherwise peaceful landscape. That's not a bad thing, but I think many RPGs with random encounters are trying to present an actively hostile wilderness to the player. Mechanically, these kinds of encounters form a separate challenge from whatever tactical boss fight may be laying in wait at the end of a dungeon: they test a player's resource management. The Dragon Quest games in particular were big on making you guess at whether you could stand to venture a little deeper into the dungeon or whether you were better off retreating to save the gold you earned. Should I use a Wizard Ring to restore this character's MP, or do I think my physical fighters will carry me through? Those are the kinds of questions that this kind of encounter can present to the player. Granted, by the time we reached the 32-bit era of RPGs resource management was often trivialized (at least on consoles, PC RPG kept this concept alive), but this is nonetheless an important role that random encounters can play. Random encounters can create different experiences for different players. This can be accomplished in quite a few different ways. For example, in Final Fantasy V one player may end up with a piece of Blue Magic that another player did not because they happened to fight more of a particular enemy and thus happened to learn it. In Fallout 1 a player's luck stat might cause them to run into beneficial encounters yielding items that another player may never see. In Pokemon, a rarely occurring monster may affect player team compositions in different ways. Basically, by introducing elements that aren't purely deterministic, the game feels a little bit different between playthroughs and even between players. Random encounters thus provide developers yet another way to make their games feel like autonomous worlds and not a Truman Show-esque experience that revolves entirely around giving the player a very specific experience. That bit of randomness can help make a player feel like they're interacting with something ""real."""
truegaming,3djadm,asifbaig,4,Mon Jul 20 18:20:35 2015 UTC,"Random encounters are done best I think when they are displayed on the map, can easily be avoided when high level enough, but would still attack you if you were under or around the same level. I believe this is what Dragon Quest IX did, but it's been a long time so I may be wrong. If you were overleveled, the enemies would be afraid of you, and thus wouldn't approach you. Otherwise, it would resume as usual. You could also attempt to stealth avoid enemies.  This system keeps it relatively balanced, and without really a grind. It lets you mow through dungeons yet still allows you to level at a regular process."
truegaming,3djadm,asifbaig,3,Thu Jul 16 23:57:27 2015 UTC,The problem isn't that encounters are random. You can make a great full game out of nothing but random battles.

truegaming,3djadm,Osmodius,3,Fri Jul 17 07:31:47 2015 UTC,"I think you're not too far from the point where you get a weapon/armor that has the ""No encounters"" ability. The random encounters get very manageable after that.  I appreciate games that allow you to set your encounter rate this way. Because when I'm playing RPGs, sometimes I'll be in the mood to grind a bit or just test out my newly learned skills on some monsters and at that point, I'd like a higher encounter rate. Other times, when I'm backtracking or just not in the mood, I'd prefer not having them at all.   I haven't played Bravely Default but another post here mentions how you can set the encounter rate to your liking and I believe that all games should offer a similar option. If devs don't want the players to abuse it then they can set guardians (or mini-bosses) at fixed points on the map and/or around valuable items that you need to defeat in order to advance/get loot.  But please, no more torture like the encounter rate in Lufia 1 (which, AFTER using a repelling item, was still slightly higher than the average rate you find in final fantasy games)."

For example, you can enforce item rarity this way -- have an item be only found by a certain random encounter, then make that item drop/steal rare and the encounter itself uncommon.  Now, you've roped a completionist into sitting there for an hour and a half trying to get the thing.  Some people actually enjoy that shit.

I would also then give a lure ability, that you can use to initiate those stopped random encounters if you find you need to grind a bit for something.  This would satisfy me, and would actually make sense, since enemies are learning you are not to be trifled with and avoid you.  Another option is, if you put enemies on the map, you also have an attack button on the map, and you can go up and hit that attack button and just straight kill them without jumping to the battlescreen if you outlevel them or have proven them trivial in some manner."

Sudennly few legionarries come from some bushes on the side of the road and head to me. One of them says that you've upset the caesar and we're here to assasinate you.

If it's simple and needed as a speed bump, try the Persona model of avoidable and quick combats. If it can be complex but simple enough for most of the game that you don't need to grind much, do the Bravely Default thing. There's a lot of RPGs with engaging combat, so much that random encounters don't feel bad (Tales of). Most encounters are pointless and shallow until you get to the boss, which can make it feel like random encounters are too high, when really the game would do better to have less combats with greater depth and problem solving."

So, I don't usually mind if games have really high encounter rates if the music is equally fast, but if it takes a long time for the music to fade in, and even longer to get to the good part, then it better let me run around long enough to hear it, because I don't want standing in place to be the only way I'll ever get to enjoy the music."

truegaming,3djadm,Child_of_1984,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:49:30 2015 UTC,"Random encounters suffer from poor pacing, among other things.  Often, random encounters:  1). Change music from current background/level music to generic combat music  2). Often change the control scheme (though not always)  3). Has arbitrary loading/animation delays at beginning and end of combat.  Also may have such delays during combat if some skill/spell/ability with a lengthy animation is used (hello, Knights of the Round).    4). Feature uninteresting/uncompelling enemies in unremarkable configurations.  In order to defeat these problems, use the background music as a part of the encounter rather than something that is antithetical to the encounter, unless the encounter is really intended to be jarring to the senses.  In dangerous places, one should expect violence, and the art/sound directing should reflect that.  Secondly, integrate combat into the standard control scheme as best you can, and make the transition into combat quick and seamless.  These goals may still be achieved in turn-based combat so long as the time-to-battle menu is kept as low as possible.  Avoid needless lag involved with showy animations.  Keeping art assets simple (or as simple as possible) may help you avoid ""hitting the disc"".  Not everyone is gaming off an SSD.  If using interesting/complex animations during or before/after a fight, arrange them so they blend into the normal flow of play instead of forcing the player to stop for no reason other than to watch them.  Finally, make random encounters do something at least vaguely interesting.  One school of thought is to simply make them harder, making players fear even the most common of encounters.  For those who enjoy instant-death attacks from random encounters, FF1's Sorcerers are just the ticket.  Others do not like the idea of having a substantial chance of wiping against a routine foe (especially ones that can reduce your chance of being able to run away from the encounter).  Others would prefer more variety in encounter arrangement, or peculiar/interesting monster special abilities that require the player to use different techniques to achieve victory."
truegaming,3djadm,Intelligensaur,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:38:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know if the music thing is necessarily a problem. I think a change in background music can give the impression that a routine path can sometimes have unexpected ambushes. Certainly the mood changes between simply walking along a path and being in a fight.  I mean a lot of games do use consistent background music in dramatic scenes to great effect and I love it when that happens. I just don't think this is a catch-all law of design. Having battle music serves an easily identifiable purpose. The fact that it's not always appropriate doesn't mean it's never appropriate.   For example, if I've got pretty dangerous cave music going on I don't necessarily need a separate battle theme. However, if I'm walking on a road back to a town from a cave I think it makes sense, because flavor-wise the road is supposed to be at least relatively safe."
truegaming,3djadm,Nickoten,0,Mon Jul 20 18:41:20 2015 UTC,"Random encounters is an artifact of old CRPG and TTRPG games.  With CRPGs, they're meant as a way to farm GP and XP to become more powerful, which simply means walking back and forth in some grass patch.  With TTRPGs, they're supposed to indicate that the world is living and progresses without the characters, but most GMs forget that and treat them as a random combat generator.  Some CRPGs have moved away from the pure random encounter paradigm, and to a system where they're random but you can generally avoid combat involving them.  For example, The Last Remnant allows you to run past enemies, or instead perform a maneuver that allows you to fight as many as possible in one large epic battle - and this along makes the plain random encounter system used by other games look primitive in comparison."

Are we trying to artificially extend the gameplay by forcing people to grind?  That's garbage.  But giving people the option to grind, is a different animal.  Especially with the increasingly open worlds, sometimes they have to, sometimes they don't.    IMO, random encounters are as useless as the credit counters you got on arcade ports.  They don't help anything.  The're only purpose is to increase play time.  To make people feel like they got their money's worth.  We don't live in that world anymore, the arcade is not the model everyone needs to live up to.  People fully accept that a game can have a complete start, middle, and end, and last 20 hours.    Well, everyone but the JRPG market has accepted it.    TLDR: How often is too often?  Ever.  Random encounters are a thing of the past, they serve no purpose anymore."

Typically, progression in these games is planned in such a way that traveling to the next area levels you up just enough to be able to strategize your way through boss battles and the like. Grinding is for people who don't pick up on the strategy, lack the reflexes the game expects (in a more action-oriented title like the Tales games), or who just feel like headbutting their way through the game with auto-attacks.   It's a different way of approaching dynamic difficulty: The better you do, the faster you progress through the game, and the more challenging the game gets. The worse you do, the more experience you soak up grinding, making the game gradually easier until it's more manageable. And once you cakewalk through a section or two without grinding, the difficulty picks back up to what it's meant to be, unless you actively decide to make it easy again with more grinding."
truegaming,3dhtjs,tabbouleh_rasa,23,Thu Jul 16 11:42:19 2015 UTC,"I like my games to have some tactical foundation. Something in the spirit of Fallout1/2 is enough though. And I don't think it needs to be too balanced. On one side, while for the whole story put together you want your fire mage to be as reasonable as the sniper they don't need to be for every situation. And if you offer enough choices having some imbalanced choices is fine too. For example in Fallout 1 playing a sniper was way way better for low level and mid level characters, but for the end game characters close combat chars were better off (or heavy weapon or laserguns). For me that's quite okay, because this way I can experience the game in very different ways.  Even if one approach is way worse than most others you will always find players who want to play it. For example there are players who play (played?) Diablo 2 with a single save file and only the stuff they found on their way. They never bought in shops, never used crafting/enchanting, never used gambling. The game wasn't designed for that. It's very hard to do it. But that's exactly why people do it.  Balance is necessary if you want to get two players to fight each other, like it is possible in Banner Saga I think. But for single player imbalance can add to the fun."
truegaming,3dhtjs,erikb85,11,Thu Jul 16 14:10:58 2015 UTC,"Unbalanced characters in single player games also work well as a difficulty system.  For example roguelikes often have different character classes so the players who haven't won before play the easy classes  (something like Minotaur Berserker or Dwarven Valkyrie) and the players who already beat the game play the hard classes (like Tourist or Wanderer). This also adds replay value.  Playing a technologist in Arcanum is also considered ""hard mode"" by the fans."
truegaming,3dhtjs,sir_pirriplin,2,Thu Jul 16 15:14:29 2015 UTC,"But see that's exactly the other side of the coin now that you mentioned Arcanum - Arcanum was super unbalanced and therefore UNfun for the player who wanted to go technologist! - and in fact quite unfun for the player who went mage since then the combat in the game becomes trivially easy. Not to say that Arcanum wasn't fun at all but the combat was definitely not the main highlight. I speak with experience, as the very first playthrough I picked a mage and my first spell that I chose was... Harm! The most broken OP spell in the entire game. I never needed to use any other spell. I believe I spammed Harm right up until the final boss. Whereas my gunslinger characters had trouble getting past Shrouded Hills.  For a game that presents both tech and magic as equally powerful forces from which to draw from to empower your character, it severely failed in delivering that fantasy because tech sucked. Tech sucked HARD. Tech was about scrounging up garbage to build garbage because all the good schematics were at endgame and required ingredients that were really hard to find, when magic was all about nuking foes starting from level one at the cost of some fatigue and progressing to the point where you can teleport across the map instantaneously. Tech should NOT have been ""hard mode"", that is just a straight up flaw in Arcanum's overall design: a balance issue."
truegaming,3dhtjs,sir_pirriplin,2,Fri Jul 17 05:45:50 2015 UTC,"I played a technologist whose first skill was making molotov cocktails. In the early game, that's more OP than harm.

truegaming,3dhtjs,retrotrinitygaming,2,Sat Jul 18 00:31:43 2015 UTC,"Imbalance can add to the fun just as it can take it away. If you roll a character that ends up being significantly weaker than you expected/wanted it leads to frustration. While it is possible for expert players who have played the game enough to understand it in and out to want to challenge themselves by deliberately gimping their character like in your example regarding Diablo 2, this usually requires the player to have already played the game a LOT just to survive and by then we can be rest assured that the player is a fan, and that the player is enjoying the game. But when designing a game, you can't just assume your game is going to be as successful as Diablo 2.  In fact, Diablo 2 is a great example to talk about as an exemplar of well balanced game design. Diablo 2 was EXTREMELY well balanced. Even if some classes had the edge on PvP (Hammerdins) other classes had the edge on solo PvE (Necros) and when it came time for everyone to party up and gangbang Baal 200x for epic loot, EVERYONE contributed. EVERYONE felt like they had a role to play: the Paladin and Barbarian tanked it, the Amazon, Sorceress, Druid and Assassin nuked it, the Necro supported with curses and offtanks. The game was patched and patched again and finely tuned to make sure everyone had a powerful Unique that they would want to claim for their character, to make sure all abilities felt sufficiently powerful and held their own against the monsters. I am pretty sure that this balance was the reason for Diablo 2's success in the first place which therefore lead to the people who played it a lot doing that unbalanced single save file run you talked about: but the game was never designed to be played that way.  Here's an example of poorly designed imbalance, using Fallout 1/2: what if you tried to specialize your Fallout 1/2 character around Throwing? Yeah, Small Guns, Unarmed, Energy Weapons and Melee are great and all but Throwing is an equal among them because they are all combat skills. And Throwing was gimped out of control. Did you ever put any points in Throwing? Sure it helped you aim frag grenades but that was about it. Putting points in Throwing was a complete waste.  Party based games just compound the problem since you have more characters in the mix. If you play an encounter balanced for five party members but one of your party members is gimped to the point where he isn't contributing as much as he should, then the encounter becomes way too hard. At least with encounters balanced around a single solo character there is usually a tighter range of difficulty, or some sort of alternate path like stealth, but with a larger party the fights have to become much bigger in order to fully engage the range of available combat capabilities. You end up having the opposite problem where to balance against the player not having the optimal strategies all the fights become way too easy.  I think the perfect example of this problem can be seen in Pillars of Eternity. To start with, when it's just your starting character, the game feels impossibly difficult. But then once you pick up Eder, Durance, Kana Rua, Sagani and Aloth, the game becomes a reasonably engaging difficulty. However, if instead of picking up the provided companions you design your own mercenaries then the game becomes a cakewalk because the truth is: the companions are gimped! They are given suboptimal stats and abilities. But even with the normal party, eventually the game just gets extremely easy with time because of the fact that the developers couldn't be sure just how many of the optional side quests have been done and how many of the hidden items in the optional megadungeon have been recovered by the player at that point, so they had to err on the side of caution. Because the game was balanced around essentially the lowest common denominator, the only time the game has a somewhat engaging difficulty is near the beginning. You can try tuning the difficulty up at the end to add more monsters to fight in each encounter but it never significantly changes the core tactics employed. And you can deliberately gimp yourself but either way just completing the optional side quests is enough to hurdle you over the difficulty curve, and the idea of gimping yourself by deliberately not touching certain content just seems... well it's like deliberately limiting how much of the game you're actually going to play, right?  It's a double edged sword. While on one hand it is extremely satisfying to devise your own overpowered and imbalanced combo of abilities and watch the chunks fly, if you end up having to use that same combo again and again simply by virtue of it being the most efficient course of action then it can get stale. And on the other hand while it is extremely satisfying to be able to pull through an encounter with almost impossible odds through sheer cunning and guile, it feels forced and artificial if those impossible odds only came by the way of the player deliberately gimping themselves instead of through the game itself. Worst of all is if you can't beat those odds: the feeling of smashing against the rocks again and again when it comes to a frustratingly difficult encounter is what fuels the infamous ragequit, and while a game like Dark Souls thrives off of that feeling it is also extremely well tuned in terms of balance and most of all the game mechanics are very fair. With Dark Souls you can be assured that with enough practice one day eventually you will get it, whereas in the case of RPGs where you have random number generation which feels arbitrary, and breeds frustration, helplessness, and resentment."
truegaming,3dhtjs,Mephil_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:23:05 2015 UTC,"Diablo 2 was not extremely well-balanced.  It required numerous patches to iron out balance problems, not to speak of the balance issues that cropped up when they added Lord of Destruction.  The final product was a game that frequently required hard-to-get equipment/rune words just to deal with all the immunities in Hell mode.  It sucked for solo Sorceresses.  What's funny is that before the first series of nerf/balance patches, ""tweaker"" Sorceresses dominated the game by spamming Frozen Orb.  Then there were the Whirlwind/Iceblink Barbarians . . ."
truegaming,3dhtjs,StaticScreen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:35:35 2015 UTC,"Hmm, fair, Diablo 2 was not extremely well-balanced, but just the fact that there were so many patches released meant that there was a commitment to balance, which obviously the multiplayer nature of the game necessitated. As a casual Diablo 2 player instead of a hardcore Diablo 2 player I don't think I ever made it past Nightmare, so I can't judge how imba things were in Hell mode near the end. But I was definitely around for the OP sorcs and barbs.  In any case I think we can all agree that Diablo 2 was much more well-balanced than Arcanum."

truegaming,3dhtjs,StaticScreen,3,Thu Jul 16 14:32:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think you've really thought this through. Balance has always, and will always, been important in games. WoW did not invent balance in games.   Take something basic like PacMan. Would it have skyrocketed in popularity if the PacMan went half his current speed and the ghosts moved at twice their current speed? Probably not. There's a point where imbalance isn't fun.  I'm not saying that every game should be super fair on the player. Every game needs his own individual balancing and sometimes the game is better when things are stacked against a player. But saying that balance is a new thing really isn't true at all. Balance has been a part of games before video games ever existed."
truegaming,3dhtjs,Dronelisk,8,Thu Jul 16 19:18:23 2015 UTC,"Context is important, I think. /u/Mephil_ was obviously speaking of computer RPGs, where balance has always been the first thing you throw out of the window for the sake of fun.  As soon as the thing came online, roleplayers were replaced as the target audience by clueless munchkins and hardcore minmaxers with a public. ""nerfing"" was never, ever a problem, and neither was cheating.  It started before WoW, though. I'm not sure when exactly, I personally discovered that balance was something during my Diablo 2 days, and it's always been something I completely ignored. I was among the people /u/erikb85 mentioned, playing iron man hardcore low level pacifist fistfighting no-ability and whatnot (cooperative friendlyfire and ""using only green items"" was some of the most fun online gaming I ever did).  Balance is cool, but it's just for one particular target audience, that happens to be the huge majority. For some (including myself in case I didn't make that clear enough :P) it's just a mildly interesting detail."

Nowadays games try to make everything ""fun sized""."
truegaming,3dhtjs,MCMediocrity,7,Thu Jul 16 22:01:48 2015 UTC,"I'm playing through Divinity:Original Sin, but the difficulty gating is really annoying me. It becomes a case of ""aimlessly wander around avoiding the current plot, trying to find an area suitable for my level"".   I quite like the way Shadowrun returns handles the issue. You have a single character over which you have complete control, and whom you can shape according to your vision, and then you select party members to bring along, with the NPCs taking care of their own levelling. So you have enough control to influence the game (e.g. a Shaman will play very differently to a Street Samurai or hacker), but you still have a baseline combat capability (provided by the NPCs) to fall back upon."
truegaming,3dhtjs,HumerousMoniker,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:15:45 2015 UTC,Yeah. I also greatly enjoy the Shadowrun video games (havent played the pen&paper). I liked the adia where you have a character that you have complete control over and then picking characters to your team to cover up the weaknesses of your main character. But even then I felt like I couldn't do everything and some missions had to be played differently depending like if you had a decker or a sorcerer or a big muscle guy with you which I greatly enjoyed.   Everyone in the games was pretty much a ranged combatant but having even a single melee focused team mate was great (Like Glory for an example in Dragonfall) to force the enemy AI to use up AP to move away from them creating you a lot of space.   I think the games did a very good mix of the two different design approaches OP discussed about.
truegaming,3dhtjs,bw13187,8,Sun Jul 19 23:50:09 2015 UTC,"Great write-up, something I'd never really considered before. I'd always just lumped these types of games together into one category as a teen playing them: Western/PC RPGs. But thinking back to two of my favorites, Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale, they were very different in terms of play style and difficulty, despite running on the same/similar engines. It's hard for me to choose a favorite between the two types of isometric RPG, though. RPing a single character in Fallout 2 or Baldur's Gate was an amazing experience, but the thrill of combat with an entire party I've carefully crafted is equally satisfying."

truegaming,3dhtjs,ThiefOfDens,4,Thu Jul 16 21:46:40 2015 UTC,"I think multi party games with skill checks are stupid.  Case in point: Pillars of  Eternity and those fucking traps.  However every time I bring it up I'm downvoted to hell and back by people that are like hurrr durrr it's always been a part of this type of game!  Okay, so they are trivialized by two things, neither of which is fun. Clicking a button to allocate skill points, and walking slowly. Wow, so much awesome gameplay there. You aren't making interesting decisions, you aren't making tradeoffs, you aren't really doing anything except walking around slowly. It sucks dick and it ruins a good thing in this game, fast mode for quick walking.  You can't quick walk or your mage will get 1 shot by traps.  It's so stupid and pointless to have in the game. They bring NOTHING to the table. It's the equivalent of playing a tabletop RPG and every 2 steps saying, ""I look for traps. I look for traps. I look for traps.""  There's a reason a good DM would only let you roll once per room for traps, because otherwise it's binary and stupid and UGH i hate this fucking game over this.  So that's my vote. I think skill checks are fucking stupid and bad because 99% of the time it's either you allocated the point or you didnt--there's no actual gameplay.  It's supposed to be an abstraction, right? Well that only makes sense in a group setting, where you roleplay about one party member having the stat and that one party member feels good. In a single player game there is NO POINT."
truegaming,3dhtjs,Epistaxis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:53:34 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what I mean by the ""blandness"" I mentioned in Wasteland 2: the skillchecks feels like arbitrary hurdles that you have to pass that you have no way to account for.  But the thing is, if you are presented with a single player open world RPG I think the mechanic works really well. In Pillars of Eternity, those dungeons are essentially a railroad and those traps are obstacles that you HAVE to pass, no matter what. If you don't disarm them you just trigger them and take tons of damage.  But in open world single player games, usually there are optional areas that sometimes can only be passed if you designed your character that way. A deadend corridor littered with traps might lead to any other character with no traps disarming skills to just skip it entirely, but what if the one character who skilled up in trap disarming decided to explore down that corridor and discovered a powerful artifact hidden in a chest at the end? Wouldn't that feel good to the player who decided to invest in trap disarming in order to discover this secret path that other players might not have found?  It's exactly like in the situation you presented on the tabletop except it's translated to a single player game. It's just that instead of a shared narrative with a group you are discovering your own personal narrative in a simulation that provides for many, many possibilities. These kind of designs lead to no two playthroughs ever being the same since the capabilities of the character designed not only reflects the player's choices, but completely shapes the character's journey in the game.  Of course this is hinged on the fact that the game must absolutely be non-linear for it to work. And I completely agree that when you have a largely linear game with skillchecks it just... yeah it sucks."
truegaming,3dhtjs,Wulfenbach,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:36:15 2015 UTC,"I totally agree about the single player thing. That's when it brings it back to that one specific player, in this case, you, feeling better about what you've  abstractly built your character to do. Compared to a party game where it's like, well I need to make sure I have all the bases covered, and then what's the point?"
truegaming,3dhtjs,Lord_of_Rain,3,Fri Jul 17 13:05:40 2015 UTC,"This gameplay can get quite tactical too, but it usually boils down to the same mechanic again and again, such as the Ambush/Overwatch mechanic in Wasteland 2/X-Com/Jagged Alliance. Any additions to the gameplay depth usually come from interesting movement capabilities like the Archangel Armor in X-Com.   Ambush/overwatch/fire-and-movement is what works when you're fighting with guns or gun-like weapons.  That's more of a feature of the nature of projectile combat than it is a problem with the way games represent it."
truegaming,3dhtjs,arstin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:50:57 2015 UTC,"That's also what I'm trying to say is that when a skillcheck heavy game has to integrate tactical combat, they usually just fall back and rely on the tactical nuances of projectile combat and all it entails. When you have a combat system with ranged attacks they are almost always superior to melee attacks, and therefore everyone ends up doing the same thing. Like they say, ""Don't bring a knife to a gun fight"".  This works when you want to emphasize the character skills but want to keep characters overall competent in a combat situation, but it does reduce the uniqueness of your characters when it comes to combat since everyone is just running around firing guns. You don't have, say, a mage who is casting protection spells on a tank who is aggroing enemies with a taunt while setting up flanking attacks with a rogue who is stealthed in the shadows, instead you have a much harder to describe situation that relies on angles, terrain, cover, %hit chances, etc. but when it comes down to it the characters are interchangable (I mean other than range and damage type, what is really the combat difference between your rangers in Wasteland 2? usually I just give everyone assault rifles anyway...), it's just their position and the context in which they are fighting which changes.  Like I said, in this way combat itself sometimes collapses into a kind of skillcheck itself because in these games sometimes you are just confronted with ""Can my gun do more damage than their armor?"" because sometimes no matter how well your tactical positioning you are just confronted with an enemy that is too hard. Or sometimes, this situation just never arises because you will always find a gun to match the power level of the current enemies, which in effect just makes everything kind of... static. I think this is especially true of Wasteland 2 because so much of the game is more linear than you think because the areas of difficulty are essentially gated by the radiation zones, which keeps you to a strict path."
truegaming,3dhtjs,retrotrinitygaming,2,Fri Jul 17 06:49:33 2015 UTC,"Contrast that to the game that probably most inspired Wasteland 2: Fallout 2.   Uh...  But anyway, I think solo vs. party RPGs just inherently lead to different approaches here. When you only have one player character, she has to make some choices about specialization, and this restricts which skill checks she can pass. The standard solution is to implement multiple different ways of solving each quest, so every playthrough can get access to that content (because otherwise it's wasted, I guess). If you have a party, you have access to a wide array of skills, so offering you solutions based on different skills isn't super effective, because they're pretty much all available. It becomes the opposite: a test of how well you've balanced your party.  I like both.  They do open up the game to different concepts of choice, though: in the solo game, you have a lot of choices about who your character is going to be. In the party game, you're basically compelled to balance everyone so all the skills are covered (though there are still interesting combinations), which leaves the decisions in the plot instead of the character-building. A good solo game can still do both, like Deus Ex, while a mediocre party game might do neither, like Fallout Tactics."
truegaming,3dhtjs,sumg,2,Thu Jul 16 23:39:11 2015 UTC,"What I mean is in terms of gameplay. In terms of theme/setting it was Wasteland 1 which inspired Fallout 1 and 2, but Wasteland 2's gameplay is nothing like the text and menu based gameplay of Wasteland 1. If anything, it's most like Jagged Alliance or X-Com with the Ambush feature... but then that would just sound way more outlandish than what I said.  Do you think it's easier to blend both specialization and balancing into solo games, whereas party games are pretty much locked into balancing? Here's what I think could be possible: a party based RPG with skills and checks that has so many skills that even your party of 6 couldn't possibly hope to cover all of them. But then that leads to another problem you mentioned: wasted content. Most likely the same content will just be accessed through multiple solutions.  But I think it would be cool if you had a game where there really is exclusive content created just for your personal choice, and not simply the same content accessed three different ways. For example, the class strongholds in Baldur's Gate II felt EPIC because it really helped you identify more with your character and his/her growing power."

Having to giver considerable forethought into actions and having you plan of action play out sucessfully is always a rewarding feeling. I can't say I've played too many (or any) of the skill-check based RPGs so I can't say that I dislike it in anyway. But games like Final Fantasy Tactics and recently Massive Chalice are among my favorites. I used to play a game when I was younger called Laser Squad Nemesis along these same veins, wish I had that still! But anyway, I hope the Genre is heading into a merger of the two styles, in a way Massive Chalice is a step in that direction, the depth of tactics combined with the individual personalities and traits of the heroes is sort of like their skills. My friend told me it is just like Xcom, but Ive never played it."
truegaming,3dhtjs,Stormdancer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:12:03 2015 UTC,"The issue is the intersection of single player games and ""role playing"" vs ""role playing"". Since the beginning, some games have strived to recreate the intimate ""role"" playing - giving the player one character to commit to. Other games have strived to recreate the larger experience of a party going out on adventure. Some games explore the area between these.  I have enjoyed games from both categories. Although excellent tactical combat will always get me through a game with little or no roleplaying, but frustrating AI combat can kill a game for me. I also almost never replay games, so while I do appreciate lot's of branching based on character and development, the effort is wasted on me. I'm perfectly fine with being railroaded through choices as long as I'm not aware of it."
truegaming,3dhtjs,kindlebluemoon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:22:58 2015 UTC,"Why would you not consider Planescape: Torment to be tactical, while including Baldur's Gate II in the list of tactical RPGs? Torment was certainly not a solo adventure, and you could pick companions and direct them according to different combat strategies.    Of course, once you discovered that Swarm Curse would kill just about everything in the game, strategy sort of went out the window."
truegaming,3dhtjs,AwesomeDewey,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:42:34 2015 UTC,"Sure Torment wasn't a solo adventure, but the story was entirely about The Nameless One. Every companion's story was all about their relation to the Nameless One, and the Nameless One's attributes (skillchecks) were crucial to uncovering extra dialogue options that would further reveal their story, upgrade the companion, and at the same time upgrading the Nameless One himself in certain cases. Baldur's Gate 2 characters were relatively more independent and not necessarily directly related to the Bhaalspawn, and there were a greater variety of companions to choose from, the reason being that Baldur's Gate 2 had a deeper combat system which emphasized more tactical party combinations.  I just wouldn't say that the combat in PS:T is good enough to be called ""Tactical"". Say what you will about PS:T, it is a brilliant game, but deep tactical combat is not one of Torment's strong points, nor was it intended to be. Just look at the design:  the Nameless One automatically resurrects every time he dies. Sometimes, dying in the right location means you can skip ahead further into the story. This was an intentional game design choice because Black Isle knew that where the game shined was in the dialogue trees, not the clunky, heavily modded Infinity Engine combat they were working with.  The Nameless One gets very overpowered by the end of the game, but that doesn't really matter. Most of the quests in the game can be solved without resorting to violence, including the end game boss fight. Enemies are just really easy to kill in most cases because they usually don't have very many special abilities and they just charge and attack you. Sometimes, single companions are so powerful when fully upgraded that they alone can solo entire levels. For example, try buffing Annah with Improved Strength, and equipping a high damage punch dagger on her like Mark of the Savant, then have her backstab the Abishai in Baator: she will one hit kill most of them.  And that's just Annah. When you add a fully upgraded Dak'kon, fully upgraded Nordom, and TNO himself on the same team, you are quite simply a powerhouse, and that's still leaving two more spaces. Many low level spells are secret OP so you didn't even need that sheer level of power, like you said: Swarm Curse.  Planescape: Torment's true magic came out in the various incarnations of The Nameless One you could play. A high Intelligence high Wisdom mage Nameless One is usually the best route to unlocking the richest content out of the game, but just in terms of the plot there are so many branching paths you could take (including becoming the Silent King of the Dead Nations, going evil and enslaving or slaying your companions, joining different factions, etc.) which means that although the main differentiation in playthroughs doesn't really come from skillchecks but rather decisions made in the game, I still chose to classify it as being closer to that type of game."
truegaming,3dhtjs,TSED,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:54:42 2015 UTC,"whereas with totally different characters in a skill check game you can encounter entirely different goals, or at least have vastly different approaches to similar goals: sneaking vs. fighting vs. diplomacy, as opposed to merely different ways of applying damage.   This is one of the major complaints that I have with many American-style RPGs, and why I tend not to like the genre.  Because the game has to be designed in such a way that many playstyles are allowed and player must be allowed to complete the game no matter what playstyle they choose, very few levels are designed in such a way that are actually interesting for any individual playstyle.   If the game does have a section that forces you into a certain playstyle (stealth, combat, lockpicking/hacking, diplomacy, etc.) in the main quest, it tends to be trivially easy in order to guarantee that someone who punted the relevant statistic can actually complete the game. The number of games that have any missions/quests that seem tailored to a particular playstyle (that would force players that didn't choose that playstyle into dabbling in it or outright skipping the mission) and would be a challenge is few, and those that do often have the missions relegated to sidequest status.    I think it tends to turn these games away from strategy, as my thought process is no longer ""What is the best method to solve this problem?"", but instead ""Where is the means of solving the problem that my character excels at?""  Tactical RPGs have their own problems, certainly.  Enemy units often have no clear AI/objectives other than ""Attack player characters if they happen to be within sight, otherwise stay perfectly still"", which can make for a much less challenging and repetitive game than a more interesting AI.  But I still prefer it to the illusion of choice that most American RPGs tend to give you."

truegaming,3djgcy,supercrooky,5,Thu Jul 16 21:06:26 2015 UTC,"I used to work in mobile game development.  During that time, I spoke with several professionals who specialized in game monetization & marketing.  The one thing they all agreed on is that if you make your mobile game premium - even if that means putting a $0.99 price tag on it - your game will tank.  There is plenty of research available online to support this claim.  Here is data posted by analytics company, Flurry, back in 2013.  Some key takeaways from Flurry's report:   Between 2010 and 2012 the percentage of apps using Flurry Analytics that were free varied between 80% and 84%, but by 2013, 90% of apps in use were free. Flurry's experts interpreted this as meaning that consumers want free content more than they want to avoid ads or to have the absolute highest quality content possible. In 2013, the average price paid for iPhone apps (including those that were free) $0.19.  The average price for iPad apps was $0.50. And the average price for Android was $0.06.  Android users apparently want free content even more than iOS users. Price experiments conducted by developers has lead to more free apps.  The percentage of free apps that underwent price testing - i.e. when a developer releases their app at one price, then raises / lowers the price for a period of time to assess user willingness to pay - rose from 61% in 2011 to 80% in 2013.  This indicates that a majority of devs who have conducted price testing have found that making their apps free lead to the most downloads.   It's also a matter of options and common sense  There is an absurd number of game apps available on iOS and Android.  There are so many that browsing through the list is a chore.  According to Flurry's data, an overwhelming number of iOS apps are free.  So when consumers are faced with an option of paying $0.99 for a new app, or looking at the ever-expanding list of free apps, more likely than not they're going to go for a free option."

It is still a massive risk and crowdfunding is basically only for games developers that have already taken the plunge and are able to push their PR to a point where people know about the game already.  I say this as a developer who hasn't crowd funded before and has yet to publish their first game, but I feel like crowd funding isn't an option for me unless I have already published a well-known game, or am half-way through making the game already and have a massive PR push using gameplay from one or two polished ahead of time levels.  The problem with the connection is that from a consumer standpoint they have no reason to trust I will deliver based on my word alone, and I totally get that. I wouldn't trust the word of some new guy with no already half-made game either. The problem is even if you have a good indie team you still have to pay for your lives, so you're still more likely to get another job instead of taking the risk that crowdfunding provides.  So in this sense the crowdfunding is to support developers that would have made the game anyway, and who have gotten the public eye anyway. The people with no money to support themselves are unchanged.  As for the ""background"" of these crowdfunded products. They push hyped animations and copied gameplay from older games under the promise that you will have as much fun as when you first played that game or that the gameplay will be as good as the art. The truth is that half-way through development the real game still won't have any of the polish that goes into making a game good, and you will never show the public the game in that form since everyone else is pretending their game is already at the point of excellent polish. All of those AAA games you see at E3 won't show gameplay because the gameplay is still shit and they had their animations team make a movie ahead of time to try to get people hyped for the game like it's already done, and that's essentially what crowdfunding requires in order to succeed.  No one should believe them, and no one should believe me or my friends when we say we want to make a good game ahead of time.

Part of the problem is sheer volume, my discovery queue has a bunch of games in it every day and I cannot possibly do much research into every damn thing that comes my way. That's not even accounting for all the early access BS and the thousand shitty f2p games."
truegaming,3de0o3,Khanstant,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:49:07 2015 UTC,Yeah steam reviews are not a reliable source of information. The overall rating is a quick poll of the ratio of users that like it to those who don't. Normally I try reading the top negative reviews to find the flaws (even on highly rated games) and decide if the pros are better than the cons.

I wrote a 7 paragraph review on a recently released kickstarter backed RPG and I focused mostly on the things I disliked about the game and why I was giving it a negative score.  The comments section blew up with a flurry of insults about how I was too much of an idiot to appreciate the game or how I was a ""clown"" for disliking certain aspects of the game.  I think my review is currently sitting at around 58% helpful.  Meanwhile, this review is currently sitting at 89% helpful: ""My dreams have come true! Finally I can role-play as a witty linguist and abuse my enemies with outrageously impertinent wordplay. Take this, thou abominable guts-griping carbuncle!

truegaming,3de0o3,zen933k,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:29:07 2015 UTC,"Give power to the people I guess.   One reason why i believe these ""reviews"" get so much attention is because they are short. You wrote a 7 paragraph review, I doubt that many people bothered to read it no matter how valid the points you brought up were. While some people might bring up really valid points in their longer reviews, the reality is that people only want to know one thing and that's if the game is good or not. I don't think shorter reviews would be as popular if it was different."
truegaming,3de0o3,skinny__panda,2,Thu Jul 16 06:19:02 2015 UTC,"But the short ones are mostly like op's example i.e. useless. It's one thing to have someone say ""game was mostly ok, no overt bugs, smooth fps, quality what you can expect from X dev"", but most of the time they're a single paragraph with zero content. Op's example tells me nothing about the game except that the guy enjoyed it. They're all like that. Useless."
truegaming,3de0o3,dankisms,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:20:28 2015 UTC,Same. I'm a verbose mofo and tend to expand on why I liked/disliked certain features.

Can still be enjoyed, but likely won't have the depth/replayability of a game which is in the 90s. 90s = guaranteed to be enjoyable if you are a fan of the genre, and much of the time even if you are not.

A lot of them are worthless, but there always some good people who give really detailed reviews. Even if they are overly positive (which is my main gripe), I can at least tell from what they say whether I would like it or not. And then I click the button for negative reviews and do the same thing, find the one or two detailed negative reviews and work out how I would feel about the stuff they are talking about.   It does have issues but it is far better than anywhere else I've seen. Metacritic is ok but is like a tiny snapshot of the steam reviews.

truegaming,3de0o3,Its_me_not_caring,7,Wed Jul 15 23:39:05 2015 UTC,The problem is not that people write those reviews - I sometimes put in one just for the sake of it being included in the ratio (90% of positive reviews etc).  The issue is that others mark them as helpful and that they show up high in the review list.
truegaming,3de0o3,Duhya,2,Thu Jul 16 06:24:04 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the people who buy the game, play it for an hour, and then write a positive review based on that and yet never play it again."

I don't know how they could implement this but I would love to see it happen.
truegaming,3de0o3,ImHidingInYourPants,2,Wed Jul 15 21:32:25 2015 UTC,Half the reviews that are voted the most useful are complete garbage. On some games that number is significantly higher and almost nobody has anything worthwhile to say unless you dog into the reviews. That being said they're honest in the fact that they're recommending the game and generally I find the ratio of positive to negative reviews is an acceptable indicator of a game's quality.  Plus I find stream reviews are good about warning me about major issues like games that have common glitches or issues with consumer unfriendly monetization systems.

truegaming,3de0o3,bearses,10,Thu Jul 16 10:48:54 2015 UTC,"Yes. I understand people complaining about the typical steam review, but you usually don't have to scroll very far to get to the actually useful reviews."
truegaming,3de0o3,king_of_the_universe,5,Wed Jul 15 16:45:44 2015 UTC,"I, too, agree. Just don't forget to intently read negative reviews, too, even if you have to change the list selector for that.  They often contain facts that are good to know, e.g. ""very repetitive boss fights"", or technological facts that might be relevant."
truegaming,3de0o3,SeattleBattles,2,Wed Jul 15 23:34:11 2015 UTC,That's what I do. I know what I like and what I don't and usually there are enough detailed reviews for me to make a call.
truegaming,3de0o3,FalseTautology,20,Thu Jul 16 09:30:34 2015 UTC,"I use the Steam reviews exactly like I use Metacritic:  Check to see if the review is Overwhelmingly Positive or Overwhelmingly Negative.  If yes, check first couple reviews for the reason.  Check dates, whether game was Early Access, time played, political agenda, etc.  If no, check first for or five good and first for or five bad reviews.  Again, check for dates, EA, time played, agenda, etc.  I find that the rating system on Steam is about as useful as Metacritic user reviews, it helps me identify games that are fucking awful or pretty damned good but anything else is going to take some effort to determine.  I especially enjoy using it on the first day to see if there are any serious technical issues.  However, I often supplement this first, cursory investigation with a cross reference on the forums/discussions, looking especially for developer comments.  This is especially important for games that had serious issues on release that were mostly resolved eventually."
truegaming,3de0o3,Mouaijin,7,Thu Jul 16 12:16:31 2015 UTC,"Bingo. If something pops up on my radar, I'll poke around and see what the overall sentiment is. If it's got loads of positive reviews, I investigate more. If it's below 30-40% positive, I'll probably drop it unless someone I know and trust (and can blame personally) recommended it. If something's hovering in the middle, I'll dig deeper and generally try to find some gameplay footage and see if it interests me.   I don't need everything I play be an unforgettable classic, but if everyone's yelling about something I'll at least check it out. Likewise, if everyone's howling about bugs, I generally figure it's a wager I don't want to make. The Steam reviews don't typically factor heavily into the decision after the initial ""Is this the worst?"" phase."
truegaming,3de0o3,Sylaris,22,Wed Jul 15 23:46:09 2015 UTC,"Usually I read the most helpful reviews to see what it is that people actually like/dislike about the game. Uplay doesn't particularly bother me, so if the main complaint was that then I'd be fine, even if the game generally has bad reviews. Also, it helps filter out the less serious or detailed reviews, that are juts a sentence or two."
truegaming,3de0o3,Moncole,3,Thu Jul 16 00:58:07 2015 UTC,The moment I stopped caring where I bought my games and stopped following gaming media my games became more enjoyable. Don't follow news or anything gaming related like release dates and your games will be more enjoyable.
truegaming,3de0o3,Reptile449,2,Wed Jul 15 15:35:50 2015 UTC,"Right? The review score and ""Humorous"" reviews aren't what you look at, you find the detailed, up to date review with a high score that gives a great rundown of the game and use that."
truegaming,3de0o3,Spazerbeam,22,Thu Jul 16 07:43:51 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen, Steam reviews are a lot like Metacritic's User Ratings. They're okay as a very rough guideline of quality, nothing more. There's a lot of fuss over the brigading of scores when the community gets pissed off, but that's honestly pretty rare.  I'm far more interested in knowing a game's return rate, but I don't expect Valve to ever provide users with that data."
truegaming,3de0o3,FCDRandy,11,Thu Jul 16 02:17:20 2015 UTC,"I have had very little satisfaction with any individual reviews on Steam or Metacritic. On both sites, everything is either a 10 or a 0, and the most visible reviews criticise the design of the game (what the user wanted the game to be) instead of the product (what the game is).  Look at any Ubisoft game and you'll see that the top reviews are almost always ""I don't like uPlay, don't buy this."". Very unhelpful for someone like me, who sees uPlay as unnecessary but not detrimental to my enjoyment of a well-made game.   For as much hate as professional games writers get for ""shilling,"" most professional reviews set aside their bias for what they wanted the end of Mass Effect to be like, and evaluate well-made and functional pieces of software on the merits of the product.  User reviews are often useless in this regard, as they measure a person's unrealistic expectations more than the quality of a game."
truegaming,3de0o3,meikyoushisui,3,Wed Jul 15 16:13:03 2015 UTC,"The problem is that reviewers try to do two very different things at once -- they try to review games from a technical standpoint (""does this product function as intended? Are there any game breaking bugs?) as well as from the standpoint of what a film or literary critic might: [this article](www.somethingawful.com/news/movie-game-review/) always comes to mind as to how well they do the latter.  Instead of reviewing games on how well they do what the developers intended, reviewers (especially amateurs) often fall into the trap of reviewing games based on how much they did what the reviewer liked."
truegaming,3de0o3,syriquez,2,Wed Jul 15 16:57:05 2015 UTC,I... disagree. MetaCritic's user ratings tend to follow along the lines of Rotten Tomatoes' user ratings. Steam's user ratings have this bizarre habit of unironically recommending everything. Or they're being so incredibly sarcastic that they just...aren't being sarcastic anymore.
truegaming,3de0o3,mishugashu,13,Thu Jul 16 01:37:30 2015 UTC,"It's as useful as any other customer review system. I generally will look down the bad reviews and see what sorta complaints they have, and decide whether or not it is valid for me, and then if I'm still interested, I'll go down the good reviews and see if what they say would be valid for me. I wouldn't say the %age of bad vs good is a good enough context to decide to buy the game. You need to actually read the reviews and make an educated decision based on what they write.  And I make sure to downvote reviews that are stupid (like ""ohohoh no pants 11/10 would buy again"") so they're not near the top.  This is near exactly the same process I use on Amazon."
truegaming,3de0o3,Genlsis,4,Wed Jul 15 20:50:45 2015 UTC,Another comment on here sparked an idea. I think the single most useful stat they could list under a game is average hours played per dollar. This would be extremely telling in my opinion and would be able to use the same scale for all games.  I'm on the fence on whether you calculate product sales as a separate figure or just use the original price despite some people paying less.
truegaming,3de0o3,RFDaemoniac,10,Wed Jul 15 17:49:59 2015 UTC,"This feature is primarily useful for people with very little spending money and lots of free time, i.e. highschool students. I thus don't see it being a priority."
truegaming,3de0o3,Answermancer,7,Wed Jul 15 17:07:13 2015 UTC,"I think the single most useful stat they could list under a game is average hours played per dollar.   Some of us couldn't care less about this metric. Like me for instance. I'd rather play an amazing $50 game that lasts 5 hours than a grindy $5 game I can ""play"" for 500 hours."
truegaming,3de0o3,Genlsis,3,Wed Jul 15 19:07:45 2015 UTC,"But that's my point, you WOULDNT play a shitty grind for 500 hours. And you likely WOULD play a good game for much more than 5. That exact preference would be captured and evident in the stat itself."
truegaming,3de0o3,faemir_work,3,Wed Jul 15 22:13:52 2015 UTC,Depends on the replayability - I've played a lot of short amazing games only once.
truegaming,3de0o3,Vhaine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:47:18 2015 UTC,"I've been asking for something similar.  I have an acceptable price point calculation that goes into each game I purchase.  It's loosely based on the sale price of a movie ticket in my area.  Say on average I'll spend 8 dollars per hour at a movie.  That's my max purchase point for normal entertainment baring something extremely unusual like skydiving or a vacation.  I know the average game time invested in FPS usually sits around 7 hours start to finish.    Thus at +56 dollars it's cheaper for me to go to the movies then buy your game.  I consider this a poor deal.  I don't purchase because I can find cheaper quality entertainment elsewhere.  It's a rational purchase base on definable rules.    Now compare Skyrim.  I have 400 hours logged for a total purchase of roughly 60 dollars.  For argument, lets say that 400 hours is an average across all steam users with enough play time not to be eligible for steams return policy.  I'm getting quality entertainment for roughly 15 cents on the hour.  That's a fantastic deal.  Even at one standard deviation off the mean, this would still be a fantastic value for entertainment based on my personal price points.  I would purchase and recommend the purchase of Skyrim over and over based on this metric alone.  In my mind this is one of the best metrics to measure a game by."
truegaming,3de0o3,Answermancer,9,Thu Jul 16 09:58:53 2015 UTC,"I see people with this mathematical approach occasionally and it always leaves me scratching my head. It only really makes sense if you're just looking for the cheapest way to kill time, and if that's what you're after there are so many things you could be doing for even less than 15 cents/hour.   Like, if I did not enjoy Skyrim, then the fact that there is 400+ hours of content in it wouldn't mean anything to me."
truegaming,3de0o3,BlueJoshi,0,Wed Jul 15 21:04:26 2015 UTC,"That.. sounds like it would be an awful idea.  So if you and I buy the same game, but I get it for 60% off and you pay full price because you missed the sale, your review is worth more?  Even if I play it for twice as long as you?"
truegaming,3de0o3,Genlsis,3,Wed Jul 15 22:40:10 2015 UTC,"No no, the data would be a single aggregate number applied to the game itself at the top. Steam knows what the price is (I would exclude sales and treat them as full price) and how long the player has put in. It simply does the calculation and includes it as a number that it averages across every player. It has no reflection on personal reviews. It's simply a stat."
truegaming,3de0o3,Doomed,4,Wed Jul 15 18:50:27 2015 UTC,"They're good, but could be better. The reviews are biased towards people who usually play that kind of game. It would be interesting to see Steam randomly assign ~250 people to play each game. Then they'd have a review percentage from a typical person. (Or, more accurately, from a typical person who is open to playing a game and writing a review.)"
truegaming,3de0o3,iketelic,5,Wed Jul 15 20:59:07 2015 UTC,"I value Steam reviews more than I do the critics at Metacritic, which is to say that I consider most of game journalism to be a joke. Guys who post on Steam reviews don't have any pressure to sell clicks. Since Steam doesn't give any scores (other than positive/mixed/negative) you actually have to read the reviews.  Certainly you have to skim past the joke reviews, but usually the top reviews give a very good and honest overview of the games. A couple of times I've been planning to buy a Ubisoft game, until the Steam reviews reminded me of Uplay. Or by some other developer who doesn't care about PC (bad ports etc) and thus don't deserve my money.  You have to pay attention to when the review was posted (it's possible that the game has been significantly updated since then) and how much the reviewer has played the game. The opinion of a guy who's put 100 hours into a game is worth a lot more to me than some journalist who played it for a few hours at a review event and was pressured into having a complete review ready for release.  Sometimes games get slammed for political reason, but if the developer is involved in any controversies I do want to know about it before purchasing."
truegaming,3de0o3,UnidentifiedFlop,3,Wed Jul 15 17:40:16 2015 UTC,Is ANY review system reliable?  Consider the steam sales that individuals pick up games on. The person who pays 10$ for the 50$ game may be more lenient by comparison to the person who payed full price. Just my two cents but I don't follow reviews too much. I use them to judge if a game has game breaking bugs and glitches and such but otherwise I will form an opinion on my own
truegaming,3de0o3,Khanstant,3,Wed Jul 15 19:35:07 2015 UTC,"No, not at all. Only Google play reviews are worst in the ""help my shitty device sucks, help even though this is a fucking review section, not support"""
truegaming,3de0o3,Vhaine,3,Wed Jul 15 17:35:28 2015 UTC,"No, and the main reason why is because of DLC and game patches.  For example, Civ V was a dumbed down version of Civ IV.  The subsequent DLC addressed many of the flaws of the original.  Now years later we're left with a much more fleshed out product.  A review at the time of release would not be nearly as relevant to it's current state as it is now.  Some games get better with time.  Some games get worse.  A review is based on a static point in game's time for which it was written.  It'd be like someone putting a lifetime mark on you at age three that says 'shits pants and likes to pick nose.'  Games are much more organic now and grow with the audience and each patch."
truegaming,3de0o3,darkapplepolisher,2,Wed Jul 15 19:43:19 2015 UTC,Is there any review system that doesn't have that problem? Steam does give you a partial workaround in that you can look at the most recent reviews.
truegaming,3de0o3,Vhaine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:49:21 2015 UTC,"No.  A review of a 2009 Chevy Silvarado Crew Cab Automatic 2WD is a review of a specific product.  There is little variability due to the manufacturing process.  The product doesn't change over time.  The only real variable is how well it's cared for.  You can see failure rates and recalls as factual representations of the vehicle's reliability and not really reviews.  So, if someone reviews that vehicle and the complaint is 'radio only has 6 preset buttons' you can assume that all 2009's of that model have the same 6 preset buttons.  All 2009's are gonna have the 6 button presets unless modded by the user.  The 2011 model may have a different radio, but that'd be like comparing Borderlands 2 to Borderlands 1.  They often aren't the same vehicle at all.  So in this example a product doesn't really change and the reviews maintain a certain greater relevance.    If you'd like an example of what I'd also consider another very unreliable review category, it'd be food.  Restaurants change their menu from night to night.  Each chef has his own interpretation of the recipe.  So the smoked salmon on monday may not bare any resemblance to the smoked salmon on Tuesday.  Unless the review has some indisputable quality (the 'salmon' is really tilapia/game uses uPlay) then the review only become less relevant as time goes on.    That is why reviews are so problematic for games.  Games like World of Warcraft are ever evolving.  The date of the review becomes extremely relevant to the reader as it may or may not in anyway be a reflection of the current state of the product being sold.  And that's why I guess steam put the Alpha review tag and sort option in.  Which I think is a pretty good start."
truegaming,3de0o3,Twin_Brother_Me,5,Thu Jul 16 05:51:34 2015 UTC,I very rarely read the reviews themselves but the most telling thing for me is the number of hours played. If someone has put hundreds of hours into a game then no matter what their review says they got some form of enjoyment out of it. If they have single or low double digits than they probably didn't.
truegaming,3de0o3,Intelligensaur,5,Thu Jul 16 13:06:42 2015 UTC,"As implemented and intended, User Reviews are completely useless. Voting that joke or 'political' complaints aren't helpful doesn't appear to change how they're weighted toward the average. Even if the system did make helpful reviews carry more weight, so many other people with 'great senses of humor' pile upvotes onto the worst ones anyway that it wouldn't matter.  The User Review system can be salvaged into something almost useful if you take the time to weed out the dross yourself, and then try to find reviews from people who seem to value the same aspects you do, but if you're going to put that much effort into it you could be checking Reddit or wherever else."
truegaming,3de0o3,tiofrodo,2,Wed Jul 15 16:12:20 2015 UTC,"It is a good thing because the more information on a game the better it is in exposing things to the public, and maybe there is people out there that does not want a game that has to be played with Uplay, something that i guess would normally be left out of other reviews in gaming sites. You can also find reviews from people with similar taste as yours and see what they think of the game. Anything that can help the costumer make its choice is good."
truegaming,3de0o3,madcuntmcgee,2,Wed Jul 15 17:10:19 2015 UTC,They're good as a rough guide but so many of them are hacky jokes or people submitting reviews that are positive or negative for reasons other than the quality of the actual game.
truegaming,3de0o3,InnerStarvingDemon,2,Wed Jul 15 15:42:38 2015 UTC,"I find the user review system good not for determining whether a game is good, but for determining whether a game is bad. If the reviews aren't mostly positive, then it's almost definitely shit. If the game gets good reviews, then it might possibly be good. If not, it's not worth investigating further."
truegaming,3de0o3,NotScrollsApparently,2,Wed Jul 15 18:10:44 2015 UTC,"I find it that the most reliable way of judging a game's quality is hours played. If the top review gives it 9000/10 but only played like 5 hours before getting bored / giving up, I'd say that the game isn't worth my money.  If there are multiple negative reviews from guys with 800 hours, then I know I'm gonna get valid criticism on the game and can decide whether that's something that would put me off the game.  For example: check Elite Dangerous reviews. 78 % positive. However, all the top reviews have maybe 100 hours on average of game time, which is extremely low (in my opinion) for an MMO game with such a pricetag. Furthermore, if you check the negative reviews there are some with ~500 hours of gameplay that give a long and detailed explanation on why this game is not recommended even though they invested that many hours (and which is something that I find is very similar to things people say on reddit about the game).  So.. a tl;dr - I only read reviews of people with lots of gameplay hours. Just ignore all the <10 hours reviews because even if they aren't jokes, they aren't familiar enough with the game to give any sort of review."
truegaming,3de0o3,Snugrilla,2,Wed Jul 15 18:18:30 2015 UTC,"I actually just look through the negative reviews and see if any red flags are raised there.  And by ""red flags"", I mean, legitimate criticism.    It's pointless to look through the positive reviews, because users will usually not criticize something they spent money on unless they're absolutely furious about it."
truegaming,3de0o3,ExplosionSanta,2,Wed Jul 15 18:30:40 2015 UTC,"Well, since games journalism has completely and utterly shit the bed, they're about the best thing I have now.  One thing I'll say in favour of Steam Reviews is that they don't try to pass off pretentious wank as enjoyable gameplay experiences."
truegaming,3de0o3,icanhasreclaims,2,Wed Jul 15 18:51:39 2015 UTC,"I feel like the problem with Steam reviews is that the possibilities of the reviewer are too broad.  For one, almost everyone has a different build.  This is going to affect everyone's perception of how the game functions.  Couple that with the expectations that the buyer has for the game, then the broad range of reviews make it almost impossible to find an honest review.    One of my triggers for taking a review seriously is the amount of time the reviewer has played the game.  Typically, people who have more than 50 hours in a game will give it an honest review, but you still have to sift through several of those before finding one without having to read through its subjectivity."
truegaming,3de0o3,EdenSB,4,Wed Jul 15 19:34:49 2015 UTC,"Didn't expect to see you out of GoG!  Just to address your '50 hours' criteria, I wonder if that might actually cause a positive bias. After all, most people won't play a game for 50 hours or more unless they're enjoying it, so I would expect many reviewers would either be leaving purely positive or honest but overall positive reviews. Honest negative reviews might be difficult to find with that requirement."
truegaming,3de0o3,icanhasreclaims,2,Wed Jul 15 19:55:09 2015 UTC,"I make it around to other subs.  I like this sub because i don't have to sift through a bunch of shit opinions.  I chose 50 because it's typically not the ""omg, this is the best game ever"", but it is probably more reasonable to assume this number is like 10-20 hours.  Anything over that is probably to the point where it would be easy to insert zealotry."
truegaming,3de0o3,BukkRogerrs,2,Wed Jul 15 23:31:57 2015 UTC,"No. They're as reliable as Goodreads reviews are for books. Lots of people whose opinions don't really hold merit, or who, like you said, are clicking out of some misguided attempt at making a political statement are all over the place. Ignore numbers, read the substance of the review. If a review gives a game a low or high score but the substance of the review doesn't support that, it's invalid, worthless. The average score of a game doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the quality of the game. People will also base their scoring system on a comparison, meaning a completely competent and good game gets a 5/10 because it didn't match what the reviewer wanted in a game, because they just finished playing GAME-X, and this is certainly go GAME-X."
truegaming,3de0o3,banktwon1,2,Wed Jul 15 23:42:25 2015 UTC,"I think the reviews are useful but I wish they were a little more fluid about trends or gave reviewers an option outside of opinions to rate whether a game was offline or technically broken that prevented them from actually playing enough to review.  A good example of the problem with Steam reviews is the recent Crusader Kings II: Horse Lords DLC. Upon release it was actually broken (you physically couldn't activate the content). Buyers were understandably giving poor marks, for the first hours of release every review of the DLC was ""It's broken don't buy until it's fixed"" or some variation.  A few hours later it got fixed. After which every review was positive with something along the lines of ""Don't listen to the haters it works fine! GREAT DLC!"". An entire batch of reviews more than actually reviewing anything about gameplay seemed to be wanting to combat the original negative rating the DLC had been saddled with (either because they genuinely didn't know the DLC launched broken, or because they wanted to remove the mixed rating steam had given the overall user reviews).  Not to say a broken game/DLC launch doesn't deserve to take the piss from reviews, just that if I had known nothing about the content, I wish at a glance you could use reviews to get actual reviews without having to self-curate or recreate the launch timeline by review dates."
truegaming,3de0o3,Mithridates12,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:12:06 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. Steam should really overhaul it's review system (timeline, not just good or bad but star-ratings, add filters by which we can sort the reviews and a whole bunch of other things)"
truegaming,3de0o3,mynewaccount5,2,Fri Jul 17 03:40:38 2015 UTC,No. Look at skyrim reviews. Only complaints about paid mods. Look at gta V reviews. Only complaints about shark cards. Instead of something like oh idk A FUCKING REVIEW OF THE GAME.
truegaming,3de0o3,Kpiozoa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:55:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, and no.  User reviews are extremely reactionary, and often ""for the lulz"" (I don't know what else to call it) meaning that at certain points they will stop being a decent benchmark for quality. On one hand they can be useful judge of the game, on the other hand you'll have people praising bad ratz.  I don't think that steam's review system will replace any half decent journalistic review system anytime soon."
truegaming,3de0o3,bombadilsboots,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:25:38 2015 UTC,"Well, I think you are always going to run into that problem with user reviews for, well, almost any product. Sometimes the bad reviews are based on problems you don't care about (like Uplay maybe) and sometimes people just have bad, ill informed opinions. Sometimes the bad review can be based on some side issue that likely won't happen to you (like bad reviews for poor customer service)  As other people pointed out, good reviews can also be bad, with no specific information about what they liked. I usually take that as genuine enjoyment unless it's too over the top.  Basically any over all rating of anything, especially Steam games, should be taken with a grain of salt. Personally when I go to make purchases I read a handful of good and bad reviews (and I do intentionally seek out bad reviews to read) so I can weigh them for myself and decide if I want to make the purchase."
truegaming,3de0o3,Riekopo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:01:33 2015 UTC,"I generally agree with the overall review score, but a lot of the individual reviews are total crap. For some reason people like to upvote reviews that are just spam, jokes, or obvious crap. There are some things that I think should be done to improve it.  First, you should only be able to vote on a certain number of reviews in a certain period of time. This would help reduce the blind carpet voting I think people are doing. Two, you should only be able to vote a review as one category. Either Yes, No, or Funny. Funny should be it's own category. Allowing it to be applied on top of a Yes or No is like cheating. I think it unbalances the system. Third, reviews should be marked with the game version when that review was made and it should indicate that it is outdated if it is. Games change a lot so reviews should reflect that."
truegaming,3de0o3,TempusFrangit,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:00:48 2015 UTC,"I feel like it's very easy to catch honesty in negative reviews. There are very often two kinds of negative reviews: (1) the type where the reviewer makes it obvious that it's not the game's fault (e.g., ""it keeps crashing on startup!"", or ""I can't get the controller to work!""), or (2) the reviews that mention every flaw they have encountered in the game. Based on these flaws I can decide whether the game as advertised is still worth it.   People who review a game positively on steam often don't mention its flaws, and if I'm looking into reviews I'm probably already interested in the game to begin with - so what I really want to know is where the game is weak, and if that weakness is a deal breaker for me."
truegaming,3de0o3,eoinster,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:10:43 2015 UTC,"Nope, they're basically circlejerks. Arkham Knight is sitting at 41% at the moment. It's a phenomenal game, that got shafted for the PC port. It's true that like 90% of users can't run the game, and therefore should probably give it a negative review, and it was an excellent way of getting Rocksteady's attention, but if and when it's fixed in a few weeks and as functional as any other PC game it'll still have a lower rating than Aliens: Colonial Marines, for what might be one of the best games I've ever played. I do think we're better off with a fixed game and shit reviews rather than a broken game with good reviews though, WB would never have taken notice if the game didn't get circlejerked into oblivion."
truegaming,3de0o3,Ballsmasher,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:36:23 2015 UTC,"Overall it'll still give you a good idea as to how good the game is (or isn't) common sense would generally point you toward the reviews and scan them for more serious reviews, that and the forums for the game should be a good indicator of how good or shit the game is.

truegaming,3de0o3,sklopnicht,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:19:12 2015 UTC,I think they are reliable in the sense that games that has mostly positive or above are generally good games and games with mostly negative are usually crap. However the highest individual reviews are completely useless.
truegaming,3de0o3,dylstew,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:23:21 2015 UTC,"There's a few useful ones in there. For example sometimes I find good critique in the negative reviews, which means the flaws will be in my expectations, so I won't be disappointed when I play the game."

truegaming,3de0o3,syriquez,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:40:37 2015 UTC,"Fuck no. The Steam review system is completely shite. I'm going to link a game to you that proves it:  BattlePaths: http://store.steampowered.com/app/296050/  It is quite possibly one of the shittiest games I have ever seen. One of my Twitch streamers last night was playing it for an hour and my god...it is so bad. It plays, looks, and sounds like a game that would have been packaged on Mac OS in the late 90s. And as a shitcherry on top of the shitsundae, they have the audacity to sell the OST for a $1. The soundtrack is atrociously bad.  It isn't worth $5. Even if it was available on Kongregate for free, it wouldn't be worth playing. There are games on Kongregate that are legitimately amazingly good. This shit for $5? Fuck's sake, people were making better games with Flash over a decade ago. These chucklefucks released Jon Arbuckle's Fantasy RPG in fucking 2012. (And speaking of Jon Arbuckle--they describe ""their"" art as a unique style. Perhaps parroting if B^U and Garfield is considered ""unique"".)  But you look at the user reviews. Like a solid 80% of them unironically recommend it as a worthwhile game. It's a ""turn-based"" action RPG (""turn-based"" in that everything moves when you do...there is no such thing as it being turn-based as you could easily just buy a million bombs and kill everything without taking a hit as the item usage is not part of your ""turn"") that tries to sell itself as a roguelike, as a Diablo clone, as any number of things. Why the FUCK would you ever spend $5 on this piece of shit when Torchlight and Torchlight II REGULARLY go on sale for $5?!  But it's ""Mostly Positive"" and almost every review honestly recommends it. The jokes are actually rare (though at least they're consistently bad). The Steam review system is terrible."
truegaming,3de0o3,ComJak,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:40:50 2015 UTC,The most helpful reviews that are listed on the store page usually have good detail and talk about the pros/cons. I definitely read them before buying anything.
truegaming,3de0o3,Captain_Midnight,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:48:15 2015 UTC,"I think there's usually better writing in the user review section than I see in most professional reviews, but it's obscured by jokey fluff and angry idiots. Clearing out the underbrush gets tedious. It takes time for a high-quality user review to rise to the top, because there's so much low effort crap bottlenecking things."
truegaming,3de0o3,oridjinn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:49:16 2015 UTC,"I find they are no more or less reliable than any other reviews on any other site.    It all depends on what you want in a review.    For example if my buddy came up to me and said something like what /u/zen933k  pointed out:     ""Bought this game on sale, my wife had a baby, the dog ran away and my house burned down around me all the while I was completely engaged. 10/10 would by again""     I would probably buy the game in a heart beat cause I know he and I see eye to eye on that particular genre. So in that scenario that kind of review is extremely relevant.    But reading it as what 99% of people are going to read it is.. Ok it won't matter.    Then there is the mass number of reviews. If I see 100's of reviews like that. All positive. and the game has an overall High rating I will look into other reviews on other sites and see why it is so loved.     I mean just because someone writes a joke as their review does not make it a bad review per se.  I have seen 5 page long reviews that still left me with a bad taste in my mouth over whether to trust the review.    In the end I have LOVED games that got shit scores from everyone and I have hated TONS of games that got highly loved by nearly everyone.    What I am saying is. Reviews are just 1 tool. And in my honest opinion. I find the guy who's dog ran away about as valuable a review as any other site. for a variety of reasons."
truegaming,3de0o3,zen933k,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:51:41 2015 UTC,"Definitely, they're really subjective. Funny is fine, but you can be funny and still give some reason as to why it was 10/10 in more detail. Reviewers will put a title, a score and a brief opener that breaks down the game into something subjectively important and then go into the nitty gritty. My point was that most reviews on steam are empty and subjective, and not much more than a 'yay' or 'nay' vote."
truegaming,3de0o3,oridjinn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:44:02 2015 UTC,"True. And I would prefer to see the types of objective reviews you mention when i read a review.    But in the end I find them just as useless.    Sort of like a movie review.. I will watch some movies and think ""Wow.. what great acting and amazing story."" And all the reviews will comment on the plot hole ridden story and bad acting.    Then other times I will watch a movie and think ""Wow.. That acting was sooo generic and bland... Like 9th grade acting class basics..."" And then the actor/actress gets an academy award for the role.    These are extremes and rare situations.    Maybe it is just me.. But even objectively. What I see as good or bad varies greatly from others.    Another example.    The entire 30-60-FPS war going on between consoles, PC, and badly written/ported PC games.    I don't really care. I used to have a near useless computer that barely played most games at 10 FPS. If I can get the game to run... I am pretty happy.    Do i frown upon a game creator if they lock the FPS or do not optimize properly... YEAH!! But at the same time I see plenty of people get bashed for complaining a loved game is optimized badly.    (Wait... Is this line of reasoning still relevant to the review process? Ok I am going to finish this line of thought, but I think I have digressed too far.)    Just a few months ago. over on /r/ffxiv A user complained that the game was badly optimized and lacked check boxes for turning off varies feature most other games allowed you to turn off. Like Shadows for example. You cannot turn off shadows in FFXIV at all. Not even via Config edits.    He was bashed, berated, and downvoted to hell.    Had his argument been in the reverse direction about the game being locked at 30-60 FPS. The entire world including Total Biscuit would have joined hands to mail bomb square till they fix it.    But since his issue was the game was locked at a higher level of graphics he was hated on.    This is part of why even objective based reviews do not serve a very good purpose for me."

Any game you want 'optimized' can be researched, a lot use .ini and cfg files to really get the most of the pure settings but there is only so much you can do on a low-end system and personally, I don't believe it is up to a company to cater to everyone."

truegaming,3de0o3,Griffith,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:53:06 2015 UTC,"I almost never read them and the only time they become relevant is when users start bombing a game with excessive negative reviews or when a reviewer is suspected of manipulating the score.  If I had to quantify their relevance I'd say they are probably just below Metacritic user reviews which, are similar in terms of impact and influence but impact a much larger segment of games."
truegaming,3de0o3,chuiu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:16:52 2015 UTC,I would say so.  Yes there is always going to be that element where a game will get lots of negative feedback for bad ethics from the developers but I would say they probably deserve it if they upset enough people to affect the reviews of their game.  A lot of times f2p games that have launched years or months before getting on steam are added and people then chime in their reviews of the game and their experiences from the past.  This is good because it can give you a background to what kind of state the game is in and what kind of behavior you can expect from the developers.  If you're really unsure just read a selection of reviews and vote down the trash reviews.
truegaming,3de0o3,PotentialNinja,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:32:31 2015 UTC,"I use them as a quick determining factor. If the game has ""mostly negative"" reviews then i feel that's a pretty good indication that i'd be wasting my time. If it has positive reviews I'll scroll through and look at actual serious reviews to get more of an idea.   I am definitely usually bored enough to give a thumbs down to every ""Spawned into the world. Got killed by goat. goat/goat would goat."" review. Those are so insanely stupid."

truegaming,3de0o3,HeloRising,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:28:36 2015 UTC,"User reviews, for anything not just games, are generally junk on their own. Even five or ten are often not useful.  It's when you look at them as a whole when the utility starts to become apparent. If you see a hundred reviews and ninety of them talking about ""game crashes when I try to advance plot in act 2"" then you can take it as a safe bet that there's a problem. If most of the reviews are positive with no glaring errors trending, the game is probably at least alright.  Reviews are only useful as a group.  For example: Dead Rising has an 89 on Metacritic. It's a well-loved and enjoyed game by a lot of people.  I personally hated the game. If I had to review it I'd have left it a terrible review. So my review really wouldn't tell anyone anything."
truegaming,3de0o3,Sappow,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:50:33 2015 UTC,"There's also problems with the voting dynamic; you can look at almost any game or project GG took issue with and the reviews are a graveyard.

truegaming,3de0o3,brtt150,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:01:43 2015 UTC,I think for smaller games it seems to be more reliable. If there's an indie gem people get excited about it. Larger games though have a bunch of troll/joke reviews.

truegaming,3de0o3,anduin1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:09:09 2015 UTC,"Nope, I don't use them at all and wish I could hide the thumbs up or down stuff. Sometimes you get lucky and there's something well written but you're likely to find the same quick reviews on the forums. I don't even trust 1 source anymore, Ill go to youtube videos, metacritic and then usually a forum for a game to see how well it's running. Probably a ton of work for most but from about 2 years ago I cut my game spending budget by like 90% just so I would stop buying into all these shitty, buggy games I was wasting money on. Hundreds or thousands have gone to games that I regret buying because I let the excitement of getting something new get to me or falling victim to the hype train that happens with huge game releases. So no, the steam reviews are not that useful on average for someone like me who doesn't want to get burned by the gaming devs/publishers."
truegaming,3de0o3,VincentVegaReddit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:09:17 2015 UTC,"the reviews should be weighted based on the amount of time you have played the game for.  its not a perfect solution, but it would certainly help weed out the daft ratings from people who have played the game for just a few minutes."
truegaming,3de0o3,Ricwulf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:30:30 2015 UTC,"People want to bitch and moan that it's just filled with jokes, but do 5 minutes of scrolling and you get to some decent reviews (sometimes with a discussion there too)  I find it is however most useful on B-grade games, the ones that get a little attention, but not enough to be extremely popular. You get reliable users who will give a good review and less of the jokes (though there are some).  The larger games are already going to have reviews from plenty of major sources, in some cases including let's plays which can be superior as they show actual raw gameplay.  As for small time indie games, well. That can be hard, because many of the reviews will now be positive (thanks to the glorious returns system) and the ones that are left are those that fill the niche the game fills.  So there are a variety of factors that make the Steam reviews either completely worthless or somewhat valuable.  I do find that the number of reviews however is a good indicator. Larger sample size usually means better results, so keep that in mind."
truegaming,3de0o3,_HlTLER_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:35:13 2015 UTC,They are useless for me. I've discovered that I pretty much have the exact opposite taste in games compared to steam reviewers. So the reviews are either jokes or unhelpful.  And people face way more bugs than I do. I don't think I've ever experienced a bug big enough for me to remember. Unless it's a Bethesda game.
truegaming,3de0o3,niioan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:02:14 2015 UTC,"I think they are okay, you can find some decent ones if you dig and sometimes you don't even have to dig; and if you see a large %  mixed or negative reviews it does let you take notice of stinkers real fast.  But other than that, you have to remember it's just people opinions, and the only way to truly know is to play them yourself. I personally have a real struggle with reviewing games, because I want to be honest but that makes my reviews way too long, but in general I am very patient and buy all my games cheap and there are some I would feel way different about if I spent 50-60 on them rather than 5 or so."

If there are a lot of useful negative reviews saying a game doesn't run well under Windows 8.1 but the game is still a 90 because most people run Windows 7...I still know not to buy the game for instance.  Its all about weighing the best and worst of things and tailoring it to your needs and wants.  Overall, I find the Steam review system helpful in this regard."

truegaming,3de0o3,Bridger15,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:53:26 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't mind that a massive PR fuckup can cost a game points on steam's review.  I think that provides an incentive for you to really think through your choices (as a developer/publisher) and put the customers interest further forward in your mind.  Skyrim, btw, is back up to 90% because they fixed their PR problem by undoing what pissed off their community.  I have noticed that anything above 90% really has had something amazing going for it.  I haven't always liked every game I've played which is over 90%, but every single one I can understand why other people would like it and I can recognize the brilliance in it's design, even if it's not for me.  Likewise, I don't think there's a game under 80% that I enjoy, except for situations like the one you stated (where the rating represents public outrage instead of game quality).  I just checked my top 10 most played games on steam.  All but 2 are over 90%.  The three which are under 90% are: * Endless Space - Which is a game that I liked a lot, but had flaws with the AI that made it's replayability much lower than Civ V or EU4. * Rome 2: Total War - Despite putting in over 100 hours, this game let me down on every single level.  I tried so hard to like it, but in the end realized I was just going through the motions.  I came back after every major patch hoping that it had fixed the problems, but it never 'captured' me like other strtategy games have, and it has too many issues to list.  It does not surprise me that this is down in the 70s (I gave it a negative review myself)."
truegaming,3de0o3,estafan7,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:55:44 2015 UTC,"Any user review I look at  regardless of website or product, I always read what the review says while paying little attention to any rating numbers. What they have to say is much more relevant than a subjective number that might mean something else to another person. If somebody gives a good review but they don't like a genre I like, I will probably like it more than them. User reviews are useful once you learn to find the relevant information."

truegaming,3de0o3,SeulJeVais,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:21:36 2015 UTC,"The cop-out answer is depends. For me, there a variety of factors that go in before I take the review seriously. The first is if it actually talks about the game itself in depth. None of the bullshit ""the game is not fun because shooting sucks"". If they talk about why they don't like the game it brings merit. The second is consistency. That is, the reviews hit the same point over and over. I didn't get Banner Saga because a lot of people criticized the combat. They way it played out wasn't something I liked after looking it up (based on these reviews). Finally, don't look at the net review. The fact is, as you stated, people are hive minded. They can and will do things in mass. Better that you go in with a open mind and clean heart. That way it is your opinions that are being factored in and not others."
truegaming,3de0o3,peat76,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:33:04 2015 UTC,I used to read magazine reviews then found out most reviewers are paid off so switched to looking at user reviews.

So now I just believe videogamer and then take a punt depending on what they say.
truegaming,3de0o3,Tryhard_3,0,Sat Jul 18 15:32:07 2015 UTC,"No. Here is what happens in the review system:  Joke reviews and un-informative ""this game is totally great and I love it more than anything!"" posts get the upvotes. Reviews that attempt to seriously analyze the game are usually ignored. Worse yet, these latter reviews are downvoted by the game's ardent fans unless the developer is bringing bad publicity on itself (by flaming/deleting posts) or the game is out of Greenlight and still not delivering on basic advertised features.  For most games there is a dedicated group of players who make a hobby of downvoting negative reviews. Frankly, if Steam removed the ""unhelpful"" toggle it would improve the review system immediately. It would also help to be able to sort through reviews more easily to actually find reviews where people made an honest attempt.  The Steam review system has become nothing but a Web 2.0 gimmick to increase user interaction with Steam."
truegaming,3de0o3,blackmist,3,Sun Jul 19 11:46:49 2015 UTC,"User reviews are bollocks.  More specifically, the idea that you can average out user reviews and gauge something meaningful from it, is bollocks.  Everyone either gives 0/10 or 10/10, and it's usually not based on the quality of the game. The 0/10 normally comes when people read somebody else talking shit about it, or saw it as a rival to their favoured game.  Pick a few reviewers you trust and listen to them. Don't be under the impression that an amorphous mass of users can tell you anything useful with a hivemind mouth."
truegaming,3de0o3,Its_me_not_caring,0,Mon Jul 20 22:57:25 2015 UTC,"Have you even taken a look at how Steam reviews work? It does not contain numeric values and does no averaging.  The only aggregate statistic is the ratio of one to the other and it actually is reasonably helpful. Sure at some points its not that helpful (70-75% its kind of hard to judge, game generally not that good but comes down to personal taste), but if you see numerous reviews and only 40% is positivie thats a strong no for me on the other hand anything over 90% is a fairly safe bet unless you dislike the genre."

I've honestly jokingly made the suggestion that once you've played more than 100 hours of a game, your ability to leave a negative review should be disabled.   Sorry, if you play more than 2 hours of a game that you think is terrible, the problem is no longer the game. It's you. If you have fun playing a game over and over for 150 hours but then the last 10 hours of playing it over and over or so is suddenly not as fun, that is THE NORMAL PROCESS OF CONSUMING MEDIA.

I disagree that demanding consistency is an arbitrary source of difficulty. I think it is generally less fun, and that has driven the rise of instant-reset games like Wings of Vi, but that is not universal and it definitely does not mean that testing consistency is arbitrary.  We do still see consistency as a virtue in roguelikes. It's a different way of playing and it appeals to different people. Is zero checkpoint design inherently better than finite checkpoint design? I think it is more focused, so it's more appealing to modern players and devs than the continues system, which tries to be both things at once."

Let's say I make a boss with 3 attack patterns. You'll have to get good at each pattern and dodge it for a while. He takes a resonable, small amount of hits.  Now here's a battletoads boss, the boss has 1 attack, get faster with every hit and takes 20 hits to kill (which feels long in this game). I think the first is more fun as it has a different challenge before the first starts to feel like you're doing the same thing over and over. But yeah, it is more difficult to hit him 20 times. It's kinda like holding the same rhythm when playing an instrument.  Now, imagine you have to hit him 100 times. Where do you draw the line in a game that wants you to be consistent and a game that's either poorly designed or trying to manipulate you into thinking it's hard in order to stretch playtime and content?  Because considering the arcade like design of battletoads, I seem to think in that case it's the latter. (It's still a fun game though don't get me wrong)  Btw, I think roguelites and rogue likes permadeath systems are an entirely different case from nes game lives systems though :3"

That someone can implement a design pattern poorly is not a referendum on the design pattern as a whole.  What do you mean by saying permadeath is ""entirely different"" from finite lives?  Edit to add a non-roguelite example: as mentioned elsewhere, OCC games like Cave shooters (Dodonpachi, Akai Katana, ESP Galuda etc) are a great example of lives as a consistency mechanic. A lot of Cave bosses are just a series of tight patterns that you have to weave through carefully, and you're only given a certain number of mistakes before the game resets your progress. It's definitely not for everyone, but it's not arbitrary or bad design."
truegaming,3df6dp,spriteguard,2,Wed Jul 15 21:34:43 2015 UTC,"Because it is a randomly generated game that is almost entirely based on the idea of having to start all the way over. Randomization also takes huge part in it, so it's not always pure skill. They're not set challenges you get better at, you just get better at the game overall.   Old nes games have the mechanic because.. Well, quarters, and it serves very different games.  However, both often have the ""this game is very hard but it's quite short if you beat it"" approach, so that's a simialarity."
truegaming,3df6dp,Shihali,2,Wed Jul 15 21:38:47 2015 UTC,"That's why I said that lives are a halfway approach. I don't think that makes them totally uncomparable. Many NES and arcade games have random elements, many roguelikes and lites have set challenges.  In both cases, you are constantly at risk of reset, and the games are designed around this. They present challenges that require knowledge of the game systems, they test different skills at different times, and if you make too many mistakes you have to start over."
truegaming,3df6dp,CaptPic4rd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:11:17 2015 UTC,"The same transition from demanding consistency to demanding precision has occurred in JRPGs, with the same increasing number of players who find any demand for consistency whatsoever excessive and frequently rage when playing early games with their high demand for consistency in the face of semi-random obstacles.  There has been some pushback with the rise of Etrian Odyssey and similar dungeon crawlers drawing inspiration from Wizardry. They have long stretches without checkpoints as an integral part of the design, but lack the permadeath and random design of roguelikes."
truegaming,3df6dp,ImHidingInYourPants,8,Thu Jul 16 08:03:43 2015 UTC,"You need to critically examine some of your concepts. All difficulty is ""arbitrary"". It is all chosen by the designer because he likes it that way.   For me, and a lot of fans of arcade games, having continues makes the game exciting. Also, when it's a good game, replaying it doesn't feel like a punishment. Mastering the early sections of a good game can feel good."
truegaming,3df6dp,Kered13,5,Wed Jul 15 22:59:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'd like to be able to say that limited continues is a conscious design choice by a designer who wants players to perfect a whole game rather than small segments, but limited continues was a way for developers to make sure people would have to buy games to beat them back when they didn't have the resources to make very long games and rentals were a much bigger thing than they are now. That's why, like Wings of Vi, most super challenging gamers revolve around short bursts of challenge that you can quickly retry.  A game I think does limited continues right is Volgarr the Viking. You can beat the game level by level, but that's like setting it to easy mode. You can also choose to attempt to beat it without any continues which gives you harder versions of the levels and a different ending. If you run out of live you can keep playing but it kicks you down to the ready mode."
truegaming,3df6dp,OccupyGravelpit,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:42:25 2015 UTC,"Volgarr the viking's system sounds great, because you can practice with that level by level mode and then try to beat the whole game :D"
truegaming,3df6dp,yumcake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:39:36 2015 UTC,"Mmm, not quite. Let me elaborate on how it works: In each level there are a certain number of power-ups. If you collect all the power-ups and beat the level without taking a hit, then you unlock the option to proceed to the next level in ""valkyrie"" (hard) mode. This is actually a different version of the level, with more enemies and stuff. On the valkyrie levels you have a limited number of lives, and if you lose them all you go back to the normal, easier levels.  At the start of the game you can skip straight to any of the levels that you have previously reached, except the last, and start on normal mode. If you want to skip straight to a valkyrie level, you must go to the previous level and get a perfect completion. So practicing the valkyrie levels isn't as simple as just choosing to start on them.  The game has three endings: The normal ending, for beating the last level on the normal difficulty, an ending for beating the game on the path of the valkyrie, starting from anywhere, and the best ending, where you start from the beginning and beat every level on the path of the valkyrie (except the first, which doesn't have a valkyrie level)."
truegaming,3df6dp,ithinkineedanap,9,Thu Jul 16 03:13:32 2015 UTC,"There are lots of kinds of difficulty. Why, in a completely constructed environment, would you consider one kind artificial or arbitrary?   This is just the Demon's Souls question again. Some games absolutely become more interesting if you can lose progress. That may not be your cup of tea, but (in and of itself) there's nothing arbitrary about it. Old games used to be much closer to playing a piece of music: you're being graded on your ability to succeed in a sustained way, not 1 minute at a time.  There's nothing outdated about a lack of checkpointing. It's just a choice. I get that you don't agree with the choice in Battletoads -- I'm sure many agree. But you're extrapolating a couple of instances into a grand statement on game design, and I definitely don't think what you're saying holds up for 'games in general'."
truegaming,3df6dp,FlamingSwaggot,4,Wed Jul 15 22:20:42 2015 UTC,"The Souls games are often cited as being difficult because of the possibility of ""losing"" progress in the form of dropped souls when you die. But most people separate their souls accumulation phase from their exploration/boss fighting phase. In practice, there's really no little to no progress to be lost by dying.   But the Souls games are still a great example for this topic, because the true punishment for death is time. If you die on a boss, you are given a 3-5 minute wait period before you can fight them again, which comes in the form of having to run back to the boss from a distant checkpoint. The journey isn't difficult, the player has memorized it already. It's really just a time penalty.   A real ""continue"" in the Souls games would mean that if you die on a boss, you just spawn at the fog door again without having to run back there again. There would be zero change in mechanical difficulty, as the run-back had involved no incremental difficulty. However, it does pull away some of the illusion of difficulty. The bosses aren't actually that hard once you know what to do. The problem is that you die while you're learning what to do, and that you have to wait a long time between your opportunities to observe the boss and determine what you're supposed to do. Imagine for instance, if you were allowed to walk into a boss fight on a trial basis, where both the player and the boss are given infinite health. Then, once ready, you restart the battle without infinite health and you have to beat the boss normally. The boss would be beaten much much faster because the player's time wasn't wasted on long walks between observations. Thus, the ""difficulty"" added from a lack of continues does serve a useful purpose, it extends the length of a game by holding the player back from playing against the challenging part of the game."
truegaming,3df6dp,page0rz,3,Thu Jul 16 14:30:35 2015 UTC,"This is the kind of perceived difficulty that frustrates me the most, because it's arguably, or outright, an artificial difficulty that is compensating from limitations in AI, development, etc.   Where in a way, an ideal would be that upon death,  you would spawn right before the boss, so incurring no ""time penalty"" but then the boss has now adapted as well. To prevent things from potentially becoming impossible, there'd have to be some limitations, but in general it'd mean you'd need to perpetually be adjusting your tactics or strategy, not just learning a strategy like you're going down a checklist.  The problem with this is what you see in sports games, which have long struggled, and continue to struggle, with a balance between good AI and competitiveness or challenge. Where in sports, like hockey or football, there are real-world strategies and basic maneuvers that work or don't for one reason or another. You can't just enter a zone in hockey and do the same ""glitch goal"" move or the same set up for a one timer ever single time and have it work. The otehr team would learn and adapt (presumably).   The problem in a game like NHL, is that while it tries to implement this, either due to limitations of their AI or developers or budget or just design decisions, it only takes the game so far. As early as the 3rd difficulty out of 4-5 levels, the CPU will start to ""cheat"" to get around lacking AI, where the difference between playing against a person and the computer is often night and day. Against the CPU, you'll have players gain godlike abilities while you and your teammates will take a step back, with passes going errant or not being received, shots go wide more often, hits bounce off players, or opposing players became essentially giant bricks relative to the clipping of the puck while your players might as well be 2 inches tall.   So if you had a kind of dynamic boss in a game, generally this ends up executed as just a boss that is given an advantage to create a perceived sense of dynamic AI adjustment. They'll be more overpowered and you'll be underpowered, whether it's more/less health, or better/worse stats, etc. Their reaction to your movement would be linked directly to your input, where it's not so much reacting to you as mirroring you (you also see this in NHL where opposing players will react to your movements in humanly impossible ways, almost like they're a reflection in a mirror or something)."
truegaming,3df6dp,FlamingSwaggot,3,Thu Jul 16 15:13:31 2015 UTC,"I think the big distinction between progress resets being fun or shitty is this: do I have to play the exact same level again, or is the entire world randomly generated? FTL, Rogue Legacy, Spelunky, Risk of Rain, Nuclear Throne, and dozens more games all have no checkpoints, but the game doesn't suffer at all. This is because all of those games have two things in common: there are upgrades that are persistent, lasting no matter how many times you die, and the worlds are different every single time you play it. It's not engaging nor fun to repeat the exact same first three hours over and over again because you keep failing the final boss fight."

Arcades are different because they are designed so some kid has to pump in a ton of quarters to play continuously.

truegaming,3df6dp,CutterJohn,14,Wed Jul 15 20:13:37 2015 UTC,"While arcades and limited cartridge memory may be the origin of lives and continues, that doesn't automatically make them bad.  Some genres simply do not work without those systems, and there are entire communities built around 1CC (1 credit clear, i.e. one continue) gameplay. It's the same with scoreboards. You don't see them in many modern games, but that doesn't mean they're bad.   SHMUPs, for example, are built around the 1CC, and so were those old platforming games, including Batletoads.  Of course a game is easy if you're invulnerable. That's not the point. To beat Battletoads properly, to beat Contra, or Ghost 'n Goblins, or Metal Slug, means a 1CC at least. That's why the games have scores that reset or become permanently altered after each continue.  A game like Wings of Vi is designed completely differently. They're not at all comparable, and in fact there are compelling arguments for how that type of game is actually much easier than they appear to be.  It's like comparing being a professional NBA player, someone who has to get on the court for full shifts, has to be there for defence and offence, for good plays and bad plays, versus someone who only has to come on to fire a free throw, and they also get unlimited tries. Going through an entire game, or even an entire level, is a test of skills, from memory and reflexes, to pattern recognition and problem solving. You don't get the chance to just brute force it until you get lucky. Is OP, who admits to using an emulator, honestly not playing with save states?  I also happen to think--and there will be many who agree--that a game like Battletoads, Contra, or Metal Slug, includes ""fair challenge,"" and, ""engrossing gameplay,"" among other things."

truegaming,3df6dp,CutterJohn,2,Thu Jul 16 02:25:39 2015 UTC,"But that's the point. It's hard as balls in a way that's nearly as hard as it could, or should, be. You can play a game like Super Meat Boy and luck out a single time on a 10 second stage, and that's it, you're done. Compared to doing an entire 5 minute sequence, bare minimum, for a single stage in a game like Contra. It's save-state gaming, and is not nearly as hard as it looks.  I should say, it can still be difficult, in its own way, but if you're looking for arbitrary, artificial ways of making a game hard, that's the real culprit."

Its at least more in line with how we treat other games. If you fail, game over, you lost. No do overs because you flubbed the kick or whatever.  Even a physical singleplayer game like Solitare doesn't have staged do-overs. Its not in the rules to 'save' when I complete a stack or find an ace, and revert to that to try a different solution if I get stuck."

Battletoads has no credits to practice with. 1cc is the only option.  Battletoads has plenty of flat out unfair moments. Metal Slug 1's surprisingly pretty fair(died to the final boss when I did a 1 credit run).  I agree with you some games kinda need it, like shmups.   I am playing with a level code to get back where I was when I run out of lives. I'm saying it's not that hard on a level to level basis.

Bullets move slowly enough that you have time to react, and you get powerups in places where they're useful.  Dying is always your fault, and if you need to practice, you can use the 30-lives code.  It's a hard game, but it's well-designed and fair.  Same with Metal Slug.  Battletoads, on the other hand, is bullshit.  The worst of it is the snake pit, a completely ridiculous level where the only way through is by memorizing which pixel-perfect leaps of faith won't kill you."

Notice how every single one of those games, including others you didn't mention like Dungeons of Dredmor, Rogue Legacy, Risk of Rain and FTL, have strong elements of random generation, i.e. you will never play the same world twice. This keeps the game feeling fresh even when you've beaten it 25 times. Also, I have played all of those games except Nuclear Throne (waiting for it to go on 75% off!!) and all of the ones I've played have permanent rewards, such as classes, reskins, or new ships to unlock that persist through death, which give you incentive to, usually, accomplish certain things and different goals each playthrough.  However, there were many old games that made you have to restart the entire game if you died to much, and they were the same exact game every time. Contra, BattleToads, Super Mario Bros, and every other game on the NES all had this utterly awful ""feature"". You'd be hard-pressed to find a game today that makes all your progress utterly moot as soon as you die and isn't randomly generated. Additionally, it doesn't matter if you killed every enemy and got every pickup but then used your last life on the last boss, you get the same exact reward for someone who died to the first Goomba: jack shit.   This aspect, not the permadeath, is what people are opposed to. Certain games lend themselves very well to permadeath, but only the kind with random generation and interesting, persistent unlocks. Old games with lives have neither."

You get a way better story. You get a longer experience with a peak of tension that starts when you pass your usual burnout point, increases as you reach your PB, and then is this constant rush from PB on to wherever you die.  Also, even if you save the princess you get jack shit. It's a game. No matter what you do, you get jack shit.  ETA: I'm not saying it's for everyone, or that it should be mainstream.

All you get is a meaningless score that is erased as soon as you turn off the device. I like being able to look at, and use, all the cool things I've unlocked by being good at a game even if I have to start from square one each time I press play.   I think that's probably why I play roguelikes and not poorly designed NES games that, while they were truly fantastic and innovative at the time, don't even come close to holding up to Super Meat Boy, Thomas Was Alone, Cave Story, Shovel Knight, Braid, or any multitude of truly fantastic platformers. Of course, if you play with save states, games like SMB3 or MM2 actually do hold up today, but there aren't many games that do.  Maybe the big problem is I didn't grow up playing NES or SNES, I'm quite a bit younger than most posters here and the games I played as a young kid were basically limited to Pokemon Pearl, Animal Crossing: Wild World, HoMM II and Civ IV.

The arcade versions worked around you having to put in more money to continue.  The NES version was different, in that you could die and would have to restart a level (and I think there were limited continues as well.) One may argue that NES Gauntlet had an unfair difficulty, but compare that to home versions of Gauntlet Dark Legacy, which did have infinite continues, so there was no challenge.  I would argue in this case that the NES system was better even if it wasn't perfect."

The online model is the best thing for game companies because they have to put very little risk into products now, it's all reward and undortunately, that's the experience the majority of gamers want and think is the best  I don't disagree that companies should support the platform that customers purchased (maybe even have a minimum required timeline of disconnection to at least give an idea of value someone will get).

If you don't like it, stop buying it. That's it. I refuse to buy any games that need hosting on EA servers, or any EA games for that matter. Haven't bought anything from them since 2009 or 2010, because principles.   Same for anything else. I refuse to buy Ubisoft games now for similar reasons, what with UPlay and really, really shitty DRM.  Why do we let them do this? We don't have a say in it. People buy their shit, they shut it down, boo-hoo, and then the cycle repeats. You want them to stop? Put your money where your mouth is. Stop buying their shit.  I personally do everything possible to buy single player games, and to support games that have local LAN multiplayer, because fuck not being able to play with my wife simply because the publisher decides to stop hosting.

truegaming,3deloo,ithinkineedanap,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:57:08 2015 UTC,"The same thing is an issue in sports games. The AI at a certain point just becomes ""unfair"" because the CPU players seem to obtain increasingly godlike abilities while you and your teammates seem to lose abilities (odds of successful shots/passes/etc decrease even outside of opponent influence). It's especially an issue given that at any one time you're only controlling one player/character, and so the AI of your teammates and the AI of opponents are heavy factors.   It makes for a very unrealistic experience, despite the intent being realism, because of the inevitable ""video game-ness"" that occurs from various mechanics in the game. In something like hockey, for example, while understanding the sport and playing ""properly"" can help, you really just end up learning to counter the flaws with the mechanics and the AI, not playing ""proper"" hockey or whatever."
truegaming,3deloo,gizayabasu,4,Thu Jul 16 15:21:32 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting concept. Given that an AI can keep on learning indefinitely, it will eventually reach a point where it's impossible to defeat (Watson). I guess this would serve to simulate human behavior in AI, albeit not advance it any further than it already has gotten.  For the purpose of gaming, I think it actually simulates human behavior pretty decently, though I could be ignoring some considerations. When a human plays a game, they continuously get better due to prior experience, but lapses in gaming may result in forgetting some strategy. If this principle is applied to the AI, it may perhaps result in a more ""fair"" AI.  There would have to be a degree of randomness in its forgetfulness, however, as making something procedural only serves to create artificial difficulty levels as a previous commenter mentioned. Without randomness, it is the same as just taking a subset of suboptimal strategies to create a weaker AI.  However, by taking an AI that essentially knows everything and introducing random memory loss, you're creating a competitive AI that isn't impossible.  Interesting topic."

I really enjoy that they chose to explore the consequences of what happens when you lose in the ""game."" For most people a loss scenario is not even considered in the narrative, so for them to actually continue from that point is very refreshing to see.    Only other game I can think that did this was actually the Legacy of Kain series, where As Kain, you get the choice between sacrificing yourself to save humanity, or saying fuck it and taking everything over. The sequel picks up with the assumption that Kain decided to forsake everything for selfish reasons, and now stands as the ruler"

Let's talk about Easy mode:   Base global panic starts at 0 at the beginning of the campaign If you fail to address an alien threat (unattempted or mission failure) then local panic in that region increases by 1 The XCOM HQ starts with 42 units of ""power"" (think something like Starcraft's pylons power, or more accurately Red Alert 2's power system.

In Ironman mode, you can no longer save the game. Ok, that's a little mean. You can no longer load a previously-saved game and checkpoints no longer exist. That is, instead of seeing ""Save"", ""Load"", and ""Quit"" in the escape menu, you only get one option ""Save & Quit"".

Progress lost through failure is only currency used for character advancement, not items (unless you deliberately drop them) or entire playthroughs (unless you ragequit, or maaaybe deliberately enter Aramais naked or something?). The only way to ""game over"" Dark Souls by ragequitting. The only losing move is not to play.  When you lose your best squad to spoilers (fukken whales), they don't respawn. You have to handle the next missions without them, forever. In DaS, literally everything except Bosses and NPCs respawn (and those respawn in NG+(+...).  Dark Souls isn't hard, it's tedious (in a good way). Even if you're bad at games (like me!) you can slog through and beat it.

I want to tell you about the After[blank] series - UFO: Aftermath, UFO: Aftershock and UFO: Afterlight. Specifically, the first two.  In Aftermath, you play on an earth that has been invaded by aliens. No, not invaded. Gassed. They spread spores in the atmosphere that choked out the light and mutated what survived and even what didn't. You play a human resistance that fights back.  Of course, eventually, you gain momentum. You push back. You take your enemies' technology (and have yours taken in turn). You learn of your enemies' motivations. Of their plans. And then...  Then they approach you with an offer of peace. Not surrender. Not threats. They offer a genuine offer of peace. Or perhaps of non-aggression. If you lay down your arms, if you stop opposing them, they will leave you alone. Better than that. If you let go of your vengeance, they will accept you as... not equals, but certainly conspirators, at least. They will build you a city in the clouds, for you and your men to live in, safe from the ravages of the devastated world. They will share with you the boons of the great and terrible thing they came there to create.   You can accept. Doing so means losing the game. You are supposed to refuse, to press on, to destroy them and their creation, to avenge your planet and begin reconstruction.  But what if you accept? What if you take them up on their offer?  And there begins Aftershock, within a flying city above a mutated Earth, as a powerful psionic pulse knocks out its engine and forces you to lead a part evacuation part invasion onto the aliens' own city, only to find it deserted. What happened? What now? Perhaps the answers lie beneath. Perhaps you can restore human dominion of a once lost earth, before something even more terrible notices the pulse."

That everything the player did during XCOM 1 including alien tech assimilation, base building, defense, nothing of it ever happened.  Contrasted to pretty much every other sequel in gaming, where the sequel usually continues right where the last one left off (and at least one of the many possible endings actually happened), this is a really unique concept.   To offer a counterpoint, consider a series where individual entries have multiple, binary (good-bad), but not world-ending conclusions.  Have you head of the link between Shadow Hearts and its sequel Shadow Hearts: Covenant? They go with the bad ending from the original since the good ending closes everything up nicely.

Enemy Unknown introduced me to the series, so I don't have a good idea of the original games' continuity. I do however believe that having the player begin from the perspective of what are effectively insurgents is much more interesting than saying ""Congratulations on beating XCOM 1! Now face the second wave of alien invaders in XCOM 2!""   You could also make the argument that humanity was, for all intents and purposes, supposed to lose during the events of the first game. E.g., playing on hardest difficulty + hardcore mode (I forget the actual name, where you can't just reload quicksaves if you make mistakes) means fail states are more likely to happen than success.

Absolutely. I'm in the same boat. I love pretty much all of the XCOM games (that are in that genre at least) and Xenonauts.

truegaming,3da4vh,yumcake,30,Wed Jul 15 12:23:12 2015 UTC,"I felt like it was unnecessary to undo the ""win"" outcome of X-com: Enemy Unknown. They didn't do this the first time they made this game.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-COM:_Apocalypse  The original series didn't make you ""lose"" the first game. Instead, X-Com wins the first battles with the aliens. Peace ensues, human civilization uses alien technology to advance rapidly. X-com is defunded as the alien threat has been ""eliminated"". However, the aliens return in secret, and instead of engaging in direct terror attacks across the globe, they mind control human leadership of various factions, turning public opinion, creating cults that worship the aliens and wish for them to return. The aliens begin establishing themselves in secret. X-com then is restarted by some of the few anti-alien factions with a shoestring budget and begins to battle aliens and alien-friendly human factions.  X-COM 2 is essentially the plot of X-COM: Apocalypse in the original timeline. Those ""Advent"" soldiers you see in the trailer are a callback to the Advent faction in X-COM:Apocalypse.  As for the power creep of the equipment, all technology had advanced in X-COM:Apocalypse, so that you still had an equivalent power climb from the starting equipment to the late-game equipment. They were mostly just new names for the same tier of weaponry/armor.  For those of you who aren't familiar with the original series, the concept behind X-COM: Apocalypse was pretty insane (even if the execution wasn't 100% there), and if X-COM 2 managed to produce a modern implementation of even half of what X-COM: Apocalypse was trying to do, it'll be amazing.    X-COM must maintain a good rapport with other organizations in the city. If X-COM angers any of them, or fails to contain the alien incursion, organizations will demand compensation or even actively attack X-COM forces. They will also withdraw their support (if any) for the X-COM project. For example the Transtellar organization would prevent Agents and science personnel from travelling around the city. The corporations and political organizations will make profits, perform research, manufacture items, and even fight covert battles with one another independently of the player. For example, if Megapol, the city police, are making lots of money, they will be able to maintain a strong presence in the city, attacking alien ships and other hostile aircraft. The more damage to the city, and the greater Megapol's financial trouble, the less they will be able to respond to enemy attacks across the city. One of these organizations, the Cult of Sirius, is a group of religious fanatics who worship the aliens, and is inherently hostile to X-COM. The aliens, rather than simply signing non-aggression treaties with the various corporations, will attempt to infest their CEOs and take control of the organizations themselves.  If the Government becomes hostile towards X-COM for any reason, such as alien interference or excessive damage to Government property and personnel, then the X-COM project will receive no further funding. This is a potential disaster for the player, and can lead to X-COM scrounging out a miserable existence, stealing from other organisations in order to survive. However, with perfect management, X-COM can outpower the entire City's military, while being richer than even Food Monopoly Company Nutrivend, then destroy the whole city and get away with it, given the game's superb flexibility. Having friendly relations with both minorities (the android organisation S.E.L.F and the hybrid Mutant Alliance) can result in superbly talented recruits of these races becoming available in following weeks.  Originally, the game was going to be much larger and be even more in-depth, with political intrigue helping to bring the city of Mega-Primus to life. An unimplemented weapon called the Tracker Gun could be fired at an unsuspecting enemy, attaching some kind of tracer onto his clothes. The person could then be trailed around the city by one or more X-COM agents. All of this political intrigue was cut down to the bare bones due to the following constraints."

Why does all sequels assume that the player won the first game? What if the player lost the previous game? I want to see more of this in games.  I don't have the link at hand right now, but I read somewhere that by assuming that the player lost Enemy Unknown, the things that happened in Enemy Within (like MEC-troopers and EXALT) never happened. That is something that I also find interesting.   and that can likely be blamed on some form of power creep   This may be the case, but I think the concept of Alien Research (for the various aliens) in Long War is an interesting way prevent the player from snowballing out of control. Granted Long War is different from the normal Enemy Within in several ways, but I like the idea.  Edit: Apparently reddit doesn't like links with parenthesis.

truegaming,3da4vh,dankisms,2,Tue Jul 14 23:12:50 2015 UTC,"a really unique concept     Not really, there are several other games with multiple endings that have sequels, with the ""best end"" not necessarily being the canon one. Some even offer different start points if you have a save of the previous game, although right now I can only recall Wizardry 7->8.  There are other ways of justifying why the player doesn't simply start off with the previous game's end-tier equipment as well, most of the time it's simply because the PCs are different people. For example take the shareware RPG trilogy, the Exile series. In all of them you started fresh as different PCs no matter what ending you achieved in the previous games.  We don't really see too much of this because far too many game series aren't actually coherent sequels, for example JRPGs are infamous for this (e.g. FF7 has nothing to do with FF6). Thing is, if you create a sequel you'll inevitably run into the fans who hate you for doing X and not Y, and another faction who feels exactly the opposite. By merely using the name and maybe some of the universe lore but divorcing the stories entirely, games get to trip the nostalgia flag but with less of the attendant baggage. It's easier to design too - after all, if XCOM2 treated XCOM1's good ending as canon they'd have to either make the player be from a different faction or find some other reason for disallowing using the end game tech from the first game."

But with that said I don't like the idea that the sequel is based off losing the 1st game.  That gives it more of a reboot feel than a sequel.  Instead of basing it off losing the first game they should set it far enough after the 1st game that Xcom is no longer needed, is disbanded, then the aliens come back and take over in secret.  By the time people notice, it is too late and the world is in the state it needs to be in for what they want to do with Xcom 2."

I like the new idea. I'm a little worried about the implementation. I do think that if I had my druthers, I would have tried for a ""best of both worlds"" sort of approach (""30 years after the aliens were repulsed, mankind had taken and repurposed their technology and spread throughout the solar system. 50 years after the aliens were repulsed, they returned.

If they'd followed that with another invasion that started out by systematically slaughtering XCom, then I figured that would make sense. The only problem is that even if XCom was destroyed, at several points in the game you do distribute the weapons you develop to other countries, so they would have been able to fight back as well.

I was playing the game on Hard mode, with IronMan enabled (you can only auto save, no save-scumming). I got really really far in the game and I beat notoriously hard missions (newfoundland mission with the chrysalids) and the entire time I didn't loose a single soldier.

In XCOM: EU the game could end with you destroying the mothership and driving off the aliens, or it could end with the doom clock hitting midnight and XCOM is shut down. If, as they say, statistically the majority of games ended the second way, taking that as the canon ending just makes sense. Furthermore, it gives them an excuse to really switch things up for the sequel. XCOM is more of a guerrila organization now, and that lets them add things like stealth gameplay into the mix.

It was a meatgrinder, and after three weeks i didnt have any more rookies to send out on missions or any money to hire new ones, just one Squaddie sitting alone in the barracks (he got ""lucky"" and sat out the last disastrous mission because of wounds sustained in the mission before that). There were thankfully no incursions in this last week, but then the monthly report came and i got the Game Over cut-scene.  Im sold on the premise for the sequel. Let me avenge my dead rookies!  It also created some hilarious (and very dark) situational comedy. When i completed the first Xenobiology research i had just finished a mission which left me with no survivors, and the cutscene where the scientist and engineer tried to sell the OPS-guy on trying to taze an alien was bizarre. They were just hoplessly naive and had no concept of how dire the situation was while they were locked up in the bunker, tinkering away at the spoils of that first successful encounter. The OPS-guy had to keep a straght face to keep morale up, and little more than a week later they were all standing in the meeting room as the capitulation was announced..."

At this point, why are they fighting the aliens if the aliens have given us beautiful mega cities free of disease? Better for Earthlings to assimilate at this point. These guerrilla fighters are bitter old men upset that we lost a war. Not very heroic.   I liked XCOM in the first game because they still had their pride and hope to really destroy the aliens."
truegaming,3da4vh,Mithridates12,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:34:00 2015 UTC,"It would be so great if XCOM were the bad guys. I'd love to see how they fight the aliens, destroy some infrastructure and then even have to fight other humans who are siding with the aliens."
truegaming,3da4vh,JujuAdam,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:51:09 2015 UTC,"I have no problem with the decision, but is it really a sequel if XCOM 2 requires that everything that happened in XCOM 1 hasn't actually happened? For me, it isn't because the only thing these two games will have in common (story-wise) are the fact that aliens invaded earth, the different types of enemies and the fact that XCOM exists. In my opinion there is no continuity, which is perfectly fine.   edit: I didn't care about the story of XCOM 1, so that's probably the reason why I have no problem with the path the developers have chosen. I just want the same type of game, improved in some aspects, and then I'll be happy."
truegaming,3db6jf,LoydDobbler,37,Tue Jul 14 22:31:28 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same mind as /u/OccupyGravelpit. Nintendo applies those brands, IPs and skins to draw customer attention, that's absolutely true. But Smash would still be a unique and great fighting game without those skins, and would remain a fantastic if far less widespread and known. It's worth remembering that at one point it was called ""Dragon King"" and had no Nintendo characters whatsoever - had that released and had the exact same balance and design as Smash 64 but without the all-star cast it have launched a new franchise by itself, or it may have languished in obscurity due to bad initial sales, only to be rediscovered and praised as a ""forgotten gem"" by hobbyists with emulators, long after any question of profitability has left. This is why Nintendo, being as massively conservative as they are, tend to stick to their recognisable IPs for their top-tier titles, and often call on them for experimental or unusual games too. Mario plays a lot of sports and practices medicine because of this attitude, and not all of those titles are widely praised or get off the ground beyond a single game or two.  If anything, you simply need to look at Splatoon. New franchise, no real ties to any previous work by Nintendo apart from a few tiny references (a snippet of a song, a vague resemblance between items, pixel art in a trailer), totally fresh take on the concept of online multiplayer shooter. Extremely praised, popular and high-quality game that takes a saturated genre into an entirely new direction, abstracting complex concepts of territory control and mobility into something simple enough for a small child to play yet remaining intensely fun for jaded adults like myself.  You take Mario from The Nintendo Platforming Game Series and you're still left with an incredibly fine-tuned platformer the likes of which no other company can hope to compete with for quality, precision and content. While impressions, personal ratings and yes even journalistic ratings as biased upwards for familiar long-running franchises, just as many people consider totally distinct titles like Galaxy to 3D World to NSMB to be ""just another Mario game"", when in fact they're almost distinct enough to be entire franchises of their own. Only a few common elements of aesthetic grammar - yellow ? blocks hold items, shells can be kicked and thrown about, fire hurts - truly bind them together. People all too often write off a title as ""it's a Zelda game"" or ""just another Mario"" game when every single one is unique and has their own merits and flaws.  In a way, you're right. Nintendo games are rated and perceived differently because of their consistent product identity, but whether that leads to overrating by fans or underrating by those tired of the franchise aesthetics depends entirely on what circles you travel in and which cynics you listen to. Super Zamboo Galaxy by Slashstar games would certainly attract similar assessments of quality and praise to Super Mario Galaxy in this world, but its other assessments may forestall its success - that or its price would be lower and thus less profitable, as Nintendo is able to charge a premium for its games on brand recognition alone. Price is often a considered factor when reviewing games (as purchasing advise, as nearly all new-release reviews are). A company that makes games like Nintendo, to the same quality standard as Nintendo, would certainly not get equal scores or exposure simply because they're not Nintendo, but that would simply make this fictional company's games underexposed and likely underrated.  Last note - the concept of over/under-rated is always a bit comical, as ratings are fundamentally abstractions of opinions when dealing with something as complex as a video game. Games are presently reviewed in a horrendously hodgepodge way, reading like a bizarre mix of Consumer Reports, entertainment criticism and art criticism - three wholly different approaches to evaluating the worth of something, with totally different scopes and desires to meet. As a result, to determine whether something is overrated or underrated one must first determine what you're actually looking for and therefore what ratings and metrics are actually relevant - a simple Metacritic number is totally insufficient for the majority of games, especially in this age of perpetual patching and changes, yet here we are..."
truegaming,3db6jf,BobisOnlyBob,13,Tue Jul 14 23:12:51 2015 UTC,"""Overrated"" is really worthless as a term, by its pure subjectivity. If what you're asking is ""Would these games have as high of a profile if they weren't from Nintendo?"", that's kind of worthless too, because who would they be from? Activision? Some plucky indie company? A mid-tier developer?   The games stand on their own merits as games. As commercial successes, it's near impossible to remove them from greater context of culture and Nintendo's history."
truegaming,3db6jf,bradamantium92,-2,Wed Jul 15 01:14:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's almost like this question was poorly worded."
truegaming,3db6jf,Ensivion,36,Wed Jul 15 03:34:20 2015 UTC,"I think it's the ""AAA"" games that tend to sell really well on Xbox and Playstation that are the most overrated within modern gaming culture. Nintendo tends to do interesting stuff that's usually a bit out of leftfield, rather than just rehash after rehash of the same tired dudebro FPSs and Openworld beat'em-ups.  However, I do think that Nintendo does rest on it's laurels when it comes to using name recognition to sell it's games. I don't think there's any doubt that without their franchise names their games wouldn't sell nearly as well. However, sales numbers have pretty much nothing to do with the quality of a title."

truegaming,3db6jf,BobisOnlyBob,8,Tue Jul 14 23:13:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah definitely, they would be rated quite lower imo. Blizzard can be a similar example, who would play HotS if it didn't have starcraft/warcraft/diablo characters in it?  It would have been just another moba in a saturated market, instead it's having pretty good success. That said, it's definitely not a problem for me, I mean, I love so much being able to play with characters i love from other games that it probably makes up for the gameplay if it has some flaws"
truegaming,3db6jf,Alegaiti,7,Tue Jul 14 23:43:41 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think HotS's success is more due to Blizzard's name recognition than the characters itself. Sure, the characters help, but it was from a map of a Blizzard game that the MOBA genre even came into existence."
truegaming,3db6jf,gizayabasu,2,Wed Jul 15 00:43:03 2015 UTC,"To be fair the mission system and removal of the fiddlier, technical parts of MOBAs does set HotS apart.

truegaming,3db6jf,BobisOnlyBob,18,Wed Jul 15 07:38:40 2015 UTC,"If anything, the opposite. They tend to work in abandoned/underused genres, against the grain, and still put out what is (in my mind) some of the best in the industry.  They get a lot of undeserved flak. When they have a great online game, it's a fluke because 'everyone knows' they suck at the internet. When they put out a beautiful game, people insist on sticking an asterisk on it. etc. etc."
truegaming,3db6jf,OccupyGravelpit,12,Tue Jul 14 22:34:26 2015 UTC,"When they put out a beautiful game, people insist on sticking an asterisk on it.   I've noticed this sentiment a lot lately.

No game is for everyone, sure, but it always strikes me as massively hypocritical to see people criticize Nintendo for things like ""rehashing"" their franchises when they tend to have long development cycles and shake up their formulas drastically every other title or so, while at the same time praising franchises that really do only iterate slightly on themselves between titles with short dev cycles like Assassin's Creed.  It seems like the gaming community as a whole is just really critical of Nintendo, even in areas where they wouldn't, and don't, criticize other developers and publishers."
truegaming,3db6jf,kennystrife,4,Wed Jul 15 02:33:22 2015 UTC,"massively hypocritical to see people criticize Nintendo for things like ""rehashing"" their franchises when they tend to have long development cycles and shake up their formulas drastically every other title or so   One thing that strikes me.. and I'll use a recent example of what I'm talking about.. is how people want Nintendo to branch out, but still deliver exactly what people enjoyed before. My example is Super Mario 3D World. It's an incredibly unique take on what Nintendo has done with the 3D Mario genre since 64. It includes elements from SMB, SMB2 (U.S., with the character select and abilities), SMB3, and SMW whether it be in level design, music direction, or art style. SM3DW is a true Mario platformer in a 3D space, and we had not gotten one of those yet beforehand.  Yet, people still complained even though it hits the mark on every point as a terrific, well made platformer with (for me at least) ~40 hours of gameplay because of secrets and multiplayer, stating they ""wanted another SM64 but bigger"". It just baffles me."
truegaming,3db6jf,boopaboopa,3,Thu Jul 16 15:48:25 2015 UTC,"Actually that game was a follow-up to Super Mario 3D Land for the 3DS. The game ended up being kinda fun, but I remember being disappointed at first because it just looked like an HD upgrade of a handheld game with multiplayer."
truegaming,3db6jf,BCsquared,0,Fri Jul 17 00:22:25 2015 UTC,"Well, obviously. However SM3DW also has a lot of differing mechanics and concepts in it (like the character selection and multiplayer just to name a couple). But what I mean is, it's the first true 3D console Mario platformer we've gotten that wasn't on handheld.  I think a lot of us were disappointed at first, honestly. But man were we wrong or what? I swear, it's the most fun I've had with a game in a long time.. and the most frustrating thanks to Champion Road. Actually, the disappointment from SM3DW's announcement and then first gameplay footage kinda mirrors what's happening with Star Fox Zero right now. SFZ looks rough around the edges, but so did SM3DW before it released and got a lot of TLC and improvements up until that point."
truegaming,3db6jf,boopaboopa,3,Fri Jul 17 00:51:03 2015 UTC,"Absolutely how I feel too, Nintendo games are underpraised because of a stupid ass stigma that they are somehow childish.

Nintendo never dropped the mark with their games being incredibly polished, beautiful and with a really thought out gameplay that doesn't descent into stupid grinding for no-effort collectibles and otherwise bloated stuff that doesn't really contribute to player's experience."
truegaming,3db6jf,goatram,3,Wed Jul 15 12:30:34 2015 UTC,I keep telling people Zamboo by Slashstar is just like a proper Mario game but people keep discounting it because it looks 'fake' with its claymation sprites

truegaming,3db6jf,orbimobius,3,Wed Jul 15 16:44:00 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.    For me, I'm mostly tired of the Nintendo formula, if it is what you like, it is very well made.   I do want to try a couple Wii U games like Bayonetta 2 and Donkey Kong.  But games like Smash, Kart and Mario don't really interest me much more.    Brand recognition does help a lot, if Super Mario Galaxy was called Joe the Plumber Galaxy, it would get good reviews, probably not as good as SMG, and would be considered a hidden gem."
truegaming,3db6jf,ACardAttack,3,Wed Jul 15 12:00:14 2015 UTC,"Aside from brand recognition and nostalgia, the biggest advantage that Nintendo has is that it got to define the expectations of a large share of the market. A lot of people are resistant to change so they will go with what's familiar, and no one knows the standards better than the people that set them. Personally, I'm looking forward to a post-Nintendo market where games like Minecraft have defined the expectations of the core demographic."
truegaming,3db6jf,mcmanusaur,7,Wed Jul 15 14:52:04 2015 UTC,"I really don't think so at all. I am 100% sure Smash would be a highly regarded game even without the Brand Recognition. Ridiculously polished base gameplay and tons of extremely cool extra stuff speak for themselves. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing both in quality and in quantity.  Mario Kart is similar. Outside of the polished gameplay (something that basically all Nintendo main titles share in my opinion) you again have incredible level design, a great soundtrack and awesome aesthetics. Basically all of the larger recent Nintendo titles stand 100% on their own without the Brand recognition.  Now what I do think is that this brand recognition drives up the sales. But I don't think it makes them overrated, because gameplay wise these titles completely work without their well known characters."
truegaming,3db6jf,Eirh,3,Tue Jul 14 23:18:33 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair the soundtrack kinda comes with the whole ""using Nintendo characters"" thing."
truegaming,3db6jf,Kinopravda23,7,Thu Jul 16 00:10:34 2015 UTC,"I think on average the answer is yes, though Super Mario Galaxy is a poor example because I think that would have had an outstanding reception regardless of the character. Nintendo makes some truly outstanding games, don't get me wrong, but they do get more credit than they deserve because they're Nintendo in a lot of cases. Pokemon X/Y are 7/10 games, not 10/10s. I think if they didn't have the Pokemon name attached, we might have even seen some 5's and 6's from gaming media. And some of their weaker work - things like Yoshi's Island DS or Paper Mario: Sticker Star - are only given positive reception because of their names. That said, Nintendo really has made some of the best games of all time, their output just isn't nearly as consistently good as gets credit for because of beloved Nintendo IPs."
truegaming,3db6jf,epeternally,7,Wed Jul 15 05:53:01 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much what I wanted to say.  Nintendo's worse games end up getting a bit of a pass.  I love Nintendo.   They made some of my favorite games, but when they release an average/about average game, it gets a ratings bump.  Pokemon X/Y was good, but it felt like it needed more.  Comparing it to Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire displays that perfectly."
truegaming,3db6jf,JeddHampton,2,Wed Jul 15 14:08:02 2015 UTC,"This is in line with what I was trying to say. It isn't that every Nintendo game is rated highly. It's that every one of them seems to get a little grade inflation. Everyone will point out the one or two games that got low ratings, but if they came from another developer, they'd probably be even lower."
truegaming,3db6jf,snookums,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:19:45 2015 UTC,"People actually rewarded X and Y 10/10? I don't think that is unbelieveable considering the jump into 3D, amazing online, great new pokemon and new type, I just dont remember anyone giving it 10/10.  Reviews shouldn't matter too much. A lot of reviewers gave last of us 10/10 and after playing, it didn't deserve a 10/10 as a game. If it were a movie, it deserves the praise but the gameplay didn't back up those high scores.  Most of the AAA sequelized games get no lower than an 8/10 and most of them have major issues: cut content, frequent dlc that is already complete, same game engine, little to no innovation to move the genre forward. Skyrim got rave reviews despite being an unplayable state on ps3.   Maybe the issue is, because Nintendo avoids most of these problems, they are awarded higher scores. So if the badly made games are going to keep getting high scores, the well made games will be higher.   I don't really care about game reviews, it's mostly a joke because there are bias' on all sides but with respect to Nintendo's games quality, I don't believe that to be a legitimate issue in the scheme of things"

Nintendo carries with it a certain expectation of quality, even if it's a new IP. I mean, Splatoon is successful since it's a good game, but I'm sure having the Nintendo brand helped a lot.  I imagine a rather interesting consideration would be to explore whether having a bad IP would lead to the same success. If Splatoon was instead skinned with a movie tie-in and developed by a company known to create shoddy games, would it still reach the acclaim it has gotten today?"

truegaming,3db6jf,bradamantium92,2,Wed Jul 15 01:15:36 2015 UTC,Is it also a given that our view of the games quality will get inflated as well?

truegaming,3db6jf,Alex__V,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:44:44 2015 UTC,"I may have misinterpreted the original post since other comments have been nothing that it's the IPs that have been the reason why certain games have been successful as opposed to the company.  In which case, totally understand your point. I honestly think it's the Nintendo brand is underrated. When a critic is met with a Nintendo game, you can't exactly bash that it's ""kiddy"", since that'll automatically be met with concerns that the critic doesn't understand the appeal with Nintendo. In a sense, Nintendo sort of gets a free pass. There are other games that I would argue are just as strong, if not better, than its Mario counterparts, yet have not nearly had the same success. For one, I personally found Crash Team Racing to be one of my favorite kart racers of all time. Sure, it's still a big name (Naughty Dog), but it's not Mario.  Nintendo doesn't have to advertise, and in some cases, they get extra points. Why is Super Mario RPG so acclaimed even among other Square RPGs? Because it's the first Mario RPG. Mario is without a doubt a strong brand within Nintendo, but even just having the Nintendo brand on a game automatically validates it. In gaming, no other brand has that power. Sony and Microsoft aren't huge first party developers; they mainly just publish. Sure, you have Madden, Call of Duty, and Grand Theft Auto, among many others as rather strong brands, but none can match up to Mario, and likewise, EA, Activision, and Rockstar can't match up to Nintendo."
truegaming,3db6jf,crabtreason,2,Wed Jul 15 04:00:14 2015 UTC,"Once I get to playing a game, I don't think it can hide behind the name on the box, or the reputation of the devs. It has to stand or fall on what it is. I can see how Nintendo's reputation and it's established IPs might get more gamers to part with their money, but that's as far as it goes.  I do think there's an opposite effect - a lot of great obscure games do get overlooked (or underrated) in the market because of the lack of brand awareness and the like. But that's not Nintendo's fault as such.  Bottom line - making a bunch of brilliant games is in no way a bad thing :)."
truegaming,3db6jf,MyPunsSuck,2,Wed Jul 15 10:57:08 2015 UTC,"I think this is just a matter of perspective, and a result of being somewhat saturated in Nintendo quality for so long. The games are fantastic and if someone else made a game that was just as good, it would gain recognition. The convenient thing about Mario is just brand recognition and advertising, along with the Nintendo market domination, but even Mario has had games that people have panned or ignored. I think their games for the most part are fairly rated; we've just been spoiled by how great some of the games really are.  Also if it has Nintendo characters, that shouldn't be something that could be considered separately when reviewing the game; it can and does contribute to the final quality and experience, and a lot of that is to do with satisfying the fans. It's a relatively respectful relationship Nintendo has with its fans, but they're not perfect either."
truegaming,3db6jf,Intelligensaur,3,Thu Jul 16 20:44:09 2015 UTC,"I'd like to add that it's a bit of an unfair comparison to take Nintendo's character's out of the equation, because they are really good at designing lovable characters. It seems everybody else out there is trying to go as gritty and dark as possible, while pretending that serious business is the hallmark of maturity. Games are for fun, dammit! Pretty much only Nintendo among the big companies recognizes this"
truegaming,3db6jf,PrinskipperSkipple,2,Wed Jul 15 10:50:56 2015 UTC,"I'm sure a lot of games are better received thanks to being part of the various Nintendo IPs, but calling them 'overrated' because of that is kind of, well, dumb.  Nintendo has spent decades crafting these franchises, honing down every little detail to be recognizable, memorable, aesthetically pleasing, and so on. Having Mario, or Link, or Pikachu, or whoever else in a game is just as much of a feature as the mechanics or graphics.  Yes, we as a gaming community rate the average Nintendo game higher than if it had different (or at least generic) skins and devs. No, they're not overrated, Mario just makes the game more fun than if it starred Zamboo."

Granted, they certainly wouldn't sell as many copies.   But I can't for the life of me figure out why Galaxy is considered such a good game. There's nothing remarkable about it whatsoever.   Fucking Nintendo though, they need to come up with something original. Even Smash and Kart are getting pretty damn stale."
truegaming,3db6jf,Alex__V,4,Tue Jul 14 23:42:11 2015 UTC,"Splatoon or Nintendoland or Game and Wario don't fit that bill apparently?  What games would you say are unique among other game companies, that offer more gameplay innoavtions in their respective genres, compared to nintendo?"
truegaming,3db6jf,naiets,0,Wed Jul 15 17:14:47 2015 UTC,Opinions. I think Super Mario Galaxy is the most innovative game of its generation and one of the few modern games that I'd consider worthy of masterpiece status.
truegaming,3db6jf,boopaboopa,-1,Wed Jul 15 10:52:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think telling Nintendo to make something original is the correct term because pretty much all of their franchises are... original franchises. Like, if they came up with something that directly rips off CoD that'd be unoriginal.  However while I agree they need to come up with more NEW things, well I don't think they can really just abandon their franchises even though I agree they are getting stale.

There is a certain amount of charm and nostalgia their legendary characters possess and inspire, but Nintendo also introduces new characters and art styles that are just as good with nearly every game. I think Nintendo games on average are underrated by the whole of the gaming community, either because they have a bias against Nintendo, or because they kind of pave their own way through it. While Nintendo platforms may not be my go-to gaming spots, they have several games, modern and classic, that rank among my favorites.    Also, not that I'm particularly fond of using this criteria, but Nintendo games tend to just work as intended every time at launch. I think that should account for something in this day. Also, they are mostly timeless. Many of my favorite games I go back to and find that maybe they aren't as great as I remember, that's rarely if ever the case with Nintendo's games. I sometimes have issues going back to legacy controllers, but many of the games their studios produce are among the industry's elite."

Perceptions about whether a games overrated or not are pretty worthless as what buisness is it of anyone else if someone else enjoyed a game. In regards to Nintendo? No they aren't overrated since as with any of the big 3 they have detractors waiting in the woodwork to shit on anything they put out cause ""lol Nintendo"". That's not to say they haven't put shit games out, they have and rightfully got blasted such as Other M, Sticker Star,  Starfox Adventures,  hell look at the upcoming Metroid Federation Force. So no I don't think people can say Nintendo escapes criticism"
truegaming,3db6jf,UnidentifiedFlop,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:09:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think that using Nintendo characters mean the game is overrated at all. Nintendo games usually prototype the gameplay and assign characters or IP accordingly.  I think the polish, relatively glitch free and high amount of original gameplay ideas are what make the games great. Original music and controller concepts also contribute a lot.  This question seems to assume that everyone only plays Nintendo games for the characters. Nintendo has game developers that are passionate about gameplay and innovation. They almost always have an amazing soundtrack, they put consoles to their limit, without sacrificing performance and they have a direct relationship with fans.  I think naughty dog games could easily fit this idea. They have only made third person shooters, with little to no gameplay innovations for two generations now. Or bethesda, because they seem to get praised for developing aging, broken games but because they have the same amount of cheap content that every sandbox game has, they get a free pass"
truegaming,3db6jf,uberduger,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:10:20 2015 UTC,"Also, Nintendo franchises get tons of flak for fair or unfair reasons. Skyward Sword got negative reviews from someone because they didn't understand how to play the game and the review attributed that to control issues.  Look at Metroid Prime Federation Force, NSMBU and the new Animal Crossing games coming out. These games get negative press all the time, even before people have played them"
truegaming,3db6jf,snookums,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:21:00 2015 UTC,"I'm absolutely certain that Super Mario Galaxy would be just as well received if it was just a random character and by a random company.   Regardless of Mario in the game, that was one of the only games to do 3D platforming right in the last gen.  I can't speak for Smash as I don't really like it any more, but I loved the first one because it was a far simpler take on the beat-em up. I was definitely drawn in by the fact it had Nintendo characters, but what I liked most was the 'pummel each other for as long as you need to so that they can't recover and jump back on' mechanic. Was nice not to have to string huge combos together and just be able to keep hitting and throwing each other into submission."
truegaming,3db6jf,ryanman,2,Sun Jul 19 15:37:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think so. I've said before that reviewers seem to follow the principle that no one ever got fired by giving Nintendo a slightly higher score. With the exception of the Nintendo games that it's safe to diss a little bit (e.g. recent Mario Party games), they know Nintendo fans go insane with rage when someone doesn't give a main line Nintendo game at least a 9 on reviews. I remember people getting crucified for giving Twilight Princess less than a 9 and accused of ""doing it for attention.""  edit: Also, a lot of people seem to confuse ""polished"" with ""good."""
truegaming,3db6jf,boopaboopa,0,Sun Jul 19 16:06:51 2015 UTC,"Asking a bunch of Nintendo fans if Nintendo is overrated is a lost cause.   The truth is ""Absofuckinglutely"". Nintendo put out a console with a screen on the controller (a fucking terrible idea) that still runs at 480p. This is right after they declared a motion controller was the future - and they were right if ""The future"" meant a bunch of non-gamers buying a wii, playing it once, and then leaving it to gather dust.  Another user mentions splatoon - a hugely overrated TF2 clone that's crippled by Nintendo's absolute refusal to even do the bare minimum when it comes to online gaming. It's fucking 4v4! Are people insane?  Slap Nintendo's name on the newest low-res, overly-cartoony rehash with weak multiplayer (or none at all) and you're looking at an 8/10 reviews.  It kills me because they HAVE made great games. Still do. But they don't have to try at all, people will gobble it up without question."

Also, how is Splatoon a clone of TF2? I was simply throwing that out there because it's as ludicrous as calling Splatoon a clone of TF2. And to be fair, TF2 is not a sequel of the TF mod. It's a sequel to TFC which is a remake of the TF mod as a standalone game.  And if you think Splatoon doesn't look good, then you're seriously deluded."

truegaming,3db6jf,dylstew,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:50:18 2015 UTC,"Nintendo does seem to have a ""Cult of Apple"" thing going on among its fans. I like Nintendo games as much as the next guy but my tastes have changed a lot since I was a kid and while I do fire up emulators now and then to play the classics, I couldn't see myself buying a Nintendo console or game unless they tried to meet me halfway in terms of my tastes. My main beef with Nintendo is how safe and conservative they are with with IPs, how they keep refreshing the same IPs over and over again instead of developing new ones, and how dead set they are on only making games with child-friendly aesthetics, themes and so on (keep in mind this is not me saying they need to introduce violence or jump on any other mainstream bandwagons).   Nintendo is like Disney for me. If someone invites me to see a Disney movie I'll surely see it because Disney movies always delight my inner child and they're brilliantly made, however as someone who prefers mature subject matter in entertainment who doesn't feel the need to have my nostalgia pandered to, you wouldn't catch me obsessing over a Nintendo game/product for the same reasons you wouldn't catch me obsessing over Disney/Pixar movie. I would rather spend the bulk of my time playing games designed with the assumption that the audience playing them is adult. I want to play Deus Ex and be stimulated on every level, not a colourful, inoffensive platformer with cute characters that small children would enjoy wherein the only stimulation for me personally is the gameplay mechanics.   That said, speaking from experience, ""fanboys"" do not accept this position at all. Nintendo is the best gaming platform to them and nothing holds a candle to it. If you don't like Smash Bros., Zelda or Splatoon, or if your gaming preferences aren't defined by nostalgia/pleasing one's inner child and if you don't collect Amiibos obsessively, then you have bad taste. End of discussion. Anecdotally, one of my friends is a hardcore Nintendo fan (who is in his 30s) and despite me seeing him on Steam frequently, I saw him post on Facebook that he doesn't consider PC/Xbone/PS4 gamers 'gamers' for the same reason he doesn't consider his father a gamer for owning a pinball machine (and when I then called him out for spending 30 hours on Steam in two weeks he vehemently denied it).   Anecdotes aside, having observed that kind of ""Cult of Apple"" attitude among peers and on reddit a lot as well (ahem /r/gaming) I don't think it's a stretch to say that a lot of Nintendo games might be overrated due to the high regard that Nintendo is always placed in regardless of if it is deserving of that praise. I've seen Nintendo fans aggressively defend every decision Nintendo has made with the same ferocity that Apple fans do even when you know that they, themselves, are disappointed (for instance: how could anyone defend the Wii U's lacklustre specs?)   I think Nintendo's business model and design philosophies set them apart from the rest of the industry and this has secured them a kind of cult status for much the same reasons as Apple which is why loyal fans are hesitant to acknowledge what seems obvious to everyone else. This makes a lot of people wary of criticising them openly which is why Nintendo seems to avoid a lot of criticism and scrutiny.   Edit: me no grammar do well"
truegaming,3db6jf,binarian,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:57:07 2015 UTC,"Nintendo sometimes puts existing IP's onto an what would've been new IP game just to get more people to buy it. Thing is, they're often still good games on their own right, and wouls be if they were a new ip. It would probably be just as appriciated, but might fade into obscurity or get little sales. I'm not going to type a wall of arguments at the moment, a: hate typing on my pgone and b: someone else already made a great post I agree with, haha."
truegaming,3db6jf,Enhasiac,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:08:09 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, Nintendo does a very good job of making sure their IPs (at least, their Mario and Zelda IPs) are are only associated with high-quality games. In a sense, featuring those characters is itself a replacement for the old, ""Nintendo Seal of Quality"" from back in the NES days. Using the OP's example of the original Smash Bros., by having that game star Nintendo's top-tier characters rather than a new stable, it's a way to signal to buyers that, while this is a new and untested idea, Nintendo is exceptionally confident in its quality."
truegaming,3db6jf,ClintHammer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:14:49 2015 UTC,"I think it is more that Nintendo have a reputation for releasing games of good design and/or quality, and not treating their fans like dirt. so people are more forgiving when their games have flaws, because they can trust that they are willing to learn from mistakes, unlike other companies (who shall remain nameless even though we all know by now who they are).  other companies don't have this sort of reputation and/or a bad reputation, so people are more critical of their game's flaws, because their fans don't trust that they can get better. look at the hype around zelda Wii U despite skyward sword being generally unliked while people are already sharpening their pitchforks for the final fantasy VII remake despite no gameplay even being shown yet, because square-enix's fans don't trust square-enix any more (after XIII proved to be terrible in the eyes of most)."

truegaming,3db6jf,cbfw86,0,Tue Jul 14 22:53:51 2015 UTC,Every actor gives a different performance for the same characters in movies (the joker for example). In video games you can easily switch a skin and get the exact same performance. In games it is about gameplay regardless of whether you choose Batman's New 52 skin or Batman Beyond skin. We shouldn't compare gameplay to acting in movies.
truegaming,3db6jf,yumcake,-1,Tue Jul 14 23:00:34 2015 UTC,And we're not.   You completely missed the point
truegaming,3db6jf,cbfw86,0,Tue Jul 14 23:31:29 2015 UTC,"No. Nintendo games are widely unappreciated in today's gaming culture. Kids just want to play the same games over and over and over.  Look at the FF7 remake. Look at COD. Look at Halo. Look at the fourth Arkham game in about as many years. Look at how banal Assassin's Creed has become. Now compare that to the excitement around the next Zelda game which hasn't been truly unveiled yet. Compare it to Mario games which have timeless appeal, and has people excited for Mario Maker. That's brand control mastery you can't buy. Nintendo aren't overrated. The opposite is true."
truegaming,3db6jf,boopaboopa,3,Wed Jul 15 19:46:19 2015 UTC,"Hold on, I don't necessarily disagree, but you haven't made your case here.   Kids just want to play the same games over and over and over. Look at the FF7 remake. Look at COD. Look at Halo. Look at the fourth Arkham game in about as many years.   Nintendo has long been criticized for relying so heavily on sequels to their existing franchises as opposed to driving new IPs. Your post in it's current state is saying remakes and sequels are bad when others do it, but it's ok when Nintendo does it (""the next Zelda game"", ""Compare it to Mario Games"", ""excited for Mario Maker"")  If you want to make your point that Nintendo's sequels aren't the same as those produced by other companies, you have to point to Nintendo taking risks and doing interesting things with their sequel's gameplay, and creating what would normally be considered new IPs, but have merely disguised themselves under the familiar aesthetics of an existing IPs."
truegaming,3db6jf,MyPunsSuck,3,Wed Jul 15 22:20:09 2015 UTC,"Sequels don't matter. Gameplay matters. There is nothing to separate the COD games except controller layouts. There is nothing to separate the AC games. There is nothing to separate the Arkham games but wider spaces and a car. There is nothing to separate FF7 remake from the original's story and character development, which makes basically the same game given that they're story driven sagas.  Nintendo games at least change things up.  Mario 1 - running and jumping Mario 2 - picking up enemies and throwing them around Mario 3 - new power ups allowing swimming, flight, and new projectile 'combat' Mario 64 - 3D Mario Sunshine - completely different gameplay and objectives with FLUDD Mario Galaxy - introduction of contextual gravity and motion controls to give extra control Mario 3D World - couch co-op  Zelda 1 - full open world, paradigms set Zelda 2 - side scrolling dungeons Zelda 3 - world hopping, introducing problem solving to the overworld, not just dungeons Zelda 64 - 3D, first game to do day/night cycle, lock on combat Zelda WW - massive novel overworld with tight localised puzzles Zelda TP - return to classic Hyrule, formula largely unchanged Zelda SS - full motion controls, completely novel gameplay experience, new combat, sprinting, recycling of same locations with completely new puzzles  Kids today don't want new experiences. They scoff at motion controls and refuse to try anything other than a two-pronged controller that has four shoulder buttons, two sticks, a d-pad and four buttons. Everything else is dismissed as a gimmick. If they die it's an annoyance and not a measure of their skill. Indeed death is only considered to be part of the 'realism'. Batman has to die if he gets shot at because otherwise it would be unrealistic, but he can get shot at repeatedly and have his health regenerate. The screen going red in a shooter before health coming back is the exact same thing. GTA. Another game that doesn't change. GTA IV and GTA V are the same games but one has multiple protagonists and special abilities, and the Red Dead/Max Payne 3 weapon wheel. AC. Parkour on the same recycled assets from previous games, near identical combat, killing machine protagonist. When they craned the combat in Unity people were pissed at how hard it was. People just wanted to play the same third person action adventure game with regenerating health and a story driven campaign.  At the very least, Nintendo constantly seeks to ask the question, 'what will surprise our players?' Nothing about Arkham Knight surprised me. Nothing. Nothing about GTA V surprised me. They're solid games, don't get me wrong, but there's nothing new. At least Nintendo puts a smile on my face and seeks to innovate."
truegaming,3d7h9d,Hello-Universe,211,Tue Jul 14 02:56:32 2015 UTC,"Difficult competitive games need good skill based matchmaking to not drive most people away when they first try the game. Something like skins give the game longevity and added an added goal to the game that doesn't require improving skill in the game but if you're thrown in with the wolves immediately, most will give up. I don't think CSGO would be as popular today if all matches were done through the server browser and newbies come in and get stomped or flamed for sucking.   It's good to have servers that people can host themselves for tournaments or just custom gametypes that can build a community, but without good skill based matchmaking, high skill ceiling games would be frustrating to play. A good matchmaking system lets players still have fun while ""playing incorrectly."""
truegaming,3d7h9d,MythicalBacon,74,Tue Jul 14 03:47:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I know that the CSGO community is nowhere near as bad as some of the other online communities out there, but as a new player I haven't played the game in almost two weeks now because of how much shit I get from other players about me sucking. It just makes the experience way more stressful than a game should be and not fun at all. I don't want to be at the bottom of the scoreboard just as much as my teammates do but insulting me isn't going to make me play any better or want to come back to the game at all."
truegaming,3d7h9d,slayer4513,45,Tue Jul 14 05:29:18 2015 UTC,I'm pretty liberal with the mute button.  If someone is giving me non constructive criticism I just mute. I'm playing for fun and won't tolerate their anger.
truegaming,3d7h9d,99639,18,Tue Jul 14 05:33:57 2015 UTC,I mute people as well but I prefer not to. In a competitive game such as CS that relies heavily on teamwork and communication playing alone and in silence isn't that much better for me than dealing with some teammates complaining.

truegaming,3d7h9d,99639,11,Tue Jul 14 05:45:42 2015 UTC,"I suppose the people that I have been dealing with are somewhere more in the middle ground. Competent players who give callouts and don't talk when dead but complain when the round ends or have just started. They convey useful information at times but still contribute to the toxicity that is ultimately driving me away from the game. I understand their perspective, nobody likes to have a terrible player on their team especially when you are on a ladder and can be moved up and down based on the performance of teammates that you can have little control over, but at the same time I wish that they would understand the perspective of the new player trying to enjoy the game that they are clearly so passionate about."

I hate being a burden on my team and I really wish that the game would put me with worse players so that I could try and learn the game more and I realize that as I play more my rank will steadily go down until I hit that point but it's simply not fun playing the game in the meantime. If I could have my rank jump right into mid silver or wherever the hell I belong this instance I would, but I don't know if I want to keep playing in these higher lobbies until it finally clicks with the game that ""Hey, this guy doesn't belong here.

Placement matches do put you way out of your league to try and find where you should be put so it's natural that you'll fall flat on your face some times.  It's like if you had to play a game against D1 college basketball players... you would get absolutely schooled and look like an idiot.    The other thing is if you already have good FPS skills in general then you'll get ranked higher because of that but if you're new to CS you still won't know the game mechanics and flow, they call it ""game sense"".  Stuff like knowing where and when the enemy can move and why.  Until that knowledge catches up to your shooting skill you'll always look a little bit daft sometimes.  Anyway don't worry about it and stick with it, I'm really glad I did and CS gets super super fun."

Literally everybody has been from that D2-D1 category and even though I guess I have been getting my ass beat every single match the game refuses to move me down. It's pretty clear to everybody in the lobby that I don't belong there and if I got put there in a one off match or two I would be ok with it, but the fact that it happens every game makes me think that for some reason the game thinks that I belong there when I clearly don't."

As I stopped playing CSGO I've been playing a lot of Monster Hunter 4U and the community has been incredibly welcoming and friendly. It's really hard for me to break away from that warm community that I've been nestled between in for the past week to try and go and make something better out of a more toxic one. I'll probably end up giving it another shot at some point though, maybe if I find some people on a meetup subreddit or something like that but for now I don't feel like putting all that effort into making something bad work when I have something that is good and requires no effort to make good."

Usually it's just a remark or two about how bad I am doing, not really directed at me but jut kinda them talking to themselves. Sometimes it's more but I've never really had anybody yell or complain extensively, at least not over voice chat. I've had a few people complain a lot via chat but for the most part the people who are complaining aren't doing it during rounds where it would be directly hampering me. Most of them shut up during the meat of the rounds when they are dead but say things at the ends of rounds and at the very start of them. I just don't really like muting people in general unless I really have to because I really like trying to work together with my team. If somebody's being disruptive usually I'll try to politely address it with them first and only after if it doesn't work I go to the mute, and even then I often end up unmuting them and giving them a second chance (I don't usually tell them that they are unmuted though) after a few rounds just to see how it goes. The overwhelming majority of the time though they end up getting muted again before that round ends."

But if you've got people talking shit about how you play along with you being new it sounds like you're probably in the sort of skill level that absolutely does not require voice coms. I muted my way through silver and it didn't slow me down one bit. The fuckboys and trolls you're dealing with now become much more sparse the second there's some gold in your rank, and then you can maybe keep someone salty unmuted for the sake of tactics.  At silver you need to go for frags pretty much while communicating with the few people who aren't total shitheads. That's the best you can hope for, for now."

My advice would be twofold: First, warm up and cool down with DM. You should be at least middle of the pack in DM before you move to comp MM if you can swing it. Even if not a quick 10 minute round will at least get you in ""the zone"". I'm not a high matchmaking rank but I'm first in nearly every DM match I play.

Maybe I just get too nervous about letting my team down now that it's not me, and the players are certainly a higher caliber as well, but for whatever the reason all of my aim and spray control and just everything goes down the shitter. I might try to find some other low ranked/newer players on reddit or something but I don't really know if I want to try and make something good out of the game right now. I've been playing a lot of monster hunter in the absence of CS and the community has been incredibly welcoming. I just don't really feel like working so hard to have a good experience with CS at the moment when I have a fantastic and friendly experience every time I load up monster hunter for no extra effort or work whatsoever."

They are people who have been banned (and this is their new account), smurfs (people who deliberately get a lower rank so they can play on lower skill levels), or k/d min/maxers.  So, that group of people that should be at the same skill level as you are actually veterans, and therefore, will always look down on a newbie.

truegaming,3d7h9d,SwanChairUh,8,Tue Jul 14 17:34:03 2015 UTC,"It's hard to make a direct comparison with CS.  Op talks about the commander positions which is INCREDIBLY important.  I haven't even played the game but I've played other similar games and know the effect it can have.  (Played Savage 1&2)  The commander in these games can make a superior team lose quite easily if they are terrible.  Again I've never played NS2 but I know it's a very similar game to the Savage game where a commander builds bases and researches upgrades for the players fighting in first person.  Basically a lot of the RTS skills apply while also having to know the abilities of your FPS team.  In my opinion it's very rewarding but extremely complex gameplay.  I would say no other games come close to the complexity overall with games like NS2, Savage 2, or the older similar games like the Empire HL2 mod which is another RTS/FPS hybrid."
truegaming,3d7h9d,Rednys,8,Tue Jul 14 07:04:37 2015 UTC,"The original NS community was quite a bit toxic towards commanders in general. There isn't room to play and experiment. If you didn't do a specific build order by a specific time, men winning or losing their fights during that time, you got booted or worse someone telling everyone you're an idiot because you didn't keep shotties and jetpacks.  Your team could genuinely be bad, but fuck. They demand to keep dying while wearing expensive gear."
truegaming,3d7h9d,notavalid,3,Tue Jul 14 14:37:54 2015 UTC,"I wasn't playing in super competitive games but when I played NS2 it seemed like people generally were too anxious - nobody wanted to play commander because it's REALLY important and if you're bad you fuck up the game for everybody.  However most players seemed to be pretty nice about it. The first time I played commander was maybe 5 or 6 games in and it was because my team encouraged me to do it - they basically said give it a shot, see if you are okay at it and if you're not you can just hop off and let someone else do it.  Having said that on a competitive level the commander is definitely the most important player and having a very skilled one would be crucial to securing victories... so I can see how many people are put off by that either because it's too hard finding one who can consistently play and be online and be good or they ARE one and it's too stressful since you'd likely draw your team's ire at a higher level pretty quickly."

And anyways, you're need to think about it this way. Being able to follow a build order doesn't make a good commander, or it wouldn't be a struggle at the beginning of each match to get one.  It doesn't matter if people memorize the strategies, because the only way they'll get good at them is with practice. I've played enough games to know ""This is not a practice session.

If you dropped a single turret in the base you were likely to get canned immediately.   The other problem (and great thing about NS) is the power that single skilled player can have, which is exacerbated by a lack of upgrades. A single skilled skulk can wipe out a whole team, and a single skilled marine can do so as well, so if a commander is crappy at all the chances of the team getting owned by some super-cop is even more likely.  I loved NS but this is the same thing that happened with the old game. There was nowhere for the newbies to improve and none of the vets wanted to play with the newbies so the game died."

I still think the people who could kill 2 or three sulks in a tunnel with one clip were cheating. No fking way.   I loved NS but this is the same thing that happened with the old game.

Combat pushed the life of that game out a lot... And caused a lot of problems with the NS2 crowd."
truegaming,3d7h9d,notavalid,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:33:52 2015 UTC,"I played NS1 competitively for a while, and was a decent fade (mediocre lerk). The marines in that game had some crazy air moving (aliens too), there were a bunch of tricks you could pull to increase survivability. If a skulk bit you you could use the force of the bite to bunnyhop backwards, giving you plenty of room to take one down. The hit registration in that game plus the low graphics requirements made it very stable, so the people that were good were REALLY good. I'd say 3 skulks in an lmg clip, one with 7 from the pistol, and another with the last three bullets and a knife stab were certainly possible, especially if your commander was medspamming you for being a boss.  Most guys only used two scripts or macros: one to autofire the pistol fast (two shots per click) and one to spam jump for bunnyhopping. The rest of it is just pure ""I'm in high school and all I do is play videogames"" skill building.  I got banned from a lot of pub servers for ""hacking"" and I was in a shitty farm (CO2) team for a better clan. If you knew how to wall strafe and bunnyhop and everything you were very hard to kill as a marine, especially against vanilla skulks. I solo'd a lot of alien teams in pubs just by nailing people as they spawned with a pistol (you spawned one at a time back in the day), same as a skulk against vanilla marines if they sucked or were new.   That game is definitely my favorite I've ever played. I've never had as much fun as I did learning to bunnyhop and getting to know how to move quickly as a marine and leap strafe as a skulk. As a marine you could always increase speed if you could jump just barely any higher, or if you looked at an angle away from the wall and strafed. I knew I'd been playing too much when one day in real life I contemplated brushing up against a wall at school to wallstrafe to class faster.  https://youtu.be/zd6H1P-NzAY?t=46  I really wanna play again now haha."

truegaming,3d7h9d,notavalid,3,Fri Jul 17 04:51:24 2015 UTC,"even casual games can have that. When I was a kid and I played talesrunner the game was attracting a lot of new players so when I started the game I was thrown in with a bunch of other new players. Ocasionally you'd end up in a game with a couple of good players and they would wreck your face because they knew how to utilise a bug/mechanic called dash jumping. fortunately you had time to learn this from those players and the forums before you got thrown into the games where every player could already do this.  nowadays if you try to play this game its almost exlusively comprised of people rapidly approaching their 20's or already in them who used to play the game as kids. When some kids try to pick the game up they get utterly stomped by the good players which just so happens to be everyone else playing the game and won't last long unless they're playing exclusively with other friends new to the game or they have a friend whose willing to teach them and they're willing to put in the effort.  the korean version of this game is still ridiculously successful because pretty much every 12 year old plays the game there and doesn't know how to dash jump. The US/EU server is full of elitists however and even the worst regular player on the server could run the map atleast twice as fast as a newbie. Any newbies playing the game on their own will probably never get to see a full map before they quit the game.  Servers for this game will just keep shutting down unless they spend more money than any company hosting it has on marketing. The only way for it to be sucessful is if it has a large number of new players coming in constantly that vastly outnumbers the 500 or so good regulars and renders the 20 or so godlike players unnoticable.  also needs to protect itself better against hackers, 1 dude has been holding that entire community hostage for almost a year now."

This is an interesting comment to me because that's exactly how OG Counter Strike worked and it became and remained hugely popular for years. Obviously over time player expectations and personalities change, but 15 years ago dropping into a pub server and being told to ""get gud"" or having the occasional asshole rage and TK was just part of the nature of playing the game.  Interesting that now some people like OP would consider something like that basically unplayable."

truegaming,3d7h9d,Pinecone,2,Tue Jul 14 03:56:21 2015 UTC,This is true but it may not have been possible for the devs to work that in. Team matchmaking requires a tremendous amount of players to work unless you want people waiting an hour for a good one. NS2 at the peak of its popularity also had other issues like poor optimization and probably other technical problems that were more pressing at the time. This combined with unforgiving gameplay lead to fast drops after big sales push. Every time NS2 went on sale you always see people say it's a good game but nobody sticks around to find out why.  I think they could've avoided this by not going all out and making their own game engine but the game was a major success in terms of sales. The devs do deserve a bit of respect for not dumbing the game down and staying true to the original.
truegaming,3d7h9d,acepincter,2,Tue Jul 14 12:39:08 2015 UTC,"The Planetside 2 system does away with matchmaking completely, and for this reason I loved it far more than any other squad/team shooter I've ever played.

truegaming,3d7h9d,Bleachi,2,Tue Jul 14 14:31:14 2015 UTC,"It was a different beast.   Not reliant on a commander, one player who takes all the flak for their team's loss. Not as reliant on your team being well, either. A good player could easily get 2-3 kills every round. Even if your team sucked, you could still have fun. Servers were funded by members buying admin and such, which led to many players joining clans. Clan scrims were a great place for semi-competitive matches. Even if you didn't play competitively, the server system meant people would stick to their servers, which built communities. You didn't have to deal with random strangers if you didn't want to. Other gametypes for the casual players, like deathmatch, Nipper maps, zombies, surf, bunnyhop, KZ, Superhero, WC3, WC3 FT, UWC3, etc.   It's good to compare, though. I was thinking along the same lines. I don't think random matchmaking is enough for a game that is so dependent on your team. There needs to be a better environment for building communities. CS 1.x did this almost entirely on accident."
truegaming,3d7h9d,jackpg98,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:50:39 2015 UTC,"This is the biggest reason why Chivalry: Medieval Warfare is now a very niche game.

truegaming,3d7h9d,banktwon1,36,Thu Jul 16 04:24:42 2015 UTC,"The community of Natural Selection 2 reminded me a lot of CS:GO/MOBAs except instead of having in-depth ranks, elo, matchmaking and all that... it was just pug 10v10.  Even when real-life friends and I made up a good half a team, it was kind of off-putting how toxic and quithappy everybody was. And it was odd too, my friends and I would get berated for being something like a bad Commander and that the game was ""GG"", yet nobody else seemed willing to actually pick Commander during the next round.  The severs we played on very much gave off those MOBAesque ""I'm good because you're bad"" vibes, also a crapload of surrendering for dubious ""was GG at start"" type reasons (the f4 surrender spam was rampant as fuck). Which is a shame since there seemed to be a lot of depth to the game, yet most people seemed to fight over a few prominent classes and map positions to wrack up kills, and then just spend the rest of the time shit-talking or trying to get the team to surrender via voice comms.  Truthfully if I wanted to take random serverplay that seriously, I would just go back to something like CS:GO/LoL where the ranking system has actual rewards and a semblance of meaning. Natural Selection 2 has some depth but not nearly the matchmaking to really make it worthwhile to learn and put up with bad teammates."

truegaming,3d7h9d,theraydog,2,Tue Jul 14 14:41:30 2015 UTC,"I think part of the reason for team stacking is that people feel a hell of a lot more familiar with playing a marine than they do some weird alien bug. Every alien has different mechanics, the lerk's fly around and shoot spikes, the phades teleport and meelee, etc.  When you play a marine it's you and your various guns versus the aliens, it's a lot simpler for noobs trying to play to have that level of comfort. At least it feels like something they've played before, instead of looking through a zerglings mouth."
truegaming,3d7h9d,sirgallium,2,Tue Jul 14 18:51:01 2015 UTC,"I just wrote a gigantic post, but you summarized almost everything I said very succinctly. Wayyyy to much giving up too early. Too many people taking it super seriously and being toxic.  Those really are the largest problems I think. I also mentioned that I would like to see some sort of map changes to make the games longer, more complex, and give more room for creativity. Maybe have multiple types of resources, or larger maps, so that nobody could call GG within the first 5 mins because both teams haven't even taken over half the map at that point."
truegaming,3d7h9d,MasterEvilAce,29,Tue Jul 14 18:45:17 2015 UTC,"The game had fairly poor performance for quite a while after release. Now, the game runs fine, except the loading times have barely improved for me. It takes a couple of minutes to get into a game, so you miss the early game, or you get in and the map changes and you do it all over again. So the ""drop in and play"" factor isn't that great, since if you don't find a good server right off the bat, you might as well give up hope playing. (Obviously a lot of people don't have loading issues, but I do, even though the game is on a dedicated drive and such.) The performance not being so great for a long time turns off a lot of people almost immediately. The hype dies down and the community is small.  From a game perspective, marines are clunky as hell, and aliens run around all over the place. The skilled players have no issues dealing tons of damage in an instant without being hit, and new players lose track of their surroundings in fights and flail around more than anything.  Whoever wins the game generally comes down to the commander.. if you have a bad commander your experience suffers as marines can't do a whole hell of a lot on their own. This leads to many people getting rejected from the chair time after time to the point where nobody wants to even get into it anymore.  Spending all your resources on suiting up and then dying cripples you to the point where you have to turtle for long periods of time... and you can turtle for a LONG time. This is super unsatisfying for the losing team as well as the winning team. It basically comes down to either suiciding trying to gain some sort of advantage over and over, or a bunch of players from one team leaving and the game naturally ending that way from imbalance.  Players that come into a match late have no idea where the bases are setup easily, no idea which players to watch out for, etc. There's a lot of information to take in before you can feel comfortable and grounded in the current game.  I played a hell of a lot of original NS, and the game was great aside from exploits (jetpack being based on FPS)... then they made a bunch of changes and NS1 kind of fell off. NS2 got rid of a lot things that made Marines vs Aliens fun (for me at least.) Aliens could run around on their own and cause havoc... they could heavily fortify parts of the map requiring siege turrets and grenades to take them out.   In NS2, Marines and Aliens have basically the same playstyle. They both build similarly and at a similar pace (so it's base vs base instead of aliens having random obstacles everywhere)... they still have to fight in somewhat equal numbers to do well, and combat is way more chaotic and unresponsive. Alien wall climbing sucks because the map ceilings are too complex, and aliens can hide better due to lots more shadows. Lastly, Gorges hardly build much at all as the commander controls most of that. There was a lot of strategy that was killed by giving aliens a commander (all of the aliens saving resources so it pools up, aliens drop a 2nd hive and all of the aliens instantly get evolutions.)  Those are all my experiences with NS2. It's a good idea, but it lost a LOT of charm that the original game had. NS1 also had really awesome level design, being able to weld vents and doors was HUGE and unique. NS2 felt like it was more about the engine than the gameplay, and because the engine was finicky for quite a while, the gameplay suffered even more. Powernodes are also not interesting in actual play... aliens spend so much time killing them and marines just put'em back up quickly. They're just not fun at all from either side.  The game would be way better if it felt more like a MOBA... I play a lot of League of Legends, and a lot of things that make it addicting are not in NS2. In a moba, the team that is behind still has a ton of options. A team that is REALLY far behind loses quickly. The longer a game goes, the faster everybody powers up.. the game tries to end itself after a certain time limit. NS doesn't really have this. If you fall behind in NS2, you basically have no resources coming in.. which means you can't do shit. All you can do is turtle for 15 minutes and hope you can evolve to something good.  I want to like NS2, and I still feel like playing it from time to time, but whenever I do I feel the same disappointment that I always had from it. At this stage of its life, the graphics look pretty dated except for the newest maps. The lighting is still great though, really when all the power gets knocked out. You just don't see that much."

A Marine team with a lot of mines is a real bitch.  Lerks all up in your ass? Tech to Shotguns. Shotguns instantly shut down Lerks, and they're reduced to just spiking you from a distance.   Want to extend map control? Tech to Phasegates.   Fades? If you've already got Shotguns, you might want to upgrade Weapons more.   Onos? Tech to Jetpacks ASAP, and I hope you've got your Weapons teched.   Shade hive and Phantom skulks? Scan for your Marines once in a while.   People keep getting into your base? Maybe scan for a tunnel.   Just remember that if you get spawn-rushed, beacon, and keep dropping medpacks and ammo. You're golden.  Aliens  Waaay more off hands. Just remember: cyst places, use Drifters to build. Shift Hive and Spurs are generally a safe bet. Maybe micro your Drifter abilities a bit if you want to feel special. Don't waste money on Whips and Shifts and Crags and Shades, but drop them if your players ask for them until you know where they can do good."

truegaming,3d7h9d,Fascist_Pink,3,Tue Jul 14 08:51:49 2015 UTC,"Most people get grumpy with rookies for two reasons:   They hop in the comm chair without reading guides, and no microphone. They stack a side, rather than evenly spreading themselves around the teams.   Which is fair, I feel. Unbalanced teams and poor commanders lead to unsatisfactory matches. There is zero fun in being egg-locked. You should go about NS2 like any other multiplayer game; don't jump in the deep end and not expect to drown."
truegaming,3d7h9d,Misaniovent,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:16:52 2015 UTC,"I've had the opposite experiences. First, people usually only get frustrated at rookies who waste resources. More often than not, however, the problem isn't rookies in the command chair. It's that no one is in the command chair. Mind you, I haven't played the game in a few months but I've played off and on since it was released."
truegaming,3d7h9d,Fascist_Pink,8,Tue Jul 14 15:10:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there are waits before matches because sometimes just nobody wants to command. Of course, that doesn't mean they want a rookie too. It's not a great situation."

Not nearly as good as the best. Nobody really complained, and if they did (healthpacks, upgrades) I just listened and did it immediately and they forgot. It's all about multitasking and memory, and making the right decisions.  It's a standard learning curve. It's proven people learn differently. That's not the issue. The issue is the players didn't like to support failure. The problem is success is rooted in failure. That was the recipe for disaster.  I tried to play tonight and there was NO servers. I waited 20 mins a que for the only server available, and the only people playing seemed to be all the hardcoes I recongized from six months ago. As soon as the audio started, so did the soap opera. They were arguing with each other about strategies.  this game is hopeless now. They needed to implement a server/rank system from day 1 that grouped people by level or time played. Then they needed to market the shit out of the game to gain a bigger following. It failed. That's all that can be said for this good game, a tragic ending."

truegaming,3d7h9d,Fascist_Pink,6,Fri Jul 17 14:28:10 2015 UTC,"As far as commanders go, it's always been that way with games in which one person could take a significantly different command role for the whole team. Remember when you had a bad commander in Battlefield 2? And then if your team somehow won, your commander wound up getting the gold medal without doing anything. I hated that guy.   Sometimes I understand the hate for new commanders, but you just have to do it and take the abuse until you can competently command.   I miss Natural Selection II though, a game in which I only made the mistake of trying to command once."

The reason player retention is poor is because there's a population of extremely talented players, who have been playing the game for years. A good Marine player is almost unkillable; these are the guys that can come out on top when it's just them against four skulks. Nigh-perfect aim, a talent for side-stepping, and an eye for placement; a player who has those skills can literally shut down an entire lane on a map.  It doesn't help that playing Aliens is difficult. It's a whole other sort of game; movement is foreign, everything is based around ambush and melee..."
truegaming,3d7h9d,KDBA,7,Tue Jul 14 05:52:45 2015 UTC,"Natural selection has a long history. I haven't played NS in a long time, and I didn't play much NS2, so I don't even feel qualified to comment on this. But the answers here focus on the ""now"" when trying to come up with reasons why it failed, and I don't think that's the right approach. Or at least, it's not the whole story.  First of all, I'm not sure you can even say it failed. The game was released a few years ago, and it was in payed beta for a long time before that. Online games come and go, and the fact that a game dies eventually doesn't really say anything about wheter or not it was a success.  Secondly, there's a game called ""NS2:Combat"", which basically strips the game of it's RTS elements and makes it a more traditional online shooter. As a game mode, this could have been a good thing, but beeing released as a standalone game rubbed a lot of players the wrong way, and might have had an impact in splitting the comunity and guiding potential new players away form the original NS2. This might be the biggest mistake from the side of the developers, since a more casual mode could have alleviated some of the problems people are describing here, instead, the way they handled things hurt the longevity of the game.  Thirdly, the original NS was released in 2002 or so. It's plausable that many of the still active players have beeing playing that game in one form or another for the better part of a decade. There is some justification to beeing annoyed by new players who don't know what they're doing. That's not a good thing, but it's hardly something special, especially not in a community that has been declining in numbers for a long while."

truegaming,3d7h9d,kickit,5,Thu Jul 16 23:27:54 2015 UTC,"Elitist tournament play obsessed players ruined it IMO. NS1 drew me in as a young teen because of the incredible sci-fi Aliens 2 style atmosphere and brilliant eerie soundtrack by Jeremey Soule (same guy who did Morrowind OST). The sound effects, sprites and effects they added on top of the HL1 ones were epic.  There was so much to choose from, and as a young teen I spent many hours using the hammer editor and mapping. I never finished a map though. Still.  NS2 focused entirely on tournament elite play and didn't really recreate or improve the great atmosphere the mod had.  In fact as far as I know, volumes of water are not even added to the engine yet."
truegaming,3d7h9d,9999squirrels,2,Tue Jul 14 05:14:17 2015 UTC,"Well, as you've sortof explained, mechanics like the commander are awesome in theory but very difficult to implement in practice. You get a very high pressure role that is difficult to learn without messing up games in a big way, drawing nasty criticism from the rest of the team.  I liked the concept of NS2 and thought the gameplay was solid, but admittedly tough to learn. Even when you're not commanding, the gameplay can be confusing. There's a lot going on, and it usually isn't obvious what you should be doing.  The alien classes are tricky. It takes effort to figure out the interface, and the base 'zergling' class relies on tactics, teamwork, and not engaging the enemy directly. Not easy for new players.  And of course, it's overall very tough to carve out a lasting community for an indie multiplayer game like this. I see the same thing bound to happen with Insurgency, a game I love quite a bit. Outside of free weekends, the game's very tough on new players, and I don't think either of them are going to hit critical mass.  It's ok. This happens. I was a big fan of Dystopia too, which was one of those obscure 'fun while it lasted' multiplayer shooters. Unless it becomes a surprise hit, very, very few indie multiplayer shooters are going to have a long lifespan. That's just part of how these games work."
truegaming,3d7h9d,TheSolf,5,Tue Jul 14 04:16:49 2015 UTC,"Anybody new came in they were almost ostrasized for asking questions, or god forbid, trying to command a match for the first times.

truegaming,3d7h9d,Bleach3825,3,Wed Jul 15 02:47:30 2015 UTC,I think NS2 would have really benefitted from a default inclusion of combat NS. It allows people easier familiarity with the mechancis of playing an alien or the marine weapons and expands the userbase to a little wider.  It hooks people who might not have otherwise tried the base game.

truegaming,3d7h9d,silsae,3,Tue Jul 14 23:33:38 2015 UTC,"As a former NS and NS2 player, the main reason why I think NS2 failed to gain traction is its engine. They decided to waste time and resources to create their own in-house engine that is exceptionally badly optimized. Just the loading times showed that something was off about it.  It is a very pretty game, but it requires far too much horsepower all things considered, especially compared to other, similarly pretty games. That limits the potential playerbase. Had they stuck to an engine like Source 2 or the Unreal engine, it would have a larger playerbase to start with and more resources to make sure the game gained traction.  It's a shame really. NS2 was probably the best teambased shooter of its time."
truegaming,3d7h9d,SecretWeapon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:12:02 2015 UTC,Yes. I think only the dynamic infestation (which hardly added much compared to NS1) needed a new engine. If they'd released earlier backed by a proper engine (Unreal) things could have gone better and we'd now be getting NS3 with fancy matchmaking + other new gimmicks.
truegaming,3d7h9d,captaindealbreaker,5,Tue Jul 14 20:19:00 2015 UTC,"Kind of funny reading this. It's exactly what happened to the TFC community.

truegaming,3d7h9d,SirJohnHammond,3,Tue Jul 14 21:58:02 2015 UTC,They didn't help things by taking one of the mods for NS2 and making it a Standalone game that's basically NS2 without commanders http://store.steampowered.com/app/310110/
truegaming,3d7h9d,Sentenced2Burn,5,Tue Jul 14 06:26:39 2015 UTC,Yup.  Had the game launched with the combat mode I think it would be doing much better.  Combat servers provided an entry to the game for new and casual players.
truegaming,3d7h9d,GNU-two,6,Tue Jul 14 08:51:00 2015 UTC,"I used to play a lot of Natural Selection competitively from version 1.03 and honestly, NS2 never had any of the same magic. It's understandable, considering I was in my teens when playing the mod and had a proper internet connection for the first time, but the main reason I never REALLY liked NS2 was the poor performance, it sort of prevented me to get that invested in the game. Fluid gameplay and controls are the basis for anything competitive, and considering playercounts, the poor performance was even worse on public servers. If I remember correctly, at least at the time, the game was very CPU-dependant and mine was a high-end, overclocked Intel quad-core that you'd think would be enough. I'm somewhat impressed by the players that were still able to be dominant.     I felt like the 'performance optimization' patches were implemented way too late and being at least a partial reason to the competitive scene dwindling before it really took off. Instead we got stuff like exo-suits that I'd imagine taking a lot of time creating and balancing, their team is quite small after all so there must be some overlapping between the people making these things."

The first few matches I figured it was my fault for being new to the game, but after a week of getting brutally curbstomped in every match, I said ""fuck this shit"" and uninstalled it.

truegaming,3d7h9d,Yorn2,2,Tue Jul 14 03:38:16 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of your insights are naive. Sorry to be frank about it. You're fairly new to the game though so I understand where you're coming from.  I've been playing the series since 2002. Natural Selection 1 was popular because it was a free mod for Half Life 1 which had a very optimized engine which people were accustomed to. Natural Selection 1 died in 2006/2007 in terms of all servers that were populated becoming more or less Combat servers. This is also roughly when the professional scene switched from NA dominance to European dominance. About this time is when I consider the spirit of the game to have died.  Natural Selection 2 had more of a rolling release so it's hard to say when the spirit of the game actually started. Let's say around 2012. So its been about 3 years as opposed to 4. However, the player saturation levels are way different between these two games. Why?  Very poor optimization is the answer. Very poor CPU and graphics optimization coupled with very poor netcode (the coding that verifies hit registry and player location caching between peers and the server). This is true for both the game client and server executables.  The server executable is so horrendous that it only uses a single CPU core (two threads, one is virtualized for AI calculations). Additionally a clock speed of at least 4.0GHz is required for any server that has ~22 slots. This means that servers can't be hosted by server hardware like Xeon chips because all Xeons below E5 chips are non unlocked chips with modest clockspeed. Every single server needs to have an Intel CPU with the designator K at the end which signifies an unlocked multiplier and allows the chip to be overclocked. Natural Selection 2 servers require chips with very high single thread performance.  NS2 servers also run at 30 tick rate, which is a base refresh cycle the server uses for the calculation of all interactions. All functions related to player movespeed, player hit registration, AI (drifters, MACs, whips, hydras, etc), physics, and so on depend on this variable. For reference, pub TF2 and CS servers run at 66 tick while competitive servers run at 100. I've personally set up a server for drills to test out changing rates and their effect on hit registration and found that changing all these variables (to 100) makes everything much crisper for the 2 minutes before the server becomes so unstable (CPU usage spikes to maximum with 4 players on a 2500k @ 4GHz) that the server crashes.  Forgetting the server, the game was coded in C++ with a tie in for Lua. Lua was important to Unknown Worlds because it allowed for modular player modifications and later help with integration into the Steam Workshop. In fact, the release of NS2 was delayed by a significant amount in order to finish work on Decoda, an IDE for Lua. Little did Unknown Worlds know that Lua would greatly affect the way the game is rendered because it was so inefficient. It was inefficient because every little thing in the game became a virtual machine instance. For instance, you know the ammo counter on the assault rifle? That was a virtual machine. It was so sloppy and wasted so much CPU time that when the CDT got a hold of the game source they made a post highlighting this and immediately fixed it. If the game utilized multiple cores better, it probably wouldn't matter as much.  So - it's not the players or toxic community at fault here. It's optimization.   NS1 had an even worse learning curve as high level play was completely dependant on  knowing how to perfectly bunny hop and rely on players to be selfless (gorges saving for hive and structures and being much more independent) rather than have an alien commander which places structures.  Also hive skill rating is really poor, as players can just switch team when they're losing to bolster their hive skill rating, or wait to join in order to ensure their ranking."
truegaming,3d7h9d,Leezoat,2,Tue Jul 14 05:29:22 2015 UTC,"You're naive as well, though in a different way: you're experiencing a cognitive bias called the ""curse of knowledge."" Basically, people who have a lot of information or knowledge about a topic (you, in this case) often have a hard time thinking about the topic from the POV of someone less informed. I think that for someone who has played that much, issues like net code would be clear (I think net code complaints are the lowest level of complaints about games, personally), but for any new player coming in, I think OP describes the situation fairly accurately. Net code may still be an issue of course, but crappy net code doesn't turn me off from a game nearly as quickly as everyone being toxic to new players."
truegaming,3d7h9d,Snarfler,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:46:04 2015 UTC,"The effect of net code on gameplay may not affect a new player as much, but the problems he's talking about with server demands might mean that there are less servers to join, and of course when so many are private a new player is stuck with the two or three open to the public."
truegaming,3d7h9d,Keranth,2,Tue Jul 14 18:05:22 2015 UTC,"As a regular (5+ year) NS1 player, this comment makes the most amount of sense, based on my experience, but I do agree with the OP that toxicness is an issue. I also think the long release time for NS2 killed most of my interest (I had already moved on to other games).  My very first interaction with NS2 was horribly laggy and I'm very well-versed on tweaking settings. I was even loading custom drivers and adding config lines to make it just ""playable"" with a top-of-the-line graphics card around late beta.  Also, I tried it again later on after they fixed some of those issues and found the community borderline toxic, but it kind of reminded me of NS1 so I was used to it. I still remember thinking, ""How is a new player going to tolerate this?"" The stuff game developers could get away with when there weren't many good multiplayer games and mods they just can't get away with today. Games that have clear degrees of skilled players need some form of management. Sure, LoL has some toxic players, but they can be reported and dealt with. NS2 doesn't have that, AFAIK. And I don't think it needs it either, but instead a matchmaking system would have been great.  So to sum up my opinion, I think it was a combination of what both of you had to say, honestly. I think I played maybe 6 hours of NS2 in late beta and then when I played again a year later post-release it was maybe for another 12 hours. Both the crappy graphic/net code and lack of matchmaking made it an easy pass for me, though."

I got NS2 quite early and really tried to love it, because the concept is just fantastic, but the game was missing something. Between the technical problems, generally a very aggresive community and low playerbase, it just didn't manage to keep me playing. A few of my friends share the same opinion."

The learning curve certainly is pretty damn high for new players but one thing Unknown Worlds also didn't do was a lot of media/press release to keep the game in the gamins news.  When this post on Reddit is the first thing i heard about NS 2 in two years... it's bad."
truegaming,3d7h9d,maico3010,2,Tue Jul 14 12:20:35 2015 UTC,"NS1 is my all time favourite multiplayer game, hundreds of hours went into competitive play, making maps and admining servers.  Made friends who are now considered some of my best friends who I regularly meet IRL.  The senses of community in that game was unrivaled.  In my opinion NS2 failed because of performance,  FPS was never stable, personally I spent a lot of money building a very strong PC and it didn't stable the FPS I had ingame.  I'm sure it's better now as they've optimized their engine over the years but its too late.  I have around 500hours in NS2 and while it's still a great game to me I do wish they didn't build their own engine and just used Source and ported NS1 to that with improved and polished gameplay/controls.  Also alien commander didn't need to be a thing, allowing players to gorge and build structures felt more ""alien""."
truegaming,3d7h9d,Burning_Titan,2,Tue Jul 14 12:35:19 2015 UTC,"Been playing Natural Selection since its initial 1.0 release for Half-Life. I really loved the game up until the original moved from 1.03 to NS1 2.0, this is where they added things like combat mode and completely changed game dynamics for fast competitive play. The original was a blast simply because it was so forgiving, it wasn't uncommon for games to stalemate for well over 4-5 hours of fierce fighting even if the teams had new players. That was the fun of it for me, it could be incredibly hard to grab new territory yet so rewarding if you did so, all while feeling much more casual. With NS1 2.0, they made a lot of fixes that made the rounds go faster which drove up the demand for great commanders/players and pretty much ending up with what you see now. They've pushed it even further with NS2, I tried it a few times in closed beta, then tried it a few more times later on, I just can't get into it any more. Striving to be the next counter-strike in e-sports rather than being a fun FPS RTS title is what is killing this game, always has been."

It's like needing so many kills in TF2 to change classes and you dont unlock it you just get it for one life.   It takes the fun out of it a bit when you wait so long for something, especially when your new, only get to stomped like all the time to get that means nothing and your back to basics again.  So it's not just the elitism, it's the lack of ability for new players to explore the more advanced monsters n stuff without just getting stomped and ending up back with the basics. You kind of mention this with new players trying to command as this is another aspect that new players just can't get a handle on without being torn apart by your own pissed off team.

truegaming,3d7h9d,sirgallium,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:08:37 2015 UTC,"This is a recent post I made on the /r/ns2 subreddit in response to the game:   I tried to get back into playing awhile back. I gave up because the only servers that are actually 6v6 are locked to some fucking retarded ""minimum [x] hundred hours"" bullshit. That's only as measured by UWE's community stats page, rather than my Steam page?  You fucking stupid ass kids. I played NS1 from the fucking beta back when playing meant you booted up the WON.net HL client. Before Steam was even a thing on Valve's whiteboards. I played NS2 from the fucking alpha when the skulks were as big as wolves. I've got the goddamn black armor for paying the extra money to them on the first damn day they took orders for the game for fuck's sake. My NS2 time on Steam is over 200 hours. I had random people calling on me to sub for missing players in their damn competitive matches and I would outplay their whole fucking team in the process.  Yet I don't qualify to join your 6v6 server because I don't want to sit there and play unbalanced-as-fuck 9v9-12v12 for another [x] hundred hours to register on my UWE stats? The ONLY 6v6 server with a decent ping? The only decent ping servers all being 18-24 players is the entire reason I STOPPED playing in the first damn place.  As much as I loved NS (probably more than 5k hours logged into that damn game) and enjoyed NS2, I just have no interest in getting back into it. Not after experiencing the idiocy that is the current community. I'm sad to see the game's fidgeting corpse. UWE's game design is something special and it doesn't get the adoration it deserves.     Even people that are returning veterans aren't tolerated by the community. Sure, a couple guys on the boards told me to join some scrim matches for their ENSL or whatever... But man, I don't have time for that and I know I'm too rusty to get back into it with scrims right off the bat.  The problem is that asymmetric competitive games are a niche genre. Evolve is dead and it's what, less than a year old? Fuck, I know I haven't played it in months. L4D/L4D2 have been dead for ages.  There is just too much else available out there that provides instant gratification via things like matchmaking for a game like NS2 to be released as it had been. And it's not even necessarily about instant gratification. Matchmaking simply removes the tedium and annoyance of having to find your own servers and players. It's why I don't play TF2 anymore. The Valve matchmaking is shite and digging through the veritable MOUNTAINS of garbage servers (""LOL JOIN LOTUSCLAN, LOL JOIN SKIAL, LOL JOIN [some other fucktard zerg group trying to use me for advertisement revenue]"") to find the few active community servers. Meanwhile, I could load up Dota 2 and fuck up a couple of games with my lack of skill and not give two shakes of a fuck about it. I've honestly considered getting into CSGO a little bit because of the matchmaking and knowing how to not care about my fellow players. I used to play CS pretty heavily, so I could probably figure it out after awhile of fucking around. Or I could get back into playing Smite...which won't happen.  I mean, fuck, I play FFXIV. There is automated party building available in that game. And while it introduces all of the typical problems of matchmaking, it sure as hell beats having to organize a damn guild like I did in City of Heroes, EQ2, or any number of other MMOs I've played.  NS2 was designed for an era that was already extinct. There's some manner of irony in that statement."
truegaming,3d7h9d,takua108,2,Tue Jul 14 17:20:10 2015 UTC,NS2 was designed for an era that was already extinct.   Not as clumsy or random as matchmaking; an elegant game for a more civilized age.
truegaming,3d7h9d,Frankie__Spankie,2,Tue Jul 14 19:29:57 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be so sure that ""civilized"" is the right term for it but there is some definite nostalgia for the era of joining a server you favorited and then checking out their team website/forums later because you liked them.  Nowadays? I see kids with clan tags and I just roll my eyes, expecting them to be massive wankers and annoying."
truegaming,3d7h9d,KaXaSA,2,Tue Jul 14 19:38:12 2015 UTC,"This is one of my favorite games of all time. I played it for years. Finally I did get tired of it.  The reason I got tired of it was because of two main reasons.  1 - As soon as one team thought they were losing, they would all quit, or just surrender. Usually the battle is very even going back and fourth. The thing is, as soon as your team gains an advantage, that is exactly when it becomes fun, because you get all these upgrades and get to kill lots of people or aliens and have a great time. The trouble is, as soon as your team has a lead, the other team all just quits so you don't actually get to play the fun part of the game where you are beating people and winning. This removed a lot of the fun from the game for me. I've also come back and won a game with my hive at 1% so I can tell you for a fact that most teams give up wayyyyy to easy. Yeah it doesn't look good, but trust me, all it takes is one team move to change the tide of the game. Practically no games go all the way through anymore, and everybody forfeits before the actual fun part.  As a small tangent, number 1 sort of includes teamwork and attitude. Most people have such an incredibly serious attitude when they play, you can hear the stress and anger in their voice over chat, and it really makes it not fun. I get that they're trying hard, and really want to win, and I do too, I just don't let it get me angry and frustrated. I'm really good at the game, even when I'm not angry and bickering over the mic. But listening to these people just is frustrating and makes me not want to play, hardly anybody wants to just have a good time. They are all obsessed with winning, blaming their teamates, and then giving up. It's just so frustrating to be with a team like that over and over.  2 - The map size, and the game length, and the number of maps. There are not a lot of maps for the game. I'm pretty bored of all of the standard maps. They are also all mostly pretty small, which makes for faster games. I've always wanted to see some sort of larger maps that could turn the game from 20 - 60 min rounds into rounds that could go on for hours with much more strategy involved. There are only so many tactics for small maps, and I would call most of the normal maps kind of small. Basically whichever team gets the double res, or the central room, or the tech point first wins. That strategy gets really boring because you can pretty much tell who will win within the first 5 mins or so (Unless your not with a wussy team that doesn't give up, and actually teams up to take the critical point back, which I've been in plenty of times but I would say it happens less than 50% of the time). If there were more than 6 or 7 res nodes, if the maps were larger, multi level, 15 to 20 res nodes, it would create a much more dynamic, chaotic, and I think much more fun game. The rounds are just over too fast. If the maps were much larger, it would be a lot harder to tell who had the advantage as early on, as it would take much more time to spread out and take control of different map points. When the maps just have 1 critical point to capture, and one team takes it at the start of the game, that's it. That's most of the strategy. That is incredibly boring. Maybe include multiple types of resources, larger maps, anything to add more complexity to the strategy of the maps, it's just way too simple and fast in the beginning, many games are over before they really even start and that is never fun on either team.    Side Tangents:  3 - Onos can no longer eat people and digest them whole, gain health from them as they watch your intestines, and then poop them out to kill them, as it worked in NS1. That may have been the best part of the entire game, and they took it out of 2.  Even after I grew tired of the game I still made it fun for me in new ways. I played as BattleGorge for a while as a joke, and it actually was really really fun. I would attack as a gorge with a team of skulks spamming healspray rushing at a marine or two. They get overwhelmed at the gorge/skulk ball and don't know where to shoot. Meanwhile I'm making funny gorgy sounds and healing my teamates while damaging the marines with the same attack. Normally skulks die very quickly but if you keep healing them you effectively double, triple or even quadruple their hitpoints before they die, and it makes quite a formidable force that most marines are not used to facing and so are bad at it. I also just got really good at getting kills as a gorge, it seemed like the most challenging to me so it became the most fun, because once you actually get a kill, it's so difficult that it is really satisfying. And it embarrasses the marines. And you can sqeak and make funny noises and hop around on them after you kill them, it's awesome.  Another one of my favorite things after I got bored with it was just skulking. It took me so many years to be able to be good at a skulk, including NS1 and NS2. There is nothing more fun to me than waiting up on the ceiling or above a doorway and hearing the loud clunky marines coming down the hall, with their clanking boots, flashlights, and voices. They are impossible to not know they are coming. Jump down, eat one up, run back up and hide. Then you get to see the rest of them sort of panic and eventually another inches his way in. Bam, drop on him, chomp chomp, run back up the wall. The rest of the marines flea. It's hilarious.  TLDR; Bad team attitude. People are too angry and give up too early. Matches are over too quickly. Very simplistic map strategies that leave no room for creativity or different tactics (As far as the main overall goals. For instance in maps with the double central res, whichever team takes that in the beginning usually wins.)"

I used to play Team Fortress Classic daily until last year, there's probably only a couple hundred people that still play the game. A big reason why I haven't been playing lately is due to how toxic the community is nowadays.   Most people are me first, they think they're awesome, you trying to give tips to people who aren't so awesome is a huge insult, anyone who clearly hasn't played the game before is immediately attacked, too many don't care about objective at hand. They can't seem to grasp that the community is small enough as it is, they should be doing anything they can to promote the game rather than shun away possible newcomers.   If people ask for help and show a genuine interest to educate themselves, I have no problem helping them out. I've even gone to empty servers with them to teach them stuff. Hell, I've gone to empty servers with other people after I've been playing the game for over 10 years myself to learn something new. Nobody does everything great afterall.   It's just the sad cycle of (I'm not sure if this would be the right word here) elitists. They're the last of the community and drive everyone else out.

truegaming,3d7h9d,HumorMe11,2,Tue Jul 14 19:19:56 2015 UTC,Some people may not like it but what made NS really popular was the Combat mode and the Devs decided to completely ignore this significant portion of the player-base by not implementing that as a day 1ish (aka not a standalone bs years later) game mode in NS2. I got some friend interested in NS vanilla after they got used to the gameplay in combat mode.   The poorly optimized engine also didn't help at the time.

I'm at 132, and despite doing what I was supposed to throughout the match, I got kicked. I fired up the game just once after that, saw that the 2 popular servers (all others are empty) in my region were full, and exited the game.  Natural Selection 2 is as dead as Natural Selection 1."
truegaming,3d7h9d,HumorMe11,2,Tue Jul 14 15:57:38 2015 UTC,"The game is not particularly good and has a LOT of fundamental flaws.  I had over 1k hours in the game, have played a lot of fps games competitively, and played with some of the best ns2 players, so I know quite a bit about the workings of the game as well as having perspective about the competitive fps genre as a whole.  First of all, a lot of people talk about how strategic the game is.  The game really is not very strategic in reality.  Strategy implies the ability to make informed choices that influence the outcome of the game.  In truth, there were a very small number of builds that were actually viable, and a vast majority of the skill was simply how well you could perform mechanically (particularly how well you could aim).  When archaea was dominating the early comp scene, the reason they were so successful was because their aggregate accuracy was much higher than other teams.  The biggest separation in skill amongst players is due to mechanics.    The commander is bad design.  There is basically no way to make the commander either mostly irrelevant to the game or way too important.  It is also the lowest skilled position, because the game's skill is mostly based around basic shooting mechanics.  Unfortunately, the commander's skill curve is very odd, because it's tough to learn for newbs while simultaneously being the easiest position at a high level.  Basically, it's 'difficult to learn, easy to master,' the exact opposite of what you'd want out of a core mechanic.  Like I have said, there were a very small number of viable builds, so after you memorize those, the rest of your job is basically spamming medpacks and ammo on top of your teammates.  Low skilled players simply didn't understand the basic builds and didn't have the apm to constantly keep their teammates topped off.  The commander was also pretty unpopular to play as, and low skilled commanders basically ruin the game for their team because their importance was overemphasized.    There were other weird design decisions too.  Aliens were particularly unforgiving to play as, because you would save up to play a more powerful life form only to be killed and then you'd spend another 10 minutes playing whack-a-mole on the enemy extractors as a boring skulk.  It was needlessly punishing for new players.  The identical objectives for both aliens and marines combined with the completely different playstyles (aim-based vs. movement based) created some fundamental balance problems where it was impossible to balance aliens and marines across an array of skill levels.  I'm not even going to get into the technical problems (particularly with performance), but I'm sure that was also a problem for player retention.  People rant about matchmaking, but it almost certainly wouldn't have worked for a game like ns2.  The game should have been designed around large player servers and drop-in, drop-out play (like 24 man servers) to begin with, since those are consistently the most popular game modes in most fps games and alleviate a lot of the design problems for lower skilled players.  Thinking matchmaking would work in a game with such a large separation of skill and such a small player count is naive at best.  I always find it weird how people think ns2 is some great strategy fps game just because it has dune-style rts elements.  In reality, games like tribes 2 and cs:go are actually far more strategic despite not having those explicit mechanics."
truegaming,3d7h9d,AmuseDeath,2,Tue Jul 14 14:14:50 2015 UTC,"I don't agree that the game is not strategic. I think your understanding of the game might only be from a public level.

Plenty of experienced players were encouraging noobies all the time and giving great advice, there was a real concerted effort among veterans to really help newer players. I ran commander a few times and even though I didn't do great I asked for help and I got it, and got some ""nice try""s over voicechat at the end. Noob friendly servers were actually noob friendly. I took a long break and came back and somewhere that changed, maybe the more toxic players slowly started driving people away and it was a knock on from there, I don't know. But at launch the game had real potential from the community side, it was just the technical side of the game holding back. A couple years later it's the opposite. I think about this game a lot because I think it could have been one of my all time favourites, if everything had come together a little better, with ranked matchmaking to alleviate the toxicity of higher skilled players playing with noobs, and just a more technically solid launch, which would have opened the game up to a lot more people with weaker computers who couldn't brute force through the performance issues."

Thrusting new commanders into such an important, visible position is a huge hurdle that most can't overcome. Either you try it while the game is new, or you have to play as a grunt for some time before you can give it a shot. People who are more interested in strategy than shooting just don't get a good chance to try these types of games. The lack of matchmaking doesn't help, either. New commanders are almost always up against veterans. It leads to a lot of losses before their first win, and losing more than one match on a server is a good way to have your team mutiny, kick you, or leave.  This subgenre will never get popular until these issues are resolved."

For one player to learn the game, he shouldn't then ruin the game for 15+ other players. He can easily spectate a good commander, play in a game where he is commanded or try commander in training mode. Losing because your commander takes 5 minutes to drop you a resource node is a very painful way to lose and again, it RUINS the experience for dozens of other players. So I cannot be with you on that one.  NS2 for me is a mixed bag. It's by far my favorite FPS because the action is intense and frequent. I don't have to wait 5 minutes to play another round of CS:GO and die in the first few seconds. You have resources and upgrades in NS2 as well. You have different weapons and alien playstyles in NS2.  But at the same time, they made some really, really poor decisions. First off, optimization sucks balls. You need a really good computer to run it decently. I have a pretty modern computer with plenty of RAM, a good processor and a good video card, yet I often get 30-40 FPS. You need a crazy server with an Intel processor that's overclocked. Part of it is because it's coded in 32-bit and the other part is that the developers thought it was a good idea to code in LUA, because they thought giving mod support was important, even though LUA really sucks ass when used in fast-paced online gaming. What resulted is poor frame rates for many people such as myself (30-40 FPS) and long wait times to join servers (>10 minutes!).  The game really had no hands-on help for a long time. It failed to have a tutorial mode or help videos so new players would not understand the purposes of the things in the game like parasite, bile bomb, etc. The game failed to have a matchmaking system, a way to discourage skill stacking and a concede option.  And the game is just too complex for most people out there to get. A lot of people when they play this game, they will walk around to explore the map or see what attacks they can do. Unfortunately, to play NS2 effectively, you have to be on point and on the move 99% of the time. Right when you spawn, you need to be running to wherever you need to be, whether it's defending another base, killing a resource tower, killing a weak building, etc.  It's a truly brilliant game marred by many easy-to-solve problems. If only they could release NS2.5 where they could remake the game in the Source engine and repair a lot of this stuff."

Two sides to a coin.    Some people had no intention to communicate in what was a very team heavy game.  Me and my friends binge on this game in random intervals from time to time.  We loved people that would ask questions vs some of the more mute players.  A lot of people would just run out there and treat the game as a solo arena FPS where they needed to acquire kills.  Don't know how to build?  Please ask me, don't know how to buy x, y or z?  Please ask me.  Hey guys, we really need that point in the center with the two resource nodes.  I need you to focus on... oh, you're just going to run into the hive over and over again?  Okay.  In the situations where it was cool for a first time commander though, more often than not they would not respond to feedback.  ""Okay first you need to drop an armory and then resource nodes where the marines walk by to be built, you do this by pressing this, this and then this.  Push this button to open a map""  More often than not I would get zero response both via communications and from gameplay.  They would sit there and build random things disregarding everything I said.  Not to say that your scenarios didn't happen either of course."
truegaming,3d7h9d,Acidictadpole,2,Thu Jul 16 16:48:59 2015 UTC,Don't get me wrong I asked questions and people guided me through commanding for a long time. I always said the community is awesome . Just recently the community has gotten smaller and only the toxic part remains.
truegaming,3d7h9d,JohnStrangerGalt,2,Thu Jul 16 20:32:41 2015 UTC,"Here are the popular points people bring up.     Game didn't have match making     Yes the game does not have match making and the quick match feature it has is poor. The game also came out almost 3 years ago and if you remember 3 years ago not a lot of games really had match making. When it was being developed before it released almost no games had match making. Do I think it was a mistake that they didn't adapt and add it? Yes I think so, you need to look at the gaming landcape the game was built on (a half life 1 mod) and when it was being released.     People not nice to new people/commanders     People are going to bitch at you for being new/bad on any game you are new/bad at just work to improve. In my experience with playing public Natural Selection 2 games new commanders don't listen and don't take criticism well and melt down as soon as they feel any pressure. I always try to gently get commanders to build the right thing, I tell them how and what to build. If you can't take the pressure of your team telling you how/what to build then maybe you should just lurk and play more for now.   Games stack and I just lose lose lose.     The game is hugely team orientated, even a small amount of teamwork goes a long way. On the flip side if one team has even one player who knows how the aim and no one else in the whole game knows how to play effectively then yes you will lose. It is probably you and you should just play more until you understand what you need to do.   Six months later I try the game again, there's 2 open servers that are packed full, and a few private servers (noob avoidance).   Currently I would say almost or more than half of the active community are people who play in leagues/scheduled matches pugs or scrims. Why would you want randoms joining your scrimmage or league match?    There is not enough of a community to have have semi-private server, they are all private matches in a 6v6."

Not everyone has played the FPS genre much and don't care to be ""MLG-PRO"". They just want to play a game and have fun. This type of thinking only makes it more inhospitable for new players.   The new players don't just leave crying and afraid of what is going on. New player leave because they are people and they are not having fun playing a GAME. It's simply just isn't fun to be pubstombed all day by players with 1000+ hours and then insulted for not having 1000+ hours of skill in the game. Simple as that."

In my 1500 hours I have seen that very rarely and only from a select people that are just assholes.  You are going to have a bad time with Natural Selection 2 if you want to be bad and have fun. I am not asking people to try and improve all the time and go for the next league win whatever no.  But you are going to have to have to learn at least some underlying mechanics, like proper skulk jumping etc. You are not going to be able to run and gun unless you are the top 1% then you still don't but it just looks like you do to new players.

The reason is that it is too much twitch gameplay in a team oriented shooter for my liking. The basic aliens are so agile that you can barely hit them and they do not move in a predictable pattern, just jumping around all over the place. This was nothing for me, as I do not like games with lack of inertia.   Yes, my aim is terrible when it comes to fast paced shooting, but I was not expecting that from NS2, I was expecting sneaky aliens that grew into more powerful things, not those bouncing little shits that kill you if you cannot shoot. It doesn't help that the weapon you have as a basic marine is pinpoint accurate and has no spread, so you always miss if you do not aim straight at it.  I really liked the atmosphere, the weapons, the levels...I liked everything, but the gameplay of the basic aliens was just too fast paced to make it enjoyable to me from either side. Was one Early Access style game that I do somehow regret not making my voice heard more..."

If they make a mistake, its someone elses fault.   Yet there's a lot of very popular MOBAs.  I think a huge part in gaming now a days are carrots on a stic. There are countless titles that are rated as very good games. Yet, they're dead or dieing. What I notice is that 90% of them lack any sort of progression or carrot on stick. No heroes you're going for (in the case of MOBAs). No guns you're looking to unlock. No skins you're looking to unlock.   I can't help but feel this is the new trend. So many of the most popular games in today's industry involve a lot of carrots on sticks."

Wrong. You can't blame the community when people join a game without playing the tutorials, watching a tutorial video, or bothering to learn the game at all and want to ruin 20 peoples' game at once.  This isn't a problem of community, it's a problem of not forcing newbs to learn the game before they play.   THE TUTORIALS SHOULD BE MANDATORY.  I also have to disagree that the better players win. Always, 100% of the time, the team with the best teamwork will win. I can command a team of greens to victory provided they all listen and do exactly what I say.  There is no elitism here. There's just people who don't want to sit and watch you learn commander on their time, by losing the game for them. There are tutorials for that. Learn the game, then opt for command. You can host your own server with bots to learn the commanding basics. If you're getting yelled at by toxic players (and I'm not saying they don't exist, by the way they are in EVERY game out there) you have the option of A: listening, B: ignoring them, C: muting them, or D: making a post on reddit about how mean people ruined the game. Sorry, option D is utterly wrong. Unlike battlefield and most of the shooters out at the moment, this game doesn't just promote teamwork, it is REQUIRED. You will obviously have a lot of communication, both frivolous and serious in a team game of this nature.  If you want to command, you have to have a tough skin, and the ability to disengage from an argument or toxic player that isn't benefiting anyone.  The real reason it is waning is because it is a couple years old. With the massive amount of games being released, and the fact that this game wasn't well-marketed, they only captured a small audience and retention isn't great.  People move on.   This isn't and never was an issue of bad community.  The game's graphics are very pooly optimized. It still has a few bugs, few maps, and because of the steep learning curve, I think most people are not willing to invest the time."

You personally even went as far as to say it ruins the rest of the server's enjoyment because of one single person being new.

It fundamentally exists outside of the actual game, and as a result has no consequence, bearing, or effect on the games actual content. Turn off the game doesn't prevent the white phosphorus scene, it just pauses the clock at the point before it happens.  The only choice in Spec Ops is deciding whether you should feel bad for walking down a straight corridor while some unsubtle, holier-than-thou developer tries to pin the history of militarism on you choice of hobby, or turning around and realizing you wasted X number of hours and potential $60.  Real clever design."

So, you get to this point in the story, everyone except the main character realizes this is not going to end well. You don't want to do it. Most people try everything not to do it, but the game doesn't let you do anything. You are forced to make the choice to either keep playing the game, or turn it off.  You've just invalidated the choice. By forcing a choice between playing the game and not, you've just gone meta and made me remember that all these people I'm about to kill are just code. They're not real. I no longer give a shit. It immediately loses all sense of meaning.  In my opinion, it would have been a hell of a lot better if you had a choice not to do it, only to find out that some of those people were real enemies and then they do even worse things to the civilians than the white phosphorous would have done.  If the point is to show that you have a choice between two piles of shit, show me two piles of shit, don't make me realize one them is plastic."

truegaming,3d4z7z,UmiNotsuki,3,Tue Jul 14 03:12:50 2015 UTC,"That's not a reasonable comparison. It is not that you as the player are in an unwinnable situation, and that you have no other option than to fire on what is obviously civilians. It is that the mechanics of the game prevent you from doing anything else just for the sake of the story. I wanted to have the option of sneaking past the camp, or going in guns blazing like I had done on previous occasions but it was simply not presented as an option and no reason was given for this.  It was such an arbitrary lack of choice that could have easily been done better and in a more subtle way."
truegaming,3d4z7z,GadgetGamer,16,Tue Jul 14 08:34:14 2015 UTC,"The scene would have been much more effective if, instead of a massive blob of dots, the civilians had shown up as enemy targets scurrying for cover.   I arrived at the giant blob of people and didn't shoot. I actively sought a way not to shoot. Its a plot device though, and after a minute of pushing different buttons on the controller, I had no option but to shoot. Instantly a wall was inserted between myself and the character, and, as a result, the rest of the game was overshadowed by a lot of eye-rolling.  The most effective storytelling always connects the character with the audience. If that connection is broken, it allows the audience to take a step back and say ""that's not me, I wouldn't act like that."" As a result, the character's failures are met with distance and disdain, not empathy.  I do not think the developer's goals were misplaced. What they were aiming for was a very grand idea, and it's a shame that the game failed at such a pivotal point (at least for me). I think that, given another game to further develop their design, they would not have made the same mistake. We learn how to walk only after we've tripped."

The bullets connected, a few people went down and the crowd began screaming as they dispersed.  I moved on. I told myself that I had no choice, that I'd been forced to do it. It was me or them. And then later, maybe while I was watching someone else play that section, I watched them raise their gun in to the air and fire. The crowd still screamed and ran.  That's when I realised it had been my fault. The game gave me a choice, but in my moment of fear and anger I didn't even see it, I only saw red.

truegaming,3d4z7z,fade_like_a_sigh,19,Mon Jul 13 20:39:15 2015 UTC,"When I first played that part I shot in air, hoping I didn't have to kill anyone, and I was glad that that was an option. But then I noticed something interesting about what the game does throughout. While playing through the game I realized that it was trying to divorce you from Walker's perspective that way you could actively tell what you're doing was wrong, and that by taking part in Walker's continuing rampage, by extension, you're wrong. Except here, at the hanging. Here we get to choose what Walker does in such a way that gives agency back to the player instead of Walker. Agency that makes YOU shoulder the choice and it brings it all back to the game criticizing YOU instead of Walker.  Powerful stuff. Hope more games like this come out sometime. Never had a game that made me think this much before."

truegaming,3d4z7z,LukaCola,6,Mon Jul 13 21:12:25 2015 UTC,"Yep, a subtle, yet notable moment mentioned in the Contextualizing Violence Through Narrative talk given by the lead writer for Spec Ops: The Line."
truegaming,3d4z7z,TactlessCactus,11,Mon Jul 13 18:40:32 2015 UTC,"But in this game, other happenings actively speak directly to the player and the protagonist as one, e.g. the teleporting mannequins, the heavy Lugo hallucination, the lynching mob, etc. We saw it as Walker would have saw. So I find in this particular scene, detaching the player from the protagonist's mind felt jarring, when the players were suspicious yet Walker so headstrong."
truegaming,3d4z7z,UmiNotsuki,6,Mon Jul 13 17:00:23 2015 UTC,"I'm confused by the fact that you'd interpret Walker as anything other than self-assured throughout the game, even after he's obviously insane. Take his ""last stand"" raid on the 33rd with Adams: they know it's ridiculous, they know they've brought nothing but death and horror, but by that point they've resigned to their own nature as self-righteous and confident monsters.  The dissonance between Walker's surety about his righteousness and the player's doubts (and eventually, factual knowledge to the contrary) is a key point for the game's tone. It's a trip into the depths of cognitive dissonance itself. Hell, one of the loading screens available immediately after ""The Gate"" simply provides the definition of ""cognitive dissonance"" to the player!"
truegaming,3d4z7z,boopaboopa,21,Tue Jul 14 02:57:57 2015 UTC,"Shit will happen, you know it, the game knows it, and still you do it.   Then give the player a choice to not do it. Far Cry 4 has a similar metacommentary and they give you a choice at the very beginning of the game to not do all the horrible shit you're about to do the entire time."
truegaming,3d4z7z,Madplato,21,Mon Jul 13 17:12:24 2015 UTC,"That's not exactly better, to be honest. Did you just wait for him to come back, paid your respect at the shrine then never picked the game back up ? Nobody does that and that's the whole point."

By all means you're allowed to take that alternate ending as a ""win,"" but a win a singleplayer game is just an arbitrary stopping point. What's more important is what you take away from the game.  Many times I'll get a good deal into a game but find I've experienced it for all it's really worth before completing it. You don't get the full story but mechanically you'll usually see everything on display way before the ending."

truegaming,3d4z7z,Piemonkey,15,Mon Jul 13 18:17:27 2015 UTC,"His whole point is that the game doesn't actually give you the option of not participating. In fact, the game itself makes you do it and then taunts you later for doing it. That's the disconnect in contention here.  Saying ""stop playing"" is outside the game. It's a total disengagement from the art caused by itself. If the art itself caused that disengagement (e.g. MGS2's Arsenal Gear sequence), it would have been much more thematically cohesive."
truegaming,3d4z7z,Madplato,0,Mon Jul 13 20:03:14 2015 UTC,The whole experience is optional. Insisting you need an actual in-game resolution is beside the point. Walker won't back down.

truegaming,3d4z7z,Piemonkey,12,Mon Jul 13 20:18:38 2015 UTC,"A resolution isn't what's being asked for here. It's just that if a game is harping on you for making a choice, it should have actually been a choice. The Metal Gear games always handled this very well, years before Spec Ops did."
truegaming,3d4z7z,boopaboopa,-1,Mon Jul 13 20:28:32 2015 UTC,"Actually I did do that. I haven't picked it up yet again to play it. I will one day, but I was pretty happy with that.

And I guess adding in actual choices into Spec Ops: The Line would just complicate things and destroy the rhetoric because not everyone would just go around throwing WP on innocent people."
truegaming,3d4z7z,Madplato,6,Mon Jul 13 18:10:38 2015 UTC,"Not everybody pays 70$ for 10 minutes of game-play either. They aimed for similar messages, although far cry 4 is much more subtle,  but didn't do it the same way. Yet I never felt like I needed SO:TL to have a clear ""leave"" option."
truegaming,3d4z7z,boopaboopa,7,Mon Jul 13 18:15:43 2015 UTC,"On that same token, nobody pays $60 for a game they're not even supposed to play."

You're supposed to play it, get to the end and realize the whole set of awful events where really of the character's own doing. You can't know ""not to play it"" until you play it.

truegaming,3d4z7z,boopaboopa,14,Mon Jul 13 18:20:58 2015 UTC,"I feel you missed the point. Even the developers have said ""This is where the characters have to look at the consequences of their actions and say: 'Should we have gone further? Should we have left? Should we leave now? Is it right to keep going?'"" Williams answered. ""And if the player is thinking about seriously putting down the controller at this point, then that's exactly where we want them to be emotionally..  And even the rhetoric from the people who actually thought the game was good/told a good story have the same sentiment of ""well, you could've not played"". No, the game is designed to make you feel guilty and it apparently worked on redditors. But it doesn't make me feel bad because there's no real choice. You're railroaded into doing everything in the game. My original point was, if the developers thought their rhetoric wouldn't fall apart for an instant.. they should've given us a choice to put Walker back on the helicopter and end the game.  It would've been more impactful if I made the choice to use the WP of my own player agency free will rather than putting down the controller and not playing at all."
truegaming,3d4z7z,indeedwatson,5,Mon Jul 13 18:28:14 2015 UTC,"But it doesn't make me feel bad because there's no real choice.    You just said there is a choice. If the game presents you with an ingame choice, then you can feel not responsible for making it. Whereas if you keep going cause you say ""there's no real choice"", you're making excuses for yourself into not feeling guilty about these acts because you ""had no choice"", which is exactly what a soldier stranded in the middle of the desert, with two people under his command and his life on the line, with unkown and unclear threats and confusing orders, might tell himself.  If you could send Walker into a helicopter and end the game 1 hour in, it would not have been more impactful, you only say that now having played it or knowing what was ahead. Without looking back at your and Walker's actions, without the escalation and his descent to madness, there's no way that getting into a helicopter and ending the game would have had much emotional impact on the player. You'd just feel even more cheated, because the game provides and approves of an easy way out of a story that is supposed to examine war, following orders, us vs them mentality, and out fascination and over reliance on war and guns as a common theme of video games."
truegaming,3d4z7z,putrid_moron,9,Mon Jul 13 20:10:44 2015 UTC,"Ah, so you HAVE to play the game so it can then later berate you for doing so.  Sounds well designed.  People who justify this mix the meta with the main character.  Should I feel bad even though it's Walker's actions?  Or are they mine? Pick something or accept multiple interpretations."
truegaming,3d4z7z,dyslexda,8,Mon Jul 13 23:49:45 2015 UTC,"Whereas if you keep going cause you say ""there's no real choice"", you're making excuses for yourself into not feeling guilty about these acts because you ""had no choice"",   If the developers included a ""Give me a refund button"" somewhere in the game, this would be legitimate. Otherwise, they're preying on you and grabbing your money with bullshit moral ""quandaries."" ""Putting the controller down"" is never a legitimate ending to a game I fucking paid money for; if it is, tell me up front, so I can decide not to pay money for it."
truegaming,3d4z7z,boopaboopa,3,Mon Jul 13 21:04:25 2015 UTC,"You just said there is a choice.   I most certainly did not. Where did I say there's an in game choice?  You seemed to have missed the point I'm making.  edit: ""Don't play the game you paid for"" is not a choice."
truegaming,3d4z7z,Madplato,2,Mon Jul 13 21:57:53 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, you can't know any of that without playing it. The whole thing only feels ""awful"" if you actually play it out. Their whole narrative really only works out if people play the game."

truegaming,3d4z7z,boopaboopa,3,Tue Jul 14 00:57:33 2015 UTC,"Right, and the whole ""you don't have to play"" is complete bullshit. No, it should be an option in game. It's not right of the developer to make us pay for a game we shouldn't be playing."
truegaming,3d4z7z,GoodLuckCowboy,11,Mon Jul 13 20:54:26 2015 UTC,"The developer doesn't make any judgement based on whether or not you should be playing, it simply provides you with the game you purchased: A game about killing people. The developers don't say you should stop, or that you should continue. They simply show you what kind of game you decided to play. If you did not want to kill people, don't play a modern military shooter."
truegaming,3d4z7z,lgroeni,6,Mon Jul 13 21:18:10 2015 UTC,"It's not right of the developer to make us pay for a game we shouldn't be playing.   The developer didn't make you pay for the game, nor does it say you should or should not be playing it.  You did that. You decided to pick up the game, you chose to start playing it.  That's the entire point of the game - it isn't there to talk you out of it or reward you for ""doing the right thing"". It's there to point out that the entire premise - choosing to pick up and play a game clearly marketed around being the hero in a violent fantasy - is fucked from the beginning.  Getting an option to ""do the right thing"" in game entirely defeats the purpose."

truegaming,3d4z7z,boopaboopa,10,Mon Jul 13 21:46:12 2015 UTC,"No, not at all. But the choice being presented in game would make it more impactful.

They railroaded me into that and didn't give me a choice and expect me to feel bad"" I got instead.   What you're suggesting is buying the game and playing it for ten minutes.   No. And I've said in several of my posts that including the option would make it more impactful because that meant you ignored the option and decided to ""be the hero"" instead."
truegaming,3d4z7z,guy15s,-1,Mon Jul 13 21:24:56 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The last thing Spec Ops: The Line is trying to do is get you to pat yourself on the back and call yourself a hero. It's criticizing other war games where you have no choice but to commit reprehensible acts of violence in order to complete the mission. If you make that an actual choice for or against, the commentary is lost because this is only the most major example from a game that is entirely about ""killing them ragheads"" for no other reason than your entertainment."
truegaming,3d4z7z,boopaboopa,3,Mon Jul 13 21:27:17 2015 UTC,"You realize I put ""be a hero"" in quotes right? The game criticizes player agency (edit: well, maybe more our own choice to actually play a violent game rather than player agency) as well as war games and is just as bad about railroading as the very games it criticizes.  The commentary is lost if you decide to stop the shit and go home because the developers are kinda petty and want you to feel bad and not have any choice in the matter. I disagree though. The commentary would be there and would be more poignant if given a choice but still choosing not to take it.   this is only the most major example from a game that is entirely about ""killing them ragheads"" for no other reason than your entertainment.    Nice generalization of an entire genre when that's not even what most of the games are like/about."
truegaming,3d4z7z,guy15s,0,Tue Jul 14 00:12:33 2015 UTC,"is just as bad about railroading as the very games it criticizes.   It's supposed to be just as bad. That's the whole point; that you are disappointed when that lack of agency is brought to your attention. The commentary would be lost if they didn't do this. Instead, you would praise them for allowing you to finally choose otherwise, and then you would have moved on, thought of it as a ""good game,"" and then went on to play games that continue to take away your agency because it was never forced home that that was what they were doing.   Nice generalization of an entire genre when that's not even what most of the games are like/about.   Alright, fine. ""Killing them ragheads/Nazis/gooks/faceless soldiers."" It's all the same, regardless.  Edit: also, just to indicate how the point would be lost, if they did give you the choice then, you'd still not be any sort of hero. So what if you didn't kill some civilians? You'd still have committed a number of other atrocities, but you, yourself, said that this choice would have allowed you to end the game with the ""be the hero"" option instead of having all the incongruencies along the way. It's just the same as waving a flag at the end of the game and reminding the player ""the sacrifices our soldiers make to defend our country"" and so on. It wouldn't help you feel the impact, o It would let you put a nice end to a horrible story because the last memory you have of the game is you finally making the ""right"" choice. The fact that people are still talking about how this lack of agency pissed them off just shows you how much better this method was at conveying this commentary. When was the last time you talked with others about how Mass Effect made you contemplate personal sacrifice for the greater good because you decided to do so?"
truegaming,3d4z7z,ImperatorTempus42,0,Tue Jul 14 01:24:45 2015 UTC,"First of all, that's the entire point of war games. Violence is in the definition.

They say it's about choice and player agency, and then say your choice was not to the play the game.  That's why I don't watch movies where bad things happen—after you press play, you're responsible for all the actions that play-out regardless of whether you wanted them to or not.

You know how it's going to turn out, and you put it on anyway, but it doesn't mean you should feel responsible for what happens to the characters.   Wildly different mediums and objectives, your point is absolutely absurd if you stop for three seconds to think about the themes of the game. Spec Ops is a direct critique of linear war games, Call of Duty if you want a clear example.   You don't watch Requiem for a Dream because it's a critique of how watching druggies is fun, you play Call of Duty for fun. Requiem for a Dream isn't making you think about you making a person get drugged, The Line is at least trying to make you think about you making a character kill in a medium that has desenticized interactive violence for fun. For criticizing it for ludo-narrative dissonance you sure are forgetting about the entire ""ludo"" dimension of the theme. It's not about choice or agency at all, it never was. It's not criticizing RPGs or multinarrative design (or expectations) like Stanley Parable. Choice and agency has NEVER been a main point in said war games, even today where player agency is a big thing it's an incredibly minimal, irrelevant part of its creation. The game started working on its theme the moment you decided to pick up a war game for fun, which is why the marketing was made as a generic war game (sadly, the very nature of it will end up getting people to talk about it in a special manner that gives away what would be a twist, a theme twist if you will, ruining the first impression for the people who have yet to experience it but read too much).  I have a problem with the scene in that the way it was handled broke immersion (Instead of constant waves I would have made it so that you had too little ammo and made it literally impossible to break through in a believable way), but the scene is absolutely, without a second thought, necessary."

I knew it was a forced choice. I tried to find a way out of it. Couldn't. Reloaded the game prior to getting in the mortar view, and tried to jump down to take them out with guns. Oh, you can't? Alright, let's see how well I can do sniping from the platform. Oh, I can take out 20 guys on a roof and have them, quite obviously, keep reappearing on an infinite respawn? Great.

Plenty of people are fine killing off virtual civilians, as any GTA or Saints Row player will attest.

It's trying to actually get yourself to ask that question, instead of constantly choosing to dance that line so you can be happy with your avatar by the end of the game.   And the answer to that question is a resounding ""Fuck off."" Yeah, I kill civilians in games. So what? It's a fucking game. There is absolutely zero moral quandary here.

There's your answer. I still don't see why you need to start talking about getting your money back and acting like they've committed some great sin in gaming. They were trying to convey a point and it is inevitable that you have to eliminate player choice in order to do that. It's a common problem in game design that inserting choices at every juncture limits the artistic flexibility of designers. Furthermore, plenty of games don't really give a choice to do what you want.

Oh, and simply having people interested in a question doesn't stop it being sophomoric in nature.   No, the fact that plenty of people very invested in the art of video games found it moving is what makes it not sophomoric. If that were so, you wouldn't feel so frustrated by all the people who disagree with you. It just doesn't hit you and that's perfectly fine. But I don't see your rage about wanting your money back as anything but entitlement. If we start doing that, then artists have to start being afraid to put anything forward out of the fear that some of their observers might not feel particularly moved by their attempt. No need for the self-righteous diatribe about how this is an insult or that they are on an ego trip. You didn't like it. Cool."
truegaming,3d4z7z,dyslexda,2,Tue Jul 14 01:40:50 2015 UTC,"They aren't being full of themselves, and it really is irritating that you think developers can't try and make commentary like this without you thinking it's an ego trip.   There's a difference between ""commentary"" and ""beat a player over the head because we think we're superior and we have to lead them to enlightenment."" Bioshock, Metro, and Fallout did the former, while Spec Ops did the latter.   If that were so, you wouldn't feel so frustrated by all the people who disagree with you.   Wait...are you saying that, because I think it's insulting when people scoff at me for not liking the message of the game, suddenly it's impossible to be sophomoric? And yes, that's precisely what happened when it came out. I was unhappy with it, posted into the circlejerk regarding it, and was downvoted to oblivion because I'm obviously a simpleton that can't understand true art or something. There are two types of people that play SpecOps, the painfully pretentious ones that see themselves as above the Neanderthals that didn't enjoy it, and those people that think it's a childish commentary. Not much space in between.   If we start doing that, then artists have to start being afraid to put anything forward out of the fear that some of their observers might not feel particularly moved by their attempt.   I'm perfectly fine with demanding refunds from people that misrepresent their work. If I went into it knowing it was a social commentary, then that's my fault for wasting my time. But presenting it as a shooter with a compelling story, then berating the player all the way through (and I dare you to deny that's exactly what the end scene is)? Yeah, that's false advertising, art or not."
truegaming,3d4z7z,InfinitePower,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:51:27 2015 UTC,"Okay, it seems like you're looking at FPS from the perspective that many others seem to, which is that they're nothing more than elaborate and open-ended puzzles. In that case, to paraphrase an interesting writeup on The Line which I can't quite find at the moment, why do we want our puzzles to bleed, scream, cry out for help? Why do you, specifically?   Is that not an important question to ask?"
truegaming,3d4z7z,dyslexda,2,Tue Jul 14 04:36:11 2015 UTC,"Is that not an important question to ask?   No.  Just because a game requires some level of problem solving does not make it a ""puzzle"" (otherwise essentially every game is a ""puzzle,"" and the word loses all meaning). But even if we do pretend all I want from a shooter is a weak puzzle? Well, my ""puzzle"" isn't bleeding, screaming, or crying for help any more than yours is when you nuke Ghandi in Civ5, or when you harvested Little Sisters in Bioshock, or when you became a dictator in Tropico 5. Playing through a game of Total War, only to have the AI suddenly yell at you for the men you killed would be regarded as stupid. If XCOM Enemy Within chided you for killing fellow humans people would despise it. The list goes on. These are games, stop trying to make them some deep, moral question."

truegaming,3d4z7z,UmiNotsuki,4,Mon Jul 13 23:52:48 2015 UTC,"You're really missing the point. The game isn't trying to get you to feel bad about ending fictional lives; it's trying to put you in front of a mirror, and ask you about how you consume violent media and video games in general. One of its key tools is mimicry of setpieces and devices used in other shooters, followed by what those games don't provide: a glimpse at the consequences."

truegaming,3d4z7z,VeXCe,33,Tue Jul 14 00:23:03 2015 UTC,"What someone else said in a similar thread was something different: Spec Ops is not about choice, it's a satire of the endless stream of over-the-top-violence railroad shooters that came out before it (and after it). In that aspect it succeeded, but as a player-experience it's just as bad as you describe it to be."
truegaming,3d4z7z,Doodenheimer,28,Tue Jul 14 00:56:01 2015 UTC,"That's always what I thought was the point with Spec Ops. Not that it was this masterfully crafted experience that shows you the horrors of war, but rather it's a satire of games like Call of Duty that glorify war to the point that 'killing literally hundreds of people' not only comes off as normal, they make you feel good about it.  In that sense, Spec Ops does the opposite. It makes you feel guilty about it. 'Cause to be honest, when you murder hundreds of people, feeling good about it is kind of..."
truegaming,3d4z7z,boopaboopa,6,Tue Jul 14 03:04:31 2015 UTC,"Spec Ops doesn't satirize CoD. Actually, CoD has a pretty subtle anti-war/authoritative control rhetoric in it. Ever since 4."

Any attempt to be serious with war or any attempt to show the horror of war is either used incredibly poorly or used as a cheap trick to villainize whatever convenient ethnicity is invading the US/homefront. The only time a post-4 CoD ever gets close to something anti-war is no russian, and that mission is so narratively broken in every single way that I couldn't possibly fit it's problems in a single comment.  If anything CoD glorifies the necessity of war. Why else would it paint the villains as war-mongering devils and the players side as reluctant, sacrificing heroes straight out of a US army recruitment commercial. Personally, I think that has something to do with it's existence being primarily based around scare-mongering news articles practically writing CoD 15's story by unjustifiably painting a certain country as the next ""red menace."""

So there might be some mistakes, but here's what I remembered:  IIRC, you're playing as an American agent who infiltrated in Makarov's (badguy) organization in the mission. You followed Makarov's orders to mow down civilians and security/police in a Russian airport. At the end of the mission, your player character was killed by Makarov and left there for the Russian authorities to find the body. Turns out that the mission was Makarov's plan to incite war between America and Russia all along, and you were a pawn in his plan. Russians found your body, an American soldier, and blamed America for the incident. A war erupted.  Thing is, Makarov and 2 of his henchmen were leading you with no masks on all the time. It would be trivial for the Russians in the game to just look at the airport's security camera to identify the mastermind of the plan, but they just didn't.

The problem is that the whole illusion of choice thing is what people go on and on about and why it was considered such a darling. That's why you see people (like myself) vehemently disagree with that idea. There is no choice, not one that the game can acknowledge at least, and yet your supposed to feel bad for ""making"" that choice?  It makes more sense to talk about it as satire, but again, I don't think it's particularly good satire. All it ends up saying is ""it's kind of fucked up that you'll slog through a sub-par shooter where you are clearly not a hero just because you like shooters"". The character can, but does not."
truegaming,3d4z7z,Arrow156,10,Tue Jul 14 00:59:14 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing, how many people knew what WP was and what exactly it did before playing the game?  Even if you seen it being used recently, it just looks like they are spraying smoke, not raining death. Without the set up, players would not expect nor understand the destruction they cause.   In addition to this, and possibly more important, without the foreshadowing we would be completely blindsided by 'that' scene. Big events need foreshadowing, else when they happen it's so sudden and jarring that it breaks immersion. The audience stops paying attention to the story to wonder, ""Wait, what did I miss?"" Foreshadowing is a primer, it creates an additional layer of suspended disbelief for when things get complex. Without the foreshadowing the player can more easily reject the scene. We need that twinge of guilt before firing the first mortar, it needs time to grow and fester so that when the curtain is pulled it has already taken root deep inside the player so it can't be simply dismissed thematically."

I more or less agree with you about that scene - it was heavy handed, and the fact that it wouldn't let me move past that segment without is lazy storytelling. Kind of like sections where you have to die to progress - it breaks the illusion, and does exactly what you describe: you suddenly have no empathy.   btw, Walker saying ""no choice"" felt forced, IIRC he wasn't demented to this degree of unreasonable at this point of game.   That said, I would like to point out that I have heard soldiers say the ""I had no choice"" line after killing innocent civilians. Perfectly reasonable people, not crazy, not demented, just people justifying their actions as right in an otherwise morally ambiguous situation. And yes, it was as forced then as it was in the game - they were literally forcing themselves to defend doing something they knew was wrong.  Of course, I've also known people who just shrugged and said it felt good, so there is always that.  Otherwise, whatever. Aside from the lazy execution of that scene I really had no problem with it. War is full of fucked up shit you have no control over. I find myself having a hard time feeling bad for someone who is cranky that the game didn't give them control in a situation they chose to create for themselves."

Lugo: We don't have to do this Walker, we have a choice. Walker: No Lugo. We don't.  As a game that frequently talks to the player in the guise of the characters talking to each other, I don't think this was unintentional. You don't get a choice to not blow people up with White Phosphorus. You never do in these sort of games."

No, dipshits, I paid money for this, I want to play out the content to see what the big deal is. Think it's a commentary on how desensitized we are to war in general? Er...try again."
truegaming,3d4z7z,StillMostlyClueless,14,Mon Jul 13 22:01:27 2015 UTC,"It's a game with no good ending. Like many horror games, you ain't coming out of it a winner.  Some people insist they want to be a winner anyway, in which case they can stop playing.   That doesn't mean they wanted you to ""Win"" the game this way. They wanted you to play a game you can only lose. It's a story about a soldier who did a terrible thing because he felt he had to and is now driving himself insane trying to justify the terrible things he did. While also being a commentary on games that have you doing things unquestioningly out of a sense of ""Heroism"" that always turn out to work in the end. Walker thinks if he keeps pushing it'll all work out eventually. It doesn't, it's a rescue op in which you end up killing literally everyone and the happiest ending you can get is one where Walker finally takes responsibility for what he did and kills himself.  The games about a lot of things and one of them I like is you don't always get a happy ending. The whole thing is out of control, you can't wrest it back. Walker is going to burn Dubai down on his crazy quest to find someone else responsible for an atrocity he himself committed. The game pokes at your complicity in this not to encourage you to stop playing, but to help you get in his increasingly messed up head and also get you thinking along the same self justifying lines.  ""The game made me do it."" is pretty much Walkers ""Konrad made us do it"". I mean you bought the game to play a military shooter. It isn't going to pull the punch and pretend you don't really want to kill people in it and the game just happens to have a lot of killing in it. If you didn't want to kill people you wouldn't have bought it, all the game does is questioningly go ""And you're okay with this? Why?""  It's not telling you to stop, it's telling you to think."

No, I got the game to see what all the fuss is about (in full disclosure, I got it as a preorder bonus for Bioshock Infinite, so thankfully I didn't spend any actual money on it). That said, mechanically I thought it was a decent shooter.   All the game does is questioningly go ""And you're okay with this? Why?""   I'm okay with this because it's a game.

It's not telling you to stop, it's telling you to think.   Far be it from me to appear as a simpleton, but it's not the game's place to do that. It tried to act superior, and failed, revealing itself instead as just smug. I'm just a little offended when I buy a game for entertainment, and it instead attempts to lecture me.

It's funny people always apply a meta-commentary to Spec Ops, interpret it in their own way, and then say it's dumb. You don't think people have interpreted it in more complex and interesting ways that fit better with what the game actually is? It always make me laugh when people pretend that Spec Ops is some kind of millions-of-dollars prank out to make gamers feel bad for killing fictional civilians in a game.

Because if you give a game a 'good' and a 'bad' option, inevitably the 'good' option becomes the canonical path, and the 'bad' option becomes a 'what if?'  I saw this while reading a Let's Play of Spec Ops: The Line on RPG.net. After a while, the author started insisting that his Walker had died long ago, and the path he was playing through was just a hypothetical, as he watched the game unfold. He was blameless, he hadn't committed any atrocities. He was, essentially, just following orders, just pushing the buttons the game told him to.  Which is exactly the message of The Line. That gamers have become accustomed to just following orders, following the guy with ""Follow"" written above his head. We're happy to accept the pride when the game gives us good things to do, but when the ride takes us to a horrible place we throw up our hands and say ""Nope, that wasn't me.""  So it's important that there is no good, moral way to play The Line.  You can't come out of this saying that my Walker was a hero, even if other peoples' Walkers were psychopaths. No, if you play through it, you've gotta accept where that road leads you."
truegaming,3d4z7z,WoodenGearSolid,6,Tue Jul 14 04:24:41 2015 UTC,I really didnt find the game very impactful at all. Now whether that was because its hyped as a must play so maybe in my mind i was expecting more. I did think the WP mortar could have been a lot better. Maybe you meet some npc earlier and you are helping them flee an area and then you mortar them and their family. As it played out it just felt like any other 100s of npc killed that mean nothing to the player and its not like you can choose to not do it which i think is what bothered me most about it.

The game should give a choice by presenting a secondary mission which is frustratingly difficult and allows the player to resort to the white phosphorus at any point. That way, the player would have investment in their decision to use the tool, and have a sense of ownership and responsibility for the action. This would enhance the meta-commentary because it creates a concerete sense of choice and responsibility."

If you were presented with an unwinnable scenario, then the use of the WP would be justified in the context of the gameplay. The way the game is now, Walker makes a choice along with Lugo (""We have no choice"") and the player is merely acting out what the main character has already chosen needs to be done. The main character is seperate from the player, and the player's wishes.  The developers very deliberately chose to not give you a choice, because the game was about violence, not choices.

Games are an interactive medium, and in this case circumventing that interactivity takes weight away from the game - especially since your trio of main characters are bland and massively underdeveloped so there's no inclination to feel like you should be letting them call the shots as roleplay. It may have been the developers intent, but I don't think that what the developers chose there worked in the context of telling a story through video games. I'm not obligated to agree with them just because they can offer a justification. And the fact that using the mortar would have been justified by gameplay wouldn't reduce the impact of seeing all the civilians you'd just slaughtered. Quite the opposite, it would have a lot more impact because you had killed those people, not your silly poorly written main character. I get that Spec Ops is intended as a critique of violence in video games and the modern military shooter, but for me that scene was less successful than it should have been in forwarding the writer's narrative goals because of the way it was presented. Full stop. I'm more than willing to accept that this wasn't your experience with spec ops, but it was mine. I mean hell, I'm not even necessarily asking for a real alternative route, just something to make the situation feel truly pressing and dire."

It's about Walker.   I get what you're saying, but what you are suggesting does not correspond with what the developers intended with the experience. Walker doesn't work as a blank slate; he is a character that makes his own choices, choices that the player simply takes part in acting out - and that's important. There are several moments in the game where Walker explicitly doesn't make a choice untill the player acts, and in all 3 situations, you can avoid killing civilians.   I understand that some people just hated the fact that they couldn't avoid killing those civilians, but I feel like that is missing the point. You as the player are not responsible for their deaths - you didn't make the decision to kill them, Lugo and Walker did. Yes, in The Line, you are controlling a very nasty, absolutely horrible piece of shit, and the story derides your character for doing awful things. But it is important to distinguish between character and character vessel, and Walker is absolutely not a character vessel. Not every game is Half-Life, after all."
truegaming,3d4z7z,clintbellanger,17,Tue Jul 14 01:37:46 2015 UTC,"Hindsight is 20:20. Spec Ops: The Line was one of the first big-budget games to tackle ludonarrative dissonance. It was probably slightly overdone, like any new game dev technique. Similar to the way e.g. bloom lighting and slick shiny walls are everywhere in early PS3/360 games.  I like something /u/Snideforlong mentioned -- you did press the button anyway. You're a jaded gamer that felt the following scene was cheesy and forced, even though the general public would find it horrifying. And you continued anyway.  It raises questions about violence in games, but doesn't necessarily answer the questions. And that's ok. At the time it was important to start asking those questions. See also the self-aware violence in Hotline Miami, released just a few months later in 2012. It might feel like a played-out topic three years later, but they were breaking new ground in game design back then.  A year later we saw a similar concept done perfectly in The Last of Us. After that was dissected, the topic of ludonarrative dissonance started becoming boring (assumed solved?) among game designers."

truegaming,3d4z7z,I_HEART_GOPHER_ANUS,14,Tue Jul 14 22:24:06 2015 UTC,"A year later we saw a similar concept (the hero is not good) done perfectly in The Last of Us. After that was dissected, the topic of ludonarrative dissonance started becoming boring (assumed solved?) among game designers.   I'm sorry, but if your idea of an imperfect/flawed hero in a video game was perfected in the Last of Us than I have to say you have seriously low expectations for the future of video game storytelling. I'm not saying The Last of Us is bad in any regard, it's very capable and sound when it gets down to it, but that's just it, it brings nothing new to the table, even in video game narratives. It borrows many successful tropes from TV shows and movies popular in the past 10-15 years and starts weaving a story with them.   It's essentially what Naughty Dog does, ""story driven"", ""cinematic"", ""narrative"" type games. In a time of triple A games regularly being on the level of comic book writing or of that of a b-movie script, they provide a more seriously ""Hollywood"" like experience, and their influences more than show.  Possible spoilers  Joel is a flawed hero, and he's a lot better than most, true, but this is one of the most common tropes there is and is far from the first game to exercise a flawed protagonist, and is also far from the first to depict someone murdering dozens of people over the course of hours and then in one cutscene suddenly go off on your partner because she implied you might not be good people. How is that supposed to be taken seriously? It's the classic ""I murder dozens, maybe hundreds of people a day, but I'm still allowed have moral quandaries about it without being considered fucking insane because I'm the hero"" thing that never fails to be present in popular media with a distinct lack of self awareness.   Edit: And one thing I fucking hate is Naughty Dog's writing style. still spoilers in the Last of Us they trade out a lot of extended cutscene exposition in favor of having characters have casual banter back and forth as they walk throughout the world. On one hand it's fantastic for making small connections with the characters helping to show them coming to terms with their forced partnership through occasional banter and the odd optionally found tidbit that causes conversation.  On the other hand, it's casual banter mode and Naughty Dog tries to fit a lot of the story into it now, including relationships between characters. This results in small talk sometimes as short as one or two lines, to the point where there are entire conversations where they imply a lot, but never have an in-depth discussion or show any of it happening.   One notable example is Joel and Tess's relationship: When you first start out after the ""20 YEARS LATER"" cutscene, Tess is mid to late 20s at the MOST. Joel's daughter was at least 11 or 12 before the 20 years passed cutscene, and I have no doubts in my mind Tess is absolutely under the age Sarah would have been at that point. And there's no indication there's possible romantic connection, in fact it gave me the impression this had been another daughter figure he ended up ""adopting"" and would lose at one point in the story again. But then over their casual conversations they have a couple of flirtatious lines (and when I say a couple, I mean a COUPLE: As in 2. I was confused and tried paying attention my second time) and it becomes confusing because these characters act as if they're family. Tess is overall an incredibly terribly explained and just awful character, totally out of place in that game."
truegaming,3d4z7z,Gobblignash,12,Wed Jul 15 07:12:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it kinda boggles my mind when people say stuff like ""Joel was not a good guy"", I mean he barely squeezes into anti-hero by the little twist the game throws in at the end. Throughout basically the entire game the people you're killing are bandits and zombies, both completly irredeemable, and the world is a better place in every way when they're dead. Joel is always capable and competent, and even though people sometimes disagree with him, he's never totally wrong.  Compare that with Walker, who actually isn't a normal videogame protagonist, his decisions to rectify a complex situation completly worsens it. He constantly fucks up (in everything but when the player controls him) and makes things worse with him aplying videogame-protagonist-logic to an actual realistic situation, that is ""find a bad guy and shoot all the mooks standing between me and the goal"", in Spec Ops, like in real life, it doesn't work. In the Last of Us, it does.  It's also funny that people complain how the protagonist does things they don't want to in Spec Ops, but in Silent Hill 2, one of the most praised narratives of all time, the plot bases itself on a downright insane decision by the protagonist."
truegaming,3d4z7z,I_HEART_GOPHER_ANUS,2,Mon Jul 13 18:30:22 2015 UTC,Throughout basically the entire game the people you're killing are bandits and zombies   I think we're forgetting a few dozen of the MP made up of volunteers and mandatory serving civilians that run the city Joel and Tess are living in the beginning of the game.
truegaming,3d4z7z,Gobblignash,6,Mon Jul 13 19:30:42 2015 UTC,"Oh those guys? The game doesn't seem especially bothered about those, and neither seems anyone else to my mind. There's no effort made to humanize them in any way, they don't really seem to have any real personality of their own, and not even Ellie, a teenage girl, seems to be shaken about them being killed.  You might say ""well, that's the point, life doesn't have an inherit value anymore"", but that's the point, innit? Joel isn't at all portrayed as the murdering fucking hercules he actually is, since the game reinforces the point that protecting Ellie is for the good of humanity, which kinda steps above the needs of random mooks no one gives a toss about. I don't know anyone who gave a shit that MP weren't inherently evil, like the bandits and zombies. The context in which something appears is what matters, and those dudes were mooks standing in the way of * theg good of humanity*."
truegaming,3d4z7z,I_HEART_GOPHER_ANUS,6,Mon Jul 13 19:18:13 2015 UTC,"You might say ""well, that's the point, life doesn't have an inherit value anymore"", but that's the point, innit?   Well, the game tries to establish this for some reason. And Naughty Dog always fucking does this: They have some one off sentence or scene that's supposed to establish world building, but ultimately does nothing but to serve as fluff when it's revealed nobody ever gave it a second thought after having actually put it in.  The game makes a point to show they are made up of volunteers and mandatory service by the civilians. Not soon after you're taking them on in roves. I highly doubt that went across anybody's minds when they where willingly choking everyone to death that came within 5 feet of them, I tried to leave as many of them alive as possible while sneaking by. But eh."
truegaming,3d4z7z,Gobblignash,5,Mon Jul 13 19:35:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I'm saying. The game involves themes that typically are uncomfortable for most people (like killing people who aren't inherently evil) but doesn't commit enough, so it becomes the same bogstandard type of violence as every game out there.  Last of Us seems to me like Naughty Dog watched an adult movie (a movie for adults, that is, not porn), probably Children of Men, and went ""hey, we can make that"", forgetting that in need to stand out, you need to inject some form of your own style to it. The game is basically telling without showing, it's going ""hey this is a very dark and mature world, everyone is miserable and serious and tiny children talk like like adults because things are just dat grim, yo"", ""alright Naughty Dog, is the game actually going to take this into account, or is it going to be another bloody corridor shooter with dehumanised antagonists?""."
truegaming,3d4z7z,I_HEART_GOPHER_ANUS,4,Mon Jul 13 19:41:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly, FC4 did the same exact thing, trying to have more serious adult themes and ideas and completely forgetting it ever brought it up in the next mission. It seems to be a serious trend that's following just behind the serious protagonist villification that serialized TV shows have been on their grind about. But even in then it's truly an art to establish a believable, relatable, awful person that you also want to root for. Everybody wants to be Breaking Bad but nobody wants to spend the money on a real writing team with experience in anything other than video game storyboarding."
truegaming,3d4z7z,Gobblignash,2,Mon Jul 13 19:49:23 2015 UTC,"The protagonist doesn't even have to be awful, they just shouldn't be superman. It's odd, because in many American (and Americanized) narratives, relatable seems to be codeword for power fantasy. If you're trying to write a story for adults, as a general baseline you should never make people want to be the main character, which I think is especially hard for videogame writers, since it's a complete 180 from when you're making a narrative for teenagers, which have been the main market historically. Characters should be interesting and engaging mainly because of their flaws, and them either overcoming them for a happy ending, or succumbing to them for a dark ending, they shouldn't bloody inspire you to do better, anyone can make a superbadass. ""Ok, my character has a dark past, so he's brooding all the bloody time, but he still always fights for the side of good, against the bad guys. Despite him being an angsty fucking aspergers victim incapable of emoting, all hot women still wanna jump his bone. Whatever the odds, he will always overcome them, and he's also superbest at everything and is better than everyone"". Oops, looks like I just created Batman again, shit!"
truegaming,3d4z7z,I_HEART_GOPHER_ANUS,3,Mon Jul 13 19:57:15 2015 UTC,"I'd say the average video game protagonist is more akin to the James Bond cookie cutter character. Always able to land on their feet, capable to the point of putting entire country's military forces to shame, being the sole chance of success anyone has no matter the mission, I get the impression people want to be Bonds, while I don't get the impression people want to be Batman. Bonds is like the inherently perfect man, while Batman is the one crafted by traumatic determination to be perfect. Only recently have triple A games seen the appeal in the ""batman"" cookie cutter rather than 100% all ""bonds"" all the time."

I haven't played through TLOU in a long time (although I'm going to play through the remaster this weekend), but from memory there are a lot of little clues throughout the game that Joel is kind of a shitty dude.  The one I remember is during the 'ambush' when Joel and Ellie get to Pittsburgh. There's a line where Joel says he's been on ""both sides"" (numerous times) of such an ambush – basically ambushing travellers and killing them for supplies.  It's not explicit, but it does make you think about what exactly he was doing in the 20 years since the game's intro. Definitely implies that, at least at some point, Joel was a bandit no better than the ones you kill in the game."

The guys Joel fights against are all either complete monsters or just dehumanised mooks without any characterization. It doesn't really make you think at all, you go ""oh all right"" and forget it after the last bandit encounter because it doesn't ever come up again."

That's not what I'm talking about.  Designers are trying to answer the riddle: how can you have a good likable hero, but still allow them to murder hundreds of people throughout the game?  An example of dissonance from Naughty Dog is Nathan Drake. He's happy go lucky and making quips while murdering waves of henchmen. It's like the cutscene Drake and the gameplay Drake are unrelated. That's the kind of thing they aimed to fix with Joel.  Instead of making the game less violent, we make the protagonist more violent. And put them in situations where they're making small sane decisions along the way, but end up monsters in the end. And intentionally poking the 4th wall as asking whether the player is complicit in this violence.  That you think Joel wasn't a monster shows that The Last Of Us executed this perfectly. It wasn't in-your-face like OP rightly says Spec Ops was."
truegaming,3d4z7z,I_HEART_GOPHER_ANUS,2,Mon Jul 13 20:40:25 2015 UTC,"Oh, no, Joel was absolutely a monster. It was ridiculous that he tried to pull the ""I'm a good person! don't tell me I'm not!"" schtick. He lived his life before the story mode as a neutral party, doing what needed to get by including terrible things, on the regular. It ramps up when he starts doing more terrible things in the campaign.  I like Joel as a character but they should have kept him as amoral as possible rather than pretending to have some kind of quandary about how many people he's killed today."

truegaming,3d4z7z,SHOW_ME_YOUR_GOATS,9,Tue Jul 14 16:51:50 2015 UTC,Spec Ops handling of choice and the illusion of it is what really makes it shine to me. Also there is a fuck ton of subtle thing that really make the game stand out. Also what makes it stand out is that the game does not punish you or berate you for making the wrong choice when a choice is presented. When you punish a player for a choice they have made you vindicate them of the crime they did.   Unfortunately the one scene that the game is not subtle and DOES berate the player is the one that gets talked about the most. I understand why they were so heavy handed with that scene but I can't help but feel if they removed the scene and did a tone shift more subtly it would have worked out better.
truegaming,3d4z7z,dyslexda,2,Tue Jul 14 17:32:18 2015 UTC,"Spec Ops handling of choice and the illusion of it is what really makes it shine to me.   Illusion of choice is great. Obvious refusal of choice, followed by acting smug about it, is the sign of a bad game."

I know this is a common complaint about the game and that scene in particular but I never quite understand what people are referring to. Is it the 'reveal' after the mortar? I honestly never felt that the game was forcing anything to the point that it broke my immersion even though I agree some parts could maybe have been handled better, though it's also possible that Spec Ops just fits my preferences."
truegaming,3d4z7z,dyslexda,5,Mon Jul 13 19:35:52 2015 UTC,"The end scene of the game literally berates you for feeling like a ""hero."""
truegaming,3d4z7z,nitrowizard,3,Mon Jul 13 20:00:35 2015 UTC,"That's true, though I guess it also depends on how much you identify with Walker by that point. I remember I didn't feel personally addressed by Konrad on the balcony, I saw it as a dialogue between Walker and Konrad with me as an observer if you will. By that point I was basically watching Walker's story with me being the driving force that makes him progress. Of course there also are the load screens that address the player more directly, it's obviously been a while since I last played it."
truegaming,3d4z7z,dyslexda,2,Mon Jul 13 22:03:40 2015 UTC,"A dialog between Konrad and Walker was exactly what I originally saw it to be, because I don't get attached to characters, generally. The devs created content, and through a video game led me through that content. Nothing more, nothing less. There were times like the WP scene where I felt cheated (the infinite respawns with obviously copied animations were kind of immersion-breaking), but overall didn't think too much of the game. Only after I saw some developer interviews and people lauding it for its commentary on choice did I start getting a little ticked off with it."

I feel like the short hype the game experienced and all the talk about it may have been a disservice to a game that relies so heavily on the player approaching it like any other Shooter. At least in the case of Spec Ops me going into it expecting nothing probably made me appreciate it more, but it also makes it a bit tricky to recommend to friends because I don't want to build expectations or change the way they approach the game based on my recommendation."

I thought maybe if I killed all the snipers there would be a new option but of course the soldiers were infinitely spawning. While I still think it was a great and effective scene the fact that it was so obvious to me and the fact that there was no actual choice (not playing the game is not a choice.) made it disappointing for me.
truegaming,3d4z7z,NO_NOT_THE_WHIP,2,Tue Jul 14 01:10:16 2015 UTC,"The game just isn't for everyone. For me, the game didn't seem to care too much that I must have killed over a thousand people by this point and who knows how many civilians might have been killed by stray bullets and such from all the firefights you have been in. I found it hard to care that you accidentally killed a few dozen civilians with the mortar because the game gave me little reason to care up to that point."
truegaming,3d4z7z,raget3ch,2,Tue Jul 14 01:23:52 2015 UTC,"Personally thought it was garbage.  At no point was there any impact because you had NO CHOICE what so ever, there was none.  AS far as I can see you have a single choice in the entire game and its at the very end. (and even then, I dont know if its an actual choice)  During the scene you mention, I ran about on that ledge for about 10 minutes, KNOWING that I should not fire the mortar, its was painfully obvious.  But I had no choice, Well outside pressing Alt+F4.  So when it forces you to launch the mortar, it kills the civilians and you just think ""I FUCKING KNEW THAT WOULD HAPPEN""  In order for the story to progress the main character has to make idiotic choices, It wasn't a case of ""there are no good choices in war"", it was a case of, ""the leader is a fucking idiot"".  Game just made me angry, if anything I lead me to the conclusion that the biggest issue with war is stupid people with guns.  Which in a way, is a reality of war I suppose."
truegaming,3d4z7z,Mastahamma,3,Mon Jul 13 22:19:22 2015 UTC,"the question is why the dev feel necessary to make it so obvious: it's entirely possible to make the player unsuspectingly kill the civilians, like every other death from above sequence since COD4"
truegaming,3d4z7z,braww,2,Mon Jul 13 21:14:41 2015 UTC,"I feel as if the whole thing had just been an accident, it would be unfair, as you would not really be making any kind of deliberate choice by yourself.  ""Oh, a mortar, guess I can clear out this camp, I guess."" ""Oh shit, that was kind of overkill. Oops! Well, at least it's not my fault this happened, I couldn't have known!""  It's a very easy way to dismiss the guilt of the whole situation. In fact, there is indeed a moment in the game that is a lot like it - destroying the water truck. The goal you're trying to achieve and the given reasons suggest that destroying the water source would take away the power from the men who own it and give it back to the survivors in Dubai. A decent, justified cause. But afterwards, it turns out that there was really no other water left in the city, and the entire civilian population of Dubai will most likely die because of it. ""Oops! Well, at least it's not my fault this happened, I couldn't have known!"" It's a very common thing to do in games or in story telling in general, and, well, the lack of controversy surrounding it tells us about it's efficiency.  The Mortar Scene is different. It tells you what will happen. It shows you what that stuff does to people. It hypes up just how horrible it is. And when the time comes, you have a moment of reluctance to really weigh how fucked up the thing you have to do really is. Without breaking the fourth wall, the only person responsible for this is the player itself. And the scene does indeed cause players to feel guilty. So much, in fact, that a lot of players criticize the scene for not giving them a choice. If the scene was poorly made, people would really not be talking about it so much.  But actually giving players that choice would also not be effective. If players could just take a tougher route but get through the whole thing without causing this attrocity and even saving the refugees, that would also be a pretty morally easy moment, where a player is simply guilt tripped for being lazy. Again, a lot of games do this (as a simple example, if you do not keep a high Paragon or Renegade score in the Mass Effect games, terrible things happen - squad members dying, entire races going extinct because of your inability, that sort of thing, or other things like Dishonored and the lethal and nonlethal endings) and, again, it's really not as effective. Most of the time, the reaction when taking the easier, more brutal and depressing path is ""well, I was lazy, that's what I get, I guess.""  So, no, OP, I don't agree that the setpiece could've easily been more powerful. I think it achieved it's peak functionality."

I didn't want to kill my fellow American soldiers—but there's no non-lethal option, so I did what I had to.  I didn't want to drop the WP bomb, but you have to, so I did.  It's like someone order a steak, and covering it with maggots, and saying that all happened because they wanted a steak.  (The analogy being I wanted a good story [ie. steak] but didn't order the killing of civilians [ie. maggots].)

You're not, in your words, ""instrumental"" to it ""happening"" any more than the events of a film.  Pressing RT is a glorified ""Play"" button, or turning to the next page in a novel."
truegaming,3d4z7z,I_HEART_GOPHER_ANUS,0,Mon Jul 13 18:40:43 2015 UTC,"Nothing ""happens"" if you're not there to listen to it. That's the point. The film, and the game, are products you're consuming. The difference is that you're actually interacting with a game, not really with the film. You play the game to see the end. You do things you don't agree with when prompted to do so.   You don't need to feel bad or even responsible. I didn't. I did, however, construed the experience as a commentary on pervasive violence and hero-complex. Especially in video games. Now, it probably could have been done better, but I think many detractors are way to wrapped up in ""what do they want me to experience ? What should I feel now ?""."
truegaming,3d4z7z,TheObvoiousTruth,7,Mon Jul 13 18:46:17 2015 UTC,"Or when they spoil the entire game at the beginning for anyone familiar with the book/trope, they literally say it's based on Heart of Darkness in the beginning credits. Which was seriously disappointing and taints the experience."
truegaming,3d4z7z,pixel_illustrator,2,Mon Jul 13 19:09:16 2015 UTC,"I laughed at how stupid it was. even the area you are standing in was so fake and unrealistic that it was comical. Zero immersion.  I've felt more things after accidentally stepping on a bug than I have while playing this poorly written game with it's terrible game play.  Just stop talking about it, it was awful."
truegaming,3d4z7z,DarthDonut,14,Mon Jul 13 19:17:23 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  People like to prop The Line up like it's the greatest example of ludo-narrative concepts in action.  But literally it's only gimmick is to guilt the player for playing the game. According to the developers, the only way to ""win"" at The Line is to stop playing it. The game is not actually capable of acknowledging this ""correct"" choice (to turn back and abandon the idea of saving Dubai early in the game and not pretend to be a hero).  As a result the whole ""You're a monster"" concept just evaporates. You have no player agency to stop these events, you can only act them out. And because the game is a linear story with extremely limited player choice the fact is that you have no control over the major actions of the character or the story. If I stop playing the game, that doesn't stop the events of the story happening because the game cannot acknowledge that decision or give me an alternative, in the same way that me stopping a film before the death of a character doesn't keep that character alive in fiction.  Spec Ops would like its audience to believe that they are monsters for pretending to be the hero in a story where they have no choice but to play a character pretending to be a hero. It's a joke."
truegaming,3d4z7z,pixel_illustrator,4,Mon Jul 13 19:29:03 2015 UTC,"It's a fine line, I think. They present a couple of situations when you can make a choice, like the lynching mob or the hanging soldiers. They can't really give the player a choice to do other than the story they've written. The point is that as a player you feel what the main character felt, that ""saving"" Dubai is your only option. You're not given a choice as a player because the character didn't see another option."
truegaming,3d4z7z,DarthDonut,7,Mon Jul 13 18:53:50 2015 UTC,"That's not true.  ""There was never a choice."" ""There was always a choice.""  The protagonist always had the choice. He ""felt"" it was right to play the hero but he is reminded time and again by his squadmates that he does have a choice. But the player is not given that choice, and therefore cannot be held ""accountable"" for their actions, regardless of how much the game attempts to guilt the player for them.  Any attempt to make the white phosphor scene ""resonate"" is wasted when you realize that the player literally doesn't have a choice in the matter. I don't feel bad when other games have characters that I play as do things I cannot control that I don't agree with. The white phosphor scene is no different because in the end you can't progress without it. You cannot chose to retreat either."
truegaming,3d4z7z,pixel_illustrator,4,Mon Jul 13 17:31:45 2015 UTC,"The character is given a choice, but he was never going to take the other way, just like the player is technically given the choice to stop playing, but everybody knows that they're not going to."
truegaming,3d4z7z,DarthDonut,3,Mon Jul 13 17:41:22 2015 UTC,"Right, but again, the ongoing narrative for The Line by both its fans and its developers is that you do have a choice by not playing the game. That is the ""winning"" play. The game cannot recognize or acknowledge this ""choice"" and therefore in the universe of the game it's not one, which means any guilt it tries to pass to the player is undeserved."

Would you feel satisfied by winning? I think playing this game with the intention to win is the completely wrong mindset. This game is about failure, there is no winning. The entire game revolves around making the wrong choices, which is why this game is so compelling. The simple fact is that watching Walker fail is far, FAR, more interesting than watching him succeed. If Walker was a hero this game would be boring, we wouldn't still be talking about it years later."
truegaming,3d4z7z,Arrow156,3,Mon Jul 13 18:29:36 2015 UTC,"The simple fact is that watching Walker fail is far, FAR, more interesting than watching him succeed.   I'm not denying that.  But the problem, as I stated, is that according to the devs (and as implied by the game) you are meant to feel guilt as a result of your actions and the only correct choice is not to complete the game. The problem with that is that the only reason you should feel guilt is if you were involved in making that decision, and you most certainly are not.  If the game was presented as nothing but a study of Walker's fall then yes, I agree, the story is better and more compelling from that view.  But that is not the only thing going on here. The game gives you choices throughout the campaign, but fails to do so for key moments that you are then told to feel guilty for later. And again, even the Dev's have stated that the correct choice is not to complete the game, which is not actually an in-game choice because the game cannot acknowledge it.   If Walker was a hero this game would be boring, we wouldn't still be talking about it years later.   But I'm not talking about it because of the story. I'm talking about it because the developers pulled a lazy guilt trip attempt but couldn't back it up with any hard decisions for the player to make (yes, the execution choice in the game is a hard decision but it's one of the only ones the player actually gets to be involved in.)"

Hey, I like nonlinears games as much as the next man but it's not something usually found in story driven shooters, at least not in the last decade.   ...no. I'm complaining that there is no choice but you are expected to feel guilty for having made the choice to play the game. As I said, if the game was presented as nothing but an exploration of Walker's fall, then that would be just fine. But it's not. Linearity has little to do with it.   They are saying that there is no way to win but you can not lose if you do not play.   Assuming your interpretation is correct (I don't buy it) it's still bullshit, because the game harps on the idea that Walker and by extension the player are ""bad"" or ""losing"" simply for playing the game when the player has not made any of the choices that make Walker bad. And do not pretend the game only hopes to shame Walker as it is one of the most heavily 4th wall breaking games out there, everything said to Walker is more or less aimed at the player as well.   So what if you don't feel guilty, does the rest of the game hinge on your feelings? Some of the meta commentary may not apply to you directly but does that distract from the rest of the experience?    I would argue the entire point of the game, in the end, is to point out how Walker (and again, by extension the player despite the fact they had no choice in the decisions made) is a bad person for foolishly wanting to be a hero. So yeah it does distract from it since it's the point. If that fails to resonate (which it does, because there is no logical reason to feel bad about things you literally cannot control), then the game falls flat, which it did for me.   This game has got enough interesting stuff going on that missing one or two concepts isn't the end of the world.   Like...more guilt tripping through vignettes that range from barely-subtle to smacking you upside the face? Because it's certainly not the game's sub-par shooter mechanics, scenarios, or gameplay."

truegaming,3d2xrz,ZzPhantom,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:21:10 2015 UTC,"Gimmicky hardware is great, and certainly offers unique gaming experiences.    True, and it explains why Sony and Microsoft both made their own motion controllers after seeing the Wii have so much success. You can make the most unique games with weird hardware. Look at Nintendogs for example. It was released something like 8 years ago now, but no one has made a portable experience close to that since.    However, they refuse to accept the internet age, and insist on tired and true techniques (read: Franchises) to sell their games.   This isn't unique to Nintendo, however I do agree that it's tired (I don't know if you intended ""tried and true"" but I think tired is actually a more apt description.) The well-known example is Star Fox Adventures -- it wasn't even supposed to have Star Fox in it. But really, when you see reactions like the one to Shenmue 3, how can you not think sequels are safer and more profitable? (It's especially bad with that one, since I know very few people played the first two.)   Lack of proper matchmaking, lobbies, voice chat;    I disagree about voice chat -- a number of Nintendo developed games have had that for years (Metroid Prime Hunters had it on the original DS.) That said, whoever came up with the idea for friend codes should be fired.    They are a Japanese company, and it shows in their ""traditional"" style of marketing and direction. I only hope the new CEO pushes the company forward in ways they are lacking now.    I really hate this stereotype. Like a whole lot. (Especially having lived and worked with the Japanese people.) Japanese companies don't market any differently, inherently. They have a whole branch here designed to tailor the products and experience to the American market.    The rest of the industry has grown up with their user base (to an extent, and in certain ways. Other players in the industry make big mistakes, and compromise their integrity by underestimating their demographics) but Nintendo has not.    I wholeheartedly disagree. Nintendo doesn't need to ""grow up"" because Nintendo games are just as entertaining to me as an adult gamer as they were when I was a child.

When I bought it, I bought it for smash bros. Eventually got around to play 3d World that was bundled with it, and actually was surprised at how much fun I was having, and how childish it made me feel again. Hell, my girlfriend cheers and giggles every time I turn the thing on, and the parade of miis comes running onto the screen. She loves it.  This is not what I meant when I said they need to grow up. It's okay to play on nostalgia and whimsey. What they don't get is that the average age of gamers is older now. We all grew up, got our own jobs, and our own money. We got smarter. We started paying attention to the industry. We started having opinions. Expectations. Gamers aren't children anymore. Yes, there is a corner of the market that IS children, but they are not the entire market.  It's difficult to describe. Gamers, for instance, are tired of expensive DLC and microtransactions, tired of broken games on launch, or stupid fruitless kickstarter campaigns. And NOWADAYS, the userbase is old enough, and mature enough, to start speaking out, and voting with our wallets. THAT is what Nintendo seems willfully ignorant about.   While they might not commit THOSE crimes themselves, they have their own slew of problems. And their userbase is starting to get vocal about it. If they don't change their game up, and progressively move forward in the next year or so, I can see them facing the backlash that other big players in this industry do. They've been the golden boy for too long. A new paintjob on Mario, or Zelda, is not going to fix these problems. Only real progress."

truegaming,3d2xrz,mynewaccount5,15,Mon Jul 13 16:57:36 2015 UTC,"I can try.  Cross platform support can be thought of as a feature with pros and cons.   Take Batman: Arkham Knight for example. It's PC release has gone horribly. This has hidden engineering costs that do not perfectly show up on a balance sheet. Warner Bros && Rocksteady now have to deal with:    maintenance && support of 3 different platforms bug fixing on 3 different platforms QA on 3 different platforms technical debt fixing their image for the PC community (marketing, advertising, etc)   (its possible that WB and Rocksteady are handling this situation very well rendering my fears null (which would be great))  Engineering focused leaders understand these hidden costs and deal with them appropriately.   Thus my fear: the next mario game releases for the NX, PS4, Xbone, and PC. It runs great on NX, and PS4, decent on PC and is buggy on Xbone; however, because all of this extra effort was spent making the game run on these platforms, the game itself is kind of meh compared to previous Mario, but the game sells tons of copies and makes Nintendo a ton of money (which IMO, is probably what would happen).   Then rinse and repeat. The games continue to get more 'meh'. IMO, No hard facts, all speculation, etc; however, this is my fear."
truegaming,3d2xrz,dadoprso,2,Mon Jul 13 17:36:42 2015 UTC,In my opinion Nintendo knows that they have a unique spot in the gaming Industry. The Wii U and 3ds are obviously underpowered but do something that makes them stand out against the ps4 and xbone. And they'd only have to look at sales figures to see that even consoles aren't doing as great as they were a couple years ago. Ps4 and xbone tried hard to be tma PC with a couple exclusives.  But if people wanted a PC they'd buy a PC (or steambox).   I think a business CEO would understand this (maybe moreso than an engineer) but he'd also understand the importance of things that haven't been given as much focus as they needed such as marketing or naming. People thought the Wii U was a new controller for the Wii and that the 3DS was just a DS that could also do 3D which wasn't true.   Also keep in mind that a CEO has a ton of people to give them advice that are engineers and businessmen so it may not even matter.

CDPR just released their game the witcher 3 which has avoided all of those pitfalls while giving us arguably the greatest game this generation. They have given free dlc for every week since their game has been released and have put it several patches that have fix even the most minor bugs. Never mind the fact that their expansion pass is supposed to eat you another 30+ hours of gameplay.  Rest In Peace to Iwata-san as he will be sorely missed and his impact on the gaming industry is beyond words.
truegaming,3d2xrz,fearlesspinata,4,Tue Jul 14 02:14:54 2015 UTC,Except they are splitting Fire Emblem up into 2 separate releases. How do you explain that?
truegaming,3d2xrz,sneakysnake128,3,Mon Jul 13 17:57:19 2015 UTC,"Not quite. What they're doing is selling each ""path"" as separate games. Kinda like how they release two different Pokemon games each gen. Each game will have all the characters and that path's story. If you buy one copy, you can buy the other much cheaper as DLC if you decide to play the other path. Since it's Fire Emblem, we're looking at (most likely) ~ 30 hours per game to complete."
truegaming,3d2xrz,boopaboopa,-3,Mon Jul 13 18:16:53 2015 UTC,"I hope it's not. Nintendo has virtually unplayable game portfolio for me now, with three exceptions: ZombiU, Bayonetta and Pokemon. They really need to get their shit together if they want to expand, as of right now they're not even present in my country officially, and make only games tainted with their bullshit (which I know some people like, I hate it personally). Diversify portfolio, promote and expand to other markets, get your services into 21st century and for the love of God start begging 3rd party devs to make games for your hardware - that's what I hope new CEO will have balls to do. Wii U utter failure (let's not fool ourselves, it is massive flop of epic proportions) should be wake up call for Big N."

Nintendo would have to homogenize there products and online infrastructure to support the porting and inclusion of 3rd party. I'm sure a lot of people here would love that, but the common every day gamer won't care. They are already familiar with ps4 and xb1 as a way to play their games and most likely already own one. There is no reason to go ahead and adopt a Nintendo console that performs what their ps4 already does just to play the new mario with HD textures that they probably won't care about.  It's too late for 3rd party support and its not in their best financial interest. I think they should appeal to indie developers  instead and focus on unique gaming aspects"
truegaming,3d2xrz,luminair3,3,Mon Jul 13 17:21:02 2015 UTC,"It's too late for 3rd party support and its not in their best financial interest.   It's too late for third party support because they built a console that doesn't have the specs to support most cross platform titles. It's too late for this console cycle and if rumors are true, they are going to make the same mistake with the NX.  There's also evidence that Nintendo don't treat the small number of third parties that have worked with them very well. Lack of third party support is solely Nintendo's fault, the failure of the WiiU is solely Nintendo's fault. They have to change or be happy with being a secondary console for a relatively small core of gamers - and make way less money on hardware and software sales than other gaming companies.  Begging won't get third party support, but perhaps treating these developers with the same respect they show their first party developers along with building a console that doesn't have obscure ""developer unfriendly"" architecture with poor specs would.   and its not in their best financial interest.   I can't disagree with you more on this. GTA V is the best selling game of all time. That's one third party title that sold better than any Nintendo first party.  Just off the top of my head Fallout 4, Witcher 3, the next Elder Scrolls, Mass Effect 3, MGS V, FFVII remake will make insane amounts of cash for PC, PS4 and Xbox One.  Profits that Nintendo have excluded themselves from out of sheer stubbornness borne out of a narrow concentration on the casual and family market.   You can't tell me that missing out on that giant third party market is in their best interests.  Right now they're competing with smart phones and tablets for the casual market, and losing."
truegaming,3d2xrz,Heisenberg454,2,Mon Jul 13 23:04:01 2015 UTC,"I never said they missing out on third party support was okay, I agree that it is a big miss and financial mistake in their part. I only stated that it would be ineffective to just beg for 3rd party support and the struggles to try and get the ""hardcore"" player base that already owns a console to play 3rd party games.  Going forward with the NX, if they do not homogenize and do some console/mobile platform that seems to be the rumor mill it would be pointless to try and get 3rd party support. It just won't happen since those companies aren't looking to invest more time and development for a questionable install base. Which is why I suggest getting the attention of the indie guys to help grow and stabilize in a different way.  If they  do go with a standard console, then yes I agree with treating the 3rd party support with respect and making a run to show the install base that the NX is better than your PS4 and XB1 and here is why you should invest in it and buy another similar machine.   Whichever direction they go we cannot truly predict the outcome. Maybe homogenizing is better and the N64, GCN where just not hitting the right bullet points. Maybe trying something out of the box will bring an innovation that will appeal to a new market."

I never really played much of those series but knowing Nintendo those must have been some amazing games. Considering the effort put into Nintendo directs and E3, Iwata was putting a lot of effort into communicating with the older generation. The Smash Bros E3 event and the NWC 2015 suggest as much.

If you mean somebody who dresses like their favorite character and goes to conventions, then Nintendo is probably winning   It's not really the matter of who is who. It's simple question of how many copies are getting sold. Currently Nintendo lineup is good only for one and one type of gamer only: Nintendo die-hard fanboy. If you don't like Nintendo games, as many do, there's no reason to pick it's hardware over any other. That's quite visible when we see where WiiU still breathes: in countries were Nintendo consoles were traditionally the most popular (and yet even there it losses on numbers by massive margin).   I think you mean ""hilariously overwhelmingly well"", considering how thoroughly they've destroyed the competition and continued to expand their market, despite smart phones eating up all the markets for casual/social/skinner's-box games   That's why I said 'reasonably well'. Sure, the pretty much own 'dedicated mobile console' market. However, that market is not growing even remotely as fast as 'multi purpose device' market (again, mainly smartphones and tablets) with which they will soon have to compete with. The only advantage they have right now are solid 3rd party IPs - Pokemon and Monster Hunter. Game Freaks are already experimenting with other platforms, as is Capcom with MH franchise. There will come the time when both companies will have to face a question: is it worth supporting Nintendo hardware, considering there's a lot bigger market of existing iOS and Android devices already out there? 3DS as a hardware is nothing special nowadays, it's actually quite underpowered and heavy. It has advantage of physical controls, but than again it's not something that can't be dealt with in some core genres for the platform.  The key factor here is Apple and Google. If they make a push for a gaming, and if Google limits piracy (which they potentially could add some tools to do so), than Nintendo will probably keep only it's Japanese market in good shape and suffer major losses everywhere else. It will be enough to keep company afloat, but than again: if you don't grow, you fail."
truegaming,3d2xrz,Fresherty,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:47:26 2015 UTC,"It seems our positions are very similar, but with a difference in optimism about the market. I strongly believe that piracy is not a real threat to entering the mobile marketplace, or at least not one that anybody could defeat without wasting far more money and consumer satisfaction than it would be worth. I personally love the way that Nintendo designs their handhelds (I'd -love- it if they had the technical expertise to make a smartphone), but I can also see a decent number of their franchises thriving in the quality-starved android market. Even if they charged $30 per game (negotiating so google takes a smaller cut), there's such a vast difference in quality that I think most people would be happy to pay the price. Except for casuals, kids, and old people (So basically, people who are ignorant about their options), everybody is getting really sick of the industry's practices when it comes to watered-down and intensely greedy products. We could really use a bit more of Nintendo's influence on the market, and I believe people would willingly pay for it"
truegaming,3d2xrz,MyPunsSuck,58,Tue Jul 14 00:41:23 2015 UTC,"I don't remember exact numbers, but piracy on Android is absurd, especially in gaming. People don't want to pay.

They either don't have the money, or wouldn't risk their money on a game they don't know will be worth their money. Loads of pirates pay for a game after pirating it, so there's that too.  A lot of companies make obvious rip off ""me too"" games, many of which are far worse than 2048/threes. I'm not sure what to do about this, without copyright laws being a -lot- smarter with regards to intellectual property. As it is now, the design of a game is very poorly defined compared to the easily compared music/graphics/names.  I really enjoyed reading up on the design process behind threes, and they clearly put a lot of love and talent into its creation. This isn't exactly a 100% proof that 2048 is an inferior game, but I really doubt threes' profits were hurt by a similar-but-simpler game taking the world by storm for a month. The bigger awful result is the millions of 2048 clones out there, offering nothing but yet another exact copy of the base game"
truegaming,3d2xrz,MyPunsSuck,9,Tue Jul 14 06:52:19 2015 UTC,"I'll repeat again for any mod that's listening that we need a megathread about this. Preferably one simply for expressions of sadness and another about what this means for Nintendo.  That aside, here's my feelings. I think the changes were already underway at Nintendo. Iwata was already losing some say in decision making. We know that he was fiercely opposed to mobile gaming, and it happened anyway. Japanese companies are often ran differently from American companies. The CEO is definitely influential, but there's a greater emphasis on collective decision making. Whoever is elected CEO at this point is going to be a figurehead for the movement that's already been slowly turning the ship.  Let's look at a few of the possibilities.  Genyo Takeda and Miyamoto are temporarily in charge. Miyamoto is a known quantity to most gamers. I don't see Miyamoto being made CEO, but I don't think we can just assume Takeda is the next choice.  If you're like me, you're probably wondering who he is. He's definitely less well known. I'd never heard of him before today. Apparently, he made Punch-Out!! and StarTropics. A little background on Takeda, cribbed from wikipedia. He was involved in hardware development for the NES and he added the analog stick to the n64 controller. He was also one of the chief architects of the Wii.   Takeda was one of the lead developers on the Wii console. He is known for disagreement with the contemporary model of adding ever technical and graphical improvements to create new console generations. He claims that such a model is subject to diminishing returns. He has been quoted as saying that “If [Nintendo] had followed existing roadmaps we would have aimed to make [the Wii] faster and flashier. We’d have tried to improve the speed at which it displays stunning graphics. But we could not help but ask, ‘How big an impact would that really have on our customers?’ In development, we came to realize the sheer inefficiency of this path when we compared the hardships and costs of development against the new experiences customers might have.” Takeda began to have doubts about following this model as early as 2002. He claims to have figured out that consumers will not be satisfied with graphics at any point, that the new improvement effects will eventually wear off, and that “there is no end to the desire of those who just want more. Give them one, they ask for two. Give them two and the next time they will ask for five instead of three, their desire growing exponentially.”  He has famously compared the console industry to the automobile industry. Noticing that not all cars are built to compete at the highest level of racing, he points out that there are lucrative markets for the most fuel-efficient, family-friendly vehicles as well. Takeda meant for the Wii to parallel this model, and has mentioned in an interview that one of his major technical goals on the Wii was (being conscious of rising electricity bills and cost-cutting) to scale back the power necessary to operate the console while maintaining the same high performance. He has compared the Wii to a hybrid vehicle for its mass appeal and conservation attributes.   It's kind of out there, but I'd be favorable toward Aonuma. He seems more adaptable than the others. Being frank here, I feel that both Iwata and Miyamoto were simply too old and too out of touch with the modern game industry. I think they both had a lot to do with Nintendo's ossification over the last few years.  From what I've just been reading about Takeda, he's also worrying. A guy who says things like, consumers will not be satisfied with graphics at any point, that the new improvement effects will eventually wear off, and that “there is no end to the desire of those who just want more,"" and then thinks it's a good idea to ignore the consumer desires he's just delineated sounds like someone who will double down on the Wii strategy of cheap hardware with a gimmick. I'm pretty sure customers who are always becoming dissatisfied with their latest device are what most companies dream about Takeda.  For all their innovativeness, I was never impressed with Iwata or Miyamoto. Miyamoto has been making the derivative Mario games for some time, and Iwata's innovation was more like throwing things at the wall to see what would stick. Aonuma seems more firmly grounded in what I'd call evolutionary innovation, where you adapt without throwing away everything that came before."

truegaming,3d2xrz,BanjoKazoople,6,Mon Jul 13 14:31:04 2015 UTC,"I don't want to generalise, because many people who dislike the influx of Mario games since 64 have genuine and valid complaints. But still, I feel that lots of people hate on Mario games simply because they're 'too different' or 'too similar' than the previous instalments. People look at the games and say 'if you do anything too similar, you're being generic', and 'if you do anything too different, you've jumped the shark'. Both of which result in people saying that Nintendo have run out of ideas.  I don't know... I think in general people are quick to bash a Nintendo series more so than any other. Maybe it being a more mainstream game (in terms of larger demographic), more colourful and ""child friendly"" aesthetic, and pop culture status makes it an easy target for people to rag on. I mean at the end of the day it's not going to effect the game sales, I just wish that some gamers would take the series more seriously. Just because it isn't necessarily mature or gritty in story and presentation doesn't mean it shouldn't be held to the same technical standard as any other innovative game over the last decade."

I can't speak for others but for myself, I'm tired of the same type of aesthetic with Mario games. I really liked Galaxy 1 because it was a radical departure in art design and to a lesser extent, gameplay. I've grown up my entire life with Mario. Games like NSMBU don't appeal to me anymore. I want to see more games like Galaxy 1 and Thousand Year Door. Games that aren't the same old desert, fire, ice worlds. Games that don't rely on the same enemies like Koopas, Goombas, Shy Guys.   The charm of a typical Mario game isn't enough to draw me in anymore. So when you have the side games like all of the sports games, it's exhausting. I'd rather see young developers turning the franchise on it's head. That's at least my reason why I'm incredibly frustrated with the franchise. It doesn't help that I don't game on handhelds anymore so I'm missing out on all of the great Mario RPGs."

truegaming,3d2xrz,snookums,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:46:10 2015 UTC,"The open worlds in sunshine and 64 aren't truly open. They have multiple tasks to complete but so do many of the levels in Galaxy. Galaxy and the 3D land/World Series have plenty of variations on gameplay. The only thing I can think of that can get old is the three star coin implementation in almost every Mario game. At the same time, it adds a lot of challenge to completing the level within the time frame.  I haven't played a bad Mario platforming game and I've played them all. Super Mario 3D World is my favorite and from there it is hard to decide but they are still great games.  It's not like third party games where the games are nearly identical in physics, design, artstyles, gameplay. Or even rival first party titles are rarely as original for established series. I think Nintendo will be fine with the mainline Mario games"
truegaming,3d2xrz,UnidentifiedFlop,2,Mon Jul 13 14:42:51 2015 UTC,"I haven't played a bad Mario platforming game   Is not being bad enough?  I have a huge backlog of games at my disposal. I'm not kidding. I have at least 20 solid games that I'm certain I will love if I can ever get the time to play them. Standing right behind them are about 40 games that could go either way.   It's not like third party games where the games are nearly identical in physics, design, artstyles, gameplay.   I disagree strongly. The games aren't evolutionary like COD, but at this point, they're being cobbled together from the same base parts. That's why I used the analog of a Subway Sandwich artist, because it really captures what Nintendo is doing with Mario right now. Each title is new and different, but they all feel like one is simply experiencing the same deck reshuffled into different configurations.  This article echoes my feelings, if you want to here someone more eloquent than me lay it out."
truegaming,3d2xrz,snookums,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:05:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe I should rephrase. Besides the New Super Mario Bros series, which are still excellent and some of my favorite games, every single Mario platformer is a classic, with its own identity. The original Mario bros, the lost levels ( the original direct sequel that is extremely difficult), super Mario bros 2, super Mario bros 3, super Mario world, super Mario world 2: yoshi's island, Mario 64, sunshine, Galaxy, galaxy 2' super Mario 3d land, super Mario 3d world, the super Mario land games...with the exception of the direct sequels that use the same engines, the games are all unique. Physics, power ups, artstyles, level design, different playable characters, AMAZING SOUNDTRACKS.   I will concede that perhaps the characters may be the same or similar, but they still add new enemies and bosses, and different types of levels ( captain toad for example) and with the different artstyles, it is refreshing. That is my biggest gripe with Mario, the 2d games have the same artstyle and I wish they would change that and as much original music as possible, that's my passion.  Super Mario Maker is also using an original physics system that is in between all games, with different abilities based on the artstyle being used.   I also have a rather large backlog of games, some of them I haven't even touched because I have so much fun with Smash,mSplatoon and Nintendoland. Different strokes but I do see your point. I've found that I make impulse buys on a lot of sales and humble bundles but I keep coming back and revisiting the classics."
truegaming,3d2xrz,UnidentifiedFlop,4,Mon Jul 13 23:08:13 2015 UTC,"I really can't argue with any of the games in the sequence you outlined, even though I've said before that I didn't like the level based focus of the Galaxy games. Oddly enough, I'd say some of the Galaxy levels felt more linear than some Super Mario World levels.  I think the biggest problem with Mario's current saturation, due to all the 2d console Mario games, is that it is in some ways a failure to differentiate products. To an outsider, you must admit that they all look the same. The second problem is that by shoehorning all of your games into a Mario theme (Mario is often a skin over a gameplay concept), you end up eventually competing with your own back catalog."
truegaming,3d2xrz,snookums,3,Mon Jul 13 23:17:53 2015 UTC,"I get what your saying. I think it is a larger problem with the Wii u than past consoles because they launched with nsmbu and nsb2 had launched before on 3ds so I can imagine some people believing it to be a port, same as super Mario 3d world.  I think the Mario Galaxy was open world but the levels were segmented so it was more linear and organized, in that fashion. I liked the hub in Galaxy one much more than the sequel as well as the story. Galaxy felt more in line with sunshine and 64 to me, more so than Galaxy two. I think the level design was just more varied overall, a good amount of explorative levels, linear levels and gimmick levels. Great bosses though  I will say this, with Nintendos focus being to attract new gamers and otherwise, they definitely should be differentiating better. Like the next nsmb game can have a subtitle like nsmb :return to sarasaland or something. Like donkey kong country returns : tropical freeze.  At the same time, I think consumers, with all products need to start educating themselves on purchases. I got burned many times during my early teens buying products that I hadn't researched, though I never had internet until I moved out of my home so I couldn't if I had wanted to.  I think to an outsider, all gaming platforms can be confusing. If you look at the covers of most shooters,mther nearly identical, same goes for a lot of sandbox games and RPGs or open world RPGs like Skyrim.   Recently,mnintendo has actually had different box colors for certain releases (nslu was green, nsmbu was blue, sm3dw was red) so I think it'd be pretty hard for someone to make the mistake."

truegaming,3d2xrz,CorsairToHeaven,8,Mon Jul 13 22:46:43 2015 UTC,sounds like someone who will double down on the Wii strategy of cheap hardware with a gimmick.   I find that an interesting direction.  Coming up with a gimmick that will stick is pretty hard and just competing with PS4 and Xbox One is a pretty hopeless strategy so it wasn't an option for Nintendo in the first place if they want to remain in the hardware business.  It is all ultimately about the games and having a new gimmick to reinvent old IP and come up with original new IP will keep things fresh.  What make or breaks it is how they attract third party developers.
truegaming,3d2xrz,adrixshadow,3,Mon Jul 13 09:48:44 2015 UTC,"I think that is no problem to come with a gimmick, Kinect is a gimmick.   But the thing is, for Nintendo it seems that or it comes with a gimmick or good graphics, which isn't true at all.  I don't think that Wii u tablet consumes more processing power than Kinect there is no need to make an underpowered console that pushes away third party developers."
truegaming,3d2xrz,Maj3stade,3,Mon Jul 13 14:02:32 2015 UTC,"If you look at their history and culture, it becomes apparent why there is a trade off between innovation and power. The company is very conservative and very rarely sells anything at a loss. While Microsoft and Sony can prop up a struggling console with their other divisions, Nintendo is solely a game company. Having both a tablet and PS4 level specs would force Nintendo to sell the console at a loss which is fundamentally opposed to how they have been successful for the past decades."
truegaming,3d2xrz,mmouchi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:03:31 2015 UTC,"The console's power didn't push away third party developers. Especially the ones still developing for last gen's consoles. Wii U sold very poorly the first year and that scared away 3rd parties. Contrast with the Wii which sold like hot cakes and was getting tons of 3rd party support.  Nintendo didn't market the Wii U worth a damn and riding on the Wii brand bit them in the ass. Iwata even acknowledged that by saying he 'misread the market' and then apologized before revealing some great games at the time (I think that's when they announced TW101, Hyrule Warriors, and a couple others)."
truegaming,3d2xrz,boopaboopa,0,Mon Jul 13 16:05:10 2015 UTC,"I think that is no problem to come with a gimmick, Kinect is a gimmick.   The problem is, it never really worked. That's the difference between those companies, really. Kinect was interesting from a tech standpoint, but couldn't do shit. It was all about 'what if this becomes something one day'.  The Wii remotes were great and functional from day one."
truegaming,3d2xrz,OccupyGravelpit,4,Mon Jul 13 19:39:48 2015 UTC,"The Wii remotes were great and functional from day one.   Maybe they were functional since day one but it wasn't great, when the goal of the wiimote wasn't a simple task, I felt tricked.    Lets take Wii Bowling for an example.  Sure he could detect if I'm throwing more to a side than to another, but don't matter how much I tried to make 0 points, I couldn't do it.  The dance games are mostly the same, it has no way of detecting if I'm doing the moves the right way, but it tries and when it fails, we don't care because it is an extremely casual game with no real way of telling what you did was wrong or right unless you are acting stupid on purpose. You can be sitting and just shaking the controller and the game will tell you are doing the right moves.  Try to do something wrong using the wii and sometimes it will say you are doing it right, try to do something wrong with the Kinect and he won't respond, hell, you can even try to do things right with Kinect and he will fail.  Both sucks, maybe the wiimote is better than Kinect because he can be great at some simple tasks like playing golf I guess, but it was no way what it promised 100%."
truegaming,3d2xrz,Maj3stade,32,Mon Jul 13 20:13:38 2015 UTC,"Nah, Wiimote was amazing. Kinect was a fraud, basically. It never worked. Move was interesting, but it was so twitchy and not-robust compared to the Wiimote. The camera calibration stuff was frustrating, took a long time, and basically killed local multiplayer on the system.  So, put it like this: Nintendo took the first stab at motion controls and was the only company that actually nailed it, years and years before the competition got to the party. And even then! Microsoft and Sony were more interesting in proving that the tech was 'relevant' than they were in making sure it actually created new gameplay opportunities.  That's the difference between a game company and a tech company."
truegaming,3d2xrz,OccupyGravelpit,4,Mon Jul 13 20:20:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but Wiimote wasn't amazing from the get-go. It was a very unique and intuitive device, but it took the WiiMotion Plus add-on to get it to be good and that didn't take off until the motion plus was built in to every new controller. The thing about the Kinect and the Move is that they were add-on peripherals and add-ons always sell less than the base product, so it splits it's own market into people who have the peripheral and those who don't. This creates a lot less incentive to make a game exclusive to the peripheral, without compatibility for people using a regular controller without the peripheral, and in doing so you're basically making a game where using the peripheral isn't an intrinsic part of the game, but a gimmick that often doesn't even make the game better.   The reason the Wii-mote was so successful was that it was first to market, good at doing what it was doing, and more importantly was built specifically in conjunction with the hardware. If you wanted to develop a Wii game, it had to use the Wii-mote. Simple as that. The Wii market wasn't split into Wii-mote or non-Wii-mote games. A mom could go to Best Buy and rest assured that her kid had everything he needed to play the Wii game she was buying. Not so with the Kinect and Move.  This distinction is so heavy that when Microsoft tried to tie the Kinect in with the XBox One, the backlash was so huge that they eventually backtracked on that decision (like they do most unpopular decisions) and have once again relegated the Kinect to a separate add-on peripheral that some players may not have so you might as well not make exclusive content for it."
truegaming,3d2xrz,neonoodle,3,Tue Jul 14 04:05:04 2015 UTC,"A guy who says things like, consumers will not be satisfied with graphics at any point, that the new improvement effects will eventually wear off, and that “there is no end to the desire of those who just want more,""    Well he's not entirely wrong but i do think they should beef up the hardware a bit if only to appease the third party companies and get them to put games on their consoles again. You can dislike Iwata's decisions all you want but you can't deny he's found plenty of ways to create success that others haven't."

He claims that such a model is subject to diminishing returns.   Takeda might be right about that part. I have been reading how AAA titles are getting more and more expensive. But all the gamers that have stuck with Nintendo do not think that graphics or advanced physics engines are a priority. But does Takeda realise this?
truegaming,3d2xrz,DanAugustus,8,Mon Jul 13 10:02:29 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think Takeda is totally right and proved correct during the Wii and DS generation. It's a matter of hitting the right price point and having something novel to offer.  Nintendo will never thrive by competing head to head with Sony and Microsoft, and they shouldn't try.  3DS and Wii U were both too expensive at launch, and their gimmicks didn't justify the extra cost. Even Microsoft made the same mistake doubling down on the Kinect."
truegaming,3d2xrz,jmking,5,Mon Jul 13 14:51:49 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I think Takeda is totally right and proved correct during the Wii and DS generation.    I agree. I don't think the Wii could work again though. I think nintendo should shift focus from the local family (It's good to play together) marketing and look into the larger community and internet stuff. I'm not saying do what everyone else is doing. I'm saying put a nintendo spin on it.   The BSX broadcasted live events thing was a cool idea. They should do stuff like that. 3 games a year isn't really good reason to make me turn on my wii u every day, but weird live and community events would make things more interesting. Combine that with nintendo's quirky sense of humor and we've got us something special.   I really like the idea of Mario Maker, since we'll be able to build a community around it and play each others levels. Maybe they're already inching their way towards this."

truegaming,3d2xrz,Khanstant,5,Mon Jul 13 20:22:59 2015 UTC,"I keep thinking about Aonuma being open towards letting Team Ninja develop a Zelda game,  before Miyamoto came in, ""flipped the table,"" and made them make a Zelda skinned Dynasty Warriors. There's also the fact that he talks about the new Zelda so differently than a typical Nintendo developer,  or like Miyamoto,  referencing popular western games. An awareness of the competition,  of trends,  and an openness towards new ideas and other companies?  Nintendo needs that. I wouldn't be surprised if he's sick of the gimmicks, too,  since theyve hurt his series the most.    Maybe it won't happen,  and its just me wanting it to happen (not that I ever wanted it to happen like this). Then again,  he looked really confident when he announced the delay in Zelda (what he really announced in my opinion was that he was getting to make the game he wanted to make). He seems to have more clout and respect amoung the new concensus than he did with Iwata and Miyamotos Nintendo.   One thing is for sure. With how Nintendo downplayed Iwatas health issues and how they clearly created a false impression of business as usual,  we can't expect to have everything spelled out to us. We have to look for clues and read between the line."
truegaming,3d2xrz,RatSnakeRabbitSnake,2,Mon Jul 13 04:15:17 2015 UTC,"If Nintendo was smart they would take this time to re-establish what Nintendo is, both from a core philosophy, and as a message to gamers. They should try and get someone like a Tom Kalinske who shaped Sega into being a marketing powerhouse in America when they were a DOA company with Genesis. The problem is that they likely won't. Nintendo is built from the ground up to be a company dedicated to efficiencies and quality, at the expense of marketing and product development. And as such, I suspect they'll go with either an old hat in Japanese business, or with someone internal and an internal guard of Nintendo. As it is though, Nintendo desperately needs to define their identity in the market place, either as the cost advantage leader, or unique gameplay, or as the family console. Right now they haven't well established any of those, even if its what they do, they don't have the public's imagination as the reason to buy a nintendo console outside of handheld."

I threw his name out there, because in interviews, he definitely comes off as the Nintendo dev most open and just aware of how other publishers are designing their games. Most of the Nintendo devs talk as though they are deeply meshed in some sort of cult. The corporate culture encourages them to take pride in their ignorance of games made by other companies.  Aonuma shows both awareness and openness to other styles of design, but in his own work, but he also comes off as legitimately humble instead of that fake catty humility that most Nintendo devs feign. He seems to be the only one there who can legitimately admit to a mistake, a real admission that isn't somehow twisted into a little barb that places blame on someone else, whether it be fans or the industry.

My biggest gripe with that factor is online gaming. Everybody who buys games for playstation or xbox, pretty much buys them for the sole motive of wanting to play them online. It adds a huge amount of evolving gameplay that just isn't possible on singleplayer, and Nintendo has been so far behind the times with online multiplayer and just online content in general, tying their content to a physical system and all that.  I know that a lot of people on reddit buy games for the singleplayer experience, but I'm just saying overall the majority of people it seems like don't."
truegaming,3d2xrz,sirgallium,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:38:07 2015 UTC,"A lot of online focused games have simpler gameplay in my opinion. With shooters it's become all about spawn camping and choosing the one weapon combo that is unbeatable or op. With fighting games, latency is always an issue. I have found that most modern, online based games have very little depth and replay value overall. The moment a sequel is out, the previous version is dead even though the gameplay is very very similar if not identical.  Also, with the focus on online, developers have gotten lazy with developing new ideas. They know that a year later everyone will buy the sequel and they have to pump it out fast. Hell, call of duty had the same physics engine for years and it was terrible"
truegaming,3d2xrz,UnidentifiedFlop,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:46:36 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you and have actually written at length about all of the topics you just covered. I understand the entire situation.  The good news is, if you look hard enough, you still can find awesome games that don't succumb to these modern gripes. With the internet and communication today it's easier than ever to find great games. They may be greatly outnumbered, which is a shame, but they are still there and waiting for you to find.  I love playing:   Insurgency Eve Online Natural Selection 2   Those have been my mainstays for a couple years lately. I was also back into CS 1.6 for a while because the mechanics are just unbeatable, although I stopped because the bullet spray pattern is strange I think, and makes the game difficult in a strange way. That's why I switched to Insurgency, very realistic, and somewhat predictable bullet recoil and muzzle climb.  To a lesser extent I've also been playing VVVVVV, Rogue Legacy, and The Legend of Zelda: Ocerina of Time. I never beat OOT, last time I tried years ago I got stuck on the water temple. I don't want to use walkthroughs. This time around, I've gotten almost half way through the game in just 3 or 4 days. Some of the puzzles are really hard. Shovel Knight also looks really interesting to me, I just didn't have the money last time it was on sale.  What you're describing is mainly a symptom of the most mainstream AAA games out there. And that is not a difficult category to avoid, it's very easy to tell if a game is just the next iteration of Ubisoft or Activision bile, and avoid it. Like I did with Destiny. Wooooow, I have never seen a game so overhyped in my life. I expect it to cure aids and cancer and resurrect the dead with the kind of claims they were making before it was released. I've learned long ago though, many different times, to never buy a game unless you have seen actual gameplay that hasn't been manicured by the company releasing it."

I'm not saying that people's taste is bad or that only Nintendo makes great stuff, because they are slow to change certain things.   But, based on my life experiences whether through friends at school k-12 and college, online or jobs I've worked, most gamers do buy into hype. To just like movies and music, most people think that what is popular is best, but in my eyes, comparing Nintendo as a whole, to nameless online oriented games is like comparing Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, Tchaichosky to the likes of Justin bibber, or countless other pop musicians.

truegaming,3d2xrz,UnidentifiedFlop,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:58:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know, it just seems like, everything going online has changed so much about our lives in the last decade or so. And it seems like Nintendo just doesn't care, to their own detriment.  I'm not saying to copy xbox and playstation and do online like they do. I'm just saying there is so much potential to be had online, and I want to see Nintendo use it in their own unique way to make their games and systems even better.  They always look at things in a different way, and most of the time this difference between traditional consoles is what makes them so great. They do things in another way, but it's a way that people love and didn't know they were missing until they've tried it. I want them to take that same personality to online things, I bet they could do something super creative and different and awesome and fun with it, connecting things in a whole new way.  I have been playing Super Smash Brothers Mele lately and I love it, and my roomate plays it online on his handheld, so that's pretty cool. But they really do seem like they were being led by old people who didn't understand the potential that online has to offer, and I don't mean that to sound bad it's just how it appears to me.   I love Nintendo and their stubbornness to their own vision. It's what makes them so great, and gives them an advantage over PS and Xbox who at this point have just become very similar computers that run all the same games.  Nintendo may have made a small mis-step with the Wii-U, but I feel like they are such a solid company, every other console of theirs has been a success while others have died out like Sega. I think that they will be able to learn from that last generation and come out with something amazing again for the next one. They are the fun company, their goal is making games fun. I love them for that, it really comes through in their work."
truegaming,3d2xrz,sirgallium,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:12:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get it. I think their dilemma is the larger gaming population is conditioned to a static on One experience, and Nintendo is inexperienced with online, generally. That being said, they have massively improved with their online in splatoon, smash, mario kart, animal crossing, Pokemon, the new 3ds Zelda game...and miiverse integration is often times, magical and then inappropriate with penis drawings and jokes.  I think Nintendo does understand online actually. I also think that they are more conservative with their use because they want to protect their ip. It sounds dumb but if you compare the community of smash to the community of cod or battlefield, there is a distinct difference in commraderie and level of mature ness.   I also know a lot of fans want games like nsmbu to be online but I don't think people think about what that will do to the audience when trolls deliberately run to the end while people are bubbled up or throw teammates off cliffs intentionally..etc.   But look at Mario maker, that game is going to have a great online presence and it's basically a love note to platforming games. They have put so much into this game and supposedly, they still have a lot to reveal still.  I think Nintendo should work on better online performance and work on a better system for friends to play online together, for sure but I think they will eventually out their Nintendo stamp on the online space and hopefully it will spur some originality to competitors"
truegaming,3d2xrz,UnidentifiedFlop,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:26:49 2015 UTC,"It's good to hear they have been doing well online with their latest system and games, I really have no experience beyond the Wii so I didn't know that they had been doing that stuff.  And I think it's great that they are being more careful about it, and filtering out the trolls so effectively. There is nothing more fun than a friendly playing experience, where people complement each other on good shots, and laugh with each other in ridiculous situations."
truegaming,3d2xrz,sirgallium,2,Mon Jul 13 18:32:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it isn't perfect by a long shot. It's weird because smash, mariokart and splatoon don't have real voice chat options but, at least with smash, there are ways to positively sanction and negatively sanction people in a slightly inconvienient way bit at the same time it adds to the experience some how. It's like the parts the Nintendo falls short on can disappoint those who prefer a standard experience but for me, it is fun communicating through movement in smash, choosing rivals in Mario kart and splatoon and being good sports through miiverse It may not be as convienient to message people but the miiverse allows for some good interactions"
truegaming,3d2xrz,UnidentifiedFlop,3,Mon Jul 13 18:47:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah VVVVVV is super awesome! And I will give Sony Microsoft credit in their online structure. Lobbies and games, generally are executed well whether on 1st or 3rd party, even better than PC, imo. But, the games haven't sold me, for the most part.  the fate of destiny is saddening. I thought, finally a halo like experience, by an awesome developer, on all systems. What we got was a money grubbing, activision experience. Disappointing doesn't quite describe the feelings that I have. But, many people have a lot of fun which is good, but they also buy into the hype machine, defending the ""expansions"" that were cut from the game. I've got a friend who thinks online is the only true gaming experience and his favorite games are destiny and call of duty, which I admit can be fun games but I just got tired of that genre years ago. I only would continue to play halo for forge and splitscreen online but I don't have an X1 and I refuse to buy the halo master chief collection, even if I did.   I have been playing lots of smash bros for Wii u and splatoon on Inge and the communities are great. Splatoon mixes it up to where your party is always changing so your performance is always important to the team and team work is almost always rewarded with victory. I play smash online all the time and the players, for the most part always change the profile name to good game or nice or lol if either of us make a crazy mistake or do something insane. I have played my fair share of 360 and PS3 online, I'm not ignorant of the community, but in my experience, the voice chat makes me cringe with immature strangers and young, spoiled kids screaming and briefing me because I play with strategy and experiment with different gameplay styles.   I like mine rafting online and stuff but I don't like a game built around online, unless it is planned to have a lasting scene. I don't want to spend 600$ on 10 games over ten years (realistically, much more considering dlc releases that nerd the game without their purchase)  But yeah, I enjoy online games but I think Nintendo has done good with Wii u online and 3ds. Next system will probably further improve, but the communities they make whether on reddit or miiverse are much friendlier and welcoming to all gamers. And there is much less immature behavior, despite a good portion of the intended audience being children"
truegaming,3d2xrz,UnidentifiedFlop,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:18:04 2015 UTC,"Nintendo really has set the bar for prioritizing fun and non-harsh experiences. That may even be their greatest quality. Because like you said, the mean and terrible behavior is amplified online, and it is not easy to get around, but Nintendo has done it."
truegaming,3d2xrz,sirgallium,2,Mon Jul 13 18:26:57 2015 UTC,"I also think that consoles are more popular amongst western gamers, and Nintendo is an eastern company. They should take strides to understand us better but we should do the same. That's another thing though, Nintendo has a unqiue culture within their gaming population. We get Nintendo directs, we had club Nintendo, we get things like the smash ballot. Miiverse has Nintendo employees regularly posting about projects and such. And most of this comes from the Japanese run, side of Nintendo. I like Reggie files-aimes a lot, but even compared to Iwata, Miyamoto, Sakurai, Aonouma, Trinen...there's more that I can't spell the names of, we get so much involvement from them, directly to the fans. That being said, I think maybe they should hire a separate team that can maybe focus on online implementaition for major releases and OS implementation. So although I am very happy, I understand that many people aren't   Game philosophies are very different between the two sides and even as American, I have a larger respect for companies like Nintendo, moving gameplay forward in unique ways.  There's pros and cons to both sides but a lot of modern gaming vices have been perpetuated by western developers and a capitalistic-game making style, which isn't necessarily wrong, but it usually effects the games and consumers in a negative manner.  Sorry for getting off topic, I just really love Nintendo for the happiness it's brought me and I'm a bit sad about Iwata passing. It feels better to talk about what I like about my favorite company"

truegaming,3d2xrz,sirgallium,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:51:11 2015 UTC,"For all their innovativeness, I was never impressed with Iwata or Miyamoto. Miyamoto has been making the derivative Mario games for some time, and Iwata's innovation was more like throwing things at the wall to see what would stick.    really? never impressed, huh? tough crowd.  i agree with most of your post, but this last statement made me literally laugh out loud with how ridiculous it is. it's not impossible to be unimpressed by Miyamoto, but i'd love to see a list of game developers who do impress you if he doesn't."
truegaming,3d2xrz,instantiatedObject,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:29:32 2015 UTC,"It does sound a bit over the top with no context, so let me clarify. My original comment was in regards to who should be leading Nintendo, so you have to interpret it in terms of leadership.  As a designer, I think Miyamoto himself is hella impressive. However, he's also been behind the churning out of cookie cutter Mario games over the last few years. I can't entirely blame him for that, since I suspect he's just meeting demands handed down to him by the board, but he's behind Nintendo's Mario School, which has younger programmers learning to make derivative Mario games.  Iwata I also respect as a great programmer, but I've not been impressed with the direction he's taken Nintendo since he was placed in charge."
truegaming,3d2xrz,snookums,-8,Mon Jul 13 23:10:38 2015 UTC,"You know, I can't help but be frustrated when I see a post by you. On one hand, half the comments I've seen from you seem like utter raging lunacy, whether they've been directed at me or elsewhere.  But then the other half of your comments are obviously well-considered and thought out, like this one. It... confuses me.  I agree with a lot of your points here, other than Iwata and Miyamoto being derivative and tossing shit at the wall. I feel they definitely had a direction they wanted to go with things for the Wii and the Wii U, it's been moreso an issue that the direction itself was so different from everything else on the market that it may at times seem to be drifting. At least with the Wii they had a solid goal and clear 1st party direction. The Wii U... I think they've had a harder time with that, admittedly. It was an evolution on top of a novelty, and it's had mixed success, though I do like it personally.  Iwata himself was a programming genius, in my opinion. The things he's done in his time amaze me.  I also agree that Miyamoto isn't necessarily the best choice for Iwata's replacement. He's often been considered the ""face"" or the ""heart"" of Nintendo, but I feel when it comes to the company's public facing ""business face,"" someone else should be considered. Miyamoto is amazing, but I feel he's better off doing what he does best, and I don't feel CEO, figurehead or otherwise, is that place."

truegaming,3d2xrz,neonoodle,5,Mon Jul 13 13:49:52 2015 UTC,"Initial comments from Shigeru Miyamoto suggest that Nintento will stay with Iwata-san's strategy and goals over the long term:  ""The entire development team at Nintendo will remain committed to our development policy which Mr. Iwata and we have been constructing together and to yield the development results which Mr. Iwata would appreciate.""  http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/13/shigeru-miyamoto-releases-statement-on-satoru-iwatas-passing"
truegaming,3d2xrz,themantis5000,13,Mon Jul 13 13:26:27 2015 UTC,"Well, Miyamoto is being considered as the front-runner for who will take over already, he's running in interim alongside Takeda for now. Considering how influential and beloved Iwata was I imagine much of the fan-forward openness and the strive for broad appeal he championed will continue, probably for a long time if not indefinitely. Nintendo seems to build up from within so I imagine no real short-term changes or drastic overhauls of company policy. I think this could be a chance to re-establish ties with third-party developers, though, as the entire industry seems rallied behind Nintendo with news of Iwata's passing. I imagine nostalgia and good-will will be at all-time highs for a while now and if nothing else, Nintendo will try to honor Iwata's memory."
truegaming,3d2xrz,dogger6253,10,Mon Jul 13 14:59:52 2015 UTC,"Unlike Jobs, Iwata was not at the top of his game at the time of his passing, and hadn't been for several years. Fans have called for him to step down multiple times.  As very sad as this is, I think it's business as usual for Nintendo."

truegaming,3d2xrz,PandaStyle00,10,Mon Jul 13 10:51:03 2015 UTC,"I mean, obviously he wasn't personally doing anything once he became too physically ill. I was referring to his level of success as the leader of an organization, which had never been higher. Meanwhile, Nintendo just lost a console generation with a bullet under Iwata's leadership.   I understand why my previous comment is being downvoted, emotions are running high, but this was pretty broadly acknowledged prior to Iwata's passing."
truegaming,3d2xrz,Baryn,3,Mon Jul 13 12:28:26 2015 UTC,"The down voting is ridiculous. People always do this after someone beloved dies. They try to canonize them and silence anyone who discusses them as a real person. Using Iwata's death to force people to only say nice things about him is more disrespectful than acknowledging his faults along with his strengths. Ultimately,  it's also a manipulative way of trying to force your opinion."

truegaming,3d2xrz,ceol_,3,Mon Jul 13 12:55:26 2015 UTC,"Fans are always calling for CEOs of their favorite companies to step down.   This is not a trend with which I am familiar. Iwata's ""please understand"" was a derisive meme not that long ago.    He wasn't at the top of his game (i.e. Wii) but Nintendo was still doing great with the 3DS.   The 3DS line is successful, but not NDS successful, and Nintendo did not turn a profit in 2012 and 2013. The Wii was a hit financially, but not with a lot of core gamers, and had virtually no AAA third party titles. Meanwhile, the Wii U is just a dud.  The future of Nintendo is laid out with NX, and I think its success will have a real effect on Iwata's lasting legacy."
truegaming,3d2xrz,Baryn,6,Mon Jul 13 14:38:10 2015 UTC,Fans were calling for his removal back when Wind Waker was released. They were also calling for his removal when the Wii Music E3 fiasco happened. It doesn't mean much.

We understand that none f them were perfect but we also respect that they are games focused and although slow to adapt to some modern trends, that also meant that Nintendo was resisting all the bad stuff in modern gaming ( bad single player content, bad replay ability, overpriced dlc, rushed and unfinished games, buggy games...etc this list can go on and on)  The majority of complainers that I hear complaint about Nintendo management are the same people who buy in to all these negative trends and they want Nintendo to be the same as Sony or Microsoft ( ""powerful hardware"", standardized controller, and generally just make more mature titles.)  All of these traits are not with the spirit of Nintendo so anyone who Demands these things, I don't consider a Nintendo fan."

truegaming,3d2xrz,Baryn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:22:45 2015 UTC,"I agree on third party and services. All of which I have a PC for. The first part games have been phenomenal and by comparison to the competition, a much stronger and unique presence.   Sales don't effect me, the games and fun I have do. I want to really emphasis about third parties though. Third parties are almost all cash grabs at this point. With the exception of games like dark souls and a few others, the third party games launch incomplete, buggy and broken many times. They are mostly the same games. Bethesda doesn't make quality gameplay anymore, we just get a large, buggy world that ages very quickly and takes away fun gameplay elements from past games. Konami makes metal gear solid, with 5 being the last one under kojimas direction and the next will most lilkely be a phone game. Ea, ubisoft and activision are the worst of the money leeching, same game making companies. They are not consumer friendly, they have almost no quality assurance, their games are lazy and are no longer unique, not that they have been for a while anyway. Square enix's biggest franchise, final fantasy, has become westernized ( pretty, cinematic games, with gameplay not being the primary focus) and tomb raider has become an uncharted clone.   The only third party game I wish was on Wii u would be minecraft. It would be perfect for the gamepad and miiverse integration and the option for Nintendo Therese and skins would be sweet. But even then the console versions will never be up to par to the PC and PE of minecraft  I can keep naming all the formerly great companies that used to make unique games but there's no point. Although, in the long run it would be better to have third parties on Wii u or the next Nintendo platform, I don't think it matters in the long run. If third parties continue to release such badly designed games with all these issues, most of the Nintendo audience will laugh at the quality, compared to nintendos offerings. That's just a fact. I am used to complete games that won't require 50 patches over the course of the year, just to fix bugs. I think smash bros has had a few balance patches to go with dlc and adding some functionality like replay and stage sharing, otherwise there have been very few game altering bugs and the few that have been apparent were fixed within a week or two.  I'm not a rich guy so I can't afford every single game that comes out. I still am playing smash bros, Mario kart, animal crossing new leaf, Nintendo land...etc. I prefer games that give me a value and the third parties don't offer that with season passes, preorder exclusive content and mini fridge special editions.  I've kinda gone on a rant. I don't discount your opinions. Tastes and preferences are unique but I have been satisfied with my Wii since launch, and with the few third party games that have been exclusives ( bayonetta 2, wonder 101, Zombiu) and I even bought madden due to the play calling on the gamepad.   I don't think the Wii u price is bad either. It is  and has always been cheaper than the other consoles and though underpowered compared to X11 and ps4' those systems were obsolete the moment they launched compared to standard PC set ups. The thing with specs is the Wii u outputs 60 fps and in many games, 1080 p or 720 for some. The consoles with better specs aren't even attempting 60fps and most games aren't hitting 1080 p and they are only using the specs to improve graphics which is silly."
truegaming,3d2xrz,UnidentifiedFlop,4,Mon Jul 13 16:51:32 2015 UTC,"I paid 60 bucks for Pikmin 3, 60 for Mario Party 10, Mario Kart 8, etc... I love their games and I hope they keep making them. I haven't paid that much for a game on any other platform, nor have i been able to have 5 friends over and have a blast on one TV as easily either."

truegaming,3d2xrz,SaladWithHotDogsInIt,-4,Mon Jul 13 17:56:18 2015 UTC,unfortunately Nintendo seems to have a lot of internet trouble when it comes to my experience.
truegaming,3d54ct,ExoLightning,7,Mon Jul 13 16:28:28 2015 UTC,"First off, I think we need to put about 500 meters between ourselves and the ""is it art/what is art"" question. Both games are products of human creativity and they can both be analyzed in a lot of different ways. ""Is it worthy of being called art"" is the least interesting way possible to analyze anything.  Getting to your summary question, I think one of the really special things about games is how multidisciplinary they are. I think that any particular angle of analysis is not going to get the whole picture, but I think that studying only one of these aspects is going to really limit how much of the whole picture you can see. This is why I get really frustrated when people talk about only being interested in mechanics on the grounds that games shouldn't try to imitate other art forms.  Both Pac-Man and Tetris take a holistic approach to game design, even though they put their mechanics front and center. There are so many variants of Tetris that it is hard to talk about the game as a whole, but for instance Tetris Grandmaster 3 uses both mechanics and graphics to create this overall impression that the game is trying to screw with your head. Gameboy Tetris uses black and white to create a readable screen that supports the core mechanics.  Pac-Man has a very strong core aesthetic, it's one of the most recognizable games in history. This is due to its art direction and sound design as much as its mechanics. Its mechanics have quite a lot of hidden subtlety to them, but it is all communicated very clearly and simply through icons. Even very subtle mechanics like pre-turning become apparent because distances are very easy to judge.  Cinema has the term ""mise en scene"" to describe the unique character of film art, but there are other aspects like writing and editing that are also really important. In the same way, I think it's important to recognize both the uniqueness of gameplay and also the importance of art direction, writing, and sound design."
truegaming,3d54ct,spriteguard,9,Mon Jul 13 17:28:09 2015 UTC,"Well, I tend to stick with the dictionary definition of art as the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination. Pac-Man and The Last of Us are both art.    Where I think this conversation gets lost, though, is when people use ""art"" when they really mean ""high art"" or ""fine art."" I think for something to be classified as either, it needs to be created with, or perceived to have been created with, the intention of being high art. It's a fluid definition that some might think is wishy-washy, Pac-Man could be high art and not high art depending on who you ask. I think it's an appropriate way to frame the conversation though. If I can call something high art, I must have some justification for doing so, something about the work that spoke to me on a deeper level. If the same work doesn't speak to you that way, that's fine too, that's where the debate is interesting. People like objective terminology, objective standards for things, it's good to know that your opinion is validated by facts... But with art, there is nothing further from objective standards. All art is subject to the people viewing it so I think the discussion trying to categorize it or define it in broad terms is pointless when the discussion really only matters on a case-by-case, person-by-person basis."
truegaming,3d54ct,dogger6253,3,Mon Jul 13 16:41:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the simple test of ""did this make you feel something?"" goes a long way. And then ""did this make you feel something unexpected, or uncommon?"" A video game making you angry because it's hard is unsurprising and common. But when pacman came out, feeling apprehension and being nervous and experiencing moments of fiero and all that jazz in a contained experience was pretty cool."
truegaming,3d54ct,RFDaemoniac,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:56:17 2015 UTC,"I'd take it one step further: ""did this make you feel the way the artist intended?"" Just feeling something isn't necessarily the mark of good art; good art is when the artist succeeds in his intention, whether it is to evoke an emotion or convey an idea. So if a horror game makes you laugh, we can say that the artist didn't do very well regardless of how hard you laughed."
truegaming,3d54ct,phailhaus,4,Mon Jul 13 23:10:58 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this. How do we guess what the artist's intention is? Many artists do not like to dictate what their intention is, and in many cases may not even be sure. In the case of classic literature or painting, the artist isn't even alive to explain it.  Most of the creative things I love, I could care less what the artist intended - I'm more interested in what I enjoy about them."
truegaming,3d54ct,Alex__V,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:46:13 2015 UTC,"And that's fine. Something doesn't have to be art for it to be enjoyable. But if we lump together ""pleasing to look at"" and art, then ""art"" becomes meaningless as a descriptive term. Ironically, it stops being ""an art"", because then even a computer can make art, and we have no way of judging how good it is. Judging art based on artistic intent is a more useful definition, and it gives us a framework by which to critique works of art. Otherwise, the creator can just go ""oh that's how I intended it, it's perfect in every way.""   Problem is, we don't have a word in English for works where the creator has no defined intent. For the case when the artist is not present, we can analyze the piece and make a good guess as to what the artist intended, and then we can see how close they were to that mark."
truegaming,3d54ct,phailhaus,3,Tue Jul 14 12:32:09 2015 UTC,"I think you make very fair points, but I just reject that description of art. I think to tie it so directly to the intention of the artist diminishes any medium. If an artist creates an image to be ugly but a viewer finds it beautiful, is it bad art? I don't think so. Many classic works of art have very mysterious intention, so it just makes no practical sense to classify art in such a way - abstract painting for example.   I think the vast majority of art in history has been created as a form of expression but without the authorial intent being consciously clear either to the artist or the receiver/viewer/reader of that art. In that respect, games are in very good company. I also think as games are often created systems, they have a strong ability to produce emergent unintended effects, happy accidents essentially. More closely related to an improvised jazz piece or play, than a carefully considered text or performance."
truegaming,3d54ct,Alex__V,0,Tue Jul 14 13:49:34 2015 UTC,"If an artist creates an image to be ugly but a viewer finds it beautiful, is it bad art?      Yes. Again, this doesn't mean you can't enjoy it! This is the problem you run into when you don't define art well. People start thinking ""oh, it's 'art', so it must be good!"" and ""ehhh, this is crap! This isn't art!""  We have to decouple ""how it makes us feel"" and ""what the artist intended"". If you don't, you have no metric by which to judge art. When you treat art academically, you can give constructive feedback to improve the work. Otherwise, it just ends up being ""well that's just your opinion, it's art so it's automatically perfect"".   That artist meant to make something ugly, but created a magnificent landscape. I can sit there and enjoy that landscape all day. But the artist completely missed his mark when creating a work of art.  So when an abstract painter makes a mysterious piece and goes ""it's up to the viewer"", I still like their piece. But I have no idea what they intended, so there's no way for me to judge whether they translated their intent effectively. I can't judge it as an art piece. But I can still enjoy it. This goes back to treating art academically."
truegaming,3d54ct,phailhaus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:36:23 2015 UTC,"It's an unworkable system, for reasons I've already explained. And many of the most celebrated works of art in existence would have to be rejected under your rules. Notions of authorship and the author's intention can definitely be interesting in art, but are by no means the only or overriding criteria for it, thank goodness."
truegaming,3d54ct,Alex__V,0,Wed Jul 15 10:22:42 2015 UTC,"But by including all the wishy washy other stuff, the art world has become a joke. Just ask the average person: ""oh my God anything can be art these days."" That's because without accounting for artistic intent, the word ""art"" has just come to mean ""thing that was created"". How do you critique this art? You can't. The Art Lords have decided that this is ""art"" and therefore you must appreciate it. How can we improve the piece? No, don't you see, it's ""art"", so it's perfect.   It's the current definition of art that is unworkable, which is why people have so much trouble with the term. What is the point of trying to determine whether something is art or not? Why do you conflate ""art"" with ""good""? Can you actually explain why the current amorphous definition is better? It invites ridiculous questions like ""did this computer make art?"" The term ceases to have anything to do with humanity. It becomes meaningless, and something is considered ""art"" if someone pays enough for it. That's a ridiculous system.   Your reason for rejecting my definition can't be that some classic might not be considered ""good art"". They'd be just as influential even if we don't call it good art! Again, see how attached you are to that term? People really want to call these pieces ""art"", because it feels like that makes it even better, that art=good. We need another word."
truegaming,3d54ct,phailhaus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:09:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not rejecting your definition for any other reason that it isn't (imo) an accurate definition of what art is. I think you can critique art in whatever way you choose. In whatever area or medium you choose, there will be the equivalent of 'art lords' to reject and criticise - we have had that in gaming long before the question of artistic credibility ever came up.  I think the art world is doing just fine, personally. Yes there is always a discussion around the terms and what they mean, and that's why a lot of critics tend to steer clear of such discussions :)."
truegaming,3d54ct,Alex__V,2,Wed Jul 15 13:53:17 2015 UTC,"Works which elicit experiences by the viewer's interaction with the piece are often more meaningful than one where the artist simply presents an immutable intention. Some works are enriched by their context into far more than they would be in a vacuum or a different context.  Intent is certainly a metric with which art can be judged, but it is not the only valid metric. To put all power in the intent of the creator is to ignore beauty in the eye of the beholder.  IMO if a horror game attempting to be scary is hilarious through and through, it is as fine a masterpiece as if it succeeded beautifully at its intent, albeit at the expense of its makers rather than to their credit.  Games provide even more of an opportunity for art as a collaboration between creator and observer, as observers become participants. Particularly in the case of heavily procedural games, the success of the creator is more in enabling the possibility of meaning of engagement than directly creating it, and intent becomes secondary.  When my dwarf remained ecstatic through the death of her mother, sister, best friend, and pet at the hands of a bronze colossus, it may have been a bug or oversight, but her gleeful madness and death haunts me. That tragedy was my own, completely outside my control yet in the palm of my hand, and will grip me tighter than the works of Shakespeare til I am too senile to remember it.  I played dark souls 3 ways: as the survivor, as the champion, and as entropy itself... It doesn't matter which ways were or were not intended, they all had meaning, and all add to the power of a work."

Ah, see, I didn't say that wasn't true. This is another thing that I see from the time-worn ""is it art"" debate. For some reason, it is believed that if something is not called ""art"" then it is worthless, and that if it's called ""art"" it must be good.   I can use a Google's reverse image-recognition algorithm to make something that I find astoundingly beautiful and eerie. It's not art, but that doesn't mean that I can't thoroughly enjoy it for how it makes me feel. Likewise, those horror game developers tried to make something scary, but I found it hilarious. As a work of art they failed, but I can still enjoy playing their game!"
truegaming,3d54ct,phailhaus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:27:57 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend looking into The Intentional Fallacy, which argues that authorial intention is not only a poor way to examine art, but actively harmful to the field of artistic criticism. Here is a sort of abridged version (by the original authors); the full thing is a bit of a slog to read.  Other people have already pointed out the impossibility of figuring out authorial intent. So I'm going to take a different angle. My question to you is... How many people have to feel the intended emotion for a work to succeed? Obviously, not every single person is going to feel the ""right"" way. Most might, but there has never been a work in history that has made every single person who viewed it feel the ""right"" emotion, and there never will be.  Let's go back to that horror game: if it made 99% of the players laugh and 1% feel scared, would it be ""good art""? What if it was 75% laughter - 25% fear? 50-50? At what threshold does it become ""good""? Does it being require a 100% fear rate, in which case making good art is impossible? You tell me, but it seems to me that any point you could choose would be arbitrary.  EDIT: Second question: what about works like movies or games, which have multiple creators (writers, directors, actors, and so on) that may have different intentions, sometimes even conflicting ones? Which intention is ""right""?  Third question: Just why the hell should I care what the author's intention was, anyways? Artistic criticism has been getting along just fine without caring for a long time, and there doesn't seem to be any reason to change it."
truegaming,3d54ct,Canama,0,Wed Jul 15 03:14:10 2015 UTC,"Okay, here's what I'm doing. I'm treating art purely academically. Think of a student handing in a submission. His work is meant to be symbolic of the darkness of humanity. It's the Mona Lisa. As a work of art, the artist failed, because we can analyze the piece and go ""see, you missed the mark on the darkness bit."" How many people does it take? I don't know, how many people does it take to agree with a critique of a piece? Think about essays on Catcher in the Rye: how many essays were written until scholars reached a more-or-less consensus on the symbolism in the book? It's like that. It's not objective, you have to argue why you think the artist failed.   Back to the Mona Lisa. Just because the artist failed in his conscious intent doesn't mean we can't analyze the shit out of it, find other symbolism in it, perhaps learn new techniques! Bad art does not mean worthless.   Using authorial intent gives us the power to constructively critique a piece. I can say that such-and-such abstract piece really fails to convey <idea>, though <x> would have been more effective! Otherwise, you end up praising the most ridiculous pieces after analyzing it to death, trying to determine ""if it is art"". And that's a useless discussion to have.   As for the no author/multiple author issue: if I give you a horror game, do you need to be told its horror? Often times the intent is obvious. In other cases, you're free to argue the intent and make a case for whether they hit their mark, how it can be improved. S"
truegaming,3d54ct,phailhaus,2,Wed Jul 15 12:45:33 2015 UTC,"Your method of ""treating art academically"" flies in the face of actual academia. In the real world, art isn't an assignment handed in to satisfy a prompt. It just is, and it's up to the analyzers to figure out what it says and what it stands for. This is done generally not through what the artist says about the art but what the art says about itself.  Art is not a solvable question. There may be or or less a consensus on Catcher, but if someone else came along with a different reading, his would be afforded a place at the table (provided, of course, that he could prove its validity). You're trying to treat art as objective, but it just isn't.  Hell, what if an author makes contradictory claims of intent? Ray Bradbury stated several different intentions for Fahrenheit 451 over the years, disavowing the others as he went. He swore that each of them were what he really had in mind when he wrote the book, and since we can't read is mind we have no way of knowing which it was. He has claimed variously that it was about the threat of McCarthyist book burnings; that it was about his worries of a willfully illiterate society; that it was about his concerns about television marginalizing literature. Which one is it?  Of course, if we take my more open-ended view of analysis, it's whatever you can be convinced that it is. If you can find evidence in the text, then there you have it.  As for the last thing: Not everything can be divided so neatly into genre. Elsewhere in the thread, I mentioned The Big Lebowski. It's a comedy, obviously, but what kind? Is it a parody of noire? Is it a political satire? Is it just a stoner flick? A blend of them? Under your definition of criticism, we can't judge the movie until that question is definitively answered, and answers don't seem to be forthcoming. Under mine, you can come up with your own answer, as long as you can prove it.  As for the horror game, it's easy to come up with a scenario where that holds true. Let's say our hypothetical horror game was designed by a group of three people, who we'll call Tom, Dick, and Harry. Tom wants an action-horror game, so he tries to add in mechanics related to action-packed combat. Level design ideas he comes up with are based around fighting the monsters. Dick wants a more ambient horror game. His favored levels feature little-to-no combat and the mechanics he wants to add are based around interacting with the game's world, to make it more immersive. Harry is just here for the paycheck, so he just slaps down the first thing he can come up with and calls it a day. By who's intent should we judge the final game?"

That person does deserve a place at the table, he just has to argue for it. What I'm defending against is ""I pooped, is it art?"" And then the ensuing ""well if we call it art then that means it's good, right?""   Hell, what if an author makes contradictory claims of intent?   Well then, we'll have a hell of a time determining whether he succeeded in his intent. We can still analyze the shit out of it, it still has the themes and lessons we said it does. It's still a work of art that we can appreciate, and we can even look into it to see the author's influences, his philosophies.

Yes it's art because they meant to convey something, but we can still criticize it and say ""well, it really missed the mark because he was going for <x> and that really didn't come across. Here's how it could have been better.""  When I've been saying ""good art"", I've been exclusively meaning ""the artist achieved his goal effectively""; I can see how that can be confused with ""I liked it so it's 'good art' to me.""

truegaming,3d54ct,phailhaus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:27:47 2015 UTC,"OK, so you're using ""good art"" in a way that most people don't. I mean, Tolstoy would agree with you (incidentally, he thought most of his own work rated rather poorly), but most people wouldn't.  Something else: what about accidental art? Let's say I'm absentmindedly playing with my phone and I happen to press the camera button. (They make phones with external camera buttons nowadays, don't they? My actual phone doesn't have one or anything but I'm pretty sure some do.) Somehow, the stars align and I just so happen to snap a beautiful one-in-a-million shot. I obviously had no intention to take the picture, nor did I have any intentions behind its content or framing or so on. Under your definition, am I correct in saying that the photo would not be art, even though it could be discussed as art?"
truegaming,3d54ct,Canama,3,Thu Jul 16 02:45:51 2015 UTC,"To be clear the TL;DR. Should gaming as an art be focusing on mechanical progress or Narrative progress.    I'll focus on this, because it's the most succinct bit in the post.  While gaming is often compared to other narrative driven forms of art, like literature or film, it really isn't.  It's far closer to architecture in that there's lots of elements that appear purely aesthetic but are rooted deep in the functionality of the house.  Simply laying out rooms, better taking advantage of space, keeping things like a mother-in-law layout or split AC zones in mind, etc., all directly impact how people live within that house.  Having an open layout that allows for a dining room and living room and kitchen all adjacent with plenty of wall space for a big TV and no cramping is just as important for the experience of living as having a nice tile or hardwood floor.  Even more importantly is the soundness of the construction - the most beautiful house is worthless if its foundation is crumbling due to poorly cured concrete and its load bearing beams are riddled with termites.  Video games' mechanics are where those concepts come in to play.  A game like Tetris or Pac-Man may have rudimentary graphics or sound and no narrative to speak of, but if it's built on a solid foundation and has an inspired design it can certainly still be very successful art.  There's just been a serious lack of understanding of that side of video games.  There's not really a language to discuss it, and any real attempts to try have been muddled by the ongoing assumption many people have that 'fun' is wholly equivalent to mechanical excellence.  So to answer your question...both!"
truegaming,3d54ct,MormonPartyboat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:15:16 2015 UTC,"I really like this, especially the architecture metaphor. I've been playing Race The Sun and Fotonica a lot recently, which both have really heavy aesthetic sensibilities but no real narrative to speak of, and it was interesting how well they were able to communicate themes and ideas without going down the usual route we seem to think of when we talk about the 'themes' of a game. I've been really dissatisfied with a lot of bigger titles in recent years in terms of how they approach 'serious' themes, and, now that you mention it, it really seems like approaching games as something closer to architecture than to film could really change that."
truegaming,3d54ct,Yorubaland,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:14:29 2015 UTC,I would just separate narrative from story here. Race The Sun has a very clear strong narrative.
truegaming,3d54ct,Alex__V,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:48:33 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, could you elaborate? I would assume that a narrative would require a kind of 'story-like' progression e.g. a clear beginning and end, at least to individual stories. While Race The Sun has a very clear end, I'm not sure I'm convinced that that's part of any kind of narrative, or else almost all games have narratives in that almost all games have various win states and fail states."
truegaming,3d54ct,Yorubaland,2,Tue Jul 14 13:13:10 2015 UTC,"Well I would say Race The Sun has a setting, a surreal geometric futuristic world but with echoes of the natural world. You control a thing that has a journey through that world, with the goal of exploration and survival - when the game ends that journey is over. I suppose you could interpret that as either a form of story or a form of narrative, but I prefer describing it as narrative because it carries less baggage - a story tends towards having a more formal set of elements. And if we describe these things in terms of their narrative it allows for more of the free-form activities that games can often excel at. It's hard for example to describe Tetris as a story but a narrative does take place - a set of interesting events (to the player) do occur in a space, which do have a structure and a sense of drama to them.  I think the desire to be 'telling stories' is a thing that creates a big divide between different games that actually have a lot more in common. Would Race The Sun be better with cut-scenes with characters explaining a story that is occuring? I don't think so. But that doesn't mean it's automatically worse or less inspiring or intriguing than games that do (a lot of games with stories are dreadful!)."
truegaming,3d54ct,Alex__V,3,Tue Jul 14 13:39:31 2015 UTC,"Games are indeed art, but they are a composite of both technical and artistic elements.   The technical aspect of videogames becomes obsolete over time as new and improved techniques are developed and implemented in subsequent games.  The artistic aspect of videogames doesn't become obsolete and remains just as timeless as art in other mediums.   Though narrative is a clearer way to present the artistic merit of a game, it's not necessarily the core focus for a game's art. Mechanics are equally suitable as an expression of human creativity and craft. While a Rube-Goldberg machine isn't visually appealing in a still photograph, when set into motion, the beauty of the finely tuned mechanics flowing from one state to the next is what impresses the viewer. Or look at a skeleton watch set in motion, with an amazing myriad of precisely manufactured gears working in concert to achieve a singular purpose.   Similarly, the fine construction of gameplay design and balance blended together into a mechanically beautiful game is still worthy of being called art. What's more, games are a particularly interesting medium because of it's interactivity with the observer, where the player themselves becomes one of those precisely manufactured gears working with the game's mechanics to achieve impressive gameplay. Surely everyone here has played a game to the point where they've managed to pull off something amazing in the game, and replayed that experience in their head thinking ""Holy shit, I can't believe I just did that"". They make for very memorable experiences, even now you can still remember the gameplay feel of Super Mario Bros. starting from a standing position, and overcoming inertia to reach Mario's full run speed, and jumping for that exact distance to clear a gap, then immediately reversing course to resist sliding off the other edge of the platform. The mechanics of that platforming stick with you, and remains timeless."
truegaming,3d54ct,yumcake,4,Mon Jul 13 19:23:06 2015 UTC,"As always in discussions like this we have to define what is art, what something needs to be considerate art and that is something that i do not know. But as someone who loves games, i feel like games should expand in every direction, to games with Narrative being the sole focus and games that only have Mechanical with little to no narratives."
truegaming,3d54ct,tiofrodo,4,Mon Jul 13 16:56:36 2015 UTC,"It's much easier to talk about art when you realize that just because something is ""art"" doesn't mean it's good. If the artist meant to evoke fear but you laughed, then the artist didn't succeed in his intention: ""bad art"". So instead of asking whether games can be art, we should be asking how we can effectively evoke emotions or convey ideas through games."
truegaming,3d54ct,phailhaus,2,Mon Jul 13 23:08:09 2015 UTC,"I really like the point you made, but I feel like you're maybe underestimating how closely the questions of 'Is this art?' and 'Is this good art?' are linked.  If there's one commonality I can think of between all art, it's that we engage with art in a way that is unique to art: we adopt a kind of creative-intellectual mode of seeing that we don't (or very rarely adopt) when we see other things. I also think it's quite clear that this 'mode of seeing' is closely related to both how good we think a piece of art is and whether or not we see a particular medium as art. So people almost always approach 'high art' in a creative-intellectual way, people less often approach, say, film and pop music in that way, even less so do people approach games or pornography in that way, and then there's a large category of things that almost never get approached as 'art', or only ever get approached as art metaphorically, like road signs and mathematics.   Now, if this was just a question of 'do we approach it that way?', surely we could just begin to approach anything that way and it would be art, and I suppose there's some truth to that, but there seems to be a kind of internal logic to the 'hierarchy' of artistic mediums: to approach pornography as art seems less creatively and intellectually fruitful than approaching, say, painting as art, and I would wager that that's because far less pornography is any good as art.   The question of 'is this medium an artistic medium?' seems very closely related to 'how easy is it to make good art within this medium?'."

Pornography tends to be almost completely practical: arouse the viewer. Much like action films, this has been boiled down to such a predictable formula that most porn is indistinguishable. I don't think that necessarily says anything about the medium itself, just that we have very low standards when it comes to arousing material. I am very reluctant to claim that some artistic mediums are inherently ""better"", but I do agree that some artistic mediums make it easier for the creator to translate their intent effectively."
truegaming,3d54ct,phailhaus,2,Tue Jul 14 11:26:23 2015 UTC,"Does that really make it a fluke, though?

I am very reluctant to claim that some artistic mediums are inherently ""better"", but I do agree that some artistic mediums make it easier for the creator to translate their intent effectively.   I'd agree with this. Although I think certain mediums are better qua art, I'm defining art in a way that makes the ease of translating some kind of message really central to what makes it 'art'."
truegaming,3d54ct,Yorubaland,2,Tue Jul 14 13:16:32 2015 UTC,"I guess it's not the ""practical element"", but more the ""low standards"" bit. There's no incentive to put a ton of effort into making an ""artistic"" work of pornography when any old video will do well."

truegaming,3d54ct,phailhaus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:01:42 2015 UTC,"Before you argue that I should judge a work of art by what the artist intended, you've got to justify why I should care what the hell the artist intended at all.  A personal example: The Big Lebowski. It's the only Coen Brothers film I've ever seen. I don't know anything about them. I don't know anything about their politics or beliefs or what they wanted the film to be. But I can say something about it as an art piece: I see it as a parody of film noir. I mean, compare it to The Maltese Falcon. The Dude is a parody of Sam Spade: Spade is a hardboiled detective with a strong moral code who is out to find the one who killed his partner. The Dude is a bum who generally takes the path of least resistance, until someone commits an act that he cannot forgive: peeing on his rug. Of course, from there things diverge. Sam Spade is a manipulator who can maintain total control of a situation even when there's a gun pointed at him - and the one time when he loses control of a situation, by drinking something that's been drugged, it's his darkest hour in the film. On the other hand, the Dude has no control over any situation - he (with help from a friend, even) is unable to intimidate a 15-year-old, who instead manages to make the Dude and company lose their composures without doing anything more than staring silently at them. In the end, he loses interest in the whole affair, and the ""case"" is ""solved"" not through an application of wit (as in The Maltese Falcon) but by sheer coincidence, and it would have turned out basically the same if the Dude had never been involved.  But that's not the only reading of it. I read a feminist critique of the film too, which discussed the film as a jab at the pornography industry (I'd give a link, only I can't seem to find it, sorry). A writer for Slate Magazine argues that it is a criticism of neoconservativism, presented through the cipher of Walter Sobchak. Towards the end, he brings in other Coen Brothers works; I can't comment on how accurate his depiction of them is, because I haven't seen them.  Did the Coen Brothers intend any of that?  How the hell should I know? Why the hell should I care?  Yes, the Coen Brothers (and the actors, and the crew, and the editors, and tons of all other people - which is another thing: which of these people's artistic intent takes precedence?) created The Big Lebowski. Yes, they intended it to mean something, and did their damndest to ensure that it expressed that intent. But once The Big Lebowski came out, their influence over it ended. It speaks for itself. And from that, it's up to us to tease meaning out of it. The feminist critique, the Slate piece, the paragraph I wrote above, are all attempts to do that.  But if we were to take your definition of ""good art"", then none of those criticisms mean anything. Frankly, I think that's bullshit. Even my half-assed little essay means something, I think. Whether or not you agree with any of them, they're certainly something to think about. They're interesting.  I think ""art"" is an arbitrary word, more of a values judgement than anything. I don't trust any of the definitions I've heard for it, and I'm not so sure if defining it is possible or even desirable. Nor do I think defining ""good art"" vs ""bad art"" is possible or desirable; at the end of the day, art is subjective. But if forced, my answer to the question of ""what makes something good art?"" would be: ""is it interesting?"""

I haven't taken away from anything else. You're still free to analyze the work independently of the creator. But if you want to evaluate it ""as a work of art"", the artist's intention is necessary. How else are you supposed to tell how good it is as a ""submission""? A work can be filled with interesting symbolism and metaphors, but as a ""work of art"" the artist may have failed in his intent.   What I'm doing is taking the word ""art"" away from laypeople to abuse. That's it. I'm not diminishing anything else.

""Good art"" might as well mean ""thing I like"". If you come to me and tell me that you found an amazing piece of ""art"", it means nothing to me. Because you've defined ""art"" solely based on how you personally feel, with zero grounding in anything.  I'm trying to make the term ""art"" mean something, so that if you show me a work of art, then I can give constructive feedback and say ""here's how you can improve it"". And there is no way you can do that without considering the creator's intent.  EDIT: Let me be clear: I'm not invalidating all those analyses of Catcher in the Rye. Those are all still valid! But if you want to critique it, you need to know what Salinger was going for."
truegaming,3d54ct,phailhaus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:53:14 2015 UTC,"There was a philosopher in the twentieth century, Ludwig Wittgenstein, who asked what all games have in common. He provided board games, card games, ball games, and less-categorizable games like Ring-Around-The-Roses as examples, and we of course can add video games. He concludes that, at the end of the day, the major commonality is that they're all called games. There is no way to draw the boundary between games and not-games that will not exclude some things people call games or include some things people call not-games or both.  Well, that's what I think about art. At the end of the day, art is just an abstract category. Art might be aesthetically pleasing or emotional or something else, but I don't think a concrete definition of art is possible, necessary, or desirable.  You can also give constructive feedback without intent. For instance: does the work send a consistent message, or does it contradict itself? I can tell you that without knowing or caring what the intended meaning of the work was"
truegaming,3d54ct,Canama,0,Wed Jul 15 23:22:30 2015 UTC,"I mean, I think my definition of art is pretty damn broad. I've been thinking about it as ""something made with creative intent"". I'm actually trying to put as many things under the ""art"" umbrella as possible, so that we don't have to have the ""is it art"" debate. Instead, I want to talk about ""did the artist effectively convey <x> effectively"". The constructive criticism bit.   You can also give constructive feedback without intent. For instance: does the work send a consistent message, or does it contradict itself, for instance?   Can you? I don't think so. How can you tell what's inconsistent without knowing the intent? Like, what if the inconsistencies were part of the intent? A piece might seem inconsistent through one lens and consistent through another."
truegaming,3d54ct,phailhaus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:34:28 2015 UTC,"Not broad enough for my liking.  How do you define ""made""? Is Fountain by Marcel Duchamp art? It's just a urinal that he took, mounted upside down, wrote a signature on (not actually his signature, mind - no one knows who or what ""R.Mutt"" is), and tried to enter into an art exhibition (it was rejected). Or In Advance of the Broken Arm, which is again Duchamp - it's just a snow shovel with his name written on it that he declared art. (There are other pieces of this type, not all by him - they're called ""readymades"") He did not make the urinal or the shovel, and they were certainly not produced with creative intent. Yet they are considered revolutionary art pieces today. Was his signing his name on it and verbally declaring it art sufficient to meet your criteria for ""making""?  As for the second bit, sure I can - hell, people did it with BioShock, when the term ""ludonarrative dissonance"" (which I know has been abused to hell and back) was coined. BioShock does it twice, in fact! The setting of the game is a failed Objectivist utopia, a Galt's Gulch twenty leagues under the sea. The audio logs throughout the game show the decline and fall of the city, with several characters even discussing the exact reason why the city is doomed (""Even in a utopia, somebody's got to clean the toilets""). And yet, much of the game is spent becoming the biggest, baddest thing in Rapture - which is pretty Objectivist. Secondly, the big twist halfway through the game is that your character was being mind-controlled by the villain to do his bidding, which is a subversion of the usual video game trope of doing things for no reason other than being told to. But for the other half of the game, even though you've broken away from the mind control and are now ostensibly a free man, you once again have no choice but to do things a (different) character tells you. I don't need to ponder the intent of Ken Levine or anyone else at Irrational to point those out."

I consider The Fountain art, because there's that creative intent behind choosing that piece specifically and presenting it as art.   And yet, much of the game is spent becoming the biggest, baddest thing in Rapture - which is pretty Objectivist.   But see, from another perspective that could make perfect sense! Because the way I saw it, by the end of the game you had become a Splicer. You could interpret it as ""See how power hungry and destructive you became? An entire city of that could not survive!""   When we attempt to critique without knowing intent, we're assuming we've got a good idea of what the artist intended and showing how it's inconsistent against that. Otherwise, you may be criticizing the wrong facet; there still might be an inconsistency, but it's just not the thing you pointed out."

I have to agree with /u/dogger6253 here:   the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination   My academic understanding of art starts and ends with a freshman college course which did not even touch video games.   I have seen painting valued highly and knowing what tempura is or how neoclassicism developed didn't make me enjoy something I found personally unappealing any more.  It all depends on the artist(s). Was the game intended to inspire wonder or showcase ingenuous use of coding design? Does it appeal to consumers for aesthetic reasons?  That's art to me.  Tetris was an art. It was a simple game - a tiny amount of code in today's terms - that offered changing color schemes and difficulties. From this came nearly endless puzzles.  My mother played Tetris when I was a boy. A lot! She worked so much, and did not get to play often, but when she did she went far. I would not call her an artist.

And I just don't think it's relevant, because the variance in both genres, quality, etc vary so wildly and involve so much subjectivity that ultimately whether you see a specific game as art or not, or in what way, or it's emotional depth or cultural significance, it shouldn't really have any impact on whether you play or enjoy the game or not.  It's a discussion that can be had I suppose, but I just fail to see the relevance of it.

I absolutely believe this kind of incentivisation is good game design.  The Halo games always hide an extra scene behind the credits that was only viewable for players who cleared the final level on Legendary difficulty. Getting together a friend or two so you can easily blast through it was common behaviour and was one of the many ways the series would foster community growth.  Another example that comes to mind from Halo was the Recon Armour unlock system. The feats required to unlock your armour were very difficult and made it nearly impossible for an unskilled player to acquire. Specifically, the Firefight mission that had to be completed was made extra difficult if you had an anchor on your team, as they would devour the shared life pool and cut an attempt short. Whether by design or not, it prohibited boosting lesser players through the challenges."

Amateur sportspeople don't get the same kind of admiration as professionals because they haven't proven their skill to be at the top of the game.  It's really no different with video games.  The one caveat here is that there are some forms of difficulty which are more genuine than others.  Some games are lazy and adjust difficulty artificially by making enemies healthier and more numerous instead of actually adding new considerations.

truegaming,3d0i3o,krabbymcnabby,45,Mon Jul 13 09:44:42 2015 UTC,"I think it depends of what the reward is.   A part of the story arc is being revealed ? Satisfying for the player who thinks he deserved it, but frustrating for the not-so-skilled one that will be deprived from part of the story.  Bigger loot and XP ? Seems fair to me. You're taking higher risks, you're getting higher rewards. It could even help the game to keep balance, and not getting seriously underpowered.  New content, such as items and skills ? Same for point 1, it is frustrating for those who aren't good enough to make their way through higher difficulties.  Gameplay changes ? I think STALKER handled it well. If you took higher risks by playing on Master difficulty, enemies were more accurate and hit harder, but they had less life, instead of the bullet sponges from low difficulties. So you were more likely to die from them, but your reflexes and tactics could be better used, and you could kill them faster as well. I considered that a sort of ""reward"" for accepting to take higher risks."

It was called something like ""Heaven or Hell"" and was a mode where enemies and the main character would die in one hit.   Oh man, this was my crowning achievement for the Xbox 360.  Heaven or Hell mode is actually laughably easy, because yes, you die in one hit, but so does everything, including bosses. There are a few exceptions that make it hard (Sanctus's shield, and Dante dodging/blocking everything). But really, it's easy to just breeze through with just shooting everything.  Hell or Hell mode is the ultimate challenge. To summarize, it's playing Son of Sparda mode (hard mode), where you die in one hit, but nothing else. You have 3 gold orbs, as in Heaven or Hell Mode, which gives you 4 attempts. I'm trying to recall if some levels have checkpoints (like before bosses) but it has been a while. I'm not sure if I'm going to attempt it on the Special Edition, especially since there's also Turbo Mode and Legendary Dark Knight mode, plus all the new characters.  Holy hell, Hell or Hell mode was intense. But I did it. There were a few levels that were extremely frustrating. One that sticks out in my mind is Dante's second to last mission, just after beating Berial. I distinctly remember that this level had no checkpoint, if any of them indeed have them. It has a bunch of enemies in tight quarters, multiple Alto Angelos, and the boss is Agnus, who summons projectile-spewing enemies."

The only significant difference between a good and a bad player would be the skills: how do you manage your team, what are your battle tactics, how did you construct your build ?  There were special zones in the end-game that were of extremely high difficulty: the Abyss, the Fissure of Woe, the Underworld. Populated by overpowered enemies, it was the only place where you could get special crafting ingredients that could be used to create the most badass and prestigious armors in the game.   Same stats as the other armors, mind you, but they gave away that you were a good player, that spent a lot of skillz and dedication into obtaining those ingredients.

truegaming,3d0i3o,woohooitsdave,26,Sun Jul 12 15:21:59 2015 UTC,"I was going to mention this.  For those not in the know, this game had a level slider. You could lower or raise the level of your character to make things easier or harder. You could do this at any point between fights.  Raising your level (making the game easier) lowered the rare drop rate multiplier and the experience that your equipment gains and lowering you level (making the game harder) did the opposite. So if you halved your level you might be 3 times more likely to get a rare drop.   IIRC there were thresholds for certain rarities of items. You had a 0% chance of getting a rare item if you made the game easier, and you had to make it harder to get the rarest items."
truegaming,3d0i3o,gyroda,8,Sun Jul 12 16:21:29 2015 UTC,IIRC item drops were tied to difficulty so you could ONLY get certain items if your difficulty was set to Normal/Easy/Hard/ect
truegaming,3d0i3o,TheHeavyMetalNerd,9,Sun Jul 12 18:43:34 2015 UTC,"Somewhat. Each enemy has a drop table. Each item on the drop table has a base drop rate, modified by lowering your character level (or by very very rare drop rate increase items). Every enemy has one item per difficulty level, so yes, the enemy will only drop its particular Hard Mode item if you're on hard, but that isn't to say you can only get that particular item on hard because other enemies may have the same item on their drop table at a lower difficulty. You can also get items from lower difficulties than what you're set to if the RNG makes you miss the higher difficulty items.  Also, putting this into words is more difficult than expected lol.

truegaming,3d0i3o,JamoJustReddit,28,Mon Jul 13 07:26:07 2015 UTC,"For what is, in my opinion, a perfect example of this, see Kid Icarus: Uprising. The intensity slider is a brilliant idea for the game, and is generally great. Moreso when combined with other mechanics like weapon fusion, but still."
truegaming,3d0i3o,Spruceupthepimpmobil,29,Sun Jul 12 15:20:56 2015 UTC,"Explanation of the intensity slider: you could set the difficulty to anywhere between 0.0 and 9.0 which would alter the strength, behavior, and number of enemies ranging from standby and watch you win to mercilessly kill. Higher difficulties would also yield greater rewards: stronger weapon drops, more ""hearts"" (in game currency), etc. There were even sections of certain levels that would be blocked by ""level gates"" which would only open if reached at a certain intensity.  What the intensity slider really did well though was nail the risk side of risk/reward. Of course you would have to face a tougher challenge at higher difficulties to obtain better rewards, but if you happened to fail at that higher difficulty, you would revert to an earlier checkpoint and have 1.0 subtracted from your intensity. That meant you couldn't just set the difficulty to 9.0 and take your time griding your way through a difficult level shrugging off deaths as you pickup awesome loot. In addition to dropping in intensity, you would also lose some of the score, hearts, and loot you obtained after each death. You would also have to ""wager"" hearts in order to play at higher difficulties meaning you wouldn't just lose hearts you gained during the level when you died, but rather if you died enough, you could come out of that level with a net loss of hearts for biting off more than you could chew (playing at intensity 2.0 was free, anything more cost hearts for the risk, anything lower also cost hearts since you're basically purchasing a free-ride).  This system was also useful not just for punishing players looking to push themselves too far in the pursuit of loot though. It also helped ease players just looking to win through the game, hopefully limiting their frustration. Rather than keeping a player trapped fighting a level's boss at a difficulty they can't handle (having to choose between repeating the fight until they win or restarting the level from the beginning on an easier setting) the intensity slider allows the player to retry just the boss fight (or whatever section is giving them trouble) at a slightly easier setting after each failed attempt. Also, since the game tracks what intensity you completed each level at, its just kinda cool to start them all at 9.0 and see which levels you've had the most success with by looking at the highest intensity you ended up finishing each one with."
truegaming,3d0i3o,TransPM,8,Sun Jul 12 20:20:25 2015 UTC,"You're right on a lot of points there.  What really frustrated me with the level slider was when I'd be playing a level and be making progress on it but die a few times along the way, and be forced to lower my difficulty and then proceed to steamroll the rest of the stage.  It made winning not feel like I earned it, as if I cheated.  I eventually got to the point where if my difficulty was lowered I'd just restart the whole stage, which was still frustrating but at least then when I beat a stage I could be happy about it.  If I had designed that part of the game, I would've set it up so instead of force-lowering your difficulty it simply drops the amount of hearts and quality of loot you get to that of an easier difficulty (so like if you die too many times on 6.5 it drops your loot down to 5.5 quality).  Then it would give the player the option of lowering the difficulty."
truegaming,3d0i3o,SuperKirbyFan,7,Sun Jul 12 21:21:16 2015 UTC,"I agree, though I think the new Smash Bros largely fixed this issue by making the penalty for failing only lower your intensity level by 0.5 (also nice because I pretty much never found myself playing at an intensity that didn't end with an even .0). But Sakurai's team definitely had a great idea in creating and implementing the feature for KI:U, it just needed a little fine tuning, and has since gotten a bit of that and improved for it.  If I were to take it one step further, I'd have the intensity drop based on how far you got. For example, if you played a level on 9.0 and got all the way to the boss before dying, I'd have it let you try fighting the boss again at maybe 8.9 - 8.7 rather than dropping you straight to 8.0. But if you couldn't even make or past the flying stage, you definitely deserve a full 1.0 or at least 0.9 intensity penalty (this would also give a better feel for exactly what difficulty you're capable of handling a level at since you move the intensity down in smaller increments to better find that sweetspot)."
truegaming,3d0i3o,TransPM,5,Mon Jul 13 00:22:57 2015 UTC,Sigh... I really wish they'd port that game to Wii U for the benefit of those of us with banana hands. I've been waiting for the series to come back for a really long time and Uprising is great but I just can't play it because of the controls.
truegaming,3d0i3o,rabidassbaboon,4,Sun Jul 12 16:42:49 2015 UTC,"A WiiU port or sequel would be great. While the touch controls were good for things like quick and precise aiming (you could easily jump your reticule from one corner to the other by moving the stylus much faster than you would be able to with control stick aiming), it created far more issues than it solved; not to mention the handcramps (though I got a soft rubber case with controller-like grips which helped immensely).  But now with Splatoon, I feel like we have the perfect balance for that kind of control. Traditional dual thumbstick layout for moving and aiming, but with the added benefit of gyrocontrols for twitch/precision movements.  In the end though, I understand the choices they made in terms of control scheme. Seeing as they wanted it on the 3DS, it was probably a better call to have somewhat uncomfortable touch controls rather than require a circle-pad-pro just to be able to play the game at all since that would severely limit their player base, and they were banking on it being a big title."
truegaming,3d0i3o,TransPM,3,Sun Jul 12 20:02:43 2015 UTC,"I actually didn't mind the controls, to be honest. It got uncomfortable during extended play (4+ hours), but before that, I thought the controls were quite intuitive."

I absolutely HATED the flick approach to spinning the camera."
truegaming,3d0i3o,TheHeavyMetalNerd,5,Sun Jul 12 18:44:22 2015 UTC,That's what is so frustrating about it. It's a brilliant game buried under shitty mechanics.

truegaming,3d0i3o,ShortchangeParamecia,13,Mon Jul 13 01:06:14 2015 UTC,"For all the problems Thief 2014 had, one of the things I thought it did perfectly was a very expansive difficulty menu.  You could turn off the focus mode, force a no kill run, force a complete ghost run, turn off all the UI elements, make the game as hard or as easy as you wanted.  I would love more games to do that."
truegaming,3d0i3o,MetaNightmare,35,Sun Jul 12 19:08:44 2015 UTC,"Ideally the reward is in the gameplay itself, because it gets more and more interesting the more the player learns and the more depth he unlocks. Witnessing yourself grow is the unique kind of value games can provide. Of course only good games do so."
truegaming,3d0i3o,Nachtfischer,17,Sun Jul 12 16:53:05 2015 UTC,"Ideally the reward is in the gameplay itself   I agree. Somebody above mentioned hiding bonus scenes behind a difficulty wall, and I think that's silly, especially in the age of the internet. It's not real incentive at all. If I don't enjoy your game at higher difficulties, then I'll just play it how it's fun and watch the secret ending online.   I also like the idea of raising difficulty through gameplay choices and suggestion. Like, instead of having a ""hard mode"", the game challenges you to play in such a way that is more difficult. An obvious example of this is the WoW hard modes from Ulduar, or the zero death runs in Dark Souls, which essentially give the game a hardcore mode."
truegaming,3d0i3o,freeogy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:16:22 2015 UTC,"A good example of this is the Naughty Dog games where playing the game on a harder difficulty doesn't reward you with anything besides achievements. I love playing those games on the hardest difficulty purely for the challenge alone. By that point, you've already learned the story and what happens at the end so you can focus your attention on understanding the system used in the game and how to exploit it. There's just something so satisfying about turning the incredibly difficult game on its own head and beating it."
truegaming,3d0i3o,giantmonkey2,9,Sun Jul 19 07:36:09 2015 UTC,"A good number of the Kingdom Hearts games lower the requitements for accessing bonus scenes for completing the game at a higher difficulty. I consider this a good system.  For example, playing on Beginner would force you to effectively 100% the game to see those post-credit extra scenes, but playing on Critical (Expert/Very Hard) may only require the completion of the main story."
truegaming,3d0i3o,radios_appear,12,Sun Jul 12 16:05:10 2015 UTC,"Shovel Knight has a cool mechanic that integrates itself very smoothly into the gameplay. There are checkpoints that light up as you pass them, and if you die you respawn at the most recent one. But if you hit them a couple times with your shovel, they shatter and give you valuable gems instead. So at any given checkpoint, you get to decide how much you value the immediate reward compared to the cost of possibly redoing the preceding section.  Here's an article from the developers about how they designed the checkpoint system."
truegaming,3d0i3o,teraflop,4,Sun Jul 12 21:40:01 2015 UTC,"God Hand is almost always my go-to when talking about difficulty.  There are essentially two different types of difficulty: the one that you choose at the start of the game, and a dynamic one that changes as you go.  Normally, the better you play, the harder the game gets.  Enemies get smarter and more aggressive, aggroing from further away and attacking from off-screen, as well as doing more damage.  This dynamic difficulty goes from levels 1-4, and as you land hits it goes up, and as you take damage it goes down.  At the end of each level, you're given money which you can spend on power ups and new moves based in the number of enemies defeated-- with the amount given multiplied by the difficulty level you were on when you defeated each enemy.  If, at the start of the game you pick easy, then the difficulty modifier can only go up to level 2, and if you pick hard then the difficulty is locked into level 4.  You're rewarded for playing better, but unless it's a self-challenge or a self-imposed handicap, you don't actually need to play on higher difficulties for better rewards."
truegaming,3d0i3o,Ricepilaf,2,Sun Jul 12 18:14:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I loved it, even though it was frustrating as hell. Many like me were good enough that easy/medium was a cakewalk, but this simply meant the game would keep bumping the challenge up to the highest difficulty, where we'd get our asses kicked and the game would drop back down to medium. Another enemy or two later and it'd ramp back up. Rinse, repeat. It was really annoying, I couldn't enjoy the game because as soon as I laid down a satisfying beatdown on one enemy the game would screw me over in the next fight. Repeatedly."
truegaming,3d0i3o,dankisms,5,Mon Jul 13 02:18:36 2015 UTC,"Perfect Dark (N64) was the last game that pushed me to complete it on all difficulty settings and most of the challenges. There were ""cheats"" you could unlock, like ""Unlimited Ammo No Reloads"" for completing a certain stage at a certain difficulty in a certain amount of time. You had to have truly perfect timing to accomplish some of these tasks, and the reward was far more fulfilling than if they had just included some passcodes to unlock the cheats, and way more rewarding than ""achievements"" or ""trophies"". Also, considering each level was objective based, the lower difficulties required you to complete fewer objectives, making the game much easier to get through in a hurry. I really hate the idea that it is accepted these days to just add more health and strength to the enemies, and add more of them in order to create these harder modes. I'd love to see some of the old ""cheats"" come back, too. The silly stuff, like Paintball mode, Big Head mode, One Hit Kills and the like. I'd probably play through every inch of Batman if I could unlock some crazy cheats, and then I'd probably storm through that game again from time to time months or years later."
truegaming,3d0i3o,infinitree,3,Sun Jul 12 18:21:09 2015 UTC,Nice! I was about to say Goldenye/Perfect Dark had a pretty good incentive for trying out the higher difficulties with it's timed runs and cheats.
truegaming,3d0i3o,crackshot87,45,Mon Jul 13 09:02:41 2015 UTC,"Any game where the ""true/good"" ending is only achievable on a higher difficulty. Looking at you, Fear Effect.   I personally don't think gameplay should be altered through rewards at higher difficulties. Imagine a first person shooter where you get earlier access to more powerful weapons if you play on harder difficulties. What's the point of them being harder then?  Same deal with RPGs giving more XP or better drops. Harder difficulties should be just that. Harder."
truegaming,3d0i3o,wristcontrol,34,Sun Jul 12 14:28:57 2015 UTC,"Harder difficulties should be just that. Harder.    I don't necessarily agree because I feel like you need to have a way to motivate the audience. As humans we tend to favor the path of least resistance, so if you're presented with 2 paths within a game that offer the exact same rewards but one is simply more difficulty, which do you think the majority of people will choose?  With that in mind, it makes perfect sense as to why you would include exclusive content on games at a harder difficulty. Not only does it encourage more players to engage in that content, but it gives them a tangible reward for doing so.  It's no different than adding rewards for finding collectibles or getting all the trophies (Looking at you Arkham Knight)  Now, why would developers want to do that? The popular theory is that it just has to do with artificially extending the game's length. By adding things like higher difficulties or time consuming objectives to 100% a game, you're adding time to a person's enjoyment, which for some translates to value."
truegaming,3d0i3o,NK1337,34,Sun Jul 12 14:42:06 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of an interesting talk on the game design of Diablo 3 that a blizzard employee gave. One interesting point was that players will tend towards the ""winning"" strategy even when they know other strategies are more fun. There was a bug in the spell casting that made it possible to spam either one or two spells very quickly, which gave notably higher dps than tossing in some other spells. It wasn't fun, and they knew it, but because it did the most damage it was widely used during play testing at that phase of development.  All this to say yes, I agree that adding incentives for players to challenge themselves is necessary. Anecdotally I can tell you I wouldn't have tried expert mode in Terraria 1.3 if not for the unique/higher drops and new boss mechanics."

It can make the story seem cheap when it only gives you the ""true"" ending when you do the same thing only harder.   I feel like the story should be kept an ""essential"" part of the experience that any player can access regardless of skill level, and make other tangential things part of the incentive."
truegaming,3d0i3o,AdrianBrony,5,Sun Jul 12 19:25:49 2015 UTC,"It's a weird issue for me that games even have a ""true"" ending. It seems like such a blatant attempt at extending the life of a game. I remember Kirby and the crystal shards did this with having to collect all the shards to unlock the real boss battle, which in turn gave you a better ending. Back then I thought t was cool because it gave me something more to get out of the game, but looking back on it it seems kind of cheap?"
truegaming,3d0i3o,NK1337,3,Sun Jul 12 19:48:15 2015 UTC,"Crystal shards at least makes some sense I guess? like I agree with our point but like, to get the full story you have to collect the shards which have story significance, and it does lead you to doing more stuff to finish the story. It's not ideal but it's definitely better than ""if you beat the game on hard mode instead then even if you did nothing different otherwise, the ending cinematic is different."""

truegaming,3d0i3o,SuperKirbyFan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:03:40 2015 UTC,"For me at least it depends greatly on how the difficulty is increased.  I cannot stand health and damage scaling to raise difficulty.  Skyrim being one of the worse offenders of this... to the point that master difficulty isn't even fun or inline with game balance at all.  However if the mechanics or a.i. are changed or made more complex then I don't mind no bonuses. The reward is that I get a 'fair' increase in challenge that doesn't defer from what I was playing at lower difficulties.   If Black Knight gets KO'd in 7 hits in normal, it should be 7 in nightmare too.  If you up it to 21 hits, then it's the same execution test for longer... how is that more compelling?   There is an objective range for an appropriate length of engagement.  That range is where the consensus of fun is, to amplify past that makes it a slog.  All this said, I know that requires a lot more work... and that's one of the reasons I prefer games to have one difficulty setting that's very well done."
truegaming,3d0i3o,SUNCASTLE,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:47:44 2015 UTC,"Very good points. My favorite implementation of difficulty scaling is one where you have to pay closer attention to the mechanics of the game. A good (but not perfect) example is witcher 1 and 2, where you can get through the game by just swinging your sword. But as you progress in difficulty things like alchemy, signs and oils become nearly essential. The downside however is that the flame still followed the health/dmg multiplier, which in their defense I think you need to do at least on some scale to account for new player tactics."
truegaming,3d0i3o,NK1337,-20,Tue Jul 14 15:10:00 2015 UTC,"To answer your first point, most people will obviously choose the easier path, and that's because most people are weak.  I've been a gamer since the NES days, where shit was hard, and you got bragging rights if you completed games, because finishing them was not a given. This famous comic perfectly sums up my mindset when it comes to the current state of gaming as a medium.  If you want to give people incentives for playing at higher difficulties (which, keep in mind, for me is an incentive in and of itself) then you could have something like Starcraft, where completing single-player challenges opens up cosmetic multiplayer rewards.  Or maybe something à la Metal Gear Solid or Resident Evil, where completing the game nets you a New Game + with a special weapon or a gamebreaking item.  At the end of the day, scaling difficulty levels are there to tailor the experience to your liking. If you're like me, you like a challenge, you want the game to be punishing and you don't want your hand held, then you will play on the higher difficulties regardless of what is offered.  Conversely, if you're the kind of person who dislikes a harder challenge, then locking rewards behind a higher difficulty level effectively excludes those players from experiencing all of the content the game has to offer."

It has nothing to do with weakness, and everything to do with actual enjoyment. Shit wasn't hard in NES days, it was just poorly designed. The video game medium was just starting so we didn't have any concept of what was good game design, people were testing the waters and we were just along for the ride. Also considering how much of a niche hobby video games were, I don't buy the ""bragging rights"" argument as a form of reward. Who were you going to brag to? If anything recent developments in gaming culture as well as their more widespread acceptance are more conducive to those bragging rights, especially with the advent of online leaderboards, achievements, prestige ranks, etc.     We've seen plenty of quality of life improvements since the early days of gaming that have been for the better.    That aside, we seem to be on the same page in regards to providing the player incentives to go on to harder difficulties, you're just citing different examples of the same concept. Also I do agree that scaling difficulties are there to help tailor the experience for players, but again, I also feel like they're there to artificially lengthen the game which is why developers include incentives to get more players to actually engage in that content."

Which absolutely killed any reason to play any difficulty above Easy - coincidentally, it also ruined a large part of the gameplay. In Tales games, the lower difficulties could be beat simply by spamming basic attacks and without really needing to understand how the battle system works for that particular Tales title. This is also why most fans of the game play them at higher difficulties, it allows the various nuances to shine through. Combos, linking, timing (TP usage vs recovery, CC regen), elemental weaknesses, etc. At easy difficulty you could get by with just mashing the basic attack button."

The more enemies you kill without resting at a shrine and replenishing your potions, the more XP you earned per kill.

truegaming,3d0i3o,Ensvey,3,Sun Jul 12 18:56:11 2015 UTC,"The thing with Dark Souls though (and many other games for that matter, just not many RPG's it seems) is that it lets you get right back into the game after you die. You get killed, you respawn at a bonfire. No loading the game and waiting a few minutes while it loads. IIRC, Dark 1 and 2 both never took more than a few seconds to load on my xbox. Compare that to Skyrim's or even Assassin's Creed's load times and you see where the difference lies. Much easier and less frustrating games, but if you have long periods of just waiting before you're able to get back into the game you're more likely to put it down. And for pc players, TES has the added risk of losing hours of progress because you got careless or too into the game and forgot to save.  Hell, I'd say The Witcher III is an even worse offender for having the unskippable scene every time you load a game. It doesn't matter if the game has finished loading, you have to watch the entire cutscene. Sure, it doesn't do it if you load from a death, but what if that thing goes wrong with the Baron?

Many people who fit this description would probably call it good game design, as special rewards validate this kind of thinking.

truegaming,3d0i3o,Magner3100,3,Mon Jul 13 06:14:33 2015 UTC,"The one thing I hate is when a game's difficulty only really changes the monsters health, damage, and damage you receive (or the AI will just cheat more). This leads combat taking longer than it really should, which creates the illusion of difficulty as something that takes a long time should be a big time investment. But if the mechanics are bad, or ""easy,"" then it is only making the game arbitrarily hard, rather than actually being rewarding difficult. The Witcher 3, most shooters, and EA sports games fall into this category. Often you can get away doing the same thing, but just taking a much longer time to do it for little to no reward.  True difficulty settings should force the player to change the way they play the game between different settings, what worked in easy should not work on hard (and so on). Coupled with extra rewards as Terraria does is also a bonus for the player and leads to a greater sense of risk reward to a player mastering skills needed to accomplish said task.  That being said, often times it is RPG games that reward players on harder difficulties with actually forcing them to use strategy to what would otherwise be a mindless button mashing experience. And a good example (and I understand it is not a traditional ""hard mode"" but self imposed difficulty settings count in my book) would be self imposed handicaps, say in the Final Fantasy series. FF10 had no sphere grid which forced the player to use wild and often fun mechanics to beat the game. Zelda had skipping heart containers, FF7 had no materia, and (as another different example) Dead Space had pistol (cutter or what have you) only.  I wish more games rewarded players with something a little extra for playing on harder difficulty, but I can recall a large amount of protest against ""missing out on content"" that often leads many developers to skip this. Furthermore, the time and resources needed to make these added bonuses can often be more than a developer is willing to spend to create something a fraction of the players would ever see. It is much easier for games like Terraria, The World Ends with You, and the Diablo (and clones) of the world to change numbers than it is to create special content.  So to answer your question, it is good game design if your game is already designed well. If your game has flawed or poor mechanics that would only become arbitrarily harder by having a higher difficulty, then yes it is bad game design.  And then there is Dark Souls, which is already ""difficult"" and rewarding for any player that takes the time to learn the games mechanics. A (in my opinion) perfect balance between good mechanics complimenting a higher difficulty level than most are used to experiencing.   Cheers"
truegaming,3d0i3o,db_mew,3,Sun Jul 12 21:22:13 2015 UTC,"Isn't the point of the difficulty settings to allow everyone to experience the game through a level of challenge they're comfortable with?  Although, if you start off at easy and love the game and keep practicing, and end up beating it on the hardest difficulty, finding that there's some extra content, I bet that will feel pretty awesome."
truegaming,3d0i3o,parad0xchild,2,Mon Jul 13 06:56:54 2015 UTC,"When you have items that scale up with difficulty they usually don't balance out to be the same difficulty as before. There are multiple facets of difficulty, and items or incentives usually only account for a limited number of them, as well as some just can't be overcome by loot, and only by skill.   On top of that, unlocked difficulties can be great to explore more advanced and skillful mechanics that take time (perhaps a playthrough) to learn and feel comfortable with, on top of all the other game mechanics. This helps create a new and continued experience in a game, without having to create more content overall (which could comprise overall story and game, trying to cram in too many features can be the death of a good story)."
truegaming,3d0i3o,shane71998,2,Sun Jul 12 16:43:27 2015 UTC,"I think it's great game design, and it's something that I would like to see a lot more of in the future. I think it works well in tandem with the concept that the more the challenge, the more gratifying the experience for the player. So the way I see it, why not make it even more gratifying? It certainly doesn't hurt as far as I can see."
truegaming,3d0i3o,chuiu,2,Sun Jul 12 17:07:11 2015 UTC,"I agree about the risk reward concept and a lot of games, RPGs especially, do this with side paths that you don't need to go down but have items and extra enemies at the end.  Personally I think its cool to give the player the option to make things more difficult for themselves.  Like in Risk of Rain there are a set of artifacts.  Some have positive effects, some negative, some are a tradeoff.  Most people don't play with the negative ones because all they do is make the game harder.  But I find it fun to play with the Spite artifact because it adds another layer of danger to fighting certain enemies.  Spite makes it so enemies drop bombs on death that only damage you.  Certain enemies die in an explosion of bombs that fly everywhere."
truegaming,3d0i3o,DragonDai,2,Sun Jul 12 21:37:12 2015 UTC,"I think that rewarding players who can master more challenging content is a great way to get players to leave their comfort zone and try something new.   This is both a win for the player as well as for the developer. The player wins because, at least as far as I'm concerned, games are more fun when they are actually challenging. Beating up some push-over just doesn't feel very satisfying. On the other hand, finally defeating that boss that's been giving you trouble for the last hour is really, really satisfying. And from the dev side of things, higher difficulty = more engagement time. And that's unequivocally good.   There are two traps, however, that can ruin an otherwise awesome game that go along with this. The first is the difficulty spike. Basically, if you're playing a game and suddenly you hit a wall, you might bash your head against it for a while, but eventually the majority of people will just give up. There's nothing wrong with challenge, it just has to be consistent, reliable, and fair. And usually when you hit one of those difficulty spikes it's either because something was explained poorly/not at all, or the game has stopped being consistent, reliable, and fair.   The other trap, and, IMO, this one is a much bigger sin, is punishing easier difficulties. This often goes hand in hand with rewarding harder difficulties, and it always leads to a game that is less good than it could have been.   It's fine to give the players who triumph over the truly challenging content more, but it's not okay to give the players who want to play on the easier difficulty less. 'Easy' shouldn't feature less content. The final act or last boss shouldn't be locked away behind 'Hard' difficulty. The whole game and everything it has to offer should be available to everyone who buys your product, regardless of skill or desire. It's fine to give someone playing on a higher difficulty more exp or more loot or even better loot. But when you start locking parts of your game away behind difficulty, some of your player base is gana have a bad time. And there's just no good reason for that."

truegaming,3d0i3o,internet_observer,2,Mon Jul 13 01:19:35 2015 UTC,"Bad design if it is story related. Games are single player experiences. Having a difficulty select allows the person to select what they want for their maximum enjoyment. I don't like the idea of punishing someone because they are ""enjoying things wrong"" by playing on a lower difficulty. If someone wants to play a game on a harder difficulty it should be because they think they will have fun doing it, not because there is an extra 30s of cutscene.  If you want to give cosmetics or something like that then it is fine."

But then you completed the hardest difficulty and got the surprise positive ending... It was a great moment. By that time you've been invested in the game, so the sudden, unexpected positive emotions hit you even stronger. I haven't seen any other game since that would do this so well.

Deus Ex is another example.  The higher difficulties outline specific ways in which the game becomes more difficult, but it's not because of a change in the AI.  It's a change in the player, the resources available, and the requirements for successful level completion.  Being able to rise to those challenges is it's own reward.  And of course, the skins/visual filters/trophies/achievements that could be added as an incentive (like the Uncharted series bonuses) aren't so huge that they dishearten players who don't have to skill to obtain them."

I'm very competitive, I'm aware and acknowledge this (though I'm neither a poor winner or loser) so it bugs me quite a bit that when I accomplish something tough in game on the most difficult modes available, then someone who  breezed through on easy gets the same rewards.  Honestly, video games are probably my best skill, not the most productive skill to have but still a skill that I believe myself to be very good at. And I like this to show while I'm playing with people. This means any exclusivity aspects to harder modes is something I revel in because people get to see that I've done something that's considered difficult in that game. Even if it's something as trivial as a skin. It doesn't aid me in any way, and people who can't accomplish it won't lose out on anything significant but I've still been rewarded"

If you play on Ranger there's no HUD (meaning count your shots and keep track of your ammo), the enemies have better AI, and all characters do more damage and have less health. Essentially this creates a much more immersive and realistic (albeit sometimes frustrating) experience where you have to be much more tactical in how you approach enemies.  If you jump out guns blazing, you will die. It's more punishing, but once you clear an area you feel like you've really accomplished something.  There's no real reason to play on Ranger mode other than that it just feels better. I really enjoy that aspect of these games."
truegaming,3d0i3o,bloodstainer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:25:57 2015 UTC,"I'd say, just like any ""reward"" based system that it depends, but personally I prefer it when games are just designed with perhaps 3 very distinct difficulty levels, like an easy mode with just dumbed down and casualized mechanics, the ""normal"" or ""Hard"" difficulty which is how the game were initially designed to be played, and then a hardcore mode with perma-death.  Because frankly in my opinion, if a game is luring enough people will play it regardless of difficulty and if that kind of things give immersion to players we're much more likely to see something like Skyrim where mods and player interactivity with the game will lead to the best and frankly most suited difficulty-changing systems, because compared to modding, Skyrim's initial difficulty system isn't very good, and that's still an amazing game.  But on the other hand I like it when some games go for a more realistic approach on harder difficulty, its been some time now but I recall the original Far Cry doing something like this. And unless I'm mistaken wasn't it BioShock 2 with different endings... nvm it wasn't BioShock 2, but there was some game with small differentiation in the ending dependent on difficulty settings, it might actually have been StarCraft 2? Anyway, I love easter eggs like that. It wasn't big, more like a small variation in one of the cutscenes.. now I can't remember which game it was, but I think it was an RTS like C&C Generals, or Red Alert.

As someone who has put over 250 hours into the game over multiple specs/characters/difficulties, playing on Hard with Hardcore Mode off is so much easier than Normal, with Hardcore on (though I would recommend Hard + Hardcore, for the true survivalist experience).  When you have Hardcore mode on, you suffer from dehydration, hunger, and fatigue. Previously weightless items, like ammunition, now have to be factored into your carrying capability, and more serious injuries cannot be healed easily in the field. This adds more depth to the gameplay than anything else, and makes the player plan wisely for each trip, often only choosing a select few weapons, pieces of apparel/armour, and consumables. It makes every challenge defeated so much more rewarding, because the player had to plan intricately and learn from many mistakes to be successful.  I understand that many people might not think HC mode was that challenging or unique, but for my playstyle, it changed everything."

Anyway, it's a simple fact, if you work harder you should earn better. Any game that just spoon feeds the player rewards when they didn't put in any real effort makes the game seem pathetic in my opinion. It's why I like the Souls games so much. Even if farming is a goddam pain in the ass, I still look like a badass with the gear I farmed. Put in the effort, get the reward.

truegaming,3d0i3o,substance_dualism,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:00:54 2015 UTC,"If hard mode just means that enemies take more hits to kill and/or you die more easily, then it doesn't make sense to reward the player with better items because it would undermine the nature of the difficulty.  If hard mode means goblins have 50 health instead of 10, you shouldn't give hard mode players a sword of 5x damage.  If the game is more complex on hard mode, then it makes sense to give the player additional tools to apply to those challenges.  If hard mode adds goblin wizards that throw fireballs, it might be fun to give the player a magic shield that can deflect the projectiles back at his enemies.  You could even change certain fights so that player must manage that new mechanic while as well as the mechanics you introduced in easy mode.  In most games, it doesn't really make sense to give the player new tools on hard mode because normal or easy mode is balanced around ""little brothers""--those modes are generally designed to forgive a lot of mistakes so the player doesn't get frustrated and say bad things about the game to his friends, while hard mode exists so that more experienced players won't get bored once they realize their mistakes don't matter and post bad reviews of the game on steam.

Proud mode gets you the bonus ending upon beating the story.. Normal mode requires beating the story and getting 100% codex completion.  A reward for the mechanically skilled, or a reward for those gifted with patience.  I'd apply that to other content as well.  Unlocking classes/items, etc.  I can use.. Dragon Age: Inquisition as an example:  When a recent multiplayer update hit three new classes dropped.  One was given in an intro pack.  Luck based.  Whatever.  Whatever you didn't get you had the option of unlocking utilizing crafting supplies.. 50 cloth, 30 leather, 20 metal, let's say.  This was three or more times the amount of resource other upgrades/unlocks would cost.  Almost prohibitively expensive.  However.  Beating Dragons on the highest difficulty had a fair to high chance of dropping the armor set for the new character (thus unlocking it).  Basically I don't want to see anyone locked out.  Being better at a game doesn't mean the less apt don't deserve 100% of the game.  But cutting hours off the grind of the skilled seems great."

If you want to voluntarily do a harder difficulty because the challenge interests you, by all means, go for it. You shouldn't want to be enticed.  Personally, I think that more games should get rid of difficulty selections, and instead go with a dynamic difficulty that adjusts based on your performance. If you haven't died in a while, the game can crank up the difficulty. If you're dying a lot, it can tone it down. It never even needs to tell the player.  Edit: I find the notion of rewarding better gear or ability boosts for harder difficulties particularly schizophrenic. Isn't the entire point of playing a harder difficulty to be challenged? Playing a hard difficulty should be a handicap, not a reward."

I like to be able to choose a higher difficulty setting simply because I want the game to be more difficult(or ""realistic"" or whatever). Difficulty settings should be balanced to provide an enjoyable experience for players of various skill/experience/etc. levels, and they don't need any incentives or gimmicks beyond that."
truegaming,3d0i3o,ArtKorvalay,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:44:46 2015 UTC,"As you smartly pointed out, a lot of games simply substitute time for skill.  Either beforehand preparing for an encounter, or during the actual encounter because the enemies have twice as much life.    Quantifying 'skill' in a game is hard, and therefore rewarding people for skill is equally hard.  The very definition of skill means that the majority of players will not have it.  Otherwise they would not be 'skilled', they'd be average.    For this reason (and also because I typically lack the aforementioned 'skill' nowadays) I prefer games that don't gate content.  It's not a 'bad' decision per-se, but it is a decision that will cost you a portion of your potential user base."

It gives the edges in the game a slightly feathered look to get rid of that CG Sharpness.   In screenshots it just looks blurry and bad, so it is not really a good way to judge it."
truegaming,3d0suk,BARDLER,24,Sun Jul 12 20:40:20 2015 UTC,"It doesn't blur the entire image, it slightly feathers the edges of the objects in the scene. Over sharpness in CG art can be extremely off putting, and a strain on the eyes."
truegaming,3d0suk,BARDLER,15,Sun Jul 12 21:58:44 2015 UTC,"Not even that. It adds orange/blue or purple/green fringes to high-contrast edges.  I'm not saying it looks good, I think it's kind of weird: when I'm processing my photos I make an effort to remove chromatic aberrations from my photos, because that is what it is: an optical aberration. Photography workflow software (like Lightroom) feature chromatic aberration removal. Photographers spend hundreds/thousands on apochromatic lenses. Meanwhile game devs add it to their games on purpose :P  However it has little to do with 'blurring'."
truegaming,3d0suk,Compizfox,2,Sun Jul 12 22:57:43 2015 UTC,"I understand what it does, but it has a different effect in motion then in a still image. A moving CG image is completely different then a real world photo, and cannot really be compared.  Unless it is completely overdone, the slight color fringing in motion is not noticeable if you are not looking for it. Like I said earlier, those thin colored pixels feather out harsh edges and remove and make it a bit less CG cutout. The biggest reason why you would want to do that is because you don't use depth of field during gameplay, because it can't adjust with what that the player is actually focusing on. In still game screenshots getting rid of CA and adding DoF would make them look 10 times better, but it wouldn't play better at all."

Blurring uniformly coloured plains? And I disagree, and stand by my initial comment.  To me that is like saying ""printing grey on grey and fusing letters with the surrounding paper makes it easier to read"". I REALLY do hate most of the techniques when things are blurred with objects I am supposed or invited to look at. Including but not limited to forced focus in 3D movies, the atrocity they deployed on the N64, motion blur in video games. And it is also why I try to be a stickler for using native resolutions on lcds, including preferring letter-boxing smaller resolutions over interpolation.   I don't need glasses, and I don't need a ""poor eyesight simulator"".  edit: I hope to god that most of the downvoters aren't content creators, and if they are, at the very least consider this crap to be optional. Forget that someone told you that it works better for humans, always.

truegaming,3d0suk,flashman,71,Mon Jul 13 03:10:37 2015 UTC,"Chromatic aberration is something that the art direction part of the game industry is largely still trying to figure out. It's one of those effects that, given one or another advance in shader technology, suddenly became easy to do, and thus it got added to the list of visual tricks that are added to make things seem a little more photorealistic (even if it's not 100% accurate or doesn't quite work the same as in real life).  There are a lot of other examples of similar ""trendy"" effects and tech being used in the past whose use normalized after a few years: * Lens flares * Ambient occlusion * Bloom * HDR * Noise/grain * Motion blur * Depth of field * Glossy normal mapped surfaces * Bump mapping (which was later replaced with normal mapping) * God rays * Dyanmic cloth/jiggle bones * Glowy bits on characters    The prevalence of these effects is driven by artists in the game industry suddenly figuring out how to do something that delivers a lot of visual punch with minimal effort on their part, and they then go completely overboard with it for a couple of years until they really nail how it should look. It's essentially learning the best use case for a given tool.  As for chromatic aberration specifically? Most rendering effects in games and movies are done with the goal of making it look like you're looking at a scene through the lens of a camera. Since chromatic aberration is something you see in a lot of photographs and movies, there's been a bit of an effort to duplicate the effect using post-processing. The problem right now is that we're currently hovering around the peak of the ""this is way overdone and looks like shit"" graph for chromatic aberration, but we're going to be on the down slope soon and then the effect will start to become a bit more nuanced and only used in situations where it makes sense.  This is going to happen with a few other effects and technologies pretty soon. Over the next few years, expect to see lots of use and abuse of things like hair simulation, screen-space reflections, and blobby-looking fluid simulations. We'll probably be seeing realtime ray tracing coming up around 2020-2025, so there will probably be a lot of games released around that time with very  grainy lighting and shadows. After a couple of years and with a better understanding of how realtime ray tracing works with other rendering tech, hybrid rendering solutions will develop and things will start to look good."

truegaming,3d0suk,goocy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:34:42 2015 UTC,"Are you sure about that? Chromatic aberration is caused by prismatic effects. They're normally worst at the edges of the image field (as this is where light goes through the lense at the shallowest  angle,  maximizing the effect). Eyes don't see the problem because we don't have enough resolution anywhere but in the center of the image field (our fovea), where the light enters straightest."
truegaming,3d0suk,WazWaz,2,Mon Jul 13 11:49:00 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure, because every lens with a refractive index other than 1 introduces chromatic aberration. The only way to prevent it is to fuse lenses from different materials and opposite focal lengths together, something that's definitely not happening in our eyes.  Yeah, it's possible that our peripheral resolution isn't that great either, but especially at those extremely wide angles (eyes can see up to 160°) we should see a drastic blue/red halo around edges. We don't, and since everything else is also interpolated, it's safe to assume that CA is removed ""in software"" too."

truegaming,3d0suk,Magrias,2,Mon Jul 13 20:26:52 2015 UTC,Grainy / pixelated edges can appear in raytracing if the number of rays you can compute within reasonable time is limited.
truegaming,3d0suk,Soliloquizing,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:33:40 2015 UTC,"That's just low-resolution reflections then, surely. Although I suppose if you were going to use the raytracing to have reflective light as well... ok I can see how that would work. However, I think we've got a way to go before real-time raytracing is feasible, and I think we're going to be forgoing the light reflection for a while after that, and sticking just with reflections."
truegaming,3d0suk,Magrias,2,Mon Jul 13 11:54:06 2015 UTC,"Actually, no, low quality ray tracing is grainy/pixelated and it's not because of lack of resolution, it's due to lack of processing power to cast enough rays.  In ray tracing, each intersection with geometry can potentially spawn hundreds (or thousands) of additional rays: one to every light source in the scene, reflection, refraction, etc. Because it's prohibitively expensive to approach this breadth first (in one sense it's impossible because you're doing an infinite integral across a hemisphere), a common approach is ""path tracing"" where you randomly select one of the possible rays and trace it, then repeat that process until you terminate and return to the camera pixel and cast another path out. Since you're randomly selecting at each branch, after sufficient iterations it starts tor reasonably approximate what the scene would look like if you could trace every possible ray at a given resolution. But for low values, you end up with the grainy issues the post above seems to be referencing.  Here's a comparison of several levels of detail in a path tracing system."
truegaming,3d0suk,jporch,0,Mon Jul 13 12:15:06 2015 UTC,"To go along with this, the movement toward chromatic abberation, shallow DOF, lens flares, and lens effects seems to come from the ease of access to DSLR cameras in the last few years. Everyone has a camera now, and those cameras have these similar flaws that have become popular in visual culture since 2010. Heck, watch some sporting event motion graphics and count the lens flares."
truegaming,3d0suk,Norsak,2,Mon Jul 13 12:21:30 2015 UTC,Depends on the lens. Good modern lenses (say sigma 50mm f1.4 art) have little chromatic abberation and lens flairs are increasingly controled.

One thing that games have never attempted yet, to my knowledge, is simulating light bursts for people who have astigmatism. I have astigmatism and one prevalent feature is that light sources appear as a starburst. I am constantly pulled out of realistic settings because there isn't a light burst from lamps or candles or other light sources. For stylized games and less graphically intense games, it's fine and doesn't bother me.

I'm making a game where you use a piece of command-line software that runs on a vector monitor (it takes place in an alternate history version of 1992 because vector monitors don't work nearly as well as the one in the game does). I wanted this effect in my game because I wanted RGB color separation, as though the mechanical components that are drawing the vector lines became misaligned, like the crappy rear-projection TV my dad bought super cheap when I was in high school.  I didn't know until today that it's an effect that is modeled after a thing that actual cameras do or whatever. I always really liked the effect in the context of computer graphics, though. I specifically remember playing F.E.A.R. 2 and getting to the part where you get into the exo-suit thing, and I think when you got hurt or something, the RGB channels would separate out, and I thought it looked super rad. Getting hit so hard that the color channels of your suit's display doesn't make a lot of sense, but it did a great job of conveying ""You just got hit and also hey remember how you're in a damn exo-suit thing? That's still cool, by the way, just thought I'd remind you.""  I was trying to figure out why Unity's chromatic aberration effect didn't ""look quite right"", and then I read a bit about how it looks sort of green and red instead of the red, green, and blue that I was more going for. Apparently it's supposed to mimic how some cameras work, or maybe how your eyes work? I dunno.  Either way, I like the effect, but I agree that it sure seems like right now a lot of games like to kind of overuse it.

truegaming,3d0suk,branewalker,3,Mon Jul 13 08:29:29 2015 UTC,"This was my first thought when I saw the GTA screenshot, it looks very similar to sub-pixel rendered text. Then I remembered that you can't really do sub-pixel rendering with a simple texture. However it may be that they're using chromatic aberration to try to get a similar effect of softer edges and less obvious aliasing artifacts."
truegaming,3d0suk,Kered13,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:36:18 2015 UTC,"The other screenshots are using a spread significantly greater than a pixel, or they're photos of a computer screen (which wouldn't display true sub-pixel rendering) so it's safe to say that's not the case.  But I do wonder; it seems like sub-pixel rendering would be possible on high-contrast edges, which is where anti-aliasing is already focused."

In regards to your last point, I think the ideal way to look for video games is out of the realm of both eyesight and camera, but rather taking the best aspects from each and applying them to the setting as they suit it."

truegaming,3d0suk,qsterino,0,Mon Jul 13 07:00:19 2015 UTC,"You mean chromatic abomination?  But seriously, I think it works in Alien Isolation and adds to the look of the game. On the other hand I cannot even begin to fathom why it was added to Bloodborne.  It's like anything, too much of it used too generously and it loses its intended effect.  If only a few games used extremely limited colour palettes (think the brown/grey era) then that could set them apart (see Limbo) but when it became extremely popular it became incredibly boring and people started to beg for a bit of colour in their games. Likewise with lens flare, it could have been an interesting technique if it were used more sparingly (or at least a little more imaginatively like in Bioshock Infinite) but, instead, it's just annoying."
truegaming,3d0suk,ToastedFishSandwich,0,Mon Jul 13 16:24:17 2015 UTC,"I think chromatic aberration has its uses for conveying certain moods, particularly as an indicator of damage or that something's otherwise very wrong. But as a stock effect to make a game look more ""realistic"", I think it has no place and is more often than not distracting and annoying. Like all things, it's a tool that can be used to great effect in certain contexts, but ends up getting a bad reputation when it's plastered over everything with no regard to aesthetics or subtlety."

truegaming,3cxntt,Tanaka_Broke_MyHeart,55,Sat Jul 11 18:25:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with you to an extent. Usually games with realistic visuals ARE going for a more realistic, immersive experience. Stuff like that is a really big breaker that just screams ""I'm in a video game.""  I also agree with the fact that in less realistic art styles it's more tolerable. There's enough suspension of disbelief that you can just sorta accept the world is laid out like this because it's a different universe than ours.  To contribute something to the conversation, let's talk about pseudo-realistic games, that also incorporate their own type of style. Like games in a futuristic setting, or something like Half Life 2."
truegaming,3cxntt,badgraphix,42,Sat Jul 11 18:34:49 2015 UTC,"In Half Life 2 the sea-saw puzzles (and anything else meant for showing off the engine) kinda took me out a bit, but I liked the moments where it felt like I was improvising instead of solving a puzzle. For example, the don't touch the sand part, where you just had to pick up any object that was lying around, and use it to cross gaps. That was cool."
truegaming,3cxntt,scrubnpuff,26,Sat Jul 11 22:39:06 2015 UTC,"That's one of the reasons HL2 stands out to so many people.  Other games have done it as well, but not the majority anymore.  In my opinion, some of the best game design is when the designers set up an obstacle with multiple solutions.  Games have been around long enough that they tend to fall into patterns, and a hardcore gamer can commonly recognize those patterns even without being very familiar with the specific game.  Giving the player more tools than necessary and letting them solve it however they want gives the player a much higher sense of accomplishment.  That's why things like Minecraft and PoE are successful; they scratch that itch.  There are a ton of issues this can lead to, though, and it's not appropriate for every genre."
truegaming,3cxntt,Ihadanapostrophe,15,Sat Jul 11 23:08:51 2015 UTC,"Replaying HL2, one of the things I realized is that a lot of the game play is really frustrating. Trying to move through the city on the speedboat. Fighting antlions. Stopping every fifty yards to handle those goddamn ceiling things. Sneaking past Combine forces. A very sizable portion of the game is grating and irritating.  However, this acts almost like conditioning. The feeling you get after getting a machine gun for your speedboat, ready to ruin that copter's day, or when you finally have the might of the antlions at your back, or when the gravity gun gets maxed out.  Most 'Modern shooters' would just start you off with the maxed out gravity gun, the ability to call in the antlions to swarm Combine soldiers, and start off by dropping you into the middle of the helocopter fight. Without making you work for it, the payoff doesn't mean much, but that helicopter/speedboat duel made me feel like more of a badass than all the great moments of the CoD games combined.  (Ok, that's not fair, Big Red One was pretty good, but the recent games)  It makes replaying the game irritating, because you end up with lots of little bits that frustrate the hell out of you, and you remember the game being better than it was, but the first time I played HL2, it was glorious."
truegaming,3cxntt,sk_2013,5,Sun Jul 12 01:19:25 2015 UTC,"Funnily enough, some of those irritating parts you mentioned such as the airboat section seemed to be long and tedious on the first playthrough, but when I played it again, seemed to fly by quickly. I'm not sure whether I'm now better at the game, or that I now know what's coming, but it definitely does seem to weaken the grand moments to some extent.   When I originally played the part where you climb the facility to reach the machine guns, I was going on 20 health and barely made it out alive. It made the final battle with the helicopter glorious as I could finally wreak havoc on that sucker. When I replayed it, I was doing much better, so the payoff just wasn't as satisfying."
truegaming,3cxntt,quamfatuuses,3,Sun Jul 12 03:15:19 2015 UTC,"I think the concept is pretty much the same though. The first playthrough punishes the player pretty hard, both in terms of survivability and frustration, so when the game finally lets you off the leash, it's glorious.  I remember reading somewhere that the idea behind a lot of the major enemies was to introduce the player to them, make the player fear the enemy (the antlion sections did this rather well, I think), then make them respect the enemy, then finally giving the player power against that enemy.   They talked specifically about the anltion ""don't walk on sand"" and the ""fuck up the helo"" sections, but it's a pattern repeated pretty consistently throughout the game."

truegaming,3cxntt,TheBigBadPanda,37,Sun Jul 12 11:39:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think the problem is the art style, but just the way the puzzles are (not) integrated into the levels. In TR it is far to obvious that you are in a special puzzle room. Those rooms are cut off from the rest of the level and serve no other purpose then to hold the puzzle. That's just bad game design. In TR:Anniversary or TR:Legend by contrast puzzles are just a part of a level, you have to go from A to B and to do that you have to solve some puzzle in between, but there is no clear cut where the puzzle starts and the level stops.   Same with Zelda or Darksiders, the puzzle there are just better integrated into the whole game. The puzzle can often be quite unrealistic, but since the whole game works by those unrealistic rules it's self consistent again. TR lacks that consistency when it comes to puzzles and the puzzles are essentially disconnected from the main plot."
truegaming,3cxntt,grumbel,17,Sat Jul 11 20:34:47 2015 UTC,"I always though prince of Persia warrior within handled this very well. The puzzles were intricate but modular in that you often had to return to the same area and use different parts of the puzzle to progress. This partial use led to more critical analysis of the environment because you could never tell if a particular section was going to lead to a different area later, a secret now, or simply couldn't be accessed or solved yet due to a missing mechanic.   I really liked that game come to think of it. I may replay it. The combat, world, and puzzles were fantastic."
truegaming,3cxntt,Genlsis,2,Sat Jul 11 23:09:26 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love the PoP series, and I love when AC mixes in some similar puzzles here and there. My only issue is the lack of diversity; though they make each puzzle more difficult as you progress, the difficulty comes usually in having the puzzle take longer.  In AC, the immersion is broken a little because we're supposed to believe we're dealing with mostly-human characters; in PoP, you know the character is pretty magical, and the only human things about him are that he looks like one and gravity kind of happens to him sometimes.  Then again, AC is kind of a meta-game. The Animus basically means you are invincible, so the fear of death is absent; however, who designed the puzzles that supposedly exist?"

Oh a strange set of objects if i get closer my journal will pop up telling me how to solve the puzzle... oh a narrow path i guess ill get to hold one direction and tap the action button a few times
truegaming,3cxntt,fudnip,4,Sat Jul 11 21:28:43 2015 UTC,"Assassin's Creed is somewhat similar with its out-of-place windows and convienent cracks that make climbing a building seem less like parkour and more like connect the dots. The first couple of games weren't as bad about this, perhaps because the architecture of the area the games were set in had more frivolous decorations that looked climbable."
truegaming,3cxntt,LiveOnSteak,2,Sat Jul 11 22:44:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly, that kind of makes me think a bit of the issue with cover based shooters.  If a room isn't littered with chest-high walls, I know I'm not in danger, so I don't pay much attention to my surroundings. If I see such a 'fight area' though, I immediately start setting up for a fight.  Good CBShooters will periodically dump you in the middle of (for example) an officebuilding or park or other place with non-obvious cover (or no cover at all) and say ""Here ya go kid. Go nuts."" while you struggle to keep all your various bits from falling off."
truegaming,3cxntt,sk_2013,0,Sun Jul 12 01:22:21 2015 UTC,"Ding ding ding.  Puzzles of the type being described by the OP are relics of a time when their obviously unrealistic qualities were obscured by inferior technology.  They haven't aged well because they've only gotten more realistic looking, not more interesting.  There's a sequence in Shadows of the Damned where you have to solve one of those rotating room puzzles where there are a bunch of stair pieces and whatnot.  Knowing full well how ludicrous these types of puzzles are in a high-realism environment, the designers took a light hearted approach of openly acknowledging it and put a literal wooden sign at the entrance to the room which read ""MOOR PU DEKCUF."""

truegaming,3cxntt,dinoseen,7,Sun Jul 12 11:09:58 2015 UTC,"I think that yes, such an obvious puzzle break immersion however it is up to the game's developer/puzzle designer to use obvious solutions as a teaching mechanism. Once you're introduced to the basics of puzzle solving within the game then the puzzles should become more challenging and can be integrated into a realistic environment more... realistically. Although it isn't a realistic game, Portal 2 does a great job of this. You begin in a training room with the majority of puzzles in those rooms being very simple. However, once you move out into the more natural settings of the Aperture facility, the solutions become more hidden and require a significant amount of attention to details. For the most part, the puzzles feel like you're actually navigating through an environment not designed for the portal gun and actually helps to augment the immersion."
truegaming,3cxntt,Amberground,3,Sat Jul 11 22:56:21 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to avoid bringing up portal here, because I really don't feel like it's particularly fair. Portal was designed primarily as a puzzle game (not a puzzle game bolted on to something else), and the portal gun made for an interesting mechanic that they could base most, if not necessarily all, of the puzzles around."
truegaming,3cxntt,sk_2013,2,Sun Jul 12 01:29:20 2015 UTC,That's fair but the way that designers approach a puzzle is what I wanted to hit on. Tomb Raider has plenty of other gameplay however the series does have a 3-D puzzle game as part of its core. It's careless when a game restricts itself. The player is smart enough to learn common objects that can be manipulated and can put together more complex puzzles as they continue through the game.
truegaming,3cxntt,Amberground,6,Sun Jul 12 01:56:43 2015 UTC,"Well yes of course, but at the same time I don't see a problem with it. I much prefer having some ""video-game"" clever kind of puzzles than gameplay trying to represent reality, and at the same time I much prefer having high-def graphics than low poly cartoon rendering stuff in pretty much every games I play. So I really don't care if they mix the styles even if the level setup don't make them seem realistic. Just take The Talos Principle for example, it's a very nicely detailed game in the level design aspect, but at the same time the gameplay is just composed of video game puzzles."
truegaming,3cxntt,Dunge,6,Sat Jul 11 21:11:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I see what you mean. Games going for an extremely realistic feeling to the visuals and gameplay do not make good environments for puzzles of any kind. It's just too jarring seeing an obvious videogame puzzle laid out in realistic looking assets, it just doesn't fit.   Take The Last of Us for example. Even the convenient ladders, floating palette sections, and laying boards across gaps felt extremely out of place. If that had been a less grimy, detailed game that wasn't trying to push a weight of realism, it would've been fine, but it just looked and felt so damn off. And those weren't even really puzzles, but it was still too much."
truegaming,3cxntt,binauralshitsound,8,Sat Jul 11 20:37:40 2015 UTC,And most of those puzzles are ridiculous... why do i need a ladder to go up a 6ft wall when 10 minutes ago i boosted her up over an 8 Ft wall.
truegaming,3cxntt,fudnip,5,Sat Jul 11 21:27:40 2015 UTC,"I think it's more of a case of the obvious puzzles. Puzzles really haven't gotten much more clever as games have developed. I'm not against puzzles in games, but a good puzzle shouldn't feel like a puzzle.   For lack of a better way of putting it, it should feel like you outsmarted the devs and pulled something out of your ass that worked.  Too many games feel like they start with the environment, make their pretty worlds and skyboxes and whatnot, and then work out how to get around, and then add puzzles on top of that, so it looks like what it is- a big puzzle shaped roadblock keeping you from using your tank to murderstomp those alien bastards over there."
truegaming,3cxntt,sk_2013,6,Sun Jul 12 01:26:28 2015 UTC,"I also struggle with the fact that there's only one solution to the puzzles, when in real life, there could be any number of ways to advance from point A to point B. Especially in situations like the one you mentioned. There are more ways than putting a a specific board in a specific place to cross a gap.  If a game doesn't try to imitate real life, the premise that there is one solution to each problem is more acceptable."
truegaming,3cxntt,BeriAlpha,3,Sat Jul 11 20:59:18 2015 UTC,"A realistic style can definitely make puzzles more annoying to deal with. Soul Reaver comes to mind - there were a few rooms in the game that were simple sliding-block puzzles, but you had to walk over to the right side of the block, slowly draaaaag it over, climb over it to get to another block, draaaaaag that one...  From the moment I realize the solution to the moment I can move on, that chunk of time is wasted time. That's what often makes Portal work so well: usually, the puzzles take a long time to think through, but once you realize the solution you can catapult yourself through it in a matter of seconds."
truegaming,3cxntt,WiremanC3,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:06:56 2015 UTC,"I would agree with your points mostly in a game that does not specifically focus on puzzles. Games like Skyrim or Tomb Raider fail to maintain the immersion because they are action games with puzzle elements shoehorned in. If you try realMyst:Masterpiece Edition, you will find that the puzzles fit well with the realistic graphics because the game is created around puzzles and the visual elements of the game are imprtant to each and every puzzle."
truegaming,3cy005,gianttabby,60,Sat Jul 11 20:10:43 2015 UTC,"I think you're overestimating the popularity of the majority of indie titles. Most go unnoticed by the majority of the gaming community. AAA games are the only type(?) of game that has major advertising pumped into their development. Even so, there's a huge over-saturation within gaming advertising and big titles are constantly fighting over the public's attention. This leads to bigger and more innovative advertising campaigns that expand beyond the targeted market for the game. Companies invest this much money and energy into marketing because of the huge amount of money already invested in the game's development. More so than even the movie industry, game developers hurt when their products don't sell. AA and indie games do not have as large of an initial investment so putting a portion of that principle or investing even more into advertising actually results in a smaller profit margin and creates a riskier situation in an already risky industry.

But as a percentage of total games made, you've heard about a lot less indie games than AA games.  As an example, let's make up some numbers.  Let's say last year 100 AA games were released by semilarge publishers, and you've heard of 20 of them.  In the same period, 10000 indie games were released by various people and you've heard of 80 of them.

AA games like Paradox titles or the Crusader Kings series can't afford major marketing campaigns and thus require an established fan-base to communicate and sell their games.  Once you exclude marketing though, video-game development is actually quite affordable. So you don't need millions of sales.  The same applies to indies. 99% of them go unnoticed too.

truegaming,3cy005,OverKillv7,2,Sun Jul 12 09:06:54 2015 UTC,I was going to post something similar. I think Dark Souls would be considered an AA title if anyone ever used that sort of classification. League of Legends? Hearthstone? Nintendo's titles? Shenmue 3? Some of the biggest games in the world right now might well be AA games.
truegaming,3cy005,Kinglink,2,Mon Jul 13 11:00:36 2015 UTC,"This has been happening for a long time. You are absolutely right and I've seen it reported in a few places including the BBC, and some websites talking about it. You might enjoy reading this article:  http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-03-03-cliffy-b-the-middle-class-game-is-dead    As for why it's happening, in my opinion it is all the fault of the gaming press and the gamers themselves. The hype goes to the big AAA games because they are the big budget flashy games and they also have huge advertising budgets. They are going to be hyped no matter what, and they are going to be popular no matter what, because review scores are paid for and ads are shoved in the face of millions of impressionable people. The gaming press goes from massive game to massive game, Assassins Creed 14 to Call of Duty 9, to Elder Scrolls 8 to Need for Speed 26. Etc.. That makes up the majority of what the gaming press talks about, and the gamers are at fault for this too. But there are gaps in this regular scheduling, and in those gaps the gaming press are free to write a genuine article about a game they haven't been paid to hype, and in these cases they try to pretend that they have some credibility, and the best way to do this is to talk about some tiny indie game and pretend they have eclectic tastes and can really appreciate the gameplay of something made by one guy and how they don't ALWAYS need to have a game with a 50 million dollar graphics budget.   So it's all about the big games and the little games. Everything in between is not interesting enough to talk about. I think it is only the truly hardcore gamers that are interested in these games. Games like X3, Take on Helicopters, Age of Wonders 3, Crusader Kings, etc..etc.. They are the middle class games, they don't get huge hype and they aren't an indie darling. They have some very loyal fans, you just rarely see them talking about it on mainstream websites, you have to visit their specific forums. It is pretty sad. But gaming as a whole hobby is getting bigger and bigger each year, so in time this middle ground will be big enough to support some really big games, big companies, and big audiences."
truegaming,3cy005,piddlystains,3,Thu Jul 16 00:12:17 2015 UTC,"What exactly would you consider a AA game? A game from a major developer that's not photorealistic in style? A high budget Japanese game?  It's more to do with the aesthetic, I really feel. Games that are Japanese or cater to Japanese audiences just simply don't cater to the average Western gamer. Sure, gameplay may be similar, but there's a general xenophobia. This is where Nintendo gets it right. Most of its franchises, even when Japanese in origin, don't feel that Japanese or foreign. In comparison, Danganronpa and Neptunia just feel really Japanese or anime-ish, which many have a general aversion to due to the impression of anime in Western cultures."
truegaming,3cy005,Kinglink,2,Sun Jul 12 01:42:27 2015 UTC,"I feel things like Child of Light and Grow Home are examples of AA games made by Ubisoft. I generally dislike Ubisoft's AAA games but very much enjoyed both of those, and they got very little attention in comparison."
truegaming,3cy005,piddlystains,0,Mon Jul 13 14:40:05 2015 UTC,"By AA I meant the size, scope, and budget of a project. Preference for aesthetics have nothing to do with it.  I thought that was obvious, given that I mentioned big and small?"
truegaming,3cy005,Kinglink,6,Sun Jul 12 02:01:56 2015 UTC,Considering AAA isn't defined at all for this industry.  AA is also not defined.   So perhaps you need to define both of then if you want to use them to quantify the market
truegaming,3cy005,attackzac21,2,Sun Jul 12 04:21:53 2015 UTC,"I feel this can't be overstated. Aside from being a big production, AAA is vague at best. I sort of always understood it as talking about the quality as well. We don't tend to talk about shitty AAA games even though big, shitty productions exist and are talked about. It seems like a buzzword that has big connotations but little meaning.  I never heard of AA before this. So what's the scale? AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, etc.?   It strikes me as Hollywood envy that video games started to develop in the 90s. You have A-list actors, blockbusters are informally the ""A"" movies. We all gave a general idea of what a B-movie is. Within B-movies there's the informal C and Z designations -- C movies being the sort of thing that's shot on a shitty tape camera, Z movies being just a designation of overall quality. I always figured triple A titles sort of came out of that scheme."

AA games aren't really talked about because they don't really get ""headlines"".

I see people complaining in every fucking thread of SC in /r/games. They do not get a pass, no matter if the complainers are right, cynic or ill-informed, they are there, and they are persistent. If it isn't the sale of ships, it's about dev time or it's about some employee turnover or any other outrage/panic you can come up with, 50% of SC threads are heat, much to my dismay as I like talking about it without it boiling down to Chris Roberts getting called scammer and people who follow the development idiots and fanboys.  The Star Marine video thread is the one thread in a while that had some decent talk and even that had two or three idiots complaining about dev time, development openess and ship sales, even though it was a perfect opportunity to talk about a damn video with gameplay (or animation, as was the main topic of discussion in that thread)."
truegaming,3cz49y,emmanuelvr,2,Sun Jul 12 03:06:34 2015 UTC,do you have a response to /u/OrsikIronfist's comment below /u/Emnight?
truegaming,3cz49y,crushedbycookie,8,Sun Jul 12 03:29:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, if I were to add anything to that post, donating isn't the correct word, backing is.   I don't want to get too deep into the philosphy behind crowdfunding, but it's a new model somewhere between donating (an initiative of good will knowing that it will be what will be), investing (the money WILL be used for development, not as profit) and some weird form of pre-ordering (you do expect the reward to the best of their abilities and not to get fucked in the ass dishonestly, whatever the product ends up being like, they gave their best), with the key word that tends to be used being 'backed' or 'kickstarted'.   And as such, the sales come from the idea of having people get a reward that would previously be out of their reach (backer) to raise further funds for the game (dev). It's not a sale for profit, it's a sale for the crowdfund. The comparison with EA/Ubisoft etc is out of place because these DLC pracitices are done for-profit, whereas the driving force behind SC is crowdfunding top to bottom, and unless information comes to light Chris Roberts is buying a yacht with the money, I think it is safe to assume the best: that money is to pay developers and resources for a better game.   If I were to add something else, is that people are too quickly to judge without properly thinking about context and intentions, at which point, if the intentions are good and there's nothing negative in light about the use of the money, we should really be thinking and arguing if the gameplay is what would be affected negatively, which the /u/Emnight already answered (post quote) and I agree with.   I hope that helped."
truegaming,3cz49y,emmanuelvr,6,Sun Jul 12 04:18:14 2015 UTC,"Because these ships are not sold $400.   People are allowed to donate a lot of money and get a token of gratitude. It's like complaining about overpriced food in a charity gala. Of course we all know those ships are NOT worth hundreds of dollars, they won't even be up for sale for real world money once the game launches. But they have to gather funds in a way.   It's easy to imagine that this would provide a sizeable advantage against other players at launch. In the end my question is if anyone can explain to me why this is an acceptable as a business practice I'd love to hear your opinion.   Have you played Freelancer? There is no ""ultimate endgame"" to those space sandbox. Of course you can get the biggest ship with a lot of weapons, but it would considerably limit your experience. You won't be able to race, explore, trade. You'd end up with a slow destroyer that would probably cost you a ludicrous cashflow to keep operating.   So perhaps they have an advantage when it comes to fighting (even so, I doubt a dozen smaller ships wouldn't outmaneuver and crush that destroyer) but it's actually worse in all other areas and arguably harms the fun that comes from upgrading your ship piece by piece."

The money from ship ""pledges"" is understood to go directly into development, not profit like other deplorable DLCs and the like. It's the understanding that this money will only be used for development, and is given in good faith by the backer who in return gets some kind of reward from the developers."

truegaming,3cz49y,OrsikIronfist,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:42:51 2015 UTC,I think what /u/yesat means is that the ship will be purchasable via in-universe credits as opposed to real-world currency upon release. You still have to purchase the game IRL but after that theoretically everything should be obtainable via in-universe credits.  Which of course you will have to spend time playing the game to earn those credits but still.
truegaming,3cz49y,BonzoTheBoss,-1,Tue Jul 14 14:17:29 2015 UTC,No because it's not in early access and needing funding. This is speaking as someone who bought a rather large ship for funding.  It's already been mentioned that everyone will have a fair and the same chance at getting expensive ships later.

truegaming,3cz49y,Baxiepie,0,Sun Jul 12 16:52:34 2015 UTC,"Actually, I don't believe they said they're going to even do the cosmetic route. I think their main source of money is coming from buying the game itself (it's not F2P) for $60, and then selling expansions/new campaigns for SQ42.  They've also mentioned selling limited UEC(gold) that is capped per month to provide another source of income and also to kill gold farmers before they start."
truegaming,3cz49y,Geist-,2,Mon Jul 13 06:53:27 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I'd be interested to see how that pans out. On the one hand, players who work full time jobs and have families etc. and who don't necessarily have the time a teen or 20-something does to play the game shouldn't be penalized in terms of in-game currency, so trading real currency for game credits (in set amounts) makes sense.  On the other hand, credits for real money is a slippery slope that could very easily lead to ""pay to win"" scenarios. After all, those with the free time could still conceivably pay to get extra credits as well.  I'm also unsure if it will stop the gold farmers. As the amount of UEC you can purchase legitimately is probably limited, there will always be those who wish to purchase more."
truegaming,3cz49y,BonzoTheBoss,-2,Tue Jul 14 14:31:50 2015 UTC,"Probably all of them. These guys are going to be especially hard hit by one of the facts of kickstarting / early access: You've already exhausted a lot of your potential income sources.  And worse, if your fans don't feel that you've delivered on what your promised waaaaaayyyyy back when you started and probably barely had a working proof of concept, you've got even less potential sources.  Non-kickstarted games have a much easier time of being judged because you aren't asking people to buy in until pre-order time (and with digital distribution and most games you can pre-order the day before it comes out and get exactly the same deal as someone who pre-orders months in advance).  As for terminology, ""donating"" is a lot closer to reality than ""backing"" in my book. You have absolutely no guarantees that the ship is ever going to be anything more than a pretty picture in your hangar, or that the game development won't be abandoned next month and the servers shut down. Real backers get to at least have a chance of getting some of their money back when the company shuts down and sells off all its assets, and they frequently get all their money back and more if the game is a success. Kickstartees / early access players just get to play the game as-is, nothing more. ""Extreme per-ordering with zero guarantees"" would be more accurate.  I might have suggested ""gamblers"", but real gamblers would take one look at Star Citizen and bet against its success rather than for it."

truegaming,3cz49y,emmanuelvr,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:28:00 2015 UTC,"So it may not be a clear-cut advantage, but you have to admit that having a different ship changes the way you play the game.  In every other game, only purely cosmetic DLC is acceptable.  Can you imagine if Riot made a LoL skin that, for example, increased your damage and decreased your speed?  That's not a clear advantage, but even so the backlash would be huge.  And that's a free-to-play game!  Star Citizen is charging for the game, and it has DLC, and the DLC affects gameplay.  Why do people support this?"
truegaming,3cz49y,Karmicature,2,Wed Jul 15 15:25:54 2015 UTC,"They got more of a pass because until recently they had a hype train large enough to downvote everything. But, in many subreddits that pass is over now. Plenty of excuses still exist for it's problems which also helps it avoid a beating. It's late but, it's not that late for the size of project it is. Sure, the big $ ships are an unfair advantage but, odds are that advantage will be irrelevant in most arenas after 6 months to a year as the cost of keeping them in fit shape will likely be too high or alternative servers/private servers that don't contain those ships begin to launch/pick up steam. If the big $ ships remain viable the game will flop with everyone that isn't in one and the cult of Roberts will finally die. Roberts is arrogant enough to not want his name to be entirely trashed.  Personally, while I doubt Star Citizen can deliver everything it's promised I think they can get a good % done. They just need to get rid of Chris Roberts. He's too much of a dreamer to deliver a product that's enjoyable in the long term for more than a small minority. He loves calling it a  successor to Freelancer but if he'd been left in control Freelancer wouldn't have gotten done.  That doesn't mean he's not brilliant or that his designs aren't very popular with some people. The admin on the Freelancer server I played on/helped with modding and I had tons of arguments over the balance implementations of implementing the larger ships to FL. He wanted the bigger ships to take a large fleet to take down I wanted them to need a fleet to stay up (aka the ship has loads of hp but can't shoot everywhere so once you get on it's tail it's toast 3- 10 minutes later if you don't have fighter support to prevent that). He was also really excited about the idea of getting ships to have multiple people controlling it (I'm not sure if anyone managed that one yet.

I guess it also just kinda brings up the question of why not build the insurance into the ships upon purchase?

truegaming,3cz49y,BonzoTheBoss,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:02:43 2015 UTC,"While I get what you're saying, insurance companies are also run by people. Presumably, consumers can shop around and purchase insurance from a company they believe is solvent and provides a fair deal, so the price isn't built in.  Near as I can tell, insurance in SC is looking to be more or less a game mechanic embedded in the system, rather than another source of money for players. The assumption I'm making, in this case, is insurance is pretty much going to be a flat rate, maybe varied based on the ship, and a couple of levels of protection. When insurance is required for vehicles in real life without the constant threat of pirates and aliens trying to loot or explode your sedan, it seems kinda silly that you can run without it in what's essentially the sci-fi equivalent of the wild west.  I guess the issue boils down to the fact that while insurance provides a compromise between protection of your investment, realism, and danger, I feel like it kinda falls short of any of these three. Why make a mechanic optional when the alternative is to simply lose everything to somebody who's trying to get their rocks off attacking other ships? I feel like it's annoying enough to worry about insurance in real life, why should my fictional video game have to deal with these trivialities too?"

truegaming,3cuuc5,NegaDanny,93,Fri Jul 10 23:27:53 2015 UTC,"One of the things I like is that Edmund uses text almost perfunctorily and to hilarious effect. If we want answers about Rebirth, we can look at the original game.  Look at the very first room in The Binding of Isaac. The UI is pretty much copied from The Legend of Zelda. The only text you see is Arrows, Space, Life, and Basement 1. you also have basic Attack, Move, Bomb, and Item written on the floor. Arrows is particularly funny because the teardrop looks nothing like an arrow.  Now open up the menu screen. Your stats are not displayed as names and numbers, but symbols and bars. They also don't explain very much. Most players probably won't open the menu immediately when they start playing nor do they really care at this point.  In The Legend of Zelda, you don't get any text when you pick up an item, but simply hold it over your head. Imagine you pick up a sword in Isaac and it says ""It's dangerous to go alone"". It doesn't tell you that it's a bow and that it shoots arrows and that it does 1 damage. The game is marginally more helpful here with giving the item a name. The stats are hidden away in the pause menu so you have to stop playing to look at them.  The four stats visible on the pause screen are all taught to the player as they play the game, teaching through mechanics. You can tell how fast you move, how fast they shoot whether your tears do more damage, and how far they go. This is all about game feel and giving feedback to the player. The game can also do other things like change the color of the tears, make them bigger or smaller, or display effects above enemies. Careful players will learn what the items do as they play further on.  This is how the game takes advantage of iterative game sessions in rogue-likes. You discover the same item over and over. Once you die, the game gives a summary of all the items you had and then starts over immediately. While you can't tell specifically what item did what, you have a general idea how the game felt as a combination of those items. Because you are no longer shooting yellow tears riding a pony with a rock sticking out of your head. Some items like Guppy's Tail are posed as a mystery for the player to solve.  When we move on to Rebirth, Edmund added text descriptions. Just like the original though, they are perfunctory or to be funny. So yes, have Goat Head say ""He accepts your offering"" because it's funny. You wear a goat on your head. He doesn't want you to understand what it means. He wants you to play the game and review what the game did or said after you are done playing. Which is usually done by killing the player."

truegaming,3cuuc5,shadowrelic,13,Sat Jul 11 07:03:01 2015 UTC,"Heh, it's kind of clever how there's a double-meaning there. You use the arrow keys to fire 'arrows'."

truegaming,3cuuc5,defaultstyle,4,Sat Jul 11 16:20:55 2015 UTC,"No, it's a clever design choice. By tying the shoot button to the arrow keys and making the game with Zeldaesque game play, they were able to explain the controls and the function in a single word, complementing their minimalistic UI."
truegaming,3cuuc5,inuvash255,-1,Sat Jul 11 22:59:25 2015 UTC,Lol....reaching pretty hard there
truegaming,3cuuc5,IamtheSlothKing,9,Mon Jul 13 16:00:20 2015 UTC,This is a great explanation and makes me want to give the game another good chance. I've played the original but have been frustrated about the seeming randomness of the game. This explanation adds a little clarity.
truegaming,3cuuc5,jumbosnake,14,Sat Jul 11 06:16:10 2015 UTC,"It's the type of game where you die early and often when you don't know what's going on, but once you start to figure things out a good player will almost never die until later on in a run. This is partially because early choices can have major effects later on in a run.   The great part is it's designed to give you more of a challenge by adding new levels the more you win. I definitely understand being daunted at first, but once I got used to it it became one of my most played games."
truegaming,3cuuc5,BoredomHeights,0,Sat Jul 11 07:52:35 2015 UTC,"To me it's a cheap way to almost stretch the game length into infinity by adding artificial ""replay value"".  I agree that those games are addicting and give you a strange sense of accomplishment when you stick to them, but so does gambling. Ultimately I think such game mechanics are dangerous and a waste of human potential and time."
truegaming,3cuuc5,mbrochh,9,Sat Jul 11 08:03:52 2015 UTC,"At the same time, though, it's a shallow commitment game.  You don't have to keep playing for days or weeks to build up what you have and can do with it.  Instead it can be a quick play that you pull out when you just want something different, and it will probably play out differently than your previous experience because of the variety of small random drops and how much they change the mechanics of play."
truegaming,3cuuc5,Perryn,13,Sat Jul 11 12:12:18 2015 UTC,"it's a cheap way to almost stretch the game length   Not particularly. The mechanics are perfectly fair, and if you don't enjoy the sense of discovery they're designed to evoke there are always wikis.   Roguelikes aren't meant to be beaten on the first try, and if you did you'd miss almost all of the content - trying again in a different way is much of the fun. It tickles a nerve not everyone has, that doesn't make it cheap.   Ultimately I think such game mechanics are dangerous and a waste of human potential and time.   I don't imagine there's a game mechanic in the world you couldn't say this about if you insisted on it."
truegaming,3cuuc5,snoharm,6,Sat Jul 11 08:49:00 2015 UTC,"Isaac features a lot of artificial replay value through obfuscation and unlocks AND a lot of true replay value derived from legitimate challenge and variety.  I would agree that misleading descriptions are solidly a negative and most unlocks aren't a good mechanic - but there's also a sizable heaping of interesting depth and challenging gameplay to be found as well, enough that players have hundreds or thousands of hours invested continually improving their play."
truegaming,3cuuc5,Twinge,2,Sat Jul 11 11:05:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't care for the original, but I played rebirth to death."
truegaming,3cuuc5,Naught,2,Sat Jul 11 13:21:44 2015 UTC,"The randomness is Isaac is similar to that in FTL or Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup - things can definitely swing in your favor or against you making it easier or harder to win, but good enough play will still win the game virtually every single time."
truegaming,3cuuc5,Twinge,2,Sat Jul 11 19:07:05 2015 UTC,"Well thought out and written. My only complaint is that wikis DO exist. And just like Minecraft, it's almost a given that players will quickly begin referring to it.  I wish BoI had an ingame glossery that was only filled in after you died, and all the items you encountered on that run were defined. Or something.  Something that keeps the mystery and rogue nature alive, while making wikis less necessary."
truegaming,3cuuc5,beetnemesis,5,Sat Jul 11 13:58:44 2015 UTC,"In the original game I could forgive it, but Edmund went into Rebirth knowing that a wiki would immediately spring up and answer every single last question. Having to be completely removed from the game to check what an item does kills momentum."
truegaming,3cuuc5,the-nub,2,Sat Jul 11 14:16:34 2015 UTC,"In The Legend of Zelda, you don't get any text when you pick up an item, but simply hold it over your head.   I watched Arin and Dan of the Game Grumps playing a couple of Zelda games recently (never got in to them much myself) and it immediately struck me how similar to Isaac they are. I hadn't realised Isaac took its inspiration so heavily from Zelda but it's hard to deny when you look at the two side by side."
truegaming,3cuuc5,fade_like_a_sigh,4,Sat Jul 11 14:35:35 2015 UTC,It's also incredibly painfully obvious to anyone who's played both.
truegaming,3cuuc5,IamtheSlothKing,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:01:11 2015 UTC,"(It says 'he accepts your offering' because goat head guarantees devil/angel rooms. It's a sacrificial goat, so you can pick up on the vibe.)  Yours is a pretty nice analysis.   Obscurity of information is definitely a design choice - as well as a traditional Roguelike mechanic e.g. potions/scrolls being different every time, unidentified items whose purpose you work out when using them).   In traditional roguelikes there's a certain amount of 'spoiler' content that's hard to discover and overcome yourself, requiring a community effort.  Memory also plays a big part - learning what certain items or enemies do and then applying that knowledge. That's mastery in action.  BoI definitely has these kind of elements. There's a shit-ton of items (and more coming in the Afterbirth expansion) whose effects are vague. Some are obvious (e.g. they change your tears), some are easy to work out or guess at, others require looking up online  Item information (or he lack of it) is especially relevant in BoI as the meta game revolves around which items you should take to synergise with the ones you already have, and which ones you should avoid on your current run.  So yeah, there's an interesting relationship between the game and the spoiler wikis / cheat sheet sites e.g. the http://platinumgod.co.uk site by our own /u/elucidater  Would it be better if the game had a built-in glossary or detailed tooltips? I don't think it's a given."
truegaming,3cuuc5,Clapyourhandssayyeah,0,Wed Jul 15 09:39:14 2015 UTC,"Hey, nice deconstruction."
truegaming,3cuuc5,crabtreason,13,Sat Jul 11 14:27:56 2015 UTC,"First, I wanna say that this is a great question. I've thought about this myself a bit.  Clearly, the game designer knows that many players will just turn to a wiki to find out full details about any item. That's a part of the game design by omission.  For the players who want a more pure or old school experience, they can puzzle out the meaning of each item through multiple playthroughs. So in that sense, it offers players the best of both worlds.  And mostly, it contributes to the atmosphere of the game, what another commenter called the feel. It's a conscious design choice that adds something intangible to the overall effect of the game. In that sense it is a part of the game as a work of art."
truegaming,3cuuc5,fancyPantsOne,12,Sat Jul 11 03:50:58 2015 UTC,"The problem is there are a lot of hidden modifiers behind the scenes that can affect your game in pretty drastic measures that aren't immediately obvious.  With some item descriptions in game, they almost lie to you.  It obfuscates to the point of misinformation so people HAVE to go to the wiki to learn any truth to how the game actually works.  He can be clever with words and still be truthful to players how items work, but he chooses not to."
truegaming,3cuuc5,Ralanost,11,Sat Jul 11 10:25:22 2015 UTC,"Exactly this.  A good example of this is the 3 ""Faith Up"" items - identical descriptions on all 3, yet each has a completely different effect.  A large number of these items could never be realistically deciphered simply playing the game in a vacuum."
truegaming,3cuuc5,Twinge,4,Sat Jul 11 11:07:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's worth noting too that this plays very strongly into data mining, because that's the most logical way to get information about such subtle and unexplained differences.  This is important because the developer was appalled and angered when his game was datamined, despite the fact that its design choices are practically begging people to do so."
truegaming,3cuuc5,KoboldCommando,2,Sat Jul 11 16:59:31 2015 UTC,"And in that case, the data found literally would've been fully deciphered within 1-2 days anyway - the community had already pieced together how to do it, all that was left was the grind to finish putting it all together.  And if we want to keep talking about questionable design - how about items that can only be unlocked by using a character you would literally never find playing the game by yourself?"
truegaming,3cuuc5,Twinge,5,Sat Jul 11 19:04:05 2015 UTC,"The answer here is that it's good if you like roguelike elements, and bad if you don't. It's obviously a nod to the roguelike genre (as are many other aspects of BoI). The idea that not everything is obvious and trial and error are an important part of the play experience are fundamental to roguelikes. Whether you like it or not, and hence whether it's good or bad, is up to the player."
truegaming,3cuuc5,DragonDai,3,Sat Jul 11 08:13:17 2015 UTC,"Actually, in the Roguelike genre all information is revealed to you and nothing is deliberately hidden, with the exception of ""unidentified items"" (these are typically items that have magic added to them, so their base properties are revealed). This doesn't really count, since an identification spell reveals their full properties regardless, while in BoI you have to figure these items out with trial and error.  Furthermore, you are fully aware of all your stats, and if you equip an item you can immediately see the full effect is has on them provided the item has been identified.   Many Roguelikes even freely give you the full stats of the opponent. This is pretty great, because then seeing a Dragon on Level 3 of a dungeon means you will shit your pants rather than attack it, die, and just start over again."
truegaming,3cuuc5,TempusFrangit,2,Sat Jul 11 09:27:51 2015 UTC,"That's not really true. Nethack has a lot of mechanics that are only vaguely hinted at in-game, or the information is not available on demand. Very few, if any, players manage to beat the game without ""spoilers"". These days there is a very thorough wiki that documents the intricacies of each item, enemy, and mechanic that can help new players through the game.  In general, I would encourage new players to freely use the wiki. However, it is a different experience, and you can't go back once you've spoiled the game. So it can be worthwhile to play the game a few times with no spoilers before you dive into the wiki."
truegaming,3cuuc5,Kered13,5,Sun Jul 12 10:00:44 2015 UTC,"The idea that not everything is obvious and trial and error are an important part of the play experience are fundamental to roguelikes.   I love roguelikes, and this is completely antithetical to what I love about them.  GOOD roguelike design, such as Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, can still manage very challenging, deep gameplay without a bunch of trial-and-error nonsense.  Decisions should still be interesting and the game should still be fun without that nonsense - and there's still plenty of that lovely discovery aspect that can be created without forcing failure outside of the player's control."
truegaming,3cuuc5,Twinge,2,Sat Jul 11 09:20:32 2015 UTC,I agree with you. I don't think it's a good mechanic. But that's why it's there.
truegaming,3cuuc5,DragonDai,3,Sat Jul 11 09:57:17 2015 UTC,"This is surely the point and even makes sense thematically.  You have to understand that the currently used descriptions are simply what Issac sees, the same goes for the entire game, you get very little info as Issac is a baby and sees things in a certain way, On the other hand, explaining the items would remove some of the games enjoyment, the games primary focus is you learning about the world, if item descriptions were obvious you'd lose half of the games replayability and adventure. The same goes for all rogue likes, going in blind and discovering things."
truegaming,3cuuc5,Cyclops61,3,Sat Jul 11 11:51:48 2015 UTC,"I like the lack of descriptive text initially, because discovery and fear of the unknown is a big part of Isaac. However, a player isn't meant to play Isaac a couple of times. They're meant to play it many, many times and fully explore the effects and interactions of items. Once you've played the game enough to want to succeed in it beyond just beating the first section of the game, the item pick ups give the game some strategic depth: do you pick up this permanent effect item which totally changes how you play the game, perhaps voiding the effect of some of your previous hard-won pick ups? Will this particular usable item outweigh the benefit of the one you're carrying?   This is, in my opinion, a big part of what keeps the game interesting after your initial playthroughs. It gives the player a feeling of agency because it invites them to engage in some kind of hard decision-making and long-term planning. As the game is now, that planning requires either a lot of memorization or constant checking of outside information. It's a barrier to entry for the next phase in learning the game that I think Mcmullen probably weighed against the sense of mystery he wanted to preserve, though I don't know that I agree with the conclusion he came to.  I personally would prefer that the catalog of items labels their effect after you've finished a game (either by success or failure) with them in your inventory. As it is, people either memorize the effects or they look them up. Neither of these things preserve that mystery later in a player's time with the game.   There are a lot of comparisons to Rogue-likes here, and I think that this is fair considering what Isaac is. But let's not forget that one of the most popular Rogue-likes around, Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, was designed in reaction to the huge amount of information that a game like Nethack required you to learn through crazy amounts of trial and error and memorization (to the point where much of what we know about Nethack comes from looking directly at the source code). Where Nethack went to extremes in obfuscation, Dungeon Crawl's core philosophy is to encourage good decision-making based on relatively solid information presented to the player. Isaac, being a game about discovery and uncertainty and fear, naturally wants to take inspiration from both of these games. I think that its misstep (while still being a great game) is in aping a bit too much of Nethack in enforcing a lack of information that outlives its intended actual effect. I think this works better for some queries a player might have (""what is this photograph for?"" or ""what happens if I give this NPC money?"") than others (""well, I forgot what this particular Tarot card does, back to the wiki with me"")."
truegaming,3cuuc5,Nickoten,5,Mon Jul 13 16:28:58 2015 UTC,"I feel that as a collaboration within a community it's a good choice.   I feel that as a design choice viewed from a single person standpoint it can be incredibly frustrating and confusing.  Most items are fairly straightforward, but there are more than a few that are unintuitive and can be discouraging.  So pros and cons."
truegaming,3cuuc5,candeeman,14,Sat Jul 11 02:42:51 2015 UTC,"Trinkets are by far the worst offender since they're typically passive items with minor bonuses, and with a game so reliant in RNG it's impossible to notice sometimes if it's the trinket having an effect or you're just being crazy.     For example, Mom's Pearl is a trinket with the description ""It emanates purity"" and the effect is a 1/10 additional chance for any given heart drop to become a spirit heart. Without a wiki, how do you know it's the trinket giving you those few extra spirit hearts in your run or just good luck?"
truegaming,3cuuc5,Ponce_In_A_Blue_Box,4,Sat Jul 11 04:45:41 2015 UTC,"The effect is too minimal to pinpoint, but I think that's one of the more telling text samples."
truegaming,3cuuc5,snoharm,3,Sat Jul 11 08:52:42 2015 UTC,"This isn't really a cherry-picked example, though.  You can't tell Black Candle increases your deal chance from the game itself.  Experimental Treatment outright lies in the description, and figuring out exactly how that works in-game wouldn't be possible.  Figuring out that the Cursed Eye teleports you specifically while it is charging rather than randomly isn't something almost anyone will decipher.  The actual effect of Black Lipstick, Daemon's Tail, Bible Tract, and Rosary Bead would all be extremely hard to figure out - in fact, the community still doesn't have any precise info on two of these items.  And there are many others.  Obfuscating descriptions so it's more difficult to figure out is one thing - completely hiding the effects to anyone just playing the game is another.  It's borne as much of laziness as it is of intentional design; I really wish the game was more polished."

truegaming,3cuuc5,Cageebus,9,Sat Jul 11 12:24:37 2015 UTC,"I think it's terrible, since I grab something and have no idea what it does. I suppose this would be fine if the game allowed you to ""discover"" a description for it through use, but as is it just leads to looking up online item tables. Critical information like this should always be accessible in-game."
truegaming,3cuuc5,Zarokima,2,Sat Jul 11 05:21:55 2015 UTC,"Whilst I disagree that it's terrible, I do agree with you that the ability to discover its description would be good. The main menu could feature another option that takes you to a sort of database for all of the trinkets and passive collectables. If you have interacted with any item at least once, a full description of it's exact properties could be revealed."
truegaming,3cuuc5,wundertunge,2,Sat Jul 11 09:31:46 2015 UTC,"First of all, I don't think Ed McMillen makes design choices haphazardly. You can see this both in Isaac and SMB. Yes, on the one hand, it would be nice to be able to get an item description even in the armory (through the menus, shows unlocked items). On the other hand, like you've already said, I do really enjoy the experiential discovery of each item. I have put in 160 hours into the game, and still have to look up items on [platinumgod.co.uk](platinumgod.co.uk)"
truegaming,3cuuc5,WoodyTrombone,2,Sat Jul 11 12:52:13 2015 UTC,"The obfuscation of item abilities is the reason I don't play Issac anymore.  At first, I wanted to stay true to the spirit of the game. I didn’t look up the items, died a lot, but whatever. I was learning, that's the point. Then, I had a good run where I went farther than I had ever before get completely scrapped by picking up a terrible item.  That was frustrating. So, I started looking up items before picking them up. It really slows the game down when you (feel like) you have to find the item on the wiki each time you find a new one. The game became a chore, and was no longer fun.  Unlocking a description of what each item (actually) does should be a part of the game's progression. I don't feel like 'nerd cred' is a good reason to keep an unfun mechanic in a game."
truegaming,3cuuc5,Twinge,5,Tue Jul 14 13:26:05 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, The Binding of Isaac is a good game filled with bad design (and a major lack of playtesting).  The game heavy implies that 'Damage Up' and 'Damage Up' mean the same thing, but in reality it can mean a mere 0.3 Damage Up (through a complicated formula) or a whopping 2.3x Damage Multiplier and everything in-between.  Likewise, there are descriptions like 'Faith Up' which mean 3 very distinct things for 3 different items despite having identical descriptions.  Other descriptions are vague, unhelpful, leave out major bits of information, or even just lie.  While discovery is a very important aspect of a game like this, there's still a HUGE amount of discovery and learning to be had without the info being garbage or the game lying to the player.  There's also a relevant difference between obfuscated information the player can reasonably figure out, and information the player will never be reasonably capable of deciphering on their own.  There's a ton of this sort of stuff all over Isaac like this; it's well beyond just the descriptions.  It pains me how much the game lacks polish in so many ways - it still manages to be a very good game but it could easily be so much better!"
truegaming,3cuuc5,junkit33,4,Sat Jul 11 10:58:17 2015 UTC,"I feel like a lot of people miss the point of this game.   You're not supposed to know what things do until you try them. The descriptions are intentionally vague, and more there to help with memory recollection of what that item did for you in the past. Some items are good, some are bad. Synergies exist. But you learn by playing.   The idea isn't to run to a wiki and win the game in your first few runs. The idea is to die 100 times just learning about the items before you should even think about beating the game.   I think the wiki is fine once you've ripped through the game for hours on end and have unlocked half the stuff. There are a few things you'll never do on your own without it. But if you start going to the wiki right away, you're completely robbing yourself of the real experience of the game."

truegaming,3cuuc5,itsjusttoored,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:33:49 2015 UTC,"Discovery is great and all, but some items were a little too vague / hard to figure out, so I found myself resorting to the Internet cheat sheet.  Problem is, the cheat sheet shows ALL the items in the game.  So just the act of going there looking for one item caused me to spoil the rest for me (at least to the extent of how many more there were to find).  I'd rather have an option that I can turn on so I can get a little more description for items that I first discovery.  Or, add an items page in the game that gives more detail on items you unlock and let the ""pick up"" description be vague.  This way, players like myself can spend extra clicks looking up details while other players can just discover the uses for themselves."
truegaming,3cuuc5,Twinge,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:15:04 2015 UTC,"I think it's good - it keeps it accessible, and encourages replaying to find out what things do, as well as keeping an air of mystery around some items.   If you pick up the Pact, for example, you're gonna notice you fire a little faster, do more damage, and get two soul hearts. It saying ""+0.5 dmg, +0.7 tears, + 2 soul hearts"" is relatively pointless, as those numbers are meaningless - is that a lot of damage? Is it nothing at all? The vast majority of players neither know nor care that you start at 3.5 damage, for example.   Similarly, it can be confusing with some items. Roid Rage says ""Range Up"" when picked up - however, it's actually a Shot Height up, which is one of a few facets to do with range that is pretty ubiquitous at best. Hell, even tear rate falls under tears and tear delay."
truegaming,3cuuc5,itsjusttoored,2,Sat Jul 11 11:59:10 2015 UTC,"it keeps it accessible   It does the exact opposite of this.  Being excessively vague and occasionally outright lying to the player makes the game far LESS friendly and accessible, not more.  Things certainly don't need to be broken down into exact numbers in-game, but there is a middle ground available too.  Isaac has an item that increase your damage by 16% and another by 130% with the same 'Damage Up' description.  There's a multitude of items that you will never, ever figure out simply playing the game.  To make matters worse, the stat screen is garbage making it even harder to figure out anything."
truegaming,3cuuc5,mqduck,0,Sat Jul 11 19:29:58 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I certainly agree with that - the items that lie are definitely bad, although I don't have a problem with the simply comedic descriptions over a factual one of the effect is obvious.

truegaming,3cuuc5,hakkzpets,0,Sat Jul 11 10:34:38 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls and it's sequel do something similar -- often, an items potential isn't going to be clear unless you read (and read into) it's description a lot. For that reason, it's really clear when chatting with other players who went in blind and who used a lot of guides, because the ones who played blind usually know quite a bit about the lore, since they read basically everything.   I have mixed feelings about it. It does force the player to experiment with everything -- even items they don't necessarily want to, and I can see how it works better as a system in a slower, heavier game like Dark Souls than in a roguelite like Binding of Isaac. It encourages datamining a lot, but then the dev goes and gets angry over people dataming? I found that stranger than anything."

If we spoke of ""server history"" in many modern RPGs, there isn't much to experience that was player made and not strictly created by the developer.  I suppose some games have the potential for this, like another poster mentioned EVE, but the problem is that in many MMOs, there was never the Mad King xxxNoScopeYOLOxxx who ruled the Imperial City with an iron fist for over a decade and the brave weregirl hero WolfsRCute who fought to overthrow him.  In many games, by large, there were no player created Red Weddings, Battles at Agincourt, Last Stands at Thermopylae, Regicides, Homicides, etc.  Why?  Simply because many MMOs adhere to the theme park format.  All players are created absolutely equal - in the end everyone gets to save the day or nobody does.  Everyone gets to rule or nobody does.  And no player can truly fuck over another player in the long run.  When you have a scenario like that, where bloody and dramatic sieges and betrayals just dont happen between the players themselves, its hard to even have a fleshed out history.  Sure, the developers can pull a Cataclysm and players will say ""hey remember this area from before the event"" but it really isn't that interesting because it's all kinda fake.  Nothing the players do really ever seem to matter to the world at large.  If we had games like the WoW that was presented in South Park, where the no-lifer started wacking everyone and presented a true threat to the realm at large, then you can start building a cool, dynamic history that people will actually like to hear stories about.  Real history is filled with war, chaos, betrayal and bloodshed but the presence of the evil helps to bring the good out too.  WolfsRCute would never be the immortal hero without the evil reign of King xxxNoScopeYOLOxxx.  Many players aren't cool with this game type though - the potential of someone else being able to come in and fuck them over is too high.  Many games that allow for true player impact offer no incentive for extremely large groups to work together - xxxNoScopeYOLOxxx never ascends to the throne because no one supports him.  By what right does he have to the throne?  Again, EVE may offer a possibility for this, but the thing to consider is that once the rule has been solidified, it may never come undone.  What if xxxNoScopeYOLOxxx was a just king, and no one overthrew him for the entire 10 year life cycle of the game?  Wouldn't that also be somewhat boring for the other players?  The problem is that with many modern MMOs - everyone is the special hero king.  Which means no one is special.  And many devs aren't willing to risk a system that encourages one player being more special than another."
truegaming,3csn4n,KaiserDusseldorf,3,Fri Jul 10 15:44:26 2015 UTC,"That is a very interesting point. What if we said that the ""heritage"" of WoW, for example, would be including the out of the game community as well? I mean, there are people that one way or another have made an impact within this community and people still remember them. I know, it is not inside the game, stricktly speaking, but in a broader sense it has affected the community. Or there people from inside the game, very good pvpers for example, that are still commemorated by other players (even if they made no impact on the lore/story of the game)"
truegaming,3csn4n,KaiserDusseldorf,3,Fri Jul 10 16:03:24 2015 UTC,"It's possible that this tourist may enjoy out of game experiences, through popular videos, fan made music, etc...but the key here is investment.  If they are just a tourist, it shouldn't take them long to find the good stuff and still be able to appreciate it for what it is.  Social heritage could certainly work with excellent PvPers, but the key here is that these excellent people would need to be truly legendary, especially if we want them to be widely spoken of and known to a casual tourist.  Pretty much, to construct a true social history, you need to foster in game celebrities on both the PvP and PvE end.  Competitive gaming and MLG tournaments already kinda does this for some games (although it seems, rarely an MMO) because people like to follow their Moba, RTS and Shooter icons.  But I suppose, with analogy, PvP constructs something of a sports history for your game but it doesn't provide your game with a general history.  That's where PvE would come in, or PvPvE or whatever that's called."
truegaming,3csn4n,ShazbotSimulator2012,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:30:47 2015 UTC,"The closest thing I can think of to this is 2b2t. A fairly long running minecraft server with no rules or moderation whatsoever. You could walk for thousands of blocks in any direction and see ruins of what were once people's homes. Since the map almost never changed and there was no griefing protection, player impact was significant and long lasting. As you got farther from the spawn you would occasionally run into some really interesting things. A massive castle with a small tunnel drilled into the side, and everything inside looted. Signs and chests left by starving players with no hope of survival.  The map remained through updates that required new chunks to be loaded for the new content, so the outer edges looked dramatically different.  I could see server history becoming interesting as more games start to include player designed content. The closest thing to it in an MMO that I know of besides EVE and the like was Star Wars Galaxies, where players could make their own towns, albeit with prebuilt structures. Everquest Next might also be like that."

In many games, by large, there were no player created Red Weddings, Battles at Agincourt, Last Stands at Thermopylae, Regicides, Homicides, etc.   I think I disagree. This kind of stuff does happen.   Well first of all, on the topic of WOW, a lot of the draw of the initial game was, ""Come and see your favorite locations and people from the Warcraft series!"". I know when I joined WoW, I spent about a year doing nothing but travelling around, visiting all the cool places, looking at the monuments from the earlier games, etc. One of my favorite moments in Wow was playing an Undead character and travelling to Lordaeron for the first time. I walked the path that Arthas walked, and you can hear the music and dialogue from that famous cinematic, and it was just the coolest thing ever.   But there are some unique things that happen in RPGs that are worthy of remembering, and when applicable, generating tourism. The Corrupted Blood incident comes to mind. A debuff from a raid boss that was designed to keep the raiders separated from one another by spreading from player to player somehow made it out of the raid instance and into a capital city. Within hours, it was in several capital cities. Players all across the world, dying, and able to do nothing about it. The high-level players that could survive for a number of minutes after being infected would travel to lower-level areas and just run around and kill everyone there with the plague.   I'm sure that there are many players who play through BlackRock Spire for the purpose of reenacting Leeroy Jenkins.   Real history is very interesting. Real history also takes thousands of years to produce. In a game world, you can hire a good writer to produce thousands of years of history into a single story. Then, you can make a game based on tourism that people will want to experience, to travel to the places and witness the events. It need not even be a game, just a world to move about in.   And there doesn't even have to be a story. Things can have significance outside of what is given to them by events. It is not impossible to imagine 3d landscapes and structures that are beautiful and worth visiting in their own right. Antichamber kind of plays with this. It has a game element in the puzzle solving, but besides that, the game is fun simply because the player gets to navigate these cool non-euclidean spaces."

Its not unheard of for groups to grab fast and hard to catch ships like shuttles and interceptors and do tours of famous places in the galaxy.

Even examples without artistic liberties, like recreations of L.A. are still not a comparison for what I feel actually visiting the physical Los Angeles. Games allow a different kind of escapism than travel, so there is no doubt a market and purpose for that kind of thing, it will just be different. Alien worlds and artistically crafted representations of worlds offer their unique thing, being in the physical reality offers me a different thing. I guess this a roundabout of me saying I'm very into it, especially in regards to alien worlds, but when it comes to historical cities, I'd find AR or guided/audio tours of the real places to have no real comparison."

I couldn't get over how I was looking at the shoes that Judy Garland actually wore, that became such a symbol of pop culture and an icon of film, it was one of the strongest feelings I can remember having, this sort of nostalgia and pride and honor... Another memorable time was seeing Rembrandt's Lucretia on the wall for the first time...staring at the brushstrokes this genius left, how much sadness he was able to portray, such violence and resentment and...I dunno, I just got so wrapped up in it I could barely sleep that night, the emotional power of that event was paralyzing. Then, to step outside of art and be places with historical power, such as Washington DC... my trip there was completely mind blowing. I had seen the White House, the Capital, the Lincoln Memorial hundreds of times in my life on TV or in movies or textbooks, but being there was measurably more significant."

I even player some truly motion sickness inducing hours in Half Life 2, I had to stop at the second helicopter part as the motion sickness was too strong, but the experience of walking around city 17 and staring combine troops in the eyes and feeling genuine physical distress at their stun baton waving was truly something. And the first time I looked up at the Citadel in City 17 was utterly mind blowing, the utter scale of it just awed and shocked me.   The experience (and motion sicness inducing feeling) of walking through an detailed custom minecraft map that recreated the capital city of the Game Of Thrones world was magical. Walking through long streets, walls, palaces and towers in the rain seeing the clouds and moon crawl across the sky with the rain falling down on the many houses was a truly powerful VR experience. I can only dream about how it could be without minecraft's static world, shitty lag and ghost town effect (no people).  I have been thinking about making a simple procedural world generator in Unity3d so I can have something exotic to look at in VR when I get really bored, essentially so I can have the feel of being somewhere else for a few minutes. Like some golden glowy space ships flying through a big long crystal cave with a toxic green river at the bottom, just so I can go ""that's cool!"" and get a exciting 5 minutes if I am really bored.

The trouble is that creating in-depth lived in worlds is expensive, either in terms of money or time. Look at Shenmue vs. Vice City, for an example of the sacrifices needed - both AAA games take place in the 80's, but Vice City is closer to a museum exhibit. There's no point in getting to know any of the NPCs - they're more abstract representations of the population, with no real individuality. Open a door, walk in somewhere, and it's the bare minimum to count as a set. But it nails the cultural atmosphere - the nostalgia, not the reality.  Shenmue, by contrast, is tone deaf as Hell, to the point where it's reasonable to question if a disability was involved, and seems to go out of its way to bore you...but if you really, really, want to go back in time to the 80's in Japan, there's so many small details completely nailed, once you allow for intellectual property law, and a little historical fudging about what home consoles could actually achieve.   If you could combine the strengths of the two, virtual tourism - through both time and space - could absolutely be a thing. But who will pay for it?   By the way, if you want to explore a lot of content quickly, without game mechanics getting in the way, check out IMVU.

What becomes revealed later is that the ""ractives"" were not powered by AI-driven characters, but rather real people, jacked in to the 'net and steering an avatar in a capacity as an ""actor"" in these movies - so that you could really interact with genuine people in genuine ways.  It existed by providing a paid-for entertainment service for the first-world, and providing low-risk, low-pay work for millions of the displaced, poor, or unemployable.

truegaming,3csn4n,Shar3D,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:12:20 2015 UTC,"I see virtual tourism being a plausible concept, but I don't think it would become a legitimate vacation type of event.  Game worlds are appealing not only because of escapism, but because of accessibility.   While some gamers with addictive personality have done marathon-level amounts of playing, a tourist is going to get tired, hungry, etc.   And when the VR is turned off, the immersion is broken.  But for brief tours lasting maybe a few hours, I see this as truly likely, not just possible.   Game environments continue to develop.   But for every really cool game world, there exists the equal technology to create virtual worlds for the specific purpose of casual visitation.  WoW is the go-to example, since OP is familiar with it.  The game world is a condensed world. Zone-to-zone is not seamless ecologically. Just climbing up a hill you can see half of one hill is a reddish clay color and the other half is a dull grey where the surrounding environments of each side of that hill match.  A tourist is not going to be impressed enough to fork over real money just to trounce around on a safari of the Barrens or bird watch in Kun Lai.  The size of any given zone is a few acres and is designed to be engaged. Sure much of it is pretty - even gorgeous - but its tiny if you are not focused on tasks.  This could certainly change in the future. WoW specifically won't be a medium for this but new games might emerge with a better ""tourist grab.""  So my eventuality here is that game worlds probably won't be tourist-y but that virtual tours of fantasy worlds likely will.  A whole industry of extremely immersive environments with marginal interaction could be very appealing.

I turn the lights off, have a few drinks, suspend my disbelief, and completely buy into some kind of open world. Not even MMO, just regular single player experiences like Witcher, Far Cry, or GTA.   Setting aside technological limitations because I'm confident we'll get there, the key issue will be pricing, service, and perceived value for money spent. If I can pay ~$60 for an on demand vacation as opposed to $600 to travel, I'd be all in. So longs they don't ruin immersion."

Spectator would have to have the game, of course. Since they are not ""playing"" the game, their added server load is negligible, assuming they limit the amount of spectator connections.

truegaming,3cu6ft,vazzaroth,9,Fri Jul 10 20:23:19 2015 UTC,"Preface, my focus is mainly on the multiplayer but I do comment on singleplayer.  I agree that DoW2 & CoH2 could be better but they are the antithesis of Star Craft. Most rts, including DoW1, has their focus on building units and throwing them away as they don't level up or anything. In DoW2 & Coh2, the veterancy on the squads as well as the retreat mechanic puts an emphasis on unit preservation. To my knowledge, only Supreme Commander has a veterancy system in it.  As to why DoW2 & CoH2 suck, I'll start with DoW2. DoW2 used the COH system but had variables that didn't fit the system. The biggest being melee. You can't balance between range and melee, when you have a retreat mechanic so melee was always underpowered or overpowered since relic can't balance it. Other problems compounded this such as suppression not fitting in a world of jetpacks & stealth aliens.    One other big problem, that DoW2 & CoH2 suffers from, is the constant OP of one faction. Its like the devs jizzed out on one faction and made it blatantly broken. For DoW2, first it was the Tyranids(at one point 6-7 out of the top 10 players were Tyranid players) then Chaos when the expansion came out. In CoH2, the german factions has had a clear advantage in 2v2+ since it came out. There is usually one unit, faction, or commander that ranges from broken to OP leading to stale gameplay.  As for singleplayer and VSing the AI, a lot of the things which makes DoW2 & CoH2 good multiplayer games causes it to be poor with the AI. In DoW, cover & accuracy were very basic. It was purely based on numbers, such as Starcraft. With the later games, there are so many factors in combat: whether or not the unit is moving and/or in cover, how far or close the units are, what weapon the unit is using, is the unit reloading its gun, is the tank being hit on its front or rear armor, what is the penetration value on the projectile vs the armor value on the tank, armor values on infantry(Space marines armor vs Imperial guard) ect. The AI doesn't handle this very well so its a lot of constantly recapping points as the AI sends a unit here and there for decaps. Just a few hours ago, I was taking on massive armies in DoW. The AI doesn't really do that in CoH2 & DoW2  I have a candle in my window for DoW3  Work Cited: +-2000 hours in both CoH2 & DoW2 multiplayer. +-1200 hours of DoW1 single player & skirmish."
truegaming,3cu6ft,shadowwada,3,Sat Jul 11 06:11:59 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge, only Supreme Commander has a veterancy system in it.   Every CNC game since Tiberian Sun (1999) had unit veterancy. After getting enough kills, units would level up and gain increased health, damage, and rate of fire. Eventually, they would also gain the ability to self-heal. Veterancy was limited though, only two levels in Tiberian Sun and RA2, and three levels in Generals and later. Units were mostly too fragile to intentionally try to level particular units up, but if a unit did reach a high level it was substantially more powerful than the base unit. Warcraft 3 also had heroes that leveled up, of course, and this was a core mechanic of the game."
truegaming,3cu6ft,Kered13,5,Sun Jul 12 08:10:08 2015 UTC,"Not that it really matters for your point but I wanted to point it out anyways: Red Alert 2 and 3 has a veterancy system, unsure about 1.

I played a ton of DoW2 multiplayer and had the most fun with it.  It was fast paced and I could get through a match in a limited time frame.  Buy I could see why my friends didn't like it.  It reminded me of league of legends...except you were handling the entire five man team yourself.  It took a lot more time investment to get good at it.

That's a new perspective that helps me understand what I hate in CoH2. In CoH 1 it felt like you could really lock down a lot of the area, and it would take a large enough force to take it back that you would likely notice them before they got there, and/or took enough of their production power that you could breakthrough elsewhere.   Now, it feels like you can't really defend anything without physically having units there, which makes you weaker across the board. Basically, it's following a popular trend in RTS(That I despise) of favoring attack heavily to the point where defense is not a valid strategy. You just have 2 attacking forces, one who attacks first."

That's because a strong defense makes for a really, really bad RTS games. You just end up with stalemate situations where neither side can penetrate the other's defenses. Or if defenses can only be beaten with late game units, then you get a really boring build up for 20 minutes before anything interesting can happen because attacking in the first 20 minutes is useless.  A well designed RTS will favor attack over defense at all points in the game, this keeps the game exciting and interesting. Defense is used only for warding off light harassment or buying time while your army repositions, not for allowing you to ignore what's going on in large parts of the map."

I could play through a Campaign with a friend, level up my units and get loot along the way, and we'd each only have to worry about two guys. Admittedly, I would have liked for more factions beyond Spess Mehrines, but they're kinda the go-to faction in W40k, so it makes sense. Did not play MP, so can't talk there  Company of Heroes 2 is alright, but admittedly, I strongly dislike it compared to Men of War. Every time infantry laughs off explosions or machine gun fire, or a tank just eats AT gun fire, or anything like that, it frustrates me. I know it's supposed to be more arcade-y and it's for balance reasons, but after playing MoW, it's really hard for me to overlook that stuff. It's a game I don't mind playing occasionally for a match or two to get some RTS fix, but I don't love it.

truegaming,3cu6ft,Mozgus,5,Sat Jul 11 18:12:59 2015 UTC,"DoW2 wasn't an RTS. It was Real Time Tactical, at least in MP.   That is to say, less macro, more micro. Cover was vital; the right ability at the right time, or the right unit in the right place, completely changed the outcome of engagements.   For example, a fully upgraded chaos marine squad is more expensive than a heavy bolter team. However, the HB team if setup in the right place will halt a tac squad and eventually kill it.   The heavy bolter team is in turn extremely vulnerable to jumping melee units, who in turn are vulnerable to dedicated melee units. Then there are units outside of the rock/paper/scissors paradigm which can grease anything in the right circumstances (i.e plasma devastators, dreadnought).   This is all against a backdrop of cover mechanics (heavy cover being vital to win ranged engagements), artillery and special abilities and multi-role hero units.   To the inexperienced player, it seems like a simple attack-move-with-5 units. To the better players, the plays and counterplays are of extraordinary depth. Good players will come up with tactical plays on the fly, saving units and setting up ambushes to stave off huge armies.   It wasn't helped by a few things - firstly a terrible matchmaking system, and secondly an approach to balance and bugfixing that can only be described as enthusiastically bewildering. Fortunately a few key players stepped up to the mark and have produced a mod which solves a great deal of the balance issues and bugs - Elite Mod.   There are a number of replays you can watch here:  http://www.gamereplays.org/dawnofwar2/videos.php?game=47  These replays are done by commentators that explain what's going on and why it matters - a great way to get a feel for the depth of the game and the work done in the Elite Mod.   Elite mod is more than just balance changes and bug fixes - they've introduced entirely new mechanics, new units, new faction models and even the Grey Knights.   DoW2 is a lot like Skyrim - the original developers no longer give a shit, but the game is better than it has ever been."

truegaming,3cu6ft,Mozgus,3,Sat Jul 11 09:31:30 2015 UTC,"Did you play the single player primarily in DoW2? That sounds like how the single player works. I liked that quite a bit, but didn't like that it was Space Marines only. At least for a long time.   I like DoW1 for exactly the reasons you gave for liking DoW 2, interestingly. In DoW 1, it was more about producing a good group, then setting them in to attack. You didn't really have to micromanage. In DoW2, there's a bunch of level up abilities, active skills, buffs, etc to manage. DoW1 was by no means perfect for low micromanage, but it seems lighter in this regard than 2 to me.   I also primarily played Orks. That might have some influence on my view. In fact, the way that running into melee works in DoW2 is basically my primary issue with the mechanics above all else.  (That is to say, you get shot to hell and break or get wiped out FAAAAAAAR more often in 2 than 1 due to way smaller units for everyone.)"
truegaming,3cu6ft,Portal007,2,Fri Jul 10 20:48:06 2015 UTC,"I get you now. At first I was confused because I thought DoW2 was great because of less micromanaging, even though I loved the first game. Now that you mention it I loved DoW1 skirmishes/multiplayer, and it was probably the only RTS that I was actually good at. In DoW2 the skirmishes/multiplayer is about impossible for me, because you have to keep up with leveling a hundred different units and upgrading their skills and whatnot."
truegaming,3cu6ft,Kered13,2,Fri Jul 10 20:55:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly! On the surface, it seems like less micromanage because it's less troops. But they HAD to lower the troop count since each individual unit is WAY more complicated than in DoW1.   I feel like DoW2 was made entirely around that story mode, and the RTS aspect was secondary. In the single player mode, it works well! It's quite cool to take your squad and develop them as you go.   But the skirmish part, or any aspect with the base buildings (The normal game) falls apart.

It's always one of the worst experiences of my life when I do. I get angry, want to uninstall the game forever, track down and kill the opponent/game developers/anyone. I almost never rage at games, but boy do RTSs his that button in the most unpleasant way. I don't even know if I've ever played a MP match in any RTS that didn't devolve into my opponent exploiting bugs or weak game mechanics to win, either.

I'm sorry, but that's entirely your own fault.  If the game is poorly designed or has poor balance, that's a bad game. You should stop playing those games. Players who exploit bad design to win games are good players."
truegaming,3cu6ft,warbastard,4,Sun Jul 12 04:48:38 2015 UTC,"They understood a core problem of the RTS genre - it is much too complicated for it's own good.  This is exactly why they shifted the scale down and made the fights themselves slower and made it more about area control and managing your units across the map, rather than having to deal with massive macro, while trying to somehow micromanage your troops as well.  The RTS genre is dying, and CoH2 and DoW2 both tried to adapt to that."
truegaming,3cu6ft,Portal007,3,Sun Jul 12 08:03:26 2015 UTC,"The RTS genre is dying   People said that about adventure games too and they are still around. You could say that RTS is suffering from identity crisis like adventure games did.  COH went more focused direction, serving that mp meta in dropping everything non-essential to warfare, but it also lost a lot of that versatility what makes a RTS game. At the same time Banished and some mobile resource managers went totally different direction, dropping warfare and focusing on just survival and incremental advancement.  I'm mostly blaming Blizzard, the torchbearer, for bad management with SC2 that traditional RTS is not doing better currently, biggest mistake being the lack of LAN support."
truegaming,3cu6ft,juicemassive,3,Sat Jul 11 09:42:27 2015 UTC,"Company of Heroes 2 is absolutely fantastic now and has been for most of this year. I have sunk over a hundred hours on that game's multiplayer this year. Balance was rough in the beginning but it is very good now. You do have to micro your units as each squad is important but it plays very differently from Starcraft which I used to play.   What are your specific complaints about the game? I think my only one is pathing for tanks can be buggy and the mg42 might be a tad too strong. I think most of the community is pretty happy with the game and excited for the new expansion. I don't know where you heard otherwise.  And imo, DoW2 > DoW1. DoW2 felt like a warhammer game. Each soldier is powerful and important. DoW1 felt more generic rts to me."
truegaming,3cu6ft,theswerto,4,Tue Jul 14 06:35:49 2015 UTC,"Well, I do think CoH2 is a decent, actually playable game that I have had some fun in AI skirmishes in, which is an improvement to launch. I hate micro though, so in that case it's just us wanting polar opposites.   I have to disagree on the DoW comparison though. 1 felt more like a Warhammer game to me. At least as a base game. Hordes of Orks fighting against dozens of Space Marines. Hundreds of lasguns going off to take down a squiggoth. (and probably failing) Kitting out your squad with various upgrades before sending them into battle. Using units to slog down your opponents elites. It just felt more like the tabletop game.   Compare to DoW2 where a Space Marine might get taken out in one shot, or units of 6 Orks are running around and getting blown away by bolt pistols.   I guess DoW 1 feels more like the epic conflict I imagined when I played my tabletop army or read the books, but DoW 2 is possibly more like the TT game in stats since Orks can totally be blown away by a boltpistol.   More and more I'm starting to reconsider, and maybe my complaint is less that DoW2 sucks overall, and more that it's just terrible at simulating Orks from 40K. I'm also objectively terrible at playing every other race."
truegaming,3cu6ft,CapnBlackLungYARR,2,Fri Jul 10 21:16:15 2015 UTC,Agreed about balance being so much better now. There are still some cheese strats in team games but overall the balance is way better than when OKW were crazy imbalanced.

truegaming,3cu6ft,Osmodius,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:22:34 2015 UTC,Kubels are the game's way of reminding you to spread your squads out.   Current MG42s however are hard to flank without smoke and grenades. They can switch targets so quickly now and suppress really fast.

I think that both are different spins if you will, of the RTS genre, the former being more ""traditional"" (base building, higher unit count, research, etc) and the latter being a whole different beast of a game considering its focus on heroes and micro'ing abilities and wut not while still retaining a lot of the underpinnings of a relic style rts (cap points for currency, squad based units, emphasis on offense, etc). It seems most people prefer one over the other and I think thats to be expected given how different they both play."
truegaming,3cu6ft,testikron,2,Sat Jul 11 03:51:29 2015 UTC,DoW2 is an amazing squad-based RTS. I don't understand how you can't like it as a non RTS fan because it boils things down to an extremely basic level and gets rid of the whole base-building aspect. The story modes were fantastic.   But shrug whatever.  I'm still hoping Relic under SEGA are able to make a proper Dawn of War 3 before SEGA hands the title over to the Total War guys.

truegaming,3cpfth,TheManInsideMe,190,Thu Jul 9 18:43:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed, collecting all the riddler trophies should be something to get achievements /trophies and some extras IMO. Even if they had put a minimum in order to fight him I would be ok, but getting all of them seems like too much"
truegaming,3cpfth,DiegoMoBa,65,Thu Jul 9 18:56:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed, especially considering the fact that there is a perfectly reasonable quest line involving the Riddler and Catwoman that would have been perfectly fine as a ""Most Wanted"" storyline to unlock the ending. Just leave the collection of riddler trophies as a side objective for those who really want to take the time to do it."
truegaming,3cpfth,freekill,39,Thu Jul 9 19:10:48 2015 UTC,"I mean, there's literally a boss fight with the Riddler in his big mech suit at the end of the Catwoman quest line.  I was pretty peeved even at that point when he just pulls a 180 mid-fight, and all of the sudden I have to collect all of his stupid trophies to finish him off? I felt like that was bullshit.  Riddler was by far the most annoying villain in the game (as usual), with the 30-45 second elevator monologues both ways on the Batmobile challenge missions.  By the end of his quest line I was really looking forward to a good ol' fashioned Arkham 'spam X' beatdown cutscene followed by a Batmobile trip, like every single other side villain in the game.    Don't get me wrong, I had a pretty good time with the game overall (though I don't think it compares to Asylum or City), but when I later found out that to get the 'true' ending I'd still have to do all the Riddler trophies I was just as mad.  I didn't even consider it for a second, it's just not worth the time it would take me to do that.  The funny thing is, I actually did get all of the trophies in Arkham City.  That was one of my favorite games of all time and I spent hours in-game even after I beat the campaign just doing the challenge maps and 100%-ing the main game.  But with the way it seemed like it was forced on me in Arkham Knight I had no interest whatsoever in completing it."

Devs feel pressured to deliver hours and hours of content, but when you're trying to build a strong narrative-driven game, delivering a game ""long enough to justify spending $60"" means loads and loads of padding. I think it's even worse in Batman's case by locking the ending behind it. Many older games had this sort of ending added only upon completing these kinds of challenges, but they were supplemental, epilogues and the like, never really has it been the actual end of the story..."
truegaming,3cpfth,dogger6253,11,Fri Jul 17 07:50:04 2015 UTC,"You can go back to games like the original Rayman on PS1 for things like this also.  You played levels (which were short) but you couldn't get everywhere at first because your skills weren't leveled up far enough or unlocked yet.  So you could finish the game, but if you wanted to explore everything you had to go back and play some of the levels again once you had all of your powers. Which was an interesting mechanic for a platformer... but the same thing drives me nuts when playing RPGs.    Having said that I do enjoy RPGs that have higher level enemies in different areas.  So if you try and fight in certain places before you should be you can get wrecked if you aren't careful.  Excessive pockets of difficulty can be an annoying mechanic.  Looking at you Dragon Age 3.  Fight a camp... win.  Go to next camp... whole team gets one hit murdered.  Seriously?"
truegaming,3cpfth,battlebattlehooah,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:31:10 2015 UTC,"the original Rayman   Your little anecdote reminds me of Sonic Colors. The first time you go through the game you slowly unlock more abilities and have more opportunities to explore and feel your way around the game. After you beat the game once, if you go back and play every single level you'll now have so many more options to choose from that the game becomes several times larger in comparison. The game never required you to do this, though, which made it pretty exciting to figure out for myself. I actually went and found every single red star ring in the game because it reminded me of hunting for powerups in Metroid by tasking me to use my new powers to explore previous areas in ways I couldn't previously."

To be honest, I set down The Witcher 3 last week to finish a replay of Bloodborne and I don't know if I'm ever going to pick it up. If the story were more compelling, I probably would because I can't help myself when it comes to good stories, but that game is dense, tiresome, and kind of aimless in many ways so I might just never go back."
truegaming,3cpfth,dogger6253,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:55:06 2015 UTC,This is why I'm not feeling the need to buy Witcher 3 and GTAV (not even sure I ever will considering my backlog).  I've been sitting at 50% on Red Dead Redemption for over a year and still have the unopened MGS Legacy Collection vying for my attention.  So many games...
truegaming,3cpfth,untildeath,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:08:27 2015 UTC,"At least with MGS those games aren't very long... I'm actually replaying through MGS Legacy myself to lead up to the release of 5. So far, it's been perfect. My girlfriend and I carve aside 2-3 hours a night and easily finish during the week. We will likely take a break and binge through Arkham Knight, so as to break up the MGS-fest.    I see where you're coming at with Red Dead and GTA V, but those games were ones I felt had significantly more interesting characters and significantly more compelling narratives than Witcher has. GTA V side stuff was kind of distracting, but it didn't pull from the main plot so much. With The Witcher it's like all of the side stuff is more interesting than the main plotline so the whole game becomes an aimless look at the life of a professional hunter who refuses to participate in moral decisions. It's impossible to empathize with Geralt and I tried making him more sympathetic by way of the choices I made when given the option, but there hasn't been any satisfying payoff, no moral epiphany. I know it's not an American style of storytelling, much more in line with the great epics of the ancient world and medieval world, but those kinds of stories don't resonate the same way as the now quintessential Hollywood 3-act structure. They just can't hit me as hard..."

truegaming,3cpfth,untildeath,27,Fri Jul 10 15:11:08 2015 UTC,And yet Witcher 3 was able to put over 100 hours of the best narrative gaming has ever seen in it with minimal padding. Sure... There are some easy fetch quests here or there but nothing like riddler trophies.

truegaming,3cpfth,Sprinter220,30,Fri Jul 10 15:29:23 2015 UTC,"I thin Witcher 3 quests taken as separate from the whole are incredibly well written and realized, but as a whole work, that game is a narrative mess. I couldn't care less about the main plot line because there are so many things that distract from it. The recaps when you load in only help so much. I don't think they were too concerned with the storytelling on the fairly rote A Plot, but if I'm expected to be compelled by it, it just doesn't hold up after 100 hours."
truegaming,3cpfth,dogger6253,29,Thu Jul 9 19:14:05 2015 UTC,I totally disagree. The deep side quests were adventures in itself. At no point I felt that I had lost or forgotten the main story line it all evolved around.

I think I just over did it. Don't get me wrong, greatest fucking game in AGES, I just burned myself out."
truegaming,3cpfth,Royed,3,Fri Jul 10 05:37:31 2015 UTC,"There comes a point in the main story where the game reminds you to save, and it locks you in for like 2 hours.

truegaming,3cpfth,ovoon,2,Fri Jul 10 05:40:19 2015 UTC,"I think it's due to a fact, that the game is really saturated with content and is very VERY long. Other devs might've broken it into several releases over the years or at least into major DLCs, but CDPR didn't. So you have to pace it yourself, take breaks from the game after completing major arc.  For example, after arriving at Skellige, I took a week and a half off a game, because I felt, that 70+ hours is enough for me at this time. But when I rested I didn't go and buy a new game to complete, I just returned to Witcher.  In that sense Witcher 3 is unique in today's market. Most of games are up to 10 hours in length (besides collecting hidden items), so we kinda expect a game to be paced for us in such a way, that by the time we get tired of it the game is already completed. Well, not with the 200+ hours narrative-driven game! :)"
truegaming,3cpfth,pycbouh,2,Fri Jul 10 05:42:37 2015 UTC,"Well said. And yes, Skellige is right around where this break happened."
truegaming,3cpfth,Royed,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:45:30 2015 UTC,Skellige is weird.  The game constantly suggests to you to stay in Velen because that's where Ciri was.  And so I spend countless hours there only to get to Skellige and be overleveled by quite a bit.  That's really my only major criticism of the game.  You do what the game instructs you to do and continually find more content in Velen while you're ruining content that you haven't gotten to becuase the game doesn't pace the content at all.  It feels like there should have been a lock on some of the content available in Velen until you at least visit Skellige.  Otherwise you really can end up feeling like the game is way too broad and keeps you away from the Main Quest for a long time.
truegaming,3cpfth,Drakengard,5,Fri Jul 10 06:41:32 2015 UTC,"Rpgs are way easier to create content for. Not really fair comparisons to an action game. By nature, everything takes way longer in an rpg"

truegaming,3cpfth,The-Dudemeister,16,Sat Jul 11 18:10:34 2015 UTC,"The majority of the optional gameplay in the TW3 is repetitive ""find things in open areas,"" ""follow monster tracks,"" and ""listen to peasants whine."" You're really overselling it here.  (Below is a rant unrelated to the topic of side-quest padding.)  Also if this is the best narrative gaming has ever seen, that really says a lot about how bad narrative in gaming is. The story of this game is pulp fantasy writing with ham-fisted grimdarkness and ""racism"" (which, from what I've played, barely even comes up in this installment). Chasing a teen across the monster-filled wastes of this world is not compelling drama, and the character interactions and development that fill out this journey are only a step above TV shows on The CW. [edit] It's ""deep"" because people die and have selfish motivations, as if that's all that it takes to qualify for good character writing. Most of the drama, however, is motivated by ""pure evil"" in the form of monsters, which has little narrative value when it's used literally dozens of times in a row.  However, good thing it's not the best, since Knight of the Old Republic is better in every way (narratively speaking) and its gameplay is only slightly more monotonous than TW3.  [edit] For anyone downvoting this, I bet there's a good chance you've seen at least one HBO series. Until a game has writing that good, there's no need to get wet in the pants over it."

To the main point, since I kind of derailed there, if you wanna 100% TW3, I'd say there's about as much padding as an Arkham game, maybe a bit less. At least 40-50 hours of non-repetitive quest content, though, so that's nice. I can't deny I compulsively went to a lot of question marks on the map until I got to Skelige and realized just how irrational that was."
truegaming,3cpfth,symon_says,4,Fri Jul 10 04:52:01 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is it can be very hard to make a solid complex narrative in even very linear stories, because large swathes of content can be cut for time or whatever. In a book you go and alter the existing story to account for that. In a game it's not just the story that needs altering. Lines might have to be re-recorded. Animations and levels re-done etc. So the stories end up being quite segmented and basic, so that individual quests and chunks can be cut without completely breaking the story flow."
truegaming,3cpfth,Carr0t,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:02:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah from what I've read, this has happened to a lot of games.  The Assassin's Creed series being one of them.

truegaming,3cpfth,TwentySixRed,3,Thu Jul 9 23:09:52 2015 UTC,"I would say W3 has more padding than AK simply because it's a much larger game.

For as good as Witcher is, I do find the ""go here to talk to person X, then come back to talk to me"" quest shapes to be not my cup of tea.

Creating a good story in a movie is easy, you get set designers to build a set or create a green-screen and off you go.  In a game world it's quite a dev intensive task building everything.  And bugs take ages.  Story and narrative seem to get cut down to hit a release date.  I read a reddit once from a game dev who'd worked on the Assassin's Creed series, he mentioned how much stuff got cut out of the game because they ran out of time and money and had to cobble together what they had and launch.  Some of the stuff they had planned story-wise sounded really good, it would have made the games so much better story wise.  They even chopped entire levels and missions."
truegaming,3cpfth,TwentySixRed,4,Wed Jul 15 13:05:34 2015 UTC,"Well I guess that's like...your opinion, man.   In seriousness, I laugh at the idea of KOTOR having a superior narrative when compared to witcher 3,  but I suppose there's no accounting for taste. Much as I love Kotor, I play it once a  year and the writing and plot is not always superb. It was classic star wars, which, while beautiful,  is not a narrative masterpiece in my opinion.  Kotor 2 was far more compelling in that regard, which comes as no surprise considering Obsidian was at the helm. I personally don't think witcher relies on overused grimdark,  and while racism is an important part of the games story, what's wrong with that? It's a difficult thing to deal with. Also, I call your HBO bluff with this year's season of GOT. I've played a few games better written than that mess,  which is a shame considering the source material. Witcher 3 ain't perfect, and again no real arguing taste, but for me it does represent one of the best, if not the best, combinations of story and gameplay I've ever experienced."

truegaming,3cpfth,TwentySixRed,2,Wed Jul 15 13:03:31 2015 UTC,"I bet there's a good chance you've seen at least one HBO series   I was just binging the first season of The Wire this week because its been a couple years and I wanted to finally finish Season 2. I'm still shocked at the level of moral and ethical complexity the show has even in its opening moments. The closest I've ever felt to that in a game is maybe The Walking Dead (1st season), but that's about it. Almost every ""story-focused"" game is either filled with so many options that none of them really mean anything to me, or they're so restricted and straightforward that they're just an excuse for the gameplay (which is fine, really, but it depends on the game and how prominent the story is). In TWD, even though ""none of your choices really matter"" as people say, having to make them introduced a level of personal, moral ambiguity that I've never experienced in a game before, and it was so refreshing. I completely agree with your sentiments here, though I've never played TW3. I just believe that nobody really knows what ""good"" characters and story are, so anything slightly peeking over the top of ""par for the course"" is considered ""amazing"" these days. Even TWD wasn't exactly Shakespeare, so to speak, even though I loved it."

truegaming,3cpfth,symon_says,-3,Fri Jul 10 06:01:20 2015 UTC,"I'm shocked that someone who is saying ""The Witcher 3 is not literally Jesus"" is still standing in /r/truegaming. My issues with it lie more in the protagonist being a horribly-written character (Geralt is almost totally devoid of any likability, flaws, emotions and pretty much any relatable qualities), the unfriendliness of the story to newcomers (despite playing both previous games, I STILL wasn't sure what was going on) and general, awfully slow pacing. The open-world serves the game well, as do the monster-hunting quests, but Witcher 3 really doesn't give me a lot of incentive beyond ""Because it's fun"" to run out of my way and do stuff.  Shadow of Mordor operated much better. Side missions were dynamic, fun, and offered incentives to do them. For one thing, the skill tree was much better-designed than Witcher 3, which offers less than half a dozen really good skill upgrades and makes the rest just boring, MMO-style talent trees (which Blizzard was smart enough to dump years ago in favour of a more creative, personalized talent system); Shadow of Mordor's upgrades provide tangible benefits like new ways to use your weapons (brutalize kills, instant combo kills, fire arrows, teleportation executions, etc) that served to make the player feel like they were evolving their gameplay in a way that was more significant than a percentage sheet. This kind of design gave me a reason to go out of my way and hunt down orc captains.  I'll certainly agree with you that KOTOR was doing better at general story and character interactions all the way back in 2003, and still holds up fairly well today despite the post-polygon era graphics."
truegaming,3cpfth,Rekthor,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:35:48 2015 UTC,"Shadow of mordor honestly seems almost incomparable to witcher 3.  I mean, I loved the shit out of it, but the ""sidequests"" were procedurally generated orc events which, while interesting,  got quite repetitive. And I firmly believe the games skill system was utter shite because the best part of the game, the nemesis system, by nature punished the skilled or powerful by never presenting a threat. I intentionally gimped myself in a second play through just to account for this."

Ended up quitting there and not going back for awhile.  Later, I ended up seeing that video where a guy rolls an entire area by holding spacebar down.    I like the combat in Witcher 3.  There are a lot of flaws, but I have fun.   I did read that the difficulty goes downhill past level 10 or so, but I found a pretty great mod that should fix it."

truegaming,3cpfth,Dead_Skull,12,Fri Jul 10 15:12:59 2015 UTC,"""True"" is a misnomer here, a real True Ending is more like a Visual Novel format where there's multiple stories but only one that the creators consider canon for the series (which doesn't exclude the other endings from being canon in spinoffs or whatever).  In Batman, there is an ending. It continues as you approach and obtain 100% completion. It's like    Ending A: Billy goes to the store Ending B: Billy goes to the store, and gets shot Ending C: Billy goes to the store, and gets shot, and dies"
truegaming,3cpfth,SadSniper,26,Thu Jul 9 19:48:36 2015 UTC,I like the way most Kingdom Hearts games do it. Multiple difficulties. The least difficult option requires 100% completion to view the extra movie. Less requirements if you choose a higher difficulty.  It tests your skill rather than your patience.
truegaming,3cpfth,UnknownStory,6,Thu Jul 9 20:48:31 2015 UTC,"This is probably the best thing about the KH games in my opinion. While it's a bit ruined by YouTube nowadays, it was a really novel idea a couple generations ago. It wasn't overcomplicated or padded; it just said, hey, you need to learn to play the game better. Plus, I consider Critical the only real way to play most KH games anyway, though I tend to start out on Proud first and get a feel for it as the difficulty is highly inconsistent between games."
truegaming,3cpfth,Sloshy42,10,Fri Jul 10 04:59:35 2015 UTC,"Jet Force Gemini did this, wherein you couldn't go to the last level without rescuing all the Tribals on every planet, which was extremely difficult in some cases. Personally, the Riddler trophies have the added value of extra content in a lot of cases that I enjoy, and they're usually pretty creatively done so I have fun finding them. I 100%'d Arkham Asylum twice because of how much fun this was, so maybe I just like that style.   I don't think it's unbridled bullshit, I just think it's a piece of the game that appeals to a certain kind of gamer that likes a piece of what is a pretty diverse set of gameplay mechanics. The fact that the end of Asylum is a slapfight with a Hulk-Joker felt more like unbridled bullshit to me."
truegaming,3cpfth,The_Shmef,8,Thu Jul 9 20:06:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think OP is saying the trophies shouldn't be there or that completing them shouldn't have some type of tangible reward: character skins, Batmobile skins, challenge maps, achievements, etc. These are all acceptable rewards.   But Arkham Knight is the first game in the series that literally chops off part of the ending cinematic and tells you you have to do the Riddler collectathon to unlock it. That is the unbridled bullshit he's referring to and I have to agree."
truegaming,3cpfth,darkpassenger9,8,Fri Jul 10 06:04:37 2015 UTC,"I'm sort of torn on the issue. Personally, as a player I know I don't have the patience to try and find all the Riddler trophies, so the fact that the actual end of the game is hidden behind this barrier is somewhat disappointing, because it means if I were to play AK it is an ending that I'd never see, and as the OP said, going to YouTube to see the real ending would make me feel like I wasted my time playing the game at all since when I play a Batman game I'm after the story first and foremost.  That being said, collecting all the trophies is a tremendous time investment and a person who does that should receive some sort of reward for doing so... It is just so weird to structure a story this way. I am sure that the devs have statistics pointing to how many players actually 100% the game, so it is curious that they would put the conclusion to the game behind such a hurtle. Aren't developers always complaining that players so very rarely see all the content they create anyways?"
truegaming,3cpfth,SenatorBeers,2,Thu Jul 9 18:54:01 2015 UTC,"That being said, collecting all the trophies is a tremendous time investment and a person who does that should receive some sort of reward for doing so   Well, if you think about it, the entire idea behind most ""achievements"" in gaming is pretty arbitrarily defined. For example, I believe there was one for a GTA game where you had to shoot every single pigeon in the city. If you could do that, hey, that's dedication I guess, but does that really deserve a reward? Furthermore, in many ways these things can become little more than a list of chores or a checklist. After a certain point in many games, you'll find that you're just ""getting it over with"" instead of genuinely trying to have fun. Any game with an achievement hunt like this eventually loses me partway through because I'm not doing these things for myself; I'm doing them because the game tells me to, and that's not helping me spend my time wisely at all.  Ideally, I believe that the ""reward"" for investing time into a game should just be the game itself. Take Monster Hunter for example. You can play those games for hundreds of hours and still have fun because of the base gameplay being so dynamic and widely varying from minute to minute. I'm just about at 60 hours in MH4U and I've put over a hundred or two into 3U before that, and that's just because I love playing the game. I don't care about collecting every single weapon or armor set or anything like that. The games do have achievements for long-winded goals, but your only ""reward"" is just a note saying you did it."
truegaming,3cpfth,Sloshy42,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:10:24 2015 UTC,"I don't get the negative feelings about watching endings on Youtube. I can see not doing that if you're going to go for the challenge, but if you deemed the challenge to not be fun or worth it to you I think Youtubing the ending is a great way to get the content without having to bang your head against the wall. I've never done the Riddler content, so I've used Youtube to get that content since the first game. Hell, I even took it a step further and used Youtube to listen to all of the inmate and Dr. Arkham tapes because I just didn't find any fun or value in hunting around trying to collect that stuff."
truegaming,3cpfth,jacobi123,14,Thu Jul 9 19:16:04 2015 UTC,If there weren't so many of them it wouldn't have been a problem. There were quite a few though that I ended up resorting to videos because I was just to tired to figure them out and just wanted to finish them. A vast majority of them were just simply come and pick it up which was kind of stupid imo.  Forcing the players however to 100% your game I feel isn't a good design. I wasn't that big into the racing sections and I would of preferred to have skipped them if I could.
truegaming,3cpfth,Nathorus86,14,Fri Jul 10 06:10:27 2015 UTC,"I agree, i think maybe 100 trophies would be fine. Then each one can be an interesting challenge or riddle.  As it is, 243...it's just...demoralising...  And a large number of them are simply padding and aren't attached to any kind of ""riddle"" by any definition of the word.  I finished the game, did all the side quests and a pretty large amount of exploration. I think I have...50 trophies?? I can't honestly be arsed to go back into the game and search for all of them."

Yet in principle, both tasks are largely similar.   Interesting point."

Name me a few games that actually do this: Open world games with 100+ collect-a-thons that let you reach the end of the main campaign and then make you finish all of the sidequests before giving you and ending. Remember, 100% completion of all content is required before you get the ending as part of the criteria.  If you can find any they'll be the exception and not the rule. This really is crap, and between this expectation and the terrible batmobile I have zero desire to go back and finish the game."
truegaming,3cpfth,NotSafeForShop,0,Fri Jul 10 00:43:52 2015 UTC,"Look at the comments. People are naming all kinds of games that did this. Jedi Force Gemini, Kirby's Dreamland 2, Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards, various Sonic games, Donkey Kong 64... There's likely far more, too.  It used to be a big thing in old games. It's just that nowadays games are more story-driven, so people play it to find the ending, not to just play and possibly end up getting an ending."
truegaming,3cpfth,hanhange,2,Fri Jul 10 01:39:51 2015 UTC,"Huh? None of those games lock out the ending to a story behind collection walls. Hell, Kirby 2 is notorious for being a bitch to 100%. Secret endings are one thing (donkey kong). What we're talking about here is the main ending."
truegaming,3cpfth,NotSafeForShop,2,Thu Jul 9 22:03:28 2015 UTC,"None of those games   IIRC, you actually did have to rescue all the tribals in Jet Force Gemini to get the main ending.  It could also be argued that the ending you get for 100%ing Crystal Shards is the true ending."

truegaming,3cpfth,cxtv92,13,Thu Jul 9 22:57:09 2015 UTC,"I get the complaint, but he loses me when he says they're ""notoriously difficult to find."" They're right there labeled on your map for you to find (sure, you have to interrogate the informants, but those spawn near you regularly). The Arkham games have the easiest-to-find collectibles in any game. There's an argument that they're time consuming and not the kind of gameplay some people want to do to have to finish the game (I personally thought they were fun, but collectibles have generally just been bonuses in other games), but it's not like collectibles in some old games where you'll find 99 of something and number 100 could be anywhere in the world. You don't need a guide to 100% this game."
truegaming,3cpfth,seluropnek,3,Fri Jul 10 05:20:25 2015 UTC,"I think they're good, I wanted more. I enjoy puzzles and riddler trophies generally deliver there. Only ones on AK I found a bit tricky were the batmobile wifi things, sometimes the ?s looked like they just stopped."
truegaming,3cpfth,Redhavok,3,Thu Jul 9 19:12:44 2015 UTC,Yeah the one that went through the sewer stumped me for a bit. Even though they aren't for everybody you've got to give them credit for going beyond just scattering the city with collectibles. There's nothing too tough but there's a lot of variety.
truegaming,3cpfth,seluropnek,2,Thu Jul 9 21:27:23 2015 UTC,"Yup that one and the one you need to ramp jump to get, I thought it was just unresponsive. Probably would have been a bit better if the ?s were permanent for a few reasons, firstly it would look quite cool to go past, you could stumble upon them by playing with the scanner, and it would let you get out and have a little look around to figure out where the next is.  Exactly it's not just jump at gold coin, you have 7/7 gold coins well done. All the ones with CW were pretty decent, that color one was pretty tough but simple in concept, some of the robot ones were neat(the time reversal thing was a bit odd, maybe just dispense a new robot), plenty of memorable ones to tip the scale.   Of course there were a few simple pick up ones, but most require knowledge of your abilities and gadgets, which is what most games should aspire to really. I think a big problem is people see it as a sidequest but if it tied into the main quest it makes more sense, like any other game you are just solving some kind of puzzle to progress, Batman just has to do more thinking than Kratos."
truegaming,3cpfth,Redhavok,3,Thu Jul 9 23:59:08 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't understand why people are appalled that they wanted to give something cool for people who do everything they gave us to do. If you don't want to do sidequests then don't. The point was to stop scarecrow and you did it.
truegaming,3cpfth,SadSniper,5,Fri Jul 10 00:18:26 2015 UTC,"I understand the frustration of many people but honestly the riddles are one of my favourite things about the Arkham series and I actually think they're too easy. I preferred Arkham Asylum's way of mapping them by having a floating ? roughly where the riddle is, not giving you the exact location. I'm playing as Batman, the world's greatest detective, I expect and want to be challenged with puzzles to make me feel more immersed. And I really appreciate that my efforts get rewarded with something more significant than a trophy/achievement but that's just my opinion"
truegaming,3cpfth,KingOfSomeThings,2,Fri Jul 10 03:18:11 2015 UTC,"When they cut down from 440 to 243 they implied they would be a lot tougher. They were still good but not tough. I don't get how 243 riddles mostly done with puzzle solving is worse than collecting 10 billion feathers and chests in AC games, or what 120 stars in Mario64?, or 900 billion useless objects in Just Cause 2, everything ever in Terraria or Minecraft... to me it seems like they made all the collecting stuff more interesting than other games handle it"
truegaming,3cpfth,Redhavok,7,Fri Jul 10 05:10:01 2015 UTC,"As a general rule I agree with you that you shouldn't need to 100% a game to see the real ending.  In the case of Arkham Knight, however, the trophies/informants are dead easy to find and by knowing this would be the end for Batman I wound up naturally wanting to complete all the side quests first. I liked a lot that the game had natural pauses where you were told ""now would be a good time to do some side quests!"" rather than constantly trying to push you towards the main storyline, without actually forcing you to do one or the other."
truegaming,3cpfth,itchytf,2,Thu Jul 9 20:07:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah i noticed that, However I felt as though the main story had such a great sense of urgency that it was pretty tough to just ignore it to do side missions."
truegaming,3cpfth,GregorSD,3,Fri Jul 10 00:03:39 2015 UTC,"I'm a completionist so I would have gotten the trophies anyway just like in previous Arkham games, and being rewarded for getting them this time just made it better, so I think it was great."
truegaming,3cpfth,Rodolfo619,3,Thu Jul 9 21:38:13 2015 UTC,But they aren't really all that difficult to find....scan the rioters and interrogate the green guys. If you set a waypoint to the green question marks on your map it takes you to EXACTLY where they are.

truegaming,3cpfth,Redhavok,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:28:47 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't that they are hard to find it is that are 240 of the damn things on top of a reason Riddler campaign.

And there is pragmatic Batman ""first things first"" Batman, who gets to experience another outcome.  Can't have the dragon-slayer ending without slaying a dragon.  ANd while I can understand that certain parts of a game are not for everyone, I actually believe that giving ""doing side stuff"" narrative meaning is a good thing, rather than confronting the player with the question ""why am I doing this optional stuff, if I get nothing out of it, in terms of the world presented.""  If you aren't meticulous, never-rests Batman, why not be fine with the corresponding ending?"
truegaming,3cpfth,DaHolk,3,Fri Jul 10 11:35:19 2015 UTC,"Did they patch this out?   By the time I reached two questlines left to complete, I got the option to trigger the full ending - basically, I'm at like 96% complete right now and it's letting me stop whenever I feel like it.  I'll go ahead and do all the Riddler shit because it gives me something to do while I listen to podcasts, but if I wanted to skip it I feel like I could"
truegaming,3cpfth,otwall,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:05:36 2015 UTC,Nope.  I'm seriously hoping they do though.  It's a major problem I'd the entire canonical ending is hidden for completionists only.
truegaming,3cpfth,jiodjflak,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:37:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for sure. The ending is way too good to lock up behind a couple hundred riddler trophies.   Though it was definitely a nice treat compared to what you got for doing all the riddles in Origins."
truegaming,3cpfth,otwall,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:21:32 2015 UTC,I resorted to watching it on youtube.  No way in hell I'm going to spend countless hours doing all that busywork just for an extra couple of minutes

AA and AC both had a lot more 'skill based' trophy puzzles, these are pretty much 100% thinking puzzles way down on the difficulty scale."
truegaming,3cpfth,sleepybrett,2,Fri Jul 17 15:50:03 2015 UTC,"As someone who completed the game 100%, I do agree that forcing you to gather every single Riddler trophy is excessive. At the same time, the trophies aren't all that difficult to get (much easier than the previous game imo), and I actually had a lot of fun figuring out most of the puzzles. Do I think they should be required to see the ""true"" ending? Probably not. Do I think they were nice to have in the game? Sure."
truegaming,3cpfth,Vahti,2,Fri Jul 17 15:53:25 2015 UTC,"It took me about an hour each island to get all the riddles after getting 25% not going out of my way and just solving the easy stuff in front of me.  I think there's no problem with gating endings behind completion walls. If you're the type of gamer who will only do the ""main quest"" then I don't know why you'd be mad that there's something more if you refuse to do the sidequests anyways. They can let you pay for it if you prefer an easy route."
truegaming,3cpfth,SadSniper,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:46:19 2015 UTC,"What if, because you didn't complete all the riddler trophies, you can't  get the true ending? Either it's just as legitimate or there's a double standard."

truegaming,3cpfth,SadSniper,2,Fri Jul 10 04:45:47 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of offering a more complete ending if you finish all of the side missions before finishing the game, but I do think having the Riddler trophies as a requirement was overkill.  I always 100% the Arkham games, so I would have found all of the Riddler trophies any way, so I didn't mind too much. I was really keen to see how the game ended as I was at the very final story mission while collecting the Riddler trophies, but I stuck with it.   I'm glad I did as I got to see the full ending (without cheating and watching it on YouTube) and it now means I can focus my time on finishing New Game +, instead of driving around for more trophies.   I just need to finish New Game + and I'll have the platinum trophy for the game."
truegaming,3cpfth,Rhinne,2,Fri Jul 10 11:10:14 2015 UTC,"It's not even fair apparently. My brother went for the platinum trophy without using any guides, and it turned out he can't get a certain Riddler trophy because he chose the wrong upgrade path."
truegaming,3cpfth,MrJoobJoob,2,Fri Jul 10 13:32:59 2015 UTC,"I don't see it as being any different than older games that used to require beating them on higher difficulties in order to play the full game. Annoying, yes, but I guess each developer has to decide if putting up artificial obstacles to prevent someone from experiencing the full story is truly worth it."
truegaming,3cpfth,VanceFerguson,5,Fri Jul 10 09:55:50 2015 UTC,I don't really see why people who want to play the game longer shouldn't get some narrative content. Just the same way as players who only play 2 hours don't get to complain that it's silly that they have to play more to see the rest of the cutscenes.  Did you not like the ending that they showed you?
truegaming,3cpfth,OccupyGravelpit,0,Fri Jul 10 14:18:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly?  The ending they show for not getting 100% is obviously not the entire ending and you are definitely left hanging.  For the final game in a trilogy, yeah, I'd say I didn't particularly like the ending they showed me.   I don't really see why people who want to play the game longer shouldn't get some narrative content.   Sure, sounds fair.  Except, why does that narrative content have to be the actual ending of the game?   Just the same way as players who only play 2 hours don't get to complain that it's silly that they have to play more to see the rest of the cutscenes.   I'm 100% positive that if you thought about this for just a second, you would see how ridiculous this statement is.  There's no way you could actually think this is a worthwhile comparison.  It's not even remotely the same thing."
truegaming,3cpfth,runtheplacered,2,Sat Jul 11 06:26:48 2015 UTC,"You don't need a comparison, you could straight up say why do players who won't finish the game deserve the final ending? There's not really a great argument that bumps against the whole thing.  The alternative is they could make you pay for it, which is a (arguably) shitty thing a lot of games do nowadays. You unlock things by playing the game? Blasphemous."
truegaming,3cpfth,SadSniper,2,Thu Jul 9 19:36:28 2015 UTC,"Disagree, I've almost never bothered to try to 100% a game, Arkham City was the first game I ever 100%, I got all the riddler trophies for fun, never having been a completionist here, It was not that difficult IMO."
truegaming,3cpfth,FlyingFall,4,Thu Jul 9 20:36:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe not difficult, but it is time consuming, and if that time hunting down riddles isn't fun, the consumed time feels all the worse. Now, I don't have the same complaint as the OP, because I have no problem using Youtube because I didn't want to hunt down those riddles.   Even though it isn't my thing, I think 100% a game should absolutely reward players with something. But I think that no matter what that is (a new skin, a new item, a new playable character, some narrative content) I think people would be upset that they had to 100% a game to get access to that stuff. So developers will never please everyone when it comes to this."
truegaming,3cpfth,jacobi123,4,Fri Jul 10 05:29:13 2015 UTC,"Kirby's Dream Land 2 and Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards both did this.  I actually think some Sonic games did this, too, requiring you get all of the Chaos Emeralds.   You can call it what you will, but it's been done before several times. It isn't the best design, but it's never caused any notable uproar before."
truegaming,3cpfth,KingPengu1n,13,Thu Jul 9 22:50:23 2015 UTC,"There were 7 Chaos Emeralds in Sonic 2, not 243."

truegaming,3cpfth,NoMoreBirds,7,Thu Jul 9 18:58:28 2015 UTC,and the game is also a fraction of the length. I doubt anyone was playing sonic once and putting it down forever.. it was meant to be replayed.

No sidequests are broken either, everything is still available by the post-game."
truegaming,3cpfth,Redhavok,2,Thu Jul 9 20:16:29 2015 UTC,"Crash Bandicoot, Jak, and Spyro also do this  Is it really a crime to have you complete the game before you see the ending? you are rewarded for completing the game, if you get everything after the ending what should you be rewarded with? if the plot ties up does that end the plot for playing the game anyway? like if the sidequest is fighting the red monsters, but the story makes all the monsters leave then you can't do it anyway, so it kind of depends."

truegaming,3cpfth,TrptJim,2,Thu Jul 9 19:47:27 2015 UTC,"Some of the greatest games ever released are short. Portal and Portal 2 both come to mind. Concise, but they have a complete package.   More and more it seems like game developers are scared to have a short game. So instead of taking time and expanding the game in meaningful ways, they find ways to increase play time with relatively little work involved.  A good example is Skyrim. Skyrim gets a lot of hate specifically for the dungeons. There's the joke that every quest in Skyrim is to go to a crypt and some draugr. There is a good amount of truth to it. Almost as if they were an afterthought. Just to pad the game."
truegaming,3cpfth,candeeman,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:24:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's fair to call them some of the greatest games ever. Portal was ok, it had an interesting mechanic and the narration was sometimes funny. Plus we are still in the early days of gaming, we have a long way to go.  Completely agree with Skyrim though, even Oblivion had insanely heavy padding, Skyrim was 80% padding at least. I liked playing Oblivion, but Morrowind is definitely the tightest of them that I have played."
truegaming,3cpfth,Redhavok,2,Fri Jul 10 03:54:46 2015 UTC,"They way Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 did it was really cool. In KH1, If you did EVERYTHING, All of the Secret bosses, find all 101 puppys, find and use all of the trinity marks it unlocked a special little teaser at the end of the game.   What made this cool as opposed to frustration was the game's ending is satisfying without the teaser. Granted in the first game in it's in a very ""and the adventure continues!"" sort of way, but still.  KH2 did something very similar to this though I don't remember all of it's requirements. HOWEVER, it added another way of unlocking that game's teaser. Beat the game on Proud (Hard) mode.  I like the idea of having special ""treats"" given to you for 100%ing a game. I don't know if with Arkham Knight it's a case of ""If you want the Canon ending, ya better 100% the game"" or not though."
truegaming,3cpfth,Ardailec,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:06:18 2015 UTC,Yah this happened before but with kingdom hearts 2 getting a 100 percent was so fucking tedious but it was the only way to see the secret kingdom hearts 3 teaser.

truegaming,3cpfth,scrollbreak,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:58:58 2015 UTC,"This strikes me as a ridiculous way of padding out the game.   Reminds me of the 100% completion rate for Final Fantasy X-2, because I'm playing through the HD Remaster right now. In order to get 100% and the Perfect Ending, you have to obviously do everything, including the Via Infinito floors in the game's last chapter. 100 floors, of which the last 25 or so consist of boss-tier enemies, eventually turning into enemies that require significant grinding. The final bosses on the last floor are a back to back fight.   I nearly completed it without grinding, after three playthroughs and 3 Catnip accessories, which allows you to always do 9,999 damage, provided you are in critical health. Despite this, it was still impossible, because even though boss 1 died instantly, boss 2 had more health and ridiculous speed, resulting in him just killing my party after my first turn."
truegaming,3cpfth,Grammaton485,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:29:36 2015 UTC,"There are other games that did similar things and I completely agree. One example that I remember was Chrono Trigger. As much as I adore that game from so many angles, the only way I could have possibly beaten Lavos without grinding was by completing every single major sidequest in the game. Furthermore, the game never tells you where to go for each one, or even what time period. It just gives you the most vague hints if you even know where to look for the hints, and I had to find out where they all were through a guide online. Some of the best parts of the story are in these sidequests, too, so it's a bit ridiculous how obscurely it was handled.  Then you have Final Fantasy XIII and XIII-2. This sub tends to be more positive towards them, as do I, but the pre-final stretch is BS for both games. For XIII, to have any chance of reaching and completing Taejin's Tower (semi-semi-final area at the end of Ch. 11, I think) you have to do nearly every single one of the sidequests. I actually really liked these sidequests as they were challenging ""hunts"" like the kinds from XII, but they took up several hours of time that could have been spent more wisely. I'd have rather hunts been more evenly distributed throughout the adventure, like in XII.  XIII-2, however, is absolutely nauseating. To get to the final areas of the game you are literally required to finish almost every major sidequest. It's not even in terms of a leveling system quirk like the previous two examples, either. The game literally requires that you do boring, repetitive, borderline-soulless sidequests to get a series of hidden items required to travel to the end-game area. Games like the Metroid Prime series had something similar where you had to collect artifacts or batteries to reach the final areas, but these were intuitively hidden in levels like normal powerups and were honestly quite fun and challenging to discover, whereas the requisite items in XIII-2 have little intelligent thought put into them and end up being part of throwaway quests.  TL;DR My experiences with several games point this to being just lazy padding. That, or they sincerely thought they could ""reward"" gamers with the true ending like that, which is absolute nonsense to begin with. If your idea of entertaining players is giving them a list of chores to finish before they can get to the ""good stuff"", I don't think you actually know what players want. Just make the raw gameplay fun. Don't worry about the ""hours"" it takes. People whine about games that don't last longer than 20-40 hours with huge ""you can do anything"" open worlds, and having those features are good hype/marketing bullet points, but that's it. Don't make your game more than it needs to be to fulfill an arbitrary quota."
truegaming,3cpfth,Sloshy42,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:05:57 2015 UTC,"Fucking thank you!!!!  I was so pissed off about this.  Having to complete at least some of the Most Wanted side missions was annoying, but I did it because I wanted to see the ending.  Then the credits finished.  ""Complete every mission to see the true ending to Arkham Knight"".  At that point I shut the game off and haven't picked it up since.  It's super disappointing because I really enjoyed the story and had a blast with it, but there's no way in hell I'm doing all the busywork of getting those fucking Riddler trophies to see the ""true"" ending that should have been included in the regular ending."

Combine collect X missions with the fact that game world have become larger and just end up with more empty space and it is really starting to hurt games in my opinion.  Fetch quests are extremely annoying, as are ""kill this guy in the town across the map and come back to me"" quests are just old.  They take up tons of time, but they don't offer much in added gameplay."

Such a nice, big side quest.  But you played through something interesting to get that stuff.  Just running around the whole map, looking in nooks and crannies to find random items is absolute garbage in my opinion.

truegaming,3cpfth,battlebattlehooah,2,Sat Jul 18 11:29:50 2015 UTC,I'm unsure if you are talking about Batman or Assassins Creed. Well the end of getting those riddles leads to capturing a most wanted villain so it makes sense in that game
truegaming,3cpfth,Redhavok,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:55:19 2015 UTC,If you're a casual or greater batman/arkham fan (the only reason you'd play beyond the main quest anyways) there's tons of interesting stuff in the Riddler section of the game. There's even a bunch of stuff that closes loose ends from City.
truegaming,3cpfth,SadSniper,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:24:30 2015 UTC,Trophies are forced. The finality to a beloved game series shouldn't require the most miniscule and arduous of tasks to present itself.   They should have had the riddles and quests as a necessity for riddler to reveal himself and allow a complete story ending and left the riddle trophies as necessary only for achievement sake.   Deep down I'm praying that they patch the game to do this because now I'm 98% complete I don't have the time or patience to collect every trophy but feel cheated out of the series closure.

Arkham Knight is a narrative-based game. Certainly more so than Sonic and fucking Kirby and other games people are mentioning to try to dismiss OP's post. The point is that locking away a scene from the denoument of the narrative behind 243 collectibles is fucking bullshit.

I got it months after my mom died from cancer and every night played with all these crazy thoughts and emotions turning over in my head and the combination of visuals, sound, and brilliant controls, gave that game a very unique atmosphere and i was so ingrossed in wrapping my head around its puzzles. Skyrim is another game with genius level music, i love how you get different soundscapes depending on if its night or day. Certain tracks whenever i hear them just take me back to those snowy vistas and gives me the taste for high adventure all over again. As far as newer games Elite Dangerous has some amazing music to go with its mind melting cosmic visuals. In my like 25 or so years of gaming nothing can compare to exiting hyperspace and seeing your ship cruise up to what was just a tiny point of light in your ships window, and is now filling your screen with the glowing white surface of a white dwarf star churning right in front of you.... you get the epic (braaaaanngghhh!) sound conveying the epic mass and power of this ancient star then the volume slowly creeps up and its just creats this beautiful ambiance that blends perfectly with the unimaginable scale and beauty of our galaxy.

truegaming,3cqxlw,Hiroschima,0,Tue Jul 14 12:53:42 2015 UTC,"I've read quite a lot about music and sound mixing, and tend to mostly listen to soundtracks since I don't like music with lyrics that much. I can't really tell you which soundtrack is my favourite (right now I'm obsessing over Xenoblade Chronicles X, because it's composed by one of my absolute favourite composers), but one that always pops to mind when people talk about exceptional videogame music is NieR.   The soundtrack itself is a brilliantly bright, but also imposing and melancholic piece of work, but the way the game mixes the music is what really makes it shine for me. For example, during the final dungeon, as you climb a long staircase, the music slowly introduces new elements to the final bosses theme that plays in the background, until you finally hear the full theme at the beginning of the fight.... and then start stripping elements of it away until finally you're left with just a music box version of the same theme. The game is filled with this, and it makes the soundtrack one of the most memorable ones.  Also I feel like the art of synching gameplay to music goes underappreciated. It's already difficult enough to create an evocative score for film and animation, which always happens the same way with the same pacing, but in gameplay you have to create a score with the same expressive power and multiple latching-onto points so it'll at least feel like it's illustrating the events of the gameplay. Like, truly, it doesn't feel like a ""flawless victory"" unless I can hit a finishing blow on a boss in Sengoku Basara unless I get it to synch up with at the peak of their theme, but the soundtrack is written so that doing that is not even that hard. Things like tempo, phrase length, and  layers in the melody affect hugely how I feel any given part of the game ""plays""."

The fact that they can be profitable makes a lot of companies interested in them, and a lot of smaller devs now use mobile games as a starting point in the same way that ten years ago they'd start with handheld titles.   The thing that's stopping the big AAA titles isn't the power of phones. Games don't need the best graphics possible to be amazing, and if a phone can do PS3 levels of graphics, then that's pretty darn good considering the size of most phone screens, certain;y good enough to give a triple AAA title, if not necessarily the scope we currently expect from consoles and high end PC's.   The problem is that this isn't going to happen for the price of a phone game. There's not enough money made by most games for it. Phone games come in two models, either costing no less than $5, or free with lots of adverts and in app purchases. The latter games tend to be giant skinner boxes, meant to be just fun enough to drop small amounts of money regularly for the privilege of doing something faster.   The other problem is that designing for phones is different in two ways: Firstly because you have a different input method. The touch screen lacks tactile feedback, meaning most games are either point and click, or swiping as those are the control schemes that work best. Games that work on a PC as mouse only convert well, games that require a controller with shoulder buttons struggle. This is why there are a lot of puzzle games, RPG's, and RTS games on phones, because they work with the control format of a phone, and aren't trying to map a controller onto a phone (not that such a thing can't work, the ports of Sonic 1, 2, & CD are surprisingly good with their touch screen controllers).   The second problem is that you're not designing for one device. You're designing for hundreds. Is the game that looks good on a phone going to look as good blown up to iPad size? Are all the details which are clear on an iPad as clear when placed on a phone. There are plenty of games that play well on tablets, which don't work on phones simply because the smaller screen means your fingers are now too big for what you want.   It is entirely possible to deliver an AAA experience on a phone from a technological standpoint. It won't be the AAA FPS you'd expect from a  console though. The problem is no-one will do it because the cost is too high for the expected return. Either you make the game dirt cheap, which means you will make a massive loss (or have to sell ridiculous amounts), or you add so many micro-transactions that it takes the game out of the game."
truegaming,3crbx7,Nambot,4,Fri Jul 10 07:38:48 2015 UTC,"The touch screen lacks tactile feedback   This is why i don't see mobile as a serious gaming platform, at least beyond turn based games. Physical buttons are essential for gaming. As about the games that use touch in place of the mouse, there's still the problem that your hand covers the screen."

truegaming,3crbx7,noob_dragon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:32:29 2015 UTC,"To me, AAA gaming means high end graphics and usually some sort of narrative. Typical mobile games have lower end graphics and no story at all, just solve puzzles or worse, just buy more shit so you can get game money faster so you can buy more shit.  Rather than shooting for AAA-type games, I would love developers to work on making deeper gameplay for mobile games, without necessarily having amazing graphics.  My favorite mobile game is FTL, which was ported from PC. It's a rogue-lite with pretty minimal story and roughly SNES-level graphics. But the gameplay itself is incredibly deep and satisfying, far more than your typical mobile puzzle or adventure game (regardless of how pretty a skin they layer on top of it).  Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be where the money is. I've gotten hundreds of hours out of FTL, and I've paid out exactly $15 of my own money for the privilege ($10 for the iPad version, $5 for the PC version on sale). They even released a free expansion a couple years after launch.  I'd love to find more mobile games that have deeper experiences, like FTL, but I'm not sure what to look for."

In that case, why would I want to sit on my couch, with my 50inch TV off and my computer on standby, staring at my tiny phone screen? Trying to play a game that would be better on my TV or PC? I only play games on my phone because I don't have access to my other gaming devices. It's the same reason I watch movies on my phone. If I can't get to a better screen I'll use my phone..."
truegaming,3crbx7,Grimfelion,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:31:17 2015 UTC,"Never. Not ever. Not even in the realms of the possible.  Game quality is defined so much by total content duration and minimum play duration, regardless of platform.  AAA games have a total content duration in the 100+ hours realm. This isn't ""how long it takes to beat"" more ""how many hours engagement"". For example, my Skyrim is at 300+ hours, TF2, 700 plays. LoL, 2000+.  AAA games also have a minimum play duration of about half to one hour. They expect players to have a serious chunk of time to play them, because with greater time comes larger plots, spectacles, challenges, settings etc.  Casual games total content duration doesn't actually matter, it's simply enough to state, it's lower than AAA, there is ""less game"" due to smaller budgets, smaller scope, etc etc.  Casual games also have a minimum play duration of as low as 30 seconds to 1 minute. This requires small scoped challenges, rapid play iteration and other short duration adaptations.  Finally, we get to consoles. I think we can take it as given, that people will ""hardware up"" if possible. Given a length of time and situation, people will always move up to the largest power hardware they can. A 1 minute phone game at the bus stop might be traded for a 15 minute tablet game on the bus, will be traded for an hour xbox before dinner, will be traded for 4 hours PC play after dinner.  AAA will never, ever break into mobile gaming because the minimum play duration simply does not match up with the durations and situations people play mobile games for. This is why basically every single handheld propriety console has failed unless the catalogue was pretty much exclusively casual titles (DS cough).  You will get some high budget, well produced, well received, fun casual games, but real AAA games will never be on mobile."

I've been too spoiled by 21 inch monitors and 48 inch TVs to ever take 5 inch screens seriously for gaming. I've known this pretty much ever since the GBA days - A lot of the ""must-play"" handheld games I let fall by the wayside because, given the option, I would rather play on a big screen. The only game that ever made me glad to own a handheld system was The World Ends With You. I still don't have a 3DS.  The game most emblematic of this for me is Hearthstone - I have it on my phone, and I love the game to pieces, but my mental state is still ""Man, I can't wait to get home and play Hearthstone."""

Granted, this doesn't really help mobile's case, because more often than not I'd rather play a PS1 or SNES or GBA game on the platform than an actual Android game, but I find the small screen works great for the older titles, along with the enhancements that come along with emulation.

They are still fun but they get old fast. I didn't even finish Dying Light because after a while the only fun part is running around at night. I think the industry is sorely lacking in innovation like /u/db_mew created in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1MyKZt8olA&ab_channel=dbmew  Sure it may be simple but mechanics like having to pull down some blocks and shoot others while manoeuvring is fresh while nearly everything I see nowadays is ""inspired"" by other peoples innovation.

AAA gaming will always be more shallow but more flashy for the majority. this is the exact same argument as ""UGH WHY ISN'T MUSIC HOW IT IS 40 YEARS AGO"" cause we forget the shit that happened 40 years ago. the best will always live on and shine a prettier light on what happened, you're ignoring all the shitty fads and bad gameplay tropes of the 90's to act niche about the time you live in now.  gaming will only ever get better, you just have to look around a bit more."

Personally I would prefer a mixture more weighted in the formers direction. I don’t think this a new phenomenon by any means it's been this way for a long time with rare stand out games and many that try and do the same thing but better. Sometimes they do manage to create a better game but usually they just make another. This isn't just AAA either.

Portal, Stanley Parable, Antichamber, Spec Ops: The Line, Hotline Miami, there's been a huge influx of games developed in a way that could literally only be games. be it meta narratives, mechanics intertwined into the story, even acknowledgement that you yourself are the player, movies and books can't do that. i'm making broad terms just as much as you, but original ideas in gaming are so easy to find if you just ignore the copy-catting and shit AAA zombie games."

Proteus? HyperRogue? Kerbal Space Program?  By that measure, how is ""Max Fleischer does Contra"" any better?  But consistency is the hobgoblin of internet arguments. You like what you like, and if you don't like anything on offer then that is a sad state, and one I've been in. It doesn't mean the industry is running out of ideas, just running out of ideas that you like.   There certainly hasn't been a new tetris or bomberman game equivalent that you can sink forever into.   Evergreen games are very hard to make, but there have been some really solid efforts recently. There are a lot of indie games that have their devotees, Isaac and Necrodancer both have racing leagues, construction games like Minecraft and Kerbal Space Program have room for endless variations. A lot of the rogueli*e movement has been driven by a desire for evergreen games, sometimes explicitly with games like Siralim having the stated aim that you should be able to keep playing indefinitely.  You have to like a game in the first place for it to be a forever game to you personally, but even if you dislike every single one of those games, that isn't the same thing as them not being made at all."

truegaming,3crxdv,db_mew,6,Fri Jul 10 23:48:07 2015 UTC,"Other than talking about AAA. That idea or not calling games innovative for not presenting new mechanics is both false (there has been recent games with new mechanics such as paper please) and a misinterpretation of what it means to be innovative.   Cinema and books (the other two great narrative mediums) haven't invented any new genre in decades and that's because in both them all the type of stories have been told in some way or the other (if you just look at the most simple structure), there isn't really anything new to invent. Just one quote from a Umberto Eco popular book that i found recently, but many other writers say it also: “Thus I rediscovered what writers have always known (and have told us again and again): books always speak of other books, and every story tells a story that has already been told.” Just check out the documentary ""Everything is a remix"" to understand how really the creative process works.   In videogames it's the same, there may be still some leeway to make something really new but the reality is that now or in soon enough time will we have told and we will have made every kind of meaningful story and/or mechanic. But this is just looking with a very simplistic point of view. In books and cinema, the setting, the characters, the relationships, what they show, what they don't show, how they show it and the message they try to deliver is what keeps them fresh and feel like they're telling new things. In videogames the combination of mechanics, graphic style, music, characters, localization, message and more is what is the innovative part. Others have gave you a long list of such examples but you have dismissed them because you have the close minded idea of new.  For example, The stanley parable (that isn't really a game and is all the time poking fun at this) is a very interesting and funny exploration of the illusion of choice in games and the ""fight"" between the creators and the player to build a good story on a game using some of this mechanics. It has never been told nor with this kind of style and mechanics, it's really a very innovative game.  Another example, Prison architect may seen like a tycoon simulator and it really it's but it's also a commentary on the use of prisons in this time. About being able to use prisoner forced labor to make a profit, about what it takes to take one prisoner to execute on the death row (just see in some video how serious, formal, routinary  and breathtaking it gets to execute someone and that's a game with doodles as characters), about what it takes to rehabilitate someone, about how much liberty and rights they can get. To be fair, it's isn't pushing any kind of ideology but it's really the first take of videogames in this issue and we will see more in the future.   And i could go on with many others for many different reasons. I hope i made my point clear."
truegaming,3crxdv,dinoseen,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:53:55 2015 UTC,I definitely agree film and books they follow a formula. I think I remember being taught in highschool that there are only 7 stories in film. A part of that in my opinion is that film makers are aware of this and use the fact to manipulate the audience. For example everyone knows that the good guy always loses at the end of the second act so you can make trivial things much more tense by placing them there. At the same time directors like Quentin Tarantino throw those rules out the door and make amazing films that are even better because they are so different. I would like more Tarantino games of that makes any sense?
truegaming,3crxdv,db_mew,2,Sat Jul 11 02:23:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know if Tarantino is the best example. If you want film makers who break the rules while still making good films, check out the Coen Bros or Charlie Kaufman"

truegaming,3crxdv,db_mew,5,Sat Jul 11 22:07:36 2015 UTC,"Sorry dude I even disagree that new genres aren't being invented in a sense. Games have been pretty good as of late synthesing elements from multiple genres and putting fresh new takes on existing ones.   If we look at some of the more popular games they seem pretty damn creative such as Bloodbourne which is a lovecraftian dungeon crawler with elements of castlevania exploration. Watch Dogs is a third person shooter, sandbox centered around hacking and cybercrime. No Man's Sky, one of the most hyped up upcoming games is a space exploration sim. Wonderful 101 is Devil May Cry meets Pikmin. Paper Please is a paperwork simulator.   Dunno about you but I can't really think of games that did the same thing the games I listed from previous eras.  There's still a lot of innovation out there that's not even really hidden though I won't try to defend the AAA games though I struggle to think of a medium in which the most mainstream popular work is of the highest quality especially as of late. Anyway if you want my advice on enjoying games more, just browse genres and games you're interested in and try and stay away from gaming news unless it's updates about a upcoming game you like"

truegaming,3crxdv,db_mew,11,Sun Jul 12 03:05:18 2015 UTC,"I think you're undervaluing the indie scene. With Unity 5 and Unreal Engine 4 being free, anyone with time and energy can become a game developer.  I started to dabble in Unity last November and was able to create interesting gameplay mechanics in a couple of months. Sure, going through with actually releasing a finished product takes a lot more effort and either talent in multiple areas or a coherent team of developers (artists, designers etc.).   But the fact that a single person can create a small game in a matter of hours is an incredibly powerful thing and means that there's an endless stream of new ideas flowing into the scene.  The VR is also coming in the next year or two which means that there's going to be an influx of VR related games, and you can already see a lot of interesting ideas in that area.  Also, even tho it is an easy stab, the AAA scene is a hit or miss if you're looking for quality. With the gaming industry being so huge these days, it makes sense that a lot of games really aren't that wonderful since they are often catered towards the lowest common denominator. But there are wonderful titles there as well, the recent Witcher 3 (apparently) being a great example.  TL;DR - We have more powerful hardware, more advanced and easy to use software.

truegaming,3crxdv,Orthonox,2,Fri Jul 10 09:15:35 2015 UTC,"I wish I had more time to work on it. I have tons of ideas, and at some point I will work more on it. Currently I have no plans on making it multiplayer, since I have never worked with networking code. But apparently Unity now has their own network plugin, so I won't rule it out.  My main goal is to introduce fun maps and fun gameplay elements to mess around with. So it will be a game where you just jump in and have fun in the same way you would when you go out skateboarding, parkouring or doing whatever it is you like doing because it's fun.  The game is first and foremost for myself. I made it because I love interesting movement mechanics, and I've already had hours and hours of fun in it."

truegaming,3crxdv,sre01,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:05:00 2015 UTC,Wanna give a short summary on the gameplay mechanics?
truegaming,3crxdv,OrsikIronfist,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:31:08 2015 UTC,"Mmm, as much as I'd like to, I'm a bit worried about it. Let's just say it'll have grapples used in all ways you could think of, air thrusters, and something similar to a free rocket jump, meaning no damage taken. Or, at least, not where it usually would be."
truegaming,3crxdv,sre01,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:05:16 2015 UTC,"There are 3 different variations of grappling hooks that I am aware of.   The old school Quake grapple, which you shoot at a point and it moves you directly towards that point at a certain speed. The ""rubber band"" hook, which gives you acceleration towards the contact point, so you're still affected by gravity. The worms ninja rope hook, like I have done in my game, where you are basically a pendulum swinging from a rope of fixed length.   You say air thrusters, do you mean jetpacks to keep yourself airborne, or actually flying around with thrusters?  I actually made a prototype flying game in which you control your craft with thrusters. You can accelerate up, down, forward and back (not sideways) and you have pitch, yaw and roll. It makes flying challenging, because you have to try and keep upright with the roll while battling gravity.  I love rocket jumping, I've been a trickjumper in Quake 3 CPMA since 2003, starred in a bunch of movies even. :)"
truegaming,3crxdv,Redhavok,2,Sun Jul 12 09:54:57 2015 UTC,"The thrusters are to provide you with a way of changing direction midair, and you won't be able to activate them for very long - aside from when you're using a grappling hook. A bit like the attack on titan fangame. To provide both options in one button, however, it should just default to the low power burn for the grapple after your initial firing. Perhaps with an additional momentum bonus when you're grappling, so long as it doesn't become possible to just glide down safely to avoid fall damage.   In regards to the grapples themselves, it'll be mostly like the worms one, but with elements of the rubber band. There will be elasticity, along with the ability to change the length of your grapple, and full interaction with the environment and other players along its full length. There will also be weapons (both melee and ranged) that allow you to sever the rope, along with the ability to sever your own rope for a bonus of some kind. Limited rope 'ammo' would also be a thing if these other mechanics end up being implemented. These weapons may also allow you to sever portions of a player's body, but I've barely even considered this idea or how it could affect everything else.  There are other potential ideas floating around my head, but there's no doubt in my mind that I need to avoid option overload and make each feature important and equally necessary to use. Level design should be a bitch on this one. It's a multiplayer shooter, by the way, though it likely won't start as one."
truegaming,3crxdv,gianttabby,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:18:30 2015 UTC,"Sounds pretty cool! What engine are you using? I'm doing all my projects in Unity 5 at the moment.  At the moment my plan for my ninja rope game is to be a single player game about a few simple features that flow well together and then some fun things to use them on in the maps.   I have Quake 3 style air acceleration and circle jump mechanics, with some extra depth added due to the fact that the player is a sphere and gets speed on the ground through friction acting from torque. And my jump direction is always 90° up from your view direction, so you can jump forward or back if you look down or up. So you can climb on walls as well by rolling up at them and jumping etc. It's quite challenging but a lot of fun.  Of course the grappling hook is a big part of it all, but I like the fact that there's interesting mechanics even besides the grappling hook.  I'm also planning to have some form of explosives for jumping and throwing things around with. I'm not sure whether it will be a standard rocket launcher or just an impact grande to also get that arch in the flight through gravity.  I'm also dabbling with the idea of a melee weapon which is a stick in front of you that you swing by turning your view, haven't gotten around to trying it out yet, but the way I imagine it working is fun at least.  I will also make some simple enemies that roam around and try to attack you, and you can launch them in the air with explosions and stuff and destroy them in interesting ways."
truegaming,3crxdv,dinoseen,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:16:01 2015 UTC,"Well, keep in mind that development hasn't even started yet. I don't actually even have a computer capable of anything but light applications. It's planned to be made using Unreal Engine 4. It seems suitable for someone like me who wants an engine that I can get used to and then use for the rest of its lifespan, or at least for a while. I have other much more ambitious (but still totally possible, I think) ideas that Unity simply would not be able to do, though said ideas will also require a fair upgrade to my expertise, as I have no experience in creating anything digital aside from some basic 3D modelling and photoshop. Creating digitally is 100% what I want to do in life, though.   Now since I don't exactly have an 'at the moment' in this stage of my project I can't exactly say that, but that's pretty much exactly how I'll be starting out with mine. The base joints of the game are these movement mechanics, so they've got to make it a fun game on their own before other stuff gets added.  I'll elaborate on the jumping aspect of my game. At any point in time, the player can 'kick' at wherever they're looking. The players having robot legs/bodies, this will obviously propel you in the opposite direction. A thruster in the foot will also be fired, to make it more believable that kicking will have such an impact. I'm also thinking of being able to, if you're skilled enough, take out specific joints of a player's leg to prevent them from escaping.   I've had this tab pinned for a few days now planning to add more stuff to it, but I figure I'll just send it now and you can ask me any questions you want."

truegaming,3crxdv,dogger6253,3,Sat Jul 11 13:06:53 2015 UTC,Part of the issue is the huge risk involved with making a AAA game. They're in it to make money so they make changes but slowly to the point you may not notice for a few games. Too many times they have changed too much all at once and their audience hated them for it. Gamers always call for innovation but rarely want change.

truegaming,3crxdv,dogger6253,2,Fri Jul 10 20:57:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, I read the OP, including the interview.   Has the industry been replaced by uninspired developers making games designed by board rooms and focus groups?   No it hasn't. This is true for a good portion of the ""AAA"" console market, but again, that's like the film enthusiast complaining about Michael Bay movies, or the audiophile complaining about the new Miley Cyrus album.   Are developers blinded by the games of their youth stunting innovation?   As a whole; no. Some developers have certainly fallen prey to this, but plenty have not.   Is it simply too costly to take risks in game development now?   In shitty AAA console games? Sure.   Am I over reacting and the industry is just as good as it was then?   it's much better than it was then, there are a lot more innovative and thought provoking games now than there were 15 years ago when gaming was still mostly considered a pastime for 7-18 year olds, and games were made primarily to capture that market. Now that market is served by the consoles and ""AAA"" gaming and there's a whole other segment of gaming dedicated to making awesome and interesting games for adult gaming enthusiasts."
truegaming,3crxdv,OrsikIronfist,0,Fri Jul 10 21:15:12 2015 UTC,"I only said because you practically repeated the top comment. Originally gaming was not for 7-18 year olds. Many bars would have arcade cabinets. I saw an article in 2013 that I thought pretty clearly showed the reason for the shift.http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/12/2/5143856/no-girls-allowed  That article blames marketing, not development for the change, obviously Indie's weren't as big of a thing then, but I think a big issue today is most games are made following this marketing first, innovation second philosophy .  Hell look at Destiny, that game apparently had a 500 million dollar budget, most of that was definitely not spent on the game. Indies often seem to take similar approachs, makeing pixel graphics games and YouTube bait. Half the time the pixel graphics are just a Vaseline filter, they don't even bother or care about pixel art."

truegaming,3crxdv,tomkatt,0,Sat Jul 11 12:07:06 2015 UTC,I think it's ok to have story or even good if it's a decent story but gameplay should come first and any story included should be told through the medium of gameplay. I don't just think that because I want more gameplay in my games but because I think most good stories in games could be told better through other mediums. The last of us is a great example of a great story that I think would be better told through film.  I also think games like Halo (despite being regarded as a shitty series by many) handles story best by having most story points included in the game told through the players actions or exposition by an assisting character while the player is still playing the game or at least attempting to maintain the flow of the game. The story is expanded upon in books where it can be better told. Another example is darksouls where when you pick up items the place you picked it up is often as important as the description making use of an element unavailable to other mediums to an extent.
truegaming,3crxdv,Ninja20p,2,Fri Jul 10 23:42:15 2015 UTC,"I think story OR gameplay should come first, it will have different results but both can be good and both can be adjusted through the process of creation"
truegaming,3crxdv,tomkatt,2,Fri Jul 10 23:52:06 2015 UTC,"Not to be ""that guy"" but its one of the reasons I'm glad I jumped over to pc gaming.

Mount and blade warband, terraria, Rust, space engineers, divinity original sin, don't starve, chilvery, insurgancy, crusader kings 2. These are games Ive really enjoyed, that come from smaller studios. They are smaller, they arn't spending 50 million dollars on the game, they are willing to take more risk, try new things. I still enjoy big names. fallout, the elder scrolls, the witcher 3, battlefield 4, dying light, GTA v, assassins creed, far cry 3/4. balance makes it good."
truegaming,3crxdv,Ninja20p,4,Fri Jul 10 08:15:35 2015 UTC,"For me, it's hard to imagine that gaming will ever be as broad with as much variety as it has right now. There are so many offshoots of what we call gaming, catering to so many tastes, that it boggles my mind to think that anyone wouldn't be able to find what they want from it."
truegaming,3crxdv,Redhavok,5,Fri Jul 10 08:49:10 2015 UTC,"I think ""gameplay first"" is an outdated and flatly ignorant way to look at games. Sure, I get where it comes from, the language we use are all game-y, they're called ""games"" so we ""play"" them until we ""beat"" them. I think this language is good for shorthand, but it vastly ignores how broad the medium really is and just how good it is as a form of artistic expression. Games can tell great stories, games can be great time-killers, games can be great mental and physical therapy, games can be great escapes, games can be great social tools... ""Gameplay first"" all of the time is severely limiting in regards to the types of things that can be done with the medium. For instance, many times a story suffers in favor of keeping a fun gameplay mechanic, sometimes gameplay suffers because a game holds back on how many war mechanics it throws out because it needs to incrementally introduce those things to a PTSD sufferer.    Flat out, gaming is more exciting, interesting, and far-reaching that it has ever been before. The sheer volume and variety of games available and the accessibility to them is astounding to me as someone who has grown up right along side the industry for the most part. I was born right after the crash, so I've seen games pick themselves up, dust off, and become what they are today every step of the way, I know enough history to understand the context of this change as well, though I am disappointed I wasn't around to see it first hand, or to really understand the behind-the-scenes workings of Atari/Sega/Nintendo's early consoles."
truegaming,3crxdv,luaudesign,4,Fri Jul 10 22:52:40 2015 UTC,"I think ""gameplay first"" is an outdated and flatly ignorant way to look at games.   I dunno, I think 'games as a narrative delivery system' may well be a fad/niche in the end. When you look at what's being actively played across all platforms, a huge plurality is what I'd call 'gameplay first'. Some of the mid-90s multimedia obsession with cinematic experiences is finally starting to wear off."
truegaming,3cgw7m,monty845,249,Tue Jul 7 20:35:00 2015 UTC,"I have very fond memories of the heavily player based economy from vanilla Star Wars Galaxies. The game was filled to the gills with non-combat classes ranging from doctors, dancers, musicians, architects, weapon/armor/drug/furniture crafters, etc. It was magical to roam past space ports and have your screen filled with spammy advertisements that came from real live players, trying to peddle their wears. Heck, I even offered a house decorating service that relied on a supply chain of furniture and housing plans from guild-mates.   That game was also my first MMO and I was in high school to help setup the level of rose tint I might be construed by.   How I'd Do It  Keep your combat/non-combat roles seperated for each character.  i.e. No more Warrior/Blacksmiths. You roll a character and that character is a Blacksmith. Period. They would live within the safe confines of the cities and villages, and would need protection if they wanted to wander into the 'wilds'. This would help cement the player's goals for the character right out the gate and prevent them from getting lost in the endless content options for your typical MMO character.  Participating in the economy is the adventure and story!  If a player wants high adventure slaying wurms and lich queens, let them roll a combat toon. Manipulating the market and making your mark in the economy is its own adventure!  Leveling a non-combat class would revolve around starting as an apprentice for a NPC 'master' that would be the source of story and content that would teach the players the ropes for their particular profession. You can toss in some padding like fetch quests and devices for learning how the game economy (auction houses) work and such.   These leveling crafters would be the engine that converts much of the raw materials provided by adventurers (combat classes) into refined materials and parts that are then used by higher level crafters to create usable items like weapons/armor/crafting tools/etc.  Reward dedicated crafters with a store front of their own.  When reaching a certain threshold of proficiency (level requirement?) that has filtered out the non-dedicated the crafter is awarded with their own store front. This would be difficult to physically give them space in the game world to do. Instead creating an interactive interface or even an instanced zone that is accessible via menus would be better.  e.g. I'm looking to purchase a sword. I click on the 'Market' interface (or walk into a 'portal' in the market district in a city). An interface comes up with a big list of all the various crafter store fronts that have setup shop in that particular city. At a glance I can see a general quality rating (provided by immediate customer feedback) maybe a logo, slogan, and such. (whatever ya want)  Once you click a link it takes you to their instanced zone. Here the crafter can customize the look and feel of their personalized zone and can be upgraded over the course of their career. (making decorations would be a class in itself, trophies and such can be provided by adventurers)   Inside the zone the shopping player would be welcomed by an NPC that actually runs the shop and is the interface. Here you can simply buy items in stock or put in an order or a custom job. Which brings us to:  No recipes, follow a template and sprinkle in some style.  Every blacksmith knows how to make a sword. What separates the chaff from the wheat is knowing how to take the rare crafting materials provided by adventurers and turn it into something unique. They provide the dragon heart, and its up to the blacksmith to make it into a unique, one of a kind weapon.  Crafting materials would have an innate set of characteristics than can refined by the crafter based on their personal skill. (design cool mini-game or what have you here) Once the materials are refined, then you'd build the item itself. Using a snapping build system (like ship build in GalCiv?) the crafter can then design unique looking weapons and armor for their clients. The amount of crap them could put together is limited by their level, materials, and what 'tile-sets' they have unlocked. No one player can unlock all tilesets and such without great investment of time and energy.  Being able to physically put your own style into your products would help give players with natural talents for art and design a leg up and combined with players who master the refining mini-games can draw the fullest potential from their materials.  The cherry on top would be for the item to be forever branded with the crafter's name, regardless of who ends up with the item.  Challenges  Obviously much what what I just wrote would be a crazy and expensive technical challenge. There is already a ton of flaws and design challenges that would arise out of this (saw a few myself just writing it), but this was intended as a bird's eye view of a system that I would love to see.  The whole intention is to attract and reward the builders of the gaming community. I think that's something that many 'theme-park' style games have forgotten about ~ that there is more to virtual life than killing raid bosses and stealing their strangely perfect sized iron bras and panties. Players want to interact with a living and breathing world and the best way to do that is to have players actually role-play the lungs.  Thanks for reading."

I've looked into it, it looks like it would be an extremely enjoyable game, I'm sure I would love it, but there's just zero possibility for me to catch up with people who have been playing for years, and that is the reason I have stayed away from it. Just talking with someone who does play it when I was looking to get into it, I asked how long it would take to get some cool ship (I wouldn't be able to pick it out now) and he said that he could work out a roadmap so that if I put in several hours every day I could have it in about 6-8 months, and IIRC it wasn't even a top-tier ship.  Contrast with the ""traditional"" way where you just hit the level cap and run some dungeons, and if you're hardcore enough you can go from 0 to raid-ready in like a month (more realistically 2-3), and once you're in a raiding guild it's basically only cosmetic bonuses that differentiate your character from an older one.  It's cool that Eve caters to veterans, but what's not cool is that it does that so heavily that it dissuades newcomers like me from even picking the game up in the first place."
truegaming,3cgw7m,Zarokima,48,Wed Jul 8 02:01:15 2015 UTC,"I've looked into it, it looks like it would be an extremely enjoyable game, I'm sure I would love it, but there's just zero possibility for me to catch up with people who have been playing for years, and that is the reason I have stayed away from it.   If this is the reason you don't play, I can tell you it is absolutely untrue. I can see why people would think this, but here's the deal with that game. Yes, there are years worth of skills in the game, but you do not have to do them all. If you focus on, say, frigate combat, you can have all relevant skills within a couple weeks. Join a corp, they will probably give you free stuff to go flying in, and just have fun. People get wrapped up, like ""oh I can't catch up to their years worth of skills"", but in any given PVP, they only use maybe a months worth of skills to take you down. Trust me, the fact that there are so many skills does not even remotely mean you cannot fly around and play with the big boys. Mostly it just means you cannot fly certain types of ships or utilize the more expensive ships to their max potential, but you wont have enough money for that early on anyways.  This is the wrong attitude to have. I understand why people have it, but it is completely untrue. I was flying around killing other players in a matter of 2 weeks. For example, sure, that guy spent +1000 hours training his way to a really big hauler...that doesn't help him against me and my gang of frigates. We blow him up, and reap the reward. You don't ever use all skills all the time, just focus on what you want to do and it takes no time.   he said that he could work out a roadmap so that if I put in several hours every day I could have it in about 6-8 months   No offense to that guy, but he has no clue what he is talking about. This would be like not buying a car until your 80 to save up for that Ferrari. Either he took your asking about one specific ship too literally (like maybe you asked about a capital ship) or he was trying hard to make it sound way harder than it is. I say again, you can be flying around in murder ships in a WEEK. The key is finding a group you can play with. Nobody but the richest players in the game who have been at it for years even fly a ship that would take 8 months to learn, as the risk of losing it is pretty scary.   Hopefully that helps, let me know if you have any more questions, but your view on the game is definitely a bit skewed. It is not anywhere near how hard you think it is to get into it, from a ""newbie vs veteran"" standpoint. That said, it is a lot to learn in the game, and it is not traditional, but like I said, find a group to play with (Reddit has a corp) and dive in."

EVE is one of the few games that I've played that I can truly say that you get what you put into it. In EVE the players are the content and as in real life, relationships are only as rewarding as the time and effort you put into them."

You can even focus on making money and then buy a combat character on the market. The people who eve favors are those that understand the api and make obscene spreadsheets to abuse the market, they're the ones making billions of isk and using it to bankroll whole alliances.  The problem is that participating in actual content is very hand holdy, the single player stuff is just kind of dribbled around in places that you need to google for and is generally camped by groups of people who want to use you as their content."
truegaming,3cgw7m,Cyval,2,Wed Jul 8 02:11:24 2015 UTC,You make it seem like having a goal to continually strive for is a bad thing. Shouldn't a player that prefers crafting desire a game that allows them to keep crafting things and improving their business?
truegaming,3cgw7m,Twisty1020,3,Wed Jul 8 02:22:15 2015 UTC,"Having the goal of being able to craft max-level equipment should not be the goal to strive for, otherwise unemployed neckbeards would spend 24 straight hours grinding to be the first to make the equipment and would sell it for shitloads of gold while normal people get left in the dust."
truegaming,3cgw7m,FlamingSwaggot,13,Wed Jul 8 04:17:21 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, the problem I have is that limiting the player like that is tacit admission that the crafting isn't all that complex. In a game like EVE, you can spend all day, every day, in the pursuit of crafting, because there's just a ton of work to do, and you can always be doing more. Mostly, its not actually the crafting that you're involved with, but the resource acquisition/logistics, but that's pretty much the same thing.  To me, a game shouldn't need to limit a player like that, because the process itself should be complex enough that a dedicated crafter will be able to spend as much time crafting as they are willing to put in. This is not the case in a game like WoW or something, where you can pretty much just hit combine a few times and be done, and so they must limit the crafting professions a player can pick else a player could just do everything."

truegaming,3cgw7m,Breakfastator,3,Wed Jul 8 01:26:07 2015 UTC,"I think the bigger issue is just that you're asking the dev team to do something very difficult: Make two separate equally compelling experiences. It's one thing to just say ""Yeah, make an awesome and fun crafting system in addition to a combat system complex and balanced enough to justify the crafting system,"" but even managing one of the two isn't exactly easy.  It's a hard sell to convince a team to tackle because if you don't get both, the game could fail even if one is excellent. After all, if there's nobody crafting items the combat fails and if there's nobody using items the crafting fails."
truegaming,3cgw7m,Falterfire,19,Wed Jul 8 03:43:12 2015 UTC,"Mechanics like the GP describes would be compelling to me because it could make the players into the quest givers. A crafting player can give a fetch quest to another. The adventuring player can then go off with a more meaningful adventure because they're gathering material for their personalized bespoke item.  The crafting mini-games can be made as fulfilling as the combat mini-games. A lot of the same mechanics (stamina, ""powers"", cool downs) can be applied to crafting. Instead of a fight against a goblin it can be a fight against the material or the process itself. If the setting is fantasy the crafter might even actually fight anthropomorphic elements in the materials.   An adventurer would go into an instance and fights monsters while a crafter might go into an instance to create an item. The abilities of the crafter would get them through the instance and make an item with the intended properties. Failing an instance could mean they have created an inferior item or one with flaws."
truegaming,3cgw7m,giantsparklerobot,10,Wed Jul 8 02:19:08 2015 UTC,"The crafting mini-games can be made as fulfilling as the combat mini-games. A lot of the same mechanics (stamina, ""powers"", cool downs) can be applied to crafting.   That's exactly the sort of thing I was thinking.  In WoW-style combat, you have various attack rotations and cooldowns that you are activating in sequence, either in a way that's optimal for your build or in response to enemy/environmental actions.  Often, there you may be building combos (ability ""A"" deals damage over time while ability ""B"" does bonus damage if there's a DoT on the target).  There's no reason that crafting couldn't be mechanically similar -- you are activating various abilities to craft the item: Fire, Hammer, Quench, Fold Metal, etc... Each of which progresses towards item completion.  The twist being that doing it well doesn't speed the completion of the job (unlike combat, which ends faster with more damage).  Instead, completion time is more or less fixed -- the difference is that efficiency & combos allow to squeeze out a higher quality item.  ""Crits"" can be adding intrinsic bonuses (stats) to an item -- which means that maybe you can specialize your crafting to pure quality (i.e. just straight auto-attack damage or armor) or you can specialize into ""crits"" to produce items with more stat bonuses (so you might be really good at making items with +Intellect for mages.)  In addition to allowing you to make really amazing items in a ""fight"" that's as epic as any raid boss, it could also make the act of ""grinding"" a lot more entertaining.  I've killed thousands of generic orcs in WoW, and while not always adrenaline-pumping, there's a certain satisfaction there.  If your kingdom is at war, they need you to grind out hundreds or thousands of generic swords -- and if instead of just queuing a bunch and then going AFK you instead had to work your hotkeys to maximum efficiency (and occasionally get rewarded with an awesome rare ""drop"" when you ""crit""), then it becomes a lot more interesting.  In particular, the variety of randomly making a green/rare/epic/legendary item in the same way that random loot works would likely be enough motivation to make me enjoy crafting a lot more.  All the ""greys"" should still serve a purpose -- in particular, if you could turn them in to your faction for personal payment plus improve the strength of your kingdom's NPC army? (This kind of bulk/grind crafting might feel quite different from the intentional ""raid boss"" level of item making that guarantees an epic item, unless something goes terribly wrong in the construction in which case you ""wipe"" and have to restart -- losing you material in the same way that a wipe on a raid boss requires more consumables + armor repair.)  Now that's starting to sound like a fun game."
truegaming,3cgw7m,quill18,6,Wed Jul 8 02:50:36 2015 UTC,"The problem is creating enough that its more than just pressing the right button in response to a signal, which is basically what Everquest did with their crafting system. But once you got down the button to press for a given signal, it ended up just slowing it down, and feeling like a standard grind. The complexity was a joke compared to what a high end PvE player may be expected to do. There needs to be enough choice and complexity that real skill develops and provides a reward. Basically it needs to be a full game in its own right, or at least far more than a minigame."

truegaming,3cgw7m,GearBrain,2,Wed Jul 8 15:21:51 2015 UTC,"What if the crafting system let you build your own ""combos"" of such moves?  Say you want to make a Short Sword.  It takes 10 units of Iron, 1 unit of Coal, and 2 units of Leather.  If you want to do it manually, you can fire up the forge and play the craft game, timing your abilities (Fold, Quench, Etc) to make the item.  Or, you can assemble those like modules in a chain, like a macro.  All that costs is time - something you can fire and forget.  The item made with this macro system may not be the best - it may not be able to enjoy crits during the creation process - but it could still be decent.  As you level your smithing, you get more slots in your macros, more abilities (special techniques and actions you can slot in) and maybe even ""auto-crit"" powers.  So the fun can be tinkering with these scripts, experimenting to see what makes a good sword amazing."

truegaming,3cgw7m,FlamingSwaggot,5,Thu Jul 9 17:48:10 2015 UTC,"Wow. You actually sold me. I think this would be especially compelling if you rewarded players for high yield crafting; they'd have to run around, micro managing all these different swords, and when they finished they'd have a product they could really be proud of. The ""hundreds and thousands of generic swords"" sounds absolutely terrible though, and I say that as someone who played WoW for 3 years. Too much Bloodsail/Ravenholdt/Shaohao flashbacks, and if I wanted to do repetitive tasks for hours a day, I'd go work at McDonalds and at least make $7 an hour."
truegaming,3cgw7m,nagilfarswake,2,Wed Jul 8 04:19:40 2015 UTC,"The problem with this idea is that it would be completely without anything to react to. I think you're picturing it as being like going through your rotation as a ranged DPS character in WoW. But doing that in WoW in engaging because you both have to keep putting out DPS AND react to what the boss is doing. That's what makes it interesting. If it's just pressing buttons in certain orders, either it becomes totally predictable or it turns into keyboard DDR."
truegaming,3cgw7m,quill18,4,Wed Jul 8 05:51:15 2015 UTC,"It's easy to imagine lots of ways in which there could be stuff to react to, especially if you're trying to make an awesome, complex item (i.e. the Raid Boss Fight analogue.)  Smithing a sword? Maybe spots that are becoming too hot or not hot enough, that you have to balance out quickly before you take a hit to final quality (or maybe even ruin the item entirely).  So now we don't just have a straightforward optimal rotation -- you're always have to break your cycle, move to a different spot, and emphasize the right kind of abilities to counter whatever problem is developing.  We might be talking about crafting magical gear, which involves weaving together mystical energies that threaten to unravel at any moment.  You might need fast reflexes to react to the spots where the various elemental powers are threatening to pop out and use the correct powers to force them back into the matrix.  If things get too overwhelming, that's where your longer cooldown abilities come in to play -- but carefully, because you can't spam them.  (Compare raid boss fights, where most of it is managing your rotation, but then you have to move out of fire spot, occasionally switch to additional enemies, and whenever something is extra vulnerable you'll want to blow all your cooldowns to maximize your damage.)  Or maybe you're handling a high-powered laser, trying to cut out shapes from metal with great precision to make a blaster -- you can't go too slowly, or you'll just end up burning a nasty hole in one spot and scorch the metal -- but how fast can you go and not miss an corner or go a bit crooked?  This is less ""WoW combat"" and more of a dexterity skill game.  Different types of crafting could have pretty different types of mechanics -- some being more puzzles/mini-games for people who prefer that sort of thing.  Making potions should definitely feel quite different from forging a breastplate and from weaving a cloak.  DDR & Guitar Hero could absolutely be one source of inspiration for some mechanics, but it's far from the only one.  Cooking Mama, for example, is a treasure trove of crafting mechanics.  Multiple different steps, each involving their own unique motion that you can execute with varying degrees of success.  Throw in the idea that you get to decide which ""ingredients"" and exact ""cooking methods"" you are combining to add different modifiers to your ""sword"" and boom...that's an interesting and varied system.  Remember though -- not every fight is a boss raid fight.  There's still lots of potential to have a simple DDR-like filler for crafting basic items in bulk to help raise funds and develop skills.  A well made rhythm game is a great thing to kill some time with, just like killing ogres for reputation or elementals for crafting reagents."
truegaming,3cgw7m,boredguy12,2,Wed Jul 8 14:23:46 2015 UTC,"I have an idea for a crafting system that might just work. You have to get all your materials together and organize them into place just like this mini-game from mario party 2 where you stretch the faces and your score is based on your accuracy to the face shown at the beginning. Well, have your weapons STATS be based on the actual crafter's accuracy to the blueprint!   You could have legendary weapons require multiple stages of ""heating"" it to reset the clock, and if your timer reaches zero without having crafted a weapon, you've failed to craft a weapon, potentially wasting resources.   This also opens the door for a modular weapon crafting system that lets you stretch and forge the style of parts to your own weapons."

All useful items are usually made from sub-items (like a frame, handle, screws, washers etc), so there's a fair bit to be done. There are Normal and High Quality materials, and using HQ mats give you a better shot at making HQ sub-items, which in turn gives you a better shot at making HQ useful items (be it food, potions, armor or weaponry).  It is mini-gamey, but far more enjoyable (to me) than most other MMO crafting systems have been.  Each profession is leveled separately, and have as many levels as the adventure classes. There are also usually Work Orders (called Levies) available from NPCs that ask you to create X many of Y items, each day. Delivering HQ items results in an XP/Gold bonus over Normal items."

And that sorta brings up the inherent contradiction: With Combat, 99% of monsters the player kills are meaningless. Almost every enemy you kill is going to drop absolutely nothing to help you. Some won't even have a chance to drop something helpful, they're just distractions on the way to a boss.  But crafting with a 99% chance of giving you junk isn't going to go over well. Even if the crafting is engaging, I think you'll be fighting the MMO player mindset that ""Combat = Gameplay, Non-combat = grinding"". I think you'll have issues selling ""Yeah, just run the crafting against 15 iron ingots so you can run it against iron sword for a shot at something useful"" in the same way you can sell ""Yeah, just run the combat against 15 mooks so you can run it against a mini-boss for a shot at something useful"".  I could be wrong about that though, it's just an impression I get from gaming forums that could be totally off-base. Certainly there is an audience for heavily playing puzzle-type games.

I recall EQ2 launched with a crafting mechanism that would have 'events' pop up (flame is too hot, or whatever), and you'd counter with an appropriate action.  I guess that's basically the same thing as most MMO combat anyway, but somehow, in the context of crafting it felt wrong. Like whack-a-mole.  Maybe because it was pure 'if X, hit Y' unthinking responses? Maybe because it lacked real consequence? Maybe just the arena it took place in? I don't know, but it wasn't satisfying.   Edit: Oh, and minigame generally means, to me, something that occurs outside the core game, and is pretty simple in mechanics and theory. Often it is just a completely arbitrary skill check. The mass effect hacking game is an ideal example. Do maze, unlock chest. What?   But crafting with a 99% chance of giving you junk isn't going to go over well. Even if the crafting is engaging, I think you'll be fighting the MMO player mindset that ""Combat = Gameplay, Non-combat = grinding"".

One thing you could do in this regard is have a multi stage crafting process. Take resources, make 16 subcomponents, use those to make 4 components, use those to make 1 final product for sale.

Oh, I don't expect every item in game to be composed of physics objects, with rules that govern its function like a rocket in KSP, but if I had to build stuff like that in a crafting screen to pop out an appropriate product, that would be crafting.   If you make crafting into combating the impurity creeps with the flux launcher, I really don't see why you wouldn't just skip crafting entirely and just go fight stuff.

truegaming,3cgw7m,dankisms,3,Wed Jul 8 06:25:19 2015 UTC,All mechanics eventually devolve into their own mini-games. Combat in MMOs is very much a mini-game. Fire off abilities in sequence to do maximum DPS.   Having crafting look like combat was just my immediate reaction. There's no reason a crafting system couldn't look like a modeling system. The crafter could physically shape and decorate an item. Then using their skills add features like stat boosts or special powers. Making a basic item could take a few clicks but to really craft might take hours. Character stats might then come into play allowing for different customization tools.  Such an interface could have helper tools so players with limited artistic ability could still crank out cool looking gear. The more skill the player has the better looking gear they can make.

Let me buy ""trash loot"" from PCs, break them down into materials.  (that crappy sword from that kobold, can become a small iron ingot... or so on.)    I have a storefront that lets me do these things.   Minigames?  Who needs them.   Yeah, I am a blacksmith, but I need a new grinding wheel,  I have to go to a mason to get one.   Masons make building materials or so on.    A wood worker makes furniture, or bows or...  You make the PCs into NPCs when they are not actively being played.

truegaming,3cgw7m,CutterJohn,4,Wed Jul 8 01:06:49 2015 UTC,"Let my ""adventure"" character gather materials   Nobody is mentioning the resource system in SWG either. It was a crucial element to the crafting system because ""resources"" (as they were called in-game) were the core materials for crafting anything and everything.  Who remembers seeing tons and tons of harvesters scattered across every planet? This was essentially a minigame. Resources were randomly generated, and each server had its own resources. They would spawn all over every planet, and the only way to know was to be diligent in scouting for good spawns.  Some crafters would even pay for a person's server transfer just to get resources, since the nature of resource spawns meant that not every server had access to the same spawns. The 2 year veteran gift, the resource kit, became invaluable to crafters because it gave you a 10k stack of any resource of your choosing that had ever spawned on that server. Some rare resources became priceless or otherwise extremely expensive.   Let me buy ""trash loot"" from PCs, break them down into materials.    This also became a thing in SWG, although it was added way after launch.  Basically, all your character's gear had to be crafted by a person.  It wasn't like in WoW or other MMOs where your armor and weapons were looted from a boss. The best gear in the game had to be crafted by weaponsmiths and armorsmiths.  Some backpacks and weapon schematics could be looted from instances, but at the end of the day, everything had to be crafted.  In the last few years of the game, crafted armor and weapons eventually could be modified with stats, but in order to do so you had to make stat attachments for armor & weapons, which required breaking down lots and lots of junk loot (stuff that had no real purpose and could be looted all over the place).  People made entire in-game careers out of crafting in SWG.  Most of the richest players were crafters or otherwise people who were extremely active in the economy.  Everything was player driven, and I really haven't seen an MMO quite like SWG in that regard."

truegaming,3cgw7m,dankisms,12,Wed Jul 8 01:30:43 2015 UTC,"10 PCs are a continuation of the problem.  everyone would then have 1 of each profession, and we've gained nothing.   By forcing people to have a limited number, (say, 3 or 4) and force them to choose, you generate a slight scarcity in skillsets.  Then at the character create, show what professions (Warrior, Mage, Healer, Blacksmith, Cattle Rancher, Farmer, Dog Polisher)  are most in need, and give a +10% bonus to that character in the profession needed for a month.  and a ""We're overwhelmed with Prostitutes, please no more!""  they get a -10% un-bonus.   You could expand upon this by making each small town have a limited number of slots for each profession.    A level 4 town can only have 4 of each active at any time.   You go to the ""Blacksmith"" store, and are presented with the four available blacksmiths and their level in the town.   Your options are to a: level up, b: travel to a new town.  (Though this would need some adjustment to keep fair.  There's a lot of tweaking in this idea here to be done.)     Perhaps the level of the town would also work as a ""max level"" of blacksmith, give a ""heroic blacksmith"" some reason to expand.  Then you could have things like ""guard"" as a profession/side job for a combat class.   Your job is to follow a wagon from town to town.  You get the reward if, for example it makes it without bandits dropping it to 0 hp...      Or you're a Bad Guy, and you were hired to stop that same wagon.  Now you have to find it and so on.  Semi-automation of PCs into NPCs will both allow people to ""play"" without being logged in, and give the game something not cookie-cutter.

You'd want to treat a ""Crafter"" profession as something you level up and progress, like a character, but without the actual PvE questing perhaps.   You could also have ""apprentice"" as a way to level up.  You help a higher level character (perhaps doubling their crafting rate) but all YOU get is XP, nothing financial..."
truegaming,3cgw7m,rdewalt,5,Wed Jul 8 02:02:24 2015 UTC,"+1. Not just separating Warrior/Blacksmith from the fulltime Blacksmith, but also forcing players to choose rather than go ""I'll just make one of every vocation"". Solid idea.  About the bonus thing - perhaps use ""X logins for Y hours in the past month"" rather than bare numbers, because we all know players create a ton of characters which they then proceed to never use. It's useless to have 10 Blacksmiths when only 2 of them ever play regularly.  I like the idea of being one of the NPCs in an escort quest. It gives combat characters a real reason to protect them, because if you fail, then the resources you were transporting don't get sent to the destination, which in turn affects them as well. This doesn't need you to be online though - just walking after some NPCs is dull. Your crafting character can sign up to join these depending on what merchant guilds he's in, and once those trigger your character automatically joins.  I think what op and many of us are looking for are ways to make progress varied and interesting for these non-combat professions. Let's leave pve and pvp to the combat characters.  Edit: The combat characters can do the material gathering fetchquests - after all, they're the ones who go out in the field. I think avoiding combat altogether would be useful in forcing designers to think of ways of making crafting professions interesting."
truegaming,3cgw7m,rdewalt,2,Wed Jul 8 02:49:44 2015 UTC,"Not wanting everyone to just make 10 alts to get all the skills is definitely part of what I'm hoping for. But artificial limits are a poor hack to try and fix the problem. Actually, I'd prefer just being able to do as much as you wanted on your main character, with alts being optional if you want to divide responsibilities. Instead what would be ideal is for there to be enough depth (Not just grind) to the crafting system that it would be impractical for someone to get  character(s) to the pinnacle of all the different crafts. There will be the super hardcore players who through insane investments of time manage to maintain more than one craft at pinnacle, it should have difficulty on par with running two or more characters on full raid schedules. With normal harcore players reaching the pinacle of a craft, or alternatively, having a few crafts at usable levels, producing medium quality, affordable and mostly disposable gear."
truegaming,3cgw7m,Cyval,5,Wed Jul 8 04:03:21 2015 UTC,"But then you bias the ""grind"" of crafting in another way.  For example a tailor character?  My mother is a quilter, and the sheer volume of tools, gear, and so forth to make anything out of fabric is amazing.  The constant need for consumable replenishment, the ""Next Years Model"" sewing machines...   (Some costing more than $20k !  you tell me a $20,000 tool for your Profession, would not be considered an Epic Item for your character?)   Then you start putting together a lot of variances and costs in there and you can make a system that allows for a lot of creativity.  ""I want to make a 34 slot bag... ""   well, there isn't a recipe, but I'm a Master Tailor,   I create a ""Bag"" class item, and set the slider to ""34 slots"" , well shit, that will be purple, and require, since I've never made one, a day and $foo units of fabric  to make the pattern.  Then it will require a day to make, and consume $bar units of other fabrics.  I can invest in higher quality fabrics and get a purple item that has 36 slots,  or gives some other random ""Bag"" enchantment.      I allocate TWO days to make it, so that will give me a +5 to my crafting roll (Because I'm taking my time, intending in making it a bespoke item.)  Now that  I have made one,  I can now spend a day and $bar units to make a second.... or if I have an apprentice (N)PC, two...  The item would be considered ""Unique Bespoke Bag""  show up as ""34 slot bag""   And would be Quite Collectable, since I would only make one Unique Bespoke 34 Slot Bag..... /EVER/   And thats just off the top of my head.  But we're getting Dwarf Fortress levels of Crafting Bloat now."
truegaming,3cgw7m,imoblivioustothis,3,Wed Jul 8 05:32:13 2015 UTC,"Heck, think of the ""Prostitute"" class.  (I'd classify it as a mostly PvP in a way.  )   You start off as ""Barmaid"" apprenticing/working for a Bartender class (N)PC.   After a few levels you get ""Wench|Prostitute"" for a few levels, you work for the Bar/Inn but would get Patrons now and then.   You could move up to full-time Prostitute,  level up the majority of the way there, perhaps even specialize to ""Madam"" and run your own, ""hiring"" other (N)PCs to work for you.  Non-Snogging class time would be spent finding a tailor to make outfits, wood-workers to make a bed...or restraints..   A potions maker to make love potions, and er...  ""Moon Tea"" and so on..."

truegaming,3cgw7m,ChronoX5,2,Wed Jul 8 14:10:24 2015 UTC,"A very interesting thought. In contrast don't think Everquest had an established world, but people could live their lives as crafters (and other non-combat professions). I can't be completely certain, but I'd like to say I'd enjoy SWG even if it wasn't Star Wars.   The world might help get people into the game, that's pretty much known. But I don't think the world being pre-established is a requirement to make people feel like they want to RP. Being anything in SWG doesn't really affect the lore, and most professions in SWG didn't really go out and interact with the world and the lore, just with other players."

truegaming,3cgw7m,dmmagic,3,Wed Jul 8 13:28:44 2015 UTC,"Gear damage on death works well in this context, as gear persistence limits the scale of a player economy. If you need to replace gear after a certain amount of wear, and death added a big chunk of wear, you would get a real penalty, and also keep the player economy healthy. UO had a good system, you can repair gear, but every time you repair you loose a bit of max durability, until eventually it just break and you need a new one.  If you want to go nuclear, you can do full drop loot, but it still needs to be damaged or you just end up with endless loot recycling."

Imagine if you had a city of smiths, where the forges provided a bonus to the finished goods, a city of tailors, where the looms did, one for woodcrafters, etc... and finally a centrally located city of trade, with no direct bonuses, but lots of space for vendors and warehousing. To create the best sword, may involve getting a hilt built in one city, with wood collected in a dangerous forest, ingots refined in a second city from ore mined in a deep dungeon, that traveled in commerce through the trade city, on their way to the smith city to be forged into the great sword, then shipped back to the trade city of sale. The trade city would of course have everything you needed to make an inferior basic version with never leaving, but the parts of the best gear would have quite the journey and pass through many intermediaries in the player economy to get to the hands of its wielder."

truegaming,3cgw7m,JohnTheRedeemer,4,Wed Jul 8 07:34:43 2015 UTC,"One thing to add is that the highest tier blacksmiths should also be able to improve or refine raid drops. Or have tailors fit the item to the players size for better mobility and stats. I think a few random drop recipes from mobs or enemy blacksmiths could be had but not everything needed for it to come from without.   Also likely a separate currency for progress and purchasing like artisan marks that can be sold or bought for currency but the marks are the only things that can buy some items.  For the mini game I'd break the crafting up into parts or services that can be offered for specialization: Decorative lettering, hilt, cross guard, blade, and sharpening. Make blacksmiths sort of necessary by being the ones required to repair gear too but have NPCs offer the ability too just. Maybe all active blacksmiths benefit from the daily pool of repairs just so one of a few don't hog all of that business."
truegaming,3cgw7m,Jimmers1231,3,Wed Jul 8 13:57:51 2015 UTC,"No one player can unlock all tilesets and such without great investment of time and energy.   I think this is perhaps the most important step towards creating the kind of system OP described. If, at max level, each toon has enough XP to unlock all of the tech treee available to them, then they will all be the same. If they can only get enough XP to unlock one or two full trees that adds a heavy dose of player choice and adds differentiation. After the players make their choice each end game character will be different from each other one.   If you really wanted to encourage a wide variety of builds you would also make the Items themselves dependent on a web of skills instead of a tree. That way you would get a system that rewards both maxing one tech tree, or having high skills in several. For example, maybe to make the best swords you need to max swords, but to make the best halberds you need 75% axes and 75% staffs. This would work especially well with enchanters if a enchantment that could only be added with one 100% skill was roughly the same as one that could be added with 4 50% skills for example."
truegaming,3cgw7m,dabza,3,Wed Jul 8 10:52:49 2015 UTC,"I like the store front idea a lot.  Infact, I'd like to see it and an auction house. In order to visit someone's store front, you have to get an invite (invites are permanent unless the owner cancels it). Store fronts are are straight 1:1 transactions. Auction Houses however take 20% of anything they sell.   This would encourage the crafter to network and find people to sell to, while the auction house is accessible to the thousands of other players."
truegaming,3cgw7m,antoninj,2,Wed Jul 8 13:10:14 2015 UTC,"The Way Star Wars Galaxies did the store front idea was that there was a Bazaar in each big city, which anyone could post on for a small fee. It was essentially an auction house.  In the Artisan tree (I think), where crafters would start, there was a separate skill line for Business. With business skills, you could get your own vendor machines, droids, and even NPCs! You could place them in your house, and customize their appearance and how they would greet people when they entered your store.  Your store was basically a house which was set to public access, which meant you needed to find a place outside of a big city to place it, and you had to pay maintenance for it also."
truegaming,3cgw7m,snwborder52,2,Wed Jul 8 14:38:20 2015 UTC,"This is a really good write up of what could work.   The recipe thing, or in your case tilesets, could potentially work as an end game thing. The player would have to invest resources into ""discovering"" a new recipe. This could go well or could go poorly. You could even have stages, where they can continue to unlock along a path as they complete the previous investigations.   Your mini games could tie into this, to keep players interested. You could even have it necessary that the player have to travel places for certain ingredients (or hire people to get them) or special places that are required for treating some items to ""perfect"" them. Essentially the player be the target of an escorts mission, hiring other players to protect them whole they do their business."

It was my first MMO and before the days where you would just look up strategies for raiding molten core and find out what loot each boss had, rinse and repeat.  I remember having to escort my buddy's crafting toon through treacherous territory to do harvester maintenance.  A whole lot more exploration and player-driven stuff than anything I've ever experienced before or since.  My wife always says she wants to get into MMOs but doesn't want to fight.  I just wistfully tell her stories of SWG.  I decided to roll Teras Kasi at one point and met a tailor that basically designed me a samurai outfit.  It was awesome.  But...the boring unfortunate reality was that an economy that complicated made it essentially uncontrollable.  Hyper-inflation, scarcity, etc...  These things ultimately killed the experience.  It's so unsexy to talk about the economics of an MMO - but the economics are one of, if not the, biggest factor in making them work.  SWG was so ambitious and should always be remembered and celebrated for that.  But I don't know if you'll ever be able to make something like that work."

truegaming,3cgw7m,texasjoe,58,Wed Jul 8 14:23:25 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you might enjoy Final Fantasy 14's crafting system.   Hard to acquire recipes... typically involves doing something other than crafting to aquire, grinding reputation, or participating in certain other PvE content (Raid Drop Recipes).    The higher level recipes, known as mastercraft recipes, are earned entirely through crafting.   The problem is you can't have a real profession of crafting if you need to do lots of regular PvE content to progress as one.   You can become one of the richest crafters in the game just through crafting. As soon as you hit 15 on a combat class, you can unlock any and all of the crafting classes.   ...Second, your uniqueness is going to be fleeting, as other smiths do the same content, and get the same recipes. All you are really is a good card catalog of crafting recipes.   Unfortunately, I don't think this can be addressed easily in an MMO   Crafting minigames... They are generally constructed as a pass/fail, or maybe exceptional/pass/fail system.    The crafting minigame in FF14 requires you to do two things, gain progress (completion percentage) and quality (chance to get a high/normal quality result), I'm not a crafter on FF14, so this page can explain it far better than I ever could.   The problem is they are usually pretty arbitrary, and once you learn the mechanics, its just a time waster. Everyone will just by the ""best"" result win items. While there may be some skill in beating the game, you don't really differentiate your product from that made by anyone else who is good at the game.   I can't really comment on this.   Requiring the acquisition of rare materials, possibly bind on pickup materials. Typically these are from PvE, so your back to making the crafter do regular PvE to be a competitive crafter, rather than allowing them to just be a better crafter.   Rare materials can usually be bought on the market board (auction house) for, usually, a large sum of gil (currency). The price of rare materials usually isn't a problem however, because if you're using high level items, you're usually a high level crafter who has a ton of currency/ a crafter who can make up hte money spent through sales of other items.   Specializations trees. Your starting to get there, but the depth is always limited, if there are 2000 smiths on your server, and half are weapon smiths, and 1/3rd of those are sword smiths, your still talking about 300+ sword smiths that you have no was to differentiate yourself from.   I dont think this is what you want to hear, but because of the way FF14 works you can have all 8 crafting classes to max level on one character. In FF14:A Realm Reborn, most crafters were ""omnicrafters."" Omnicrafter meaning they had every crafting class at max level with the best gear and all the mastercraft recipes unlocked. The newest expansion (Heavensward/3.0) is looking to eliminate Omnicrafters with the new specialization system, where a player chooses 3 crafting classes, and can earn the best recipes for these jobs ONLY.   There is of course the related problem that quest/loot based gear acquisition often supplies most/all player gear, and in most MMOs, crafted gear is inferior to end game gear from other sources.   In FF14:ARR, near the end of patch 2.55 (last patch before the expansion) some jobs used crafted gear as their BiS (Best in slot) because of bad stats on raid gear.   Throw in cross server auction houses...   The auction house on FF14 is limited to only the server you're on.    ...and there is rarely a reason to actually interact with a crafter.   Usually you can save a bit of gil by going to a crafter to make an item from materials you gathered/bought instead of buying the crafted item straight off the auction house."
truegaming,3cgw7m,CutterJohn,19,Wed Jul 8 14:30:43 2015 UTC,"...Second, your uniqueness is going to be fleeting, as other smiths do the same content, and get the same recipes. All you are really is a good card catalog of crafting recipes.   Unfortunately, I don't think this can be addressed easily in an MMO   I think the reason this is hard to resolve is that item uniqueness is an utterly artificial concept with few real-life analogues.  No culture held a patent on making a sword, and a 9mm pistol from Company A is pretty much the same as a 9mm pistol from Company B.  The biggest differences in history/reality is a +3% to ""Holds an Edge"" or a -2% ""Chance to Jam"" -- and those kinds of modifiers are kind of dull for games.  The only way you can really highlight uniqueness is to make expertise in a field extremely specialized and extremely difficult to master.  Like, there's not really a generic ""blacksmith"" class.  Instead, there's a highly branched and divergent blacksmith/metalsmith progression tree where if you decide to be an expert at making longswords, that's the only thing you'll ever realistically be good at.  Only longswords. Not armor. Not horseshoes. Not even rapiers.  You are completely specialized in this one style of sword because you need to know exactly how to fold in the right amount of carbon and exactly what thickness to make the steel and exactly how to balance stiffness against brittleness.  In that case, there might only be a couple ""longsword"" guys on the server, and one of them has specialized on Bonus Damage whereas the other one has specialized in Attack Speed and Critical Hit -- so depending on your personal combat build (maybe you have bonus damage on crit), you basically just have your one go-to guy.  But for that to work, you really need to have both combat and crafting be extremely narrowly specialized.   None of this ""Oh, an Epic Axe just dropped from this raid boss?  I'll just trash my sword and use it instead.""  If you spent your whole life fighting with a sword, you're going to suck at using an axe until you've spent just as long mastering it -- and meanwhile your sword skill should decay (or maybe skills never have a cap, in which case you don't need to have them decay -- it just means that you aren't progressing towards Two-Handed Sword Skill X 9001 anymore).  There should also be a system to reward diversification, to avoid having all warriors/crafters just dedicate themselves to swords to make things simple.  Perhaps less popular weapons get a bonus weighted by server population, to represent the fact that people aren't used to defending against a Glaive-Guisarme or whatever.  Sure, there might be fewer people catering to your particular choice of weapon right now, but for a few weeks you'll wreck face in PVP until more people jump on the bandwagon and other players ""learn"" to deal with your weird weapon (i.e. your innate bonus gets reduced as the server population migrates to a more balanced set of weapon choices).  This could auto-balance different weapons instead of having every patch tweak the club vs mace balance for the millionth time.  The obvious problem with all of this, of course, is that it implies a LOT of time/effort to master a skill (combat or crafting) and little flexibility in respeccing.  That sort of thing is very off-putting to many people."
truegaming,3cgw7m,ivan34,15,Tue Jul 7 22:19:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed the crafting system is quite good in FF14 , there was certainly great crafters who could get the best results out of the hardest materials and those who couldn't especially when the crafting difficulty went from macro based to proc based."

All that makes it seem less separate from the rest of the game, vs say WoW where crafting is on a scale of like 1-600 or so instead of the same scale as the normal leveling, and where the only real concerns are unlocking the recipe and finding the materials."

I need to go back to that game and experience the story."
truegaming,3cgw7m,erikb85,40,Wed Jul 8 02:25:02 2015 UTC,"One major reason MMOs have had poor crafting is because MMOs, almost invariably, refuse to destroy equipment. This is almost certainly a necessity for strong crafting gameplay, since, without item turnover, there simply won't be enough work to support crafters.  The second reason is the auction houses/universal marketplaces. You simply can not make any sort of profit with such instant and insane competition, especially when plenty of people are grinding skill ups and selling at a loss.   Witness WoW, where the first few master crafters might be able to make a bit of money, but most everyone else approaches crafting as money loosing proposition that they're getting purely for the utility it grants. It basically becomes another form of power progression.  To me, there are two MMOs that I think have the strongest crafting. SWG, and EVE. Both take different approaches, but they have two things in common, items are constantly removed from players(in EVE, through ship destruction, in SWG, through a non recoverable durability system), and both have regional markets and non instant transfer of goods.  From there, they differ. In EVE, the struggle with crafting is not so much the construction, as the logistics. You can't differentiate your product, but the game is large, and non trivial to traverse, so you can differentiate yourself based on where you are selling, where you source your materials from, etc.   For SWG, travel was much easier, but gear could be crafted with different stats, different materials, and different components, so some crafters could specialize in high end expensive stuff, while others made cheap consumer trash. SWG also lacked a good market(there was one, but it took hefty fees IIRC), and let players set up their own private shops, so there were elements of advertising, and making your storefront look nice. Keeping your vendors well stocked was also important, since people would stop going to your shop if you were sold out.    I designed a crafting game for a PVP game like EVE once, that I thought would go over well. In it, players set up factories to create components from resources, and then use those components to create a final product. In this, its rather like EVEs crafting. The difference was that, one, factories improved with age/use(to simulate the process improvements any factory goes through IRL), and two, players could customize their output by varying three stats. Speed, Effiency, Quality. You'd get X number of points to distribute into those categories as you saw fit, and an older factory would have more points to distribute.  Thus, player manufacturers could differentiate their products and their business styles.  Crafters could then further differentiate their final product by using different components in the final assembly. Using armor type 1 or armor type 2 would lead to a final product with different stats and focus from each other, for instance.  The factories also had a constant manpower cost associated with them, and a factory in a 'nice' place didn't have to pay the employees as much, to encourage ownership of said nice places. Factories in safe/non pvp spots were to be subject to very high taxes, to make them not competitive.  And finally, since it was a PVP game, and the factory progression was tied to a factory instead of a moveable blueprint, it encouraged players to control and maintain territory, and also allowed for technological regression by destroying the factories of your enemies, akin to the strategic bombing campaigns of WW2, something that rarely happens in EVE since BPOs are kept in undestroyable hi-sec stations.  Shame it never came to fruition(the whole project was stupidly overambitious. :D ), but I think it would have worked well."

truegaming,3cgw7m,skandaras,8,Wed Jul 8 00:36:40 2015 UTC,"ctrl f'd Ultima Online.  Because UO was the only game that ever got crafting right. Because it also got player housing right. Because it ALSO got teleportation right.  You could pass out runes that people could cast teleport or gate spells on that would transport them to your house, which you could fill with vendors which would sell your stuff.  Fucking phenomenal. Way more interesting than auction houses. It really felt like you were going shopping. Lots of servers had a ""skymall,"" which would be a giant fucking castle with a shit load of vendors, all nicely decorated."

truegaming,3cgw7m,AdricGod,5,Wed Jul 8 17:21:39 2015 UTC,Do people still play it? I checked in a few years back and there were still some chards with activity. I wouldn't wonder if even 20 years into the future people still have interest in playing it.
truegaming,3cgw7m,DonomerDoric,3,Wed Jul 8 10:22:20 2015 UTC,"I really like Wurm Online's crafting system, things naturally get used up and everything is based around quality. You need high quality tools and skills to make a high quality item. The higher the quality, the better the item will do its job. The skill tree is quite huge and items/tools take damage whenever used."
truegaming,3cgw7m,Acidictadpole,2,Wed Jul 8 11:43:45 2015 UTC,"I have been thinking Wurm the whole way down this thread. To me, it has come the closest to simulating both the temporary nature of what is crafted and the trickle down of quality.   I'd love to know what state the game is in these days though - it is many years since I've played."

They added new servers which speed up skill development immensely and are pvp objective centric, I imagine to cater to the crowd which doesn't have as much time/patience. They've also introduced some more PvE servers but nothing new. I'm aware they released multi story buildings and bridges which sounds lovely, but know nothing beyond this.  It seems like they have a very strong core player base and an inability to grow/shrink it, for better or for worse."
truegaming,3cgw7m,seemarrs,2,Wed Jul 8 10:46:23 2015 UTC,"I think people often overlook the Auction House impact on crafting. It's really discouraging to see any and all items you could potentially make being sold for barely any profit at all. UO had a good set of systems between stand-alone vendors and the runes many vendors would offer runes to their vendor locations at low prices in order for people to use them to return for more goods. Even though UO's crafting was actually very straight forward, I feel that the buying/selling of goods was one of the best I've seen."
truegaming,3cgw7m,BonzoTheBoss,2,Wed Jul 8 12:34:02 2015 UTC,"I think one reason for such insane competition is because everyone is always so compact. Tell me, why do so many (if not ever) MMOs have a ""starter town""? This causes everyone to have their roots in one place and all the other major cities in the game don't get nearly the traffic that this one place does. If you a market with more depth, I think you need to encourage people to spread the market out. As I hinted towards, I'd say this should be done by have a multiple starter town and either removing the players choice of were they end up (since you can't chose where and to whom you're born, right?), or have it be determined by whatever race you selected. I believe this would have the potential for multiple major trade cities to develop instead of just one that is or is near to the games starter town."
truegaming,3cgw7m,Stack0verf10w,3,Wed Jul 8 11:12:13 2015 UTC,"Just having diverse starting points wont be enough. Even if everyone starts off geographically diverse, over time one location, usually centrally located, will start to attract more than its share of people. As soon as this becomes obvious, a self reinforcing cycle begins, as the increased player density attracts traders and crafters, and the increased number of traders and crafters attracts more players. To keep people spread out, you either need a reason not to congregate in one place, something like space shortages for player owned vendors, or a reason to be in another specific location, like a bonus for smiths in once city, and tailors in another."
truegaming,3cgw7m,BonzoTheBoss,49,Wed Jul 8 13:06:38 2015 UTC,"Star Wars Galaxies is always my goto example for an optimal crafting system in an MMO. The recipes weren't obtained from raids or a vendor, they were learned when you skilled up in a particular tree.   Without going into too much detail, SWG had a skill based system that wasn't based on your characters level. When you did something (crafted an item, killed a mob) you got XP relevant to that field (artisan/*smith xp, rifle/sword/pistol/etc xp). You can specialize in a particular type of crafting, like architecture, armorsmithing, weaponsmithing, simply by putting skills relevant to that field. You needed a certain amount of XP in that field to be able to put more skillpoints into it.   Crafting recipes were unlocked when you had skillpoints in that field, so crappy weapons were unlocked early on in the weaponsmith path, and better ones were unlocked later. So all Master Weaponsmiths pretty much had the same schematics.   The interesting part came with gathering ingredients. The ingredients were pretty general, like ""metal"". And there were various subtypes of metal too. Any metal can be used for a metal but its attributes and type determine how good the item is that you produce. So using better materials actually makes a better item!  Materials from high level pve were better than most gathered materials, and therefore were able to go into better versions of items. It also allowed vendors to get their names out there for having the best weapons/armor in the game at the moment."
truegaming,3cgw7m,Uler,15,Wed Jul 8 15:43:00 2015 UTC,"I really regret missing Star Wars Galaxies when it was in its prime. Where the materials in a clear progression, or would there be tradeoffs?"
truegaming,3cgw7m,aqwszxderfc,17,Tue Jul 7 21:28:16 2015 UTC,"Materials were dependent on what they were AND their quality in some cases. For example you may need Giant Peko-Peko feathers from Peko-Pekos on Naboo. At max level they were easy to kill, and you had a chance to get a Peko-Peko feather and that was it.  For other segments, the material had a quality rating out of 1000. Ore for example that was very high quality could sometimes only be found in the PVP area of space(Kessel).  On top of everything when you were crafting you had optimization and tuning points specific to crafting. So ultimately if you had the highest quality materials possible, along with a full set of talents to support crafting, along with a full set of gear dedicated to maxing your optimization and experimentation points, you could get some truly awesome gear out of it.  Jedi had a whole separate step regarding lightsaber experimentation too. SWG truly was my favorite crafting in any game and set my MMO playstyle forever."
truegaming,3cgw7m,BattleStag17,2,Tue Jul 7 21:37:50 2015 UTC,"An important thing to note here is the fact all items had decay, and nothing was permanent."
truegaming,3cgw7m,Acidictadpole,2,Tue Jul 7 21:54:42 2015 UTC,"Forgive my ignorance but... If SWG was such an awesome game (you're not the first to extoll it's virtues, I have a friend who misses it dearly) why was it shut down?  Did the game actually just lose too many players as time went, or was it simply not profitable so the company shut it down?"
truegaming,3cgw7m,gigafaunca,2,Thu Jul 9 05:30:34 2015 UTC,"The issue with SWG was that you can look at it as three completely different games. First there was PRE-CU, then there was POST-CU, and finally the NGE.  The CU was the ""Combat Upgrade"" and the NGE was ""New Game Enhancements."" It is important to note that the game launched with players being able to have a very unique experience and that changed for the better in some ways and worse in others with the combat upgrade. A lot of people left when the CU hit because they changed how a lot of the game worked mechanically. Originally there were HP/Mind/Stamina bars to keep track of and after the CU they did away with a lot of the mechanics behind those(falling down if you ran out of mind for example). The CU also made it much easier to become a jedi, which was still a time consuming thing to do.  The game in my opinion was still a very playable, fun game after the CU. Ultimately I think the games downfall was that WoW launched and started pulling a lot of subs away. With that being the case, they tried to update the game to be more like WoW and in the process ruined a lot of the fundamentally fun aspects of the game. I would say the nail in the coffin for SWG was when they launched the pre-orders for the Mustafar expansion, and then had the ""New Game Enhancements."" The NGE completely changed the game to be much more like WoW, without all of the quality of life stuff and graphics of WoW. Combine that with the fact that they just took pre-orders for the expansion, and then completely changed the game without any notice, and you got a lot of pissed off people. Sony actually was hit with a class action lawsuit which I think they lost over the whole situation.  TLDR: WoW came out and they changed the game for the worse with somewhat shady tactics which lead to player decline."

truegaming,3cgw7m,FrancisGalloway,13,Fri Jul 10 14:37:29 2015 UTC,"Each material had a number of attributes; things like conductivity/durability/potential energy. Different materials also had higher/lower limits (i.e. copper almost always has more conductivity than steel, but lesser toughness) Another particular note was the experiment/prototyping bit, it did have a crafting minigame with RNG of a sorts, and you'd basically experiment trying to get a good result which you could then turn into a blueprint to make X number of that model before the blueprint was used up.  It should also be kept in mind that every weapon/armor in SWG decayed with use, you could repair them but the durability would take a slight permanent hit every time, inevitably removing that item from the game for all intents.  So the highest damage weapons would be a high material roll and then a high experiment roll, and then probably be a bit fragile due to trying to maximize the damage output. It'd be an expensive weapon you pulled out rarely for certain encounters (contesting a base in PvP most likely). And you'd have a number of cheaper, weaker but more durable weapons for everyday use."

truegaming,3cgw7m,nifboy,2,Wed Jul 8 02:21:09 2015 UTC,"There wasn't really any kind of progression in the currently understood sense of the word. In WoW, you'd start off mining copper, then iron, and then silver and gold or whatnot, and the similar level crafting items would take their respective metals to make.  In SWG metals were periodically ""cycled"" into different areas. Planets would be refreshed and get new heatmaps of a particular set of resources, and then you could set up harvester buildings in non-city zones which cost money and an energy resource to harvest (or you could harvest it with your character, which was less efficient as it required you to be there). Each time the resources got recycled, a new set of essentially randomly generated materials got placed on each planet, with random attributes (I'm pretty sure they weren't entirely random, but for all intents and purposes they were)."
truegaming,3cgw7m,erikb85,2,Wed Jul 8 04:23:03 2015 UTC,I remember non-crafters actually making it a point to run around the planets tracking down the hard to find materials after a cycle and selling the location information to the crafters for boku bucks.

truegaming,3cgw7m,Fairwhetherfriend,13,Tue Jul 7 22:20:41 2015 UTC,"There has hardly been a lot of progress in terms of improving anything in MMOs for a long time. I mean hell, WoW was released 11 years ago. Yet I still see it's mechanics (since it was popular) so heavily relied on in today's gaming world.   I think a bulk of the issue lies with risk vs reward with MMOs. MMOs are expensive as hell to make, expensive to maintain(and expected to maintain) post launch. One little mistake and it can all come crashing down. Too much like WoW, too little like WoW, too easy, too hard, too confusing, too boring, etc; these are all common complaints I've seen with MMOs. If it even has one of those, it can cut big time into your profits.   So everyone keeps on tagging onto the thing that is big (WoW) since it is believed that it is proven to work. Only now that we've seen many MMOs die or heavily low populated that developers are starting to take risks since the old formula is no longer working. I expect Tera and Guild Wars 2 to be two major MMOs that will most likely have things adapted or inspired from.   As for crafting, the thing about crafting is that not everyone likes to do it. I wont say its a sizable population, but it's still a pretty large population. The issue of the Why is the big thing. Were not sure if its because of design or people just don't like the concept of crafting. Like, would they rather be out there adventurer or sitting in town crafting stuff? So crafting is designed to sort of leech onto the other major forms of content to help get people to do it. They also are often focused for low learning curve. I've also started seeing a big trend where crafting doesn't offer anything unique, in that the items it can make can be bought or dropped.  I think Guild Wars 2 is going to be the major player in progressing crafting. They've been doing a lot of work on crafting since release. Legendary Weapons, Mawdrey, Spinal Blades, etc; these are probably the best crafting experiences I've seen. With collections coming into major play with the new legendary system, it will be interesting to see how it improves."
truegaming,3cgw7m,erikb85,4,Wed Jul 8 01:17:42 2015 UTC,"I loathe crafting with a passion. Farming mats, finding recipes, etc. I consider it a massive waste of time and I'd love it if I didn't have to do it at all.   Luckily GW2 let me do just that. I could buy the second-highest tier stuff off the market for pretty cheap and do fine in WvW because the highest tier stuff, which can only be crafted, offers only a marginal bonus. I think it was like a purple weapon does 1200 dmg and an orange does 1100. I'm going off memory, but it wasn't a lot.   I stopped playing for other reasons but I did love that in about a thousand hours I spent maybe 30 minutes crafting anything."
truegaming,3cgw7m,TedTheViking,9,Tue Jul 7 23:35:15 2015 UTC,"If you look at MMOs that have really solid crafting/economy experiences (Eve, Puzzle Pirates, FFXIV), there is already a big differentiating factor between ""good"" crafters and ""great"" crafters.  What makes a great crafter is the ability to play the market.   You don't need to make ""better"" goods, you need to make the right goods, sold at the right time for the right price.  Also, I want to pick on this one point in your question:   How would you create a crafting system that was immersive, deep, and could have an end game of its own, independent from other content in the game?   The answer to the independence question is, you can't. For crafting to have any meaning it has to feed into the PvE or PvP systems. The PvE design team has balance based on the equipment available to the players, and if Realm A has a grandmaster swordsmith churning out Masamune+10's to everybody and Realm B doesn't, then at least one of those two realms is going to have a really bad PvE experience.  Also, you absolutely don't want the auction house to be the go-to place for the best gear in a PvE game, because it makes your boss loot suck. That's the lesson of Diablo 3 Vanilla."
truegaming,3cgw7m,TheCodexx,6,Wed Jul 8 14:21:09 2015 UTC,"I play Eve, and its not really crafting so much as being an industry mogul. Outside of super capital production, from the actual crafting side, its just a matter of doing it. The from ammo to Capital Ships, the item you produce is identical to every other one of the same type. Most production goes through the Jita 4-4 market, so its just a matter of picking the right thing to make. But when I buy 15 dictors to ship out to our staging system, fit and sell, I just buy the cheapest ones on market, because they are all the same. I have no reason to care who actually built it."
truegaming,3cgw7m,NookNookNook,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:00:15 2015 UTC,"I have played Eve only for a short time until now. But I assumed when you get into bigger sized endeavours being able to offer reliable, regular high volumes becomes a unique selling point. I mean, there should be corps that need more ammo than you can buy in Jita, at least when you have to buy and ship the amounts daily. Isn't that the case?"
truegaming,3cgw7m,Daffan,3,Tue Jul 7 22:52:09 2015 UTC,"Jump Freighters make it too easy to move things around. (And in highsec, you have even bigger/cheaper regular freighters) There ends up being very little that it doesn't make sense to just buy from Jita. You may be able to justify it with basic ammo, where the JF charges could add up to 50% to the price, but even at the higher price, for the price of a middle of the road ship, you could by a couple million rounds of ammo, its just that cheap. If you use faction ammo, which everyone in PvP does, and many do in PvE, JF fees drop to about 2-3% of the cost of the ammo.  If you can source materials locally in 0.0, you can make money producing for the local market, but space holding alliances don't rely on it, as there is virtually unlimited volume on most items available from Jita with tolerable costs to move it. Its actually a major factor holding back 0.0 industry."

The most obvious solution to this for me is to remove gear drops from bosses and replace them with bound-to-player crafting item drops. Have a system where you have to track down a master crafter and present them with the drops through a special interface and have them craft it on the spot."
truegaming,3cgw7m,not_exactly_myself,3,Wed Jul 8 14:59:57 2015 UTC,"While this sounds like a good idea in theory, in practice I think it would add a step of pure annoyance both to the person with the drop and to the crafter. Getting any new piece of gear would require a crafter to be available (meaning a wait time, and the hassle of actually figuring out who they are), and the crafter would be constantly getting messages."
truegaming,3cgw7m,Rossco1337,3,Wed Jul 8 04:54:54 2015 UTC,"Actually having to interacting with crafters should be part of what makes in an multiplayer game, and helps build an actual sense of community. However, crafting materials shouldn't bind on pickup with very few exceptions, part of building the community is having a vibrant trade economy, and excessive binding on pickup undermines that. Adventurers should be able to form relationships with traders who buy what they bring in, who then form relationships with crafters, who buy the materials and build the gear, who then form relationships with adventurers who buy the gear to use. But if there is any depth to the crafting element, adventurers may not want to sit around waiting while their gear takes time to craft. Depending on the crafting system, you may have multiple crafters, traders and raw resource collectors (if they come from non-adventurer sources) all contribute in various ways to the eventual production of a legendary high-end piece of equipment. Its the difference between buying an item on amazon, and going into your neighborhood store, where the proprietor has known you for years, and knows what you like/dislike etc..."
truegaming,3cgw7m,not_exactly_myself,6,Wed Jul 8 06:05:59 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'd argue that you can make the best tier goods available from the auction house. Guild Wars 2 did exactly that (and still does, by a certain definition) and there's no problem with that at all."
truegaming,3cgw7m,erikb85,2,Wed Jul 8 14:57:11 2015 UTC,"I like your first point. But what you actually say is that there is no crafting skill involved, but trading skill. There are good and great traders, not good and great crafters. Knowing what your customer wants and how to price the items you sell are trading skills. Crafting then is merely one of a few differnt ways to source the things you trade. In Eve and probably the others as well, flipping items is very possible as well (buying low, selling high)."

truegaming,3cgw7m,theNightblade,7,Wed Jul 8 09:38:31 2015 UTC,"The problem is that outside of consumables there is no continued demand. In UO, everyone's armor and weapons decayed, and they lost them if they died. It meant everyone always had something of some value on them, and extra armor sets were useful. Compare to WoW, where resources are free and easy to collect, just time consuming, and they're only used for temporary buff items and occasional equipables. Armor comes from raids and is soul bound. Breaking it is temporary, not permanent. The maintenance cost is a player tax and gold sink, not a part of the economy, because players don't get payed to do the repairs. NPCs do.  Basically you need to offload more tasks onto players and let them deal with demand. A simple capitalist economy effectively forms itself as long as a currency is provided and doesn't hyper inflate."

truegaming,3cgw7m,MachaHack,7,Wed Jul 8 05:35:30 2015 UTC,"I came here to say what pretty much every other top poster in this thread has also said. Star Wars Galaxies had the absolute best crafting system of any MMO anywhere ever. On each server, there was ""that guy"" who made the absolute best weapons or armor. You wanted that guy in your guild, because being a good crafter meant a lot more than just sitting in front of an interface and hitting ""craft"" over and over again.  Gathering the materials to produce large scale arms and armament required you to participate in non-combat activities like surveying and exploration to find ideal sites for your harvesters. Every resource in the game was procedurally generated and spread across half a dozen planets randomly with varying degrees of quality for each different attribute. People who snag ""perfect"" or ""near-perfect"" resource locations as they appear each month can make a killing just selling them to other crafters.  Of course, getting one perfect resource is meaningless if you use low-grade crap for the rest of the item. You need to have patience and dedication to get the resources you need with a high enough quality.  Even after you've gathered enough high quality materials, you still have experiment points to spend. You can use them to enhance certain qualities of weapons, such as min damage, max damage, attack speed, efficiency, etc. Depending on the type of weapon, the attributes you want to focus on, and the type and quality of the materials you use you can get vastly different results by putting points in different areas. Then, you make a prototype, turn it into a blueprint and mass produce them to sell to customers in your own player-run store.  I was always amazed when I would find unpopular or ""weak"" items with absolutely amazing stats on random vendors out in the wilderness. Most players were only concerned with ""can I use the best gun/sword for my class?"" and ""what's the max damage?"". Average weaponsmiths could still make money selling these items because they would always sell really well. But the legendary crafters were the ones who could turn garbage items into prized treasures with the right combination of resources and resource quality.  To this day, nobody has ever successfully emulated the Star Wars Galaxies system of crafting. The only thing I could imagine that would ever surpass that in terms of video game mechanics would be if, in addition to all of the above, you could customize the appearance on a level beyond just color palette or model swaps, where you literally customize the geometry of a weapon which determines it's hitbox and maybe some stats too."
truegaming,3cgw7m,erikb85,7,Wed Jul 8 13:52:00 2015 UTC,Its strange that FFXIV isn't mentioned at all in this when it has probably the most interesting crafting system I have seen before.

Ships get destroyed Resources need to be gathered of purchased (and yes the crafter is not the most efficient gatherer most of the times) There are class of ships that you cannot safely keep unless  you are part of a large corporation which holds territorial supremacy in which you can ""park"" your ship, I am talking about the mothership and the titan, you cant hide them in an NPC station, and they cost the most to purchase. Blueprints (recipies) are perisable most of the time The best places to sell your merchandise is in hostile territory and unless your Corporation holds supremacy, and even then its never 100% safe to haul cargo in that territory   All in all it seems that a game where you have to fly(wear) what you can afford to loose its a preety good place to build a crafting system."
truegaming,3cgw7m,danthemango,3,Wed Jul 8 07:34:55 2015 UTC,"EVE's got a great crafting system if you have literally years to spend playing it. I've not touched it in a long time but I doubt they've changed it significantly.   Crafting in highsec requires three things to make a profit: faction standings, skills and researched BPOs   To get faction standing, you have to grind the same PvE/delivery missions for actual days to get a competitive cut for one NPC's station facilities How do you get the required skills? You buy a book, click a queue and exit the game for 1-18+ days. To do any sort of crafting in highsec that doesn't result in a net loss, you need at least a year of training in the Social, Science and Production trees. Well researched blueprints. I'm not even going to pretend I know much about these but apparently the margins are so thin on the low end stuff that you need to have maxed skills and extremely expensive blueprints to break even unless you're willing to risk everything to try and sell them in some barren NPCnull zone.     The barrier of entry to crafting in EVE is months of research both in and out of game - no exaggeration. Even when you know what you're doing, the skill-queue puts up an artificial barrier of entry that can only be broken down by paying for a character or paying a subscription fee to not do anything for years. Sure, you can still craft sub-optimally but it'll cost a lot of time and money on top of the time and money you need to spend doing everything else.  Crafting outside of highsec isn't much different. I played in a nullsec alliance with the goal of managing item production for them. As it turns out, you need to build years of trust with corps and alliances with PvP (and I found PvP to be a total waste of time in that game) before they'll even let you touch their production gear due to the intentionally backstab-friendly permission system.  I played for over a year and never managed to craft a single item. EVE is not a game to recommend to people who are looking for rewarding crafting systems. It might have been a good recommendation 10 years ago but unless something has changed drastically without me hearing about it, I doubt there's any more room for new crafters in EVE."
truegaming,3cgw7m,Sukutak,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:09:33 2015 UTC,"well the fun part was that even if you were not a skilled crafter, you could do missions in nullsec get a faction blueprint for loyality points and turn that into a good profit. The whole system is ok because it has perisable components, from blueprints to ships that you loose so the items dont get inflated in the market, you always have loses that at least tone down the other MMO issues about items not being lost at all."
truegaming,3cgw7m,erikb85,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:10:09 2015 UTC,"While I have to agree in theory, in practice I found EVE to be extremely boring. I tried many different things and even spent some real money to get more ingame available to test out. But every activity was really boring due to the way it was implemented. I can't really say why, but in Diablo 2, or ESO as a newer example, it is really fun to interact with your items. In EVE I never had this feeling.  But I only played for a month. Many people say that's too little to really experience Eve. Maybe that's why."
truegaming,3cgw7m,crypticthree,3,Wed Jul 8 10:52:08 2015 UTC,"Just as a starting point, I've wondered about customizing material compositions. To continue with the swordsmith, the real life equivalent would be controlling the carbon content of a sword to provide an optimum mix of sharpness, and durability. In a fantasy setting, other traits and materials could be added for complexity. But the problem here is that someone may spend a ton of time figuring out what works best, what will be most valued by buyers, only to have another person right a guide with instructions allowing anyone else who grinded the skills to make the same sword.   How do you preserve the value of the time spent figuring it out, and differentiating yourself as a crafter, when someone can just go the wiki and catch right up far more easily once anyone releases a guide? You could have a skill component, where you get better at making a certain blend, but now its just another skill tree, with other people sharing your branch. You could have a deeper, more complex minigame, but then your really just playing the minigame, which just seems somewhat hollow..."
truegaming,3cgw7m,ohheyaubrie,2,Wed Jul 8 11:37:48 2015 UTC,"Someone's always going to write a guide despite how complicated a particular MMO subsystem is. The only way around it is to make crafting have some variety, and have that variety be viable, and limit crafting characters to a certain number of skill trees.  So instead of one generic Blacksmith job who'll then simply craft All The Things, force players to pick whether they want to craft X, Y, or Z. Also limit player accounts so everybody doesn't simply go ""fuck the system, I will just create 3 blacksmiths on my own account"" which is what many players do. They'd have to stick to 1 or 2, and on top of that they'd have to pick what subspecialization for their crafter to do.  It might not get rid of the hordes of cookie cutter crafters but forcing some variety on them will help spread the numbers a bit."
truegaming,3cgw7m,Cyval,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:44:42 2015 UTC,Didn't WoW used to do this?  Like back in WotLK?  I remember having to specialize in a certain leatherworking tree way back when.
truegaming,3cgw7m,dankisms,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:23:48 2015 UTC,"You remember right, and it was like that since vanilla (though I am not sure if it was in the game at launch). I know because I made oodles and oodles of Nature Resist gear for AQ40, as the only qualified leatherworker in my guild :p  I remember having to look up what items each branch could craft before I picked one because I didn't know if you could reset/reroll your specialisation after picking it.  They have since removed both the specialisations from the job system, and I believe the previously unique recipes were simply stripped of their specialisation requirements. Yay homogeneity!"
truegaming,3cgw7m,lubujackson,4,Wed Jul 8 13:03:59 2015 UTC,"My biggest problems with crafting systems in most MMOs are how complex they are for no good reason. What I mean is the fact that they require expensive recipes and expensive/rare materials, and the crafting level system some games use (separating weapons crafting level from armor crafting level, from accessory crafting level, etc), which quickly becomes an extremely boring grind, in my opinion. I shouldn't need to forge a hundred daggers just so I can get the level high enough to make swords, and so on. The best crafting system in any MMO to me, and the one that makes the most sense, ironically is the one in the first MMO I've ever played, Runescape. It unifies all these different ""crafting levels"" into one or two. Those who have played will know what I'm talking about. The ""Smelting"" skill works for anything that involves working with metal, be it melting ores or turning them into something else. All I have to do is work on increasing that one skill. If want to make a sword, I'll mine some material, make a bar out of it, and make a sword out of that, in a matter of minutes. No need to find that one item that only one mob drops once every thousand identical ones you kill. It's simple and satisfying. I get that MMO developers feel the need to add some kind of extra grind to increase the playtime, but I'd rather play something that doesn't resort to cheap tricks when it comes to crafting, and actually make me enjoy doing it."
truegaming,3cgw7m,onemanandhishat,3,Wed Jul 8 15:50:37 2015 UTC,"Runescape's crafting system has its own flaws though. Back when I played at least, the endgame for runescape was just leveling more skills so eventually everyone levelled their skills. But this meant that pretty much across the board, crafting materials were worth more than finished items because the raw materials represented xp + the finished good."
truegaming,3cgw7m,MojoPinnacle,2,Tue Jul 7 21:42:00 2015 UTC,"ESO also combines many skills to one. If I make a sword, increase it's value with some additional materials or magic, then melt it down to it's components to make something else, I didn't train three different skills but one three times.  But if you think about it more deeply, I think all RPG elements are cheap tricks in the end. The reason a sword with a green name is more valuable to me than a sword with a white text is because I had to grind a few white ones at first before I was able to get my hands on my first green one. Levelling, no matter how, also is basically making simple numbers bigger. The magic is in how these cheap tricks are combined, right?"

truegaming,3cgw7m,Shai23,3,Wed Jul 8 09:50:17 2015 UTC,"I have never played an MMO before, can I get a tldr of what the crafting in MMOs is like? The only thing I think of when someone says crafting is Minecraft."
truegaming,3cgw7m,r_barberque,5,Wed Jul 8 14:36:41 2015 UTC,"Usually you get component items, either as monster drops or through mining/gathering plants/whatever, and turn them into items. That part is similar to minecraft, but generally instead of putting items in a certain shape to make a recipe, you have a list of recipes (either purchased from somewhere, found through experimentation, or just given for free) where you can just click 'Bronze sword' and itll take a hilt+2 bronze bars or so from your inventory and give you that item back.   It's usually tied to some kind of level, so you need to make a certain amount of bronze items before moving up to a higher quality of material, unlike minecraft where a brand new player can be given diamond and sticks and make endgame tools.  There's a bit of variation from game to game, like FFXIV tieing crafting to a minigame where you need to have sufficient gear/use proper abilities to make an item successfully, with a chance of 'high quality' items with better stats, or Wildstar where you could customize the stats on the gear and can use more expensive components to increase that stat budget, but that's the general gist of it."
truegaming,3cgw7m,xanax_charmanda,3,Wed Jul 8 01:49:21 2015 UTC,"Crafting in MMOs is like crafting in other RPGs as well. That also includes Minecraft. I'd even say that Minecraft is very MMO like, because many people will play it together over the net."
truegaming,3cgw7m,slapdashbr,2,Wed Jul 8 02:21:33 2015 UTC,I think Minecraft is absolutely an MMO. It's not MMORPG (unless you mod it which many do).
truegaming,3cgw7m,easywriter,2,Wed Jul 8 11:18:47 2015 UTC,"Basically: Get these 6 items, put them into these boxes, press enter, get this weapon. Sometimes get a +1 version. Or it's like get these 6 things and make this, get these 4 things and make this, then put those 2 things together to get this armor. Pretty recipe-like, not much room for creativity."
truegaming,3cgw7m,BattleStag17,2,Wed Jul 8 15:51:40 2015 UTC,"You go out into the world and gather things, then you head to a trainer, learn some skills to make items that you don't need so you can raise your crafting skill level to unlock more items that you don't need until your crafting skill is maxed. Often crafted items will (finally) be useful when you hit end game content and need to get geared for the introductory raids, you will replace them quickly but may be able to sell them off to people on an ongoing basis as new people keep hitting max level. Usually the endgame markets are more oriented around limited duration buff effects that are required for that endgame raiding; and socketing/enchanting/augmenting items where there will be a thing that you do to a piece of gear to make it better, so that every time you get a better piece of gear you need to do that thing to it again."
truegaming,3cgw7m,okuRaku,2,Wed Jul 8 02:26:38 2015 UTC,"It's not too far removed from that. The basics is that you have an input material, then you activate a crafting skill which then processes the material into the output item. Generally whether you fail or succeed the input material(s) is lost. Progressing in your crafting skills either shortens crafting time, increases success rate, and/or unlocks additional crafting recipes."
truegaming,3cgw7m,okuRaku,12,Wed Jul 8 02:55:20 2015 UTC,"There's some interesting differences in how crafting is idealized vs. how MMORPGs operate.  For instance, the idea of crafting the ""ultimate named sword"", the Masamune sword or whatever, come first from history (specifically Japan) and then from early RPGs (mostly from Japan) and that's the ""so cool"" ideal for crafting that people want to feel in a game.  Now in MMORPGs the whole system is built around everyone doing exactly the same quests with exactly the same NPCs and the same pool of items.  So crafting, kind of by default, fits into this model of producing known quantities that can be modeled against class balancing, raid balancing, PvP balancing, etc.  So having a few ""greatest swords"" in the game can unbalance a lot of things and also means that once a crafter makes a super sword they either can keep making them forever (oversupply) or they are so insanely tedious to make that they suck all the life out of the game.  I guess the best version of that is what it takes to make a big ship in EVE Online (many people contributing a jillion hours and spacebucks or whatever) but that doesn't jive with the ideal of the old blind swordsmith on the top of the mountain.  Ok, so that's the bad news.  Of course, there are some ways to inch closer to the ideal without messing everything up.  Off the top of my head, something like a Guitar Hero rhythm type game emulating the hammer and anvil process of making a sword could be a good metaphor.  That way if you get 80% perfect timing you make a good sword, 95% would be a great sword and then more rarely the 100% perfect sword would have a bonus of some kind.  Of course leveling up speed, etc. would allow better weapons, or maybe this would just be used to determine the weapon durability.  At least something like this could get rid of the ""yes/no"" minigames that currently exist, and some people would be naturally better at this than others, which feels more authentic.  Another side of it is the whole ""seeking out the great swordsmith"" element, which really doesn't exist at all in MMORPGs.  At best, MMORPGs make the recipe require a rare item that can only be found through some elaborate quest, but this usually results in the crafter just buying supplies on the market or having their guild supply them and there's no real personal relationship between the swordwielder and the swordmaker.  One idea might be to make the swordmaker somehow bound to the weapon (at least any ""named weapon"" they produce) such that if the person wielding it dies too often or doesn't use the weapon enough the crafter loses some ability.  On the other hand if the weapon is well-used and the player is skillful, the crafter would be honored in some way.  This could create a cool symbiotic relationship between crafters and players, such that the best players would be sought out by the best crafters and vice versa.  With a limited number of ""named weapons,"" something like this could deepen relationships well beyond just buying stuff from auction."
truegaming,3cgw7m,theswerto,6,Wed Jul 8 03:36:23 2015 UTC,"If you adopt the player-driven economy idea that a couple of people have suggested you may be able to control the supply of the top quality weapons the same you do in real life - by charging a lot. Then only the most successful adventurers etc would be able to afford the best weapons. Exclusivity is part of what drives desirability, so its in the smith's interest not to just churn them out for everyone. I do like the idea that the smith can be tied to the exploits of the user though - perhaps by allowing everyone to see who crafted the weapon.  This way there would also be room for people who churned out cheap but low quality weaponry that they could sell to new players."
truegaming,3cgw7m,Carighan,2,Tue Jul 7 22:26:20 2015 UTC,"I've seen cartels attempted in games, and even seen them work for a time, but eventually someone comes along who wont play ball, and you run into the tragedy of the commons problem. If there are 10 of us, and we all agree to sell our swords which cost 50g to make for 200g each, and there are 40 swords purchased a day, we each make ((200-50)40/10) 600g a day in profit by not flooding the market. But if the new guy comes along and decides he would rather make 40 swords a day and sell them for 100g each, he makes ((100-50)40) 2000g profit by undercutting us and breaking the cartel.  You need a really tight nit crafting community, with a high barrier of entry to even hope to pull off a cartel when your output is fungible. Now if my swords are basically unique, and someone can't, or at least cannot without great effort produce identical ones, only then I can decide to limit supply as you propose."
truegaming,3cgw7m,SewenNewes,3,Wed Jul 8 01:48:57 2015 UTC,"The reason crafting is an add is because it is difficult to make crafting thrilling or compelling. No risk of death. Turning the game into a job makes it like real life.  FFXI had useful crafting in its hey day because money was scarce and crafting was incredibly tedious and expensive to level, but you needed crafters to make the best items. As soon as the game became more solo friendly, where players could easily acquire money (and in fact money became practically obsolete with a new point system), crafting was no longer lucrative.  In many ways I think that crafting can't be fun for it to be useful. The ultimate goal is to make money right? If it is fun and easy, everyone wants to do it. Then anyone can craft, no one can sell their products for much because everyone has access to them. The only thing sought over is raw materials for the items you need to make. Which requires you to do combat, presumably.   Basic supply and demand. More crafters means lower prices for their goods and lower payouts."

Personally, I want deep, well-made crafting mini-games that are fun in the long-term - but that's me. The problem I had with SWG's crafting is that it was a progress quest. You basically did boring things to make better weapons which made you famous across the server (and wealthy), but the downside was that it was really boring - especially after you got to master and you even lost the progress quest bit of it.  Still, it was a neat and very different experience that I already did once, so I'll let another obsessive player do it in Crowfall. Have fun!  Wow. Just did a search of the thread and I'm the only one to mention Crowfall after you basically described their crafting system as your ideal. Google it."

truegaming,3cgw7m,OktoberStorm,5,Wed Jul 8 06:13:04 2015 UTC,"Cubeworld (I know, I know) had a pretty nifty crafting system.

truegaming,3cgw7m,vazzaroth,2,Thu Jul 9 19:32:47 2015 UTC,"This isn't specific to MMOs, but I really wish a crafting system existed where you actually put the parts together.  Say you wanted to make a spear. You'd have a stick, a knife, and some bonding agent. You move the knife to where you would attach it on the end of the stick, and how you attach them would determine how the weapon functions (straight off the end is a spear, at a right angle would be more like an axe or pike). Then you attach them with whatever bonding agent you have, be it duct tape or superglue, and that will help determine the weapon's durability.  Too in-depth for any game to bother doing, unfortunately. Much easier to have a grocery list you throw into a pot that spits out a product."

truegaming,3cgw7m,ohheyaubrie,2,Wed Jul 8 04:45:34 2015 UTC,"Yes they have.  There are many games that have done crafting different and better than world of warcraft.   SWTOR got rid of the grind by allowing you to send companions out to go gather things, on top of that there are no real super rare recipes you don't get from reverse engineering things you craft anyways. SWTOR also doesn't have you sitting there crafting something for 10 minutes with a cast bar, instead you send your companions to go craft it. All crafting related things in SWTOR are called crew skills, and your crew of (6 by default, 9 with extra characters by the end of this month) can go out and collect, craft, and research for you. Every crafting and gathering skill also comes with bonuses that can be used in the world - for instance slicing can open certain doors and scavenging can open certain paths in instances. ESO handles things differently than most MMO crafting systems. Every single item starts off being crafted at white quality, at which point you are able to improve it. Just like in SWTOR there is an option to get materials without going out and running circles to mining nodes, though that is still an efficient option - in this you can break down items of a certain level to get materials, or have a hireling deliver materials to you once a day. On top of that, ESO has multiple layers to the crafting and customization that really set it apart from the default. SWG did crafting right and wrong at the same time. It had one of the most complex gathering and crafting systems in the MMO market. Crafting had varying levels of success that were modified by buffs you had, where you were crafting, and the materials you were crafting with. This increased the quality of the item, and thus the stats and look the item would have. On top of that there was customization you could do while crafting to increase the odds of good stats, or add cool additions to your crafted item. To top it off, SWG had a very polished market system that allowed you to set up your own bazaar in a property you owned for other players to come by and browse your wares, at which point you could then sell your goods."
truegaming,3cgw7m,prairiewest,2,Wed Jul 8 08:14:50 2015 UTC,"My best memory of crafting so far is, oddly enough, Ragnarok Online. Merchant class, hooooo!  That's essentially what we need, tbh. I need to be able to be a crafter. Or a merchant.  Say you have 3 archetypes with a bunch of specs:   Adventurer Crafter Merchant   Adventurers specialize into classes such as Warrior, Thief, Mage etc. The usual fare. Crafters specialize into Weaponsmith, etc. Merchant is tricky, not sure what to spec in.  Oh, and I should mention: you pick the archetype per account. So merchant would need specs, just not sure which.  Anyhow, adventurers obviously don't craft.

The Pokémon series somewhat stumbled on to what I think is probably the closest crafting system to what you described. It's been a while since I played but I remember every Pokémon forum having a huge section for trading posts. There were certainly players who were very skilled at breeding Pokémon that offered a competitive edge due to their stats and moveset. Ultimately cheat devices and cloning glitches limited the market to just people who were opposed to ""non-legit"" monsters for whatever reason but an MMO wouldn't have the same issues since they have cheat detection and such."
truegaming,3cgw7m,FlamingSwaggot,2,Wed Jul 8 07:22:07 2015 UTC,"Vanguard actually solved the problem of the market being flooded with skill-up items being sold at a loss, by making the easiest way to level crafting tied to Orders from crafting NPCs which often netted you statless no-drop items that were just used for handing in the quest for a few crafting gear upgrades. The game had other problems but it was quite good when it came to crafting.  Another game that took some risks was Xsyon. Learning recipes was (seemingly) random. So many crafters could have varying recipes. It's a good/bad system for that reason. But at least initially you would have some people with certain recipes that others did not."
truegaming,3cgw7m,scrollbreak,2,Wed Jul 8 10:41:50 2015 UTC,"Crafting only works when there is item decay or item lose.  See Runescape, EVE, Ultima Online.  All three have (UO before AoS expansion) thriving economies because items were destroyed, lost and used - therefore the economy kept requiring new items - therefore professions never took a backseat or were a side-bonus.   How would you create a crafting system that was immersive, deep, and could have an end game of its own, independent from other content in the game?   I don't have to invent anything.

truegaming,3cgw7m,theecakee,2,Wed Jul 8 11:15:39 2015 UTC,"Crafting in MMOs sucks when you have a source of items that can be better, ie, Raiding.  It's like, why bother gathering all the mats and paying someone to make me a bad ass sword.. when i can get an even badass-er sword for free when raiding?  WoW has that problem and Blizzard tried to fix it by allowing players to upgrade their stuff but it still falls short to raiding due to Looking for Raid feature.  But if you make crafting make better items then bosses drop, then poeple feel pressured that they have to grind to get a good weapon/armor and then feel cheated that bosses that are super hard to do... doesn't drop an upgrade.   It's a catch 22!  So you need to focus on things that DON'T get outdated quickly and is complimentary to what you can get from other sources, like enchants, gems that you then attach to your gear that you get from raiding.  Oh and customisation of said gear. Thats super important in today's mmos. You wanna be able to stand out."

I don't think ESO's crafting system is terrible, necessarily.  The problem usually lies in the fact that there are leveled items, so even if you use crafting to improve or create a better item for your level, after leveling up a bit you'll just aquire a better item in the game through adventuring or whatever.    I don't have a solution but it definitely needs to be addressed by game developers."
truegaming,3cgw7m,kensai01,2,Wed Jul 8 15:01:48 2015 UTC,"For crafting to work, to really work as a mechanic, it can't be a sideline activity and it can't be in competition to getting better loot off of random drops.  Crafting has to be hard work and it has to result in something unique that you can't get anywhere else.  I've played 20 years of RPG's and a few MMO's and I'm currently playing Witcher 3.  Weapon and armor drops that scale up with your level are the bane of crafting (and game immersion too).  Why would a random soldier be wearing better armor then the armor you just completed an epic quest for?  It's ludicrous. This is a constant problem in RPGs and MMOs.    The problem is that developers don't have the balls to make hard games that don't offer instant rewards for every little thing you do.  I am loving Witcher 3, don't get me wrong, but I wish I could get more excited about special loot that did not become obsolete after 2 minutes."

My conviction is that a crafting system based on real life processes and methods is far more intuitive and enjoyable."

If I had to pick one, it would be to get rid of loot drops from enemies. For the entire game. Or at least, make them drop very basic weapons only. Make them drop materials. Make the combat focused players bring those to crafting focused players to get the weapons they want.   The other idea I hope to see implemented someday is a game where you have 2 characters: One is the adventurer, the other is your guildsman/crafter. You can swap between them at any time. You can also set the crafter to a long task and come back later. Suikoden III is my main inspiration, where there were 3 main characters but 1 was terrible at combat and his story was all based around building up a castle and eventually it would help the other characters."
truegaming,3cgw7m,erikb85,2,Thu Jul 9 08:56:19 2015 UTC,"I am convinced that an MMO cant really have a great crafting system without first having an economy that is truly 100% player-driven. And this is hard to do without breaking a lot of the MMO-mold.  I think ""Crowfall"" will have a shot at it though. That's the next MMO i will have a go at, although its not even close to alpha testing yet and surely at least 2 yeasr away from release.  As i understand it, Crowfall will be braking the mentioned MMO-mold in a number of ways that affect the economic prerequisites:   Limited PvE grind for item-drops and resources. The bulk of materials are gained from controlling mines/logging camps/etc, in a PvP/ Guild-v-Guild environment. A tension regarding how and when to use materials. Acquired materials can presumably be used to forge new equipment, repair equipment(!) as well as create/repair fortifications and other infrastructure. Seasonal design for the PvP /guild v Guild strife for materials. There can be no true stalemate or endless grinding when the materials players strife over only exist in worlds of seasonal design, where the world itself - the monsters within it and the materials and other resources within it - becomes increasingly grim as the season closes to a finish - a finish where the players/guilds/factions that are in command, will reap rewards that carry over to the non-seasonal play, and eventually to additional seasonal play in new worlds.   ... The developer of crowfall havnt really elaborated at all on craftig yet. but i think the frames, the game-systems and the world/s they are putting together, sets the stage for it nicely -- with materials and other resources being truly scarce, the choices of what to craft or repair will matter a lot. Additionally, any specific importance of who is doing the crafting - any nuances in the quality, or conditional traits of the equipment, will be highly valued!"
truegaming,3cgw7m,Slevin_Kedavra,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:31:01 2015 UTC,"The combat system needs to be very deep. If there is one ultimate weapon that you can use and beat the game with just it, then once people acquire it, there is no further need to engage with the crafting system.  Alternatively, if the combat system is deep and requires players to get many weapons that differ not in just stats (strong vs ice, good armor pen) but in ways of using them (swords vs polearms vs hammers, etc), then players will need a diverse arsenal of weapons for their characters.  An evolving metagame also adds to this.  Say you have an awesome fireaxe for a specific build thats popular, but the metagame shifts to thunderspears.  Now the crafters have a huge demand to fill.  Metagames should always be shifting, so you'll always have new weapons in vogue that need to be crafted.  Have special crafting locations in your world. So now the metagame requires thunderspears.  How do you make your spear thundery?  You could add a thundergem to it anytime you like.  Or you can take it to the forbidden sky alter, perform a ritual, summon a thunder demon and then bathe the spear in its blood or something.  Stuff like that is a quest you give yourself, rather than an NPC telling you to do it.  Those were always my favorite things to do.  Have certain times/events where crafting the best stuff can be done. In the anime Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood (spoilers) the bad guy had to essentially create a nation in the shape of a transmutation circle.  This involved building cities and roads in very specific places, performing ritualistic genocide at key locations, then waiting until a solar eclipse to use it.    Imagine a crafting system like that in an MMO with player owned housing.  Guilds would have to come together and configure their territory in such a way as to facilitate specific crafting.  Maybe obscure the mechanism to encourage experimentation of building placement.  Require rituals to be done before hand, and in a certain order.  Say you're trying to make the best possible sword.  You need to perform rituals A, B, and C at specific times and places, but at the same time, you may need to prevent other guilds from performing a ritual D, or you have to start over.  This would drive inter-guild conflicts and make the super high end equipment very difficult and very rewarding to make."

For example FFXI had +1 and +2 crafting bonus that were random and rare. There could be a +3 that you could turn in for a recipe for some epic weapon that almost nobody else in game would have. And this could happen at different levels of crafting and if you miss your chance, you miss it and so there doesn't become an overload of them. Also it could be used for different levels of armor.

truegaming,3cgw7m,maracle6,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:12:27 2015 UTC,"If you want to talk history and evolution, this discussion reminds me of what existed in the text adventure (MUD) days... at that time, the MUDs that I was playing did have some in-game currency.  There was no auction house, but you could spend it on things that other people had built.    One of the users on our server had built a jukebox and loaded it up with lyrics from hundreds of songs.  You gave it a virtual coin and then over the course of the next few minutes it would spam the room with lyrics from the song you picked.  It ended up being quite popular.  Another player had coded up a chatterbot parrot.  You could have a decent conversation with the thing, but of course the parrot's ultimate goal was to insult you.  These items may have been created in userland, but they could live on in the server even while the owner was offline.  So you essentially had players creating many of the NPCs of the game, and people had their own small store fronts of sorts.  Crafting back then was limited only by the time and imagination of the users who wrote the scripts to control these virtual creations.  You could make almost anything that you could dream up.  Of course being text-based you had to imagine what it looked like (aided by the detailed descriptions that the creators had supplied) but sometimes I think our imaginations are better than graphical ""reality"" anyway.  Sorry I don't have any good answers for the questions you pose, and I think they are good.  Many of these issues become a lot easier to solve if you remove the graphical element and let people describe in words what they have created - but that isn't where we are.  Cheers. :)"

Conversely, with a game like Disgaea, which is a game that doesn't even take itself seriously, I can come up with names that I don't take seriously. I'm creating a Mothman to be my 'runner' in the item world. I'll just call it Runner. I'm making a dragon? Charizard it is. I'm making an Armour knight which often has it's face slightly covered and will likely be using a sword? Auron (cf FFX). Just anything that is a little fun for me.

But I apparently got too emotionally invested in one of my characters.    I don't intentionally make up back stories for characters, but I had 1 soldier remaining from my original soldiers.  All the others had died.    She was a sniper, and she was amazing.  It got to the point where I'd have this internal debate about using her before missions.  She was getting too valuable to use.  Which I know is absurd, but it was true.  And on the ""story in my head"" level, she was the last of the crew that had been around when the earth had not been at war with aliens.  So I guess she represented the last of the generation that knew what peace was like.  That had not grown up in a world torn apart by war.  If anyone had done her duty and paid her fair share, it was this sniper.  Surely she should be allowed to retire.  So I made a deal with myself.  One last mission.  Then she could retire.  I think you see where this is going.  I spawned into the fight, and there were aliens on 2 sides of us, immediately within firing range.  I moved everyone into cover.    The aliens immediately began firing.  Despite the fact that she was at the back of my group, the aliens started firing only at the sniper.    I moved her back as far as the game would let me go.  She was behind cover on 2 sides.  She couldn't even see the enemies from her position (and considering that she had enhanced vision distance, that's pretty far back).  I had another soldier standing in the open right next to the sniper just to heal her.    And the aliens continued to fire only at the sniper.  Two shots came from so far away that none of my soldiers could see the alien that fired them.  They traveled through 2 of my soldiers ... and hit the sniper.  They were both critical hits.    She was dead.    I was so pissed off, I turned off the game.  I haven't played it since.    It was bizarre.  I loved that game.  I recommend it highly to other people.  If anything, my emotional involvement in one small collection of pixels is a testament to how great that game is.  But it felt so cheap and unfair that I'm not sure I'll ever finish it."

In Enemy Within, there is a mission which starts off relatively normal, but escalates into all kinds of bullshit. (Newfoundland, for anyone who remembers). By this mission I still had almost my entire squad from the start of the game still alive. I'd been playing on Iron Man, so every decision was so meticulous that I even started to have dreams which made every one of my movements so thought out... Anyway, back to the story:  This was a run-through that I hadn't named them myself, and I just had an initial, rag-tag group of soldiers who eventually (in my head story) had become best of friends over the curse of fighting countless battles with one another. They had also become expert fighters. Especially CHANG, my heavy who was naturally a tank. I lost every single member of my original crew who on that mission, bar my sniper who had been injured in the battle beforehand. Only 2 people survived, who were both relatively new people I'd recruited to make up for the injured.   My Sniper, Diaz, would always be the one to remember their sacrifice. She took me all the way through to the end of the game, almost never missing a shot after that mission. I still sometimes shed a tear for those lost in the battle of Newfoundland."

I used joke names or real people when I was a kid, but these days it would annoy me.  I may reuse some names where appropriate, but often come up with new ones.

truegaming,3ceys3,Vhaine,8,Tue Jul 7 16:36:01 2015 UTC,"This seems to overall be a rather rare appraoch   Hardly, you're just young or not remembering things. Back in the day, RPGs that involved constructing a unique-but-interchangeably-meaningless party were, by far, the dominant force. The reasons for that are simple: It's easier to make a game that way, requiring less system requirements and the idea was based out of pen&paper RPGs. Creating your own narrative was the accepted plan for the most part. Examples? Gold Box games. The original Final Fantasy. Dragon Quest 3. The list goes on and on as there are TONS of dungeoncrawler games out there (basically what Legend of Grimrock draws all of its inspiration from). The games with player character-specific narratives were rare. Things like Final Fantasy 2 (the actual Famicom/NES FF2, not the renamed FF4 in the US) were a novelty.  Now that that's covered...     Still, when put into a position where you have to create an entire party, what is usually your appraoch?    In mechanical terms, I tend to go for game-winning compositions on my first playthroughs. On later attempts, I will branch out and fuck around with weird plans (i.e., in the original Final Fantasy...instead of Warrior/Monk/White Mage/Black Mage, you might do WM/WM/WM/WM or Monk/Monk/WM/WM or Red Mage/Red Mage/Red Mage/Red Mage).   Do you accept the defaults for names and looks that the game suggests?   Nah, I make everybody unique. I have some ""characters"" developed in mind for these exact purposes though. I'll modify them to fit the needs but it's a fairly long list and I'll usually have SOMEBODY I can use out of it for a given situation. So amusingly enough, across games, my characters' names, appearances, and even characteristics carry across rather consistently. I always have a given ""tank"" in mind, a ""bruiser"", a ""support"" guy, a ""wizard"", etc.   Do you fashion the companions after real life people or fictional characters or personal inventions?   I don't use direct recreations of real life people. The closest I ever come to that is using them as inspiration for personality traits. There have been some...quirky individuals in my life and they have proven to be almost limitless fonts of ideas to draw from. (One of my personal methods for developing a character for my writing is to pick a handful of people I know and write down my observations of them, then draw from that list to make a character. I include myself in that list but I make a point only draw from a person every once in awhile to keep things from getting...stale.) The same idea can be said of fictional characters that others have made. I don't make copies intentionally. That feels like cheating unless I'm going for something really specific (I made a band of SlayerS characters for a joke playthrough of NWN once--which is coming full circle as the characters of SlayerS are based off of min-maxed characters from the author's DnD sessions). And as I already mentioned, I usually draw from my mental and written list of characters I've developed in the past.   Do you go for joke names?   Only in situations that demand it. In things like XCOM, you simply cannot allow yourself to get super attached to someone. And if you make a particularly embarrassing name that you would never want someone to see, naturally that dude will be your invincible, indestructible psychic harbinger of destruction that can win a 1v20 without missing a shot or taking a single hit. It's the best way to guarantee success!   Do you use the same names/characters across multiple games or do you always make up new ones?   Covered.   Do you maybe intentionally try to recreate characters and party from pen and paper RPG sessions?   They go hand-in-hand.   And whatever strategy you follow, do you think that that is a widespread approach or more a minority one?   Based on what I've seen and experienced, it's pretty common for people to have a ""given"" character or characters that they tend to fall back on. I'd be skeptical that most have a list as long as my own, however."
truegaming,3ceys3,syriquez,6,Tue Jul 7 17:44:26 2015 UTC,"Joke names are a favorite.  Even ""runs on rails"" games with plot-driven mains and such sometime offer you the chance to alter names (especially true of some older jRPGs without voice acting).  Classic choices include naming all characters the same thing (in games that allow it), naming characters after a major boss in the game, naming characters after all the game's bosses, using stupid Internet memes to name characters, or giving characters absurdly plain/boring names (Generic is a good name.  So are Nihil and Niemand).    For looks, fashioning the ugliest possible avatar is usually the way to go, especially if you have a social/charisma-based character that is really persuasive.  Other fun alternatives include minimizing height/weight on a two-handed melee-oriented character.  Try making an elf character (preferably female; they're a bit smaller) in Dragon Age: Origins, and then put them in heavy plate armor with a 2h blunt weapon.  Watch the spindly little girl take on creatures 2-3 times her size! Extra amusement if you've got Indomitable running."

truegaming,3ceys3,wonderloss,6,Tue Jul 7 12:57:39 2015 UTC,"In the Might and Magic series you created your own party from scratch as well.    I generally go with default names and looks because names are generally irrelevant if they're player made and looks get covered by armor typically.  That and I would probably spend more time trying to create the perfect look and name than actually playing the game.  If I do name the characters, it would generally be after friends and family.  Sometimes I try to create a balanced party and other times I'll go for shenanigans.  In a party full of wizards, can they gun down the boss before it reaches them?"
truegaming,3ceys3,antigravcorgi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:07:35 2015 UTC,"In games like that, I often went with names like Fighter, Wizard, Rogue, etc. Made it easy to remember who was who in combat."

Anything with numbers or real-world references break immersion too much, but if it's something that a clever person in the fictional world might actually use as a nickname - and it's funny enough to justify breaking the gravity of the character's role - then I give it a pass.

To some extent, having minimally ""cheeky"" names even helps with immersion, because that's the kind of nickname I'd go for if I lived in that world. Real people aren't all super serious all the time, and buddies will make nicknames for each other. It's all in keeping with building up my character as an extension of my personality into another realm - not trying to make jokes or win cleverness points"

Knight has many tanky abilities that force enemies to attack it and reduce damage taken, Bard has lots of AoE heals and AoE debuffs, Rogue with the right talents does a shit ton of single target damage with great mana management, Mage's Meteor spell does significant damage to all enemies but drains a ton of mana, and finally, Druid can restore mana to the mage and has a single target HOT that is great to cast on the Knight.

I don't think I have a uniform approach, and it varies a lot based on my familiarity with the game, style, franchise, etc.  For instance, I went with the default party in Legend of Grimrock because I didn't know anything.  On the other hand, in something like BG or Pillars of Eternity, I'll decide what class I want my main character to be, and then form the party around that.  I tend to be more serious and avoid joke names, though I do goof around in something like Pokemon.  I don't shoot for recreating characters from real life or fiction."

Depending on my level of personal investment my answer varies greatly.  I do aim for synergy when possible. If character quality is highly customizable I tend to go for what I think will be the most successful: A tank, several varieties of damage, and a healer.   If the characters are more self-sufficient I tend to develop ""long journey"" characters that can survive until bags are full. If not, I throw an additional healer in.  The same is true for naming. If I walk away and come back the interface and/or design of the game is a huge factor. Some games allow me right into the action on start up and others make me look at the situation first.  In a game where I have less instant ability to know who does what, I give them instrumental names: Tank1, Tank2, Heal1, Range1, etc.  When I play games where roles and reliability are more obvious I have a lot of fun with names.  And usually there is a lightning/fire ranged class that automatically gets my ""cross-platform"" character handle: Funder."

truegaming,3ceys3,TSED,2,Tue Jul 7 13:45:31 2015 UTC,One FF7 play through I named all the characters after friends and loved ones (tried to match my friends into their respective archetype) it was quite possibly one of the most emotionally invested games I played. I was devastated when I lost Aerith (named after my recent ex GF at the time) best part about that is this was my third playthrough and knew exactly how it would end.
truegaming,3ceys3,Ravek,2,Tue Jul 7 13:50:40 2015 UTC,"On a related note to this topic, I found myself quite a dilemma playing Pillars of Eternity recently. I restarted a few times to see which class I liked best, then quickly recruited enough adventurers to fill all the spots in my team (while only having one ""named"" npc with me, Aloth). Then, as my adventures went on and I met new named npc (Kana Rua, Durance, Sagani, then realizing I missed Eder, and so on) I had to let go of my previous companions one by one. I still wanted them in my party, but I also liked the new people I was meeting (well maybe not durance) and they were clearly meant to join me so leaving them on the wayside felt wasteful. Ultimately what was initially a group with four custom companions (five if you include the PC) ended up being me, my rogue character (aptly named Rogue Chick) and 4 ""real"" companions."
truegaming,3ceys3,theswerto,2,Tue Jul 7 14:46:49 2015 UTC,"I love and crave full-party games.   Do you accept the defaults for names and looks that the game suggests?   Haha, nope.   Do you fashion the companions after real life people or fictional characters or personal inventions?   Not even once.   Do you go for joke names?   Occasionally, but I tend to just come up with names on the spot.   Do you use the same names/characters across multiple games or do you always make up new ones?   If I particularly like a name, I might reuse it.  It all comes down to what I feel like naming that character when I get to the 'name' section.   Do you maybe intentionally try to recreate characters and party from pen and paper RPG sessions?   No.  What I do try to do is break the game hilariously.  For example, I noticed in PoE that chanter chants stack.  I quickly threw together a party of all chanters and went down a trip in Caed Nua despite only having just gotten to Defiance Bay (and this was my first playthrough).  I got all the way to floor 13 and would have kept going, except I was forced to stop by a literal language barrier.  (On the other hand, I definitely wouldn't've been able to deal with the master below with the party).  Icewind Dale with 4 bards, 1 fighter/mage, and 1 rng/clr = lolk.  Fighter/mage had so many buffs and the bards provided so much CC support that I could rip through entire dungeons before medium term buffs started wearing off.  The extra effect songs that bards got in IWD were really really nice, though I admit it took a little bit of time to get that party rolling.  Might & Magic 7: monk/monk/monk/sorcerer.  Really brutal start, but the pay off is INCREDIBLE.  Highest dps character x3, each focus on a single school of self magic, and sorcerer does what sorcerer do.  Go darkside for the higher disarm trap access, if you care.  NWN2: SoZ: ever seen a full party of codzillas go on a rampage?  It's hilarious.    I'm sure you get the picture."
truegaming,3ceys3,ArtKorvalay,2,Tue Jul 7 15:05:35 2015 UTC,"Etrian Odyssey does this. It's a double edged sword: it's a huge barrier of entry, especially since it's immediately at the start of the game so you haven't experienced even a single second of gameplay nor do you understand the mechanics of the game. On the other hand it's very satisfying once you do understand what you'd want out of a party."
truegaming,3ceys3,Mognet_T,2,Tue Jul 7 15:07:26 2015 UTC,"Damage soaker, support, two damage oriented characters who fill different damage roles.   That's pretty bare bones RPG stuff you learn really quickly when building a party. Sure you can do other things, but that is the most simple way to do things.  Supporters can be healers, buffers, debuffers.  Damage soakers can be tanks who are super armored or absorb damage or avoid it while being the primary focus of enemies if this is possible.  Damage oriented characters can be warriors, rogues, mages, whatever and you want to have different sources of damage so if you fight a group of enemies that is immune to one source of damage you aren't SoL."
truegaming,3ceys3,Osmodius,2,Tue Jul 7 15:16:32 2015 UTC,"Creating your entire party is growing more rare I think because it requires a higher level of commitment to the game.  You can wing it, but if you want to actually do well in the game you'll probably research the game and what abilities you'll need as opposed to abilities that are just novelty.  People playing these sorts of games I figure are predisposed to be obsessive about it, min-maxers trying to get the most bang for your buck.  So then you get nice niche community discussions about what your best options are.    I generally go for a fairly cookie cutter build - half the party will be utility/support whereas the other half will be the badass fighters with minimal utility.  This tends to work well enough, but as a cookie cutter build I figure it's rather common and bland.  It would definitely be more exciting to see if you could beat the entire game as a team of fighters with no utility, or full utility team with very little combat prowess."
truegaming,3ceys3,makesyoufeeldirty,2,Tue Jul 7 15:42:40 2015 UTC,"I break it down into themes, personally. In some games, I name my characters after gods. Either sticking to one pantheon, or pulling from many. The tanks/fighters named after Ares/Minerva, Thieves are likely to be Loki. I might also use emotions as names. A Barbarian named Rage, a Thief named Swift. I might make a Dwarf tank and name him Stout. Not the most creative, but it makes my characters feel blunt and precise.  I have specific names from my own D&D character list that I often use as a theme: Male Fighter, LG Female, Female Caster, Male Caster, height-challenged character, and any-gendered Thief all have base character names/archetypes I have been kicking around on paper and digitally for 14 years. I also have a pool of fantasy names for Orcs/Elves/Undead that I often use."
truegaming,3ceys3,darkjedidave,2,Tue Jul 7 15:50:45 2015 UTC,"I generally go for ""random"" names, Shuliva, Kliara, Torvak, Corruna. Mixing bits of whatever that sound decent. Smaller names for my big smash mans at the front, slightly fancier names for the sneakstabs and the magicwizzles.    The way my characters look, I tend to try and make it a bit related to their role, my big mans at the front, the mans for smashing, I make big, burly, angry looking, not too complex. My mages are usually slender and weak looking, my rogustabstabs are usually shady as fuck, you know the look I mean. Priests, paladins and not so tanky fighters get the Generic Good Guy look, good looking, buff etc. I'm not all that creative.   If there's an obvious main character, they're usually black with white or pink/purple hair (if it looks decent in that particular game) with white or purple/pink eyes (depending, again, on what works in the game's visuals). Usually on the shorter side for hair, usually a female unless females look silly in the game or role I want to play (males sometimes have much bulkier frames that, imo, look better in plate armour, whereas the women are stuck with stick figures instead of bodies. depends on the game, obviously).  If that doesn't pan out, I opt for some ridiculously gaunt looking person, skinny and empty inside."
truegaming,3ceys3,bloodstainer,2,Tue Jul 7 16:09:14 2015 UTC,"When creating a party my fist step is to think what do I need.   I need at least 2 ranged, 1 magic, a tank, and a guy with a sword.

truegaming,3ceys3,Crotonine,2,Tue Jul 7 16:27:17 2015 UTC,"My strategy (on 4 player parties) is the main character remains balanced, I have one tank for mass damage, and two healers (one of them focused on attack magic, but could heal if needed)."

Looks is a different matter and it totally depends on the game, BioWare is clearly designed in a way that they want you to create your own characters except for perhaps the later versions of ME as well as DA2. But otherwise, it depands, I usually want my cast to look diverse, give me powerful and bulky Women as Warrior Tanks and old withered hags as healers and perhaps a tattooed crazed old man as a tinkerer or alchemist.  I usually take inspiration from fantasy character as well as trying to write them as uniquely as possible.  The Only time I ever go for joke names are in Pokémon and games which are multiplayer-based. And generally only a certain character or two.  I'm sad to admit that I do. I named my first Character in a game ever Bloodstainer and I've kept doing so in MMOs etc, but since its more of a title or nickname, I generally keep it out of serious RPGs which generally are more fitting with actual names. But for some reason the name Alyssa has kept reappearing in a lot of games since the early 2000s.  I never try to recreate characters, I just tend to draw inspiration when it comes to perhaps, background and motives but I generally try to mix them up, and I'm also a fan of really tragic and terribly scarred and damaged characters."

truegaming,3ceys3,Codiak,2,Tue Jul 7 17:34:11 2015 UTC,"To be honest, in such games I usually make a party, scrap it, make another, scrap it, spend a few hours reading up about it, and then maybe the next day make my ideal party. Joke names are fantasy names as far as I'm concerned, I prefer something amusing over something tryhard RPish. Sometimes I like to make characters based in others from different media or genres, don't usually try to recreate other fantasy characters from RPGs, its already hard enough to differentiate many fantasy world's and mechanics. Goku in Pillars of Eternity was my favourite character I've ever played and actually had a nearly perfect model and character race/class to boot!"

No thanks, I have generics who can insta-cast Calculate Frog and pretty much disable the entire enemy team permanently in 1 or 2 rounds.  The game was only hard if you rushed through the storyline or tried to prioritize damage. All you had to do was make sure you can deliver the most debilitating debuffs, that was it. It doesn't matter that the enemy knight can two-shot Ramza if I can speedbreak/paralyze/sleep him in round 1 so that his next turn only comes up 20 turns later, and you just know those extra turns will be spent fucking him over even worse.

No joke names, I'm not 5 and think ""Fucker"" is funny anymore.  I try to keep a small enough pool to remember names.

I mostly play JRPGs, and try to stick with easier to remember ""Japanese"" names, or cool things in different languages (Rein being ""Pure"" in German, based off Rein Weissritter from Super Robot Wars OG, meaning Pure White Knight). Izayoi is my go-to Ninja/Samurai name.  So I try to relate names to classes, for example in Etrian Odyssey 3, my ninja would be Izayoi, my knight/fighter/paladin would be Rein, etc. Typically I name my MC Alt or Rein if there is no default/canon."

Whatever I feel like at the time.  I don't accept the default looks either, mostly because I don't need to -- I play the Avernum series, and there aren't that many different looks to choose from, so I'll just go for whatever I think will be the least annoying to me 40 hours in.  As for everything else...  I don't like disadvantages.  So I generally make it so that my party has at least one of everything useful, enough initial access to spells, that sort of thing.  I'd imagine most people do the same.  It's not very creative."
truegaming,3ceys3,MyPunsSuck,2,Tue Jul 7 23:57:59 2015 UTC,"In some games I've named characters after people that I know. In most fantasy themed games, characters are fashioned after best friends, colleagues and/or favorite fictional characters from tv or books.   In games  where there's permadeath of characters, like Xcom, I'd name a few characters after people I don't really like, so if they happen to die, I'd at least be amused. (I found this also seem to help me dislike them less. )  I never use joke names, and I tend to alter the name a little so it fits the setting of the game."

Since your questions are basically variants on the same ""how do you source characters"" I'll just reply to them all in one go. I have my own history of characters which I reuse, for example if a game has elemental type mages I have several character names who can be used for that. So, yeah, I already have a stable of established characters who I can just recreate and slot into a new game. I have no need to copy names from elsewhere (""I know, I'll call my mage Gandalf, and my fighter can be Conan""), nor do I bother with joke names (no joke remains funny a couple of minutes in, nevermind that we play RPGs for hours). For the same reasons I don't use friends/family names either (why name my cleric after my friend, when I already have a well-developed cleric character, not to mention the jarring mental imagine of trying to imagine my friend in a game).  I don't think this is a minority approach, I'm pretty sure most people who play RPGs already have ""favourite"" characters in mind (e.g. someone who always creates a male wizard specced for offensive magic, with a specific name). How people pick names though, this one is where people are more likely to choose from existing literature. Source: just see names in MMOs, you'll see a shit ton of characters with names from other games and other media, with only a tiny handful of actual thought-up original names."

truegaming,3ceys3,yumcake,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:41:09 2015 UTC,"It largely depends on the game itself. If it's a game that has a story I care to be immersed in, I'll take the party creation seriously. I'll typically accept default names or generated names in this scenario because, often, coming up with lore-appropriate names makes me feel like I'm outlining a fan-fiction. I do tend to fashion companions after real life people regardless.   I have a real soft-spot for joke names. Especially when NPCs will say them in conversation. I typically like to pick something that seems like a cheesy, modernized distillation of the character. So, like a big, buff warrior I'd name something like ""Hunk"", and a skinny mage type I'd name something like ""Nerd"". This gives games a distinct sophomoric feel that, juxtaposed with the setting, often makes for funny dialogue.   As an aside, I'm currently playing Animal Crossing: New Leaf, and I've named my character ""Human"", with the quotes, so it lends this sort of demeaning, anti-human tone to all the conversations. Stuff like that. I don't just pick silly, insulting names like ""Buttface"" or something like that. I try to pick something that will make me laugh as a part of a whole statement from an NPC, not just from reading the name itself.  I do often use the same names across multiple games. Otto and Wickle are my most commonly used names.   I never played P&P, so no. But I have modeled party members after characters from other games in the past.   In MMOs, I often come up with name series. So, like, my online handle is dinoFUNK. My main will be named that but if I have, say, a tank as an alt I might name it aggroFUNK or dinoHUNK."

If it's a western-style RPG , the name doesn't mean much since renamable characters are often just blank slates. If it's a JRPG they've already supplied a lot of personality to the character you're renaming.  2) Nah, I don't like to blend the fiction.   3) Nope, I get tired of the joke names or joke costumes. I'd rather cooperate with the game's attempts to maintain it's immersion.  4) Used to keep the name ""Rhad"" which met the 4-letter maximum in FF1 (US numbering). Why? Because it's a rad name! (I was young, give me a break). Carried it for awhile, and then stopped.  5) Same deal personality-wise, I used to try to recreate them, but then discarded that approach later as customization grew more important. I found more satisfaction from min/maxing a build, and then imagining a fresh personality developing on top of that min/maxed build, as opposed to stridently sticking to a carryover build from a different game's rules just to bring in some nostalgia from another game."

I don't accept the default look or names - asa  matter of fact, I don't like playing games where I have to play the studio's character (Witcher, for example).

What I imagine is that there is a great deal of variety.  As for optimization strategies when playing games that require full groups, I have a minor amount of this. Basically, I think about front-line vs. back-line and try to get enough tanks to cover people in the back.

truegaming,3cfnw0,CutterJohn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:14:41 2015 UTC,"The thing is that realism gives plausible constraints and complications, and those are what make interesting gameplay.  Nobody ever says CoD is realistic, but it gets the basics of what its portraying at least in the ballpark. Guns behave similarly to their real life counterparts, run speeds are similar to real life, magazines have to be reloaded, if you jump, you fall back down, and if you fall too far, you get hurt. Yeah, it simplifies and ignores plenty, but it does so on top of the basics that it doesn't ignore.   Frankly, CoD is a far better sim than most every space shooter out there. Space games almost uniformly discard everything about the environment and technology which could be considered annoying or difficult, and then, worst of all, don't replace it with anything. They end up with utterly simplistic ships, whose controls boil down to turn and thrust, and utterly simplistic weapons, which are point and pull the trigger. Even simple flight games are more complex. And unfortunately for space games, on the local scale, the environment is about as simple as you could possibly get, outside of a 'salt flats' map for an FPS.   For the sake of realism is a good excuse, because its a reason to add limitations to the game that make things interesting, without those limitations being bizarre/arbitrary."

Should they be though? Games are about having fun and the most fun and popular games are most often about wish-fulfillment (being a badass soldier, a rockstar, a racecar driver, a hero who saves the day, etc.) Isn't there a part of any space sim player that wants to be Malcolm Reynolds, Han Solo, or Boba Fett? Isn't that an integral part of the experience, and, if not, shouldn't it be?   On the other side of things space sims should attempt to be as difficult as they can get away with without being unfair, to maximize the satisfaction of accomplishment.    Huh? You think that space sims are hard? Do you mean that they should be a challenge to configure the controls to work well with a gamepad or mouse/keyboard? Most of them are smart enough to realize that people who don't have a flightstick aren't flight-sim fans and thus have controls made for them. The only exceptions are the X games and Elite: Dangerous. Privateer, Wing Commander, Freelancer, and Starpoint Gemini 2 all control great even if are using mouse/keyboard. They have controls setup to play well with whichever control scheme you choose AND voiced tutorials that notice which you are using and change accordingly. Maybe I just don't understand what you are talking about: which games do you think are challenging and which do you think aren't challenging and what makes them more (or less) of a challenge?  As for your last point, we totally agree that games should be designed with fun in mind, not realism. The only time you should design for realism is if doing so would make the game more fun; thus, once again, fun is more important.  :)"
truegaming,3cfnw0,StarTrekMike,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:45:49 2015 UTC,"I think perhaps you are forgetting that for some people, realism IS fun.  I can use myself as an example.  I'm a military history buff, particularly with WWI and II.  If I play a game set in this era and the weaponry is all off, that pulls me completely out of the theme.  If I can shoot an enemy in the head and they aren't dead, if it takes more than a couple chest shots to put an enemy on the ground, I'm not interested.  Because for me, that kind of environment is compelling, interesting.... fun.   Now, this isn't to say I can't play CoD (although in this case I don't actually like CoD very much, but similarly arcadey games do me fine), but my point is that if you have a particular itch to scratch, scratching it is going to be fun, even if most other people don't have that same itch (much as I'm sure most shooter fans would grow annoyed at a game where they died almost every time they got shot).    So in saying that games should be designed for fun rather than realism, I feel you're missing the mark considerably.  The two are not antithetical.  They are not necessarily opposed.  There is no slider with ""fun"" at one end and ""realism"" at the other.  Realism is fun for certain people, and not for others, and space sim games cater to those who fall in the former category in this particular genre.    I mean, there's also the fact that you're asking ""should fantasy be different from simulation?""  Just looking at that question screams ""yes"".  Fantasy is, by definition, not realistic.  Realism is, by definition, not fantastical.  That's just the way it is. :P"

truegaming,3cfnw0,notTheComment,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:37:31 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think they should be designed to be fun. For flight-simulator fans (a really niche market, but a valid one), that means strict realism and paying attention to what other game designs would eliminate as boring minutia. But that's still designing for fun; it's just designing what is fun for this market.  Lots of genres can be married into hybrids, but in this instance, I think it's a hard-sell. Clearly, a flight simulator fan is going to like Elite: Dangerous much more than they would like Wing Commander, Privateer, or Freelancer - whereas I like all 3 of these classic space sims more than Elite: Dangerous (though I like them all and the others are too old to really be enjoyable to play anymore). Still, I got more joy out of them when they were new than I get out of E:D now. My guess is that when there is a modern alternative to E:D, people like me who fantasize not about the minutia of a flight-sim in space, but about being a space pirate or bounty hunter or smuggler, etc. will move to the game that is aimed more at us while flight-sim fans will stick with E:D.  That is, unless E:D changes up it's design to aim at a broader market. It wouldn't be hard for them to create a fast auto-landing option for a nominal fee that just warps the player to the landing pad for 100 credits or whatever so that people who don't find the minutia of landing a spaceship interesting can skip it. They could also look at any of the ""how to make keyboard/mouse or gamepad controls work well"" tutorials for the game and change up the default controls to those configurations so that non-flight-stick users don't have to deal with wacky controls as their first impression of the game. These changes wouldn't effect flight-sim guys because they are already using flightsticks and they could still land their ships manually (or not if they are bored with it as it really is very easy, highly repetitive, and time-consuming.) Or they could not do these things, that's fine too. Maybe Elite will be the new X series and more power to those guys. My point is that I agree that the design goals are so different for these types of gamers that even though both types of games share the same genre name, they have very different fantasies and thus very different design goals. . .  to design for both really means making some of your features optional because they will be polarizing with one group liking the feature and the other group disliking it. The alternative is to treat this like racing games: you have simulation racers like Forza and Gran Turismo and ""arcade"" racers like Burnout and Split Second (and most of the Need for Speed titles, though they confused their branding in the middle by making a simulation racer with the NFS title). Maybe we should have ""arcade"" spacers like Wing Commander, Freelancer, and Privateer, and simulation spacers like X and Elite: Dangerous?"

One of the games I'm the most hopeful for is a game called Pulsar: Lost Colony. It comes the closest to the star trek captain kind of gameplay you are looking for, and has a lot of promise for the han-solo smuggler kind of gameplay. Only issue is it's being developed by a 2 man team, so progress is pretty slow, and it's fairly content bare atm. Also, you really need a group of 3-5 friends to experience it at it's best. (if you do decide t get it, shoot me a PM, I'll crew with you!).    As for the anime spaceship pilot, you could check out Strike suit zero, which is a space dogfighting game where your ship can turn into a space mech, or Steredenn, which is a side scrolling bullet hell rougelike, which has a bunch of interesting weapons you can find, such as a giant anime laser, or a weapon that turns your ship into a giant drill."

However, I was not familiar with Pulsar, which is a good example of how two developers are making their own space sim to serve space adventure fantasies that aren't served by current or upcoming space sims, so it does have information that is applicable to the topic.

Personally, my space adventure fantasies include both high tech worlds and low-tech ones. . .  or, rather, more like high tech colonies in sparsely populated newly discovered worlds. . .  like Tatooine, they had a high level of technology, but it was still a sparsely populated dessert world. Are you just wanting more variety or do you want deserted worlds? Either way, you should check out No Man's Sky if you want sparse worlds (though there does seem to be a faction of robot enemies that are on every world or that somehow portal there if they detect you messing about on them. They haven't been clear about this as it is obviously a story-element).  As a side note, I find your example of Destiny strange because every world on it is a ruin, and also, being in our solar system, isn't going to have native life (well, unless you count the Hive living beneath the moon's surface)."
truegaming,3cfnw0,JudgeJay,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:06:11 2015 UTC,"To rephrase, current space sims are not fulfilling my fantasies and I agree with your first two as fantasies I would like to see fulfilled.  I added in a couple of games with space themes rather than space gameplay, as an example of 'space' games that don't do what I want.  Destiny for me was a game that had a space  setting, but ended up as FPSRPG game.    I think that, more than anything else, I want the focus to be of things actually in space rather than set on different space like planets.  There have already been many games that punt you between different planets, with the space portion glossed over or missing; I'd take dialogue/still images to convey the design/theme/story of the planet you go to rather than spending resources on small enclosed areas.  Off the top of my head, I've enjoyed the backstory/variety of Endless Space and the story of Homeworld, both games that are almost entirely set in space."

You don't run out of content while you level; however, it's sort of like a 3D Sid Meier's: Pirates in regards to ship combat. You move your ship around so that they are in your firing arcs but you aren't tin their arcs, and use a bunch of crew (and captain) skills to gain the upper hand. Also, you can divert power to different shield banks, etc. As for an ""emotional adventure"", Cryptic has good writers but terrible production values: voice work is extremely rare, so you'll be reading text boxes for story (or more likely skipping past them because they're text boxes and not voice-over). They also have a fair amount of puzzle and story ""diplomatic"" missions. The ones I saw were just awful though. . .  one was about remembering information to find the lie, and another was talking to all the people in all the various places. What fun! But then any game is a mixed bag. It's F2P, so go try it for an hour like you would a demo.   (Also, I played this at launch and went back maybe once and I went back to a high level Admiral character so maybe they've started adding production value from low level up and I didn't see it).  Edit: I fired this up because you made me think about it and I haven't played in a few years. They've added Romulans as a playable faction and, so far (at level 8), a large amount of the story missions are voiced and have solid production value. It's actually quite good. :)"

truegaming,3cg8ik,yumcake,5,Tue Jul 7 17:52:07 2015 UTC,"The mere perception that free-to-play is more profitable than paid games seems to be enough to drive the majority of developers away from making more traditional games for the mobile market. Whether that would necessarily have been the case or if it was a self-actualizing idea is pretty much irrelevant at this point, because now we're stuck with the market as it is, and it's probably not changing any time soon.  There are already mobile games that are genuinely good without needing to qualify it with 'for a mobile game,' but it's too late for them to make any difference in the way people as a whole see mobile games. Monument Valley was fantastic and worked better as a mobile game than it would have as a PC title, Five Nights at Freddy's was incredibly popular, and Minecraft and Terraria were excellent ports, but none of them are going to push back the 'trend,' they'll likely always be seen as outliers no matter how many amazing games come out.  Personally, I found Fallout Shelter to be pretty appropriate to the setting. It felt like propaganda straight out of the pre-war, 50's optimism Vault-Tec that we've always seen obliquely in things like Vault Boy himself and all the doodles for perks/attributes/etc in the Pip-Boy. Accidents happen, but of course they're only minor setbacks; the vaults are all perfectly safe shelters after all, and this is like worst-case scenario training.  Something more like This War of Mine in the Fallout setting would have been awesome, too, but I think Bethesda did the right thing for a small game just meant to keep people hyped up for Fallout 4."
truegaming,3cg8ik,Intelligensaur,5,Tue Jul 7 19:06:57 2015 UTC,"Both of these studios seem to be suggesting that they don't have confidence in the mobile gaming market to welcome a substantial gaming experience   I have no idea how you reach this conclusion from This War of Mine. I read your post a couple times to make sure I didn't miss anything.  You suggest (accurately) that This War of Mine tackles meatier subject matter--or at the very least a more serious tone.  The fact that This War of Mine is coming to mobile at all indicates that the developer has confidence in the mobile market. With such a dire sounding thesis in your post one of the core games of your comparison is at odds with your conclusion.  This War of Mine is already at 'It's Good'. Putting it on mobile, assuming it's the same game as is on Win/OSx, won't change anything other than the input method. I would call This War of Mine a meaty game. There's a ton of replay value and a lot of depth in its systems. Though, I could see why some would perceive it as a simple title.  Personally, I think This War of Mine is the biggest accomplishment in politically driven/serious games to date. It is a good game, not a good 'serious' game. The device won't change that either unless they really screw up the controls.  As far as meatier games go--look up Ultimate General: Gettysburg or any of the titles by Shenandoah Studio. They doubled down on meaty games for mobile and were successful for it.  Oceanhorn is another great example.  This is an interesting discussion--don't let my vehement disagreement dissuade you. I've had this discussion at length with coworkers at my dev jobs when we were picking platforms to publish on.  Mobile appeals to a certain type of game/gamer, sure. It does not preclude other types of games making it to the platform. That's why it's popular for indies but we will probably never see Bethesda do something too large on it."
truegaming,3cg8ik,Wuzseen,3,Thu Jul 9 22:29:36 2015 UTC,"Regarding mobile games, I'll quote a book I enjoyed, Constellation Games by Leonard Richardson: ""Smart paper is going to destroy the whole tech industry, just like one-dollar apps destroyed software."" So I think yes, in a very real way the reward to effort ratio in mobile game development is a significant factor. Even if you make a great game at a price people will buy it, it's like a lottery to get it visible in a sea of mobile games unless you want to invest heavily in promoting it, which of course lowers the reward to effort ratio.  But, one I don't think many people consider, but personally, I also find 99% of touch interfaces to only be suitable to simple interactions. Tap, double tap, tap-hold, two-finger tap, swipe left/right/up/down... But it's nearly impossible to tell what potential interactions will do until you've done it, and some things you may do are irreversible and detrimental to your game. On top of this, you have a very limited display area with which to communicate information to a player.  Also there's been a trend for the last ten years or so of very sparse or nonexistent documentation even for complex PC games, to say nothing of mobile. I feel like a if a developer considered an interface for mobile that couldn't be explained in a three-panel illustration, they'd drop the idea entirely and stick to simple options in a simple interface.  As an aside, even on PC games, if you're lucky, there's a wiki explaining things, or if you're not, you're googling and scanning forums to find out important options and features. I code stuff for consumers, and I hate documenting things for a general audience as much as anybody, but at a certain point you have to recognize that not informing users about the things they can do with your game or other software is as real a ""bug"" as something that causes it to crash. How this seems to be increasingly acceptable is beyond me.  To summarize, I feel that the major limitations are potentially low reward for the time, effort and expense of development, and an inherent limitation of interaction on touch interfaces on small devices."
truegaming,3cg8ik,phordant,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:54:37 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting factor, that the the touch interface is often a limiting factor in accessing the kinds of gameplay we enjoy on consoles/PCs. I think most people would agree that they've noticed this for themselves. However, can you expand on why this is an inherent problem with the touch medium as opposed to this merely being a design challenge for which adequate solutions haven't yet been developed?   Like how analog controllers were vastly inferior for FPS play, and even today still has a clear technical disadvantage in relying on acceleration in relative stick position vs. the precision of discrete mouse movement, however design improvements in controller layout, thumbstick sensitivity/deadzone tuning, aiming-down-sights, movespeed changes in gameplay, auto-aim in ADS, and magnetic crosshairs have managed to make FPS experiences solid enough to become popular on consoles, despite the inherently limited interface.   You'd definitely want to know what a potential interaction would do before it's done, and some games tackle this by only taking actions upon touch-release, so you could drag item A over item B, and get a pop-up bubble explaining the result before you release item A over item B. I think the most concrete limitation of the interface is the ability to know what's happening directly under the area being touched, and the immediate area to the lower right (the area covered by the finger for right-hand dominant players, this would be the lower left for left-handed players). I don't there's been any neat solutions for this issue aside from some games awkwardly trying to superimpose a virtual controller at the bottom of the screen for players to use.   I think the low reward for the time is the biggest problem, since the high volume of crap on mobile stores is smothering the chances for truly solid games to gain the returns needed to justify the developer doing full-time development in such a risky boom-bust environment.   Perhaps heavier usage of kickstarter for mobile gaming is the answer here? It'll help offload some of the upfront risk to consumers to allow developers to only engage in making mobile games for which there is a guaranteed audience (as the audience itself would have to be in place for development to begin). The general masses of mobile users aren't necessarily gamers and might not appreciate a developer's vision for a meatier game, but kickstarter might help connect that developer to the mobile user gamers that do care. FTL being the biggest and best known example of a successful kickstarter project resulting in a solid mobile game."
truegaming,3cg8ik,phordant,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:02:47 2015 UTC,"can you expand on why this is an inherent problem with the touch medium as opposed to this merely being a design challenge for which adequate solutions haven't yet been developed?   To be more concise, I see it as a combination issue of a touch interface that must be simple/intuitive enough not to require more than the briefest of instruction, and a screen that's under six inches. The screen size can be overcome to a large degree by separate controls, such as Nintendo's 3DS. Were there more screen space, a developer could dedicate a part of that to on-screen touch controls - a virtual controller as you mentioned - and achieve the same benefits.  The touch blind spot you mention certainly limits what you can do. An interesting proposal I saw quite a while ago was to make the back side of a smartphone a capacitive touch area, and throw a cursor up to indicate where the back side finger was pointing.  The thing about touch controls that really drives me up a wall, and I feel limits a user's awareness of what they actually can do with the interface is something we've had in PC applications for at least 30 years - pop-up tooltips."

truegaming,3cg8ik,VicisSubsisto,3,Wed Jul 15 16:29:25 2015 UTC,"I'm mainly going to stick to your first question here:  The smartphone game market has never been, nor in my estimation will it ever be, a favorable platform for serious, complex, premium games. People tend to make the comparison between smartphone games and PC games, which is understandable, especially when you look at how powerful smartphones are compared to the PCs some classics ran on. However, there is a much more suitable analogue in practice:  Browser games.  Smartphone app stores are generally not conductive to low-level programming, given their wide variety of hardware configurations, which limits complexity and graphical capability. They don't support typical gaming HIDs, generally only allowing touch actions, just as browser games are limited to clicks and a limited range of keyboard functions. They are limited in size due to the small storage of phones.  When we look at the heyday of sites like Newgrounds, we see many parallels with the current mobile market - a mix of simple free games, of wildly varying quality, created by passionate amateurs with limited resources, corporate tie-ins slapped together to promote some other product, and simplified MMOs with limited player interaction and a dependence on IAP. Arguably, the only reason this last point was less common in Flash games than in the App Store/Market is that online payments used to be much more difficult, which prevented impulse buys. When Facebook launched its game platform functionality, with built-in social and IAP functionality, to the delight of elderly aunts around the world, the market grew even closer to the state of today's phone games.  I've been rambling here, but my point is: Smartphone games are inherently casual. No one ever sat down to Newgrounds or Kongregate for a 12-hour gaming marathon, and smartphone games are the same: quick distractions. There are plenty of excellent, in-depth, serious games on portable systems, but those portable systems are called 3DS and Playstation Vita."

If you have someone like Brian Fargo on a competing KS with just as good of a demo, where do you think the money is going to go (genre preferences aside)? Odds are, Fargo will win and the unknown will be pwned.  Insert whatever other renowned game designer you want, the effect will be about the same (unless it's Peter Molyneux).    Also, industry insiders can draw on a much richer talent pool when building their early team that will be responsible for the demo, artwork, etc. that will go into the KS project.  Indies have to do the work themselves (often with lamentable results) or have to offer hope and dreams to people willing to trade personal time for a shot at a startup with a sliver of a chance of success.  Keeping people like that on board through early failures can be very difficult, if not impossible.  Look at how many people were willing to stick with Molyneux through the Godus fiasco.

truegaming,3ceqao,retrotrinitygaming,33,Fri Jul 10 22:37:52 2015 UTC,"The Shenmue 3 debacle isn't something I have to describe, but it still upsets me how KS was being used only as publicity and only being used to show ""consumer interest,"" which they know we have. Sony isn't stupid, they know how popular Shenmue became as a cult classic, but a KS for the game was the best publicity stunt they could have pulled. They are funding the game, no doubt, and all the money from the KS seems to be just something that they can piss away.    You are misinformed. Saying that ""KS was only used for publicity / gauging interest"" is nonsense. Besides, ""gauging interest"" is built right into the KS system. After all, if a project doesn't reach its basic funding goal, there obviously wasn't enough interest to pursue the idea, and no money will change hands.  Here's what Adam Boyes said on the E3 stage, before Shenmue 3 was unveiled: ""A developer told us they're bringing back a fan favorite kickstarter for PC and PS4. Now this is very much their project, but we wanted to celebrate their announcement on our stage, since this is a game that PlayStation fans have been very, very, very vocal about"".  The first part makes it clear that this is not developed by Sony. The fact that it'll be on PC should also raise an eyebrow. The Kickstarter wasn't Sony's idea either. The gaming press has known for years that Suzuki was looking into kickstarter to bring back Shenmue, after lots of people have suggested it to him. The second part of the quote is referring to the ""BuildingTheList"" campaign that Sony's 3rd party production team has been running for 2 years. Bringing Shenmue to PlayStation has been voted to the top of that list. Microsoft received the same request, by the way.  So, of course Sony would unveil the kickstarter at E3. Shenmue 3 is a unicorn, a game that many believed would never happen (a fact that is all too easily forgotten after the game reached 1 million in record time). Sony gets good publicity and shows that they really do take fan requests seriously (Microsoft didn't, at least not in this case). And the Shenmue 3 kickstarter is exposed to a wide audience (more pledges). It's a win-win. It's even a win for Kickstarter as a platform, and other projects on it, because of the influx of new people (Kickstarter spokesperson via Jim Sterling: big projects generate money and attention for smaller ones).  Immediately after the E3 conference, it was clarified in interviews that Sony would be supporting the game through its 3rd party production process, as well as market it, which was misconstrued as ""Sony does fully fund Shenmue 3"" by too many people. Marketing is certainly important and can cost several millions itself. But Sony does not contribute that much to the game's development fund, which is what the kickstarter and other investors are for.  Cue silly comparisons to the original games' budget, ""but Shenmue 1 cost $47 million ($67 adjusted for inflation)"". Wrong. Shenmue started development on the Sega Saturn, and got quite far there, covering events later seen in Shenmue 2. But the Saturn sold badly outside of Japan and was retired early, so the project was moved to the Dreamcast. This means that a lot of work had to be redone (character models, textures, etc.), while some bits could be reused (concept art, storyboards, etc.) - the budget of Shenmue 1&2 Dreamcast therefore cannot be separated from Shenmue Saturn, they are intertwined. They also had to develop their own engine and tools. The team grew to a size of 300+ people and nobody knew how to manage that efficiently. So, you had that original budget pay for about 3-4 games' worth and a lot of mistakes, spanning a long time of 5 years.  Shenmue 3 on the other hand will be made in 2-3 years, by a much smaller team, with modern game development tools, on the Unreal Engine 4 (free to use, paid via royalties once a game is selling). Suzuki also stated that he's flexible and will do his best within the budget. Meaning at the bare minimum funding goal, Shenmue 3 would be a very linear and story-driven affair. Will the kickstarter money be the only source for the game's development fund? Of course not, most big game kickstarters have other investors lined up. But it's also stupid to say that the money is meaningless, because Sony will fund it anyway. Suzuki has stated in an interview that the kickstarter money really is a significant contribution to the game's development fund.  Is the situation ideal? No. We all would have preferred it if Sony (or Microsoft, or Nintendo!) had fully funded Shenmue 3 out of their own pockets. But it's understandable why they didn't, couldn't, under these particular circumstances (to paraphrase Adam Boyes: Sony doesn't fully fund 3rd party projects, but if Shenmue 3 even could become a first party project, given that it's a Sega IP, the process would have taken at least 2 more years of internal fundraising before development could have started, if it had been greenlit at all; and Suzuki would very much like to start ASAP and retain full creative control anyway, so 3rd party it is). The kickstarter was the only way Shenmue 3 could happen, and that's no surprise, it's been on the horizon for a while. Sony as a partner wasn't really surprising either."
truegaming,3ceqao,rokama,6,Tue Jul 7 11:58:49 2015 UTC,"It seems your concerns are in some sense based on the fear that if AAA publishers `take over' kickstarter, this will negatively impact small indie developers. I'm not sure I agree with this. Yes, Shenmue created a ridiculous amount of hype, for a game that was most likely going to be released with or without kickstarter. However, if Shenmue didn't get a kickstarter, were the people that funded that game going to fund other indie games instead? I'm not sure about that.  Capitalism isn't a zero-sum game, and I think that as long as there are good indie games, people will keep funding them, regardless of the number of AAA games on the platform. Wether people will get sick of AAA games on kickstarter, maybe. I agree they are not much more than publicity stunts, so there's a good chance people will start seeing through it. But I don't see that causing a collapse of indie kickstarters."

Without Shenmue 3, or Bloodstained, or Mighty No. 9 (or Wasteland 2, Torment, Double Fine's project, etc.), many people would never have even looked at Kickstarter in the first place.  These large projects expose Kickstarter to a wider audience, and lend it a sense of credibility. They're more familiar to the average gamer, and are usually low risk and high reward (thanks to the large number of people drawn in, they get far more funding and are better able to handle the occasional hurdle). Most people who join Kickstarter to support these projects wouldn't have done the same for a riskier indie game, but now that they have joined, it's that much easier for little projects to find an audience, especially since a lot of Kickstarters help to promote others, a tactic you wouldn't see if this really was the dog-eat-dog competition you treat it like.  Whether they're going against the 'spirit of Kickstarter' may be up for discussion, but in the end, these smaller studios are doing far better now than they would if the big dogs weren't allowed. If anyone is hurting Kickstarter right now, it's the people managing it. Their changes like no longer vetting projects before they can go public have opened the floodgates for 'buy me a computer' non-projects and trap projects, making it harder than before for the average backer to know which projects they can actually trust.  TLDR: These large projects help get more people on Kickstarter so the little ones have an audience to reach, and even help promote little projects to their larger fanbase."
truegaming,3ceqao,Intelligensaur,3,Tue Jul 7 13:47:11 2015 UTC,"You're mistaken on Shenmue III. It isn't just on Kickstarter to use the platform as a focus group, a proof of market. It is not a Sony game, and Sony is not writing a blank check. It is a Ys Net/Neilo game published by Sony (we can presume) on PS4 and Shibuya Productions (PC) under license from Sega. If Suzuki got all his funding the old fashioned way, he probably wouldn't have gotten any at all, and if he did, it would have taken more than clandestine meetings with Adam Boyes. It would have taken many months of convincing skeptical executives that a $47 million cult hit was worth revisiting and worth the money he was asking for. Raising a good chunk from eager fans allows said fans to put their money where their mouths are, get rewarded for their loyalty and improve the game while allowing developers to make fewer compromises.  I don't have a problem with crowdfunding games, even if it's not the only source of money making them happen. Yooka-Laylee will cost more than what it raised to make, just as movies like Veronica Mars and Wish I Was Here did. Instead, people are treating the Sony thing like it's a conspiracy.  I think that if Kickstarter can be used to prove an interest in long dead franchises (see also: ToeJam & Earl effort), that would be big. That's why the Shenmue Kickstarter is so important. It democratizes the industry by proving to, in this case, Sega, that there was indeed a market after all for Shenmue. What if Nintendo came along next to try to get a new Mother game? Or Konami with Suikoden?  Fulfillment is the bigger problem in game Kickstarters, particularly with smaller developers. I backed a game that carried the Otakon name. Turned out the developer was a deadbeat, didn't pay some of the people who contributed work and communication just went dead. Then Otakon sued him. But fulfillment isn't something one is particularly worried about when Yu Suzuki says if you fund this, it's coming, if Nintendo says it, if Konami says it. Their reputations mean something."
truegaming,3ceqao,aresef,2,Fri Jul 10 03:31:32 2015 UTC,"Just like all the studios, many games get started and only a few ever see the light of day. I don't see much difference in KickStarter. The only real difference is other than a huge company taking the risk, it's the public taking the risk. Sometimes it pays off and you get some amazing games. Most of the time, you get a shadow of what you expected. Then you end up with nothing.  The biggest problem I see is that in the past, you would hear about a game and until you saw something concrete it would be forgotten. Now you go on Kick Starter and you see something concrete (even if it is only a minute demo or rendered cutscene). This creates the illusion that they are close to a game and they just need some more funds to get it finished.  Another huge difference is that the AAA kick starters have mostly succeeded independently so you have the rare case of Shenmue 3 which breaks the illusion that kick starter is a place where an AAA game can be made without a huge studio backing or it will just ultimately fail which is what it might need to do if the support is not there. Truthfully, smaller games have a better chance, but have more competition.   I think you are going to see a lot more of some games gaining popularity on Kick Starter, then you will see large studios jump in for the cut behind the scenes. It will happen because the start up people would rather see the payoff by just signing on the dotted line rather than sweat it out for the 2-4 weeks to see if they can raise the necessary capitol they require to make a real go at it (and then hope they estimated correctly on the costs)  So to sum up: Kick Starter is a great platform for many things and games included. It did go through a bubble and while not busted, some of the air was let out. As such, there will be a change in how games get finished on kick starter. So while not a 'burn-out' there will (and already has started to be) a change in how kick starter is going to be used to get larger games developed."
truegaming,3ceqao,jaytrade21,2,Tue Jul 7 12:05:10 2015 UTC,"It is a good guage of consumer demand. Look at Shenmue 3. Now you understand.   THIS IS NOT TRUE AT ALL. Sorry, it bothers me that people keep acting like that kickstarter proved anything. It took around 60-70k people to reach the goal. That's like 1/10th of the people who bought the original Shenmue, which was on a platform nobody owned. All that kickstarter proved was that Shenmue has a very small, very vocal fanbase. We knew this already. Assuming that the results of that kickstarter will scale up is stupid."
truegaming,3ceqao,OrsikIronfist,2,Sun Jul 12 03:43:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's worth mentioning, but I'm pretty tired of KS game projects going so massively over time. Hyper Light Drifter was funded decently, about 20 times its goal yet it's a year overdue. Doesn't stop the dev from going to E3 and having interviews and stuff and yet the backers can't do anything but sit on their hands. It's even more frustrating with Grim Dawn - that's 2 freaking years overdue! Not only that but when it got on to Steam as early access there was a sale for it below the pledge for the whole game itself. It was quite insulting to see that I as an early backer can't even play what is out now (a fair bit, it turns out) yet people could do it for less than I paid.  KS is a great tool but damn there has got to be some standards to scheduling and even customer protection. Just how much overtime is ok with you? A few months with constant updates and clear progression is ok. Getting to a year and beyond even with glowing updates gets a bit tiring. Don't even get me started on the Double Fine Adventure that was funded well in excess, underdelivered and now they're asking for more money for part 2 (that was part of the original pledge to begin with).  The ones I can speak highly of are Shadowrun Returns (+Dragonfall for backers) and Wasteland 2. Both now have Director's Cut / GOTY versions already available or coming. That is cool and well done to the devs for making it happen.  Early Access to me is more problematic though; It hampers the real release, if there even is one and doesn't really incentivise the devs to improve on the game enough now that they actually got paid for the product. I know you can say the same about KS but there it's understood that the product doesn't exist yet. With Early Access it does exist and whether or not it gets ""finished"" is completely up to the dev. Both systems are ripe for abuse though even at the best of times.  I'm not really soured on the KS model at this point but let's just say I'm less enthusiastic about it than I was initially."
truegaming,3ceqao,feared_rear_admiral,4,Tue Jul 7 13:48:55 2015 UTC,"customer protection   I don't think you can be using kickstarter and think of yourself as a consumer. You need to think of yourself as an investor. With this, you take on a certain amount of risk and should critically analyse the team/person you are investing in. In lieu of KS forcing schedules to be required, investors should be the ones requiring them. If you back a project which doesn't include one or has an unrealistic one, you bear a significant portion of the responsibility.   Hyper Light Drifter was funded decently, about 20 times its goal yet it's a year overdue.   I personally think getting this much overfunding is a really bad thing for a game. There is a difference between having some padding in your budget and being grossly overfunded. A small team is most likely not equipped or experienced enough to handle a project that size. Not to mention that the expectations of the game increase substantially when you raise that much money. A lot of these small teams also promise way to much IMO, especially when it comes to their stretch goals and they usually don't understand how that is going to effect their schedule."
truegaming,3ceqao,chudaism,2,Tue Jul 7 21:36:02 2015 UTC,"But you're not an investor, you don't actually get a share of the company or anything, you are just ordering a product in advance. That is unless you sign up for the $1000 handshake with the dev bullshit tier.  The project doesn't have to go overboard just because too much money was raised. The devs can just as well finish the game they wanted to make, do it well, and use the money for their next project."

Profits for units sold are already factored in (if you know what's good for you when you draw a budget) and that in return goes into paying people, hiring more staff, getting more equipment etc. If the project is funded well in excess as in more than the dev asked for then it's anyone's guess what they do with the extra money really. As long as they deliver what is actually agreed on as far as the project goes.  You don't think getting your project funded 20 times over doesn't open up a lot of options for other things you wanna do afterwards?  Oh and how much do you wanna pay for that by the way? Is 2000 dollars ok? Maybe more, I mean you said a lot."

truegaming,3ceqao,Alex__V,-1,Tue Jul 7 13:51:00 2015 UTC,This is literally true when it comes to Shenmue 3.

It is quite clearly an advertisement campaign where people can preorder the game while the producers can somewhat avoid the bad press preorders generate.

If every game coming out had to go through a KS green light phase then yes, I could see it getting old.    I don't think they'll do it either.

truegaming,3ca89o,Gloamite,99,Mon Jul 6 09:06:31 2015 UTC,"For me its always been telling if you sit still and do nothing what happens? In M&B it's obvious that the world is living. Not immersion, sandbox etc. but a living world. Not because NPCs have set paths and scripted dialog and movement. But it's a compilation of independent systems which play out over time (I guess more of a simluation), but you could literally sit there doing nothing and watch cities and castles fall, battles play out, bandits sack towns etc."
truegaming,3ca89o,AdricGod,51,Mon Jul 6 12:59:00 2015 UTC,"For me its always been telling if you sit still and do nothing what happens?   This is really interesting and I never thought about it before, but it's definitely a good litmus test to see how ""alive"" a game world is. I think this is a big issue with open ended games where developers want to allow players to do quests in any order they want. OP mentioned Witcher III which I've been playing through, and it's a great game but I haven't found it very immersive and I think what you bring up is part of it. It's a big ""oh yeah, this is a video game"" moment when someone tells you to go rescue someone because they are in perilous danger, but if you don't go the quest site for a week there are no consequences. I recently did a quest where someone asked me to help him and his followers with a ritual, and he took off for the site and told me to meet him that night at midnight. I didn't do the quest for a week so I guess him and his followers were just sitting around every night hoping this would be the night I show up? It's jarring."

Each play session involved just getting me back to where I was when I last quit. Then I'd get bored, close the game... come back later, cycle would repeat.  I would've loved the game if they removed that persistent-even-when-game-is-closed element. There's a mod that works around that, I guess, but it looked... clunky and awkward to me.

Skyrim is a beautiful game with clearly a lot of work put into it but if there's anything Mount and Blade beats it at it's the combat. Instead of repeatedly clicking your mouse to kill things with repetitive animations and sounds, M&B gives you 4 different directions to attack in. Then there's the more advanced mechanics like feinting that are impossible in Skyrim. If you enable manual blocking the combat also becomes a lot more interesting. Instead of just holding the block button right before you get hit, you have to predict from what direction they will strike and match that direction with your mouse.

There is a supposed civil war being fought and dragons have just awoken from their sleep, but so what? It doesn't mean anything. Nobody is going to die, cities don't get razed to ground. Does the world end if you sit back and relax? It does not.  Like /u/AdricGod pointed out, M&B is the exact opposite of this. The world doesn't revolve around you in Mount & Blade. In the beginning of the game, you are an insignificant little creature and no-one gives a shit about you. And that's why it's so satisfying to slowly build an army and raise Hell upon Calradia.

Couple with a few random encounters mods and a few mods that apply some level of simulation to civil war battles and other faction wars, and the world is a lot more alive.

truegaming,3ca89o,Flaccid_Moose,2,Thu Jul 9 07:58:38 2015 UTC,"This is also why regiments exists for Napoleonic Wars(and i guess clans in Native?), and a large part why i still enjoy the game after about 800 hours of playtime. Doing events and such with a group of people that grow to be your friends can be really entertaining, and immersive if you're into that too."
truegaming,3ca89o,DimlightHero,25,Mon Jul 6 16:46:44 2015 UTC,"Besides /u/banktwon1's great point on the strength of M&B's combat encounters. I'd say a considerable amount of M&B is in the player's point on the power curve. Like you already said the grind is quite slow. But because there is such a great intricate balance between 'smaller fish' and 'bigger fish' the over-world-map is hardly ever boring either. Having to run from enemy war parties is an experience mainstream games don't deliver(after-all it detracts from empowering the player), and is part of M&B's charm."
truegaming,3ca89o,Raziid,35,Mon Jul 6 10:08:36 2015 UTC,"I love the way Shadow of Mordor simulated an active world. It was such a basic simulation, but very effective and I hope games build upon it in the future.  Orcs having their own agendas, acting accordingly, and being rewarded or punished depending on their actions is such a simple concept, but it is probably the only game where I have seen it executed in a way that is so effective and understandable, yet also relevant to the player.  One of the things I don't like about M&B is that it is difficult to keep track of what is going on in the world or how to act on information.  I hope we can see a merging of the two, where actionable intelligence on actively simulated NPCs allows the player to set goals."
truegaming,3ca89o,samwalton9,10,Mon Jul 6 13:23:03 2015 UTC,"One of the things I don't like about M&B is that it is difficult to keep track of what is going on in the world or how to act on information.   I actually quite liked that to some extent. I found it refreshingly realistic that you only ever knew where people were when you asked someone, and your information was usually immediately out of date, with you only knowing where they were when you asked."
truegaming,3ca89o,Raziid,2,Mon Jul 6 23:13:31 2015 UTC,"I think it has potential for an immersive simulation style, but it too often punishes gameplay. It's one thing when a plan is foiled or something unexpected changes your goals, but its another when in some plays I can't even started.   But, M&B is a love it or hate it game, so I suppose that's just my own bias."
truegaming,3ca89o,pilgrimboy,4,Mon Jul 6 23:18:29 2015 UTC,Shadow of Mordor had the npcs do random stuff? Or was it scripted?
truegaming,3ca89o,wiz0floyd,19,Mon Jul 6 13:40:21 2015 UTC,"It's procedural. Each captain would roll from a table of equipment, character traits, and goals.

Really interesting system and it has a tangible effect on the game world (for example you'll see fights, executions, displays of power, etc)"

truegaming,3ca89o,herrcollin,5,Mon Jul 6 16:58:49 2015 UTC,"Glad I'm not the only PoP fan around. As obvious as it is that the factions are only slightly variations of stereotyped cultures (Empire=Romans, Fierdsvain=Vikings, D'shar=Mongolian, etc, I noticed some merge a couple cultures or concepts) i still find it much more fun than the vanilla world and the fantasy aspect is a nice touch for me.  And the invading armies provide very entertaining battles. Facing off an entire Heretic army with their damn near invincible demonic magni, or amassing a huge cavalry force and riding into battle against the deadly Jatu who probably have more cavalry, or the Melitines who are (I think) exclusively infantry/archers.  And god help you if you try to sack the Noldor capital  The sheer amount of variables, both in enemies presented and how you engage them, makes PoP Warband one of my favorite ""living"" sandbox rpgs.  I often like to play mercenary, jumping between factions and maintaining the ""balance"". Oh, the Dshar are taking lots of ground? Time to fight some dshar. The dshar lost almost all their castles? Time to fight for the dshar for a while.  Then after Ive amassed insane renown from battles and money from prisoners, I eventually just get bored and form a rogue nation.  I prefer to start off by ""invading"" Sarleon and pushing those tools out of mah land.  Edit: another fun game I try to ""play"" is migrating nations.  I try to work it so as one factions takes ground they lose some of their original ground. Keep workong it, pushing it and before you knoe it the Fierdsvain own the Empire, the Dshar are in the north and Sarleon has become a broke faction with random cities everywhere."

truegaming,3ca89o,GallavantingAround,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:32:18 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I misspoke slightly, the mod is certainly inspired by LOTR (isn't everything?) but isn't actually set in the world. I was just trying to make a comparison people would understand. :) From the mods wiki:   The Noldor are indeed elves, but do not possess magic. Their equipment, however, still bears enchantment and is thus some of the most powerful in the game. Your alliance with them will ensure access to this and their extremely powerful troops.   Noldor troops are insanely powerful. Their weakest unit, the Noldor Warrior, is on par with standard top tier units and has far stronger equipment; [...]   The fun thing is, they start out slightly hating you (-20 relations) and you have to get them up to +15 to get access to the troops."

truegaming,3ca89o,jaggular,6,Mon Jul 6 18:51:49 2015 UTC,"One game that really felt alive to me was Space Rangers 2. The genre is completely different, but it had the same feeling. There were other rangers out there trading, fighting, pirating, and just doing their own thing while you did yours. You could also see news reports at stations about events occurring in other sectors that would have real effects regardless of whether you were present or not. There was also an invading force of machine entities that would gradually encroach on all sector as the game went on that you could fight alone or with other rangers, or just avoid as best you could. It's a bit dated now, but still a lot of fun IMHO."

I have yet to see any singleplayer games that do living worlds on a similar scale, which is a shame, because the original SR came out in 2002.  Another thing it shares with M&B is it's phenomenally ugly. The little sketches in the text quests are probably the best art in the game. At least M&B has mods that fix this somewhat."

Apparently people were abusing the shit out of the black hole/space warp/(??) minigame area which apparently rewarded you with money (or something that you could sell, whatever) instead of trying to profit from doing quests. It turned me off the game entirely because as much as I enjoyed it, I was barely surviving, all money was being burned on repairs and when I went online nobody apparently had this problem because they were all abusing that minigame. However, I didn't enjoy the minigame at all and went out of my way to avoid it.  Was this fixed for Space Rangers 2? I.e. can you just play quests and actual profit from them?"

It's a semi-open world game set in the Zone (post Chernobyl explosion, but it takes place in 2012 after new stranges events have started to happen, such as gravitional anomalies or mutants)  It is really atmospheric (has won several awards on that point), you feel as powerless as pretty much any other human in this land, NPC's have their own routines as well as mutants (A-life system), and you can just get back luck and die because shit happens in real life (like stumbling upon a group of bandits that decided to hunt you down).  To be honest, it is not the most hardcore experience you could ever have, the game system has its limits and bugs, and the world doesn't evolve much when compared to M&B. However, the core of the game is really interesting, you quickly get stuck into this unforgiving world that doesn't seem to care about you, and in the end, you may find this to be an exhilarating experience.  PS: Also there's a pretty good mod scene, albeit died by now, that allows for more customization of your experience."

truegaming,3ca89o,correcthorse45,2,Mon Jul 6 16:42:15 2015 UTC,"With mods it can be. Personally I found Call of Pripyat having much more replay value than the others, mostly because of a more fleshed out faction reputation system.  But yeah, it's hard to stack up against Mount and Blade."

truegaming,3ca89o,EdEmKay,6,Mon Jul 6 18:36:45 2015 UTC,"The first one.  You can skip the second one if you want; it doesn't retain the feel.  It's more like a team based bot FPS. There are mods that fix it, though.  The third one is almost as good as the first one.  It has some flaws, but mods also take care of that.  If you want hard gameplay, it has a great mod (Misery) that adds a lot of difficulty and new systems to the base game."
truegaming,3ca89o,PalwaJoko,3,Mon Jul 6 18:50:21 2015 UTC,"i just started the first STALKER and i was so overwhelmed. if you skip the first cutscene, you're literally in a wasteland with a gun and everything to do in like 5 minutes. as a predominantly console gamer, it's gonna take me a while to get used to it, especially as the actual gameplay is genuinely fun too; it's usually a one-or-the-other affair."
truegaming,3ca89o,lochlainn,4,Mon Jul 6 19:38:00 2015 UTC,"Well...don't skip the first cutscene if the Why of the situation is confusing you.  Read quest dialogue. I know it may suck because it's not a common thing to do now a days with games (most of the time they're voiced). The english is spotty sometimes do, but you get use to it.  STALKER isn't a forgiving game. You will die, so save often (I think default quick save is F5). Learn from your mistakes and how things work. Pretty much everything you do can cause different outcomes to occur? You just killed a bunch of STALKERs? Welp, bandits or monsters may move into that area.   I remember going into an area where there were STALKERs fighting military or bandits, can't remember which one. I decided to stay neutral and not get involved. Being hostile with only one of them (the military/bandit faction) I was hoping for the STALKERs to win. They did and you can see their yellow blips on your mini map. Next thing I know, they're disappearing. I'm thinking ""What the hell? All the military/bandits are dead!"". Pretty soon they're all gone and I'm left alone in this big industrial complex area.  Then boom, I see it. Multiple invisible figures running towards me. I died. I'll let you figure out what those were, but it goes to show that sometimes not helping may bite you in the ass later."

truegaming,3ca89o,inquilinekea,19,Mon Jul 6 21:58:28 2015 UTC,"Most AAA games don't really do simulation at all. Games like Skyrim or even Assassins Creed could be so much better if they learned a thing or two from games like Minecraft, Mount & Blade and Dwarf Fortress. With worlds as detailed and pretty as the ones in Skyrim or AC, its a real pitty that they are all so shallow and uninteresting at anything more than a glance."
truegaming,3ca89o,ArabIDF,6,Mon Jul 6 22:13:01 2015 UTC,What would you think of the game worlds of GTA IV/V? Do they feel just as alive?
truegaming,3ca89o,EdEmKay,16,Mon Jul 6 11:20:05 2015 UTC,GTA style sandbox games don't give me the same feeling because there's no way to enact permanent change in them. They feel pretty static. You can see NPCs running around and doing interesting things occasionally but the illusion is broken very fast.
truegaming,3ca89o,Paclac,5,Mon Jul 6 17:47:21 2015 UTC,"i read before the game's release that they tried their hardest to code in a ""life"" for every NPC. if you follow a gardener around, you can see him catch a bus; only to follow the bus then watch him do a day's work. that's impressive and would be great, but the game gives you rocket launchers and jet planes and attack choppers and shit. it was such a bland mix of ""right go have fun then slow down and play our boring as fuck story you don't give a fuck about"""
truegaming,3ca89o,Alex__V,4,Mon Jul 6 19:19:51 2015 UTC,"I think people misread their original statement. They said you would see people waiting for the bus, and see people working, but they never said you would be able to follow them throughout their lives like in Skyrim or Fable."
truegaming,3ca89o,StillMostlyClueless,3,Mon Jul 6 19:35:46 2015 UTC,I think with AC the sort of systems you're talking about might well break other elements of the game and the story. It's just a game that was never conceived or built to be that sort of game - in a way you could pick any game and wonder if it wouldn't be better if they were completely different.
truegaming,3ca89o,why-the,5,Mon Jul 6 20:42:44 2015 UTC,"While not Mount and Blade, a game I've always loved that feels like it has plenty going on without you is Crusader Kings 2.

I knew there was some difference, but I could never quite explain what it was.  Then MrBtongue put out a video coining the word Shandification which explained exactly what made me love some games, but find others empty.  He talks about a bunch of games, but mostly spends time contrasting  Fallout 3 and New Vegas. He explains how New Vegas, in creating a more consistent world, allows stories to feel more organic and gives the player the ability to create their own stories, even if it's just making up backstories for what you find around you.  Having a world where all the minor set pieces and characters are internally consistent means that the story becomes open as well, instead of the 'on-rails' story of most open world games.  You become more connected to the world when the world makes sense.  The world becomes a part of the story, instead of just the setting.  He sums it up by going though games and asking ""What do they eat?"".  The designers of New Vegas accounted for the farms and food production for every city, even though it has nothing to do with the story.  Fallout 3 didn't.  That difference sums up the design difference that make one world feel alive and the other static.     I don't explain it well, but the video really just nails what I'd been unable to explain for so long, and he sums it up with one word.   So, yeah: shandification.  That's what I find most game worlds are missing."
truegaming,3ca89o,Ravelair,5,Mon Jul 6 22:08:00 2015 UTC,The thing that ruins the immersion for me is how limited the role of women in the world is. As a female player I can't befriend any of the women. There are women you are supposed to escort who say they enjoyed the life out camping and being with your crew but you can't offer to let them stay. And towns will refer to you as a guy when you're talking to guildmasters of towns your faction owns.  Would love if as queen of my own faction could combine with another faction if the other leader liked me enough and we married.
truegaming,3ca89o,kalarepar,16,Tue Jul 7 05:24:38 2015 UTC,"The role of women in that world is limited because IT WAS limited in the ""time period"" It's playing out in"
truegaming,3ca89o,tslj,3,Mon Jul 6 18:21:01 2015 UTC,"You're right. The creaters had to choose between modern gender equality in games and realistic medieval world, when women didn't have much to say. They tried to do something in the middle."

As a woman you can also marry heroes. It's sadly a much less interesting option than what the men get, no traditional courting, instead you just have to raise your relationship with them through the regular quest system."
truegaming,3ca89o,TheBigBadPanda,3,Tue Jul 7 20:57:42 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say Warband is a lively world per se, certainly not in the vein of say a Skyrim where you have hundreds (maybe thousands) of unique NPCs with set routines.  But as somebody who was too many hours played in Vanilla, Viking Conquest, and Pendor I kinda agree with what you mean. Even if it's janky as all hell it's god damn fun playing what is essentially a (very) barebones grand strategy game in the third person.  Personally I think that's where my enjoyment comes from. Rebels in Total War get auto-battled, Barbarians in Civilization might be ignored if they're out of the way, but in Warband it's always enjoyable to participate. Since from third person even riding down some half-naked looters is pretty fun."
truegaming,3ca89o,GorbiJones,89,Mon Jul 6 21:21:52 2015 UTC,"I actaully think Skyrim feels completely dead compared to Warband. Sure, the characters are prettier and there are more lines of voice recorded but they are so obviously plastic the lot of them. You can be thane in several cities even if they are at war with eachother yet nothing is expected of you and the guards in those towns still insult you and warn you from picking peoples pockets. You can become grand master in the thieves guild yet you still get the exact same cocky greeting from the thieves in the bar as the first time you came in. Its ridiculous how static and liveless that game is.  Warband is ugly and clumsy, but it is alive. Lords bicker among themselves, form grudges and bonds of loyalty with you as well as other NPC lords, and have separate noticeable personalities. When two factions in the game are at war you dont just have to take the games word for it, there will be actual battles raging between the factions and cities and villages will change controllers as the one side gets the upper hand. If you sit still on a mountaintop and do nothing for a year the political landscape will be compeltely different when you return. In Skyrim nothing would have changed."
truegaming,3ca89o,BreakfastTomcat,3,Mon Jul 6 09:28:31 2015 UTC,"separate noticeable personalities   The issue with Warband I've never been able to get past is how generic everybody is. Sure, it's fun to watch military campaigns play out and see borders shift, but I never felt like I was talking with a person when I met with a lord or a king; they have pretty much the exact same patterns of conversation and responses, and my immersion suffered greatly because of it. At least in Elder Scrolls games they take time to give every NPC a unique name, backstory, and dialogue options."

truegaming,3ca89o,TheBigBadPanda,-1,Tue Jul 7 04:11:03 2015 UTC,"There's something in what you're saying, but I always think it's a bit pointless to criticise a game for what it's not even attempting to do. No, Skyrim doesn't have a dynamically changing world that would exist without you, but it does have an interesting world that can change somewhat and some dynamic elements within it."
truegaming,3ca89o,GorbiJones,15,Mon Jul 6 10:50:27 2015 UTC,"Then what is the point? Why include mechanics where you can become an important political figure if it means jack shit? The whole game reeks of ""fuck it, the fans will eat it up anyway and mods will fix the issues"". Warband is wonky in some areas because of a lack of production resources, but Bethesda certainly didnt have that excuse. Skyrim is wonky in many areas because of laziness, and it shows."
truegaming,3ca89o,Alex__V,4,Mon Jul 6 16:46:59 2015 UTC,"""fuck it, the fans will eat it up anyway and mods will fix the issues""   I'm sick to death of this notion that Skyrim is somehow a terrible game without mods."
truegaming,3ca89o,huntimir151,2,Mon Jul 6 18:12:00 2015 UTC,"I think there's a confirmation bias element in that. Players who play 'with' mods tend towards the idea that the game is broken without them, or that the things they enjoy have been provided by the mods and not by the base game. I have only ever played Skyrim with minimal or no mods at all, and I consider it one of the best games ever made, and in terms of critical acclaim I'm in good company. The same happens to Fallout 3 btw."

truegaming,3ca89o,TooSubtle,0,Thu Jul 9 14:28:22 2015 UTC,"That would be a very poor policy, as consoles and most non-mod users don't use mods. I agree with you that some of the dialogue does not change enough according to your status, but we're talking about one side-element of the game many hours into the experience. But I think that's a pretty flimsy complaint to dismiss an entire developer for. Especially as barely a handful of games have even attempted the complicated open world RPGs like The Elder Scrolls series. I think they deserve more credit.  The element I was really replying to was the comment about the political landscape changing even without the player's involvement. Although there is something elegant about that, I don't think it's much of a criticism of Bethesda that they had different goals with their games. I think a lot of their audience might actually be confused by that sort of system, or wonder why it was necessary at all."
truegaming,3ca89o,Alex__V,3,Tue Jul 7 05:06:53 2015 UTC,"The civil war and the effects and ramifications it was going to have really seems like at one point it was one of the chief tenets of the game, the dialogue, gameworld, plot, and a bunch of unfinished scripts in the files all show this. It was supposed to play out in a very similar way to what you're describing, with events taking place without the player being there, keeps changing hands between the two factions, all with the associated political/cultural fallout. They definitely wanted to do some of the things Mount and Blade succeeds at, but at some point in development they cut most of the planned features out.  I think that almost makes it a fair thing to criticise the final game for. So many elements of what the civil war was supposed to be were left in, and as a result the final game feels incredibly incongruous in many ways."

It's an adjustment and ranged weapons are pretty difficult to use(they don't have aligned first person ""iron sights""), but for single player where you're not disadvantaging yourself as much it makes things more interesting and fun to me.  And yeah, what sets M&B apart from many other strategy games is being able to participate as a unit while commanding troops at the same time. The AI could be a bit better though and it's kind of easy to exploit in some situations, but being the blood soaked wrecking ball that's the only unit left standing on a battlefield can be charming in its own way."

truegaming,3cfdek,bman1394,30,Tue Jul 7 14:05:30 2015 UTC,"Strongly disagree.  I don't think Sega was any more of a risk taker than they needed to be.  They needed to try and be different because playing safe wasn't working for them and it's what killed them, but it was necessary risk.  I think Nintendo used to and still does take risks.  They could easily just make a powerful console to keep up with Microsoft and Sony to reel in 3rd parties and keep releasing the same games over and over again, but they don't want to.  You kind of just gloss over the DS/3DS and Wii/Wii U, which all (except 3DS) were pretty big departures and definitely shook thigs up--risks.  Also, Nintendo may rely on the same franchise characters, but back then and even now to an extent, they were innovating quite a bit.  The jump to 3D with Mario, Zelda, and Metroid, whch spanned across two consoles, was huge.  Think of games like Super Mario Sunshine even, that's quite a different kind of Mario.  Yoshi's Island?  Another bizarre and really unique, new concept.  We just got Splatoon out.  The company has their issues in a lot of ways, but it's totally unfair to say that they just play by the books and that Sega was the innovator/risk taker.  I'll admit Sony and Microsoft don't fit this bill as much, but I don't expect them to.  They don't have a precedent from being back in the Sega console era as much and instead provide strong platforms for 3rd parties to work with, which is ok in my book.  You say Sega was about ""great gameplay experiences that you can't find anywhere else"", which is true to an extent, but I honestly think of Nintendo first when I hear that statement.  You also say, ""Sonic is husk of his former self now because Sega has done his unique gameplay to death. Sega has tons of great IPs but refuses to so anything with them and they continue to be lost by those who don't actively seek their existence.""  I disagree with this as well.  Sonic isn't struggling because they ""did his unique gameplay to death"".  He's struggling because Sega is struggling.  They tried to follow Nintendo's lead and transition him to 3D.  It worked well at first, to some people, but they quickly jumped the ship and the series started to fall apart game after game.  They tried to bring it back to traditional Sonic roots with a twist, like Nintendo has done with Mario, but again just can't find the proper footing with it.  Sonic himself isn't the problem, I honestly think it's Sega.  You are of course entitled to your own opinion like I am, and that's fine.  I just think you're totally sweeping Nintendo under the rug with your argument.  I think there are many points to be made for Sega, yo ujust didn't really hit on any of them for me."
truegaming,3cfdek,KingBubblie,0,Tue Jul 7 14:29:10 2015 UTC,"OK, I will add a disclaimer that I am an insane person who buys and finishes all the Sonic the Hedgehog games.  I honestly don't buy this ""Sonic Adventure was the last good Sonic game"" narrative.  Every Sonic game through like Generations was tweaking the Sonic Adventure formula; if you liked Adventure you'd like them better.  The only reason you can dislike them but like Adventure is nostalgia.    Lost World tried to in a different direction and I think it's pretty successful.  It introduces new mechanics, some of which are radical depatures (a run button?!) but it feels like a Sonic game.  Sonic Boom just stinks though.  edit:  Also I don't know that any of the Sonic games really feel that much like any of the Mario games."
truegaming,3cfdek,RICHUNCLEPENNYBAGS,18,Fri Jul 10 03:46:21 2015 UTC,"You've got two different arguments going here, and I don't think either are that solid. Your title implies the argument is about hardware, but then you never really mention hardware risks, and only write about risks taken on games.    Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo have all taken on high risk projects in the recent past. Each with their own levels of success.   Nintendo has probably been the most notable, with motion control for the Wii. It completely changed the way games were controlled, and games had to be either developed or adapted with this in mind. Motion control wasn't just an option for the console, it was a requirement. That's a big leap away from the traditional controller, and Nintendo basically put all of their eggs into that basket.  I'd also say that Nintendo's continued commitment to local multiplayer games is also pretty risky. As other consoles and even PC focus on online multiplayer; Nintendo has focused much less on this, and has stuck to their core game design, which brings players together in a single place. With the new gamepad they highlighted a-symmetrical gameplay, a style still rarely seen (never mind with local multiplayer in mind).   The DS was also a pretty big risk on Nintendo's part. Maybe it doesn't seem so now, but the DS marked the end of the Gameboy system, and brought touch controls to gaming when cell phones still flipped open.   Sony and Microsoft have both taken bites out of motion control gaming. With Sony attempting to mimic Nintendo, and Microsoft taking a completely different approach with the Kinect. Neither were very successful, and Sony's attempt was really just a toe in the water. Microsoft on the other hand did at least try to make a splash with Kinect, bundling it with the Xbox One. They weren't successful with it, but the attempt can't be denied.   As far as games go, I'm not sure how you can claim that the major console developers haven't published innovative or risky games. Many of Nintendo's signature franchises went through massive changes during the Wii generation (and even made large strides with the gamecube). Sony has put out such a glut of franchises that have introduced new game-play and narrative styles to consoles that its difficult to count them all (Jak II, Heavy Rain, Ico, Last of Us, etc). Microsoft has likely been the most conservative of the three, but even still released games like Fable, and even Gears of War had a fairly unique gameplay style that has been copied ad-nausium since then."

With the new gamepad they highlighted a-symmetrical gameplay, a style still rarely seen   Definitely. Not to mention removing the need for local split-screen for two player co-op while still maintaining local co-op.   The DS was also a pretty big risk on Nintendo's part. Maybe it doesn't seem so now, but the DS marked the end of the Gameboy system   Also hailing an end to the ""Gameboy"" name brand, against all arguments at the time of ""it'll never sell"" only to become a huge success."

It basically resembled what came to market in 2009, a motion tracking wand with a colored sphere on the end. I do doubt though that Sony would have really considered putting it into production if the Wii weren't such a huge success. Either way, it is a fact that Sony did not copy or steal the idea, they independently developed it as a potential controller for the PS2 and abandoned it for whatever reason.    link    edit: added link to wikipedia page for Move that nicely summarizes its origins."

It had success, so much so that they shelved their next gen Gameboy project for it.

truegaming,3cfdek,mtarascio,12,Fri Jul 10 17:25:35 2015 UTC,"On the contrary I think Nintendo takes a LOT of risks... without even stopping for a second what the repercussions of their choices. Amiibo was a financial success but the way Nintendo utilize is poor to mediocre and you can't deny the supply constraints. Their consoles are intentionally under-powered is also a huge risk itself. And recent news even gave them a lot of heat on how they're experimenting with their tried and tested IPs. The fact that they slapped Metroid on one of their new games is a huge risk and frankly I don't see how they'll reap the benefits from this. Of all the three console-makers, Nintendo seems to be the one who takes the most amount of risk with arguably not even bothering distinguishing the risks taken as ""calculated""."
truegaming,3cfdek,seynical,6,Tue Jul 7 14:40:10 2015 UTC,"I think you may have rose tinted goggles on.  Nintendo has taken plenty of risks over the years, both in terms of their hardware and in terms of new software and mascots. Sure, there's always the tried and true Mario/Metroid/Zelda/Starfox and so forth, but In recent past they funded Bayonetta 2, there was Wonderful 101, Pikmin, Xenoblade titles, and much more.  Sega appeared to be taking risks, but honestly, when they still existed as a manufacturer, they leaned hard on their arcade division for their console exclusives. While Virtua Fighter may have seemed like a risk, it was already an arcade hit and having it on the console wasn't a risk, it was a selling point.  To my knowledge, Sega didn't make 2k sports (though they may have published them early on, I forget). But it was no different than having things like Quarterback club and other titles back in the day on Nintendo and other platforms. Just because EA had sports on lock doesn't mean other companies haven't made the effort to compete.  Virtua cop wasn't new either, light gun games have been around since the NES. The cover mechanic was interesting, but again, it was a popular arcade title, and a selling point for a console, not a big risk, and probably cheaper on the console platform long-term than the large arcade machines they developed.   Sonic is husk of his former self now because Sega has done his unique gameplay to death.   He ran/rolled fast and jumped. Sonic was relevant during the SNES/Genesis era console battles, but lost relevancy pretty quickly, despite being a memorable mascot.   When Sega went 3 party we didn't just lose a major hardware competitor, we lost a software juggernaut that pushed the envelope of what defines a great game.   Um... sure. Except that the software ""juggernaut"" still exists. They're just not what you seem to think they are, and you're tying the hardware and the ""seeegaaa"" logo/sound blip with the software developer as a whole. Not everything on a Sega platform was Sega themselves taking a huge risk.   Sega is not of course without its criticisms and one may even say Sega's risks may have led to its downfall   No. Sega royally fucking third party developers without the capital to survive them jumping ship is what led to Sega's downfall. That and having an underpowered, 2D oriented console leading into the 3D generation of consoles, followed by a desperate, early next gen console release that, while good, couldn't compare to more lasting consoles of that generation.   And that doesn't even take into account their use of quad-sided polygons when triangles were the standard, making porting to and from other platforms difficult. Every form of polygon can be modeled from triangles, including squares. Four-sided polys are simply harder to work with (well, were back then, it's debatable now. As a rule, quad-meshed models are rendered to triangles anyway by game engines, but Sega was actually rendering out boxy models due to the limited poly rate on the console and the fact that it only worked with four sided polys, there was no conversion that I know of on the Saturn).  I think you're giving Sega too much credit due to nostalgia, and Nintendo not enough credit due to their continued existence (and therefore no need for nostalgia, you can look at what they're doing now).  It's a ""what if"" scenario that posits Sega wouldn't have changed with the times just like every manufacturer and developer."
truegaming,3cfdek,tomkatt,6,Tue Jul 7 14:58:38 2015 UTC,"Did you see the Xbox One reveal? Or hear about Sony's $380,000,000 purchase of Gaikai? What about Sony having so many indie developers on their stage during their E3 2013 press conference? Or just the fact that they help fund projects by small developers? Microsoft is getting into that now too... How about Sony spending all of that money to own many studios outright? I think Nintendo beating everyone to the current console generation with the Wii U launch was pretty risky as well. As do I think the large investment in VR and AR by Microsoft, Valve, and Sony is. Nintendo risked a lack of exposure to their products by opting out of E3 last year. Microsoft even entering the console market to begin with was a huge risk that took a long time to pay off for them.    How about just focusing on Sony and proprietary hardware? The Cell Processor in the PS3, the memory sticks for the Vita, blu-ray... I mean, I think you're overlooking a very, very, very huge list of risks made by every hardware manufacturer.    Any large-scale production is risky. In my opinion, Sega only seems to be riskier because they take almost exclusively bad risks. You might be overlooking the other companies because many of their risks paid off. But yes, nothing will ever be quite as risky, or quite as misguided, as announcing a new console and having it available for purchase immediately."
truegaming,3cfdek,dogger6253,6,Tue Jul 7 18:34:17 2015 UTC,"The Xbox One reveal was the first thing that came to my mind. Announcing a system where you can't sell your used games and always have to be online in exchange for being able to play your games without putting in a disc? Bundling every console with the Kinect? Those risks are still hurting Microsoft long after they went back on them.  Merely releasing a console in a time when consoles are just pared down, optimized PC's is taking a risk in itself, it's hard to begrudge these companies for not going full-on daredevil on projects that cost billions of dollars to develop."

The xbox is another good point - the system was a failure compared to the Sony consoles and barely sold more units than the game cube.  Without Halo what else did the console have?

truegaming,3cfdek,dispatcher_83,3,Wed Jul 8 15:07:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think Sega took risks as much as they pushed features out too early before they were properly developed. Bad genesis addons, and the Saturn launch was completely botched, had a slow CD drive and had frankenstein hardware. The Dreamcast was again, too early to the game, the controller lacked a second analogue stick and was awkward, it had a 56k modem, but lacked DVD playback and broadband would be needed for 90%+ of online games in the future. Dreamcasts discs also had no copy protection, you could copy/burn a dreamcast game to a CD-ROM in a normal PC disc burner."
truegaming,3cfdek,c010rb1indusa,2,Wed Jul 8 21:13:36 2015 UTC,"I want to say that the Sega Dreamcast is the most ambitious game console of all time without really relying on any gimmicks. There are some circles that would argue that the Dreamcast is the best/most underrated console as well.  I would say one of its greatest detractions was the fact that it didn't quite match up technologically to others in its generation of gaming, given that it was released quite a bit earlier. Sega had already been on a downward trend, and they were becoming the people who focused on niche genres and audiences.  The lack of consistency also kept Sega from being a stable powerhouse. Sony had the highest budget games, Nintendo had its IPs, and Microsoft had Halo. Sega had always been suffering from mixed receptions from its Sonic games, and many of Dreamcast's strongest titles were extremely niche and weren't console sellers.  I would like to equate the Dreamcast to the modern day Playstation Vita. Overall, a fantastic console with an impressive library, but a weak install base. However, those who have picked it up and gave it a proper chance consider it one of, if not, the best console they have ever had.  If you look at how things are now, Sega still has some of the most innovative and interesting franchises out there (Bayonetta, Yakuza, Shenmue), and if not for the fact that they had difficulties in hardware and marketing, they'd be one of the more interesting consoles out there.  I feel like Sega is the path that Nintendo may take one day. They're a company that makes amazing software, but they could be better if they let go of their exclusives."
truegaming,3cfdek,gizayabasu,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:51:39 2015 UTC,"Sega was very experimental, that's the word I'd use. The Sega Channel was an early precursor to Xbox Live Arcade and PSN demos. The modular add-ons for the Genesis (let's put the wisdom of the 32X aside for a moment) were a first, too, inspired the trend since then of console add-ons from the 64DD to the PS2 hard drive to the Kinect. Sega also gave us the first online gaming on consoles. Primitive as it was, the 56k modem being used for online gaming, that was a first for consoles (there was a broadband adapter too, but good luck finding it back then). They had communication via keyboard in games like Phantasy Star Online and got the ball rolling on so many things that Microsoft clearly took notes on in creating Xbox Live.  In terms of games, I think the Dreamcast is where Sega really allowed their internal teams to let their freak flags fly, perhaps a side effect of letting them also have their own identities like Smilebit and Amusement Vision. Shenmue was in development for years, but the internal teams gave us Jet Set/Grind Radio, Space Channel 5, Rez, Skies of Arcadia, Virtua Tennis, Samba de Amigo. Third parties and outside developers gave us Power Stone and Seaman, and we got arcade ports like Crazy Taxi that became something amazing on DC. That freewheeling spirit lasted a few years after that with games like Panzer Dragoon Orta, JSRF, Super Monkey Ball, but as Sega hemorrhaged money and lost talent, that spirit was snuffed out."

Sony let a bunch of untranslated Japanese games onto the PSN for PS3, which was certainly unconventional.    I'm like the world's biggest Sega fan but I don't agree with you.  And obviously now due to its financial situation Sega basically is only tending to its sure winners (Sonic and the yearly Ryu ga Gotoku/Yakuza game mostly I guess)."

The game gives you what appear to be choices, yes, but they're often simply choices of whether or not to keep playing, not moral choices.  The player only has as much agency as a game presents them with, which is often (as it is in Spec Ops: The Line) not very much at all. As a result, it's very arguable that the player bears very little moral responsibility for their actions in linear games of this type; especially when the player isn't aware of the supposed outcomes of their supposed actions.  It's all very well for Spec Ops: The Line to put moral responsibility on the player, but would you put the same moral responsibility on a player of Homeworld for the death of an entire planet? For performing actions that neither they as players, or their ingame character could have anticipated would have that result?  Spec Ops: The Line throws you into the absolute depths of madness; your mission is unreliable; the events of the game are unreliable; your close companions are unreliable; your own character's viewpoint is unreliable. How much responsibility can you reasonably bear when your vision is clouded by so many levels of madness within the game, and so many layers of separation from ""real"" moral responsibility outside of it?

Your points are all valid, but I'd like to discuss this particular section from my personal experience.  This is what it's like in the real world, except we don't find out until years later.  During my deployment, all of the information I dealt with was given to me from the military.  Everyone was operating based on what others had told them, which was in turn based on what they had been told.  We operate that way because we get better results, not because we can guarantee the accuracy.  One question that is being brought up more often is ""What is moral injury?""  I'm a vet with PTSD, and it seems to be centered around ""moral injury.""  I didn't sign up to kill people, and I sure as fuck don't support a war based on lies and greed, but I was never told any of that.  I deployed, like so many others did, with the intent to do the right thing.  I can guarantee that under my watch no one committed any war crimes and no person on either side was killed, but that doesn't change the fact that we contributed to the deaths of over 100,000 Iraqis and destabilized the entire area (not to mention Guantanamo, the Patriot Act, etc.)  Many of us feel like even though we did everything in our power to be good guys, we were the bad guys.  Due to the fact that it's such a large machine and each part only knows its own role, our morals were used to manipulate us into a situation that we never would have agreed with had we known.  Spec Ops uses different reasons to achieve the same effect.  They cram what people learn and experience over months and years into a coherent story that can be finished within a matter of hours.  From my experience, though, it's exactly how things really are.  Lack of information, significant manipulation, and critical situations just kept us unable to step back and find correct answers.  Instead, we had to rely on what was presented to us and figure out how to reconcile the fact that the people who are bombing your base and occasionally killing your friends...may actually be justified in their actions."

We operate that way because we get better results, not because we can guarantee the accuracy.   Also a vet, but one thing I want to address here. The military is a very conflicted entity because it wants to behave like that. Everything is simpler and neater if you do.  The thing is, what separates a good unit from a bad one is their willingness to question the information given to them. And I would argue that any decent unit that does combat operations does question all assumptions, continually.  Why? Because if you don't, you're going to get yourself or someone around you killed. And believe me when I say I know people who died because someone didn't do their due diligence and questioned the situation. Or you are going to burn your intelligence sources. Or any one of a few dozen reasons why it's just a universally stupid reason.  There is a reason the ""fog of war"" is such a powerful concept - it relates explicitly to the lack of situational awareness inherit in combat. But the thing most people don't get - and most games don't really talk about  - is that your own soldiers, units, and biases all contribute to it.  Which, to me at least, is the real point of Spec Ops: The Line. It's not a case of the game embodying exactly how things are - there is no singular truth, and in three deployments to Iraq as an Infantryman spanning 2003 - 2009 I can honestly say I never once had a moment that felt like it was out of that game. What it is to me, at least, is a warning sign - a cautionary tale - one that shows what happens if you don't question the situation or the information you're given or your preconceived notions. And more to the point, that shows why the narratives backing CoD or Battlefield or most major movies are so wrong.  And as a side note: this isn't a particularly new or revolutionary school of thought, here. Spec Ops: The Line was based on Heart of Darkness, which itself was based on even older events. And personally, it's one of the reasons so much of the ""us vs. them"" discourse is dangerous - when you demonize and dehumanize your opponents you stop questioning these sorts of things. Suddenly they're just ""the enemy"" or ""terrorists"" instead of being complex actors, and the situation seems dangerously clear cut.  Make no mistake - war is never that clear cut."
truegaming,3c6al0,Overtoast,2,Sun Jul 5 13:35:41 2015 UTC,Fantastic response and interesting to hear from someone who's actually been in the military.
truegaming,3c6al0,asummar,2,Sun Jul 5 15:56:12 2015 UTC,I just want to point out that in the very beginning of the game Walker's orders are to check out the place then leave. he breaks orders and continues to go in by his own volition. he never had a reason to believe what he was doing was right besides his own judgment and ego. you bring up some good points but they don't entirely relate to spec ops
truegaming,3c6al0,LiterallyBismarck,5,Mon Jul 6 00:38:05 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong but I'm not sure that the lack of true choice matters in this game. In the end it is a narrative but by the very nature of being a game, it's able to convey much more than your typical story. I think the important thing is that you're the one killing the people, that you're the one who pulls the trigger. And it's not completely true that the game doesn't give you choice. There are a few instances where, while you have to progress the story forward, you can make decisions within the confines of the game. My first time playing, I reloaded the game three or four times in order to shoot the ropes that the people on the bridge were being hanged by and escape the situation alive. I took the moral high-ground and it added another layer to the reveal that the two people had been dead for some time. And the game encourages you to make morally questionable choices within the gameplay. It rewards you for headshots by slowing down time just a bit. It lets (and sometimes forces) you to drown people in sand at multiple points. Which is really worse, killing a man by shooting him which can be reasonably quick or suffocating him in a flood of burning hot sand? What about the mob of civilians towards the end? How you choose to disperse them is up to you. Do you shoot some of them because they strung up your friend or do you fire into the air making them run for cover? Those are the three instances I can think of off the top of my head but I don't think it's completely true to say that the game doesn't give you moral choice. In reference to the end of the story, no, it doesn't but it gives you a chance to deepen your involvement in the story based on how shitty of a person you are."
truegaming,3c6al0,symon_says,4,Sun Jul 5 23:33:29 2015 UTC,"Just to add to your point about how the game rewards brutal actions within the gameplay, executions are the only way to make the ""bad guys"" consistently drop ammo."
truegaming,3c6al0,gmano,4,Mon Jul 6 13:37:11 2015 UTC,They're false choices informed by lies written into the game. Not really choices at all.
truegaming,3c6al0,symon_says,3,Sun Jul 5 15:41:33 2015 UTC,"Well of course the ""right choice"" is to put down the controller and stop your sick crusade.   But you didn't make the right choice. Now you have to live with the knowledge that you committed atrocities in the name of following orders or being the hero... That's the point."
truegaming,3c6al0,revolverzanbolt,2,Sun Jul 5 20:45:17 2015 UTC,"If you're really gonna use dumb meta logic as the foundation of the meaning of the game, it's actually the developers fault for making the game in the first place, and then you've got a slippery slope right down into endless pedantic stupidity."
truegaming,3c6al0,JITTERdUdE,4,Sun Jul 5 23:32:01 2015 UTC,"I think the game is saying that the player is culpable in the events of the game in addition to the game's creator. Just like how Walker didn't create the situation in Dubai, but he participated in them"
truegaming,3c6al0,symon_says,3,Sun Jul 5 16:32:36 2015 UTC,"An important quote from Col. Konrad in the game: ""You came here to feel like something you're not: a hero"".   When he says this, he is not speaking to just Walker, he is talking directly to the person playing. The player enters the game with the intention of experiencing a power fantasy through a simulation of modern warfare. One of the supposed messages of the game is that the idea of games like Battlefield or Call of Duty making the player feel like a hero through fighting in modern day conflict that scars and kills thousands of people is just wrong and messed up- even more so, it's also messed up of the player to buy the game with the intent of doing so. There's so many things that this one game has made me think about, it's a shame that it never received much attention."
truegaming,3c6al0,alienangel2,0,Sun Jul 5 23:29:44 2015 UTC,"It's gotten tons of attention for exactly what you said. It's a very simple concept, though all of you seem to ignore the fact that it really should point a finger at the people who made the game in the first place. If the player is ""fucked up"" for participating in imaginary violence, the creators must be totally insane.   But wait! No! It's almost like... Video games... Aren't real?!"
truegaming,3c6al0,Lordxeen,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:13:24 2015 UTC,"I would like to point out that the choices the game asks you to make aren't actually even choices. There are several decision points in the game, and true to the game's goal of using a shooter as a vehicle to make a point in the player's mind, the choices are typically made by firing a bullet or not - do you shoot this trapped guy to save him from burning to death? do you shoot this deer? do you shoot this vision of Conrad or let him shoot you? do you shoot these marines who are here to save you?  But none of them are actually choices, because they have zero impact on the game or [arguably] the game world. The game's story is in fact completely linear despite the appearance of choice. Nothing you do in the game changes any of the outcomes except possibly in your mind (which might be part of the point). But after you choose one path on any of those decisions, the next scene and the rest of the game is unaffected (except the last choice and the ending I guess, since you might be dead if you don't win the fight you start with that last bullet).  Outside of the game's message, mechanically this also means you can get all the achievements for the game in a single playthrough, since it handily checkpoints you at the start of every decision. So you can make one choice, get the achievement, reload checkpoint, make the other choice, get the other achievement, watch both cutscenes, and just proceed, because as far as the game is concerned, both lead to the same followup."
truegaming,3c6al0,CaptainROAR,10,Sun Jul 5 21:33:42 2015 UTC,"The game really excels when it comes to these kind of decisions because it doesn't blatantly tell you what your options are, sometimes barely even hinting that you have a decision to make. Like you, I also put the gun down."
truegaming,3c6al0,JITTERdUdE,16,Sun Jul 5 23:31:22 2015 UTC,"Extra Credits did an excellent 2 part analysis of the game here and here, these guys offer great discussion points on a lot of game stuff and their episodes on Spec Ops were spot on."

truegaming,3c6al0,ObsidianOverlord,4,Mon Jul 6 03:33:55 2015 UTC,Killing is Harmless has a few interesting insights but I found meandering at times. The conclusion was unsatisfying in that it was based on incorrect memory. IIRC the only reason the incorrect reading was left in was because it was copied from a blog post the author had previously written.
truegaming,3c6al0,frogger2504,30,Mon Jul 6 07:38:11 2015 UTC,"You/Walker could have just stopped at any point, but your drive to want to be the hero of the story kept you going. It's an extremely dark game in that sense.   I really have to disagree. I like the game and all, but at the point where I was like ""This is fucked up, I should stop."" I remembered that it's just a video game. It created a disconnect for me that made the rest of the game not really disturbing at all. Up until that point, it was like ""Oh fucking fuck I'm a monster..."" but then it's like ""Oh wait it doesn't matter."""
truegaming,3c6al0,Drakengard,48,Sun Jul 5 06:46:40 2015 UTC,"If your fallback is ""oh wait this is just a video game"" Then there Isn't an game out there that can change that.   I mean if you read game of thrones and get upset when someone dies then immedently remember it's a fictional book and not important then the problem is that you don't get invested enough in the fiction, ya know?"
truegaming,3c6al0,symon_says,16,Sun Jul 5 13:27:55 2015 UTC,"I think it was more the fact that I knew going in that the game was supposed to make the player feel bad for their own actions, and I knew it had that reputation, so it was sort of on the front of my mind the entire time like ""Oh, this is that decision that I'm supposed to feel bad about."""
truegaming,3c6al0,alienangel2,19,Sun Jul 5 20:18:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is a game that you shouldn't go into with any spoilers.  If you know that you're supposed to feel bad then you've ruined the experience."
truegaming,3c6al0,ObsidianOverlord,6,Sun Jul 5 13:41:40 2015 UTC,"Eh, even if I knew nothing, I'd still be left thinking ""well that's pretty lazy emotional manipulation, isn't it?"" It's not particularly difficult to just make people feel bad. Actually saying something original and meaningful and interesting is a bit more of a challenge. This kind of Fight Club style twist where all of my actions lost consequence because he's crazy and there's nothing I can do about it is pretty cliche.   Then again, I walk out of Pixar movies saying most of it is just lazy emotional manipulation with very little substance, so."
truegaming,3c6al0,Leezoat,3,Sun Jul 5 14:07:40 2015 UTC,"I've felt bad for fictional characters in games when it was actually me (the player, not the character) making a choice for my own enjoyment that harms the fictional character - like the end of SW:KoTOR, I had a choice whether my character would completely betray one of my companions or not - it was a real choice, because the game let you go either way, and I choice to betray, because my interpretation of the game was that I'd been lying to this companion the whole game and pretending to be good for her, while being evil behind her back.  I felt bad about that. But in Spec:OPs, none of those alternative choices exist - the game's main atrocity that breaks Walker isn't one the player can choose not to commit because the game won't progress through a scripted battle if you don't commit it. All the other moral choices in the game have no impact on the game at all beyond which cutscene they show you, so there's also no mechanism to make the player feel guilty for wanting to make one choice over another.  I still really liked the game, but consider it more a movie with a powerful message (""you're bad for wanting entertainment and a feeling of heroism out of something as bad as war"") than a game that pulls you into your character. In this one you are just along for the ride behind Walker's eyes as he shows you the consequences of thinking you can be a hero."
truegaming,3c6al0,UmiNotsuki,2,Sun Jul 5 14:26:00 2015 UTC,"That's fair, it totally leans more towards the film or book forms of media than games, I'd really like to see what the team could pull off with a more branching game."
truegaming,3c6al0,alienangel2,9,Sun Jul 5 14:56:02 2015 UTC,Maybe if you actually had any choice at all. They pretend you made the decisions when in reality the only decision was to not play.

truegaming,3c6al0,frogger2504,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:34:58 2015 UTC,It doesn't make it different so much as that phenomenon is what Spec Ops concerns it's literary message with. That's why you often hear it talked about as a damnation or condemnation of the shooter genre or of violent media in general.
truegaming,3c6al0,Soul-Burn,4,Sun Jul 5 23:50:19 2015 UTC,"That point for me was when they forced you to use the phosphorous. I mean, I was in a pretty ideal position to pick off targets inside the ""enemy"" fortifications, so I settled down to do that. But what's this? All the snipers I shoot respawn? And not just respawn if I take too long, but instantly, before the body of the last one I shot has finished falling down? Oh, I guess they really scripted only one way through this ""battle"", so it's not even my choice.  Before and slightly after that it was neat all the times I heard my Walker arguing with his team and had to wonder at how sketchy some of the justifications he/I gave were starting to sound. But soon after the phosphorous bit it became less of a personal message and more of a movie to watch."
truegaming,3c6al0,EdenBlade47,6,Sun Jul 5 23:52:53 2015 UTC,"Yep, same here. It's like... I didn't even do that. Every time I'd seen an enemy in the game before, I'd always waited for them to open fire first. Yet here I am, stabbing one guy in the neck, then burning a bunch of others alive. At the point where my choice becomes ""Stop playing."" or ""Accept that it's a video game."" it kinda forces me to stop caring."
truegaming,3c6al0,UmiNotsuki,13,Sun Jul 5 16:42:53 2015 UTC,"You realized the game is a stage and you're seeing a play, rather than actually being there.

truegaming,3c6al0,EdEmKay,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:14:39 2015 UTC,"Not even just VR. It was kind of uncomfortable playing in first person period. As long as you're far away from the violence it's not bad, but killing someone with a baseball bat in first person, with the camera inches away, the sound amplified, and realistic physics and graphics... well, let's say I'm in no hurry to play a VR hack-and-slash :P"
truegaming,3c6al0,gmano,2,Sun Jul 5 23:42:35 2015 UTC,"No one who completes the game does so without recognizing that it's a video game and doesn't ""really"" matter. The value of the game is how it makes you feel about yourself and about violent games in general. I, for one, remember feeling literally sick after the obvious scene and needing to put down the controller and take a break because I didn't feel emotionally ready to be put back in control of Walker. Nothing like that has ever happened to me in a game before or since, so I'd say it has unique value in that sense."
truegaming,3c6al0,frogger2504,3,Mon Jul 6 07:35:19 2015 UTC,"the only time i've been made to feel like that is with The Last Of Us, which has similar themes. you get given little micro-choices which lead up to a huge crescendo of moral ambiguity, and the game (Ellie) judges you for it. even in firefights, setting a guy on fire with a molotov would cue Ellie to say something like ""Fuck, Joel!"", then I'd realise I just burned a man to death for simply being in my way. I think when a game has a genuine, no-punches-pulled maturity about its storytelling and mechanics, little shit like that can get to you."

In ""Military Shooter 7: Warefare evolveified"" death is pretty. If there is any gore at all it's almost comedic, or done simply to be ""awesome"". It's also transient, none of the characters react to it, and is removed from the game in moments. There are no victims, and are seldom any moments where the right choice isn't clear... You never have to look back on the damage you have done (Hotline Miami did this well, actually).  When other games do have you shoot civilians (No Russian), or torture innocents (GTAV waterboarding), similar things happen... Spec Ops just makes a point of building a game around living with the consequences of these tropes."
truegaming,3c6al0,TwilightVulpine,2,Tue Jul 7 19:42:41 2015 UTC,The only difference with this game is that it points out that it's a bad thing to have done.   Isn't that what satire is? Holding a mirror up to the world of military shooters in order to demonstrate how fucked up they actually are?
truegaming,3c6al0,revolverzanbolt,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:02:03 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I wonder if games presenting you with that choice really ever want you to make it. Like Stanley Parable for instance, there's a section (early on in the game I think, although I haven't finished so that's hard to say for sure) where the game's narrator is just begging you to not go forward (I think by opening a door). The closer to get to moving on the more desperate the pleading gets. So I decided not to. But there's apparently no other way to proceed, so this just means I can't play the game anymore.  The result being I'll never finish the game despite liking the half hour or so that I played of it."
truegaming,3c6al0,TwilightVulpine,5,Sat Jul 11 12:45:43 2015 UTC,"This is the point that I ultimately disagree with and I think Spec Ops the Line is made weaker for it.  If I so much as put my cursor in ""Quit Game"", there isn't a Dubai anymore. Just a virtual box of programmed characters and designed scenery. Nobody killed anybody, nobody is a hero but there is no tragedy either, and whether you ""killed"", or clicked even the digital doll of the civilians, whether you clicked the white shape that would trigger the scene for the white phosphorus massacre does not actually make any difference.  Putting down the controller is acknowledging nothing there is real or of any consequence, so you might as well keep going because it doesn't matter either way. The controller doesn't exist in the storm-ravaged Dubai.  If you could actually make the choice in the game to follow the orders, turn back, give up, that would wrap the message much more strongly. Walker, and the player immersed in Walker made terrible choices thinking that would be the heroic way. But once the immersion is broken, only one bit of everything survives. ""You are not a hero"". That's all. There is nothing bad about even deliberately bringing ruin to that Dubai, because it doesn't exist. And when you realize that, you also understand that the game can't do the whole guilt trip it's aiming for."

They may mean to tell you, after you are done playing, that you should have selected ""Quit Game"", but it was never a real option in the context of the game. They want to make you believe that it was, because it emphasizes the burden of the choices that you made, but if you actually give it a thought you'll realize all there is into it is a menu screen, then blanking out the game back to the operating system or the console menu.  I may imagine that the targets of white phosphorus were conspiring to destroy the US so that it makes Walker's actions justified, but it doesn't make it so.

You/Walker could have just stopped at any point, but your drive to want to be the hero of the story kept you going. It's an extremely dark game in that sense.   Wait, but don't you continue on knowing that it's a fiction book/video game? Saying that we should step back and do something else within the game makes sense since we're in the world of that medium. To say that we should step back and completely remove ourselves from the world that they created, and which we are emotionally invested, doesn't really seem like a reasonable message at all. The equivalent would be something like killing yourself in real life when you realize you should stop ""playing"".  When playing games, reading books, etc. the context that it is still a medium separate from reality is constant. No matter how much you find yourself drawn into the thing, you're never going to say ""wow, I'm such a bad person that I'm going to stop doing playing/reading/watching"". It's just not a feasible thing to do.  In fact, a huge part of motivates me to finish these dark themed stories is simply morbid curiosity.

It takes a certain mindset and emotional investment to appreciate what Spec Ops tried to do (or feel the impact, so to speak); and being cynical and savvy takes away some of its magic. Some suspension of disbelief works wonder here.  Although, I don't feel myself eloquent and qualified enough to really elaborate on Spec Ops and its narrative. There are many who do and books were written on this subject. If anything, try to find an article about a military member playing Spec Ops. It's short enough to digest, but very interesting, I promise.  But instead, in the mean time, allow me to tell my experience with Spec Ops. There's a scene that has always linger with me from the game, that I carries into other games I played: The scene when Konrad demanded Walker to judge a soldier and a civilian - each for a different and probably justified, in their own way, crime. Konrad asked Walker, or to an extent, the game asked me, to execute the criminal. The objective: ""Obey.""  What did I do? I shot the soldier. And then the reveal hit: One when I realized there are other choices, and again when I realized it wasn't a choice at all. I felt horrible. I blindly, and ironically, ""obey""ed the game; even when it set itself up as the villain, the one I should be against. I acted on my own damn sense of judgment without thinking very hard because I thought it's just a game (both video game and a game of choice). I came looking for a PC third person shooter, what I got was much worse. Even better is the fact that I was spoiled a bit of Spec Ops, but I didn't think too much of it outside of ""Spec Ops is good"" - it probably helped made my experience.  This scene and the lynch mob scene are two that hit me the worst when I experienced Spec Ops (surpassing even the white phosphorus scene, mostly because of the degree of choice involved). They are how I came to really appreciate what Spec Ops set out to do, and to me, they did a damn fine job."
truegaming,3c6al0,Hazy_V,3,Sun Jul 5 20:39:08 2015 UTC,"The lynch mob scene is amazing. You don't want to shoot, but they are all surrounding and damaging you. You want to survive. Thinking ""oh it's just a game"", you shoot one of them - ""crossed the line"". Sickness feels you up.  That said, what a person would do in a real life situation is likely to fire warning shots into the air. That's also an option in the game."
truegaming,3c6al0,Soul-Burn,5,Mon Jul 6 04:51:56 2015 UTC,"That's what I did purely in instinct. I had nothing against the civilians, why would I shoot them?"
truegaming,3c6al0,Dawwe,2,Sun Jul 5 10:56:05 2015 UTC,"Personally I hate group think, like it's my bias. So I immediately hated all these little bitch civilians for falling into a mob mentality. BLAMO."
truegaming,3c6al0,bloodstainer,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:58:00 2015 UTC,"Because the game and being jaded from knowledge of how games usually work pushes you to do it.

truegaming,3c6al0,Leezoat,2,Sun Jul 5 14:21:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was honestly one of the best scenes of the game."
truegaming,3c6al0,barristonsmellme,0,Sun Jul 5 14:59:48 2015 UTC,This doesn't work if you actually didn't care whether you were shooting them or not.

That's also an option in the game.   Completely irrelevant. This is a video game, where there are obvious limitations every step of the way. Can you drop all of your gear and try to blend in with the civilians? Why not, that is something you might do in a real life situation, right? Can you scare enemies away by killing all of their friends or shooting them in the arms or legs? Can you capture enemies and take them prisoner?   Players follow the rules, and do not assume that there are new rules popping up with no warning."
truegaming,3c6al0,bloodstainer,5,Sun Jul 5 15:34:54 2015 UTC,"I think that's one of the plus sides. We're still limited to what the game actually allows us to do, but at the same time there are options that games don't usually give us...like the option to not kill urrbody.   I think if the game allowed you to do more in the way of not killing people then it would be amazing but at the same time I'm kind of glad it didn't.   I only went into it thinking it was a quick shooter that would kill a few hours so I'm pretty much stuck with what I ended up taking from it initially. If you had any idea what the game was about when you went into it then I suppose it would be an entirely different experience."
truegaming,3c6al0,GoodLuckCowboy,2,Sun Jul 5 19:52:47 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, game design is often an exercise in evoking a certain feeling in people, whether it's true or not. And that's one reason why I think one of the biggest flaws of the game is assuming ""putting the controller down"" is the right answer.  If you put the controller down, you realize the whole world you were immersed into isn't actually real. And that obeying or defying it's rules has no real meaningful consequence."
truegaming,3c6al0,Soul-Burn,0,Mon Jul 6 12:48:17 2015 UTC,But the lack of option is what makes this game lose its connection to reality and ultimately makes me feel like I'm just shooting a wall that in my way.

truegaming,3c6al0,symon_says,0,Mon Jul 6 12:46:25 2015 UTC,"By that far into the game I think I shot both of them.  I'm not sure why I'm this desensitizes to these situations in these types of game, as a counter I'd like to point out that the game ""This War of Mine"" Managed to make me cry and things like simple notes and hearing other people whisper gave me a much more emotional reaction than this game ever managed to.   Again, anything I did in Spec Ops never made me feel bad, would I have felt bad if I had to do these things for real? Probably, yes, but in that situation I would probably have done the same things because in that specific place and time he's trying to survive and in that environment all bets are off and I don't really think any of the kills done were his choice.  This War of Mine manages to tie survival to a very.. realistic way of thinking, I know what its like to be hungry, to really feel like you're about to die of starvation and what you do in that game is not ""survive"" in the same sense, a lot of things you do is to make sure you're going to live long enough to see the end and to keep living. You become attached to people that are both a burden and might come to help you, but in the end they might die from very small things.  I guess I never really had any emotional connection to the people I was killing in Spec Ops, it felt like driving over hookers in GTA and I don't really recall any person that died in that game which I felt like was a real person, This War of Mine on the other hand manages to make every person feel like a living, breathing person."
truegaming,3c6al0,TheObvoiousTruth,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:36:19 2015 UTC,I don't think Radioman was insane. The only reason he was an antagonist at all was because you're Walker. Any other situation and he'd have been one of the good guys.

Especially if you bring up the fact it's silly to pay for a game you're not actually supposed to play (I don't believe putting down the controller/uninstalling is a choice, it's just pretentious).  edit: My point is being proven further down and it's quite funny."
truegaming,3c6al0,boopaboopa,6,Sun Jul 5 23:27:13 2015 UTC,"I hope you don't mind me thinking out loud here, because I don't actually understand the opposition to this 'stop playing being a choice' reasoning.  Of course it's a choice. How many games have you stopped playing because the narrative didn't engage you or the mechanics were too clumsy or for whatever other reason?  But suddenly when a game actively tries to work it into its narrative that the actions of the player-character are too horrific to consider continuing on, this suddenly becomes an unacceptable answer.  I think that if another work of art, say, a book or a film shocked you or affected you enough to stop consuming it (or in the case of some books/films I've consumed, never wanting to consume them again) we would say that that work has succeeded in some way.  But then again we don't often think of games as art in the same way."
truegaming,3c6al0,sigma83,6,Sun Jul 5 09:55:25 2015 UTC,"The problem is that ""stop playing the game"" is a choice of the player, not of the player character. It's an out-of-game thing, not an in-game thing. If events in the game make you uncomfortable because they depict the transformation of a character into a monster, stopping the game is not going to change anything. It's the equivalent of trying to save a character in a book by not reading it, or trying to prevent the death of a character in a series by not watching it. It makes no sense because it confuses different levels of reality, so to say. If the problem is with the character inside the game, then the solution has to be inside the game too, like giving the option to abort the mission and coming back home. The shocking aspect of the acts of Walker rely on your implicit belief in the reality of his world. Recognizing that you should stop playing the game to not be complicit of his acts also necessarily frames the events of the game back to being, well, a game. By even thinking about stopping the game, you directly invalidate the reason why you should stop in the first place."
truegaming,3c6al0,boopaboopa,3,Sun Jul 5 10:45:44 2015 UTC,"How many games have you stopped playing because the narrative didn't engage you or the mechanics were too clumsy or for whatever other reason?   Going to stop you right there. Narrative being unengaging or the game being unfun or buggy isn't intentionally trying to give you the option to not play and get a refund. Big difference. If I stop playing a game like Spec Ops or Assassin's Creed or Zork or what have you, I don't expect it to be because the developers don't want me to play. That's a huge difference between your comparison there and what Spec Ops does.  Telling you ""well, you could've stopped playing anytime"" is not a gameplay choice. I could just as easily send them a letter saying ""well, you can refund me anytime"". Guess what, they probably won't.  That's not worked into the narrative. That's worked into the finger wagging behind the game itself. ""Don't use this product"" should never be a choice when I shelled out money for it. Imagine if EA did something like that? Reddit would be in an absolute uproar.   we would say that that work has succeeded in some way.   No, I disagree considering people have different tastes and are offended by different things. I wouldn't say Star Wars succeeded for someone if they felt the Force was blasphemous in the same way that A Serbian Film would succeed in making someone uncomfortable and not wanting to watch.  I think of games as art. I just don't think Spec Ops does a good job of conveying its message without the devs seemingly being overly ""Well you shouldn't have done that!!!!!! Why did you play the game you bought?!?!?!!"" ... but I definitely feel games are art because I've played games like Planescape: Torment, Grim Fandango, Wasteland, etc. There's huge potential and great examples of fine/good art in the gaming world.  I just don't think Spec Ops is one of them and I don't feel ""stop playing"" is a gameplay mechanic, it's a cop out that furthers the rhetoric that punishes the player for playing. Some of us like to use the products we pay for and if they didn't want us to play the game, then it shouldn't have ever been $60. Reddit turns a blind eye to Spec Ops because it fits the hivemind of the website."
truegaming,3c6al0,barristonsmellme,3,Sun Jul 5 11:03:46 2015 UTC,"You made your choice. You finished the story. That made you complicit.  You could have stopped, but you chose not to. That's the entire point."
truegaming,3c6al0,Madplato,4,Sun Jul 5 13:36:17 2015 UTC,"So I'm supposed to pay for a game that is supposed to sit on the shelf and not be played? That's ridiculous.

We're going to have to agree to disagree since you didn't actually address any of my points that addressed yours and, instead, threw the same ""that's the entire point"" rhetoric at me that reddit normally defaults on about this game.  The game should have given you a choice to get back on the helicopter or leave somehow; not tell you ""you should've turned the game off"". there are better ways to convey the message through gameplay and the developers did not do that."
truegaming,3c6al0,Zeholipael,3,Sun Jul 5 13:46:58 2015 UTC,"I disagree that the game was made to not be played, but entirely agree with your other points.   I think it was made to be played with the afterthought that you could have stopped at any time but chose to be the hero...but actually stopping playing it would be silly.   There absolutely 100% should have been the choice to make your guy go ""fuck this i'm out."" and just fly off. I mean the character has already gone off the rails a bit by then anyway.  It's like in Farcry 4. Without going into too many details, you can either play the game as you're expected to play the game, or wait around, hear a guy out and finish it without any bloodshed on your part at all.   Even if you took the ""good"" option, you'd probably still find yourself going back to see what the other paths were.    It's much like games with multiple endings. It doesn't mean that there's 5 endings you're not supposed to play, it (hopefully) means that you'll play it until you see every path open.   But to end, I do still agree. The message was conveyed pretty well through the story IMO, but through gameplay, not so much."
truegaming,3c6al0,Dawwe,2,Sun Jul 5 20:47:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think people are getting it when they say ""you could've stopped"". Of course you could, but that's not the point. You're supposed to play it to the end, then realize you made the whole thing happen by wanting to be the hero.   If you don't play it to the end, you won't get this and if they offer in-game resolution, it's much more about the character than you as a player."

If I'm to believe ""turning off the game"" is a valid choice then the game should've actually had other choices in it, too. I mean, its whole message is about what ""YOU"" should have or shouldn't have done and why ""YOU"" did that and do ""YOU"" feel good about yourself and how ""YOU"" should evaluate how you play shooters.  No. I'm fine with people enjoying Spec Ops: The Line as there (on reddit) is a big following.. but I don't understand why those of us that don't are called wrong because we don't agree ""stop playing"" is an option for playing.

Please say where the game calls you a bad guy, did a little note come out of your harddrive?   No, and you know it doesn't. But it's easy to read between the lines as it's a fairly shallow narrative and rhetoric. The white phosphorous scene being the biggest offender.   And guess what, every story ever made is a railroad   Sure, in books. But in books you're reading the experiences of others. In a game, you're controlling it. Compare a game like Fallout 2, where you can become a porn star and then end the game in about half an hour, to Spec Ops: The Line. SO railroads you in unnecessary ways and then acts like you had a choice. And you know the difference, you're just being difficult now."

All that happens is (because the lot that claim Spec Ops is some form of a million dollar guilt trip only mean one scene, and forget the rest of the game) the main character makes a mistake, which leads to a very bad thing. How that equates to that the player should feel bad is completly your own interpretation."
truegaming,3c6al0,WiseOctopus,5,Sun Jul 5 13:50:05 2015 UTC,"The game doesn't really condemn the player for wanting to play the game, it is simply a deconstruction of the Modern Military genre.  Walker doesn't see evacuation as an option, in the same way that most players don't see turning the game off as an option. If Walker keeps moving forward, eventually he's going to be the good guy. All his wrongdoings will be justified, because he's the hero of the story. The player thinks that eventually all these shitty things will be justified, and they'll get to feel good about playing a game about shooting people.  Many players expected a modern military shooter in which they get to shoot Bad Guys and feel good about it. The game is asking if that's okay. There is only one choice that matters in Spec Ops: The Line. The player chose to play a game about shooting people.    And really, the only difference between Spec Ops: The Line and something like CoD or Battlefield is that Spec Ops is aware of how fucked up that choice is. Spec Ops doesn't let the player forget they're playing a game about shooting people.    In terms of narrative, choosing ""quit game"" is no different to Walker evacuating Dubai. It wouldn't make any difference if there was a small cutscene of him doing it."

The CIA helped you fuck it up; they wanted everyone to die so no-one would escape to tell everyone else what happened.  Also, the game isn't about your choices, it's trying to tell a story and make a point. It would be a pretty awful game if you could make all the right decisions (which, let's be honest, you're probably only making because you know what happens later) then everything would be fine, the game wouldn't be able to make a point.  The story is about Walker and it's commenting on other war games. It's not about you. The entire point is that Walker should've followed orders and turned back pretty much as soon as he got there. He fucked it up by trying to be the hero. Other games tell you that you can save the day and be a big hero, Spec Ops is telling you the opposite. You're supposed to become increasingly disconnected from Walker as the story goes on. The game doesn't want you to question yourself, or your own decisions, it wants you to question other games that let you save the day and tell you how great you are, no matter what. It's essentially saying that if you behaved in real life how you behave in video games, you'd be a terrible person."

The only faction you could reasonably place on a good/evil spectrum is Delta, since while they're motivated to do what they think is right, they only cause death and destruction wherever they go.

You are the character. Infamous is just a train with a few forks in the road, which generally merge together anyway. Different track, but the same route."
truegaming,3c6al0,LiterallyBismarck,7,Sun Jul 5 13:08:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's impossible to have a good story with a few choices, but in general it only works if the story is in some way about the choices you make. Otherwise you're devaluing whatever point you make.  Spec Ops is a rare game that isn't just telling a good story, it also has a very definite point to make. There are a lot games with otherwise decent stories that don't really come together in the end, probably because they weren't properly planned out, or because they tried too hard to make the player feel like they are the main character. You might enjoy the story, but you'll still be left wondering what the point of it all was. What lessons am I supposed to take away from this? Have the characters learned anything or grown in any way?   With Spec Ops, the writers knew exactly what they wanted to say, and allowing the player to change the course of the story would completely take away from that.   It's kind of like when people complain about movie characters making bad decisions, despite those decisions completely fitting the character's personality. If you wrote a story about a bunch of characters taking the most sensible course of action at every oppurtunity, you'd have a very boring story. The same goes for video games. If you let the player work their way out of the driving conflict before the end of the game, then the plot would entirely fall apart. You can't go halfway."

The two hanging men were imagined. Everyone else is real.   His original mission was to see if there were survivors, and he was supposed to immediately stop and call backup. He didn't. He wanted to be the protagonist of his own fantasy, and ended up ruining Dubai in the process.

truegaming,3c6al0,nitrowizard,10,Sun Jul 5 18:35:29 2015 UTC,"They had no real leader, some went insane and started killing people, the rest just holed up and tried to do what they could for Dubai. Most of the people you kill in the game are innocent."
truegaming,3c6al0,allacctsarethrowaway,9,Sun Jul 5 06:38:57 2015 UTC,"This is a good link for a relevant video by Errant Signal: http://youtube.com/watch?v=wlBrenhzMZI  It's important that they don't literally want you to stop playing. They want you to rethink the way other games will commonly throw npc lives at you and still call you a hero, with little consequence or acknowledgment. They parallel such games (especially the military shooter) while showing you actual consequences, from the blatant destruction you cause, to the psychological damage on Walker.   Gamers have learned to just accept the extreme amounts of violence, and Spec Ops turns this on its head by even using the same logic in a loading screen: ""It's just a game."" It's a common defense of violence in gaming, yet it devalues the very medium. It's a bit heavy handed, but I'm not sure it would have gotten the attention it did with subtlety."
truegaming,3c6al0,skunkboy72,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:42:55 2015 UTC,"exactly. it's good not because it has a remarkable story, but because it calls your actions, you, the player, for what they are. Lara Croft?, Nathan Drake?, Ajay Ghale?,Max Payne? etc. they're not ""heroes"" they're sociopaths, mass murderers... and by extension, so are you.  It's about the double standard of games industry and society as a whole, where it's all fine to play a game where you murder thousands of humans in cold blood, but god forbid they show a nipple in the proccess."
truegaming,3c6al0,Sithrak,7,Sun Jul 5 07:07:08 2015 UTC,"Other people already explained the ending, so I'll just give my take on the game.  The fact that Spec Ops got infamous to a certain degree for its story I think lead to many people going into it expecting something that it's not. It's not about the player as much as it is about Walker, it's a linear story about choice, but not a game involving much choice. There was (and still is) lots of debate about the White Phosphorous scene and I think if you treat Spec Ops as a linear story about Walker it works just fine.  I like the fact that Spec Ops made me feel some distress without being outright unenjoyable as an experience, something that I would love to see in other videogames in the future, though other people with other preferences may just find it tedious or frustrating. What I respect about Spec Ops is that it succeeded in making the very experience of me playing it memorable."
truegaming,3c6al0,correcthorse45,5,Sun Jul 5 06:50:53 2015 UTC,"Spot on. The game did a great job of separating me the player from Walker the protagonist. In most games, I think of the character as ""me."" They're shooting at me, so I have to shoot them back. But this game was different, and I didn't really pick up on the why until the end. But I found myself saying things like ""Man, I think this guy is losing his mind."" followed by some scenes later ""Yep, he's absolutely lost his shit now."" So it definitely works as a linear story about one guys decisions with us as the spectator.   Simultaneously, it's a huge slap in the face to the entire genre, and asks some really tough questions about why we play games like this. Why did I spectate Walker's story when it made me fairly uncomfortable?"
truegaming,3c6al0,tonyal18,13,Sun Jul 5 16:00:05 2015 UTC,you were never in control this whole time   I feel like that is one of the main themes of the game.  He isn't in control of his mental state or his actions.  As players aren't in control as much as we think we are either.  We just go along with what he thinks and says because that is what games have always trained us to do.  Instead of thinking and questioning what we are doing we just do it.  Kinda like the whole would you kindly thing from Bioshock.
truegaming,3c6al0,Toysoldier34,9,Sun Jul 5 16:27:17 2015 UTC,"I feel like that is one of the main themes of the game. He isn't in control of his mental state or his actions. As players aren't in control as much as we think we are either.   He even says it out loud just before the WP scene, heh heh   SSG Lugo: There's always a choice. CPT Walker: No, there's really not."
truegaming,3c6al0,tonyal18,2,Fri Jul 10 08:41:37 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think the main point is that people often THINK they aren't in control when they actually are. Walker could have turned back at any point, but to him, that would be unimaginable because he's ""Following orders"" and he think's he doing whats right. This parallels to the player in the way that, at any point, you could have stopped playing the game.  Now, of course, I don't think the game is literally suggesting that people should have turned off their PC and sat in the corner to think about what they've done, but rather that they're using it as a narrative device to show that there is ALWAYS another option."
truegaming,3c6al0,nitrowizard,8,Sun Jul 5 19:58:03 2015 UTC,I think spec ops did a poor job with decision making in the game.  Often times the choice was to keep doing the wrong thing or stop playing. If you stop playing that isn't doing the right thing it is removing yourself and never finishing the story. A game is an interactive story. If I buy a game I am going to go though and get that story good or bad. In many games that offer the player choices they offer the player the opportunity to do the right or wrong thing in game and often players will do the right thing. In my opinion it wasn't meaningful on the developers part it was lazy.
truegaming,3c6al0,FvHound,11,Sun Jul 5 22:17:27 2015 UTC,"From the player's perspective it is the wrong thing but the main character sees themselves as a hero and in the right. There is supposed to be the growing disconnect between the player and the main character. It is partly commentary about how in most military shooter games we don't think twice about doing what Spec Ops main character does and thinks. Just in this game it isn't portrayed in as bright a light as it is in a game like Call of Duty for instance. Where he should have followed orders and ended his mission when ordered, but instead he had to be the hero and save the day doing whatever it took because he felt it can't be wrong, he is the hero."
truegaming,3c6al0,tonyal18,4,Sun Jul 5 15:13:05 2015 UTC,I have no problem with that. My main issue is that they talked about all of the choices that could be made when in reality you choice was to finish the game or stop playing. I actually really liked the game I just think trying to market it like you have a meaningful choice was kind of crappy. I mean technically every game has a choice to stop playing or finish.
truegaming,3c6al0,correcthorse45,3,Sun Jul 5 16:48:26 2015 UTC,"This is only tangentially related to what you said, but I thought I'd share my view on Spec Ops. I agree that the story doesn't include a lot of choices, but it certainly is a game about choices. I had the luxury of going in relatively uninformed so I don't know how the game was marketed and I agree that marketing it as having meaningful choices would be a bit disingenuous.   I think it's important to remember that Spec Ops is first and foremost Walker's story and, on another level, commentary on the genre. I've read and heard lots of reactions on the game and this is a thing many people (I think) get ""wrong,"" they are quick to assume that Spec Ops is about the player himself, maybe because they heard about the game beforehand and went in expecting to have their personal morality challenged. If you treat it more like Walker's story instead of your own I think debated scenes like the infamous White Phosphorous make complete sense."
truegaming,3c6al0,tonyal18,2,Mon Jul 6 17:53:14 2015 UTC,"I see this repeated argument everywhere, are you saying it would only be a good reflection on choice in games, if there was always a choice to do the right thing?  Like instead of firing at first, you communicate, meet up with the 33rd, and spend the rest of the game securing the water truck to citizens.  Reality check: No game let's you have that ultimate power of choice. They worked with what they had with the medium they got, I can not see what choices you could add that would add anymore weight than the ones already in the game."
truegaming,3c6al0,bloodstainer,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:53:25 2015 UTC,No I'm not suggesting that games need to give you choices to ride off into the sunset. But the game was marketed in a way that suggested there were in game choices that mattered.  You have the choice to stop playing with every single game on the market. I'm not saying it was a bad game. I am saying there were no meaningful decisions in the game. The issue is that they didn't work with a medium.  I don't expect ultimate choice. I expect in game choices.
truegaming,3c6al0,Soul-Burn,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:19:05 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, one of the central themes of the game is that you ALWAYS have control over your actions, and another option. Walker could have gone home at any point, but to him, that would be unimaginable because he has to ""Follow his orders"". This is in way that you, the player, always have the choice to stop playing.  (Copy and pasted from another comment): Now, of course, I don't think the game is literally suggesting that people should have turned off their PC and sat in the corner to think about what they've done, but rather that they're using it as a narrative device to show that there is ALWAYS another choice.  Basically, what I'm saying is that, throughout the game, you have no (In game) choices, because Walker think's HE has none, as well."
truegaming,3c6al0,Dawwe,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:26:03 2015 UTC,I have no problem with that. I really enjoyed the game. I don't think every game needs choices. My only issue was the way it was sold as a game that was going to have choices. If they didn't want to include in game decisions they could haveasily marketed it as walkers story and I would still enjoy it. Often times when you hear about spec ops the line you hear the argument that the game did have a choice that the player could stop at anytime but the player wants to be the hero so they keep going which is wrong. In walkers story he wants to complete the mission at any cost and it's a good story along the way. The player isn't necessarily motivated by wanting to be the hero rather than the fact they paid for a game and want to finish it for the story. In my opinion it could have been marketed a little more accurately.
truegaming,3c6al0,SkateboardCop,15,Sun Jul 5 19:17:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I actually think the game failed to invoke any really good emotional impressions, I don't feel bad for doing something when the game doesn't actually give you a choice, if there were actual choices to be made with different consequences all together that would have been different. But the whole ""You could have stopped any time you wanted."" Well.. I didn't because this game got kind of hyped for me for being morally heavy etc etc when I feel its borderline shallow on the point of some CoD & BF games."
truegaming,3c6al0,Dawwe,16,Mon Jul 6 05:45:08 2015 UTC,"But there are actually multiple choices available to you - from the player's standpoint.   Judge the soldier / thief - you can choose to shoot either of them... or shoot the soldiers in the back. The guy under the truck - you can shoot him to end his pain, or walk away to hear him yelp as the fires consume him. Lynch mob - you can shoot the people (""crossing the line"") or fire warning shots into the air. The 4 possible endings - Suicide, surrender, fight and die, fight and win. Possibly more I forgot by now.   None of these actually matter to the story or have an effect on the game. They all however have an effect on you the player and how awful you feel if you choose the less moral alternative."
truegaming,3c6al0,Dawwe,4,Tue Jul 7 00:45:03 2015 UTC,"But one of the most heaviest scenes, the white phosfor (or whatever) part had no choice. In fact, the game completely railroads you into fucking up. I remember thinking ""oh a huuge mass of white... Yeah I better not shoot there"" and then when I shot a car or whatever a bit away the game decided I totally shot them and killed them all...   The following scene created the biggest disconnect in the story. Like ""oh look how bad you were killing all the civs"". Nah game, that was all you thank you very much."
truegaming,3c6al0,sigma83,15,Mon Jul 6 17:58:46 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point of a linear story, the game makes you think you're doing the right thing that you really need to bomb these soldiers then you get the reveal that it was civilians. It's not about how awful you are for choosing ""melt a hundred women and children to death"" over ""open a shelter for disabled puppies"".   Soldiers don't get choices about following orders and Walker believes he's doing what's necessary and you the player don't get a ""ok but what if we just got ice cream instead"" option because not every game is a choose your adventure game.  Spec Ops is a game about showing that war has consequences besides ""make everything better and get a cooler gun every once in a while"" and it relies on tropes and expectations we have from 10+ years of the generic military FPS genre."
truegaming,3c6al0,Dawwe,-4,Tue Jul 7 01:03:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the game has some really good moments, but that scene was not that well handled. It was really really obvious if one was not just firing madly that there was something weird with that white mass.   https://youtu.be/-b7TaLjdXMc?t=2m3s  It was a while back I played this but that's the scene. Now I was looking at that and it was obvious that the mass of ""enemies"" had something odd about them, so I carefully shot close to the last tank, but as far away from the civs as I could. Well suddenly the smoke spreads to all the civs, which it hadn't done at any time before. Sorry, but that's bullshit and I'm not gonna feel bad for consciously trying to avoid exactly that, which the game was trying to do."
truegaming,3c6al0,correcthorse45,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:50:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah the problem is that this target audience isn't gonna buy this game. The game play is pretty mediocre honestly.   I wasn't actively looking for something, but as I've said unless one is shooting wildly it is very obvious that there's a group of civs there."
truegaming,3c6al0,Drakengard,7,Sun Jul 5 14:27:44 2015 UTC,"I remember thinking ""oh a huuge mass of white... Yeah I better not shoot there"" and then when I shot a car or whatever a bit away the game decided I totally shot them and killed them all...   Friendly fire happens. Accidental discharge happens. Collateral damage happens. No plan survives contact with the enemy.   Spec Ops is a meditation on the very nature of war, as it is communicated to us via FPS video games."
truegaming,3c6al0,Soul-Burn,2,Sun Jul 5 15:12:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah that would be fine if it was less heavy handed. It was a while since I played but I believe I litterally couldn't proceed without shooting. The camera was still and nothing was happening. So after waiting a while I tried to proceed by shooting far far away from the white mass (which I assumed was civs) and the game killed them.   So after making the two decisions to 1 not shoot and then 2 shooting far away the game acted like the only decision I made was to shoot right on them, and Walker acted accordingly. I couldn't really feel bad after doing everything I could to avoid them."
truegaming,3c6al0,Fun1k,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:43:47 2015 UTC,"I feel that that scene is meant to put you in Walker's shoes. To him, there's no other choice, this HAS to be done to save people, it's not his option.  Although, if you want to look at it on another level, the scene does also present you with the choice of not continuing the game, proverbial of Walker ""Going home"".  The way I see it, Walker is in the mindset that he's not got an option BUT to use the White Phosphorus, in the same way that you'd think it's not a legitimate option to just stop playing the game."
truegaming,3c6al0,bloodstainer,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:21:29 2015 UTC,"Eh, the first is invalidated once it's shown again later in the game.    The second is mercy for someone who doesn't deserve it.  He's dead either way.  He begs.  I shot him, but you've already doomed Dubai anyway so it's not like that makes up for it.  You're a bastard anyway.  The Lynch mod still kills your friend.  Even if you don't kill them, they're all going to die of starvation/dehydration anyway.  A bullet might have been kinder than scaring them off back into the ruins of Dubai.  The endings are interesting depending on what you think Walker deserves.  Has he suffered enough or should be punish himself by staying in Dubai with his madness?"
truegaming,3c6al0,Soul-Burn,9,Mon Jul 6 18:23:04 2015 UTC,These are exactly the questions players are asking themselves. Different players feel differently and reason their actions differently. That's what makes these mechanically worthless decisions interesting to me as a player.

I don't recall if it was Fight and die or fight and win really don't remember.  This game never made me feel awful, and I think it failed on that aspect."
truegaming,3c6al0,bloodstainer,3,Sun Jul 5 19:48:37 2015 UTC,"Most people who played the game did get affected by it, so I can only guess you're not the target audience for this game. Nothing bad about it, different people - different experiences."

It's a good comparison to SpecOps for being depressing. I'm glad it conveyed these feelings better for you than SpecOps did!"
truegaming,3c6al0,I_HEART_GOPHER_ANUS,0,Sun Jul 5 15:32:14 2015 UTC,"You should check it out, I generally am not the biggest fan of survival game, but the reason why this game was so emotional for me was because you never felt like you were in charge of what happened, you just made decisions and the outcome wasn't always clear and that's what made it so realistic and really connected with me."
truegaming,3c6al0,SkateboardCop,3,Mon Jul 6 08:30:06 2015 UTC,"I didn't because this game got kind of hyped for me for being morally heavy   That's the issue here, I think. Hype is cancer."
truegaming,3c6al0,bloodstainer,9,Mon Jul 6 12:54:30 2015 UTC,"you should see the promotional material for the game  The Launch Trailer  e3 trailer  Narrative Trailer  Even having played the game several times it hard to really glance much information from those trailers. The most I could figure out (assuming that I haven't beaten the game and this is the first time hearing about it) is that the game might be a little darker than most shooters but it still looks like a real ""bro-y"" ""gritty"" military shooter, just another CoD or BF clones.   But if your first exposure to Spec Ops on is a post on reddit going ""DEPRESSION SIMULATOR 2k12 AMIRIGHT GUISES???"""""" then even without having plot elements spoiled the game has basically been ruined. Spec Ops absolutely requires it's slow building up and does everything so perfectly but the second you find out that the game has a BIG OLD TWIST DONT READ UNLESS YOUVE PLAYED you're ready for the big twist, you pick up on the hints faster.  So if you're recommending Spec Ops to somebody don't tell them it'll fuck em up, just tell them to set aside a lazy weekend, play it in one go and that's a pretty fun shooter and that they should just trust you on this. I had two friends who had never heard of the game and were completely blown away once they beat it, everyone I know that pulled it out of their backlog because of topics like this didn't enjoy it nearly as much."
truegaming,3c6al0,SkateboardCop,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:10:24 2015 UTC,"I saw spec ops the line for cheap in the PS store when I had heard absolutely nothing about it. I wanted to get it but I passed over it because it looked dull, CoD style ""burly military dude standing in the desert"" art and just like something I wouldn't enjoy playing.  I'm disappointed I didn't get to have the ""pure"" untainted experience but I played the demo before deciding to buy and the best thing it had to offer gameplay wise was shooting sand from the ceiling to fall on enemies. Obviously they weren't gonna show much in the demo story wise but seriously, I just couldn't justify spending 20 bucks on what appeared to be a generic story shooter with little replay value."
truegaming,3c6al0,bloodstainer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:16:45 2015 UTC,That probably one of the reasons it flopped financially and it's hard to convince somebody to spend 20 bucks (which I believe it still costs on steam) on a generic military shooter from three years ago. I mostly just lucked out that I bought a 2k bundle for some other games and at a certain price point they threw in Spec Ops and The Darkness II for free and then I finally played it when I was bored out of my mind but only had the attention span for a generic shooter (ADHD problems tho)  and I was pleasantly surprised by the time I had beaten the game.
truegaming,3c6al0,CrazyMyrmidon,0,Mon Jul 6 13:22:37 2015 UTC,"The problem I see is that they failed to market it to every crowd, this wouldn't have worked as a great game or introduction to narrative experiences for CoD/BF fan boys and the more mature crowds ignored it for what it was, the only people who would have been really impressed with it would be the ones who got that ""un-hyped & untainted""  experience but once again, that's a very niche crowd of people willing to spend money on random shooters that doesn't really.... like random shooters.   Again, I like narrative experiences and I look for them in games like Witcher, Divinity: Original Sin & Wasteland 2"
truegaming,3c6al0,bloodstainer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:27:41 2015 UTC,"absolutely, it's a real conundrum, is it possible to advertise a game without it's big twist, especially when that big twist relies on the game disguising itself as a generic shooter (especially since Spec Ops was a generic shooters series in the past but ended up losing to CoD and BF and became irrelevant)     Even worse how do you prevent review sites from spoiling the big reveal? You could probably communicate with IGN to keep the story on the DL in their review but now you're just being advertised as a generic shooter. But after that you can't prevent word of mouth from ruining the story for other people.  So basically a game like Spec Ops is one of the interesting (and imo, a really good ""art game"") games to have come in a long time but it's completely unmarketable, so it's kind of amazing that even exists. I would absolutely pay for a documentary on the making of it because it's so odd that 2k would knowingly fund a AAA title knowing that it would probably flop."
truegaming,3c6al0,boopaboopa,0,Sun Jul 5 16:45:43 2015 UTC,"Hmm it might be that the twist the game should provide perhaps shouldn't be tied to marketing at all, look at Knights of the Old Republic, Warcraft III, Diablo and Final Fantasy. A lot of these games had amazing plot twists that weren't the reason why they sold well.   Its weird that presenting a story should be a twist rather than presenting a plot-twist in a game where you already expect a plot. I'd say that's much more efficient."
truegaming,3c6al0,CrazyMyrmidon,9,Sun Jul 5 18:58:43 2015 UTC,"If you can, try reading some of the literature on militainment, and the article 'War Bytes - Spec Ops: The Line and the Critique of Militainment'.

Again not trying to invalidate your idea, just not very fond of spending time to make the game seem good prior to playing it.  I'm not saying the game was bad, but I think the gameplay was kind of dull and it wasn't the type of story I really like, I personally found Apocalypse Now to be a pretty dull movie and I'm tired of FPS/Third person cover-based shooters and find them to be dull over all. The last shooter game I found interesting was Deus Ex: HR & perhaps Mass Effect 3 but that was definitely because of the RPG elements of ME3.  I personally don't enjoy stories which aren't dependent on player-impact with no chance of interaction and no chance to change the outcome of it.  Again, all just personal preferences and I prefer RPGs so this game might just not have been for me."

If you did not enjoy Fallout 2, would it matter a lick if I told you ""Aw man, you should read A Boy and His Dog and watch The Road Warrior to fully appreciate it"" would you do it, or think it's silly to read a book/watch a film just to enjoy a video game that should stand on its own merits?"

truegaming,3c6al0,Kazinsal,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:30:24 2015 UTC,"I don't fully understand that term, my only experience with CoD was completing the first game's single player and from my understanding of things the later titles in that series were just multiplayer focused, I don't see why you would call someone a sociopath for being indifferent about killing other players in a multiplayer game.   Not caring about faceless NPCs with no character development is not being anything, just a gamer familiar with games, and frankly as someone who plays RPGs a lot, this game failed on the character development on the main characters of the game, why should I care about the non-characters.  Look at Witcher III and compare some of choices you have to do in that game's Witcher Contract, if you're not familiar with the concept I'll break it down easily because this is one of the most morally heavy game I've played where the choices are simple yet... cling to you.  Your job is basically that of an Assassin/Witch Hunter/Vampire Hunter/Monster Hunter and you're a rare breed an outcast and you take money for it, because hey you gotta survive and you haggle for the price etc etc, sometimes you run into your pray after taking a contract that you realize its not even a monster at all, simply a being of mischievous deeds or maybe a theif or whatever, in the end  you might actually have to decide whether the crimes/wrong doing they've done (which you're connected to, because you've spent time and effort hunting them down by player Sherlock along the way) are worth the punishment (their head). But the difficulty isn't one of many other RPGs where its just Good vs Bad, Bad vs Wrong. Its a very grey scale and when they manage to put a lot of the blame on you, the main character because in the end, not killing them will in many cases lead to you not getting paid at all. These choices are probably some of the most heart-twisting I've done in gaming because it's literally my own green being weight against my conscience, because after the hunt/investigation you're bound to have enough character development, and in my opinon the best kind of development because you might not know what they look like, so you start imagining what they sound like, talk like, how you're going to beat them, use which potions, which oils etc etc. And in the end they might be a harmless trickster trying to survive."
truegaming,3c6al0,teeno731,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:23:20 2015 UTC,"for what you say, well, you're not a sociopath, you still have a concience, and that's the important thing. in games, regardless of the genere, you are role playing, that is, playing the role of a certain character, so it's your own morals being tested and shaped against the paradigms of the game. in Spec Ops, remember how they say: ""he turned us into fucking killers!"". you know what i hear? ""they, the game developers, turned us, the players into killers"" as long as the npc are faceless  we have no qualms on doing the most horrible things, eating away your sensibility so one day you can do the same IRL. think of the AC130 gunners or the drone pilots. for them it's like a video game, yet the consequences are very real. do they even feel anything any more? do they still realize those white dots in the screen are people too? like the white phosphorus scene. it's so easy when you don't have to see their faces.  The last 2 or 3 CoD have put you in the shoes of terrorists, where you slaughter hordes of civilians for no reason. what's the effect of that on players's psique?  in the witcher 3 you have to get to know your mark and that puts a face on the otherwise faceless goon, but are they any different? no. Only that you know a few details about them. maybe if you could get to know each and every character in a game, players would be more mindful ...or maybe not."
truegaming,3c6al0,Bossman1086,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:31:44 2015 UTC,"Yes but I felt, as a role player the set being served to me in Spec Ops wasn't very convincing it felt too surreal to even get emotionally attatched to anything.  It might be because of the fact that I personally don't see spec ops soldiers as anything other than highly trained assassins. Its comparable to Assassin's Creed or Hitman.   Everyone on Spec Ops were just that to me, faceless goons, no more than farm mobs in an MMO. That AC130 gunner thing is pretty fucking terrible (in case you're talking about the real deal) but that's exactly the kind of mentality and morality I except from American soldiers, sorry it might sound judgemental as fuck but frankly, lack of respect for human lives, racism and somewhat superiority is the type of thing I generally associate with American military. Basically English speaking SS. The only difference is that the SS were given orders to kill jewish people. But the military efficiency and coldness of it all is surprisingly familiar. Keep in mind, most SS didn't hate jewish people, but that's what making it so terrible, they slaugthered thousands because of orders. I can see the comparison the developers are trying to do, but I think just claiming their ""Civilians"" doesn't actually work as an ethical string to pull players into guilt. I think, if they had put some racial context to the whole thing we would have seen some really interesting things going on. Sure its set in the middle east, but its not emphasised whether we're killing persians, arabs, christians, Israeli etc. Something as simple as that would have at least given a face to the people we were ""killing"" the problem is that ""Civilians"" doesn't really carry any meaning to it. Had the soldiers in the squad been outright racist, and actually said some despicable things I might have convinced me.  But I frankly don't believe in the ""American soldier feels bad for killing innocents.""  Well that's the job they signed up for when they went into a civilian area in a foreign country, pretending like they disliked the notion of taking a life when they're trained to do it is something I won't buy"

It's a Vietnam War adaptation of the same book that Spec Ops: The Line is a shoot-mans-in-the-desert adaptation of.  And yeah, the game is chastising you for buying it. It's kind of dumb from a business standpoint but for evoking ""whoa dude"" in literature fans it's top fuckin' notch.  Personal opinion: Mediocre cover-based fight-the-ambiguously-brown-terrorists shooter with some plot twists and a bit of a heavy anvil delivery. Well acted cutscenes, but if I'm going to watch a Heart of Darkness adaptation cinematically, I'm going to do it through Apocalypse Now."

Why should you care?"" May come off as a bit pretentious, but I understand the point as well. Should you be invested in the story of the game and follow Walker to the end of it? Or does the game monumentally fail to grab you since it is overall, just a  dumb video game that makes you go from point A to point B? I think it was kind of cool that they were pretty aware of these sentiments and the polarized reaction the game would go on to get.  As for the gameplay, I liked it. It reminded me of Gears of War and I thought the shooting was tight and I loved the environmental destruction and chaos. However, the cover system was not on the same level as Gears and it frustrated me a lot. Also, the ""Adapt and Overcome"" situations were very few and far between.

Everything in the game is built to make a disconnect between what the player would do in a real moral situation and what the player is being forced to do because 'it's a shooter, and that's what you do'.  Its trying to show you how little people think about their actions in shooters, and throw the normal reward of 'being a hero' power fantasy on its head."

You'd already killed the other civilians at the beginning, and they knew the CIA was trying to kill everyone. And then you start actually working with the CIA.   The entire point of the plot is that everything would've turned out much better if Walker hadn't gotten involved at all. He sticks his fat nose in it, trying to be a hero, when it was clearly not a good idea, and he fucks everything up as a result. He then does everything he can to deny that he'd messed up, and everyone else dies because of it.   Before he got involved the city was pretty fucked but had a chance of surviving.

There's a part of the game involving napalm, and there's no way around using said napalm, yet the game tries to make you feel bad about what you did.   There was never a choice, and pretending that ""stop playing the game"" is a legitimate choice you can make is very elitist.   I enjoyed the ""it's all in your head"" part of the game, as well as the openness of the ending (which was really the first sign of actual choice in the game), but overall I think other games have done a similar thing better."
truegaming,3c57w1,UpdatedMyJournal,28,Sat Jul 4 22:23:24 2015 UTC,"You answers seem to approach complexity from a standpoint of ""how do we get players to understand this complexity"" instead of ""how do we make a simple but deep system."" Just understanding the complexity is not making something easy to learn but hard to master.  Rather, I would argue that the way to achieve this is by making the complexity optional. An optional complexity implies a standard simplicity. One way this can be achieved is by having the complexity come from the combinations of simple elements.  For example, imagine an RPG where each class learns set skills automatically and also gains passive bonuses. Anyone can just pick up and play that class but someone who wants to look deeper can see that the passive bonuses of one class will go really well with the skills of another class, so they level both and combine them into a new stronger class. Final Fantasy Tactics did this. Its base was simple: pick a job and play it. Its combinations were complex. I think I ended up with Ramza as a Dark Knight/Chemist with Ninja dual wield, Thief movement, and a Monk counter attack."
truegaming,3c57w1,kuroiryu146,3,Sat Jul 4 23:04:35 2015 UTC,"I really like the idea of having a simpler path with the option of complexity for those who want it. Actually, it reminds of the automatic level up systems that a lot of games have implemented. I totally forgot about those. I guess I was focused on how the actual character specialization process could be made more approachable (because I enjoy it), rather than thinking about how the overall game could be made more approachable. I still think it's worth thinking about, but I see now that it's not as central as I thought. Thanks for the perspective!  Out of curiosity, I haven't played Final Fantasy Tactics myself so I have a question. Is it likely that an uninitiated player will be able to win the game without multiclassing, or if they multiclass in an inefficient way?"
truegaming,3c57w1,Grimfelion,3,Sun Jul 5 01:00:46 2015 UTC,"The thing about Tactics is that you are never locked into a class... Technically. The only thing prohibiting you from changing classes is how long you want to spend leveling them. Ever character can be every class given enough time. Plus their ""cross class"" is misleading... You are the class you are, but you can use skills you've learned from other classes in certain skill slots.  Someone may be able to explain it better...   You should definitely give it a shot though... You can get it on 3DS or iOS or I'm pretty sure it has been emulated..."
truegaming,3c57w1,kuroiryu146,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:52:29 2015 UTC,"The game could be pretty hard but the skills were simple enough that it was easy to see how things could fit together and it was very obvious that you were intended to multi-class. There was no real way to make a mistake that couldn't be corrected by spending some time to unlock the right skills until you found a combination that solved the problem being presented. Ultimately, your question is moot for Tactics because there simply weren't any uninitiated players. The system was simple enough that everyone could understand it and by not heavily punishing trial and error, every player learns the complexity naturally."
truegaming,3c57w1,Toysoldier34,3,Sun Jul 5 03:31:33 2015 UTC,"by not heavily punishing trial and error   I guess this is probably the key. If the system is not overly punishing for failure, then it's possible to learn as appose to just quitting.  Also, I'm sorry if I'm being annoying by asking another question, but I'm kind of interested in playing FFT now. Would you say the game involves grinding?"
truegaming,3c57w1,kuroiryu146,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:41:59 2015 UTC,Final Fantasy Tactics is an amazing game as is the follow ups Final Fantasy Advanced/ Advanced A2. Personally FFT Advanced was my favorite and is a great one to play.  It seemed to be a little less grindy and a little simpler in good ways. It is less intimidating and a good place to start as FFT has permadeath for characters that don't get revived which was a big turn off for me. The perma death makes it feel like grinding is needed much more to ensure your team is strong and is less likely to be killed and lost.
truegaming,3c57w1,dankisms,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:39:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, unfortunately, but that is the way with JRPGs. I might recommend Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together instead.

truegaming,3c57w1,aNonSapient,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:32:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's a moderate amount of grinding involved - if you just rush the storyline you're going to get your ass handed to you.  Grinding isn't your typical dull beat-on-weaklings snoozefest as in many RPGs though. Sure, you could just sit there and steamroll a bunch of weak enemies but as expected you won't gain much from it, plus it's a waste of time. See, in this game skills don't discriminate on what they're cast on - you can buff and heal enemies and attack comrades if you wish. Now consider that any successfully executed skill gains job points and xp, and you start thinking of creative possibilities beyond simply healing an enemy to keep it alive so that your teammates can wring as much xp from it before it gets killed."

truegaming,3c57w1,TSED,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:58:22 2015 UTC,"Level up stats are affected by which job the character is currently in, but for the most part stats take a back seat. Far more important are the job skills you unlock and make available to each of your party members. There's no real danger of leveling inefficiently - unless you never take the time to explore what skills are available to the various jobs.  The game's difficulty started at a slightly higher level than usual (you can lose the tutorial battle) and if you just rushed through the storyline maps you'd often just scrape by, until the later maps overwhelmed you.  However, if you took the hint and took a break from the story battles to do some extra leveling of your jobs you'd quickly find yourself with numerous ways of shutting down the enemy.  Despite this many players seemed fixated on damage, due to conditioning from most other games which are much shallow by comparison and focused solely on damage. In FFT all you needed was to concentrate on a few debuff types, which would nullify enemy numerical and strength advantages. For example it doesn't matter how powerful the enemy mages' spells are if you can inflict silence/petrify/frog/don't act/sleep/chicken/etc on them. Really, all it takes is to pay attention to your skills. The game was only tough if you stupidly focused on trying to up damage as much as possible. I loved how FFT rewarded you for thinking beyond just blindly beating on the enemy.  It's a PSX game so you can emulate it on your PC."
truegaming,3c57w1,DocMcNinja,14,Mon Jul 6 15:26:14 2015 UTC,"Here's something that seems VERY OBVIOUS to me, but I almost never see it put into practice:  Keep mechanics separate.  You want to have a wise-cracking thief?  Cool.  The 'thief' part can be done with just grabbing anything you can get away with, and the 'wise-cracking' part doesn't have to be tied to ANY level up mechanics whatsoever.  Just take the snarky responses as they come up.  NONE of this comes from putting points into ""wise-cracking thief"" instead of ""how to punch dudes"" or ""fireballs"" or ""refined stabbing techniques for dummies.""   Your wise-cracking thief could now easily be a guy who wears a robe and makes fire come out of his eyeballs or a dude who grafted extra arms onto his biceps so he can punch you while he's punching you OR he could be a skulky backstabbing type, whatever.  Doesn't matter.  The key here is to not force the player to keep different systems separate.  Want a dialogue system?  Cool, don't make it take combat skill points.  Want a separate skills system to help define out-of-combat characterization?  Cool, don't make it take combat skill points.  Want to make your separate skills system do something in combat?  NO, STOP, WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?  This has the following benefits:  1) You can build the character you want while playing the personality you want. 2) Combat balancing is easier, because you no longer have to worry about what'll happen if someone minmaxes pickpocket and stealth and strips every encounter before it happens, or a 500% potent strength potion ruining damage expectations for the level, or etc.  Combat is combat and you've isolated that system. 3) You avoid making characters useless in situations their specialty doesn't account for.  Can't have a massive pitched battle because you don't want the smoothtalking rogues to be creamed and unable to progress?  No longer a problem! 4) If the writers have any amount of awareness of the system, they can focus on the writing instead of whether or not you can put a plothole into a situation via skills. 5) Need to cut out a feature to make a deadline?  Since everything's less tangled together, it's FAR less likely to send the whole game system crashing down with the removal of X!  There's no expectation that it will be there in a half dozen other investment opportunities (which otherwise become traps and need rebalancing, which takes up more dev time, which defeats the purpose of cropping for deadlines). 6) Removes arbitrary and unnatural-feeling restrictions.  Anyone who's wanted to make a fast talking fighter in D&D without houserules knows what I mean.  I'm sure there's more but I'm tired of typing this and am gonna go eat food now."

truegaming,3c57w1,LeVentNoir,2,Tue Jul 7 17:52:28 2015 UTC,"The closest I can think of off the top of my head is Pillars of Eternity.  It's not a perfect example, but the skills in that game can be completely ignored if you want to.  They all have effects that can affect combat, but very rarely in a direct manner.  Survival, for example, increases the duration of consumable items.  You can eat an omelette of superstats and still get the superstats without any survival, but you get the stats longer with a higher skill.  Stealth allows you to initiate combat closer to the enemy, which can mean absolutely nothing or quite a bit depending.  Lore lets you use scrolls.  So on and so forth.  All of them have the potential to affect, but don't necessarily do in the same way that leap attack requiring 8 ranks in jump in D&D 3.5 does.  The old Infinity Engine games were pretty good at separating combat stats from dialogue.  You'd get characters reacting to your class / race, (two choices which DO affect combat quite a bit) but you generally wouldn't have to put points into sweet talking or whatever.  Planescape: Torment is the exception to that, but that was the whole point of the game so I can't complain that much."
truegaming,3c57w1,TSED,-1,Wed Jul 8 12:29:06 2015 UTC,"Let me get this right. Your mechanics are separate: The combat is separate from the dialogue, is separate from stealing, is separate from the magic, and none require any trade offs at all.  Ah, yes, the ""bland jack of all trades character"".  Give me a framework now, about how this works. You level up, and get skillpoints falloutstyle? You have to make tradeoffs. You get better at what you use skyrim style? You get good at everything. Of course, classic class based rpgs fail you hard.  Now, lets ask some questions: Thief, you mean stealing. So how is this stealing thing not tied to your ability to pick pockets, break locks and be stealthy? How is this stealth thing not related to your ability to avoid or overpower enemies?  The entire heart of an RPG is about trade offs, and you're down the wrong rabbit hole.  You don't want a completely isolated set of game areas, you want little to no interconnection to get the fast talking fighter, and frankly, if you're playing DnD for that, you need to up and change systems. GURPS would support you just fine though."
truegaming,3c57w1,LeVentNoir,4,Wed Jul 8 02:48:29 2015 UTC,"The combat is separate from the dialogue, is separate from stealing, is separate from the magic, and none require any trade offs at all.   I never said this.   Give me a framework now, about how this works. You level up, and get skillpoints falloutstyle? You have to make tradeoffs. You get better at what you use skyrim style? You get good at everything. Of course, classic class based rpgs fail you hard.   I'll use my homebrew system as a basis for an example.  So you make your character.  You pick 3 skill trees (essentially just receptacles for skill points), and pick 2 proficiencies (like orienteering or lockpicking or bartering).  Figure out how your stats are allocated, pick which one of the 18 combat skills you could buy (6 tier 1s per tree, so assuming you actually picked 3 trees instead of saving one to pick up later, you have 18 options).  Level up.  You get 1 skill point to buy a skill, and 1 stat point to increase a stat.  Stats are generally only for combat, though I confess it makes a lot of sense to use some of them for dialogue or proficiencies.    The skills are all pure combat stuff - this one passively increases your armour, this one lets you create whirring blades of bone when you hit a dude, this one allows a passive aura that inflicts fire damage, etc.  There is no 'get better at lockpicking' skill.  You want to steal stuff?  Well, sure.  Just do it.  Whether or not you just waltz in, take everything, and waltz out while pounding a police forces' faces in, or you carefully maneuver your thief through and prevent him from being seen, you're still being a thief.  (It's impossible to keep the systems 100% quarantined, despite my ragging on that, so alternate options like an invisibility spell are pretty likely to show up in this case)  Then for dialogue: well, why do you NEED to invest in diplomacy?  That seems a little silly.  Just roleplay the character.  You can have the writing set out to allow you pick your options properly.  In a tabletop game, this is the most infuriating thing: why does making yourself less effective at fighting make you more likely to succeed in intimidating someone?  You should never have to sacrifice the core concept of the character because the system has limited resources for a character as a whole and option X is too expensive to grab with unrelated option Y.   The entire heart of an RPG is about trade offs, and you're down the wrong rabbit hole.   I disagree with this statement.  The heart of an RPG is to create a character you want to unleash on the game world.  Whether it's a ravenous bloodthirsty minotaur-deathknight or a lucky local-hero halfling slinger, you should be able to play what you WANT.  Here are a few examples of characters my homebrew system has given birth to:   A kobold poet who fought as an avatar of celestial goodness when she wasn't too busy working off her student loans as a lab assistant. A gnomish arsonist who loved to research, then once he had gleaned whatever he cared to, he'd reduce the library to ash just because fire's pretty. A lizardman courier who broke time in order to deliver messages faster, plus being able to be in multiple places simultaneously was pretty handy in self-defence situations. A very respected professor who knew just about everything about anything, and also happened to be a male stripper (whose dances were also incredible combat support).   The trick was just to have the trade-offs within their own separate systems.  Dialogue was easy enough since it was tabletop (just have actual conversations, believe or do not believe as you wish).  The combat system had its own self-limiting factors (you COULD jack-of-all-trades, or you could hyperspecialize, or whatever), and same with proficiencies.  TL;DR it's possible."
truegaming,3c57w1,TSED,-2,Wed Jul 8 11:10:13 2015 UTC,"So, your homebrew system is a shallow combat tree, where literally the only thing about your character you can mechanically develop is how good they are at killing.  I'd never play under that system.  Oh, it gets BETTER though, you're crippling your players to characters that are only as social as they are, which speaks volumes. I play DnD with an autistic kid, who for some reason plays the silver tongued bard. Too bad under your homebrew system he'd never be able to do it.  And then there's stealth system, or complete lack of. How are you able to tell if the guard saw me? You can't, and thus, another flaw in your system is revealed.  I'm telling you this, because while your tabletop system might work there under a narrow range of circumstances, it would not translate into a video game. You would need mechanics for stealth, magic and social actions, which involve tradeoffs betweebn the areas or a bland jack of all trades character.  If I want to play the character I want unrestricted by rules or systems, I write fiction. If I want to make tradeoffs, and solve challenges within my not perfect characters abilities, I play RPGS.   just have actual conversations,   Clearly never played with nor wish to accomodate people who are not perfectly eloquent. Go away, you and your friends clearly have something which somehow works for you, but I'm going to stick with robust systems."
truegaming,3c57w1,LeVentNoir,4,Wed Jul 8 11:42:54 2015 UTC,"Holy Christ what's made you so bitter?  You get a 1 paragraph summary which is trying to explain a different concept instead of detailing its combat system and you jump straight to calling it shallow?   where literally the only thing about your character you can mechanically develop is how good they are at killing.   Not true.   I'd never play under that system.   Very likely.   Oh, it gets BETTER though, you're crippling your players to characters that are only as social as they are, which speaks volumes. I play DnD with an autistic kid, who for some reason plays the silver tongued bard. Too bad under your homebrew system he'd never be able to do it.   Hey, did you know that most tabletop RPGs do this?  Most of the critic's darlings do - Apocalypse / Dungeon World, Mouseguard, Fate, Burning Wheel, etc.?  Or do you just stick to D&D, GURPS, and hackmaster?  Frankly, yes, it does penalize less eloquent people trying to play eloquent characters.  Different people want to play different games.  A lot of people hate d20's ""roll to see if your completely reasonable lie succeeds or not"" mechanic.  There are several possible solutions to the problem you're detailing: play a game that has a much stricter character / player divide (like D&D), play a character more in line with your own approach, learn to get better at speaking under pressure, get GM leniency, or flip the table and then flip everyone the bird.  Some of these approaches work better for different people, and there's nothing wrong with that.   And then there's stealth system, or complete lack of. How are you able to tell if the guard saw me? You can't, and thus, another flaw in your system is revealed.   Yes there is.  It's not a flat ""here is my stealth skill, do I pass his perception?"" thing.  It's more like playing an actual stealth video game, but I have no interest in wasting my time explaining actual mechanics to someone so angry.   I'm telling you this, because while your tabletop system might work there under a narrow range of circumstances, it would not translate into a video game.    It was actually designed first and foremost to be a vidjagam.  The tabletop translation was played for balance testing and it's pretty obvious when some of the math that requires a calculator comes out.   You would need mechanics for stealth,    Final Fantasy Tactics is one of the most beloved SRPGs of all time, is strongly held up as the gold standard that still hasn't been met, and I can't remember ANYTHING even remotely resembling a stealth mechanic.  How about Anachronox?  What about every classic JRPG ever?   magic    Yeah, I think you'd get that it's actually a very high magic setting from some of the characters described.  The real trick was setting it up so that typical D&D-style world-changing spells don't really exist (ie: long range teleports or telepathy, permanent matter creation, etc.)   and social actions,    Ever played Baldur's Gate?  You know that BG2 still has fanboys raving about how it's the best game ever?  Please, tell me what trade offs you make in that dialogue system.  Because all I remember is competent writing and offering the player reasonable choices.   which involve tradeoffs betweebn the areas or a bland jack of all trades character.   We still disagree; you have not convinced me and I have obviously not convinced you.  Are you going to be civil or am I going to ignore  a hostile reply insulting me and telling me I'm doing it wrong?"

truegaming,3c57w1,gizayabasu,3,Sun Jul 5 10:15:39 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking about a magic system, for example.   Make base components.  Make these base components usable on their own (to minimize the time between getting components and gaining a vested interest in them).  Alternatively, make the base components and a usable basic-level synthesis of the components both obtainable early on. Determine at least two ways these components can interact with each other: fusion, linkage, ability trees, randomly-generated improvement and/or side benefit (either from the components or upon synthesis), repair/replacement (but generally avoid making a particular item's qualities have to go away forever through use, or else you get the Too Awesome to Use problem--unless you really liked Sticker Star's game feel that much), fusion/linkage interaction with a particular character (e.g. utilizing unique qualities of a character or allowing for team-play abilities), interaction with enemies (including a secondary EXP system--Pokemon EVs is a classic example of a hidden expert mechanic but it could be made accessible just by explaining it), and any interactions you might want to have with other magic/bonus systems. Limit the number of choices available at some early point.  If you want to remove the limitation in endgame/New Game Plus for entertaining exploration/game-breaking, fine--but far too many games get this one wrong and make it difficult for a starting gamer to want to commit to anything for fear of then failing to pick up on an ability motif they might like later on.  Make it so the player chooses their own limitations so you can turn that potential for remorse into replay value instead.  The most typical example is a job class system.  Choosing one or two occupations, elemental affinities, and/or player races/species all serve this end, but there are more inventive approaches as well.  If an RPG has time-based action elements, for example, you might make different pieces of equipment alter your movement physics--which could then make skills more or less viable to use in given situations.  Don't give your player the whole deck of cards--split the deck up and let them choose a pile based on the top card while assuring them that all the piles are fun and winnable. Only after you get all of this down should you think progression.  The two most tried-and-true methods are spacing out the location of skills/vital components, and spacing out pool resources.  With the former, you won't get to use Rocket Punch until you beat Giant Robot in level 5 (either he has the Rocket Punch parts or a single set of parts that could be used for either Rocket Punch or Jet Kick, but not both).  With the latter, Rocket Punch costs 10 rocket orbs to build, you find three rocket orbs per level, and you could build Rocket Punch as early as level 4; but you probably want some of those orbs for Boost Jump and Blast Shield so it'd make more sense to hold off until level 5 or 6 (but it's still the player's call).  Pool resources can apply to skill trees as well, but you'd better find a tasteful way to make those resources acquirable--that is, so the player has a solid understanding of when they'll be able to attain a given skill rather than have it tantalize them or remain behind a veil of mystery until right before they can get it.  (With the former, the player has no sense of control over their own advancement; with the latter, they have no sense of involvement in their advancement.)  Who remembers the skill spheres of Final Fantasy X fondly!? Play-test it.  A lot.  Make balances, add synergy bonuses and sacrifices, and make each conceivable combination fun for at least a small part of the population.  Consider your audience and find niches for them all.  Will you cater to the person willing to grind dozens or hundreds of hours to earn a ridiculous game-breaking combination?  Will there be a player-skill bonus available, like for those able to time inputs precisely or make quick assessments of a complex playing field?  Do you have a genuinely wide array of aesthetics available, and is each aesthetic type also fun to play in its own way?  See what successful game makers get right.  I personally never would have thought playing a tank could be fun in an MMORPG, but some players get a thrill out of that.  Find out why before you make a tank option yourself."
truegaming,3c57w1,retrotrinitygaming,3,Sun Jul 5 14:25:12 2015 UTC,"You could start off with four general classes: the brawler (melee), the knight (sword wielding), the mage (damage magic), and the healer (healing magic). Have these classes be the default classes, and have them unlock additional classes as you level them up.  For example, a character with level 10 mage and healer could unlock red mage (hybrid of damage of healing magic) or a level 10 brawler and healer could unlock monk (hybrid of melee attacks and healing). Perhaps have general leveling that unlock natural variations of these characters, like a dual-sword wielding class for leveling the knight or a buffer for leveling the healer. Pretty sure a system really similar to what I've described exists somewhere.  What I think this promotes is an easy start to the game. When you're just starting out an RPG, you want straightforward classes so you can go straight into it and not be intimidated by a large variety of classes. If you have like 5 different magic users to pick from, it's not all that accessible. Having a standard archetype for the starting classes makes it all the easier to pick up immediately.  Then, the classes grow in complexity as you dive into the game. Lots of games put buffs and debuffs right in the beginning, and that's really not the time to put it, since player typically don't see value in them until they get to the middle bosses or so. I mean, it's why Pokemon players always delete non-damaging moves in the beginning. Sure, Growl may not be that great in the beginning, but you realize later why Sword Attack is so good."
truegaming,3c57w1,gizayabasu,3,Sun Jul 5 03:13:05 2015 UTC,"You ever play Seiken Densetsu 3 (aka Secret of Mana 2)? You are mostly describing their system.  Unlike the free-for-all job/class/vocation systems you find in games like Final Fantasy V or some Dragon Quest titles, SD3 forces you to make irrevocable class-change decisions at key parts of the game (well, almost; technically you can ignore the class changes, but doing so is arguably suicidal).  For example, if you have the fighter Duran in your party, he starts off as a guy that can use swords and heavy armor, and can't do much else.  He gets once special ""tech"" (L1 tech) when makes him do a stronger-than-average sword swing.  If you take him down light path at the first change, he can heal people a bit and use shields.  If you take him down dark path, he gets stronger swords instead of shields, and he learns some magic to give (or a companion's) weapon elemental attack attributes.  The second class change offers options based on the first one.  You wind up with light/light, light/dark, dark/light, or dark/dark.  Each new class builds off the old one, so you never lose your old abilities.  The new class either adds new abilities or enhances old ones.  For example, dark/light (Swordmaster) gets you some more magic to provide weapons with elemental attributes, including spells that make weapons return HP or MP to the wielder based on the damage of the attack.  Dark/dark (Duelist) provides less of that kind of magic, but features even more-powerful swords and the most powerful L3 tech available to Duran (Eruption Sword).  By the end of the game, Duran will have four different playstyles, and each class change will add a degree of additional complexity to the character.  In the beginning, he was nothing more than an idiot who could swing a sword."

truegaming,3c57w1,retrotrinitygaming,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:01:46 2015 UTC,"It is forced since you hit stat caps if you do not upgrade to a new class (there are stat caps for all the classes, actually, but the stat caps for the 3rd-tier classes are high enough that they are generally not problematic).  Aside from that, it is a fun system.  New players are rewarded with a gameplay experience that feels unique to the playthrough.  It would have worked out better had they not made Kevin such an ""easy mode"" character and had magic's use been more compelling.  Kevin (as a Death Hand) can pull off dual 700+ HP strikes with his L1 tech (in the right kind of party, anyway) and suffer no negative consequences, while Angela can hit an enemy for 400+ HP with an L2 spell and eat counterattacks from common enemies in the late game (not to speak of bosses).  It's almost like the game punishes players for using damage spells.  Without the quick-casting bug, it would be insufferable."

truegaming,3c57w1,Love_Empathy,2,Sun Jul 5 10:03:35 2015 UTC,"2 popular examples I can think of are WoW and Pokemon.  Both do/did similar things:  The basic information about your character is just that -- basic.  Maybe Pikachu has 30 hit points and 2 attacks that do Lightning damage.  But if you look at the depth that goes on in pokemon games nowadays it's intense.  People are breeding pokemon in hopes of getting a better pokemon of the same type.  A large part of this, to my understanding, are hidden stats.  I'm not a very big fan of hidden stats, I want everything to be on the table.  But the one thing hidden stats do for your game is make it appear simple.    WoW did the same thing.  Basic character stats, but there was some heavy math involved in what the stats actually meant bottom line.  The few, the brave, the max dps charters were using simulations to cover RNG and calculating actual damage based on a simple stat like Strength or Armor Penetration vs a typical enemy."
truegaming,3c57w1,Love_Empathy,3,Mon Jul 6 00:10:50 2015 UTC,"I think it's all about clear, easy to understand tutorialization and making sure early decisions don't massively impact character development. Morrowind is a good example on how not to do this. The leveling system is logical and even makes some sense but the game doesn't explain it, and you make the most important 3 decisions for the first ~50 hours of character development in the first 5 minutes of the game. Skyrim tried to change this by removing agency from the player, which, granted, makes it easier, but also reduces the depth. A middle ground solution, at least for Elder Scrolls games, may be to break the 4th wall during the tutorial and have someone just plain tell you how the character system works. They tell you that you ""get better at stuff by doing it"", which is not a lie, but also not useful at all. It applies to all the games' character systems, even though they're very different from one another.  In general though I think a mixed system where you have attributes or some equivalent, passive skills and active skills would be best. Kinda Morrowind with perks. Fallout did this, but the gameplay of Fallout is shit, so it's not as fun as it could be. I also think perk systems in more action-oriented games do a good job of adding depth as the game goes along by adding to the players ""moveset"" rather than giving him a stat bonus. Shadow or Mordor and Deus Ex 3 come to mind."

Here's how I'm interpreting what you said: In typical a game, Persuasion, Deceit, and Intimidation would all be all tied to the dialogue mechanism. And you're suggesting that Persuasion, Deceit, and Intimidation should each have their own  unique mechanism.  It seems like a cool idea but this doesn't serve to make the character specialization system more approachable. The core issue that players need to make decisions about their character builds without sufficient knowledge is still not accounted for. You could argue that this is easier to understand, but ultimately you still end up with a bunch of different skills that the player must learn about."

Skyrim sort of does this, i think."
truegaming,3c57w1,SewenNewes,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:07:33 2015 UTC,"Easy way to make a system accessible to new players is to have a  way to respecialize a character, so the player can experiment with different stats and abilities as long as they like and not be locked into their choices.   Monster hunter is a good example of this: it has different weapon and armor choices with each offering different playstyle. You are given a starter weapon of each type at the start and switching from a longsword to a bow is just a matter of acquiring the materials for it with the weapon you already use."
truegaming,3c57w1,maico3010,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:38:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think an RPG system needs complexity in order to be deep, all it needs is enough depth and good enough balance between player choices to make interesting choices viable.  Can you make a hybrid character? A Bowbarian or Rogue Mage? If the best path is always to dump into your main stat or you main stat and survivability, there isn't a whole lot of depth there. You can create depth through break points: either stat requirements to use certain items or skills or soft caps and meeting certain requirements such as ""mana regen to sustain a spell indefinitely"".  The other way to add depth to builds and choices is to create situational tools. Situational abilities may allow players to adapt to certain challenges easier than others. A good example is have the player need to raise their defensive resists against a certain area's enemies.  The best RPG system imo, is when ""everything can work."""
truegaming,3c57w1,Redhavok,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:30:07 2015 UTC,"Being able to start broad and narrow in and refine a character is huge.  So many times I play a game and once I learn more about the game and how it works compared to other games I see there are choices I would have done differently.  For instance with Bloodborne I went into it knowing as little as possible to experience it new. Initially I invested heavily into the Arcane stat having enjoyed mage builds in the past Souls games while two friends were building dex and strength characters so we could see them all. It didn't take long before I realized Arcane was, not to say useless, but very much a secondary or even tertiary stat. Magic wasn't a stat or skill you could focus around in past games and was more of a utility style with the focus of stat points still needing to be in dex or strength. I was heavily invested in Arcane before I fully realized all of this and it made the game significantly harder through the early portions when my early levels were poured into useless stats as it is quite a ways into the game before you even get your first spell."
truegaming,3c57w1,Thousand_Eyes,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:34:17 2015 UTC,"One of these days someone is going to slap me and call me a fanboy, but I want to bring up the Souls series here. You start off with a class that specialises you at the start, but the stat differences are relatively minor so that relatively early on you can start focussing on a different thing, and the equipment differences get rectified before long as well - you pick up a variety of simple weapons in the early parts of the games, and their requirements are low enough that most players can at least swing the weapon around to see how it feels to them.    Another tactic is in newer Bethesda games like Oblivion, Skyrim, and Fallout 3: Introduce the character creation elements in phases, tying them in to the story and phasing the new gameplay elements in over the tutorial/introduction. When you get to the end, it asks you if you wanted to change anything before you enter the ""real game"", just to make sure the player isn't locked in. It's not the most elegant solution, and it's pretty obvious to the player what's happening, but it's definitely a much clearer system than most."
truegaming,3c57w1,pRopaaNS,2,Sun Jul 5 08:33:10 2015 UTC,The stat requirements on equipment and spells is the best part of the souls series because it gives you a clear goal when leveling your character. You want to use that weapon you need at least 18 DEX. You want to use that spell you need at least 32 INT. It helps you get an idea of what you'll be able to build towards and what you'll have to sacrifice. If you want to use an end game spell with a high INT requirements you're going to have sacrifice in other stats to hit that requirement.
truegaming,3c57w1,LeVentNoir,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:44:11 2015 UTC,"The key is to make the players learning of the game and the players character learning as separate things.  Eve online does this quite well by having an in depth skill system that trains even when your offline. This separates the skills from the player a little allowing them to do anything without regard to their skills training slower or faster because of quests/grinding or what ever most RPGs have.  Meanwhile actually understanding the concepts the player will face is complicated. A player might have to actually do some research to find out why in the middle of no where space someone found them and blew them up. Or some poor soul in high security space who got ganked. How did these happen? New players have to do research to find out.  This means even if a player had a fully trained character they would still find them on the short end of the stick in both scenarios because the actual player didn't know about scanning or combat probes, or didn't fully understand the concepts of high security space.   Break this down further and ship combat can get ridiculous, hell even trade can be highly cut throat. Sling shot maneuvers, drugs, links, thousands of modules to fit to ships, understanding the directional scanner, difference between warp scamblers and warp disruptors all these things make a massive difference if you the player have the personal skill to use them while your characters skills just allow you to put them on your ship.  The point here again is to give depth to the activities that your players are doing so that regardless of their characters skill they can still mess up or do something amazing when faced with opposite odds. I've seen a vet of 10 years lose a 650 million isk ship to a 1 day old newbie who understood his 500k isk ship could hold that 650m isk ship long enough for his new friends to come and blow up that guys ship.  You further this not by limiting players, but by unlimiting them. Give them a broad view of things that the player can do and specialize in, but they can stop that specialization and focus on something else as well if they please.   Again using eve as an example, there are hundreds of skills, some take 30 minutes, some take over a month. Obviously those that take 30 minutes are low in level and in skill training time where as the skills that take weeks or months allow players to specialize if they don't mind putting in that time. Since every skill ends at level 5 any player can quickly focus and put themselves on par with a player who has been around since the game came out. However the long train times of getting a skill to level 5 might deter individuals from specalizing that hard and go for a jack of all trades approach getting many skills to 3 or 4 which take a fraction of the time.  Finally, the absolute best way to explain this depth and complexity both in the skill system and in the skills you as a player need to have to survive (longer) is to have a community that can't let it go. Nothing is better then having an experienced player on your side helping you. That 1 day old character I talked about earlier dove head first into the game asking questions and was quickly picked up by one of the in game communities. Without that push he likely might not have gone into low or null security space and gotten in on those kills. However with the power of the community he learned not only could he be a part of something larger, but he can do it with less than 24 hours on his account.  No wiki page or about page will be able to give the support and knowledge base of a knowledgeable player who is willing to help."

It's certainly a positive if a game makes you want to come back. Whether it's story-based (playing Bioshock to see the next level/part of the story) or mechanics (playing Diablo to find more loot), it's satisfying to know you bought something that will keep you entertained for several hours each day. Not many forms of entertainment can do that.  Obviously reviews aren't talking about the really harmful kind of addiction, which usually comes from those ""endless"" games like MMOs. That can potentially be as debilitating as substance abuse, especially if it puts strain on social relationships, work, and other responsibilities.  It's like when people describe themselves as a ""chocoholic"" or something. Being an alcoholic is terrible, but all they mean is that they like to eat a lot of chocolate and they enjoy it. When games are addictive, it just means we have fun playing them and like to come back for more - not a bad thing at all. I guess it could be considered hyperbole."

Especially so because I usually have no problem with arcadey games, which are more likely do be described in such hyperbolic terms."
truegaming,3c3qni,anecdotal,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:34:54 2015 UTC,"I don't have strong feelings one way or another, but I just wanted to say that I too have thought of this lately.  I recently saw a gaming video that really used ""addictive"" as a big selling point.  Now, I probably have experienced gaming addiction, but it's never gotten to a really destructive point in my life personally.  But it wasn't until I experienced how terrible addiction can be to, uh, other things, that hearing that sort of made me pause and think.  Is addictiveness a positive quality of gaming?  Well yeah, it means the game is awesome and compelling.  But opiates are also awesome, and thus, addicting.   I guess it just comes down to your overall political ideas.  Are you more libertarian or do you think drugs should be heavily regulated?  Game devs have a responsibility to make the best, most addicting game possible.  They have the same mandate as a drug dealer on a certain level, but again, are drug dealers bad people?    Good topic."
truegaming,3c3qni,TheCodeJanitor,3,Sun Jul 5 04:34:30 2015 UTC,"It's not as destructive, but it's still destructive in it's own way. Think of games like Civ (or, for me recently Cities: Skylines). People frequently joke and praise their ability to make time pass. It's relatively okay to lose sleep one night, but make it a habit and it becomes destructive quickly.    Imagine saying ""Oh man, I had a beer last night at 10 and next thing I knew it was 2am. Then I decided to just have one more and then the sun started coming up."""
truegaming,3c3qni,Jattopotamus,43,Sun Jul 5 00:24:47 2015 UTC,"Overuse of the word 'addictive', especially in the context of gaming, has probably led to it being disassociated from actual addiction.    It's good to see psychologists looking into what is happening to our brains under these circumstances. I remember reading some articles a couple of months back that talked about porn and video game addiction, to which I would say; I have no doubt my brain is altered by these things. Especially gaming; I can posit that gaming helped my problem solving skills and probably other, subtler effects I don't notice like the way I mentally categorise things.    So video games can already be seen as a tool.    I think in the coming years, with gaming and the community surrounding it having gotten so big, all these mental issues will probably be highlighted. I wouldn't be surprised to find out a high percentage of gamers suffered from depression, anxiety, addictions, etc. So I'm imagining tournaments with some proceeds going to different awareness groups, things like that.    I said earlier that video games can be seen as tools. And you're probably familiar with the idea of an 'addictive personality'. I think if we were to notice in a child of young age that they have addictive tendencies we could use video games as a way to also teach how to limit yourself with the hope that this benefit could translate into the rest of your life especially dealing with alcohol, gambling and drugs."
truegaming,3c3qni,thethirdman081,10,Sat Jul 4 17:35:09 2015 UTC,"With regards to addiction, people can also throw themselves into games as a distraction from real life, for the same reasons that people sometimes start drinking too much or overdoing the drugs.  I remember an article on Eurogamer (can't find it to link)  about a guy who had split up with his girlfriend and then spent his entire evenings playing games and it was only after a few months he finally started to question his behaviour, realised there was something seriously wrong and went to seek help (He ended up diagnosed with depression I think?).  I'm not sure if this comment was really on topic, but I really do worry about people who spend that much time gaming. Don't get me wrong, I love gaming and have been doing it since 1986, but if one of my friends started spending all his time playing games, I would seriously sit him down for a pint and ask him if anything was up."
truegaming,3c3qni,V170,9,Sat Jul 4 17:31:14 2015 UTC,How about normal multiplayer addiction? Is that a thing?   I'm thinking something like fighting games or starcraft where the only real incentive to keep playing is to get better.
truegaming,3c3qni,themaincop,8,Sat Jul 4 18:10:05 2015 UTC,"Those are the games that I get hooked on (CS, Dota, TF2).  I think the fulfill my need to compete.  If I could I would probably play hockey every single day as well but that costs a fortune.  Video games are a nice easy way to compete against someone.  I think the rise in ranked matchmaking shows there's definitely a big market for that.  I think ranks also have the possibility to add a Skinner box element though, except with less luck.  I definitely played Dota long after I stopped having fun to try to get my MMR up."
truegaming,3c3qni,V170,4,Sat Jul 4 18:49:07 2015 UTC,"That's a really good point, the ladder is a huge incentive.   Although there are a few exceptions where that isn't present like in Smashbros."
truegaming,3c3qni,themaincop,3,Sat Jul 4 19:19:26 2015 UTC,"The ladder can also be a big disincentive.  I went on a big losing streak in Dota last fall and then basically quit playing out of frustration.  Seeing that number go down was a big aspect in that.  I like the way counter strike ranks are fuzzy, each individual game feels less stressful."
truegaming,3c3qni,ebildemon,3,Sat Jul 4 20:39:24 2015 UTC,"Multiplayer games are very similar to sports. There is an endorphine kick with getting better and improving their skills.   Of course there is also the 'practice' mentality in sports where they don't get as much pleasure from games, and instead use their discipline to play more and more, getting better. In this case, they are not playing bvecause they are addicted, they are playing because they are 'driven' to a certain goal."
truegaming,3c3qni,__david__,15,Sun Jul 5 02:21:45 2015 UTC,"I think the video game community should be a little more careful to talk about what they mean when they use the simple word ""addictive"", because it really is something that ruins lives.   I disagree here. The watered down version of the term 'addiction' is not a product of the video game community. Pretty much every type of game or entertainment activity in existence has been called 'addictive' by people who enjoy it. Sports, board games, card games, puzzles of all kinds have been called 'addictive'. My dictionary has this as the 2nd definition of addict:   [ with modifier ] informal an enthusiastic devotee of a specified thing or activity: a must-buy book for the crossword-puzzle addict | a self-confessed chocolate addict.   Is it hyperbolic? I don't think so—it's just the way language works. Fun fact 'tremendous' used to mean ""very, very bad"". Enough people were using it ironically that the definition changed. It's usually perfectly clear from the context whether someone is using the 2nd definition vs the clinical definition."
truegaming,3c3qni,KoboldCommando,11,Sat Jul 4 18:20:41 2015 UTC,"The issue here is that clinical and scientific terms have very specific and unchanging definitions, that's what makes them useful in a clinical or scientific setting, where ambiguity will not fly.  And what makes it bad is that it's not always clear when someone's using the formal definition of the word, or using it casually/incorrectly.  A very classic and well-known case of this problem is ""theory"", which has a very clear and definite meaning formally, but informal speech came to mean any half-formed idea, and people turned this definition around to attack actual theories.  You see the same thing with a large number of psychological terms, with people claiming that they have depression, anxiety disorders, OCD, and addiction, when in reality they have the blues, normal worries, no compulsive symptoms, and a simple strong interest in something."
truegaming,3c3qni,BlinksTale,6,Sun Jul 5 02:02:00 2015 UTC,"I make mobile games for a living, and the last company I worked for loved thus word. They wanted players hooked on it, but then also wanted to still have some morals about it, so I redirected them to the word ""engaging"". We made a couple games like Flappy Bird that really got players focused and had quick rewards, but wasn't a long term investment.  I could never make a game like Clash of Clans where I still played it long after I spotted enjoying it and wanted to stop. I am fine however with keeping someone distracted for a few minutes from the real world. Maybe it's just how much of a time investment it is?"

truegaming,3c3qni,EdEmKay,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:38:50 2015 UTC,"but it's that simplicity which leads to a kind of addiction far deeper than any other game. the game isn't simple, the mechanics are. in no other game would i be losing weeks of sleep because i'm obsessively recreating the entirety of City 17 in block form, or trying to map out Africa to scale. to say that minecraft isn't ""deep enough to take play session length, replayability, and exit points into account"" is kinda absurd to me."
truegaming,3c3qni,uristMcBadRAM,3,Sun Jul 5 00:34:48 2015 UTC,"sorry, that was a bit vague of me. I was looking at if from a designer perspective, and stating that most of what minecraft has the makes it ""addicting"" was added to the game based on its own merit, and no attempt was made by notch to make the game ""addicting"" for profit. an excellent contrast to this is any skinner box mobile game, where energy systems prevent you from progressing too fast, and try to force you into a routine of playing the game frequently, with the intention of making the game harder to leave. minecraft has no such features. I wasnt trying to imply that minecraft lacked depth, rather that it wasnt designed with ""addiction"" in mind."
truegaming,3c3qni,spriteguard,2,Sun Jul 5 02:12:42 2015 UTC,"It depends. Were you playing normal or creative mode? Normal mode is absolutely a skinner box with how you find and gather resources, but in creative mode it's more of a substitute-gratification thing that wasn't really covered.  I do think substitute gratification is a really serious and dangerous part of video game addiction.

truegaming,3c3qni,iketelic,3,Sun Jul 5 09:14:09 2015 UTC,"Freemium Style Addiction: This is widely considered to be ""the bad stuff"". Games that are made with psychologists in tow to analyze behavior and get the ""whales"", who are addicts, to take out a second mortgage and use their children's college savings to get their town up to the next level or so. In many of the games, the ramping up they do of rewards and XP are almost blatantly to get more impulsive people to spend way more than they should. The /r/games type hardcore community hates these games with a passion.   Someone who is that sloppy with his money isn't going to keep a credit card for long no matter what. Others can genuinely afford it. No matter the case, I think we should stop telling other people how to spend their money. If you want to spend money on Clash of Clans, go right ahead and don't feel bad about making your own decisions. Let others play (and pay) the games they like and you the games you like.  It's the same thing with Beats headphones and other popular things that most of reddit dislikes.

truegaming,3c3qni,Identitools,3,Sun Jul 5 17:31:05 2015 UTC,"Former MDPV addict here. The ""addictiveness"" can be a ""good thing"" in the mind of the addict, you know... me and friends of mine, after being clean for years are ""nostalgics"" not of the ""stuff"" but on the ""addict state"" they can put us into. You should see the addictiveness as a sort of ""passionate adventure"". Yay... in some way you can crave more the side effects. That's why you will see some game reviews where the game is depicted as addictive and therefore ""good"", without irony.  If a game can be addictive, and they can, they can also in that way make you dream, you dream about it, you think about it the time you don't play it and you just want it. Not because this game is ""so much good"", but because you are becoming a grinder, you mindless grind and this let you make something of your time. Something that are not stressfull. Something easy.  If you life is empty, you are screwed. No matter ""how strong"" the stuff/game/habit are.  Also, this is a passion, we can't deny it and literally anything can be addictive, and the fear of the addictiveness do not let us flee games. This would be stupid (or very smart). Look at all the hype Fallout 4 got, the incredible universe the fallout games gave us. I can spend hours looking at lore of my favorite games.

truegaming,3c3qni,dexa_scantron,2,Sat Jul 4 19:57:01 2015 UTC,"I think that when people say a game is 'addictive', they mean it fulfills a need they have. The question is: is the need a healthy one or an unhealthy one? Did the game create the need?  For example: most good games fulfill players' needs to feel competent and have autonomy, or to connect with a story or characters. Those are healthy needs and the good games fulfill them in a healthy way.  But free-to-play casino games create a compulsion to gamble, and then they fill that need. The need to gamble and occasionally win big (but not enough to offset your losses) isn't a healthy need, and most of these games don't fulfill it in a healthy way. They're creating or enhancing a need that wasn't really there in the first place, and using that need to get people to pay.  I've heard people in the industry define the former type of 'addition' as 'needs fulfillment' and the latter type as 'compulsion'. This is definitely something that gets talked about, and studied extensively.  Check out Immersyve's research; they've done a lot of research into what makes a game addictive in the 'good' way, and they've worked as consultants on games like Arkham City, Destiny, and Shadow of Mordor."

Some players may be more prone to addictive behavior but I feel it's always taboo to criticize video games as possible venues for addiction and people wouldn't compare it to 'real' addictions like drugs or gambling (direct impact on physical health or financial strain), even these can be habit forming in the long run."

truegaming,3c3qni,EyeMeetsEye,2,Sat Jul 4 20:14:30 2015 UTC,"I've got two stories about ""addiction"" I guess. My one good friend failed out of college due to letting Diablo 2 take priority over going to class and doing school work. He looks back now and really regrets the freedom from being away from home take too much of an advantage and alter his career path. Not addiction per say, but video games definitely played an important part in his life.   As for me, I've had 2 instances of sort of addiction. After I got high speed Internet at home, I played Call of Duty 4 nonstop all summer, where I'd come home from football practice and not do anything else or even see my friends, though we did play online together. That ended when school started though. In college, there was probably a solid 2.5 year period where I'd take spending my weekend time playing League of Legends instead of going out with my friends on the weekend. However, I think the problem was exacerbated because I was playing with up to 4 other guys I went to school with, so we all sort of enabled each other. Our other friends/fraternity brothers would all make fun of us because we would literally do that all of the time we weren't in class we would either play across campus or go to each other rooms.   Now, I graduated and live alone, so I come home and play, sleep and repeat. And this is because I don't know anyone who where I live and my friends are only available on weekends.   So, not completely on topic, but I thought I'd share my different experiences dealing with playing too much video games and ""addiction."""
truegaming,3c3qni,BeriAlpha,2,Sun Jul 5 00:32:36 2015 UTC,"Some confusion comes from misusing the word 'addiction.' We throw it around too carelessly, the same way someone goes 'oh, I'm so OCD' when they keep their lipstick arranged by color. Interest and engagement in a game is one thing, exploiting psychology to entice players to make decisions that are detrimental to their social lives and financial well-being is another."
truegaming,3c3qni,toothblanket,2,Sun Jul 5 00:36:35 2015 UTC,"Former WoW addict here, it can definitely be self destructive. I think gaming can fall under the same  level of addictiveness as most hobbies but the problem is some developers deliberately make their games have content that isnt very challenging, easily repeatable and offers some form of reward. I played WoW heavily from Burning Crusade to the end of Wrath of the Lich King. I mean, I never missed a months subscription between those two points in time. It was a fucked up time for me. I didnt graduate from highschool I became distant from my family and my friends and if I wasnt talking about WoW in real life I wasnt really intersted in talking. I would think to myself that while I played I was developing some legitimate skills like performing in a raid was teaching me how to perform well with a team or that farming was making me good at being patient a working towards a goal (I had never even had a job at this point). Its all nonsense, it might be a little bit true for some aspects of the game, like being a guild leader can help you a bit in learning how to manage people and schedules but it was all horseshit that I was making up to justify playing the game.   Since ive kinda stopped playing the game. I currently have a job and im trying to develop other interests and be social. A big problem with that particular game is the players themselves are so okay with how exploitative the game is. If you complain about how something is structured, or how its a massive time sink you'll probably be criticized for either not being good enough to play the game, or its Blizzard's game and if you dont like it get out. I mean, that last one is absolutely true but I think people that put up with it have some emotional issues going on that they dont want to deal with, I mean some people request for Blizzard to add more daily quests into the game (repeatable content for some virtual currency) I cant understand this. I actually have played the current expansion, Warlords of Draenor but I had a rule where if I wasnt having legitimate fun I was going to stop playing the game and honestly there isnt much game to play if thats your objective.  also why are you guys arguing over the literal definition of addiction"
truegaming,3c3qni,ManByNature,2,Sun Jul 5 04:15:43 2015 UTC,"Usually, when people refer to a game being addicting, they are referring to a game that is really enjoyable and that one can get invested in and have time go by, but not in a destructive manner. It's not just used on video games. You ever hear someone say ""Man, these potato chips are addicting.""? It's similar to that. It's a light addictiveness that is at a point where it cannot cause harm.  However, video game addiction is a real dangerous and serious thing. It ruins families, destroys careers, and has even led to suicides and murder. This is not to say ""VIDEO GAMES ARE EVIL!"", but the reason we see this behavior with video games and not movies is because video games reward the player's brain with a sense of accomplishment. Someone with depression may use video games to give themselves that feeling of reward. To achieve this reward, one has to invest time in the game so it is like putting ""work"" into something and because of that, the feeling of achievement can be even greater than say drugs or foods, both which provide instant ""reward."" And because it takes a long time to beat a game (or never, in the case of WoW where there are an  almost infinite number of quests to do), this addiction is almost as an unhealthy as a drug addiction. While a druggie needs to keep getting a fix over and over because of their chemical addiction, a video game addiction detiorates the body much slower, obviously. Both have the capacity to destroy lives and addicts of both should undergo some sort of rehabilitation and seek family or community support, making it very important that people take these kind of things seriously and NOT shouting ""Nonsense!"" when one goes for help with these kind of things."
truegaming,3c3qni,Caelamid,2,Sun Jul 5 05:45:01 2015 UTC,"All of those examples of ""addictive"" are valid. I think we need to remember that words can mean different things depending on context.  Or, alternatively, each of the described mechanisms inspires addiction, but only when one is addicted is it harmful. In that way we don't have to try and castrate an innocent word, and can still differentiate between the harmful neurotic behavior and the tendency of certain modes of play to incite a desire for more play."
truegaming,3c3qni,want_to_want,2,Sun Jul 5 06:23:43 2015 UTC,"The want/like distinction is relevant here. A person can enjoy something without craving it (e.g. creating art), and crave something without enjoying it (e.g. eating chips after you've eaten the first one). These two are literally different mechanisms in the brain! The ""like"" mechanism rewards you for doing something new and interesting, and the ""want"" mechanism makes you continue doing something that has yielded a reward before. Nature doesn't guarantee you that ""want"" will lead to ""like"" or vice versa.  A good game tries to give you enjoyment most of the time, and craving is a side effect of that. On the other hand, a bad game just tries to directly create craving, it doesn't care about enjoyment and only gives you small scraps at longer and longer intervals (Skinner box).  The same thing also happens with drugs. For example, LSD is a lot of fun, but not really addictive - you can try it, have a blast, and then go for years without wanting to try again. On the other hand, smokers don't seem to get a lot of enjoyment from cigarettes, but they keep smoking because they would feel miserable otherwise. Most drugs are somewhere in between.  Understanding the want/like distinction has literally changed my life. Now I see some structure behind my desires, and can make a more informed choice whether I want to keep some habit or not."
truegaming,3c3qni,willza99,3,Sun Jul 5 07:43:56 2015 UTC,"Okay so I'm going to respond to this as I read it.  First off you say that addiction is rising. Is there actually any evidence for that or is it just a misconception because 1 dude died in Korea from not sleeping for like 2 days and people spend a fair bit of money on it. People in the media might bring it up more, but with the automation of so many tasks in our lives and the useful gaps that technology fills I wouldn't be surprised if people quite jadedly called all this addiction. People weren't more sociable or anything before hand, we just have technology now, and we use it to keep ourselves in contact with others or entertained. Addiction is framed as something which you NEED to do to function, I reckon many would jokingly say that couldn't live without their phones but really we all know we could, it'd just be less enjoyable because we entertain ourselves so much with like Youtube & Netflix.   The bit where you talk about casual addiction, quite frankly I just see that as enjoyable immersion which you don't want to end. What about when people are reading a book and read an extra few chapters? Surely that's a direct parallel with playing an extra level? That's just indulgence, we do that with EVERYTHING from food to entertainment to even lifestyle. I agree that the use of the word addiction in this category is wrong, so I'm not entirely sure why you used it given you too think it's wrong and seem to think 'compelling' would fit instead.  With your Skinner category, which as a side note I'm not sure what that means, you define a very specific type of game that requires a subscription service to that game, but then you go and break that defintion by saying you're just adding in FPS games in there too. That breaks this topology you've created. The only thing these all have in common is they're multiplayer and have a heavy to light RPG element of leveling up. You talk about people losing their jobs but honestly I never heard or still hear about this so I doubt it's prevalent if true (you didn't cite anything so I can't be sure). Also you say there's no ending but Diablo has one, borderlands too, I mean are we talking content here? because there's a finite amount of content in any game, even a procedurally generated game can only generate so many patterns. So I reject the notion that there's no end, because as with all games both video and in real life - you can replay them again and again if you so wish - does that then not count as addiction? If I know somone who plays hide and seek 10 times a day is that addiction? And in the case of WoW what about all the content (which once again is finite) that is deemed 'Endgame' does that not mean that once you've done all those quests, you've finished? you're done? You've the best equipment and done all the quests, thats and ending, but like with any game, once again you can replay if you wish. I see nothing wrong with these games, some people enjoy them some dont', I've spent my time with all the ones you've mentioned and enjoyed them to different degrees as did my friends. Also where do pro players fit into this? I'm sure they play games more than anyone, just because they're getting paid it doesn't count as addiction? What if you count cards at blackjack and win most the time? is that then also not addiction because you're gaining from it?  So with freemium games, straight off the bat you make a huge generalisation about the people who pay money towards these games with no citation, either that's a lie or a handful of people out of the entire game population actually did anything anywhere near egregious as what you just stated.   Wrapping up your taxonomy you state what you feel the factors of addiction are.   First of all playful - nearly everything is playful, dogs play, children play, play is part of what games are and games can be seen to be part of what play is. Play is heavily researched, look up someone like John Huizinga who is accredited as the grandfather of play with his 'Homoludens' literature. A dark period of your life can easily be seen as stigma, that's judgemental who is anyone to say that just because someone plays X hours of a game that it's somehow a dark period of their life, one they don't enjoy necessarily - if you're using games as a scapegoat from dealing with ACTUAL issues then there is a problem, but what you described is just judgmental. Truly exploitative is an immoral thing to do certainly, but casinos do it, betting agencies do it and they're not outlawed, why? Because you can't give people a life you think they should live, if someone can't handle betting or playing games the people who make the game aren't responsible, because why should you be responsible for someone whose impulsive and reckless? No if you make the decision to play a game for 50 hours, YOU made that decision, no one else.   I feel this taxonomy is very flawed and no where near scientific enough to be upheld and I'll be damned if actually get's taken under the wing of the larger community. Addiciton has been researched and defined in the past and games have been researched along side them, and the trend is that they're not addictive because they don't cause harm, betting causes harm, drinking does, drugs do, games don't. What about differing gaming experiences, what about immersion, what about the HUGE landscape that games cover, what about non-video games, what about just general things that are parallels, what about subjectivity these don't come into this taxonomy, you've just made a list of everything that is bad in your eyes, rarely are things decisively bad. What about the games you've deemed as bad yet provide good? People who play certain games are recruited for things like the army and surgery because of the hand-eye coordination, problem solving skills and provoking different patterns of thought from tactical second to second and strategical. WHat about just generally good design? People enjoy games when there is feedback, so leveling up is a clear indiction of becoming better and it's validation that the player is getting better - this is a tool used, either morally or immorally but you can't say the tool itself is evil, that's wrong. Finally what about just general language hyperbole and fluidity? Saying addiction when meaning engagement, using the word addiction so much it changes it's meaning in the given context? THis happens with language all the time look at how people describe things ""Wicked/sick/gay/awesome"" none of those words are used in the correct original context, language changes."
truegaming,3c3qni,Anon_Amous,2,Mon Jul 6 07:09:36 2015 UTC,"The problem I have with throwing around the term addiction is that psychological and physiological addictions aren't the same... You can't be physiologically addicted to games, or the internet, or basketball. You can be psychologically addicted, but there is no fundamental chemical addiction process that's involved.  To me, it seems really, really ridiculous to compare really liking games to somebody who is addicted to heroin, the latter has a much more difficult problem and they shouldn't be equated in my opinion. There should be an emphasis on the distinction in my opinion."
truegaming,3c3qni,ithinkineedanap,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:13:04 2015 UTC,"Addiction is simply continuing to engage in destructive behavior despite the negative consequences.   Often, these consequences include relationship or career issues, financial issues, or with substances at the very least include health issues.   I mean it could be weed, where if you're constantly showing up to jobs late because you want to smoke a joint in the morning, and it costs you jobs, if that leads to relationship issues etc, and you don't change that behavior and continue to make a morning joint a priority, that's an addiction. It doesn't have to be physical. You don't have to be some meth'd out junkie that leaves a baby in a bus stop bathroom or some drunk that beats his wife or has multiple DUIs to be an addict.   With gaming, if you're someone that does so many late night or all night sessions that eventually it costs you a job, and you don't try to address that behavior, that's an addiction. There was a direct negative consequence to your behavior and in spite of that you are continuing with that destructive behavior.   Whether one given addiction is worse or generally harder to overcome or not is not relevant to any given example. Simply because kicking heroin is harder than a gaming addiction doesn't make the latter less relevant for someone who has that problem."

Doing it to the point you lose your job or affect your relationships and continue engaging in that behavior is what makes it an addiction, not bad time management."

This is what I have a problem with. Nobody should be saying they probably need more immediate attention. They absolutely need more attention because it's a much more severe issue that has physical ramifications that are guaranteed.   People can be psychologically addicted to literally anything."

They are not particularly different, I urge you to read up on the topic if you are interested or think I am wrong.  The attention that addicts receive is based less on the type of addiction than it is the individual's response, which is more variable.  I think you'd have a hard time telling a hardcore heroin addict from a hardcore cocaine addict if we were just basing it on severity of symptoms.

We can call ""regular"" addictiveness ""bonaddictive,"" the Skinner Box one ""granaddictive,"" and the bad one ""maladdictive.""  And now that my sarcasm is past, let me be frank: oversensitivity is literally killing me and if we're going to get our collective panties in a bunch over the usage of the word ""addictive""  we might as well just cast ourselves into the fucking sea because we have clearly passed the point where we can survive in a unfeeling, unsympathetic universe.  NO, I do NOT think that the video game community should be more careful about using the word addictive.  The word ""addictive,"" just like many many other words, has several meanings.  Should we be careful when we say something like ""there graphics are poor"" because millions suffer and die in poverty?  Should we selfcensor ""the storyline was bad"" because bad things happen to people all the time?  Personally I feel that every video game character with two legs is a slap in the face because I know a guy in a wheelchair, does that make sense?  You're creating and seeing issues where they don't exist.  Everything can ruin lives, everything can kill people.  Do you know how many people have died in bath tubs?  Should we stop putting bath tubs in video games?  Watch our words when we talk about bathrooms?  I'm not even kidding, this is the road you are going down.  Your point about varying degrees of addiction is a point, barely.  Yes, the word addiction can mean many things, and without additional adjectives and descriptors you might confuse Tetris with heroin, but let's be honest here, you'd have to be fucking stupid to make that mistake.  And sure, there might not be any difference between Tetris and heroin for some people, but to advocate a change in how language is used to cater to the feelings of a tiny portion of the population is absurd.    Had you not ended your post with such an insane comment I think we could all have had an interesting discussion about this but I unequivocally disagree with your point and will be damned if I'll contribute to this madness any further."

The skinner box types of games are exploitation the same way bad cliffhanger tv are. So if you're into that, knock yourself out. You'll get behind it eventually.  When it's the real deal it's difficult. You tread the fine line between taking the addicts basic rights of self determination away or letting him suffer from his addiction.  Although, it's probably the cheapest kind of addiction there is, if there aren't gambling costs involved. As such, some addict shutin isn't really a problem for society besides him not participating. It's a burden on the family but not much more. I certainly don't have the association of being addicted to video games like I have one with being addicted to hard drugs or alcohol. I.e. possibly criminal, clouded judgement, incapable of making decisions because the brain chemistry is all over the place.  So I don't think video game addiction is really that big of a problem. I'd point to other factors instead when someone chooses freely to rather spend their time exclusivly on some boring shitty repetitive game than going outside or do something else.  Even the people literally dying from dehydration only make the news because they happen to have been playing something excessively and were stupid about it. Lots of people are stupid though or get into accidents. Not really connected with video games imo."

My dorm mates and I would play it over lan and the constant dopamine pops from the loot drops, level ups and constant feeling of progress actually caused disassociation from our bodies.   We didn't ""forget to eat,"" we didn't feel hunger. We didn't feel thirst. We didn't feel the need to pee until it was PAIN. We lost 8-10 hour blocks of time.

Not repetitive actions over and over, even if it does cause you to get better at game mechanics.  An example of how it can be done right is Dark Souls.  I am pretty addicted to dark souls right now... It can be very exceedingly repetitive but it feels like more than just a grind due to the challenging mechanics.  Dark souls has both a game level and personal skill requirement to progress.  There are a lot of games that only let you progress by spending a lot of time, but it isn't rewarding except for the limited progress you make.  Dark souls is rewarding because every time you fail you come back better and with more resolve to finish the task."

It may be neutrally harmful to the body due to inactivity, but inactivity is entirely different from harmful activity.  In modern society where we have yet to come together about socially destructive systems, attitudes, and cultures, video game addiction is a way to repress depression, anxiety, social inadequacy, etc. It works wonderfully when a game is incredibly addicting. As I mentioned a while ago on Reddit, 7 Days to Die had me forgetting to get drunk. I was drinking, but I was so on edge in the game and so strung along by the intensity and progress, I was about to pass out when I look over and see I poured myself a glass of wine(boxed, mind you) hours earlier, and I totally forgot about it. The box was right next to me. When a game addiction can overcome physical and chemical addiction, there's a serious, serious problem. wink"

You have a few grinder games like dungeon crawlers that are less about story and more about gameplay and thrillseeking, but at least for me the honeymoon ends after a while and the gamble loses its appeal. Probably because eventually you either loot the best in slot items or you get enough less valuable items to trade up. In that sense, there's still an end. The most problematic genre is probably the MMO. They're designed to never end with a seemingly endless stream of new content, updates, and expansions, multiple classes/races, opposing factions, and pvp. First person shooters also come to mind."

Far Cry 2 leaked by hackers.  Next gen consoles? Those code names (Orbis, Durango) aren't leaked on purpose. That's a pretty poor marketing ploy.  Dont forget all the crazy incidents of games or game information being leaked because of silly website mistakes. From domain name WHOIS to source code comments to obvious hosting mistakes too innocent to be marketing ploys (see Marvel vs Capcom 3)  Hell, I almost accidentally leaked a game before it was confirmed. The employer mentioned it so nonchalantly in an interview, I hadnt technically signed NDA documents yet, I got an offer and I was certain the game had been announced. It wasn't. And I got called out by a producer on the project for a friend's tweet who mentioned my name in it. That was most certainly not a marketing effort.  And none of this is counting cancelled game leaks. There are so many development-canned games that also get leaked that legally are not allowed to be uttered by name in the light of day and there sometimes are entire videos of concept gameplay that get dropped.

I'm admittedly biased, but I don't think leaking info from a beta or survey is nearly as bad as breaking into a building and gaining info that you were never meant to see.  As for an actual insider/employee leaking info that people personally trusted them to keep secret...well, I'm undecided.

Situation 1: you're not ready to tell everyone yet, but you decide to share it with a close friend, letting him know that you're trying to keep it secret until the details are finalized and figured out. But -- oops -- the friend slips up, either intentionally or unintentionally, and lets the cat out of the bag on a public social networking site.  Situation 2: someone (friend or not) sneaks into your house, finds the paperwork or your diary, learns the news, and then posts about it for everyone to see.  There's a pretty enormous difference between the two. Both are certainly ""wrong"" in a moralistic way, but the first represents a breach of degrees of freely-given trust, while the second represents a spontaneous victimization that removes any choice or power from the situation.  For a more somber and emotionally heavy analogy, leaking under NDA is like copping a feel when you've only been okayed to kiss and hug. Breaking in is outright rape. Both wrong and reprehensible, but one much more grievously than the other."
truegaming,3c0tdu,worldbuildingvsconte,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:35:53 2015 UTC,"I agree that the factors involved are different as you say, but I wouldn't call one situation strictly worse than the other, and the analogy used here makes the ambiguity less clear. Analogies are a double edged sword.  Say situation 2 is instead that I left an email open on my computer talking to someone in Alaska about renting a place there for a year, with this clearly stated in the subject line.  I've got to the toilet, while someone wanders by and thinks. ""Hey, whose computer is this? Oh, it's /u/ritchiethai ! I like the drawings he does. What, Alaska? Is he moving there?"" And then this person moves along.  This person tells some people that they think I'm moving to Alaska and everyone gets all worked up about it. But I don't know this person that well and never told them to keep it a secret. They just happened to notice the unlocked laptop and had a glance at the email. This person shouldn't have been looking at my email in the first place, but we also had no personal relationship of trust being broken, and I was going to tell people about it some time anyway.  On the other hand, I tell close personal friend about it and say to keep it a secret. If my friend tells people anyway, I would feel wronged and displeased at this breach of trust.  Analogies can be argued all different ways, but the trespassing in the actual game case wasn't quite a home break in looking at paperwork and reading personal diaries. This person walked in behind someone else, called tailgating in physical security terms, and just hung out and overheard some people talking. Maybe someone passing by and reading my email undersells it, but this also wasn't a particularly sophisticated break in or mission to retrieve company secrets."
truegaming,3c0tdu,ilovecreamsoda,2,Fri Jul 3 21:07:20 2015 UTC,"At least legally, there's a pretty big difference. Trespassing is a crime--if Digital Extremes went to the police, the guy would potentially be in some pretty deep shit.  An NDA is just a contract. I don't know how publishers tend to draft them, but my guess is that they'd have less interest in suing an individual writer than in suing the publication they worked for. Unless you're a YouTube personality or something like that, the worst that the publisher would likely do is blacklist you from the industry."
truegaming,3c0tdu,RitchieThai,4,Fri Jul 3 21:28:54 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of how it is viewed depends upon the view of the company.  In theory, both are wrong.  In practice, I generally find trespassing creepy and like it when people violate NDA's.  Why?  Because, game companies have reached the point where their attempts at marketing and social engineering have crossed the line enough times I don't trust most of them anymore.  NDA violations frequently will allow actual discussion and provide real data that isn't entirely controlled by marketing or hype.  A little hype and being wrong in marketing occasionally is acceptable but it's just gone too far lately and the lack of publicly available information lets far too many corners get cut."
truegaming,3c0tdu,Alex__V,2,Fri Jul 3 19:35:04 2015 UTC,"what the guy did was definitely illegal and imho, he should be prosecuted for it. i can't say that kotaku did anything wrong, though. the information the guy gained from the studio was gained in a way that while unethical, does present new information about a game from a well liked studio for the public to consider. kotaku merely took that information and through their own sources, verified it. the way in which information is gained does not always make it unethical to report on, and sometimes the right of the public to know is not the same as it being legal to gain that information.  there is a difference between breaking an NDA (breaking trust with an employer or another entity of which you've signed a contract) and committing a crime. they are both shitty things to do, but they are different. with an NDA, information is given to you freely under the notion that you keep it a secret. what the guy did was more akin to theft than a breach of contract. its a minor detail, but its one worth paying attention to when you look at the entire situation."
truegaming,3c0tdu,coldnever,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:03:31 2015 UTC,"I can see what you mean about there being no difference in one sense. Neither case is exactly the worst terrible evil thing, but both are arguably also wrong to a degree. You could also say that there is a difference, but not necessarily saying one is strictly more right or wrong than the other. I think that depends on the specific scenarios, not just NDA leaks or trespassing in general. It depends on the specifics, and they're simply different scenarios.  I hadn't seen anything about this and the trespassing sounded worse than it did initially, but seeing the story now I'm not surprised by it at all. Physical security is pretty lax at many or most places to the point that there's a term for how this person got in called tailgating.  Initially it sounded like someone maliciously breaking in, but it sounds like this is just some fan who saw a game studio they liked, had a nice day checking it out, and wanted to share the experience. Which isn't to say it was right to do so, but the intent seemed friendly enough.  I see the actual trespassing and the sharing of confidential information in this case as separate things to address. The actual trespassing morally violates the broader social construct of people having privacy on their own property. The scanner is a clear indication that they're asking people not to wander in, the actual physical security just an additional deterrent, and violating that request makes people less comfortable in their own private spaces. Though at least even if it's not a public space, it's just a place people work together and not their private residences.  As for actually sharing information, this fan made no promises and has no obligation to keep the studio's secrets. But the fan knows these are not their secrets to share and it would have been good to respect the studio's privacy.  With an NDA one has an actual agreement and relationship of trust being broken, but that's also to be weighed against the public value of leaking the information if the company itself is using the NDA to enforce its own unethical behaviour.  There are different aspects of right and wrong to balance in both cases."

truegaming,3bt0fa,KoboldCommando,60,Wed Jul 1 22:18:15 2015 UTC,"It's about level design and mechanics more than anything. You take a shot in Team Fortress or Quake and there's no directional indicator, but the maps are put together so that there are few overlapping fields of fire, and you probably know where your opponents are (or should be) anyway. There's less mystery involved when you only have to check a few angles, starting with the most likely one. Plus, a lot of projectile weapons, as apposed to hitscan, makes it easier to track where they're coming from.  As for obscuring the stuff deliberately. Well, that's a different case, but I know that in every single FPS where it's at all possible to limit or remove damage bob, blood effects, and anything else like it, every half-decent player does so. Proper map awareness and reactions are much more important, and having the screen obscured is a pain in the ass."
truegaming,3bt0fa,page0rz,31,Thu Jul 2 04:12:20 2015 UTC,TF2 definitely has a directional indicator of damage.  EDIT: They're talking about OG TF.
truegaming,3bt0fa,dinoseen,16,Thu Jul 2 04:19:47 2015 UTC,I think he was talking about the first Team Fortress (Quake mod). Quake/Doom did not have a directional damage indicator. It was first introduced by Half-Life.

truegaming,3bt0fa,page0rz,3,Thu Jul 2 04:22:30 2015 UTC,It does.
truegaming,3bt0fa,dinoseen,7,Thu Jul 2 04:31:14 2015 UTC,It's pretty easy to tell where you're getting shot from in Quake because most of the weapons have obvious trails or you can see the projectiles. The only weapons that might be kind of hard to see where you're being shot from are the SG and MG.
truegaming,3bt0fa,Kered13,5,Thu Jul 2 07:41:37 2015 UTC,"This might actually be a large part of it.  It's often kind of hard to notice since it blends in with the art style, but I know some games have very large and long-lived ""tracers"" on their hitscan weapons, whereas others have little to no visual.  This could be a huge influence and I'm going to have to pay close attention to it next time I play each game."
truegaming,3bt0fa,page0rz,7,Thu Jul 2 14:50:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I agree with this.  I would say that the complexity of the map is generally much higher in Quake, TF2 and other arena shooters than in the games where I've noticed this problem.  Quake and TF2 tend to have a lot of verticality to their maps, to account for all the parkour and rocket jumps that the engines allow.  This kind of design isn't nearly as integral in other shooters.  In my experience, this issue occurs before you even get to where map design would have an effect.  You either don't notice the incoming damage at all in the first place, or you're taking damage and you have no idea which way to turn.  There could be only a handful of hallways, but with whatever causes the poor indication of damage, you could stand there confused for a moment and then have to systematically check them all, rather than being able to identify the direction immediately."
truegaming,3bt0fa,retrotrinitygaming,13,Thu Jul 2 05:23:36 2015 UTC,"You can systematically check a handful of halls by doing the mental math and eliminating the ones that shouldn't have an enemy in them.   Map complexity isn't the point, it's fields of fire that matter. A good Quake map will have distinct lines of sight from every position, and the players will know the most likely places they'll be taking fire from before the shooting even starts, and they'll already be watching those spots. It's still a matter of ""My opponent is in X part of the map, and from where I'm standing he can only attack from positions Y and Z."" Sound is a big part of it."
truegaming,3bt0fa,page0rz,2,Thu Jul 2 05:54:24 2015 UTC,"But what happens when you get enemies firing from angles where they ""shouldn't be""? TF2 can get you all messed-up that way, especially on King of the Hill maps when you're trying to take the capture point.  Other than the fact that you might have flying Soldiers and Demomen hitting you from overhead, but Spies will sneak around behind your formation, backstab your team Snipers, and then start headshotting you with The Ambassador from positions that are supposed to have only friendlies.  They might not last long doing so (once your team's Pyros and/or Scouts get off their butts and sweep them out), but they'll do it.    Enemy Scouts can also come at you from unexpected angles, which is devastating if they have the Backscatter (and still pretty bad even when they don't).  And then you have ""Ninjaneers"" that want to build L3 sentry guns in the most ridiculous (and, if unchecked, horrifying) locations . . ."
truegaming,3bt0fa,retrotrinitygaming,2,Fri Jul 3 21:04:33 2015 UTC,"Then they get a free shot? I'm not sure what you expect. You can't look everywhere at once, and obviously players are going to try and sneak around each other."
truegaming,3bt0fa,page0rz,2,Sun Jul 5 21:18:38 2015 UTC,Exactly.  Saying that TF2's map design promotes uniform/predictable fields of fire is not entirely accurate.
truegaming,3bt0fa,retrotrinitygaming,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:31:56 2015 UTC,"Yes it is. But that doesn't mean players can't make mistakes, or be outplayed. You're basically saying that because in a fighting game it's possible to block every attack, nobody should ever get hit. That's not how it works."
truegaming,3bt0fa,The-Nose,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:10:57 2015 UTC,"True enough.  That wasn't really the point though.  The point was that TF2 doesn't really give you the option to anticipate fields of fire based on map design.  Some of the maps, like Dust Bowl, are more linear, so it's easier to figure out where the next opponents should be, but other maps . . . not so much."
truegaming,3bt0fa,ToastedFishSandwich,2,Tue Jul 7 17:05:25 2015 UTC,"I thought it was done well in Titanfall. They used a 3d arrow to show the direction you were shot. That way, the arrow could show you exactly where you were shot from, as it would tilt up and down in addition to showing the direction.   It might be too much information to be everyones cup of tea, but i think it is very fitting for games that have a fast paced nature. In Titanfalls case, playing outside of a Titan gives you really fast mobility and the levels allow you to climb to higher places in no time. So a player could start shoting you from above to the side, and next thing you know, he is behind you on the ground. So without that arrow, I think there would be a lot of deaths that would leave you feeling hopeless. It would be hard to tell if there were two players shooting at you from different angles, or if the game simply showed you the wrong direction. Yeah, I'm looking at you Battefield 4."

truegaming,3bt0fa,ReplacementOP,39,Thu Jul 2 06:38:46 2015 UTC,"It's real life. It's night. You're walking home to your downtown apartment after your graveyard shift at the Mickey Dee's. You see a few dudes standing on the street corner up ahead. You're tired, and you really don't want to deal with them right now, but your home's on the other side and you need to get around. You cut into an alley, but it's not one you know - there are corners and forks you weren't expecting - ""urban planning"" is just wishful thinking around here.  You hear a gunshot. Shit! Where did that come from? Was it close? What should you do?  When we want a quick, intuitive answer to all of those questions, we use our ears. This discussion is way too focused on visual cues, because as other people have pointed out on this post, visual cues are often absent, confusing, and unhelpful. The common circular directional indicator around the crosshair is an awkward way of compressing and rotating 3D information, and it takes some extra mental calculations to interpret them. On the other hand, you've been using your ears your whole life and you've gotten pretty good at it.  In TF2, you can always find your opponents, largely thanks to sound design. Similar to Valve's decision to give every character a unique, recognizable silhouette, every weapon class has its own distinct sound effects and firing cadence. Even in the middle of a crowded battlefield, with heavies and sentry guns firing non-stop, the sounds are designed and mixed so you can still distinctly hear the airy rattle of a syringe gun, the punt of a grenade launcher or a spy decloaking. If you take damage, you're going to look where the sound came from.  It helps that, due to TF2's damage fall-off rules and map design, engagements are usually going to take place at mid-to-close range where these audio cues will be effective. The sniper class can, of course, attack you from outside of the sound transmission range, leaving you without audio cues. Let's say a sniper knocks you down to single digit health with a body shot. How do you usually feel when that happens? Maybe a bit confused? Just where is that guy anyway?"

truegaming,3bt0fa,yumcake,14,Sun Jul 5 18:04:58 2015 UTC,"I had a huge problem with this in Metro 2033/Last Light. Every time you were shot a little red marker would show up on the edge of your screen, similar to Call of Duty. I would instinctively turn in that direction to find nothing. I don't think that marker actually corresponded with the direction of fire at all, and always threw me off in combat."
truegaming,3bt0fa,vbl,9,Thu Jul 2 00:57:49 2015 UTC,"It's a design choice about how you want the FPS play to be paced.  1) Give damage indicators, it allows for rapid reprisal on the attacker, creating a give-and-take between the two shooters.  2) Don't give damage indicators, it allows for an attacker to kill without reprisal, creating a one-side exchange.    The value of 1) is obvious, because it results in rapid and direct interaction between 2 players.   However, 2) also has it's value. Because you teach the person who died to do their best not to get attacked in such a one-sided fashion. It leads to less aggression and more caution. Yes, it would create more camping, but also a more realistic attitude about to move forward. This is useful in games that want a realistic style of gameplay because it encourages players to behave more realistically.   Battlefield is a great example here, in normal BF4, they explicitly point out who killed you and from where, and even where they went after they killed you. In ""hardcore mode"" they don't show you anything. This helps create a distinction in how the two modes are played within the same game. Some people actually hate playing normal BF4, but enjoy the hardcore mode. Others hate hardcore mode and enjoy normal BF4. Tweaking this design choice and a few others allows DICE to sell BF4 to two separate audiences at the same time."
truegaming,3bt0fa,vbl,4,Thu Jul 2 13:34:18 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you in terms of design decisions.  It's also interesting to think about the dichotomy between ""hardcore"" and ""normal"" approaches, particularly within a given game like BF4, whether you sacrifice anything from either to be able to offer a dual-mode approach like that.  Though the other part of my post was about those indicators being present and clearly intended to help you recognize and source the damage, yet failing to be noticeable in the heat of battle for whatever reason."
truegaming,3bt0fa,Trotim-,3,Thu Jul 2 14:48:40 2015 UTC,"For me it's about feedback, and I'm not sure the feedback ideas we've seen achieve the goal of bridging the gap between our character getting hit and us being able to ""feel"" it and react.   I can't recall the game, but the devs used a combination of hit indicator (more of a ""pain indicator"") and applying inertia to the character opposite the direction of the hit. This made it easier to feel the hit, since your character stumbled a bit away from the pain.   Even using a simple 8-direction mechanic, it should help you more than just a red mark on some part of your view."
truegaming,3bt0fa,tikarego,2,Thu Jul 2 18:28:57 2015 UTC,"It's not often done to a very ""realistic"" degree, but I believe a small counter-force is quite common in games.  I know all the guns in TF2 apply a force to their target, it's just not enough to significantly disrupt your movement while your feet are on the ground.  This could be part of why TF2's damage feedback is more immediate than some games."
truegaming,3bt0fa,DrBrogbo,2,Thu Jul 2 19:58:32 2015 UTC,"Yea, I think a stumble effect has to exist for it to have adequate impact and give you a directional hint."
truegaming,3bt0fa,Mr_Quackums,2,Fri Jul 3 01:03:18 2015 UTC,"It makes me wonder, for those games that don't have a stumble/push but do have camera shake, if it's simply a matter of the camera shake not being robust and reactive enough?  I would imagine most games simply set a particular maximum angle then have the camera randomly jostle within that range.  Perhaps a reactive slight swing away from the damage and then back would give enough visual feedback to cause an easy reaction from the player.  And of course a slight movement up for forward damage and down for damage from behind, as if your body and head were getting pushed."
truegaming,3bt0fa,Saicotic,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:00:33 2015 UTC,"I can tell you that in TF2 the ""viewpunch"" (as Valve call it) when you get hit always ""punches"" the camera upwards I.e. adds some pitch, then goes back to the original position like a spring. That part is not directional.  Shooting a shotgun or rocket launcher applies the same effect as getting hit but by the time you can fire again, the crosshair is back where it was so it doesn't affect your aim.  Taking fall damage however punches your view in a more random direction."
truegaming,3bt0fa,Saicotic,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:49:39 2015 UTC,Yes but TF2 has the aforementioned push/slide on hit which I believe achieves much the same effect.

truegaming,3bt0fa,Saicotic,2,Fri Jul 3 10:01:50 2015 UTC,"Some games even have directional indicators that make it HARDER to know where the shot is coming from.  The recent remake of Rise of the Triad has the indicator tell you where on your body you got hit, not where the shot came from. So, if a guy directly in front of you tags your right shoulder, the indicator will be at the 3 o'clock position (directly to the right). If the same guy shoots you 4 times and hits you in 4 different spots, you're getting 4 different directional indicators.  It's unbelievably stupid, and I really REALLY wish it weren't even there."

truegaming,3bt0fa,DarcseeD,17,Thu Jul 2 00:41:40 2015 UTC,"Luckily with Doom, the gameplay was in logical terms two-dimensional, so rather than the spot in the center of the screen, you only really had to focus on the vertical slice at the center of the screen, and the portrait was right in the center.  With more modern games with full mouselook, the implementation of a graphic or light next to your crosshair would likely be the closest analogue.  It can definitely get a lot more confusing though, since you're using a circle to represent either a sphere or a cylinder that's rotated 90 degrees (depending on how much vertical play is emphasized in the game), neither of which is a terribly intuitive translation."

It can definitely get a lot more confusing though, since you're using a circle to represent either a sphere or a cylinder that's rotated 90 degrees (depending on how much vertical play is emphasized in the game), neither of which is a terribly intuitive translation.   I think the circle is a pretty good system, as it allows the player to isolate a vertical ""slice"" of what's visible and look through that for the damage source. This is further improved when the damage indicator rotates when you turn, allowing you to pinpoint the horizontal position of an enemy.   I haven't run into many instances where finding the vertical position of a damage source would have helped more than knowing the horizontal position, but if it is such a problem, one possible solution is to have the damage marker grow or shrink depending on whether you move your crosshair vertically closer or further from the damage source, in addition to it rotating as you move your crosshair horizontally (if you understand what I mean)."

I remember when I used to play CoD4, and got somewhat decent at the game, I noticed most of the enemy markers, ally markers and ally death markers on the minimap. I always knew where everyone on my team was and when/where they died, which in turn gave me a good idea of where the enemy was.  All this happened naturally during gameplay, I wasn't even thinking about looking at the minimap or taking focus away from the crosshair. I just saw it from the corner of my eye and since I knew the maps and possible player positions and movements, I unconsciously derived a lot of valuable info from the minimap."

Since almost every game has some sort of level-up or skill tree system these days, the goalposts of what makes an Action RPG have moved, and nobody's really agreed on what that is.

truegaming,3bqzgp,thechristoph,70,Wed Jul 1 13:18:35 2015 UTC,"Yup. Action RPG is really only used now to differentiate an RPG from being Turn-Based.  That being said, Action RPG has been a muddled term for a lot longer than OP is giving it credit. Let's look at his 2 points:   Isometric RPGs with random dungeons that rely mostly on loot progression, typically played with mouse and keyboard (Diablo, Path of Exile, Torchlight)  Third person RPGs with a focus on action-oriented melee combat where you control every attack, typically played with a controller (Dark Souls, Kingdoms of Amalur, Lords of the Fallen)   These 2 aren't mutually exclusive. There are plenty of 3rd Person RPG's with loot progression. Phantasy Star Online, Dungeon Defenders, hell Monster Hunter is an RPG series defined by Loot Progression, and it's got a glut of copycats at this point.  For the better part of 2 decades now I would argue that the term ""Action RPG"" has only existed to differentiate games with progression mechanics from their turn-based brethren. And that's pretty much it.   Do you think we'll see one of the two evolve to be called something different in the future?   To this question from the OP, my answer would be a resounding ""no"". If anything we will see new terms developed for those games but they will still also be known as Action RPG's. Currently the way I've seen them differentiated involves terms like ""Diablo-clone"", ""Lootfest"", ""Isometric Action RPG"", or ""Souls-like""."

The reason people use those terms to describe games they don't strictly imitate is pretty obvious, they're using the terms as shorthand to tell you that these games incorporate the most defining aspects of those genres.  Rougelike is just code for Perma-death and procedurally generated dungeons. RPG is just code for character progression. Strategy is just code for commanding multiple units. Shooter is just code for anything with guns/projectiles.  Arguing the definitions of genre's is just kind of... a waste of everyone's time. You can be as technically correct as you want, but at the end of the day it doesn't change that shorthand definitions, be they somewhat imprecise, are good for a number of reasons and not going anywhere."

Sure, that is how it works, but that kind of definition takes years, more often decades to change, and most words don't change and really shouldn't for the sake of clarity. But more recently people have used that to justify all manner of stupidity. Claiming that ""common usage"" means things like the definition of ""racism"" exclusively means ""power+privilege+prejudice"" as a way to claim minority groups cannot be racist, despite the fact that usage is not even remotely common outside their circles."
truegaming,3bqzgp,pixel_illustrator,6,Wed Jul 1 20:06:12 2015 UTC,"Is your example really common enough to warrant that kind of argument, though?  Seems like people like that can be easily swept aside by pointing out that the majority don't define ""racism"" with those parameters.  Once I can use a word, and that word effectively communicates the precise idea I was trying to convey to the vast majority of people, then that's a shift in language.  This thing about racism having this narrow definition I don't think is something most people subscribe to."

My problem is people attempting to re-define a word for political or social issues in an effort to change the rules associated with it.  Is that super common? I don't honestly know. Is it common enough for me to make a caveat for it? Perhaps. Maybe I only feel that way because of the ideas I surround myself with. Totally possible. But I'd rather play it safe."

The problem is in the way that people have chosen to visualize those individual concepts.  In absolutely no cases will power, privilege, and prejudices be universally systematic divided across races.

This is a big oversimplification IMO, and if people are using it this way, they shouldn't.  Baldur's Gate and similar games are not turn based, yet they are not action RPGs.  An action RPG is a game where most of your time is spent fighting things, and your success depends just as much (if not more) on your twitch skills (aim, reaction time, etc.) as it does on your character's stats. Most action RPGs would still make a fair amount of sense as pure action games if you removed all the RPG character staples like stats and levels.

""Action RPG"" and ""Farm Sim"".   and if people are using it this way, they shouldn't.   ...okay. Again, these are shorthand. They aren't meant to be perfect and instantly describe the entirety of a games systems to you, they're meant to paint the game in very wide brushstrokes.   Baldur's Gate and similar games are not turn based, yet they are not action RPGs.   ...that's why your choices aren't binary. Baldurs Gate would be better described as a Traditional RPG, and if asked about combat you could describe it as real time with pausing and party mechanics. Do most rpg's fall into the Action vs. Turnbased categories? Sure. Not all, so not all games are best described in these terms.   An action RPG is a game where most of your time is spent fighting things, and your success depends just as much (if not more) on your twitch skills (aim, reaction time, etc.) as it does on your character's stats.

And then anything that falls short of that definition is a ""Roguelike-Like"".  I'd say for the most part, they were pretty successful, and most people tend to follow their definition even if they don't realize that conference happened.

truegaming,3bqzgp,_hungrykate13,20,Wed Jul 1 15:25:00 2015 UTC,"Action RPG refers to gameplay mechanics, basically just saying it's an RPG with combat that is not turn-based - especially when combat is done in real-time.  Isometric RPG refers to the camera perspective, as does third-person. While, traditionally, iso-RPGs have had similar features (like those you mentioned), the gameplay mechanics can vastly differ (such as Fallout 1 and 2). Likewise, third-person RPGs don't necessarily have to be like Shadow of Mordor to be a third-person RPG."
truegaming,3bqzgp,tovivify,7,Wed Jul 1 20:32:36 2015 UTC,"In reference to games like Skyrim or Witcher 3, what springs to my mind first is how different the gameplay is from something like Baldur's Gate, and the camera perspective isn't the end-all-be-all of this delineation.    In Witcher 3 or Skyrim, you have mechanics like aim, dodge, roll, etc.  There is a huge emphasis on reflexes, timing, and footwork in a game like this.  It's sort of like an action-adventure game with RPG elements (looting, skill trees, crafting).  In an iso-RPG like Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale, you have tons of abilities, don't really need to rely on your reflexes as much, and there is a greater emphasis on strategy as opposed to tactics.  I would say the mechanics in a game like this reminds me of old-school MMOs like Everquest because the combat mostly involves the use of abilities and strategy, rather than spatial mechanics like dodging, rolling, or aiming.  And then you have games like Diablo and Torchlight; the OP brings up a good point in how these games are considered ""arpg"" even though games like Skyrim and Witcher are labeled as such, too.  The label isn't what I'm necessarily concerned with here; I view these types of games are bridging the gap between iso-rpgs and new-school rpgs like Witcher and Skyrim.  They're isometric and give you tons of abilities, but the use of point-and-click also puts an emphasis on your reflexes, timing, and footwork.  It's the closest to combining the best of both worlds as one can find.  I have no idea when the term ""arpg"" was coined and which type of game it was used to describe first, but if it means anything, TES pre-dates Diablo.   edit: Morrowind is a good eaxmple of iso-rpg mechanics in an arpg.  This game is quite different from other installments in the TES franchise; it primarily uses D&D style dice rolls in combat.  I've never played the game, but I know the emphasis on stat stacking and the way combat works could put it more in line with traditional iso-rpgs, despite having a different camera perspective and technically being an ""arpg."""
truegaming,3bqzgp,LunchpaiI,5,Wed Jul 1 16:41:49 2015 UTC,Except referring to TES games as ARPGs is a new (and in my opinion misguided) thing. They were traditionally referred to as computer RPGs or Western RPGs (as opposed to console/JRPGs). The emphasis is on the open world nature and freedom of mechanical character development. They're games about creating your own character with their own story (as opposed to playing through someone else's story with carefully constructed characters playing their individual roles).

Third person RPGs with a focus on action-oriented melee combat where you control every attack, typically played with a controller (Dark Souls, Kingdoms of Amalur, Lords of the Fallen)   This is the typical ARPG.   It seems to me like Action RPG is a bit of a meaningless term these days. How did it comes to mean two different genres? Do you think we'll see one of the two evolve to be called something different in the future?   Strictly speaking, ARPG is literally ""Action"" RPG. So... an RPG with action elements.  I'd actually say the former category would be closer to ""dungeon crawler"" or something of the sort. ARPG seems misleading."

Some will be all character building and leveling, others will push all that into the background for story and character interaction, or it will be a mix of the two.  So when they turned into video games, different games would focus on one of these things and became their own genres called rpg.

I seriously can't wrap my mind around why there are gamers who think that a Diablo clone are the only action RPGs while changing the camera to third person suddenly makes it an entirely different genre. The purpose remains the same: get loot and level up while fighting in real time combat.

truegaming,3bqzgp,CutterJohn,11,Thu Jul 2 12:49:31 2015 UTC,I don't see the distinction of 1st and 3rd as meaningless. It gives you information about how the game is going to play and how immersive the story will be based on your preferences.   3rd person you have a bigger FOV and better understanding of your character's relationship to the world around them and cover mechanics will probably be more integral to the gameplay. Not many people would say Gears of War and Call of Duty play the same even though you're shooting dudes in both games.   Then there is immersion in the story. Personally I think 3rd person games are make for more immersive story telling because I can see my character as they move through the story/world. I have a friend who prefers FPS because it makes him feel like he is more in the shoes of the character.

truegaming,3bqzgp,InitiallyDecent,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:53:11 2015 UTC,"Those different style of games are all labelled as adventure to convey the fact that they contain forms of puzzle solving and the usage of items that are collected through game play. They're also all fairly heavily story/setting based. All those examples are also co-labelled with different genres, they're not just called adventure games.    Text adventures and Point-and-Click adventures have the loosest usage of a secondary genre, but that's also because the actual game play part of the game is the most limited. You're either just typing in text or clicking on things. That's not to say there's no depth behind those two styles, but there's not much else in them that you actually do.    The Pheonix Wright games are Visual Novels through and through, you'll just not see that genre mentioned at times because people, especially in the Western world, associated Visual Novels with Dating Sims, so they leave it out in an attempt to avoid that association. They're still Visual Novels though, the game play is just focused around the Puzzle-solving inherent in adventure games, rather then trying to date someone.    The Zelda games are Action-Adventures. They feature heavy usage of item collecting and usage, as well as numerous Puzzles that the player has to solve. This is all done in an Action based game."

To borrow WP's text for a second:   In Japanese terminology, a distinction is often made between visual novels proper (abbreviated NVL), which consist predominantly of narration and have very few interactive elements, and adventure games (abbreviated AVG or ADV), which may incorporate problem-solving and other types of gameplay. This distinction is normally lost outside Japan, where both NVLs and ADVs are commonly referred to as ""visual novels"" by international fans. Visual novels and ADVs are especially prevalent in Japan, where they made up nearly 70% of the PC game titles released in 2006.[4]"
truegaming,3bqzgp,ArtKorvalay,5,Tue Jul 7 11:34:09 2015 UTC,"I can see people are already getting petty about details in this thread, which is fine.  Action games are supposed to be just that -- action.  If you have to progress and learn abilities, there comes a point where it definitely turns into a hybrid RPG.    This progression started on both ends.  Games like Diablo which would have formerly been top down turn based RPGs added a little action to make the RPG more exciting for the player.  Then on the action side of things games like Borderlands or Dark Souls started adding character progression via level ups, adding a bit of RPG to the action.  This, however, was not added to make the game more exciting.  Why it was added is a whole other question.  I'd guess it had to do with the games that wanted you to collect stuff but had no real reason to do so -- turn the stuff into level ups and now there's a reason to hide arbitrary shit in nooks and crannies so that players spend more time in the game finding it.    Really, by now, I think the term has lost a lot of meaning because the number of pure Action or RPG games is fewer than the hybrids.  If nearly every RPG is an Action RPG, do we really still need to make the distinction?"
truegaming,3bqzgp,shiftplusone,6,Tue Jul 7 11:50:36 2015 UTC,"Action RPG means that you can't pause the action to add commands. This can be applied to many different genres of RPG games. The camera has nothing to do with it. Some games are somewhere in-between, like The Witcher 1.      Lately, I've found myself suddenly getting back into more traditional CRPG games. I've got both Fallout and Fallout 2 going on one computer and The Witcher 1 going on another computer. I've got a game of KOTOR happening on my iPad. I'm thinking of finally starting-starting a game of Baldurs Gate on my iPad as well. (Bought the iOS version at launch, still haven't progressed the game past the tutorial.)    Fallout, Fallout 2, and KOTOR are turn-based. Torchlight, Torchlight 2, Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, Oblivion, and Skyrim are action-based.    Morrowind and The Witcher 1 are somewhere in-between. Morrowind for example uses virtual dice roles to hit. Reading the comments from people who enjoyed Oblivion and Skyrim, the pen & paper system of rolling to hit seems odd and frustrating. (A different generation of gamers.) Personally, I love that system. What you can't do in Morrowind is pause the action to give commands. It's kind of a hybrid. Also, the movement isn't turn-based. That part of it is definitely action-based. In fact, Morrowind is probably an action-based RPG in its entirety, despite rolling to hit rather than using a hit box.    I don't think the term action-based is meaningless. I think it gets muddled because it's a broad category. I think it gets further muddled because there are games that fall somewhere in between turn-based and action-based.    If you look at games on a timeline and graphing sales figures, I think it's easier to understand. As games became more action-based and less turn-based, sales figures have skyrocketed. There's always been a limited market for traditional RPGs, despite the popularity. Action-based RPGs are simpler and more accessible. (And far less nerdy.) Some people have called this a dumbing down. I tend to think of this as progress. The further away the gaming industry gets from pen & paper RPGs, the more it makes sense. Similar to how Apple dropped skeumorphic design.    Of course, there will always be people who enjoy pen & paper RPG games and people who enjoy turn-based CRPGs, but I don't think that market will ever be as big as the market for FPS shooter-style RPGs.    (BTW, every game I mention in this post is awesome and I highly recommend them. Particularly the older turn-based RPGs.)"

Though there are some actions you can do while paused, for example drinking potions, doing alchemy, switching armor and clothing, and sometimes switching weapons. You can also use enchantments near-instantly.  I actually really love Morrowind's combat despite the fact most people call it esoteric, and with decent reason. The chance to hit (or dodge) can add a large element of strategy and risk to it. What happens when you hit a string of bad rolls and keep missing? You have to be prepared."
truegaming,3bqzgp,jayemecee,2,Wed Jul 1 18:28:31 2015 UTC,"Usually games genres come from other genres, when a genre becomes too big (describes too different games), it divides itself onto smaller branches. It happened with the action genre (Action-RPG, Action-shooter, action-adventure, action-platformer, etc).  It has been like this for sometime now, and we are probably on the verge of a new genre name."
truegaming,3bqzgp,gizayabasu,2,Fri Jul 3 01:26:18 2015 UTC,"This is probably a shift that's occurred more recently in gaming as games have gotten more complex. Previously, there's been more of a distinction between RPGs and action games. Now, the lines have gotten blurred, with RPG franchises implementing more action aspects and real-time combat (think Final Fantasy) and action games as a whole adding traditionally RPG mechanics to their systems. The results are games that are completely different in nature, play style, and narrative, but when reduced to its simple components, seem really similar. Many modern console RPGs that have some sort of leveling mechanic and action combat is thus called, for simplicity's sake, an action RPG."
truegaming,3bqzgp,vazzaroth,2,Thu Jul 2 02:19:02 2015 UTC,"I'm actually OK with both of those games being action RPGs. Part of the issue is that Souls games are a fairly new genre. I can't really think of many RPG-driven games before Dark Souls that fall into this category. New genres always piggyback off existing ones for awhile until we have enough to make a new name. We're pretty much at that point for 3rd personal slashers. (How's that?)  The more egregious use of this term, and what I expected to be one of the two genres from your title, is JRPG style games that aren't just menu driven. IE, you move on your turn and attack with button combos, but it's still turn based.  Ex: https://youtu.be/dt_PXsuAzlk?t=371  I've seen this called an action RPG. Luckily, people generally call these types of games JRPG and call it a day. But ""Action RPG"" is definitely something I've seen this type of game called."
truegaming,3bqzgp,mishugashu,2,Wed Jul 1 13:52:09 2015 UTC,"As pointed out, Action RPG is a broad category to differentiate itself from turn-based RPGs that used to be the normal. But, I always call that first definition a ""hack'n'slash"" RPG."
truegaming,3bqzgp,MisanthropeX,2,Wed Jul 1 16:50:53 2015 UTC,"Because ""RPG"" is a very, very broad category. While we tend to think of games in the vein of Final Fantasy and Baldur's Gate as RPGs, the reality is that according to the most strict definitions, games as disparate as EVE Online, Crusader Kings, Banjo Kazooie and Mario Kart could all theoretically count as RPGs.  EDIT: I should also mention that just like RPGs are often divided into ""western/computer RPGs"" and ""Japanese RPGs"", the two genres you describe above are usually divided according to regional lines: the isometric, loot based games like PoE, Diablo and Torchlight are usually western and American developed, and the third person type of RPG are more popular in Asia. While Amalur is an exception, Dark Souls is Japanese and Lords of the Fallen is a direct ripoff of DS. More examples in the third person action RPG genre would be Kingdom Hearts, Dark Cloud and Legend of Mana, all of which are classic Japanese games."
truegaming,3bqzgp,kailkay,2,Wed Jul 1 18:40:51 2015 UTC,"With other artistic media (specifically literature, drama, music and cinema) we apply genres to various works so that the consumer of that media knows more or less what to expect, so that the artist can get their artwork out to as many people as possible that might be interested in it. Sub-genres get applied based on nuances of the work; Dude, Where's My Car? is considered a comedy, sub-genre as 'stoner comedy', while How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days is also a comedy, sub-genre as 'romantic comedy'.  Similarly, we have the (modern) game genre of 'Action RPG'. It's a sub-genre of RPG; RPGs feature character progression, generally story-driven games, usually with combat or some kind of encounter giving 'experience', or something to promote character power growth over time. The 'action' sub-genre of RPGs refers to an active, high-paced form of play, rather than something more slow-paced, strategic, turn-based style of play reminiscent of perhaps japanese RPGs or some strategy-RPG games.  That this sub-genre is still fairly broad is a pretty noticeable point, but I think that Diablo and Dark Souls both effectively share the 'Action RPG' genre, in that they are both fast-paced, active/reactive games that feature a character progression as one of its core game mechanic structures. Could there be further sub-genres? Perhaps. But that might needlessly complicate things when you can use other words to describe the game beyond its genre.  ""An isometric Action RPG in the vein of Diablo"", or ""A fast-paced over-the-shoulder RPG similar to Mass Effect"" works, with the benefit of letting a lot of people know that this is a game that features a lot of character power-growth, maybe some XP, maybe some loot stuff, without having a lot of separate sub-genres that might alienate potential players from considering the game."
truegaming,3bqzgp,nbates80,5,Wed Jul 1 20:32:16 2015 UTC,"The term Action RPG is to differentiate rpgs with strong story and non violent interaction (crafting, dialogue, investigation quests) from games that are mostly combat. So, Diablo vs Baldur's Gate; Dark Souls vs Skyrim.  In my mind, Action RPGs are action games that have rpg elements added (leveling, skills)  Edit:  Action RPG is more specific than RPG. If you think Action RPG is too broad of a term, RPG is even broader: it includes games that feature lots of reading, crafting, etc and games about killing everything on your way; it includes 2d games and 3d games; computer games and console games; linear and non linear games. The term ""action"" added to RPG only gives you an idea of what to expect; same for ""J"" on ""JRPG"".  As an ex tabletop rpg player I always argued against calling Diablo an RPG. To me, RPG are games that have a clear and meaningful tabletop rpg influence; just leveling, experience and stats based combat doesn't cut it. Tabletop rpgs are about stories, combat and non violent interaction, exploration, talking to npcs; any computer or console game that wants to be called an RPG, to me, has to feature most of those. Of course, there are many limitations imposed by the medium, but within reason it is expected that you have some kind of dialogue and that the dialogue is affected by your character's skills.  TL;DR: RPG is a very broad term, adding ""action"" is a little less broad but still too broad."

truegaming,3bqzgp,clintbellanger,2,Wed Jul 1 14:56:41 2015 UTC,"Those are two subgenres of Action RPGs. All those games are similar in many ways. But they're playing to the strengths of each perspective (isometric vs third person) because of the controls and point of view.  I make Isometric Action RPGs. Here are some things that come naturally with making a game in that point of view, compared to 3rd-person Action RPGs:   Click to move and click to attack/shoot monster is an easy, accessible control scheme. But it does make characters less agile, and combat ends up being simplified because of it. Some Isometric RPGs do have separate movement and aiming (WASD + mouse, or twin-stick, etc) and features like lock-on targeting. These tend to be niche hardcore games. Isometric RPGs are simpler to make, and adding a complicated combat system is probably out of scope/budget of most teams. With the isometric perspective we have a lot more visible battlefield 360 degrees around the player. It's tempting to fill that screen with monsters. Deep, complicated 1v1 footsies fighting game combat would be difficult against dozens of creatures constantly. Compare to a third-person game, where you generally focus on one or a few enemies at once. If the combat and movement stay simple, and you're fighting huge waves of enemies, then gameplay changes flow from that. You can't have EVERY enemy drop loot, that slows down combat. So you make loot rare, which ends up being a fun occasional reward. Turns out random loot isn't just fun, but life-ruining addiction levels of fun. So you keep the gameplay simple (less work anyway for your small team), and put the game in the hands of more players. If you're making randomly generated items for loot, it saves a lot of time and effort if the art is simple. That's easier in an isometric game where the gear isn't viewed close-up. Compare to Borderlands, a big selling point was the random gun models. A random 3D sword generator would be a similar undertaking. A random armor generator that always animates well in a complex 3rd person combat system sounds nearly impossible (for now). Plenty of isometric RPGs have random levels, possible with simple gameplay and the reuse of tiles. 1st/3rd person 3D games have far more intricate levels/worlds, with hand-crafted enemy placement and layouts for combat. High quality random 3D worlds are hard enough that they generally are matched with simplified art and gameplay. If your action gameplay is slower and deeper (because you have 3D controls and point of view), and you can see the sky and horizon (because POV and camera controls), you might as well stage fights in awesome locations with epic views. That takes hand-crafted levels, not random generation (for now).   I say ""for now"" because technology (engines, assets, middleware) will meet all these needs eventually. But right now, if you have finite money and years to make a game, these are the kinds of games that make sense for their subgenres."
truegaming,3bqzgp,WallyWinthrop,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:35:33 2015 UTC,"I think the evolution of the term comes with the evolution of the genre and gaming technology as a whole. Back in the day hardware was less powerful so a lot of games needed to be more abstract if they wanted to be complicated. They started with early text games where the game would wait for you to input commands and arguably the genre grew from there. After a point it became a design choice. Do you want tactical turn based combat and/or heavy dialogue emphasis or do you want  to test the person's reflexes and timing while  still retaining some aspect of the former? I would consider this to be the main distinction between a ""tradional"" RPG and an Action RPG. All the RPG sub genres had things in common and where distinct from emerging genres like pure action or sports games.  I feel like part of the problem with defining genres nowadays is that a lot of AAA devs now release games to appeal to the widest possible audience so they sprinkle a little bit of everything in there. For example back in the PS1 days most shooters where just shooters, but nowadays every other FPS/TPS has unlockable power ups and or abilities, let you craft weapons, customize and upgrade your equipment; you even get to make minor story decision every now and then etc etc. Or hell take sports games, even some of those have a story now.   Which is why I feel like using only one genre to describe most games nowadays doesn't work as well as it used to. You get weird situations where a game gets grandfathered in to a genre. Take the Zelda games for example. If you classify most Zelda games as Action RPGs then in all fairness the newer GTA games should be considered Action RPGs as well. Both have a story focus and gear progression. Both involve the use of reflexes. In Zelda you get money by breaking pots and cutting grass and in GTA you get it by breaking into cars and cutting whores and so on and so on. They are quite similar in a lot of ways."
truegaming,3bqzgp,azripah,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:04:10 2015 UTC,"It's a broad term to distinguish them from turn based rpgs, but are they really that different? It's just a matter of perspective. I mean, Torchlight and Skyrim are both obviously RPGs, they just look different- i.e. one is isometric."

NBA Jam is an action game, whereas NBA2Kxx is much closer to an action RPG. Of course they both have characters with different stats and those 'under the hood' numbers still partly determine the outcome of an interaction. But there isn't much between your inputs and the outcome in an arcade game, whereas NBA2k has all these systems that stand between what you do on the controller and what happens on screen.  So I kinda think it's an issue of intent. RPGs are usually slower and more tactical than action games. That's why I wouldn't put Bayonetta in the same category as Dark Souls. Sure, both games have builds and options for characters. But the emphasis is completely different and appeals to completely different kinds of people, so it's worth having some terminology to help us talk about what they're going for."

Brawler as in games like AC and God of War where you have to time attacks and do combos(in the Street fighter/Mortal Kombat sense), and actively defend/block. You might call them Dueling RPG's as the emphasis is on reactive single or small-group combat.  Then there's Dungeon Crawler or ""Meat Grinder"" RPG's where dice rolls and some positioning determine defense, and offense is basically entirely dice roll based, usually with damage layering (either cooldown bursts or damage over time based). These have a heavy emphasis on killing massed groups of enemies. Diablo, PoE, etc.  Action RPG's could apply to both of the above, but to me means games with loot/stat progression, but most often simple(50 weapon damage - 20 armor = 30 damage), and manually aimed hit-location based damage. Simple/static damage models because it would be understandably silly to see a bullet or sword hit a helmetless head of an enemy and get a diceroll that says ""no damage"" or ""miss""(IIRC Morrowind was a little silly in this regard).

If it's an RPG with heavy combat then I'd be happy with the mash up of the 2 terms. Quite frankly I don't think the camera angle comes into that decision at all, it's not a core mechanic to the game it's how the game is represented.  But back to the marketing idea, if they label something as Action RPG or Action Adventure or anything like that, they know that they can catch more people because they think they're going to hack and slash their way through a game. I mean heck the top selling genres in games are Action, Sport and a final one I forgot (Go check out the ESA 2014 brief).

Aside from Dark Souls, those type games are pretty much exclusively made in the European/American countries.   Part of that reason Is I never heard anyone call that second group ARPGs before until 2 years ago, while I have heard it refer exclusively to Diablolikes for over a decade.   Honestly though , the common descriptor of ""RPG with real time combat"" is a meaningless descriptor, as it's far , far more common for an RPG to have real time combat than not nowadays (unless we're talking JRPGs)."

If you could create a video of them each being played from the same perspective, the viewer would have nothing to distinguish them as distinctly different types of games. However, if you did the same with Pillars of Eternity, the viewer would see significant differences in how combat plays out (pausing to issue commands), as well as the far deeper character interaction portion of the game (choosing conversation options, and seeing how character creation and previous choices affect future options).  Personally I think Action RPG is a better descriptor than Iso-RPG, which should honestly never be used as a genre descriptor. All it tells you is that the game is an RPG played from an Isometric perspective. It doesn't tell you anything about gameplay. Diablo and Pillars of Eternity are both Iso-RPGs, but one is heavily action focused, and the other is far more RP/Story focused.  A fairer criticism of the term ARPG is the fact that many games described as such barely qualify as RPGs. Diablo III has no character development that isn't purely mechanical. It's an Iso-Action game. Pillars is heavily character focused and certainly earns its RPG stripes."

truegaming,3bsdo0,Krywiggles,3,Fri Jul 3 00:02:55 2015 UTC,"It all makes sense and there is no mystery.   Its a known fact that the Confederates had superior military leadership for most of the Civil War. Lee was picked by Winfield Scott to lead the Union Army at the start of the war but Lee declined due to not wanting to fight against his home. The Army of Northern Virginia outmaneuvered and outfought The Army of The Potomac up until Gettysburg and even that outcome can be attributed more to the actions of Meade's subordinates and the tactical errors of Lee insted of George Meade's leadership. Many of the veteran officers from the Mexican War fought for the Confederate Army, and if Stonewall Jackson wasn't killed the war could have ended much differently. Until Gettysburg the only thing the Union had going for them was that Grant was waging a successful campaign in the western theater but that all could have been for nothing if Lee won at Gettysburg.  The Army of Northern Virginia was fighting a defensive campaign for the entire war with exception to Antietam and Gettysburg and morale was higher for much of the war compared to the Army of The Potomac because they were defending their home territory and because of the many victories won before Gettysburg.   Like what /u/Krywiggles said the Confederate Army was using weapons 10-20 years older that were either imported from Britain or using the rifles the soldiers brought with them from home. The Union had almost all of the industrial capabilities of The United States and had more miles of railroad tracks to move men and supplies to the front faster than the Confederates could ever hope to."

Lee, Longstreet, and Jackson were able to execute some insanely risky maneuvers, including splitting the army in the face of a numerically superior enemy and leaving holes in the line, because for the most part Union leadership was incapable of capitalizing on their advantages in manpower and supply."

Also, Confederate morale depends entirely upon what part of the war you're at, but desertion was a pretty big problem throughout the war so I don't know that the Confederates having a morale advantage is very historical."
truegaming,3bsdo0,yumcake,3,Thu Jul 2 18:04:25 2015 UTC,"Few games actively preserve gameplay imbalance as a design choice. The few that do typically compensate for the imbalance by having players switch sides and do a ""best of 3"" to determine the winner (I believe Rainbow 6: Siege is a recent example of this)  Asymmetrically balanced gameplay isn't that unusual, you see it in all MOBAs, in Starcraft, Evolve, L4D2, Dead Space 3, Natural Selection, etc. But most of them want the asymmetry to still result in overall balance during the round rather than accepting imbalance.   In single-player, the issue of balance between sides is often thrown out the window. The Total War franchise has always had lots of scenario-battles where the player steps into the role of playing out a historical battle where the sides are rarely on equal footing, and the player adapts accordingly to the hand they've been dealt. Those scenario battles are tons of fun!  On the whole, I love asymmetrically balanced gameplay. It's almost like getting double the value out of a game. Rather than playing as two sides but only 1 shared set of abilities. Play long enough on one team, and you'll be bored of both teams since it won't make a real difference to change sides if they're symmetrical. In an asymmetrically balanced game, you get multiple ability sets to try out and enjoy. It's really just a budget challenge for designers who will have to spend a much greater amount of money on testing and balancing the asymmetrical design. I don't like the asymmetrically imbalanced design for multiplayer since I don't have time to play through a ""best of 3"" match.   But few games really focus hard on truly symmetrical balance. For example, in Battlefield while both sides typically have the same set of capabilities, in actual practice you're usually mismatched against an opponent. For example, if I'm running around as an engineer with a shotgun in close-quarters, if I bump into a soldier without a shotgun, I've got an advantage. Or, if I'm a sniper watching that shotgun engineer step outside of a building, that engineer is now at a huge disadvantage. Or, if I'm an assault trooper bumping into the engineer at close-medium range, we'd be relatively equal in capability, but if I'm sitting in a tank, the engineer is probably going to get fucked in a 1 on 1 encounter. But if the engineer has a coordinated squad assisting, while the tank is unsupported, the tank has a good chance of losing. Though both teams are in abstract allowed access to the same sets of abilities, in practice the actual combat is rarely on equal footing because everyone has an advantage in specific scenarios. It's a constant stream of asymmetrically balanced combat on a tactical level, while still being symmetrical on a strategic level. A lot of games have this kind of hierarchies of combat.   Sniper weapons in a game for example are almost always asymmetrical by their nature of dealing damage at long range to limit the enemy's ability to respond. Snipers however, are disadvantaged at close range against most other weapons. The sniper has limited or no zone of ""parity"" with any other weapon, aside from sniper-on-sniper battles, making it an inherently asymmetrical weapon (There was a recent thread in /r/truegaming talking about how sniper weapons almost never factor into balancing an FPS game, they're there to add the zest of imbalance). The analogy I'd used in that thread was that snipers in an FPS game are like brickthrowers at a boxing match. You've got two guys on relatively equal footing, dishing out and taking damage, plus a third guy who sits in the audience outside the ring trying to disrupt the fight by tossing bricks from the outside. The brickthrower can be countered by having another brickthrower in the audience trying to hit him back and keep him from upsetting the balance in the ring, or perhaps a boxer outside the ring chasing him through the stands dodging bricks...but this is just balancing to try to fix the problem the brickthrower creates. If the brickthrower is eliminated, all of the balance issues stay within the boxing ring, and instead we talk about in-ring specializations like boxers with fast hands, power punching, in-fighters, crafty defense, etc, rather than how to deal with the guy outside of the ring. But we keep the brickthrower in games because the asymmetry is fun! People find enjoyment in the big change of pace of being at a big disadvantage and somehow finding a way to come out on top, and they find enjoyment in having a big advantage and dominating. It adds a small variation to the overall pacing."
truegaming,3bsdo0,AnalysisSitus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:22:38 2015 UTC,"While not a video game, Netrunner is a card game which at its core is asymmetric. One player is a megacorporation, and the other a hacker (or a Runner, if you will). The Runer wants to break into the servers of the Corp to steal particular cards, while the Corp wants to prevent this and instead ""score"" those cards for themselves.  At the start of the game, the Corp has no defences at all. As a result, the Runner will have a relatively easy time getting into their servers. On the other hand, they only pay for their defences once, so once they are able to get set up, they are set until the Runner can afford the tools they need to get through.  It's an excellent game nearly every way you want to look at it. From the perspective of game design, the ways it tries to tackle the problems of balancing an asymmetric game are interesting. Also, it's incredibly fun."

truegaming,3bp876,Rexcalibur,146,Wed Jul 1 01:19:27 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of Arkham-style combat but I hardly think it's 'prevalent'. The games I know that truly succeed at making complex, satisfying, rhythm-based brawlers are: the Arkham series themselves, Shadow of Mordor by the same publisher and Silver Dollar's one redeeming game, One Finger Death Punch. The still early access darling, Hand of Fate is one of the only others.   The Arkham combat system is a Score-Attack system. Each punch is worth 10 points. Attacks more complicated than punch are worth more. Each consecutive blow increases the overall multiplier. Some skills points are even synergistic with each other. Enemies have a finite amount of health so essentially you're trying to wring the maximum amount points out of each thug before they run out of life. Often the combo finishers that automatically knock-out opponents are less desirable than combo finishers that merely break a weapon or disable the bruiser. Keeping them alive allows them to take more punishment.    Taking out enemies in Batman is crazy easy. Maximizing your score is crazy hard. If you're just looking to dunk on fools as fast as possible, Arkham doesn't have much to offer. If you're looking to build the biggest possible combo, it does."
truegaming,3bp876,Dr_Scientist_,39,Wed Jul 1 01:36:07 2015 UTC,"Sleeping Dogs did a variation on Arkham combat.  For all the praise that gets heaped on the game (and to be fair, I've enjoyed the substantial part of Sleeping Dogs I've played), I feel like it really didn't do justice to the system.  Part of the problem was the lock on system making in hard to seamlessly switch between opponents.  Another part was the addition (and prevalence) of blocking enemies that have to be taken out with a heavy attack, executed by holding the attack button, rather than a button combo, which to me really broke the flow of the combat (which is ironic for a combat style originally called freeflow).  All in all, I think that that was really what the problem with Sleeping Dogs' implementation of the Arkham combat boils down to: they took some of the elements of the system which is so ludically pleasing because of the flow of combat between large groups of enemies, and removed the sense of flow without changing much else."
truegaming,3bp876,MackDaddyVelli,7,Wed Jul 1 01:47:23 2015 UTC,"There wasn't enough variety of moves either, different combos would have been more enjoyable I think. It was a terrible game but I kind of enjoyed the variety of attacks in the Legend of Korra game."

I see where you're coming from, but I felt like that seamlessness just didn't feel as satisfying."
truegaming,3bp876,LeifEriksonisawesome,3,Wed Jul 1 06:56:19 2015 UTC,"At least the combat system in sleeping dogs had actual gameplay in the form of combos and different types of attacks. They also included a good grasp of ranged combat when it happened and environmental attacks.  Comparatively the combat in arkham is super hollow. The fact that the game does everything for you is so boring, all the combos are automatic and you dont have any different attacks other than the super silly 'blind' shit which is essentially just a telegraphed ability they force you to use against heavy enemies. You can literally get away with smashing x and draging the joystick in every which way, you dont even have to counter attack if you dont want to. Shadows of mordors combat system is equally boring for the same reason."
truegaming,3bp876,Bap1811,11,Wed Jul 1 16:55:05 2015 UTC,"I don't really like the combat in Batman that much, I haven't really found a brawler recently that's as intense or brutal as I'd like, but the best i've seen it implemented is easily the Arkham games. I really don't like them that much, I find Batman (as a character) to be beyond milked dry, the cheesy throwback comic aesthetic doesn't play well with me, and the complete lack of mature storytelling in replacement for that semi-ironic childish feel they're going for just kinda bores me.   That said, the combat in the Arkham games made sense. It's not so much ""fight for your life"" as it is ""convince us you're Batman"". The challenge doesn't come from killing the enemies, it's by dispatching them without taking hits, without interrupting your combos, by keeping in mind the different types of enemies all requiring different moves, to chain different attacks together with different aerial abilities; it's intense, violent, beautifully animated with absolutely no room for glitches. You are Batman, seeing 20 enemies infront of you shouldn't have you feeling like ""fuck, how am I gonna get out of this?"" it should have you thinking ""how quickly should I get past this lot?"". The only offensively bad melee combat system recently used is Assassins Creed, IMO. Where Batman irons out some challenge for the sake of you being a superhero, AC irons out ALL challenge and playability cause it assumes you have no thumbs and no eyesight."
truegaming,3bp876,EdEmKay,2,Wed Jul 1 19:44:47 2015 UTC,"I played the first two so I guess asylum and city. I dont remember noticing a big different between the two in terms of minute to minute combat gameplay.   I mean the main diversity is just ""requirements"" you have to do before they allow you to spam X. Blind this guy before spamming X, jump over this guy before spamming X, hit him with a batarang before spamming X. Yeah its nice and all but just feels really empty because thats the only actual thing you do.   If the game required good position that would likely be a huge difference already, if they made it that you cant ALWAYS hit a counter attack no matter what you're doing, if they made it so you had an actual block that you'd needed to time against an animation and that triggered a counter with a combo press or something. Hell give me 2 types of hits like witcher does, and witcher is already not that complicated but at least it adds small things here and there to make it a little more interesting.   Idk give me something."
truegaming,3bp876,Bap1811,7,Thu Jul 2 00:41:40 2015 UTC,"This is a really big point. In the Arkham games, victory is basically inevitable, but the system still gives you a lot of room to play well (combos, gadget diversity, etc.) and a metric to measure your ability if you want to master it. Or, if you're not interested, you can press through without caring about your score and get on with the story or the predator challenges or whatever.  Dark Souls is a game with a deep combat system that demands you master that depth to proceed. Arkham is a game with a deep combat system that gives you the choice of whether you want to master it or just get by. I think which one is better comes down to the individual's tolerance for failure. Some people get really frustrated beating their head against a Dark Souls style wall trying to ""Git Gud"", and for them being able to get through the brawls and come back to the challenges later on is great. Some people don't give a damn about Arkham's scoring system and won't bother trying to master the combat system because there's very little cost for not doing so. Both are valid ways of designing a system, though."

I love the stories in most games, and see the combat as something to just get past to get to more story.  But in Batman you can either just web everyone in the head and take them out, or you can have some fun, and add some flare.   This whole thread seams to focus on simplicity or difficulty of games, but doesn't say much about how fun it is or how fun you can make it, the story, the responsiveness, the fact that you're batman and you're meant to be able to take people out this easily."
truegaming,3bp876,barristonsmellme,9,Wed Jul 1 06:10:08 2015 UTC,"I think you've hit on the main issue here. The reason this style of combat is getting more common is because it's more visceral and satisfying - most people play games recreationally rather than as a test of skill and for them it's all the better for it.  For example, VATS in Fallout 3 makes the game a whole metric butt-load easier but I don't dislike its addition. In fact, I feel that it is a large factor in what makes the game good. It's simple, entertaining and very satisfying to use."

In fact, I feel that it is a large factor in what makes the game good. It's simple, entertaining and very satisfying to use.   I agree. But you have to remember that basic FPS mechanics in Fallout 3 / New Vegas are completely shit too, which is one of the reason people have liked VATS. It's not like it is entirely a debate between ""the shooter crowd who likes skill in shooting"" vs ""the casual crowd who doesn't want to be challenged by gameplay"". In reality IMO, it's more ""the people who absolutely despise VATS and have a high resistance to bullshit mecanics"" vs ""the crowd who stopped using regular method of shooting at the start of the game because they were shocked by how terrible it was"". Because sincerely, as an FPS, Fallout 3/NV are terrible, probably as terrible as they are great as RPGs / open-world.  I know that some people may disagree, but that's the reason why I personaly used only the VATS system in those games (and you could say that I'm not bad at FPS since I play them since quake 3 and have done a lot of competition). It had nothing to do with it being easier and all to do with it being the one of the 2 systems which wasn't terrible."

The accuracy of your shot is tied in to your character's stats. It's a CRPG that just happens to be presented in a first person camera, rather than a FPS.

So a lvl1 player versus a lvl 5 enemy is hard*, but a lvl30 player versus that same enemy is easy.  But a lvl30 player versus a lvl80 enemy is hard again.  And so on.

All I had to do to adjust was make sure they were all attacking on one side, with infinite roll this isn't remotely hard. As long as I can see them, they stood no chance.

As far as this combat system being some kind of up-jumped quick-time event, I feel compelled to agree.   Though, all game systems - combat or otherwise - could be perceived as a series of necessary button presses corresponding directly to inputs on the screen. Melee combat just isn't done very well in most games, it's certainly not as perfected as videogame gunplay. The last game that really left an impression of awesome melee combat was probably the first Shenmue on the Dreamcast. For Batman to pull off melee combat the way he does inside a three dimensional area with no Z-Targeting against a large number of enemies is just damn impressive.

This is a fantastic point.  It is interesting to note how many people criticize QTE systems while supporting essentially just a more complicated version of it.  Take this boss for instance.  I remember being younger fighting it and having a really hard time.  He mostly has two attacks.  A horizontal and a vertical laser sweep.  Eventually I learned to recognize which laser was about to come by watching his body, and attacking inbetween bursts.  Once I figured out to play defensively and just observe enemies before attacking, the game got a lot easier.  Is that not that same as just watching for X to appear on screen and then pressing the right buttons on my controller or keyboard?   Of course not exactly.  I could envision some kind of scale, where combat starts as just call and response QTE on one end of the scale, and as you move away from it, you are still responding to inputs on the screen, but both your method of response gets more complicated and the DISPLAY of that input on the screen also gets more complicated."

For example, the final boss of a fighting game give you all of your combos to punish the boss with; in a platformer, the meat of the boss fight is maneuvering around the boss's attack.  A QTE bossfight makes it incredibly simple to perceive the attack (colored button on the screen), gives you only one option to avoid the attack (press the button), and the only punishment comes from the scripted cutscene, which you have no control over. This is incredibly shallow on all three fronts, so in my opinion the game would suffer if you could beat that boss by standing still and doing a QTE. Even the shittiest boss fight is better than that."
truegaming,3bp876,KlopeksWithCoppers,34,Wed Jul 1 04:42:24 2015 UTC,"How much do you enjoy combo-oriented combat systems with few button inputs?   I like them a lot.  As other people have pointed out the challenge is often in playing PERFECTLY and racking up huge scores, not in just clearing rooms.  Although I'm not sure how many people have played on the hardest difficulties of batman games, with the helper icons turned off.     Are you okay with this era of Arkham-style brawlers?   Yes.  If enough people do not like this style of combat, devs will eventually change it to something else.     Do you want changes?   Changes I think would be really good:   More Challenge Arkham style games do often end up being a little on the easy side.  However this style of combat lends itself really well to perfect-style play.  There needs to be unlockable or optional modes that really, really, REALLY punish mistakes in combat.  For example if batman gets hit by a knife attack he would just instantly lose 3/4th of his health.  There should be a lot of enemy variety that you need to consider, as well as environmental obstacles (electric fences / holes in the floor) to be careful of. Less Cheese By cheese I mean cheesy moves that make you practically invincible.  In batman games you can do this to complete pretty much every room: Punch once then do batman's big leaping dodge thing, and repeat.  That dodge move, in my opinion, would be much better off having some sort of stamina bar attached to it.  It seems like its designed as an emergency escape move, but continuously using it makes a lot of fights too easy.  Part of the challenge of fights should be avoiding certain moves by attacking other, lesser enemies.  When you have a completely one size fits all dodge move that NO ENEMIES can counter, it makes the game too easy. Move-set Customization If you are playing a batman game, of course you are going to fight like Batman.  That's what I expect and what I WANT.  But that doesn't mean you can't customize some things.  For example, want to equip the shock-gloves?  Great.  You can no longer use detective vision in combat.  Like leaping around and being super agile?  Wear the lighter bat-suit but take more damage.  Speed running the game?  Equip special bat-suit upgrades that let your parries do 3x the damage, but remove all counter icons.  Things like that would let players fight the way they want to while having them make difficult choices.      What would you like to see?   Somewhere I think there is a happy marriage between single target focused combat like dark souls, and big group arkham style combat.  I view Dark Souls combat as a very precise, intense QTE fighter in a weird way, where each mistake you make really messes you up.  I view arkham style combat as largely PUZZLE based, and trying to play perfectly to get huge scores.    I would like to see what other people here have to say about a game like Ninja Gaiden (the 3D ones).  Perhaps marrying that combat to Arkham style combat would produce something interesting."
truegaming,3bp876,Ihadanapostrophe,6,Wed Jul 1 08:16:59 2015 UTC,"Ninja Gaiden was actually exactly what was going through my mind.  There's a huge difference between the games, though.  The first two games had two attack inputs (strong/weak) along with mobility inputs.  You could not just mash buttons and make your way through the game on any harder difficulty.  Plus, each weapon handled differently, so each combo had a different level of effect for each weapon.  The third was significantly easier, and I found it far less enjoyable.  First, the ability to mash X and break through an enemy's resistance cut down the difficulty massively.  It felt just I jumped around until I had an opening instead of controlling the battle through combos.  Second, the bow became automagically easy by locking on and slowing time briefly when used in midair.  The first two had a much steeper learning curve, but it paid off immensely when you could clear levels with any weapon and take no damage.  The third was more accessible, but didn't have a deep enough combat system to draw me back in for a replay."
truegaming,3bp876,skinny__panda,3,Wed Jul 1 04:20:52 2015 UTC,"Ninja Gaiden on Xbox has the best combat of any 3rd person action game, in my opinion.  It was easy to grasp, hard to master, and highly rewarding."

I apologies for my ignorance, I have only played a bit of Arkham Asylum years ago, but does the game reward playing perfectly? Another thing i wonder is, in the way you put it isn't any game with a score system EXTREMELY hard since it's hard to get a perfect score in those games?"
truegaming,3bp876,dinoseen,13,Wed Jul 1 17:08:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, reading through this it seems to me like it's just to get as high a score as possible... for some reason. Let me know if you get another reply explaining properly, but yeah, that doesn't appeal to me at all. There's no lose condition, if you don't get a certain score from your combos, it seems you just keep playing? It appears the game doesn't punish you at all for 'not playing it properly', thus it really doesn't cater to those who don't have that playstyle, nor does it alleviate this problem by forcing you into it. I might be wrong, but this seems to be how the game is."
truegaming,3bp876,Wravburn,5,Wed Jul 1 05:07:10 2015 UTC,"I had to read on Wikipedia to know why exactly scores were prevalent in the first place. It seems they were incorporated in arcade machines because arcade games didn't have a beginning, middle and end so it was all about getting the highest score possible. What i don't understand is why non-arcade games with a story mode would even need scoring systems.  It might be like Dr_Donout said for the sake of challenging yourself, but i doubt the majority of people even care. I think a lot more people would care if you were rewarded somehow with the score that you make. In Pac-man you get an extra live when you hit 10 000. I know this sounds ignorant but I don's see much of a point in even having a scoring system in the Arkham games, you don't even get grades like in Bayonetta, the scores are just sort of there.  Edit: BigBadAsh corrected me on this, the score does matter, my bad."

I'm personally not fond of weighing everything you do in the game to a effort/reward ratio.    I think a lot more people would care if you were rewarded somehow with the score that you make.   For me personally that's a design motto that has a negative impact. In many game threads I see people mentioning ""I climbed this mountain/I did this the hard way, what's my reward?"". I always wonder if the act itself, or the view or the freedom of doing it the way you want a reward in itself. Not the trophy/achievement card/experience/gold/item you would get from it.   And for some people a motivator is just having a number assigned to what they just did, so they can objectively compare it to the last time they did it."
truegaming,3bp876,dinoseen,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:47:56 2015 UTC,"It's interesting how fundamentally different we are. Surely we can agree that gaining a new ability or item is more exciting than just seeing a number increase though, right?   To address another of your points, why shouldn't those who 'did things the hard way' get a reward, especially in games where you receive rewards for many other things that are almost all less challenging, or even just involving? I'm also curious though, what negative impact would that design motto that you speak of have?"
truegaming,3bp876,Wravburn,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:57:13 2015 UTC,"Is it? In a sports analogy, there's quite a thrill to break your personal record in <insert distance> <insert sport>  Not really fond of  turning it around, but I'll give it a shot. Simple, making rewards cost time, time that has to be taken from somewhere else in the project.   My personal opinion is that judging every action in the game on the rewards you get makes it too much of a skinner box, instead of an actual game. I can't really relate to the entitlement of 'deserving' a reward for actions.   If doing the thing itself is not fun enough to be doing it, remove it from the game. If it's merely about collecting all the achievements, stick the achievements to fun stuff. Making artificially difficult challenges and sticking an achievement to it, looks like padding to me, and you could rather spend the time on something fun.   Concrete examples: Finishing a party rpg solo, defeating a boss without using weapons, finish a game without getting the upgrades/levelling up. Reaching the top of a mountain in the game. If you like the game, stuff like that is fun to do, for the challenge. Isn't that enough?"
truegaming,3bp876,dinoseen,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:46:55 2015 UTC,"I can see where you're coming from, but in those examples specifically I don't see anything wrong with a reward, particularly if it could serve as an incentive for players that might not otherwise attempt such a thing and end up having fun anyway. Variety is generally quite a good thing, and encouraging alternate playstyles is mostly no different. It can also serve as a little badge of honor, or something like that, so that you can easily look back on what you did. Nobody said anything about artificially difficult challenges :) Can something not be extremely difficult but not artificially so?   I can't really relate to the entitlement of 'deserving' a reward for actions.   I think this is the biggest thing here. While I definitely don't believe it should always, or even mostly, be the case, I can understand it. You do something irregular, you get an irregular reward. Input = output. I do things just for the fun of it, but it's also slightly satisfying to get an achievement or in game reward. Much more so for the in game reward, but you get my drift."

My turn to turn it around; do you see something wrong with not having a reward for certain things, if the doing it is fun in itself. I won't argue that doing it and getting a reward is 1+1 and thus better, but does it devalue your fun if you are not getting a reward?  I was extrapolating on the artificially difficult challenges as I came on the subject on achievements. (and leaving out the though process towards it). There's usually a spread in achievements. Some easy that you will get by playing, harder ones that you will need to go out of your way to get, and the 'difficult' ones. The drive to have this balance, can make for artificially difficult challenges, just to make sure you have an achievement that only the 1% will get."

It could go either way, it depends on how entertaining the rest of the game is generally. Even then, it'd easily go either way. You do have a point about artificial difficulty in completing achievements, but I don't see that as a bad thing. Doing something hard is an achievement, completing the game is often not hard in comparison to other things you can do in it."

truegaming,3bp876,Apotheosis276,7,Thu Jul 2 11:12:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, the game does reward you for playing perfectly, or at least playing well.  High uninterrupted combos, using multiple gadgets and different moves for extra 'variety' points and not being hit increases your combat score, which is immediately converted to XP as soon as the fight is over.  Basically the better you play, the quicker you can buy upgrades and fancier moves.  A lot of this isn't really obvious in the base game, and you absolutely can just do the default spam hit and counter crap to progress but it's just not as satisfying as milking every thug for the points they're potentially worth."

truegaming,3bp876,Camoral,4,Thu Jul 2 22:07:31 2015 UTC,"What is the point of playing a game at all?  Enjoyment, surely.  Most people won't play for scores the first time through a game.  A lot of what I'm talking about is regarding replayability.    If you play and beat the original Megaman, and want to keep playing it, it is going to get REALLY boring eventually.  You can easily beat every boss, you know all the best strats and weapon combinations.  It just won't be fun.    So what do you do?  Just say THIS GAME SUCKS?  No, you MAKE new challenges for yourself.  No hit runs.  Mega blaster only runs.  Speed runs.  Sure it's not for everyone, but it breathes new life into games.    A lot of gamers get hung-up on min-maxing every game they find, then complaining it is too easy.  If a game is too easy, just make it harder for yourself.  This totally isn't for everyone, and that's fine.  So it is not that any game with a score system IS extremely hard, but that it CAN be.  It is all about what you make it.  EDIT: Oh, and about actually being rewarded in Arkham games, I think there are a few achievements tied to very skillful play, but the game itself doesn't really reward it in any way that I can remember."

Interesting point, but I would contest that. QTE implies there is one choice and one answer. Dark Souls involves a myriad of options with vastly different outcomes, and just timing won't save you if you choose bad options, for example constantly rolling without taking a breather to regen stamina."
truegaming,3bp876,Wravburn,3,Wed Jul 1 06:29:39 2015 UTC,"There are some variations of course, but it has some merit. Most boss fights in the Souls games can be viewed as:   Boss does move X; you need to dodge it in way Y. Now you can hit him for Z times.   For a lot of the fights it recognising the attack the boss does by the windup, and reacting accordingly. Which is an opaque way of a QTE. Actually everything Souls games do is 'an opaque way of xx' ;-)"
truegaming,3bp876,dinoseen,6,Sat Jul 4 13:34:15 2015 UTC,"In that sense though, all games are nothing more than tons of QTEs strung together, if you call any point where you need to make an action within a time constraint a ""QTE"". Generally a QTE implies some loss of control over the character, like making attacks or parries in batman and automatically locking onto the nearest enemy. In the Souls game, you always have full control of where your character is moving and what they're doing. It's not just ""hit R1 when the prompt comes on the screen""."
truegaming,3bp876,Wravburn,3,Wed Jul 1 08:16:21 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to make it so rigid. The idea I wanted to push forward - as something to think about - is about choice.   I meant QTE as in following a strict path, and less making choices. I meant to illustrate that with DS bosses, there's usually 1 way to roll to dodge a certain attack. Reactionary. (besides obvious other choices such as tanking the hit or run away). So in a lot of cases you can make the fight abstract into:   Boss does move X; you need to dodge it in way Y. Now you can hit him for Z times.  One QTE in this case not 1 button press, but multiple buttons, but it is nearing 1 solution. You have full control of your character, but in a lot of boss fights it almost is: ""dodge past his right leg when he starts lifting his club in his left hand""."
truegaming,3bp876,dinoseen,3,Wed Jul 1 13:00:51 2015 UTC,You can definitely dodge in weird/other ways and still succeed. It's not as rigid as you might think it to be.
truegaming,3bp876,Wravburn,2,Wed Jul 1 13:34:01 2015 UTC,"You can. And as I said, I didn't mean it literally so rigid. However, looking at it in an abstract way, the boss does prompt you to react in a certain way, what you do with it is your choice."
truegaming,3bp876,dinoseen,2,Wed Jul 1 14:45:10 2015 UTC,"That really sounds like every game to me, which in turn leads into the 'every game is a QTE' thing. Which, honestly, I think goes nowhere."
truegaming,3bp876,Apotheosis276,2,Wed Jul 1 16:57:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying it's a thing to describe the game's genre with, just an aspect that's prevalent. Like 'RPG'-elements, every dog and his game has upgradeble abilities & levelups, nowadays. Does it mean 'every game is a rpg', no, but it's something to describe certain aspects. Let me exchange the term 'QTE-like' for 'reactionary gameplay; the game guides you through action events with visual cues' and be done with it. I guess the term is too negatively loaded.  Anyway, we're going nowhere on an observation."
truegaming,3bp876,Ulti,2,Wed Jul 1 20:42:28 2015 UTC,"I think you misunderstand, I'm not being negative here. While you make a good point about the RPG elements, I think reactionary gameplay is much more deeply rooted in the very nature of games themselves and is much more prevalent than 'QTE-like' games or sections of games. The only 'game'(interactive experience) I can think of that doesn't involve it is a drawing program like MS Paint. To take it to less of an extreme, though, there aren't an awful lot of games that mostly let you do whatever you can think of. There is always something you need to react to. Though, to be fair, it depends on what you mean by visual cues. I'm taking it to mean anything visual that has meaning, which may not be how you intended it."

My style in Dark Souls went through a couple of evolutions that stemmed from eureka moments. At first I was the stereotypical shield turtle who kept their shield up at all times and timidly poked my spear out when I mustered up the courage. I didn't realize at first that by rolling instead of blocking I opened up more opportunities to rack up damage. Then I was a ninja warrior rolling around bosses and ripping their asses to shreds, literally their asses. But eventually I realized that some moves it's better to dodge with careful positioning instead of rolling, and others it's better to block with that old shield I had thrown in my item box. It really depends on your build and play style and I don't think there is ever a definitive single choice in any situation."
truegaming,3bp876,MSpainting,2,Thu Jul 2 22:26:27 2015 UTC,"Oh yes. There are definitely more choices and there's always an optimal path through everything. Different builds lead to different optimal paths.   However. Making it a little bit more abstract for the sake of argument, it can boil down to, and in many cases will, if you learn the bodylanguage of the boss, you will know what he will do, and you will react accordingly. Boss prepares to sweep, roll the other side. Boss prepares to slam, back off. Of course you have the freedom to do whatever, but abstractly speaking, there are similarities."
truegaming,3bp876,Redhavok,2,Wed Jul 1 20:18:51 2015 UTC,"Ninja Gaiden 1 & 2 are my favorite games in terms of the fighting style.  The sense of flow is unmatched by any other game I've played.   The closest any game has gotten to that feeling are the Arkham series and Shadow of Mordor.  At first I turned off the markers because I didn't like the way it looked, but after a while of them off I found it greatly improved my playstyle and enjoyment of the game.  Instead of responding to a visual cue I scan the battlefield, position myself to my advantage, and react accordingly.  My main complaint about Arkham and SOM are that occasionally I attack a different enemy than the one I intended. Also I wish I could I could toggle abilities on/off after I have unlocked them.  Actually that would have saved me a lot of grief in SOM when I do the challenge where you can't brand any body."

It adds a sort of cinematic grace to combat that you wouldn't otherwise have if the player had to be more involved in executing moves. Obviously, this sort of thing has a huge appeal to a lot of gamers but like the guy in the video I just find it to be excruciatingly boring and pointless. I've even watched people on twitch play these games and even though they often have high praise for these games they seem completely unengaged during any combat segment.

I hate games that require memorizing 50 button combos, I get theres a niche for it like fighting games, but I don't want to sacrifice memory learning long command chains I will never see again when I am trying to retain everything else I am learning.  I hate QTEs very much, and felt very unsatisfied ending God Of War boss fights with these, I wouldn't have minded watch it in a quick video, but 'pretending' to do it feels really patronizing and makes me think 'why can't I just do this all the time?"".  Many ""simple combat"" games I enjoy like Zelda, it's not about being complicated it gives you a set of tools, a bit of space, and then you give it a go. Shadow of the Colossus was also very fun even though it was pretty simple. No combos at all. I love learning mechanics but I hate learning arbitrary chains of button presses, especially if a majority are useless in comparison, or I end up never using that character.   Are you okay with this era of Arkham-style brawlers?   No. I think Arkhams style suits Arkham games greatly, everywhere else I have seen it is a bit forced, particularly Spiderman. I think the more people use it the worse it gets, they use how they interpret it which is very simplistic, like Spiderman or Captain America, whereas Arkham is deceptively simple, it's easy to get into but can be tricky to master, but not so tricky you need to avoid having a social life to advance in the game.   I would love to see more Arkham games with this style especially since it is always being refined, but I don't want Zelda or  whatever using it. Build your game around what you want not what others have made. You can elaborate but don't imitate.   Do you want changes?/What would you like to see?   I would like to see each games combat crafted with the rest of their game. Lets saaaay TES, another 3D action game, I don't want quick counter attacks unless I am a melee class, it would be jarring with a spell caster. Combo chains could work for a spellcaster, but with a melee fighter could get tiresome and I'd rather have a 'special attack' loadout you can change on the fly than put in the Crash Bandicoot super code any time I want to do an uppercut.  Context needs to be taken into account too, if you have a lot of focus on stealth(and other things) like Arkham you can get away with it a bit more, packing it down with ultra complicated fighting would make the game annoying to learn, you've already got at least 3 systems going(freeflow, puzzles, predator). With something like a fighting game it is [almost always] PURE mechanic, Angry Birds, or Chess, all very different, but very much purely mechanical.  I don't want to be a super master brawler, I don't want to be a super ninja assassin, I don't want to be the worlds greatest puzzle solver, I don't want to learn the physics of gliding, I don't want to be a top of the line driver changing gears and having a pressure sensitive accelerator, I want to experience what it is like to be Batman, this requires a balance of all of these things in a flowing way."

I guarantee you are no where near close to the limit of memory, you don't sacrifice memory by learning something.   I think you missed my point here, I didn't mean learning one move too many will give me a brain hemorrhage. It's like if I said remember this number ""14399584"", it will take a little bit to memorize that number, you might group parts of it differently like 143-995-84 or some other technique like constant repetition to make sure you don't forget it. This number means nothing by itself, much like a button sequence, and it means nothing outside of the game. I must spend time and effort remembering a whole list of these meaningless sequences for a single character for a single game, and most likely each character and game will have different meanings for those sequences or entirely different sequences altogether.   Whilst you learn these attack passwords, trying to learn other strings of information for applicable study wont be ruined because your brain has melted, but it will be harder, this is why memory competitions exist, because it is impressive to be able to remember a lot of information. Try learning all the combos for a character in Tekken, whilst studying and working, and all the other little things you do in life that require short and long term memorization of sequences, like remembering directions, or your new cell number, eventually your brain will give in and one of those things is going to end up on the tip of your tongue and then forgotten completely.  If I play an action game I don't have to remember piss all about controls, just when to use them, and they are generally logical uses anyway. One of my first game decades ago used x to jump, and square to hit. I still use these controls in many many many games and it is a one button sequence, I'm almost certain to never forget. It's like remembering how to cook an egg vs memorizing an entire recipe book.   No, fighting games are mostly about reading and out-strategizing your opponent. Or I don't know what you mean by ""mechanical.""   Mechanical meaning it's all about particular mechanics that drive the player. You focus on strategy, you aren't concerned about your character or any story(yes I know they have them, but they are in the background), it's not some immersive experience, you are fighting. Like in Angry Birds all you are focused on is getting the perfect angle and speed.   The experience would feel closer the more you have to be involved in each action. What if instead of mashing a button to clear a room, you had to micromanage each action? If you wanted a different attack or movement, you had to press a different input? You would actually feel like you are doing things, that you are making all the decisions, instead of just watching. I'm not saying you should have to press a button for each twitch of Batman's muscles, but you don't think about that stuff anyway when you're doing that. But conscious actions from the avatar should be a result of conscious decisions from the player.   You do have to put in different input for different attacks they just quick to execute. Conscious actions from the player directly result in what Batman does, he doesn't just fight by himself, you press punch and he punches. Perhaps with the jumping across the room thing it could make more sense to select the distant enemy and press the jump button, but to me it makes sense that if you have selected a distant enemy you were going to jump anyway, so might as well merge the the actions. Though it could work if the enemies had some kind of attack to get you whilst jumping, or jumping added some other vulnerability making you need  to choose if it is the best thing to do.   Does mashing buttons and watching Batman fly around the screen really make you feel like Batman?   Mashing buttons wont get you far, I've already explained this to about 50 people in detail. Kind of sick of the whole 'flying across the screen' complaint too, it makes the combat smooth, I don't want to hit a guy, run for 3 seconds, hit the other guy, run 3 seconds and then get another hit on the first guy, boring as shit. Is it slightly jarring? yeah if you're being shallow(for lack of a less insulting word, sorry), but it's fun, smooth, and fitting for a superhero game. If you're willing to believe a billionaire dressed as a Bat that can rip solid steel vent covers off with his bare hands, take on 50 guards at once plus a woman who controls plants with her mind, I think you are capable of believing he can jump quite far in a fight for a few minutes."
truegaming,3bp876,Ponce_In_A_Blue_Box,88,Wed Jul 1 05:03:11 2015 UTC,"I think you're ignoring certain aspects of the system. Sure you can string together the critical hits and very easily clear out a room full of enemies, but you're not even using half of batman's arsenal if you do that. The challenge comes in attempting to use every single move in a combo and keeping that combo going as long as possible. Don't view a room full of enemies as just an obstacle to get past, view them as an opportunity to be as stylish as you can be. You can go through an entire DMC game relying on just your Stinger, but you're missing the point. The brilliance of the arkham system is that you have options. I don't think the game should be blamed for you choosing the easiest one."
truegaming,3bp876,Swank_on_a_plank,14,Thu Jul 2 22:47:12 2015 UTC,"I think this is the reason that the challenge maps from Arkham City really served as the zenith for this combat system thus far.  While I'm sure it was strictly speaking possible to get three medals on each of the challenge maps just using attack and counter and only varying for special enemies, in my experience it's much more rewarding and much easier to get three medals if you do use as many gadgets and combat variances as possible, while also trying to keep the combo going and avoiding any damage."
truegaming,3bp876,Redhavok,12,Fri Jul 3 01:50:37 2015 UTC,"It's funny how something as simple as just good old arcadey points makes the combat system suddenly make sense. All the depth of it is completely and utterly wasted in the campaign - you get some bonus XP, but so what? You can still easily beat the game with just basic combos and counters, the moves unlocked with that XP are pointless so using the variety of gadgets and special moves doesn't matter.     But in the combat challenges you need to keep the combo going and varied if you want a really good score, and that requires a lot of skill. I must've spent about three times more time on the combat challenges than in the campaign because they really let the combat shine."
truegaming,3bp876,Redhavok,3,Wed Jul 1 01:32:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not too sure on that. I remember just not being hit for all 3 rounds, building up the biggest combo I could by using the bat swarm, easily meeting the score requirements."
truegaming,3bp876,MyCoolWhiteLies,2,Wed Jul 1 01:41:41 2015 UTC,"It's not possible even with perfect combos, variation is key to getting at least 2/3 in the challenges. I never used to do many variations on PS3 because it felt awkward but on PC I had to use quite a few to bulk the score up"
truegaming,3bp876,guimontag,58,Wed Jul 1 05:20:15 2015 UTC,"It can be a game design flaw if combat doesn't force (or at least, strongly encourage) you to use all the tools at your disposal. The Arkham series is arguably the best at doing just that, though, mixing in numerous enemies that require certain gadgets or moves to defeat. But even with all the gadgetry, I still felt like I was playing some sort of rhythm game masked beneath flashy animations.   My biggest grievance is how unnatural it feels for your character to instantly lock in and fly to enemies like a homing missile. Maybe stringing together a high combo can be challenging, but it's doesn't really feel like combat to me when you even need to worry about orienting or positioning yourself."
truegaming,3bp876,Meatwad555,16,Wed Jul 1 09:03:46 2015 UTC,"It actually does if you play past the first 10 minutes.   Armored enemies require a beatdown, beatdowns leave you vulnerable to attack and time out, shielded enemies require an aerial attack, shock sticks guys require a dodge overhead or hitting them hurts you, in the new game you can also use a gadget on them depending on how you play, Titan enemies will take far less time with some batarang throws, large enemies must be stunned or triple stunned to even do damage, if an armed enemy is out of range you must use long range attack if you don't want to be gunned down whilst running over to them, ninja people will dodge gadgets so you have to melee them, but they also dodge a lot of physical attacks, then there are the bane enemies, and in the new game there are quite a few vehicle enemies in it, sometimes sentry guns to worry about..  ...and then there are predator encounters..which I wont bother explaining but I will say the Mr Freeze predator boss fight is one of my favorite boss fights of all time, and that very much forces you to use all of your tools(and more).  A lot of people also claim you can just tap counter forever, but this does no damage, it's a cool-looking block, and more like a parry in a combo, but can be used to finish the last surviving enemy sans bosses.   You also have to see it in context of the full game which is not just a brawler, it has combat, stealth, navigation, puzzles, and now racing, pursuit, and tank combat. There's a lot going on, but even without context it's a great combat system."
truegaming,3bp876,BabyPuncher5000,3,Wed Jul 1 04:18:17 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest problem is the game doesn't give the player quite enough incentive to really learn the depths of its systems. When I played Arkham Asylum, I beat the game and thought I had a good grasp of its combat. Afterwards, I delved into the challenge rooms and was surprised that I could barely crack a 1 star rating on any of them. This inspired me to look up some guides online to see what I was doing wrong, and here I realized just how many nuances of the combat I had completely missed. I ended up delving deeply into it in the combat challenges and quickly found it to be one of my favorite combat systems of all time. There were huge point bonuses given for mixing up the combat with different moves and devices. To get a 3 star rating in many rooms, you would basically have to perform a flawless combo the entire time, while incorporating every single move in Batman's arsenal to get a massive combo multiplier. Doing this is actually fairly challenging and very rewarding once you can pull it off regularly.   After getting 3 stars in all the combat rooms, I tried replaying the main game. I utterly dominated the thugs in every fight I was in, and consistently got huge XP rewards. I actually maxed out Batman's abilities about 2/3 through the game. Having this base understanding of the combat has also really improved my experiences with all the following games in the series. The challenge from the combat comes less from simply being able to beat your opponents, but how effectively and stylishly you can do it. I think that fits Batman really well. When I see a thug, I don't want to worry if he will beat me up, but rather just how well I will be able to Batman the shit out of him.  So I suppose the question is, what's the problem? I don't think it's a problem that the game can be completed without fully understanding its complexity. I have a number of friends who love the game and like being able to mash their way through it. However, I think it really helps with the sensation of ""Being Batman"" if you bother to learn the systems better, and I think the games should do more to push players to understand the combat. There are many fine details that are barely explained by the games themselves, if at all."
truegaming,3bp876,guimontag,30,Wed Jul 1 02:00:01 2015 UTC,"Games shouldn't be forcing much of anything, but instead giving players choices.  If they have a combo points system or challenge maps that reward you for using all your gadgets, kudos, but imagine the frustration you would feel if you couldn't play the game the way you wanted to with just a few moves/gadgets."
truegaming,3bp876,ginsunuva,23,Wed Jul 1 04:15:59 2015 UTC,"In this context, forcing/strongly encouraging the player to use the wide arsenal of gadgets Batman has at his disposal means giving them each a useful role in combat. The fact is, as far as I can remember, I never felt the need to use a gadget except for the grappling hook on armed foes.  It's sounds a bit hypocritical to say that the most rewarding part of the game is using all your gadgets but also frustrating for the game to make you use them. If the meat of the game isn't required to beat the game, then the vast majority of people who play the game won't experience the depth. Again, a game design flaw.  Player choice can is actually an issue talking about arkham combat. The problem is there is very little - your character is essentially a queue of preloaded animations ready to home onto enemies at a click of the button. You can add gadgets/magic/whatever to try and spice it up, but at its core there's significantly less player freedom than a less-on-rails system. And because the animations are so costly and time-consuming to produce, character customization around your core kit isn't even an option (Batman will always use his fists, Talion will always use his sword). In Dark Souls, you can run around wearing a loincloth punching dragons to death. You do away for a large chunk of the player freedom that comes in both xyz movement/attack coordination as well as any opportunities to personalize your character."
truegaming,3bp876,guimontag,7,Wed Jul 1 16:46:38 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you haven't played Arkham Knight, because combat has been improved in the way you suggested. In order to stop certain unavoidable attacks from various enemies, you have to use certain gadgets. For example, if an enemy is about to charge at you, you can use the quick fire batarang to stop them. Some enemies will be charged with electricity. Using the bat claw on these enemies will make them lose their electric charge. Some brutes in the game (the large guys) have electrified gloves, and the only way to initially do damage to these enemies is to hit them with the remote electrical charge (REC). I found the combat to be quite a bit more challenging because of these changes."
truegaming,3bp876,branewalker,4,Wed Jul 1 02:17:27 2015 UTC,I never felt the need to use a gadget except for the grappling hook on armed foes.   You haven't gotten very far in Arkham City or Arkham Knight then because there are enemies which require use of the grappling hook and the electrical charge gun in order for Batman to even touch them. All bruisers also require you to perform a stun + beatdown combo in order to defeat them. There are even bruisers with combined attributes that require you to use gadgets on them before you can stun + beatdown.
truegaming,3bp876,Flight714,4,Wed Jul 1 03:12:22 2015 UTC,"I think that forcing a specific playstyle would be a greater flaw.  There's a combo and points system, plus there are sure to be more challenges down the road that will encourage using a wide array of gadgets for those who want to.  Otherwise plenty of them have use outside of combat as well."
truegaming,3bp876,guimontag,12,Wed Jul 1 14:08:02 2015 UTC,Gadgets =/= playstyle.
truegaming,3bp876,Flight714,-2,Wed Jul 1 20:26:18 2015 UTC,"I don't get your point. First, the discussion is about combat so gadget use in puzzles is irrelevant. Second, how is ""giving gadgetry practical use in combat"" synonymous with ""forcing a playstyle""? My point is that the depth the thread starter is talking about is widely absent throughout the vast majority of the game and it's a game design flaw not to open up that depth by strongly encouraging (let's drop the word ""force"") players to explore this supposed depth outside of challenge missions. It's not about forcing the player to choose between playing with or without gadgets - it's moreso ""why bother with gadget combat if there's no incentive to use it aside from a challenge score when it slows me down and is no more effective than hand-to-hand criticals?""  Funnily enough, Arkham does offer a counterpoint in one of its boss fights. The game ""forces"" you to be resourceful and adapt to the circumstances in the Mr. Freeze fight by nullifying the effectiveness of one technique once you use it. This is a great boss fight because you're constantly racking your brain for avenues of attack and really reaching the depth of the system's gameplay.  Unfortunately, most other engagements in the game aren't like this. Taking on large groups of enemies is just pummeling them all to the ground."
truegaming,3bp876,frayjoker,0,Wed Jul 1 03:30:33 2015 UTC,"In your original post you used the words ""force"" yourself, and called the fact that the game hadn't forced players into using more gadgets a ""game design flaw"".  Maybe the game is much easier on the high difficulty levels if you use more gadgets? I haven't tried that but it's possible you're playing on a difficulty where pummeling people with only your fists is fine, whereas that's not the case for harder difficulties or later stages of the game.  As another example: Half Life 2 had certain bosses that required the rocket launcher or gravity gun, but you were certainly free to eliminate the rest of the enemies with whatever weapons you wished, or the environment, or to just drive past some of them.  I don't think anyone was clamoring for the entire game to be just the gravity gun."

If you need to replay a game on multiple difficulties to get the full experience, then I would absolutely call it a game design flaw. Why would I bother playing more of a game that wasn't all that enjoyable the first time through?"
truegaming,3bp876,BabyPuncher5000,2,Wed Jul 1 03:57:56 2015 UTC,"You're misunderstanding what it means to be ""forced"" to use a particular tool in your arsenal. Rexcalibur simply means that he's looking for games that don't add trivial elements to their combat. You can certainly choose to use all sorts of frivolous moves or abilities in any game where they're present. If mastering your arsenal doesn't have a tangible benefit, then the extra options seem useless or unnecessary; mere trappings of complexity, not actual complexity.  Speaking to your counterpoint, there should be significant challenge in running through a game with a minimal arsenal of items or special moves.  In other words, no single move or significantly small subset of moves should be a strictly dominant strategy."

If you tried to get through the game using just your sword and shield, you'd fail to even get past the first dungeon.  Batman, however, seems content to let you get through the whole game without using most of your inventory. I think that's a waste."

truegaming,3bp876,WiseOctopus,5,Wed Jul 1 04:14:06 2015 UTC,"But even with all the gadgetry, I still felt like I was playing some sort of rhythm game masked beneath flashy animations.   Perhaps it's too reductive of me, but at the end of the day couldn't this just be any combat system? I assume the counter point to Arkham combat would be something more button-combo based like Bayonetta or Devil May Cry. But don't those games have their own kind of rhythm? They're not games where you can get away with just mashing one type of attack until everything falls over. You have to read the situation, know what type of move to execute contextually, and press the buttons in the right order with the right timing.  That's still the skill set being used in the Arkham games at the end of the day. I'm not even sold that rhythm games are the correct comparison here, since the challenge of rhythm games often comes from memorizing a complex pattern and executing it as close to perfect as possible. In the Arkham games you're still reacting dynamically to the elements around yourself. You can still get surrounded and overwhelmed for misreading the situation or positioning yourself poorly.  Maybe having to push more buttons, with more room for error just feels more skillful? I think I can appreciate that, it seems to be the main draw of fighting games and spectacle fighters. But now I'm thinking about this out loud, are those the right games to be comparing the Arkham games to? If you come at the series from that direction, of course the Arkham games feel simpler. But compare Arkham Asylum to other similar games of that year.  Assassin's Creed 2 was a big one, and it's whole combat system centered around waiting for a moment to parry, then immediately killing the enemy with a single button press. Arkham Asylum at least gave you a choice of attack types, gadgets, and combo takedowns.  Infamous and Prototype similarly had no finesse in their combat systems, and were focused on the scale of devastation inflicted rather than any kind of precision or timing.  The Saboteur was more shooter than Arkham Asylum, but the stealth amounted to putting a disguise on and pressing x to stab nazis until you got caught and shot your way out.  Maybe it's overdone at this point, but I still feel like that combat system is more engaging than most of the comparable games that don't use it. Especially when paired with other well developed gameplay concepts. I couldn't imagine Sleeping Dogs being as good as it was without the kung-fu-action-movie feel of it's combat, and a big part of that feel was being able to take on a room full of guys with a well-choreographed combo."

However, this combat system isn't used in every game. The games you listed are all ""modern"" and use similar systems, but if you look at the older Star Wars games, or even Zelda, they use a very different system where the character attacks in the direction you're actually standing, not where the closest enemy is. It isn't just ""block until he attacks, attack back"" or ""counter attack"", you have to do all of the movement, aiming and attacking by yourself."
truegaming,3bp876,BigFudge117,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:32:04 2015 UTC,Late game encounters in Arkham Knight require heavy use of all of Batman's equipment. There are even enemy types that cannot be defeated without the use of specific gadgets.
truegaming,3bp876,_HlTLER_,2,Wed Jul 1 07:13:44 2015 UTC,I'd like to see the enemies get more brazen and aggressive if batman is only throwing punches....if batman does string huge combos together and pull off some of the flashier moves they should remain timid and hesitant to engage.  That would discourage the player from taking the easy way out during combat.
truegaming,3bp876,soundslikeponies,3,Wed Jul 1 13:45:39 2015 UTC,"Is that really a good system though? If there's no incentive to do something hard, is there that same feeling of accomplishment when you pull it off? Landing a parry into riposte in Dark Souls is one of the most satisfying things imaginable because it's difficult, rewarding, and outside the norm. It's like the game is telling you ""Go ahead, try and be cool. Nobody really gives a shit."""
truegaming,3bp876,Bap1811,5,Wed Jul 1 20:22:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I think it's still a huge flaw in a game if they're not forcing you to challenge yourself. There's no need to be stylish because there's no reward in that, especially with gaining all your health back at the end of a combat. It would be much better if being skilled at the game meant that you left combats virtually unscathed (if you knew what you were doing) and mashing the attack button would get the job done but just barely, and maybe not even good enough at all for some combs situations. Good game design rewards the player based on their ability and makes use of the environment. I mean you can make any points you like, at the end of the day the proof is in the pudding, Witcher 3 and Arkham knight have shit control and combat systems. And by trying to argue with that it's only perpetuating laziness in AAA games.   That being said, if you play the game and have fun, it doesn't matter."

THat said, you don't really need any of them, but it's inaccurate to say there's no reward.  Plus, it's just more satisfying to play better. That's half the appeal of a lot of fighting games. I've been replaying Metal Gear Rising to try to get an S rank on as many fights as possible. I don't get any reward for doing it, it's just fun. I had a lot of fun with the challenge mode in the Arkham games too."

truegaming,3bp876,I_cannot_press_AMA,18,Wed Jul 1 16:26:20 2015 UTC,It's so rhythmic. It gets you into a groove and then you sort of enter a zen mode where gadgets and bodies are flying.
truegaming,3bp876,Ponce_In_A_Blue_Box,4,Thu Jul 2 22:50:44 2015 UTC,"I would probably forgive this combat if it were rhythmic. Instead there's almost no rhythm to it at all. Most of these games have grievous allowances when it comes to timing windows and sometimes even allow you to indefinitely spam a button for never-ending combos or indefinite invulnerability through dodges.  If these games actually tightened up on their timing windows and required players to read their opponents instead of flashing HUD crap at them like they're some sort of lab monkey, I could get behind it.  But as it is my entire experience with Arkham, Assassin's Creed, and Shadow of Mordor is that they're all style with no substance. At their core they're just poorly designed combat systems dressed up with AAA mocap, sound design, and visual effects. I can't excuse the design of these systems at all. They're hollow, vapid games which don't require thought, skill, or learning."
truegaming,3bp876,barristonsmellme,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:23:08 2015 UTC,"Style over substance is exactly what I think when I see Batman and Shadows.   Autolocks all over the place, non-existant timing requirements, invulnerability windows all over the place, one-shot combos up every other second, no positional requirement, etc etc. I enjoyed the first Batman for the novelty but thats pretty much as far as I could go.  Theres very little actual skill requirement, and thus very little payoff, it doesn't feel good to win fights, it doesn't feel satisfying to beat bosses, its just not fun when most of the game is played out for you and what you have to do is so simple.  But hey, the animations and particle effects look nice and flashy. Makes for great trailers."

truegaming,3bp876,barristonsmellme,10,Wed Jul 1 09:04:30 2015 UTC,I think it helps that these games make you feel more skilled than you actually are.   There's a video that's been posted  a few times of a Street Fighter match where one player on 1℅ health manages to parry/counter multiple (10-20) times in order to survive some super combo his opponent had unleashed. The crowd goes wild when he pulls it off - presumably because they know how difficult it is to do that. In Shadows of Mordor every second fight feels like that - when in fact the timers are so generous/enemy AI so weak that it takes very little skill to defeat dozens of enemies.

truegaming,3bp876,Aozi,6,Wed Jul 1 04:56:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed. To make a comparison:     In Dark Souls, if you're not good the game will kick your ass until you get good. The skill comes in beating the challenges that the game presents. And the game gives you an incentive to get good, the most basic incentive - if you don't get good, you can't continue.    In Batman, if you're not good the game will still let you win and make you feel skilled. The skill here comes in perfecting the combat and really squeeze every point out of the combos that incorporate all the moves and gadgets - but the game gives you no incentive to do that since you can beat it regardless.      I'm not saying the combat in Batman is bad, it's actually excellent, but the campaign it's attached to just doesn't utilize it well at all. There is a lot of skill involved in fully understanding and pulling off those insane combos in Batman but the only time the game really challenges you to do that is in the optional challenge maps, and it's just sad that the meat of the system is wasted away on a dozen optional side missions."
truegaming,3bp876,OurEyesArentReal,7,Wed Jul 1 05:42:01 2015 UTC,"The difference is the story in Dark Souls has to be ""found"" and it's the trial and error and the getting better that makes the game what it is.   With Batman, people love the story lines. Where would be the fun in being slowed down by 2 thugs when you're Batman?  In Dark Souls your character is you, learning the ropes. In Batman, your character is Batman. And we all now Batman doesn't struggle with anything other than smiling."

truegaming,3bp876,sev1nk,3,Wed Jul 1 09:44:09 2015 UTC,"It's basically two different approaches to game design. One that challenges you and makes it hard for you to complete unless you earn it, and another that WANTS you to complete the game and enjoy the ride in doing so. That way you're begging for more when the next sequel comes out."
truegaming,3bp876,Intelligensaur,6,Fri Jul 3 22:23:26 2015 UTC,"I could not disagree more with this guy, at least when it comes to Batman.  He might be right about the other games.  ""Combat for children.  Combat for retards"".  This guy sounds like he's playing on easy.  The Batman combat combo system is one of the most fleshed out on the market.  Lets see this guy get a top 100 leaderboard on one of the Batman combat AR missions and see if he still says that it's combat for children and retards."
truegaming,3bp876,Doomspeaker,5,Sat Jul 4 15:17:49 2015 UTC,"How much do you enjoy combo-oriented combat systems with few button inputs?   I do like these systems, provided the designers actually know what they're doing. What makes or breaks this kind of combat system is enemy variety, and this is why Shadow of Mordor really sucked in terms of combat.   In SOM you had the regular grunt, shielded guy, ranged guy and berserkers. That's it, the worst part is that they all required you to use the exact same moveset which then allowed you to just spam a few buttons to win. This kind of strategy doesn't work in TW3 or Arkham games, why? Because the enemies won't let you do that.  Take the Arkham games and look at the type of enemies you get;   Regular grunts you can just beat up. Grunts with knives who you can't counter unless you dodge their attacks Grunts with guns who will kill you quickly if you don't take em out Shielded grunts that'll stagger you if you try to punch them Grunts with stun batons who you can't counter or attack without getting behind them Big guys who won't stagger if you punch them Ninjas who'll dodge and jump around to avoid your attacks Medics who'll revive downed guys and electrify regular goons   During the early game when you're facing regular goons and maybe few with knives, you can just beat them up. Same if you happen to face 50 regular guys.  Things change quite a bit when those special enemies are thrown in the mix, suddenly you have to prioritize your targets and use specific moves against them in order to take them down. Just trying to spam left and right clicks will kill you quickly since the enemies now have ways to deal with your regular attacks. Just try some of the harder challenges in Arkham city, the ones where you get all those different enemy types coming at you, and the combat gets a lot more difficult.  Witcher 3 has a bunch of other balance issues mainly about level scaling and signs, but try playing it on the harder difficulties like you'd play an arkham game and you will get your ass kicked very fast.    Sure those kinds of systems are easier than something like the souls games or Bloodbourne, but then again the Arkham games or TW3 were never meant to be something like the Souls games. I don't think the main point of the combat in the Arkham games is to be extremely challenging, but rather to empower the player and make them feel like a superhero.  You have to consider what the developers want to convey through the combat system. In the Souls game combat is difficult, anything can kill you quickly and you have to constantly be on your guard. The purpose is to make the player feel vulnerable and small, to convey the idea that you're just a normal guy. In the Arkham games? Devs want to make you feel powerful, they want you to feel like you can take on an entire army because you're the goddamn Batman.    I don't think there's anything wrong with this kind of combat, it doesn't belong to every game but it has it's place and it is fun to play. YOu can do it well or mess it up, just like every other feature of a game."
truegaming,3bp876,daemonicBookkeeper,21,Wed Jul 1 16:18:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why he throws Witcher 3 in there. It may have the same buttons that do the same things. But good fucking luck playing the game on anything but easy just hitting the attack button in the center of a group of 2 or more enemies. If you let anyone surround you, you're fucked. It doesn't matter what button you push. Using your Witcher powers and positioning enemies is extremely important.  Arkham and to a lesser degree, Shadow of Mordor have an excuse as well. They're not 3rd person action fighters. They're score multiplier fighters. Yea, you can bash a single button if you want to win. If you want each fight to be a challenge you play each fight for the score multiplier. I usually restart an area in Arkham if I don't clear every enemy in one combo. Don't tell me their isn't any skill involved in that.  Tony Hawk games had a ""win"" button as well but in terms of gameplay they were fantastic. I'd be in a half pipe challenge, stop in the middle of the half pipe, pop a manual and do manual tricks and destroy everyone because I exploited the game. That doesn't mean the game was broken, I just wasn't playing it right."

truegaming,3bp876,TheGozarian,4,Wed Jul 1 03:54:52 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere that it was based on a rhythm game, which is probably why most people who play it pick up on the rhythmic aspects of combat.   Personally, it took me a while to get down and the variety of moves make up for whatever staleness you may encounter.  You can tackle enemies in a myriad of ways, and the way you can flow between attackers makes me feel like Batman.   Along with the point system, it makes trying to beat your high score interesting, and I can't really think of better ways to accomplish that."
truegaming,3bp876,dinoseen,4,Wed Jul 1 05:29:32 2015 UTC,"I loved it in Arkham and I loved it in Shadow of Mordor. Other games take inspiration from it too, like Sleeping Dogs. Sleeping Dogs's combat system puts GTA to shame."
truegaming,3bp876,TheGozarian,4,Wed Jul 1 04:16:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge fan of that style, but it gets the job done pretty well and I'm fine with it. There are far worse combat systems out there, and at least this one lets a poorer player dumb things down without sticking better players with nothing to do but block and punch.  I've come to appreciate games that are easy to beat, but hard to master. It's awesome that even someone with little skill can get through the game and enjoy the story by sticking to the basics, while the game still has enough meat on it for pros to do really impressive stuff, and at least get rewarded for their mastery by quicker progression, achievements, and the like.   It's also not a trend that's particular to brawlers:   Bulletstorm was a pretty easy FPS for the most part as well, but like the Arkham games, the real challenge is in racking up points by being fancy. Just gunning someone down gets you a fraction of the points a headshot would, and you get even better scores by knocking them into hazards or doing stunts. Final Fantasy XIII got a lot of flak for this (among other things, but that's for another conversation). It took much of the combat strategy away from choosing individual attacks and put it into managing your party through paradigms (Quickly-executed class changes mid-combat; you get up to six slots and in each one your three party members can have any of six classes). For a party of three, there are 56 possible paradigms in the game without even getting into which character has which class and which you control (which has some effect, but usually less than the choice of paradigm itself), but you can pretty much beat the entire game with three of those paradigms. But while those can get you through the game, you're usually not going to be finishing off the toughest enemies and bosses fast enough to get a 5 Star rank, which increases drop rates and is the goal for certain achievements. RPGs have long been the genre where you either strategize or grind, and I think this approach was a lot less oppressive to newcomers.   Anyone else have some examples of genres that are taking this middle ground, where the game itself is easy enough to beat, but the challenge is in other aspects?"
truegaming,3bp876,dinoseen,3,Wed Jul 1 03:48:25 2015 UTC,"Anyone else have some examples of genres that are taking this middle ground, where the game itself is easy enough to beat, but the challenge is in other aspects?   Devil May Cry for example. It's not incredible hard to beat any of the games (save for the original DMC 3, which was quite the noob nightmare), but the real challenge is to get prefect rankings by dishing out stylish combos.  In a similar vein, both Hotline Miami game can easily enough be beaten by people, the the real challenge is chaining together as many kills in a row as possible.  Maybe the Megaman Games starting from Zero? They had various challenges for people to impose on themselves (playing the level under harder condontitions, or not hitting enemies' weakspots) that would reward players with skills or trophies.  The problem is that older games used to hand out content as reward for doing exceptionally well, but under modern design paradigms anything that not every casual player can find is a waste of effort.   Meanwhile, the new wave of Rogue-lile-likes (or roguelite), such as Binding of Isaac or Spelunky, take these ideas as well and use the idea of progress/additional content/scoring gotten by doing better than what is required and revel in it."
truegaming,3bp876,theswerto,7,Wed Jul 1 04:35:19 2015 UTC,"While a lot of games like to use X + Dark Souls! as a description, From Software's most famous games handle this quite well; you need to space enemies, know the attack animations and timings of your weapon, and react to your surroundings. Locking onto an enemy is often suboptimal.  As far as the questions in the OP:  I played Arkham Asylum through to the end but have no desire to play any other Arkham-style Batman game, largely due to lack of strategic depth in combat. Other posters have talked about combat being a place to show off stylish high-score skills, but I would prefer the skill being necessary to win, not to get a higher score. I have no interest in Arkham-style brawlers, but I don't think ""changes"" need to happen; not every game is for everyone, and I don't see why I need to kick down the front door and then demand to be accommodated.  I'd like more combat dependent on skillful manual use of accurate hitboxes with a reasonably deep moveset and an evasion technique. No pounding the button to break a guard or win a clash. Additionally, combo-based gameplay isn't necessarily a bad thing; I quite liked the Darksiders games' combat."
truegaming,3bp876,_reccomended_dose,16,Wed Jul 1 15:34:13 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I think we are in the minority, which is odd considering how frequent I hear the gripe about the dumbing down of games to appeal to a wider audience. The only thing challenging about Mordor on the hardest difficulty was being unaware of an archer. While I do love the game, even the Witcher 3 on death march is quickly becoming a bit of a joke ( I don't know how much more complicated it gets, a little less than halfway I would say). I literally don't even have to learn animations, a fucking red bar flashes and tells me when to push one of two buttons, on the hardest difficulty. QTE's at least mix it up between a handful of buttons.   I am not shitting on anyone who enjoys these games, if everything else about the game is good I am still going to play it. Many people aren't like me and prefer to have the combat be an interlude to everything else in the world, such as a robust leveling system, compelling story, loot etc. I can respect that. I just don't understand why from a developers point of view they cant implement a harder combat system that doesn't telegraph when to hit block or roll. And I am not talking about the more egregious examples such as a flashing bar. Maybe speed up the animations or have multiple units attack (witcher does do this at least) for the people who are drawn to the combat. I want the difficult fights to be harder, not longer."

Also as I've mentioned a few times here, I feel the need to point out that in Batman, you're Batman. You play the game to feel like Batman and to get that sweet sweet story. Batman has a huge arsenal to take advantage of so you can mix things up if you choose, but at no point should a room of random thugs feel like a challenge to Batman.   The ease of combat in Batman can be excused with the HISHE ""I'm Batman"".  Ooh also that the point system is great. If you just want to pummel, pummel. If you want to get higher scores and more exp points then mix it up, add some flare."

truegaming,3bp876,TheBigBadPanda,3,Wed Jul 1 05:56:46 2015 UTC,"""Arkham combat system""  Okay, first of all nothing the Arkham games did was new or innovative, brawlers have had dodge and attack buttons for a very long time - and there are games that have been far more in depth than Arkham.   All Arkham did was give us something we've already had but as a licensed game and do it good (thats the important part). If Arkham hadn't been licensed, we'd probably still know it by whatever original IP it was, but if it wasn't good - or just mediocre it'd be ignored.  It's prevalence is irrelevant to me, the 'combat system' that you seem to give Arkham credit for has been more or less around in some form or another since old arcade beat 'em ups, each game has just changed them up enough in their own way. Saying Arkham did something new is like saying Call of Duty 4 redefined the shooting genre - its misinformed and lacks the greater context of the industry.  Let's take a look at games that came out around the same time. Assassins Creed, while not identical to Arkham was doing more or less the same flow of combat two years before it. You can swing and get combo chains, and if you see someone swinging at you you can counter it and hit harder while avoiding damage - get hit enough times and you lose.   You go back further and you can look at the 'spectacle fighters' like Devil May Cry and Bayonetta (a recent example) that Arkham took its combo counter from. Low combo counts don't do much, but the more you build up the better and more stylish you're going to be doing.  Or hey, let's hop over to sony land and look at the God of War series, which Arkham has definitely taken a few cues from.   Arkham is nothing new, and I'm not worried or happy that its combat style is prevalent - because it's always been prevalent as a staple of the genre."
truegaming,3bp876,thomasjthomasj,3,Wed Jul 1 10:55:57 2015 UTC,I don't find the combat in Arkham particularly easy nor simple (and certainly nothing along the lines of a quicktime event) - I suspect if you do you're a pretty great player of these types of games and you aren't really giving yourself enough credit.
truegaming,3bp876,dankisms,3,Wed Jul 1 16:41:55 2015 UTC,"I like the counter-based combat, it keeps it really fast like an action movie. I'd like to see more interactions with the environment and strategy that comes from that. For example: in the middle of a combo the hero grabs a trash can lid, uses it as a shield, smashes an enemy with it then throws him in the bin with a finisher. Fighting with all kinds of props would make it feel like a Jackie Chan movie and would add variety and strategy to combat."
truegaming,3bp876,Frankie__Spankie,3,Wed Jul 1 09:58:31 2015 UTC,I can't get enough of the combat. I was really disappointed to find only 4 combat challenges in Arkham Knight because the challenge maps were one of my fav things about the first 3.
truegaming,3bp876,Camoral,3,Wed Jul 1 12:07:10 2015 UTC,"One thing you need to remember is that these games usually have more than just combat. The Arkham series has stealth, and now the Batmobile sections. They couldn't put too much focus on one without the other suffering."
truegaming,3bp876,barbonly,5,Wed Jul 1 14:09:02 2015 UTC,"Batman is designed this way...  My sister, whos gaming knowledge consists of the cheat codes for sims2, can tap X & B, never build a combo and still complete the game.  If your a more advance gamer you can look into timing attacks and building combos for special take downs etc.  If your an expert you can insert quick fire gadgets into your attacks and try for the flawless free flow bonus. This is required if your even going to attempt gold on the challenge maps. (Which is ridiculously hard).  The guy in the video is moaning about the 'Everyone can complete the game' layer of dept  and doesn't seem to understand the deeper intricacy of free-flow and it's brilliance in accessibility."
truegaming,3bp876,wolfman1911,2,Wed Jul 1 16:18:09 2015 UTC,"The batman series a great starter game in that respect, it was one of the games that got my daughter into gaming, she could do a decent bumbling batman and was happy to get some of the riddler trophies. While I can have fun being the most kick ass batman I can be, striving for Perfect fights in the challenge modes & going for 100% since my game instincts make it easy to find them all, so it's more a succession of quick puzzles.   I can agree with mack that more options in this regard would be welcome. Mix in an option for more obvious score rank like something out of Devil May Cry: Are you an S Rank Batman? Or add a bit of bite with a hardcore mode. You let the thugs get a couple hits in?  or one good swing with a lead pipe? Your down, they mob attack, game over, get good. I used to watch Mack's vids while back but they were just getting a bit too grating with his pet peeves and this is right along those lines.  One size fits all can be a bit annoying, but if you can't be bothered to give as much of an effort as my daughter does, are you even Worth A Listen?"
truegaming,3bp876,kkjdroid,4,Wed Jul 1 16:34:39 2015 UTC,"I dont like it at all. As long as you use a minimum of effort it is stupid easy and to give an illusion of challenge groups of enemies are often huge and it takes dozens of hits to drop a guy who you then need to walk up to and finish off unless you just want to spam attack a few dozen more times. Combat just drags on forever. It looks fancy, and all respect to the procedural animation magic going on, but from a gameplay perspective its fucking dull.  At least in the Arkham-games the many hits thing makes sense since you are using your fists, but it got ridiculous quick in Shadow of Mordor since your sword felt so dull you might as well be swatting the orks with a sheet of paper.  What i want: Gameplay design which demands a bit of skill and effort on the part of the player. Look at the Jedi Knight games the video mentioned. Look at Dark Messiah: Might & Magic. Hell, look at the first Witcher game. Sure the controls were a bit clunky and it felt slow at times, but it rewarded positioning and preparation and when you walked out victorius of a tough fight it felt like you accomplished something and actually defeated a serious foe who wanted to kill you, not the handholding bullshit in 2 and 3.  EDIT: Actually, also take a look on the melee-combat of GTAIV. Once more it was sort of slow and wasnt all that useful because of how common firearms were, but winning a fistfight actualy took some effort and against a group of enemies (crazy fucking firefighters) you were fucked."
truegaming,3bp876,Alphachicken,5,Wed Jul 1 13:17:01 2015 UTC,"The guy in the video is such a whinger. Worth noting he hated Dark Souls because it wasn't designed for keyboard and mouse, and made a 15 minute video bitching about it. I personally think the simplified combat of the Batman games suits it just fine. I've only played Asylum so I don't know if it applies to the later ones, but the challenge came from planning your path through the levels, deciding when to use stealth and when to go on the offensive, and the game offered a lot of different ways to approach a given situation. It's being used in a lot of games because it's fun and easy to grasp and that's how gaming trends happen. On the flip side, there are games like Dark Souls and Bloodborne and games that are taking inspiration from those titles.  And saying that 'if you strip out the story, the setting and the characters they are all the same game' is just kinda stupid, because those things are actually pretty integral to what a game is. If you strip all the words out of every book they are all the same. Games like The Witcher aren't about combat, it's not the primary focus, so they setting for something that's proven to be popular so they can focus on story archs and world building instead. Red Dead Redemption is functionally identical to Grand Theft Auto, but the games feel completely different because of the setting and story. You can't just write those things off as irrelevant to make a bitching, whining point."
truegaming,3bp876,Alphachicken,3,Wed Jul 1 16:15:23 2015 UTC,"Not my cup of tea. I scanned through the replies on here and it seems those who like this type of thing don't seem to mention things like the polish/fluidity put into these games. Of course it looks and feels badass, I don't see those who don't like this style disputing that. It's a big reason why it's so appealing, because it's visually captivating. You can be a button masher with just enough timing skill to get the chains going and enjoy the game because in spite of your barely good enough skill the engine funnels a broad range of responses into a small set of outcomes.  A few people mentioned things like lock on and rubberbanding. Exactly. Hit the attack button even vaguely in the direction of a target and you'll hit it. 100% of the time, all of the time. In a real fighting game, with input that sloppy you'll whiff it and be punished by a parry or counter. Not to mention the absurdity of praising the ability to chain a combo over multiple opponents as realistic. Yes it looks badass (the whole point of AAA games), but it's not even remotely satisfying to those of us who prefer a little more strategy to encounters rather than just jumping in head on at the right time (not to mention the window given for this ""right time"" is generous as all hell - and again, this is because it's meant to be that way, remember AAA mass appeal).  I'm not saying I want all games to be as tedious as the Souls games (and no, I'm not going to put them on a pedestal either, despite what the fans say about strategy you CAN get around the majority of enemies by simply blocking their first attack and then counter punishing them, which is how I got through the game).  Consider ARPGs. The problem with the older ARPGs like Diablo, Titan Quest, Dungeon Siege, etc is that there's little to no feedback - you pretty much just spam your attacks and chug restoratives occasionally. Minus the combos these remind me pretty much of the type of combat op is asking about; all you need to do is ensure you have your cooldowns pat and that the numbers which make up the thin veneer of stats supplied by the RPG portion tally (i.e. having ""enough"" atk/def). Remove the latter and you have the Dynasty Warrior games, which while highly enjoyable when you feel like plowing through an army by yourself (that badass feeling ringing any bells?), are pretty 1 dimensional when it comes to combat too (all you need to do is figure out what ratio of normal to special attack button presses to use, and then throw in the occasional ""super"" ('musou' in those games) when the appropriate bar fills up).  What would I like to see? It's hard to say. I don't really play games like ones being discussed precisely because I don't enjoy the gameplay, but I play a variety of other games. What works in one game may not in another. There's a place for everything. Just because I don't like said games doesn't mean I don't acknowledge their popularity. They're not for me though. Oh, I just remembered an example - the Tales games. I'd like to see a free roaming Tales combat engine, that would be interesting. And probably not what was expected, but I've sunk hundreds of hours in Graces f alone so there must be something to it. I like the Star Ocean games as well but they tend to be more limited skill assignment-wise, plus there's that long-standing problem of magic users needing to pause and select from a menu every single time. Ugh.  Dragon's Dogma was pretty neat, especially since fighting dragonkin was actually a challenge unlike in Skyrim. I'd be happy to roll around in another DD game, maybe I'd make the melee portion a tad more varied though. And I'd beef up knockback/knockdown a tad as well as parrying, it was still pretty easy to just steamroll enemies when you really outclassed & outgeared them (although to be fair, having played so far it is only logical to expect that early game mooks no longer provide a challenge).  Anyone else remember God Hand, the Yakuza games, maybe even older ones like River City Ransom or Double Dragon? I think it'd be interesting to see how Double Dragon can do with a decent budget and modern engine. (Yeah I remember the later installments were rather crappy.)"
truegaming,3bp876,joeyoh9292,6,Wed Jul 1 11:19:50 2015 UTC,"I think one of the things that has games in the current state for combat is an emphasis on making a game look good with good animations. Just watching the combat, it looks great. Everything is fluid, it all makes sense, none of the animations look like they were bugged (well, if the game is well done anyway.) When you make the combat a different way, it's hard to have the animations look so fluid.   Then also comes feel. I know Dark Souls is generally considered a great game by many people but I felt the combat was incredibly clunky. I know I'm not alone in that regard either. I tried talking to a couple people who loved the game and it seemed like they made it out to be my fault for not figuring the game out. I tried a few different styles and everything just felt clunky no matter what. I only got a few hours in until I was frustrated with that more than anything else and finally stopped playing.   Personally, one that I would like to see is maybe some more people try focusing on good melee combat for a first person game. One of my favorite games for melee combat was Shadow Warrior. It was so well done, it had dodge, it had special attack moves, it felt very fluid. Maybe slow it down a little bit since it was clearly very arcade-y but the potential is there. Then again, I prefer first person pretty much every time over third person so I'm biased."

I'd attribute that to Dark Soul's overall message. You aren't a superhero with an array of gadgets at your disposal. You aren't an Elite Ranger possessed by the ghost of a legendary elven smith. You're a dude with no idea about what's going on. You're scraping by. Combat is not elegant because it's savage. Flourishes, punches, and kicks? Swords are fucking heavy dude.  Beyond that, I'd say the ""clunky"" style is necessary. It leaves more space for thought in the combat. The second you see an enemy get ready to swing isn't the time to dodge. It's the time to decide to move, try and use your i-frames, beat him to the punch, kick him, or parry him. Each of these have different requisites for timing, and each is useful in a different situation. It's fast enough that the decision making is instant, but it's slow enough to happen. Arkham style combat doesn't need this because every choice is the right choice. Dodges are entirely i-frames, blocks don't drain stamina or let any damage through, and you can almost always stagger them before they manage to hit you. It's slowed down because if it were fast it wouldn't have as much of a decision making element, and would just devolve into a fighting game."
truegaming,3bp876,Unwanted_Commentary,6,Wed Jul 1 14:49:17 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls feels incredibly clunky at first because most new players have not been exposed to slow-paced, methodical combat. Every attack had a wind-up animation and recovery time. Its engine can definitely be a little derpy at times as well. Once you become familiar with the way your character attacks and moves, you start to see the game in a new light.  It's a combat system that revolves around important split-second judgments; you need patience to gauge your offense versus your opponent's openings to effectively play the game. Add in all the various attack animations, weapons, and magic for character builds as well as unique enemies and the system is amazingly complex.  If you felt that Dark Souls was too clunky, it's probably because of how slowed down combat is. I can understand not feeling the game if you just cannot deal with 2-3 second attack animations. I'd recommend trying Bloodborne, though, which has a faster pace and more offensive system."
truegaming,3bp876,santsi,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:14:55 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls definitely has that ""old-school"" feel. Even though it seems clunky it of course attributes to its success."
truegaming,3bp876,Forin_Policy,2,Wed Jul 1 08:14:04 2015 UTC,"The thing that bothers me about its use in Shadow of Mordor is that it makes your sword feel worthless. I can sneak up on someone and cut their throat with my broken sword and they fall dead, I can use my. . .spirit bow to take someone out with one head shot, or I can run up at them and whack them fifteen times with my sword."
truegaming,3bp876,LeifEriksonisawesome,2,Wed Jul 1 04:12:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think that the Jedi Knight combat was all that different, really. Block blaster fire, Force Push, execute, repeat. Sure, the difficulty is a bit higher, so you have to block and move manually, but there's only one difficulty setting. He was playing Batman on one of the lower settings."
truegaming,3bp876,arandompurpose,2,Wed Jul 1 05:43:10 2015 UTC,I like it simply because I can literally beat the shit out of the enemies. Devil May Cry was the same and also why I liked the game. You have many ways to fuck people up.
truegaming,3bp876,dinoseen,7,Wed Jul 1 02:25:14 2015 UTC,"I think the whole video was overly negative and very hard to listen to because of it.   Regardless those are some legitimate concerns and it is very reasonable to see how you could be concerned that this kind of game could lead to the rise of more QTE-like combat.   I like to think of this kind of combat as a question of creativity. If all you do is wait for enemies to charge you and then spam fast attacks to bounce between them until they are all dead, thats entirely on you. After all you are a witcher, batman, or a very skilled assassin. Its not a question of whether you should be able to defeat regular human enemies. It would be lore and game breaking if every rent a cop was a challenge.   Instead its a question of how you choose to go about doing these encounters and if the game rewards creativity with increasingly fun fights. I think a good example of this is the Witcher 3. All the options you can take with swords, potions, magic, and bombs are all mostly equally valuable. Also, importantly, not leveling one skill does not make it useless. My warlock build still needed to swing swords, my fighter was still able to cast useful spells, and every build needs to make smart use of potions. This rewards creativity and keeps fights with fodder fresh and interesting.   I think a bad example of this kind of combat is Assassins Creed. Im not a big fan of the series so I might be biased or wrong, but combat in AC all seems to be variations of ""and then I stabbed him in the neck"". This makes for nice animations since you only use one fighting style, but then you are only using one fighting style for 30+ hours. Also the way enemies encircle you in arbitrary arenas when combat starts eliminates the chance for mobile combat styles. This lacks creativity and makes the combat very boring to me.   In a sidenote I think its very interesting how you seem to separate this type of combat with ""few button presses, based around combos and timing"" from the Souls series. Again I may be wrong but I felt W3 was very much like the Souls games in how timing and other types of real player skill mattered way more than stats. W3 also did very little hand holding and on the hardest difficulty fights were very similarly punishing yet fair. Why do you separate them?"
truegaming,3bp876,MrXBob,2,Wed Jul 1 06:41:57 2015 UTC,"Again, I'd like to reiterate that I do find the video a bit overly cynical and don't really agree with his tone, but find he does bring up some interesting discussion points.  To be fair, I haven't actually played the Witcher 3 (my poor PC can't handle it) so I cannot say for certain, but from the gameplay I've watched, it definitely feels simplified from the Witcher 2 and there seems to be a lot of autolocking and questionable rubberbanding to enemies. It's probably the least relevant example of the Arkham system, but still seems to have been simplified in favor of a more cinematic experience. Maybe I'm wrong about that."
truegaming,3bp876,GeorgeRRZimmerman,7,Wed Jul 1 13:49:17 2015 UTC,"As a long time Witcher fan W3 blew W2 out of the water combat wise, as well as in every other dimension.   I played the first couple hours of W3 on easy/normal-ish difficulty and had the same impressions you did. Then I ramped the game up to ""Death-March"" (very hard) and it turned into a right proper game instantly. It could very well be that a game can be simplified and cinematic and a good example of this combat style depending on what settings you play it on. I noticed from all of the shots the video used for W3 were on low/normal difficulty, which further made me doubt the validity of that one."
truegaming,3bp876,DanAugustus,4,Wed Jul 1 01:54:30 2015 UTC,"I've always been a fan of realistic technique-based fighting games.  Life bars and combat systems that only make you aim in a direction and press the attack button are boring.  Especially brawlers with super powered heroes that can take out five guys at a time, it's too safe, too easy and gets old quick.   Some of my favorite fighters are The Warriors, the Bushido Blade series, Die by the Sword, really anything that requires thinking more like a fighter and less like a gamer.  I like the realistic depiction of combat and the possibility of ending the fight at any point with proper skill (or conversely, being cut down quickly if you're not on point)."
truegaming,3bp876,TminusTech,6,Wed Jul 1 02:09:02 2015 UTC,"Okay so first thing's first, the guy has no idea how the combat actually works. He even admitted to it.   I didn't even do it, the game just did it all for me   Okay. This is gonna be a damn long explanation for what should be common sense, but here we go.  1) You're Batman. If you want a Batman game where you don't beat the shit out of people for the combat, you don't want a Batman game.  2) The combat is made primarily for mass-appeal (anyone from 3-80 could play this if they wanted), but is balanced such that it's more fun and interactive if you care to learn it. Ever played a Devil May Cry game? Same concept.  3) There's nothing wrong with ""easy"" combat in a game so clearly developed around the story. Shadow of Mordor honed in on the combat much more and lo-and-behold is much harder. You can't just fight an unlimited amount of enemies there.  4) AAA is AAA. They're not the only games on market. If you want AAA games that have intense gameplay, you simply will not find them. Bloodborne was an incredibly rare change from this. Many, many non-AAA games have a huge variety of combat. Just do some research (Blade Symphony, GunZ and Overgrowth to name but 3 off the top of my head. Final Fantasy <X, XII, XIII and XV are vastly different. DMC, Bayonetta. Chivalry. etc Heck, Godhand was canned by critics because it dared to be difficult).  5) Batman games can be tackled how you like. If you want the easy ""press attack to win"", that's up to you. Personally, I prefer to have fun with the combat and use the many, many choices given to me, as well as try to both win fights ASAP as well as win fights with a high score. If you choose to ignore 90% of the combat and then accuse it of being bad combat, that's just unfair.  And finally to talk about what you asked:  Games aren't heading towards this at all. CoD is popular, is every shooter CoD? Fifa is popular, is every football game Fifa? No. Game design doesn't work like that. I'd be surprised if there were many other developers using a similar system.  If you want to see what the Arkham combat style is capable of, watch a high-score fight or a speedrun."
truegaming,3bp876,BattleStag17,6,Wed Jul 1 02:16:07 2015 UTC,"Arkham's combat is absurd.     Inputs windows are extremely generous.   Enemy places themselves in such a way that minimize ambiguity for the auto-target system. One button press and the game will practically teleport you half way across the goddamn room, choose an attack animation for you, all the while automatically giving you copious evasive measures while the game does everything for you.     It pretty much throws everything out the window other than positioning and very simple reflex.  I started the games on hard mode from the get-go and it still feels like easy mode.    I can't even imagine playing the game with huge ass prompts to counter enemies.  If gamers feel like a badass playing a glorified whack a mole game then more power to them I guess."
truegaming,3bp876,SpawnPointGuard,4,Wed Jul 1 01:38:50 2015 UTC,This is the best thing I've ever seen in this subreddit.  Haven't seen a game that has decent combat/positioning/offense/defense/timing.  He's completely right on every point.  Combat games like SWBF2 and Jedi Academy put modern games to shame.
truegaming,3bp876,Doomspeaker,0,Wed Jul 1 04:48:11 2015 UTC,"There was also recently the video posted pointing out what's wrong with the new Thief.  I'm glad too see that people are waking up to these shitty practices in contemporary AAA games. The settings in Assassin's Creed games are awesome, I want to play them, but all the ridiculous overbearing accessibility makes it a non-experience. All the popping up button prompts in every damn part is another one that breaks any immersion. Where's all the discreetness? I don't want to just follow directions, that's not my idea of fun. I want real games that grab my attention, doesn't take me for a complete idiot and most of all doesn't remind me constantly that I'm playing a game."
truegaming,3bp876,djsekani,2,Wed Jul 1 05:12:33 2015 UTC,"I'm glad too see that people are waking up to these shitty practices in contemporary AAA games   There's no need to be hostile. If you don't like these types of games then you can just not play them. There are plenty of action games that offer alternatives to this style of combat. It all comes down to a matter of player preference, and not ""shitty practices"""
truegaming,3bp876,dinoseen,2,Wed Jul 1 14:28:38 2015 UTC,"Personally, I still think Sleeping Dogs is the paragon of combat. I enjoy a Dark Souls, but it's an absolutely entirely different sort of combat and I don't think it fits well in the least outside of the fantasy genre, or wouldn't really fit well outside of those games."
truegaming,3bp876,skinny__panda,2,Wed Jul 1 22:08:04 2015 UTC,"I remember the same basic style of combat in games like Prince of Persia and Mark of Kri and I really enjoyed it in them. Now it does seem played out as those games were over 10 years ago I think and while PoP: Warrior Within wasn't exactly loved (I liked it) the combat was really fluid, brutal, and awesome. I much preferred it over Batman and far more of Shadows of Mordor which were serviceable and bland respectively."
truegaming,3bp876,sp668,2,Thu Jul 2 19:36:37 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say it's similar to PoP :(
truegaming,3bp876,MeMosh,2,Wed Jul 1 06:54:32 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't find this type of gameplay particularly enjoyable. I played through Arkham City and always felt like the combat was too simple to be rewarding. The clearest example of this is when I was locked in a room with 50 enemies and had to defeat all of them. At first, I was intimidated, but it didn't even turn out to be a challenge. Just clicking with a rhythm was enough to fly across the room over and over again punch/kicking people in the face, with an occasional block thrown in. It felt more like a quick-time event than actual combat.   You haven't discovered the real depth. Yes you can mash your way through it - but the reason it's not fun for you is because you're choosing to play that way.  Play the challenge maps and discover how intense and satisfying the combat can be when you're required to mix up your style (I didn't even use all my gadgets in that video but it's far better than hitting X and Y over and over). Getting a flawless freeflow combo (never being hit, never missing a strike) and using all the gadgets and moves at your disposal.  I agree with people who say it's the best combat in gaming. I've never played anything else so smooth that looks this great and feels so powerful and entertaining.  I totally disagree about this kind of combat being ""simplified"", and suggesting it's even remotely like a QTE is quite disrespectful to work that goes into creating a system like this.  TL;DR You're basically disliking a combat system after your own admission that you don't bother using 90% of it."
truegaming,3bp876,Kessra,2,Wed Jul 1 07:36:34 2015 UTC,"Wow, nobody's going to mention Bayonetta or any of the Devil May Cry games. This kind of combat system was invented and perfected forever ago.  And here we are on TrueGaming, devolving into yet another argument about which of your favorite 3d person sword and sorcery game fails to hit the mark for realism."
truegaming,3bp876,Zulban,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:16:43 2015 UTC,"I think the concept is fine, but if the player has all the cues for pressing buttons presented to them, it can become very bland. Maybe it is best to force the player to look at enemies to see when they will attack, liek seeing them raise their weapon. I remember the combat in Prince of Persia: Sands of Time very fondly. Too bad the counter was very hard to use in that game. Wall attacks were very effective though, and context-sensitive. The fact that extracting sands from an enemy left you vulnerable, also means you had to look at where the enemies are. (Am I remembering this right?) Of course, the best part of that combat system was the use of sands, and retrieving them to use more powers. Which was very interesting because sands are also used as 'extra lives', forcing the player to use them with care."
truegaming,3bpzn5,FroDude258,10,Wed Jul 1 05:30:31 2015 UTC,"I'd say the departure from plug and play is something that has slowly disappeared as consoles had more home menus and hubs. For Nintendo, the GameCube was still a plug and play device. PS2 and XBox had home screens and menus to navigate, if I remember correctly. Even the Nintendo DS and the PSP had them as well. This slowly shifted these devices from dedicated gaming consoles to entertainment devices (with a still heavy emphasis on gaming, of course).  I would say where things really changed was with 7th gen (Wii, PS3, and X360). At this point, we were seeing heavy usage of online shops, subscription based models, and internet multiplayer. It was a lot less about local multiplayer, and more about gaming online and DLC was starting to become a thing.  On the PC side, we see PC becoming a much greater player in gaming with Steam. With the modular format of PC, people can easily upgrade graphic cards and other components. This has made the gaming console in itself something that had to continue to improve technologically to actually stand against the higher specs of the PC. For what it's worth, the current gen consoles (save for perhaps the Wii) are basically computers with an OS that have a dedicated purpose for gaming.  Game consoles are no longer hardware in and of themselves; they're dedicated computers, for the most part.  I would say there is still hope for gaming for those without good internet. Hotspots are becoming more frequent, as well as public wi-fi. That at least gives the channel to purchase games."

truegaming,3bpzn5,Peter_File,12,Wed Jul 8 12:05:55 2015 UTC,"One thing to consider is how we as a society have kind of embraced technology.  That sounds all highbrow and shit, but I remember the absolute turmoil my Playstation caused because the composite cables it required weren't able to be plugged into our television. It took my dad digging a smaller TV out of the garage to save Christmas.  A fact he was rather proud of as we learned about all of our relatives who were dealing with absolute anarchy over a lack of television compatibility. It normalized a bit for me in the next generation although I was an adult by then and knew what kind of television I needed. HDMI caused another little hiccup though, as has Online only.  I'm sure others have had rougher/smoother transitions, but a lot of it is familiarity. If you're a bit out of date in technology plug-and-play has never truly been a thing.   Granted upgrading a television was largely seen as a valid evolution of decaying older tech, while upgrading to always online is seen as an extra negative monthly cost. Mostly because 'Always online' only applies to gaming compared to better televisions being more useful for gaming and general cable viewing."

That's the kind of power they've wanted for ages. Probably not. Even if consoles go the way that PC has been heading the past few years, there's still almost 40 years of back catalog, and even the occasional brilliant indie game that's not yet another Interactive Movie or pixel-based physics platformer, that you will likely be able to find something to play."
truegaming,3bpzn5,Targren,12,Wed Jul 1 05:48:58 2015 UTC,I don't really consider PCs to be plug and play like consoles of old were. You can't just be handed a random PC and expect to be up and going without a bunch of OS level fiddling whereas that was certainly the case for older consoles.
truegaming,3bpzn5,randfur,11,Wed Jul 1 07:27:27 2015 UTC,"PC isn't plug and play, but it's a whole lot better now in general than it used to be.   A ton of drivers for common hardware comes through windows update, it may not be the absolute latest version, but it will usually be a fairly recent stable version, and of course windows update in the background for the OS itself. Drivers from the manufacturer are pretty straightforward, and there's auto-updaters for those too. Steam and other services handle the nitty gritty download, setup, and updating, those games not on such a service will be a simple 'keep clicking next' setup and may have their own auto-updaters.  Games will often choose sensible defaults, they can find out what hardware you're running and look up what it's capable of if the developer has profiled hardware (any professional development that gives the slightest damn about the PC version will have done this).   You may not get something that's 100% optimal, and it's certainly not universal among all games because there's no certification to go through, but games will 'go' when you tell them to without screwing around.  Compare that to days of yore:    Setups from disc was the only way, multiple discs if it was big because PC game distribution generally lagged behind adopting larger capacity discs. I hope you don't mind being asked if you want to install gamespy arcade. Updates that you have to go and find yourself on the internet, and if you were doing a fresh install you probably had to find a series of patches, and apply them one after the other. A game having defaults for your hardware would be as likely as winning the lottery, most games would choose low defaults and expect you to go from there.   The thing with PC is it is what you make it, and I think a lot of people go looking for complexity."
truegaming,3bpzn5,plank_,9,Wed Jul 1 09:35:27 2015 UTC,"Compare that to days of yore:    Don't forget boot discs!  Oh, and opening ports used to be a pretty big issue, but has mostly been solved in some manner or another."

As someone who is somewhat new to PC gaming: why was this such a hard thing?  Wouldn't you just have to go to the game's official website?  Did you actually have to hunt for them, going to shady websites with mediafire links and so on?  I can't imagine that the patches and updates would even exist if the devs didn't atleast have an official source."
truegaming,3bpzn5,falconfetus8,4,Wed Jul 1 14:48:50 2015 UTC,"The devs would have an official source, but often it would be a poor server or limited servers, so you'd go hunting or be linked to mirrors like fileplanet or another file host, and then deciding which of their servers you're going to get a good speed from.  Then you've got the task of working out the patch sequence, and some developers were better than others for it. Can you get an all-in-one big patch to go straight to the latest version, if you're only one version behind is there a small incremental patch, etc.   Take a look at the patches for Company of Heroes(and that's just v2) or Dawn of War. Relic also have the tendency to patch their games so they make alterations to large resource files, so before steam had delta patching a patch would mean downloading a lot of data.  This was extremely fun at lan parties /s. Steam sucked because it needed an internet connection shared across all attendees and a good amount of bandwidth, but it's better than sorting out ""I'm on version X, what do I need to get to Y"" or ""why can't I join the server?"". Great fun when the developer releases a patch just before the lan and only one person has it. Now you just yell at people to patch before the lan, or get a decent connection, or with the newer http distribution the organizer can cache any updates locally."
truegaming,3bpzn5,plank_,3,Wed Jul 1 15:21:48 2015 UTC,"Well. Back then the Internet was a little bit different. Often you had to get the patches on a CD in some magazine.

truegaming,3bpzn5,SingleBlob,2,Wed Jul 1 20:16:05 2015 UTC,"It wasn't that hard, but we didn't have standards. One publisher might bundle all the updates into one latest package which you could just download. Another might require you to download several and install them in order.  But yeah, you didn't have to go to sites like mediafire. I mean, back in the day patches weren't really a thing. Nobody really expected them. You installed the game, you tweaked your setup, that was it. Fiddling with patches brings to mind the very late 90s and early 2000s, and they quickly got streamlined. Maybe I'm a power user and don't see any issues, but really - it wasn't that hard. I think the confusion also stems from the fact you often needed to update your drivers, which isn't really much of a thing anymore (it's greatly streamlined nowadays, back then you'd search for them just like you searched for the game's patches)."

truegaming,3bpzn5,Targren,2,Wed Jul 1 07:29:49 2015 UTC,"I would absolutely expect to be up and going without ""a bunch of OS level fiddling"".  Even with custom built computers, OS installs are relatively painless today and completely usable with little to no configuration.  Any prefab computer worth its salt should be ready to go right out of the box.   Apart from the required internet connection, and the wait times for the OS to update, game to download, and Steam to set up any environments you're missing, the process of installing a new computer is very similar to setting up a new old-school console.  Sure, without the fiddling things won't be optimal, but that's not a requirement.  Instead I would consider that a bonus.  Console configurations and controls have rarely been optimal either, but you don't have the option to tweak them in the first place!"
truegaming,3bpzn5,KoboldCommando,7,Wed Jul 1 21:43:49 2015 UTC,"You could play most games without patching and probably never even notice a problem. Not every game comes out like Assassin's Creed Unity, it's usually a matter of tweaking balance, fixing triggers, or patching out some one in a billion case where pushing the wrong button while X and Y things are happening can mess up the game.  Consoles may have lost the plug and play aspects of you having the best possible experience even without internet access, but they haven't quite gotten as complicated as computers. If the game says it's for the PS4 or XBox One, you know you can pop it in and be able to play without replacing parts, and that you'll get the same graphics and frame-rate as everyone else who's playing. Games may look nicer on my computer (for however many years after an upgrade at least), but sometimes it's just nice to know a game is going to work without having to roll the dice.  Handheld is still pretty decent for plug and play gaming, though. Games are simpler, so game-breaking problems are even rarer, and if they do get updates, it's a lot easier to bring your 3DS to a place with wi-fi than to lug your console around."

Whether this functionality be from updates to the system or patches to physical games.   Not true. My friend is in the same kind of situation you are, and he's only a two-minute drive outside town where he could get good internet. He has a PS4 and he can still play most titles. A lot of the discs come with system updates on them if necessary, too. Will the internet connectivity give you a better experience? Definitely. But is it necessary? No.  As for your questions,   Plug and play is still a reasonably usable feature for consoles. Priority? Well, probably not. I take my PS3 over to my friend's place several times a week because he missed out on a lot of PS3 exclusives, and there hasn't been a problem so far. I don't think it'll become inaccessible, but it'll definitely become harder to keep up with as a hobby. As the medium evolves, so does our presentation of it. I'm not a fan of saying that ""physical media is dead"", but it's definitely not as big of a deal as it was previously. We have ways of moving large amounts of data around pretty easily now, as long as your connection is stable. And in the interest of cutting costs, I can see companies using physical copies less and less. Dropping discs altogether? I can't see that being a possibility right now, but it's at least a scenario to look at in the future."

Everything needs to be installed, verified, patched, etc. Good luck trying to plug in an xbone or ps4 and trying to play a disc, immediately with no wait. started with PS3 and x360 (7th gen) as broadband internet became more widely adopted. for new games, absolutely. PC is pretty much at the point of operating exclusively through digital stores. Even when you buy discs, you have to download and connect through origin or steam or whatever. Ps4 and xbone require an internet connection to really function at all, despite what some may say/think. I'm not sure about nintendo and the Wii-U. Since theyre online presence is such shit, I like to think they are much more plug-n-play friendly. But you absolutely need to update Wii-U firmware via internet connection.   the 7th gen might as well be the last gen of consoles I own. They have turned into glorified closed system PCs. I'm thinking from here on out I may be PC-only (unless the Nintendo NX really entices me).

Now it is, and the reliance on internet and patched content only has me lamenting for the solidarity of plug-and-play.

The view of ""I want a console so I don't have to deal with PC problems"" was accurate from PS2 to previous, but starting in PS3 era and ESPECIALLY now, it's basically moot.   I've had more crashes and corrupted data on my PS4 than I have on my PC in the last year or so, during normal gameplay and use.   If a PC has more errors, it usually because you're trying something a console could never do at all, like run a REALLY old game, or install Mods, or emulators, INI tweaking, etc. OR, it's a terrible port which is a whole different issue.   Edit: The primary thing that PCs have to deal with that consoles never do is graphic settings. Once you've had your PC for a short time, it's easy to figure out what you can run. As a PC player, I prefer this myself since I can choose if I want worse FPS for better visuals, rather than rely on a dev to make the decision for me/everyone. So consoles still have that... I wouldn't consider it an objective plus though. That's better for some people, bad for others."

truegaming,3buakm,ithinkineedanap,6,Thu Jul 9 14:47:04 2015 UTC,"I disagree whole heartedly with your assessment that new graphics hurt imagination   Well, there are two things going on in ops post.  Remembering a game looking better than it did.  How we felt about a game's visuals are connected to how it stacked up against other games at the time. When we revisit an old game, we look at it compared to recent games and modern expectations. So usually when we revisit old games we remember them looking better than they did, but I don't think this is so much about imagination as it is about ... the game looking good compared to other games we played back then.  Imagination filling the holes left by abstraction.  The more abstract the representation of people/places/actions, the more our minds tend to fill in the blanks. The less abstract the representation, the more literally the brain interprets the image. Older games tended to need to present stuff in a more abstract way because they couldn't entirely show the details. Sometimes the abstraction was text, other times it was low detail images or other techniques. You can still see this kind of 'abstract' representation being effective in some modern games like Pillars of Eternity: http://i.imgur.com/tCNUkkM.jpg  Here they use abstract, rough, sketch art to present various scenes or interactions, and like the headline says - your imagination fills in the blanks. Sometimes this can be far more effective than showing a realistic, high detail view (and sometimes it falls flat).  Op is entirely correct about the second point, that old games had to rely on more abstract representation of the action which lead to your imagination filling in the gaps. He unfortunately mixes up this point with the effect of nostalgia and memory."

It's hard to provoke that kid-like imagination for an adult, and it's going to remain as such until we get open world games that that respond with complexity to player actions, without being multiplayer.  Eve is a good example. If you could program NPCs so that it could reproduce how wild that game changes according to player driven politics it would be groundbreaking.

An NPC is literally just a collection of data that the player can interact with in a certain way. NPCs already contain a ton of values, most of which represent values much better than what a boolean is capable of. Games like Fallout keep track of what NPCs think of you with a scoring system already several levels more complicated than what booleans can even represent. Shadow of Mordor, for example, keeps track of captains dispositions to each other, previous meetings, rivalries, etc.   These are already far more complicated than booleans.

truegaming,3buakm,meikyoushisui,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:45:58 2015 UTC,"Speaking from non-gaming software dev experience: you could probably track the game's state (charX is alive/dead) with only booleans, and a single decision could probably affect multiple booleans if the story branch had more than two options.  For example, choices could be the following:   Race A survives. Character A dies, Character B dies, Character C lives Race A dies. Char A lives, Char B lives, Char C dies Race A dies. Char A dies, Char B lives, Char C lives.   All three of these choices could effectively be stored in 4 boolean variables, even if they're complex. If you isolate their statuses from the choice, it also means that other events can affect their statuses, without needing to be part of the same choice too.  As far as it being bad for memory, each boolean could be stored in a single bit. I doubt that the game developers get this complicated with memory anymore, but if needbe you could group them together so that a single byte read could get you relevant information for statuses you're likely going to need to refer to together."
truegaming,3buakm,Acidictadpole,6,Mon Jul 6 13:35:36 2015 UTC,"You are right and wrong at the same time, and I completely disagree with your vote score. This post is worth discussing.  For the longest time I have suspected the same thing, but lately I have come to appreciate the strong emotional push that is supplied by beautifully crafted and painted game realities.  It's true that the more empty the page, the more room is there for your imagination. Undeniable hard proof of this: Books. Playing a game that e.g. doesn't use much (or any) textures has a stronger otherworldly feel to it than even the most alien but well-textured game, because the latter still says ""Natural reality."" while the former is by all standards unnatural. Hence the emotions evoked are different and possibly stronger ones. On the other hand, the voice with which the game expresses how its reality works, what cause&effect network is at play, is much quieter in less graphically developed games, so the part in your imagination where these meanings gather aren't bombarded with strong statements, there is just insinuation going on, triggering you to fill the gaps yourself. A very extreme example of graphically primitive games in which I personally was able to experience rich emotional content: (free PC implementation of) Mercenary etc. - http://mercenarysite.free.fr/mddclone.htm  Contrary to the above which I thought about often in recent years with better graphics, I have learned to see the benefits of those: If we're just talking landscape (grass etc.), for example, then this is a topic where the imagination of the majority might have made very similar choices except with weaker strength in comparison to what the fully shaped and textured world causes in their heads. Other areas of the game could be less explicit, so the player's imagination could be more playful and active, building on the strong emotional fundament of the landscape. But if a game is more elaborate, it usually is so in most of its areas, incl. the texts being spoken by proper actors, so the described scenario happens rarely, or if so, the areas where the player can fill in imagination are few, and maybe this causes them to be less triggered to fill anything in in the first place.  In a way, the difference is really between reading a book and watching a movie. Both have their advantages over the other, and the book guys could certainly call the movie guys lazy and their experience less rich. What their experience otherwise probably is, though is more intense.  One thing that's unquestionably objectively true about better modeled and painted game worlds: They contain a lesser percentage of interactive objects. Prime example: Doors. Nowadays, it has become normal that when you first play a game, you more or less consciously go through the process of learning which style of doors is intended to be purely decorative and which style is interactive (aka gameplay-relevant). Doors are only an example. Just play Deus Ex: Human Revolution and wonder about the interesting decorative but completely not interactive objects placed everywhere. It's like standing in front of a candy store's window as a kid with no money.  It's of course understandable that this is so, but it is a negative. Experienced Desktop Publishingers (like me :P) who learn e.g. about layout and typography know that the brain, when in a new ""room"" (e.g. in a new game), tries to find patterns, and there's a lot of subconscious stuff going on, one that Typographers know needs to be considered even if the person doesn't ever know consciously what it was that made a certain advertisement less attractive to them (e.g. wrong letter spacing, ill-chosen white space on the page, too many fonts, too long text lines).  With this in mind: Realize that if a game world communicates ""most of the stuff here is only decorative, and it is now your work to distinguish between interactive objects and pure fluff"", it breaks the fourth wall, burdens the player unnecessarily, and makes the world unrealistic. Compare that to a less designed world like the procedurally generated ones in Minecraft: Every object you see counts. Most are unimportant because there are so many of them, and there are so many types you personally might not care about (sandstones, flowers, ...), but nothing is facade, everything is real. A dirt block isn't just there to tell a story, it is a block of dirt, and every single one works as your intuition expects it should: The world is real.  I had more on our pattern recognition and the value you see when knowing that every object is somewhat real, that there is no fluff, but I can't concentrate at work right now."
truegaming,3buakm,king_of_the_universe,15,Fri Jul 3 11:12:51 2015 UTC,"I can't say that about older graphics. In my opinion graphics will always give you a hint how things look like. I noticed this difference when I started playing ASCII games. Just reading about things can make a huge difference, especially when trying to create something strange (Screaming mout metal from Dwarf Fortress for example). I would suggest anyone to try a ASCII game / Textadventure / MUD and see the difference (or read it ;))  What I noticed is, that the better graphics get, the more boring the worlds seem to get. When I think about the different worlds / planes in Baldurs Gate 2 (Cloud Air Dimension at the beginning, Circus) even the highly praised Paint and Dream World in Oblivion didn't came close.

He's also completely disregarded the fact that, as technology progresses, more and more creative people have more ways and means to tell the story they want to tell and express themselves as deeply as they wanted. PT just told one of the most horrific, visceral and genuinely terrifying stories in gaming, and it did it with near photo-realistic graphics. I think OP's just trying to sound niche. ""with FF XIII, I see what I see"" i'm sorry, but if an artist showing you something means you can only take the literal face-value meaning of it and that bothers you, then you're the one at fault, not the gaming industry."

I agree with you with P.T, photorealistic graphics are going to be great for the horror genre because horror is scariest when it is most believable.

truegaming,3buakm,HalfBakedHarry,5,Fri Jul 3 02:26:40 2015 UTC,"Of course it's all subjective, I wouldn't be disagreeing if it wasn't. I'm just saying, the games from his childhood looked like that because of technical inabilities, not an artistic choice. By definition, gaming technology has been progressing and improving, all that does is add opportunities and possibilities; not take them away. he's written this post under the assumption that everyone's be-all and end-all is photorealism, whereas that's not true in the slightest. he's also not taken into account that once photorealism is achievable, there's nowhere gaming can't go. I'm using PT as an example; that was a genuinely, profoundly harrowing experience, and it didn't use ""room for imagination"" or a hugely stylised artistic direction to do it. it showed that art can cause a deep emotional response whilst resonating in the real world by using photorealism. It didn't take away from the experience, i wasn't complaining cause i just ""see what i see"", a game developer had an artistic vision and decided to use photorealism to portray it to great effect.  it just annoys me how older people (or younger people who fancy stroking their egos) say that progressions in technology are holding gaming back, that somehow the utterly shite early polygons of the PS1 age were more artistically resonant than the new, more polished visuals of today. that just simply isn't true. someone could make a game with those older graphics in a heartbeat, and some people do. the revival movement is bigger than ever; it seems that every other game released is an indie pixel art throwback. posts like this show a mentality that i think is damaging to gaming, it's the same with music. ""ugh why can't people listen to real instruments instead of this electronic shit!"" i see it every day. without those electronic production techniques, we wouldn't even be able to record those instruments you hold so dear. without that production technology, that favourite rock song of yours wouldn't have even been put together.

Arguably in more detail if it's more detailed. And more importantly in a more subtle way. If you only have three objects in a room you know these three are important. Like you know the one undetailed piece of brush in a cartoon is going to move soon. Whereas a more realistic looking environment can integrate story-relevant details much more seamlessly.  We're at a point where graphics are flexible enough that we can't just present mysteries like ""I wonder how these five obvious objects fit together"" but also things like ""something feels wrong here but I can't put my finger on it (yet)"".  Obviously, photorealistic graphics don't automatically make a game better. It's a choice the artist has to make.  But it's not automatically worse either, somehow, because it kills imagination. Yes, you won't have to imagine what a characters fifteen pixel face might look like in reality because he looks reasonably realistic now already - but maybe you'll have to think about why he looks slightly mournful as he tells you something seemingly mundane!"
truegaming,3buakm,SamuelEnderby,6,Fri Jul 3 12:20:47 2015 UTC,"Cloud's a bad example for a character you can insert your own feelings onto. While his model and animations may not be too expressive, his storyline and writing more than make up for this giving Cloud a distinct personality.  Nostalgia goggles aren't about remembering things for being prettier, it's about remembering about the game without too much effort to remember the specific look. Our memories are pretty good at consciously recalling the way things sound, certain smells, but isn't actually so good with visuals, particularly with visuals you weren't paying so much attention to. You can probably recognise a familiar face if you've seen them before, but the memory works one way. You can't remember that face until you see it, you can't recall it out of the blue.   This is what's happening with games. We can remember the layout of an area, and the vague hints of colour, but we don't remember every detail, primarily because we were looking less at what it looked like and more for enemies, objects, and routes. We're not observing critically, we're focused on the gameplay. Your mind isn't filling anything in, it's merely accepting and overlooking it. Since it can't remember the vivid details it just fills in the blanks. Can't remember exactly how a brick wall looked? Ehh, just put a vague image there of brickwork that fills the job and everyone's happy.   Graphics are a gradual march of progress. As such games see gradual improvement. The same thing happens with TV and film too. As camera equipment gets better the images look better. This is why shows from thirty years ago which which were seen as impressive looking now seem incredibly dated looking. Same's true of special effects, effects that were passable, now look fake, because we got used to a better quality over time. This has again nothing to do with imagination, and is instead down to it being impressive at the time, and the mind being willing to overlook it.   It's not the imagination that's the issue, it's the fact that standards are now so high. Games that looked amazingly realistic on the PS2 would be laughed at as awful looking on the PS4. Bizarrely, games that are stylised somewhat escape this trend, through embracing the limitations and making it part of the style. But realistic games suffer for it."
truegaming,3buakm,Nambot,3,Thu Jul 2 07:22:25 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your sentiment, but I do miss seeing the technical write-ups of all the creative ways developers abused the hardware and software to make the seemingly impossible happen.  Now there's so much middleware and such that ""optimization"" is an afterthought, and nobody's fighting to save mere bytes of memory much anymore. The development process seems to lack a lot of the ""creative"" solutions that were adapted in the past.   I guess there's still Demoscene for that stuff though.  Back on topic:   The lack of facial expression on Cloud allows you to insert your own feelings into him.   No, that was still stupid. And FF7 looks way better with mods (PC) or via emulation with OpenGL (PS1). FF7 was an ugly game even for its time. FF8 or 9 would have been better examples. I love the game, but the models are atrocious (though the backgrounds are very pretty still).  I do get what you're saying though. Graphics kind of peaked for me around the PS2/GC/XBox era. I don't really care about shiny graphics these days. That said, art direction is of ridiculous importance, regardless of the quality of your graphics. It's why games like Chrono Trigger, Vagrant Story, and Mario 64 are still presentable and good looking titles today.  Graphical power is always outclassed by the next generation of hardware, but art aesthetics are long lasting and memorable.

Its not really 'imagination' in the sense of how a kid can sit and come up with absolutely crazy shit, but more a function of how memory works.  I'm no neuroscientist, but so far as I've read, your brain doesn't remember images and sounds, etc, it remembers concepts, and when you dredge up those memories, it takes those concepts and basically rebuilds the experience. The older the memory, the fewer concepts it has to work with, so the more it has to fudge using 'what it should look like based on my recent experiences'. Which means its going to seem lifelike, since its filling in with your knowledge of real life(i.e. the vast majority of your experience).  Remember when the Homeworld Remaster came out earlier this year? A very common sentiment was 'yeah, thats what homeworld looks like' until you saw the side by side comparison, because people had literally forgotten what it did look like, and were largely inventing a new look in their head.

I'd much rather be closer to knowing what's in the minds of the creators of great classics than be forced to use my own imagination due to technological constraints, because it's fucking obvious that these dudes are geniuses at their craft, and they have a vision they want to portray. Something much better than anything I can ever imagine that's for sure. Especially considering the amount of people working on one project alone, I'm not cocky enough to think that my imagination will outweigh the imaginations of a full team of talented artists/writers/concepts/directors/composers/etc. Just all imo of course. It is my preference to be closer to the vision of the creator than to have to use my own imagination, especially for great works such as LotR or SotC and FF7. Can you imagine playing Shadow of the Colossus EXACTLY as how the team wanted you to play it? As they envisioned it? Holy shit. That game already is fucking bonkers and amazing, but I guarantee you most of us are missing 1,000 things that were left there by the artists and all these little nuances that couldn't be exemplified due to constraints.   Anyway, I can use my imagination anytime. So when I play something or read something that was created by someone else's imagination or a collaboration of imaginations, I'd wish to view it exactly as how they'd imagine it if possible. Thus why I totally support the idea of complete lack of imagination on our part while playing a game, due to technology being able to successfully have us experience exactly what they had us in mind while playing. I never got the notion of what OP is saying, because to me the imaginations / visions of many will always outweigh that of my own. Especially since there are teams of like 100s+ working on something at a time, each with a different aspect. There is a time for imagination, but when gaming (especially single player games) I would much rather see the story through the eyes of the creators than my own. I think it'd be much more beautiful than I could ever actually imagine, due to the simple notion of a collective force vs. one.   8D~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~x D"
truegaming,3buakm,danielvutran,2,Thu Jul 2 23:41:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, better graphics do leave less of the details to the imagination. You don't have to guess if a character is shocked or not because that expression is clearly visible on his/her face.  But the worlds, stories, and characters are what really matters. The world is clearer to me when the details are clearer.   Imagination can take many forms. Just because I don't have to imagine the detail doesn't mean I don't imagine something else.  And to your point about nostalgia goggles, I think that's more due to recalling past amazement than it is imagination. For example, I think 10 years from now, many will still remember the Witcher 3 being this beautiful game when, in reality, it probably looks like ass compared to the games of the future."
truegaming,3buakm,EkiMGnaW,2,Fri Jul 3 02:50:36 2015 UTC,"Imagination will always be a thing. I mean, unless we enter a horrible THX 1138-type situation (Thanks, Obama...) but yeah.  What I do believe to be true is this:  It's common knowledge that restrictions breed creativity. Oral tradition exists because once upon a time, we couldn't just write stuff down. Paintings and blurry photos exist partially because once a upon a time, we couldn't just whip out a phone at record every living moment.  Same is true of something like game graphics. Mario has overalls and a mustache because otherwise you couldn't make out what he was supposed to be at all.  Such restrictions are nowadays fewer and farther between, technologically. But some authors still type their first draft on a typewriter or by hand.  A lot of photographers choose analog cameras over digital, because of their restrictions and their ""imperfect"" results.  A lot of developers, dare I say mainly Indies (and to some extent Nintendo & co.), choose styles that harp back to yesteryear's norm. In some cases this is emulation (eg. Shovelknight) and in other cases it's for the express purpose of enabling the abstract (eg. Minecraft).  I think the long story short would be something like ""art never really dies."" Take from that what you will."

truegaming,3buakm,JoeBidenBot,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:56:58 2015 UTC,"Some art styles are more abstracted (due to technical limitations or artistic choice) and thus will require more imagination of the player to fill in the blanks.   The more fluid and comprehensive animation and detailed worlds you have, the less imagination is required of the player. However, this doesn't mean the player's imagination isn't piqued, or that its capacity is reduced. It is just no longer as required."
truegaming,3buakm,duhsaurus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:04:17 2015 UTC,"Well, there are many moments in FF7 specifically that didn't inspire imagination, it inspired confusion. The lack of detail and crude animations gave me a lot of WTF moments where I just couldn't piece together what was going on. Same thing with Tomb Raider, especially due to some horrible draw distances, the Lost Valley felt like it was inside a cave! I could never really get an idea of what Metal Gear Rex looked like in MGS because the shots were low in detail and very blocky, where did Rex begin and scenery end?    For me, imagination isn't what you're looking it at, it's what you're feeling. The imagination you cite books as giving goes away with any amount of visual aid whether it be crude graphics, modern graphics, live action video, or illustrations... Add sound and you lose the imagination of what stuff sounds like... I don't think nostalgia plays in here at all since I'm remembering my experiences when those games were new, but I don't see anything lacking these days. If anything, games inspire more imagination now because they are so much better written and crafted. Something like Dark Souls/Bloodborne leaves so much to the imagination! The Witcher 3 has all of these well-realized towns and characters that you never really get to know, but what you do learn inspires lots of possibilities about their history. I remember games 15-20 years ago making me ask internally ""wait, so am I supposed to be scared of that thing?"" or similarly ""is that the same woman that was in the cell next to Snake?"" I don't have to ask those questions anymore, so now I can focus on being swept up into a great fantasy world."

This makes it seem both more real and still clearly fake - as it gets closer to reality, the flaws stand out more.  There's also the issue that realistic-looking games struggle to be fantastical - magical fairy grottoes rendered in realistic style look stupid, so for original and impossible characters and settings, older graphics were kinder."

Imagination is overrated. If things look good then it pleasure my eyes period. They may have more chances to screw things up but that's their fault for not implementing them properly.
truegaming,3buakm,adrixshadow,0,Fri Jul 10 10:42:25 2015 UTC,I have felt the same way when looking at the progression of the pokemon games - the pixel sprites from the old games were doing a heck of a lot with minimal space. How they are represented now with 3d models seem cheap or rushed sometimes (not that the sprites weren't ever rushed) and I believe took away a little bit of the magic from imagining how they moved and performed attacks.   Somebody else mentioned this but I absolutely love text games and imagining how actions are performed with a lengthy description of that went down.
truegaming,3buakm,HalfBakedHarry,-1,Thu Jul 2 10:59:00 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, the games kills imagination by beign addicitve and hence killing motivation to do other more productive activities.

truegaming,3buakm,pRopaaNS,-1,Fri Jul 3 12:57:34 2015 UTC,"If anything, I would say the better graphics have affected the developers imagination, for the worst in many cases. All the super realistic games get old real fast, the gameplay in many games is so similar that it makes me wonder where the developers passion was. I wish that more new games would utilize the better hardware to experiment with NEW artsyles. I think games like Minecraft and animal crossing do a fantastic job of letting players be imaginative. The forge mode in halo is really great too and I used to build levels with their own backstories when my 360 still worked. It all depends on the platform and who's making the game.   A lot of gamers want story driven games which tend to be linear and that doesn't really allow for much imagination. I think there is a bad trend of trying to impress gamers with pretty games and high production values and that kills the potential. Game companies can only offer so much content in a game and in place of compelling, original content most games are content with graphically intensive games that more often than not are buggy which also greatly takes away from the experience."
truegaming,3bj5pc,poehalcho,109,Mon Jun 29 17:34:19 2015 UTC,"Games aimed solely at children.  Skylanders for example. Disney Infinity. The only real challenge here is telling a kid, no, they can't have yet another fucking figure.  Games merely suitable for children are another category. Family games. Things like Mario, Rayman. They're like Pixar films. You can sit children down with them and everything will be alright, but you can also sit down at the weekends as a grown-ass man and play them as well."
truegaming,3bj5pc,blackmist,28,Mon Jun 29 19:05:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's a distinction that needs to be made. One of the first video games I ever played, at 2 years old, was a Barney game on the Sega Genesis. It probably sucked. I don't remember playing it at all. But it was Barney, and bright, and colorful, etc. It was intended for children.  Mario, Rayman, Pixar films, even games like Starbound? Suitable for children, but not for children. If I bought a 7 year old a Mario game, his parents aren't going to complain about the content regardless of how strict or easygoing they are (my parents are incredibly easygoing, so I was playing Perfect Dark from age 5...). If I buy them a Skylanders game, they'll still be just fine. But if I even nudge the maturity up a little bit, like a Metroid game? Suddenly not so acceptable for strict parents."

When you're flipping channels are you able to immediately identify a show that's meant for children?  Things for children usually have bright colours, exaggerated cartoonish proportions, simple storylines, lack of realistic violence or adult language, talking animals as characters among other things.  Like, even if you enjoy the show when you put on Rocko's Modern Life or Ahhh! Real Monsters (dating myself here) you can tell immediately that it's geared towards kids. When you turn on Metalocalypse you can tell immediately that it's meant for adults.  Lots of things that are meant for children can be enjoyed by adults (as others have mentioned) but a lot of the above is what might make me think that a game/TV show/film was made with kids in mind."

truegaming,3bj5pc,Hapster23,3,Tue Jun 30 00:42:56 2015 UTC,"Personally, a game feels childish to me when it says things like ""ask a parent to help"" or something along those lines (Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker is an example that comes to mind) And also when a game spoon feeds information in a very basic way makes it feel childish to me. But it does not affect the way I play at all, it just makes me ""lose"" immersion and remember that this was probably designed for kids, but that's it."
truegaming,3bj5pc,NK1337,3,Tue Jun 30 07:05:23 2015 UTC,"Usually a game that gets labeled as ""childish"" is one that gives off the impression that it was exclusively meant for children   I don't necessarily agree with your definition, but it's because for me the term childish carries a very negative connotation and is synonymous with ""immature"" and ""crass.""     With that in mind, I find it very hard to attribute the term to any specific games, and that's based on how widely games can be perceived. Sure there are games that seem cartoony or simplistic or even aimed at a younger demographic, but I would hardly call them childish. I've always been of the mind that games are for everybody, and while there might be one that you don't necessarily enjoy, there will be hundreds of other people that will. Maybe it's because I'm coming at it from a mindset of somebody within the industry, but to call a game childish seems overly dismissive.   As a whole gaming as come a long way and is a lot more ubiquitous than it was a few years ago, I'd wager you wouldn't find a lot of usage of the term from people that are actively invested the gaming community and culture as whole."
truegaming,3bj5pc,shane71998,7,Mon Jun 29 20:11:12 2015 UTC,"I was referring to the word in the context that the OP was describing, I'm also not a fan of labeling certain games as ""childish"", as I've heard many people dismiss great games as ""kiddy"" games. I don't believe any of the games I described are childish, I was only trying to describe what attributes get them labeled as such as opposed to other games."
truegaming,3bj5pc,NK1337,2,Tue Jun 30 17:11:39 2015 UTC,"I can see your point, especially when you consider that a lot of the times those labels are placed by people outside of the industry looking in.

truegaming,3bj5pc,urection,-7,Tue Jun 30 18:35:21 2015 UTC,"people that are immature or don't play games can be fairly judgemental when they look over your shoulder and see what you're playing, and label you as a man-child for playing games that they think are ""just for little kids"".   if I see a 20-something playing with dolls and judge them a manchild, that doesn't really make me immature"
truegaming,3bj5pc,Arakha,10,Tue Jun 30 00:26:36 2015 UTC,"Well in a sense, yes, that makes you immature because you instantly feel like you already know this person and labelled him as a ""manchild"". As an adult, he has absolutely every right to enjoy dolls, toy cars... etc while still being a responsible, balanced, completely mature adult.  What he is interested in and what hobby he choses or likes has absolutely no meaning in how mature / adult he is. But you still labelled him as a manchild without further evidence or proof that he indeed is. The fact that you can't seem to understand that completely mature adults can enjoy child toys or doll is indeed a bit immature."

truegaming,3bj5pc,_Woodrow_,24,Tue Jun 30 04:12:39 2015 UTC,"There are lots of things that can appeal to children and adults, but some things are only something children will really appreciate.  For example, the first ~3 seasons of Spongebob Squarepants were awesome, for anyone, having humor children and adults could appreciate. Many of the jokes have different levels, the surface being funny for kids while underneath there's a reference or sarcastic element to it that only adults will get.  Then there's a more typical children's show, where that type of subtle humor is basically absent because that's not something children generally understand. It's very matter of fact and reliant on other things - energetic, flashy, silly, with characters that lean much more toward caricatures.  But the thing with games is that if it has good gameplay, adults can still enjoy very simple games even if they are aimed at children."

Games with characters that are obviously not in any real danger of dying in the story and games with characters that have an overly strong moral code can both be a bit childish.

truegaming,3bj5pc,Vozka,9,Mon Jun 29 19:38:53 2015 UTC,"Childish, to me, is saying something is shallow or immature (crass). I expect a certain level of sophistication and maturity in mechanics and themes, if those levels aren't meant, the thing can come across as childish to me.    I can't speak intimately for Tearaway Unfolded, or Tearaway for that matter, but the game doesn't come across as childish to me. Utilizing the Vita features seems like a shallow gimmick on the surface, maybe, but I've been led to believe Tearaway was quite refined in its use of these features, perhaps the same will be true of this PS4 version (though I don't see the PS4 features as quite so gimmicky.) Its art style is very masterful, I don't get childish there either, so I'm not sure what the presenter meant, perhaps only that  one would expect games featuring such unique ""gimmick"" mechanics to be shallow in its design? Outside of that, I think childish is a pretty inaccurate term to use for Tearaway/Tearaway Unfolded."
truegaming,3bj5pc,DTMickeyB,14,Mon Jun 29 22:34:23 2015 UTC,"“Critics who treat 'adult' as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.”  ― C.S. Lewis"

Seriousness - no consequence for failure? What's a game that doesn't take itself seriously? - something without much work put into it?  I think childish is a pretty vague label to give a game, and I don't think it's inherently negative, some of the best games have 'childish' elements, although I can't think of an entirely childish game that isn't bad/mediocre."
truegaming,3bj5pc,anduin1,13,Tue Jun 30 11:33:08 2015 UTC,"IMO, people instantly tag a game as ""childish"" by just looking at the colors used and the characters involved.  For example, let's talk about Splatoon. The game has cartoonish characters inside a really bright and colorful world.  But deep inside the game's story, it talks about how human's lack of interest in caring for the planet has caused the water levels to rise and cause a ""Great Flood"", basically killing all human beings in the process. A few species managed to survive and managed to evolve in the course of around 14,000 years. The two main species are squid and octopus. These two were in a great war were many died. Eventually, Squids won and forced the octopus race to live underground.  The game starts with ""The Great Zapfish"" being stolen by the octolings. This zapfish is the main source of electric power in the game's setting. After the story mode, you retrieve said zapfish and basically, doom the entire octopus race to stay underground and most likely perish and/or become extinct.  Now, people wouldn't usually expect such story coming from Nintendo, I mean, look at the game's boxart. But sadly, that's the stereotype that has been assigned to Nintendo as a whole. They can't release anything new because poeple instantly tag it as chidish."
truegaming,3bj5pc,freeogy,10,Thu Jul 2 16:38:38 2015 UTC,"Now, people wouldn't usually expect such story coming from Nintendo   Which is funny because Nintendo games/exclusives normally have some of the most heart wrenching events and plots. Ganondorf in The Wind Waker is a very tragic character:   My country lay within a vast desert. When the sun rose into the sky, a burning wind punished my lands, searing the world. And when the moon climbed into the dark of night, a frigid gale pierced our homes. No matter when it came, the wind carried the same thing... Death. But the winds that blew across the green fields of Hyrule brought something other than suffering and ruin. I coveted that wind, I suppose.    And don't get me started on Mother 3 or Xenoblade or the fucking baby Metroid's sacrifice in Super Metroid.  But man, Link's Awakening did a number on me when I first played it. Dream or not, you pretty much single handedly destroyed an entire world and its inhabitants in the end.."
truegaming,3bj5pc,PlayMp1,3,Tue Jun 30 15:24:54 2015 UTC,Some wholly unimportant story (and yes the story IS unimportant to Splatoon) doesn't make something not childish. The fact that Splatoon is a skillful game with strategy and depth does.
truegaming,3bj5pc,NekoiNemo,9,Tue Jun 30 17:50:48 2015 UTC,"What makes a game childish is the same for most other media - a cute/cartoony art style with saturated, easily identifiable colors, or child-looking characters. Mario games are often seen as children's games on a superficial level. The TLOZ series also gets this quite often. I'm pretty sure nintendo's main audience is younger people - so they stick to this style.  And don't talk about it like it's a bad thing, childish can be beautiful!   I don't think there's much that can be done about it, most consumers have been trained to respond to these design choices in a certain way. If anything's to be done, it's to subvert expectations and break stereotypes, so that consumers get retrained."

Looking at a game like Smash Bros Melee which became this competitive juggernaut was looked down negatively by Nintendo because they wanted it to be easier for kids. So we got brawl which neutered most of what made Melee special. So what's childish is their attitude towards hardcore gamers that look for more depth than press A and win."

That said my own definition would be a game that lacks the ability to be challenging for an average adult or a game that is deliberately and self-evidently aiming at a very unfinished skill set (I'm thinking about the Mario's Early Years! series specifically).  I don't think a game like Splatoon is childish, I mean it's undoubtedly youth-centric but I'm hesistant to call games like that childish, rather than calling them 'for everyone', you know what the E rating is supposed to mean? Just because a film is PG13 doesn't mean it can't be enjoyable for an adult and the same goes for the ESRB ratings.   I've played lots of games rated M or T that weren't engaging and lots of E rated games that were.   But again, the bottom line is, it's subjective. I might make an argument that Call of Duty is childish because of the fact it attracts huge numbers of underage players (in spite of its rating) and has done so since Modern Warfare came out. I don't think I would call it that but you get what I'm saying, there are different ways to define a game as childish and different people will do it their own way."

truegaming,3bj5pc,jeezlouise123,5,Tue Jun 30 07:08:20 2015 UTC,"exactly. the thing about videogames is that if they try to act as ""mature"" as possible, it usually does a backflip and ends up being as childish as most games actually aimed at children.  when i was like, 7, my mum bought me Duke Nukem: Time To Kill on ps1. on the surface its gore and tits and blood and the plight of human existence but at its core its me, dressed in a toga, doing backflips and blowing up pigmen whilst tipping strippers. that's not mature or x-rated, that's a childish power fantasy that, if anything, resonates more with kids than adults. it's only cause the game on a technical level is well made does (imo) it actually appeal to adults."
truegaming,3bj5pc,Noggin-a-Floggin,10,Mon Jun 29 21:28:59 2015 UTC,"I generally find that all that means is that people are insecure about being treated as adults, so they take whimsy as being an affront to their own insecurity.   Other than that, a game that lacks any depth beyond a simple mechanic can be childish. To that end, I think that a lot of shooters are childish even if they have the veneer of being ""mature."""

Spore.  You evolve your creatures and then go around either attacking other creatures, with the most dumbed down and limited point-click RTS mechanics ever. Or... you can sing and dance to the other animals and they sing and dance with you. That's about as well as I can describe my disappointment. TLDR: Childish."
truegaming,3bj5pc,01314150,3,Mon Jun 29 23:01:51 2015 UTC,"With a passing glance, a childish game is usually defined as a colorful game. Some of the promotional images from Team Fortress 2 make it look like a ""childish game.""   I'm not sure if this is true or not, but I think there might have been a slight uproar when the color palette was changed from Team Fortress Classic to TF2, making it look ""childish"". So, basically one of the major factors of a childish game is color."
truegaming,3bj5pc,UnidentifiedFlop,3,Mon Jun 29 23:27:42 2015 UTC,"Childish games are ones that are very simple, not particularly challenging and don't require a lot of critical thinking or a set of skills.  The only people that think Wind Waker or Rayman or Mario are ""childish"" are immature 13-year olds trying to sound tough and hardcore by only playing M-rated games or swearing at people on XBox Live.  I'm thinking Skylanders in particular which is a very simple and easy action-RPG like game."
truegaming,3bj5pc,omar1993,3,Tue Jun 30 00:38:28 2015 UTC,"There have been plenty games around with a cartoon style about them. People (should) know better than to judge based on just that.   Depends on why they're judging them.  I just plain don't really care for cartoony style graphics.  Doesn't mean the game itself is bad, or the gameplay, or story, or anything like that.  I just don't like that visual style and it will impede my enjoyment of everything else, so I stay away.  Each to their own."

The medium is video games and people are prioritizing filmmaking and other entertainment aspects as more important than the gameplay.

truegaming,3bj5pc,Stop-Hanging-Djs,3,Tue Jun 30 13:40:28 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think how ""childish"" a game is begins and ends with its aesthetics and plot(or rather, its complexity/implications) and has nothing to do with a game's difficulty, learning curve or gameplay style(since kids can adapt to difficulties, play styles and curves of various kinds anyway)  An example of a game that would fall under these criteria would be NiGHTS into Dreams, and it sequel Journey of Dreams.  It's literally as childish as it can get, where the main characters are children and an immature carefree purple flying jester, who fly about in a dreamland fending off nightmares.  The plot isn't especially detailed(although it is a meaningful coming of age story, in a sense), the aesthetics are nice, and kid-friendly and the gameplay is something anyone can like(it's why I freaking LOVE both games).  That's my opinion anyway..."
truegaming,3bj5pc,Eddy_Sc,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:04:20 2015 UTC,"It makes game ""suitable for children"", not ""childish"" though."
truegaming,3bj5pc,PlayMp1,0,Tue Jun 30 00:35:49 2015 UTC,"Why not both?  It works for kids, and it seems like the kind of thing a kid would be more interested in(unless you were a man-child like me); it looks childish, feels childish, IS childish(plot-wise, since no adult would have anything to do with THAT story)...what to call it but that?  Here's are some reasons why it's not just ""suitable"" for kids, but a kiddy game overall:  1: The main characters ARE kids with no deep development, except for the fact that they come of age by the end of it(inb4 SPOILERS, there's no depth to the story to warrant caution here)  2: The game's aesthetics are something only a kid(or one's inner kid) would like; for example, the male main character's(there are two protagonists) first stage is called Pure Valley, a natural expanse and valley riddled with greenery, flowing crystal-clear rivers, rainbows and sunshine, i.e. a kid's general view of a natural paradise.  If that wasn't enough to convince you this game is kiddy, listen to the background OST playing in this stage(which I still love, but it's nothing you'd expect to hear in a ""grown up"" game)  3: The ""antagonists"" of the game are ""Nightmarens"", enemies that actually have a slight resemblance to real world things whose entire existence is dedicated to the disruption of the dream-like environment in their respective stages(such as Chamelan, a Chameleon-like nightmare that represents deception and the inhibition of growth in a stage that represents the future, growth and potential, although I won't get into too much detail on HOW that is)  Point is, only a kid would see these as ""big baddies"" as opposed to something more, like I(an adult) would."
truegaming,3bj5pc,NumeroDeux,4,Tue Jun 30 00:49:50 2015 UTC,"Simplistic, menial gameplay and a very basic story.  Those games where you need to collect all coins/bolts to unlock the next level/scene. Menial tasks such as: ""Go get X and place it in Y and I'll give you 1 Z-item"". This makes you waste tons of hours doing menial tasks and usually developers have these quests/requirements to extend the gameplay hours to their games.  A simple (not necessarily bad) plot includes no character development, no back stories, no motivations: ""Bad guy is bad because he hates smiles!"", ""Good guy is good because having fun is THE BEST THING EVER!"", ""I look like a bad guy on the outside but I do good things so I'm EXTRA cool.""  Aesthetically bright colors and big noticeable button inputs are childish to some people. Anything that STANDS OUT. Like you're walking in the open world and a huge button overlay shows up in front of a ground herb. Just a HUGE ""[PRESS A TO HARVEST THIS HERB]"" sign.   Minimalism in games can be linked with mature and stylish gameplay because of their self-explanatory nature; so having huge over-explained inputs is childish. Also HUGE font or icons in menus, so people don't get lost and are able to find everything easily.   Contextual story-telling can also determine if a game is childish. A game can be self-aware of it's childish design, sometimes even make it childish looking on purpose, but if the story has elements of deep story telling, character development, themes such as death, famine, then a game is contextually mature even though it's graphically made to look like a ""kid's game""."
truegaming,3bj5pc,tocilog,5,Mon Jun 29 18:00:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think the label childish is a useless pejorative to dismiss games by people who think they're too good for the game. It doesn't really give any insight into aesthetics, gameplay, narrative or otherwise. A game with ""childish"" aesthetics can have deep gameplay and a gritty ""mature"" game can be braindead as all hell. The same goes for every other element. In short I don't think there's much merit in thinking or worrying about what makes a game ""childish"""
truegaming,3bj5pc,darkjungle,2,Mon Jun 29 19:21:19 2015 UTC,"I think what makes a game ""childish"" is the presence of bright, colorful graphics with the lack of emotional depth and/or gore and adult themes.  Some people mention lack of challenge as a measure of ""childishness"" but Mario can be very unforgiving and yet it still is considered rather childish."
truegaming,3bj5pc,ginja_ninja,2,Mon Jun 29 19:36:10 2015 UTC,"Yet Mario shouldn't be considered childish. It's child friendly, yes, but it's not childish. It's like Pixar - would you ever call a movie like Toy Story childish? No. But it's child friendly."
truegaming,3bj5pc,TbanksIV,2,Tue Jun 30 10:12:53 2015 UTC,"Perspective.   People who game are going to say games x, y, and z are childish based on their personal definitions of what makes a game childish. Which is why you're seeing people say pokemon/mario/rayman are childish in some comments and then others saying that they have a lot of depth if you look more into them in other comments.   Then you have people who don't game who think any sort of gaming is childish.   It all comes down to personal perspective, and I'm not sure much, if anything, can be done about it. Maybe as some of the stigma between gamers and non-gamers or ""hardcore"" gamers and ""casual"" gamers decreases."
truegaming,3bj5pc,baalroo,2,Tue Jun 30 23:24:23 2015 UTC,"Presentation and humor.  If a game appears to be whimsical, childish looking (as if coming from a children's book), and the music is...I guess nice is the best way I can put it, matching the art style, no gore violence etc.  The humor is, well, rated-G.    I think the main issue is that people correlate childish to simple and easy.  Which, if you ask me, isn't fair.  There are games presented to appeal to children (like most of Nintendo's offerings) that can be really challenging and fun.  If it doesn't appeal to you, well then, I guess that's fine.  But there's no point in dismissing it as childish, simple and easy if you haven't tried it at all.  On the other hand developers making simple games for kids and adults labeling certain games with adult theme as unfit for children aren't being fair either, I think.  Kids can handle difficult games as a lot of us did who grew up in the arcade/8-bit/16-bit era.  Sure, maybe gore and ultra-violence should be censored, I think though that kids can handle games with themes of death, sacrifice, war, horror, some toilet humor even, as we did in the arcade/8-bit/16-bit era.    So we blur the line between which games are for adults and for kids.  Sometimes we just need to let people get exposed to different genres, themes, difficulty and gameplay."
truegaming,3bj5pc,plasmaprestige,2,Wed Jul 1 23:41:13 2015 UTC,"To me, it's forced humor. That's the reason I didn't enjoy Lego Marvel as much as the others. So many of the jokes fell flat and the puns were God-awful."
truegaming,3bj5pc,NekoiNemo,2,Sun Jul 5 18:21:54 2015 UTC,"Well for me the biggest thing is simplicity. This can be in terms of either gameplay or story depending on the genre. I think Halo is a decent example of both elements. The gameplay is fairly simple and the characters are all pretty standard. This isn't to say adults can't enjoy it as well because the games are fun and one hell of a spectacle, but it's also why I loved them when I was 13 and why so many kids love them. They're easy to play, understand, and you don't need to read a bunch of stuff to do so.  The other big thing that affects it for me is voice acting. If the voicework sounds like it's from a kid show or is just really poorly delivered, it kinds of makes the game plot seem more trivial to me. Final Fantasy X is a good example here. A lot of the main characters' voice actors make it pretty difficult to take seriously and generally feel like you're watching some anime for preteens. The story itself isn't terrible, but the voice acting removes almost all potential gravitas from most scenes. Compare with something like FFVII or IX who have much less realistic artstyles, yet still manage to feel more complex and mature from being text-based. Or look at FFXII, in addition to a much more complex plot that doesn't revolve around a teen romance like FFX, most of the voicework and direction is spectacular and only gets better the more times you play the game.  As for what it seems to mean to most people in general though, it usually gets thrown around as a knee-jerk when something looks cartoony or cel-shaded. A lot of times this isn't true, although when the entire premise of the game turns out to be ""run and jump and look at the graphics"" then I would say it's deserved (shoutouts to 90% of Nintendo games in the last 15 years)."
truegaming,3bj5pc,anduin1,2,Fri Jul 10 16:37:59 2015 UTC,"This is a great question OP, you're getting some killer conversations here.  For me the only thing I would deem a game childish for, is if it is specifically marketed towards children (I can't remember but there were a few Wii and DS games that mentioned kids in the title, or were like really easy brain teasers and stuff.)  This also includes the bulk of, ""Movie - games"" which have all but disappeared except for the child market, for games based on Disney movies and the such. (That being said there are noticeable exceptions like the SNES disney games which were fucking impossible, and despite being mainly marketed towards children, were often purchased by those who heard they were difficult.)  But aside from that, I don't think any game is childish. People have different tastes, I don't like Nintendogs or anything like that but some people dig on that shit, and I won't judge. Some people don't like Dark Souls, Silent Hill, or League, and while I think everyone should try those games, it's cool if they don't.  Most people use it as an insult, and that's just a totally dismissive thing to do."
truegaming,3bj5pc,01314150,2,Fri Jul 10 22:43:02 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on who you ask and the context in which the term is being used.  For me there are two components:   a game can be ""childish"" if it appears to be made specifically for, and marketed towards, children. Things like Pokemon, Animal Crossing, or just a lot of Nintendo games in general come to mind. These games may still be fun and enjoyable, but they have a certain cartoonish aesthetic, are ""non-threatening,"" and have relatively simple game mechanics. a game can also be ""childish,"" but still slightly more ""mature."" A lot of ""AAA"" titles fall into this category for me. These type of games may have slightly more ""gritty"" aesthetic values, but are still very cliche, with simplistic stories and gameplay. In a way, using the term ""childish"" in this manner is meant to be at least somewhat derogatory. Things like Infamous or Destiny fall into this category for me. In other words, games that are made for and marketed towards slightly older children in the 13-17 range."
truegaming,3bdvlp,Unchosen1,95,Sun Jun 28 08:00:32 2015 UTC,No mention of metroid? Something I wish more open world games would learn from. Upgrades to your character expand the open world in a natural mechanical way.   It allows for exploration but gives the player incentive to push forward in the main line in order to get to that high ledge they couldn't reach before.   Essentially it is genius because it dangles the promise of even more exploration in front of players who might only care about exploring and not the main game thread.
truegaming,3bdvlp,gordallott,24,Sun Jun 28 09:18:17 2015 UTC,"A bit like Pokemon games' progression and exploration being based on having the right HMs. In particular I always thought it was really cool in Gold/Silver/Crystal when there would be HMable zones very early in the game that you would have to go back and surf/rock smash to areas you wouldn't be able to access earlier. Again, dangling the prospect of adventure."
truegaming,3bdvlp,dogpigrabbit,14,Sun Jun 28 10:33:22 2015 UTC,"It's way better in Black/White, where there is only one place you have to use an HM (when it shows you what HMs are) and the rest is optional, but very tempting"
truegaming,3bdvlp,mysticrudnin,9,Sun Jun 28 18:20:46 2015 UTC,"Actually, Black & White was pretty bad about this. There were maybe one or two optional areas, but for the most part you didn't need the HM's to progress, making the entire thing very linear (at least until you beat the elite four) Save for the mandatory surf section, and the obligatory rock pushing puzzle, the HM's aren't used in the main story and there's little on the side routes either.  Black & White 2 fixed this a fair bit thankfully."
truegaming,3bdvlp,Nambot,3,Sun Jun 28 20:34:02 2015 UTC,"I disagree quite strongly. I had the most fun exploring Black and White's world out of all of the worlds. There were a ton of little places you could go off and explore, and the fact that none of it was mandatory was great.  Not needing HMs to progress is the very best thing to happen to Pokemon, I think. It's sad they did away with it. I think our point of contention is how much there was on the side routes, which I feel there was a lot. I spent quite a long time exploring and finding things, far more than most of the other games."
truegaming,3bdvlp,mysticrudnin,5,Mon Jun 29 12:32:09 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid to say I had the reverse problem. I found black and white very linear. By the time I finally got surf I went all the back to the start just to explore the p2 labs, the only side route available to me at that time. In doing so I completely broke the leveling curve of the game and was overpowered for the elite 4, because the game at this point expected you to not deviate from it's path.   I don't doubt that Black & White have a lot of areas to access, the problem is that almost all of them get visited through the course of the plot. You don't just accidentally find them, you see them, then get told some form of ""You're not ready to be here yet, go away"" until it comes up in the plot that you need to be there. The handful that aren't this are largely just small caves that a legendary pokemon is hiding in, or a random marsh whose only purpose (aside from a couple of rare pokemon) is to serve as a point for an event pokémon. Many other areas are simply blocked to you until you beat the elite 4.   Even the layout of the towns suggests linearity. You start at the bottom right, explore the first four gyms without so much as an option to even try to go another way, and then the one place you can take an alternate route is blocked until after the elite four. Every other map does a better job of making it look less like one pathway, even Black 2 & White 2 which adds extra towns, creates hidden tunnels between places, and generally adds a lot more to explore."
truegaming,3bdvlp,Nambot,2,Mon Jun 29 16:44:08 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying. We have very different playstyles for sure.  I usually speed run the main story in Pokemon. I was mid 30s when I finished Black and White, and was happy that I could do that. Then, after the E4, there was the most content I think that we've had after that. There was a lot to explore and do.  In the other games, exploration wasn't really exploration, it was ""mandatory"" - you were forced to criss-cross and redo things and backtrack and when you're forced to do it, it feels bad to me. This isn't the case in other games, usually, (metroidvania) because they don't have trivial enemies that take forever to fight: you just hit them once and leave or jump over them or whatever. But in Pokemon you have to stock and use repels, or run, or fight battles that still take time."
truegaming,3bdvlp,mysticrudnin,10,Tue Jun 30 12:59:22 2015 UTC,"Are there any examples of games that take the whole upgrade your character to access more world thing from metroid, but applied to a much larger, more open world?   I've always found that metroidvania games tend to get fairly linear anyways, with a bit of backtracking once you get the right unlockables."
truegaming,3bdvlp,patrick227,19,Sun Jun 28 12:21:19 2015 UTC,"The Arkham franchise does this, to an extent.  You can't access certain areas or sidequests until you get a new toy from following the main plot.  Arkham Knight even has a clever one with an item you can get almost at the beginning of the game if you actually look around being used to open certain doors (protip: check the GCPD evidence room)."

truegaming,3bdvlp,kevin9er,7,Mon Jun 29 05:20:53 2015 UTC,Metroid (and Castlevania) aren't open world. The world starts of small and you're able to enter new parts as you pushed through the story. The world is a hub you backtrack through to get to new areas that are unlocked by getting new items and abilities. It's called Metroidvania.   Open world implies just that: the world is open.
truegaming,3bdvlp,ULJarad,16,Sun Jun 28 11:47:09 2015 UTC,i disagree entirely.   is a game like GTA vice city not open world because you aren't allowed to leave the first island at first? is Red Dead Redemption not open world because you can't go to Mexico until later?   Open world is a super broad definition and a game like metroid easily fits into it. yes metroidvania is a 'genre' but you could easily argue that it is just a subgenre of an open world. Genres are not mutually exclusive of one and another.
truegaming,3bdvlp,gordallott,9,Sun Jun 28 11:58:59 2015 UTC,"You're welcome to disagree, but you're fighting a the definition of a term used to describe the predecessor of open-worlds.  Think about it. You're saying Metroid is open world because ""upgrades to your character expand the open world."" How is the world open if you have to open it? Just look at the definition of Metroidvania:   Metroidvania games feature a large interconnected world map the player can explore, but access to parts of the world is limited by doors or other portals that can only be opened after the player has acquired special tools, weapons or abilities within the game.   You're getting hung up on the fact that GTA3-4 have several islands, which doesn't make it Metroidvania. If you wanted to convert GTA:VC to a Metroidvania game, you'd take the first island and put a handful of Mission Malls (1-5). All the game's missions would take place in these Mission Malls (MM). You'd have an item in MM1 that allows access to MM2. Each MM requires an item from the previous one. If you had all the items from the beginning, you could walk up to the final boss and beat the game.  GTA isn't metroid because the missions take place in the world. The majority of the game is unlocked (open). There's no item or ability you could start off with that would let you complete a GTA game without doing the story."
truegaming,3bdvlp,ULJarad,10,Sun Jun 28 13:10:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying GTA is metroid at all, I'm saying you have a very narrow definition of what an open world is and is not and that many traditionally thought of open world games would not fit into it"
truegaming,3bdvlp,gordallott,2,Sun Jun 28 13:46:39 2015 UTC,My definition of open world is that the world must be open. Locking significant portions the world behind story progress goes very much against that. Making an open world game use Metroidvania structure removes the open world aspect.
truegaming,3bdvlp,ULJarad,7,Sun Jun 28 13:56:13 2015 UTC,"Locking significant portions the world behind story progress goes very much against that   see this is the thing, i get what you are saying but doesn't GTA: vice city or RDR lock significant portions of the world behind story progress?   I think in the end they are all open world - at the end of a metroid game you can go wherever you want and do whatever you want. Is it only a open world game if you can go wherever you want through the entire game? because if so i don't think a lot of traditionally open world games are open world games anymore.  you could probably make a case that metroid games, at least the 3D ones are limited in their design in that each area is often self contained rather than the open field designs like GTA or TES though - but that seems an aside from the topic of discussion"
truegaming,3bdvlp,gordallott,5,Sun Jun 28 14:18:33 2015 UTC,"The distinction comes from the world in Metroid games is just a hub. Think back to when it came out. Most NES games were levels. The next level of progression was the level select map. Metroid just made it so the level select map was it's own map with the levels being parts of the world. The original Zelda took it further and everything was open from the beginning.   Don't get me wrong. I greatly prefer the Metroid structure. I feel it allows exploration in manageable chunks that place emphasis on the main story. Which is what this thread is about, and I agree with you on.   Edit- by Zelda I'm referring only to the first one. The rest are Metroidvania style."
truegaming,3bdvlp,ULJarad,5,Sun Jun 28 15:11:31 2015 UTC,"You're ignoring /u/gordallott's point. By your definition, a game like GTA: Vice City is not open world because it locks significant portions of the world behind story progress. You even said in a previous post:   Locking significant portions the world behind story progress goes very much against that.   ... So are you saying GTA games aren't open world? Because afaik all of them from 3 - 4 make you progress the story to be able to travel to the other islands/portions of the game."
truegaming,3bdvlp,boopaboopa,3,Sun Jun 28 20:37:00 2015 UTC,I'm surprised Legend of Zelda isn't on that list.
truegaming,3bdvlp,tocilog,2,Mon Jun 29 02:44:26 2015 UTC,"You're sort of both right and wrong at the same time. Open world is a more broad genre (but not that broad) that allows non-linear exploration but it does have set guidelines on what is and isn't open world.   Metroidvania is a sub-genre of these games specifically a fusion of 2D platforming and open world exploration games, Metroid is basically the combination of Super Mario and Zelda.   Any blocks in open world games are there for story reasons only, blocks in Metroidvanias are there to steer you towards the next objective, and so you're original comment fits in very well with OPs question.  So basically you're wrong and right in saying its open world as open world is it's own genre that Metroidvania games don't quite fit in, but they do have their roots in the open world genre.  While they're both right and wrong in saying Metroidvania isn't open world as it doesn't quite fit within that genre and is it's own sub-genre, but that sub-genre itself is a fusion of open world and platforming.  This is something that always happens when talking about sub-genres, although you are right in calling them by the root genre you're still wrong in the way you describe the game as it won't completely fit within that genre, it doesn't do the game justice in explaining the gameplay.  It's similar in the way Character Action is described as Hack 'n' Slash or Beat 'em ups, it's technically right to call them that but it also doesn't fully fit within that genres definition and doesn't do those games justice.  They also gave a bad example of the definitions though which would make GTA a sort of Metroidvania, in fact given the rest of the game it would probably result in a sub-sub-genre under that definition."
truegaming,3bdvlp,Game25900,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:08:20 2015 UTC,"Like you later argue, metroidvania is a predecessor to open world, and as such I think it's ridiculous to argue that it definitely isn't open world at all. It's what open world could only be at the time, even though it's a bit different how it's done today and constructed from a network of linear rooms.  But why do you think the line is drawn so strictly? It sounds like you're just arguing semantics of terminology, assuming the terms are mutually exclusive (like a subgenre of a genre in music is not the host genre but only the sub) and that the terminology is without flaw...  Games have some really stupid definitions and words that are about as unclear, ambiguous and nonsensical as they can be, often made up by users over time (gamers, hardcore, casual, gameplay, genres, RPG...). I do think that we should use our own heads in defining the use of words instead of clinging on to some imaginary ""official"" definitions that we've settled on."
truegaming,3bdvlp,kissapuu,5,Mon Jun 29 07:52:47 2015 UTC,"It's not ridiculous. Metroidvania is a halfway point between open and linear. Having attributes of one doesn't make it entirely one or the other. Just look at this.  http://i.imgur.com/vAcCN5O.png  Linear means you can't access previous maps without restarting the game. Being able to walk from back to start of Level 3 doesn't make it not linear.  Metroidvania means the world is locked behind progression. You start by gaining access to one area, you can't access new areas until you complete that area. Each area is linear. Don't confuse the hub world as being open, the hub is nothing more than an interactive level select.  Open is open. You can start the game and go to where the final boss is. You can comb a vast area from the start. The game takes place in the openness.  I'm not sure how locking significant areas of a game behind story sequential story progression can be considered unclear. Open world definition is vague, but Metroidvania isn't.   Edit- it's important to note that Metroidvania has a lot of scenery that's never accessible."
truegaming,3bdvlp,ULJarad,3,Mon Jun 29 10:05:26 2015 UTC,"After reading a whole bunch of replies in this thread I still think your definitions are what most people use. The confusion seems to lie with modern games that appear to cordon off certain areas that you can only access via/after quests, like Red Dead Redemption, which make them appear hub-ish/Metroidvania-ish. I think there's possibly more than just the way the exploration is gated which makes people call it what type of game, although I don't know how to articulate this."
truegaming,3bdvlp,dankisms,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:49:13 2015 UTC,"The main difference is that for the islands in GTA3-4, you don't gain access to them through an acquired ability or item. In GTA3/VC, you couldn't access the other islands because the bridges were blocked and you couldn't swim. Swimming wasn't an ability you gained and you didn't get an item that fixed the bridge. The islands opened up simply because you had completed enough of the story. And when swimming was introduced in SA/4, the whole world is accessible from the start but discouraged by a wanted level.  The restrictions used in GTA3-4 don't fall in line with Metroidvania structuring."

In these open world games they substitute terrain barriers with enemies. Ideally you'd run into foes too numerous/strong for you to handle with your current abilities so keeping you to a predictable path. Of course this is fairly easily broken given how poorly thought out Skyrim's character progression systems are handled.  But I've certainly played those games like you mentioned. Confined to sections A and B until you get double jump, which then unlocks section C via A, where you then find a crawl mechanic, which allows you to access section D from B. Throw in a bunch more and voila, there you go.  However... this also feels very limiting, especially depending on the mechanics chosen. They don't necessarily have to be skills, they can be quests (border guards won't let you past until you've done storyline quest X for example), they can be monster difficulty.  The thing is, while the intention might be good (to steer players in certain directions) they can also cause frustration. You know a double jump mechanic exists somewhere, but right now that ledge is just tantalizingly out of reach. You can find any number of players to argue either for or against this. I don't see why this deserves to be called genius, just because open world games use different mechanics rather than straight up denying you access to other areas unless you have specific skill/item/quest Z doesn't make them any better, just different. Again, you can find any number of players who will take offense at this artificial limitation of the exploration. ""If you don't want me to go there then why is there no impassable mountain in the way, don't give me this border guards bullshit, I can kill them in one measly fus ro dah."""

That way if they're in the middle of doing a side quest but wanted to progress the story a bit they'll have a bit of warning to know if they want to keep going with the story, or finish off more side things.

It's really not a bad thing to not keep progressing through the story. If anything, it's a compliment to how deep you made the rest of the world and that gamers want to complete these side quests.

But the quest line to make them go away was so long and boring, I would just avoid those areas as long as I could.

Are the side quests at all related to the main story, or are they just their own thing?  The only experience I have with something similar is Mass Effect 2/3, where the side missions are interesting in their own right, and they enhance the main story as well. Mass Effect games are significantly shorter though, so I never felt overwhelmed by anything.  Lack of a good main quest may not be the only reason why people get distracted and never bother with it, but I'd say it's still a pretty big factor."
truegaming,3bdvlp,wulfsburg,7,Sun Jun 28 09:11:55 2015 UTC,"apparently that game has an issue with an intimidatingly large amount of compelling content.   This is true. As someone that doesn't care for open world games because the side content is usually boring or repetative, I can't get enough of the questing in the Witcher 3. I think because each side quest is so narrative heavy, that it doesn't feel like busywork like other huge open world games. I usually only last 50 hours in open world games before getting bored, but in the Witcher 3, I am 65 hours in, and still haven't gotten to Skillige Isle (I think this is a half way point in the game).   I prefer games that are 10-20 hours usually just because I don't have too much time to play video games these days. But the Witcher 3 is incredibly well written and real feeling. I highly recommend the game, even to non witcher fans who haven't played the others. The strong writing has been improving all throughout the trilogy."
truegaming,3bdvlp,djsekani,2,Mon Jun 29 19:34:18 2015 UTC,"I'm almost scared to buy this game now cause I know I'll still be playing it when Fallout 4 comes out, heh.

truegaming,3bdvlp,wulfsburg,2,Mon Jun 29 19:42:41 2015 UTC,"What I really like about the Witcher 3 is the fact that the world is huge, and that you can explore everything, but you really don't have to. It has been hard, but after 60 hours of gameplay, I have finally stopped compulsively looting everything, searching every corner and contain, as well looting every residents for vendor trash.  I have so much money and crap in my inventory right now, and I have barely used ANY of it. Anything you need for crafting seems to be purchasable from vendors.   I stopped collecting herbs out of fear that I ""will need them later"". There are so many non interactable NPC's, that without the exclaimation point above their heads, you would never know they are quest givers or have anything to do with a quest. I am normally largely against quest markers, but the game would be very hard without them... almost impossible even.  I guess what I am saying is that the compulsive explorer/looter in all of us is engrained from so many other games , it has kind of detracted from the open world aspect of the game. You know that train of thought where there might be some sword hidden in the bottom of a cave/dungeon, or what rare armor might be in a chest.   What is nice, is that the less narrative heavy quests (such as contracts or treasure hunts) allow us to go searching for something specific , instead of randomly searching every single container and building in hopes for random shit.  Sure, there is the occasional ""rare"" sword,  or relic armor that are picked up, but the better gear is ""Treasure hunt"" driven, which are usually triggered by either finding (or buying from the vendors) clue pieces.   I don't even loot most monsters anymore because there is so much of the same shit, if I ever needed a certain kind of monster heart, I could easily go find or buy one.  So, when/if you pick this game up, try not to spend too much time looking for a random drop. It kind of takes away from the beauty of the world and the strongest point of the game... the narrative and it's choices."

It is at first (and the best questline of the entire game is part of the main story, though it happens early), but the second half of the game is of lower quality in my opinion. As far as the main story is concerned, I personally found The Witcher 2 more compelling than the third one."

While I understand the appeal of wanting to overcome a challenge, this is about open world games.  If this mission you described happens after 25 hours of play, having to start the game over sounds awful. If the player isn't levelled enough, they'll have to either slowly fight their way through the mission or reload the save before the two-month timer. Neither of those ideas seem particularly inviting nor exciting, and I doubt most players would enjoy doing that."

The attack is eventually pushed back by his country's army ($10timesamountofsoldiers), but they can't go over the border because $somekindofshield. Eventually the attacking country retires the troops and states that if the player's country doesn't give them $somethingimportant within 1 year, they will attack with their whole might which is rumored to be way more than shown even in the attack and the $somekindofshield hints at new technologies/magic (that maybe requires $something from player country for full scale use).  Now the player character is burned by desire for revenge and has a time limit to become strong enough and acquire enough information to prevent the attack, or reach enough power within the state to convince the government to make a deal with the attacking country.  All within 1 year.  Player has full freedom of how to grow, be it with side quests, military training accademy, grinding, infiltration in the enemy territory.  At the 1 year mark the whole main story starts. If the player has taken the diplomatic path, the main quest will be a big diplomatic quest, with travelling, diplomacy checks, economic analysis, ecc. Basically a first person RTS.  If the player has taken the war path, the attack will come and he'll have to fight or command (depending on his fame/power/respect, ecc ratings) to protect the country, and bring back the war into the enemy territory, eventually bring it  to conquering it and killing the ones responsible for the death of his family.  The player is free to attack even before the 1 year mark, if he considers his military status to be high enough level.  If the player has taken the infiltration path, he can slowly prepare traps and assassinations so that either by the 1 year mark the attacking country is greatly weakened, or the leadership is completely wiped out so that it can be conquered easily.  Ecc...  This is just something I whipped up in 5 minutes, I'm sure a good Game Designer could make something way better that works and would keep the player entertained."
truegaming,3bdvlp,Vignaccio,5,Sun Jun 28 16:16:43 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. That makes a lot more sense to me. Also, that sounds pretty cool. I was under the assumption you were describing one story mission, not the whole story, which was my problem. What you described sounds more integrated."

truegaming,3bdvlp,berrieh,13,Thu Jul 2 04:47:38 2015 UTC,"Moving on... Skyrim and the Witcher are both examples of an RPG where exploration takes precedence over the narrative.    I disagree with this. In Skyrim, exploration and freedom definitely take precedence over the narrative, but in TW3, I believe the narrative is King. Granted, the main quest doesn't fail or even change much (some dialogue lines changed for certain events being done/not done) because you do side quests - maybe that's what you mean? But the game is clearly narratively focused in a way that Skyrim is not.   I think the real reason players ignore the main story for sidequests in either games like Skyrim OR games like The Witcher is either A) side quests are more interesting, B) many people are ""done"" with the game when they finish the story or even worse than that, C) side quests might lock, fail, or be unavailable if they advance the story past a certain part (true in TW3 I believe). Additionally, in an RPG, there is a need to level/get to a certain amount of character strength to tackle specific challenges with ease.   I'm not really sure if this is a ""problem"" the way people say it is. I enjoy both linear and non-linear games, personally. In Skyrim, I'd suggest it's not a problem because the main story is not the core of the game. In Skyrim, it doesn't even matter if you complete a single quest. The core of the game is freedom and exploration. That seems to be the GOAL, not the narrative. However, in something like TW3 where the goal is the narrative, I'd say what would be interesting/cool is if the main quest evolved (not failed) if left too long, sometimes in good ways, sometimes in bad ways. That's very complex though, and we won't see much of that in big games ever and certainly not now. I don't actually find TW3 is very jarring if I leave the story at bits for side quests, mainly because many of the sidequests inadvertently tie in later and are mentioned in main quest dialogue even sometimes. I actually think they did an excellent job, though honestly I'd focus more on the main story if I hadn't read that some side quests would disappear if I didn't collect them (one did disappear on me that my BF found but I had gotten too far to get the !) OR even fail once I'd collected them if they were not completed.   I really thought Dead Rising 3 was a lot more fun than DR2 (DR1 I really like, so lets call it a draw there) because of the lack of a timer, so I don't think a timer is a good solution in general. It was neat in DR1, it got old in DR2, I was glad for its removal in DR3. I think a game like Skyrim would benefit from a better main story that ties into the side quests more. But I think The Witcher 3 does that. I think the best way to keep players focused on the main story is to make it a really interesting one. If I didn't know quests disappeared/failed in TW3, the main story would absolutely be my focus because it tends to be the best-written so far."
truegaming,3bdvlp,lotsofotherstuff,6,Sun Jun 28 14:05:45 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I don't remember who said it, but I remember someone saying to fix the feeling that the main storyline doesn't matter and that you can just go ahead and do whatever between the storyline mission, you could add a timer to certain missions. Not so the player fails the mission, but make it so the characters mention that it took time.  For example, you were told to meet a character at a certain place. If you mess around too long with other stuff, when you arrive the character will be annoyed that he/she had to wait for you for so long. It would give the story missions some weight and actually make it feel like time matters to the characters. I think that actually makes you want to do them in time, you don't make the player fail anything and you don't punish the player to much. To point out that The Witcher 3 actually does this with some missions."
truegaming,3bdvlp,TheBlackSpank,14,Sun Jun 28 15:09:13 2015 UTC,"I think CDPR did a good job of it with The Witcher 3. First of all, the main story is fantastic, so eventually you're going to want to get to it. Of course, the sidequests are just as good, so that may not be enough for everyone.   So they gave you more experience for finishing quests from the main storyline. A lot more. You won't get much for killing monsters, either. And you'll get a lot of sidequests early on that are much too high level for you, so the only logical thing to do is level up to be able to do them. Fastest way to do that? You guessed it."
truegaming,3bdvlp,wulfsburg,3,Sun Jun 28 12:47:59 2015 UTC,"Hands down, the Witcher 3 is the most intriguing open world game I have ever played.   BUT  The pacing/leveling system in the Witcher 3 is very flawed. Even with all the XP patches, you eventually out level the quests you get if you don't stick only to the main questline. And even on Death March, it gets very easy when you are 6-8 levels above the main questline because you did most of the side quests in the area of the main quest.   IMO, the XP system needs to be revamped to keep Geralt from being so OP by the time you decide to revisit the main quest. I don't think monster scaling is the answer either. I haven't gotten to Skellige yet, and hit lvl 19 yesterday.  I just did the main quests in novigrad, where you meet DuDu. I literally can 3 shot enemies, and I am on Death March. I am so overleveled for certain quests, that I only get 5 xp for solving them but what keeps me from abandoning the quests is the fact that the writing is so good.   So, its a little bit of a catch 22. I don't want to skip the side missions because they are so good, but I don't want the main quest to be so easy because I am overleveled. Ill probably just keep questing because I like the writing style, but I hate how easy it has become.  No mods to fix that yet either."

truegaming,3bdvlp,Shmutt,5,Mon Jun 29 00:09:12 2015 UTC,"One of Soldak's ARPGs, Depths of Peril, tries to address this by making the quest more and more perilous if the player does not address it in time.   Starts out as kill x number of monsters. If failed, the next quest is because of the failure, a monster leader has sprung up and you have to kill it. If not then the monster has captured a townsperson and you need to rescue him. If not the townsperson is now transformed to a monster and is now leading an attack on the town.   It's a pretty interesting mechanic that I've yet to see in other titles."
truegaming,3bdvlp,Shmutt,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:47:17 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to compare it to State of Decay: Breakdown, which has a similar concept. I'm doing this because I've yet to play Depths of peril.  This sounds like a great idea, the incentive to keep the player engaged in the primary quests while allowing the player some time to engage in other activities. However, and this was a problem with State of Decay: Breakdown, after failing too many missions it become difficult or impossible to progress.  Furthermore, is the incentive strong enough to push the player to complete the main missions. If you view it objectively the plot tree looks like: Complete Mission A -> Goto Mission B Fail Mission A -> Goto harder Mission B  In the end you're still going to do a subsequent mission either way. However, this idea seems to have a lot of potential and I think it could work on a triple A title. These are just two possible problems with it."
truegaming,3bdvlp,huntimir151,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:35:48 2015 UTC,"Perhaps it could work for an RPG or fps. An easy level 1 quest would become a level 2 quest upon failure. In fps, it could translate to a bigger spawn or a leader spawn with more health.   Yeah I agree that this kind of system has its own set of problems. In an open world RPG like Skyrim, such a system might make the game a quest manager instead of encouraging exploration.   Perhaps something like what Dragon Age Inquisition tried to do might make it work. Let the player deploy friends or hire adhoc adventurers to help.   In a way this system is akin to the nemesis system in use by shadow of Mordor. Failure to kill an orc captain will make him stronger."

The point to an open world game is to allow the player to choose their fancy  for what to do next.  Like many have pointed out, the exploration and side-quests in Skyrim and Fallout are often more interesting than the main quest.  Why would you, as a game designer, need or want to force the player into something they don't find to be quite as interesting?  Any method you use to push players toward the main quest will only go so far; there is a breed of player who will always shun the main quest so long as there is anything else to do.  They play open-world games for the freedom they provide, and they have been conditioned by so many games that shut doors behind them, permanently locking away content that they could've seen if only they'd put off the main quest a little bit longer."

At least, that's how I feel about it.  And yes, you're right about the completionist player. Hell, I am one.

truegaming,3bdvlp,getElephantById,4,Thu Jul 2 04:50:43 2015 UTC,"In my case, when I really love a game, I don't want it to end. That's why I will keep doing side missions and keeping away from story missions as long as I can, regardless of how interesting they are - because when the main quest has ended, the world is saved, the big baddie is gone etc, I no longer feel any need to progress in the world. I'm done. There may be bigger and more difficult enemies/monsters out there, but they just feel like menial and semi-irrelevant tasks, and I end up quitting or restarting the game.  That's why I always postpone main quests until there's absolutely nothing else to do, or I'm beginning to get tired of the game. I want to explore while I still feel there's some reason to keep going, something important I need to do.  Adding timers to quests, for no other reason than to force me to play them, is just a good way to make me hate the entire game."
truegaming,3bdvlp,RICHUNCLEPENNYBAGS,3,Sun Jun 28 15:18:03 2015 UTC,"Fewer, longer, more meaningful quests, with side quests available only at points in the main story's plot where they make sense, or even better, intertwine. Dragon Age: Inquisition for example, for all it's shitty side quests, had a few points where you were locked into a section of main quest story. Final Fantasy XII specifically mentions at certain key points that you won't be able to leave an area once you start down that portion of the main quest."
truegaming,3bdvlp,getElephantById,3,Sun Jun 28 15:56:57 2015 UTC,"You have to acknowledge the fact that most players are more interested in the side quests and exploration than in the main quest, and not make the main quest appear to be a ticking clock.   You're right that if the character is told ""the world is about to end unless you blank,"" then it's absurd to have the PC jaunting off to kill five rats for the local baker, or solve the mystery of the haunted lighthouse, or whatever.   On the other hand, if the main quest is ""I need to get revenge on the Baron for what he did to my family,"" then we can justify a longer time scale and a more discursive story. You can even argue that many of those side quests are about accumulating the resources necessary to accomplish your main goal, especially if the writing of the quest supports this."

That being said, Witcher/Skyrim are open-world while Dark Souls is more linear (with some sense of freedom, but still linear). Linear games are much better at controlling what the player experience, it allow for much better level design and storytelling and makes better games as a result.  But it all comes down to what the player want to play, not everybody like playing well-tweaked story/linear games like me, a lot of people love the ""don't tell me what to do"" and ""I just want to mess around, run in the forest and see what happens"" type of gamers, born out of sandbox (minecraft and garrys mod) games.  I think Skyrim is the game that try to attract both type of gamers at the same time, but I believe it would be better if developers would focus on one style only and make it the best they can. Skyrim may have been better by completely removing quests, while Witcher would have been better stayed like the second one, with linear levels."
truegaming,3bdvlp,Kar-Chee,3,Sun Jun 28 17:48:42 2015 UTC,"I think Fallout: New Vegas had an interesting way of dealing with it. If I remember correctly, after you deal with Benny the game is basically free roam, but still obviously referring to the various main quests. I got in trouble because I didn't realize that on my first playthrough and got too far into Mr. House's questline that it locked me out of some of the other faction quests. Aside from the issue of not informing the player of changes completing a quest can have, that's a good way of dealing with primary vs secondary quests. I don't think it could match with all storytypes though.  Majora's Mask had an interesting way in that even if you ignored the main storyline everything would reset in three days anyways.  I think something a lot of games could do is just let the player keep playing the game after finishing the main storyline, and possibly have NPCs react to that outcome differently than if you were doing their quest while still doing the main quest. I think Skyrim has that for the first part (I still haven't finished Skyrim, too many mods)."
truegaming,3bdvlp,RICHUNCLEPENNYBAGS,3,Sun Jun 28 22:55:41 2015 UTC,"I'm late, but I suppose I'll throw in. I've always felt that Fallout: New Vegas did a good job. The first half of the main quest basically tries to get you to explore some of the map, get acquainted, go on side quests and end up with gear in New Vegas. After that, any plot-important quest is written to be open ended and involve exploration. The game had a sense of buildup but it does a good job at letting the player set the pace, which I appreciate."

The more specific this type of notification is, the better, though I've never seen an example of one that was anything specific.  I'd love to see a game tell me something like ""Beyond this point, all sidequests below level 18 will no longer be available, do you wish to proceed?"" or something like that.  Also, for really OCD gamers like me, this makes us literlly try to do EVERYTHING but the main quest before we move on.

Once we do that, though, we'll need to act quickly, so make sure you've finished everything else you want to do first"" which is like one step short of ""go finish your sidequests you won't be able to do them after this"".

truegaming,3bdvlp,ebildemon,2,Sun Jun 28 18:42:32 2015 UTC,"I think the Witcher 3 does this fairly well, though its approach is fairly heavy handed. That is, it makes experience gain much quicker through the main quests than it does through the side quests. It also gives paltry experience from slaying monsters, thus discouraging grinding. It sucks that there is a wide open world that feels like you have to wait to do certain things, but it keeps the narrative at the forefront and the extra content in the background, where (in the case of the Witcher, at least) it should be.  Skyrim was never a game centered around the narrative. Hell, the entire TES series focuses on the world itself more than the story (post-Daggerfall at least). In a game like TES where player freedom is paramount then it becomes extremely hard to keep the player wanting to continue the story when they could just as easily spend hundreds of hours doing other things. Granted, I don't think any of these games do a good job with the narrative in relation to their open nature, as it becomes rather difficult to claim that someone is destined to save the entire world while they're over there punching rabbits and picking flowers instead. The sense of urgency is lost in TES games. I don't think that timed missions are the key here, though, as those tend to be more frustrating than anything else. Instead, I'd recommend a story that doesn't place the player into a hero role, or at least not right away. This way, if they want to run around and get into drunken fistfights then there is less dissonance between the narrative and the gameplay structure. There needs to be more meaningful events and crescendos in tone so that a player will feel that sense of urgency, and maybe even some consequences if they don't pursue those missions relatively soon (so, somewhat like timed missions, but the quest or area changes instead of being failed. It may even change for the better if a dev put this to clever use).  Lastly, one of the huge things, at least to me, is that there needs to be some good characters. The player needs to feel a sense of investment in the world other than their own character. Once again, TES does this really poorly as few of the characters in those games are memorable to any degree, let alone feeling like complex beings that inhabit the world they are in. They have a tendency to feel flat. The Witcher, and many linear games at that, have a large focus on their characters. The Witcher 3 is actually a good example, because if Geralt (and so you) learns that something happened or is happening to one of the other characters then (provided the player feels invested in them, which is key), even though one can simply run off and punch drowners for awhile instead, they should feel a sense of urgency that stresses them out. They need to feel like the situation is a now-or-never kind of thing. A focus of characters makes these kinds of situations far more common and more impactful.  tl;dr: Characters, world building, and a fundamental change of ""the chosen one"" as a plot device in some cases. Refining each of these allows for more player investment where it matters, and so keeps them on track because they feel like they should be on track."
truegaming,3bdvlp,godiebiel,2,Sun Jun 28 19:17:42 2015 UTC,"The problem is two fold. On one hand, games like Skyrim and Witcher make side quests available to encourage leaving the main quests. Why do you think the main story is usually Meh? In FO3 you're on a quest to find your father. There's not much more to it. In The Witcher, you're on a quest to find Ciri. The entire game is made for exploration. I'm only about lv. 10 in The Witcher and the optional quest to help The Bloody Baron with his family drama is one of the best quests, so far, that I've played. Heck one of the best side quests in recent memory.   The other side of the coin is to make side quests an after thought. Like most open world games. Take Assassin's Creed. The side quests are just distractions. Hey, kill this guy for the guild or for me and I'll give you some gold. It almost seems like and afterthought. Take random NPC and put them in danger an have the white cloak wearing assassin come to their rescue. The strength of these is how much you like the game or care. Even then the side quests become a chore and drags the game down. Tie it to a ""do so many of X quests to be able to unlock the next area"" and it becomes irritating. See side quests in games like INfamous."
truegaming,3bdvlp,TOM_THE_FREAK,2,Sun Jun 28 19:29:53 2015 UTC,Witcher 3 keeps you doing main quests because it's the only way you're realistically going to level up.    Monsters and side quests give you crafting recipes and treasure as rewards but not enough xp to really level up meaningfully.  A main quest on the other hand might give you enough xp to level up once or twice with one quest.    This is important because of the level requirements on weapons and armor.  It forces you to complete main quests otherwise you'll never be able to get enough xp to use better weapons to kill harder monsters.
truegaming,3bdvlp,Kosooki_mrav,2,Mon Jun 29 17:53:27 2015 UTC,"I feel that Fallout New Vegas during the first playthrough is my best experience of an interesting main story line that kept me interested. In case you have not played it, New Vegas's main quest funnels you through the major towns south of New Vegas. I was interested at this exploration especially since i was awarded by EXP. The quests are also limited in these downs. They were quick and simple but fleshed out the world. Because of these, the side quests still made me do the main quest.   My guess it is done to ease the player. After getting the main quests, you get bigger side quests with more locations and longer quest times. So for the  first half of the story, I never strayed far of the main path because i was interested.  OF course replaying New vegas, i skip to the main quest and go north of Goodsprings avoiding the Cazadors and Deathclaws. And cherry pick the side quests with good loot and short times. And mod quests."
truegaming,3bdvlp,voggers,2,Sun Jul 5 02:15:54 2015 UTC,"While I don't think a good Dev should force anything in open world games ... there are means;  Unlockable: items, NPCs, locations, player level, perks, only unlockable through the main quest which are required for completion of side quests (eg GTA, Dark Souls, Skyrim)   Time constraint: imbue the sense of urgency to push the player forward and not deviate from the main mission for long. Time of course is subjective: number of missions, level reached, real or game time (eg Dragon Age: Origins, Zelda: Majora's Mask)  Linear gameplay: just force the player into the main mission, by the use of NPC's, invisible wall or out of boundaries, insta-death or fail (eg Fallout)  Of course all the above can be used interchangeably, alongside, and sometimes even optional (considering the player's past choices). Just like forced camera angles, these aspects are (sometimes) necessary to fulfill the game's developer vision."
truegaming,3bdvlp,Douche_Kayak,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:17:53 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of the quest timers.  In Skyrim it makes sense as things are on a timeline.  Not played the others!  It would be god if a few quests didn't have a timer so you could explore but in game events escalate.  For example, don't want to kill the mother dragon yet?  That's fine but there are going to be a whole shed load of baby dragons in increasing numbers in the next 12 months in game time.  The key thing for me is the option though.  I let my daughter die of zombie infection by letting the timer run?  No end game screen but it does end the main quest line so I have to start it again if I want to play it."
truegaming,3bdvlp,Douche_Kayak,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:53:50 2015 UTC,"But if developers did make an awesome and engrossing story, there'd probably be a lot of players who'd just follow it, ignoring all the sidequests and secondary activities.  This is what I dislike about R* games. For example, in RDR, I tried some of the sidecontent and it really felt bland, and minigames were ok to try once or twice, but became boring soon after that. So I decided to ignore all of it and just pursue main story, but then all of that open world suddenly becomes meaningless. It actually becomes annoying to ride from point A to point B, just to deal with a linear mission.   What I'd like to see is an open world game where objectives are not strictly shown to you, but they're vaguely described so that you have to explore in order to pursue the main plot."

However, while it sounds good in theory, I'd like to see if it has worked in practice.  Witcher 3 did something like that and judging by the responses I've read it didn't work very well. Players still left the story by the wayside in favor of other activities. But as I said it has the potential to work."

Perhaps remove instantaneous fast travel, or replace it with something less drastic, and level-restrict/block/delay certain areas/event such that the player has to do side quests to level up, unlock areas or just waste time while the main quest progresses quite slowly in the midst of all else."

Not completely open world but multiple expansive maps that you can wonder around for hours and travel between. Sure you can clear out every map of every objective but eventually it forces you to move forward. When clearing out quest way points, it's not always clear which are the storyline until you do them. The story isn't a straight line. It's a series of experiences before moving you to the next chapter while giving you chances to return to previous areas whenever you want. It's not a matter of if you play the story but when. Also the side quests are mainly fetch quest which makes the mainline all the more interesting in comparison. Not necessarily a good thing but effective"

In most open world games, I either don't care about the main story and think of it as one of the quests I have rather than my mission, or the very opposite happens. Arkham City is a big offender on this, it has multiple interesting side quests but the sense of urgency I get from the main one makes me only work on it. The clocks ticking, I can't be fighting random criminals if this is going on!  However, on Knight, they add small bits of dialogue sometimes during the main quest that solve this. Say you're working on it and the next step involves getting a new upgrade from Lucius Fox. He will then say ""This will take me a little while, come by when you're ready"". I know that if I go right away, it will be done when I get there. But it gives me some in-world excuse not to. It allows me to think that those side quests are what Batman would be doing in those circumstances rather than something I want to do as a player because it's fun.  I believe it's very subtle, but it works wonders for me and let's me do a few side quests before thinking ""It should be ready by now, I should go pick it up""."

I don't get any enjoyment out of collecting things for the sake of collecting them, or helping out some virtual strangers with their ""errands.""  However, I understand there are more than enough gamers in the market who do enjoy these things so obviously the developers have to include them.

It felt more natural to me than the false sense of urgency of the main quest. Instead, usually whenever the next quest in a series came up, I would always feel obligated to jump on it right away, or ignore it completely for a long time. If they'd forced me to do other quests before coming back to the series, they could program in true urgency without sacrificing exploration.

I haven't played it but the whole civil war aspect makes it sound as though Skyrim could have been more suited to a more systemic system where the player can complete missions to help one side or the other and gradually give one of them the advantage. As it escalates there could have been random battles taking place in the world, organically increasing difficulty as the player becomes involved in larger skirmishes without forcing them into linear quests. Tasks to help either side could range from more complex quests to simply completing certain objectives (kill a dude in a place). The player would have stuff to do wherever they went without feeling as though they were just moving from one quest to the next, following markers.  On the other hand Dark Souls' take works well with its world as pretty much everybody interesting is already dead. It makes sense to be wandering these grand, but empty, structures alone and without much purpose since pretty much everybody is already long gone. You're just picking up the pieces so there's no real rush. It's not an epic, bombastic quest, it's a solemn, lonely journey."
truegaming,3bdvlp,CamBam65,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:09:27 2015 UTC,"Edit: I'm getting a few comments saying ""That's how it's supposed to be. Players are supposed to run off and do their own thing in their games."" I'd like to direct you to this comment which explains why it is important to strike a balance between primary objectives and secondary activities.   People not doing the main quest is not the problem, the problem is the false sense of urgency used to make us do it. The link you provided is about the false sense of urgency.   Contrast Skyrim to Morrowind. In skyrim each step of the main quest is presented like it needs to be done ASAP. In Morrowind you are literally told to create a ""cover story"" for your involvement in the blades, by joining a guild and climbing the ladder. You kind of had to anyways, since progressing in the main quest, IIRC, required higher skills than you had originally.   Baldur's Gate 2 also had a similar approach, where you had to raise a given sum of money before you could move on with the main quest, because that was the price your contact wanted for the info you needed to progress (this was reasonable, considering who they had to spy on, and how dangerous that could be for them).   You don't HAVE to create a false sense of urgency. And if you don't, it's then perfectly correct to allow your players to do other things than the main quest (in fact that's supposed to be the point of the open world game, not being forced into doing a main quest because it's more ""urgent"" than enjoying most of the content). The problem is when you tell players it's urgent to do something and then punish them for doing it (by locking side-quests, by making them too weak to actually do the things they have to do, or via god-awful writing (Bethesda games), or by breaking the immersion (ie: letting someone triumph over the greatest evil in the land at freaking lvl 1))"
truegaming,3bdvlp,Vovix1,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:08:51 2015 UTC,"Speaking on the Witcher 3, I think time limits would be a very interesting way to force players back towards the narrative.  For example, there are certain quests where you and your allies split up to accomplish different tasks. At that moment, the characters could decide to meet up at X location after 3 days. You have to finish the main quest and whatever else you want to do within that time frame. Or not finish the main quest if you so desire.  The problem I forsee is the increasing complexity of this system might make it impossible to do with current technology.  For example, say you miss the 3 day window, what then? Does the game continue without you? Or do the characters wait until you show up and then reprimand your tardiness with a line? The latter would be counterproductive since it doesn't enforce the time limit.  FTL is a game that developers could draw inspiration from. You can explore the different locations you jump to in FTL but there is this constantly encroaching red line that will make your life a lot harder if you let it get too close.  Of course, the red line serves the narrative in that game and might not work in a game like the Witcher. But, I agree with you, there needs to be some sort of impetus for players to prioritize the narrative quests when the story calls for it.  The issue I have with the Dark Souls approach, similar to FFX, is that it's fake open world. Yes, you have paths that diverge from the main one but they're so inconsequential whereas the more open world of the Witcher 3 really helps sell the world as a living, breathing being."

truegaming,3bdvlp,huntimir151,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:01:28 2015 UTC,"I think that, although there is a place for the kind of games you are describing (those open world games with a single narrative thread running through them), we should think of open world games as involving a different kind of narrative. Instead of trying to put a railraod experience in this vast world, why don't publishers embrace the inability of games to keep your attention, and put more effort in developing a shit ton of interesting side plots.  Perhaps, if anything, the story can be developed with a ""many paths one destination"" design where players experience different elements of the lore, but no matter how much you do, if you follow any line deep enough you'll reach ""the end game."" Or the ""end game"" could require going down multiple threads before anything is really uncovered.   A book or a movie might be better at capturing the single thread of narrative. But imagine if you could interact with the entire Middle Earth by just walking around and interacting with elves, dwarves, humans and hobbits? You're not trying to destroy a ring, but maybe you're a ranger with some small vengeance goal or something. The game play is about discovering the secrets of Middle Earth, you go down one path then discover the shit going down in Mordor, and another ""side quest"" might lead you to you find out about a small fellowship taking this mythical object to destroy it in the place of its crafting.  I think these open world games, if stuck on a single narrative timeline, might all bottom out at WOW clones or shallow main threads. These kinds of games aren't about being lead, they are about discovery. Maybe the player's hand shouldn't be held through the story. Maybe they don't want that at all actually. So embrace it. I am not saying do away with the main narrative, I guess I'm more suggesting entrenching the world as a main story, and just populate it with characters."
truegaming,3bdvlp,Eshido,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:35:10 2015 UTC,"Personally, I prefer games that work this way.  The Avernum series, for example, has a main quest, but you're kinda supposed to go exploring around everywhere, especially because if you don't you won't be powerful enough to tackle the main quests.  There are sometimes a few more difficult and more optional dungeons -- thinking of Avernum 3, mainly -- whose rewards really are worth the trouble, but given that there's no real way to grind in the game -- enemies don't really respawn, I think -- you really want all that experience in order to tackle the final gauntlet.  I think you can't both encourage free exploration and keep the player focused on the story.  They're mutually incompatible goals.  I think the closest you can really get is time limits for quests (which Avernum 3 actually has, but unless you're really wasting time, you can easily do everything in the game without reaching any of them)."
truegaming,3bdvlp,tocilog,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:06:09 2015 UTC,"I think a good way to balance side quests and the story is to separate the side quests into chunks and make it so you can only progress after continuing the main quest.  Souls games and Bloodborne do this well. In bloodborne a lot of the side quests begin near the start of the game and after finishing the first part of the quest you can't continue it until you trigger another ""world state."" To trigger these ""world states"" you have to beat bosses.  Batman Arkham Knight, as far as I've seen, also does something similar. As you begin the story side quests are slowly introduced by Batman running into them during the main story. After doing the first chunk of the quest you can't continue until Batman gets more ""Intel"" on it. Some of them can be found on your own volition, but you'll easily find them by continuing the main quest."

The recovery effort of the town is underway by the conquering storm cloaks. There could be certain rescue, recovery, and patrol side quests and events that could take place for the character to help with rebuilding efforts.  Maybe finding people missing and trapped under rubble, with a time limit of the sun dropping or a building collapsing from slowly spreading fire pushing the player along gently. Searching for stolen heirlooms. Making sure lawlessness doesn't take over the city.   That way the player can be pushed towards the action at certain few choke points, unlocking more and more story than they had before the main quests were completed."

But I think all of the technical issues they had to fix on the PS3 really bogged the dev team down and prevented that from happening. Granted, dawn and dragon born's stories were great, especially because of the locations of each. It was nice to be able to go back to Solthseim (spelling?) and all that, and the apocrypha books added some nice perks to the game (as long as the quest for the one in that mage's tower didn't glitch the woman you find dead) but they definitely could have had a much larger expansion for the game playing out the war."
truegaming,3bdvlp,SpawnPointGuard,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:16:46 2015 UTC,"I've thought of this a couple of times and I'm thinking of this idea of an open, progressive storyline.  Basically plot points occur at certain points in time with or without the player's intervention.    ie. robbers will attack a bank at noon in two days.    Let's call it an event rather than quest.  The info can get to the player in different ways.  From an NPC contact, a rumor mill, etc.  OR if the character missed it, over the news.  Now the player can choose to participate in the event in different ways.  Try to get in touch of the robbers an join them, the player may play as a cop responding to the event (or trying to prevent the event from occurring), be a bystander.  Depending on whether you participate or how you participated in the event, certain events becomes available.  At the same time different events occur at the same time at different parts.   Participation in certain events can also be dynamic.  For example, you didn't know about the bank heist, but you just happen to be in that area or in the bank at the time.  Or, you hear a noise down a dark alley, you investigate and find a crime or you ignore it and you hear news about a murder the next day.  The point is to remove the notion of main quests and side quests.  Right now when games talk of choice, it's ""good or evil"", ""guns blazing or stealth"".  This way choice (or lack there of as some events occur and you stumble on it) truly affects storyline.  It's dynamic and unique for each play through.    I was thought of this while playing Skyrim and just thought of how quests and progression is really just a checklist and that's true for a lot of games, not just Skyrim.  Of course an issue with what I described is that you WILL miss out on certain events and elements in one playthrough maybe even gameplay element (bank robber/cop, wizard/knight, etc would have different perspectives of an event and even certain events trigger for them) therefore you will not have that list of 100% done in a single playthrough.  In that sense, this focuses more on the role-playing aspect rather than the gaming aspect (ie. gathering best equipments, targeting strongest monsters, etc)."
truegaming,3bdvlp,Kardlonoc,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:36:38 2015 UTC,"Arkham Knight does a pretty good job of this. Occassionally you'll need some sort of upgrade or outside helo to progress with the story, and Lucius of Alfred tell you that it'll take some time to prepare it. Alfred will then remind you of some of the sidequests available. This gives you a good narrative reason to delay the main story missions for a while, and you can actually carry on with the next mission immediately if you want.  Another thing I like about the side quests was in City too. It's difficult to actively continue most of the side quests. For a lot of them, you'll simply find something (a kidnapped firefighter, a corpse, etc) while you're gliding about the city. You can deal with them fairly quickly and then carry on with what you were doing before, without interrupting the story."
truegaming,3bdvlp,Silvershanks,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:46:59 2015 UTC,"One of the things not touched on is how players are being rewarded for doing non-storyline content. I'm not saying go full retard and give zero xp for anything that isn't a storyline quest, but this gives the designers an opportunity to tinker with existing things like loot.  For example, why can I get rich in Skyrim by screwing around in dungeons? Why doesn't anyone else bother to loot all these low level draugr? Perhaps make the storyline quests dole out the bulk of the player's money and have sidequests do rewards in other ways like for example increasing the player's standing with a particular faction, or learning some lore (which could be put to use as speechcraft/reaction bonuses, I love the TES books and all but, ugh, keeping track of them was a pain).  Make the storyline more compelling in comparison - for example the dragons in Skyrim sucked. After the first couple of scripted ""oh wow"" encounters, dragons quickly devolved into nuisances since they were to easily killed, and too often found. These were supposed to be creatures of legend ffs, I shouldn't be cursing one just because it killed my goddamn horse. (""Oh shit, a dragon!!1!"" vs ""motherfucker, there goes another horse."") Dragon's Dogma had some of the nicer ARPG dragon combat even if it also got a bit routine at higher levels.  Most of us do sidequests also because in many RPGs you don't get to backtrack and thus lose access to said quests. If the quests were less about material rewards and more like things like increasing faction standing - still important, but not something you worry about missing - then it wouldn't be so bad."

You don't play Halo for the same reason you play Mass Effect, even if they're both sci-fi series with a lot of shooting in them. So Halo gets to be a console FPS while Mass Effect is a WRPG."

The concept is taken from films/books/etc, but it doesn't really work because for those sort of entertainment the genre describes the tone of the content but for games the genre tries to describe the elements of gameplay and there are far more gameplay types and combinations thereof than there are tones of content.  Think about trying to put genre names on Fallout 3 and Mass Effect. You could describe both as ""Open-World RPG Shooters"" and while that would be an accurate descriptor for both games it would not be a precise one, as the games play very differently. I don't think it's a solvable problem, there is no new set of genre names we could come up with that would work without requiring a dozen words per game, it's just that games are too complex to be encapsulated into a simple group of genres."
truegaming,3bd9cw,Togra_,3,Sun Jun 28 03:48:37 2015 UTC,"The Action RPG genre might be nebulous. Action RPGs could just be called Action RPGs, or JRPGs with action-based, random battles (such as Star Ocean or Tales of Phantasia). But the JRPG baseline has fairly clear traits, imo.  Turn based, random battles. Open worlds, but typically multi-layered, with a ""world"" map in which you enter icons to reveal more maps you can walk on. Towns with items and/or inns, or equivalent. HP and MP, or some equivalent. Usually the need to level up, and often the need to grind, in various degrees, to progress. You ""talk"" to people by touching them and pressing a button (sometimes just by touching them, but that was a bad design; initially you had to select a menu and then choose to talk), and typically you must trigger events, and sometimes make the right choices by ""talking"" to people in this way.   The first JRPG was Dragon Quest so any game that shares most or all of its characteristics can be considered a JRPG. But other than opinion, it's not a binary trait. You can interpret games in the gray-area to be different things. Games such as the Steam game To The Moon could be a JRPG, except there are no random battles (the game actually mocks them), no stat system, no open world with towns, etc. It could just as easily not be considered a JRPG. But if there was a legal definition, it wouldn't be too hard to discern when a game is trying to fit into it. To The Moon is trying to be different (all the way to mocking not just random battles, but all battles), so I wouldn't call it a JRPG.  So if you consider intent, it's usually not hard to characterize a game as being part of a certain genre or not. jmo"

Not exactly looking for answers or anything, just more interested in discussing genres, how they came about, how they affect how we recommend games, and maybe where we're going next with them."
truegaming,3bd9cw,pnt510,3,Mon Jun 29 08:53:39 2015 UTC,"The same thing can happen with movies too though. You ask someone to recommend an action movie and maybe one person gives you a light hearted super hero movie, while someone else gives you a dark violent crime thriller from Asia. Both action movies, but still very different. Genre are extremely broad, but they can still be a useful tool. If you want to be more specific then you can always narrow it down by sub genre."
truegaming,3bd9cw,videogameboss,3,Wed Jul 1 04:39:51 2015 UTC,"Does this therefore make every game that is both Japanese and RPG a JRPG?     yes.     Some would categorize JRPGs by turn-based combat and navigating menus. Where does this place the Japanese action RPGs then?      those people are wrong. japanese action rpgs are JRPGs.      What about Western games that adopt traits from JRPGs, what are they?     western games.      And on the flipside, what about Japanese games that adopt traits from WRPGs?      japanese games.     i can't understand why some are so determined to define JRPGs as something other than a japanese RPG. every time they try to explain what a jrpg is, they describe final fantasy as if that's the only JRPG there is. it shows their ignorance and inexperience. if you want to recommend games and seek recommendations, improve your diction and use other terms like ""turn based"", ""action"", etc. if you don't care specifically what region a game is from."
truegaming,3bd9cw,xiipaoc,2,Thu Jul 2 04:49:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, names don't usually make sense.  Why, for example, are the Zelda and Metroid series not in the same genre?  I feel like Metroid is a shooter -- in the Prime series, a first-person shooter -- and Zelda is an adventure game, or action-adventure, or some such.  Actually, they both play... about the same, with a somewhat different structure.  In both series, you find some upgrade that lets you do more exploration, do more exploration, find another upgrade, etc.  They're just organized differently.  I think the main thing here is that you just can't go by labels.  Labels are purely marketing phenomena and have little to do with the game itself.  Just stop trying to categorize the games -- or music! -- into nonsensical categories, and you won't have any issues with inconsistent genres."
truegaming,3bd9cw,page0rz,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:40:17 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree that categorizing is an imperfect thing, but I can see why people do it, since it does help with clustering similar shared components of games. Probably what bothers me the most about these is when asking for a recommendation for a JRPG, a person can be recommended a ton of different games, even if same in style and tone, are completely different in gameplay. I can see where having more precise descriptors may help in this case."
truegaming,3bd9cw,IdeaPowered,3,Sun Jun 28 04:07:32 2015 UTC,"You are being unfairly broad with your terms here, and ignoring that genres also include sub-genres.   Why can't a JRPG be a turn-based menu-driven combat game, or a real-time combat game? One could be a turn-based JRPG, the other an action JRPG. The same way there are arena FPS and also tactical FPS and nobody with more than 2 brain cells to rub together has any trouble telling them apart."
truegaming,3bd9cw,ExtendedBox,0,Sun Jun 28 04:01:46 2015 UTC,"I totally agree that sub-genres do help. It's just more of a concern when asking for recommendation of games using a broad term. RPGs as a whole seem to be clearly divided, at least in the communities, between JRPG and WRPG, which are arbitrary divisions based on their geographical origin. While there's generally a set of consistent traits that are found frequently within them, there's also a lot of overlap, especially with games like Bloodborne (a Japanese game that plays like a WRPG) and Child of Light (a Western game that plays like a JRPG, though I guess it has more to credit to indie platformers than anything)."
truegaming,3bd9cw,IdeaPowered,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:10:03 2015 UTC,"I disagree that Demon Souls and all the games after are much of an RPG. It has RPG elements, but to me it's more of a Fantasy Brawler. The only ""RPG"" in all of those games is stat points. That's all.  If they added stat points to Bayonetta, would it make it an RPG?"
truegaming,3bd9cw,boopaboopa,0,Sun Jun 28 11:56:19 2015 UTC,"I disagree, you can also customize your character, weapons, and armor to varying degrees. You can play as a tank, agile like character, mage, or a combination of any. There are plenty of stat/other effect boosting items scattered throughout the world that can heavily change the way you play. With a focus on loot to help you fight harder enemies, I think all of this combined makes a pretty convincing argument that the Souls series is RPG."

There are still a ton of turn based combat RPGs being made in the West.  And Fallout 3/NV is technically a hybrid of both turn based and real time. If you have a high enough Agility you can spam VATS the entire game, for the most part.  Also ""virtually every"" =/= three series of games."
truegaming,3bd9cw,boopaboopa,2,Tue Jun 30 03:36:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Like I mentioned in another post, the turn based mechanic evokes some peculiar hangups in some people. I don't know why. Because I've been gaming since the 1980s and I can assure those people there are turn based games everywhere, not just JRPGs.  Hell, the SSI Gold Box AD&D games in the 1990s were (1) turn based, and (2) had random encounters. Nobody in their right mind would consider AD&D games as JRPGs..."
truegaming,3bd9cw,page0rz,0,Tue Jun 30 06:05:56 2015 UTC,Every Final Fantasy game from XI has been action based so that's not a very good argument in favor of JRPGs being turn based. I think RPGs being action based is more a sign of the times than geographical location.

truegaming,3bd9cw,lincolnsgold,3,Sun Jun 28 04:30:13 2015 UTC,"I'd define JRPGs as any turn-based RPG with that distinctly Japanese/anime-esque design. You know what I'm talking about - characters designed with outrageous hairdos and equally outrageous fashion sense. On a more pragmatic level, it's just ""any RPG that strongly resembles Final Fantasy."" That actually sets up a fairly strict set of constraints on what qualifies as a JRPG.  On the other hand, dungeon crawler is more of an umbrella terms with very loose constraints on its genre. Its distinguishing feature - exploring  dungeons - can be approached in an infinite number of ways. Unlike JRPGs, there is no single game that every single dungeon crawler can be compared to.  Simply put, some genres are defined more narrowly than others."
truegaming,3bd9cw,adrixshadow,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:09:22 2015 UTC,"Game genres are muddled for the same reason that music genres are muddled - they're created by marketing departments in order to sell as many copies of a game as possible. Roguelikes are hot right now which is why everything under the sun that has procedural generation and permadeath is being called a roguelike at the moment. I think FTL is a great game but as soon as you move away from a grid and turns (pausing isn't taking a turn) calling it a roguelike becomes a huge stretch in my book.  Showing my age, I'd say that I first heard the term ""dungeon crawl"" in reference to old ""CRPGs"" like Wizardry, Bard's Tale, and Baldur's Gate. None of these had procedurally generated dungeons, so I would definitely disagree with you that that should be in the definition. I'd say the common features were:    you spent most of your play time in dungeons that existed in constrained areas maps are pre-generated and learning the dungeon maps on paper was an important component (especially in Wizardry/Bard's Tale because you were making repeated expeditions deeper and deeper into the same dungeon). you didn't have a specific single ""hero"", you led a party of several adventurers that complimented each other character classes, races, stats and items were heavily influenced by D&D almost all plot development, if any, happened above ground between dungeon expeditions no permadeath and if you play well, you can finish the game in a single play through without knowing what you're doing from the start   I see classic roguelikes as fairly distinct from this category. The focus is on a single hero, dungeons are procedurally generated so there's not a mapping element, and permadeath is designed to make each session a learning experience. I expected to play nethack over and over and enjoy the element of learning while I expect that once I've beat content in a CRPG I'll be moving on to something else or be able to quickly circumvent content I've done before.  JRPGs tend to have simpler mechanics all around and put the player into the role of a hero. The early Ultima series probably influenced this class of games. I don't think I heard Ultima referred to as a ""dungeon crawl"" but it was definitely considered a CRPG. In general there was way more going around and talking to people in JRPGs than early western CRPGs.  These days I don't make any assumptions about what ""dungeon crawl"" means beyond ""a game in a fantasy setting, at least part of which involves killing lots of monsters in confined maze-like spaces"". It's a high level descriptor and I don't think it was ever terribly well-defined from the start.  edit: I think the solution to this problem is to not use a single ""genre"" label for any game but to list mechanics. People in the Euro board gaming community seem to have a pretty good handle on that, but I don't see it being done very well/consistently for computer games."
truegaming,3bd9cw,IdeaPowered,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:35:43 2015 UTC,"Their meanings are very specific in Japan though. A DRPG (Dungeon RPG, short term for 3D Dungeon RPG, yeah...) specifically refers to games like Wizardry, Digital Devil Story, and recently games from Experience, which are all first person dungeon crawler.  A JRPG (short term for Japanese RPG) means very literally, any RPG game made in Japan is JRPG. Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Tales series, Persona, Pokemon... are all JRPG. Recently this term usually has negative meaning, in these case they usually mean games like FF which has no story freedom at all, games like Tales which is anime oriented, and games like Neptune or Atelier which are mostly focused on moe culture. The game which received most criticism, and used as most common example of JRPG, is Final Fantasy XIII.  That being said, popular games like Pokemon, Valkyria Chronicles, and Xenoblade Chronicles are also JRPG. Mostly JRPG is a term used opposed to western made RPG (hence WRPG). By the way, whether or not Demon's Souls and Dark Souls are JRPG is still controversial, some hardcore gamers call these games Western-style JRPG and didn't consider them pure JRPG."
truegaming,3bd9cw,lincolnsgold,-5,Mon Jul 6 01:54:13 2015 UTC,"""JRPG"" shouldn't be used anyway, because it doesn't describe what people typically use it to describe.  I usually see it used to describe games with a linear story, and commonly turn-based gameplay. Which are certainly not exclusive to Japan, nor are open-world, action-based games exclusive to the west.  It's reasonable to have a divide, because Skyrim is a pretty distinct game from, say, Final Fantasy X, but to name them by region just stinks of xenophobia. So I use 'Narrative RPG' for more linear, story-heavy games.  The only games 'JRPG' describes are RPGs from Japan, which are so varied that there's no point in calling that a genre."
truegaming,3bd9cw,IdeaPowered,2,Sun Jun 28 06:55:10 2015 UTC,The difference between WRPG is they usually have more defined and less choices.  It has nothing to do with xenophobia.  Players usually have some idea that their different even if they don't have a clear view of that difference.
truegaming,3bd9cw,lincolnsgold,2,Sun Jun 28 09:50:37 2015 UTC,"ElderScrolls and FF as a series are pretty good examples of why one is JRPG and the other is WRPG.

truegaming,3bd9cw,IdeaPowered,-1,Sun Jun 28 11:54:21 2015 UTC,"No, they're not. Citing common examples doesn't take away from the point:  There is no set of traits so universal to Japanese - made RPGs that it makes sense to name a subgenre after the place the games are made.  ""JRPG"" tells you nothing about a game. It only works if you have a preconceived idea what it's supposed to mean, and even if you do, it's inaccurate. That this topic exists at all goes to show that it's confusing.  As a category, it's ineffective, and it shouldn't be used."
truegaming,3bd9cw,lincolnsgold,2,Sun Jun 28 15:00:44 2015 UTC,"It makes sense because when RPGs were being developed, it was easy to tell which ones were made in Japan.

As a category, it's ineffective, and it shouldn't be used.   If you just say that and walk away sure. But then ANY and ALL categories are pointless then. As are ALL adjectives to describe a thing.  ""What does Pete look like?"" ""He's Caucasian."" Well... good luck identifying him!  There is no trait that is universal even to the genre itself. RPG. So, we shouldn't use RPG either since it isn't universal. Hell, ALL games are RPGs as you are always playing the role of something then, aren't we? If we go down your road we end up at a place where each game would need it's own name as they are a mishmash of many other things. However, the MAIN cubby they fit in allows us to give a general direction and then give further details.  ""It's a standard JRPG fare but it has real-time combat and no leveling up"".  As a subtag, JRPG let's me know that there is a very high probability it will have certain tropes, gameplay styles, aesthetic style, and what I will be doing as a player."

Aesthetic is quite easily one of the top reasons.   The earliest Dragon Quest games, as well as the original Final Fantasy, more closely resemble today's open-world RPGs than they do, say, current Final Fantasy titles. They're open-world, nonlinear, with no narrative, just a quest and a hero or heroes meant to make their way.  Visual aesthetic, not unlike 'Japanese', is irrelevant when you're trying to describe how a game plays. If I'm trying to tell someone about a game--the exact situation when a game's genre might matter--I'm not going to be trying to sum up its aesthetics with a genre.  I'd accept that there might be a fair difference in opinion here, but I can only think of one game I've played where I've considered the aesthetics more important than the gameplay (Child of Light).   If you just say that and walk away sure. But then ANY and ALL categories are pointless then. As are ALL adjectives to describe a thing.   You know this is nonsense, right? I don't need to explain to you that this is nonsense?  I don't want a situation where every game has its own subcategory,  I just want the categories we use to make sense.  ""3D platformer"" gives me an immediate idea of how a game plays.  ""FPS/3PS"" gives me an immediate idea of how a game plays.  ""Real-Time Strategy"" gives me an immediate idea of how a game plays.  Duke Nukem 3D is a completely different aesthetic than FEAR, but they fit under the same umbrella.  Warlords Battlecry 3 is completely different game on many levels than Starcraft, but they fit under the same umbrella.  Genre categories sum up what a game is like. ""JRPG"" does not. When you bring a preconceived notion of what it's supposed to mean, sure, you think it does, except as evidenced by this thread, it's not consistent for different people.  What's a JRPG play like? Is it turn-based? Star Ocean, Tales, and even some Final Fantasy games beg to differ.  Is it anime-styled? Not always, but commonly, but again, that tells us nothing about the game.  Is it linear? Probably. Early games weren't. Valkyrie Profile is kind of an odd man out. Dark Souls is an RPG from Japan, so it's only reasonable to call it a JRPG, right? Wizardry: TotFL isn't especially linear. So, yes, but with exceptions?  The term is a mess. It's inconsistent, it's opaque.   ""Narrative RPG"" captures the majority of what people consider JRPGs, tells us about how the game plays (An RPG with an emphasis on telling a specific story, usually with defined characters and few choices), and gets right to the point of the why people play it, without mucking around with visual features or this nonsense of labeling games because of the country they came from."

As for ""RTS"" being so simple a title.. you should join in on the discussion about MOBAs. I can think of at least 5 games that break that mold and aren't ""classic"" RTS, but people still call them RTS because of some other common threads. The most common thread is camera angle and units.  I can do what you do about any genre if I were so inclined.  JRPG games have commonalities going through it. Just click the steam link and go through the games. They have a lot of things in common.   ""Narrative RPG"" captures the majority of what people consider JRPG.   That title is even worse.

Name an RPG that doesn't tell a specific story.   and gets right to the point of the why people play it   Your definition is worse and doesn't actually do that. I play Tales games, especially ToV because I love the combo system and the characters. I love the endless dungeon. It's also quite big and it tells more than one story.

People say ""FPS like COD"" or ""FPS like Quake 3"" or ""Oldschool FPS"". They don't just dump one descriptor and walk away. Same as ALL other adjectives when describing something detailed. Like my example of Pete. ""He is a man"". Congrats. Man he is. Man is RPG/FPS/RTS.  Click the Steam link for RPGs and read the tags.

truegaming,3bar9g,lazylearner,141,Sat Jun 27 12:20:43 2015 UTC,"There are a small handful of ways that combos work. For the most part, it's just a series of attacks that you can pull off on an opponent before their hit-stun ends.   Every move you make has a certain number of starting frames* (where the attack is winding up or charging), a number of hit frames (where you can actually hurt somebody with it), and a number of recovery frames, where your character is recovering from the swing.  So, if you want to combo, all you have to do is use a couple of moves where the total length of the move is less than the amount of time that it puts somebody in a hit stun. This is called ""frame advantage.""  Of course this is made more complex by the fact that they can react to counter your moves, that some moves will launch your enemies in the air, and that most move will push you away from your enemy. So you really just have to practice. If you go online you can see that people will post ""BnB"" guides, which stands for bread and butter, as in ""these moves are the bread and butter of your character.""  So to keep it simple: a combo is just a series of moves that your opponent can't block. Most of the time they're not programmed in as much as tracked; you can technically ""combo"" a lot of things, it's just that most of the stuff you try won't be any good, for basically the frame stuff I wrote about last paragraph.   The last bit I want to say is that some games do have pre-determined combos- specifically I'm thinking about Mortal Kombat/Injustice and Soul Calibur. In those games, pressing light punch once and hard punch twice results in a very different string of attacks than light punch twice and hard punch once. Still, though, a lot of the actual combos involve the players stringing together these sequences into longer and more difficult chains.   For combos that require you to do more complex pad motions (1/4 forwards, or qcf), really, they're not that bad. You just have to practice. I've been playing fighting games since I was a wee lad, but I've gotten to experience one of my best friends trying to teach herself to do it and let me tell you it's all just down to practice. You have to be able to manipulate the stick within a very, very small timeframe and do it 100% reliably. Missing an input, as you've noticed, leads only to sorrow.  *A frame is just what it sounds like: fighting games almost always run at 60 frames per second, so it's 1/60th of a second. People will usually post the frame data online, if you're curious to see the actual numbers."

truegaming,3bar9g,page0rz,11,Sun Jun 28 02:10:49 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the way most games are played you aren't simply using the same combo over and over, theres a LOT of factors. (depending on game, of course. 'anime fighters' have more extensive combos than street fighter-ish games)  It can depend on:  your opponent (hitbox, size, weight)  both his and your position on the screen,   what move you open the combo with,   if its a counterhit or not,   how much meter you have,   if you have activated certain buff or stance specific to your  character,   if you want to bait their burst/combobreaker  how you want to end the combo, like opting for a (hard) knockdown instead of more damage, or a combo that carries your opponent to the corner or gives you more time to set up a new mix up.  (I'm sure I've forgotten some factors lol)  edit: those factors are the reason I never understood what people mean by 'dial a combo'. Yeah, I can go and play any Marvel vs Capcom game and fire off my c.LP, c.HP, c.LK, c.HP, cancelled into a special, cancelled into a super move braindead combo, which will probably work with 75% of all characters and deal absolutely no damage, or I could go and study the actual combos that require effort and aren't simply remembering the inputs.

truegaming,3bar9g,weealex,2,Sun Jun 28 19:44:40 2015 UTC,"""Dial-a-combo"" often refers to a ""magic"" series of moves that deliberately cancel into each other so that they combo really easily.  It forces you on a set path: after the first move, it's programmed so that you can stop the animation early with a specific second move, and so on.  It forces a specific combo path with a really inelegant system compared to the simple ""move does x hitstun, so moves with x startup will combo"" system."

truegaming,3bar9g,page0rz,0,Tue Jun 30 22:45:52 2015 UTC,Only because of the fall off mechanic vs health bar. Universal and simple controls is something the 'traditional' fighters could easily adopt.
truegaming,3bar9g,c010rb1indusa,2,Tue Jun 30 22:48:42 2015 UTC,"And blocking, and meter management, and items, and ledges, and tech traps, and throw and reversal mechanics, and ground games, and corners, and walls, and low/mid/high attacks, and a thousand other things that are completely different.   Saying that they could all adopt a 2 button control scheme is a bold statement. Most fighting games flat-out would not work in any way resembling their current forms if they were to do that."
truegaming,3bar9g,page0rz,0,Tue Jun 30 23:29:06 2015 UTC,"lol, it sounds like you'd love Melee then out of most of the smash bros, as it is inherently (even more so than other traditional fighting games, if not ALL) more competitive in terms of options / option coverage  blocking - covered  meter management - covered [percent management is basically the same if you actually played Melee in depth, certain percentage are guaranteed set up kills]  no items - covered  ledges - true  tech traps - covered (in melee)  throw - covered  reversal mechanics - covered   ground games - ...definitely covered lolwut  corners - covered  walls - not covered!! unless of course you are on Pokemon Stadium but that is a very rare case so you get the ""Right"" on that  low/mid/high attacks  - covered  so basically Melee has everything you want in a traditional fighting game, but at its highest peak it's actually the most technical game out there lol (and the frame data proves it!). Of course it's mostly humanly impossible but still just knowing the ceiling says a lot! Here is a video for technical / option coverage from a VERY long time ago (the meta has advanced a shit ton since then lol) for those interested!   How fast is Melee?  Not sure if you're in the know or not, but the FGC generally has given Smash Melee a huge amount of respect because they actually opened up to how deep the game is. A lot of MvC and SF pros tried melee and of course they all more or less agree that the game is ""fucking hard"" lol, to quote a SF player xD.   hope this makes more people curious about the Melee community!!! Just be sure to avoid /r/smashbros for any serious content as that community is very toxic, the IRL community is 1,000x better xD   Oh ya and don't mistake what I said for Melee to apply for Brawl and Sm4sh, /u/page0rz is completely right in the majority of the rest of his analysis for those games!  Melee is just the exception haha"

It just seems like a huge barrier to entry that hasn't evolved to become more accessible like other game genres have over the last 20 years or so. Marvel v Capcom 3 had a 'simple' combo mode that made playing the games with friends so much better than your regular fighting game. That's just my 2c."
truegaming,3bar9g,c010rb1indusa,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:52:31 2015 UTC,"late response but wavedashing in melee is totally different per character lol, like the timing for instance of doing it with Fox vs. Falcon is totally off. it's basically another muscle memory skillset per char, which could be argued that it is equivalent to learning a new combo too. Same buttons, different timing, making it extremely volatile in sequences that require multiple wavedashes.  but uhh ya that's all I wanted to say lol, just fixing your one erroneous point xD"
truegaming,3bar9g,danielvutran,0,Wed Jul 8 01:43:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I could see that. I think part of the reluctance is that stuff like EO in Capcom vs SNK 2 broke the balance by letting you spam charge moves, etc."

truegaming,3bar9g,philowe2001,0,Sun Jul 19 17:58:44 2015 UTC,"Well of course they are but it can be positive or negative influence.  But for example if a combo starts with pressing the buttons X, Y but then requires an insanely long memorized combo bar to continue the combo from that point on despite the fact that the foe was stunlocked from the beginning of pressing X,Y is just a waste of time.  It adds an execution barrier without adding any extra depth. Basically it becomes a problem when two players that have the exact same playstyle but one has spent more time standing in the practice room memorizing button chains and nothing else has a significant edge over the other.  I would love to list a bunch of fighting games but to be honest I am pretty lazy.  This video sums up my opinion well enough.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7z-c_PCcJ4"
truegaming,3bar9g,Murky42,5,Sun Jun 28 11:38:46 2015 UTC,"I agree as well. I like the mental aspect of fighting games and feel like execution intensive combos should be seen as a necessary evil instead of a selling point.  You definitely need execution intensive combos in order to allow players to punish their opponents for a mistake and/or capitalize on a good play. If you don't have combos it will turn into a long drawn out slog where health bars are depleted one hit at a time. If you have combos that are too easy to execute you can end up with situations where players do them without really intending to which rewards button mashing or players don't have to commit to the combo beforehand which makes aggressive play too safe.  When it's taken to the extreme it does exactly what you said, though. If the combos become too hard to execute you get an arbitrary barrier which hurts the ability to compete at high levels for players who are great at the mental aspects of the game but have less nimble fingers. I think the sweet spot that games should aim for is combos which are difficult enough that players have to be trying to do a specific combo and have to commit to most combos before hit confirmation but that aren't so hard that only a small number of players can perform them reliably.  And coming at it from a different angle, if your combos are too rewarding you end up making everything that isn't combos obsolete. I'm not an expert on UMVC3 but as an outsider looking in it seems like the game has a ton of unique characters with unique play styles and moves but none of that really matters because the game revolves entirely around touch of death combos."
truegaming,3bar9g,SewenNewes,-1,Sun Jun 28 14:31:24 2015 UTC,"Alternatively just ensure that button mashing is heavily penalized by either being incredibly easy to counter or some other mechanic (stamina,etc). If a player that is merely button mashing is truly threatening then you either have A: A game with some issues or B: you are struggling with a button mashing player (git gud).  I don't play all that much fighting games but I really like DS2 pvp as it has quite a bit of complexity despite its relatively simple controls."
truegaming,3bar9g,Murky42,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:22:05 2015 UTC,"Buttonsmashers most likely will execute many punishable moves, won't block throws, will jump a lot(which in most fighters is very punishable) or they simply won't be able to defend themselves against your poking and zoning. They won't block anything most likely too so you could deplete their HP bar relatively fast with some short BnBs.  EDIT: At first I didn't like combos either, but after getting used to how combos work they play a bit like a rythm game. Also you will have certain points in your combo where you have more than one option about how to continue."
truegaming,3bar9g,killer_8,3,Mon Jun 29 15:27:04 2015 UTC,"there are significant differences in the combo game of most fighters. saying ""combos in fighting games are too long"" is about as vague a statement as ""guns in fps games are too strong.""  not all fighters play the same - something ultra street fighter iv and ultimate marvel vs capcom 3 play about as disimmilarly as two fighters can, in spite of sharing many of the same characters, coming from the same company, and featuring similar mechanics.   not all fighting games are designed for the same demographic. should guilty gear and marvel have the same combo length as street fighter? should counterstrike have aim assist like halo? if you don't like long combos, street fighter is fun, accessible, and popular - you'll still lose, but it won't be because you can't do huge combos."

truegaming,3bar9g,page0rz,2,Sun Jun 28 21:59:47 2015 UTC,"That video is all kinds of rambly and confusing. Max dances around the point and switches lanes half way through.   Are combos too long, or are combos too hard? Those are different questions. Holding Street Fighter ""One-frame link"" 4 up as a modern bastion of short, easy combos is ridiculous. The idea that combos used to be easier just because they were shorter is also wrong. Go and learn Akira's SPoD or DLC. Easy 3 hit combos, right? Those other examples are kind of stupid as well. The Marvel series is specifically known for long combos (despite what he says, every character in Marvel 1 and Marvel 2 had at least 1 infinite combo), as is Killer Instinct. Ignore that between Street Fighter 3 and Street Fighter 4 there was a decade of anime fighters and Tekken games, completely gloss over 3D fighters altogether, and he's still missing the point.  The reason games have longer combos now is because of damage proration. Well, it's both cause and effect in a way, but the point is that if you could land half the hits in Street Fighter 2 as you can in Street Fighter 4, it wouldn't matter because the round would have ended 5 attacks back.   Because people complained about that shit, too.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCkYLgzo1-k"

Consider Soul Calibur 5, which does a good job having a large number of useful moves for each character.  How could you make it any simpler than they do already? Put 20-30 buttons on the screen like WoW?   To have command over such depth, the control scheme found in fighters is necessary.  Extra, unnecessary moves don't add depth, but you don't have to do them."
truegaming,3bar9g,MeMosh,2,Thu Jul 2 23:02:37 2015 UTC,"Expanding a bit: Some games like the marvel-capcom crossovers have a thing where certain attacks can interrupt other attacks' frames (usually weakest to strongest attacks) similar to how in Street Fighter games special moves interrupt normal attacks' frames (some of them), knowing which attack interrupts what is useful to make combos.  Also some games have a different combo system (which I dont like!) where you have to punch in a sequence of button presses as fast as posible with no timing involved, examples of this: Star Wars: MoTK, Naruto and the 1st 3d MK."
truegaming,3bar9g,Apotheosis276,2,Thu Jul 2 17:39:32 2015 UTC,"The last bit I want to say is that some games do have pre-determined combos- specifically I'm thinking about Mortal Kombat/Injustice and Soul Calibur.

truegaming,3bar9g,kaleedity,17,Fri Jul 3 00:35:18 2015 UTC,"Modern fighting games tend to give you a lot of buffer time to input moves between frames.  Since that means little to someone outside of fighting games, I'll try to explain faster than the shoryuken article does (though you should read that):  The original Street Fighter game was notable for not having any kind of buffer when reading inputs.  Let's assume the game engine ran at 30 frames per second — that is, the game engine might have checked input from the controllers 30 times a second in order to see what moves you wanted to do.  In order to do a special move like the ""down, down-toward, toward, punch"" hadoken-fireball, you needed ""frame perfect"" entry; you needed to hit down on frame 1, diagonally down-toward on frame 2, toward on frame 3, and punch on frame 4.  This made it virtually impossible to consistently do these moves, even with a lot of practice.    Street Fighter 2 was notable for implementing a buffer input system.  You had (relatively) large windows of frames, fractions of a second instead of fractions of tenths of a second, to press buttons to complete special moves.  It doesn't sound like much, but the difference was that, with only a little practice, you'd be able to complete these special moves 90%+ percent of the time when you intend to do them.  You'd be able to execute the same moves slightly slower or slightly faster and still get the same output.  With a lot of practice, committing the wrong move becomes very unusual.  Different games go about extending combos or reading inputs a little differently from there, but most games feature these buffers nowadays.    Most games might have special moves and normal moves and super moves built into combos in any order depending on what's going on and what arbitrary rules each game features.  That sounds scary, but these moves tend to always function the same way, so you learn how to do a combo given a general situation and you can always do it against a majority of the characters in the game; ""character specific"" combos aren't too common.    Smash Bros. is unusual because knockback and hitstun caused by moves change more significantly with increasing damage and different character size and weight values and opponents can change how they get knocked by attacks by their own inputs.  That sounds awfully complicated too, but combos generally don't go beyond 3 or 4 hits in that game, and many characters can't really go beyond 2 hit combos.     Additionally, many games are, thankfully, heading in the direction of having simpler inputs to execute moves.  In addition to smash, you also have the persona 4 arena games where the most complex moves to input are like the hadoken described above."

That sounds awfully complicated too, but combos generally don't go beyond 3 or 4 hits in that game, and many characters can't really go beyond 2 hit combos.    This depends on which entry of the series you're talking about.   Smash 64 is rather famous for many of the combos being ""to death"", with the first person to land a hit often being able to combo the other player until the stock is taken.   Melee's best characters (Fox and Falco from the Starfox series, the ""Space Animals"") have properties (fast falling speeds mainly) which make them very susceptible to being comboed by the entire roster, and as such long combos are not unusual to see in competitive play. Some character matchups are fairly devoid of combos though.   Brawl/4 is much as you describe, where combos are much less prevalent."
truegaming,3bar9g,Red_of_Head,2,Tue Jun 30 02:35:19 2015 UTC,"If I remember right, combos in the original Street Fighter were a glitch, and were later integrated as an actual mechanic in SF2."

A lot of times, the specials are mixed in, and ends with whatever knocks the opponent down in order to set up the next combo.

Anyway, you're talking like these combos don't take hours in practice mode to get reliably down. You basically need to input a sequence of inputs to a reasonably precise rhythm - it's quite like playing piano in a lot of ways. And like playing piano, you have to practice and practice and practice until every hit in your combo happens reliably every time (top tip - if the next move you wanted didn't occur, but you're sure you input it correctly, then you did it too soon. if the move you wanted did occur and was blocked, but you're sure it's a combo that can work, you did it in too late)."

There's a marked difference between LoL/CoD and fighting games though - in LoL and CoD you get better by playing the game more, reading online strats, watching others play, etc. In fighting games you do that too, but you must also spend time training by not playing the game. Sat in training mode repeating combos endlessly so that you can pull them off in an actual game. It's like other sports... like having to do track training to play football better."

So much this. I've always really liked fighting games but the 1/4 swivel is something in 30 years of gaming I've never been able to do consistently enough to get any good at them. It doesn't matter what controller, or what game, I just can't ever get the diagonal in correctly. It's crazy frustrating and I've never been able to figure out what it is that I'm doing wrong. An entire genre of games that I otherwise really love have been ruined for me because of this one ubiquitous control movement that eludes me."
truegaming,3bar9g,baalroo,6,Sat Jun 27 17:11:25 2015 UTC,"Hm. What specifically do you find hard about quarter circles? Usually I just start either with by pushing down then rolling my thumb forwards (for a pad) or pushing the stick down to the edge of the gate, and then sliding it along the rim of the gate to forward (for a stick).  The ones I have trouble with are things that aren't pure arcs, and instead something like ""up, down, forward, down"" since those need more precision than just a roll. Although I eventually found out that many games don't actually require that those inputs be the only inputs, just so long as they are input within the relevant time window. So for instance for the ""UDFD"" above, you could actually do ""Up, Down, Quarter-circle to forward, Quarter-circle to down"" and it would still count, despite the two diagonals thrown in there. Similarly something like ""Up, Down, Back, Down, Forward"" could just be done as two 360 degree rolls, provided there isn't some other shorter combo that triggers off you doing that."

The ones I have trouble with are things that aren't pure arcs, and instead something like ""up, down, forward, down"" since those need more precision than just a roll.

truegaming,3bar9g,baalroo,3,Sat Jun 27 18:53:51 2015 UTC,"Hm, the diagonals shouldn't be any different from a pure direction. Don't think of them as ""two directions at once"". Using clock-face numbers, ""diagonal forward"" isn't you trying to enter ""3+6"", it's just you pushing the stick/pad at 4 (or 5, or somewhere between 4 and 5).  Soulcalibur moveslists often use a keyboard's numpad numbers to denote directions, so diagonal forward is ""3"", not ""2+6"". ""2,6"" would be a different move, which you could however input on a stick/pad as ""2,3,6"" using a quarter roll.  Inputting them as arcs to roll between can be nice because shoving your stick/pad down, then rolling it to forward and up can be faster than pressing down, releasing to let the input recenter, and then pressing forward, then releasing again to recenter, then pressing up. But if you can input them discretely fast enough without the roll, that's great."

Xbox 360s had an unusably terrible pad so presumably people on Xbox in particular use the stick, but it's popular on PSs as well. Either way rolling works the same on pads, but yeah pressing a pure diagonal on PS controllers' pads does involve hitting both (usually that just means I'm using my thumb diagonally across the inputs).

Effective combos are an array of moves that fit together well so that it's difficult or impossible for the other player to defend against subsequent moves once the first move lands.   Like I could do a punch punch kick ""combo"" but all those moves can usually be blocked, but if you start off with something that knocks your opponent into the air you've then got a decent window for getting in a lot of hits before your opponent is in a position to defend or retaliate.   In terms of button inputs, the quarter stick spin translates to very quick input of (often) down, diagonal down and forward (or back depending on the character and their move set) followed by a kick or a punch input to activate a particular move.   A given character will usually have a lot of moves that chain well in particular orders so the best players know when they get an opening which moves to play to give themselves the best shot at a high damage combo."

truegaming,3bar9g,samuelludwig74,5,Sat Jun 27 13:50:49 2015 UTC,"Street Fighter 2 Turbo on the SNES was the first fighter I ever played and the familiarity of those characters has stayed with me over the years, so I always feel most at home playing SF games.  I did really like the Tekken and Soul Calibre games from the PS2 era though."
truegaming,3bar9g,Suddenly_Dragon,2,Sat Jun 27 13:58:43 2015 UTC,"Oh of course! Gah! How can I forget to add those names.   My fondest memories were doing the backspin with Yoshimitsu in Tekken, lol! In fact, I think I enjoyed Tekken the most for it's easy-medium style combos. I could really do a lot with them.   I wish I could have been good at Marvel vs. Capcom. That game is the shizzz."
truegaming,3bar9g,samuelludwig74,5,Sat Jun 27 14:04:05 2015 UTC,"I'll weigh in here. As someone who got into the amateur tournament scene for a while for fighting games.  A combo is a set of attacks (that can include regular moves and special moves) that once it begins is un-interruptable. Each attack has a certain amount of 'hit stun' which makes the target of the attack unable to do ANYTHING until that 'hit stun' is over. So the long combo utilizes moves that will string together to keep the enemy hit stun for the duration of the combo. Most of these combos are built in to the game, but require tight timings in order to work. So say a combo is punch punch low punch kick (using very simplistic terms here), you may be required to press each button at a very specific time. We're talking fractions of a second. Some combos have very wide times to punch them in, some very short, or very specific times.   I'd say most games have easy and hard, but if I had to choose the hardest in my personal experience, probably something like BlazBlu or MvC2. Just the sheer length of combos in these games means a lot of memorization, muscle memory, and practice to achieve a level of execution that is useful."

truegaming,3bar9g,ToadingAround,2,Sat Jun 27 14:51:23 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm pretty garbage at MvC2, most of the guys I played games with were far above my level, so the bar to enter was fairly high. I mostly ran Psylock Megaman Akuma, Or Jill Megaman Akuma. Terrible teams, but fun to play if you aren't playing against top tiers."
truegaming,3bar9g,Apotheosis276,10,Sat Jun 27 19:33:46 2015 UTC,"This is a really strange question, and it's been answered pretty well so far, but I thought I'd add a couple of things.  There are a few different ways to combo, and while most games have elements of all of them, different games will rely more heavily on one type than another.  The most common is probably a cancel, where the recovery animation of one move is 'canceled' by pressing another button, significantly shortening the time between attacks.  Almost every game lets you cancel a normal attack (a regular punch or kick) into a special attack (something like a fireball), while a lot of the faster-paced games like marvel vs capcom will let you cancel a weaker normal into a stronger one or one of the same strength, allowing for much longer combos.  Next up are links, which are especially prevalent in street fighter.  These require you to finish the animation of your previous attack before going into a new one, and this is when things like the hitstun mentioned in other comments is important.  You can only link moves where [hitstun frames > (recovery frames of first move + startup frames of new move)], and they also tend to require much stricter timing than cancels, in some cases only allowing a one-frame window to work.  Almost all fighting games run at 60 frames per second, so you need to press the button in the exact right 1/60th of a second for it to work.  There are also ""target combos"", which tend to be more common in tekken, soul calibur, and mortal kombat.  These are combos that are essentially programmed into the game.  If you were to press a certain punch followed by a certain kick, the kick that came out would be unique to pressing it after that punch and will always combo.  Depending on the game, these can be pretty long (Julia from tekken comes to mind as having a few 10-button press target combos), and are arguably the easiest type of combo to do since they're ""pre-programmed"".  There are also juggles, where at some point during a combo you hit someone into the air.  In most games, either the recovery period when in the air is much longer than on the ground, or you won't recover at all until you hit the ground.  This means you have a much wider window to do your moves, allowing you many more options.  Almost any game with really long combos is going to involve juggles.  The only other thing work mentioning is probably that a lot of games (street fighter 4, melty blood, blazblue, guilty gear, marvel vs capcom 3) have some sort of 'rapid cancel' ability that takes some of your super meter (or in marvel vs capcom's case, happens when you use x-factor) to instantly cancel the animation of your current move and puts you into a neutral state.  This can be used defensively to allow you to block after making a big mistake, but also it can be used to extend combos to ludicrous lengths as it allows you to cancel any move into any other move, and in some cases resets damage scaling, hitstun scaling, or even both.  I guess I should also mention damage and hitstun scaling:  In almost every game (I can't think of one where this isn't the case), for every hit you do in a combo, you do less damage.  The amount of damage each hit is reduced by is called proration, and it's based on the initial hit of the combo.  Generally, the faster an attack is, the higher the scaling, as it's much easier to get a clean hit off of a jab than a haymaker.  Hitstun scaling isn't in as many games, but it tends to be protection against infinite combos.  As someone gets hit, they're in recovery for less and less time, narrowing the combo window until eventually you can't combo them anymore.  This doesn't come up very often-- you most commonly see it with a loop (where you can do a combo that cancels back into the first hit of the combo so you can combo it off of itself), so that instead of just killing them dead, you only loop it 3 or 4 times before it won't work anymore.  Of course, some games still have infinites...  My personal favorite is probably Blazblue, because that's the one I put enough time into to be sort of okay at instead of only barely better than a button masher."
truegaming,3bar9g,oridjinn,3,Sat Jun 27 16:02:50 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I didn't know about proration, although in hindsight it makes perfect sense.  Also worth mentioning is that some games reward frame-perfect timing even on non-combo moves, which in turn open up new combos. For instance in soul calibur, some characters have a regular move you pull off by hitting a couple of buttons in sequence, and are very tolerant of the timing. However if you hit those buttons on a much tighter timing schedule, do you a noticeably faster version of the same attack. So there are some combos you can only pull off using the frame-perfect version, because otherwise the frame advantage isn't enough to let you use the move as a link because your opponent's hitstun from the previous move wears off (probably especially relevant in games like Soul Calibur where you have stances to transition between which consume frames without necessarily stunning your opponent, and a combo might involve using moves from multiple stances)."
truegaming,3bar9g,formated4tv,3,Sat Jun 27 18:44:29 2015 UTC,"I used to play Killer Instinct on SNES.  I was pretty good, I guess, but really I only played against my younger brother so maybe not so much.  This was in the days of AOL.  In that game, there was an actual combo system.  A ""standard"" combo was an opener, a standard move, a linker, a standard move, and an ender.  There were rules for pairing them, too.  The way this happened was that you would do the opener move, and if you hit, you were now in ""combo mode"" until you did something to end the combo.  So you could use one of the standard moves, like a light punch or a medium kick, and instead of lightly punching or mediumly kicking the character would perform two or three hits.  Then you could do a linker, which was a special move that, instead of doing the normal action of the special move, would do some other sequence of two or three hits that presumably involved the primary special move in question.  From that, you could do another standard move.  The game wouldn't let you use another linker at this point, but you could use an ender.  This is another special move that, again, would be some other sequence of hits that would ideally hit the opponent back.  Now, only some particular moves could serve as openers, and specific standard moves would have to follow.  Only some were enders.  One particular move was the linker.  The standard moves that could follow each of these were specific to the attack.  If you did anything else, the combo would generally end.  (There were plenty of exceptions, though.)  Some of these worked as long as you were in a combo, but sometimes the game would think you're in a combo but you wouldn't really be.  One great example was the missed ender -- the game would think you're in a combo so it would let you do the ender, but the opponent would actually be in the correct condition to receive the hit and the ender would miss.  The other explanations about combos in this thread worked in Killer Instinct too -- one of them was with Glacius, who had a move where you rammed your shoulder into your opponent.  Before the combo had a chance to cancel, you could duck down and leg sweep the opponent into the ground.  Before that combo had a chance to cancel, you could do an ender, specifically the one that shoots four projectiles, but instead of it being weak like the ender usually is, the four would hit individually while the opponent was down (which you couldn't normally do) and cause massive damage.  Fun times.  By the way, if you were being hit by a combo, you could use a C-C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER, which was just a particular special move.  You had to do it at the right time and at the right strength (according to some rock-paper-scissors jiggery-pokery, though you could usually turn on Easy Combo Breakers and not worry about the rock-paper-scissors).  This could happen even in the middle of a multi-hit move like a scissor kick!  Anyway, this is a game where combos were actually programmed in and had specific mechanics in place.  Other games use different systems!"
truegaming,3bar9g,smaug400,3,Sat Jun 27 18:57:24 2015 UTC,"Just to add on to what CrabFlab said: Mortal Kombat is an odd character. I love it, but it can't decide what it wants to be.  For the most part, the series uses dial-a-combo, meaning there are preset combos that you have to press all the buttons as fast as you can. It doesn't matter if the previous attack in the combo has hit your opponent yet (waiting for that to happen is called hit confirming), you have to finish pressing every button in the combo for it to register the whole thing. However, when combining different preset combos, more often than not you have to hit confirm one of your attacks before adding the next combo in. Even then, there are some characters that break the dial-a-combo rule to a small degree. Take Mileena in MKX: she has one or two preset combos that start out as dial-a-combos yet require a hit confirm before putting in the last buttons.  Not very confusing once you play around with the characters, but it takes some getting used to after playing a certain way with most everyone else"
truegaming,3bar9g,Tavish_Degroot,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:33:58 2015 UTC,Is that why I can never pull off that 8 button press Kung Lao or Erron Black combo? I have to wait a second?
truegaming,3bar9g,LemonRaven,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:30:16 2015 UTC,"You could try it, though with mileena it's only a split second. There's one where she stabs the opponent with her sai, and then you can enhance it (not with the meter, i think it just says enhance under the combo in the list or something). You have to press the next buttons the exact moment you see/hear the sai go in. A split second too soon or too late and you only get the regular version.  I haven't actually played around with Kung Lao or Erron Black much yet. Just enough to get through the klassic tower so I can't say for sure. Could be the problem though. It could also be that you have negative edge turned on. It's great for that one ermac fatality, but otherwise it just gets in the way."

truegaming,3bar9g,Squiggly_P,2,Sun Jun 28 04:51:01 2015 UTC,I submit Heihachi's dumb ten hit combos as my nomination for most satisfying combo. Imagine playing against someone and you bust one of those out.

The most satisfying thing was learning the 20-30 hit combos into the Ultra's (which is basically a free 20+ hits on your combo as a finisher), or doing the infinite juggle with Cinder to try to win that stupid ""Who can get the highest combo"" contest.  But as an 11-12 year old who JUST started getting into the arcade stuff, it was super cool to be able to do the longer combo stuff.   Orchid has another good one, where you could do her flip/roundhouse kick into 3 hits a few times in a row too."
truegaming,3bar9g,Incursus,2,Sat Jun 27 17:42:32 2015 UTC,I dont know anything about traditional fighting games but since you mentioned you like smash you should definitely watch these:  http://youtu.be/vXgpGBbh5r8  http://youtu.be/mYgopUL8kk8
truegaming,3bar9g,TheBigBruce,2,Sat Jun 27 18:10:09 2015 UTC,"Since everyone already explained combos, I thought I'd just give out what was the most useful tip for learning them for me.  Clean inputs.  Basically, when you're trying to learn a combo you want to make sure you are only pushing the buttons you need for the combo, and only once. If a combo ends in a Medium Kick, you don't want to mash Medium Kick at the end because even if it comes out you won't have learned the proper timing for the combo.  In addition to this, frame data let's you see how you messed up assuming your inputs are clean.  If you time your links wrong one of two things will happen. 1) you pressed the button late and the opponent blocks your attack. 2) You pressed the button early and the attack doesn't come out at all because you're still in the recovery period of the previous attack.  Using that information you can actually visibly see where your combo is going wrong and adjust to fix it."
truegaming,3bar9g,EnixDark,2,Sat Jun 27 19:46:33 2015 UTC,"Most of the technical questions have been answered, so I'll just chime in with my 2cents about the actual games.  Satisfying combos: definitely JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (the old one). The actual combos don't vary much, but the way you have to work with things like walk cancels and very strict timings makes it so different in executing even a basic BnB compared to most other games I've played.  edit: just realized that video is Tool assisted, its still worth checking out :)  A close second would be the Guilty Gear series, because every character, in both gameplay and combos, feels like its own game, even though combo videos might look like its just air juggles for every char haha  Third place would probably be Fate/unlimited codes. It's the only 3D fighter (even though it plays more like a 2D) where I really enjoyed the game in every aspect, and it has some of the most intense combos I've seen.  joke mention: Hokuto no Ken.  As for comparing the length and 'difficulty' of button presses, well... the actual presses and stick movements aren't that hard after you get used to them and 99% of all games use the same inputs anyway, so its mostly the input buffer that defines how hard the input is.   But King of Fighters is definitely one of the harder series regarding that, some combos have absolutely ridiculous timings, because many of its older games have an almost non existent buffer, which makes even basic things like cancelling a poke into a special on reaction really really hard."
truegaming,3bar9g,TheBigBruce,2,Sun Jun 28 03:11:10 2015 UTC,"Since you mentioned ""satisfying,"" I thought I'd mention the Fist of the North Star fighting game, known for having ridiculosuly long combos.  https://youtu.be/0HXHAt-82rU"
truegaming,3bar9g,Incursus,2,Sun Jun 28 04:25:12 2015 UTC,"A few people have mentioned Guilty Gear already, but it's an interesting case when it comes to combos. The system they used in the first game (and probably the others, I can't remember cause I mostly played the first one on the PSX) was to have two 'fast' attacks (punch / kick) and then a medium and strong attack (slash / heavy slash) and you could automatically do combos with them. But in most cases the same rules for more complex combos was the same as the basic combos. A weak attack can be immediately followed up with any stronger attack according to button push.  Punch, slash, heavy slash = always a valid combo. Some moves allowed you to double up, so you could do two slashes before the heavy slash, or you could do two punches or two kicks before moving up. I think there was always some move that would allow you to reset the combo, and you could air-juggle in that game, so you could do a combo on the ground that sent the opponent into the air, then start a new combo in mid-air...  And you didn't really have to put a shitload of effort into trying to memorize all the different combos or anything. It's been a while since I played it, but I remember being able to pull off some pretty decent combos by just screwing around. I'm not the sort of person who tends to be very good at fighting games, either, but Guilty Gear's system allowed me to look like a bad-ass because it's combo system was based on such a simple and understandable set of rules. Once you get the basic idea down you can really just make up your own combos. You could focus on your timing and strategy more and it just felt like a much better system than anything I'd played before."
truegaming,3bar9g,LemonRaven,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:31:52 2015 UTC,"I've only played BlazBlue which was made by the same company as GG but they still used that system in BB. They called it the revolver because it made a circle around your buttons. Square Triangle Circle X. They had light, medium, heavy and drive. Drive attacks were basically your characters unique feature. I played Hazama so X was his chain that he could use to pull himself to distant enemies. If I recall Hazama didn't really utilize it in his bread and butters because they relied on a lot of special moves."
truegaming,3bar9g,bluesatin,2,Sun Jun 28 13:49:29 2015 UTC,"marvel vs capcom 2 and vampire savior both have what they call ""magic series"" combos - basically, punch buttons cancel into kick buttons, and weak buttons cancel into stronger buttons. so a full magic series combo would go jab, short, strong, forward, fierce, roundhouse. this isn't true for every character, but for many.  in nearly every 2d fighter, buttons ""cancel"" into specials (quarter circle and dragon punch motions + a button). you cancel by inputting the command in the middle of the animation - i.e. you might press a punch button, then immediately input a dragon punch (forward, down, down + forward) while your character is still punching. the end result? you just did a combo.  furthermore, you can often cancel specials into supers (moves that cost super meter).  in addition, animations will usually cancel when you land from a jump.  so a basic combo might go like this - jumping fierce, when you land, strong, immediately do a quarter-circle forward + kick, then immediately input two quarter-circle forwards + punch.  now, jumping in is a fairly risky proposition - one of the basic risk-reward dynamics of fighting games.  in more abstract terms, combos usually go as follows: button -> special -> super  there are also link combos - the explanation requires some understanding of the technical background of fighters - moves have startup frames, and recovery frames. frames are the basic unit of time in fighting games - everything happens in increments of 1/60th of a second. so a strong punch might have three frames of startup, leave the opponent stunned for ten frames, and have five frames of recovery. a forward kick might have three frames of startup. if you take the strong punch, subtract the recovery frames from the stun frames, you have five frames. subtract the three frames of startup on the forward kick, you have two frames to link strong punch to forward kick - in other words, a two-frame link, i.e. A 2/60th seconds window to hit both buttons.  the street fighter iv series honestly has quite difficult combos - there are many one-frame link combos, which require quite a bit of practice to pull off, and which are dropped by even professional players, which is one of the most divisive features of a divisive game.  in general, doing special moves just involves getting comfortable with your controller. that said, some controllers are considered better than others - analogue sticks are pretty uncommon, and most people dislike them. d-pads are preferred by some players - evo was won on a ps1 controller. the best d-pad controllers are probably the sega saturn controller, any playstation controller, or certain specialized third-party pads. the 360 probably has the worst. there are arcade sticks - look for sanwa brand parts like in the madcatz te sticks, and a newer concept - the hitbox, which is a controller that uses ONLY buttons.  if you can't execute, try a different controller. what do you use now?"
truegaming,3bar9g,CheshireSwift,2,Sun Jun 28 08:33:44 2015 UTC,"I just wanna add, it's important that you know the basics.  You can master the longest combo which ends with an instant death super but it won't do you any good if you can't land a hit.  I had a hard time with combos as well.  When I got serious with Street Fighter 4, I had a really hard time linking moves for combos, so I practiced the basics.  My favorite characters were Blanka, E. Honda and Dhalsim and I did pretty good in arcades and some tournaments with them, without relying on combos.  Defense and good zoning got me far.  I did hit my plateau though, and that was against other Blanka/Honda/Dhalsim players who did use combos.  That was when I started learning combos but by then, I had a good foundation since I already knew the basics."

On a really serious fight, you don't do anything too fancy, just functional, cause most combos can be broken and you're fucked. Low punch is actually the most powerfull hit with all players :D it's the sleazy interupter.  Mortal Kombat is a lot faster, combos are shorter, usually wont be broken, but not easy to commence, because the players are reacting and moving like crazy."
truegaming,3bar9g,hobdodgeries,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:08:57 2015 UTC,"From a high level programming standpoint for the combos, I would assume that a queue data structure is used (first in, first out) to keep track of the most recent button presses with a timestamp that is generated and recorded by each each button press event. From there, the combos would be evaluated off of both of those values and executed when the button pattern and timing requirements are met.   Anyone who has actually programmed a fighting game please correct me if I'm wrong here.   EDIT: Thanks for the replies clarifying how it really works. Really interesting stuff."

I was surprised that my more local servers here were slower than another one in another country.    GOG is a good competitor. Unfortunately Steam usually beats them out on prices, depending on what you're getting.  But you also get so much WITH it, too. But there's not a lot of security whether CD Projekt woiuld continue to do as well as it's doing (heck, while Valve is more secure, it isn't as secure).  It's WONDERFUL that there stuff is all DRM Free, and they try to add as much extras as they can for the experience.  Leafing through PDFs of old manuals is really cool to me, takes me back.  I'm not as old as your mother, I promise.  Origin is strange. I just have no game that presses me enough to go there. I still have yet to finish Mass Effect 3.  I love the series.  I actually like the game.  Yes I spoiled myself on the ending, but I keep forgetting I even have it.  That's how bad it is.  Added to that - every once in awhile I log into reddit to find someone angry with EA over some new game that I didn't even know came out. Why? I don't open origin.  I don't get that ad pop-up you talk about.  I never heard of said game.  It's so strange because I would look forward to some of these before.  I just no longer care, sight unseen.  You know what I look forward to?  All these indie games by indie devs I like. That are promotiing themselves constantly on twitter and Steam tends to remind me exist.  I've turned off any store autostart when I get on my system - just find it annoying. Just have them together on the taskbar below."

truegaming,3bakqc,IndridCipher,2,Mon Jun 29 01:28:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a license is less permanent than owning a physical copy (which - of course - deteriorates over time as well).  In that a license can be take n away at any time.  But I'm okay with that. Convenience trumps it for me - specifically Steamplay, Steamworks, cloud storage of most everything, etc.    So yes, it's a trade off. I am trading my permanent right to a thing to a less secure license to a thing.  But I'm okay with it.  Edit: BTW, I'm happier now that Steam has a refund system, but I'd love to see if they can make a workable used game system. So many games I completed I'll never open again - some I genuinely enjoyed."

I mean I don't have a lot of console games so I keep them organized, but some old PC Games I'll never see again.  That said, I don't have something of value that I can resell.  I technically could resell my account (I'm in the EU), but I have no desire to sell the entirity of my library.  I'm feeling a bit of that now as I have a massive library of things that I don't own enough to sell off if I needed it (at the moment I could use some extra cash, and there's games I never play).  That was the tradeoff I made by going to Steam and other like services (UPlay, Origin)."

truegaming,3bakqc,fhqvvhgads,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:37:17 2015 UTC,"Used games disappeared from pcs long before steam. All sales final was across multiple stores by this time, and publishers stopped supporting it   I know EA still supported used sales until at least 2002 (I know the EULA from C&C Renegade has instructions for how to resell your copy), and Steam launched in 2003. I suspect EA and others supported used sales for quite a long time after Steam launched, but I'll have to go check some old EULAs to be sure.  Edit: I had some time so I checked out of curiosity. EA still had the provision allowing resale in boxed copies of Sims 3 (2009). So, at least some of the huge publishers allowed resale well past when Steam showed up."
truegaming,3bakqc,NotWrongJustAnAsshol,3,Sat Jun 27 23:51:10 2015 UTC,"I'm talking more about retailers than publishers directly. To return a game to a retailer, the retailer would then have to work that out with the publisher, and it got harder and harder for the small retailer to do so.  Hence, all sales final.  I buy a game at Babbages for $50, I can't send it to Sierra On-Line to get my money back."
truegaming,3bakqc,jmarquiso,2,Sun Jun 28 02:34:45 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point, but I think that's a separate point from the OP.

The other major factor is that piracy has always been common on PC, so you've got the situations of  ""why buy a used copy when I can just copy it from a friend or download it?"" and for shops shops where someone could buy a game, copy and then trade it back in for another, etc."
truegaming,3bakqc,plank_,18,Sun Jun 28 08:04:27 2015 UTC,Especially with the multiplayer keys the one drawback to pirating was no multiplayer for the games which was often the same with buying used. This weighs even more against getting used games on PC.

There was never really a large used game market as far as I know, as piracy was always a more viable option for people who wanted to play PC games cheaply.  So as more DRM along with sales became the norm, there was no clamor for losing a used game market that never existed."
truegaming,3bakqc,tadcalabash,5,Sun Jun 28 05:36:24 2015 UTC,"PCs had one time use codes you tied to an account before steam got established, so for a lot of multiplayer games that would nullify trading.   I don't remember many games having these, but it's definitely possible I'm just remembering wrong. Do you know some titles offhand?  I remember a ton of multiplayer titles using CD keys, but CD keys don't stop used sales. You just stop using the CD key, and the new owner starts using the CD key, and there's no problem. I traded a few games with my friends using this method way back when.  The only big titles I remember having any kind of registration / activation came out after Steam. For example, I remember people being pissed about Spore's activation scheme, but that didn't happen until 2008 (and Steam launched in 2003). I also remember there being some anger about BioShock's activation, but that was 2007."
truegaming,3bakqc,NotWrongJustAnAsshol,7,Mon Jun 29 23:07:38 2015 UTC,Just about every major PC game I bought between 98 and 04 had one. The Sims for example was a big one. Quake was sort of another.
truegaming,3bakqc,Slukaj,4,Sat Jun 27 20:40:12 2015 UTC,"You're right that Quake 3 had a CD key, but it didn't stop used sales. If you wanted to sell it used, you just stopped using the CD key, gave the game to the new owner, and he started using the key. I even bought a copy of Team Arena on eBay years ago (used), and it worked fine. There was no kind of registration or anything associated with the key. You just typed it in and, as long as nobody else was using it at the exact same time you were, it worked. The only time that was a problem was if the seller was being a jerk (kept using the key after he sold it) or the key had been posted online (in which case it would most likely get blacklisted after several thousand people all tried to use it at the same time).  The Sims worked used as well. Even Sims 3 (the boxed copy) has a provision allowing resales in the EULA (I don't generally memorize EULAs, but that just came up in another discussion so I went and looked at it).  I think you must be confusing CD keys and activation / registration. Many, many games had CD keys. That's absolutely true. But, CD keys do not stop used sales. They just stop multiple people from using the same key at the same time."
truegaming,3bakqc,NotWrongJustAnAsshol,6,Sat Jun 27 20:57:58 2015 UTC,"Yes the problem was that it was on the honor system, and people weren't honorable. You could easily keep the game installed and keep using the key and just use a no CD crack or make a copy of the disk. Lots of people did this, which killed used sales at retail. Ebay still worked of course for selling used games."
truegaming,3bakqc,kodt,2,Sat Jun 27 21:25:34 2015 UTC,"I believe with online shooters (Half-Life+mods & Quake for example) still allowed more than one person to play the game at the same time, but they wouldn't allow them to play on the same server at the same time. Seeing how the only people you'd likely be sharing CD Keys with were going to be family/friends, and they likely wanted to play with you, it was all the incentive for them to buy a new copy for themselves."
truegaming,3bakqc,Frankie__Spankie,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:37:11 2015 UTC,"Half-Life certainly did not, I remember letting people use my key at LANs and then often not being able to play online."
truegaming,3bakqc,kodt,3,Sun Jun 28 01:21:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah but that assumes you actually stop using the key when you sell it or trade it in. Lots of people would copy the game & key, and then sell it back, making the key unusable. Places like Electronics Boutique stopped selling used PC games because too many people were buying games with used keys and getting refunds. Once that happens they can't sell it and lost money."
truegaming,3bakqc,kodt,2,Sat Jun 27 21:52:57 2015 UTC,"You just stop using the CD key, and the new owner starts using the CD key, and there's no problem.   But the buyer had no guarantee that the seller would stop using the key like they said."
truegaming,3bakqc,ZeMoose,2,Sun Jun 28 01:10:54 2015 UTC,"That's true, but to me that's sort of just how the used market works. There also was no guarantee that the disc wouldn't be scratched to hell and unreadable. Even now, similar problems exist in gaming. If you buy a used Xbox or Playstation, you might find that you aren't allowed to play online because that particular console has a blocked ID. But, that doesn't stop a used market from existing."

Whoever had the CD key was allowed to play, whether they were the original owner or not. All the EA titles I owned worked the same way. I do remember that Spore had activation (but that was after Steam), as did Bioshock (but that was, again, after Steam).  I don't remember making an account to play a game until Steam showed up. The original Half-Life, for example, also just had a key. Once Steam came out, Valve moved it over to Steam and started requiring accounts. Before then, though, it was just a key like Q3A."
truegaming,3bakqc,NotWrongJustAnAsshol,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:02:04 2015 UTC,"Not to mention even today's games, if bought on disc, already have, or will have a crack out there to not need the disc. And game devs are okay with those simply because they have one time use codes.  But without those codes, one person could just give away his game after using it and the key would be usable everywhere. Huge loss of income for the devs."
truegaming,3bakqc,Bear_Taco,-3,Sun Jun 28 00:22:58 2015 UTC,"Stopping people from copying games can also be accomplished by DRM like SafeDisc or SecuROM that require the original disc be inserted in the drive. They are defeatable, but so is Steam DRM. You need not have one-time use codes to stop people from easily copying a game.  And if there's an online component, the disc can come with a unique code that is not one-time use but can only be used by one person at a time. Thus the code could be sold along with the disc to another person."

truegaming,3bakqc,sockpuppettherapy,6,Sat Jun 27 14:18:24 2015 UTC,"It's been tried, and it repeatedly fails.  PC gaming piracy was a huge issue, especially by the early 2000's.  There is a legitimate argument in that piracy doesn't equate to the loss of a sale necessarily, but you had a large culture that frankly encouraged piracy, even with the availability of demos and the like.  Steam, especially towards the mid-2000's, changed much of this.  And much of it had to do with some legitimate concessions in the face of DRM.  You don't ""own"" the game on Steam, but you're able to download the game on any machine that you log in.  You see larger discounts on games that make the purchasing of them more effective.  And Steam really emphasized the community aspect of online games on a more central place.  So it's not so much an iron fist as it is creating a sort of gated community.  To give an idea of the sale aspect, buying a game that's been out for a few months on Steam usually results in at least a 25% sale in the first couple of months at some point.  You hardly see that level of sale for a used game, even years after a game has been released in many cases.  There's a give and take."
truegaming,3bakqc,internet_observer,2,Sat Jun 27 17:04:51 2015 UTC,You have no way of verifying that the person didn't write down the code and continue to use it after selling you the game. Especially when most used game sales go through a store as an intermediary.   SecureROM and SafeDisk were jokingly easy to bypass as they generally only required a replacement executable. Many people would crack their own games that they owned for convenience. Cracks were regularly updated to support new versions of the game and generally supported both multiplayer and single player (assuming you have a valid key).

truegaming,3bakqc,Fantonald,37,Sat Jun 27 23:18:53 2015 UTC,"I think mostly because it happened so gradually. Many years passed from the first time a game was released that couldn't be resold, until the market reached the point where the majority of games couldn't be resold. (It's also worth mentioning that we have not yet reached (and perhaps never will reach) the point where no games can be resold.)  Because it happened so gradually we never got the single big outcry that Microsoft managed to create with their disastrous Xbox One announcement. Instead we got a thousand tiny outcries, from the fanbases of specific franchises or publishers, when we learned that their newest game couldn't be resold.  Specifically I remember the outcry over at /r/civ when we learned that Civ5 would be a Steam exclusive, and the outcry over at /r/paradoxplaza when we learned all their future games would be Steam exclusives, and the outcry when EA made some of their games exclusive to Origin (though there was interestingly enough a bigger outcry when they pulled some of their games from Steam, a competing platform for non-resellable games).  Others have mentioned price, which also helps. Who cares if you can't resell a game you bought at 75% off? Even if you could resell it, no-one would pay more than a fraction of the full price, because they know they can get it brand new at a fraction of the price if they just wait a few more weeks.  One more reason is that many gamers have a deep love for the biggest ""bad guy"", Steam. We love it for the wonderful sales, for the convenience, for the social features, etc. It's made gaming cheaper and easier than ever, and so we forgive it for also making it a bit more restrictive (those of us that even noticed).  But most of all because it happened gradually over more than a decade."
truegaming,3bakqc,digitaldeadstar,15,Sat Jun 27 23:56:50 2015 UTC,"It mostly happened before everyone had the internet and spent a great deal of time on it, to be honest.  PC games have had limited-use activiation codes for a long time now."
truegaming,3bakqc,Toysoldier34,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:24:40 2015 UTC,"I think this is a huge factor.  Now if something is announced, there is instant feedback to companies.  Whether it be through Twitter, Facebook, forums, or whatever else.  Years ago you could snail mail the company (if you could find their address), or mail a magazine's ""Letters to the editor"" section, or maybe call customer support and yell at some poor intern.  That's after you found out about the choice a month or two it went into effect because you had to rely on an article in a magazine.  There are other factors, too.  But I really think the lack of feedback was a huge one.  Perhaps also because when it comes to PC gaming, there's no one individual PC maker like with consoles."
truegaming,3bakqc,vertice,7,Sat Jun 27 12:03:18 2015 UTC,"When I haven't paid more than $45 preordering $60 games on PC for over 5 years now along with the sale prices I buy games for later on I don't mind the lack of used games market.  There are sales on other platforms, but they don't compare to sales for PC games. Not having a used market allows the new game market to get away with it.  Having all of your games on a hard drive without the need to change discs is also a big factor. If you compared now to when the first news about no used games on the  Xbox One was announced the number of people that would be outraged would be a fraction of what it was. Beyond the hive mindless side of it far more people are exposed to having most of their game digitally.  I own 1 PS4 game on disc I bought with the system to keep one in it then the rest digital and have been mainly gaming with Steam for many years now. Though even with the PS3 most of my key games I have on disc beyond digital only or free/heavily discounted games on PSN. There is just a different mentality between the PS3 and PS4 generations that is now here. As mentioned despite being well accustomed to this being a PC gamer it was still two separate things between my buying habits of PC vs PS3.   The announcement from Microsoft came too soon when people weren't ready, but it would go over much easier now than before. How smooth it would go over is hard to say, but it would be in a much better place for sure."
truegaming,3bakqc,OurEyesArentReal,4,Sat Jun 27 11:45:09 2015 UTC,"i just find ps4 disc based games to be cheaper and more practical due to their immense size and download time in digital.  if i had a terrabyte drive in the ps4, and i didn't have to dick around with their proprietary stuff when managing game data, sure.

The sales on Steam, HumbleBundle, GoG, and BundleStars frequently match the used prices, and I don't have to worry about keeping up with physical media.    Yes, there is the ominous specter of losing all my games when Steam eventually dies, but hopefully at that point the industry will have figured out a healthier DRM model. And, frankly, I've lost tons of games over the years because physical media is beholden to physical damage and wear-and-tear. Almost none of my NES or SNES games work reliably anymore. I've lost about 6 games to DRM after Microsoft deleted my XBL account during some kind of purge."

If I buy a crate of guns from an arms dealer and they turn out to be replicas I have no legal recourse.

When asked why a legal option is better than an illegal option, the answer ""because it is legal"" is not adequate.    Having more options is always good. It let the consumer choose the way he wants to buy a game: digital, physical, new, used. It's even better if it's legal because the consumer will have nothing to worry about.   Imagine a hypothetical scenario where, if everybody stopped buying and selling used games, the price of games went down in such a way that the average cost to the consumer was lower.   In a way, it's good because prices will have significantly lower. But it's also less good because it means the used games market no longer exists, and thus, the consumer 1) has less choice and 2) has less rights (the right to give or sell his stuff).   What I'm trying to illustrate is that you have to demonstrate that the used game market existing creates the lowest possible cost for the consumer   Buying used is always cheaper than buying new, and buying digital is sometimes cheaper than buying used (because not all developers would sell their games for 5$). So it very often has the lower possible cost; most used games are either cheaper than digital games, or the same price, but for the same price you have more (box + booklet + disc).   while still keeping the product viable for your argument to work.    The product can still be viable with a big used games market. For used games to exist, someone needs to buy them new. Realistically, there is no way a game is going to sell just enough copies so that everyone who wants the game can buy it (new or used), and at the same time lose money because of used sales.  If there aren't many used copies of your games, it's because no one bought it new in the first place, and thus it's not the fault of people who buy old games.

Consumers have never gotten the benefits from this market, because it's always been really small-bit time due to piracy.   This goes all the way back to the 80's. People had large game libraries pirating Amiga, C64, and Tandy1000 games. The used games market in the 80's, 90's and 2000's was a reflection of that pirating.  The used price was usually too much when you knew down the line you could get it for practically nothing.   Maybe if PC games sold more, it could work, but even today a good selling game is 1-4 million copies.  A number of PC games do sell more than 1-4 million, but they are the exception in the industry-I know you can point to 3-4 a day year, but really they are the exception where the studios that survived were living off 1 million sales."

To be honest, I have enough games in my Steam library at this point that, if digitally trading or selling ""used"" titles were possible, I would probably never have to spend another cent on games (or at least not for the next 5-6 years). Which sounds great, but in the end I think it'll lead to developers trying to get my money in some other way. We're already seeing that with the current state of affairs by way of paid DLC, microtransactions and subscription fees. If you think a litany of lost sales due to license trading/sharing isn't going to drive more studios down that road, you're fooling yourself.  I'd rather keep the gaming industry profitable while paying a modest fee upfront for my games. There was a time in my life where I just wanted everything free or as cheap as possible, but at some point you have to come to grips with the fact that there's a fine line between being pro-consumer and advocating for a market so slanted in favor of the consumer that it's no longer worth the good faith effort required to put out a good product."

See i-tunes and the music stores for the exact same effect.  As for why no parity with consoles, I think anyone paying attention understands that consoles are and have been an evolutionary dead end for along time.  Every generation pushes harder and harder for more features blurring the lines between pc and console.  Now MS says when you say xbox you are saying win10 in the future.  There is no console of the future only some form pc hardware.  The 'console' will be just another name for set top mini-pcs.

Basically ease of accesibility and competition. If you buy straight from Steam you don't usually get as good prices.  For specific examples, Greenmangaming tends to do tons of discounts.

From the perspective of the developer there is no difference between someone buying a used copy or pirating a game (either way they get no money). Yet I think most reasonable people would implicitly agree that there is a distinction.  I think it highlights the essential differences between actual property and 'intellectual property'. Actual property is a natural fact, things exist and someone can have them, while intellectual property is a legal fiction - we agree to pretend that one person can not copy a thing that someone else has because we recognise that it's overall better for society to maintain that fiction than not to. The argument goes that it is better because if we maintain the fiction then successful creators can support themselves and so have the time and resources to create further things, and others will be motivated to also become creators, thus we all benefit from having more creations to enrich our lives.  If we allow the re-sale of used digital goods then we're treating them as physical property rather than intellectual property, because we're going against the very purpose of the fiction of intellectual property (that a creator should be compensated when people consume their creation). If we ban re-selling used digital goods then we're treating them as intellectual property entirely instead of physical - which strikes many people as an unacceptable removal of their rights.  It's a valid position to support the concept of intellectual property and to therefor believe that a creator should be compensation whenever someone consumes their creation (though there's certainly lots of variance in any limitations on this). It's a valid position to believe that we should not engage in fictions like intellectual property and should rather let natural law rule (as we are all, within the limits of our capabilities, capable of copying things we see in the world around us).  Both supporting the concept of intellectual property while also wanting to be able to buy and sell used digital goods seems to me from a logical perspective to be a dissonant belief."

The only game I've purchased since then that I would want to resell, rather than keeping for my purchase price (which is anywhere from $2.5-$120) is probably SWTOR which was a fucking MMORPG.

As of this writing, I only own three or four digital PC games. It's rather frustrating to remember my log in password. I find it more frustrating to remain online while playing a game which does not have any online functionality. Finally, I figure that any service which hosts PC games could get hacked, and all of its content would be lost for days.  Small publishers such as JAST Densetsu and Mangagamer sell a decent amount of their PC software as DRM-free physical discs. I've purchased a couple of their PC game discs in the recent past, and installed them on at least one of my computers. I would consider selling these CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs someday."

For a very long time PC games came with an activation code, that simply affirmed if the copy was legit, there was no online activation or steam accounts or anything else. I bought a game, played it it through, sold it to a friend who then installed it, etc etc. Then slowly came in the option to buy games digitally, to tie them to your steam account and all that. It wasn't forced on anyone, even now a lot of games can still be bought used assuming you get the physical copy. Some people still do this, a lot of people really dislike digital distribution and all that, and choose to buy physical copies.  Steam and other digital distribution services simply grew in popularity because people chose to use them, and they did this knowing that they'd lose the ability to buy/sell used games. So it was mostly a choice, however even now there are still a lot of people who dislike the fact that you have to install a digital distribution service for some games.  When you compare the xBone situation to this; on 360 you could buy/sell used games everyone knew this and everyone accepted it. Then M$ comes out and says ""No you can't do that anymore"", it's not a choice. People didn't voluntarily choose to buy a version that they can't resell, the choice was forced upon them.  So people lashed out, as they always do when they feel they've been deprived of their ability to choose.  They same way people originally lashed out at Valve when you had to install Steam for Valve games, the same way that they lashed against Origin and countless other things.  See most people are totally willing to give up the entire used game market, assuming you let them choose so themselves and provide an alternative venue for cheaper games. This is exactly what PC games did. They let people choose between digital distribution and used games, people chose digital."

truegaming,3bakqc,DeeJayDelicious,2,Sat Jun 27 15:08:36 2015 UTC,"The reason this is a bad idea is the same reason it is a bad idea for physical discs, used games sells means that the developer is not getting money for a sold game, which in turn means they will have to charge more for new games to offset the loss in sales. Without a used game market games get to be cheaper AND the developers get to have more money, which in turn means they get to make more games in the future. Implementing used games sales would destroy any notion steam/gog discounts."
truegaming,3bakqc,DaHolk,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:02:22 2015 UTC,"Of course you could, but no one will do it.   Digital goods lose no value in their lifetime, a used digital copy of GTA 5 is exactky the same as a new digital copy, there's zero difference. With physical games you at least have the box, manuals, disc, etc that can suffer wear and tear and you also have to walk all the way to gamestop to buy/sell them.  Now when you sell a used game, you get the profits from it, not the publishers or devs. Eve nif a percentage fee like the one in Steam marketplace would be enforced, you could still sell a 60$ title for 30-40$ of which the publishers/devs then get some percentage cut while you pocket the rest.  So why would you pay 40-60$ for a game, when you can get the exact same title with the exact same features for 20-40$? This also give less profits for the devs and publishers since they'll be getting an even smaller share after the seller has gotten their share.  The current used games market is even worse. Stores like Gamestop are pocketing everything from the used games market. Since these stores also aggressively push used games to any and all potential customers, studios are in fact losing sales and profits due to used games. It would be the same situation with digital copies.  So even though you could have used titles in a digital marketplace, no one will do it since it effectively cuts their own profits."

So we can give our kids our DRM-free copies of software we bought for like $5, fulfilling a lot of the needs people had that were met by pre-owned games. Honestly, by the time that becomes an issue it's unknown whether our kids will even need us to give them these DRM-free copies, because they may be using subscription services that just give them a lot of this old stuff as part of the package.  Now, the lack of physical ownership that accompanies the purchase is still a problem that hasn't been solved, but I think that's less a PC issue and more an issue with the inevitable march of technology, as I think it's not unreasonable to say that consoles will eventually be mostly digital, as well. There is an outcry against that, it's just across all platforms."

truegaming,3bakqc,BlackDeath3,4,Sun Jun 28 04:28:45 2015 UTC,"I never owned a console, but for pc games its quite complicated to play games you bought 10/20 years ago. I mean, I didn't bother to install a DVD unit, let alone a floppy drive. So, playing a game that old is too much trouble, I rather 'pirate' the game.  So I guess the same goes for Steam, maybe one day Steam will go out of bussiness and I'll be locked out of my games. Maybe they'll 'unlock' some of the drm before going. But in any case, you can pirate the game.  In my mind, I pay steam for ease of access and convenience; not for access to the game. I already had free access to the games I bought via thepiratebay. But Steam allows me to download, erase, redownload.  About the used market, I think piracy and steam quite explains it. On pc you can usually buy a game at full retail price on lunch, you can wait a little bit and get a small discount, you can wait some more and get a juicy discount or you can pirate the game, all these options makes the demand for an used game market smaller than on consoles."
truegaming,3bakqc,hTyUK,3,Sun Jun 28 19:00:56 2015 UTC,"Most of the time, 'trading' or selling PC games is a breach of copyright by its very nature.  Games often had a code you needed to enter to install, but could be easily bipassed with a cracked executable (actually, this was still fairly common up until steam became the standard for PC distributions).  You were never allowed to return software, including games, to the retail store for a refund, only an exchange would be processed for example, if the disk was defective or there was documentation missing from the package.  So I don't really see how there would be any outcry, it was never a thing that people did without knowing that it wasn't allowed, we all understood why the game 'required' having the disc in the drive, or why we needed to use a valid CD key on install, and that duplicate keys might be unable to use multiplayer features.    I actually see it as being more possible to trade games through steam, as they're harder to crack for a casual person, and constant updates means that you need to re-crack them whenever there's an update, or be content playing an older version with no multiplayer (fine for single player games, most of the time though).  With steam, publishers can be relatively secure in the knowledge that a game that's been disabled from someone's steam account will be unavailable to them, and the person it's traded to can simply download it.  That isn't the case in reality, obviously, because no one like Valve wants to produce a whole set of technical capabilities like this only to not be able to make any money off of it and let people play games they didnt' pay for, but that's not really the point.  The point is that trading or reselling PC games has never been totally legal, even for game that had no DRM built in, while you were technically able to install it on an infinite number of machines with no downside, it was still illegal to do so."
truegaming,3bakqc,akaBigWurm,2,Mon Jun 29 20:51:12 2015 UTC,"Because online distribution came with a number of conveniences too and wasn't just about taking something away. That makes a big difference.  And with piracy easy and common in the early 2000s, I never got the impression the used PC games market was ever a big deal. At least not where and when I grew up. If you wanted a game for cheap in my day and age, you pirated it."
truegaming,3bakqc,ArtKorvalay,2,Sat Jun 27 12:43:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly? Because there was always the option to pirate. ""Oh, you mean I can't get 2 of your games used for half the prize of one new one anymore? You know what? I'll just buy every second game. six of one and half a dozen of the other"".  Also the idea that the used game market for consoles turned into a giant extraction model for companies like game-stop.  In the end both piracy and used games boil down to something similar. Because even if we assume 0 extraction with used games, in the end y people have experienced the content, and only x people paid the asking price. with X being lower than y.  In both cases content creators need to create significantly more products for the same amount of profit.   All platforms and games go on sale, and having a used game market helps balance the purchase price since the game can later be sold to recoup some of the cost.   Which is interesting, because the market without used games still has a significantly lower median asking price."

Physical goods are (relatively) scarce.  What happens to sales of your digital product when your market has hit a sort of ""critical mass"" of indefinitely-transferable licenses?

I don't buy games often anymore, so if I'm buying a game I'm nearly 100% sure I'll be at least satisfied with it, if not impressed.    As far as transferring games goes -- I only wish.

You go into an EB Games now and see almost no PC games, except for maybe some Blizzard games, and it's easy to assume that Steam is a big reason for that. But in the course of a few years, it's amazing how hard it became to buy PC games.  I went from being able to pick up Baldur's Gate in Costco to not being able to find PC games anywhere except for the local dedicated game store that jacked the prices up by $15. If I wanted a PC game, I usually simply didn't get it. By the time Steam came along, though my computer was a bit less impressive by then, I was quite happy to have a place where I could buy PC games.

On the plot, we are responsible for the last surviving members of a species. We are leading refugees across the galaxy. Do you remember in BSG when Laura Roslyn has the number on the board? It's kinda like that. And the fact that literally everything save the Bentusi want you dead drives this point home: Every life, every ship matters.

One of them is an enemy capital ship I captured in the revenge mission.  If you have any love of RTS, or of Battlestar Galactica, you owe it to yourself to play Homeworld. It's highly regarded for a good reason."

Homeworld was one of the few RTS I ever tried to play, being categorically awful at the genre in general. I only managed a few missions before the complexity of it outstripped my ability (and patience) and I had to give it up, but it built an attachment to my fleet and the story of my people as a whole in a really excellent way. I might try to get back into it and see if the intervening five years have made me a little smarter."

As such, I didn't play the game again for probably a year and rocked it (no pun intended) the second time."

truegaming,3b8dm9,kaerim,3,Mon Jun 29 19:52:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this. It brought back a lot of fond memories of what I consider one of my all-time favorite games. A story of the desperate plight of exiles fighting against all odds in a do-or-die voyage to reclaim their homeworld after thousands of years in exile. The soundtrack, with the haunting choral arrangement of Adagio for Strings that plays upon returning from the first mothership hyperspace jump test, combined with the imagery you are greeted with on your return and realizing the full implications of what transpired, is to this day one of the most unforgettable scenes I've ever experienced in gaming.  Back then, on successive play-throughs, I performed what is now considered the preferred strategy during the Bridge of Sighs mission, where you could increase your fleet well beyond maximum capacity by using a large enough group of salvage corvettes to steal as many ion frigates as possible from that massive orb formation guarding the mission objective. Amassing that fleet, and then using all of those stolen frigates in the remaining missions was overkill from a gameplay perspective (you became nigh-invincible, so it felt almost like cheating), but from an emotional and storytelling perspective, it felt like righteous vengeance for the Kushan against their mortal enemies, the Taiidan.  I got the collector's edition of the HD remaster that was released earlier this year specifically so I could have the scale model of the Pride of Hiigara (from Homeworld 2) sitting on my desk. And to think the original Homeworld is now 16 years old! A classic, if there ever was one. I love it."

Plug or insert a game and you'll be playing. You don't need to worry about the hassles of installation, patches, or hardware incompatibility found in PCs.   However in the recent decade, consoles are now more and more like PCs. Want to play a new game you just bought? Turn on the system and wait until it boots into the console ""OS."" Insert the disk and wait while it installs.... then wait until it downloads the patches and updates the game. Gone are the days of rushing home after getting a new game and immediately playing it. Many of the annoyances of PCs are now experienced by console gamers.  On the other hand, PC gaming is slowly getting more and more streamlined. With Steam's Big Picture, it's easier to have a couch-based gaming computer. In addition, newer PCs are embracing smaller and smaller form sizes that rival console sizes while still maintaining graphical and computational power.  Eventually, there will be a convergence when PC gaming becomes as simple as the then current console gaming."

That's basically just misinformation dude. Really? When is it ever that complicated to run a game on PC? You download it, and you play it. It's that simple.

truegaming,3b75ky,1336plus1,6,Fri Jun 26 21:39:33 2015 UTC,"Yes it's not strictly needed, most of the time.  But you're underplaying just how important the drivers are.  http://www.gamedev.net/topic/666419-what-are-your-opinions-on-dx12vulkanmantle/#entry5215019   The first lesson is: Nearly every game ships broken. We're talking major AAA titles from vendors who are everyday names in the industry. In some cases, we're talking about blatant violations of API rules - one D3D9 game never even called BeginFrame/EndFrame. Some are mistakes or oversights - one shipped bad shaders that heavily impacted performance on NV drivers. These things were day to day occurrences that went into a bug tracker. Then somebody would go in, find out what the game screwed up, and patch the driver to deal with it. There are lots of optional patches already in the driver that are simply toggled on or off as per-game settings, and then hacks that are more specific to games - up to and including total replacement of the shipping shaders with custom versions by the driver team. Ever wondered why nearly every major game release is accompanied by a matching driver release from AMD and/or NVIDIA? There you go.   You will nearly always see an improvement by installing the drivers when you buy a brand new big game. And if nVidia or AMD were slow to fix it, then you could be running at very poor settings for a week or more."

For Nvidia cards you might not have to. But for AMD GPU driver updates you absolutely has to reboot your PC.   As for the settings, you just turn things down if you're not reaching 60FPS. No need to ""look up graphics settings online"".   Again, with GTA V. It requires reboot of the game when you change certain settings. And it gets time consuming.  Those are facts.

The GPU driver update for GTA improved my FPS from about 30 to 50 on the same setting.   Yeah it helps, I did the same thing for GTA + Witcher 3, but it's not usually that big an fps jump and is only for brand new AAA releases.  I will agree with you on tweaking settings though, that is my biggest time sink. If you don't really care about graphics though you can usually get away with whatever the recommended/default settings are.]  Edit: another comment here reminded me about this AMD tool that chooses the optimal settings for you. If I'm having any trouble with settings I use this to get me something reasonable and then tweak from there. Nvidea have an equivalent solution too."

truegaming,3b75ky,JanJansen2634,3,Sat Jun 27 01:00:47 2015 UTC,AMD really should update their normal driver more often. As is it's literally months before they update their standard driver. Their last standard driver doesn't have support for Witcher or GTA I don't think.

truegaming,3b75ky,playingwithfire,2,Fri Jun 26 18:00:54 2015 UTC,"That's probably a very safe bet for the next generation. It might even be true for several more console generations. Mass market practices have a lot of inertia. Many consumers are resistant to change, and the console giants will have a lot of money to funnel into the console market for a while yet.  Still, converging hardware means that barriers to developing games as cross-platform are shrinking. Exclusives are rarer now than the used to be, and the console makers are needing to throw more money at developers/publishers (or fund their games entirely) to convince them to forego the profits they'd get on other platforms. It's getting to the point where it's too expensive to do that, and that's where the compromise of timed exclusives comes from. We may be seeing more of that soon, but eventually, it will also fade away.    Below are some bonus stats on exclusives (no timed exclusives or console exclusives). Notice the decrease in both overall exclusives and portion of exclusives produced by third parties.  PS4 exclusives per year: about 15 (~75% produced by Sony Computer Entertainment) PS3 exclusives per year: about 25 (~60% produced by Sony Computer/Online Entertainment) PS2 exclusives per year: about 50 (~50% produced by Sony Computer Entertainment)  Xbox One exclusives per year: about 5 (~90% produced by Microsoft Studios) Xbox 360 exclusives per year: about 25 (~40% produced by Microsoft [Game] Studios) Xbox exclusives per year: about 25 (~30% produced by Microsoft Game Studios)"

Sure PCs are getting better. but so are consoles. and yes consoles will always be behind PC in terms of tech. but what people fail to realize is that as long as 90% of AAA games can be played by a console then its never going away. and as long as there is money in the console market thats always going to be the case.  just look at the arkham knight fiasco. the reason why PC got fucked there is because the devs didn't put alot of effort into the PC version. you wanna know why? because theres more money on console. and yes you can argue with me all you want but its true. if it wasn't they would have focused on PC more.  so tldr version: consoles will always exist as long as theres money to be made in it. and theres TONS of money still being milked in the console market. much more than PC.

I find it very easy, some times when I get nice indys I do not even have time to start an other game before the download is done.  And I do not even have to go to the store, that save some real time."
truegaming,3b75ky,Soun,13,Fri Jun 26 15:59:41 2015 UTC,Digital distribution benefits both consoles and PCs but the impact on PCs was extraordinary because of the sales and bundles. Digital PC games are not regulated by the console manufacturers and there is no pressure from physical retailers to keep digital prices equivalent to the physical prices.
truegaming,3b75ky,PrionBacon,4,Fri Jun 26 16:05:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe just a fluke, but it seems on some systems that downloads won't run while another game is open, essentially bricking your console during a long download.  PS4 was supposed to address this head-on with background download/update/installs and remote activation of downloads."
truegaming,3b75ky,deviantbono,5,Fri Jun 26 17:07:40 2015 UTC,"I do not own a console I use Steam where you check a box if you want background downloads or not, works well for every one I know."

truegaming,3b75ky,rookie-mistake,4,Fri Jun 26 19:30:30 2015 UTC,Consoles are still much simpler. You don't need to worry about your hardware. You just know this particular game will work on your console. But if you're on a pc you can't be sure if you're not savvy enough. You have to know your hardware specifications which a lot of casual users don't care about.

truegaming,3b75ky,C0lMustard,9,Fri Jun 26 18:16:53 2015 UTC,Supposedly the Steam Controller will be able to due to its double touchpads.  First wave of them is coming out in October.
truegaming,3b75ky,PrionBacon,2,Fri Jun 26 18:28:26 2015 UTC,"Ive been watching it and hopefully it's as advertised.  Im skeptical because a trackpad doesn't work great on RTS even at a desk.  But on the other hand there's a good chance they have figured it out, so I'm still hopeful."
truegaming,3b75ky,C0lMustard,2,Fri Jun 26 19:42:20 2015 UTC,"As long as PC specs have lots of variation across an open-market, the two will never truly converge. However, you are probably right in that consoles will continue to be more like PCs (especially as many games go over 25GB).   Consoles will continue to be mass-produced as casual 'prebuilt' PCs with a console specific OS. The hardware for consoles will probably continue to be lower(in general) than PC, since companies want to profit and only have to compete with consoles rather than the thousands of companies making different pre-built PCs."
truegaming,3b75ky,NaarbSmokin,3,Sat Jun 27 03:10:03 2015 UTC,They're not at all similar. Grandma can hit a to download patch. Consoles are the price you pay for convince and also the safe bet for the future. They're good enough. That's ultimately it. If you're willing to pay a tiny bit more for the games you care about and don't want the has all consoles are a easy choice.

truegaming,3b75ky,kickingpplisfun,2,Sat Jun 27 04:21:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's fair to mention steam at all yet. Steam is not a player in the home entertainment model at all yet. They've got at least a generation, probably two before they even become a thing.  The problem steam is going to find is that people are going to buy games that don't actually work with their ""system"". Quotes because it's just a PC running a home theatre interface. I just don't see them breaking the niche for both markets. People who jump on board are too knowing to sidle themselves to prebuilt hardware and those that don't know will be pissed when their shit starts not being able to keep up with modern purchases 2 years down he road."
truegaming,3b75ky,Tramd,39,Sat Jun 27 06:34:50 2015 UTC,"It will not go away. It might evolve and change. I think that Microsoft is trying to evolve the concept of a console with their Xbox One being a cable and streaming service. I think that consoles in the future will be a media device for the home, serving many different types of entertainment, not just disc games. So in that respect, yes the console will die, but it will be replaced with something that functions the same and does so much more.  Console gaming and PC gaming are different experiences, and I think that there are great things about both of them.  Console gaming to me is a room that is built around enjoying the experience. You need:  A large TV A couch, or a bed A good sound system A simple control system that does not require you to sit at a desk.  The console style to me is defined by comfort and room immersion.  The PC experience to me are defined by these points:  A very good desk. A comfortable chair that has good back support. A good keyboard and mouse. A high quality monitor, but still smaller than a TV.  PC gaming to me is defined not by comfort, but by directing you to altering your environment in order to get precise and more complex information - both incoming and outgoing. Higher resolution monitors can relay more information. Higher precision inputs can provide more complex methods of control. However, in order to get this, you sacrifice the comfort and ease of console gaming.  Personally, I feel there's a time and place for both of these, and I don't see why one or the other has to disappear."
truegaming,3b75ky,Leviathan_25,2,Fri Jun 26 15:34:19 2015 UTC,Steam link's goal is to make your giant PC work in the same room as your TV by steaming it.

truegaming,3b75ky,CaptnAwesomeGuy,3,Sat Jun 27 06:04:35 2015 UTC,"I game exclusively on a PC because they are so much more versatile than consoles for things other than gaming.   Also, a PC has many, many more games available for it than any console."
truegaming,3b75ky,IAmFern,3,Fri Jun 26 19:53:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but it doesn't seem like you're representing the PC side correctly.  I'm using a keyboard on my lap while sitting on the couch right now. I use my arm rest for the mouse (Ikea couches are awesome for this). I also have controllers for when I don't want to use the kb/m, or for games better suited for controllers. Using a kb/m can be just as comfortable, and easy as using a controller.   Honestly, at this point the only advantage that consoles have, is party/group games. If the PC could get games as good as the Wii U coop games, then it's all over.  There's not any special/extra setup needed. I use an HDMI cable, and tweaked the resolution to look good on the screen. The same thing you do for consoles.   The console vs PC experience isn't about hardware, it's not even about inputs, or cost. It's about software, and local co-op mostly.  Solve that, and they'll become the exact same thing. It's already happening. You said it yourself. While consoles are adding in benefits of PCs, the PCs are adding in benefits from consoles. So naturally they're going to be the same eventually."
truegaming,3b75ky,Daemonicus,3,Sat Jun 27 06:58:51 2015 UTC,"Anyone mildly comfortable with a PC can get it to work in a ""comfortable"" setting. Consoles just don't require the extra few minutes of hassle."
truegaming,3b75ky,Z-Ninja,10,Fri Jun 26 19:14:01 2015 UTC,"No way. Despite the popular opinion of most people online; consoles are still fairly popular. This gen is selling like hot cakes. People will always look for the more simple routes when wanting to play games. A lot of parents aren't going to help their 7 year old build a PC. Alot of teenagers don't want to build a PC. They just want to play games with friends. A lot of older people don't want to deal with PC's. Hell sometimes I even have to take a break from my PC because I get enjoyably obsessed with the tinkering and stop enjoying the games.   Consoles may not be ""plug and play"" because of the route games have taken, but consoles in some way will always exist for the people that don't want to game on PC. PC gaming is awesome, and I love it but it isn't hard for me to understand why some people just don't want to get into it and that's fine.   So yes I think they will still exist. I think we will see shorter 5 year life cycles to keep up with hardware and with that will come backwards compatibility since they are using simpler infrastructure."
truegaming,3b75ky,Streetfoldsfive,12,Sat Jun 27 02:42:10 2015 UTC,"Unless Steam OS or similar solution provide easy on the couch experience I believe consoles will be around. Keep in mind of all the demographic that buys console to play 1 game (or 1 series of games, like FIFA).  Steam OS, due to being Linux, still doesn't support a fair amount of AAA titles and the UI from a couch isn't optimized for a good amount of PC games. Now the Steam controller might change that. And I'm sure Valve will improve the couch experience in the near future. Whether it will improve enough and be affordable enough, we will see.  Current gen of consoles are a bit underpowered. That doesn't mean we don't need consoles. That means we need better consoles IMO.  4K, 144Hz, 3D, VR are important to enthusiasts that owns $200+ GPUs, but probably not average joes. Some of which are perfectly happy playing FUT on their downtime on their console."
truegaming,3b75ky,playingwithfire,4,Fri Jun 26 15:17:34 2015 UTC,"As long as there are people like me that just want to insert a game and not have to worry about preformamce issues then consiles will always be around. I get the games pretty much right away and to be quite frank, i am not a genius when it comes to cpus. So installing patches and fiddling with directories is not something i enjoy. Too many moving parts for me."
truegaming,3b75ky,mideon2000,17,Sat Jun 27 01:40:05 2015 UTC,Consoles are going to be around for a while just for the general simplicity of plug and play. It is one of the reasons apple sells iphones and tablets so well.  Perhaps in a few generations when we start getting more people who have grown up with technology we might see a decline in consoles and a rise in PC.  But this is of course all speculation.
truegaming,3b75ky,Applzor,0,Fri Jun 26 15:16:50 2015 UTC,"I think the steam machine or steam box or whatever it's called is going to change a little bit of the way we look at consoles.  As it is, neither the xboxone or the ps4 actually use the disk to play the game, really. It's a key to unlock the download, and you still have to store the game on your hard drive. Which will be how the steam thingy works, just with no actual disks.   People are going to get very used to having a fully digital collection of games..... just like we got used to digital collections of music."
truegaming,3b75ky,CrystalElyse,3,Fri Jun 26 15:48:56 2015 UTC,"I feel like Microsoft might continue the trend of Windows 8 and 10.  They streamlined their OS to work on both tablets and PCs, and I think in the future they will probably try and sell/incorporate a gaming OS and curator tool (a la XBox Arcade).  I'm intrigued to see how they navigate Steam, UPlay, and Origin. If they can mesh together a Microsoft Games marketplace ranging from tablet games on up to AAA things could get interesting."
truegaming,3b75ky,jahcruncher,2,Fri Jun 26 16:20:38 2015 UTC,"As it is, neither the xboxone or the ps4 actually use the disk to play the game, really. It's a key to unlock the download, and you still have to store the game on your hard drive   So those of us stuck on dial up should stay far away?"
truegaming,3b75ky,thenichi,2,Sat Jun 27 05:41:53 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, yes. I don't really think any of the consoles would work well with dial up, unless you want to spend all day installing the game."
truegaming,3b75ky,CrystalElyse,2,Sat Jun 27 13:57:27 2015 UTC,"I don't remember about the One, but the Ps4 at least does use the disc. It doesn't ""unlock a download"", it just takes the contents of the disc and installs it to your hard drive. It still uses the disc and doesn't require the internet at any point. No clue what he's talking about."
truegaming,3b75ky,TheGasMask4,4,Sun Jun 28 01:51:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. There are still a few areas where consoles have an edge on the PC market. The first is standardized hardware. The ability to play the same game on your PS4, your friend's PS4, or your seconds cousin's PS4 is a hidden selling point. The fact of the matter is, there are plenty of PC gamers who suffer with low-end specs for far longer than they should, either because they are ignorant of how to upgrade, they don't want to spend the time or effort doing it, or they just don't have the means to get the parts they need. A new next gen console is an easy sell - all bundled together nicely in time for the holiday season, with a catchy name and recognizable brand name. It's easier to ask for a PS4 than it is to ask for a Radeon R9 290x and 16 gigs of DDR4.  The second is that consoles are super user friendly, and they haven't evolved much since the days of the cartridge in that regard. With a PC, you not only have to be familiar with the operating system, but you also need to be skilled enough to debug problems you encounter when something inevitable goes wrong - and that leads me into my last point. Ease of development. Developing games on traditional consoles is easier and quicker than on PC platforms. You only have to design for one set of hardware, one controller input type, etc. As long as developers can keep pushing out games that sell on consoles, they'll keep making them until they don't turn a profit anymore."
truegaming,3b75ky,AntiTheory,50,Sat Jun 27 04:43:13 2015 UTC,"No.  No matter what the PC gamer says, There are still people out there that want to just have a simple experience that allows them to pop in a game and just play. While PC gaming has gotten better in terms of installing the game and playing, it isn't the same.  I don't want to have to buy a new PC costing me $800+ every few years just to play the latest and greatest games on decent settings.  I know that the $400 system I bought 2 years ago will still run and play the newest games that came out last week and I won't have to tweak the settings in any way to start playing."
truegaming,3b75ky,americangame,59,Fri Jun 26 15:15:23 2015 UTC,"Why do people think you have to upgrade every two years? PC's don't degrade over time. If you want to keep ""ultra"" settings, yes, you'll have to upgrade, but that's because ""ultra"" is a moving target. What was ""ultra"" 3 years ago is now ""medium"". Unlike consoles, graphics on PC are constantly evolving. A PC will play games at the same level of graphical fidelity until it breaks."
truegaming,3b75ky,Natemiester,37,Fri Jun 26 15:22:52 2015 UTC,"There's some truth to the argument, although the need for $800 every 2 years is a fallacy.  A PC gamer will need to mess around with new games to optimize them on their PC, while a console player is always plug-and-play no matter where in the life of the console they are.    There is always a risk for PC players that their PC has hardware that the developers just didn't consider, or didn't bother optimizing for, especially after a few years when they focus on the newer hardware.  This is true for cross-platform games as well as PC exclusives."
truegaming,3b75ky,Kerhole,5,Fri Jun 26 15:37:41 2015 UTC,"There is that risk of the need for tweaking. It comes part and parcel with customizability. However, consoles haven't been ""plug and play"" for a while. They have been adding in online updates, patches, and other time-wasters that used to be the sole domain of pc."
truegaming,3b75ky,Natemiester,18,Fri Jun 26 15:42:03 2015 UTC,"But that's all done for the user on the user's behalf, time consuming or not.  This is a huge criticism I have on PC users, who seem to believe everyone else has the time, desire, and ability to learn how to tweak and customize their systems.  They go so far as to give people shit and call them lazy or stupid for not wanting to."
truegaming,3b75ky,Kerhole,7,Fri Jun 26 17:04:33 2015 UTC,"Some PC gamers do. I do not. I respect someone who takes the time to learn how their system works, and how to make it run better, but I don't begrudge someone not wanting to do it. And, for the vast majority of my games, I simply hit download, then play them. Most autodetect my settings, and adjust, but if they don't, I might take a minute or two to look them over. It's not as complicated as you are making it sound."
truegaming,3b75ky,Natemiester,2,Fri Jun 26 17:27:43 2015 UTC,"Having been a console person for ever and ever, it really wasn't until the PS3/360 generation that I started wanting to be able to mess with graphics settings because games started coming out for consoles that ran like garbage.  Honestly, from NES til PS2, I'm not sure I even knew about frame rates. Most games let me ignore the thought. But I remember playing Dragon Age, Skyrim, and a bunch of other games last generation that ran poorly enough  that it snapped me out of my feeling that the whole thing was plug and play."
truegaming,3b75ky,OccupyGravelpit,3,Fri Jun 26 17:29:30 2015 UTC,There is no graphic settings. Which is a big part of tweaking. You can just do something else while the game update. Changing GPU settings while monitoring FPS in Afterburner takes a lot of time. I don't know about the NVidia side now but setting detection with AMD is still God awful. I sometimes get all Medium settings and run a game at 90 fps when I only have a 60 fps monitor.
truegaming,3b75ky,playingwithfire,4,Fri Jun 26 15:44:39 2015 UTC,Fps and refresh rate aren't the same thing.
truegaming,3b75ky,the_fascist,10,Fri Jun 26 20:57:14 2015 UTC,"5 years ago I dropped ~£1200 on a PC that will now struggle to run many modern titles. Sure, that 5870 may still be on par with an Xbox One, and that i5 750 may still be better than what's in the consoles, but that doesn't mean it can run games anywhere near as well.  Add to that the fact that the RAM broke (twice, the second time I just upgraded to 8GB as OCZ had stopped making RAM by then), the PSU broke (just within warranty, but still took a month from initial contact to getting a replacement), and PC gaming is not the cheap alternative to consoles that some would have you believe.  I'm certainly not about to recommend PC gaming to anyone who doesn't need a really good PC for other reasons."
truegaming,3b75ky,blackmist,12,Fri Jun 26 15:40:49 2015 UTC,"PC Gaming, or at least the hardware part, is DEFINITELY not cheaper.  Individual games are cheaper, with the caviat that you need to have control and not end up like a lot of us who bought a lot of games and never play most of them because they were on sale.  Most PC games that are bought also can't be sold or traded in. Back when I had a 360 I can buy a new game for $60, beat it, and then sell it on craigslist for $40-50. So the cost of playing a single player game was $10-20 for me. I paid about $44 for Dragon Age Inquisition when it released. Played through it (and it has more than earned that amount with the amount of content) and no it's just sitting in my library. That's a $44 cost of game."
truegaming,3b75ky,playingwithfire,9,Fri Jun 26 15:48:19 2015 UTC,"People that claim it's cheaper tend to use workarounds to get there. Even if you include the cost of Live into an Xbox One, can you really build a gaming PC for $600 that will last you 5 years without upgrades? And do that without salvaging parts? At best, it'd still require price shopping and taking advantage of sales, promos and rebates. And in the end, it's still not a plug and play device.   I appreciate the benefits of a PC, but it's apples to oranges in many respects. Some people just can't look outside their own personal bubble."
truegaming,3b75ky,ithinkineedanap,2,Fri Jun 26 19:42:53 2015 UTC,I also find it weird that a person who bought a system that can last 5 years would accept that a high-end system in 2010 would be middling to low-end in 2015.
truegaming,3b75ky,dagamer34,3,Sat Jun 27 02:23:55 2015 UTC,"Now, my experience has been rather different. I dropped $800 on a pc, with a now 3 year old card, the GTX 660, which is still kicking ass. I'm still using my 3 year old RAM, and have never had issues with my PSU."
truegaming,3b75ky,Natemiester,2,Fri Jun 26 15:46:46 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, I'm going to wait it out a bit.  For now my PS4 produces playable results. A 970 may do the same thing at 60Hz, but that's not enough for me to bother upgrading.  The next big thing is 4K. It's a luxury option now, but will soon be the ""normal"" resolution, the way that 1080p was before it. At the minute, there isn't a card out that will push 4K on all games. I'm interested to see if higher bandwidth VRAM will push it over that consistently. I'm suspecting that 4GB VRAM isn't enough to future proof to the end of this generation anyway. There were people swearing blind that 2GB would be fine, and consoles were outdated before they even launched.  Plus we've yet to see what effect DirectX 12/Vulkan will have.  And if this week's Batman debacle is anything to go by, PC gaming still has a way to go. Sure, it wasn't optimised for PC, but this wasn't the first title to have issues and it won't be the last. Until developers take it seriously, I won't either. Time is far more precious to me than money (even if I can't resist the Steam sales), so I'll take a ""just works"" over a ""probably works""."
truegaming,3b75ky,blackmist,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:15:56 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about ""there isn't a single card that can push 4k for all games""?  I have a 980 ti and I can play Witcher 3 and GTAV on ultra at 30 FPS.  Did you mean ultra at 60 FPS?"
truegaming,3b75ky,KuztomX,2,Fri Jun 26 17:39:02 2015 UTC,Yes.
truegaming,3b75ky,blackmist,3,Fri Jun 26 20:02:20 2015 UTC,"If you'd bought a 360 or PS3 back then, you'd have paid near retail for every game   That you can resell.  How do you sell a steam game that I'm done playing?"
truegaming,3b75ky,playingwithfire,6,Fri Jun 26 20:57:54 2015 UTC,"Sure you don't need to drop $800 every 2 years (probably about $150-200 every 2-3 years, maybe $50-100 for a new set of RAM on a 3-4 year interval. First gen i5/i7 are still more or less okay today). That's probably way too much even if you want to play on Ultra at 1080. But PC graphics doesn't scale linearly. Once you go below medium sometimes it's a hard fall. And you absolutely have to upgrade your GPU if you want to keep playing at a good setting. At least once every 3 years or so at minimum. Maybe 2. How many people still run newer demanding games on high/ultra with a 670? That's a $400 card 3 years ago."
truegaming,3b75ky,playingwithfire,13,Fri Jun 26 16:25:05 2015 UTC,"I can run Witcher 3 with a mix of low, medium, and high (only terrain and foliage set to low & hairworks is off) on a normal 660 (not TI) + an overclocked i5-2500k. That's a $200 card (I got it for $180 during a sale) 3 years ago. If I bought a 970 today it would probably last me this entire console generation at the least.  I'm far from being a PC elitist, but when comparing prices you need to consider the fact that you only need to compare prices for performance that's equivalent to consoles, not what lets you set everything to ultra at 60fps 1080p.  Granted, you'll still generally need to have slightly better hardware than consoles, because devs are able to optimize better for specific hardware, especially towards the end of a console generation."
truegaming,3b75ky,bohemica,4,Fri Jun 26 15:29:53 2015 UTC,"You touched on the point I was going to say. At best, a PC gamer needs only to spend about $200-$400 every 3-5 years to stay current IF you want to set everything to ultra.   For comparable performance to consoles, you don't need to spend that kind of money in that interval of time if you're computer was already doing Ultra 2-3 years ago. Readjust the settings and you're good to go."
truegaming,3b75ky,Feurbach_sock,3,Fri Jun 26 15:47:01 2015 UTC,You don't run games on high on a 670. That's the point. What was high is now medium. Although I should point out that my 660 handles Shadow of Mordor on high/medium just fine.
truegaming,3b75ky,Natemiester,6,Fri Jun 26 16:00:29 2015 UTC,"It also depends how long this gen of console last. It doesn't look like it will last as long as the last gen. But most agree that this gen of console is a bit underpowered. If next gen of console isn't and last 8 years + like 360/PS3 then it will be well justified. I don't know what GPU is out 5 years ago. But I assume it can't play modern games on medium.  Also Shadow of Mordor isn't particularly demanding. I run on ultra at 70+ FPS no problem back when I had my card on stock setting. How does it handle Witcher 3, or Dragon Age Inquisition, or Battlefield 4? Or if you really want a workout try Arma 3."
truegaming,3b75ky,playingwithfire,3,Fri Jun 26 15:36:55 2015 UTC,"5 years ago was the GTX 580, which is only slightly worse than a 760. So yes, it will run games at medium settings."
truegaming,3b75ky,Natemiester,3,Fri Jun 26 15:41:43 2015 UTC,"I believe Linus Tech Tips took a 4-5 year old card and couldn't UNDERCLOCK it to go as slow as a current gen consoles when using Watch Dogs as a benchmark, which is a terrible PC port.  The argument that people never seem to bring up outside of graphical fidelity is framerate and resolution. PC users upgrade every few years because playing a game at low-medium settings at 900p and 30fps is unacceptable to them. Since console users aren't really offered that luxury, they make do with what they have."
truegaming,3b75ky,Frankie__Spankie,3,Fri Jun 26 15:44:45 2015 UTC,I love Linus but he really likes to play up the pcmr aspect sometimes. And ungenuinely so. Watch Dogs is a very poor benchmark for anything. It straight up doesn't work well on either console or PC. It's like benchmarking with AC Unity right after release.  I understand the argument of 900p at 30fps. But there are other factor besides price/performance (not that PC hardware really win there either. I bet the 4-5 years old card sells for almost as much as a console at the time). It's also a matter of convenience.
truegaming,3b75ky,playingwithfire,4,Fri Jun 26 16:16:16 2015 UTC,You're paying more for a more intensive experience. If you replicated the 720p/medium settings/30fps of a console on a 3-4 year old pc you'd be fine. Why is this acceptable on a console but not a pc?
truegaming,3b75ky,twistacles,2,Fri Jun 26 16:19:15 2015 UTC,"I dunno, my 7970 is still going strong. Bought it in 2013, but it was a year and a half old at that point. It still soundly outperforms the current console generation, so I can expect that it'll be able to run any game the PS4/XB1 can as long as the hardware holds up (a risk with consoles too). It may not manage ultra settings for every game down the road, but it'll still be ahead of the current generation, so I won't need to upgrade if I want to keep up.   And as a 300$ incremental upgrade, it worked out to be cheaper than buying a console since I already had the rest of the PC.

truegaming,3b75ky,azura26,5,Fri Jun 26 15:46:27 2015 UTC,"As people have already pointed out, most console games run the PC equivalent of low res/low graphic setting along with a capped fps. For 500 dollars, you can definitely get a pc that will be able to run new gen games at a lower res/graphic setting and lower fps. It won't be a monster and run games ultra at 60 fps, but it will likely still be better than a console.  On the list of builds he linked, the Nex Gen Crusher is basically that price and it will likely perform better than consoles."

Ever since the PS2 consoles have been becoming more and more like PC's to the point where now they even share the same architecture.     There are still people out there that want to just have a simple experience that allows them to pop in a game and just play.     Hence why Steam is pushing Steam Boxes. They aren't for current PC gamers, they are for casual gamers looking for an easy in to the PC market.     While PC gaming has gotten better in terms of installing the game and playing, it isn't the same.     How is it not the same? Now the new consoles require the disc to install, updates to download, DRM to sign into, etc. The only problems PC runs into in this regard is that some hardware isn't compatible and to be honest, if someone does their research they will almost never run into these problems. Most of those issues stem from people expecting mid range builds not designed for gaming to be able to game effectively which is completely unrealistic.     I don't want to have to buy a new PC costing me $800+ every few years just to play the latest and greatest games on decent settings.     I spent $700 7 years ago. I've spent 100 dollars a year to have a gaming PC. People spend over half that on their ""online"" subscription for consoles. Not only that, but this PC has done all my school work, my game development, my graphic design, my website designs, and everything else that I've done in the past few years that has been productive. It's just a bonus that it plays games well.    You don't know what you're talking about."

If you want to run at 1080p with ultra settings...then yes, you'll need something stronger.   But even then, I've had the same videocard since 2012 and I can still run games on ultra@1440p"
truegaming,3b75ky,twistacles,8,Fri Jun 26 16:29:34 2015 UTC,"But you're still overlooking the product people want within each demographic. It's almost like with cars. You're going on about horsepower and torque, and meanwhile you have people that just want a car that will be reliable, comfortable, get them to work, and has minimal road noise and less expensive maintenance.   If someone prefers a Corolla over a BMW 3-series or whatever, you can't say they're wrong.   Even if you throw in the cost of Live (at $45/year, which is still not an upfront cost), you can't get a PC for an upfront cost of $350 (and subsequently $45/year) that I can just go home, plug in, and play any game I put on it without having to worry about hardware compatibility, settings, drivers, etc. Just a product that will play everything I put into it for the life of the console and will look and play the same as everyone else that has that console.  I game on both console and PC, and while PC is better performing, sometimes I really don't care and just get annoyed by the added hassles.   It's all just apples and oranges, really. But only PC gamers seem to have this weird inferiority complex. If you prefer one, pick that one.   I know PC gamers get annoyed by consoles dictating the market, but when over 80% of a publisher's revenue (like with Take2) comes from console, where do you think they'll focus?"

With console sales being better than ever, I'd genuinely be shocked if that ever happens. There's always going to be people who want a great living room experience, and there will always be great console exclusives to drive sales.

The last generation of ""traditional"" consoles was the PS2 era as far as I'm concerned.  Buy game. Stick it in your console. Play game.   It's still possible with some console games but the problems more commonly associated with PC gaming have arrived on consoles.   Buy the game (you have to buy new or you'll have content locked away). Turn on console. Log into your account. Wait for system update to download. Wait for it to install. Wait for it to reboot. Log into your account. Put the game in. Install the game to HDD. Boot the game. Watch 2 minutes of publisher logos. Download update. Install update. Look at lovely logos again. Enter 20 digit anti-resale code. Enter distributor's exclusive bonus bullocks code.

truegaming,3b75ky,dawnofthemichael,44,Fri Jun 26 15:15:26 2015 UTC,"What a load of overaggerated biased horse shit. You're reaching so hard on these things. You wrote a big paragraph to make it look like there's a huge involved process in playing a console game, but let's break it down and see how much fluff is actually in there.    Buy the game (you have to buy new or you'll have content locked away).   Bullshit. Let's be honest, ""content"" is an overstatement. At most it's one or two unique skins for a character or weapon.    Turn on console.    Yes, this would be advisable. Not sure when this became a specific step. Did we used to not have to turn our consoles on to use them or something?    Log into your account.    Which happens automatically on every console when you turn it on.    Wait for system update to download.    Which happens 3 to 4 times a year, yes.    Wait for it to install.   See above point.    Wait for it to reboot.   This isn't needed for games, and again, for system updates, this happens very, very few times in a year.    Log into your account.    Again, happens automatically when the console turns on.    Put the game in.    Well, no shit. How else is the game going to get into the console? Why is this even a specific step?   Install the game to HDD.    Which with most games, you can start playing at just 15% installed, which it notifies you with. Until disks can safely spin faster than hard disk drives, this is going to be the case.    Boot the game. Watch 2 minutes of publisher logos.    This has been the case for games since the PS1 era. Not sure what games you were playing before that didn't have this.    Download update. Install update.    On the Xbox One, this happens at the same time as the game install and is almost transparent to the user.    Look at lovely logos again.    Yup, just as you've been doing for every game you've ever played from the PS1 all the way to your smartphone games.    Enter 20 digit anti-resale code.    Flatout doesn't happen. The last company to do this has completely gotten rid of it. But don't let facts get in your way.    Spend another tenner on DLC that should have been included in the Base game.   This is subjective. This specific DLC model is almost always associated with multiplayer maps for shooters or extra cars for racing games.   I'm convinced the last time you played a console was back when the Xbox 360 came out in 2005.   All in all this is still a load of absolute horseshit. I come home from work, I start taking off my shoes, I say ""Xbox On"", the Kinect camera recognizes me and signs me in, and I say ""Xbox Play Forza 5"", and before I've even undone my shoelaces, I'm back in the game. That experience still exists.   Even without the Kinect, I press and hold the power button, it wakes up, and I resume a game that was put to sleep. That is easy. That is convenience. It still very much exists."

If it's raining and we're having a bad internet day, it can take as long as 20 for either system.   The xbox you do have to log into your account, but think of it the same as a ""memory card."" That's just where your save data is. Plus, the xboxone has that camera recognition software so it can recognize your face and log you in that way (which is admittedly equal parts cool and creepy).   The wii u has a ""quick start"" menu that comes up on the game pad and can get you to just ""tap your mii, tap the game, now you're playing.""  There's also the difference where AAA titles on my xbox are constantly getting patches and dlc. The game updates like all the damn time. The Wii U games are more polished/finished upon release, so less bugs means less patches. With the exception of Splatoon. The game wasn't fully ready on time, so instead of pushing back the release to August, they released it with some content missing (maps and weapons), and then have weekly free patches with new maps and weapons. What's nice is that the game was still fully functioning with a 10 hour long single player mode and four online maps upon release, so it didn't play broken out of the gate. It just got more content."

It's just annoying when you lived through 20+ years of ""Shove the cartridge in the hole, play the game"" to have the system change on you.   While the wii u games are more polished.... also understand that the wii u has a much more limited set of hardware than other consoles. It's still gorgeous and works well, but it's not built like a beast to house sprawling, expansive open world games with 200 hours of content and stunning visuals. It's made for their first party titles first.... with third party titles being belated after thoughts. This makes it a lot easier to polish the games to perfection when there's less that you need to do to get them to max performance. It's not meant for Skyrim or the Witcher 3, it's meant for Mario and the Legend of Zelda.  Now, don't get me wrong, I adore my Wii U. It's my favorite system in the house right now and the one I use the most (unless you count that I watch netflix via the xboxone). But that's why they have such an easy time.   That and that nintendo isn't afraid to push back releases to make sure things are perfect, instead of taking that sweet pre order money and then just releasing whatever it is they have on release day and finishing it with patches over the next few months, you know?"

When you look at business and markets, you can't judge it by your standards but rather the standards of the average consumers.

But while you'll have people that do their own maintannce (or at least oil changes, brakes, etc) and discuss horsepower and torque and suspension adjustments or comparing the specs of various models, you'll have other people that simply don't care about any of that, and instead want a car that they like aesthetically, that is more within their price range (even if lower spec'd), is comfortable, has less road noise, is an automatic transmission.   I mean on that note, I wonder how many PC-exclusive gamers look down on consoles but drive a car with an automatic. You just paid $1000 extra for something that takes away from the driving experience, in my opinion. (And for the record, I game on console and PC, I really don't care, I want everything and have a One, Wii U, 3DS and PC with 3 monitor set up right now.)  Point is, the benefits a console provides appeal to a wider demographic of people. It's a lower up front cost, it requires less technical expertise and is less intimidating, and it'll just work with any game they put on it for the life of the console. It's just easy, and more appealing if you're not into PC parts or mods or having the best technical experience.   If consoles are a Civic or Corolla and PCs are a BMW 328 or a Suburu WRX STi or something, whatever comparison you want to make, you can't definitively say which one is better, because that Corolla may be more reliable, cheaper to buy, cheaper to repair, sound quieter on the highway and have better mileage with regular unlimited fuel. The STi might be the better car, but it's not the better purchase for everyone."

Online fora tend to be overwhelmingly haunted by PC gamers who can't fathom why anyone would buy a console. They tend to be very vocal and swing the discussion.  Honestly, given the massive drop in sales of desktop towers, the increased sales of small form factor devices, including laptops, it's really the PC gaming rig that should feel threatened. Sales of dedicated PC gaming rigs, as opposed to the multiuse home towers, seems strong, but I envision smaller non-upgradeable devices making up the bulk of the future of PC gaming."

Content in 4k nowadays is not so popular, but screens manufacturers as samsung are getting bigger and higher res tvs.  I can't believe that a machine that cannot run a game in 1080 and 60hz will survive the next 2-3 years."
truegaming,3b75ky,nipple_sucker,14,Fri Jun 26 20:16:29 2015 UTC,"4K is at least a decade away from being mainstream.  TV manufacturers are just pushing right now because they desperately need something for consumers to buy.  Everybody went out and bought new TV's in the 00's as the HD wave swept over the industry.  But, TV's don't break very often, and your average consumer doesn't care enough about technology to upgrade.  Most people are still running 720P TV's, and they're perfectly happy with them.  3D was a flop.  So 4K is the next great hope, but it's going to take a long time for people to upgrade.  Then you have the classic chicken and egg issue, where very little content is getting created and/or broadcast in 4K because it's expensive, and so few people have 4K capability.   But without the content, there's not much driving people towards 4K.  Then, compounding the mess even further, is the fact that everything is moving to a streaming world, and most people don't even have connections that can reliably handle a 4K movie.  One single movie in 4K can easily take up 40GB, and requires a rock solid 15-20Mb connection.  The average US household is barely half of that.  Sooo... long story short, yeah... 4K is not happening any time soon."

truegaming,3b75ky,boomtrick,4,Fri Jun 26 18:22:07 2015 UTC,Yeah this is the real question. It took forever for people to get to 1080p and the difference for 4k is even less noticeable. There's no reason to think it will become a big thing for quite a while.

truegaming,3b75ky,Soun,11,Fri Jun 26 20:23:40 2015 UTC,"That would be a $1000+ console and it would be outdated in 2 years.  4K and VR need todays highend GPUs and a good CPU to run OK, not great just OK. And you will be stuck with that until the next gen.  As a consumer it's much better to get a good PC and keep upgrading you will get the new stuff but not spend more money then you have to. It's better to do a $4-500 upgrade every few years then spend $1000+ in the same time.  I can still use console controllers with out problems and I have a 4K screen now. The 4K screen might have been a little early but I'm betting on Vulcan and Dx12 to get the fps to a steady 60, right now I get 30-55 fps in most games."
truegaming,3b75ky,frohat,3,Fri Jun 26 20:47:38 2015 UTC,"4k is a tall order. Yes, you can play a game rendered at 800p on a 4k tv, but to render it at 4k you're going to need a beefy system. At that point buying a console would just be a waste due to the diminished returns. It would have to be upgraded routinely to keep running at 4k, which you can't do with proprietary hardware. Currently, if a game runs at 1080p with no noticeable frame drops that's a big deal fora  console, so 4k would be financially unfeasible atm. Maybe in 4-5 more years as 4k becomes standard we'll see consoles achieve 1440p if they release new models that are actually on par with a mid range gaming pc.   The problem with the current generation is that MS and Sony made a lot of sacrifices when it came to hardware. The Xbox 360 and PS3 were actually pretty powerful at release. They were the equivalent to a mid-range gaming pc at the time. The PS4 and Xbone were the equivalent to something you could build at their price only slightly weaker. PS4 has a 7870 equivalent gpu in it, which was in its twilight when the PS4 was released, and the Xbone had something similar to a 7790 in it, which was a year old and regarded as a very cheap budget card when it was initially released.   That being said I feel that consoles went in the right direction as ""entertainment devices"" rather than gaming devices. At this point they can't reach a feasible price point solely as gaming devices and still hit the gamer market. Instead they opted to carpet bomb the home entertainment industry by covering games, netflix and all that jazz."

If they did they would do what they plan on doing with the mobile market. Release games that are exclusive to the mobile platform and exclusive to Nintendo hardware separately. Don't release anything crossplatform so that the consumer still sees value in purchasing Nintendo hardware.   I do feel that as time goes on most people who game for the majority of their lives will have a dedicated gaming PC, since they are less restrictive and more cost effective. Not to forget that I can continually play all of my purchases even if I upgrade to a new machine. I'm not keeping an Xbox 360 and PS3 along with my new consoles in my living room just so i can play older physical and digital releases that are not compatible with new hardware. I have at least 30-40 arcade games on my 360, but I'm not going to keep buying 360s for the rest of my life to play these games every time they break. Should I just take the loss and forget about all these purchases?!?. I don't understand the point of starting fresh every console cycle. If I could move my purchases to a new machine I would be almost forced into brand loyalty from the last generation and whoever won last gen would have a very good chance of coming out on top again.  With Steam refunds I feel like most of us are hoping for a market with more culpability for missteps and general douchebaggery by publishers and developers. When putting out a broken game actually hurts your preorder profits we are on the right track. If steam cares enough to keep adding features like this and added a competent customer service team PC gaming may continue to rise and become a dominant platform.   Would I like to see no more consoles and a unified platform? Yes. Will it happen? Probably not. Even as a PS4 owner I would like to see Sony no longer make consoles. Microsoft currently seems like they are trying to understand the PC market again and whatever crossplay or crosspurchase ideas with Windows 10 they have kicking around can only benefit the PC and console crowd."

Will you be able to sell a console that can run 4k/60fps for less than $500 in 5 years?  There are way too many factors at play here.

Iwata is being deliberately obtuse.

They feel great in my hands, every button press is smooth, and other controllers feel clunky and awkward by comparison.  So I'm glad Sony never went the Nintendo route and said ""for our next controller, we have to forget everything we know about controllers and start from scratch"".  Their strategy is more like taking what they already have and making small adjustments to perfect it.  They almost fucked it up, too, with that fucking PS3 boomerang, if anyone remembers that, thank god it was scrapped.  I had a wii, and in addition to the corners of the wiimote digging into my hand, I remember playing the fantastic Super Mario Galaxy, and for that, to spin, you had to give the controller a shake.  I remember thinking of it as just the same as a button except you have to press it harder and you have to move your whole hand instead of a finger, so it was nothing but annoying.

So a gamer buys a playstation 4 to play all the hd rereleases, and a few new ips and otherwise the same sequels to the same ip (in this case not unlike nintendo, to a degree). Since the controller is almost identical, should you not be able to use previous ps3 contollers? But no, you can't even though the controllers are almost identical, I will admit the dualshock 4 feels extremely comfortable though. Maybe a few console games will support vr, like they supported move or xbox kinect but I highly doubt there will be anything groundbreaking and that's my point. What is the point of paying 400$ for a console that does nothing new, out of the box and is already ancient in tech, compared to pc? I know nintendo tends to release systems around the system concept but that is at least a legitimate reason for the product to exist. In my eyes, the ps4 and x1 have no reason to exist because they bring nothing new to the table, they have no backwards compatibility, games are shipped in unplayable states, they still don't output in high quality hd, they force payment to use online services...etc. The marketing teams for sony and microsoft deserve a huge pat on the back for convincing consumers that their consoles are worthwhile, to the point of getting priority of games before pc, resulting in broken ports for THE superior platform. It makes no sense.   The thing I hear against nintendo is the consistent use of their ip, but with their controller and system innovations, they make the gameplay of the games completely novel, with the exception of games like sports spinoffs and nsmbu, which even then had some gamepad exclusive features that were never available in previous versions."

Even madden had the ability to draw routes with the gamepad for receivers which is actually amazing, if ea actually put legitimate effort into making games again, they could make really unique games if they had unique input devices"

truegaming,3b8vv1,pinumbernumber,8,Sat Jun 27 12:50:34 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair there are a lot of games this gen that are sub 1080p on Xbox and Playstation. I do agree with you though, I wish Nintendo would just make a console that was comparable in specs next time around."
truegaming,3b8vv1,KrisKomet,0,Sat Jun 27 15:36:51 2015 UTC,"I hope they don't. Then we'd have nothing unique hitting the market. If I'm going to play something with that uses an x86 architecture, I'll just use my PC instead of a console with ~1/2 the capabilities."
truegaming,3b8vv1,boopaboopa,6,Sat Jun 27 15:38:46 2015 UTC,They will still have their exclusives and one would hope that if Nintendo made a system with similar specs to the Next Gen of consoles then 3rd parties would be more willing to port games.
truegaming,3b8vv1,KrisKomet,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:41:43 2015 UTC,Last time Nintendo made something that was better in terms of specs/on par was the GCN and it sold poorly. I'm not sure if it'd be any different now.
truegaming,3b8vv1,boopaboopa,4,Sat Jun 27 18:02:20 2015 UTC,They did something different (Gamepad) and undercut the competition again this gen and it didn't help either. Maybe Nintendo should try a mixture? Something different with a bit of beefiness behind it.
truegaming,3b8vv1,KrisKomet,2,Sat Jun 27 18:09:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly, people act like the Wii U is weak. In comparison the PS4 and XB1? Sure. But if we're using that logic then Sony and MS should step up their game too because my PC has been about twice as powerful as the PS4 since before it launched.  As it stands, my Wii U has some of the best looking games right now. Sure, MK8 and Smash don't have AA or any of the bells and whistles my PS4 games like Bloodborne and Knack have.. but most of my Wii U games so far are so much more beautiful. Obviously, it's early on in the XB1/PS4's life (both of which I enjoy very much) so this is going to be the case.. but the Wii U has the capacity to make beautiful games.  Should Nintendo try a mixture? Sure, why not. But I quite like the risks they take. Everything from their controllers (GCN controller, Wiimote, gamepad) to how they reinvent their main franchises and/or update them very gracefully (think going from 64 to Sunshine to Galaxy or Ocarina to The Wind Waker to Skyward Sword or Super Metroid to Prime to Other M).. obviously it doesn't always work (like Other M) but they take a lot more risks than people give them credit for and push their hardware incredibly well.  If they marketed the Wii U like they did the Wii, they may have done much better."
truegaming,3b8vv1,boopaboopa,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:14:43 2015 UTC,Nintendo in general is extremely skilled at using their hardware and chosing the right art direction. But it isn't exactly paying off
truegaming,3b8vv1,Aargard,6,Sat Jun 27 19:22:44 2015 UTC,"And most games on XB1 and PS4 haven't even hit 1080p, either. 720p is still HD. And there are probably just as many Nintendo games at 60fps as there are with XB1 and PS4 right now.  HD is HD. Doesn't matter if it's not super HD."
truegaming,3b8vv1,boopaboopa,5,Sat Jun 27 15:38:03 2015 UTC,"The point is that Nintendo has been a step behind technologically for many generations.   The N64 was innovative but the use of expensive tiny cartridges instead of cheap huge disks meant it was dominated by the PS1. The GameCube had really impressive GPU hardware for the time, but the insistence on tiny-capacity custom disks and a kid-friendly controller with fewer buttons really hurt third-party porting to it. The Wii was SD PAL/NTSC with a motion control gimmick, while the 360 and PS3 were doing the ""720p sorta-HD"" thing. The Wii U is ""720p sorta-HD"" while the competing consoles are either real 1080p or close to it in most games. Also, resolution and framerate aren't the only factors. Actual quality of the image- shader complexity, texture resolution, postpro, AA- are important too. The Wii U can't muster anything close to the PS4.   They all had some fun games but the people wanting to buy one console and play games other than Nintendo first-party IPs have abandoned their consoles."
truegaming,3b8vv1,pinumbernumber,5,Sat Jun 27 15:53:57 2015 UTC,"tiny-capacity custom disks   I will never understand why they did this. The disc reader was the same size as a normal one. The disc came in a box that was the same size as any other game. They could have just used regular DVDs, but no, they needed to purposefully shoot themselves in the foot by using some ridiculously small format that had pretty much no advantage to it - besides the fact that they could make a case for the games that could fit in someone's purse or pocket."
truegaming,3b8vv1,Super_Cyan,2,Sun Jun 28 21:12:02 2015 UTC,"Along with anti-piracy and faster loading, they said they did it (I kid you not), because they thought the big old bad game industry was forcing poor developers to make games too large (in other words, they were still steamed about the ps1 era). The discs were, in Iwata's words, deliberately small so that developers wouldn't feel pressured to make larger games. It's a laughably bad reason and a perfect illustration of Nintendo's luddite attitude toward gaming since the snes era."
truegaming,3b8vv1,snookums,2,Sat Jul 4 06:32:11 2015 UTC,"That's a really stupid design decision, to be honest. It seems like they're always deliberately holding themselves back in terms of hardware."
truegaming,3b8vv1,Super_Cyan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:31:18 2015 UTC,"The point where Nintendo really diverged from the industry is the n64. That was the point when the industry began to change from arcade games for all ages to larger titles with depth of story and graphics for teens and adults. Nintendo was famously condescending toward story in games, calling rpg players sad kids who sat in dark rooms, and their failure to adopt cd-roms lost them Final Fantasy and games like Metal Gear Solid.  Ever since then, they've just doubled down on their belief that video games are toys and not art. Even when they've acknowledged that's what most of the rest of the industry has moved to, it's always with a condescending snarled lip. They're simply too arrogant to let it go and adapt. They keep trying to prove that everyone's wrong for liking games with plot and depth."
truegaming,3b8vv1,snookums,2,Sat Jul 4 15:22:52 2015 UTC,"That's why I've never really been a huge fan of Nintendo. I mean, they do know how to make a few fun games, but they always feel like a little kid in a room full of adults.   ""Oh, you got HD working (only a whole generation late!)? That's nice Nintendo.""  ""Oh, you got 2 screens working on your handheld? That's nice Nintendo.""  Some of their ideas are good. They like to take risks and do interesting things with their hardware, but for the most part, they're just really far behind everyone else for seemingly no reason. The whole motion control thing on the Wii was pretty cool, but they couldn't support HD. The super small discs were cool, but they really limited space for developers for absolutely no good reason. The 3DS is pretty cool, for the games that actually support 3D and the people that actually care about it. The WiiU's tablet thing is pretty cool, but seems a little redundant.   It just seems like they're just messing around with a bunch of ideas to see what sticks. Sometimes, they make something pretty nifty. Other times, they just put themselves out for really no reason."

truegaming,3b8vv1,Reamazing,5,Mon Jun 29 14:49:28 2015 UTC,"The point is that Nintendo has been a step behind technologically for many generations.   The GCN was the most powerful for that gen, wasn't it? And it sold the worst and it's one of Nintendo's worst selling consoles except for the Virtual Boy and Wii U. But that's not what we're talking about. I was stating the Wii U is HD. You're saying ""it's not powerful enough HD"" which is bogus and irrelevant. There's nothing ""sorta"" HD about the Wii U. It's HD.   while the competing consoles are either real 1080p or close to it in most games.    MH3U, Rayman, The Wind Waker, and Smash Bros are all 1080p, natively. So I'm not understanding where you're at with this whole ""Wii U not HD only 720p"" stuff you're pulling out of.. nowhere. And most games on PS4/XB1 aren't 1080p. They're either 720 or 900 (like BF4, I believe? but that's actually 720 on XB1). ""Close to"" shouldn't count if we're talking about this kind of thing. Fact of the matter is, they're all HD consoles regardless whether you like the Wii U or not.   The Wii U can't muster anything close to the PS4.   Well duh. But I still firmly believe Mario Kart 8 is the most beautiful game released last year. It's not all about graphical quality/power, AA, postprocessing, etc. It's also about art direction. Nintendo is basically on top for that.  But to my original point.. the Wii U is in HD. Not ""sorta"" HD, not ""almost"" HD. It's HD."
truegaming,3b8vv1,boopaboopa,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:00:34 2015 UTC,"The GCN was the most powerful for that gen, wasn't it?   No, it was second place after the XBox."

Although the brand cut-off for ""HD"" is 1280x720, there's more to it than that. Ever watched a shitty YIFY pirate re-encode of a movie and noticed how blurry and blocky it is, even though it's technically ""HD""? The frame is, strictly speaking, 1280x720- but it's almost beside the point when it looks so bad anyway.  Similarly, ever played an old PC game at far higher resolutions than intended? You can play Tomb Raider 1 at 4K/2160p if you want, and the edges are certainly very sharp, but the textures are as blurry as ever.  That's why I call the Wii U ""sorta/almost HD"". Some of its games look truly good, running at 1080p with sharp textures (like Smash Bros)- but others (Splatoon) run at 720p with no AA and look pretty awful from an image quality standpoint. Most PS4 games are 1080p and most XB1 are 900p, invariably with postpro AA. The Wii U does indeed output ""high definition"" images, but they aren't in the same league as its competitors."

They are stylized in a way that they will still look good or at least acceptable many years from now due to that art direction.  The entire debate is moot. If you're that interested in the best graphics and so forth, build a gaming PC and ditch your consoles. There's no point in complaining one system is better than another when there's a superior option to both if all you care about is graphics.

truegaming,3b8vv1,snookums,0,Sat Jul 4 06:27:11 2015 UTC,"the newer systems have a hard time running games in 30-60 fps and even at 720p. The majority of people aren't using 4k any time soon and even when the majority does, game developers are just going to make prettier, more detailed looking games at the cost of depth, gameplay and innovative game design. This has already happened with PS3 and xbox360. I don't see many ps4 or X1 games actually innovating enough to warrant a purchase. All the games are marginally better looking but otherwise offer similar game play experiences than the past generation"

I'm not sure how valid it is..I think there are arguments for and against it.   I'm not convinced that HD/4K gaming is best for gaming. I'm not sure how economically sustainable it is in the long run, and I'm not sure that it's going to result in better games overall. Better graphics, in a way, but often art style trumps fidelity IMO...(Honestly MK8 is one of the best looking games out there)  but the fidelity has a cost. Shorter games, more DLC, and so on.

truegaming,3b8vv1,Reamazing,6,Mon Jun 29 14:55:30 2015 UTC,"http://www.vgchartz.com/analysis/platform_totals/  I've left camp Nintendo since the Wii. Eventually gamers will come to the cold hard realization that Nintendo just DGAF about what is wanted and instead will push out things that they want to try. Not everyone will want to play Nintendo Land 24/7. We've played Mario, Metroid and Zelda to death. A lot of us are hardcore gamers who play play deep gameplay driven games like Pillars of Eternity. Or maybe we prefer a game with a mature, dark storyline like Metal Gear Solid. Or perhaps we want competitive online gameplay like Street Fighter 4. Nintendo does not produce these titles, nor do they encourage their allies to come up with this stuff. Yea, Smash is fun, but how often do we have 3 other people over to play? How many of us want to purchase 3 or more controllers?  If they want change, they have to change. They can't rely on the same 3 franchises, plus a bunch of mini-game titles to save their console. They have to look at gamers who want serious games. The Gamecube had a couple of games that really went in that direction: Metroid Prime, Eternal Darkness, Super Smash Bros. Melee, Resident Evil, Killer7, etc. Ever since then, Nintendo has been the place to go to NOT get mature gaming experiences."
truegaming,3b8vv1,AmuseDeath,3,Sat Jun 27 20:30:21 2015 UTC,"Dude, Nintendo games are all about the gameplay. What is your definition of a mature gaming experience? Almost every AAA game that comes out is buggy, online based and non innovative. Splatoon is a great game that takes skill, has a great single player mode, great soundtrack and innovative gameplay. Online in smash, Mario kart and splatoon work fantastically. Maybe you are referring to narrative driven games, which in most cases shouldn't be called video games but instead, interactive movies. I think the problem is older gamers want the industry as whole to be the same. Besides, what gamers want hasn't led to a consumer friendly gaming experience. Look at games like mortal kombat x which is a reskin of injustice and offers very little content. Destiny ""expansions"", the had remasters of Sony.

Nobody says that they want Nintendo to stop making their classic games. What the hardcore gamers want however is mature titles IN ADDITION to Nintendo titles; you can have both.  The whole point of my post is to state why people like myself have lost faith in Nintendo and are part of the numbers that are avoiding buying Nintendo consoles.

I have played plenty of mortal kombat x and it felt identical to injustice in physics, combos, special inputs...etc almost every gameplay aspect was the same. The only street fighter game that didn't reach a Nintendo platform will be street fighter 5 which is exclusive to PC and ps4. The metal gear solid series has almost always been exclusive to the play station brand, except for rereleases which have been made available on Nintendo platforms, excluding 4 and now 5. I don't really agree with the label ""hardcore gamer"" but I've been playing games on all consoles and PC for 20 years. As far as depth of gameplay goes, a ""mature"" title doesn't equal deep or rewarding gameplay just by being ""mature"". Games like xenoblade chronicles, resident evil remake, resident evil 4 resident evil zero, resident evil revelations, the Zelda games, pandoras tower, fatal frame, monster hunter...etc. most of these games are or were exclusive to Nintendo platforms. Yeah, Nintendo may miss out on some stuff like Bethesda games (continuously losing depth with each iteration of their series), ea games ( generally low quality) ubisoft ( ironically they made exclusives for Wii u only to withhold them to port to other systems, without the exclusive features)...I can keep naming AAA third parties but i think this point is made.  It's interesting to see how ""hardcore gamers"" want a mature experience when almost every new AAA game has constant checkpoints, auto aim, waypoints...blahblah all made to make the game easier.   I can agree with the point of Darker storytelling and by extension I would assume that includes much voice acting and cutscenes but in terms of deep gameplay, I have the option to buy the third party games on PC or PS3 and formerly Xbox. It isn't worth it to me as the games tend to be badly made, pretty, recycled games. I don't think the argument of deep gameplay works here when Nintnedo releases games with some of the highest replay value, backed up by the always high price for used copies and steady sales throughout a games life.

If you are a tournament player, you play the game religiously and have at least 500 hours or so clocked in the game. If you play that much, changing something small... such as the frame of one move will be huge.  It's also not just about sequels or particular genres, but the SCENE that a game carries with it. Street Fighter has a HUGE scene globally. You have tournaments happening monthly, people streaming on twitch and giant events such as EVO. Melee was a big game, but you do not get the same sort of scene with other Nintendo titles.  The point isn't that Nintendo doesn't have good titles, but that its hits are enjoyed by its fans. They don't try to make new things and reach the hardcore crowd who like games like Dark Souls, Heavy Rain or The Last of Us.

What is good or bad games is subjective, but it's not about that; it's about numbers. When we look at console ownership, we see that more gamers have purchased PS4s and X1s over the Wii U. Gamers out there are saying that they want titles that are mature and complex. Churning out another Mario Kart, another Mario, another Mario Party isn't going to do this. Those titles will sell, but they won't draw in the hardcore gamers that prefer titles like Bloodborne, Halo, Last of Us, etc.  Nintendo needs to get developers to bring those titles on the Wii U, so that gamers want to buy the console for it. Nintendo has always been good at making easy to play, family games, but there are crowds that want to play games that are more serious and competitive. Metroid Prime was a good first step when it was released on the Gamecube. It was a serious game that was beautiful and original. We need to keep going in that direction."

We can tout numbers and figures but what all of your suggestions towards Nintendo would result in generic bad games. the games Nintendo makes are marketed to everyone. I agree that it would be more convienient if their hardware was more powerful to get third parties but what your saying doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  The Wii outsold all systems in its generation, like the original ds as well. arguably, almost every Nintendo game is a system seller. Their motto is sell hardware through great software. The Wii U has plenty of great software, but hasn't sold well due to lower end specs. It is perfectly capable of running many third party games, they just don't put effort into making quality ports. Look at the new batman game on PC with 37 dlc preorder bonuses, it is a terrible port.   The ""hardcore"" gamers, play the same third person, first person shooter and sandbox games,over and over with very little gameplay innovations. In fact, many games take out old, well loved features in order to simplify games (Bethesda games, Sonic games, sports games). The first party games on ps4 and Xbox are primarily first person shooters and third person shooters and more sandbox games.   Transformers 4 made a shit ton of money but the quality of the film is quite low. So sales don't exactly equal quality. It is more likely that the majority adult gaming population has fallen victim to the strategic marketing from the AAA game developers. You guys complain that Nintendo doesn't appeal to you but their games are different, even when the same characters are used maybe with the exception the sports titles and nsmbu which still adds new features and amazing level design and it sells the best over 3D Mario games which is weird because the ""hardcore"" gamers complain that it's the same every game, but then purchases every AAA game.

That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying Nintendo can attract developers that make mature titles IN ADDITION TO making their cool games that their fans are used to. The idea is that you would push for more adult titles to attract more gamers.   The Wii outsold all systems in its generation, like the original ds as well. arguably, almost every Nintendo game is a system seller. Their motto is sell hardware through great software. The Wii U has plenty of great software, but hasn't sold well due to lower end specs. It is perfectly capable of running many third party games, they just don't put effort into making quality ports. Look at the new batman game on PC with 37 dlc preorder bonuses, it is a terrible port.    The Wii sold well for a multitude of reasons, one being that the Wii Mote idea was novel. But lots of gamers including myself found out that having a new input device did not translate to deeper games and it made playing a lot of other games unwieldy and uncomfortable (especially FPS games). But we aren't talking about the Wii here. We are talking about the present, the Wii U. Let's keep it relevant.   The ""hardcore"" gamers, play the same third person, first person shooter and sandbox games,over and over with very little gameplay innovations. In fact, many games take out old, well loved features in order to simplify games (Bethesda games, Sonic games, sports games). The first party games on ps4 and Xbox are primarily first person shooters and third person shooters and more sandbox games.    You say this, but we see the same Marios, Mario Karts, Mario Parties, Zeldas, Pokemons and Smash Bros. year after year. However I will agree that a lot of series are like this: Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto, Madden, etc. But the point isn't about comparing which console has more unique games, but that Nintendo needs more of these staple titles in their library for fans that don't like the Nintendo games.   You guys complain that Nintendo doesn't appeal to you but their games are different, even when the same characters are used maybe with the exception the sports titles and nsmbu which still adds new features and amazing level design and it sells the best over 3D Mario games which is weird because the ""hardcore"" gamers complain that it's the same every game, but then purchases every AAA game.   You see this is the problem. I want to like Nintendo, but if the response to me wanting different games is ""JUST LIKE NINTENDO GAMES"", then I'm not going to bite. You have to be open to expanding the library with more mature titles. I don't care about Mario. I don't care about some stupid plot about saving some princess or something. I care about mature titles. I care about my characters in the Last of Us where they exist in a desolate world where civilization has been ravaged by a fungal virus. I care about how interpersonal relationships develop between characters like Ellie and Joel. I find that interesting. But Nintendo diehards will then say, ""JUST PLAY NINTENDO GAMES!"". And again, I say, they don't interest me. I don't care about the plot in Pokemon. There's nothing interesting about that. Zelda? It's always going to be some save-the-world scenario and you have to collect the same items in some dungeons. Nintendo doesn't make mature, adult titles; I'm saying make them.   I actually don't know a single person who would be dumb enough to buy a console over third party games, when the PC is already available, more powerful and cheaper.    It's a good point and I agree with it. I think consoles however are more portable and have certain exclusives. However, I will admit that most of my gaming is on the PC.   Honestly,mthe argument should be why doesn't Sony and Microsoft release their exclusives on the PC because they don't really have killer apps. Nintendo has always done their own thing and it almost always works out. I don't see any innovations with the ps4 or Xbox one,so what makes them better than a PC?   The idea here is that the Wii U is sucking hard. Sales are low and third party support is dwindling. My point isn't to say that the other consoles are better, but to show that Nintendo needs to get mature titles in order to gain some of its fans that it lost."

truegaming,3b7f30,Vordreller,63,Fri Jun 26 16:01:02 2015 UTC,"I'd very much disagree that the reason movies are seen as higher art is because popular figures support that notion, and that it might as well turn around at any moment.  This might some slightly inflammatory, but it's mostly because very few games actually even aspire to be higher art, and of those that do, even fewer manages to get to even a reasonable level of quality. For every game that is centered around a cohesive artistic vision and explores the area and still manages to come out as an actual product instead of an inane mess you could probably name a hundred movies that do the same.  Don't get me wrong, I love games, I play games probably several times as much as I watch movies, but when it comes to actual artistic competence, games are actually kinda shit.  Now obviously making a game more ""cinematic"" doesn't really necessarily do it any favors in the quality department, but cinema has had so much more time to properly establish itself as being more than simple commercial entertainment. Games will get to the stage movies are at now, definitely, but we're far from it yet.  The relation is the same between movies to books, too. For every exceptional movie that deeply explores some part of human existance, you could namea  thousand books, msotly due to how books have had an absurd amount of time to establish itself as an artform."
truegaming,3b7f30,Gobblignash,27,Fri Jun 26 18:06:43 2015 UTC,"when it comes to actual artistic competence, games are actually kinda shit.   In some respects I agree and in some I don't.  When we use a sort of popular notion of what art is as the bar, sure, older games have a hard time competing - and even newer ones often flop in that regard. Especially the writing is often cringe-worthy, but a lot of games just aren't really effectively about a message, or don't pay much attention to basic aesthetics like models clipping through each other in cutscenes.  But I think this may be simply because we're using an old idea of what art is. After a few decades it was clear film was art, but nonetheless film had to invent its own artistic criteria: mise en scene, montage, framing, and so on, to supplement acting and storytelling. Acting and storytelling are obviously still important to film, but there's all these other film-specific artistic things in there.  Similarly, we may still need time to really figure out and recognize artistry specific to ludic works. Super Mario Galaxy 2 has an astounding 97% critic score and 91% user score on metacritic, but it doesn't do a lot of the traditional artistic things. Using the artistic criteria of books, movies, or paintings, SMG2 is pretty much a flop. But a lot of people certainly seem to think it's a great game, and a lot of people certainly seem to think great games should be regarded as great art. So what is it about SMG2 that makes it artistic? Probably these nascent ludic factors. The way the camera works in a specifically ludic fashion, framing the level on arrival before moving to a more utilitarian platforming view, for instance.   Perhaps for games as an art form we should care a lot more about a utilitarian camera than one that frames content ""artistically"" as we have come to know it from film. After all, we all seem to basically agree fixed camera angles usually blow compared to a player-controlled camera, but we have no problem with fixed camera angles in movies. So perhaps for games a utilitarian player controlled camera is better for that art form than the most traditional cinematic, but fixed, angles.  I do think that while Ebert wasn't right to say games can't be art because the audience is also the artist, I also think he was on to something: it's just fundamentally harder for games to be art because the player is involved and the player probably isn't an artist. Nonetheless, while the criteria may feel less artistic than traditional artistic criteria, I also think perhaps games have their own artistic criteria that in time we'll be more readily able to identify. And in that sense, I do think at least to some degree it's about people just not being there to support games as art, but I think perhaps that stems from, as you say, a lack of maturity (in the sense of being developed, not in the sense of ""being serious"") in the form and our understanding of it. Games have a hard time being art not just because people aren't supporting them, but because people don't yet know HOW to support them as art. And that's the key point, I feel."
truegaming,3b7f30,Reddit4Play,10,Fri Jun 26 23:57:43 2015 UTC,"I think that your points about re-considering what makes something art are interesting. I think that SMG 2 is art in the same way a harley davidson or a rolex watch are art. All are close to being mechanically perfect representations of what they try to do. But all of them also lack a deeper purpose, meaning, or intention. And that's fine -- a harley davidson isn't trying to say something about what it means to be human any more than SMG 2 is, but it also means that, for me, these objects aren't really 'Art'. If we were to compare them with books, I would say that they are like very good genre fiction (an Agatha Christie murder mystery, for instance), but they aren't literary fiction."

truegaming,3b7f30,my002,3,Tue Jun 30 18:05:16 2015 UTC,"That's sort of where I think you run into a problem. It seems fair to maybe want to distinguish the applied arts from 'high art', which seems more like art for arts sake: a good building has to be functional as a building and as art, a good painting can only function as art, and so is 'purer' in a sense.  But if we took the distinction as being to do with some sort of meaning or purpose, you'd be excluding a lot of art that people would instinctively want to think of as high art. For example, can we really say that there is a deeper purpose, meaning or intention behind Velasquez's portrait of Pope Innocent X?. We might think it communicates something, but I think you'd have a very hard time arguing that it aspires to be anything other than a 'true' portrait of a man, whatever that may mean. However, at the same time I would think that any definition of 'high art' that excludes that painting would seem instinctively unappealing. Even if it might lack the 'deeper purpose' of more modern art, we generally imagine that painting, and many others, as existing in the same category of 'high art' as, say, Warhol's Brillo Boxes (which, on the opposite end of the spectrum, seems to be art that is entirely obsessed with 'deeper purpose': it is primarily commentary, the physicality of the art is secondary).   I would agree with what I think you're implying earlier though, and say that whatever this kind of 'high art' is, few games even attempt to sincerely enter that category, and I would add that those that do are so often unsubtle about their attempt that the finished product, while maybe 'high art', could never really be considered good art.   On the question of 'art' versus 'Art' overall, I would suggest a slightly better conception of it would be a focus on (as I mentioned before) the 'purity' of the art form: art that only aspires to be art seems to be the art we celebrate as 'high art', whereas art diluted by other concerns never seems quite as 'artistic', and so forms this kind of second category of mediums that aren't considered 'high art'. So comedy has to be funny, dance music has to be danceable, pornography has to be arousing and games have to be playable (and perhaps 'enjoyable', although that's debatable). These concerns seem to impair the ease with which works within those mediums can attempt to be 'high art'."
truegaming,3b7f30,Yorubaland,5,Thu Jul 2 12:52:25 2015 UTC,"To your Galaxy point, it is possible to consider games capable of being art without needing to consider every game art. Drawing, film, photography, etc. are all capable of (and even mostly known for) being art. But there are also ways to use the mediums in functional ways. If somebody is filming an interview for posterity, the product is still film but it is not art.   What I'm getting at is that games can be art, or they can just be games, or they can be both. I think it's pretty safe to say that Super Mario Galaxy is just a game. That's not a dig against it. It's great at what it is.

I think it would be much more accurate to say that ""most commercially successful movies follow this structure"" - to say that all good movies do so is not even close to accurate, in my opinion."
truegaming,3b7f30,Gobblignash,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:01:08 2015 UTC,"This might be wildly off-topic, to the discussion, but I actually think it's kind of important to the idea of what it means for something to be artistic.   I mean, Michael Hauge isn't a film theorist or anything. He's a script doctor - his work isn't saying ""all movies should (or already do) follow this structure"", it's saying that in order to make movies palatable to a wide audience (really, his work isn't even for audiences, it's for screenwriters who want to get their scripts bought) you should follow this predictable and easily understandable pattern of beats in a movie's plot. He's one of the primary reasons that so many mainstream movies are often indistinguishable from one indistinguishable from one another, at the level of plot. Why one rom-com or action movie or buddy comedy ends up looking a lot like another.   It's not because that's what makes a good movie - in the sense that ""good"" means interesting or innovative or thought-provoking or artistic or anything else - except that it's what makes a movie ""good"" if good means making a lot of money. Which many movies which follow these structures do. Because they're not challenging their audience (for the most part).  But there are tons and tons of great movies which don't follow anything resembling this plot structure - Tree of Life? Boyhood? Lots of the films of the Cohen brothers, Darren Aronofsky, P.T. Anderson? Almost anything by Kubrick, Bergman, the entirety of French New Wave, just for a start?  I hope I'm not being a jerk here. If so, I apologize!"

I'm not saying movies have an inherit value that games can never hope to reach, I'm saying you don't stumble over art by accident, there's an intention and some point the artist wants to come across. The difference between games and movies here is that there's a huge amount of movies that try to be anything beyond ""kill the bad guys and win"", in games I can honestly say there's only two games (of those that I've played) that actually manage to completly incorporate atleast some kind of higher message or ambition and actually have focus on some kind of point within a coherent and engaging storyline. I've played a few more games that incorporate higher themea into itself, but never within an engaging narrative that can stand on its own."

Haven't really gotten to watch much more though. But yeah, there's a huge mountain of simple movies coming out all the time, but I'd say there are more complex movies than complex games.  Checking an IMDB list now, I really enjoyed Grand Budapest, now not overly complex, but I don't know if it can be described as simple either, since it does have a nice melancholic mood over it. Then there are a few movies I haven't seen yet, like birdman, boyhood, whiplash or wild tales."
truegaming,3b7f30,Gobblignash,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:17:23 2015 UTC,"I would agree with you about not being much room for sophisticated storytelling in games would Silent Hill 2 not exist. But the other Silent Hill games doesn't come anywhere near it in quality, so I guess the planets just aligned that one time.  I might be using a bit too high a words, I could just put it bluntly and say most games never go past the adolescent fantasy of ""be the big man kill the bad guy"", I mean fucking hell, Bioware is praised as a great writer in this industry, and while their writing isn't terrible I would put it very far from great. See, there are very few games that actually don't have quite big problems with their narrative, as in, they have a bunch of weird clashing tones, awkward poorly writted dialogue, bad pacing and awful endings (this being particularly present in a whole bunch of games). There are honestly quite few games where the story actually ""works"", which is quite pathetic given how massive the industry is. While not a lot of movies are awfully complex, compartively a bunch of them don't have big troubles."
truegaming,3b7f30,ha11ey,2,Mon Jun 29 18:14:34 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I love games, I play games probably several times as much as I watch movies, but when it comes to actual artistic competence, games are actually kinda shit.   I think that depends on your definition of art if you are going to try and ""measure"" artistic competence.  To me, games are actually not at all shit artistically.  I ""measure"" art by how much it ""captures"" me.  That's sort of bullshit talk... really I care about the mental state known as flow.    In games, we typically call it immersion.  You lose your inner monologue and your sense of time.  You get ""sucked in.""    A good book, song, movie, or game can provide this sense of being taken to another land.  To me, this is the goal of all art.  To me, one of the most ""artistically competent"" games is Chess.  It's just so beautiful.  The pieces themselves are art, yes... but the game Chess is also art, in the mechanics.     Games will get to the stage movies are at now, definitely, but we're far from it yet.   As long as we treat them like movies, they will never get there.  The value is in the game itself... the mechanics.  We as a culture have to recognize that in mass and then recognize the people who designed that game."
truegaming,3b7f30,Gobblignash,5,Mon Jun 29 19:17:18 2015 UTC,"So you say the endgoal of art is escapism? That's it? A little bit of entertainment where you can think about other stuff than waht's going on in your life? A distraction for a few hours? To me that sounds extremely limited to what art can be. In that sense, complexity and depth are basically meaningless buzzwords, since it doesn't at all matter as long as you're engaged.  I mean this is all extremely subjective and it's absolutely wrong to tell someone what to enjoy and what not to, but to limit art to escapism seems like you're missing the forest for the leaves, when art can be so much more.  Also, I don't want games to be like movies, no one does because those people who do watch movies and don't bother about games. I want more game narratives to have the kind of complexity and depth great movies have and not get bogged down into poorly written bullshit as is the case with so many bloody games.  That said, I'm not one to tell people what their opinion of art should be, and everyone should be free to enjoy what they want. personally I just want some decent writers to get in rather than the clowns involved today."
truegaming,3b7f30,ha11ey,-5,Mon Jun 29 19:29:14 2015 UTC,"So you say the endgoal of art is escapism? That's it?    No I do not.  You are drastically narrow minded.  Flow doesn't have to be used purely for entertainment purposes.  It can be used to provide a very powerful dose of empathy.  It can provide for extremely powerful messages, both political or otherwise. Want to evoke change in someone?  Get them to actually understand the situation at it's most basic level.  Want them to understand a situation?  Put them in it.  Getting them to reach flow is simply pulling them in as far as possible.  It's letting them experience the situation for themselves.  Even simple political cartoons are trying to pull you in to give you a new perspective.  But I guess that's just escapism?  I understand why you thought what you did - I even wrote a paragraph originally sort of addressing this.  But ""being taken to another land"" doesn't have to be a fictional land, nor a pleasant one. But then to insult me???    personally I just want some decent writers to get in rather than the clowns involved today.   You seriously thought immersion is strictly escapism and then have the balls to insult people?  You are clowning it up hardcore.  I'm not even sure I should have typed out a reply you are such a joke."

Actually, in the first post you spoke about ""losing yourself in a world"" and being ""captured"", which is essentially escapism. Now you talk about political messages and so forth, which is meta. it's about addressing problems outside the realm of fiction, which is far mroe than just being ""immersed"".  And yes, my point is that games very rarely actually delve into those areas. Games are almost never about anything else ""kill the bad guy"", which fucking sucks, because games can be so much more than that. Really now, if you'd count all the movies with a great complex narrative being artistic in more than just escapism, and actually involving themes of humanity and that shit, and still being an engaging well told story, you'd end up in atleast a few hundreds, if you were very strict. With books? Thousands. With games? I'd be very surprised if you could name me more than ten that have a well told narrative and being about something more than someone with an altrustic goal."

Being ""captured"" doesn't mean escapism.  Escapism is a possible reason a person wants to be immersed.   it's about addressing problems outside the realm of fiction, which is far mroe than just being ""immersed"".   That's sort of missing my point.  Immersion is the best tool for addressing problems outside the realm of fiction.  These things are not mutually exclusive.  Immersion is not just a tool for entertainment."
truegaming,3b7f30,GeekAesthete,17,Fri Jun 26 19:56:24 2015 UTC,"While it was asked once or twice from the audience, I didn't hear a real answer to the question: why are movies ""higher"" art and games not?   The answer is longevity. Sure, culturally, movies are considered a higher art than games. But literature is generally considered an even higher art than movies, and largely because it's been around even longer.  And yet, there was a time when literature was a ""low art"" associated with young people. There was a perception (in some circles) that ""decent"" people enjoyed stories that were read or performed in public. Young people, however, were imagining -- fantasizing, even -- about mysterious things while they read their books in private. Who knows what's in those dirty little pages? What they're imagining in the minds, where no one can see it! If it was anything decent, it'd be enjoyed in public like it was back in my day, I can tell you that!  Movies started becoming accepted as ""art"" around the same time that the majority of the country had grown up with them. Same with literature. Same with jazz. Same with rock n' roll. So games are getting there. People need to stop worrying about what other people think and trying to convince them of ""games-as-art"" arguments and just enjoy the good things that are out there, because it's going to happen in its own time."
truegaming,3b7f30,Streetfoldsfive,5,Fri Jun 26 20:32:19 2015 UTC,"I'd be curious to see your support for literature being low art. I was under the impression that theater was for the common people who couldn't read, and that literature was more refined and artful because it was created and consumed by the rich."
truegaming,3b7f30,deviantbono,4,Fri Jun 26 20:48:44 2015 UTC,"Until the printing press, literature couldn't be disseminated commercially. Books like the Bible, then, were read in public (since not everyone could own a copy) and works that were worth reproducing by hand were typically well-known (and, indeed, owning such a copy was a mark of wealth). The industrial presses of the 18th and 19th century really revolutionized commercial printing, however. This is when the novel is really born (though there were earlier examples), and at this point, young people owning books that their parents had never heard of, and reading them in private, was a fairly new idea. So there were most certainly people getting on their soapboxes and lamenting the dirty things that were being disseminated in such books, and not everyone thought that the novel was high art straight out of the gate."
truegaming,3b7f30,Kerhole,7,Fri Jun 26 21:21:38 2015 UTC,"I typically disagree with SB on a lot of stuff. In fact, I believe that there are benefits to creating cinematic aspects in games. Camera angles, lighting, set piece design are all things I would consider cinematic, and they do somewhat add to certain games. I believe that games can be diverse enough that any type could exist. We can have cinematic Move-esque games like Heavy Rain, and we can have pure gameplay like Binding of Isaac or Mario. If possible I'd prefer to have people make games they believe in or want to. If David Cage wants to make the most cinematic game, then so be it. Its a medium that people can try different things with. While I don't agree with BH (and honestly have become burnt out on the pessimistic youtubers recently), I must say he is an intelligent man. He does an excellent job presenting his point (at least in this video). Keep doing good work!"
truegaming,3b7f30,xdownpourx,2,Fri Jun 26 22:16:30 2015 UTC,"I think part of it is that most art forms usually have been associated with a single (or small group) of named people. Litterature is usually written by one person, music also often by one or a small group. Movies are of course made by many more people, but often you can out a single director and/or writer behind. People like to view art as a single persons artistic vision. Games in general does not do that very often. It is made by lots of anonymous people and only those who really want to dig deep will find interest in the people behind the game.  I certainly believe that games can have a very strong artistic vision, but these ideas and the people behind are unknown to most people. I think we should able to appreciate games as art with other merits than the other artforms, but it will take time since games are working in a much different way than say litterature and movies. We are missing decades of academic research and analytical methods as the other artforms have developed whole schools of thought behind."
truegaming,3b7f30,bradamantium92,5,Fri Jun 26 17:38:01 2015 UTC,"If the only argument against video games being a higher art form is the structure of its development, I think it's a flimsy one. What about Japanese games where the game is a realization of the directors vision? What makes the structure of game development so different from film then? In film we can also say this guy did the directing, these people handled the musical composition, and he handled the cinematography, etc. So what makes the role of a game director like Kojima or Taro so different from directors like Antonioni or Kubrick? Is it simply artistic achievement that separates the two? What if renowned film directors decided to start making games and directed games to their vision?"
truegaming,3b7f30,cdstephens,2,Fri Jun 26 19:11:52 2015 UTC,"This is known as ""auteur theory"" and is not some natural evolution -- thinkers at the time had to argue that it was the case.  It has also caused an overreaction where the director is given all the credit even if the writing, editing, soundtrack, camerawork, etc. played a big role in the production and success.   However, you are right, games with a singular vision and singular leader are often the most heralded: Kojima, Miyamoto, Molyneux, Schafer, Blow, Fish, McMillen."
truegaming,3b7f30,SquishMitt3n,2,Fri Jun 26 19:42:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't know how it got started but it seems to be stuck in the culture around art.  There's nothing these days that isn't a collaboration with very rare indie exceptions."

truegaming,3b7f30,ZeNorseHorseSleipnir,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:53:57 2015 UTC,"When movies first came out, they were more of a collaborative effort instead of the director's vision and at that time they were considered a ""lesser"" art as well.   I don't think that really plays. Films are still seen as art and they're tremendously collaborative, moreso now than ever. Avatar brought in a billion dollars not just on the back of James Cameron's artistic vision, but thousands upon thousands of man hours went into realizing that vision by people whose names we'll never know. Even less ambitious movies have the same issue - who was the key grip on Boyhood? Even the director of cinematography, a major role that has a lot to do with how a film turns out, is invisible to the majority of filmgoers, even big time film fans. I think games as a collaborative endeavor often without a single, named driving force require a different approach as art, but hinging that definition on whether or not there's a name to attribute a game to is really hollow."
truegaming,3b7f30,Yorubaland,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:16:57 2015 UTC,"I think the answer for the question posed is that video games are much younger. You can look back through history and find that many mediums or genres when first introduced were derided as not ""true"" art, and it takes time for it to gain mainstream acceptance. And to a certain extent, time as well as fan support is needed for it to mature or develop in certain aspects, which hinders its status as being true art in the public. Compare the writing in your average video game to the average movie, or compare the best written video game to the best book. Also, movies, books, and music of many genres have well agreed upon classics that are considered as such by the public with a certain amount of respect (Tolkien's work for fantasy, Asimov for scifi, Beethoven, The Beatles, etc.)"
truegaming,3b7f30,Yorubaland,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:51:08 2015 UTC,"I believe the reason movies are seen as higher art is because the term ""art"" is being flattened whilst people think it is being expanded upon.  As soon as we start seeing mechanics, controls, sound effects, direction and etc - the core aspects of each medium - as art we'll stop comparing mediums and it'll just be about our own perspectives.  I feel that another reason comparing movies with games and saying one is seen as higher art is asinine is because that interpretation is down to each individual - so what if collectively more people think movies are a higher form of art? Let them think that. Personally I'll sit here and enjoy and explore the mechanics and controls put in place by my favourite artists - programmers."
truegaming,3b7f30,Yorubaland,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:17:21 2015 UTC,"Movie's aren't higher art. The reason why movies have more artistic integrity is because more artistic films have arised, and as time goes on more artistic games will arise.   A large part of this is the lowering costs of development. Through pre-made engines like Unity and Unreal developers can easily run through that rigged trial and error in games. A growing market comes to demand more and more types of games, and the industry is gaining more experience as to how to make better and better games.  There's nothing inherent to vidya that makes it harder to develop art for. It's just that the techniques that have developed over decades, the terminology to describe games on a deeper level, is either in a rudimentary state or flat out does not exist yet. But as games become more popular as a whole, the demand for these terms is going to rise sharply.   If games want to become more cinematic, then they deserve to be held to the same standards as cinema. If devs want to masturbate over just how ""emotional"" their games can be with them cutting edge next gen graphics engines, then they should be held up to the same standards that the actual cinematic artists have been held to for decades now.  As it turns out, game devs are really shit at cinematic experiences on the whole. If they were good at it? Perhaps the discussion might be going differently."

The Order put black bars on the screen, locked the framerate at 30fps, then showered us with QTEs. The Evil within did this black bar shit too.

The positive question of whether art is (societally, not metaphysically) divided into higher and lower forms is the relevant one here though, and the answer is, objectively, yes.   OP has put 'higher' in inverted commas, which I think makes it clear they're referring to it in a positive, not a normative, sense, and so whether or not you think the distinction is fair has no bearing on what they're saying: they're only pointing to the distinction as it is commonly understood, it's perfectly possible to talk about something that doesn't exist in actuality and it still be a useful analytical tool"
