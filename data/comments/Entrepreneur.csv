Entrepreneur,3e256c,catjuggler,18,Tue Jul 21 15:30:24 2015 UTC,Pretty much sums it up.
Entrepreneur,3e256c,CarlosLCervantes,4,Tue Jul 21 15:34:37 2015 UTC,"Yes. From the UC Berkley study cited:   we disaggregate the self-employed into incorporated and unincorporated to distinguish between ""entrepreneurs"" and other business owners."
Entrepreneur,3e256c,Section37,5,Tue Jul 21 20:26:30 2015 UTC,what the fuck kind of distinction is that? that's like distinguishing pots from kettles by color.
Entrepreneur,3e256c,Choscura,99,Tue Jul 21 21:19:01 2015 UTC,I think having a safety net helps.  A lot.  But I think there's more safety nets available than just having rich parents.  I'm sure I'm not the only one on here who pays my bills with a day job.
Entrepreneur,3e256c,wingman2012,46,Tue Jul 21 14:15:56 2015 UTC,Knowing that I can find a job after a brief search is a huge safety net.

I have the required skills to make at least 6 figures but all of the jobs available in my area are full time and don't allow me to work on side things or take focus off of their goals, which makes sense in an entrepreneur mind, right?..  If I was the company looking to hire someone, I wouldn't want this person working on stuff in the evening very much and potentially getting burned out and not productive in my company.  I'd have to get a very low paying job or continue with my side freelance work that I've always done to bring in extra cash."
Entrepreneur,3e256c,CrkdLtrN,19,Tue Jul 21 16:14:23 2015 UTC,Why even disclose you're starting a company.
Entrepreneur,3e256c,burlycabin,8,Tue Jul 21 16:38:45 2015 UTC,Good question. Not as easy as it sounds though. If you have a gap in employment they want to know what you've been doing and if you still are doing it. I guess I could say I've taken a three year hiatus in the Caribbean but I doubt they believe me.
Entrepreneur,3e256c,CrkdLtrN,8,Tue Jul 21 17:14:24 2015 UTC,just say you were dealing with illness or some shit
Entrepreneur,3e256c,mushyz,2,Tue Jul 21 17:15:57 2015 UTC,"That may work.  They're prevented to ask about it by law right?  So they can't say ""was it a mental illness or?"""
Entrepreneur,3e256c,CrkdLtrN,5,Tue Jul 21 17:38:41 2015 UTC,"Not sure about legally but most people will just change the subject immediately. No one's gonna be like ""oh was it cancer...or something else?"""

Entrepreneur,3e256c,doctorace,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:10:20 2015 UTC,"I think _cott0n meant that as the explanation of the ""gap"" in employment. Depending on the job/contract, you'd just say you're not going to freelance if you take a job with the new employer. If you do continue to freelance on the side of a new job and the employer says you can't, then you just have to be very, very careful about when and how the freelancing gets done so that you don't get caught."
Entrepreneur,3e256c,O_Cressida,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:30:24 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but if they want to know if ""you're still doing it"" you'd have to answer that question. A quick check on your linkedIn or Google of your name might disprove that you were freelancing. Usually if you were freelancing they'd like to know who you were working for and possibly talk to them."

Entrepreneur,3e256c,wbknoblock,2,Tue Jul 21 21:45:25 2015 UTC,Hard to do in some situations.  Sometimes disclosure is as easy as a google search for your name.

Entrepreneur,3e256c,poopshoward,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:35:39 2015 UTC,"This probably depends on where you are, but in Europe it's not unusual for an employer to require you to disclose other work because they are legally on the hook if you work more than the maximum hours. Failing to answer the question will probably be an instant no-hire blocked by legal, and lying in a job interview is not generally a smart move."
Entrepreneur,3e256c,Silhouette,4,Tue Jul 21 20:40:15 2015 UTC,"That's interesting.   My current employer had a total opposite reaction. ""Oh you're doing that? That's very cool! Hopefully it works out for you!"""

This is a stupid line of thought. You going to ask someone the same question if they tell you they play the lottery or have a wealthy relative who might die soon and leave them money?  An employer should be excited to hire on someone with the drive, passion, discipline and skill to go after starting their own business. Even if they have them for a short time, they'll get more out of someone like that than they will some lifer who is just looking to get by."

I would never recommend you 'liquidate' anything, but borrow against a retirement account in desperate times. Try to see that 401k as your back-up plan for retirement if you don't have cash in the bank vs. as a checking account for starting a business; your retirement years (old age) is much more certain than your business success or whether or not you'll ever have kids or someone special you want to help.  If you can, just do the consulting on the side until you have about 1 -2 years of living expenses saved or go set meetings as if you are already self-employed and quit when you land a solid, multi-month gig."

Entrepreneur,3e256c,thinglistr,6,Tue Jul 21 18:58:49 2015 UTC,"I have been in Mexico and you can get for almost free: basic medical care, go to college, technical school or state university even cultural entertainment, state music concerts and plays, all museums are free one day of the week, groceries and home help services are cheap too, and the dollar/peso exchange rate is at historic highs, so US dollars go long way.  If you are in the tinkering phase of a new venture this can provide you a very basic safety net that won't distract you compared with the stress of living in the USA while you have very low or zero income.  I think moving to other countries would be similar, once that you have your product ready to be marketed then you can open a sales office and move back to USA.  I know you would say the violence yada,yada but there are small/medium size boring towns where you can be safely ignored by the locals, and that is what I want.  Depends on what your creative juices are working on but a small to medium size city would have some providers for what you need, you can find Internet service everywhere."

Losing my job would not be a good thing at all, and there are definitely times where I would like to ""find myself"" and take a little time off.  I didn't get that as a kid or a teenager, and as an adult I started a family at a young age.  I really enjoy working hard and making gradual progress toward improving myself, but gosh it'd be nice knowing I at least had the option to drop off some stress temporarily sometimes so I could pursue my next big thing."

Ask an immigrant from the last hundred years how hard it was to build their business, or someone who fought in a damn war and came back home and started a business.  We have it easy comparatively .

Entrepreneur,3e256c,flimflamwhimwham,3,Tue Jul 21 17:37:35 2015 UTC,"Safety nets can exist on a spectrum.   It doesn't have to be massive wealth but rather, just something that provides some kind of buffer. (+ an idea you really believe in.) For example, I've quit my job to start my own company. I am completely broke, I make some money here and there but right now I have nothing. If i had to pay rent I would be  evicted, I don't even have enough money to buy food but I live with my dad rent free and eat his food and use his wifi. (hopefully not for much longer) - Im 25.   I am about to start a half day au pairing job to self fund my prototyping phase (Hourly pay of R80 / $6.48 - 20 hours a week - It's not much but its enough giving me some money and some time) Almost all of that income will go into my new venture because my basic costs of living are taken care of and outside of that I'm business first, new-clothes-and-nice-things later.   I have no substantial monetary investment from anyone other than myself but i have a place to stay and food to eat. To me this is a luxury, an incredible privilege and it's all i need to get started. This is my buffer.  I don't think it's a gene for risk. It's either  *desperation + idea OR *some kind of buffer + idea OR *fountains of wealth + idea"

But you can start a $100,000 business with $1000. And you can turn a $100,000 business into a billion dollar business. The problem is people equate entrepreneurs with startups, and start ups with tech companies. Tech companies take a lot of start up capital, and competition for funding is fierce. So the guys who succeed in that world often have to turn to family or friends for the cash.   Sure silicon Valley may be flooded with trust fund entrepreneurs, but I think that's mostly isolated to the entrepreunial hot spots like SF, NY or Seattle.   I've met a lot of business owners and a lot of corporate employees.

The technical knowledge required to start a tech company is expensive any way you put it. Either you invest the time to learn or you pay someone who has.

Entrepreneur,3e256c,theWebDon,4,Tue Jul 21 15:09:37 2015 UTC,"Without question, the article is ""reporting"" from inside the bubble and bogarting their own farts. The vast majority of entrepreneurs are not trust fund kids, they don't appear on magazine covers, they don't become millionaires or billionaires. The vast majority are all around us: the hairdresser, the butcher shop, the neighborhood pub, the local plumber, the local web designer, etc. Often small, usually passionate, and pretty non-glamorous.    It's also disingenuous to think that any business operates in a vacuum. We all benefit from external sources somehow - a small unexpected windfall that gets spent on starting a business instead of some unneeded electronic, a spouse that carries more of the financial burden for a while, an unquenchable passion to do something better/faster/cheaper then anyone else, or dire circumstances that force one's hand into becoming a business without a safety net because there is no other choice.   The argument of a ""special gene"" is a strawman to begin with, but to refer to any help or circumstance as some kind shortcut to untold wealth is ludicrous. The author presents a false comparison (gene vs. silver spoon), reads a single research paper, and then falsely applies the lack of journalistic skill to only the simplistic veneer of ""Valley Entrepreneurs""."

They're simply making the claim that all entrepreneurs come from money based off the few examples they looked at.    the most common shared trait among entrepreneurs is access to financial capital—family money, an inheritance, or a pedigree and connections that allow for access to financial stability.    I don't believe this. The article would have you believe the average entrepreneur is financially stable enough to take no risk by investing their money in their business. Or that family and friends provide the funding while the entrepreneur lives cozily. We all know that's not true."
Entrepreneur,3e256c,theWebDon,18,Tue Jul 21 15:45:39 2015 UTC,"I think having access to personal/family wealth is a big part of creating a successful business, but more so because additional cash can cover up some of those mistakes an inexperienced business owner will inevitably make when starting out.  However,  I think a factor that is even more important in creating a successful start up is having mental endurance. This may be isolated to my individual experience, but a high % of the successful entrepreneurs who I know are also long distance runners (or some other kind of endurance athlete). When you think about it, this isn't totally shocking either. The mental discipline it takes to train every week and get your body to the point where you can run 10+, 15+ 20+ miles at a time is not something that everyone has. It's the same endurance that allows you to push through the mental barriers telling you it's easier to just stop running that pushes good entrepreneurs to work harder on their business. Lot's of entrepreneurs (myself included in the early stages of my career) quit because things get too hard. The successful ones are the people who continue to grind out small successes in the face of those hardships."

Entrepreneur,3e256c,petvotion,5,Tue Jul 21 14:03:08 2015 UTC,"I'll vouch for this!  I go from from needing 10+ hours of sleep a day when I don't exercise, just so I have enough time to decompress and tackle the next day... to around 5 - 6 hours when I exercise.  Exercise pays off on so many levels, but you definitely have to make sure you plan for it if you have struggled in the past."

Failed, almost messed things up for my family, tried again with what little resources I had...  I'm older and wiser now and would go about things differently.

I've noticed that many entrepreneurs can work extremely hard for days on end and operate fairly regualry on minimal sleep. They can basically red line their body and their body and mind can genetically handle the abuse. Most people break much earlier and it's not a matter of willpower."

Entrepreneur,3e256c,OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR,5,Tue Jul 21 21:48:07 2015 UTC,"I was robbed. I got into business because someone stole all my stuff.  I had a fairly large comic book collection... shit from back when I was 11 years old. Some cool kinves and swords, computer equipment, cameras and a few other things and the thieves did damage to some of my furniture.  My wife and I were moving and the 'old house' wasn't going to be rented for a while... we knew the owner well and were allowed to keep things there in storage while we painted and fixed up the new residence and moved in slowly.  While the old house was vacant, we were broken into.  The cops were totally useless. Just fucking ridiculous. They didn't even fucking try.  I spent days wandering the woods and shit, talking to neighbors etc... and finally found a clue. A neighborhood kid had one of my knives. His Dad discovered it, took it from him, and then when I talked to him one day, we both were able to put two and two together. A discussion with his kid, led me to another kid, that led me to another kid's brother and so on... and I found my thieves.  I called the police, presented a decent amount of evidence and one of them was arrested.  This whole thing took place over two years... I'm shortening things dramatically.  Kid goes to a restitutuon home for which he's made to work, and 80% of the proceeds are supposed to come to me weekly. I got one check for $88 and then never heard anything again.  I got pissed off and called up the local 'establishment' to find out what the deal was. He had gotten out of the home and was on the street again, paying nothing, and not being punished.  I called his probation officer every two weeks for alomst a year. He was called back into court ( I went to the courthouse and was allowed to speak)  to answer for not paying his restitution, and ended up back in the home.  A few weeks go by and then one day... my wife comes in from checking the mail with a crazy grin on her face and hands me a slip of paper... that's a check from the local gov for $5300  The kid's grandmother paid off the restitution so that he could get out.  I'd been working for other graphic design firms, screen printers, and sign shops for a long time.  I ordered a plotter, a few rolls of material and some tools, a box of business cards and quit my job.  I've been in business for 15 years now. Doing pretty well.   I still get pissed about some of the things I lost. That Frank Frazzetta Hologram set would be wicked cool to have now... but I think I made up for it well enough.  In case it matters to anyone, outside of all this. I grew up poor. I have almost zero formal education."
Entrepreneur,3e256c,SCphotog,5,Tue Jul 21 14:18:33 2015 UTC,Curious: have you ever checked back w/ the grandmother? Was she a rich/entitled sort who wanted to make her darling grandson's issues go away? Or did she sell off family heirlooms/neglect her own health care to pay you?

The two thieves were brothers. The older brother was the instigator and the younger brother... somewhere on the autistic scale was baited into doing foul deeds by the older, and then left holding the bag when things went south.  Years after the incident with my stuff... they and some other people, one girl and I think another guy, went on a local stealing spree where they stole someone's Winnebago. A big...really big motor home, drove it around town at night using it to conduct their heists.  They broke into storage facilities and the like, set things on fire and caused a bunch of general mayhem.   Took the cops a couple of weeks to end their tirade, but they eventually all went to jail, at least for a while. The motorhome was found in an open field near my home, up in a giant blaze of diesel fuel and plastic.  I'm not sure of their whereabouts or situation at present. They have family that lives kind of near to me. I expect that sooner or later I'll run into them at the gas station or the hardware store or something."

The whole of their yard was aluminum cans is what I'm saying. It's hard to describe. Anywhere that wasn't cans was just weeds and trash.  AFAIK recycling and delivering the newspaper were the Dad's source of income... though I'd make some bets on him also receiving some form of disability or whatever.

Entrepreneur,3e256c,CasualLoaner,10,Tue Jul 21 16:04:21 2015 UTC,"It's both true and false.  There is some irony to entrepreneurship in that it is easy for the very poor, and easy for the very rich - and hard for everyone in the middle.    It might be fun to hear Musk repeatedly remind us that he arrived in California with a barely a dollar to his name.  What I haven't heard him say is that he came from a pretty wealthy and privileged family.  He can live as poor and frugal as he likes - but he has an exit anytime he wants an exit.  He makes 1 phone call, and mom and dad will buy him a $1500 ticket back to South Africa so he can live in some swanky and gougers house.    If your parents are millionaires and you will have those millions for doing nothing eventually, what is the point of working?  How do you justify your existence?  You don't need a 50K job and save for retirement and house down payment.  You need something that either has giant financial rewards that actually make a difference to you, or you need something that will leave a mark on society and give you a lot of personal satisfaction.    That said, a lot of these articles are written in the context of Silicon Valley/tech.   But what about the remaining 95% entrepreneurs in this country?  My local Chinese takeout is operated by a family that has all banded together to open it up.  (they even have their 10 year old daughter sometimes take orders.)  My neighbor came from Ethiopia and in the 7ish years he's been here, he's owned and sold a ghetto grocery store, he drives a cab right now and is looking for another store to open or buy, and he does some minor city contracting.  Somehow, he manages to pay the mortgage on my street where rowhouses go for $400-750K.  He has a pretty good life.  But entrepreneurship was forced on him.  He couldn't get a Middle America office job and sit on his ass in front of the computer for 40-80K, like most of my friends.   Instead, he works for himself and can make 30K on a bad year and 130K in a good year.  (I'm totally guessing these numbers.)    The most entrepreneurship I've ever seen is in crowded Asian and African countries.  Especially in Africa, there are very few traditional ""jobs.""  A huge chunk of people are involved in informal economy.  They trade, sell, offer services.  A million tiny businesses.     So to me, entrepreneurship draws both the rich and the poor.  It's when you have a 60K office job (without rich parents waiting in the background) that it becomes very hard to leave and try something uncertain."

(That's not even entirely true, as some businesses require much larger upfront costs than others. It costs less than $2000 to start an internet business (computer + software + compute time on some cloud service) but 100x that minimum to start anything related to oil/gas expedition, for example.  Case in point: this quote:   The average cost to launch a startup is around $30,000,   is missing the other half of the paragraph from its source (emphasis mine):   In 2009, the Kauffmann Foundation estimated that the average start-up cost was approximately $30,000. The truth is that no business is the same and many micro-businesses can get started for as little as $3,000 or less."

My mother raised me, my brother, and my sister off of a minimum wage job and help from the church and friends. We had absolutely nothing and my entrepreneurial drive came from that. I wanted to lighten the burden for my mother and that is exactly what I did. In the summers I mowed grass, in the winters I shoveled snow. I bought my own clothes, I bought school supplies, I paid for field trips, I did everything I could to help her out and that shaped my mindset and ultimately landed me in my current position 10 years later.

I want to make something of myself. My family is solidly upper middle class and I've lived a comfortable life. But I want more and I want to work for it. Unlike my brothers, I've actually got drive and aspirations. Sure, having a safety net of a 7000 sqft home and a car paid by my parents helps, but I'd rather not take anything from them. They worked hard to have what they have, they should enjoy it. The last thing I want to do is rest in the laurels of my family."
Entrepreneur,3e256c,DangerMagnetic,4,Tue Jul 21 18:29:50 2015 UTC,"Just.plain.wrong.  I grew up middle class.  I have now risked everything twice to pursue what I believed were good ideas/dreams.  I started my first company with my last $5,000 in savings and needed get get paid from my first client in two weeks or I wouldn't have been able to make my mortgage.  I never took investment from anyone (external or friends and family) and grew it for ten years prior to sale.  I took some of those proceeds four years after the sale of company 1 and used them as seed money to start my second company.  I've floated the costs of software development and hiring to grow the company - again, no additional money.  I know many, many entrepreneurs and none, I mean none, has used friends and family money.  They're either grown organically, folded the company, or taken external investment.  While there are definitely some people who start businesses with family money as ""something to do,"" my experience shows this to not be the norm.  The article only analyzes a very narrow swath of ""entrepreneurs"" and ignores the VAST majority.  Think about restaurant owners, independent consultants, ""single shingle"" lawyers/accountants/book keepers/etc, bakery owners, barbers, etc, etc.  THESE are also entrepreneurs, but they don't conveniently fit into the ""research"" that's cited.  It's a very elitist look at entrepreneurialism used to prove a point.    [exit soap box]"
Entrepreneur,3e256c,krv319,3,Tue Jul 21 15:05:30 2015 UTC,"Entrepreneurship has also been how immigrants start to make a living in America for a long time. It is how commerce works in many poor and minority neighborhoods because you can be damn sure no big companies take the risk of being the first ones in even though everyone needs stuff to live. It is also part of the life of every scrappy guy on the street buying and selling or doing service work to survive because they don't have the credentials to get a job if they wanted to.  I think this analysis might owe its conclusions to their stated assumption that a business isn't successful unless it's incorporated. That is a weak assumption and it drops all of the above in favor of larger businesses but also of shell corporations, holding companies and the like. It is surprising those are rich and white?"

Entrepreneur,3e256c,kdem007,2,Tue Jul 21 14:28:22 2015 UTC,"I wrote out this long post with personal information about how much my own actions (and relationships) are responsible for my success having 'started companies' since I was six years old. More significantly, I've been self-employed for the last four years starting when I was 27.   And writing it all out, I realized that yes, without my actions and professional relationships, I would be in the same boat as my other three siblings who primarily do inconsistent food service work. But my family's money had to have made a difference in my own life. Without the background my parents paid for, perhaps I would not have developed the professional skills and network that supports me in my current lines of business. With student or car loans, perhaps I would never have felt confident I could meet all liabilities.  The fact that they had and have any money to give provided/s if nothing else, a mental safety net, and there is real value to that. The fact that I've been in a long term relationship with someone else provides an additional safety net - on months when there is little money in my bank account, I simply don't pay anything and 'make it up' in the following months.   I have no way of knowing how my life or any other 'successful' entrepreneur would be without family resources. I bet we all experience the traumatic emotional roller coaster, and that is not for most people. So I can say this: even with money, there are no guarantees for success  - but without money, I personally still would have tried to make it 'on my own.'"

The risk-taking middle class that this country has always had is something we took for granted. Now that's it's nearly gone you're either an extremely poor entrepreneur with no means for funding your ideas (therefore no-one even knows about you or your idea) or you're an extremely wealthy entrepreneur with connections that take you to the top, and if you fail...well...then you just go back to your mansion and start over."

The fact is the barriers to starting a business have never been lower - for everyone.

Does it mean it is guaranteed?  Of course not.  Is it impossible?  Depends, but again that's not the point.  The point is to DO.  The rich kid can start his business with money pooled from family.  The kid whose parents work at the gas station or other minimum wage jobs can also succeed and become equally or MORE successful as the rich kid but there's more effort involved and THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.  That is part of being in a CAPITALISTIC society.  I personally know a handful of people who came from such backgrounds who attended great colleges (trust me, Ivy Leagues LOVE kids from the bottom WHO TRY HARD AND SUCCEED and anyone on Reddit who DID NOT attend one of those schools doesn't know anything...) either private or state and DID SOMETHING AMAZING.  Entrepreneurs DO have a special 'gene' - the drive to succeed against all odds.

Entrepreneur,3e3756,toasttothewin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:40:25 2015 UTC,Did your drop shipper require you to have a minimum quantity order or do you pay them as orders come in. That's the reason that stopped me from dropshipping. The products I wanted to sell I didn't have enough money to buy upfront.

Entrepreneur,3e3756,BaileyBoutique,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:05:58 2015 UTC,How does the dropshipper know when to send out an order?? Are their computers integrated into shopify somehow or do you have to manually send them customer details and shipping info?

The site looks good, header looks great, you could consolidate a little. Modern sites are really minimal in my opinion. Especially furniture.

It will greatly increase % of people who will read the article. My advice on making interesting content  - ask yourself really absurd questions on topics you want to write about. Like ""All people do X, what happens if I did the opposite of the X, where would it lead me? What would happen?"" etc. Offer different perspective on things."
Entrepreneur,3e3zvi,Huseens,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:27:57 2015 UTC,"Good content,  it's what I call a product in a post.. High value actionable content well presented.

Apart from that I think you've created content that will get curated and shared and drive traffic to your product  Edit: what did you use for the click to tweet box?"
Entrepreneur,3e3zvi,Trackbikes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:05:11 2015 UTC,"It doesn't suck, but it doesn't ""really kick ass"" either.  Basics are fine: you can write well enough and there's a good rhythm to the sentences. The sections have headers and I wasn't confused about what you were saying, etc.  The gaps I think you need to cross is in the subject matter and the voice.  Subject Matter  This is all 101 stuff. It's well written and there's certainly an audience for it, sure. But I can find essentially these same ideas and concepts on any number of ""how2business"" sites. You're taking on very broad ideas here. I think content that has a niche focus tends to have more inherent value (e.g. spend a whole long form post on how to tell the difference between a sales funnel activity vs a lead gen activity. Both are ""basic"" things but that interesting angle on your process for labelling theoretically adds some value.)  You're also using example from big ol' companies. Your own personal examples would be much more interesting.  Voice  This is the make or break for the written word. It's what publishers and agents in fiction look for more than anything else. It's why Tim Urban from WaitButWhy caught the attention of Elon Musk, and how he can write 10 billion word articles and still convince strangers to give him over $5000/month.  It's also not something you achieve solely with actionable feedback items.  It's your inherent ability to bring flavour and entertainment into the words. It doesn't need to be funny, per se, but it does need to entertain, illuminate, inspire. It needs to give me a little itch to scratch, and maybe make me a little disappointed when I reach the end, because now there are no more awesome words. It's the thing that will convince someone to actually legitimately share the article.  You voice in this article is pretty bland, IMO. It's confident, but that's about it. It's a touch arrogant actually, especially with those little tweetable quotes. It doesn't have anything about it that would make it stand out from the sea of other ""how2business"" posts out there.  The best tips to improve/find/tweak voice that I can think of off the top of my head:   Read a lot — but read as a Writer. If you have a bunch of favourite articles/content that's inspired you, read them analytically and try to distill the voice out of it. Write a lot — dat practise!   Cheers, hope this helps!"

They assert that people will leave after 3 seconds (which is a verifiable statistic), but 3 of the top 10 pages load after 5 seconds.  They're successful because they're huge, goliath news organizations. They have written content for years (if not more than a decade), they have old domains that have years and years of backlinking and traffic, and they have absurd dollars to throw at marketing, PR and social media.  If you want to mess with the big dogs, you need to keep your site fast, easy to read, and easy to share. The content will have to hit in a new and interesting way (sort of how Buzzfeed ascended the ranks with its click-baity lists)."

Entrepreneur,3e0cfr,ventureguy1,55,Tue Jul 21 00:33:05 2015 UTC,this sounds the most plausible. just liquidate the inventory and wind down. you don't need to sell the business to get out and trying to sell it may just slow you down in pursuing other things.

If it's still hot in other places in the country, there's a place to sell inventory (either in bulk or via an online platform like Amazon). If it's winding down nationwide, then it's okay to shut it down and liquidate."
Entrepreneur,3e0cfr,njtrafficsignshopper,5,Tue Jul 21 02:10:46 2015 UTC,It's winding down in our area. Just getting hot in some other areas of the country. Most of the country doesn't even know what or product is.
Entrepreneur,3e0cfr,njtrafficsignshopper,31,Tue Jul 21 02:27:02 2015 UTC,"If it lends itself to it, I'd look at bringing it to Amazon via FBA (assuming you know how that works). Totally hands off, and if it's a fad that's taking off, then you could hit some big sales with relatively little effort.  If not, then I'd look at liquidating the inventory to someone in another city where it is getting hot (maybe include the instagram account with it to sweeten the pot)"

Entrepreneur,3e0cfr,niklos,5,Tue Jul 21 06:08:03 2015 UTC,"Dude, you made $30k from a fad business and have probably surpassed 95% of the users on this sub. Liquidate your stock, take the money and build something on a bigger scale.   If you can flog your business to someone for a few thousand dollars even better, but I wouldn't be concerned if you can't. By the way, living out of home is expensive. Budget more than you expect to and try keep a few thousand in an emergency account at all times."
Entrepreneur,3e0cfr,Gargladdy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:35:20 2015 UTC,"This.   OP did just fine. But that doesn't mean the next venture will be easy or cheap.   I would suggest /u/BlueSkyCry stay with his parents and pick up a part-time job. Put the $30k into something very liquid that will earn a bit of money but won't lose a lot while the next business is forming.   The main issue here is that it's not a business. It's a product. And it's a product that may not have a great future. And it's a product that's not exclusive to OP. And it's a product that's not being sold by people that are passionate about it.   Sell what you can. Think about and write about (personally) what happened and plot your next course OP. But do it all on the cheap. $30K doesn't last long. I think I earned $45K plus $2K to move out of college and I was just scraping by. Not to mention SB is a tough neighborhood for new businesses. A lot of people that have money to splurge want nice things. Price insensitive customers are great, but they have great expectations."
Entrepreneur,3e0cfr,Rudiger_Smoot,13,Tue Jul 21 12:36:34 2015 UTC,Good point. Santa Barbara is a really unique market. It's all boutiques.
Entrepreneur,3e0cfr,eykanspelgud,42,Tue Jul 21 13:53:48 2015 UTC,"This is normal.  Let me speak from experience in having locations in malls in which some failed and some succeeded.    1 - You can't sell the business if you're not making money. No one would buy it unless you get extremely lucky, but in your case, since it's a kiosk, anyone can get one setup. 2 - Employees make you or break you, you need the operator model, get someone to run the business who is a excellent salesman, as if you're running it.  Let them keep majority of the profits and you keep a small 10-15% cut. Expand and grow. 3 - Malls rent varies, by season that is which I'm sure you're aware of. Many also go by percentage of sales.  A good word of advice will be is that if you're renting a kiosk, you can play with the terms a lot more than you think.  It's common for malls to have vacant kiosks all season long.  You can have a clause in there to leave at any time with a 30-60 day notice.  You throw this clause in there right at the last moment when the mall leasing agent is expecting you to sign the deal.  They will end up going for it.  I've done it every single time. 4 - You can still turn things around, maybe your employees aren't doing the job right (which is usually the care 90% of the times).  Do you have clerks or salesman? Are they motivated enough?  When was the last time you secret shopped them?  Many of them are just on their phones... they think they are doing you and the customer a favor by helping them when its the other way around.  Work the kiosk yourself for a few days and see if that makes a difference.  I guarantee you'll see better results the first day alone. 5 - Your inventory - sell in bulk on craigslist / ebay / flea market.  if its a seasonal item then maybe it makes sense to wait it out, if you can, till next season. 6 - Cut your losses short, you did what many people can't and that was make money running a successful business.  There will always be ups and downs.  You learn from it and move on. 7 - Utilize your instagram followers, if they liked you or bought from you before, they might be willing to buy more for a deal or discount.    Let me know if you have any other questions or comments."

Entrepreneur,3e0cfr,merc9,9,Tue Jul 21 12:45:48 2015 UTC,"I see that you're trying to justify the value of your business in some of the comments in spite of the suggestions to liquidate your assets. I can respect where you're coming from totally but can only suggest you don't be clouded by your own experience and feed into what you're selling. Fad based products aren't impossible to move but they don't make for a great long term business - the longevity of a business is really the ability to take capital and spin it into something new (new product, branding, intellectual property)... you're selling everything but this future potential.  When selling a business you want to sell operations, talent, branding, and product or patents. You are essentially selling product alone. Without specifics, I can speculate that your branding isn't going to make or break this for a buyer. Maybe you have a sweet domain name? That's worth putting up. But unless you have a clever way of moving product, why would a buyer want your actual business? Retail is quite a commitment, especially brick and mortar.  Your assets and inventory are likely the way to go. Sell it off or spin the business. Hell, do both - sell the inventory and transform the business if you want. And don't disregard ebay and amazon as an alternative way to move product if you actually want to and are willing."

Entrepreneur,3e0cfr,YourDumbLetsParty,6,Tue Jul 21 02:58:24 2015 UTC,"On thing I'll add it that you should take this as a learning experience in the future. If you're doing to do a fad-based business, you should have a ""get out"" plan from the beginning. A little extra money up front for a shorter lease, less inventory in stock or a guaranteed wholesale buyer, etc etc might lead to having more money in the bank when you hit the eject button. I'm sure there are much better lessons to learn from this as well that I don't know because I wasn't there, that's just an example.  Every failure (or in this case, success that could have been slightly more successful) is a lesson on how to do things differently in the future. Realize that, and act on it, and you'll go far."
Entrepreneur,3e0cfr,erdle,5,Tue Jul 21 12:38:28 2015 UTC,"Strong Work! And congratulations! You've done what most people wont do... You are the man in the arena.  Seems to me you have two options... Sell your business before your mall lease expires (short notice...) or sell your inventory.  To sell your business, based on what you've said, you need to capitalize on the greater fool theory. Not that there's anything wrong with that. We all trade what what we have for something else believing we are getting the better bargain. Like others have said, your clients may be your best bet for finding a buyer.  Look at it this way... If your other option is inventory liquidation at an optimistic $12K what would you take for your business? $15k? Don't be greedy. Be reasonable.  Alternatively, liquidate your inventory, wash your hands, and move on. Your best bet here may be your competitors. Sell your $12K of inventory for $8-10K and be happy.  The reality is the knowledge you've earned in starting the business, working the business, and selling the business is 10x more valuable than the college education ""many high school graduates"" will be paying for.  Do it again. And again. And again...."
Entrepreneur,3e0cfr,zhidzhid,0,Tue Jul 21 03:39:45 2015 UTC,"You ask for advice, and it is this: be honest... which you're not.  A quick look through your comment indicates that you're running a mall kiosk selling toys - probably toy helicopters. Until 1 month ago, you thought you'd be earning six figures.   What you're running is not a business, it's fad.   I say this without judgement. I have no problem with earning money for short lived opportunities ranging from July 4th, to beanie babies, to toy helicopters. There's money to be made - just not money that will last for years and years.   My point here is be honest. Were you honest about your long term plans? Were you honest about your exit strategy? Were you honest with all of your employees and everyone involved?   Chalk this one up to life experience. Negotiate with who you can, sell what you can get. At 18, you have years and years ahead of you. Your experiences at your age far exceed mine and for that I'm very happy for you. Keep at it."

I honestly was on track for very close to that at the time and I may have exaggerated a little bit to be able to say 6 figures. In real life people praise me for my business all the time and I work hard to stay humble so sometimes on the internet I can get kind of carried away. In my current post everything is 100% accurate.    Were you honest with all of your employees and everyone involved?    Yes absolutely I have been 100% transparent with all of them. Not only have I been burned out during these summer months, but my employees have also and they are also ready to move on.    Keep at it.    Thank you for your encouraging words.

If you have a good location in a good mall that is. If the mall isn't good, you're going to have a very tough time. Your business is worth its location more than anything else. What city are you located in? Who is the mall operator? How is your relationship with management?  Management can always amend the lease to let you sell other things. Why not add new products to your kiosk and diversify a bit? Is it a kiosk or push cart? Retail resource is great magazine related to what you do. You should contact them, see if they can set you up with a buyer. You just missed their big trade show though. You know any of the other kiosk owners in your mall? Some guys in worse locations might have their leases ending soon and would be willing to take over your spot and operate their business. I might be interested. $1,500-$3,000 a month is very cheap. I fear this might not be a great mall. The ones in my area are way more expensive, but I know people doing numbers that are hard to believe. When you talk with potential buyers, don't make it so obvious you have a ""failing business"". Don't lie, but try to be a bit more cunning. Sell them on the potential and that you just weren't putting the effort in to run it properly.   PM me if you need advice. I know of people who sold their kiosk leases and I operate a kiosk currently as a side gig."

Entrepreneur,3e0cfr,Endurum,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:20:09 2015 UTC,Hey man I know this isn't advice but props to you for starting your own business at such a young age!  I'm almost twenty four and really haven't accomplished a whole lot as far as external success.  I really admire your hustle and it's encouraging.
Entrepreneur,3e0cfr,2waterbottlez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:52:36 2015 UTC,"You've said you're passion is gone, but surely if it's worth buying you can still make money off of it.  If it's going to be a hassle to run and operate, but still be profitable, then this might be a good opportunity to make a good business connection.  You sound certain that it is worth selling because the market you are reliant upon will prove itself in the coming months.  You also have a decent amount of product already purchased.  Your options are basically 1. Get lucky and sell the business now 2. Sell the product now or 3. Hang onto the business but hire someone else to deal with the hassle.  A big part of turning over small businesses quickly is to know when to hold 'em and know when to fold 'em.  If you are CERTAIN about the profit, you may want to hang onto it, but hire someone to run it day to day.  If it's worth buying, it's almost certainly worth keeping (if done right).    If you do decide to do this, be good to the 1-2 employees you take on, but be very cautious when ordering new product.  30k in pocket after 5 months is solid for a kiosk, and if you can net that again before January then I personally think it's totally worth it to let someone else run it.  You already put down the capital, you own the means of profit.    You don't want to overextend, but if you are truly choosing choice #2 now (assuming #1 doesn't land), then you have to weigh the profit you'll make from A. Selling inventory now vs. B. Expected profit through the holidays minus paying someone to run it.  Point is, if it's valuable to someone else to come in brand new and try to turn a profit, you might be able to cut that same person, or a similar one, in and just let them do the work while you take in the owner's fee.    Good luck to you, and if you're selling spatulas with sports team's logos on them, then extra good luck to you."
Entrepreneur,3e0cfr,doogie88,0,Tue Jul 21 05:01:35 2015 UTC,"Without knowing what you're selling it's hard to give you advice. But from what you said, there's one more cycle in your ""fad product"" so here's what I would do.   Close the kiosk and put the inventory in your garage. Assuming you will still have your business license come fall or whenever your sales are the highest (or just renew) go to local farmer's market where you can rent a tent for cheap and blow up your social media letting everyone know where you're at.  Sell whatever you can over the course of 2 months. Take your 12k of inventory and sell it for 20k (you said you sell it for double your cost so this is including possibly renewing your license and any farmers market fees)   Seems pretty straight forward to me.  If you expect someone to come in and pay 50k for your business you need to rethink reality unless you're completely wrong on this ""fad"" dying out.  Without knowing what it is its hard to say but I'd have to guess it's a ""clip on top knot for men"", if so just burn what you have."

Entrepreneur,3e3l9r,PenIslandTours,2,Tue Jul 21 18:15:55 2015 UTC,"Kickstarter is best for leveraging traffic on but having said that it really does depend on your niche as well. So here are the breakdown of 5 top crowdfunding sites and the benefits and limitations of each.       Kickstarter  In a sentence: Kickstarter has become synonymous for crowdfunding, as the most popular site to find funding for creative projects.  Cost: 5% of funds raised, with an all-or-nothing model that builds urgency but leads to the loss of all funds if the goal isn’t met, plus 3-5% transaction fees  Pros: Name recognition, highest site traffic allows for greater project visibility  Limitations: approval process, limited to creative projects, only allows projects based in the US and UK      Indiegogo  In a sentence: This flexible crowd-funding site serves as an open and accessible option for campaigns worldwide.  Cost: On the all-or-nothing plan, 4% of the funds of successful projects go to Indiegogo. On the flexible funding plan, Indiegogo charges 4% if you reach your goal, 9% if you do not reach your goal. Transaction fees are an additional 3%.  Pros: No application process, available in every country, diverse spread of projects  Limitations: More expensive if you don’t reach your goal, but without the urgency of the all-or-nothing plan      RocketHub  In a sentence: This crowdfunding website offers a unique type of visibility through a recent partnership with A&E Project Start Up.  Cost: 4% for completed campaign or 8% for partial campaign, with 4% transaction fees.  Pros: Easy to navigate interface, Success School offers tools for building better projects and businesses  Limitations: Step down in terms of traffic from Kickstarter and Indiegogo      FundRazr  In a sentence: This website is dedicated to raising money for anything from personal causes to nonprofits to entrepreneurial projects.  Cost: 5% for completed or incomplete campaign plus 2.2% +$.030 transaction fees  Pros: Deep social network integration to connect to people in your network, cheap and convenient transaction fees with funds going directly to your PayPal, can be used to fund anything, anywhere  Limitations: More difficult to connect with other entrepreneurers and investors, with less than 5% of projects falling into the category of entrepreneur/creative      GoGetFunding  In a sentence: This London based fund-raising site can be used to raise money for anything from paying for pet’s medical bills to creating a short film.  Cost: 3.5% with a keep-what-you-raised model, plus 2.9% transaction fee  Pros: Can be used for public or private projects, anyone can post a project, easy to use  Limitations: Fewer business/entrepreneurial projects"

Entrepreneur,3e2eyd,theconsequences,5,Tue Jul 21 12:58:51 2015 UTC,It depends on what you mean by savvy.  NYC rules financial tech and DC has top experts in government tech.  You are projecting a simple scale on what is more like a complex forest of different trees and interdependent creatures.
Entrepreneur,3e2eyd,m0llusk,3,Tue Jul 21 13:53:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is actually important.  Startup density doesn't imply savvy to me.  You can have a ton of startups in a city, that doesn't mean they're any good.  You have to look at where top talent flock to and that is largely industry specific."
Entrepreneur,3e2eyd,stcwhirled,4,Tue Jul 21 14:12:33 2015 UTC,"Every major city has a start up scene in the US. Some bigger than others of course.  The mothership is the bay area (silicone valley, south of San Francisco) . Nothing beats there and never will in terms of raw number of startups and culture (sorry Austin). The closest competetors are Seattle, LA, NY in no particular order.  The thing is, all of the top tech cities are retardedly expensive with shitty standards of living compared to elsewhere. People make a lot of money but can't afford houses, many live in little apartments with room mates even making six figures. It depends what you want from life. The value of ""startup culture"" and being around it is debatable at best.  Many companies are purposely avoiding the tech havens to cut costs. If you pick a city in the south or somewhere cheap, you will still be able to find talent, but your monthly overhead is a fraction, plus you can live really well while still making less."

We didn't get any sales from that though (yet).    We also left stacks of business cards at music stores, which disappeared quite fast. I think this helped get the word out about our company when we just started.    Other than that, business cards are handy to give out when someone needs your contact details, but not strictly necessary."
Entrepreneur,3e2dre,ms_sea_cat,2,Tue Jul 21 13:38:00 2015 UTC,"It really depends on your business.   When I started more than 12 years ago there were very important. It was part of your first impression and did not only serve to communicate your information, but also your values as a business.  However, as time passes they become less important. I have gone from needing 500 cards a year to 50. Mostly because it is now much easier to connect to people and to get their information online.  Keeping business cards have become even less important. Once you have their information on your phone and connect on social media, there is no need to keep the business card.  This guy might not agree."
Entrepreneur,3e2dre,consli,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:44:58 2015 UTC,"I do a lot of catering, and i don't do a single event that someone doesn't ask for my card so they can call me an event that they have coming up. I get a lot of work through referrals, and i have no idea how many of those come from people who took a card, but even if it is only one booking, it pays for the cards.  I also leave them on my counter at my retail shop and I have to refill the holder every couple of days. Lately, I've had an increase in people calling to ask when we close, or to put in a take out order. Again, I have no idea how many come from the cards, but it has to be some.  Also, we're in Orlando, so I'll bet some of those retail cards end up in scrapbooks, which doesn't help my business, but it's nice that we are considered a memorable part of their vacation.

Ties nicely in with them going to the web tool afterwards, now with a short pitch to create their elevator pitch from.  I'd say, if you're going to have business cards, consider adding a little usefulness to them other than just contact info."

You're going to need to learn a lot but it's possible.   If it's the latter head over to /r/learnprogramming and search for your question (don't ask it because it's definitely been asked before)
Entrepreneur,3e2qa8,lc929,2,Tue Jul 21 14:42:24 2015 UTC,"I would like to go with the latter, where should I start?   Would you suggest trying to learn what I can but in the mean time partnering with someone who would be able to start immediately."
Entrepreneur,3e2qa8,lc929,3,Tue Jul 21 14:52:06 2015 UTC,"I would say learn first! No need to give equity of your company already unless you're really set on pushing forward. That being said there are a lot of entrepreneurs who just hire people to code. However in my experience it's a great way to extend your skill set and looks really nice on your resume (in case the entrepreneurship doesn't go as planned)  Learning how to code is going to be a long journey and it will take years of patience persistence and hard work. I'll take you down the ""building a web app"" route because that's the one I took.   I would first dabble in html, CSS and JavaScript. These are the technologies related to what shows in a browser of a web application (aka front end). Think of them as the graphics and look and feels of a webpage.   Then I would also suggest learning a backend language. This is what powers the logic behind an application. I highly recommend Python, ruby, or PHP. these three come with frameworks: django, rails and laravel. I recommend Python + django for you since there are a ton of resources for learning it.   While learning the backend language learn object oriented principles and data structures. This will provide you the computer science background you need to actually build a scalable web app. If you just learn how to be a code monkey, it'll be hard to scale.   And then databases! To store information (user login, each page information) you need to hook up a database and interface it with MYSQL or postgres. do NOT just learn SQL. That is just some language with syntax. Learn database DESIGN.   Here is some notes I wrote up to get you started w html  http://code.snipcademy.com/tutorials/html  (I Built this site with PHP laravel)  You have a long exciting journey ahead of you. Good luck!"

In my two past transactions, I've sent questions to the broker, but he has then passed them on to the seller for the seller to answer (unless it was really basic stuff).    In other words, it might not be the broker who isn't responding, but the seller.  I'd give it another day or two to see what happens.  And, personally, if they aren't being responsive during the selling phase, you might want to ditch it altogether -- due diligence could be a nightmare."

Entrepreneur,3e3mjn,StudentofDuckworth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:50:55 2015 UTC,"there are two main bits to selling the domain: payment & domain transfer. I have bought/sold 100s of domains most person-person transactions I use escrow.com to handle the payment + confirm the transfer. this covers both parties. They can pay via wire, credit card, etc. fund push to you once the domain xfer is confirmed. Transferring the domain is quickest for both parties if the buyer uses the same registrar as you (Namecheap), This is called a""push"" and will happen the same day. If they were to want to transfer to Godaddy (or any other) it may just take a day or two.  You need to: 1. unlock domain 2. get ""authorization code"" (which will be a gibberish alpha/numeric string)  buyer needs to: 1. request the transfer 2. input the ""authorization code"" you provide  You'll often get an email saying ""do you want to deny this transfer"" typically you just ignore it and it goes."
Entrepreneur,3e3mjn,bugout_com,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:04:52 2015 UTC,"The easiest and quickest way would be to have your buyer open a free account at Namecheap. Then you can PUSH the domain from your account to his. This can be completed in 15 minutes.  Otherwise, if the buyer chooses a different registrar then you will have to do a domain transfer. Transfers usually take about 7 days to complete.  For payments, I usually use Paypal if the sales price is less than $500. Any amount greater, I use Escrow.com"
Entrepreneur,3e3mi8,AliveRat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:24:08 2015 UTC,Wholesale buyers are typically going to expect 50% off your retail; that's Keystone wholesale pricing.  You either need to raise your own retail to afford selling wholesale or not do wholesale at all.    A 50% margin isn't going to make you very happy in the long run so I'd highly suggest increasing your retail.  Wholesale is a huge part of my business and I operate on a pretty standard formula of:  Cost x 2.5 = wholesale price  Wholesale x 2 = retail  If your cost is $25 then you should technically be wholesaling at $50-62.50 and retailing at $100-125.  Right now you're definitely not priced to wholesale.

Entrepreneur,3e2y95,suchphil,2,Tue Jul 21 15:37:27 2015 UTC,Here are a few stats that show the value of blogging:    Companies that blog 15 or more times a month get 5x more traffic than companies who don’t blog. Small businesses see the biggest gains when they post more articles. Companies that increase blogging from 3-5x per month to 6-8x per month almost double their leads. An average company will see a 45% growth in traffic when increasing total blog articles from 11-20 to 21-50 articles. B2C companies see a 59% increase in traffic after growing total blog articles from 100 to 200 total. The average company with 100 or more total blog articles is more likely to experience continued lead growth. Companies with over 200 blog articles have more than 5x the leads than those with 10 or fewer.   The above are all excerpts from Hubspot’s Marketing Benchmarks from 7000 Businesses report.

So i paid for three of them despite the advice from others that it wouldn't work. The day they were delivered it was like BOOM! I had over 100 views within a few minutes. Then I starting looking into it using adsense. The traffic was more fake than the patties on Mcdonald's cheeseburgers. And these people had looooads of positive reviews! Over 9000 sales on Fiverr with top rated badges and everything.   How did I know it was fake?  Well first of all the people never left the homepage, which who clicks on a clothing site page (Over 1000 people) and never leave the homepage.  Second of all, the traffic came from the same 40 locations, pinging my server at random times throughout the day.   I took multiple screen shots and confronted the guy. He shot it down at first but once I submitted the screen shots, I immediately recieved a refund request from the seller.  You know why he submitted a refund request so fast? because on Fiverr those guys thought it would be a great idea to not allow people to submit reviews if you got a refund. So allllllll those positive reviews were apparently from people who don't know how to use google adsense to track traffic.   I tried 3 more sources that were highly rated on that site. All three were the same fake traffic that immediately led to refunds. So just be careful who you purchase from."

I remember the production being so horrible because you could hear trains and sirens go by, but I was riveted. Learned so much.   Like: people don't give a shit about my insecurities. They literally don't exist to them. People can be manipulated easily. You need to learn to spot attacks and defend against them. Projection of confidence becomes real confidence after a while. You can control your own thought patterns with repetition. Likability trumps all.   I doubt I would have ever read many ""legitimate"" self-help books if I hadn't first discovered ""The Game.""  I'll get the book you recommended immediately in an effort to un-murder myself. Thanks!"
Entrepreneur,3dx4sp,Ajegwu,3,Mon Jul 20 15:55:40 2015 UTC,What's the Black Ops podcasts exactly?
Entrepreneur,3dx4sp,yoshi105,4,Mon Jul 20 16:19:28 2015 UTC,"Some short lived low budget social engineering series a guy recorded. I barely remember any of it, but one was about how to be interesting in conversation, steer conversations, and keep track of conversation threads.   Edit: another that I remember is about versions of ourselves. Our home c Version, friends version, work version of your personality. It was all so obvious when I listened, but I had never consciously thought about cultivating them individually and purposefully. It would have seemed weird or dishonest or something. By not being myself. But we all do that anyway, so why not be good at it?"
Entrepreneur,3dx4sp,Ajegwu,2,Mon Jul 20 17:35:12 2015 UTC,"Sounds interesting! Definitely want to look further, any links you can point me towards? I don't know which one is the one you are referring to."

Entrepreneur,3dx4sp,Ajegwu,3,Mon Jul 20 17:48:42 2015 UTC,"Seems like such an odd concept to me though, like, going through all that trouble to get laid.  I get learning about stuff like that to recognize when others are doing it to you, but I fear I would lose a little humanity along the way.  Kind of like The Heart of Darkness.    I've known, and grew up around, successful people.  In my opinion you don't have to be psychologically manipulative to make $$."
Entrepreneur,3dx4sp,bcisme,3,Mon Jul 20 22:56:43 2015 UTC,"It can be extremely creepy and weird. The whole concept of negging your way into a girls pants and not knowing how to be nice to her in the morning is beyond bizarre.   But there are a lot of other universal things I just happened to learn there first. One example is the the value of strong introduction. No one believes you when you talk about yourself. ""I'm an awesome guy you should hang out with me!"" Doesn't work any better than ""I'm so good at real estate, you should be my client!""  But if you change that to someone else saying, ""My friend Bob here is a great guy! You should totally get to know him!"" or ""I'll transfer you to Michael, he has 15 years experience in this area!"" your odds are suddenly better.   One of those examples is from The Game, the book that put PUA on the map. The other is from Robert Cialdini, author of Influence.   This knowledge can be used ethically or not. Up to the weirder."

Entrepreneur,3dx4sp,fidelitypdx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:24:56 2015 UTC,"But that's it exactly. You grew up around successful people. The phrasings, mannerisms, topics of conversation... all totally, totally different from how some of us were raised. You were raised to think of success as not just attainable, but normal. Some of us have a longer walk to success, because we have to unlearn so many things that don't serve us.   No, you don't have to be psychologically manipulative to make money. But it definitely pays to be conscious of how we fine-tune our social selves so as to become more successful, in all ways."

Entrepreneur,3dx4sp,tractionvc,4,Mon Jul 20 16:19:44 2015 UTC,"First stop would be for you to take the google partner exam for adwords.  I'm on my phone but if I remember correctly, it's google.com/partners and then on the left, when you are subscribed, you can access the adwords exams.   They have all the material to learn and you can try the exam as much as you want. No joke, within 2 weeks you can pass 2 exams if you study enough. It's pretty easy and I find it's worth it.  I suggest you set up an adwords account so you have access to the interface while you study.

I hardly ever upvote, and with the exception to those previous replies It is very rare.  But I have read just about every comment and every word.  While I have started and failed multiple business's(got some winners as well) I am in the middle of building another which is on a serious uprise of improvement and aggressively gaining more sales each day,  I was stuck with making a major decision on where to take the business at this point.  After reading your story has inspired me and given me full confidence on what direction to take it.  I think its a great idea to leave everything as is open for people to take the information as it is.  Fuck the haters .. fuck em all.  If i listened to them too, I would not be where I am today.

Entrepreneur,3dx4sp,RankFoundry,14,Tue Jul 21 04:58:25 2015 UTC,"Hi Snipple,  I sent you a PM last night, but it might be helpful for more people to see to clear up ambiguities. Add me on Skype if you get the chance!  I was struggling to understand cash flow of the business, but this is what I think I see in the Broker Model: 3 People in Transaction: Franchisee (established business owner), Broker (us, the lead collector), Owner Operator (the lead)   Broker establishes relations with Franchisee, creates non-circumvent contract & other agreements. Covers Broker's hide and prevents from being cut-out. Broker collects leads and sells leads on being an owner/operator for Franchisee  Owner-operator pays $10-50k startup fee to [franchisee? or Broker? (this is not so clear to me)] Sign 1-year contract, broker collects monthly fee + ~20% of profits, franchisee collects ~40% of profits, owner-operator collects ~40% of profits. Cannot work with owner-operator outside of a renewed contract with the broker (correct?)   Finally, if you were to start with $5000 cash (which seems more realistic for a lot of us wantrepreneurs), what would you focus on first? Working with franchisees, or a different kind of service? I noticed your lawyer expenses weren't small, so I'm wondering if this is a good place to get started, especially with no experience."
Entrepreneur,3dx4sp,j2sun,8,Mon Jul 20 16:15:23 2015 UTC,"Wow, you worded it perfectly.  This is how I should have worded it.    1 - Correct. 2 - Yes. 3 - You can play with this, remember you're trying to make a long term return here.  Keep 10k for yourself, let the remaining go to the franchisee owner, this way it benefits them more and gives you more opportunities in the future. 4 - Doesn't have to be a year, can be for lifetime of store, 6 month, etc.. up to you.  fee + 20% for broker is high.  I would recommend a lower amount.  Operator making only 40% isn't good.  Let them make a big chunk.    I would probably try locally with something like plumbing or locksmiths.  Both have high demand, not hard to find these guys and then work out a deal with them for leads."
Entrepreneur,3dx4sp,RankFoundry,5,Mon Jul 20 16:47:00 2015 UTC,Can you explain the lawyer part a bit more? What costs do you think we're looking at to get a contract written up?  I have a knack for finding/hiring good people and this opportunity is appealing to me. I'm just not sure how/when I would bring a lawyer in and in what capacity.  Thanks!
Entrepreneur,3dx4sp,j2sun,5,Mon Jul 20 17:16:38 2015 UTC,"The lawyer part would be pretty simple.  It would be a contract between X and X for any lead or referrals.  Then under the financial terms you'll have a breakdown.  For example, 1 - $15 per lead, regardless of outcome 2 - If lead is closed, you get X % of sale. 3 - If you hit a x amount in quota you get another bonus.    Etc.. etc... be creative, watch shark tank."

Entrepreneur,3dx4sp,polite_alpha,9,Mon Jul 20 17:32:07 2015 UTC,"Two very basic questions:   For your lead method, how much capital would you need to attempt such a feat?  From my understanding of your previous and current post:   you connect a successfull business with want-to-be owners, using some ad-words and other tools. Using your supreme verbal skills & past experience, you set / determine the right people, get the contract In the previous post, I wasn't really sure how you actually do things. Can you do what you do with a capital of say, 1000$? With your 1st method? You obviously don't just connect, you set everything up (store itself)   To sum it up, how much would you need to do 1 trial run of this business model?"

Still curious, since I'm currently thinking of entering a established business, box subs. style, how much does it take to do your #1 method?    1)Get to know owner who wants to expand his business 2) generate leads through being wise, use tools 3) ?? Link B.owner + your lead, but not before signing a contract? 4) >>* perhaps step 3<< Rent/Lease a place, set it up for business for your Lead?    Can you skip this step and just make money off of leads through a contract? I expect the money generated this way is just a brokers fee basically...   I'm guessing a capital of €15-20k to furbish & lease out a place for the business...

Ask me if I care if anyone believes me or not. Wait, I'll save you the trouble: No, I don't.  I find it amazing that people would question that someone can make a paltry $50k a month running brick and mortars. I know a guy who was doing three times that for a couple of years running a froyo shop in a well trafficked area. People have no clue.  There's also a real hate towards anyone who is successful, probably from people who aren't doing shit with their lives and want to believe it's not their fault. When they see others succeed I guess they feel like they have to find a reason why it's not true or how they got a lucky break since otherwise, it puts the onus on them for not reaching their goals. Easier to blame others and pretend it's not your fault."

Bit of luck and timing was part of it as well. Honestly, I'm not sure if I could ever recreate that situation again. It was both very simple and very effective. It could have gone either way but it blew things up. In a sense, we went viral.  There was a bit more to it though, we knew the business model well. We knew were were offering something more enticing than the 800 lb gorilla in the industry. People were looking for alternatives and we gave them one.  Things really have to come together for something like this to work. We did nearly $2 million that first year at around a 50% margin.

Entrepreneur,3dx4sp,Sun-Shiney,6,Mon Jul 20 20:16:42 2015 UTC,"We had some knowledge about how this industry worked. We did our homework to understand how to set up the business model and how we thought we could make it more enticing than what the big guy was doing.   In doing this research, we found forums through Google where people discussed our soon to be competitors. We read first hand what they did and didn't like. We positioned our offerings to address what they didn't like about the other guys.  Once we launched, a very simple post along the lines of, ""Anyone tried out X yet? Just came across it and it looks legit."" was posted.  That set off a chain reaction. We did the same in a couple other forums.  We then contacted the owners of those forums, offering to do an AMA of sorts to answer the questions of their members. We did two interviews and pandered to what we thought they wanted based on our research.  Before we knew it, we were getting leads left and right.  We had no real credibility. I think we might have posted a few posts under those accounts before we mentioned ourselves.  After that, we established official accounts on those forums for our business and used those to answer questions and handle customer issues. That lasted a while until it became cumbersome but it really earned us early and critical credibility with people that we were there to discuss things openly in these forums.  Just to give some context, we started this business about 10-11 years ago."

Entrepreneur,3dx4sp,thales_reborn,8,Mon Jul 20 07:24:53 2015 UTC,"There are two businesses here.  I guess I have people confuse with both.  My original post was how to make tons of money generating leads and connecting them to franchise owners.  My retail locations ended up coming in the way.    1 - Let's say you find a franchise called Rita's Ice Cream. You find the local owner who happens to have 2/3/4 locations. 2 - You then create landing page for people searching for ""How do I get ritas franchise?""  The landing page is simple, collects data from the customer. 3 - You then talk to the owner, figure out a structure that best fits your needs.  maybe a flat referral fee? I would recommend a monthly residual, even if its a few %. 4 - Close the deal and move on.  People are saying its impossible to get to so many locations, it's not, it's like climbing a long set of stairs, one step at a time."
Entrepreneur,3dx4sp,nekonekoneko,8,Mon Jul 20 13:03:18 2015 UTC,"I understand the value-added service you are providing, but I'm a little hazy on the structure. What do all 3 parties typically end up owning? Does the guy who already owns 3 ritas open another one (all in his name) and then create an agreement that this new person who you found will operate the business for him? Then does he also make a contract with you for your service of finding the operator?   Or does the lead that you found end up owning the business? If so, what is the usual upside for the guy who already owns the 3 ritas?  As a final general question, is it common that franchise owners are looking to open new locations but have trouble finding the right people to run them? Or is this an idea that you usually have to sell to the franchise guy?  I love learning about new business models like this that aren't even on my radar. Thanks so much for taking the time to answer these questions :)"
Entrepreneur,3dx4sp,cheapclooney,4,Mon Jul 20 13:36:55 2015 UTC,"Yes for the first paragraph.    Lead ends up running the business, the old owner still has all the rights.  The upside for the old owner is growth expansion, more opportunities within the industry, a guaranteed residual with no headaches.  Etc..    Yes, this is extremely common.  Employees make you or break you.  In most cases, they just never run the store as if an owner would.  You can spot the owner when getting service in a store vs an employee.    We ensure in our contracts that the lead is required to work a minimum X amount of hours.  We're not looking for investors, theres a lot of them out there.  You don't need that, you need a good operator to run the business."

This might work with him as he is in expand mode.    The lead/prospect would need to have the funds to open the new store himself/herself for this to work.  The new owner would pay the Guns/Golf owner for use of the business name/brand ID and agree to maintain a similar identity, I assume. The new owner's payment to the Guns/Golf owner would also include a percentage of gross of net (which do you use) profit for say one year that would be the payment to me for connecting the two?    What happens in the event the new opening fails?  Or ramps up slowly as these things are likely to do?  Do I have the approach correct?"

To be honest, I got a mix of genuine interest, a lot of skeptics and a whole lot of cynics.   Skeptics are smart. They think clearly and can measure evidence, sniff out lies, etc. They use a process to discover the truth. Cynics think they're skeptics, but are unaware they're only evaluating claims based on gut feelings and strongly held beliefs.  They are ignorant of new information.  Skeptics are the ones that end up with optimized PPC campaigns.  The cynics can't do it if they act in accordance with the belief that the person who taught them about PPC was trying to fuck them over and PPC is a scam. You can only do it, well, scientifically.

Entrepreneur,3dx4sp,was_sup,5,Mon Jul 20 16:22:59 2015 UTC,"So everyone knows, here was his first post under this username before it was deleted and he pivoted focus to this.  ""You Need This! - Make any company, website, product or service go viral almost immediately. Please give me your feedback! Got you! I need your help in the best strategy that could possibly work for this. I've posted here before many years ago and got some decent feedback but have been really busy with my chain of retail stores across the nation. I've finally got some time put aside for this and really want to get started but need to see what are the best strategies to implement.  So what is it?  Basically, an advertising medium helping any company, product or services go viral through social media while at the same time having users engage with your product using their camera phones.  How does it work? We give out a task, for example, ""Write the word HEINZ using ketchup on a plate"" and then post a picture of it using your phone. There would be a timer countdown so no one would know what the task is till a certain time. Let's say every 3 hours, we're posting a task that requires the user to take a picture of the product/service/company in some way and then posting it either on facebook, twitter, reddit, etc..  But why would people play this? Simple, for money and prizes. I've seen how well giving out amazon e-gift cards work. I've tested it online before with another startup and it blew up really well. The game won't be fun if you have 100's or 1000's of people submitting pictures and then a random winner is selected. The task needs to be simple and easy enough for any one to participate in, the first person to submit the picture wins. Everyone would be waiting, refreshing the page on our site to see the task, it would be a fun activity to participate in and you'll never know what type of task you'll be up against along with insane prizes. We plan on starting with e-gift cards to amazon, best buy, target, etc. to get the site moving.  We've currently named it snipple, isnipple, and even snippin (paid 3k for that, I know what was i thinking.)  Here is a sample of a quick mockup - http://i.imgur.com/ePeueVt.jpg Another version - http://i.imgur.com/FMVWtI7.jpg And another - http://i.imgur.com/9VVnE60.jpg  So how do we monetize and make this work? There would be a small section advertisers can click on to ""Sponsor"" a product or ""Give away"" their own goods. Charging a fee down the line for product/business/website placement and for sponsoring the task for that session.  We're in a world of camera phones and getting 100's of 1000's of people to instantly take pictures of a business, website, product, etc.. and having them share those images in their social media and all over the internet will be a dream come true for any business.  How can this benefit a new startup? I recently saw a new startup I signed up with which offers all sorts of random snacks from around the world. This new startup needs to go viral for the business to start booming, they come to us and say, hey, we'd like to be the prize for your 6 PM task. Great, let's come up with an idea to engage customers with your site and have them take a picture using their camera phone to share on social media.  Customer goes on site, sees a countdown for 6 PM, right at 6 PM see's task that say's, ""Take a picture of yourself holding a candy bar with the following website open in the background either on your computer, tablet, or phone - www.CandyWorldSubscription.com""  BAM! Website gets viral hits - customers get to know about the company, social media creates a buzz as we can have them submit the photos with a hashtag on twitter, or facebook.  This concept can work for literally any kind of business. Even a movie or a tv show, imagine a task involving taking a picture of a poster at a local movie theater. The possibilities are endless.  Now, the tough questions. For any idea or suggestion that gets up voted high enough with a reasonable answer, I will compensate you via paypal for your help and time.  1 - Biggest question is, where do users post the pictures? We can keep it on reddit and start off from there but eventually I'd like to use instagram, twtitter, facebook. Should we start off with reddit for a few months and then eventually roll out other social media platforms?  2 - The site would be 100% funded in the beginning by me, I am ready to spend a lot of money on giving away prizes to get the game going for the first few months until companies are interested in utilizing us. Should I have a sign up process and collect data from customers or should I just keep it simple with no sign ups of any kind?  3 - Snipple / snippin a good name? I think i need a verb. More like snap a task or something of that sort.  4 - We've created an app for iOS and Android already for this, but I've had someone very successful within the startup industry tell me that I should just keep it on a simple website that any one can load. No reason for an app. The site simply displays a timer for next countdown and then displays the task.  5 - Should we keep the prize hidden till the winner is selected? This way there is always a surprise and the winner will be publicly announced along with the prize they've won on the site till the next countdown completes. This way user participation is high and not cherry picked.  Thanks in advance!"""

Then, I turned around and started offering those same customers to some other people who want to ""run their own business"" in exchange for a portion of the sales.  So far, I'd have to say it's working. I also entirely agree with the owner/operator model. Employees are too much of a headache. I'd rather work with people who want to succeed.  I might have to start looking into adwords again, spending a few bucks to get some already interested people sounds easier than finding them myself."

Entrepreneur,3dx4sp,LurkerBurker,2,Mon Jul 20 18:25:18 2015 UTC,Can someone help me understand this? So there are two owners but owner A owns 20 % and owner B owns80% but owner B runs the business... So you are the middle man making this contract happen?
Entrepreneur,3dx4sp,LurkerBurker,2,Mon Jul 20 18:43:48 2015 UTC,"There are 3 people involved: The owner, the broker, and the owner operator (the lead).  Let's say the owner has 5 shoe stores. It's too much work to manage all the shoe stores. An easy solution would be to let someone else run one of his stores. You (the broker) tell him you will find him a person to run one of his stores (the lead). You take a small cut for finding the lead (op suggested 2% - 5% profit). The owner probably gets around 15% - 20% profit. And the owner operator (the lead) get's the rest."
Entrepreneur,3dx4sp,MyronGainzyzz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:10:10 2015 UTC,"Ok makes sense thanks.  One more question , in this business model does the owner of the 5 shoe stores open a new store and let the new owner operate it  it, or does he let one of his existing stores be managed by the new operator. Also if the owner of the shoe store opens a new store does he pay to open it or do both owner pitch in to open it."
Entrepreneur,3dx4sp,MyronGainzyzz,2,Mon Jul 20 22:21:45 2015 UTC,"In most cases the owner probably does this with one of his existing stores. If the owner wanted to open a new store and do this, then he would pay for everything just like he did with the existing stores."

By gaining domain experience, contacts, and name recognition in a specific field, and really knowing a space from the inside out, that itself generates ideas for productivity enhancements that become the basis for a company.   If you know nothing, are an expert in nothing, and have no domain experience in anything, it is nearly impossible to generate the kind of ideas that will generate lasting income and wealth.   My suggestion: become an expert in something, hopefully something emerging and cutting edge. When I was in my 30's, I jumped on the internet graphics industry which was just developing (this is mid to late 90's). During my 30's and 40's I become one of the leading experts in this field, built a name for myself by writing articles and speaking around the world.

Entrepreneur,3dz2zt,dirtcheapstartup,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:46:52 2015 UTC,"Quick question.. If I have a UI/UX guy mockup some screens... what's the difference between taking those psd files from html to php..  As it relates to time and cost.  I know it's hard to tell with that general info, but it's only a few screens, nothing super heavy.  An account screen, a social share screen and accessing a feed of content.... that's it."
Entrepreneur,3dz2zt,Treeasaurusrex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:36:38 2015 UTC,"HTML is a Markup Language. It describes content and it's attributes - this is a h1 heading, this is an image, this is a block of text in italics etc.. It doesn't actually do anything, it's just provides a visual/meta description of the page's content.   PHP on the other hand is a Programming Language. You can use it to take data (from a database, a web form, a 3rd party service) and manipulate it - you can create/read/update/delete information, multiply/divide/subtract numbers together, sort your cat pictures by background sofa colour - anything you like.   It'd take ~5 minutes to take a screenshot of the Google homepage and then write it out in HTML. Doesn't mean it'll return any search results though.   The pages your asking might seem quite simple to you, but they could potentially be quite involved.   An account screen - this assumes that you're collecting and storing user data. Skipping over any local legal ramifications to doing that (which you may or may not already be aware of), your going to need a log in page, log out functionality, password resetting capabilities (so email infrastructure too). You'll need to protect your internal pages so you'll want to validate access rights before loading any privileged content.  This is all surplus to your spec, but it's required.   Social share screen - You'll be wanting to hook your system into the social networks you want to leverage. This can be anything from copy/pasting some code into a file to getting knee deep into OAuth token exchanges.   'Accessing a feed of content'.  This tells me you're wanting to curate content, so you'll be wanting a content management system (saving content, archiving, ordering, categorising etc). If it's an external feed, how are you going handle fetching the data? On-demand or via a scheduled service, either way that's not something you can do purely in HTML/CSS. You'll be wanting to cache (store) your responses in a database so you don't have to have your users wait for fresh data for each request. If you're live updating, you may want to implement some kind of websockets/Ajax polling functionality too.   Hopefully you've got the idea that there's actually a whole lot more stuff going on than you might have initially thought. Helpfully, most programming languages have 'libraries' of code that developers can drop straight in to a project to provide this functionality quickly or, if you're using an off the shelf system, it may be provided internally instead but either way, you need to sit down and think about how you want your site to operate.   If you hire a developer on the basis of 'it's only a couple of screens' you're in for a world of pain and anguish. Projects like these need to have clear expectations set before anything happens, or they end being extremely frustrating for both sides.  You need to take those screens and talk through each element with the developer. What you should be looking to come out with is a set of 'user stories' - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story - which describe the functionality of your site. 'As a customer, I should be able to log in from the homepage and be redirected to view my feed' or 'As a guest user, I should be able to view the feed and shares but not be able to share the content myself ' - this describes what tasks you want to accomplish, but not how specifically it's done.  Realistically this should be done before you even start talking to the UI guy - it's not uncommon for people to show up with shiny finished designs, and then either have them butchered into a cluttered mess or just straight thrown out of the window because they're missing critical functionality or that specific features just aren't feasible."

The people who brought them loved them but it seemed that people wasn't really interested in them. We haven't sold one hoodie on our online store but we were lucky to make back what we lost through amazon.  Basically, we wont be re-making our hoodies once they are sold out and we only have a few pieces left. The cost to build them was about £11.00 and we ended up selling them for £18 to make cut our losses. We have them designed and our factory knows exactly what we want so when the time is right we will re-release them!

Entrepreneur,3dz2zt,Bennyhana5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:37:13 2015 UTC,"I would recommend Inkscape for your logo problem. Free software that is like adobe illustrator jr. I use it all the time for logos and designs.   Shipping costs would only possibly go down if you ship in bulk. As in you ship 10 orders at a time. However, I'm not even sure about that. I would start by passing the cost on to your consumer, but monitoring it. Use a tool to see how many people (if any) abandon their orders in the final stages (as in, they see the shipping cost) and if it becomes a problem, eat some of the cost yourself or raise the price from $20 to $25  Usually you get a label printer or something of that nature. Basically they just make your life easier when you are shipping out a bunch of items. It can print out your return address as well as the customers address so you can just stick the labels on to the packages instead of writing the addresses."

I am building the entire branding, marketing, traffic (etc.) plans from the ground up. Would love to hear your general feedback on the site and what I am positioning as my competitive advantage.   That is: The way retailers work currently is they sell an individual product and they make customers shop by product, but this isn't how the new age of consumers are buying. They don't say ""I need a dog leash"" or ""I need an automatic pet feeder"" The new age of customers shop by saying ""I want to stop my dog from pulling too much during walks"" or ""What are some easier ways to live in the city with a dog"" That's how this site is set up to allow them to browse.

Entrepreneur,3e1qm5,austrie,4,Tue Jul 21 07:50:32 2015 UTC,For the type of product you're selling I would recommend reaching out to well established instagram accounts with a lot of followers and offer them either free merchandise or money if they'll upload a picture of themselves posing with your jewellery on and tag your instagram account.  This way you'll get targeting advertising and exposure for your product while also building your social media account at the same time.
Entrepreneur,3e1qm5,DaveShredder,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:07:51 2015 UTC,"In my experience, this would be my suggestion as well.  You could pay between $10-$100 for a highly targeted posts to hundreds of thousands of followers via instagram.  This is how you should generate your leads and it's a great way to do so.  I'm actually doing this myself and have great results.  If I were you, I'd focus on brand identity more.  Your brand needs some kind of differentiating factor.  Copy sites like Nastygal, Gypsum Style, etc.. as far as web layout / content goes, because we know those bring in fantastic sales, then put your own twist on it to make it unique."
Entrepreneur,3e1qm5,kurtburtwert,5,Tue Jul 21 14:18:49 2015 UTC,"HI Austrie, I've been in the digital marketing game since dial up connections and its amazing how times are changing rapidly. Yes social media marketing is some what of a buzz word now days so the old sign up for a facebook, twitter and instagram is the norm. But one of the most important lessons of marketing you got to realise is to follow where your target markets attention is. You see Instagram was great for marketing several years ago until marketers jumped on the wagon and spammed the hell out of it! That's not to say it doesn't work I'm saying you have to move on with the times and not just follow typical social media tricks you find online.  in 2015, content is king. If you want to be different start a content marketing campaign where by you give some of your best blog post or video posts for free to a consumer, the clever trick here is you set up a little retargeting pixel using Facebook and Google so once they visit that content you retarget them to a landing page to get a lead and then you send them through an auto responder series that slowly builds up a relationship with a prospect.   You see many businsses forget that we're not selling to B2C or B2B, NO we're selling to Human to Human. Look at it this way, would you walk up to a girl and ask them to marry you? NO of course you wouldn't but that's what 99% of businesses are doing! they are literally screaming marry me! marry me! marry me! to their potential prospects. So start thinking differently to the 99% of other ecommerce sites out their and actually start building a genuine human to human connection with people and before you know it you will have a raving fans that will buy from you non stop!  Marketing is all about values."

I haven't fully read your About story, but it seems interesting and genuine.  Looking at the products, I have trouble to know how they are different from all the other products out there. You are basically saying that you are using a top quality cotton for your clothes, just like elite brands. So, what makes you different from elite brands?"
Entrepreneur,3e1e9d,gresquare,2,Tue Jul 21 07:38:43 2015 UTC,"This was one of our main issues, trying to show the customer very high quality clothing without seeing it or touching it. The one unique property our clothing (mainly t shirt) has is unparallelled softness which we kind of go over in the about us page. The elite brands charge around £40-£90 for a Plain sueded cotton t shirt of our quality which is justified in their opinion because they sell their clothing to a specific category of persons. They also have physical stores, employees, million dollar advertising etc so the sale price of their clothing is rocketed to fund all of the extras. (we go over this too in the about page)."
Entrepreneur,3e1e9d,Caramelpaper,2,Tue Jul 21 11:53:58 2015 UTC,"Love your website, looks really great! I would add a small feature where you can hover your cursor over the thumbnail and it changes to the model wearing the shirt. Have you thought of maybe making the main product photos into the ones with the model rather than have it lay flat? I know in retail, many argue those with the model is slightly more appealing but I can see with the aesthetic you are going with. I also would put a glimpse of your story on the front page so your customers can see both your product and what you stand for."

I'm going to do something that works great with my clients, instead of answering your question for you. I'm going to extract the information from your mind by making you looking at marketing from a different angle.   You see many businsses forget that we're not selling to B2C or B2B. NO we're actually selling to Human to Human. Understanding this will shift your marketing efforts instantly.   Look at it this way, would you walk up to a girl and ask them to marry you? NO of course you wouldn't but that's what 99% of businesses are doing! they are literally screaming marry me! marry me! marry me! to their potential prospects. So instead of screaming marry me to your prospects, treat them like a human being. For example, a girl at a bar, you would approach her, chat her up (BLOGS), get her number and text her (e-mail auto responder series), invite her out for coffee (Low Value Offer Sale), Invite her back to your house (high value sale), ask her to be your girlfriend (upsell) and then get married. It's a crazy way of looking at marketing but this angle have allowed me to 4X a business that I'm currently working with.   So start thinking differently to the 99% of other ecommerce sites out their and actually start building a genuine human to human connection with people and before you know it you will have a raving fans that will buy from you non stop!   I know there are no actual tactics here but I truly believe you know what your doing but you just need to shift your thinking in how your going about your current marketing activities.

Entrepreneur,3e0ha8,Ghox,2,Tue Jul 21 04:34:52 2015 UTC,"1) the pop up being triggered while I'm reading your copy is annoying. I'm trying to read what you're selling, why interrupt that process? I know of another site that tested whether people would abandon the site due to a pop up email capture and it didn't have an effect either way. Maybe you can test this too.  2) seems like your targeting the same crowd as appsumo.com. This is a good thing. I haven't seen another company do anything like them.  3) there should be an arrow or some sort of visual cue next to the count down timer letting people know there's text to be read below.  4) because of the background colour your bolded text doesn't stand out as much as it should.  5) try placing your credibility factors ('what people are saying') way, way up. it's no good right at the bottom.  6) your CTA language and copy language in general is good. like others said, a lot of sites are selling courses at a discounted rate so it's good you stick out through your copy language. remember, you're selling to people just like yourself (assuming you are the same as your target market). it's okay to talk to them as if you're a friend. look at appsumo.com 's copy. notice how zany it is while still getting their points across.  7) your 'Who should buy this course?' copy is weak. you're making the customer feel like you're targeting them specifically by saying who the course is for, which is good. but also include who the course isn't for. since it sounds like you know who you're target market is, this should be easy to do.  also, include more 'you'. take out language like 'anyone looking...'.   make it personal. when I'm reading I want to feel like I'm being spoken to one-on-one, like this product is for me and only me, i don't care about anyone else getting it. the rest of the copy is good but you lost me towards the end."
Entrepreneur,3e0ha8,ravster02,2,Tue Jul 21 12:04:38 2015 UTC,"The idea makes sense but that service does not appeal to me for 2 reasons:   I don't know who the author is of the course, so I don't know how you justify the price (nor the discount). I immediately thought it could be a case of fake inflation - the course was always worth $99 but you're trying to convince me somewhere it was worth $247 and now I'm getting a great deal. How can I know it's a great deal if I don't know how credible the course is? I'm not convinced that the other courses will be worth it because I have no idea what else you could be offering."
Entrepreneur,3e0ha8,acconrad,2,Tue Jul 21 03:23:32 2015 UTC,"I agree. There needs to be a reason why I want to buy it (benefits), who is it by, and enough content prior to buying to show me I'm going to get my value for money.

It is real easy on the eyes. The animated background when the page load, might alienate some of your visitors with slower download speeds.  2) Your writing is nice as if I am talking to a friend. However, there is too much info all at once, a real turnoff. At first glance, I am looking for what the course is about, and maybe who it is for. If I'm interested, I will look for more info. Maybe try putting the ""about you"" info and the customer reviews on another page.  3) once again you have a very fluid writing style, very nice. . . Change the ""Hell yes"" and ""Nahhh"" to something more formal.  Just my 2 cents, with the hopes that you make a little bit of change. best of luck!!"

Entrepreneur,3dxtaw,localfisherman,21,Mon Jul 20 12:31:18 2015 UTC,Outdoor movies in the park. This group of college guys created  date night movie events that they show old black and white (i'm guessing license free movies) at the baseball park on the greens. They charge $5 a pop and they even have the local food trucks come out to the parking lot.   It's stays pretty packed I've seen close to 75-80 couples their one night.   I assume the main expenses were equipment. I know it only cost $25 to rent the park from the town for events.

They also could have tried to sell on Ebay or Craigslist. Many huge companies like Nike are completely fine and happy when you sell their products online. However they have guidelines and need to protect their brand. The shop I am talking aboutis of the size of a living room and has 160k followers on facebook, while the town only has 60k population.

Entrepreneur,3dxtaw,SantiagoAndDunbar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:24:33 2015 UTC,"I know many online stores that sell them, so I don't think that is a problem. But big brands need to protect their image and have some rules about it, which seems fair. You do not want someone spam the market with your brand new collection for 50 cent above the purchase prize, instead of a proper retail prize. I know that Weber, the grill manufacturer, demands a physical store when you want to sell their product online, at least in Germany.

Obviously it's a super saturated market but if the product is as fantastic as you say it is, then you shouldn't have any problem. Buy wholesale, start small, then go from there..."
Entrepreneur,3dzy81,perksofbeingjamie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:14:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I don't know anything about women's shoes. But my wife spends a couple of grand a year on them - half her budget goes to Jimmy Choo  and Louboutin and the other half goes to this lady. She says she ends up wearing them very often because they are very good looking.  I've contacted them for private label rights, with the possibility to go exclusive if it works well, I'm currently doing some market research AND trying to figure out how to get the shipping done inexpensively and efficiently... I contacted DHL and USPS and they quoted me $80 for shipping to CONUS from Romania for a 1kg shoe box... (no discount for volume discussed, but how low could they go at the beginning?)"
Entrepreneur,3dzy81,perksofbeingjamie,2,Mon Jul 20 22:23:42 2015 UTC,She sounds like the expert so I think there's something there.   I wouldn't worry too much about your costs at first. Try to buy 3-5 pairs at wholesale as a 'test' and then sell them - then go from there

Entrepreneur,3dzy81,Caramelpaper,2,Mon Jul 20 23:08:19 2015 UTC,"I work in online marketing for a independent retailer of high-end, brand name, womens footwear (we have hard to find sizes as a significant niche). Been in the industry for almost 15 years, so your idea caught my attention.    I'd say incorporating the shipping into the price of the shoe and shipping directly to customers in the US yourself, rather than dealing with the hassle of every single order you take being shipped individually from overseas (unless you are envisioning this as basically a drop-ship vehicle for the Romanian store itself). Obviously that means your initial investment would be much larger, having to buy inventory. But considering that in high end footwear, for online purchases, you can expect a return rate of 30% or so, that would be a lot of back and forth shipping internationally.   Lots to consider, but it is a very exciting idea!"
Entrepreneur,3dzy81,TotesMessenger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:12:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply and letting me pick your brain.  That's my plan - include the shipping in the price. I'll probably find something cheaper, but probably not less then half. 30% return rate sounds amazingly high...  The second step of my plan is to do this like you said - buying an inventory and shipping from the US - but only if it gains some traction.  I have an extra question - how would you proceed with setting the total price?"
Entrepreneur,3dzy81,alexherrera22,2,Tue Jul 21 05:27:11 2015 UTC,"Ouch 1 kg for $80 is crazy expensive, That is $80 for one to two pairs of shoes. Good luck on shipping, you might need to look into a forwarder."

In the rare scenario that they did, they would go straight to Amazon and order it for $5 with free shipping. Novelty items like this are not sustainable. If you want to spend that $100 wisely, put it in the bank. When school starts again in the fall, you can buy a ton of really cheap novelty items and sell to your classmates. Keep the costs low and you can keep the price higher to at least make some money. Making a website is certainly not a good choice, as it would cost too much for your margins."
Entrepreneur,3e0z0w,limes_huh,-8,Tue Jul 21 03:21:37 2015 UTC,"...The idea, in my opinion is great. People could use it for pranks on their friends. There are literally endless fun activities to do with this product. Sure there are not alot of people interested yet, I'm sure if you got the word out, on social media it would do great. Reddit, Facebook, twitter... I can already see this as being a hit. However, I may be dreaming. I realise starting this kind of novelty business up is hard. However, if maintained properly and marketed the right way i'm sure I could make something out of it. The point I want to make a website is because I want experince, thats all. Anyway yeah, thanks for the helpful tips. I will try to see if I can increase my budget somehow. I will try to keep the price high. How much do you recommend people would buy a realistic iphone for?   Edit: I could try and convince some you tubers to use one of my products for a prank video. Someone with 10k-50k subs?"
Entrepreneur,3e0z0w,wardetbestanee,7,Tue Jul 21 03:27:26 2015 UTC,"Salams & Eid Mubarak.  You really should take u/limes_huh's advice.   It's NOT a good idea. There's no reason to purchase from you when you can get it mad cheap direct from china via ebay. The advice to start with content rathere than ecommerce is great too! Why not blog about pranks and make your own youtube channel all about it? You seem really interested...how about videos/blog posts about prank props you can make yourself and review? you can go wild with it and host it all on your very own website. Maybe get some affiliate links from amazon, etc.?   Marketing ideas don't make a business..."
Entrepreneur,3e0z0w,limes_huh,5,Tue Jul 21 04:28:27 2015 UTC,"It is great that you want to start a site for experience... I highly recommend that. However, I recommend that you start a site with content rather than ecommerce. Write a blog about something you are interested in. Gather a following. People are more interested in stories and knowledge than cheap novelties made in China. If you make a site that is content only, you will only have to pay about $20, as there is no merchandise to purchase. With the remaining $80 you can either hire a professional writer (freelancer.com, freelance.com) or pay for advertising. You will learn so much about web development and marketing that even if you don't make any money, it will be worth it. If you end up gaining a following, it would be very easy to start displaying advertisements and brining in money, or becoming an affiliate salesman through Amazon to sell a product specific to your blog. If you really want to sell the dummy iPhone, go ahead. You will still gain the experience of starting a website and buying wholesale, but there is also a high possibility of gaining the experience of failure. $100 can hurt to see go down the drain. As for convincing youtubers, it takes money for that as well.  If I have come off as rude at all, I would like to apologize. I am trying to warn you and advise you to spend your money in a way you won't regret. When I was your age, I spent $950 on t-shirts that light up to music. I made $250 and was stuck with a closet full of t-shirts nobody wanted. Don't make the same mistake."
Entrepreneur,3e0z0w,Bagrant1,2,Tue Jul 21 03:38:30 2015 UTC,I'm sorry man but I don't think this is a very good idea. I agree with the first poster. Ot you can save it for later.
Entrepreneur,3e0z0w,cil0n,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:41:00 2015 UTC,Anything has potential as long as you have the capital.  Unfortunately you do not have the funding to make this a viral novelty.
Entrepreneur,3e0z0w,SUCCESSINSIDER,2,Tue Jul 21 05:01:38 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the points made here. You certainly could make a profit with these dummy iphones but it wont be a large business.  Here's what I suggest, being 15 years old means your probably going to school, so instead of listing your iphones for sale online where price is king especially with these items that are available on a mass scale.  Sell the dummy phone face to face to class mates and people offline. As the convinience of having something to purchase right away means you can sell them for $10. So what I would do is keep on selling them till you reach at least 1000$ and then start brainstorming some serious website ideas. If your looking to have this idea purely on a website, yes like others have said it's not going to do very well.  Best of luck! it's incredible to see such a drive in someone so young. You really remind me of me, when I was first starting out."
Entrepreneur,3e0z0w,acconrad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:03:26 2015 UTC,So build the site and put up analytics to see if people will click the button to buy a $30 fake iphone. Run an adwords campaign on fake iphones and see if people come to the site and try to buy your product. If you get a few takers you've got yourself a good idea!
Entrepreneur,3e0z0w,ahizzy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:38:53 2015 UTC,"These sorts of things are sold very cheaply on amazon and it's tough to compete with a giant like that to say the least.

You can't patent an idea. You can patent a particular machine, or mechanism, or algorithm, but not an idea.    Any one of those can potentially somehow get more recognition than the initial one, whether its image or word of mouth.    Of course they can.

Entrepreneur,3e12sv,imthepotionseller,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:49:48 2015 UTC,"Hi there, in order to generate an e-mail list. You must start thinking view somebody's e-mail as a form of value. Once you realise people only give their e-mail address in exchange for another form of value you will begin thinking up of great ideas. Here's what I suggest, create what I like to call a Lead Magnet. A lead magnet is a form of giving away something for free usually a (Report, short eBook, video, audio) in return for their e-mail address. The importance of the lead magnet is for it to be immediately consumable as the benefits of this is, if the prospect sees huge amount of value from their lead magnet they will come back to see what else you have in offer so ensure that your lead magnet is of high quality. This is critical.   As your first e-mail client I suggest a free one called Mailchimp, it's great for people starting out. In regards to frequency of send it all depends on your industry but just remember, it's all about value. If you are simply spamming somebody's e-mail box with something there not interested in they will unsubscribe straight away.   If you have any more questions fire away!"

I find the best giveaways are things that people won't buy themselves but love getting for birthdays/xmas  Finally you need a plan..  What are you buiding the list for? How are you going to monetize it?  I've lost count of the people i've met who built lists but have nothing to sell the list.  So step 1.. complete this sentence  I want a list because............

The thing lawyers and accountants don't get is that to make any business successful, you have to take calculated risks.  Sometimes they pay off, sometimes they bite you in the ass.  That said, you simply won't have the resources (money or time) to do everything you should do.  Do you always buy the extended warranty when you buy a car or big TV? What about a phone?  How much auto coverage do you have, just 50,000? Not 100,000?  The list goes on and on.  Yes, there's a chance there won't stand up in court.

These small businesses require little thought, offer a lot of value, and aren't big cash hogs.    If this is where your heart is, develop a full business plan for yourself and a proforma invoice, and go with it."
Entrepreneur,3e0v6v,FoundersAreGreat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:43:45 2015 UTC,"I own an ice cream business that also does a lot of catering, and when we first started out we did quite a few festivals. We hardly do any of them any more. Here's why:  1) Getting in - most festivals, fairs, carnivals, etc are already doing what you have, so they won't let you in. Even if your thing is very different from what they already have, you're out.   Also, when it comes to the big stuff like state fairs, they have very strong qualifiers to get in. You may get turned down and never know why.   It can take years to put together a tour of festivals that pays off.  2) Entry fees: some festivals are fairly cheap to get into, and you'll make money. Others are ridiculously expensive, especially for food. I've had people pitch weekend festivals for a couple thousand or more. I literally laugh at them. Someone very experienced told me they won't pay more than $200. They are very established, have a unique offering, and are very popular, so they'll just say ""Call us when you'll take $200,"" and they often get that call a week or two before the festival. I might go to $300 or so if it is something really good that I've done before and i know i can make money.  3) Weather: you are totally at the mercy of mother nature. It's going to be hot in the summer and you'll be in that heat all day with no relief. If it turns out to be a rainy weekend, you'll lose your entry fee and any chance of a profit.  4) Marketing: you are totally at the mercy of the festival's marketing. Of course they want to bring in a lot of people and make money off the tickets, but if they don't,  they still make money off your entry fee, so they're still happy even if you don't have any customers.  5) Location: they can put you wherever they want and you'll have to live (and die) with it. If you are new, and don't know the festival promoters, they are likely to give the prime space to their friends and stick you in the ghetto.  6) Competition: remember I said you might not get in if they already have your thing? Some don't care, amd will book anyone with the money. So now you are competing directly with someone else. Do they have a better location, price, product, booth, etc.?  7) Logistics: if you have a food business, you have to stock up in the morning and deal with cleaning stuff at night. Where will you clean your utensils? Where will you store your perishibles? Etc.   8) Lodging: where will you sleep at night? A motel? That's another $100 out of your profit unless you've got a trailer or a tent. Got employees? Another $100.  9) Down time: if you are doing this as a supplement to your regular income, understand that you are going to be giving up 2-4 weekends a month (if you are LUCKY), which means you will be working every day without a break. Instead of going home at night and resting, you'll be getting ready for next weekend, and on Friday, when everyone is heading for the bar to start the weekend, you'll be hopping in the vehicle to tow your trailer four hours to the next festival. Once you get there you'll have to get everything set up so you'll be ready to rock on Saturday morning, so expect to be working a long Saturday on about 4 hours sleep. Every. Single. Weekend.  10) The People: when you do fairs, you will be around carnies, and they are scummy people. Felons, sex offenders, etc., they are nasty people with nasty reputations which are well-earned. Literally the worst of the worst. You definitely don't want your kids, especially daughters, roaming around behind the scenes unsupervised. I personally knew someone who was raped once.   I still do a few festivals a year, those with reasonable entry fees that i have a good track record with, but every year i do fewer of them. My favorite one is indoors, so weather isn't a factor, and they do it in three different cities a year. The entry fee is around $450, but i make $1000 a day so it's worth it. I've done it several years in row, and they give me the same very visible placement, so now people expect to see me there."

I have also read some accounts of them not abiding by manufacturers' MAP policies, and this makes me reluctant to give up pricing control to Amazon, as aggressive discounting would undercut the margin of my other retailers, potentially jeopardizing my ability to maintain those sales channels and develop new ones.  Things have continued to go well since they first contacted me."

Us little guys need to watch our backs and hang on with a death grip to every bit of leverage that we can ...  That said, I am also grateful to have the Amazon Marketplace available to me. Nine months ago, as a new and unknown company selling a new, unique and unproven product, Amazon enabled me to list my product at very low cost, obtain impressions from millions of people in a relatively short period of time, sell a lot of Boot Butlers, and receive 121 customer reviews demonstrating that Boot Butler is arguably the best product of its kind (i.e. Boot Organizers). Without Amazon, it would be astronomically more difficult for someone in my position to achieve such success with a new product in such a short time. I am a firm believer that for a company like mine, Amazon is far more beneficial than otherwise. Also, the Fulfillment by Amazon service allows me to maintain inventory distributed throughout the country, enabling me to provide world class order fulfillment service and shipping lead times to my customers in a way that simply was not possible for a company the size of mine as recently as 5-10 years ago.  I have dealt with a couple of other very large retailers since I launched Boot butler, and none of them have been as reliable, equitable, professional, and forthright as Amazon."

The items will be centered around female beauty and hygiene products, as well as some makeup items here and there.   However, I'm having a hard time figuring out how to source enough of a variety of products to keep this business fresh on a month to month basis (and non repetitive). I have a list of items so far, but not nearly enough to keep this business model stable for a well over a year, or more.

You gotta keep up with the trends on instagram/pinterest etc. you will notice there's alot of repetitiveness even though the health and beauty market is huge. So you can have different product types and within those product types there's different brands and mix it up! I think you gotta start somewhere and build your customer base up and then after you got your customer base start hitting up more companies for samples or product. Just getting companies brand out there they start noticing and send you things (like I see how the more famous MUA gets sent products to promote). I like the idea of getting customers to give their feedback on products to build the customer base. Reviews are very important in the marketing world.

How required are they?  2) This sub is clear to avoid NDA before hiring a developer (makes sense) but once hired what sort of legal contracts are essential?  Do we need a lawyer to draft these or can we use common legal document templates from somewhere?    BONUS QUESTION: Could anyone share what it is like to develop a site from scratch? (doesn't use templates like wordpress or shopify?)
Entrepreneur,3dyauy,Sun-Shiney,0,Mon Jul 20 15:18:01 2015 UTC,"Good questions.  I wish all my prospects asked such questions.    I have the Adobe Master Collection; I use Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop to create wireframes and roughs.  But let's start at the beginning.  To build a site, one needs to know what is to be built.  It's akin to needing a home plan before it's constructed.  In some instances, a template works just fine, given a client's needs.  A discussion with them helps me know.     In other instances, a customized template will work -- one tweaks the underlying code.  Think buying a house that you will renovate.  And finally, there's the house you will construct on your lot.  If it's a custom home, it costs more as it's built from scratch, of course.    Now there's different types of 'from scratch.'   You can use Drupal core to build from scratch just about anything you would desire.  It's quite a different platform than WordPress.  The approach is different.     WordPress can also be used but, quite honestly, for me it depends on the features needed in the site.  Both tools have their place.  It's helpful to any front-end developer for you to know what you want to build.  If you lack the tools, grab Gimp, rough out your ideas there.   It's not just design you'll be thinking upon, it's also features.  What do you want the site to actually do?    Do you need to be precise?  No.  A good developer will look at your napkin sketches or digital roughs (Gimp, etc.) and ask you more questions.    Once both parties are clear as to what is to be built and who is providing what -- are you providing copy and photos, for example? -- then it's possible to determine the cost to build and time-frame.  My business enters into a contract with a client; I have contracts here that must be signed, with an up-front deposit.  Legally, one is required to transfer copyright, in writing.  Oral transfers are not protected under the law.  I transfer copyright upon full payment.  Until then, I retain admin control and copyright.    As far as what it's like, it requires skill that i don't believe you have, if that is what you are asking.  And the time you'll spend to learn is going to be considerable.   You'll need to know some php, css, html5, browser quirks and how to build for use across all of the devices.    I like using a framework in those instances.  Check out Bootstrap.  Learn Less.    I coded my first site decades ago, manually, using hand-coding in a vanilla editor with html.  I am still learning!  Things change constantly in this world.   NDAs... sure.  Reality is, though, that if someone is going to steal something, they'll steal it.  There's standard NDAs.  I think trust is far more important, though.  You're going to be working with someone who has the keys to your site..knows what is under the hood.  If you can't trust them, that's a bigger problem than the website development and your business concept."
Entrepreneur,3dyauy,Sun-Shiney,2,Mon Jul 20 17:16:01 2015 UTC,"PS.  One drawback for startups who want higher end websites is the cost factor.  My busin3ss now provides 12 month, no interest financing. You might want to bounce that off your developer to see if they can work that way with you.    Now back to rebuilding our business site as I've been too busy to deal with my own stuff. ..yikes, hmm?  Good luck!"
Entrepreneur,3dyauy,HumanCurious,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:17:57 2015 UTC,"Here are my takes:   Wireframes mean you know what you want on a conceptual level. That is: you know what buttons, images, links you want and where together with where they take the visitor. Put yourself in the visitors shoes and think: when I press this menu item, where do I go and how does that page look like? Overall, it's about the flow in your website and the interaction design. You have to know how big your website will be and where the visitor goes. Developers need this to be able to estimate how much time they need to develop the website as they mainly charge per hour. A non-technical person can do it, search for online wireframing applications and play with one. As you get into it, you'll see advantages and disadvantages.   No, it is not mandatory, but it will save you and your developer a lot of time if you think about them. Keep in mind: if you don't know what you want and you ask the developer to do more than agreed, they will charge you more. Don't make a project more expensive because you don't know what you want. Either communicate clearly or draw wireframes.      Depends on how you hire the developer. If you go on freelance sites like guru, elance and freelancer, they offer a standard contract which you can modify as you see fit. Depending on how much you're going to invest in your business, you should look into something when you're going to invest over 50k, imo.    Bonus: It's very difficult! You've got security, images, links, payment methods, payment gateways, accounts, databases and all other crazy things. Go with shopify if you can, try to move away from building from scratch. If you do, it will cost you 2-3 times more.   Let me know if you have other questions, I will try to answer."

When i was 15, my head was jammed soooo far up my ass....  The short answer is: it depends.  If you want to put it away and forget about it, best bet might be a Vanguard fund or other Exchange Traded Fund. Its an index of the whole Australian stock market, so there's no management to speak of.   ******Unwarranted Opinion Disclaimer******* That said, I think we're headed for a downturn in the next 12-18 months, and have pulled my money out of the market in anticipation. Do your reasearch ******Unwarranted Opinion Disclaimer*******  If you want to actually start something, that might be more interesting, but more time consuming and probably more stressful. What you do will be very individual - I suggest you don't waste your time with fads (Beanie babies anyone?), tempting though it may be.  You're at an age where your peers are starting to think about getting part time jobs etc - why not captialise on that? Your Dad seems supportive - why not enlist his help? Buy 4-5 lawnmowers (2nd hand) and some shirts and go door to door offering to mow lawns. Enlist your firends who want to earn some money to help mow lawns.  Make sure you charge more than it costs you, of course, and make sure you're paying people the correct amount for your age.   Worst case scenario, you sell the mowers and lose a few hundered dollars if it gets too much, or doesn't work. Best case scenario, you make some money, and get a good dose of relaity when you realise how unreliable your friends really are lol."

What's the purpose of the website? How will people get there?  It looks like you just grabbed a squarespace theme and added a bit of content. The hero pictures across the site, although pretty and in style these days, don't add any value and are honestly a bit confusing on some pages.  The ""Services"" page needs to be more clear, and I'd remove the content about the dog. Save that for the ""About us"" page if you must include it.  Finally, the ""Work"" page needs way more information. I'm not sure what it is you've done for these companies, looks like you've just set them up with squarespace sites. And since you're marketing as a ""collective"", even though you really aren't one, I was under the impression that maybe the companies listed were a part of the collective, not clients."
Entrepreneur,3dzlvw,sthrlnd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:15:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the honest feedback, that was what I was looking for. I agree on all points–I needed to get something out there that I could use for referrals. I kind of fell into this a few months ago, and work keeps flying in.  It basically is just a Squarespace theme with some javascript and custom CSS. I completely agree on the photos, they're pretty to look at, but beyond that they don't add much.  In terms of clarity for the services page, I'm probably going to break down each icon, make it clickable to some sort of anchored link to fill it out a bit more. Outlining a bit more of an ""approach"" section that will give an indication to what it's like to work with me.  For work, the common factor between all of them is that I did set them up with a site. They were looking for something easy to manage from their end, secure, mobile responsive, and on the less expensive end. That's a great point about the collective idea, that it conveys the idea that they're part of it. Some I've done logo design for, others copywriting and content, others photography–some all of that. I'm currently working through three more that diversify that a little bit. I'll reformat that into more of a ""This was the project"" and ""This was my role"". I think I'm nixing the whole ""Collective"" idea, driving more towards what /u/sthrlnd is talking about below.  Thanks again for the feedback."
Entrepreneur,3dzlvw,sthrlnd,2,Tue Jul 21 17:02:50 2015 UTC,"Yo! Congrats on the new site! A few things;   Home: I would suggest slowing down the background. It's super distracting, took me a couple seconds before I felt like I could comfortably read the text and even then my eyes were still wobbly. Also, slow is quite beautiful.  Home: You use the word 'digital' twice in two consecutive sentences. Maybs revise that copy slightly? (but thats probably just a personal pet peeve)   Services: your icons should ideally be the first section under the main image so that the question 'what do you offer?' is answered immediately.    Work: Really like the parallax and white text boxes. Looks great.   Lastly, and a point that might be held in contention - I don't fully believe it's a collective. There is 'we' in your language and your name obviously implies it but for some reason it feels like it's just you. I think it might be because you have only introduced yourself so there is no sense of any team.  Hope there's value in there for you! Goodluck!"
Entrepreneur,3dzlvw,sthrlnd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:39:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the great feedback. You're on point about the copy–definitely needs work. It's easy to write about someone else, incredibly hard when it's you.  The creative collective thing is a tough one. In a sense, you're right. Day-to-day, it's just me, but I have a pool of local subcontractors that fill in when needed. If it's something I can do (like design, strategy, or copywriting) then I just do it. If a client needs, let's say, product photography, we can do that on a professional level with no problem. I find it difficult to convey that without including the subcontractors on the site. Something I'll chew on, for sure.  Definitely right about the video, I'll tweak it a bit and see how it looks.   Seriously, thanks for the constructive feedback."
Entrepreneur,3dzlvw,sthrlnd,2,Mon Jul 20 21:57:03 2015 UTC,"yeah, i understand what you mean. However, what you essentially have is a pool of resources that you are skilled at drawing from when necessary. This doesn't equate to a collective, unless all your subcontractors where aware of the part they're playing here.  I understand the desire to communicate as a 'we' ( and you could technically be a 'we') but if you do so, your clients will assess you from the perspective of a collective and rank you accordingly, against companies that truly are, like this one ---- http://whois.wildlife.la/    I say rethink your branding strategy and market yourself as you are. Use transparency as a strength and build your brand around your unique selling point, which is the fact that you are resourceful and can accomplish a lot on your own. Outsourcing is your tool, not your team. There are a million collectives out there, doing it really well. I would think that you wouldn't want to pit yourself against them indirectly because tbh, I'm not sure you'd win. But different story if you package your actual offering in a smashing web presence that conveys your unique perspective on how its possible to get things done.    If someone with your exact spec came to you, how would you brand them? What innovative narrative would you offer them to tie there package up?"
Entrepreneur,3dzlvw,FewerSteps,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:45:37 2015 UTC,"The desire to be branded as a collective/agency lies in the core ideal of the business–that brands can be built to inspire action. That, I think, is why I strayed away from the more personal ""brand"" and towards more of an entity. It also lies in the nature of the office I work out of–it's all about celebrating collaboration between different creative mediums, so the sub contractors I work with fall in a grey area between partners and outsourced workers.  In the end, however, I think you hit the nail on the head. Though I don't feel like I'm hiding anything, per se, it does feel a little bit disingenuous to write in ""we"", ""us"", etc.  What would you think about keeping the brand entity, but immediately identifying it as an extension of my personal brand? I feel like that would still convey the core ideal based around the creation of a brand, while being a little bit more transparent about the actual process and offering that's under the hood.  Or would it make more sense to just do the www.bengreenisanindependentconsultant.com kinda thing, and ride out the personal brand?  If it were a client, I'd probably hit somewhere in between. Build a creative entity that's synonymous with your personal brand. I don't know. Now I'm ranting.  Thanks again for the great input, it's really valuable."
Entrepreneur,3dzlvw,FewerSteps,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:22:31 2015 UTC,"I don't see the connection between your core ideal and a collective. Your core ideal - 'brands can be built to inspire action' - should be present irrespective of how many people sit at the desks.   It's a principle and it's exactly what brands should do, inspire action, or else they have failed in their singular mandate. That is literally what a brand does. ('Action' being defined as multiple things buy, share, think, engage, understand, believe, spread the word, change perspectives etc) By giving up the one - there's no need to give up the other.   I think it would be possible to design an identity around your company/service that spoke to pure solid gold initiative - because that's exactly what you're employing by offering agency calibre services using outsourced teams. (It's a business model in itself) Your overheads are low, you don't have salaries to pay, you don't have to move to bigger, crappier offices to handle capacity. Thats awesome, it's great, there's nothing to cover up there.  Use that, own that, brand that and you can be the face or not. Up to you.   This doesn't relegate you to the pile of solo entrepreneurs hacking it out on their own for the rest of their lives. You can still grow. And when you do employ someone or partner with someone, introduce them to your customers the way you introduced yourself. Then do it again and then again.  Go with BEN GREEN. leave out the 'independent consultant' bit, it's obvious. Then when you become plural, keep BEN GREEN. its rad. There's in agency here in SA called King James, always loved that."

Many private label companies, in the US, China, and such... They all have very similar eye shadow palettes and they will allow you to customize it by picking your own shades. Like a palette that can hold 6 eye shadow colors, you can pick 6 out of maybe 200 colors that you like and place them inside the palette.  Then, you pay a fee for plating.. material... products. The private label company would put your own brand name on the palette. That's when you would want your brand name to be patented."

Entrepreneur,3e0fl3,UnifiedCosmetics,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:25:13 2015 UTC,"No problem. What you need to understand about patents is that a patent on a given invention is only issued once to one inventor or group of inventors. You can not get a patent on a private label (PL) product because a PL product by definition, already exists in the public domain and you as a private label reseller (buy it wholesale with your brand on it and resell it at retail) are not the inventor. That said, it is possible that the person that originally invented the product (before it was available for PL) got a patent on it ...

Marketing so far - Advertising in monthly newsletter in our local area - for $5/month I can't complain.   Worked - not a lot  Website - because my boss (Dad) doesn't like the idea of paying for one and focuses on word-of-mouth. Doesn't realise that word-of-mouth is pointless if they then have no way of contacting you afterwards. (He doesn't even know I am making enquiries and planing one - I will pay it out of my own pocket until it works if it comes down to it.)

Entrepreneur,3dvdbn,in5trum3ntal,4,Mon Jul 20 05:12:16 2015 UTC,If you use MailChimp or other professional email service provider odds are you don't need to maintain separate IPs (they tend to mail from pools of IPs).  I would recommend using separate domains.

Entrepreneur,3dvdbn,onlybauss,5,Mon Jul 20 17:01:47 2015 UTC,"I believe Mandrill will allow you a one time reset of your account. I would look into that first.  I would also more importantly ask your server company if they can see any error messages as to why the email is getting flagged. We had a similar problem because one of our sites on the server was hacked and sent some spam email out and when they pulled some error files, there was a link to a ""spam company"" that provides a list of troubled IPs. We were able to get our IP reset off that list.  And of course, get separate solutions set up for transaction email and marketing emails. This means completely separate IPs, not just domains if they're on the same server."
Entrepreneur,3dvdbn,Vegas321,2,Mon Jul 20 01:46:15 2015 UTC,Do you know if it should be completely different domain or it can be a subdomain?  Thanks.
Entrepreneur,3dvdbn,CowboyProgrammer,4,Mon Jul 20 05:15:03 2015 UTC,"Your absolute best bet from my experience is to do all of your marketing emails through a third party provider, so none of it comes through your website/domain/IP address.   MailChimp is great but has stricter rules on how you acquire your email addresses but their emails almost never end up in spam. YMLP is another option and has a lot less restrictions in that sense. If your lists are all people that opted in and genuinely want your info, I say go with mailchimp.  If you can do your transaction email off-site as well, that's awesome too. Either way, do your marketing emails through a third party company and you'll avoid a lot of headaches, especially if you do need to use your site/server for transaction emails"
Entrepreneur,3dvdbn,RedneckBob,2,Mon Jul 20 05:23:32 2015 UTC,"True, With Amazon SES, Sendgrid, Mandrill, and Postmark around, you have powerful, and free up to a limit, transnational email providers which you can use with just about any application and not just your site.   I also like these providers better than front end providers like Mailchimp, Aweber etc since you can simply just use SMTP authentication to email out using your own self-hosted apps and plugins like Sendy.co, Mailpoet, Sendpress which offer a bit more flexibility. Not to mention some have the option of dedicated IP addresses.  However, this is coming from a developer POV. if you are just starting out with email marking.. better to go with MailChimp, Aweber and the like."

Entrepreneur,3dvdbn,speedisavirus,2,Mon Jul 20 06:46:30 2015 UTC,"I did Email Marketing for a large eCommerce company a while back.  We sent out between 50k and 100k emails per blast, 3-5 times a week.  The number of emails was dependent on custom purchase history.  Anyway, we used Yesmail as our email marketing provider.  I'm not plugging them, and they aren't really cheap, but they managed all of our domain and address white listing, so we never had issues getting through Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail and the rest of the large providers.  Even with paying Yesmail, email marketing was still our cheapest method of customer acquisition.  That's out of PPC, Catalogs, TV and Radio.  All businesses are different, so this doesn't apply to everyone, but I don't think I'd ever give up on email completely."

In fact, the dynamic working against you in landing Nike, works in your advantage here.  You could pitch it to them as,   ""Big companies like Nike already have professional negotiators and teams of people optimizing shipping and delivery.  I can give you those same advantages in an affordable service that will save you money and pay for itself"".    As the owner of a business that ships a physical product, that line would get my attention."
Entrepreneur,3dwlv7,proxwell,2,Mon Jul 20 07:41:22 2015 UTC,"I agree that they inflate the price, but pro team or not, they definitely are paying more than $10 for overnight.  Also I can tell you right now that they are loosing customers that want their shoes ASAP.  Today's online customer wants things yesterday, and are willing to pay a premium.  A good expedited shipping price acts as an asset and can add value to a product.  But when the premium shipping is 35% of the product price, the shipping price now becomes a liability and deters customers from purchasing directly from Nike.  The customer will now go and find a retailer that can ship it overnight for much less ($4 on Amazon) and Nike looses a +/-30% profit margin.  In the end, instead of increasing revenues with inflated shipping price, they end up loosing sales and revenues."

Entrepreneur,3dwlv7,elem030,2,Mon Jul 20 07:58:27 2015 UTC,"It depends on the price of the product, but $5 isn't that much.  And if you are the only seller/retailer for that product you won't loose customers.  In Nike's case one can purchase that same shoe from a dozen of other retailers, and will mostly price shop.   If Nike's shipping is highly inflated they will loose the sale to their retailer.  It's not exactly competition, but I'm sure Nike wouldn't mind the 20%-30% margin if they'd make the sale themselves."

Entrepreneur,3dvt2p,iamsecretlybatman,28,Sun Jul 19 23:13:22 2015 UTC,"When starting out I am a firm believer in social as it will be some time (generally 3-6months) before google starts giving you some love. Yes some niches are ""not sexy"" and social can be difficult but with a bit of imagination you should be able to pull it off.  Why social? It goes hand in hand with building links and rubbing shoulders with influencers in your niche. Traffic and link building? Two birds one stone blah blah...  While social will only drive a small fraction of conversions, it will help keep you motivated until organic search kicks in (assuming you have done your keyword research realistically) One of the major reasons that people fail in affiliate marketing is their initial motivation drops when they see no real progress being made.   Make no mistake, while social can drive huge numbers of visitors, the meat of your conversions will come from organic search (and email outreach but ill cover this further down). This makes sense as when was the last time you hopped on facebook or twitter to research a product you intend to buy? Never? Exactly.  Heres a rough guide on demographics across the popular social mediums:  http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/09/demographics-of-key-social-networking-platforms-2/  The first thing you need to do with social is narrow down who you are targeting.  Pregnancy pillow niche (yes, it's my go to example, deal with it).  Women? Not so good.   Women with sore backs? Good.  Women with sore backs from sleeping? Better.  Women with sore backs from sleeping while pregnant? Best.  While the potential amount of traffic will decrease as you refine your target, the likely hood of conversion increases assuming your onpage sales funnel is up to scratch.  So how do you target these people?  In addition to interacting with these people on social media (commenting, following, liking etc.)   You can guest post (and ask the blog you appear on to do a shoutout about the post or even better, mention your social profile) You can create a detailed infographic (and cold-email influencer blogs, ask them if they want to see it first and then include the infographic in a follow up when they reply yes)    3.Once you have enough followers do shoutout swaps with other blogs in your niche, you all have the same audience and this is a surprisingly effective way to grow your followers with minimal work.  And there are many other social media specific things you can do but that al depends on which social media you wish to target.  Speaking of which:  When starting out, it's best you only target one. Target it aggressively. Learn the in's and outs. This way you will not spread yourself too thin. Remember, you WILL have to tailor your content to whatever social media you are targetting to get the maximum effectiveness out of each post. It's not as simple as cutting and pasting a link. Images will have to be resized, text limits differ, etc. etc.  Once on page you want to drive traffic through to your affiliate links or (and this is often better with social traffic) capture their email. There are numerous ways to do this, giveaways, free ebooks etc. etc. but since social traffic is harder to convert at the point of click through you are further refining your target as the ones that give you their email are genuinely interested in what you have to offer.  Trust me, a good email list will bring in money years from now. Here is some success I saw from a single email blast on Prime day for one of my sites:  http://i.imgur.com/IKF1jzS.jpg   My only regret is that I did not start building an email list sooner.  This list has approximately 20,000 people on it and was only started 6 months ago (yes, I'm still learning too). If I had 100,000 people on that list I would have made as much in one day as many people make in a year. I cannot stress this enough start your email list NOW.  Also keep in mind that MOZ metrics are not the be all and end all in regards to how your sites rank. While they will provide a better indication of where your site sits than simply guessing, they are still far from accurate.  So your steps moving forward   social + link building at the same time Once you are happy with your daily social routine I would then focus primarily on link building.  all the while building your email list   Every visitor whether they buy from you or not is a potential add to your email list.  In regards to link building there are hundreds and hundreds of ways you can go about it. Backlinko.com has some good examples, quicksprout.com some good (but slightly dated guides).  For new sites I stick to a 50/50 ratio. If I spend an hour on content, I will spend an hour on outreach. Get out there, annoy other influencers. Annoying is memorable, even if for the wrong reasons.   Edit: Jamie-Anderson above also has posted some good link building resources."

As usual, your advice is greatly appreciated :)  Definitely gotta get started on that email list as I begin focus on outreach and rank. I've known that was important but seeing your results has me set on it now. I also have a couple more questions which I'm hoping you can shed some light on:   If I understand this correctly, why does it generally take 3-6 months before Google starts recognizing your site as legit and feeding you the organic visitors? As far as content goes, how important are pictures and (moreso) videos of your product? I have a few pictures of each product with the review, mostly just photos from the manufacturer's website. However, there's a competitor website in my niche who has a ton of photos and really well-done videos with their review. (these are pictures/videos they've personally taken so I can't just embed the same videos). Wondering if this will significantly impact their rank because of better media content? How long does it take after link-building before Google starts to recognize it and improve your rank/authorities? Which do you think is more important for rank, SEO or link-building? Is one more important than the other, or is this also a hand in hand type of thing?   I'm sure I can speak for everyone on here when I say thanks again for taking the time to help out. You and /u/W1ZZ4RD are my go-to unknown internet mentors when it comes to this stuff haha."
Entrepreneur,3dvt2p,Humblesalesman,3,Mon Jul 20 04:22:07 2015 UTC,"I can only speculate on the workings of google (like everyone else) some people call it sandboxing (you can google this for more info) but it seems to take that long for google to compare your website with other websites targeting the same keywords to determine where it wants to sit your website. As your website grows you will notice that some days pages of your website are on page one and other days these pages are on two or three. Google continually jumps the positions of webpages around (although the first page is a little more consistent) pages 2-10 seem to bounce around quite a bit. You have read a review before, haven't you? Do you like ones with large slabs of text or do you prefer them with pictures and videos. The answer is pretty obvious here. The more you can learn about a product, the more informed decision you can make about whether you want it or not. Pictures and video play a huge role here. Original pictures more so. Google CAN identify whether you are using an original picture or not (in chrome hold the ""s"" key and right click an image). Do these pictures weigh into where google places your website? (pure speculation) Yes. if you have stumbled across some of the more dominate niche websites you will notice that they use original photos. Of course if the text content is crap then original photos wont be much help. It's all hand in hand. Lets use chewiesays .com (now herepup .com) as an example. I have followed this one closely since launch as it's run by Perrin. Launched in February with an aggressive infographic campaign, this website has some AMAZING backlinks from the dog niche. It took until MAY for the website to start appearing in the search results despite it gaining some amazing backlinks that not even it's competitors could achieve. If you look at the keywords targeted you will notice that it is extreme bottom of the barrel ""maltese dog food"" - 140 monthly searches yet he constructs WHOLE PAGES around these. No surprise he ranks first for them.  The less competitive the keywords you are targeting, the quicker you will see success. As for an exact estimate before you start seeing results? Too much plays into this to give an exact answer.  Niche, competition, backlinks, content quality, onpage optimization... etc. Hand in hand. On page seo is more of a one off as once you have it all sorted, you will be creating content in a similar template each and every time. Links ARE becoming noticeably less important as I am starting to notice websites with inferior backlinks start to outrank better optimized and more detailed ones with strong backlink profiles. Time since the article was published, is it constantly updated and onsite user interaction all appear to play consistently greater roles. Backlinks still have their place though, but chase ones that in addition to being just a backlink will also drive traffic to your website (for email capture)."

Entrepreneur,3dvt2p,Humblesalesman,3,Mon Jul 20 03:23:32 2015 UTC,"It worked out that about $100k of those sales were fueled by email. I drove people to a landing page on my website that quickly explained the details of the deal I was pushing. Like with all amazon sales, be sure to remove them from your website prior to the sale ending. Amazon can and will boot you from the affiliate program for not removing sale links prior to the sale ending, it has happened twice to me now. While you can reapply to become an affiliate once the link is removed (something amazon seems happy to do) you will forfeit your last two months commission that has been accrued.  The reason your emails are ending up in the promotions tab of gmail is because your emails sound like a promotion. I write in a short but sweet letter form with a single link and seem to have little problem getting into the primary inbox. I am not sure if google has now flagged your entire email as being a promotor or if it works on an email by email basis (again, I am still learning the ins and outs of email marketing)."
Entrepreneur,3dvt2p,cyberhunk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:58:29 2015 UTC,"Is your landing page aimed at one product?  I was thinking the promotions tab was because of Mailchimp. Regular correspondence and support emails don't end up there, only when I blast the list."

I don't include any pictures I include a single link I speak like I am having a conversation with them.

Entrepreneur,3dvt2p,Jamie-AndersonDotCom,2,Mon Jul 20 16:52:25 2015 UTC,"Hi mate,  I wouldn't focus on what the Moz toolbar says, or what your domain authority or page authority is. These are metrics that can be handy for reference when building links, but are not important. Moz will tell you they are, but they would, as they have tool subscriptions to sell.  Another thing you won't hear about much on Moz is building backlinks. This is by far the most important element of ranking any website or page. You are at the link building stage of your project now as I assume you have the content and on site aspects of the site all wrapped up.  I could write a million words on link building, the different styles, and how important it is, but I'd recommend you go and start learning about it yourself.  Depending on what your goals are, and how you want to go about doing things, then you have a few options.  I hate to label link building, but most people in the industry feel the need to label link building as whitehat, greyhat and blackhat. I don't agree with any of this, in Google's eyes if you are actively building backlinks then you are blackhat as you are essentially going against the webmaster guidelines.  Anyway, here are some places to read up on link building to get you started:   http://pointblankseo.com/creative-link-building http://pointblankseo.com/link-building-strategies http://pointblankseo.com/link-building-resources http://pointblankseo.com/scalable-link-building   There are not only dozens of effective link building methods in that guy's articles, but there is also a sources page which has lots of other good link building blogs and forums in there, you will never be short of link opportunities again.  Best of luck."

That was going to be my suggestion too.  I've been on development teams where you get conflicting messages about delivery speed and defect rate, which are often at odds with each other, and if any of this happens it can be a little hard to speak up.  So I would recommend not only empathy but ask if they feel like they are being tasked in some way that seems unhelpful or if they sense any contradictions.  Software estimating is hard and lots of projects deliver late, but the empathetic approach can at least bring out any grave concerns."

Entrepreneur,3dvrff,superironthorman,3,Mon Jul 20 00:32:47 2015 UTC,"I think as of now it's cost about $3500.    ~$100 apple developer program ~$300 design and drawing of all the emojis ~$60 user interface design ~$3000 development of the app. (They offered to do it for 2k if I didn't want an integrated keyboard but I thought that was necessary. Probably also important to note that their original bid was 5k, so there is a lot of room for negotiations with this stuff. Original bid for the emojis was also like $600ish so worked on the price there as well. ~$200 - the amount I probably spent on Starbucks coffee lol   As per tech wise, I did the website attached to the project and that's about it from the actual development. I did design the emojis and had to be around to answer a lot of questions about how I wanted things to look (the more detail the better as it prevented extra revisions)"

Entrepreneur,3dvrff,Vertp,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:39:46 2015 UTC,Nope. It doesn't take $3000 to create an app that has a compilation of images + the keyboard. I could have this entire concept done in 20 hours of work (at MOST) with a developer taking $30 an hour. This idea is not trivial.
Entrepreneur,3dvrff,vexa27,0,Mon Jul 20 15:27:20 2015 UTC,:( Always thought that was a possibility. Do you have any benchmarks or rough price estimates or resources for figuring out the correct ballpark for different types of apps?

Entrepreneur,3dvrff,tone_,2,Mon Jul 20 01:57:32 2015 UTC,Are you running ads in the app? Or does the app cost money? Or is it a freemium model?
Entrepreneur,3dvrff,concurrenthashmap,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:17:12 2015 UTC,Going freemium with it. The first category of emojis (the ones I thought were the best/most marketable) are free and then the rest are .99 cents.  1 of the biggest complaints I saw in the reviews of some of the other emoji apps were ad programs freezing up the keyboards and being too obnoxious for people to ever want to use it. Most of the ones it looked like that ran ads had reviews from a bunch of people talking about how they deleted it.
Entrepreneur,3dvrff,tone_,2,Mon Jul 20 03:19:55 2015 UTC,"I like the detail and also the cost break down. I've gone to app devs before for quotes and received 23-28k for an app, which we thought was way too high, though it was a much more in depth app.   I'd be curious if someone could provide a price structure that's an average or ""standard"".

Entrepreneur,3dvrff,ygprogrammer,2,Mon Jul 20 12:15:23 2015 UTC,"I've got a computer engineering and PHP background so I think it was a bit easier for me moving to Java. Web and apps are going to change, as self contained applications are kind of counter intuitive compared to normal web browsing.  It's actually kind of stupid to have to load up the Facebook and then the Twitter app, instead of just tabbing between the two on a browser. So I think there are going to be a lot of changes over the next 2-5-10 years as apps become a bit more background and are used more on things like wearables and via Google Now.  It's definitely fun programming for apps (I've only gone as far as Android so far) and I'd definitely recommend it if you have the time. Only problem is that with 2+ years doing it 50% of the time at work (as well as the PHP web dev), and a bit at home, I'm having a lot of difficulty finding an employer as it's actually a fairly big career pivot, so consider what you really would / want to get out of learning to develop apps."

Here are something that I came across upon a quick glance of your site:     My first impression of the website was “huh, the logo should probably be brighter” as opposed to being, “this is awesome, let’s see what they’ve got”.  Also, every single product has a 0 out of 5 star rating, maybe consider taking the rating system off the site until you have a steady stream of reviews coming in.  The website doesn’t look very professional, IMO… if you can’t afford legitimate web dev, have you considered sites like Shopify to host your products?.  Also, the ABOUT US section is kind of bizarre.  I’m thinking that the phrase “We believe that the World today is rapidly declining in a negative way” might turn some people off.  What about the people who think the world is OKAY but still want survival gear?  They won't buy from you.  It's important to niche down, but voicing your opinion of a declining world is probably not going to earn you any sales.  “It is our mission to educate families on the importance of being prepared and making sure Americans are safe.” If I were you, I’d focus on making your blog a focal point.  If your mission really is to educate, then your actions should reflect that.  I don’t think your blog should be hidden in your site in a drop down menu item.   I think part of your focus should be on curating really awesome content.  Copying and pasting from YouTube and other blogs is good but not great.   These are my impressions."

If you don't already use it, I would recommend using Google Analytics to get a better understanding of how customers interact with your web site. Set up goals and you will start to be able to understand where customers are exiting the purchase funnel on your site and where improvements need to be made. Look at the Behavior Flow and the exit page stats.  The most scientific way to diagnose and fix a problem on your site is by first understanding the data. What does the data say about how customers interact with your web site. Make adjustments and then reevaluate the numbers to make improvements."
Entrepreneur,3dxyx7,petvotion,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:21:33 2015 UTC,"Well, we aren't getting a ton of traffic either. It fluctuates a lot from day to day. We've been doing guest blogs and getting a decent amount of traffic from that, but that's it"
Entrepreneur,3dxyx7,was_sup,2,Mon Jul 20 14:39:40 2015 UTC,"It sounds like traffic is the first thing you need to address. Improving the quality of that traffic can be done simultaneously. I would recommend developing a multi-faceted marketing plan to drive additional traffic to your site.  Social - You have an Instagram account with over 1,000 followers. You also have some really cool and unique products, but all of your posts look like marketing collateral. Encourage your followers to send you pictures of them using your gear ""in the field"" This will 1) encourage them to interact with you 2) Additional (good) content typically leads to more follows 3) good content can be re-purposed to use on you site. In my experience, traffic from social media tends to not convert very high, but the idea would be that once you have more followers then you can drive them from your Instagram account to your site.  SEM - Invest in google keywords. Initially focus on long tail ones to improve your ROAS. i.e. Don't pay for the term ""outdoor gear"" buy the term ""outdoor gear for survivalists"" No idea if that is the right term, but start testing out terms. Keep the ones that work, stop buying the ones that don't work and add more.  Guerrilla Marketing - Submit your site to a social sharing site like Stumble Upon or answer questions related to your industry on Reddit  Trade Shows - You can print up hundreds of fliers from Staples or Vistaprint and get awareness for relatively cheap at industry trade shows. If you have then funding then you could even rent out a booth.    SEO - make sure that you have good and relevant content on your site. Are all of the low hanging SEO boxes checked i.e. meta-tags, image / video tags, product descriptions and content written with relevant language.  Once you start driving traffic to your site using these tactics you will be able to measure the value of each one. i.e. Are visitors to your site from paid google ads converting at 3% and visitors from Social media converting at 0.5%. In that instance you would want to re-focus your efforts more towards paid ads.  You can make adjustments to your site all day long, but I can't stress enough how important it is to measure each one and let the customer on-site data determine what is and is not working."

I was either limited or banned within 2-4 days of doing arbitrage betting on the vast majority of UK and AUS sites.  Also, it might not be the same in the UK, but in Australia if gambling is your sole income, it is taxable. Only recreational gambling is tax free."
Entrepreneur,3e0hsr,LucidTA,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:31:48 2015 UTC,"Hi mate,  The reason you were banned is because you were arbing. Matched betting is different from arbing, you aren't taking advantage of the difference in prices between the bookmakers and the exchanges when matched betting, so you don't need an arb to make money. Your profit is made from the bookmakers offering free bets and you then laying a certain amount on the exchange to guarantee an exact amount of profit regardless of the outcome.  As I explained in the post, you are not taxed on any gambling profits in the UK."

Entrepreneur,3e0hsr,blvckscvle_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:36:24 2015 UTC,"Most of the offers from the bookmakets (bwin, typico, bet365, ...) are linked with special terms.  For example: you have to bid the free money, lets say 50£, 5x on a bet with a minimum quote of 1.7 before you can cash in on the money.  I dont think that match betting is viable if you have to bet the money 5, 7 or 10 times to get that 50£ of bonus cash.   My question is: how do you deal with this?  Thanks."
Entrepreneur,3e0hsr,blvckscvle_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:45:47 2015 UTC,"Hi mate,  I'm not sure what makes you think most of the bookmakers offers have special terms attached to them, the vast majority don't.  The 3 you mentioned are 3 of around 60 odd initial sign up offers that are listed on the site I use, most of which have no wagering requirements at all attached to the free bet offers.  The Bet365 offer you mention in particular is one of the best offers out there for a matched bettor. You only have to wager the £200 bonus money they give you IF your bet wins with them.  That means that is your bonus money bet loses, which on average it will more than not if you are betting on anything over even money, then you are finished with the offer.  If it wins, then you just have to wager £800 using normal matches to clear the wagering then withdraw, it's really not difficult.  I'm not sure why you don't think matched betting is viable either, if you want to potentially make £40,000+ per year as an additional income then it is viable, if you want to make far more than this then it probably won't be viable.   It's all dependant on how much time you can commit to it every day, how well you manage your bank (e.g. not spending all the profit you make straight away), and how quickly you can get through the offers. My earnings are based on no more than a couple hours a day on average, so it's more than viable for me."
Entrepreneur,3e0hsr,blvckscvle_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:55:22 2015 UTC,"Hello,   at first, i didnt want to offend you or anything and really appreciate the time and effort you put in this thread, i'm ust curious about the method.  If you take the offer from interwetten as example (i'm from austria so it's in €):  They offer you up to 100€ bonus if you bet 5x the amount of bonus money on bets with 1.7 or higher.  So lets say you want all off the 100€, then you have to bet 500€ on a bet with a factor of at least 1.7 (please correct me if am getting something wrong here).  The bet itself is not what is confusing me but the match bet. Do you really find a buyer for a 500€ bet on betdaq or any other 'match-bet-website'?  Or would this be handled with lets say 10x50€ bets + match bets?  But this is the much more time consuming method i guess? (more bets/match bets = more time needed)  Btw i have no idea how long it takes to sell the match bet since i have never done this and i am new to this. But what i was reading its something similar than selling a product on ebay/craigslist?  You have to find someone who is willing to buy your match bet and there is the point where the main problem lies i think?  I am sorry for any assumption that isn't right and for my english (it's not my primary language).  Looking forward to your reply.  Thanks in advance."
Entrepreneur,3e0hsr,TheCrazyChris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:01:03 2015 UTC,"Hi mate, no offence taken at all, I'm happy to answer your questions.  I think you are getting confused with how it works though. Firstly, with the Interwetten offer, if the match/horse you choose to back and lay loses the match/race, then you won't have to wager anything at all on Interwetten, all the profit will be in your exchange account and you can move on to the next offer as that will be completed.  You will only have to do the wagering if your bet wins with the bookmaker. Also, getting £500 matched on the likes of Betfair/Smarkets/Betdaq/Matchbook for popular sporting events is no problem at all. I've matched bets as high as £800 on many occasions.  I'm not sure what the correlation between selling on ebay/craigslist is that you are making but I think if you join the site that I recommend on my blog (it's free to join and learn how to do this, all clearly explained in videos and articles) then things will be a lot clearer to you then.  Cheers."
Entrepreneur,3e0hsr,theprawnofperil,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:19:08 2015 UTC,"Hello there,  thanks for the fast reply. I will take a look at it when im home from work.  Just that i am getting this right:  I want to place a bid that i lose on a bookmaker. For example Arsenal - Leicester City:  On the bookmaker i bid 50€ on Leicester City not to lose for a quote of 2,5.  Then i need to find a bet on betdaq for Arsenal to win on 2,5. But who is offering a bet like this? I cant imagine someone listing a bet for Arsenal to win with a quote of 2,5 against a bottom team like Leicester City?  Or are just the bets with similar Quotes interesting? Like Arsenal - Chelsea?  Also how do you manage to use the offers for first time registration multiple times? Do you generate always new email-addresses?  Thanks."
Entrepreneur,3e0hsr,theprawnofperil,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:06:43 2015 UTC,"You've nearly got the idea, but not quite.  You join 'Bookmaker A' and place a bet with them that Arsenal will beat Chelsea. This is your 'BACK' bet.  You then go to your bettign exchange of choice, Betfair/Smarkets/Betdaq/Matchbook, and LAY Arsenal to win.  This is your 'LAY' bet. It means you are essentially betting that Arsenal won't win, so any other result means your lay bet will win on the exchange, and if Arsenal do win, your back bet wins with the bookmaker.  It means that no matter what the outcome it's impossible to lose.   Once these bets have settled, you will then have your free bet or bonus money from the bookmaker to use within 24 hours usually, sometimes instantly.  You would then do the same thing again, however you would have to use the simple oddsmatching calculator that provides you with the exact amounts to use to guarantee the maximum amount of profit from the free bet. Again, this will mean you cannot lose and will be shown the exact amount of guaranteed profit you will make before backing and laying using the bookmaker free bet.  This whole process can take seconds to do, and matched betting is essentially rinsing and repeating this process over and over.  Hope that helps, but if not, the videos I mentioned definitely will.  Cheers."

Entrepreneur,3dy0lb,Haze245,2,Mon Jul 20 13:59:12 2015 UTC,"A responsive website is built in ""blocks"" that can rearrange based on screen size. It's important in order to ensure a good user experience on a range of devices. Contrast that kind of design with websites that look the same on desktop and mobile - you can't do both well with the same layout."
Entrepreneur,3dy0lb,_Stasis,0,Mon Jul 20 14:05:27 2015 UTC,"It's a bit more complicated than that, though, right?  Images must also change both in size and for retina/non-retina, for example.  Menu systems must be responsive.  Touch needs to be accommodated....."
Entrepreneur,3dy0lb,_Stasis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:24:50 2015 UTC,Absolutely! My explanation was very simplistic. Another important facet is vectorised images so that you don't see pixelation when zooming in.
Entrepreneur,3dy0lb,Haze245,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:43:20 2015 UTC,"Now that's interesting to me -- that you don't know!  You're front-end developer should have talked with you about this, imho.   Anyway, a web layout that, itself, responds to the device that it is being viewed upon is one that ""responds"" or is ""responsive.""    A responsive website's layout will change for retina display, desktop, mobile, tablet, etc.  It means your site will look good across all media and Comcast recently reported that 80 percent of users are viewing sites in mobile, thus important.  People are not tethered to desktops any longer.  In April, Google made this quite important as they now penalize in mobile search websites that are not mobile and/or responsive.  Here's the link to the site tester: https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/  Some people build both a mobile and a traditional site.  I don't recommend that path.    A responsive site's images grow and contract to fit the screen size, the columns are fluid, the user need not needlessly scroll left/right or minimize to comfortably view.  Retina is also important.  And, of course, so is a site that responds to both touch and click.  There's more but I think that should be a good beginning for you to understand?"

OP- check with your states Secretary of State website or call them to find out how to apply for an LLC. It's very cheap, usually $50 or less. You absolutely do not need an accountant, and although it's not wrong to say a lawyer would be helpful, it's not critical at the early stages of your business.

Entrepreneur,3dwsd8,motorboatmcgee,3,Mon Jul 20 04:34:33 2015 UTC,what kind of market are you in? what state? size of town/city? saturation of current restaurants?  It sounds like what you do now is fitting. Have you considered taking over the distributorship you currently work for or breaking into your own? that may be a way to accrue more capital and experience. Restaurants are easier to handle when they are subsidiary of a larger business.  Traditional business financing with a cash investment of your own as collateral may be the way to go. Do you have any friends or family that share the dream? You would have to make sure they understand that they will always be subordinate to you in decision making and general management of the business affairs. Family problems usually start over shitbags who don't pull their weight or complain about others in the business the same way.  What do you think?
Entrepreneur,3dwsd8,aFrothyMix,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:29:38 2015 UTC,"My theoretical watering hole will be located in a suburb of Dallas/ Ft Worth. As with any town, restaurants come and go fairly often, but the particular area I am interested in has seen solid restaurant growth in the last few years and there are plans announced for numerous future openings.  I have spoke with a couple of family members about general business advise and how to search for the capital but I have made it clear that I am not looking for a hand out from them. I'm sure they would be happy to help if it came down to it because they have seen my vision and are just as excited about it as I am, but I am wanting to look at other options first."
Entrepreneur,3dwsd8,aFrothyMix,2,Mon Jul 20 05:44:06 2015 UTC,"Money is cheap and plentiful, keeping your family away from investing capital is a wise move. I know that I love menu offerings that give the place a reason to go for that item. A way to have a cheap rail and coke  and a big fancy cocktail on the same menu is important. I detest places that make shit cocktails that start at $8 $9 bucks without other options. A ""cold beer"" for cheap and a rotating selection of craft beers on tap. I hate Utah for the lack of options that I mentioned above. Nobody in the entire state can sell kegged draught beer above the 3.2% by weight or 4.0 ABV. This leads to mediocre examples of styles like IPA's that require more alcohol to balance the hops.  My favorite burger place is Lucky 13 here in Salt Lake City, they have amazing burgers but their cocktail list is overpriced and shitty due to liqour laws and their draught beer is like every other selection in Utah, shallow and weak. Great patio dining in the summer, laid back, HOUSE SMOKED bacon as a key ingredient to several of their sandwiches, yet because its Utah they fail on the price and quality of their beverages."

Entrepreneur,3dwsd8,lucius_pixel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:38:15 2015 UTC,"Hi, my mom and dad own a pretty successful restaurant for about 15 years now. In order for them to get started on capital they had to take out a loan from the bank  to get the capital they needed to start. They bought all of their appliances and cooking utilities second hand from dead or dying restaurants. For furnishing the eating area they once again bought everything used but made sure that everything looked decent.  In terms of getting food suppliers they actually got contacted by local wholesalers but it shouldn't be too hard to contact some through the yellow pages or by the Internet.         Unlike ecommerence, owning a restaurant is extremely difficult because you are at the mercy  of the local population, so you need to consider your location wisely. Although your food need to be somewhat good, the most important factors you need to be successful is consider pricing appropriately and delivering high quality interactions with the customer."
Entrepreneur,3dxdyh,shirtsoptional,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:15:46 2015 UTC,"I'd say wait. With a sort of soft launch, if people visit your site and things aren't ready to go, you run the risk of alienating some people and missing out on sales.  Whereas you can generate the exact same hype and mailing lists during a hard launch. I'm not sure there's much risk either way, but I don't think the potential advantages from moving forward sooner outweigh the potential negatives.  It may make day 1 launch a bit slower and not too exciting, but you want any initial rush of interested people to at least be able to purchase, IMO. I think patience is the answer, but you may want to get in contact with some things that you can have input in regarding timing like your bloggers. You can mention that it's all going ""live"" on X day, so they can post accordingly."
Entrepreneur,3dxdyh,tone_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:56:16 2015 UTC,"Quick and explosive launches are dangerous. You are exposing yourself to many unforeseen issues, including customer service and sales logistics. It is great to create momentum, but you want to build a solid base to keep the traffic stable.  In your case, it looks like a pre-order scenario might be effective. Talk about your product to get the interest going, ship samples to bloggers in order to get early feedback, set a countdown for the launch date, create a pre-order landing page. You will also want to create a content plan for the post-launch stage to keep customers engaged. You need to figure out how to keep opinion leaders talking about your product."
Entrepreneur,3dxdyh,jamesorieux,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:41:39 2015 UTC,"With a physical product you don't really rely on network effects or have any 'critical mass' to reach, so a soft launch is the best bet.   I would suggest a soft launch now, growing your presence through social media. Use the opportunity to develop more effective copy and test out your funnel and build up some subscribers.

They handle the ebook generation for you and even if you don't want to sell on their marketplace you can still use them to generate the books for you.  I wouldn't even bother worrying about piracy. If it gets spread around then that means your name gets out there more and people will look for more of your books. If you're looking to DRM your book you're just going to upset people.  Also be sure to have a link to a landing page where you can collect people's emails so you can update them on future books. If some people do pirate your book (highly unlikely) then you can at least try to get something out of them.  Leanpub will automatically send your customers the updated version.

My Initial reaction was a purveyor of large slabs and logs of hardwood old growth trees and having a custom milling business to sell to artists and high end interior finish carpenters.  When you said refinishing I am now guessing flooring. If thats the case you may considering working for a flooring company then branching out when you get a feel for the production work as opposed to hobby diy work. Let us know! It will be much like starting a sole proprietorship llc as a plumber or electrician or doing finish carpentry."

Entrepreneur,3dryuo,ThrowawayForumOwner,18,Sat Jul 18 23:11:32 2015 UTC,"Throwaway account for personal reasons.  Create a niche online forum covering a topic you have a great interest in.    I'm not saying you'll have an enormous success, but it can be very profitable.  If you have a ton of knowledge on a specific topic and you're willing to put in a lot of time, you can gain a large following.  All it takes is the ability to answer questions users may have, or posting new/relevant information users will be interested in.  I've owned many over the years with varied success.    I've had some produce a few hundred a month of passive income, while other forums have had in excess of 100k annual profit.  Selling premium accounts, offering vendors an outlet to offer relevant products/services to members, your own branded merchandise, and other advertising can generate 24/7 revenue.  The key is running the site around a topic you're truly passionate about.  If you don't love the topic, you'll have no interest in dealing with trolls, bs from members, and everything else that comes with managing staff.  If all goes well, it can be very rewarding."

Entrepreneur,3dryuo,ThrowawayForumOwner,2,Sun Jul 19 05:23:34 2015 UTC,"I take it by ""generate content"" you mean like blog posts (detailed article on x topic of y subject area) on a forum?   I ask because this interests me but I'm not sure where to start. Do you have a basic write up that describes the process of creating content and getting users? I have web hosting experience and I assume it's basically running a forum like a blog with specific subforums with articles in each to attract new users with questions or comments until the community is built."
Entrepreneur,3dryuo,doopercooper,2,Sun Jul 19 05:26:01 2015 UTC,"I was referring to making comments with an additional username.  Example: my username is ""user1"" as the site owner. I make countless posts on the subject of ""basket weaving"".  A new member joins the site: ""user2"".   They ask a question about where to buy supplies.  I answer the post as user1.  They ask a follow up question right after that.  Instead of answering the question as ""user1"", I create another account called ""user3"" and answer the question.  It's done purely as a way to make it look like there are other people actively answering messages when it's actually still me.  The other comment from the reddit user here was suggesting they made hundreds of fake accounts to generate ""conversations/activity"".  I've never really done that.  I'd maybe make one account or something, but not tons.  It's just for the illusion of activity on the site.  It's the same principal as reddit really.  Would you hang around here if every post was made from one or two users?  You'd probably go elsewhere.  I don't really have any guides or anything, but if you have specific questions, I'll try to help or point you in the right direction.  Basically you're almost copying reddit.  You create subreddits for topics that all revolve around a main topic.  Example below following the basket weaving idea:  Basket weaving Basket weaving methods Basket weaving supplies Show off your basket weaving projects Basket weaving project of the month Basket weaving local clubs Troubleshooting your basket issues    Etc."

Their B&B is the only one that was worth the time needed. The others were running at a loss due to things like licensing costs, taxes and location. Did you know that if you make craft soaps in the EU, you have to apply for a cosmetics manufacturing license? At least $4,000 per year. That the other café in the area was run by a politician who paid herself a small business subsidy sure didn't help.  So yeah, AirBnB can be a pretty good idea."

Entrepreneur,3dryuo,Balderdash42,4,Sun Jul 19 12:17:15 2015 UTC,"Professional gambler here, some sportsbooks offer bonuses when you make a new account (to attract recreational gamblers), the bonus terms for these are normally in favour of the customer so you can clear the bonus and always make a profit (by laying the opposite side of your bet on a betting exchange). There are a lot of mega threads on the internet if you search around. But a FWIW profits are much smaller now than in the past, the terms and conditions are stricter and some of the sportsbooks are shadier. That site i bet there's at least 5 sportsbooks with great bonus offers that are easy to clear and it's interesting to learn how advantage gambling works."
Entrepreneur,3dryuo,Balderdash42,2,Sat Jul 18 23:09:52 2015 UTC,its a system that was developed by several betting players in order to accumulate the free bettting bonus.  Amazon offers fba (fullfilled by amazon). I haven't used ebay that much as Amazon but I think if you are working on branding (private labelling) then Amazon is your best choice.
Entrepreneur,3dryuo,oryarimi,7,Sun Jul 19 13:02:58 2015 UTC,"I fully agree. If you're selling any new branded (private label, retail) products, Amazon's platform is the way to go. eBay is generally better for selling used products as it's easier to state your product conditions better and less likely someone will return your product.

Entrepreneur,3dryuo,wardetbestanee,6,Sun Jul 19 03:08:17 2015 UTC,"It depends on how you will work on it. If you are an aspiring writer and expecting to write a book on a topic you like and for what you like about then yes you are going to have tough luck. If you follow a ""make money with kindle"" program it will be way easier (there are several on Udemy and possibly others freely shared on youtube and google).   A very quick summary of the procedure is that:  1) you find a topic that has low competition and some interest (there are tools for that)  2) you hire a ghost writer and pay from a $100 to $400 depending on quality and material you will give to the writer  3) you promote and market your book. (tools and techniques exist, you just follow the procedure)  No its not that simple, I am just giving the basics of how is done.

Entrepreneur,3dryuo,Logicfan,2,Sun Jul 19 00:13:20 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by shit all?   If you are talking about getting paid. You are right. What matters most for $, is views. You get paid bad on ad views. More views, more $.   Although, more subs can mean more views, which can mean more $. This is because when someone subscribeds, all my new vids come up in thier feed. So they are more likely to watch future vids if they subscribe."

One of the girls I follow for makeup tutorials constantly sells makeup on her website. One of cooking tutorials sells her cook book and cooking and baking supplies.   They use their youtube channel to teach something, and take advantage to tell viewers where to buy. So youtube is one stream of income, and they spread from there.  One of my favorite sewing tutorial channels is always selling unique prints through her website. Or offers discounts for using her affiliate link. She also sells fun stuff, like cute sewing supplies and accessories.  Youtube is a great way to explore that."

Entrepreneur,3du41r,ProfTables,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:13:12 2015 UTC,"Hi mate,  if it were me personally, I think the only way I'd do something like this is if it was a fully premium directory (no free option) and it was laser targeted to a specific niche.  For example, solicitorsin[YOUR CITY].com. I would target a niche with businesses that are extremely competitive and have a good few quid to spend, think solicitors, estate agents, dentists/doctors (if you're in the US) etc etc.  To kick things off you could start by adding maybe 20 or so businesses to the site for free, then contact another 20 of their competitors saying along the lines of ""Can you afford not to be in the [CITY}'s premier directory for [NICHE} when your competitors already are?""  You will then hopefully get a lot of them joining your site and adding their business. After this, you can then remove the free ones and contact them, this time having the legitimate competitors on there to act as the bait.  It could backfire if you have competitors who talk to each other, but if you're going after ultra competitive niches then it's unlikely they'll be giving each other heads up on marketing practices.  Also, with these types of directories being so niche, I think you should be able to charge a decent monthly premium for a spot on the site. So even if you can get between 10 and 20 businesses from each niche willing to pay like £20-£30 a month, or even better commit to the whole year for a discount, then you have a set and forget reciprocal earner, and the cash to rinse and repeat and move on to the next project.  That's how I'd do it anyway, going any bigger than that and it's just too competitive, and certainly too time consuming for something that is only going to be a side project.  Best of luck whatever you decide to do."
Entrepreneur,3du41r,Jamie-AndersonDotCom,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:53:08 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the advice! That actually sounds like a pretty solid plan for this experiment. You're definitely right about becoming too time consuming, keeping that scope in check can be pretty difficult.  What, in your opinion, would be a good-sized area to focus on? Should I just do one city, or one county, or the tri-county area? What population figures do you think would be a good match to hit? Right now my city only has ~20,000 people, my county is at about 100,000, and the tri-county area is about half a million.   I feel like focusing on one niche area, in one small-medium sized city would be a bit too quiet."
Entrepreneur,3du41r,Jamie-AndersonDotCom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:13:38 2015 UTC,"I personally would target your tri-county area. I live in a city with roughly half a mil to 600k people and think that would be a perfect amount of people versus amount of businesses to target for you.  Just create your first directory and put everything in to it to make it work, and create a theme/site that you can easily quickly edit colours and small things to create next one too.   If you make success of first one then you'll want to be able to roll out 2nd, 3rd, 4th and so on as quickly and hassle free as possbile. This will be the easy bit, getting the first one right will be the tricky part. Once you have that nailed then scaling it will be no problem.  Best of luck."
Entrepreneur,3dtw05,PvtUnternehmer,2,Sun Jul 19 12:31:13 2015 UTC,"Start with a touch pic you enjoy, or something you can make money off of.

Or Appliances > Refrigerator > mini refrigerator > Best kind fridge under $300."
Entrepreneur,3dtw05,djbr22,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:38:04 2015 UTC,I would flip the question. Instead of asking what your product would be (party supplies) ask who is your target customer.  Why do you want to sell party supplies? Maybe you like the idea of bringing joy to people.   What type of person do you like interacting with the most? Maybe you like talking to soccer moms.   How would you interact with your consumer? You're really chatty and like talking on the phone or via Skype.   Ok so now your audience is soccer moms who are throwing a party for their kids and they can call you to provide advise on what party items are the best for their party.   Now that you have an target audience go after it and by going after it you'll learn the keywords.

I was approached by another business (A) that wanted to merge with my sole proprietorship (B). We ended up working close together since April without actually signing any papers. During that I found out that business A wasn't in the very healthy shape - it had debt, wasn't run efficiently, was making very little money and its biz dev strategy was not what I could agree with. So we ended up deciding to continue collaborating in the future on the projects without merging our businesses.   So my recommendation is to work on couple test projects together, be on the look out for red flags (debt, low cash flow, poor management, difference if key views, etc). Don't sign anything until you're 100% sure that this is a good fit."

Everyone sound`s excited while talking about success and money. However, when it comes to an equal work load, the excitement soon dies and in some cases it becomes a battle to get work out of someone.  I have had 4 business partners & to date I have 0. Either Im a prick to work for, or most people are simply not cut out to work when money is not guaranteed, or even working to lose money. Even more so, the major concern is that its already yours, where would it be without you? Just where it is now. Do you really need to give away 49% of your hard work, or could you just employ 4 people to work for you?  I suggest you do some sort of side project with those four individuals and see which ones are willing to work 12 hour days, 7 days a week; to build their dreams?   If successful, make sure it`s in their contracts that they have to log and work for X hours a week, and if they fail to do so, the share majority can be reconsidered without consent in X amount of time.

Very hard to get that many unless you have connections.  Good suggestion regardless!

Even if you don't make much money on the ads it can act as a portfolio for future clients to look at!"
Entrepreneur,3drv49,siddva,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:42:26 2015 UTC,One easy way to bring more visitors to your channel is by submitting the video you like the most as a video comment on Other popular and relevent videos .It works like a charm (especially if the video you are submitting is really good)
Entrepreneur,3drv49,mka696,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:15:12 2015 UTC,"I think it is less about getting subscribers and ad money and more that it would help you advertise your services. Good build teams will post time lapses of them building with nice music and editing. If you are able to point people to those videos, you can probably convert more sales. Additionally those videos may be stumbled upon by people who are interested in getting things built.   Also, an unrelated tip, get real contracts done and have them reviewed by a lawyer if possible. If you can't do that, get lots of written consent and keep strict records of it. Business is a lot easier when you aren't in the courts all the time to get your owed money."
Entrepreneur,3drv49,SpiveyArms,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:34:26 2015 UTC,"I make all my clients accept my terms of service as well as leave a comment when sending money via paypal that says ""I will not chargeback"". Additionally, my terms of service clearly say 30% up front, no refunds. If they violate any terms, i reserve the right to distribute their build and sell it to others without any refund or consent from the client."
Entrepreneur,3drv49,Oennich,4,Sun Jul 19 19:59:13 2015 UTC,That's awesome! Do you have models that the customers select from or is it a build to request thing?
Entrepreneur,3drv49,Mjlover231,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:06:01 2015 UTC,"They are all custom made by myself from scratch. Customers will sometimes say ""I really like this build so maybe do this kind of theme"" but usually they just give me a rough template and say ""make pretty build pls""  Edit: More info."
Entrepreneur,3drv49,Mjlover231,3,Sat Jul 18 23:32:37 2015 UTC,In early 2014 I also had a server (~$350 revenue and $100 profit over 8 months) and was looking for someone to do some building for me because I'm not very good at building things. I think you can definitely get some decent money by doing this.  I think another good place you may want to advertise besides PMC is the minecraft forum.  Best of luck with your building!
Entrepreneur,3drv49,DamienJDP,2,Sun Jul 19 01:15:09 2015 UTC,Can you post any pictures of your builds? I have a friend that could be in your position. He loved building and is really good at it. I just want to make sure he's up to par!
Entrepreneur,3drv49,Thehealthygamer,3,Sun Jul 19 00:03:24 2015 UTC,"You can visit my website http:// www.meerkatproductions.org and click ""examples"" there you can see pictures, my planet minecraft page, and my (incomplete) youtube channel."

Entrepreneur,3drv49,unpopularname,2,Sun Jul 19 02:02:39 2015 UTC,Yeah totally! I'll pm you and get more details.
Entrepreneur,3drv49,SpiveyArms,2,Sun Jul 19 03:17:25 2015 UTC,"I haven't been too serious into minecraft in a while, but isn't it possible to literally drop a build into a world? I know I have used mods that use console commands to enable copy paste functionality.  If you could do this it would greatly streamline your process."
Entrepreneur,3drv49,chbrules,2,Sun Jul 19 02:53:44 2015 UTC,"Yes i do use a program called world edit that allows for faster creation (copy, paste, set, replace). It makes builds go a lot faster if they are somewhat symmetrical although there is still a lot of detail that has to go into it."
Entrepreneur,3drv49,chbrules,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:36:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, that was the name. That made large builds so much easier. Creating walls from nothing, clearing out tunnels, all that. Good deal."
Entrepreneur,3drv49,Mr_Burkes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:57:24 2015 UTC,How do you compete with the 'Giants' of the industry? Such as Gazamo and Blockworks (to name a few). I assume you charge less and probably don't have the quallity to match them?
Entrepreneur,3drv49,Coopering,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:00:39 2015 UTC,"The quality of those guys work is so great that they can afford to sell at high high prices. This is why their main clients are the only people who can afford them, big servers or those who have money. I am able to get business because i cater towards smaller servers or whoever i can get in contact with. My most recent commission was with a server averaging 10-20 people online whereas ""The Hive"" might average 10k people and can probably afford better quality teams. There is actually a lot of competition here (a lot less than that of the higher levels). Mostly with smaller build teams or freelancers. You can get a taste of my competition if you look at the website www.mc-market.net and see how many teams/people are offering their services.  I would imagine higher level teams have a lot of competition for the big contracts. That or they rely on the servers coming to them."
Entrepreneur,3drv49,wardetbestanee,4,Sun Jul 19 15:20:49 2015 UTC,"You do this playing? I don't play Minecraft but, wouldn't it make more sense to use programming?"
Entrepreneur,3drv49,wardetbestanee,7,Sat Jul 18 22:58:11 2015 UTC,You can't. That's not how minecraft works
Entrepreneur,3drv49,wardetbestanee,2,Sat Jul 18 23:05:16 2015 UTC,Yes it is. I've been playing since the alpha days and I've run my own servers on linux w/ JVM. There are plenty of map-generating apps out there. The map data is stored in a simple format. It's easily exploitable by anyone that knows some basic comp sci.  http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Programs_and_editors/Mapping
Entrepreneur,3drv49,FutureChuck,3,Sun Jul 19 12:06:32 2015 UTC,"Minecraft doesnt really work like that. See a minecraft world is filled with a massive (infinite) amound of blocks. In order for a programmer to be able to program builds from console to game, they would have to A) know how to/where to find and change blocks in the world file B) be pretty creative in terms of architecture while also knowing where to put code in for those blocks to be at the exact angle and position they would want it to (not actually sure if that is possible). What i do is offer that creative building skill to the people that dont have it.  Hope that makes sense."

Entrepreneur,3drv49,oryarimi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:07:26 2015 UTC,"Yes you can make maps with 3rd party programs like that. However, using MCEdit for example, only works for terrain or schematics for builds you already have. You can't actually create the builds in the program that i know of. If you could, it would be highly inefficient and difficult."
Entrepreneur,3drv49,DamienJDP,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:49:01 2015 UTC,"I had a server too, but left after the EULA drama. Had anything changed since then?"
Entrepreneur,3drv49,DamienJDP,2,Sun Jul 19 00:14:11 2015 UTC,Drama?
Entrepreneur,3drv49,Chaosmusic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:56:32 2015 UTC,"I love answering this question.  The eula is a joke. They tried to scare us into thinking that every last server will be monitored closely, now we just laugh as the money rolls in from selling all our GAMEPLAY EFFECTING perks and items.  My theory was that they implimented that soley for the purpose of stopping the big servers from making too much money, while also setting a precedent for new servers. Most servers didnt even flinch."
Entrepreneur,3drv49,omegazerodx,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:06:33 2015 UTC,"Hey, Good on you! Can I ask, how old are you? Have you thought about crafting builds for free for some high-visibility gamers on youtube so they can get your name out there? Don't be shy in approaching them or really anyone with a lot of subs on youtube, even if they're not in the gaming field...show them what you can do with minecraft!  And then, maybe rake in some cash in minecraft ""consulting""...aka: tutoring noobs on how to build things, etc. Use Fiverr, or other such tutoring websites.  Also, consider the professional long-term, if you want. The educational field and corporate training fields have started exploring Minecraft as a means to engage employees/students beyond the boring-old slideshow when presenting information. Google it...get really good, be professional in ALL your dealings, and approach the big guys with recommendations :)  Minecraft as an educational tool: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSimHPmZ0hA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RI0BN5AWOe8  Although, I guess you'd have more luck getting into the professional field with this if you got some programming under your belt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSeHHfj9Ys4"
Entrepreneur,3drv49,GrantSEO,2,Sun Jul 19 03:08:51 2015 UTC,"Im 17. I considered asking around for youtubers who might want some help although it is very challenging to get ahold of any real ""popular"" youtubers. How would you suggest i get ahold of them?Additionally, there is a lot of competition. Bigger teams that are probably better than mine. They have a much higher chance than me. What is your opinion on this?"
Entrepreneur,3drv49,wardetbestanee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:16:27 2015 UTC,"""considering"" isn't the same thing as actually doing. All you have to do is send a message and ask, the worst that can happen is they say no and you move on, but if they say yes, well that's a big leap in the right direction...worth the risk of asking.   You're probably right. More qualified teams exist, more knowledgable, and probably better equipped, but you have to decide if you're going to use that as an excuse to limit yourself, or are you going to use that as an example of how good you can get? It wouldn't hurt to see if you can get on their teams as well, right? Maybe learn something from them.   Anyway, I'm really not the best person to ask about all this. Just wanted to throw some ideas out there. In the long run, even if you move on to something else, you'll learn a lot of great skills by giving your absolute best in each project you take on. If you don't give your best, you're just wasting time. Good luck!"
Entrepreneur,3drv49,GrantSEO,2,Sun Jul 19 03:30:24 2015 UTC,"Great advice!  So about the ""asking popular youtubers"" part, it doesnt seem like they might see your message in the millions of other messages they get. Would it be a good idea to start with smaller youtubers and work my way up?  I was at one time apart of the popular team ""Fyre UK"" who builds for some popular youtubers (CaptainSparklez is one of them, number 7 or something on the list of most subbed youtubers?) I learned a lot from them and they really contributed towards my skills. Unfortunately the branch of the team i was on came upon some problems and had to be retired. The amount of resources they had was unbelievable. To be fair, im fairly sure that building is their full time job (ive seen their builds go for 10k i believe) but competing against teams with those kinds of resources might be challenging. I think im psyching myself out thinking about competing with all these big guys. Its not like startups on here inmediately quit because they have to compete with amazon right? Sorry i trailed off a bit there, still somewhat relevant."
Entrepreneur,3drv49,GrantSEO,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:40:26 2015 UTC,"sure, you can do that, in addition to contacting the more popular guys. try a whole bunch of things, see what works.   Also, find your competitive advantage. Find what no one else is doing and see if you can do it better than anyone else possibly can. That means thinking outside the build. Don't underestimate in-person meetups and collabs.   Honestly, don't get ahead of yourself with comparing your little venture with the established guys. You said it yourself, you're not in their league, but that shouldn't stop you from doing what you think will benefit your busienss. Just do what you're doing now, really well, be open to new opportunities, and see where it takes you."
Entrepreneur,3drv49,Alarm420,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:04:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! I will see if i can get in contact with some people and maybe i can work something out.  I think i found my competative advantage although as my team grows, that will have to change. Right now i offer fair prices for small servers and provide quality builds. As we grow, more experienced teams somehow offer less for better (in comparison to the other big groups) so im hoping that not only my skills will improve but also my team will improve in both size and skill.  I always try to be open to new things especially build wise. I love giving and recieving critiques and tips on my builds (What could be improved, what looks good, etc.) I also think that i provide quality advice without tearing down their self esteem in building. I really think this gives me an advantage for things like youtube when i get more into that.  Thanks again for the tips!"
Entrepreneur,3drv49,wasted_brain,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:08:21 2015 UTC,"I love it. I'd suggest expanding into the server setup business as well. People will pay big bucks for professionals to find plugins, setup plugins, set regions, set permissions, etc."
