fatestaynight,3e3c4f,terminalikon,3,Tue Jul 21 17:14:07 2015 UTC,IIRC I believe Caster killed the master that would've participated and summoned Assassin and stole the command seals he had prior to his summon off-screen.

fatestaynight,3e3c4f,Wallywallsthe2nd,2,Tue Jul 21 17:26:02 2015 UTC,"Masters can be selected by the grail, but don't need to be. Remember Ryuunosuke, he wasn't selected as a master and received command seals until after he had summoned Caster. This is alluded to in the start of UBW when Kirei tells Rin five servants have been summoned so she needs to hurry up. At that point Rin had not been selected as a master since she had no wish, so if all the servants had been summoned before she had one she wouldn't be a master.  For Assassin, Caster just performed a summoning and got the servant and command seals as per the norm. As far as the grail was concerned she was the master, and that was that."

Tack on the time it'd probably take for an english translation to release and it's going to be at least 4 years.   They're also going to be changing the story around so it'd be like two different experiences. Nasu has also said that he dislikes his writing style back then too.

While the original definately shows it's age, it's a good story and the fact is I don't really trust Type Moon not to screw up the stories of the remake (In quite a few of them sex is a MUCH bigger deal than it was in Fate, similar to how it is in Heaven's Feel). Their track record with how they kind of just ham fistedly removed sex from HF (Again, not the sex scenes, but mentions of sex all together) kind of makes me fear what they're going to do with Tsukihime."

fatestaynight,3duakh,sBcNikita,14,Sun Jul 19 15:22:47 2015 UTC,"Probably a draw or a win for Rider, with Berserker winning only under very specific conditions.  Aerial Combat  The A10 goes faster than the chariot (560 km/h vs. 400 km/h). Therefore, Berserker outmanuvers Rider in air. But his weapons suck for aerial combat. From what I looked up, the A10 is only used for close and ground aerial combat, not dogfighting, and its weapons are either bombs or ground antiaircraft missiles, most of which do not have guidance systems. They do however go much faster than Rider's chariot.  Rider, on the other hand, is slower but much stronger (A+ NP vs. D), and would most likely win if they charge at each other unless it gets destroyed by missiles. Via Expungiato apparently travels 100m ""in an instant"", but it has to do it within around .63 seconds in order to keep up with the A10. It will, however, most likely destroy the A10 should it hit. We haven't seen how endurable the chariot is other than running through concrete, but it may be enough, while coupled with the lightning, to resist the missiles.  So basically, in order to for Berserker to win he has to realize that he cannot face the chariot head-on. He should keep a considerable amount of distance between himself and Rider while spamming rounds and missiles, hoping that they actually do something. Otherwise, his only hope is to outmaneuver and somehow manage to get onto the chariot while resisting the lightning and land a hit on Rider (which would probably take him out).  Why couldn't Berserker have an F15 like in F/Z? It would have been a much better matchup for him.  Berserker vs. Army  If Berserker has his A10 in Ionioi Hetairoi, it all depends on if the projectiles thrown by the Servants can reach the jet and damage it. If they can't (which I would assume so due to the A10's speed and altitude, as well as D-rank vs. potential E rank), Berserker has a much easier time of taking care of the army by bombing them. This is where the A10 shines with its vast arsenal of bombs. If they can, Berserker loses his jet and has to fight on ground. And all this time he still has to deal with Rider's chariot, unless the latter decides to not use it to save mana.   While grounded in Ionioi Hetairoi, Berserker would probably be able to defeat the soldiers like Madara vs. the Shinobi Alliance. He can steal any weapons and beat their original wielders within an instant, and arrows and javelins are no matter since we all saw what he did against Gilgamesh. Unfortunately for him not only does he have the weakness of mana drain but also Rider can still use Via Expugnatio, which would most surely seriously wound Berserker if not kill him, so basically Rider just has to use his soldiers as fodder and stall out enough time while attacking in his chariot. He might not want to sacrifice his soldiers however due to his nature, so Berserker could have a slight edge. The only way for Berserker to win is if Rider for some reason decides to hold off on using the chariot until all his soldiers die or refuses to let them die, then match Via one-on-one with Arondight, and nuke him before Kariya dies.   Or he could somehow instantly jump over to Rider and kill him. That works too.  If Ufotable had made this scene, F/Z would be /r/anime 's favorite show."

fatestaynight,3duakh,ieya404,8,Mon Jul 20 10:19:59 2015 UTC,"Sort of the whole 'point' of Berserker is that he is pretty much the perfect conventional warrior. He's so skilled he can fight even when crazy, he can use anything he gets his hands on perfectly, even better than it could be used, etc. The problem is that a conventional warrior can't defeat an entire army, no matter what they're armed with. Even with a souped up fighter plane, Berserker just doesn't have the power to kill thousands of soldiers, let alone survive when those thousands are trying to kill him back."

fatestaynight,3duakh,Wallywallsthe2nd,4,Sun Jul 19 18:19:26 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call a guy who can master any weapon (including heavy artillary) just by touching it conventional either.
fatestaynight,3duakh,AdelKoenig,0,Sun Jul 19 18:34:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think a man raised by faeries who   Defeated a fully armed knight with nothing but a branch Fought Gawain during the day when he was practically invincible to a standstill through sheer martial prowess and then wounded him at night Is plain considered a better fighter than the King of Knights, who trounced (an albeit weakened) Lancer herself Fought and defeated a dragon Can now turn anything he touches into a deadly Noble Phantasm   would be considered a ""conventional"" warrior either."
fatestaynight,3duakh,Reminnisce,4,Mon Jul 20 00:24:41 2015 UTC,"That's because you take conventional to refer to his skill level rather than how he fights. What I meant was, Lancelot fights like an ordinary person. When he grabs a metal pole, he doesn't warp causality with it or shoot castle leveling beams, he just beats the everloving hell out of you with it. He fights like a normal warrior, just the best one who ever lived.  Take your example about him beating Saber. He did it just straightforward sword skills and brawn. No special powers, no magic, just him being a better, stronger swordsman. He fights Gawain with, as you said, sheer martial prowess. Not some special skill that makes him invulnerable to his enemy's attacks or a magical weapon.  All Knight of Honor really does is let him use weapons he wouldn't have been able to otherwise. That metal pole of his would have been useless against a spiritual Servant. But when it's a (weak) Noble Phantasm, it can actually hurt them. The same is true for the plane. When he possess it, it still operates as a plane would. He runs out of missiles, if he wants to brake he has to work the flaps, etc."
fatestaynight,3duakh,Wallywallsthe2nd,0,Mon Jul 20 01:03:44 2015 UTC,"First, a conventional warrior can't jump on a plane and ride it like a horse while raining down weapons of mass destruction all around him.  Second, Berserker wouldn't even need to fight Rider's army on foot in the first place: that's what his plane is for. He doesn't have to wipe out the entirety of Rider's army, just enough for the reality marble to collapse (and that's if Rider can catch Berserker in it in the first place). Considering the A-10 is supposed to be a ground attack aircraft and can equip cluster bombs, inflicting enormous damage on a densely packed army while being out of range of the army by nature of being an aircraft hundreds or thousands of feet above the air would be simple.  Third, Berserker's Knight of Honor can modify the A-10 to become extra deadly (like how he turned the F-15's flares to become mini-bombs that took down Gilgamesh's Vimana). To what degree is uncertain, but if there's any way at all to knock Rider off his Gordius Wheel, it's all over for Rider."

fatestaynight,3duakh,Firnin,2,Sun Jul 19 15:40:54 2015 UTC,"I think the question here is: can thrown javelins from the Ionian Hetairoi soldiers do anything to a Berzerker'd A-10? If they can, Berzerker looses. A single A-10 cannot take on an entire army, especially by Hellenestic-era standards, and certainly not in 20 minutes. Berzerker will need to divide his attention between the army and Via Expugnatio, and he can't afford to do that."
fatestaynight,3duakh,Spartan448,2,Sun Jul 19 16:01:16 2015 UTC,I would assume that the A10 can go higher than the range of the javelins. But yeah he does have a really bad matchup in this scenario.
fatestaynight,3duakh,DavisWuhu,5,Sun Jul 19 16:03:59 2015 UTC,"Hell, as far as matchups go, Rider is Berserker's natural enemy. That means that in all of Fate Zero, Rider is the best suited to kicking his ass."

Shiki, both of them, CAN kill Servants with the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception. Servants exist within the bounds of Gaia and interact with the world. It doesn't mean Shiki is CAPABLE of killing one. He would never get close enough to Gilgamesh, Lancer would Gae Bolg him, Saber would Excaliblast him and so on. Its more of a case of him having a potential to do something that will very likely never happen."
fatestaynight,3dtyyk,KingofGrapes7,4,Sun Jul 19 13:20:14 2015 UTC,"I've seen lots of discussions about whether or not he can actually kill him, thing is, even without their noble phantasms they're much faster than humans so they would kill him before he would raise his knife.  Edit: I forgot to mention that Ryougi Shiki can actually kill servants since it was stated in Fate/Extra that she had killed 99 and needed 100 to escape the moon cell. Even without that, Word of God has stated that Void Shiki can fight servants defensively."
fatestaynight,3dtyyk,KingofGrapes7,3,Sun Jul 19 13:26:30 2015 UTC,"I take Extra with some salt due to the fact it was a bonus boss. You never know, of course, but if Void Shiki can only fight defensively I don't see how normal Shiki could outright beat Servants.  But beyond that yea Tohno wouldn't stand much of a chance. He probably could take out an Assassin or Caster under the right conditions and Heroic Spirit. Otherwise he would need to use the Tohno Gland to woo a female Servant for his life."
fatestaynight,3dtyyk,zodiac21,2,Sun Jul 19 14:22:49 2015 UTC,"I rationalized to myself that the Shiki in Extra is kind of like if she was given Servant-like stats and could move at supersonic speeds like they do. In that case, she'd be absurdly strong since she could essentially ""kill"" NP and their effects (exceptions like Ea should exist though)."
fatestaynight,3dtyyk,Goldreaver,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:26:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that'd work. What people often forget is that servans are powered by Gaia. So, not only they're at their prime, but they're stronger than they were.  I imagine that if Saber could excaliblast his way out of every problem, she wouldn't have lost so many people. Then again, maybe her enemies also had bullshit magical powers (like Mordred)"
fatestaynight,3dtyyk,aztbeel,2,Mon Jul 20 15:26:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, Servants are not humans, nor are they the historical figure they are summoned from.

fatestaynight,3dtyyk,KingofGrapes7,3,Sun Jul 19 23:03:17 2015 UTC,"Tohno's maybe, now that I think of it I think I did see that somewhere. Ryougi is more attuned to the Eyes so she would probably be the Shiki to kill Servants. At the very least the Eyes themselves can kill Servants and are limited by the possessor."

I'm not saying you're wrong about the Eyes being able to work on them. In theory, with the right wielder, they would. But with Shiki, they would not.

That being said, the reviewer should have touched on the characterization issue more, as this along with the pacing was UBW's main flaws. I get all the praise that he/she put in, but they didn't do much else.  Actually now that I think about it the review didn't really talk about much at all. Here's basically what they said.   UBW is the best adaptation of F/SN so far (yeah, cuz you can only compare to DEEN) It looks good. Shirou was portrayed well (debatable) Rin looks cool Apparently only Caster's story and the F/Z link weaken the anime. Apparently these points make it a 9/10.   Because they didn't provide that much actual reviewing and more of just what they saw, it's not the strongest review. I think they could have elaborated much more on the things they touched upon."

The DEEN anime is horrible and lets just pretend it doesn't exist. It attemps to adapt the first route of the visual novel, but doesn't do a good job of it .   The UBW anime only adapts 1 out of three routes, and it sorta misses out characterization bits.   So to experience all three routes, read the visual novel in this order : Fate, then UBW, and then HF. Its important to read it in this order, don't skip Fate, nor go directly to HF."

fatestaynight,3dpf9h,AdelKoenig,2,Sat Jul 18 04:52:15 2015 UTC,"I'm still a bit confused by this.  You wouldn't refer to a magus as a magician because essentially what they do is create spells that can be replicated by scientific means. In order for their magecraft to be classified as True Magic, it would have to be something science is unable to achieve.  Aren't their spells sort of called mysteries due to them being thaumaturgical work by a magus' family lineage? I mean, because the magecraft themselves are finite and therefore best left unshared due to the spell weakening when it is being used or known by more than the magus who created it.  I'm still unsure if magic is still just called magic really because of True Magic."
fatestaynight,3dpf9h,AdelKoenig,2,Sat Jul 18 05:13:24 2015 UTC,"If you see the word magic, assume they mean magecraft unless it is called Magic or the context suggests they are talking about one of the 5  Sorceries.  They wiki defaults to the terms Magic and magecraft."

""Because I know Sorcery is what they call True Magic as well. So I was questioning whether every time they mention magic in the VN, they were actually calling it something else like magecraft, thaumaturgy, mystery, or whatever.""  These are most likely transalation errors, magecraft is sometimes referred as a mystery, which it does not really fit. All of this depends on the context:   Are they talking about 5 types of true magic or magecraft that anyone with a magic circuits can learn.

fatestaynight,3dl4k3,peep295,2,Fri Jul 17 23:04:26 2015 UTC,"I was a bit too impaitent with all the voices, so unless it was a climix or Taiga's VA talking. I skipped through the voices and just read. I did all the routes, bad ends, and extra and clocked in around <50hrs.

fatestaynight,3dl4k3,Ziebell,3,Fri Jul 17 07:13:24 2015 UTC,"I haven't read Rewrite or Little Busters, but people I know have and they say Fate is not that much longer than they are. My own times where around 30 hours per route, but I usually waited for the voices and took a lot of breaks in-between. The time it takes will really change from person to person, but I can say for sure you  won't regret it one bit."
fatestaynight,3dl4k3,Officer_Catbutt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:51:45 2015 UTC,I've heard that each route is ~15 hours but I've re-read it and stampcollected so much that I can't stand as a reference.
fatestaynight,3dl4k3,i6i,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:31:23 2015 UTC,"I think measuring reading something in hours is bizarre quite frankly, one route is about as long as an average harry potter book. You should read the first one and if you've seen UBW you can skip scenes that are sounding too familiar- generally it's good to get Shirou's take on the situation since the anime doesn't really portray how much he tends to secretly agree with Archer very well."
fatestaynight,3dl4k3,Just_A_Djoker,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:04:14 2015 UTC,"Each route in FSN took me an average of about fifteen hours - but I read quickly, and did bother to listen to the voice acting all the way through.  Specifically, for the three routes, it was: Fate - 18 hours.  UBW - 14 hours.  HF - 16 hours.  UBW is worth reading - the anime omitted some scenes and didn't develop Shirou well due to a lack of his monologues.  Seeing the development of Shirou in UBW is central to the impact of HF.  It's also by far the shortest route, which helps when reading it."
fatestaynight,3dlc00,BasedLint,11,Fri Jul 17 05:02:33 2015 UTC,Fate/Hollow Ataraxia or Tsukihime. The one you didn't choose in 1. Carnival Phantasm Prisma Ilya   This would be the optimal way to watch it in my opinion. Carnival Phantasm builds upon F/SN and Tsukihime and has a OVA featuring characters from F/HA. Because the Prisma Ilya anime isn't finished yet (I don't know about the manga) I would save it for last. Hope it helped!
fatestaynight,3dlc00,Officer_Catbutt,2,Fri Jul 17 06:24:29 2015 UTC,After reading Tsukihime should I watch the anime adaptation? Because I've seen mixed opinions about it
fatestaynight,3dlc00,Officer_Catbutt,4,Fri Jul 17 06:41:52 2015 UTC,I saw the DEEN anime and thought it was meh. I also saw the Tsukihime anime and dropped it after the first episode. I would not recommend it in a million years.
fatestaynight,3dlc00,Ziebell,4,Fri Jul 17 10:14:45 2015 UTC,"What anime adaptation? There is no anime adaptation at all.  Seriously though I've also been interested in watching it, but it seems the consensus is that it's worse than the DEEN UBW."

fatestaynight,3dlc00,farispie,9,Fri Jul 17 07:07:12 2015 UTC,There is no Tsukihime anime
fatestaynight,3dlc00,Nocorras,2,Fri Jul 17 07:11:29 2015 UTC,Its a common and very very very old joke amongst the Type-Moon fandom that there is no Tsukihime anime- since its so bad that people pretend it doesn't exist.
fatestaynight,3dlc00,TheFissureMan,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:12:49 2015 UTC,Tsukihime anime is probably fine if you haven't read the VN.  If you've read the VN it's  not good (characters aren't the same and stuff)
fatestaynight,3dlc00,Ziebell,7,Sat Jul 18 16:06:23 2015 UTC,Definitely read Tsukihime before Carnival Phantasm.
fatestaynight,3dlc00,doctorpavelheer,4,Fri Jul 17 05:11:43 2015 UTC,"Listen to this man/woman/idk. If you watch Carnival Phantasm before playing Tsukihime, you'll only get half the jokes, but even so it is still fun..."
fatestaynight,3dlc00,wertoo4,6,Fri Jul 17 06:19:55 2015 UTC,Notes? Short and cool.
fatestaynight,3dlc00,noodlesandrice1,2,Fri Jul 17 05:07:15 2015 UTC,"You can read F/HA and then watch Fate/Kaleid (so you understand all the references) or move on to Fate/Kaleid directly. Since you've read all the F/SN VN and Zero you'll definitely understand enough to enjoy it, but having read F/HA would just add to the experience. The third season of Fate/Kaleid starts airing on the 26th, I think it is the perfect time to get into the series before the new season."
fatestaynight,3dlc00,Nocorras,3,Fri Jul 17 19:50:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah i'm going to do it this way, HA > Kaleid > then eventually Tsukihime and Carnival Phantasm"
fatestaynight,3dka7x,rmm45177,6,Thu Jul 16 23:19:02 2015 UTC,"The Anime? It more spoils HA than HF by the existence of another character; I don't think it's quite at the point where the Kaleid anime covers concepts that are relevant to HF (As it's about half way through the second Kaleid series).  With that in mind, I'm not sure how much spoiling there is, outside of ""Hey, this concept exists."" Kaleid has some very awesome battles, but the anime isn't at them yet (And it's... a very fan servicy show/manga for the lolicon crowd).  Might as well hold off, because it needs to get to the end of the second series/into the third series before it gets worth reading."
fatestaynight,3dka7x,FurbyTime,7,Fri Jul 17 00:40:46 2015 UTC,I would hold off on watching it just to understand some of the references to the Servants and the Grail

fatestaynight,3dka7x,zodiac21,3,Fri Jul 17 00:53:39 2015 UTC,"It more references things than spoils. If I were you, I'd put it off until you finish HF just so that you can get the references and enjoy it more =]"
fatestaynight,3dka7x,KissKiss2wei,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:05:33 2015 UTC,"The anime doesn't really spoil anything plot related to the other routes yet. The further you go into the manga (around 3rei) the more prior knowledge to other fate routes is advised and thus the more it would spoil. But as I said, the anime isn't there yet.  The only thing you'll see now in the anime are alternate universe versions of characters from other routes. After all it is an alternative universe where the other fate routes don't exist. So the characters from other routes are there but their role in Fate/Kaleid is different from their 'original' route.   If you find that too much of a spoil, then you probably shouldn't watch Fate/Kaleid. But personally I don't think Fate/Kaleid anime would ruin your HF or F/HA experience at all, even if it shows a little bit of characters, it is really a minor thing."
fatestaynight,3dka7x,wertoo4,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:42:19 2015 UTC,I have only seen UBW and Zero and have read about halfway through the Fate VN. My friend is a super HFphile and cussed me out for watching Zero because of what it spoils but we're watching Kaleid together and he hasn't mentioned anything in regards to it spoiling HF and I feel like he would if it did...so I think you're good mate!

Other fate-unrelated anime recommendations by me that you might enjoy:   Psycho-Pass Kara no Kyoukai movie series (part of the Nasuverse as mentioned earlier) Steins;Gate Parasyte Zetsuen no Tempest Neon Genesis Evangelion + End of Evangelion movie Monster Code Geass Shinsekai Yori   Anyway, do whatever encites you the most and enjoy!"
fatestaynight,3dilb4,RIvkyn,-1,Thu Jul 16 16:49:34 2015 UTC,"If you can put up with the gay stuff in one episode of the last one (Shin Sekai Yori) you're in for a fantastic story with some great twists and a fantastically executed villain  Same for Monster only without the gay stuff but the ending may not appeal to some ( I wont say anymore about it though...)  Parasyte is an odd one.It's a little bit of a lesson in morality to put it simply (but with aliens and action).Bit of Body-horror but nowhere near Evangelion levels... most of the time... ok some of the time.Fairly grounded in reality so don't expect anything too crazy.  Steins Gate takes a bit of time to get going but once the pieces are set up you should be in for a good time.It's an interesting story filled with Time Travel,a Hammy Mad Scientist, and bananas disgusting bananas.....It's way less weird than it sounds.  as for the first (Psycho-pass) and fourth (NGE) to last I find both to be a little overrated but if you can deal with craziness and pseudo-philosophy then you should be fine.Now if you want something deeply philosophical and can deal with older looking animation then I'd direct you to Kino's Journey instead.  If you like F/Z then Kara no Kyoukai might as well be seen as the Tsukihime equivalent of that (not part of tsukihime but a parallell world still counts I guess). AMAZING PRODUCTION VALUES,great action, good story telling, and plenty of magic related phenomenon.A little dialogue heavy but nothing too serious.  Code Geass is the only mecha on this list and features an interesting story but somewhat distracting proportions.A must watch for any anime fan looking or a good anime nonetheless.  Is that all...oh yeah right Blast of Tempest.a Nice action anime from the one and only studio bones but I don't think I would recommenced.If you want something of bones to enjoy then I would try Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood as a substitute."

fatestaynight,3dilb4,TheIllogicalSandwich,2,Thu Jul 16 15:57:26 2015 UTC,"Since you're asking in general about viewing material and not the Fate franchise I'll answer to what you're actually asking for. I'm guessing you're not interested in reading the Visual Novel, which is completely fine. VNs are not for everyone, me neither since I haven't read Stay Night myself.   Disclaimer: I know the entire story through a friend who read it.  If you want more viewing material from the Fate franchise there isn't much but you can check out:   Fate/Prototype - A 13 minute OVA about what Stay Night's story was originally going to be. Here's a link to the entire thing on youtube. Carnival Phantasm - This is a parody show about everything made by Type Moon (the company that created Fate/Stay Night among other things). It is extremely funny but even more so if you are familiar with their other work and not just Fate. The opening is pretty awesome. Heaven's Feel - This is going to be a movie (movies?) animated by the same studio, Ufotable, who animated Zero and UBW. It's an adaption of the route in the Visual Novel under the same name. Basically it's an alternate story of what could happen in Stay Night focusing on Sakura. It's being made at the moment and will come out maybe next year with a teaser trailer already released.   Other ""dark-ish philosophical"" anime you might wanna check out:   Ergo Proxy - Dystopian Sci-Fi with an ending that's open to interpretation. Here's a fan-made trailer. Elfen Lied - A very depressing story about supernatural girls being experimented on by scientists. It's dark, it's bloody and it's dramatic. The theme is freaking beautiful. Mirai Nikki - Another fucked up death game anime, but with a very interesting concept. A group of people compete using ""Future diaries"" that can predict the future in different ways to try to murder each other. The winner will become the new god of time and space. The protagonist is a boy name Yuki but the real star of the anime is our favorite crazy yandere Yuno seen multiple times in the opening.   Hope this answers your question and provides sufficient viewing material."
fatestaynight,3dilb4,Fadroh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:57:56 2015 UTC,NEVER EVER EVER recommend Elfen Lied to anyone.Maybe the theme but NEVER the anime.The thing starts out interesting enough but quickly devolves into a fanservice filled story where the one good character loses all character traits and becomes a near brain dead shadow of herself.

Not much to do but find one with subs i'm afraid. In the meantime, I'd recommend a legal streaming site like crunchyroll if you do intend to watch it.At least that way you can support the creators in some way."
fatestaynight,3dkqlo,Fadroh,2,Fri Jul 17 02:08:03 2015 UTC,"Not really. CR pays for a one-time license to stream the content, anime studios do not get royalties from CR- only BDs."

fatestaynight,3dkqlo,Fadroh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:06:32 2015 UTC,"Since the English side is already covered, I'll take the Spanish side.  Legally, Crunchyroll would be the only way to watch UBW with Spanish subs (and I'm not even sure they have the license to stream it to all Spanish-speaking territories). Other than that, you're out of luck. The only place where UBW might get licensed is Spain, and a license there is currently nowhere in sight.  You picked the wrong place to ask for downloads though, as most people will probably guide you to the legal path. But honestly, downloads aren't exactly hard to find. Google is your friend."

These are three separate stories, on parallel timelines, with sequential themes. All endings are canon, even the Bad Ends.     1st Route - Fate   Theme: ""Oneself as an ideal""   This path is both an introduction route and Saber's route. In Fate we are given most of the god-tier world-building the author Nasu is known for.  It also tells the complete story about Saber, who she is and what she is after by taking part in the war.   2nd Route - Unlimited Blade Works (UBW)   Theme: ""Struggling with oneself as an ideal""   This is both the Archer and Tohsaka Rin route. Most of the mysteries left unanswered in the Fate scenario are revealed and things start to go very ""wrong"" in this route.  The reveals in UBW makes you re-think everything you knew about the previous story.   3rd Route - Heaven's Feel (HF)   Theme: ""The friction with real and ideal""   This is both the conclusion act and Matou Sakura's Route. The increasing development of Emiya Shirou's character reaches its final act.  If you thought things went wrong in UBW, this route laughs at it and redefines what the word ""wrong"" means."

fatestaynight,3dfota,Lightbringer20,2,Thu Jul 16 03:05:54 2015 UTC,"I posted this in a previous thread after having had the chance to view the screening of the episode 3 dub:   Saber, Kirei, Illya, and Gil were great. Illya actually gave me chills several times since I thought Stephanie Sheh sounded very convincing as an aristocratic little girl out for blood. If David Vincent's performance as Gil remains consistent throughout the entire show, then I feel that it will be better than his performance in F/Z. Bryce Papenbrook as Shirou will still take some getting used to for me, but his performance itself was pretty good and I'm optimistic that he'll be able to do Shirou justice despite the unfitting voice. Kaiji Tang still sounds like a miscast to me since I've been spoiled by Suwabe and O'Brien. He would be great as someone else, but his take on Archer is currently difficult for me to accept. I'm still not fond of Mela Lee as Rin.   As for this topic:   Cristina Vee as Sakura: I'm very ecstatic over this choice, particularly when I recall her performance in the Madoka Magica Rebellion movie. I'm very excited to hear her in HF and I think it was the perfect choice. Meagan Hollingshead as Caster: I agree that it was a near perfect choice. Her voice will fit very well and will make for a convincing Caster. Julie Ann Taylor as Taiga: Solid choice. Tony Oliver as Lancer: Decent choice. No complaints. Todd Haberkorn as Assassin: I'm skeptical, but we'll see.   I have no opinions on the rest as of yet."
fatestaynight,3dfota,ShadowCrossZero,2,Wed Jul 15 23:09:37 2015 UTC,"Well from the episode they showed at Anime Expo I can't say I was impressed, but then again it's a dubbed version. At times Rin's lines sounded so forced they lose the original impact they had. And I don't like that wispy edge Illya's English voice had either, but the actress at least did a good job keeping it relatively close to the original."

I don't expect it to compared to the original of course, but just the way Rin's English VN delivers it comes out... kind of flat? It just doesn't sound very natural to me. Of course this is just one small snippet out of many, and I'm hoping that the final result will be considerbly better."
fatestaynight,3dfota,OkamiTenrou,2,Thu Jul 16 02:19:42 2015 UTC,"Oh I get it now. Yeah, she's kind of forcing it, like, she didn't put any soul into it haha."

Todd as Assassin, I was expecting him to be Shinji, but I still think he can pull it off like when he was Izumo in Project K (I'm actually glad he wasn't the VA for Shinji because that would've been as awkward as when he was that rapist from Sword Art Online)"

Any dub I've heard that's been under Tony Oliver's direction has been great (From Fate/Zero to Gurren Lagann).   Shinji's actor has been on a rise lately after the Durarara x2 dub, his role in that has him as sort of bad guy (not to Shinji's level though) so I think he can pull it off."

From the wiki:   Artoria led Britain from Camelot, and after becoming a feudal lord like her father, she became a king with many knights under her, including the esteemed Knights of the Round Table. Her growth stopped at that time she pulled the sword because of its magic, so many knights feared it as ominous. Most instead praised their master's immortality as divine. Her battles thereafter were the acts of a god of war. She always led from the front, and no enemies could stand in her way. There was no defeat for a body admired as a dragon in human form. She only knew victory for ten years and twelve battles while she ran through those days as the king. She never turned back and was never disgraced. She was raised as a king and fulfilled her obligations as the king. Personal affairs  Due to the problem of being able to produce an heir, Merlin used magecraft to turn her into a pseudo-male capable of producing sperm for an unknown duration of time.[7] During this period, she was enchanted by her sister, Morgan le Fay, who took some of Artoria's sperm, developed it within her own ovaries, and gave birth to the homunculus and complete clone of Artoria, Mordred. She was born and raised without Artoria's knowledge, quickly growing up due to her accelerated aging, and she managed to join the Round Table through her own efforts and Morgan's recommendation. She worshiped her king while hiding her identity, and she was ecstatic to learn of her heritage.    The actual source is in Fate/Side Material."

What do you mean by that? Did its popularity cause the translation to be rushed or do you mean that it was a bad introduction to VNs for new players? Or something else?  As in, the translation is honestly a mess, but so many people have played it in spite of this that TakaJun's clunky literal writing has kind of been canonized as the de facto example of what Nasu's prose is like, when it's really not even remotely similar.  I guess to put it more concretely... you can find tons and tons of people talking about the bad writing in Fate, right? It comes up a lot. Pretty much all of the stuff they complain about (beyond it having too many infodumps/cooking segments, I guess) is more a result of the translation than anything Nasu did to begin with, though. I don't think the original Fate is a masterpiece either, but it bothers me to see so many people treating the pretty questionable translation as a valid basis for leveling criticism at the writing itself.  Anyone who read TakaJun's translation back in the day and now knows Japanese - seriously, check out something by Nasu in the original Japanese, I think you'll be very surprised by the way he writes. Nasu's writing is often decried as feeling amateurish by Japanese fans, I won't try to cover that up, but at the very least he has a unique sensibility for the way things are phrased and an instantly recognizable style. I feel like it would be more productive to talk about the vision behind Nasu's writing and the ways he's improved over the years than simply make fun of hurr durr mollusks forever, but that's never going to happen unless someone produces a decent translation of his writing... which I don't see happening any time soon.  Also, just in terms of being hard to translate, Nasu really loves stylistic furigana and has (IMO) a talent for effectively using furigana to give sentences multiple meanings and nuances. I don't think any of the current translations of his stuff really convey this, but then again I'm not sure if it's even possible to adapt this to English sensibly...  Finally, just on a basic level, I kinda hate it that a mediocre translation is the only way people have to enjoy something as high profile and influential as Fate. Like, the fans deserve better and the game itself deserves better too.  Hopefully that answers your question.  sauce: http://ask.fm/moogy0/answer/113221579220  And yeah, it's fucking Moogy, but whatever."

fatestaynight,3dbj5c,promek,6,Wed Jul 15 02:10:00 2015 UTC,"I am no author but Nasu's writing is different from you average novel writer from your book store. His writing is simple yet you are able to get the feel of the story, and the characters. Unlike other writers he focused on different aspects of the fight. Unlike the usual were the author described the immense pain he using one word over and over, simple but effective. His description of the universe and connecting events of different stories is something that other authors hard to do, especially on the scale of Nasu. Though others may find him drawing out the technical things and simplifing the straight forward thing tedious. I find his writing style to be refreshing especially the fights scenes, enough words to hype you up but not enough to bore you. Don't even start on the h scenes, he didn't want them."

There's no way Doctor Fate would be improved by becoming Caster, or Superman by becoming whatever class he'd be.  The only heroes that would really become stronger would be the street tier heroes, like Green Arrow, some of the members of the Bat family, Black Canary, Huntress, and a few others."
fatestaynight,3d63pu,idiotsonfire,4,Mon Jul 13 21:35:44 2015 UTC,"How good do you think Batman would be as a Heroic Spirit? His abilities would be pretty damn high, and iirc, Bruce Wayne is supposed to have the highest physical capabilities a human could achieve.  Not sure what's in his arsenal that would be good as Noble Phantasms. The Batmobile could qualify him as a Rider, or his battle tactics could qualify him as an Assassin with high presence concealment."
fatestaynight,3d63pu,idiotsonfire,4,Mon Jul 13 21:58:52 2015 UTC,"It'd be really hard to tell, frankly, Batman ranges so widely in strength from author to author from lifting four hundred pounds to being able to lift a thousand pounds over his head easily.  The batsuit has a wide range as well, but he might make a decent rider, but I genuinely think one of the other Bat family members would be better for it.  Batman himself is too much of a jack-of-all-trades for a specific Servant class."
fatestaynight,3d63pu,Fadroh,3,Mon Jul 13 22:03:42 2015 UTC,Role wise  Superman becomes the first hero with a negative magic resistance stat.Good Berserker candidate if you take him from another universe (Superman-Prime maybe?).  Etrigan may also be a nice Berserker.  Wonderwoman becomes a competent Saber.  Batman becomes Rider or something because honestly he can't be Assassin.  Maybe Red hood could be a good Assassin though.  Zatanna is Caster through and through.  Robin/Nightwing as Lancer?....probably the few heroes with a staff of some sort.  and Green Arrow as Archer...because he's an archer  But to be clear most good dc heroes would lose power as servants

fatestaynight,3d63pu,upads,2,Mon Jul 13 22:20:43 2015 UTC,IMO every hero during the lifetime do not have magic resistance as high as servants. The Grail grant them magic resistance according to class so shoes might as well as get some.
fatestaynight,3d63pu,Azraeleon,2,Tue Jul 14 00:22:21 2015 UTC,"but half of them have very little, or none.   The fact is Supes starts off on the wrong foot. He's already ludicrously weak to magic.  Also this is different to the Magic Resistance of say, Saber. She isn't already weak to it, she just has, essentially, extra MAG defense. While Supes is essentially allergic to magic. just being in a universe that relies on it (which the nasuverse is practically built on it), is enough to weaken him incredibly.   But I'm committed to this now, and want to nail down 7 servants. There are some obvious choices (Green Arrow = Archer for example) but others are more difficult. So here's my list, what do ya'll think?  Saber - Wonder Woman. Call me cliche for having a female Saber as always, but Diana is fairly fitting of the general character tropes seen in Sabers, and she's one of the only Justice League members who actually utilizes a sword at times.  Archer - Green Arrow. I know it's tacky and predictable, but hey, at least one archer should actually be an Archer. Plus can you imagine how amplified his skills would be with the class stat-boost? He'd be awesome!  Lancer - Nightwing. Partly because of the aesthetic of the staff, mostly because Nightwing is too good for his own good, just like our beloved Irishmen.  Rider - the Flash. Can I get away with that? Flash's whole thing is his ability to travel, so Rider kinda works. Be pretty happy to change this one though.  Caster - Green Lantern! The power ring is basically magic anyway...  Berserker - Superman. This is assuming he takes an MK vs. DC style power drop thanks to his magic weakness. But Berserk Supes would be awesome  Assassin - Batman. I originally had him as Rider because of how iconic his vehicles are, but he just suits the Assassin class way better.

fatestaynight,3d78mk,Zeromaxx,8,Tue Jul 14 01:47:31 2015 UTC,You are probably talking about the DEEN adaptation of 2006 ( Should be obvious which is ) and the 2014/15 Ufotable adaptation of Fate UBW. The first one tries to adapt the 3 routes of the VN. The second one adapts only the second route. (UBW) For more info : New to Fate?
fatestaynight,3d78mk,ElPsyCongroo204,6,Tue Jul 14 02:04:46 2015 UTC,Aaaaaannnndddddddd I answered my own question.  Thanks for the help!
fatestaynight,3d78mk,ElPsyCongroo204,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:32:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah. It looks dated, especially the animation but for 2006 it was pretty good (IMO the static images still looks good).  The dylemma with the DEEN adaptation ( Do not confund with the UBW movie from DEEN [Avoid that] ) is that is the only anime that dives into the Fate route of the VN ( Focus on Saber) but it also touches in some aspects of the other routes making a cluster of spoilers for other better adaptations ( Like the new UBW and the upcoming HF ).  For maximun backgroud about FS/N it is recommended to play the Fate route of the VN. ( That way you will experience Fate route without spoiling events of the UBW and HF routes) My recommendation: VN Fate route > UBW UFO Anime > HF Movies .... If you need more Fate in your system (Most probable) watch now the DEEN adaptation. It has incredibly good soundtrack. Watch Dillusion opening and tell me watch you think."
fatestaynight,3d78mk,farispie,4,Tue Jul 14 02:52:11 2015 UTC,"The best way to start with the fate franchise in either case, is to read the visual novel first."
fatestaynight,3d78mk,SPNRaven,2,Tue Jul 14 03:23:18 2015 UTC,"You may have accidentally watched Fate/Stay Night and not Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works.

There is a movie with the same title so be careful you don't watch that :)"
fatestaynight,3d6ivq,sasinuka,7,Mon Jul 13 22:24:54 2015 UTC,"Well, telling you that is not enough would be saying that the series wasnt adapting well enough the source material and therefore the series is bad but ... that is not the true. With the series you have the ability to comprehend HF but with the collection of choices and bad ends in the VN helps to develop even further the characters. So if you dont mind missing a some content go ahead with HF but remember that when you finish HF and come back to UBW route, it  wont be the same. And it is the the original source of Fate, once it is over, is over."
fatestaynight,3d6ivq,ElPsyCongroo204,2,Mon Jul 13 22:34:12 2015 UTC,"Ah, that bit at the end convinced me haha. I love the idea behind f/sn so much I read the translated volumes of f/apocrypha. Thanks everyone!"
fatestaynight,3d6ivq,Azraeleon,7,Mon Jul 13 22:46:32 2015 UTC,"It depends who you ask. I feel the UFO adaptation is enough to tell you the whole story, provided you have an appreciation for Shirou's character, be it from reading the Fate route or whatever.   However, most people on here will tell you to just read the VN, and honestly, it is worth it."
fatestaynight,3d6ivq,farispie,6,Mon Jul 13 22:29:54 2015 UTC,"Either way, have you read the fate route ? If not, you need to read that to appreciate HF. Also, I personally find that the anime didn't do a completely good job with Shirou's character (which is kinda lost without his monologues), so I say read the UBW route after reading the Fate route. Understanding Shirou is important for the HF route.  Besides the UBW route has alternative bad endings that you can read that will be completely new content for you. Plus there's always the good end."
fatestaynight,3d6ivq,upads,2,Mon Jul 13 22:33:01 2015 UTC,"Yes. The theme of HF is ""atonement"" and ""sacrifise"". Without understand the weight of Shirou's ideals and how much it means to him from UBW, the readers/watchers won't understand how much Shirou has sacrificed for his woman."

fatestaynight,3d3g51,royaldocks,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:41:56 2015 UTC,"Six episodes is approximately two and a half hours, and UBW's major failing in my eyes was the stretched out finale, so they could probably fit the entirety of HF into three movies (or 18-20 episodes) if they trimmed some of less important scenes (parts of the beginning could definitely be cut, since it's expected that the audience has already seen it in UBW).   That said, it seems just as likely that they might split HF up into five or so shorter movies for the sake of better pacing, a la Kara no Kyoukai. Not sure where they'd split each part up, though."
fatestaynight,3d3g51,Flatiron_Bonfire,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:48:47 2015 UTC,"I agree to an extent on UBW, but I think three movies for HF would have the opposite problem, which would be too rushed. In adaptions the key is typically finding a balance between a rushed series and too much filler.  It's been awhile since I've read the vn so I can't really remember, but I remember HF being considerably long, perhaps longer so than UBW. It's a bit difficult for me to compare the length and pacing of a film series vs. a novel/tv series, but would you say Kara no Kyoukai is longer than the Heaven's Feel route in the vn? I haven't read the light novels of KnK by the way.  I definitely think the could trim a lot of the stuff up until Shirou summons Saber. They spent 45 minutes on it in UBW, I'd say in the films it'll have to take less than ~20 minutes. This is also assuming they'll skip the prologue since it was already in UBW, plus the main reason for it being in UBW was the focus on Tohsaka as the main heroine."
fatestaynight,3d3g51,zodiac21,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:03:05 2015 UTC,"Would it really though? If you rewatch the first season of UBW, most of it is honestly not important and has to do with Shirou's daily life. You can cut out a lot of scenes with Sakura descending into madness cuz there's like fifty of those scenes, so I think HF would be able to fit into either two long movies or three medium-length ones.  btw yes, KnK is much, much longer than HF"
fatestaynight,3d0kgy,sBcNikita,12,Sun Jul 12 14:25:14 2015 UTC,"ROUND ONE: I gotta give this one to Medea. Gilles de Rais' summons can take a hell of a lot of punishment and would prevent Caster from getting close enough to use Rule Breaker to dispel Gilles' practically infinite mana source, but Medea's spell casting vastly outstrips Gilles' even with his grimoire. After a while I think Medea would use her High-Speed Divine Language to outpace Gilles' own spell work (or lack thereof) and find a way around his horde of mini-Cthulhu. Of course, it should be noted that we haven't really seen Medea while she is underpowered and not leeching mana on her home turf, so I don't think it's unreasonable to call this one for Gilles, but looking at their stats I think Medea's A+ rank mana will allow her to hold out long enough to find a way around his army or out cast anything Gilles can attempt with Prelati's Spellbook.  ROUND 2: This one is tricky. On her home turf Medea is able to perform an incredible level of magical spells at incredibly fast speeds. She could probably fire off twenty deathrays in the blink of an eye. However, Gilles' giant floppy thing is no laughing matter. Rider's entire Reality Marble did nothing but buy the remaining heroic spirits time to develop a plan for Saber to use Excaliber. While it may be possible to fire off enough spells to outpace it's regenerative abilities, and Medea will be flying and warping around willy-nilly to hit it from all angles, I just don't think it's possible for her to do so. It took probably one of the most powerful and recognizable anti-fortress noble phantasms to bring it down in the form of Excaliber, and I don't think Magecraft even at Medea's highest level of power and speed will be able to make up that much of a power gap. Eventually either the giant Cthulu monster will get in a lucky hit or the city will just run out of mana for her to drain.  TL;DR: Don't underestimate Bluebeard's enormous floppy thing."
fatestaynight,3d0kgy,Aero121,3,Sun Jul 12 16:37:20 2015 UTC,One doubt is that Medea would run out of mana the first second she enters combat...
fatestaynight,3d0kgy,upads,3,Sun Jul 12 18:12:29 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly not very concerned about that. While her Rain of Light death beams take up the same amount of energy as three times Shirou's maximum capacity, there are a few things to bear in mind about her combat.   As has been said, spamming Rain of Light for any duration uses an amount of Mana roughly equivalent to Saber activating Excalibur- an obviously suicidal move. I doubt she would rely extensively on such an inefficient form of magecraft without a huge reserve of mana backing her up. Medea's mana ranking is an A+, surpassing Saber's C rank quite handily. As such, if Saber can still maintain form however shakily after using Excalibur in Fate I think this shouldn't be a problem if Caster expends her mana wisely."
fatestaynight,3d0kgy,Aero121,4,Sun Jul 12 19:40:15 2015 UTC,"It's all a question of prep time. Medea as we see her is capable of blasting Gilles away, but we only ever see her in action after she's spent weeks amassing a huge store of mana to use. If we take Round 1 to be where neither of them have time to prepare for battle, Gilles will win by default when Medea dies from mana exhaustion a minute in, since she would have no leech mana or connection to the ley line to draw on. And if we did give them the prep time to be at their best, Gilles' Cthulhu can take anything Medea can dish out and keep on coming, so he wins round 2 as well. The only way Medea can claim a victory (outside of sneaky shenanigans that she is so good at) is to have the fight be unbalanced in her favor from the beginning."
fatestaynight,3d0kgy,Wallywallsthe2nd,3,Sun Jul 12 16:02:05 2015 UTC,"Gilles' Cthulhu can take anything Medea can dish out and keep on coming   Why do you think that? The huge attack she did at the end of Hollow Ataraxia seemed to be big enough to completely envelop Cthulu in one hit, so why wouldn't that be the end of it?"
fatestaynight,3d0kgy,TheAceol,3,Sun Jul 12 16:14:11 2015 UTC,"Because that was an extension of her anti-army spell, when Gilles' Cthulhu is expressly stated to be able to survive anti-army attacks. Medea's Rain of Light she used isn't a super big beam of death, it's those lasers she shot at Archer only now she's shooting a thousand of them. And she's not launching them all at once, if the graphic is to be believed she's only letting fly maybe a dozen at once. Cthulu's regeneration would just heal away the damage before she could reach Gilles.  Basically, the question is 'do you think Medea has an attack as powerful as Excalibur' and my answer is no she doesn't."
fatestaynight,3d0kgy,Wallywallsthe2nd,2,Sun Jul 12 16:20:23 2015 UTC,"It doesn't have to be as strong as Excalibur. Why do you think that? And are you sure you're thinking of the right graphic?

fatestaynight,3d0kgy,TheAceol,5,Sun Jul 12 16:38:03 2015 UTC,Main issue is that we never really get an idea of it's range or potency.Only a flash.  It clearly can destroy the shadows but honestly they aren't that strong to begin with.It clearly didn't kill Soichirou or Assassin for obvious reasons and it clearly can't destroy the temple otherwise it completely defeats the purpose of using it to protect the temple.

fatestaynight,3d0kgy,ieya404,3,Sun Jul 12 20:53:33 2015 UTC,"I think it needs to be as strong as Excalibur because that's what we see destroying the monster. Sure, maybe it would die to something weaker, but that's pure speculation. If we're talking in terms of facts, it needs to be nearly as powerful as Excalibur to defeat the monster, since there was some runoff energy that hit the boat."
fatestaynight,3d0kgy,Wallywallsthe2nd,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:49:23 2015 UTC,"I suppose. But really, the only requirement we've seen is that it has to be destroyed all at once, and it doesn't seem that relatively difficult to damage.

R2  with Gilles Cthulu however he can likely survive anything Medea can dish out.The thing took hits from Gilgamesh and regenerated like a boss,survived Ionian Hetaroi with minimal damage,caught the Gordius wheel, and fought 3 servants at full strength.Pretty much the only way she could win Round 2 is coming up with magic rivaling the destructive power of Excalibur and only if that magic destroyed every part of it at once.

Does the contract between it and Gilles cease to exist, Medea will hijack it or nothing happen? Sure thing Medea will not fight the monster directly and if she can accumulate enough power she could win either with a huge attack or carpet bombing it until it dies."
fatestaynight,3d0kgy,Liazas,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:49:08 2015 UTC,"Whenever Caster is brought up in threads like this her Rule Breaker is always a divisive matter; as you said, it's a wild card. The problem with it is that while it's powers stretch to dispelling magic and affecting all contracts in further reading and descriptions, we're not really shown how that manifests itself. Not to bring a long dead argument back to haunt everyone, but there was some discussion in the Caster vs F/Z Rider thread regarding what effect it would have on his Reality Marble. While the matter was never really resolved, the majority seems to agree that Rule Breaker doesn't really factor into her combat strength, as she never utilizes it except in very specific circumstances. Furthermore, it's been described numerous times as being unsuitable for use in direct fighting and makes it unwieldy in combat.  As for the former argument, while I also conclude that Medea would defeat Gilles de Rais I feel I have to object to the basis of your argument, for the same reason I object to statements about Medea running out of mana rather quickly and dying a few minutes in and Kariya dying before he'd even fought a single battle in the last thread. People in Fate, especially Servants, just aren't that squishy."

I'm going to assume you already know Saber's true name. If that's the case there isn't much information in Fate route you're really missing out on. It's pretty much all Saber-related stuff, so like I said, unless you really like Saber, not much to get from it. This is of course assuming you don't remember most of the revelations you learned from the 2006 anime.  That said, the general consensus on the 2006 anime is that it's a poor adaptation of the route and mixed in stuff from other routes where it shouldn't have. So the anime you watched wasn't really an accurate representation of the route.  If you haven't already seen Fate/Zero I would definitely recommend watching that next."

Summoning the actual Heroic Spirit in the Throne of Heroes can only be done by the World, and no amount of mana would be able to summon them (I think this was what Nasu said). Even if, by some weird magical deus ex machina, it were summoned, the World would probably consider it ""something that shouldn't be there"" so would take it back by force."

fatestaynight,3cxjoh,mcroller,14,Sat Jul 11 17:49:03 2015 UTC,"The ANN ""reviewer"" for UBW is a declared feminist. She didn't like the 2nd cour because the focus went to Shirou instead of Tohsaka ""strong female"" Rin. Don't misunderstand, I love Rin (she's my waifu), and this reviewer couldn't understand her character at all. Her editor, Hope, is also a feminist.  Recently, ANN has been pushing a feminist agenda in their ""reviews"", you can see that coming from Hope Chapman, Gabriella Ekens and Theron Martin, based on their latest reviews.  She couldn't understand a noble wish like ""saving everybody"" because women, sadly, lack that emotion (joke). Now seriously, I'm not even american and I had a really hard time trying to understand her reviews, because such ""1st world concerns"" doesn't exist here. In my country, people is just, you know, people, it doesn't matter their ethnic origin nor gender. Now I feel like she forced me to taint my mind to understand her reviews a bit, but she's still wrong anyways. This isn't about alpha or beta males, is about people finding their path in life.  The ""reviewer"" didn't like when Rin got kidnapped by Archer, but she was okay with Shirou being kidnapped by Caster. Based on what I know now, that's average feminism hypocrisy. Also what @saberlions said.  TL;DR she didn't like that the series was about its protagonist"
fatestaynight,3cxjoh,doctorpavelheer,12,Sat Jul 11 23:02:18 2015 UTC,The ANN reviews are coming from a person who believes F/Z is the epitome of feminism in anime and practically ignores how wrong she is on that notion.
fatestaynight,3cxjoh,saberlions,7,Sat Jul 11 19:50:35 2015 UTC,"The ANN woman has clearly never read past the Fate route in the VN, and honestly has no idea what she's talking about it. You only have to look at her thoughts on alpha/beta males and her drawbacks to her views of Zero to see that. See her review on episode 20 to find out how she concludes Kirei's inability to connect to women makes him turn evil, and any possibility of her being a credible source flies out the window.  Moving on to a happier topic with the VN vs. anime, the VN is the original and will give you a lot more information and time/development with the characters. But damn if the anime doesn't look pretty and have some amazing scenes. It's still a good adaptation, and while I'd stick with the VN is always better, the anime is still a great way to experience the Fate series."
fatestaynight,3cxjoh,Teerexil,8,Sat Jul 11 20:22:13 2015 UTC,"A little bit roundabout opinion on ANN ""reviewing"" attempts: Back in the 50's in my country one review came out, proving that Lord of the Rings celebrates a group of degenerate aristocrats and corrupt bourgois landlords as they prevent the industrialization of middle earth to strengthen their grasp over exploited workers who are portrayed as evil disfigured orcs. The article is still sometimes shown to kids in literature class as an example of what reviewing should never look like. The ANN managed to be the only ones in my knowledge to ever since reach such ridiculous level of idiocy.  For me personally, the second half felt more enjoyable - since I have read the UBW part of the VN, I was much more thrilled to see the climax of the show and I was quite pleased with the way Ufo executed it.  Gender equality gets lots of attention in the west recently. I'd say it's a good thing, unless you try to rewrite Snowhite because of it. Since anime obviously ponders to a male audience some people feel the need to criticize it. What I find hilarious though - instead of some trashy ecchi anime, the issue gets most discussion in a show whose MC spends half the time in an apron and/or armed with a mop...  As for the VN/Anime comparison, due to it's nature the VN is better suited for world building and subtleties. Regarding the latter, my favourite part was UBW spoiler"
fatestaynight,3cxjoh,jenykmrnous,3,Sat Jul 11 20:26:57 2015 UTC,"About your spoiler, that's just bad direction from Miura. He also missed the chance to show Rin's true nature when Archer betrayed her. Shirou there (VN) makes a comparison to Rin looking at the ""dead"" students in the classroom and how she is killing her true self in order to act as a magus. That was EXTREMELY important, is the very same reason Rin didn't kill Shirou: more than anything, she is human."
fatestaynight,3cxjoh,doctorpavelheer,15,Sun Jul 12 00:06:37 2015 UTC,"The ANN reviewer has no idea what she's talking about.  She has a massive bias towards Nasu and Fate/Stay Night and loves Fate/Zero.  She also looks at everything through an insane feminist lens lies about having read the VN when she obviously hasn't.  Fate/Stay Night is far from sexist, it's filled to the brim with strong female characters.  Shirou himself is one of the most selfless and kind people you'll ever find in fiction."
fatestaynight,3cxjoh,pwizzler,10,Sat Jul 11 19:38:37 2015 UTC,"I also do not understand why this person thinks this anime is misogynistic (hate against women)   The hell? First off, she obviously hasn't read the VN, and second, even if this was back before I read the Fate route, I'm offended and I'm a female. But VN aside, what is this woman's problem? Rin only got kidnapped once and that's not so bad, I've seen female characters get kidnapped more than that. Hell, Iri got kidnapped by Kieri back in F/Z, so what's the deal? Even when Tohsaka was kidnapped, she didn't just sit there helplessly, she stood her ground with her head held high when Shinji and Kieri ganged up on her and in my book, that makes her a stronger female character. And did she forget Rin kicking Caster's ass and her rescuing Shinji? Rin did more than Iri did in F/Z (Yeah, yeah, I remember the deal with Iri, but still). Nothing's wrong with Sakura and Shirou acts like a housewife anyway so it balances out. As for Saber in that dress, its an adaptation, they have to stay true to the fans. And be grateful that they didn't include the dialogue suggesting Caster was sexually abusing her. Then there's Caster's back story, and can't blame her for being pissed about that, but that actually made me like Caster. Yeah, she was abused by her Master, who was a male, but she didn't just sit back and let herself be treated like trash like the whole husband-wife situation where the wife is abused but she doesn't leave because she loves her husband too much. Caster got her vengeance and didn't give a damn if she was hated and called a witch.  I'm sorry if I kinda raged, but I just hate it when people think ""Oh, the definition of a strong female character is a girl who can kick all the guy's asses and not depend on any man for help."" For me, a strong female character is not based on the character's ability, but the strength of her character.  And I can't answer the VN Q/A since I'm still reading UBW right now"

fatestaynight,3cxjoh,TheFissureMan,4,Sat Jul 11 22:35:58 2015 UTC,"Well, im maybe one of the few that enjoyed the anime version of UBW just because its animated version of the VN. Yes it has flaws(Not that I notic, because im not a critic), but uhm.. Atleast its in animated form that is tweaked. Not to mention the prologue. It was fantastic.  I'll go to your second question: The VN gives more indepth look into shirou mind, the monologue, but the anime fleshes out some of the other aspect, like archer and caster and many many things. Like many would say; Read the VN and then watch the anime. I did just that and got the best of both worlds."
fatestaynight,3cxjoh,vietchinh,4,Sat Jul 11 20:53:47 2015 UTC,"I've always been of the opinion that bloggers from places like ANN don't know what they're talking about. I'd imagine most of them haven't even played the VN, which I believe might be the case for this particular review you read.   I don't know how in the world they got the idea that it's misogynistic. A lot of the female cast are strong characters that get shit done. Shirou relies on Saber to protect him, the man. Tohsaka is a badass, and both Illya, Caster, and Sakura are great too. Not weak at all.  I personally thought the first half was better. My reason is solely because Illya was still alive and not having to do with the animation or the adaptation itself. I just like Illya. After she dies, I, already knowing how the rest of it goes, just dropped it because I didn't find the UBW anime all that interesting to begin with.  VN did the monologues better. I felt Ufotable dropped the ball a bit on the UBW reality marble depiction. I can't really say much else because I more or less forgot most of what they did in the anime. I guess that might be a weak point?"
fatestaynight,3cxjoh,KissKiss2wei,8,Sun Jul 12 01:38:27 2015 UTC,ANN gave me cancer too many times. I don't go there anymore.
fatestaynight,3cxjoh,AdelKoenig,11,Sat Jul 11 19:10:09 2015 UTC,"I dont know why she thinks that, Fate/zero is misogynistic trash though"
fatestaynight,3cxjoh,Whatstaunt,6,Sat Jul 11 18:34:29 2015 UTC,"I also do not understand why this person thinks this anime is misogynistic (hate against women).   Some people think that the anime portrays Rin as a damsel in distress only there so Shirou can save her, which isn't true, and in the Fate route Shirou thinks that women shouldn't fight.   What things did the VN do better at and what things did the anime do better at?   Well, the VN has a lot more insight into each character's thoughts, especially Shirou, who's internal monologues are mostly missing from the anime, making him a very hard character to understand. The VN also has many bad ends, which happen if you make the wrong choices. Some of them are very well-made, and provide some insight on characters such as Illya.  On the other hand, the fight scenes are very well-made in the anime, and it has some insight on Caster's Master that is missing from the VN. Also, the last episode is pure fan-service for Type-Moon fans, and is missing from the VN."
fatestaynight,3cxjoh,Vehkislove,7,Sat Jul 11 18:08:28 2015 UTC,"Some people think that the anime portrays Rin as a damsel in distress only there so Shirou can save her.   Which goes to show how little attention those people paid. The purpose of Rin's character isn't for Shirou to save her, it's for her to save Shirou. Both the anime and the VN explicitly say this multiple times. Yes, she gets kidnapped and a man rescues her. But the above opinion runs completely counter to the entire point of her and Shirou's relationship."
fatestaynight,3cxjoh,Aero121,7,Sat Jul 11 22:23:57 2015 UTC,The person who wrote the ANN reviews is an idiot and she doesn't know what she is talking about.
fatestaynight,3cxjoh,TakeruShirogane,5,Sat Jul 11 19:09:45 2015 UTC,"In regards to the ANN reviews, I classify that as ""grasping at threads that don't exist"". UBW is about a clash of ideologies, not a case of toxic masculinity. But to be general, the 2nd half did have some pacing problems in the beginning, but I feel it got better by episode 19, and I still loved the start of the 2nd half, I wouldn't let it discourage you.  In regards to the VN, I would highly recommend you give it another shot as you are getting the full story, but if you can't I believe the anime adaptations are good. The 2006 anime is a good starting point, even if it isn't the best adaptation, skip the 2010 movie and just go straight into the 2014-2015 anime series (although if you wanna watch the 2010 movie afterwords that's ok.)   The newest series isn't a perfect adaptation, but it does have the core story of the source material intact, and it just looks incredible. So I'd retry the VN, but if you can't, the anime adaptations are still great."
fatestaynight,3cxjoh,Tearfulfriend18,6,Sat Jul 11 18:54:01 2015 UTC,"So I hope this isn't going to be awkward. I've been reading reviews about Fate/Stay Night on Anime News Network, the blogger said that the first half was good but the second was really bad. What's your guys opinion on this? I'm really unsure why this person thinks this way.   Are you talking about UBW? If so, I wouldn't say it was bad per se, but I did feel that the first half was adapted better. Not to necessarily say that I liked the first half better, but the part where Ufotable really screwed up was Shirou's monologues, especially during Shirou vs Archer. It's also hard to adapt the monologues as well, since you have to balance giving enough info and not boring viewers. People who disliked the monologue either thought it didn't give Shirou's character enough complexity, or just thought it was boring. There were also some other characters that weren't developed because it wasn't ""their route"" (such as Sakura and Illya), which caused some dislike from anime-only viewers. There were also some pacing problems, and while the first course had this as well, it was to a greater extent in the second. Ufotable was also put at a natural disadvantage when adapting UBW because it's the second route, not the first which has all the world-building elements, as well as the fact that they were adapting a visual novel, which is very text-based. Compared to the LN format of F/Z (which has much less monologues), it was significantly harder to adapt UBW, and it shows in the 2nd half. The 2nd half is also very action-based, and without a good monologue to some it just felt like Ufotable decided to make UBW flashy and nothing more.   I also do not understand why this person thinks this anime is misogynistic (hate against women).   If anything the Fate Route is more misogynistic because of Shirou's constant saying of ""women shouldn't fight"". In UBW, I guess people saw Saber in a wedding dress and called it misogynistic. The VN as a whole gives off a feel as being more directed towards a male audience.   What things did the VN do better at and what things did the anime do better at?   What VN did better: monologues, story, character depth, complexity, emotional attachment, soundtrack  What anime did better: visuals and Episode 25  I would highly recommend reading the VN. If it's not working, you can PM people such as /u/AdelKoenig for help, they helped me with Hollow Ataraxia problems.  EDIT: if you're talking about the Fate route the majority dislikes it. The anime had a great soundtrack though."

I don't think the second half was bad, but it was a bit disappointing, compared to the first. I thought the shirou/archer fight was too drawn out, and the first half of the shirou/gil fight was kind of pathetic. I did like the stuff with caster and the epilogue was amazing.  I will probably watch it again with its dub before I make the final decision. Also the epilogue has me excited for season 3 of kaleid liner."

I've been reading reviews about Fate/Stay Night on Anime News Network, the blogger said that the first half was good but the second was really bad. What's your guys opinion on this? I'm really unsure why this person thinks this way.   If it is about the new UBW adaptation then there are some point were people can complain but it isnt by any means a deal breaker. What i can see as flaws are some themes that are bring up and never dealt with. Like showing Illya resent towards Kiritsugu but never built more into it. The VN never touched the topic and it is better that way. Themes shouldnt be presented if they arent gonna be resolved. The other problems can be some imperfections in the adaptation of the monologues but it is understandanble. Other that that i can't think of and really must of this is only nitpicking. Like the audio department is not as memorable as the Deen one but it doesnt mean that Deen adaptation in better that Ufo's one (Lol).   I also do not understand why this person thinks this anime is misogynistic (hate against women).   It is what hurt the Fate route most. Just some rough writing to convey ideas to the reader. Nasu said that he could have been more subtle but it was at his limit there. That is why the idea that Saber, despite being a Servant and a King, is a woman was presented so bluntly and hurt the character of Shirou ( Despite later admiting that the fact that Saber fights is one of the things that he likes about her )   What things did the VN do better at and what things did the anime do better at?   VN: World building. Monologues and understanding the motivations fo the characters. Some soundtrack. Cleaver dynimics with the choices format. VN Spoilers  Anime: Visual, animation, overall awesome factor. Some original scenes were pretty good."
fatestaynight,3cxjoh,ElPsyCongroo204,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:18:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you actually read the ANN reviews without losing your mind over the reviewer's feminism, her main problem with the last part of UBW is pacing, which I...don't really think is that controversial. UBW S2 had pretty bad pacing, and the pinnacle of that was the Archer fight.   The sixth to last and fifth to last paragraphs of her Episode 20 review are kind of the crux of the matter. Now, I first read Fate/Stay Night when I was 17, the same as Shirou. I honestly admired him and looked up to him as an ideal of courage and determination. This story was very important to me! It's a little embarrassing to look back on that now, but I still think it's a good story, I understand where my younger self was coming from, and there's still a part of me that wants to be a superhero, that gets absolute chills from HF Spoiler OP DON'T READ THIS Bearing that in mind: I agree with those parts of her analysis. A lot of people have angrily brought up the 'toxic masculinity' thing, but she was applauding Fate for challenging those dichotomies and suggesting that it undermined itself by sexualizing and marginalizing Rin (and Saber) in a terrible way. That fifth to last paragraph was basically what was running through my mind during the whole Rin almost-rape part. I mean, this    Shinji is less a character than a narrative tool to set upon female characters when they aren't in enough sexual peril   is basically why I can't really bring myself to hate Shinji--he's a pure hate magnet, and I kind of feel sorry for him for getting saddled with that narrative role/disappointed in Nasu for picking such an easy way to manipulate the audience's emotions.  I don't agree with everything in Ekens's reviews--if anything, I think there are parts where she's not feminist enough, and I don't think the presentation of Shirou and Archer's conflict was as much of a trainwreck as she says--but I think they unleashed internet outrage through the deadly combo of A. giving bad reviews to a really popular anime and B. daring to mention feminism.   But, I mean, tl;dr, the reason that Ekens gave such bad scores to the second season of UBW isn't just ""feminism"", it's bad pacing, muddled themes, inconsistent fight direction, weakened visuals (seriously go back and watch the ridiculously gorgeous fights in the beginning of S1), and its clumsy way of shoving aside all non-Shirou and Archer characters. She likes Rin and Shirou a lot! She gave a pretty nice review to Episode 25! There is nothing inherently wrong with her reviews, plenty of people have been saying those kinds of things, she just ended up giving slightly harsher scores than usual.  It's pretty much a YMMV thing, I was able to enjoy the show more because I already liked the VN going in, probably because I was able to relate to Shirou more than she was."

In this context, it's the equivalent of ""Miss, Mister"" in English.  There's a slight problem in Fate though. Ilya isn't calling him ""onii-chan"" in that sense, she means it. Therefore it's kind of not right to place a ""Mister"" in there. Placing ""big brother"" kinda brings us awkward English but it's questionable which is more awkward ""onii-chan"" or ""big brother"". At least the letter belongs to the language we're reading.   I personally would still sacrifice the ""onii-chan"" because I really dislike honorifics in any language outside of Japanese. Not everything can be translated in other languages, sacrifices have to be made sometimes.   I think a better question would be : Why is Nasu writing Ilya as if she is familiar with Japanese culture and the way people call one another."
fatestaynight,3cut74,Azraeleon,2,Sat Jul 11 05:35:07 2015 UTC,"A possible answer to your question why Ilya would be familiar with Japanese culture is that Kiritsugu was Japanese, and maybe taught her some things.  Though of course, Kiritsugu himself didn't really spend a lot of his life in Japan, so I'm not sure how high his own awareness of Japanese culture was..."

Is keeping your loved ones from a brutal war so wrong? When Shirou does the same thing to Saber it's like 'oh he's so manly', Spoiler He just wanted to protect Sakura. He probably was going to use his Holy Grail wish to tighten her cunt back up or cure her syphilis or something. The story was written to make that faggot Shirou look good. Objectively, Shinji is a far better character than Shirou. At least he has the balls to take action decisively instead of dicking around like Shirou, and if he weren't stuck with the weak ass servant Rider and no plothax he probably would have won the war.

Thank you brother and as always Team Shinji.  Finally someone understands how endearing Shinji is.  All I ever here is Shinji is scum because HF spoilers that.  Take rin in the ubw anime for example.  Some think his advances were insinuating rape, when in fact, he was simply sexually tormenting her as she did to him for all these years.  Rin dangled the ever low hanging peach in front of our boy without ever truly rejecting him  This, in addition to all the other false promises and shortcomings in Shinji's life result in a bitter man with a precious core.  Shinji finally snaps when he sees his so called friend moving in on a girl he's been wooing for years!  I view fsn as a work that could easily have gone with a much more real and likeable character such as Shinji instead of Mr. Shirou back-stab. If we are ever granted the privelige to see the fsn universe (hell even all of Nasuverse) through Shinji's eyes it will surely be a work of art."

fatestaynight,3cnm27,blazenarm,6,Fri Jul 10 00:40:10 2015 UTC,The good people over at /r/GARcher attempted Kanshou and Bakuya and it looked awful. Honestly I'm partial to the current setup. And I'm pretty sure that the visual stuff in reddit is CSS based.

fatestaynight,3cnm27,Jerlko,2,Thu Jul 9 15:34:20 2015 UTC,They're just a terrible idea. Too much small details and the shape is awkward. I can see picking two simple shaped (i.e. No jagged edges) things to represent the up and down.

fatestaynight,3cnnny,farispie,2,Thu Jul 9 09:46:11 2015 UTC,"This one would be a bit trickier to do, partially because of the background being what it is. Not too many cave like structures around here. Plus Shirou's body being in the state is in for that scene would be an ordeal to pull off. But it actually sounds like it could be really fun to try and make work. No promises on this, but I'll give it my best shot"

fatestaynight,3cnnny,AdelKoenig,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:35:05 2015 UTC,"Well partially as a joke, but I still think it'd be a darn cool scene to be animated, and it isn't as tasking to make as a fight scene."

fatestaynight,3cnnny,MichaelJahrling,3,Thu Jul 9 11:22:32 2015 UTC,Love it. Absolutely love it. Writing up the script and shot-list now.
fatestaynight,3cnnny,daemon01001,2,Thu Jul 9 20:35:48 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a great idea!   If you're going emotional scenes, you mean scenes with no real action involved? Just dialogue? I would love to see you do the end to the Fate route if that's the case.  I'm tempted to pick Saber scenes but most of them are pretty flashy. I suppose Sparks Liner High or Saber Alter battles will work since they usually don't have that much explosions in them.   If you want something simpler, maybe Shirou and Caren fighting off beasts from FHA, which is rather plain, but Caren has a cool fighting style that hasn't been really animated."
fatestaynight,3cnnny,wailord40,2,Thu Jul 9 09:00:40 2015 UTC,"I think the end of the Fate route could be done pretty simply. I actually know a good location for it to be filmed. I imagine either this, or Shirou's decision in Heavens Feel Day 9 will be my starting point."

fatestaynight,3cn3nb,AdelKoenig,27,Thu Jul 9 04:46:40 2015 UTC,Lets just have a 15 hour movie that follows the VN perfectly with all the inner monologuing included :-) haha
fatestaynight,3cn3nb,skillex67,19,Thu Jul 9 04:57:05 2015 UTC,Go into the theatre and it's just a let's play.

fatestaynight,3cn3nb,arbeh,6,Thu Jul 9 22:44:05 2015 UTC,"i  mean tbh if it was a lets play with ufotable style portraits and like occasional animation, i'd probably watch it like 20 times"
fatestaynight,3cn3nb,radioinactivity,9,Thu Jul 9 14:47:32 2015 UTC,"A six hour movie sounds incredible, but I cant see it happening."
fatestaynight,3cn3nb,ghostFOUR7,8,Thu Jul 9 05:02:40 2015 UTC,"It's a very ""Heaven's Feel"" approach, but it would be hard to watch, hell to produce and the movie theaters would be able to screen it how many times a day? Maybe once? It felt disastrous, so I rejected the idea in my mind. I haven't told it to anyone. But I do think that the plan itself is interesting.   Kondou Hikaru"
fatestaynight,3cn3nb,megacookie,6,Thu Jul 9 05:19:51 2015 UTC,"A 6 hour film would be good because there would be no waiting months between movies ontop of the months we'd need to wait for subtitled bluray release, but honestly it would be difficult to watch. Like, I could sit down and watch 6 hours of anime at once if I really had the time and motivation to do so, but the way anime movies are usually paced it would feel like a massive drag. Plus I'd feel bad for cinemagoers who might not be able to hold the large soda they finished two hours in and would be bursting to piss before the finale."
fatestaynight,3cn3nb,Ziebell,9,Thu Jul 9 12:32:17 2015 UTC,"Best case scenario would be at least 3 movies KnK style, they could even keep some of the heavier stuff then...  My guess would be that it's that a release date is still a few months away from being announced, so for now all we have are rumors, and so far Ufotable hasn't really disappointed, so I'll keep my hopes up."
fatestaynight,3cn3nb,ShadowCrossZero,5,Thu Jul 9 05:10:16 2015 UTC,"I'm waiting for an official confirmation before panicking. Things are strongly suggesting a certain conclusion, but mistranslations and misunderstandings are always a possibility when information is delivered so vaguely like this. However, HF being referred to as ""movie"" instead of ""movies"" during the event doesn't appear to bode well. I'm still of the belief that it will be just one movie, but we'll find out for certain eventually."
fatestaynight,3cn3nb,ShadowCrossZero,4,Thu Jul 9 06:44:17 2015 UTC,"HF being referred to as ""movie"" instead of ""movies"" during the event   There are two reasons for that. One is the audio clip that Kondou Hikaru was talking in, he kept saying movie instead of movies because he was talking about his 6 hour movie idea.   The other is that Japanese does plurals different from English. Most Japanese nouns don't have plural forms and so its a case of deer vs deer. The translator translated everything to singular, not know if it was singular or plural."
fatestaynight,3cn3nb,Tearfulfriend18,5,Thu Jul 9 15:12:30 2015 UTC,"The event as in the F/SN special event, separate from the Q&A panel where the audio clip was recorded. The second reason would make sense though. However, ""single feature project"" has a pretty strong implication. But I do agree that isn't appropriate to sound any alarms and declare the end of the world just yet without further details and a concrete answer that's been through quality assured translation (as in not just one translator on the spot at a panel of fans), though the worry is very much warranted until it's alleviated."
fatestaynight,3cn3nb,saberlions,5,Thu Jul 9 16:23:09 2015 UTC,"3 films, each a couple of hours long, that's what I'm hoping for. But the fact that they're even mentioning a 6-hour film lets me know that they are committed to doing the story justice, so that puts my mind at ease. Ufotable hasn't let me down yet."
fatestaynight,3cn3nb,Eorza,3,Thu Jul 9 06:56:37 2015 UTC,"I think I forgot to add in my original post that it was both Iwakami and Kondo-san talking about HF in particular (Aniplex and Ufotable producers respectively). If that info was even needed for others at least.  Anyways, as long as HF is more than one 2-hour movie I'll be cool with it."
fatestaynight,3cn3nb,Officer_Catbutt,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:35:45 2015 UTC,"If the HF route was converted into an anime like UBW, with the show length being at 23min, it would be more than 12 hours long. Since HF is like 20-30% longer than UBW which lasted for 25 ep at about 23min each (575 minutes total). So if they're going to go for the HF True End, then it will have to be a movie series. I think both day 15 and 16 would each be an hour long. 6hr for UBW's time is like around when they run into Lancer after Gil vs Herc."
fatestaynight,3cn3nb,Eorza,0,Fri Jul 10 05:40:43 2015 UTC,"Let's be frank, one movie, no matter how long would be disasterous. Either it would skip half the story or be too long to be interesting to the majority of people. If we want to get hyped about this, we should get hyped over KnK style movie series, otherwise I don't see this working."

fatestaynight,3cll9k,RIvkyn,19,Wed Jul 8 21:23:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah. If Shirou was the sort of guy who'd be interested in growing a harem, he could have very easily wound up with like eight or nine girls.  Saber, Rin, and Sakura - the ""official"" heroines.  Taiga - the big sister you're not actually related to is an eroge classic for a reason, and they already act like a stereotypical married couple anyway (but gender-inverted).  Rider - Get Sakura, get Rider. It's a bit of a package deal.  Ilya - Demonstrates a big brother fetish in Kaleid Liner. A few Bad Ends imply that it's possible in F/SN too, IIRC.  Sella - Demonstrates a crush in Kaleid Liner.  Mitsusuri Ayako - Has an erotically-charged wager with Tohsaka Rin, wherein she becomes Rin's slave for a day if Rin gets a boyfriend first.  Luvia - Develops a crush in both Kaleid Liner and the UBW epilogue."

Seriously doubt the manga's gonna be too good of an adpatation and the UBW anime doesn't cover nearly as much as Fate and UBW do in the VN.

There was one dude cosplaying someone I couldn't quite recognize.

While I was fangirling, my friends slowly started to withdraw from me and pretending they don't know me. I guess it was that bad."

Basically, the F/SN manga is so horrible that the TL's stopped halfway through the translation.  Heaven's Feel is currently being adapted as a manga, and translations are following soon after each chapter is released, but the manga clearly expects you to already have read HF, as it has things from late in the route revealed in the prologue."

I can't get off of my mind that they intended the anime order to be ZERO>UBW, in japan they don't really care about spoilers so that's quite understandable for us to be concerned about whether or not we should watch it in that order."

fatestaynight,3cbhp5,coolkyledude,2,Tue Jul 7 08:29:30 2015 UTC,"Quite a bit, actually.   With the anime only route, re-watching is needed to get the most out of each adaptation. F/Z is better having watched the other anime, and UBW is better having seen F/Z first. Since you started with Zero, I would definitely recommend giving it a re-watch!"

They are a lot more realistic than ppl with no experience being experts their first time. I feel they add to the story in its own weird way.  However. The h scenes are not enjoyable to read, and so I would probably skip them on rereads.  Realta Nua does cut out of Heaven's Feel some important non-h-scenes to get the age down. If you want to still see these scenes, you need to have the h-scenes on. You can either just turn them off whenever you come across an h scene, or you can just turn them on for every scene with Shinji."
fatestaynight,3cbhp5,Azraeleon,2,Mon Jul 13 04:02:28 2015 UTC,What happens if you have the h scenes off and get to a shinji part and turn it on then? Will you get the censored version cause you entered the scene with the h scenes off or will you get the regular version cause you switched it?

If not some parts will sound like mumbo jumbo. But if you are still going in just use the skip function a couple of times. The branching start really soon, specially the fixed Sakura choices."
fatestaynight,3cgi69,ElPsyCongroo204,4,Tue Jul 7 19:04:52 2015 UTC,"I highly reccomend you DON'T do that. There are a couple of reasons : 1) the fate route hasn't been adapted properly so you ought to read that for world and lore building reasons. 2) Heaven's Feel builds upon characterization established in Fate/UBW, so its important to read those to better appreciate Heaven's Feel, esp. in regards to Shirou. Even if you've seen the UBW anime, the anime misses out on characterization here and there.  As for missing the bad endings, I reccomend you check them out as you read, esp. the ones in HF (HF's bad endings are awesome!)"
fatestaynight,3cgi69,farispie,3,Tue Jul 7 20:03:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think I'm alone in thinking that you're making a mistake. It's basically... why bother even trying to play HF when you couldn't even stomach UBW, which is shorter than HF?. Why not just wait for the movie then?  Also, to answer your question, it took me 48 hours to 100% the VN. It'd take considerably less time if you just went straight for the necessary endings.  If 30 minutes of skipping is STILL ""a bit long"", then again, why bother?"
