ynab,3e3hjr,imhereforthevotes,21,Tue Jul 21 17:50:47 2015 UTC,You can create a second Dropbox account (be sure to refer her to get the bonus space on your account). Then share the YNAB folder in your Dropbox to her new Dropbox account.  This is what I do with my wife. This keeps a single YNAB budget in sync but keeps our dropbox files separate.

ynab,3e3hjr,paranigma,4,Tue Jul 21 17:55:15 2015 UTC,Ok. This sounds like the thing to do. I didn't realize you could share a folder in a Dropbox.
ynab,3e3hjr,shufflin_,4,Tue Jul 21 19:29:21 2015 UTC,Can confirm - this is what I do with my budget on my work laptop (I share the folder to my work Dropbox).

ynab,3e3hjr,manfrommke,3,Tue Jul 21 23:37:44 2015 UTC,This is the way to go. Been doing this with the wife for about a year. No issues.

ynab,3e52hs,eroxx,10,Wed Jul 22 00:43:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure exactly what you mean. But taking Amazon Prime for example - I put in $8.25 every month into this category ($99/12), and then I enter the transaction once a year and it balances out to zero."
ynab,3e52hs,ynabismyfavoritesub,4,Wed Jul 22 00:57:13 2015 UTC,"I do the same, I round up to the nearest whole dollar though.. $9 instead of $8.25.. just so the balances are cleaner. It works great for certain bills that fluctuate."
ynab,3e52hs,loganz,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:21:29 2015 UTC,This tiny extra gives you a small buffer in the event that the rate might increase some time in the future. I slightly over-budget most of my fixed bills.

ynab,3e52hs,Pagedpuddle65,-2,Wed Jul 22 01:06:02 2015 UTC,"If you reconcile your accounts fairly often (at least once a month, better to do it more often) then you would just create the transaction for the bill at that time."

ynab,3e2gb6,capitalquestionmark,7,Tue Jul 21 13:11:56 2015 UTC,"An emergency fund or buffer is nice to have but if I had outstanding debt at more than 10% I would pay that down ASAP with every possible dollar, timing transactions carefully so as not to overdraft my account. Once the high interest debts are paid off I would relax and build up the buffer."
ynab,3e2gb6,ckr801,2,Tue Jul 21 13:29:05 2015 UTC,Are you saying at more than 10% DTI or 10% interest.   The card is 9.8% and reduced to 4.8% when deployed. (Thanks USAA).   Maybe I need to deploy ;-)
ynab,3e2gb6,magikid,2,Tue Jul 21 14:36:36 2015 UTC,You could lower the interest rate by transferring the balance to a new card with a balance transfer offer.  That would give you a more favorable interest rate for a while so you would have time to build up at least some kind of emergency savings.  edit: wording
ynab,3e2gb6,kimillionaire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:03 2015 UTC,"I recommend this as well. Chase Slate currently offers a balance transfer with a 0% fee and 0% APR for the first 15 months. Think how much that could save you in interest! If you haven't paid off the balance by the time the 15 months are up, you could transfer it to another card.  If you don't want to open up another credit card or don't think you'll be approved, check your existing cards. I bet at least one has a balance transfer option at a lower APR."
ynab,3e2gb6,ckr801,2,Tue Jul 21 19:15:53 2015 UTC,4.8% is not bad. A $5000 emergency fund has a monthly cost of merely $20. That is worth it to me.
ynab,3e2gb6,unclehuggybear,5,Tue Jul 21 15:47:36 2015 UTC,"/u/brainsturgeon over at /r/personalfinance created this infographic.  I've followed it and it has treated me well.  Also, this article from Mr. Money Mustache is a good one.  If I were in your shoes, I would save up $1,000 liquid cash and have that as an emergency fund and then attack your debt."
ynab,3e2gb6,fontophilic,2,Tue Jul 21 14:21:58 2015 UTC,"First non-bill thing I budgeted for was YNAB @ $27 a month. I have $1K in emergency funds and a paltry $125 toward my buffer. BUT I set intermediate buffer goals. ""Quarter Paycheck"" ""half"" etc.   I hate shelling out $150 a month in interest fees and sadly the spam snail mail I get touting 12 months no interest balance transfers are starting to get enticing. I'm going to keep those out of my peripheral and keep away.   Checking out the links. Thanks"
ynab,3e2gb6,materialdesigner,2,Tue Jul 21 14:28:39 2015 UTC,"If you can be smart about a balance transfer, and confident you can pay it off under the 0% rate, then you have every reason to consider it."
ynab,3e2gb6,fontophilic,2,Tue Jul 21 18:50:27 2015 UTC,"Your buffer isn't a number of paychecks, it's 1x monthly expenses"
ynab,3e2gb6,bluefuzzyoctopus,2,Tue Jul 21 15:03:51 2015 UTC,This I understand. I get paid twice a month. If I budget for intermediate goals like a half paycheck then I do that four times. I can have a psychological advantage. Pavlov me.   Thanks
ynab,3e2gb6,bluefuzzyoctopus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:07:52 2015 UTC,But your real goal should be so that paycheck and monthly expenses are not the same value.
ynab,3e2gb6,saivode,4,Tue Jul 21 18:49:21 2015 UTC,"Do one or the other, not both. How long will it take you to pay off the debt? How long will it take to build a buffer?"
ynab,3e2gb6,sunamstar,4,Tue Jul 21 13:18:49 2015 UTC,At current pace it will take me three years to pay off the debt. This is a card that has slowly crept up on me through 13 years and three deployments.  Almost embarrassing to put down a number but my card attained legal voting status about a month ago. Zero charges since YNAB
ynab,3e2gb6,furysamurai72,3,Tue Jul 21 13:29:27 2015 UTC,My buffer will take me six months to a year.
ynab,3e2gb6,Teh_Cactus,2,Tue Jul 21 13:32:00 2015 UTC,"I would probably buffer first then, then tackle the debt. 3 years is a long time to wait to buffer, and it really does make things a lot easier.   If you have any smaller debts that'll take less than a couple months to clear, I would do those first."
ynab,3e2gb6,radio-active_man,2,Tue Jul 21 13:35:12 2015 UTC,"Knowing nothing about your personal situation, that honestly sounds a bit worrying to me. Simply the fact that emergencies and unexpected expenses happen are likely to drag that out even further. If possible, you may want to consider some additional spending or even lifestyle changes and increase the amount you are able to save each month."
ynab,3e2gb6,natinaut,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:42:38 2015 UTC,I can afford my debt. It's just daunting. I can do my buffer in three months but at a cost of $2500 a month. That would cut into mandatory bills. Gracias
ynab,3e2gb6,luckyplum,3,Tue Jul 21 15:52:20 2015 UTC,"YNAB currently recommends building the buffer via a category - but they didn't use to.   You could try the old school buffer building approach in combination with attacking debt.   The first time you get paid in a month (this works very well for those who get paid weekly or biweekly), split the transaction and declare 5% of it as ""income for next month"". The next time you get paid, split it 90/10, until you are putting 100% of your paycheck into next month.   Your first month, if you received two paychecks, you are forgoing about 7.5% of your income. The second month, (again, two paychecks) you are forgoing 12.5% of your income, but with 7.5% of your income from LAST month already there, it is more like 5%. So really, the month that you start this method will be the hardest, unless you have any income fluctuations."
ynab,3e2gb6,magikid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:55:44 2015 UTC,So much this! This is what I'm doing (thanks to your initial suggestion as a matter of fact) and its working wonders for me. Far better than having a category. I fully endorse and recommend this suggestion.
ynab,3e2gb6,wuneternalround,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:58:38 2015 UTC,"Hah, that's an interesting tactic. I'll try this from the next pay onwards. Nice one!"
ynab,3e2gb6,magikid,4,Wed Jul 22 01:37:52 2015 UTC,"Build that buffer up to meet Rule 4, first and foremost. I started trying to do both and it really just meant that neither was getting done.   Once you're buffered and applying Rule 4, budgeting in general becomes so much easier (not waiting on that next paycheck to pay bills)!"

ynab,3dynfp,thecw,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:37:30 2015 UTC,Just use the arrow next to the category so it subtracts from next month's category balance in case the amount owing goes over to next month. Otherwise you'll end up paying it back for them out of your income.
ynab,3dynfp,InfinityMehEngine,4,Tue Jul 21 15:38:47 2015 UTC,"When your friends pay you, it's an inflow back into that category. If you weren't budgeted for it, you'll want to whack a mole so that your changes + their contribution covers it."
ynab,3dynfp,panachetag,2,Mon Jul 20 16:43:14 2015 UTC,"From reading the comments I do this a little differently. Though it works well for me.  For me there are certain people I have a running tab for. Girlfriend, roommate, business, and a family member.  I have these created as on budget accounts. So for instance if I pay a $70 dollar water bill. I transfer $35 into my roommate account. The categorize the other $35 as appropriate.  This works better for me as it doesn't inflate categories. It makes it really simple to know who owes me what exactly and to collect. Also in case if say a relationship ending event I'd wipe out the account by categorizing it as a bad debt. Which to me is more accurate then blowing up my actually cost categories.  The other added advantage is for me is now say my roommate pays the electric bill well I just shuffle that out of the on budget account or even go negative to demonstrate I owe money.  It makes the whole process easier for me to visualize, the data more real, and helps me keep an eye on the tab easier."
ynab,3dynfp,loganz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:25:22 2015 UTC,"This is spot on. If it's money you expect to be able to get back, it should be an account with a positive balance for each person. If that person Padua you back, you transfer money out of that account into your main account."

Make a category (not an account) called ""Savings"" or ""Emergency Fund"", and budget whatever excess you have. It'll make your ""available to budget"" for August come down to $0. When you end up needing to spend that money, you ""budget"" a negative amount in the e-fund category, freeing up money to use in the actual category you need (car repairs, or what have you)."
ynab,3dwkxh,mmmsoap,4,Mon Jul 20 03:59:57 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if this is best but when I add a new account to YNAB I make its initial balance an inflow to my emergency fund. You could also mark it as income but I feel this confuses income reporting.
ynab,3dwkxh,ckr801,3,Mon Jul 20 03:39:03 2015 UTC,"You should definitely budget the money you have for savings.  The reason it is showing as overbudgeted is that you are most likely budgeting more money that you actually have. The total of your accounts in YNAB  is $1136.23. You have budgeted $113.48 for July and $743.48 in August, meaning you only have $279.27 left for that savings category. Is that what you've been trying to enter?  Have you had a chance to attended the live classes yet? I can't recommend these highly enough - they have pre-recorded classes on the website too, if you can't find a live class at a time that suits."
ynab,3dwkxh,mmmmhmm88,3,Mon Jul 20 04:05:53 2015 UTC,"You should budget $1001.77 into your ""general savings"" category, because this is how much is in your savings account.

This will put you over budget because you've budgeted most of your money, but you only have $134 in your checking account. Unless you plan to use the money in your savings account for bills, you can only budget $134 right now.  Next time you get paid, budget that money, including any savings you put into your savings account."

Any money you don't need to spend goes into savings. Then when you have next month's money you can enter it and then make up your budget.  If that money is for both months, enter everything you have to spend money on this month AND next month.  Anything extra goes into your savings budget line."
ynab,3dwkxh,erinthelibrarian,2,Mon Jul 20 04:34:34 2015 UTC,"Theoretically, other posters have covered it, but essentially this:     I'm presuming that your $134.46 in your checking account is enough to last you the rest of the month, and any paychecks you're getting in July are going to August (ie, you've got Rule 4 sorted). The numbers you've budgeted suggest this, and leave you about twenty bucks at the end of the month. Budget those against something. Budget the value of your savings account (so 1001.77) to whatever savings categories you have (at the moment, Emergency Fund, but maybe you're creating some other categories to use that money for?) This does leave you overbudgetted in August, but that's because you're budgeting with money that you don't have yet. Once you get the paycheck you're using to budget August, and mark it as Income for August, then that problem will melt away. For now, you can either:    Remove the budgeting you've done in August, then re-add it when you get paid. This is the Officially Sanctioned method.   Leave it in the red, and don't budget more than you know you'll get. This is how I handle it, but is terrible if you have variable income, or are about to get fired."

ynab,3dwkxh,erinthelibrarian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:36:32 2015 UTC,"You're doing it wrong, basically.  :-)  You should go to the website and read their intro, and then probably watch the tutorials.  But for setting up you budget right now, there are two things you need to do - give every dollar a job, and only budget with money you have (meaning money in your account right now, not money you are expecting next week).  To give every dollar a job, you need to assign it to a category.  For July, your budget shows $1022.75 available to budget.  When you've given every dollar a job, your available to budget number should be 0.  So if you want all of that money to be savings, assign it to the savings category.  The categories work like envelopes with cash in them - if you don't touch them, the money stays available month after month.  However, after giving all of your money a job, it looks like you will be overbudgeted for August, which you will need to fix, since you can't budget with money you don't have (right now, in your account).  So you need to figure out which, if any, of the bills due in August you will need to pay before you get your next paycheck.  If the answer is none, you're fine...but you need to removed the budgeted amounts for August because you don't have that money yet.  (Everything should show ""$0 available to budget"").  If you will need, say, $279.27 to pay bills before you get paid again, then don't allocate all of the $1022 to savings; budget $279.27 for those bills, and allocate the remainder to savings.  And use the same system when you get paid again - that is now money in your account, so allocate it to pay the bills you'll need to pay before you get paid again, and earmark the rest to savings or vacation or whatever funds you want.  That's just a rough outline for how to get started, and there are a lot of refinements and details I've left out - but that should get you on the right track."

Lets assume you've done that in your picture and all your monthly expenses are $43.48.  The remaining $1022.75+ is your ""emergency fund"". Make a new budget category for ""emergency fund"" and put all of that money in it. That should make your ""available to budget"" become $0.00.   When you get paychecks in, categorize them as ""available next month""  You're now fully buffered and ready to go logging transactions as they happen."

I have been saving for car repair/maintenance since the beginning! My tires are kind of old and noisy, although they said they were still in good shape after my last rotation... but I can't wait to get some new shoes for my car.. it'll be nice to get it 'free'.. instead of sinking an entire paycheck into them for once.  RDF's are a beautiful thing."

Took the classes, started fresh and everything clicked!  (plus, each class they give away a free copy)    Also, don't make the mistake of trying to import history from your bank.  When you start YNAB, go from today - enter the amount of cash in your accounts today, and track each transaction going from today forward.    The one part that was a bit confusing was pre-YNAB debt (credit cards).  If possible, have your CC balance at 0 on the day you set it up.  If that isn't possible, there is a class explaining how to handle this!    Happy YNAB'ing!"

I thought about it and used the software to the best of my ability for a week - and then it just clicked like a light bulb. Surprising how much thought it takes to understand what is going on.  Once you get rid of Pre-Ynab debt it gets a lot easier. So make that a priority!!! You will never go back to the old way again (at least I won't).

ynab,3dosg3,SonOfTheSohoRiots,9,Sat Jul 18 04:14:34 2015 UTC,"Don't have a non-specific ""spending money"" category. Specify the actual categories you spend. Some people don't because they can't be bothered, or feel guilty spending so much on x so they hide it in 'spending money' - that stops you tracking and understanding your true spending habits, which is most of the point."
ynab,3dosg3,thewimsey,13,Sat Jul 18 01:31:00 2015 UTC,"I disagree with this.  Spending money is fungible.  It really doesn't matter whether I spend my discretionary money on books, or a movie, or music, or at a restaurant.  What matters is that I stay within my budget.  Data is only helpful to me to the extent it helps me with my budget.  Tracking books vs. movies vs. going out with friends doesn't help with this."
ynab,3dosg3,SonOfTheSohoRiots,4,Sat Jul 18 06:30:40 2015 UTC,"Hourses for courses. I feel much more in control with finer detail, especially with idle spending money which is what most often stole from my savings, pre-YNAB."

ynab,3dosg3,SonOfTheSohoRiots,6,Sat Jul 18 02:39:46 2015 UTC,"A friend puts entertainment, drinks, eating out, books, games, etc., all under one subcategory 'Spending money'. He has no idea how much he spends on thise specific things, but he doesn't care because ""it's all fun money anyway"". But what if he spends a disproportionate (even unhealthy) amount in one of those 'fun' categories, but can't see it because it's all bundled together with other things? He can't do the YNAB budgeting magic and reduce his budget for just, say, games, without affecting other expenses which don't need to be reduced."
ynab,3dosg3,thecw,2,Sat Jul 18 03:01:26 2015 UTC,"I've seen people with $300-500 per month in ""spending money"". I dialed my own way back when I realized it was hitting 150/month, although sometimes you can't help it if you make a big purchase that doesn't really belong anywhere else."
ynab,3dosg3,SonOfTheSohoRiots,3,Sat Jul 18 02:50:40 2015 UTC,"My point is more that it needs to be broken down into the specific types of spending money, rather than that there needs to be a hard limit on it. Though the more detail the more you can control it."

ynab,3dosg3,hmspain,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:14:04 2015 UTC,"I agree with this mostly, though I also believe that it is worthwhile having a 'Random Unexpected and Stupid Costs' category. If you do this properly then you have the specific categories for everything else, and should then use self discipline to use those categories for those purchases, even if they are big dollar buys. The 'RUSC' category comes into its own if you get pinged with something like a parking / traffic fine - something that's unexpected, but not what I would consider worthy of the emergency fund either."
ynab,3dosg3,hmspain,4,Mon Jul 20 01:58:49 2015 UTC,"It‚Äôs hard to make a serious mistake; YNAB is kinda bulletproof.  Stop sweating the details, things will change over time."

I know what my monthly bills are, but I couldn't tell you monthly averages for things like gas and food are. As long as I log everything and let a routine build up, I'll learn where I should budget more or less."
ynab,3dosg3,npepin,2,Sat Jul 18 02:42:11 2015 UTC,"Yup, it can be fun actually.  I think of it as a hobby, one that SAVES you money ;-).  Over time, your budget gets better and better, requiring fewer adjustments."
ynab,3dosg3,davidcwilliams,2,Sat Jul 18 06:29:49 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  I was on my way to suggest that you let yourself use the first couple of months to track your spending.  I stuck with YNAB because rather than trying to make dramatic changes right away, I used the first few months to become aware of what I was spending, and then SLOWLY cut back ($1-$10 per category per week).  It made my progress much more manageable and the adjustments much less painful.  It's the only budgeting I've ever been able to stick with."
ynab,3dosg3,FinibusBonorum,3,Sat Jul 18 18:24:49 2015 UTC,"That it is a lot easier than it seems. Eventually you get to a point where it becomes routine.  Something that happened that I didn't expect is that I'd be planning my financial goals two years out into the future. It really helps encourage you to make goals and to figure out a plan to make it happen.  A recent success I had was budgeting for my car registration 8 months in advanced. It is only $120, so I could have come up with it if I needed, but it felt so much better doing it this way. One big difference was that I wasn't so pissed off after having to pay for it, whereas the last couple times I've gotten my car registered, I was pretty pissed that the government was taking a third of my pack check just to support an unnecessary regulatory overhead."
ynab,3dosg3,somethingold,7,Sat Jul 18 06:46:15 2015 UTC,"That 'Christmas Gifts' and 'Birthday Gifts' is too general. I have to split it up into individual people. Otherwise, I wind up overspending on whoever I shop for first."
ynab,3dosg3,BUTT_SACKK,3,Sat Jul 18 01:21:45 2015 UTC,"I have a single ""gifts"" category. I fund it with $30 every month as that seems to match my average gift spending. Sometimes there's a balance, sometimes it's empty."

Using this idea, I've set up a new major category and I listed every person. When the time comes and my yearly Christmas budget is set I'm going to zero that money out and divy up the budget per person. That way we don't go over board on one kid opposed to the other. GREAT IDEA!"

You can also use the lightning button ‚ö°Ô∏è in the budget header to do all of them at once.   More:   Don't worry about the past. Start from today, going forward. I recommend reconciling each account when you get your monthly statement. Others recommend more often. Organize your categories in the way that makes sense to you. I like separating mandatory Bills and Essentials  (eg. groceries, medical), and important Savings, from Discretionary categories (dining, entertainment). Budget the important stuff first."
