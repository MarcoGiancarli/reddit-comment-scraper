If your video settings dont have any effect on the performance its probably struggling to run with that little ram.  Kill any non essential processes at the desktop before launching the game and max out the paging file and you may have better luck.  Or buy more RAM for the acer.

GTA is a great game, but on some things the devs have not got a clue.   every mission is mass murder for example, gangsters doing this would have the entire police force and the army after them. in GTA honk your horn at a cop and be shot to death... or watch some poor NPC driver be executed by a cop for grazing his car or bumping him.

If that doesn't work then buy another garage (10 car for 80k or so), and exchange it for the 2-car garage.. they should appear. If not then you need to go to rock star again.  It's sucky, but that's what fixed it for me. Buying a new garage even got my lost bicycles back"

gta5,3daogo,Doniu,5,Tue Jul 14 21:17:33 2015 UTC,"You could run Los Santos Connection a few times, or pretty much any contact missions.  The cheapest 10 car garage is $105k (that's 4 solo runs of LS Connection), though for most people it's probably worth paying the extra $15k to buy the one right next to LSC.  If you get your cars back, great. You can keep enjoying GTA:O without giving R* any more of your money. If not, you've lost an extra hour or so of game time. Depending on how many hours you've already invested, isn't one more worth it to keep enjoying the game?"

gta5,3d7jdc,Rusty4x4,3,Wed Jul 15 01:55:46 2015 UTC,Can you tow it out with a towtruck?
gta5,3d7jdc,Valyrian90,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:17:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you. This worked. Using Franklin, I called up Tonya and she gave me some towing assignment. Following this, I drove up to my garage and backed up to tow the car out. I really had to ram my way in to finally get the hook to latch onto the car.   Towing the car was odd. The car remained invisible  (minus the wheels), and the game seemed to interpret the car as weighing the equivalent of the wheels alone. The invisible car was flinging all over the road as I towed it. Yet, earlier, when I tried to push the car out of the garage using another vehicle, this invisible car seemed to weigh the equivalent of a truck. -__-   Anyway, I towed the car to the impound and put it in the garage. It took 45 minutes of clever maneuvering AND dodging of cop gunfire, but I got that motherfucker in there. Does this mean there's a chance I could retrieve it at a later time? Doubtful. But I have no idea how the impound system works, much less how it would treat an invisible car. Nevertheless, this experience felt like an accomplishment. :)"

I love the game, I really do, It's amazing, but my god.. some of it just makes no sense.  Like when you go to join a friend's session, rather then telling you it's full up front, saving you 5 mins of loading, it quits your lobby, then tries to join theirs, then tells you its full, then loads you into another new lobby, 5 mins later.  As far as actually not loading into story mode, I've never had that happen, only online mode. Sometimes it will just get stuck at 90% and sit there until you close the game and restart"

My rules are that I can only travel on foot and I can't use any weapons. Sometimes I do this in passive mode, so I'm mostly just trying to avoid getting run over by other players. Without passive mode it can be pretty hard to avoid getting sniped or blown up. The result is that I'm always looking for cover or high ground, which forces me to really see details in the buildings that I've never noticed before.   Have you seen the movie The Warriors?

gta5,3d4kar,NoblePouch,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:29:16 2015 UTC,Rockstar has published a statement about this. The only thing they can do is deleting the money you got from the hacker. Things you buy with it won't be deleted. So you better spent it as fast as possible. Got millions from a hacker two months ago and nothing has happened since then.
gta5,3d4kar,Coreshine,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:05:33 2015 UTC,"This. Spend it on cars, planes, helicopters, etc. Hackers dumping oodles of cash happens a lot. Spend it, or don't.  As an interesting execise, I suspect that if you buy things that can be later sold, you could then keep the resale cash without issues; it wouldn't flag as hacked money in Rockstar's logs.

There are missions that make a crapload of cash very easily. Being poor in-game is like being poor in real life: it happens because of the choices you make.  Eventually, Rockstar will get a grip on the exploits, and money will stabilize. Or, they won't, and money won't matter except as a metric for how hard a mission was. Right now, the latter is true. For me, I'll be an ""enterprising criminal"" and take advantage of the opportunities available.  Ultimately, there's a limit to how much money is useful in the game. That limit is met when you have all the clothes, 30 of the most expensive cars totally tricked out (since you can only have 3 garages) all the planes, helicopters and boats, and full ammo on all weaponry.  If you reach that point, even taking advantage of the hackers, you have played this game too much."

If any one of us join the same server as one of another, we immediately get disconnected.  Even when I'm playing solo, after 10 minutes on a server or so, everyone would get disconnected, but I assume I'm the only one that gets disconnected.

gta5,3cxpv1,I_eat_my_own_boogers,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:44:10 2015 UTC,"In my opinion its worth it completely. It's easy money but more importantly (to me, at least) it's easy RP. And the time it takes usually depends on the objectives the game gives you. Sometimes it has taken me not even 5 minutes to complete my objectives. On other days, though, it might take about an hour. Again, that's only if you get hard objectives that require you to play a game of Tennis or complete a Rally Race."

gta5,3c65co,EggsNbeans,3,Sun Jul 5 19:08:28 2015 UTC,"I'm still so confused with how lobbies even work.  One second I'm in a game with 5 people and then a minute later I press down arrow and it's full.  Or like you said, you're in a game with 25 people then everyone just quits at the same time and the lobby is empty. Then you have to go through several minutes of loading into a new lobby.. then it's empty, or there's 3 people.. then load again. Some nights I can join half a dozen lobbies in arow and they're all basically empty.   Other times I'm in a game with a couple friends, then all of a sudden they are gone.. and I'm in a completely different lobby. I'll open my map to see where my friends dots are, and they're just gone out of nowhere without saying they quit, but they didn't quit. I'll open my menu again and go to friends and join their game, the same 3-4 guys are still there, yet it's like it just merged me into a different game out of the blue.  It's almost like there is no rhyme or reason to how this stuff works.. it just kind of does what it wants to.   Now for the majority of the time, I can say it's fine. I love the game, probably my favorite game ever, but fucking hell online play can be pretty hard times.  And heist loading times? fuck me. Honestly some of the heists and setups take less time to complete than the combined loading time between the start up and then the black screen of nothingness for several minutes after youre done.

There is a ridge on the mountain side of the base that you can drive down in just about any vehicle and get in because it's higher than the fence. Also If you go to the tunnel under the base on that same side, there are two more inclines that you can ramp to get over the fence. One is immediately to the right of the tunnel. The other is at the end of the dirt road between the highway and the beach. All require a little trial and error and a reasonable fast vehicle or any motorbike."

You can sell a stolen car every 24 hrs of game time and 6 during 24 ""real life"" hours.  The modded Sentinel XS is the best selling and easiest to get your hands on.  It sells for around $17K and spawns up by eclipse towers between 23:00 and 4:00 game time (you can YouTube Sentinel XS spawn).

I used the same trick /u/Dorkamundo mentioned and now have about 2 billion cash per character. I've been using that to purchase all DLC content to try it out before I spend my hard earned money online.  Personally, I played the story mode on PS3.

If you have some friends to play it with the laughs will far out weigh any minimal short comings you might find with it. Also get used to dying, but understand that is one of the funniest parts of the game.   One questions though....what is your age?"

gta5,3bjgu1,VaderShake,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:34:25 2015 UTC,"Just asking, if you play online understand it's all about making cash in game so you can do certain things and rank up, which means grinding a bit. Since you're concerned about bit about risking $60 I don't think you will be buying Shark Cards (for in game $$) to save time.  I have found the younger crowd is not as fond of grinding as the older crowed who has been grinding at games for 30+ years,...I'm 41."
gta5,3bjgu1,Zezix,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:28:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not too sure I would classify it as grinding at all. To me, grinding means mindlessly killing the same shit over and over again to achieve levels, gear and money. Until you are high enough to go to the next area and do the same and so on and so forth. In gta, you have countless game modes and activities to do from level 1 to level up, gain money, etc. Just how I see it."

It keeps crashing after random amounts of time in game. Sometimes after 5 minutes, sometimes after an hour or two.

I've been trying to find out what's wrong with it for a week now. And I'm afraid of rockstar support because some hacker showered me with money one time and am not sure if they can see that activity and decide to ban me...

gta5,3bjgu1,Dvveller,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:16:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, the game is amazing. If you're getting it just for GTA online, then don't bother. However, the single player campaign is extremely good. Online is also a lot of fun, but you can't treat it like an MMO, like Rockstar tries to market it as. Online is for skyping with friends and goofing/playing together. Single player is for the more serious playing. Both are good though, the game is very very good, and I recommend it.   The price is a bit steep. They added in game currency for gta:online as a way to pretend that they are in on the steam sales. Still, 60$ is actually worth it imo."

Spent some time in a wall breach with a bounty. I got voted out of 3 sessions.  Found a glitch due to my laggy connection that day that makes proximity mines not go away upon explosion and stay to repeatedly kill players.  Basically got bored and did every asshole thing I know how to do in this game all day.  The consequence?  $2000 for good behavior and I now have a 5% discount at shops for good behavior reports from 90% of players.

Also, it just makes sense on a corporate, financial, and fan level.  I would suggest looking out for it this Summer, August, in fact (just well educated speculation).

I never touch the dam thing and it ran fine for the first 5 months I owned the game..doesn't make any sense  I don't think they even read my original help ticket, it was like 5 sentences long. It seems as if they only look at the subject of the support ticket ""online connectivity problems"" and then copypaste the generic help form. The only problem I have here is loading data from THEIR cloud server.. and they are blaming every piece of equipment I have, including my actual internet connection? wtf  MAKE SURE YOUR MODEM IS PLUGGED IN!!!!!!   We'd like to provide assistance with any Online-related issues with our connection troubleshooting guide:   Check all the physical devices on your network to ensure they are plugged in and powered on. Perform a connection test on each device connected to the network.   PlayStation 4 Connection Troubleshooting Guide http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps4/settings/nw_test.html  Note: In order to better understand your network and how it works please see the information below.  NAT Types Open Moderate Strict  Open NATs can connect to any of the three types. --> Probably the least common type Moderate can only connect to open and moderate. --> Probably the most common type Strict can ONLY connect to open. Strict NATs are a difficult problem with peer-to-peer games. Since most people don't have open NATs, the player with a strict NAT won't be able to find many joinable games.  Also, if the player with a strict NAT does manage to join a game, if another player with a moderate NAT joins later, the player with the strict NAT gets kicked out.  The problem is even worse since it is sometimes difficult for software (i.e. Games for Windows Live) to detect which NAT type it is running behind, and can often report that the player has a moderate NAT when they actually have a strict NAT.  Another problem is that sometimes the ISP (Internet Service Provider) is also NAT'd which often means even if you have a direct connection to the internet (without a router/firewall), the ISP still acts as a strict NAT.  Port Forwarding  The following ports are beneficial to have open for Online console gaming:  TCP: 53, 80, 443, 465, 983, 1863, 3074, 3478-3479, 3480, 5223, 10070-10080 UDP: 53, 88, 1863, 3074, 3478-3479, 3658, 10070  If you need assistance with opening these ports, please refer to the following website for more information (you will need to know your router brand and model, as the website guides are based on specific routers)  http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/routerindex.htm  Here are some additional tips that have helped many players improve their connectivity:  Make sure your router's firmware is upgraded the latest version (very important). Unplug your router for 10 minutes and plug it back in. Some older routers degrade in performance over time until it is rebooted, similar to a PC. Disable any firewall or other network filtering for the game. Enable uPnP (universal plug and play) on your router. If you don't care about security, enable DMZ (de-militarized zone) on your router for your PC's address. This turns off all of your router's firewall features for that specific PC. Contact your ISP and ask them what your DNS setting should be.   Direct Connection/Power Cycle  If you are still having issues connecting to the online servers after trying the above steps, try connecting your broadband modem directly to the console or PC on which you are playing this game. At this point, please disconnect your Broadband modem from power for Five (5) minutes. After this time has elapsed, plug the modem back into power and allow the normal power-up cycle to finish.  Information Needed to Move Forward  If this final step does not resolve your issue, please plug a PC directly into your modem and provide us screen shots from the following locations:  www.speedtest.net www.whatsmyip.org www.pingtest.net ipconfig (Windows + R > type ""cmd"" without quotes > hit okay > type ""ipconfig"" without quotes > press ENTER ) Your router's port configuration screen.

gta5,3aqpo4,Rafael502,2,Mon Jun 22 19:05:01 2015 UTC,It works the same way as the setup missions. Whoever is setting up/funding the heist controls who is invited. A lot of times they'll just send out a general invite to everyone and it will show up as a job on your phone.
gta5,3aqpo4,nDQ9UeOr,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:14:03 2015 UTC,"The actual heists fill up very fast, because of the amount of money you get for beating it.  I don't think there is any way to join specifically the heist and not setups  I'm also confused myself with the labeling on the invites you get on your phone  Sometimes it'll say HEIST, but no other text under it, then you join and it's the beginning of the heist, meaning you have to do the 4-5 setups. Other times it will say HEIST, with a bunch of text under it, describing the job, if it's describing the actual heist, thats the final heist mission"

It's at the ammunition that's located in the north east part of the city. You drive a car on the sidewalk between the building and the ledge (right of the door), get a top the car and just jump over the wall."
gta5,3aighr,gravityboi,2,Sat Jun 20 21:04:02 2015 UTC,"Tried it just now, took a picture from the back after I fell through the map and my parachute opened, hah.  I just thought of two more that you'll probably know about, but I'll just write them out for anyone else reading if anything. The first one is in Madrazo's house, where you can pretty much drive straight into his house on a motorbike, you just need to jump across a series of rooftops right next door first (on the east side, not west). Then when you finally get onto his porch (or whatever it's called) go as far left as you can into a tiny corner, and simply drive through the wall. If you walk far enough into his house, you'll also fall through the world.  The second one may be less impressive as it is not really a location as such, but might still be fun for some. Get a BF Injection (not sure if it works with other cars the same or similar height) go directly north of the biggest airstrip in the Grand Senora desert (not the top dirt one), and look for the part where the dirt road going alongside the airstrip (it should have a red wrecked car next to it) goes under and crosses the train tracks. Park your car there, and if done right, you are now standing upright inside you car, with some of your head sticking out on top. If you have any passengers, you can still take pictures of them sitting in the car. With some messing around with angles, you can also take some funky weird-ass glitch selfies where you see nothing but eyeballs, hair and teeth. You can walk around a bit, but sooner or later you're gonna slip 'out' of your car again."

Can't think of any other places like that right now. I did get into both Michael's and Lester's house in GTA online a while back, but I think they have fixed that glitch now, maybe even a few updates ago. (But I recall it was pretty fiddly, and took a few tries on both locations. You would stand on either roof, start a mission, then cancel it before you'd actually start it, and with a few tries you fall/morph through the roof/wall and would spawn inside their houses)"

gta5,3a4dny,TurtleSplash,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:28:01 2015 UTC,"I'm personally the wrong audience for this type of content as I'd much rather google a mission name to find a short description of what I'm supposed to do in case I'm stuck, instead of checking a 10 minute youtube video and trying to find the right place to get the information I need. I'll give my 2 cents anyway:  You seem to be relatively new on youtube and trying to make content for it, great! The problem is that you're trying to make content for a game that's nearly 2 years old and that over 50 million people have bought and most likely already finished.  Not only is there a smaller audience for a complete walkthrough because of the game's age, it also means that in those 2 years since the game has been out, hundreds (if not thousands) of youtubers have already finished what you just started doing. The vast majority of those youtubers have an established audience that will not only go to them for content first, but their videos will also rank higher in search results because of it.  This makes me question whether you've really thought this through. GTA5 is a big game to make a complete walkthrough for, and it will take a lot of time and effort to do so. Time and effort that feels wasted to me, for the reasons mentioned before.  If you're passionate about gaming and want to dedicate your time and effort into making a walkthrough for some games, at least do it for one where you might actually get some views and a regular viewership out of it. How about an indie game walkthrough that the bigger youtubers don't have the time to touch? Or if you're not into those, buy a brand new game and bust your ass trying to beat the bigger guys to the punch. Batman: Arkham Knight comes out in a week, try that instead.  I hope I don't come across as too negative. I applaud your effort, I just feel like you should focus on content that might actually get you some views."

To be honest though i have never played a single batman game to the end, but it would be funny watching me fail a lot and raging lol. So expect to see some Arkham Knight. Again thank you for your time and help."
gta5,3a4dny,eynsa,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:25:47 2015 UTC,"I just mentioned Batman as it's the next huge title to come out. You should probably focus on the next big thing you're passionate about, as I imagine making a full walkthrough for a game is a lot of work.  Honestly though, I wish you all the best. If you put in the time and stick with it, I'm sure the viewership will come."

gta5,3a372s,Doc_Phil,0,Thu Jun 18 02:08:03 2015 UTC,"The main benefit of a controller is fine control.   For example when you fly a helicopter by keyboard you cannot control your thrust. You are either at full power or no power, there is no middle ground. With a controller you are able to use the triggers and throttle as much or as little as you like.   Another example is turning in a car. If you use the joypad you can control your turning angle whereas with a keyboard you will either be turning or not turning (which means repeatedly having to tap the key during corners).   I grew up on KB&M so that's my preference, especially when it comes to shooting. But I think it's fair to say that when it comes to fine control of the vehicles, the controller is objectively better."
gta5,3a11x6,SexbassMcSexington,5,Tue Jun 16 11:46:20 2015 UTC,"Easiest way to check if its a lack of RAM would probably be to keep monitoring it. Open the task manager (shift+ctrl+escape) and go to the Performance tab. There's a little graph that shows how much RAM (memory) is in use and left available.  Now just go in-game, run a mission and whenever you get a huge framedrop, alt tab to see how much RAM you have/had in use."

gta5,3a11x6,booobp,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:30:49 2015 UTC,"GTA has serious issues with frame rate drops. Particularly when it drops to ~20fps. I also suffer from this. Usually I'm hitting 70fps, but enter a mission or drive down a road and all of sudden BAM 20fps and tons of stutter.   4GB of RAM is plenty for GTA. I rarely find it uses more than 2.4GB/16GB I have.  So yea, its not you its the game. Other friends of mine have bene having similar issues but it seems mostly random. It's been massively worse since the last update. Really hope Rockstar fix it.   Edit: For reference"

Now what you want to do is go to the vending machine and put on your mask of choice, then once you've done that, buy a soda, (once he raises it to his lips you can press M) press m > go to inventory, accessories > and outfits, put on the outfit and once you're done buying the soda, he should re-appear with the mask on.

Right off the bat, people will see the 8 minute duration and skip your video especially if they don't know what they're in for. You mentioned in the video that you were going to get new equipment. A decent microphone goes a long way, and they can be pretty affordable. I use a Zoom H2 field recorder, along with a pop filter, and used ones are going for $90. Until then, you can edit your voice recordings with some EQ and compression to make them sound a little nicer. Audacity is a free program that'll work for you. You're kinda just driving around, which is what we've all done plenty of times. Throw something different into the mix: bring an online buddy with you in the car rides, etc. Cut out loading times from the video."

gta5,39nl00,EVOSexyBeast,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:02:54 2015 UTC,"Well the hacker lobbies are generally lobbies with a ton of people in them. The chances of meeting a hacker in a game with more than 15 people is like 50%. If you are in smaller lobbies, hackers are rarely there, of if they are, they don't really show themselves. \  I think it comes down to hackers like to grief and if you can grief in a world of 15+ people instead of a world with 5-6, then its a lot more effective and fun."

gta5,39nwlo,GetGhettoBlasted,2,Sat Jun 13 02:58:58 2015 UTC,"No man, definitely not. I run a i5-2500k and (IIRC) a GTX760 Ti with 8G DDR3 and I am getting 30 FPS on 1440x900 with all settings low.  I upgraded from a Pentium g3258 which increased my FPS by about 5. 30 is like the bare minimum to get relatively lag free (FPS lag wise) gameplay. You won't ever be able to be a master killer (imagine playing CSGO at 30 FPS), but you can still have fun, especially as GTA5 is more casual. What Tagno said about an OC i5-2500k and OC 970 is probably the best way to go."

gta5,39nwlo,Tegno,1 point,Sat Jun 13 09:02:55 2015 UTC,I've read that an overclocked i5-2500k and an overclocked nvidia 970 is the cheapest configuration to get the advertised frame rates at max settings in 1080p  I actually get 30+ in 4k as well with some shadow aliasing turned down.  the game loves high clock speeds so try to overclock whatever you have the best you can with better cooling.

It seems after the update there's a small issue with the main account name for some users on Steam. If the new account works for you contact R* support to find a work around so you don't have to keep a different windows user account.  Windows 8/8.1 new account: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8  Windows 7 new account: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-7  Windows Vista new account: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-vista  Hope this helps you.

gta5,39ic16,ThebenjaminCOD,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:30:57 2015 UTC,"Did this one a few times this week, my favorite failure was as follows  2 guys in our game who haven't done this heist yet, everything is going smoothly though after about 6 damn restarts. We're on the bikes and headed for the river finally, we die a few more times but eventually make it.   We're up in the mountains almost there, I'm on the mic telling the guys about how to do the end, coming up to the bridge, drive over it then you'll see one last yellow waypoint on the rock, just drive right through it full speed off the cliff and jump out. I made sure to repeat this several times.  of course, the only guy without a mic, I guess he had chat turned off as well.. well me and the guy in back come around the corner, see the guy without a mic outside of his car, parked his car in the last waypoint then went walking over to the edge of the cliff to jump.. either falls off the cliff and down to his death or just jumps in a spot where there isn't enough room to open your chute, either way he dies andn then quits.  Good times.   On the flip side of that, I join one last night, no setups nothing, straight into heist, we mess up a couple times (I died once right at the end going through the tunnel up in the mountains - i was in back and felt like the biggest failure) but overall, spent like 25-30 mins tops in the game, and left with $250k!   This heist gives me anxiety every single time"
gta5,39ic16,EggsNbeans,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:29:25 2015 UTC,"Hahahahahaha.... that's F*uctup! Im sorry for my late reaction, i didnt get a message from my email that somebody replay.. Its a really good heist, i like it a lot! But this video, i think a lot people died at the end of the heist. Sometimes its better to take a look how you must do the heist or someone knows what to do, but put on your headphone! hahahahaha...."
gta5,39ic16,EggsNbeans,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:28:14 2015 UTC,"but put on your headphone!   ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I Can't stress this enough!!!  So many people don't seem to understand that you need to communicate oh most heists, even setups.  Everyone wants to jjust joint and go Rambo and do everything by themselves to show off.   I learned a new way to do this heist last night, without having to do the whole apartment glitch where you drive your own Karuma the whole way. I personally don't like ""glitching"" to beat things, but a guy in our game did it so.. oh well, easy money.  new way I learned last night.. no ""glitching"", but just as safe: once you get on the bikes at the very end for the getaway, go down the alley and turn left onto the road like you normally would. There is a SWAT van at that first road block, kill the couple cops there, everyone get in the swat van and then you can just cruise to the end in the SWAT van without worrying about gun fire or crashing.   We also took the west highway up north, as it's probably a lot quicker than trying to drive all those windy mountain roads in the slow ass SWAT van, might not even make it in time that way, so you drive West out of the city and straight to the highway that runs up the west coast. We got to the dingy with about 2 minutes to spare, still have a wanted level when you get there though so you gotta get in the boat and go quick. Much easier than risking it on the motorcycles though, no chance for anyone to die, no worrying about that guy who is always a mile behind and keeps crashing his motorcycle.   Sorry for the long post again, I really love this heist. I personally prefer to do it the right way, on the bikes, but a lot of people die too much and it's a pain in the ass. But given a decent team, I love the getaway, the base jump off the clifs, the whole mission is awesome."

Also there should be a bullet-proof rear window only option for all cars.

Wrote a ticket right after, and a few hours later, they responded and pulled the money out.  I didn't get banned, but a lot of those i have played with, has gotten banned for months, just for picking them up, and using them.

Frostbite wasn't developed for that, it was made to make you feel like your in a warzone, which it does fantastically well. Also, Rockstar's engine is fantastically polished, and the life expectancy of the game is going to be at least the next couple years, so when GTA 6 does become a thing, the engine will be updated and the game will look fantastic. Also, what platform are you on? Console, Pc?"
gta5,38xa8v,booobp,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:04:37 2015 UTC,"I don't know if the BF4 version of Frostbite could even handle open world, and the many multiple and random AI. Also, It's EA restricted, so Rockstar couldn't.  The destruction of Frostbite is great and the audio. GTA 5 looked a lot better to me than BF4 does. Same as the Witcher 3 looks nicer than Battlefield too, and that's on the RED engine.   If anything can't wait to see AAA titles on Unreal 4."
