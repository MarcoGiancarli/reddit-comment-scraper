I'm never going to use the strategy myself, but I'm also not going to inconvenience my gameplay for AI triggering a bug on itself. You just got lucky I guess, congrats on that front :)"
FFRecordKeeper,3e3ies,MensUrea,2,Tue Jul 21 19:17:05 2015 UTC,This happend to me in the NORG fight q.q With wakka reels

FFRecordKeeper,3e3ies,Oscredwin,2,Tue Jul 21 21:43:23 2015 UTC,"Exact same thing happened to me, amusingly. I didn't need it at all, but it was hilarious watching him do Protect after I'd already queue'd up Deprotega to increase my damage...then his very next turn using Protect again.   Seymour uses Suicide: it's super effective!"
FFRecordKeeper,3e3ies,Kevrlet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:45:53 2015 UTC,Happened to me with Reels. Fair game.

FFRecordKeeper,3e3ies,Nelo_Meseta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:06:02 2015 UTC,Only if the boss is resistant to breaks/breakdowns.
FFRecordKeeper,3e3ies,ViiktorH,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:29:48 2015 UTC,Yeah happened to me too.  Wakka's SB did it (seymour's final form).  He was going to lose anyway but that certainly sped it up.  Completely unintentional.
FFRecordKeeper,3e3ies,iamfrankfrank,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:45:56 2015 UTC,"Can't help but laugh when bosses do this.  xD  I had an accidental VIT0 against Norg.  Good thing too, because I completely underestimated his HP pool (and overestimated my damage output).  I was hitting for 1500 per strike prior to him VIT0-ing himself, and I forgot to put Zealot on someone to reset the orbs."
FFRecordKeeper,3e3ies,irismist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:06:09 2015 UTC,"No, because the game has decided to fuck with me for the last few days and won't give any of my FS's with DeProtectga."

FFRecordKeeper,3e3ies,ZinZilicious,4,Tue Jul 21 18:02:55 2015 UTC,Accidental though? I didn't realise it was such a naughty word lol.    Oh well. If I'm down voted better stay off the internet until I'm forgiven. Sticks and stones may break my bones but downvotes will always hurt me.
FFRecordKeeper,3e3ies,pintbox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:07:19 2015 UTC,"Ugh, there is a wave of downvotes going on this board. If you are downvoted it's probably have nothing to do with your title."

FFRecordKeeper,3e38lf,jimmyen,3,Tue Jul 21 18:52:29 2015 UTC,As if Quistis' ladyboner for Squall was even contained while she was his instructor.  She was hella disappointed when it turned out Squall had to go to the ACTUAL fire cavern.
FFRecordKeeper,3e38lf,Erekai,2,Tue Jul 21 19:22:47 2015 UTC,"Never played much FF8 at all, but I've always liked what little I know about Quistis as a character.  I also think her sprite looks pretty sharp, so I'd say it's pretty likely I'm gonna use her a fair bit.  I'll try a little bit for her whip, but I can't spend too much mythril on this event.  Hope my luck turns around.  My pulls for the last 3-4 events have all been terrible to the point of near man-tears."
FFRecordKeeper,3e38lf,chroipahtz,2,Tue Jul 21 16:53:46 2015 UTC,Yo. Play FF8. It's interesting at the very least because of its weird mechanics and the places the story goes.
FFRecordKeeper,3e38lf,Erekai,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:03:12 2015 UTC,It's on my Steam wish list.  I intend to some day :P
FFRecordKeeper,3e38lf,Erekai,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:22:51 2015 UTC,"Good luck my friend! Quistis can use 4* support, so you can bring with you mental breakdown! It's true that Terra can use 4* support too, and that she's got slightly better stats and equipment options, but unlike Quistis she won't be getting her MC for several months."
FFRecordKeeper,3e38lf,irismist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:17 2015 UTC,"I really wish I had Terra.  As a FF6 fanboy, the only character I want more than her is Edgar (which is what I'm saving all my mythril for).  But until then, I guess Quistis will suffice. :)  And good luck to you as well, I assume you'll do at least a few pulls?"
FFRecordKeeper,3e38lf,Erekai,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:11:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've saved quite a lot of Myrhril. I'm thinking of doing the 100 gems pull and an 11-pull"
FFRecordKeeper,3e38lf,irismist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:12:41 2015 UTC,"Edgar/Sabin event is right after the Quistis/Selphie event, so if you're saving up for him, don't spend too much on this one.  Unless you have a lot of unfinished Quests and classic/elite dungeons, you will not be able to amass 50 Mythrils between 2 events.  Also, there's a chance they'll add Terra as a quest reward when the next event comes out for people who missed her first time around.  There's hope.  :)"
FFRecordKeeper,3e38lf,Sesquicentennial,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:22:41 2015 UTC,"Indeed.  Currently I have something like... 63 or so Mythril.  I plan on doing the 100gem pull just like I do on all events, then maybe a 15 mythril pull.  I might just do a couple singles, though, cause I really want as much mythril as possible for Edgar/Sabin.  Heck, I might even throw down money for an 11-pull with gems, that's how pathetic of a FF6 fanboy I am."
FFRecordKeeper,3e38lf,irismist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:26:03 2015 UTC,"I wish you good luck!  :)  I think I'm that way about Rinoa.  I'm half hoping they'll release her Valkyrie again tonight (they did for JP, but it was a Valentine's Day special so we might not get it here) so that I can try my luck on it again.  But at the same time, I know I need to save up for Lightning/Sazh and the next character soul break celebration.  Oh decisions..."
FFRecordKeeper,3e38lf,SquallLeonhartVIII,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:37:21 2015 UTC,"If you wait for a long long while, Rinoa's third RW is even better than the first.  If you only care about the most bang for your mythril.    That would make it easier to spend on Lightning/Sazh if you really wanted too, and wait for the third RW of Rinoa instead."
FFRecordKeeper,3e38lf,Benergy84,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:48:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I tried pulling for her SSB too (didn't get it lol).  I did get Squall's first gunblade and Zell's weapons though, so I can't complain too much.  Valkyrie does get released again, during Seifer's event on the second banner.  Though by then, the utility of Angel Wing Bolt will be much less due to so many other great SBs.  Ah well, tis life.  :)"
FFRecordKeeper,3e38lf,Sandslice,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:55:10 2015 UTC,I just read that scene you linked...and obviously I'm a fan of FFVIII...  ...But that made me laugh so hard I literally just about fell out of my desk at work! That person is a comic genius. I'm glad I'm not the only one who pictured Robin Williams playing Cid in a live action movie of FFVIII.

FFRecordKeeper,3e38lf,AlexCiiiid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:32:03 2015 UTC,"I'm ready. I have a lot of good FFVIII gear, so I don't think I'll feel tempted to spend as much mythril :)"
FFRecordKeeper,3e38lf,AlexCiiiid,0,Tue Jul 21 18:03:23 2015 UTC,immediately thought of this : https://youtu.be/ona-RhLfRfc :p
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,Kevrlet,4,Tue Jul 21 20:28:42 2015 UTC,"Finally someone who tested it. I've been wondering for some time now, but never wanted to use the Orbs. Somehow there are alot of conflicting statements abou this topic.  I'll still use Valefor though, because the Major Wind Orbs don't have any (practical) use outside of Valefor."
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,scytherman96,3,Tue Jul 21 20:33:41 2015 UTC,Quick Hit is probably not worth dismissing straight away. I have a feeling it's got a high multiplier on it.
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,Raion_sao,2,Tue Jul 21 20:36:01 2015 UTC,Dodging the cast time is still really nice with quick hit.
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,scytherman96,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:48:04 2015 UTC,"Well since the only thing it does is skip the attack charge-up, i don't think it's worth, even with a high multiplier."
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,StuffNDings,2,Tue Jul 21 20:59:51 2015 UTC,"All Pound does is a high multiplier. Granted, the times that spending Major Orbs on a skill that hits one target hard really fast is justifiable will be pretty limited..."
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,hinode85,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:09:14 2015 UTC,"on that note, its a 2.8(or 2.5) multiplier. Quick Hit can be super useful for countdown bosses EX++, but yeah the orb count is redunkulous."
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,zz_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:02:05 2015 UTC,"MisterP's pdf and ElNinoFr's spreadsheet list Quick Hit with a 2.4x multiplier, while Enlir's spreadsheet says QH is 2.5x.  Either way, it'd be the clear winner for physical DPS except for the minor problem of being basically impossible to create/hone."
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,Necrofamicom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:57:50 2015 UTC,"I asked ElNino if I was safe to use the 5* wind on Valefor and he said that Quick Hit is the only good alternative, but the problem is it needs to be honed to be worth bringing."
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,Mithrane,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:00:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's pretty much what I'd thought as well. By the time you'll even be considering Quick Hit you'll be able to (slowly and unreliably) farm Majors from EX daily anyway."
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,smoothjk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:07:06 2015 UTC,"Maduin isn't weaker than Valefor. I actually thought his multiplier was a little higher than Valefor's, but it turns out it's exactly the same.  Maduin is worse than Valefor, though, because he takes a lot more orbs to hone overall. You'd be better off crafting a second Valefor than Maduin."
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,Necrofamicom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:38:32 2015 UTC,It depends on what orbs you got though
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,aryantes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:47:45 2015 UTC,"That depends on how easy it becomes later to get 4* orbs. If it's easy, Manduin will be easier to hone since Valefor requires some 5*. But I agree with you that the latter is easier to hone at the current time.   Also the OP is correct. I use both summons and they seem identical in multiplier/damage."
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,Necrofamicom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:48:35 2015 UTC,"Setting aside the 5* wind orbs for the moment, Valfor takes 115 Greater Summon Orbs, 69 Greater Non-Elemental Orbs and 115 Greater Wind Orbs, or 299 4* orbs total to craft and hone to rank 5.  Maduin takes 230 Greater Summon Orbs and 115 Greater Non-Elemental Orbs, or 345 4* orbs to create and hone to rank 5. And those Greater Summon Orbs don't grow on trees.  15 Major Wind Orbs is nothing compared to 115 Greater Summon orbs."
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,Marintha,0,Tue Jul 21 21:06:31 2015 UTC,"15 Major Wind Orbs is nothing compared to 115 Greater Summon orbs.   This would be up for debate I think.   We don't know the drop rates of 5* orbs in the future, but as of right now, with 5* orbs being reward only and not farmable, it is definitely easier to get 115 summon orbs from repeating event boss fights."
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,Halloperidol,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:28:53 2015 UTC,"Sure we do, same as in the Japanese game. Trust me, it's far easier to get 15 5* Wind Orbs than 115 4* summon orbs."
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,pastryoverlord,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:39:29 2015 UTC,"Juuust to clarify, I thought I saw someone say in one of the Yuna guides that HER version of Valefor (SB) uses her attack stat to calculate damage - rather than her Magic.  Has anyone proven that? I know I just read it in passing, but if Valefor naturally is decent, maybe hers isn't terrible. :P"
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,hinode85,3,Tue Jul 21 20:54:59 2015 UTC,"I'll check. One sec.  EDIT: Nope. Based on her MAG stat. Grand Summon I is action_id 5, which is MagicAttackAction. I just threw a strong rod on her and used it to double check. Definitely MAG-based damage.  EDIT2: It's still a weak attack though. Barely stronger than Tyro's default."
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,pastryoverlord,2,Tue Jul 21 20:58:32 2015 UTC,"I've been saying this the whole time, but no one on chat believed me. :( There's no way Yuna could hit for 1k damage if this was based on her ATK unless the multiplier was huge, but she does. Is that impressive? No. Doesn't mean it isn't MAG damage though. Thanks for confirming."
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,19-200,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:24:52 2015 UTC,"Just curious - Yuna's default SB does some pretty paltry damage, so how low exactly is the multiplier? It sounds great initially that it's based on her MAG, but from my experience the damage is only marginally better than Terra's default SB which I've heard is based on ATK."
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,krissco,3,Tue Jul 21 21:22:11 2015 UTC,"On the upside, it's still about 12% stronger than Rydia's Chocobo SB with its mighty 0.98x multiplier!"
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,krissco,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:47:18 2015 UTC,"Chocobo: ""Imma trample you to death - KWEH KWEH""  only gets a paper cut  (but really, chocobos are awesome.)"
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,pastryoverlord,2,Tue Jul 21 21:55:26 2015 UTC,It's got 110 potency. It's tied for weakest default SB with Fires of War and Oblivion :/
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,eddierips,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:25:55 2015 UTC,"I thought Tyro's (and Rydia's) were the lowest... 105(?) potency giant sword from the sky, hooray?"
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,Marintha,2,Tue Jul 21 21:52:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah...forgot about those because their potency is lower than the healing SBs. Tyro is indeed 105, and Rydia is...dum dum dummmmm....98!"
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,Rot1nPiecesOnTwitch,2,Tue Jul 21 21:54:12 2015 UTC,"Also for the record, Terra's default SB is pretty respectable (175 potency) - it's just that her ATK stat is low. Give her Zantetsuken and she can do decent damage with it. But why would you ever do that? XD  EDIT: Brain farted. Terra can't use Katanas. Duh."
FFRecordKeeper,3e44rg,Rot1nPiecesOnTwitch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:41:59 2015 UTC,Double brain fart - Zantetsuken is a Sword.

FFRecordKeeper,3e33c1,pksage,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:39:39 2015 UTC,The chance of drawing a specific 5* Relic is still ~1% though. Only the number of 5* Relics on a banner is raised.
FFRecordKeeper,3e33c1,Thatonedataguy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:34:19 2015 UTC,Japan also has a thing where you gain an increased chance at a 5* draw the more draws you do without a 5* dropping.
FFRecordKeeper,3e33c1,Thatonedataguy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:33:58 2015 UTC,"I've seen this said a lot, but no proof. Since you can see the rates spelled out on the relic list in the JP client, I did a one-pull, didn't get a 5*, and checked those rates -- but it still said 12%. Is there any empirical data out there for this claim?"
FFRecordKeeper,3e33c1,Erekai,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:10:50 2015 UTC,"I believe there was an announcement that stated it.  I would also say that the increase from 2 character relics per banner to 4 is a really nice change, which effectively doubles your chance at getting a character weapon."
FFRecordKeeper,3e33c1,-StormDrake-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:21:29 2015 UTC,"As for actual proof...  I just looked at the data sent between the client and server, and compared it to the global version.  Global has three properties: equipments, prob_by_item, and prob_by_rarity.  Equipments has equipment data, and the JP version is the same, although there is obviously other info. (Mostly from the new augmenting system, labeled as ""hammer"" here.)  prob_by_items has the item info, and also contains a probability field, which says what the % of the item appearing is. This property is no longer in the JP client, probably because this data is now dynamic, rather than static. (Too bad.. was hoping to get some concrete numbers on how the probability changes.)  prob_by_rarity just has the 3=### 4=### 5=### and nothing else. Nothing special, although I will double check this after I do some pulls on the 14 event tomorrow morning.  Sorry this isn't actually conclusive or anything, but it's all I got."
FFRecordKeeper,3e33c1,eddierips,2,Tue Jul 21 22:05:04 2015 UTC,"I'm actually not all that in-favor of the health bars.  I kinda like the mystery of not knowing how much HP an enemy has left.  But oh well, I'm sure they'll grow on me.  Probably will just make it easier to Master stuff anyway."
FFRecordKeeper,3e33c1,xMatttard,2,Tue Jul 21 16:51:24 2015 UTC,"Same here.  I'm kind of hoping it is an option, something I can turn on and use if I like it, turn off if not."

You enjoy not knowing how close you come to beating a stage? I'm stuck on Seymour right now I have no idea if I'm close enough to keep S/L until I beat him, or if I should give up and run other quests.  You enjoy having no idea how to pace your abilities?

It's his opinion that a lucky set of pulls on a banner that isn't new fails to contribute.  Personally, I think the link sets a bad example. People without an actual understanding of statistics will do their own 3-pulls because of stuff like this, when in reality they're basically leaving free mythril on the table by not waiting for an 11-pull, because a 3-pull costs 5 mythril per item and 11 costs 4.545454545 per item.

FFRecordKeeper,3e21um,skuldnoshinpu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:53:21 2015 UTC,"Turns out the description of Sentinel is wrong, then. Multiple tests have shown it does not affect DEF or RES, but is a straight 60% reduction AFTER damage calculations. Other recent SBs that are described as raising party stats actually do affect the damage calculation itself. Anyway we'll see, but based on Lulu's Focus and Leonhart's Koutei no Utsuwa it'll probably be the latter."

FFRecordKeeper,3e21um,Enlir,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:26:14 2015 UTC,"Sentinel Grimoire increases DEF and RES by +200% (basically a 3x multiplier). This is equivalent to a ~60% damage reduction (3-0.84 = 0.4). Unlike ATK and MAG, DEF and RES have no soft cap, so there's no pratical difference in describing it as a stats boost or a damage reduction, but if you take a look at the game code you'll see that what it actually does is increasing the stats."
FFRecordKeeper,3e21um,skuldnoshinpu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:49:30 2015 UTC,"Hmm, OK, guess I was mistaken. We'll have to see what the new relic does but again the more recent party wide buffs are along the lines of +20% for offensive stats and +50% for defensive stats, which would make it far inferior to Sentinel if that's the case."
FFRecordKeeper,3e21um,Enlir,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:25:19 2015 UTC,"Well, not mistaken, it's just another way to see the effect. About the comparison with the other relics, it's all a matter of numbers. Sentinel Grimoire is indeed on a different level compared to all other stats SB."
FFRecordKeeper,3e21um,skuldnoshinpu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:57:33 2015 UTC,"Well if the banner is wrong described then it isn't my problem and hey, who wants to bring Tyro if you can have another choices for similar effects, it's good for players to have different character with Sentinel Grimoire Soul Break effect so you can get rid of Tyro."
FFRecordKeeper,3e21um,fattybomchacha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:58:13 2015 UTC,"It's a question of magnitude. I guess I was mistaken on functionality but as others have pointed out Sentinel is a +200% multiplier. Meanwhile recent buff SBs like Focus and Koutei no Utsuwa are only +50% to RES and DEF, respectively. So we'll just have to see what the multiplier is, if it's more in line with recent SBs it'll probably be just DEF/RES+50% which would make it far inferior to Sentinel. Guess we'll find out soon enough."

Note: I  have a feeling this means that Y'shtola's default SB is Stoneskin I.  3) Light armour for Thancred: Spy's Armour/Mail.  Soul Break: Lit. Blood Flower Early-Summer Rain. Alt. Blood Blossom Five Month Rain. AoE attack and huge chance to slow.  4) Robe for Y'shtola: Hero's Robe  Soul Break: Lit. Medicara. Aka Medica II. Cura(ga?) level AoE heal and AoE Esuna.  5) Sword: Lit. Kattsu Balgel. Aka (Cobalt) Katzbalger (ty /u/keytsang) I don't recognise this blade, if anyone does and knows it's English name, I'll edit it in.  Shared Soul Break: Blade of Devotion? (second kanji is so blurry). Single target attack and raise user's attack.  6) Rod: Keep of Saints  Shared Soul Break: Collapse. Single target non-elemental magic attack.  7) Hat: Lit. Evoker's Horn. Note: Evoker = Summoner.  Shared Soul Break: Lit. Wairus. Aka Virus. Single target magic attack and decreases magic stat.  8) Bow: Lominsan Bow.  9) Armlet: Noble Armguard"

I have really good equipment as well, but the biggest thing I did was to put the 2x cut RM on Yuna and retaliate Cloud.  I didn't bother to bounce Tidus or Wakka off of him, but having your white mage double strike for good damage is key.  I also attacked him with Vivi until Anima, then I used Firaja.  Armor break and mental breakdown are also huge.  I didn't drop my curaga, but I'd agree that it's possible. I probably used it once and that was R1 to top off before sentinel grimoire landed.  Once that's up and you have landed magic/power breakdown you shouldn't be healing at all.  Two SG charges will carry you through Anima and then one Carbuncle will be all you need to finish up."

Also, maybe I'd suggest Carbuncle Rank 1 instead of Kirin for Seymour after you kill Anima to reflect his damage."

This is chosen on a scale of 3, either:   Not so useful - This relic is very mediocre in comparison to some/many of its colleagues. It is not worth pulling specifically for this relic. Situational - It's helpful, but not ""amazing"" or ""great."" However, if you don't have one of these items or something similar, it might be worth it to take the plunge. Very Useful - Unquestionably a good relic that ""makes sense"" to pull for, especially if you don't have an item similar to it.

This weapon is truly a game-changer. Note the following:   Although the MND stat is less than the Magistral Rod, the difference is minimal. The weapon actually has some ""decent"" ATK for a rod, which allows Selphie to do basic damage if needed. The SB is just amazing, even surpassing Aeris' Guard Rod in terms of potency.   If you have the Magistral Rod, then this weapon is still useful due to its SB being so OP, but I wouldn't pull specifically for it if I had a decent healing rod. Personally, I would LOVE to get my hand on one of these, but I wouldn't put it up for a friend summon because healing RWs tend to be shunned in favor of AoE damage ones.

Her ability to use Breakdowns cannot be overlooked now that Support roles are becoming increasingly needed. Support roles need to be able to attack, but this whip is not meant for dishing out physical damage, even though you can do equal damage in the backrow with it. The strength in this weapon lies in the MAG stat, which is quite decent. This allows her, like Rydia, to dish out Black Magic damage (she can use up to 4* ) while she's Breakdowning the mobs so they can accept the pain that they deserve. This is important because MAG usually cuts through mobs much easier than physical attacks, so Quistis is really able to pull out all stops. Furthermore, her SB is not only based on her MAG stat, but it's Non-Elemental, so there is NO resistance. Honestly, this whip is an awesome addition to anyone looking to get the foot in the door with the mage meta...

That makes any light armor very valuable for characters that can wear it. For characters who can equip other heavy armor as well, the light armor just wins all around (unless the heavy armor has an awesome SB) because the RES is much higher, whereas heavy armor only has marginally better DEF. Even characters who can equip bangles, bracers, and robes as well as light armor will find that light armor is more helpful in cases where the boss is doing lots of physical attacks.  Clearly, when you line up both of these featured light armor, the Raijin's Vest beats the Balamb Garden Uniform due to the AoE shared SB. However, even if you pull the latter, you are still ahead because it will likely beat the pants off anything that Cloud (as an example) is wearing. Light armor is great, go light armor! YEY!

Nobody would put this weapon on their black magic caster if they had a rod they could use instead. That being said, this weapon actually works semi-well on Quistis if you are going up against a boss that requires ranged attacks. It might work out in just such a niche example when you want to cast magic, use support, and physically attack when you run out of spells. [EDIT: Quistis is not able to use Thrown weapons. The only ranged weapon she can use is her whip. This leaves Fujin's Chakram as a very lackluster weapon due to its lower ATK than other ranged weapons. This leaves the weapon very situational at best.] Rating - Situational  Minotaur Plate    Relic Type Stats (Level 20) Stats (Level 20) RS Stats (Level 30) Stats (Level 30) RS Notes    Minotaur Plate Heavy Armor DEF +110, RES +50, EVA 102 DEF +188, RES +93, EVA 102 DEF +125, RES +58, EVA 102 DEF +234, RES +119, EVA 102 AoE Shellga SB to whole party   Dark Armor (FFIV) Heavy Armor DEF +114, RES +63, EVA 100, ATK +5 DEF +190, RES +106, ATK +5 DEF +129, RES +71, EVA 100, ATK +5 DEF +236, RES +132, ATK +5 Dark Cecil only SB.

Statwise, there is nothing very special about this armor. It has slightly lower DEF and RES than some other heavy armors. Where this armor shines (pun intended) is the AoE Shellga that you can get. Currently, there is no Shellga spell, but, even when there is, this armor is still helpful for mitigating magical damage, which makes up for the low RES that is traditionally on heavy armor.

I wouldn't pull for this specifically, however. Rating - Not so useful    tl;dr - I would personally do at least two 11x pulls, for sure at least one.

FFRecordKeeper,3e0qs3,19-200,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:35:48 2015 UTC,It's not a weak sword. The ATK gain you get over other swords is arguably minimal compared to the SB that is sorely lacking on it.
FFRecordKeeper,3e0qs3,19-200,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:50:53 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda mixed on shared SBs. I like the party buff ones. The damage ones could be a tiny bit better to compensate for the lower stats. Character SB weapons have the highest stats and the best SBs. You'd think the non-SB weapons would at least have the best stats to compensate for it not having an SB but instead, the character SB ones just outclass the non-SB ones outright. Whereas the shared SB is more comparable to the non-SB ones due to the trade off on stats vs SB.  I guess it's hard to complain. Being able to replace a crappy SB is good utility on its own. Plus a lot of the time they have special elements that can save you slots for medal requirements (Wind on the Fujin's Chakram and Holy on the Full Metal Staff and Water on the FFXII light armor). I just dislike some of them like the Black Robes from FFIX. It's a weak AoE fire attack which generally isn't that useful for mages.

Mind isn't nearly as important to stack into the stratosphere as magic is, currently, and even magic isn't that critical thanks to Vivi's Devotion materia. The 20% magic boost from that should push -ga spells over the damage cap against weaknesses and to 6-7k on neutral targets.  Of course, the AOE heal SB is very, very, very useful and that is certainly a reason to attempt to get Selphie's nunchuks."
FFRecordKeeper,3e0qs3,notalltogether,2,Tue Jul 21 05:57:13 2015 UTC,Should I pull if my only decent mage weapon is the same as my healing weapon (Magesterial Rod)? I'm debating a 3 pull.
FFRecordKeeper,3e0qs3,dscotton,3,Tue Jul 21 04:23:15 2015 UTC,"I would wait, that rod is pretty good in both roles."
FFRecordKeeper,3e0qs3,FaptainAmericaTx,0,Tue Jul 21 05:38:03 2015 UTC,Thanks!
FFRecordKeeper,3e0qs3,Angelwatch42,0,Tue Jul 21 12:47:13 2015 UTC,"Probably do the 3-pull if that is your ONLY decent mage weapon. If you have more mage weapons that are decent (event a 4*+) then you can save. If not, 15 mythril is not much and you might get lucky ;)"
FFRecordKeeper,3e0qs3,thatguyp2,2,Tue Jul 21 10:19:43 2015 UTC,"I'm going to pull for the Light Armors actually. As OP pointed out, 5* Light Armors are rare, and I really want some."

FFRecordKeeper,3e0qs3,robaisolken,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:26:56 2015 UTC,"You can still use a better mage weapon, in my opinion. I would pull on this banner because, even if you get the Morning Star and not the whip, you still come out ahead as a BM weapon over your Empyrean Rod+."
FFRecordKeeper,3e0qs3,_Khaleesi-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:42:25 2015 UTC,I'll be the detractor on this one.  Power creep is always an eventual thing and the SB celebration in 1-2 months are likely to have a couple magic weapons on a banner and a few other more desirable ones.  If I had a Judgement Staff I'd be plenty happy right now.  Of course I'll admit to being a hypocrite though as I'll be 11 pulling myself.

That's already 5 mage weapons if you count Enhancer (which currently isn't used much because Terra is maxed out at 50) including a healing rod. I already have one weapon on the banner but I'd like any of the other weapons and armors. The only one I don't really care for is Minotaur Plate but being able to throw Shellga SB on any heavy armor character seems like it could be pretty useful."
FFRecordKeeper,3e0qs3,FFinalFantasyForever,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:19:38 2015 UTC,"Yea, you look good. No need to pull on this banner."
FFRecordKeeper,3e0qs3,ipoppo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:25:35 2015 UTC,But I want stuff to replace the shared SB rods. Shared SB equipment usually have worse stats than all other 5* relics. The Full Metal Staff's SB isn't even very strong. It's only saving grace is holy damage which makes it easier to hit medal goals without sacrificing a slot for Dia.
FFRecordKeeper,3e0qs3,dscotton,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:09:05 2015 UTC,"Your Oak Staff does the job just fine. The Magistral Rod has some decent MAG stats already, so it can work just fine in most situations as well. Furthermore, the SB on this whip is nothing entirely new. The SB on the nunchaku is very nice, but it's not necessary to have if you do proper damage mitigation. Personally, if you REALLY want to draw on this banner, then do a 3x so you don't feel like you regret it later."
FFRecordKeeper,3e0qs3,pqvqs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:19:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Thanks for helping me put it into perspective. I guess I mainly wanted the nunchaku for the decent damage and a AoE heal (which I still don't currently have on one of my characters). Using an AoE heal on an RW always feels like such a waste compared to Lunatic High or Sentinel bubble. But I imagine it'd be pretty decent as a character's SB. Also the whip seems like it'd bring out all of Quistis' strengths (including decent damage on breakdowns). Since she's the first Black Mage we've had in a while (since Vivi), we're gonna be using her a lot so I kinda wanted to maximize utility. I know it's stupid to complain about but having two Full Metal Staves kinda feels more burdensome than not since it makes it so it's pointless to pull better mage weapons. The truth is the whip is almost as narrow in utility as the Enhancer which I never get a chance to use. Getting a second Enhancer class weapon isn't gonna help that much in the long run. I also really wanted the FFVIII sword and the light armors. I'm kinda light on VIII melee weapons and armor. But all these are nice to haves and not really gotta haves.  A 3X pull plus the 100 gem 1x should be enough. Should save for the Lightning banner. When's that coming up?"

FFRecordKeeper,3e0qs3,catnamedcharlie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:36:55 2015 UTC,Thanks for the great analysis again! I'm going to at least do a 3 pull as these are my top mage items (though I've been able to master all content thus far with relatively little fuss):   4*+ Sage Staff Fujin's Chakram Enhancer 4* Gravity Rod   More options probably wouldn't hurt but still deciding if I want to do an 11 pull versus a 3.
FFRecordKeeper,3e0qs3,pastryoverlord,0,Tue Jul 21 15:05:33 2015 UTC,"Suggesting that people blow 100 mythril on this one seems a little silly.   Selphie's rod is flexible and good to have. The utility of white mages without any other ability sets is not very high - Selphie doesn't get a lot of use compared to all of the WHM/Summoners running around. So I wouldn't invest in her relic thinking that she's going to be in the party super long term. But a 5* rod of any kind has value. I think its on par with Yuna's rod; SB is a bit more valuable, but the character its for is worse.   The whip, on the other hand, is terrible. Single hit, no added status buff or debuff, and non-elemental are all downsides (there are a few cases where non-elemental is a bonus, but that's much more rare than when you'd prefer an elemental effect). Worst of all, its only usable by 3 characters - the first two are mediocre (Rydia/Quistis), and by the time Krile comes out, you're going to have much better mage weapons on hand.   If you're being severely challenged by content then sure, roll on stuff. But if you can afford to be patient, the quality of items increases so much that middling relics like this are a real waste to chase after."
FFRecordKeeper,3e47g2,Kevrlet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:47:33 2015 UTC,.. this skill would probably useful if it's 30%.   But I guess with the SB that restore abilities they don't quite dare to make it too powerful.
FFRecordKeeper,3e47g2,pintbox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:50:19 2015 UTC,I thought that SB was Tellah specific?  Can Tellah even use Wrath?

FFRecordKeeper,3e47g2,pintbox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:39:03 2015 UTC,"Fair enough... I'm still not so sure it's completely imbalanced, though.  Obviously they need to be careful of power creep, but even if Wrath restored a full SB bar and you used it with an ether-like ability, you have two scenarios:  1) Wrath + Another ability:  There's a chance you refill the other ability with the SB instead, and eventually run out of Wrath casts.  2) 2x Wrath: You basically have 1/5 of your party dedicated to 'ether'ing.  That's a lot of wasted actions...  And it takes up two whole actions just to use this combo... I feel like there will always be better options unless you're seriously lacking hones."

Two mage weapons, plus we don't have a lot of FF8 synergy gear from dungeons, so even the non-SB items are helpful.  I would also generally caution against saving up for a very large number of pulls on a single banner hoping for one or two items, because chances are still pretty good that you aren't going to get what you want.

Run'akusu is very op but probably the only thing that make Golbez worth using imo (other than the fact that he can wear heavy armor). With it Golbez is broken (tons of armor/health/attack for a mage with good magic). Without it he's outclassed by other black mages (especially Terra).

If you're at the point where you pull selectively (i.e. only for great items) then I would not suggest pulling here at all. The only (and I really mean only) good weapon here is Selphie's rod, which is a nice AoE heal for sure, but there will be many better weapons in the future. Yuna's second weapon will be out in the next Soul Break celebration in about 1.5-2 months, and it absolutely curbstomps Selphie's wep. Not to mention that Selphie herself is a worse char than Yuna, Garnet, Eiko, Lenna, Mog et. Quistis wep is striclty meh-tier, and she herself is not a popular BLM at all in JP, so it doesn't even get redeemed by belonging to a good character.  Save your mythril for Lightning, the next Soul Break Celebration, or Clouds SSB weapon."
FFRecordKeeper,3e1n0b,Tiger519,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:49 2015 UTC,"Well it's sort of 3 mage weapons in 1, though he chakram is extremely niche as a mage weapon. Does have some utility with other throwers. The whip, yeah it's niche too but still nice. And the rod isn't as good as some that have come before but still a nice mage weapon and her SB is good for now.  And light armor is nice.      I guess it's all of them together. Until Golbez and Tellah each banner has 0 or 1 mage weapon on it and some are desperate for mage weapons.      Lightning's is hyped way more."
FFRecordKeeper,3e1n0b,Sir__Will,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:08:23 2015 UTC,"Should note also that the next soul break celebration is likely following Golbez/Tellah, which if they keep things consistent will have Yuna's new SB weapon plus bring back Selphie, Quistis, Vivi, Garnet and some decent generics (plus good non mage equips too!). Long time to wait but a really nice set of banners. But you could do worse than pulling on this one now. I might just do an 11x pull since after this I probably won't pull until Lightning."
FFRecordKeeper,3e1n0b,dscotton,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:36:27 2015 UTC,yeah but that's both are a long way away and they may change up what's in the banners again. We still don't have Gordon's weapon with the first changes. Wish the 2 weren't right next to each other.
FFRecordKeeper,3e1n0b,Tiger519,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:58:26 2015 UTC,"Yep, and right after that soul break celebration the odds of a 5* get raised to 12% with four character items per banner, so basically all the banners are going to be a lot better if we can wait that long."

I will be perfectly happy if I pull it though because she can't realize her full potential with either a rod or a throwing weapon that doesn't boost magic.   AoE wind damage is a pretty good weapon to have in the arsenal as well.
FFRecordKeeper,3e1n0b,saveme911,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:52:43 2015 UTC,Hope can use it for the same reasons and thrown users can use it too. Has 10 less atk than the hawkeye but still not bad and higher attack than magic.

FFRecordKeeper,3e342w,scytherman96,-1,Tue Jul 21 22:14:04 2015 UTC,The weapon gets 2% of the Exp and most weapons need 10000 Exp to master (Super SB Weapons 30000). Champion and RS apply.

FFRecordKeeper,3e23gl,pintbox,0,Tue Jul 21 18:37:03 2015 UTC,"If by Mitigation, you mean Carbuncle+Kirin, then yes."
FFRecordKeeper,3e23gl,Cannibal_Raven,5,Tue Jul 21 21:49:52 2015 UTC,"Hey there. Here are a few suggestions from me regarding your team lineup.   Change protectga with another ability Bring sentinel grimoire instead of healing grimoire. What you want is damage mitigation so that your characters are able to get their skills out before their hp becomes low. Only magic break Seymour. Mortibody can be ignored as with sentinel, his magic and physical deals minimal damage. Consider exchanging squall or cloud with a black mage as Seymour's resistance is much lower than his defence. Boost your bladeblitz user and equip eidolon bond on garnet for more damage in clearing trash. Robots are weak to fire. One Firaga/ Fira strike and they are gone.   Overall, your party is great as it is. With a little tweaks here and there, I'm sure you can master it! Great pulls btw. For more information on beating this stage, feel free to drop by at this thread ! Cheers!"
FFRecordKeeper,3e23gl,Palisy,3,Tue Jul 21 10:56:30 2015 UTC,"In my honest opinion, what makes i mastered this highbridge is bcs wakka. Why? Bcs i use lots of breakdown in order to reduce his magic and resistance thus giving greater damage when using magic spells"
FFRecordKeeper,3e23gl,kirasa48,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:20:21 2015 UTC,"If you have Quake and Mana Spring 2, I'd bring Vivi with both.  It makes clearing the trash on this stage MUCH faster and easier as it will one-shot almost everything, and you can pack a -ga or -ja spell in his other ability slot for Seymour, who as mentioned above can be hurt quite effectively with them."
FFRecordKeeper,3e23gl,Xeynon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:43:35 2015 UTC,"Try to get Carbuncle.  Pair it with aiming your Magic Breaks at the Mortibody, and that should negate most of Seymor's damage.  Failing that, use a Celes with Runic as your RW.  It would still negate most of Seymor's damage, but it would also let you heal yourself with Curaga.  In both cases, ignore the Mortibody, except for hitting it with Magic Break every 2nd or 3rd turn.  EDIT: In addition, if you can get Magic Break, Armor Break and Diara to R4, you'll have more of a safety net, its a long fight.  If your problem is that you're running out of abilities, try bringing an R4 or R5 Retaliate on Cloud, maybe."
FFRecordKeeper,3e23gl,Joomda,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:11:52 2015 UTC,"I kept getting really bad luck with the Break spells Seymour casts, so I had to restart the dungeon and bring Stona. Unfortunately, and unsurprisingly, he landed Break on the character that had Stona equipped...but I put the Stona spell on the most dispensible character I had at the time (Tyro), so it all worked out in the end. :P"

FFRecordKeeper,3e23gl,Mattnificent,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:03:57 2015 UTC,"This is my opinion, keep protectga for trash stages so you can mitigate the trash dps.  Your main dps on the boss should be attunement 2, mental break(down), Diara and curaga  Boss Mitigation should be Carbuncle+SG which does wonders to stop the aoe dps and redirect spells back on the boss.  Everything else is fair game, I used retaliate but as long as you can champ the trash stages the general strategy should hold you down in the boss fight."
FFRecordKeeper,3e23gl,LegendaryZen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:33:52 2015 UTC,"Carbuncle R2, Kirin R2. Problem solved."
FFRecordKeeper,3e23gl,Cannibal_Raven,-1,Tue Jul 21 21:48:34 2015 UTC,"NOTE: This was just the RW I had loaded from the top of screen just so I can take image to post here.   I cannot seem to get past any of the mobs without losing 2 stars on each one.  Im casting protectga, and using my abilities as needed, but I still take too much damage as well as the fact I cannot seem to deal enough damage and it takes two full rounds with each player.  Usually I breeze through most events, especially on FFX events. But Im having a hell of a hard time, and Ive tried nearly every strategy I can find here.   Even with natural 5* FFX relics Im only managing to hit for around 2k in melee on the mobs and Im seeing people with lesser teams do far better than I am.   Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated... thank you!"
FFRecordKeeper,3e23gl,LegendaryZen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:53:28 2015 UTC,I managed by using retaliate and protectga to use my 5* Soldier's Sabre and 2 shot mobs. Otherwise I was taking a -2 star on trash. Wakka wasnt cutting it with 500-1000 dpa compared to ~2.5k dpa worth in reta. My hone was 4/5 at the time and I used half on trash and managed to finish as I was running out of abilities.
FFRecordKeeper,3e23gl,nambo1221,0,Tue Jul 21 19:50:46 2015 UTC,"What do you mean you are using abilities as needed? I had to use one (or two!) to clear each trash mob, basically. Very annoying! I'd drop Pheonix and protectga, and turn one WM into a BM. Assuming you have BM record material 2, that is. Waterga and Firaga ought to each one shot a lot of the trash ... look up their resists. r2 bladeblitz is a close call, I brought a power break instead just bc mine had 8 uses. Maybe a well honed spell blade that a tough trash mob is weak to? Don't forget to S/L! just bc you have good equips doesn't mean RNG won't get you."
FFRecordKeeper,3e23gl,mariozawamd,-2,Tue Jul 21 11:43:35 2015 UTC,Wrong skills set. Why Phoenix? Why the double cuts? Remember that Breaks are more powerful than double cuts unless you're doing Vit0.
FFRecordKeeper,3e23gl,AltimateRain,2,Tue Jul 21 12:09:32 2015 UTC,"Not quite accurate - breaks have a 1.7 multiplier, while double cut is 0.9 (x2) for a total of 1.8.  Spreadsheet link"
FFRecordKeeper,3e23gl,Xeynon,0,Tue Jul 21 13:04:02 2015 UTC,"I usually run with 3 melee guys and they alternate between breaks to debuff and double cuts. I have mastered everything in this game to date without ever using Vit0 or retaliate. Don't be so quick to dismiss an ability.   I agree about removing Phoenix, but the rest of your statement is wrong."
FFRecordKeeper,3e23gl,OmegaMateria,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:35:00 2015 UTC,"Wuh?  Double cuts are useful for Retaliate meta.  Double cutting a boosted retaliator with a RS weapon is much more damaging than directly using a Break on an enemy.  Also not as wasteful - the main point of Breaks is debuffing, not damage dealing."
FFRecordKeeper,3e23gl,Whatah,-2,Tue Jul 21 13:48:53 2015 UTC,"Death. Death death death. Did I mention death? The two guards aren't immune. Oh. Carbuncle. Carbuncle Carbuncle Carbuncle.

FFRecordKeeper,3e15r3,xMatttard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:40:38 2015 UTC,What was your team? I have yet to attempt it since I don't have Carbuncle and I'm not sure if Runic will cut it.

FFRecordKeeper,3e15r3,Erekai,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:53:17 2015 UTC,"It's not harder, per se, Oblivion can be neutered with Breakdowns/SG.  It will lose you the medals and probably the turns taken, though. I think Anima spent a bunch of turns gathering power in my second attempt, so I cut her down in three rounds (one full retaliate) with a hasted Vivi spamming Waterja (r3).  Double Hit RM on Yuna is a winner."

In about 2 months we'll also have a Relic festival, which will include the relics again anyways. In the more distant future Yuna's 2nd relic is a way better version of Selphie's and is superior to Magistral Rod. It's a party Cura(ga?) + Regen.

FFRecordKeeper,3e1kms,Sp00nyBard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:07:15 2015 UTC,"White mages can do a good job without huge mind stats due to the multipliers on curaga. Using vanille with binding rod is a great red mage option to damage and heal, however if you do have a dedicated white mage aswell you can get some damage out of them with a high mind stat and diara. Depends on your team composition as to what's best, I like running protectga curaga and diara across two characters so the whole team has damage output.  Vanille will be fine at 50 for now, tho it always irks me using maxed characters due to the exp waste."
FFRecordKeeper,3e1kms,robm1052,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:05:30 2015 UTC,Honestly the judgement staff is good enough. At about 200 mind you get good enough healing to get like 75% of the HP of a high level character with one curaga. Any more than that is overkill really so I wouldn't stress about RS with staves.

FFRecordKeeper,3e3c7s,gtg130s,3,Tue Jul 21 17:14:45 2015 UTC,"Fyi  There will be a couple of changes they implement to the relic draw system.   They include:   straight up 5 star rate increase from 10 to 12 increased 5 star rate for every consecutive non 5 star pull 4 character relics per banner, as opposed to 2 (and 6 during souk break celebration,rather than 4)   Once those 3 changes are in place, it will be a lot easier to get good relic draws.   I know the above is somewhat off topic, but I just wanted to reaffirm that not rolling now, be it for better probabilities in the future, or for stamina refreshes during golden week event, is the best decision.   For reference, heroic version of golden week has two special mobs that can come up.   Regular cactuar drops 3 or 4 star orbs (decent rate at 4,maybe 25% or higher?)  Jumbo cactuar drops 4 star guaranteed, sometimes 5 star (same as above)   They're not that rare, either. Probably see at least one in the 3 dungeon runs, probably see 2 every so often."

FFRecordKeeper,3e3c7s,scytherman96,3,Tue Jul 21 18:17:10 2015 UTC,3 months should be way more than 300 mith.
FFRecordKeeper,3e3c7s,supersf2turbo,0,Tue Jul 21 18:31:25 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say so. If they stop giving us free daily myhril like they hav e been lately I don't think it will be so easy to get to 300.
FFRecordKeeper,3e3c7s,zerogear5,0,Tue Jul 21 19:20:52 2015 UTC,It. Never. Stops.
FFRecordKeeper,3e3c7s,smoothjk,0,Tue Jul 21 21:03:37 2015 UTC,I hope not! Also yay for downvotes.
FFRecordKeeper,3e3c7s,catnamedcharlie,0,Tue Jul 21 21:29:29 2015 UTC,just keep 10 or 20 for the event. Believe it or not orb farming for honing is needed more then lvs.
FFRecordKeeper,3e3c7s,zz_,0,Tue Jul 21 17:37:52 2015 UTC,"I heard that in GS there are rare monsters that have guaranteed 4* and 5* orbs. This is the main reason why I would be saving mithrils for this event more so than leveling characters, even though that is a huge bonus!"

FFRecordKeeper,3e3c7s,zz_,0,Tue Jul 21 17:39:24 2015 UTC,do you know when we will get the EX dailies ? And what are the approximate droprates for 4 * orbs on those ?
FFRecordKeeper,3e3c7s,dscotton,0,Tue Jul 21 17:52:42 2015 UTC,IIRC it was sometime after the 2nd soul break celebration.
FFRecordKeeper,3e3c7s,dscotton,2,Tue Jul 21 18:00:10 2015 UTC,ok thanks ! so ten-ish events from now more or less...
FFRecordKeeper,3e0rqo,Mraht,10,Tue Jul 21 01:58:33 2015 UTC,"I spent over 800+ stamina trying to get it.  Maybe more.  I got Josef from level 50 to 63.    I took him + Zealot to the 4th floor of the 1st stage (you fight 3x enemies in each round, total of 9) for 6 stamina.    I even managed to get Blue Moon Barrage when I took my ranger in.    You may get lucky.  You may not.  I had no problems getting Blue Moon Barrage and Zealot...but this one took me forever and a half."

FFRecordKeeper,3e0rqo,PancakeHenry,0,Tue Jul 21 12:48:12 2015 UTC,But at least with FF4 characters the stamina spent isn't as bad thanks to Fabul Castle.

FFRecordKeeper,3e0rqo,ramza201,3,Tue Jul 21 19:48:13 2015 UTC,"I gave Josef the Zealot RM and used Snow Cavern Return (Classic) and repeated stage 4.  It's 6 stamina each time, with 3 waves of 3 enemies.  Took me about 250 stamina to get it.  EDIT:  My party was just Josef alone."
FFRecordKeeper,3e0rqo,aferlane,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:20:15 2015 UTC,"This. Taking Josef alone with Zealot is much quicker since you don't have to wait through other auto attacks that don't take down the mob. I didn't get it going through the dungeons either, but spent <100 stamina afterwards trying to get it. Just depends on how lucky you are. I'd be happy to spend longer farming RM2s if RNGesus would be more gracious with 11x pulls!"
FFRecordKeeper,3e0rqo,Tiger519,0,Tue Jul 21 02:35:50 2015 UTC,this is what i did too.  it took me like 300 stamina.
FFRecordKeeper,3e0rqo,cowvin2,2,Tue Jul 21 18:00:57 2015 UTC,"Personally, i got it after about...roughly 100 stamina. I just went through FFII snow cavern returns dungeon classic farming for the ice bow, eventually i got it. I also equipped zealot on him to speed up the process."
FFRecordKeeper,3e0rqo,LaydinSpellbinder,0,Tue Jul 21 03:58:31 2015 UTC,"The most effective way to farm is to wait for the FFII event which is supposedly coming out in a month or two from what I read.  If you can't wait that long, I suggest doing the first dungeon in the FFII realm and repeat stage 4 as there is a higher monster density.  I was lucky enough to get the record materia after one run of the dungeon.  Good luck!"
FFRecordKeeper,3e0rqo,KazFury,0,Tue Jul 21 02:13:11 2015 UTC,"There's only ever been 1 event with II characters. It's a collab collection event but I'll assume the stages are FFII compatible, I don't know how that works. It's still like 3 months away."
FFRecordKeeper,3e0rqo,Sir__Will,0,Tue Jul 21 02:28:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I believe they had FFII synergy."
FFRecordKeeper,3e0rqo,Necrofamicom,0,Tue Jul 21 17:26:26 2015 UTC,There really isnt an effective stage. I just went through the first classic off FF2 until I got it. Took 3 tries. I also sent him in only with cloud and just auto attacked everything till dead.
FFRecordKeeper,3e0rqo,Cyrus9586,0,Tue Jul 21 02:00:10 2015 UTC,"Man, I'm at 200+ stamina with no double cut in sight yet. Josef 53 right now. Was hoping to get it today so I could spend tomorrow farming black orbs. Need to get my thundaga, thundara strike and biora all to from R3 to R4."
FFRecordKeeper,3e0rqo,rxsiu,0,Tue Jul 21 07:12:01 2015 UTC,i found the first 3 levels cost the same but the 4th floor of the third level gave me 3800 xp so i did that since it gave me a few extra xp. ultimately it doesnt matter just find one of the levels that have 3 mob although i heard its not the number of mob but the number of floors. either way 3 floors with 3 mobs per floor is the best you can get for only 6 stam
FFRecordKeeper,3e0rqo,Dach_Akrost,0,Tue Jul 21 08:05:59 2015 UTC,"I just spammed the lowest level II dungeon with Zealot RM on Josef going solo.  Seems I got very lucky since I spent, probably, less than 30 stamina."
FFRecordKeeper,3e0rqo,iGyman,0,Tue Jul 21 12:19:08 2015 UTC,Took me 400-500 total energy on lowest stage.  It's not pretty.  Hope your luck is a little better.
FFRecordKeeper,3e0rqo,saveme911,0,Tue Jul 21 13:30:43 2015 UTC,"If you get tired of spamming trash floors, do what i did and switch to zombie behemoth (coliseum). He drops GPOs and its still the same number of rounds (albeit at the price of costing more stamina) but hey you're stuck there anyways so why not get some 4* orbs in the process .^ hopefully you get yours soon and not deal with the 500+ stamina horror stories ive heard/experienced."
FFRecordKeeper,3e0rqo,drewstah3o5,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:49:59 2015 UTC,Thx everyone  I want double cut before go to Yuna Ex+. I will try for 1-2 days if I don't get it may be I will be wait for FFII event  one more question. Does Josef need to kill an enemy to get RM or whoever in the team ?
FFRecordKeeper,3e0rqo,iamfrankfrank,0,Tue Jul 21 06:11:28 2015 UTC,"No, he just has to be there."
FFRecordKeeper,3e0rqo,smittymj,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:26:30 2015 UTC,Is it required that the person you're hunting an RM for is the one to kill the monster for it to drop?
FFRecordKeeper,3e0rqo,ViiktorH,-1,Tue Jul 21 06:13:13 2015 UTC,"No, the person just needs to be in the party."

FFRecordKeeper,3e1qyx,SLAMDUNKWizard420,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:36:53 2015 UTC,"It's slightly worse than the Buster abilities (which are 5% more likely to hit iirc) but has the added boon on inflicting, oh y'know, instant death when it lands?  Also, it's possible to BREAK one Guado Guardian, and deplete the other's hit points with judicious use of the Carbuncle summons/mental break and strong physical attacks (or Retaliate, if you've a good enough sword) -- it's possible to inflict break on just one and still master. I did.  Your problem is probably on relying both to hit, which is mere probability and not favourable odds. Break at least does not need to be honed, either. So, it is probably you who doesn't know what they're talking about due to their frustration.  Good luck with the battle, though. It's quite doable; tricky to master."
FFRecordKeeper,3e1qyx,Engeleo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:06:36 2015 UTC,Oh me? Nah. I vit0 1 shot mastered it. My plan was to bring gravity to deal 9999 to the guards. But they protected themselves first turns so it was just faster/easier to vit0 them. I used both gravitates for funsies though.

FFRecordKeeper,3e0wkv,Jackleber,20,Tue Jul 21 02:38:40 2015 UTC,"Your title made me lol.  In X, Anima is a summon (or an aeon, which is what they're called in that game). There's a reason she looks so tortured, since SPOILER:  In XIII, Anima is a fal'Cie, most likely named after the Anima in X. They're basically giant robot gods with superpowers that they mostly use for selfish means. A lot of the fal'Cie are named after summons - Carbuncle, Kujata, Eden, etc.  That's the TL;DR version of it, but I can elaborate more if you like."
FFRecordKeeper,3e0wkv,sorryidontexist,2,Tue Jul 21 02:43:08 2015 UTC,Forgot that it was two different games.  Kinda like how Ifrit etc are different between games too I guess.  But a little more extreme than that.
FFRecordKeeper,3e0wkv,SLAMDUNKWizard420,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:24:35 2015 UTC,"Anima is Latin for mind/soul and has been used many times, even in squareenix products, before FFX.  The use of it in FFXIII or anywhere else is highly unlikely to have been directly influenced by FFX."
FFRecordKeeper,3e0wkv,JTSpender,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:00:44 2015 UTC,... and practically every other summon has some real-world mythological counterpart. So?  Given that a majority of the fal'Cie are named after summons as the previous poster said; it's pretty fair to assume without other evidence that this naming choice was at least slightly influenced by the fact that it was used before as a summon.
FFRecordKeeper,3e0wkv,deathfire123,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:45:29 2015 UTC,"The point of the previous post being: Anima wasn't based on the Anima from FFX, he was named that way just because of FF naming conventions. You are arguing for the same thing he is."

FFRecordKeeper,3e0rq7,kemzan,4,Tue Jul 21 01:58:27 2015 UTC,"Four 5* is never a bad pull - and yours is nice.  This is what you have:   Magistral Rod: This is for Yuna, but any mage (black or white) will like this until Yuna's ready for it. Defence Veil: Also good for mages, and it guards against petrify. Kaiser Knuckle: Pretty good on monks.  You might have Snow, Josef, and maybe Refia; they'll all like this. Genji Shield: This will be nice for your fighters.   And yeah, rainbows are 5*.  Always exciting to see those.  :)  As for the crystal, it's called Memory Crystal, and lets the character reach level 65 and equip special Record Materia that boost different abilities."

Thank you for the tips and well,I don't have a monk or the fist guys just yet but i'll work on it after trying hard to get her memory crystal! Btw,i'm giving yuna the rod AND the veil.

FFRecordKeeper,3e0rq7,AltimaElite,2,Tue Jul 21 02:50:47 2015 UTC,That's a very good pull. Congrats!

FFRecordKeeper,3e0rq7,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:01:44 2015 UTC,"What team are you using for the Yuna event? Getting her Memory Crystal if you can is arguably a better use of your time than getting more Stamina Shards for the moment, and Farming Orbs is mostly a ""between events"" means to use your time.  That said, very nice pull. Those fist weapons will do really well if you want to use Snow, or for Josef while grinding to get his RM.  Mythril should generally not be used for Stamina Refreshes early game, since it doesn't give a particularly worthwhile return until you  hit at least 95 stamina, and the Relics will get your further than some extra stamina in early-mid game.  Rule of thumb for me is, if nothing else, try to get the characters and the Memory Crystals from events to help your party options."
FFRecordKeeper,3e0rq7,Hylian-Highwind,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:37:51 2015 UTC,"I'm using tidus,cloud,wakka,cecil and cyan(I have no idea why I brought him,he's lvl 15 or so while the other guys are 25-28) and I'm waiting for stamina to do the Yuna boss fight. Do you think I can gather a team good enough by the end of the event to get her memory crystal? I'm thinking maybe after getting yuna she'll carry for a while with the new 5* gear(maybe I'll have to create and hone a summon for her but I guess I could do that before the event ends). I may use Josef or Snow since I don't really have any liking/disliking towards them and I got the nice fists then! Thanks for you time and advices :)"
FFRecordKeeper,3e0rq7,quakernautic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:42:38 2015 UTC,"Could you elaborate on what Skills they're equipped with? And which Cecil are you using?  Definitely swap Cyan out for someone. His weapon selection is basically limited to Katanas and Daggers, the former being very rare and the latter being weaker than average weapons. Your team also lacks a White Mage, which might be a good idea for the Boss fights, even if it's just the Core one, but Yuna can fill that role once you get her, and has Realm Synergy to boot.  If you have the orbs to do it, try to craft Boost for either Tidus or Wakka. The attack boost to Cloud is probably worth more than their own attacks for the turns to cast. Spellblades on Cloud are also stronger than regular attacks if you have no skills for him to use, and definitely bring Magic Break to weaken Seymour's attack.  Finally, for the Roaming Warrior, try to find a good AoE attack. Seymour has ~25k HP, and a Roaming Warrior can knock a very significant chunk off of that, plus health Mortibody steals with Mortabsorbtion. Something like Yuna's ""The Sending"", Terra's Trance Fira, or Vivi's Doublecast Venom work pretty well for this role."
FFRecordKeeper,3e0rq7,Vulcannon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:49:15 2015 UTC,"Interesting! On the skills part,I don't really have much just yet. Tidus:boost Paladin cecil:cure Cloud: fire strike and double hit Cyan:nothing(yeah,it was kinda very dumb to bring the guy lol) Wakka:nothing too,here just for synergy. Boost cloud's attack and fire everything at the boss and hope he dies before me is what i'm aiming for atm lol"
FFRecordKeeper,3e0rq7,Vulcannon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:54:29 2015 UTC,"Alright then, a few recommendations.   Move Boost to Wakka. His attacks are worth much less than Cloud will deal with the boost, while being weaker than Tidus. Can you craft Retaliate? There's a strategy based around that move that can increase Cloud's damage output at your stage of the game especially. Would also let you keep up the damage output while swapping in a dedicated White Mage for better healing. Swap out Cyan for Snow or even Josef, if only because they have better weapon options with those Claws you pulled.   I'd say your biggest issue with the info I have is that you lack skills for helpful builds."
FFRecordKeeper,3e0rq7,Omegaforce1803,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:03:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah,I really haven't farmed EVER orbs so at best I can craft are a couple 3* skills. 1-I'll move once I leave the dungeon i'm at ATM. 2-Yes I can! I'll give it to Cloud once i'm done on the dungeon aswell. What's the strat? Use everyone to hit Cloud and he'll counter at the enemies? 3-I don't have those quite yet but i'll swap once I get them. Also,for Yuna summons after I get her:I can craft ifrit,bomb,dragon,chocobo and goblin. I'm thinking dragon is the best since AoE  NE damage seems really good,right?"
FFRecordKeeper,3e0rq7,xMatttard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:10:28 2015 UTC,"About 2 yes, thats the strat, you can get a lot of orbs in the daily dungeon tomorrow, your next goal should be to get some more double attacks too (so cloud counter twice). About 3 Hold on with that, never EVER create Abilities because you can, only craft them when you are absolutely sure you need them, at your stage of the game your priorities should be retaliate, double strike, boost, some cures and black magic switch cyan for rydia and use her as a healer/black mage to help with the heals and some elemental damage (specially for medals), whats good about retaliate strategy is that you can attack cloud from the back row, this way your chars (except cloud that must be on the front) take half physical damage. Try as much as possible to get the Yuna Crystal in these few days, if you cant, dont worry it will come back eventually,"

The amount of abilities it restores to said ability is dependent on the max number of uses (aka how much Hones)  Max uses 1-4 -> Restore 1  Max uses 6-10 -> Regain 2  Max uses 12 casts -> Restore 3   (don't know about max 5 uses...)"

When the Ether drops, and you see it say ""2"" next to your character (Garnet or Yuna in this example), you can be certain that it regenerated uses for Curaga, right?"
FFRecordKeeper,3e0ead,Erekai,0,Tue Jul 21 03:41:18 2015 UTC,"Both Curaga R4 and Kirin R1 would only get 1 ability restore from an ether. But if you'd say Cruraga R6 instead, them yes, you can predict which ability got restored based on the number of restorations that appears on screen. I never really tried it, so I don't know if S/L right when you see the ether drop, then kill the enemy off again, would make the ether choose which ability to restore once again or if it is already predetermined at the start of the battle, but my guess would go for the 2nd option."
FFRecordKeeper,3e0ead,Feral_Griever,3,Tue Jul 21 11:54:39 2015 UTC,"R4 Curaga = 10 uses, not 4 uses, so he'd get 2 restores if the Ether chooses to restore Curaga and 1 for Kirin.  R6 of any ability does not exist."

FFRecordKeeper,3dzghw,Rot1nPiecesOnTwitch,7,Mon Jul 20 19:58:16 2015 UTC,If you could hone carbuncle to r2 then you should do it. Since you have magic breakdown there is no need for Sentinel and can use status reel for RW.

In addition, if you're channeling everything through Cloud, then there's no good reason for anyone else in the party to have +ATK accessories.  Those guys should all equip your best defensive items.  For this fight, specifically, you'd want accessories that grant +RES."

FFRecordKeeper,3dzghw,Benergy84,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:58:35 2015 UTC,"Carbuncle R2. Kirin R2+.   Use both on first phase and third phase and you'll save a lot of actions. Better yet if you can keep Kirin up the whole battle. I didn't even bring curaga here.  Throw the bulk of your damage/mitigation during Anima (official ball, breaks/breakdowns, everything). But I also have SG and I put it up during Anima. This made a lot of difference for me..   Good luck."
FFRecordKeeper,3dzghw,notalltogether,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:54:45 2015 UTC,"If you bring Celes RW, you can avoid almost all damage during first phase. Cast with Yuna immediately and give her 2 powerful summons to nuke the guards- you can take them out in about 3 turns. Also, I brought power break AND power breakdown to keep both guards from doing much damage (and I also used Protecga). When Anima appears you have to land magic breakdown immediately. Retaliate and use remaining summons(Celes RW will leave them recharged) while keeping magic breaks on him. Carbuncle on final round and coast to victory with retaliate.  I don't think bringing a heal is necessary, if they can kill you you haven't mitigated enough damage to get the medals."
FFRecordKeeper,3dzghw,monzidluffy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:14:14 2015 UTC,"I did it with basically the exact same ability loadout you have and mastered with 1 medal lost each for actions and damage.  I think the keys to the first are to make sure your retaliate setup is as efficient as possible (no attacks without Boost/Armor Break active if you can avoid it), and to use Kirin instead of Curaga for healing - it leaves you vulnerable to bad RNG if Anima decides to repeatedly pick on one character with Pain, but saves you a lot of actions.  As for damage mitigation, timing with SG and magic break/down are everything - I applied the first SG immediately, then the second as Seymour was about to die so it'd be active for most/all of the Anima fight, and magic broke both ASAP."
FFRecordKeeper,3dzghw,csole,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:31:30 2015 UTC,"Swap Red for Tyro.  Put carbuncle and break on tyro - use initiative RM on tyro hoping he gets first round.  Put honed Diara on Yuna. Equip rose corsage (if you have it) on Yuna to up her MND, then you can use Diara as a pretty strong attack on the bosses - I think this is better than retaliate as Cloud does not have record synergy while Yuna DOES. If you have Kirin, play with putting that on her instead of Curaga (though I would stick with Curaga).  Try and get Red as your RW."
FFRecordKeeper,3dzghw,SamuraiMunky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:22:02 2015 UTC,"ditch magic breakdown, put armor break on wakka, put pound on cloud.  1 pound from cloud > 2 retaliates from 1 double strike.  hit reta, boost, armor break all in one round, then use two actions before refreshing. reta should barely last, depending on the delay between characters actions.  continue to use sentinel's grimoire.  switch warrior's sword 4+ for fencing sabre 3++ as /u/MCMotU suggested.  I would also switch red jacket or diamond helm onto cloud depending on which adds more attack.  Cloud should be in retaliate mode most of the time, and almost all of the damage is magic anyway, so the curias doesn't really need to be on him.  on your double strike characters, drop your +atk accessories for +res accessories and make sure whatever armor they have has the highest res possible.  they shouldn't be attacking, so their atk values don't matter at all.  res will reduce damage from everything but the melee from the first two guys who should only live for 1 and 2 actions.  on the opener, red xiii casts break and one person uses grimoire, other characters should do no actions.  set up retaliate after red xiii casts the second break.  save all your pounds for anima.  when I did it, I had fewer double strike hones, and I lost 1 medal for actions and 1 for damage.  s/l if you don't get both breaks.  remember to turn speed up to 5 when they are talking to get faster ticks between the shell and protect casts.  you can also turn speed to 5 after anima dies so that all your next actions are queued up to go off right when the last phase starts."

I was struggling with taking down this battle with mastery (4 times i'd get expert: 2 medals to actions and damage).  Just beat it only losing 1 medal to actions!! This was also my first time using the retaliate strategy; and it definitely took a few attempts to get it down (oh the number of times my mages attacked anima instead of cloud)

FFRecordKeeper,3dzghw,robaisolken,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:19:03 2015 UTC,"As mentioned Carbuncle R2 helps a lot.  If you can get Celes relic RW that should make things a lot easier.  Magic Breakdown should be ditched for Power Break, you want the powerful spell to bounce back at the foes.  I read/observed that only Oblivion was AoE, if that happens you have to S/L to attempt mastery.    Edit:  Don't know what you have on Yuna, but Double Hit RM should be used."
FFRecordKeeper,3dzghw,deepdrill,3,Mon Jul 20 20:28:53 2015 UTC,"Anima's Pain is MAG based, it could easily do 2k+ dmg."
FFRecordKeeper,3dzghw,DirewolfX,2,Mon Jul 20 20:33:25 2015 UTC,You definitely need to keep Magic Breakdown to mitigate damage from Anima's Pain attack. It's MAG based and can't be reflected.
FFRecordKeeper,3dzghw,jackal110,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:55:23 2015 UTC,"Carbuncle r2 ensure mastery.  If you want save orbs and not hone anything, fine.  Put tyro instead of red, put haste and break on Tyro. Make sure equip double cut rm on Yuna. Use runic as friend summon. Use Runic to start so recharge break to not need s/l. After landing 2 break, haste double cutter while cutting hp of Seymour. You'll ensure Anima death before Obvilion. After that, one more runic on Yuna to recharge Carbuncle in case You need to use cacunbl one more time after runic run out. Max medal you can lose this way is 2 for actions taken and one for dmg taken. Good luck"

Every day, I have anywhere from 5~15 new followers.  Since Yuna's event came out, I've been getting 30~50 new followers every day.  The only explanation I have for this is when you encounter a non-followed RW (the three randoms at the bottom of your RW list when you enter a dungeon) and select them, the option to follow them at the end of the dungeon means replacing one of that person's existing followers.  This means that Runic Blade RWs will have alarming turnover for the duration of this event.

FFRecordKeeper,3dxkw5,Xeynon,2,Mon Jul 20 10:55:30 2015 UTC,Yeah. But mental break is still really usefull even if you don't use a black mage if you're doing the carbuncle strat.
FFRecordKeeper,3dxkw5,Ulltra93,3,Mon Jul 20 14:24:48 2015 UTC,"It is.  It was a choice between taking Mental Break and taking another Double Cut, and I chose to go with the latter since it's useful in all three phases.  If you have two charges of Carbuncle and can use it against Seymour both times, it might change the calculus but for me the third phase was the easiest and killing Anima as fast as possible was the primary challenge so making the reflected spells more damaging wasn't as big a priority."
FFRecordKeeper,3dxkw5,deepdrill,3,Mon Jul 20 14:36:02 2015 UTC,"I cleared it with a R1 carbuncle that I only used in the last phase.  I had:   josef rm2 on wakka (power breakdown r2 & magic breakdown r2),   haste RM on tidus (boost r5 & doublecut r5)  sword damage boost RM on cloud (retaliate r5 & armor break r4), fencing saber ++  rod master RM on vivi (break r1 & waterga r3)  10% healing boost rm on yuna (carbuncle r1 & curega r5)   RW was SG  If I were to do it again, I would indeed bring red13 with break r1 and double cut r5 instead of vivi (vivi only did 4 or so watergas on anima, as seymour was shelled for most of phase 2).  I popped Sg immediately at the start, 1 shot both adds with break, I did not take any actions until i casted the 2nd break to save actions taken, as vivi was casting the 2nd break i casted retaliate and boost and prepped wakka to magic breakdown Seymour immediately (I had to Sl a couple times to ensure SG went off first, both breaks landed and wakka hit Seymour with magic breakdown as he became target-able.    Phase 2 was just retaliate spam (Cloud rotation was retaliate, armor break, attack, repeat), i refreshed magic breakdown once after wakka attacked cloud twice.  Seymour died on the next couple hits.  Anima was power broken first by wakka then magic broken on wakka's next action (wakka's rotation in this phase was power break, magic break, attack cloud, repeat; when magic breakdown ran out i did power break, attack cloud x2, repeat).  Yuna casted my 2nd SG towards the beginning of fighting anima.  Cloud did the same rotation as before, Tidus refreshed boost at the start of anima (tidus was spamming double cut on cloud the entire time except to cast boost once at the start, once at the start of anima phase and once at the start of last phase).  I took one pain unmitigated for 1800 and she got off a couple more pains but were both mitigated.  yuna had to cast 2 heals during this phase (the only castings of heal during the entire fight).  Final phase: reflect + retaliate rotation.  I lost one medal for actions 2 medals for damage taken.  Total damage i took was one add for 250, a couple Seymour magic hits in phase 2 for 300ish, one pain for 1800 and IIRC 2 mitigated pains for like 700-900.  Last phase I took 0 damage.  Assuming good RNG you don't need to bring heals at all.  i did and it saved me a SL as anima did target wakka twice and without the heal he would have died."

So if you're going with a mix of physical and magical damage, Status Reels might have the upper hand (although the really sort duration still leaves room for an argument), while if you'll be mostly doing physical damage, Armor Breakdown definitely looks like the way to go.  Also keep in mind that one is an SB, which requires some time to build up, limiting its use a bit (unless you're going with a RW), while the other is a skill that you can hone and have several uses always on hand (although it requires a slot on someone with Support 4*). Also, I think that Status Reels and Armor Breakdown will stack, therefore bringing both might be a very viable strategy to burn down enemies fast."
FFRecordKeeper,3e0n1w,Feral_Griever,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:33:00 2015 UTC,"Just to add on....  Armor breakdown can be used for Vit0, Status Reels and be used for both Vit0 and Res0.  I'd still consider Armor breakdown the superior ability due to the points Griever made above (duration and honability)."
FFRecordKeeper,3e0n1w,Liambass,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:06:32 2015 UTC,"I thought Armor Breakdown was nerfed to 40% reduction, making Vit0 ineffective in both JP and Global. Is it still 50% reduction in Global?"
FFRecordKeeper,3e0n1w,Tiger519,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:54:23 2015 UTC,Status Reels is better because it also has -RES to the enemy.
FFRecordKeeper,3e0n1w,yeeeeel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:27:25 2015 UTC,I have now Status Reels and i still hone Armor breakdown because Status reels only have a duration of 8 secs and Armor Breakdown are 15-20 segs(i don't remember)
FFRecordKeeper,3dztlz,liquicl,2,Mon Jul 20 21:30:02 2015 UTC,I've heard rumors that at some point you will be able to trade-up orbs.  So it might be wise just to hold onto them for that reason.
FFRecordKeeper,3dztlz,Eadwyn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:43:33 2015 UTC,"Not quite a rumor. It's actually true; from what I've read on various threads here, Japan already has that ability. Therefore, since we get what Japan gets, we'll eventually get it."
FFRecordKeeper,3dztlz,SherlockBrolmes,0,Mon Jul 20 22:00:30 2015 UTC,"Awesome thanks, that alone seals it, I'll just have to grind gil daily's for awhile...  Do you have more info on this? Does it let you trade up to the next rarity (guessing it would be a ton of orbs, 20:1 or 30:1 ratio?) or does it only let you trade across (1* earth for 1* fire at say 2:1 or 3:1 ratio?) or are both an option?"
FFRecordKeeper,3dztlz,SherlockBrolmes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:12:40 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I don't (and I was wondering that myself). All I know is that you can trade up and trade down.
FFRecordKeeper,3dztlz,pintbox,0,Mon Jul 20 23:30:10 2015 UTC,1) has this happened in the JP client? 2) was this a one time event options or an added feature?  Thanks very curious about this as that would change things completely.
FFRecordKeeper,3dztlz,Feral_Griever,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:06:02 2015 UTC,"No, it's not there yet. They plan to implement ability breakdown into orbs system around August, and a 2* ability can be turned into a 3* orb, but no one knows whether this happens for sure or not."
FFRecordKeeper,3dztlz,Oscredwin,2,Mon Jul 20 22:22:41 2015 UTC,"I think the amount of money you'd be getting from selling 1* and 2* orbs and abilities is probably not that great, and certainly you could get much more money by running the Gil daily dungeons (there are 2 per week).  My philosophy is that you never really know what's going to be useful someday. New abilities and challenges keep coming, and also new characters to allow new ability combinations. So maybe for some fight you're going to be taking mostly mages and need to inflict some status like Sleep or Poison; maybe for some fight you'll be taking some physical heavy team, but still need some lowly spell to fulfill a special condition. Also, new functions like ability breakdown and orb combination are also on the horizon and might make all those orbs useful in some way.  Orbs take no space, and ability space should never be much of a problem either, so if I was you, I'd just get Gil from the dailies."
FFRecordKeeper,3dztlz,marktronic,0,Mon Jul 20 21:59:44 2015 UTC,"True, though there's REALLY only 1 gil day since the other shares ice/non elemental and given the INSANE demand for non ele orbs there's never a reason not to be running that one.   Agreed on the orb upgrading though."

Quistis' Sleipnir Tail is a long-range whip with decent attack and magic; SB: Meza/Mega Eye, AoE non-elemental damage. Good for clearing trash with.  Selphie's Morning Star is a rod? with good mind and magic; SB: Trabia's Light/Light of Trabia: AoE curaga-strength heal. This I want."
FFRecordKeeper,3dxk3k,xMatttard,0,Mon Jul 20 15:57:41 2015 UTC,"Both seem good.  I missed on Rydia's whip and Enhancer, so Sleipnir Tail has a role for me.  Likewise, the best items with Magic I have are a 4-star VI one, Light Rod, and a Diamond Mace ++ from II.  Not inspiring.  I'm especially interested in Selphie's, as Seymour's fight made me realize that there is sometimes a need for black and white magic on the same character at the same time."

I hope you do, but if you are banking on one specific thing, you are definitely done for in this game IMO. Just hope to get any 5*.

Early on, even using 3 - 4* gear is good enough for a while, and from the tips that long-time players give out, they can learn what spells/skills to create a hone (also taking on the quests associated with them).  Basically, the community is knowledgeable enough to help out new players and give them a better start than what most long-time players had (in my own case, I barely honed any spells/skills, instead just brute forcing my way through)."

(Also, people generally assume that other gamers are smart enough to make basic substitutions.)  You are right that there's a wide range of abilities and characters that people have access too. But you're also making assumptions. I have friends who have been playing through the start but off and on, so they easily could have been that level 40ish party in Garnet's event but had access to all the characters and cleared a couple of the events by cheesing stuff at the end with my help/advice.

Who besides day one players could have gotten 300 Mythril? And what about new players that do not have it? I feel inferior, RESPECT MY FEELINGS!""   My answer: Good luck.

FFRecordKeeper,3dzq7t,Sir__Will,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:36:03 2015 UTC,This is what I've seen as well.  Phoenix is the only summon that's been repeated (in JP).
FFRecordKeeper,3dzq7t,Anti-Klink,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:36:18 2015 UTC,It will probably be a while from now since Valefor was given out not that long ago. Maybe when the event repeats
FFRecordKeeper,3dzq7t,750z,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:51:01 2015 UTC,Cecil and Rinoa's are the only events that ever repeated and even they have differences. Events don't repeat.

FFRecordKeeper,3dzq7t,PlebbySpaff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:39:24 2015 UTC,I know its not what you're asking but; I suggest making Maduin. It's basically the same damage (seriously! I've used both back to back many times and have gotten the same numbers most of those times) and won't cost you any major wind orbs. Only trade off is you'll have to use more greater summon orbs on maduin.
FFRecordKeeper,3dznib,brainabrasion,6,Mon Jul 20 20:47:15 2015 UTC,"Phoenix is supposedly a reward from the Eiko/Steiner event, so I would not craft it yet.  Carbuncle is actually useful in this event, so if you need it for those stages, you can go ahead and craft it."

FFRecordKeeper,3dznib,nochilinopity,2,Mon Jul 20 21:11:09 2015 UTC,"This, Carbuncle is a best option and only if you need it, if not, its better to wait and see if theres something you really need in the future, in this game its better to save orbs and have them for the right moment instead of just get things because you can in hope that it will get some use soon."
FFRecordKeeper,3dznib,quakernautic,2,Mon Jul 20 21:39:00 2015 UTC,"Carbuncle in my opinion.  While he is very situational you simply cannot replace him when he's needed.  Phoenix is simply AOE damage with a twist.  You shouldn't ever need the raise effect so let's focus on the damage component.  Other abilities and summons can do AOE damage. Only Carbuncle can give party reflect.  But I agree:  don't craft either until you actually need to use one.  But if you can do the current event, Carbuncle is huge for clearing the final, bonus, Seymour fight."

FFRecordKeeper,3dzbdw,supyonamesjosh,2,Mon Jul 20 22:16:53 2015 UTC,"A weapon 3* ++ with RS will be superior than a native 5* with no RS, and thats the norm.

As a result, I end up using lots of synergy 3* and 4* armors. Armor is a lot more situationally dependent too; I pretty much always have a sword on Cloud, but I switch up his armor quite frequently (sometimes that extra attack from a helm/bangle is preferable over defense/resistance).

Also equip him with your best +ATK gear. Fencing Sabre is better than Nodachi because of RS (I have both). Emerald shield on a non-retalitor. Protecga is not super useful due to all the magic but it might help. I would run Curaga and Diara (staff on Yuna). These fights are more about doing damage really fast than about heavy mitigation. Maybe take Rydia with the rod so she can cast a ga spells and carbuncle for that last fight. Save most of the spells for the summons battle (remember not to use fire on ifrit). Really blast Bahamut with all you've got, if if they are your last breaks/double cuts. Other two attackers need magic break and power break (I would take rank 3 breaks, but you might get by S/L'ing with rank 2). Then then can have double cuts or one with boost. You can take SG for your RW. You should be able to do it fine, GL! If you dont want to craft carbuncle then vit0 and put dia on rydia to get the medals (it wont do much damage though), and protect on yuna.

FFRecordKeeper,3dyyf4,abcxyd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:25:01 2015 UTC,"It's really pretty easy. My party was:   Garnet - 5x - Judgement Staff (5*) - Attunement Cloud - 6x - Fencing Sabre (Synergy 3*++) - SOLDIER Strike Yuna - 4x - Sage Staff (4*) - Not even level broken Tidus - 5x - Warrior's Sword (Synergy 4*) - Barrage lol (proced twice :p) Wakka - 5x - Killer Bow (4*) - Auto-Haste RW: Celes Runic   Skills were:   R4 CuragaGarnet - Did not use at all R2 DiaraGarnet - Spammed during 3rd boss, Runic during 4th boss recharges this to full every turn R3 Armor BreakCloud - Extra damage R5 RetaliateCloud - Main DPS for first 2 bosses, good DPS for 3rd and 4th boss. Don't worry about the low damage, bosses are so easy that you can easily lose 0 medals on all the stages. In fact with the number of free medals (bring X to battle), it's pretty hard not to master this boss rush R5 CuragaYuna - Used it a few times to heal, but it's more like ""let's top this guy up"" instead of ""oh shit he's gonna die"" R1 ProtectgaYuna - I used it during 2nd the 3rd boss only (no WM2 so I didn't waste it on 1st boss, and last boss is almost pure magic), but I don't think it made much of a difference R3 Mental BreakTidus - More damage for Garnet, but kinda a luxury skill since I was in no danger of dying during 3rd and 4th boss, and I didn't even need to use the second Runic for the 4th boss R5 BoostTidus - I'd say this is quite important actually due to the DPS check at 2nd boss R3 Magic BreakWakka - Pretty useful as all 4 bosses have magic damage that hurts, the only one that I didn't need to use it on is the 3rd fight of 2nd boss, since you should burn him down before he uses his magic R4 Double CutWakka - Same as Boost on Tidus, really useful to burn down bosses since Retaliate is the main DPS here   Some other points to note:   1st boss is pretty easy, break if you have them honed. 1st fight of 2nd boss is easy too, Fira did a bit of damage, but nothing special, 2nd fight caused me to S/L as his magic attack Sonic Wings (oops it's physical) does a ton of damage and slows. Cloud got slowed and I couldn't burn down the boss of the 3rd fight in time before the countdown ended. After S/L he slowed Garnet instead, Yuna healed and everything went fine after that. 3rd fight is super easy if you can meet the DPS, can even afford to heal up a bit since the boss only does weak single target physical attacks. 3rd boss does more damage but goes down even faster than 1st boss due to Garnet doing 6k Diara. He even has lesser HP than 1st boss... 4th boss is just as simple. Once Garnet sets up Runic and Wakka Magic Break the arm, you pretty much won the fight already. 3rd and 4th boss have like half the HP of their Elite counterparts. So don't worry about refreshing Runic too early.   Edit: Apparently I was lucky because during my 2 runs I have not seen an AoE attack from first 2 fights of 2nd boss. I suppose if you got hit you should S/L."
FFRecordKeeper,3dyyf4,Ariaflux,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:30:46 2015 UTC,"Do you have decent hones for retaliate/double cut and your 3* Breaks?  Here's what I used:  Sephiroth (can use Cloud if you have a better weapon for him): Retaliate/Armor Break - Self-Sacrifice materia  Tidus: Power Break/Double Cut - Sky Pirate's Pride materia (materia not important for Tidus)  Wakka: Magic Breakdown (break is probably fine)/Venom Buster - Double hit materia (use Double Cut ability if you don't have this materia; Venom Buster wasn't worth the slot honestly)  Yuna: Curaga/Protectga - Concentration II materia (you really want this for Protectga on every stage)  Garnet: Diara/Boost - Concentration I materia (would've used Attunement I/II if I had Tyro > 50)  Sentinel's Grimoire RW  Fight 1: Apply breaks (once), retaliate, protect.  Conserve abilities here and don't reapply or use more than one double cut.  Fight 2: Apply fresh breaks to each Aeon.  When Bahamut comes out (third one), go all out.  Use any good limits you have, blow your spells (note: Diara probably weaker than having Garnet proc a retaliate), make sure you have all breaks on him, etc.  Fight 3: Same as fight 1, except Yuna can use Curaga for damage.  Make sure to hit his holy weakness at least once and save at least one Diara for the next fight to be safe.  Use a Sent Grim here, too.  Fight 4: Full breaks on Seymour, magic break on Mortibody.  Use retaliate on Seymour and have Garnet use Diara on him.  Blow any limits you have and abilities.  Don't need to use Protectga here; his attacks are all magic.  You might need to adjust the strategy slightly based on what gear you have.  I have OWA for Sephiroth, so he was my retaliator.  It's about equivalent to a 2++ or 3+ weapon with RS (i.e. Fencing Sabre from this event) and weaker than the 3++ Fencing Sabre most people have from the last event, but it gives him a really strong SB.  I also have Official Ball for Wakka, which helps a lot, but no fantastic weapons for Garnet/Yuna (4+ Sage's Staff with no RS and 4* Light Staff from elite regular dungeons).  It's possible that the Official Ball helped me beat the time limit on Fight 2 a little easier, so you might need to adjust around that.  Anyway, without a lot of high level magic hones and good mage weapons, retaliate is one of the best ways to do damage.  Also the mastery requirements pigeon hole you into using all three FFX characters and you need non-curing Holy damage on someone for the Seymour fight.  It really limits the number of viable group choices."

FFRecordKeeper,3dy2av,Zedoshi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:42:08 2015 UTC,"If she dropped a 5* orb for 60 stamina, then people would just farm the hell out of it, and people who spend money on mythril refreshes would have a huge leg up on F2P players....and we really don't need to widen that gap =)"
FFRecordKeeper,3dy2av,SephithDarknesse,0,Mon Jul 20 15:48:03 2015 UTC,Easily avoided by putting an entry timer. A lot of phone games do it for special dungeons...

FFRecordKeeper,3dvvub,balmung5000,4,Mon Jul 20 02:21:18 2015 UTC,"There's not a lot of point putting him in the back row since all the damage sources in this fight are Magic based and thus not mitigated by positioning. Tyro in the front row will increase his damage output against Anima with his Magic Breakdowns, and every bit of damage counts there since Oblivion is an automatic S/L.  Unlikely to make a huge difference either way, but there's no point in putting him in the back row at all, really."
FFRecordKeeper,3dvvub,Halloperidol,2,Mon Jul 20 07:11:26 2015 UTC,"well everyone knows right now the strategy to the fight, its either the carbucle/kirin for seymour or runic/burst him  and break vs death r2 for the guards...  pray that anima doesnt use oblivion, and thats it. the worst fight till now is the ffvi dragon with the leaf/cyclone ,i wouldnt want to fight that again...."

FFRecordKeeper,3dvvub,ElLopen,-6,Mon Jul 20 02:41:44 2015 UTC,I really don't get strategies that proudly tout not using Vit0 and endorse S/L.
FFRecordKeeper,3dvvub,ElLopen,5,Mon Jul 20 06:05:42 2015 UTC,"I think S/L saves real life time but Vit0 is kind of boring. You can Vit0 everything and just do the same strategy every time. I mean, in a real Final Fantasy, if I die, I just load back from the last save point. In this game, however, they want you to pay money to do that OR wait a long time. In the end, that's why I use S/L.  It's also makes it so that some spells have any meaning at all. There's no reason for Death or Blind or whatever to have no hit chance whatsoever, especially if using one of them is a requirement of getting the top ranking (like the battle with Magisa and whatever where you MUST silence and blind to get the ranking). I'm not going to give up playing the game for days at a time, just so I can repeatedly do the same battle to try to get a spell to land. It's boring. Why torture myself?  (yes, I used the same reasoning to do Vit0 once, when I couldn't beat a boss)"
FFRecordKeeper,3dvvub,matttk,0,Mon Jul 20 11:42:07 2015 UTC,"Death's hit % is 50.  That's actually pretty decent.    I just think if you're using a bunch of somewhat low RNG actions and resetting till it works you may as well just be using an exploit outright, since you're kinda doing that anyway.  It is possible to just have a strategy that potentially works if some or all attempts miss, ya know?"
FFRecordKeeper,3dvvub,ElLopen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:07:39 2015 UTC,"Now you may ask yourself:  Well, what's a strategy that doesn't depend on S/L?    As it turns out, you can use basically this same strategy, and just have your Death user use Runic instead of Vivi, have Vivi restrain his nuking SOMEWHAT on Seymour phase 1 (you really don't need to burst this guy as he's not a threat, but you'll find it's actually safe to use some of his casts on him anyway as you won't need his full DPS to safely kill anima in time). Presto no reliance on S/L, and you can do it with R1 Death to boot.  It's actually a better strategy in pretty much all regards."
FFRecordKeeper,3dvvub,cloud_meridian,0,Mon Jul 20 15:30:28 2015 UTC,"True but what if the win condition is to use one of those skills? You can only try over and over until it is finally successful. Also, because you are limited to 2 abilities, it means these low success skills are completely not worth even researching, let alone equipping."
FFRecordKeeper,3dvvub,ElLopen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:38:58 2015 UTC,"In those cases you add more sources of the ailment to your team to make the chance of failing to inflict the ailment decrease to near 0%, or make better sources of the ailment.  I've never once failed to get stage mastery due to an ailment failing repeatedly, because I double or triple stack sources if it's that important, or use sources that are close to 100% accurate.    If you want to abuse S/L so you can have a stronger team composition or just put less effort into proper team composition and still hit those mastery points without any struggle, cool, but you're still just exploiting the game rather than attempting to use the game's tools to your advantage.    I mean if you go extreme with S/L you don't even need to use a slot on Death here-- you can bring a Killer Bow or the Stone Blade and just hope it procs on them.  Is that a good strategy or not?  I think that strategy sucks, personally, and is no less an exploit than Vit0.  You may agree too, but then where do you draw the line?  The 5% proc of Killer Bow?  The 25% proc of Break?  The 50% proc of Death?    S/L is basically just a tool when you can't think of or don't want to put the effort into thinking of a better strategy.  Hell, I gave a better strategy for this fight that doesn't need to use S/L using this guy's exact same composition even, so the proof is in the pudding."
FFRecordKeeper,3dvvub,matttk,0,Mon Jul 20 19:05:27 2015 UTC,"Please stop fluffing up a bunch of bullshit.   Your argument is bunk, ignores reality, and has been talked down hundreds of times.   We get it - you want to go against the trend, you're the most hardc0re FFRK player ever, no one on the internet is ever wrong or capable of compromise... so now that you've put out your viewpoint its your internet kid responsibility to defend it to it's bloody death.    But how bout once you just stop, and get what people are telling you.   It's a matter of practicality vs abusing code.  And next time blind fails to land 18 times in a row, come back and tell me how to hone an ability to rank 9."
FFRecordKeeper,3dvvub,roxinova,2,Mon Jul 20 20:40:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah because S/L is ALWAYS used to compensate for situations where the RNG actually screws you over, rather than to force a 20% hit rate through on the first turn without fail.    If it was only used to stop blind from failing 10 times in a row, it wouldn't be used so damn much, because the odds of it failing that often is almost 0 unless you're using a damn Dark Bow as your source of blind (and with S/L, you sure can do that pretty easily)"
FFRecordKeeper,3dvvub,ElLopen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:50:12 2015 UTC,"For me, it was a slippery slope. I started out using it only when I absolutely had to. Sorry, but I am not bringing several copies of blind because I've seen it fail more than 10 times in a row, so those kind of situations were my entry point.  Then you justify a little more. And a little more. And then you finally realise the game is just more fun when you use S/L as a strategy because they've stacked the deck against you in favour of getting you to pay. I've contributed real money to the game but in more meaningful ways. Having these high failure rates just leaves me feeling exploited.  All the power to you if you can get by without it but, at the end of the day, the game should be fun and I'd quit without S/L. :)"
FFRecordKeeper,3dvvub,Reryo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:53:07 2015 UTC,Well the only difference between S/L and normal is about 20 stamina per attempt. I suppose you could just try it for better or worse once an hour.
FFRecordKeeper,3dvvub,IDIORT,0,Mon Jul 20 07:29:57 2015 UTC,The way I see stamina is a currency that you spend on failures to compensate for a poor strategy.  If you don't want to Suck/Lose then make a better strategy and you don't have to.  That's pretty much how it works.  Or you can use a crappy strategy that has a 10% chance of working and just bang your head against the wall repeatedly.
FFRecordKeeper,3dvvub,cloud_meridian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:32:12 2015 UTC,"vit0 is going to be countered by break resist, while s/l is there and they won't change it."
FFRecordKeeper,3dvvub,ElLopen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:33:08 2015 UTC,"It does seem a bit redundant mentioning it anyway, since Vit0 strategies only play out one way and surely don't need a separate guide at this point"
FFRecordKeeper,3dvvub,cloud_meridian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:52:59 2015 UTC,You really don't get it or are you just trying to make people copy/paste a bunch of common sense stuff from other threads?
FFRecordKeeper,3dvvub,ElLopen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:36:43 2015 UTC,S/L is exploiting a feature that's necessary to be in the game's code because some people legitimately disconnect/crash/whatever during fights.  Vit0 is exploiting a bug in the game's code.    Both exploitative.  I'm not saying use or don't use either one-- just that if you use one you should be fine with using the other.  Neither one is the game as intended.
FFRecordKeeper,3dvvub,cloud_meridian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:00:31 2015 UTC,"...you should be fine with using...   What else should people do?   There is a difference, I'm sure you can see it, but you've taken a hard-core stance on your game playing and nothing less with do."
FFRecordKeeper,3dvvub,ElLopen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:04:38 2015 UTC,"The difference?  The difference is you can't remove S/L from the game without inconveniencing legitimate players needlessly, so it will never be patched out.    If you're trying to say the difference is that S/L strategies are possible without spamming S/L.  Well sure, they all are, if you spend the stamina to do so.  As I said stamina is a currency-- you need to spend less if you actually do the right strategy, more (or exploit the game) if you don't.  If the game was designed assuming S/L these status ailment spells wouldn't even have % to hit, they'd just work every time the enemy wasn't immune."
FFRecordKeeper,3dvvub,kirasa48,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:20:17 2015 UTC,"If the game was created with S/L in mind, I agree there'd be less uses.   Not 1, but maybe 2/3/4/4/5, for multi-targets or duration.   But then stamina costs would be lower, considering they're expecting more repetition.  Trash might be done differently, so new content trash isn't insta-killing mages.   But then character scaling would be different to keep content hard.   et ce t e r a.....    Logically, you're right.    But as things stand, S/L is a QoL function and Vit0 is an exploit."
FFRecordKeeper,3dvvub,kirasa48,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:27:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah I edited it to say the game would remove hit percentages.  You're right you'd need more than 1 at times.  But yeah, there'd be no reason for ailments to be honed to like 10.  Anyway I'm just saying they're both exploits.  Exploiting a bug vs exploiting intended game functionality to make the game easier.  They're both ""cheating"" and can be used to force a team or strategy through an event that has no place getting through, and more importantly they're both boring to read about.    If your strategy REQUIRES S/L to work most of the time, it sucks, plain and simple.  A good strategy should work more than half of the time, and the saddest part is this post's strategy is quite close to a good one, but instead just goes to the S/L crutch if you don't have good luck with Death."
FFRecordKeeper,3dvvub,kirasa48,0,Mon Jul 20 21:38:04 2015 UTC,Which one is better? Death or break? I've already honed break but the worst thing is.....i had to S/L few times bcs i only gt it fr r1. Not to mention sometimes it always miss
FFRecordKeeper,3dvvub,kirasa48,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:34:40 2015 UTC,"Death has a higher chance of proccing. Some people say its 50%, others 70%. On the other hand, break is around 25%~30%."
FFRecordKeeper,3dyo9u,RykenBelmont,6,Mon Jul 20 16:39:43 2015 UTC,Nope - IIRC it only gives you a third of an SB.
FFRecordKeeper,3dyo9u,smeezus,4,Mon Jul 20 16:43:32 2015 UTC,I seem to remember reading about it being almost useful when used with High Scorer RM and a good character SB.   Can't find the thread about it though.
FFRecordKeeper,3dyo9u,SuperDaddeh,9,Mon Jul 20 16:49:15 2015 UTC,Still not as useful as honing Firaja or Waterja.
FFRecordKeeper,3dyo9u,smeezus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:53:02 2015 UTC,So maybe in a Retaliate team? Have Wrath and High Scorer on Tyro and have him attack the Retaliate user? But why use Wrath then?
FFRecordKeeper,3dyo9u,Enlir,4,Mon Jul 20 16:53:42 2015 UTC,"Retaliate works rellay bad with SB charging, because you need to land the attack in order to get SB points. Attacking the retalaitor always leads to a miss, so no points. Counterattacks also grants no SB points, even if you get 80 upon casting the ""Retaliate"" ability.  However, for general comparison, consider you need 500 points to fill 1 SB gauge segment (1500 for full bar with 3 segments). Attack gives 50 SB points (65 with High Scorer), while one cast of Wrath gives 180."
FFRecordKeeper,3dyo9u,Chelios22,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:07:11 2015 UTC,"Very awesome information, thanks!"
FFRecordKeeper,3dyo9u,Enlir,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:57:17 2015 UTC,"Great info, appreciate it!  How many SB points do spells grant?  Is it based on the damage output at all?  When I'm trying to get Vanille's Deprotega up I've been spamming Comet and such and it seems to help.."
FFRecordKeeper,3dyo9u,pintbox,2,Mon Jul 20 20:47:44 2015 UTC,"Damage doesn't matter, every skill has its fixed value. Generally it's 55 for rarity 1-2 and 60 for rarity 3-4, but Retalaite is a notable exception with 80 points. If you're really interested, you can find exact values for most Global skills here (""SB"" column).  Another important rule is that you gain 50% bonus points when hitting an elemental weakness. You also get 50 points every time you take damage (only from an enemy). When being hit, multiple hits give more points (for instance, Evrae's Photon Spray in Yuna's event will grant 8x50=400 points spread across your team, almost a full segment), but the same does not apply when attacking (Double Cut will grant its points only once)."
FFRecordKeeper,3dyo9u,Enlir,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:22:25 2015 UTC,"Does status spells give SB when they miss?  Also, high scorer gives +30% right?"
FFRecordKeeper,3dyo9u,Chelios22,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:49:09 2015 UTC,"Does status spells give SB when they miss?   If I'm not mistaken, no, they don't.   Also, high scorer gives +30% right?   Yeah, but it applies only to Attack, so it basically gives you 65 instead of 50 (13% of a segment instead of 10%)."

Also, I would wait until we get Summoner's RM2 and see if you want to include a summoner on your team to craft Maduin.

You might not use it all the time but there are no replacements for him when you need him (such as this Yuna event).  Maduin can be replaced with other abilities or other AOE sources.

FFRecordKeeper,3dy4o8,FinalFuntasty,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:21:03 2015 UTC,"Valefor or Maduin are key summons, it just comes down to preference to choose which one to focus on, AoE non-elemental damages is easily the best overall output you would want in the long term.  Kirin can always be a filler, especially when you need Carbuncle for a fight and if you don't have any healing relic.  Utility summons (as Carbuncle) are very situational, I would suggest to craft/hone only if that's really needed."
FFRecordKeeper,3dy4o8,Presti_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:21:04 2015 UTC,"I crafted Carbuncle and don't regret it.  It's very effective against almost any enemy that uses single target magic spells, which includes a lot of bosses (the only exception being enemies that absorb the elements of the spells they use like Shiva and Ifrit).  Non-elemental AoE damage is very nifty, but I use it mostly for clearing elite trash and can't recall ever finding it valuable enough in a boss fight to use an ability slot on it.  For one, most bosses are single target (and a lot of the ones that come in groups such as Ba'Gamnan have elemental weaknesses you'd want to exploit instead).  Secondly, some of the most popular RWs (Sephiroths, Tidus, Locke, Vanille) give you heavy non-elemental AoE damage (and in some cases a debuff as well), and there are no group bosses I know of that resist Quake, so there are other alternatives to Maduin, whereas Carbuncle's effect is unique."
FFRecordKeeper,3dy4o8,Xeynon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:17:52 2015 UTC,"Good point in the last paragraph - I'm a lucky carrier of Sephiroth's OWA, so I do have some heavy AoE damage in my toolbox."

FFRecordKeeper,3dwu56,Fentwizler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:45:38 2015 UTC,"i try to play with breaks normaly,when a boss counters i go with retaliate. since i have danjuro and 2 swords(buster/zante)i dont need a fourth one,since i usually run a melee-melee-support-mage-healer group, since i plat from day one i have tons of 4stars and if i need a full melee team i can still do that with rs but i would prefer to retalliate with healer/wizard than to go that route.  i dont think anyone needs more than 3 melee weapons(at least 1 dagger)to clear all content,"
FFRecordKeeper,3dwu56,tetsya,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:19:20 2015 UTC,Actual 5 star equipment I have 6 and I started during the Locke event or just before can't remember. I have done almost exclusively 11 pulls as well. 3 of those were Zantetsuken's which I combined two to make a 6* and a 5* since I have so much RS stuff for VI and I don't need as many swords as I have. So usable I have 5. Makes me sad now that I think about it.

FFRecordKeeper,3dxpvg,SirPhoenix88,2,Mon Jul 20 11:58:57 2015 UTC,"Mastered with:   Terra - Break and Firaja R3 Tidus - Armor Break R3 and Power Break R3, Self-Sacrifice RM. Wakka - Magic and Mental Breakdown R2 Vivi - Thundaja R2, Thundaga R5, Devotion RM. Yuna - Carbuncle R2, Curaga R5. RW - Tyro's Sentinel   You don't need this much honing. R2 Breaks suffice. Having R2 Breakdown and R3 Breaks helps, as you can kill off Seymour faster. Break R1 suffices if you don't mind Save/Load and defending until the Guados are killed. Death can be brought, but getting that to R2 is a bit pricey, and you'll still need to S/L. Carbuncle is only really needed when Seymour returns.  No gear worth noting here outside the FFX RS items that most should have. Terra has an Enhancer, that's about it.  You're best served trying to Save/Load until Break/Death kills off the two Guado Guards. It saves so many action steps that I wound up losing just one medal for that category.  With Seymour, if you've got Breakdown to R2, and Breaks to R3 or so, go ahead and use those to push Anima out. IT shouldn't take long regardless as long as you have FFX RS items.  When Anima is out, you need to throw out all your best abilities. Drop Sentinel, hit the Break/Breakdowns, and dump Thundaja/Firaja ASAP. This part is basically a damage check. It's Pain Beams can't be Reflected, so don't bother with Carbuncle.  Soon as Seymour's back. Carbuncle trivializes the fight. Hit that immediately, then just kill him.  Worth noting about Carbuncle, if you decide to use it against the Guados and Seymour prior to his Anima summon... Focus on weakening Anima's power first, because you can't heal off Pain if Reflect's still up. Made that mistake and almost lost Tidus twice."
FFRecordKeeper,3dxpvg,codexcdm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:46:08 2015 UTC,"I like having the honing, primarily because you get to spam more abilities and finish the harder parts more quickly. My only guideline was to try to waste all my Magic Breakdowns before the second Seymour, so I didn't accidentally prevent him from his slow suicide."
FFRecordKeeper,3dxpvg,codexcdm,2,Mon Jul 20 17:17:01 2015 UTC,Good point. Using the Magic Breakdown on Seymour when he comes back would be wasteful.
FFRecordKeeper,3dxpvg,FinalFuntasty,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:58:14 2015 UTC,Just mastered it with:  Cloud - self sacrifice. He was my retaliater so needed the bonus damage.   Tidus - double hit. Saved a slot for double cut.   Red XIII - no memory crystal but I had his relic.   Yuna - the one that increases cure healing. It was a waste since I hardly used cure.   Vivi - devotion. Helped whilst spamming Firaja against Anima.

FFRecordKeeper,3dxpvg,Xeynon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:48:06 2015 UTC,My setup:  Cloud: SOLDIER strike (didn't want him taking any extra damage since Kirin was the only healing I had so used this instead of Self-Sacrifice)  Tidus: Preemptive Strike (he had Magic Break so I wanted him going first)  Wakka: Sky Pirate's Pride (extra turns are always good)  Yuna: Double Hit (increased Retaliate damage)  Fifth character was Red XIII so he didn't have one.
FFRecordKeeper,3dxpvg,FinsterRitter,2,Mon Jul 20 13:14:49 2015 UTC,"The only thing about Cloud... Kirin undoes the Sap. You can't have regen and sap at the same time, same with poison. So the Self-Sacrifice is free assuming you're using a regen at some point."

FFRecordKeeper,3dxpvg,DirewolfX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:52:46 2015 UTC,"True, but I only had Carbuncle R1 which I used on the second fight with Seymour.  Magic Break was only to minimize damage from the Guados/Seymour 1/Anima."
FFRecordKeeper,3dxpvg,DirewolfX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:14:43 2015 UTC,"My setup was : Cloud : Self sacrifice Tidus : Soldier's strike (honestly all he did except trigger retaliate was to apply 2 or 3 mental break, so any RM would do. Maybe Blue-Moon Barrage if he didn't have Double cut as a skill) Wakka : Double-cut Vivi : Devotion Yuna : Sky pirates pride"
FFRecordKeeper,3dxpvg,klaq,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:31:22 2015 UTC,"I mastered it with:  Sephiroth - Self-sacrifice (Retaliate/Armor Break)  Tidus - Sky Pirate's Pride (Mental Break/Double Hit)  Wakka - High Scorer... maybe?  Still didn't end up filling his SB gauge (Magic Breakdown/Double Hit)  Vivi - Devotion (Break/Waterja)  Yuna - Double Hit lol (Boost/Carbuncle)  Note: High scorer is not very good if you're just feeding a retaliator, since you don't gain SB from that.  Disagree about any of the auto-attack materia being in the 'excellent' category (except the double hit one)... you should be using abilities and not auto-attacking the boss.  I doubt you'll get full marks if you can't go all-out nearly the entire time (losing 2 each in damage taken and actions taken cost me mastery the first time)."
FFRecordKeeper,3dxpvg,pintbox,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:55:55 2015 UTC,"I tried the method where you Death one bodyguard, then Power Breakdown, Mental Break, Armor Break the other, then fight it to death using only attack. I find this helps me save casts for Seymour, Anima, and Seymour 2. I only seem to lose one medal to actions with this setup and it makes High Scorer viable.   Retaliate seemed wasteful simply because I'm giving up a action ability slot to let somebody attack more."
FFRecordKeeper,3dxpvg,Gogeta43,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:48:32 2015 UTC,"What did you do to mitigate Seymour's magic during that phase?  Doesn't he keep casting while you can't target him?  That does seem like a decent strategy to get a lot out of High Scorer.  The reason for using Retaliate is it lets Vivi and Yuna do solid damage when they were out of spells (or while saving spells for the Anima burst phase).  If I had r5 Waterja, it wouldn't be as big of a deal. :)"
FFRecordKeeper,3dzcmy,Onlyfoxyladies,4,Mon Jul 20 19:29:46 2015 UTC,"The proc rate is really low on that, close to 3%. You would need to get really lucky getting that proc to hit twice in a row on the guados."
FFRecordKeeper,3dzcmy,OriginalMerit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:31:00 2015 UTC,"You can use double cut with both characters while you wait for your caster to get his/her ATB back up to cast Break/Death. That way, if you get lucky enough, you can still make that run count instead of yet another S/L"
FFRecordKeeper,3dzcmy,OriginalMerit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:34:12 2015 UTC,"I agree, that S/L is a real pain while waiting for a double Break proc.  The problem is that you want to minimize turns used on those mobs. Extra hitting on a mob when you are looking to 1H-KO just increases the number of attacks in an unhelpful way."
FFRecordKeeper,3dzcmy,btbcorno,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:39:17 2015 UTC,Exchange out Wakka and Tidus. You don't need them for mastery and other characters can fill their roles. It cuts down on the dialogue at the beginning and shortens S/L time.
FFRecordKeeper,3dzcmy,pintbox,0,Mon Jul 20 20:46:44 2015 UTC,"If you're bringing Zantetsuken and use double cut, chance is the guard will die with damage before death procs."

FFRecordKeeper,3dzcmy,krissco,3,Mon Jul 20 19:55:44 2015 UTC,"Zantezuken's Death is not worth trying to Proc.  For reference I've had one since Day 1 because I joined during FoG, and I learned the effect just 2 days ago not because it hit an enemy, but because Cloud's retaliate expired and he got hit by it."
FFRecordKeeper,3dzcmy,Hylian-Highwind,2,Mon Jul 20 19:47:55 2015 UTC,"The proc rate on allies is much greater than on enemies - it's quite easy to accidentally KO a retaliator with Zantetsuken, but very difficult to KO an enemy."
FFRecordKeeper,3dzcmy,Zedoshi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:14:58 2015 UTC,"I read that somewhere. Just noting that I never saw it proc on an enemy in almost a month of leaning on the sword. While likely to proc on allies, just noting it as evidence of an abysmal trigger rate on enemies."
FFRecordKeeper,3dzcmy,pintbox,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:17:26 2015 UTC,"It's actually different calculations on teammates, so it's a bit closer to 12% for when you hit them. Which definitely explains how I've killed my retaliator 3 times already with Killer Bow."

FFRecordKeeper,3dxfb0,sqz_bx,3,Mon Jul 20 09:35:10 2015 UTC,Maybe enough to finish EX and EX+ but not enough to master. You need Holy spells. Vit0 is not the way to go this time. Drop that Protect. Use the free Diara you got in the elite stages and hone it once or twice.  I suggest for EX equip Diara on Yuna and use Runic Blade RW to refresh her Diara uses on Seymour Natus. Runic Blade would negate the last battle so you only have to focus on the 2nd (Fake Aeons) and 3rd battles. 1st stage can be auto-attacked.  For EX+ Carbuncle + Sentinel Grimoire + Break R2 Should do it. If you'll Retaliate all the way in EX+ you wont get mastery due to actions taken and damage received since it would take a long time. Vit0 in EX+ will kill you because it will take time to set up.
FFRecordKeeper,3dxfb0,mariozawamd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:08:21 2015 UTC,I don't have Carbuncle but i have R2 magic breakdown. Not enough?
FFRecordKeeper,3dxfb0,xMatttard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:54:11 2015 UTC,Oh you didn't get the free Carbuncle during one of the events? You actually won't want to Magic breakdown Seymour cause you want his magic damage to be strong as you reflect it back to him. It could work but he spams a lot of magic spells both AoE and multi casts and you will probably lose at least 1 character if you don't have party reflect. If you will resort to using Magic breakdown I suggest combining it with Sentinel Grimoire RW to further reduce the damage from his magic cause you cant reflect it.
FFRecordKeeper,3dxfb0,mariozawamd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:57:11 2015 UTC,Nah I was too weak and didn't want to Mythril for it.
FFRecordKeeper,3dxfb0,xMatttard,3,Mon Jul 20 12:11:21 2015 UTC,"It's almost always worth doing a mythril refresh on those final bosses, especially if you think you can master it. I know I'd much rather have Carbuncle than 1/5 of a single relic draw, which has a 10% chance of giving me something useful."
FFRecordKeeper,3dxfb0,sevenhundredone,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:07:30 2015 UTC,"I didn't think I could master it at all.  In hindsight, I should have done it."
FFRecordKeeper,3dxfb0,xMatttard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:58:44 2015 UTC,"I remember during the last Survival Event, a lot of people were saying NOT to use mythril on the last Anima.  I thought they were crazy. . . Of course, that was when mythril was a lot harder to come by."
FFRecordKeeper,3dxfb0,DempseyRoll108,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:13:28 2015 UTC,"What was the reward for that Anima though? I don't recall.  I don't think you really got anything specific for it besides more points to put toward purchasing prizes, and you could get just as many points by playing it more times on hard instead of heroic."
FFRecordKeeper,3dxfb0,sevenhundredone,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:16:08 2015 UTC,"Those are collector events, the survival events worked by collecting memory prisms, and you would unlock prizes as you got passed certain thresholds of prism quantity.  In my situation, if I pushed forward with a mythril, I would have received somewhere between 5 and 7 greater orbs.  Also, I could save the time and stamina from grinding it out on hard, which was like 1/4 to 1/5 efficient stamina-wise.  So there was risk, but well worth the reward.  I did beat Anima that first time after using a mythril, and the experience, orbs, and EXP helped me beat Anima 2 more times to collect all the prizes I wanted.  If you figure at the time how hard it was to get Greater Orbs (approx. 80-90 stamina from elite bosses), and how much more stamina I would have used on hard difficulty, it was a real no-brainer.   I must've saved at least 600 stamina."
FFRecordKeeper,3dxfb0,DempseyRoll108,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:58:31 2015 UTC,"Magic Breakdown helps a lot, especially with Anima since you can't reflect its Pain attack. But Seymour spams so much magic, if you don't have reflect active, you'll be healing a lot, even after using Magic Breakdown on him."
FFRecordKeeper,3dxfb0,uh_oh_hotdog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:52:26 2015 UTC,Runic RW? or is Sentinel Grimoire compulsory.
FFRecordKeeper,3dxfb0,xMatttard,0,Mon Jul 20 15:58:21 2015 UTC,"Sentinel Grimoire is probably the better choice since Runic only provides coverage for a single character each use. However, I should mention that I did this fight 4 times, playing around with my strategies each time. I was only able to master this with Carbuncle. So take that as you will."
FFRecordKeeper,3dxfb0,uh_oh_hotdog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:09:32 2015 UTC,Time to give up on Mastering hah.  I didn't even get to master Cecil EX. I did it once and was too lazy to go back.
FFRecordKeeper,3dxfb0,xMatttard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:55:52 2015 UTC,"Runic might cover you in place of reflect.    The issue in the fight is this - during phase 1, Seymour has the 2 guards protecting him, you cant hit him till they're dead.   So you can't magic break him.   Even if you insta-kill one, you'll take 3-4 turns to kill the other, with him unloading 1200-1800 dmg spells on you the whole time.       People like 2 casts of Carbuncle because he spam casts again in the end.   But in phase 3 you can break him, and live.   I only have 1 cast, used it in the beginning, and didn't bring a heal - that's how tankable it is once you break him.  So for you, not having reflect, try Celes as a RW.    I've noticed on this forum people casually mention that her RW only covers 1 person.   These people have obviously never used it.    The RW works the same as it did in FF6- so long as it's active, every black magic spell cast gets absorbed by her.    So here's what you do to beat the ++ with Mastery, using the image posted above as a guideline.   Replace Garnet with a Black Mage (Vivi). Put Carbuncle on Yuna in place of Curaga.   -- Sorry, put Whatever there.  Or keep Curaga for safety. Equip (Vivi) with Break or Death. Equip (Vivi) with any -ja spell. (This may be a good time to boost Waterja to R2.  Water because its secondary 4* orb cost is split between 2 elements, Ice and Fire, making it kinda easier to hone).   Get that Celes RW out ASAP - you can easily make it to the Anima phase without taking any damage.   Here's an example of turn 1:   Yuna - Boost Cloud Cloud - Armor Break top guard Tidus - Power Break top guard Wakka - Celes RW Vivi - Break bottom guard.   Bottom guard dead, top guard broken, Seymour getting absorbed.  Just retaliate.   When Anima comes out, power/magic break ASAP, cast -ja spells, use dbl cuts liberally.  Tank his hits and keep breaks up.   Phase 3, cast Celes RW again with Vivi and retaliate away."
FFRecordKeeper,3dxfb0,cloud_meridian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:20:09 2015 UTC,"The thing is that I don't have Carbuncle at all, nor do I have enough orbs to create it, I'm off by a couple of orbs. I have -aja and breakdowns but I just don't have Carbuncle.  I'll probably give this a shot without it, see how it goes though. Thank you."
FFRecordKeeper,3dxfb0,xMatttard,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:36:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm sorry, I got pulled away from the computer like 5 times while writing that and started writing the wrong thing.   Ignore the ""Put Carbuncle on Yuna"".    Follow the example of turn 1, and what I wrote after.     Celes RW replaces Carbuncle.    The whole idea is that you can clear this taking such little damage you dont need to heal, ever.   Carbuncle/Celes & 1 Break/Death covers phase 1.   Breaks and mass damage are phase 2.  And coast to the finish line with breaks and a little more damage in phase 3."
FFRecordKeeper,3dxfb0,cloud_meridian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:55:33 2015 UTC,Not recommending it but im sure vit0 still works.

FFRecordKeeper,3dxfb0,brianwee2012,3,Mon Jul 20 12:52:32 2015 UTC,"Others have confirmed that VIT0 works on the EX+ stage, but I personally think it defeats the purpose of the challenge."
FFRecordKeeper,3dxfb0,uh_oh_hotdog,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:51:04 2015 UTC,For the boss rush the hardest fight is the summons because you're dealing with a very unforgiving clock.  You need a lot of damage to take down Bahamut before he hits you with Megaflare.  The rest is pretty straightforward.  Damage mitigation and holy abilities are the keys to this rush.  There are a ton of bonus stars available to help get mastery so you don't want to leave medals on the table.  Without Dia or Diara you're giving up 3 medals before walking in.  But you've got levels and some decent gear.  If you can beat the summons before Megaflare the rest isn't too bad.
FFRecordKeeper,3dxfb0,Angelwatch42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:34:53 2015 UTC,"I had a similar setup myself, except Garnet had Dia and Diara. Although I didn't get to use Dia at all, Seymour folded after using all my Diara R2.  I pretty much used Retaliate every round using Cloud, Boost him with Tidus, Armor Break on the target, Power/Magic Break to reduce some incoming damage.   Cloud was hitting from 2000 to 2700 damage depending on boost/armor break/Garnet's song. With Tidus, Wakka on Double hit RM and Garnet attacking every turn that was a steady 10,000 damage per turn, a bit more when Yuna participates and Cloud himself uses an attack.  The two Evrae fall down pretty easily to this, although the first one got annoying with extra damage.  So on the Summoner fight, Yuna had to spend several turns of Curaga to catch up. The first two are not a huge issue although the second one has a mean wind attack that can pretty much hit anyone for 4000 damage. I got lucky with dodges or it hitting a more tanky character at least, but when it hit Garnet and Yuna it was instant death.  The main issue is the timing of the change to the third summon. If possible at all you want a fresh Retaliate and Boost before the second one disappears, so you can start hitting immedlately. Even better if you have several characters lined up to attack Cloud right away. Because of the way this fight is played, ATB and queued attacks don't get reset like between rounds normally does. If the timing is off it's better to S/L probably.  Second Evrae plays like the first except for Holy weakness. I had planned on using a Mithril on the Seymour fight, so I wanted to maximize my medals here, I hit Evrae as hard as I could with Retaliate, Breaks, Dia and Curagas.  I might have been able to beat Seymour with what I had left, but it seemed my HP was a bit low, so even with Carbuncle he was chipping enough at my remaining HP with his party-wide attacks that I gave up after a few S/L and used that Mithril as I planned.  Carbuncle, Armor Break Seymour to get the Retaliate target in, Boost and Diara, it won't take more than a few turns to take him down likely. Carbuncle won't have time to run out.  I'm not sure I want to hit EX++ at all, but at least got my Ixion."

FFRecordKeeper,3dx6jg,pintbox,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:01:28 2015 UTC,"for a new player, the quests are absolutely worth it because for the most part, you're going to craft most of the abilities given to you in the quests anyway. so getting the rewards make it worth it. for older players, it was just a waste of time and orbs crafting abilities we already had"
FFRecordKeeper,3dx6jg,ukjaybrat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:06:58 2015 UTC,"2* spells are dirt cheap.  do it.  you'll get the orbs right back doing a daily dungeon. Even the 3* spells.  A little tougher, but again with Roaming Warriors, you can quickly get  the orbs back doing Heroic dungeons and fleeing.  Skip the 4* spells,  those orbs are hard to get."
FFRecordKeeper,3dx6jg,ffrkAnonymous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:57:55 2015 UTC,"sorry, missed the part about you only playing for 1 week.    As a new player I'd say to make the double anyway.  Then hone later.  Because it's cheaper to have two spells (4 casts) than to hone it even once.  Hone when the 4 casts aren't enough, or skip directly to 3* spells."
FFRecordKeeper,3dx6jg,ffrkAnonymous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:05:46 2015 UTC,"I would try to do them as early as possible. For example, one quest will say ""Create Cura"", then that will unlock ""Hone Cura"", and give you some orbs in return. If you don't double-up and create a second Cura, you'll eventually hone it without getting a free present - if that makes sense.  I actually JUST finished almost all the honing quests because of this - it's so incredibly expensive to hone Thundara Strike right now (meaning up to rank 4 or 5), versus if I'd grabbed these quests much sooner (ie, honing from rank 1 to 2), that I may not even need the orbs once I finally do finish this quest."
FFRecordKeeper,3dx6jg,Marintha,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:37:09 2015 UTC,"You should do them, and you should pay close attention so you don't have to make multiple copies of higher-level abilities from the quests that unlock from them. Doing the quests as you go along will make crafting and honing abilities a lot easier."
FFRecordKeeper,3dx6jg,Necrofamicom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:22:58 2015 UTC,"Generally, there's no need to go out of your way for any quest that doesn't award Mythril, a character, or maybe Growth Eggs.  A lot of those spells are outclassed by their Level 3 counter parts, but the Lesser Orbs are still used for some physical skills like Double Cut or Retaliate. It's your call if the rewards seem worth it."
FFRecordKeeper,3dx6jg,Hylian-Highwind,2,Mon Jul 20 07:39:03 2015 UTC,I think the quests are actually a good guideline for new players to make sure they scale into the mid-game easily since ignoring all skills in favour of the bread and butter 3* skills might make the early game difficult.
FFRecordKeeper,3dx6jg,Halloperidol,0,Mon Jul 20 07:52:55 2015 UTC,"Insert Shia Labouf Meme, Honestly it's a resource dump but once it's done you dont have to repeat it again. So as long as you are satisfied that it isn't going to get in the way of completing events you are fine."
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,zz_,2,Sun Jul 19 12:35:18 2015 UTC,"Even though I haven't mastered it (and am probably going to stop trying), I agree. Really interesting structure, enjoyable just to beat."
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,metagloria,0,Sun Jul 19 13:04:42 2015 UTC,just get Braek R2 and Carbuncle R2 and you can't possible not master it
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,ratatapa,2,Sun Jul 19 13:50:06 2015 UTC,Break R2 is a lot of Greater Earth Orbs I don't want to use just so I can get one Major NE and two Greater Fires. Not a smart tradeoff just to be able to say I mastered it.
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,metagloria,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:11:19 2015 UTC,"But Break has originally 2 uses, so you can make them both hit and u can try SL until you achieve that, dont give up /u/metagloria!"
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,eddierips,0,Sun Jul 19 16:31:18 2015 UTC,"I S/L'd a lot trying to get both to land. In 15 attempts they never did. I cut my losses and best it when I got one to hit. The hit rate is not high, others were tossed around 25% as the hit rate."
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,interbutt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:36:25 2015 UTC,Yeah. After about 30+ reloads I finally gave up breaking both guards and just accepted getting one.

FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,R_Lastre,0,Mon Jul 20 02:21:22 2015 UTC,Took me about 10 S/L's just to get break to land once :(
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,aferlane,0,Sun Jul 19 22:19:06 2015 UTC,"I used carb R2 to hard counter Seymour phase 1 and 3.  I used gravity and vit0 on phase 1, and vit0 on phase 2. Didn't really need gravity..."
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,SLAMDUNKWizard420,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:24:33 2015 UTC,"I found Break to be too unreliable. It only has a 30% chance to land, so landing it on both Guards is pretty difficult. Death has a 70% chance to land, so I used R1 Death, and with Carbuncle, Seymour pretty much did most of the damage on the remaining Guard."
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,i_4got,0,Sun Jul 19 17:55:44 2015 UTC,I've been wanting to hone Death to R2 for awhile. Might be worth it for me at this rate.
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,SSuke,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:23:03 2015 UTC,"If you can beat it without those abilities, it's not worth crafting and honing them just for the mastery rewards. 9 GEO + 30 GSO for 2 GFO and MNEO."
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,RonyTheTiger,0,Sun Jul 19 14:56:43 2015 UTC,"Break is worth crafting for this fight, but you can Savescum rather than honing it. Carbuncle isn't worth crafting/honing for this, just bring a Celes Runic RW, which has the added advantage of letting you carry two very strong, but not necessarily well honed abilities on a party member and going to town throughout the whole fight, rather than using less powerful skills with more uses. (i.e. I had Vivi carrying Firaja and Waterja and hitting for 6-8k through Seymour's Shell at the end. If I'd bothered bringing Mental Break/down, I probably could've damage capped.)"
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,CaptainPsyko,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:02:46 2015 UTC,Or you could use Carbuncle then Runic to basically get five phases where you're protected. (C - R - C - R - C)
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,Zedoshi,0,Sun Jul 19 21:35:30 2015 UTC,"The fight shouldn't last long enough for that. Anima came out before first Runic ended, and Seymour died just about as the second one did. And neither Carbuncle or Runic is useful against Anima."
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,CaptainPsyko,-1,Sun Jul 19 22:49:11 2015 UTC,"it's not just for this fight, Break was already useful  1 FFI Vampire 2 FF1 Tiamat 3 FFV Garula  All had petrified weakness"
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,ratatapa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:17:42 2015 UTC,"That's true, but they likely wouldn't have difficulty with those either. I'd advocate crafting what you need, and this mastery is pretty low on the need scale. By all means, go for it and craft R2 Carbuncle if you want. It is insanely useful when it's usable, but you could get by other strategies too."
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,RonyTheTiger,-1,Sun Jul 19 15:44:57 2015 UTC,i did hone Carb to R2... im just hoping at some point later on in this game there will be a boss rush or some other hard boss or any other reason to need him twice :(
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,ZinZilicious,2,Sun Jul 19 18:17:58 2015 UTC,My only complaint was every time you S/L you have to go through 45 seconds of dialogue + them buffing up before the fight starts lol... Otherwise phenomenally well made fight!
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,Besso91,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:24:44 2015 UTC,This is DeNa's response to the overwhelming abuse of the S/L trick... just make it completely unbearable to even want to keep repeating a battle on purpose lol
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,ukjaybrat,0,Mon Jul 20 11:59:35 2015 UTC,This is why my eventual mastery didn't involve break or death.

FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,quakernautic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:20:29 2015 UTC,Definitely a great encounter. Prompted careful planning and presented a nice progression check. Rewards were extremely stamina efficient for well progressed players but not a huge deal for those a bit behind to miss out on. Very considerate rewards imo.
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,ScrubbyD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:04:17 2015 UTC,"I agree, this was a great encounter in pretty much every way. Challenging, interesting, had cool dialogue, and best of all it only cost 20 stamina so having to retry it doesn't feel like a total kick in the nuts the way a 100 stamina boss rush does."
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,dscotton,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:08:53 2015 UTC,"I agree, this battle was such a nice change of pace from the usual battles.   Looking forward to more of these"

FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,intothepainting,0,Sun Jul 19 14:05:36 2015 UTC,It did but the first seymour battle theme is boring :P
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,ratatapa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:11:39 2015 UTC,"Nah! It's creepy and unsettling, which fits nicely with the fact that you're fighting a Maester, someone whom was previously thought to be a holy and revered figure. That's a pivotal turning point in the story so it's great to have non-traditional battle music there."
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,chroipahtz,-3,Sun Jul 19 18:20:11 2015 UTC,"for a ""kinda"" easy master i used a strat from the megatread and adapted it a bit, party was:  cloud fira strike (6) + retaliate (8) garnet protect + curaja (6) wakka armor (6) + magic break (6) vivi break (2) + firaja (4) yuna carbuncle (1) + curaga (12) vanille as my RW for Vit0 open up by breaking both guards, you may need a couple save and load to get the job done, retaliate seymour down till anima pops up, protect + RW + protect for Vit0 on anima, burn it down quickly (takes about 10 counters), pop carbuncle and see seymour kill himself. during the fight use breaks as needed, but do NOT use magic break on the final phase, since you dont want his magic dmg halved, you want him to deal 2-4k dmg on each turn to himself"
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,Liotty,-1,Sun Jul 19 13:55:34 2015 UTC,"I guess the strat you refer to is the one I put, sadly I dont see any +1 in there even if you used it >=/ lol jk"
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,eddierips,0,Sun Jul 19 16:29:53 2015 UTC,"yeah it was your strat, worked like a charm for me"
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,Liotty,0,Sun Jul 19 18:54:09 2015 UTC,"Yey, glad to be useful"
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,eddierips,0,Sun Jul 19 19:09:38 2015 UTC,Thai was the first time I actually had to go back and rethink my strategy (after winning twice with no mastery) rather than just brute-force steamrolling in quite a while.  Mastery was extremely satisfying.
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,iamfrankfrank,0,Mon Jul 20 00:00:52 2015 UTC,"The 1st and 3rd phase of the fight is manageable, the 2nd phase is wow difficult. Only 20 stam so can try multiple times at full stam to master."
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,FFatmonk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:29:35 2015 UTC,"I find that a Red XIII RW really helps in Phase 2. Since it's pretty much a race in that phase, Haste on everyone is really great."
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,i_4got,0,Sun Jul 19 17:57:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed, it was a good fight - fun, too.  I tackled it first with a Runic RW and mostly offensive setup, but lost four medals (two on actions, two on damage) when beating it. Even hasted Vivi to burn through his -ga spells which Runic would replenish, but I took too many turns with the first phase and absorbed too much damage without proper mitigation against Anima.  Tweaked my setup the second time to increase the output of damage vs. actions: used SG for RW, brought in Carbuncle (gave Yuna the Double Hit RM, too) and swapped one of Vivi's offensive spells for a Break.  Only broke one of the guardians but I was confident, with reflected spells increasing my damage inflicted (without actions) and Seymour being effectively neutered, I could beat it. Timing the breaks on Anima is quite important.  Mastered with two medals lost on the second attempt."
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,Engeleo,0,Sun Jul 19 18:38:32 2015 UTC,I beat it! But no mastery :( my abilities aren't honed enough to not rely on Reta at the 3rd phase :(
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,mwriteword,0,Sun Jul 19 20:00:48 2015 UTC,"I really liked it. It was the first fight where I avoided bringing healing, all that mattered was metals, I could only lose 3, so mitigation was the only thing that matters."
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,Oscredwin,-3,Mon Jul 20 00:35:27 2015 UTC,"That final battle was pretty intense, I agree. Had to do 2 tries. First try used break r1, comet r5, carbuncle r2, and after much s/l I finally landed both breaks. With the 5++ soldier Saber being my only RS weapon, the fight with Anima was a painful retaliate slugfest. Got to the end with my caster dead (spent all nukes though), then recarb'd for Seymour. Seymour didn't kill himself on reflects before it ran out, and I was out of retaliate and wiped out.   Second try I went with death r2 and vit0. Homing death cost precious greater ice orbs but honestly, I think it's a worthy trade off for two 5* orbs. Used vit0 on both Seymour1 and Anima. Lost 1 medal to health, took 2 pains from Anima while prepping vit0."
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,rxsiu,-12,Sun Jul 19 15:51:10 2015 UTC,"still too difficult to master if you dont have decent gear, you have to rely on break/death on save load, anima oblivion save load and still not take enough damage for only 3 medals loss, i would appreciate if in the future the ex++ are more forgiving on medals"
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,tetsya,7,Sun Jul 19 12:47:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah but the whole point of Boss Rush PLUS PLUS mode is to be hard.    If it were easier, it wouldn't be ++.    Some people can clear all content easily, and a game will get boring and die if challenges aren't offered.     People have to accept that sometimes the hardest content isn't for you.    If you are behind in gear, hones, and character levels, please don't complain that the hardest content in the game isn't easy enough."
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,cloud_meridian,-5,Sun Jul 19 13:22:02 2015 UTC,I mean. Cmon man. I totally should have been able to get to the boss rush and ace the event when I started playing with Locke 's event. I totally deserve that Phoenix for having woken up that day and finding ffrk in the app store. Dang why isn't content easier?  It's not like it's satisfying when you finally can best it via hard work.
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,horico,2,Sun Jul 19 14:01:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think it should be at least a bit difficult. The way this fight is set up you can either beat it through having good gear/abilities and doing the fight normally, or you can ""cheese"" it with break/death/gravity. Basically giving those with worse gear/hones a chance of mastering it as well. I think that's a good way of doing it, otherwise if they made it much easier it would just be a snorefest for those who have a strong team."
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,Necrofamicom,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:22:43 2015 UTC,They're not. I believe the one with the 90 second timer and 200k+ hp is coming up soon.  But the medal calculation itself has been reworked multiple times in Japan.
FFRecordKeeper,3dtwak,kirasa48,-1,Sun Jul 19 14:57:17 2015 UTC,"It really makes a difference when u know the strategy instead of going all out beating every boss. Few days ago i'd go all out trying to beat this seymour boss but then with every right honed abilities, it will be easier"
FFRecordKeeper,3dxii7,Kvin18,3,Mon Jul 20 10:20:48 2015 UTC,"I think you're going to need those medals since the condition to have him in your party is for Elite dungeons. You could probably get away without wing him for the first handful of Elites, but the last few are tough and you'll probably want to egg him at least into the mid  30s. With RS he should do ok (that's what I did with my Yuna)."

That being said, if you really want to try and fill that space, you can mess with your phone's DPI settings. There was a popular workaround to get Hearthstone running on Android Phones before the official release (it only worked on Android tablets, due to the need for a 6'' or larger screen), where they changed the DPI to trick the .apk into thinking they were on a tablet. Long story short, with a bit of math, and some work, you might be able to get your phone DPI / resolution closer to something better divisible by the game's tile rendering system, but it'll effect your entire phone, and is a bit of work.   http://android.wonderhowto.com/how-to/change-your-androids-screen-resolution-without-root-access-0160439/"

FFRecordKeeper,3dxnca,WedManticore52,4,Mon Jul 20 11:28:40 2015 UTC,"Luck has nothing to do with what banner you pull on.

There's always power creep in games like this. It's a necessity. If Cloud's 2nd weapon wasn't better than his first weapon, why would you pull for it? And if his 3rd weapon wasn't better than his 2nd, why would anyone want that one? And so on. Your mythril will only get more valuable the longer you hold onto it."

All of these weapons will return in the future anyway. They will be in either a soul break celebration, or a part of a regular event banner.   Also in 3 months, regular banners will start featuring 4 character weapons, rather than just two, effectively doubling the chance you get one."

Damage output from several regular attacks had the following results:  Self-Sacrifice = 3087, 3048, 3044; Brainwash = 3117, 3073, 3048.  Conclusion: The effects are identical for damage output."

FFRecordKeeper,3dweh3,Ariaflux,2,Mon Jul 20 03:13:26 2015 UTC,"It is better theoretically, but it pretty much means you will lose 2 actions at the very start of a fight (confused character + character attacking) when you are rushing to set up buffs/debuffs. It also introduces another factor to S/L for, e.g. your confused character go first and hit your weakest character.  I'm not saying it's not better under the right circumstances, but I can understand why some would prefer to avoid it."

FFRecordKeeper,3dweh3,horico,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:37:17 2015 UTC,Wouldn't that really just need the weakest character first to only waste one action?
FFRecordKeeper,3dweh3,zz_,2,Mon Jul 20 04:38:39 2015 UTC,Yes but it still costs you 1 action (for medals) and costs two characters an entire turn just to get to status quo.
FFRecordKeeper,3dweh3,Ariaflux,2,Mon Jul 20 05:00:00 2015 UTC,"Just because they have weak physical attacks doesn't mean their turn isn't important though. For example I would want to setup Protectga as soon as possible, so the first turn on my healer is very important. Same goes for sleep on my black mage, breaks/intimidate on my support etc.  Edit: Assuming there are no trash battles before the boss. If there are, then it's not as big of an issue."
FFRecordKeeper,3dweh3,horico,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:23:01 2015 UTC,"That's.. very logical.  I guess that's a thing, but then you're probably absorbing one not debuffed attack only.

FFRecordKeeper,3dweh3,peppygrowlithe,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:48:32 2015 UTC,"I checked out the Wiki, because I was rather curious myself! Here's what I pulled up.   According to https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/wiki/index/characters/josef : Self-Sacrifice increases damage dealt by 19%, and reduces damage taken by 8%.  (I also have read your 10% ATK & DEF in other places, so I can't say for sure which is correct. I tend to trust the Wiki over other sources, but YMMV.)  According to https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/wiki/index/characters/kain : Brainwash gives a 20% bonus to ATK and DEF stats.  Now, supposing these numbers are correct, I believe Brainwash wins out significantly in both attack and defense. Check out the mechanics page...  https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/34meur/battle_mechanics_formulas_damage_accuracy_speed/  Particularly the damage section. I plugged some numbers into a calculator. Increasing the ATK value by 20% and then calculating it with the 1.8 exponent always ended up with a significantly higher number than increasing the damage done (after calculating ATK1.8) by 19%.  So supposing that all three of these links AND my method of calculating are correct...  Brainwash appears to be the superior choice in any case where you think you can afford your mage thwacking the Brainwashed dude upside the head. Of course, it would add an extra action or two onto every zone, so in dungeons or events with lots of trash, you could end up hurting your medals. I think starting battle confused will be more of a hindrance than a person might think at first blush.  My best advice would be: Stick with Self-Sacrifice for most dungeons. Any dungeon where you could afford to sacrifice one or two actions and still get perfect medals is a dungeon where you probably don't need to go through the hassle for the extra damage. (An exception might be some of the elite FF7 dungeons, where the trash is so hard you can expect to two medal every time.) Sap is just flat out less of a pain to deal with.  For boss rushes, though? Brainwash looks like a great choice!"
FFRecordKeeper,3dweh3,peppygrowlithe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:01:10 2015 UTC,"20% ATK & DEF doesn't look right because that's a huge bonus if you're under the attack cap.  I just got Self-Sacrifice and I do see the benefit of using it over Brainwash for trash stages, since potions will recover all health lost to Sap.  But if those values for Brainwash are correct, it seems like a no brainer for Bonus Battle++ and the higher end Elite trash stages."

Poltergeists seem to be the hardest to kill, so I've got Lenna(39) with Diara right now to one-shot them.   Heroic can be done with this team. Bring a non-elemental RW to one-shot the first two rounds, then whatever high damage abilities you have for the last round. A Black Magic user with Comet would be helpful, Breaks or Double Cuts are useful as well.  I'll also mention the Retaliate strategy in case you haven't heard of it by now. Use all your growth eggs to boost Cloud's level, equip him with Retaliate and your best weapon, then have everyone else target him each round(bonus attacks from Double Cut).

If you're looking for a good guide, it's not going to cost you all that much to look through someone's screenshot or read their team set up in order to determine if their strategy is feasible for you to perform.

FFRecordKeeper,3dtegb,pintbox,4,Sun Jul 19 07:23:06 2015 UTC,"For those interested in math:   Anima has 100000hp, and you want to defeat it in 6 rounds. His effective HP is 95000 or 81000 depending on whether it's charging. Yuna cannot fight, so assuming you have 4 damage-dealers you have 24 turns to defeat it, leaving you around 3500 effective damage per turn. If you're like me and has no synergy 5* item, it means at least half of spells should be a -ja and the other be a -ga, or in the case of physical attack a 3* skill per action while Anima under armor break and all physical attackers are under boost. Technically doable, but it would require a huge number of -ja spells. If you have only 3 damage outputs then it's even more restrictive. Thus, a RW like status reel seems like a very good way to go, and retaliate is not a good idea.   The requirement for a 2-star action is 72 actions, so if you substract a few boosts and curagas here and there you have about 60 left. If you have petrified a guard then you need 3300 effective damage, although Seymour can hit himself for quite a lot. In the end you want about 2800, so not really a lot if you can keep boost and break on.   For explanation for effective HP and effective damage check out this:  https://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/3dsywn/mathcraft_guide_ehp_edmg_yuna_event_ex_boss_rush/"

FFRecordKeeper,3dtegb,antifocus,4,Mon Jul 20 00:36:48 2015 UTC,"I just did a Retaliate variant of this strategy. Results here.  Team and gear used.  Clarification on skills:   Cloud - R5 Retaliate, R3 Mental Break (RM: Self-Sacrifice) Tidus - R4 Armor Break, R5 Boost (RM: High Scorer - feel free to use Soldier's Strike here if you want to) Vivi - R5 Firaga, R1 Break (RM: Devotion) Wakka - R2 Magic Breakdown, R3 Double Cut (RM: Blitz-Eye - feel free to use whichever one you like here, Josef's RM2 would be better here perhaps) Yuna - R5 Curaga, R2 Carbuncle (RM: Light of the Fayth - you're not going to do much healing with her anyway, so it doesn't really matter which RM you give her)   Couple of notes from me:   S/L until at least 1 Break lands. If you want to reduce your S/L-ing, you can consider bring R1 Death instead - since you are only planning to land at least one anyway (2 is a bonus). Try and get a Carbuncle off before Seymour's first turn. The Guados hit hard, but not hard enough to be an issue. Mental Break is good DPS. It does decent damage (like 4.5k damage from my Cloud with Boost + Armor Break), and it makes Seymour's reflected magic hit much harder. Keep up both Armor/Mental Break on the remaining guard if you can (if it hasn't been killed by Break/R2 Death yet). Everything else is more or less the same, summon Wakka RW once for Anima, and DPS it down. Magic Breakdown must be kept up at all times, unless you want Pain randomly one shotting someone (easily 4k damage unmitigated). R2 Magic Breakdown is good enough. What I did was Magic Breakdown - Double Cut - Double Cut - repeat. Last part of the fight is the final lap. Try and have Yuna get Carbuncle off as soon as Anima dies (you can still queue actions during Anima's dying animation), and let Seymour do the rest of the work for you. If you have one more Wakka RW, use it here so he hits himself harder, otherwise keep Armor/Mental Break up as well"
FFRecordKeeper,3dtegb,DigitalBotz,2,Sun Jul 19 10:02:15 2015 UTC,"The ability I found to be essential is R2 Carbuncle, R2 Kirin and magic breakdown. Power Break could be useful because the two Guado hits pretty hard."
FFRecordKeeper,3dtegb,magic_superbeetle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:44:14 2015 UTC,This one was definitely tough to master. I brought a Yuna RW to clear out the 2 mobs at the start more quickly and that seemed to work out pretty well for me(I dont have break). Imo its much easier to aim for -1 damage than -1 on action taken when going for master.
FFRecordKeeper,3dtegb,xenapan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:45:10 2015 UTC,"This battle for me was the definition of easy to clear, difficult to master, took me 3 attempts of honing a strategy, but got there in the end with -1 medal on actions and damage taken (would of got full marks if anima had gone into his build up to oblivion :/ )  Team:   Tidus (aim) : r4 Magic Break r5 armor break Yuna (no RMII as she was level 48) : r2 Shiva r1 Carbuncle Squall (composure) : r3 drain strike r4 Fira strike Vivi (sky pirate pride) : r2 death r5 comet Kain (heart of the dragoon) : r4 mental break r4 double cut RW: RedXIII with lunatic high    Tactics were relatively simple, Death x2 on the guardo (I would of S/L til it hit, but it did first time) and the autohaste on Vivi meant I only took 1 hit - only other action was to knock Kain out of confusion with Yuna.    The first Seymour section was the hardest for me, without having Magic breakdown or SG, but magic break, mental break and Comet see him fall relatively quickly, without too much damage taken, he took a liking to hitting my Squall, but Drain strike kept me at full strike - I was able to time my first RW right so I got Hastega the move before Seymour fell.    Anima was right annoying for me, I had prepared to fell him in 5 rounds expecting the build up to oblivion, but it never came. Instead I got Pain time after time, usually on the back row which mitigated a lot and it was hitting for 500-700 which was manageable. Throw as many abilities out as needed, and I felled him in 4 rounds (taking more turns and damage than expected due to him not once gathering strength :/)    Last round is really easy, carbuncle means he's doing 2-3k to himself every turn - I only used attacks that were hitting that mark or higher to save turns used and he fell before the reflect wore off."

FFRecordKeeper,3dtc3t,Tripeiro2006,3,Sun Jul 19 06:57:01 2015 UTC,"3, I should have listed that, thank you for the reminder. I feel silly I can't remember exactly which but I'm 90% sure it was 2 Action Medals and 1 Damage Taken, just based on the fact that I only took a couple hits in Phase 1 since Carbuncle reflects most, I only took 3-4 Pain hits and always under Magic Breakdown and a couple with Sentinel Grimoire up, and then I took 1 hit on Kain who dodged Reflect in Phase 3. So the damage taken was pretty minimal."
FFRecordKeeper,3dtc3t,Tripeiro2006,2,Sun Jul 19 06:59:54 2015 UTC,"Man, this was not an easy fight at all. I didn't master it but decided to reap the completion rewards and do some exp runs on today's daily. I might come back before the event ends to try to master it, but if it doesn't happen then meh I live with it."
FFRecordKeeper,3dtc3t,metagloria,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:21:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's pretty crazy honestly. I tried again with the set up I listed and Kain died, and I was nearly crushed by the end of it. I got 'Novice' ranking. So, not easy in the slightest and takes some luck to get through in my case too. The good thing is it only takes 20 Stamina so at least not being able to master isn't an 80 Stamina loss like a boss rush, I like that aspect."
FFRecordKeeper,3dtc3t,metagloria,2,Sun Jul 19 15:26:29 2015 UTC,"Three tries and I mastered it! I don't use vit0 ever and retaliate bores me.  For me, lucky shots of BREAK were probably 100% necessary.  I use Carbuncle my first two goes at it, and think he's pretty necessary too. But I only have one shot of it and save it for the final round.  My 3rd attempt party: http://i.imgur.com/hxLNGal.jpg Like a moron I left quickness on Wakka while I had Red as my friend summon oh well. I was hoping for a Sentinel summon but it wasn't in the cards.  My 3rd attempt medals: http://i.imgur.com/NI1WUAE.jpg  I also recommend having someone cure like crazy in the Anima round before final Seymour to keep that health up, because once you cast reflect with Carbuncle you're left with whatever damage you're at."
FFRecordKeeper,3dtc3t,jackal110,2,Sun Jul 19 18:38:34 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Good job man. It's always nice when you make a few dumb mistakes [I did too] and still pull it out, and 2 medals lost is fantastic :)"
FFRecordKeeper,3dtc3t,Palisy,2,Sun Jul 19 21:12:41 2015 UTC,"Tried this. Worked like a charm. Only got one Break of though --' didn't take Curaga, just Kirin and Carbuncle. Definitely recommended! Lost 3 medals, two for actions (took me too long to kill Seymour on both times since I saved abilities during the first phase -for fear of Anima- and magic Breaked him by mistake in the second phase) and I made Vivi and Yuna attack by mistake.  It's very manageable like this :)"
FFRecordKeeper,3dtc3t,Palisy,2,Mon Jul 20 10:40:47 2015 UTC,"That's awesome! Congrats, I think I had the same medal count in the end, I wasn't stingy enough I guess, I bet it was close though. Again, congrats and glad to hear it :)"
FFRecordKeeper,3dtc3t,Palisy,2,Mon Jul 20 13:43:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks and thanks again for the strategy, would never have thought that Carbuncle would make such a difference ;)"
FFRecordKeeper,3dtc3t,Palisy,2,Mon Jul 20 15:21:36 2015 UTC,"No problem, and in the future I recommend always giving TFMurphy's enemy stats/AI threads a look over for all hard content, if the enemy is using single target spells almost exclusively Reflect will be a godsend. Best of luck :)"
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,Besso91,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:56:52 2015 UTC,"took me like a dozen resets to land both breaks on both guados, then ended up getting hit by oblivion and killing her on the very next hit  i was so mad"
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,ecs15,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:24:05 2015 UTC,Do you not have enough DPS to get through her before she casts it? That's the biggest hurdle in this boss I think
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,ScrubbyD,0,Sun Jul 19 15:06:16 2015 UTC,"Ran it with your strat today, works well. Burning Anima before Oblivion is definitely the progression check here, you really want comet R4 or -ja R3, i struggled with -ja R2 but managed after a few S/L."
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,btbcorno,2,Mon Jul 20 04:23:21 2015 UTC,Anyone else really disappointed by the Mastery rewards in Ex++? Not really worth the added trouble in my opinion outside of a completionist/ego mindset. I barely scrapped by beating it with a novice ranking.
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,i_4got,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:05:55 2015 UTC,"Meh, I did 5 runs just to get mastery. I think it was well worth it. Considering how much stamina it took to redeem a Major orb from the Aerith and Celes events, this one was a bargain!"
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,JTSpender,3,Sun Jul 19 17:42:12 2015 UTC,"I actually prefer that. If you make the hardest content give the biggest rewards, and make that content only available for a limited time, it drastically increases the rate of spread between the absolute top tier players who can clear that content and the people who are close but not quite there.  And besides, not so long ago people were grinding for days to get a major orb... ;)"
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,roy2x,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:41:44 2015 UTC,All those greater and major orbs for just 20 stamina...

FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,AgentSoup,2,Mon Jul 20 20:36:03 2015 UTC,"Only lost two medals for damage taken on ++. Sadly, that pushed me into Expert :/"
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,MensUrea,2,Sun Jul 19 06:37:17 2015 UTC,"Seems like you did damn good anyway, this battle is incredibly tough and many won't be able to complete it at all."
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,AgentSoup,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:13:08 2015 UTC,"It was pretty rough. Carbuncle and Double-Tidus RW on phase 1 made that phase trivial. The real difficulty is in the Anima phase. Making sure you keep up Magic Break/down is vital, but you also need to keep up the damage output so that oblivion doesn't trigger."
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,Kevrlet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:26:03 2015 UTC,"Just FYI, Death and Break don't hit or miss more frequently on the Guards than anything else. Abilities have a fixed hit rate that never varies against enemies. For Break this is 25% - I assume Death is the same, but haven't verified that."
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,Halloperidol,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:15:09 2015 UTC,"You sure about that? I tried it twice, once with death and once with break. Death hit 100% of the time, but I realized I needed the second ability slot for Comet when fighting Anima, so I swapped to break (which has 2 charges at level 1), and break was barely hitting ever. Death has to be higher than 25%"
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,Kevrlet,0,Sun Jul 19 03:39:01 2015 UTC,Break is 25% and Death is 50%70%. There is no such thing as partial status immunity. It's all or nothing.
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,Halloperidol,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:52:31 2015 UTC,"I am decidedly not sure if Death has a higher hit rate. It's one of the abilities I haven't data mined yet. But given that they're both 4-star one-hit-KO abilities I assumed they'd have identical stats. I, of course, may well be wrong here since I have no hard data on Death yet."
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,Road--,0,Sun Jul 19 03:59:38 2015 UTC,It's 50%70%. It doesn't really make sense for it to be the same considering you only get 1 charge per hone vs. Break's 2.
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,Chelios22,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:03:45 2015 UTC,Death is 70%. Never checked Break. edit: 25%.
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,eddierips,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:36:09 2015 UTC,"Looks like I'm simply not adequately equipped to beat the second one with Seymour and Anima, sadly.. I don't have Break or Death yet; could farm the couple orbs I need, I suppose, but I also don't have Carbuncle. If I create that one, I can't hone it, and I'm pretty sure both charges are vital.   I barely got through the guards and Seymour and had practically nothing left for Anima."
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,Chelios22,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:15:43 2015 UTC,"I used just one carbuncle for the final boss, in his first phase just magic breakdown him, but used break to kill the guards in 2 casts"
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,eddierips,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:13:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip!  I think this might actually be within my reach after all, just have to farm whatever orb I need for Break"
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,DempseyRoll108,2,Sun Jul 19 05:39:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, do that! Break is just needed at R1 at the cost of a few S/Ls to make both hit, but for me the spell almost always worked, a 25% in 2 consecutive casts doesnt sound so bad"
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,eddierips,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:00:20 2015 UTC,"I have budget statistical skills, but if Break has a 1/4 chance of hitting once, wouldn't hitting 2 Breaks be somewhere in the realm of 1/16 or 6.25%?"
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,eddierips,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:33:32 2015 UTC,"You know, I thought about that too, so maybe I was lucky to take me 3 SLs only to get both hit, I SLed all the time cause the first one wasnt hitting, and then when it did, the second did too.. but I ve read somesaying they have been 20 minutes SL'ing and nothing.. Although I doubt it was 6.25%, statistically sounds like that, but how it was so fast for me?, the other way is just bringing Death AND Break and the chances are a lot better. Or also bring firaga strike/Pound or somerthing else to kill the second one and Death on the first one, is just that 44k is still a lot if you have only one stage and u want to master it.."
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,eddierips,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:11:35 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind you cant hit him with breakdowns while the guardians are up, so if you take too long he will destroy you from the back with his spells!"
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,metagloria,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:24:27 2015 UTC,"You just need 2 turns if your Break connect, so he can basically hit you once or twice before he is alone, so when I did it he never hurted me so bad that one curaga couldnt fix"
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,Chelios22,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:22:28 2015 UTC,That's your problem. You need to bring kirin instead of curaga because each curaga you cast is one more action you spend! kirin just slowly regens you from the little physical damage you take because carbuncle completely negates all magic :)
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,TheDoktorIsIn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:32:06 2015 UTC,"I really dislike kirin and his baby heals, usually never can heal back the damage I receive. Seriously, I dont even have it created and I only met this for Lenna s SB, but I dont use her anymore either"
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,dragonyari,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:58:29 2015 UTC,"Anyone want to test relying on Zantetsuken for the guards, S/Ling persistently if it takes more than a couple of hits? I may try this tomorrow because I don't have Death or Break crafted, and wouldn't have the slots to bring them if I did. I just honed Carbuncle to R2 though, because I didn't see any way to pull this off without it."
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,dragonyari,2,Sun Jul 19 04:20:18 2015 UTC,"I have two of them and just spent 10-20 minutes purely melee'ing, definitely not worth it"

FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,bagobago,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:34:01 2015 UTC,Tried your setup but I lost 4 medals ;( I probably didn't use sentinel soon enough when anima appeared.  Argggh
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,bagobago,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:38:13 2015 UTC,"You have to get lucky casting carbuncle before seymor hits you with a ton of spells, also getting lucky to kill the guards in one shot each. then just go balls to the wall on anima"
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,N3verendin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:07:36 2015 UTC,"Also when anima appears the first two things you need to do IMMEDIATELY are sentinel, and magic break. Then pain only hits for 200-300 and it's a joke"
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,Chelios22,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:51:31 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I was able to master it on my second attempt.  I swapped out power break for boost and comet for waterja R2.  Lost two medals this time around.
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,N3verendin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:14:24 2015 UTC,"Just beat it as well using this loadout: http://imgur.com/xsQBNJV  Friend used was Wakka for Status Reels. RM were Soldier Strike on Cloud, Double Attack on Fran, Attunement 2 on Yuna (I thought Anima was weak to Holy. She's not, so Rod Master/Devotion would've been better), Light of the Fayth on Garnet, Rod Master on Vivi.  Essential are Magic Breakdown, Death, and Retaliate, rest can be shuffled around to preference. Carbuncle is neat, but the main fight is definitely Anima.  Cast Death on first guardian, Retal on Cloud, Power Breakdown on second Guardian, then wait until Vivi can cast Death again. Once second Guardian is dead use Magic Breakdown on Seymour, and plonk him to death with retaliate strikes, shouldn't take long.   Once you nearly have him down skip Fran's turn so she can use Magic Breakdown ASAP when Anima surfaces. Unmitigated it hit my Cloud for 4k+ and one shot him. With it up it only hits for about 1k, much more manageable. Use your RW and go nuts. As long as you keep the Break up you should be fine here.   I managed it with only 1 RW summon, using one on Seymour when he came back, but you're much better off using it on Anima.  Once Seymour is back, Carbuncle up and/or Maic Breakdown, and hit him with what you have left,  should not last long.  Ended up losing 3 medals, 2 for Actions Taken, one for Damage. Was much easier then I had expected."
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,pintbox,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:40:38 2015 UTC,"Hi there, first of all really nice guide there, I followed it but missing a few spells are hurting to kill Anima before Oblivion right now. I kill her almost 1-3 hits after Oblivion.    I'm using this setup and have some orbs to hone or craft some of those skills but i need to know if it's really worth it for the master.  Currently my setup is: Cloud: Retaliate R5, Armor Break R3 (Self-Sacrifice) Tidus: Double Cut R4, Power Break R3 (SOLDIER Strike) Wakka: Magic Breakdown R2, Mental Breakdown R1 (Blitz-eye since i didn't dropped Josef's RM2 yet) Vivi: Firaja R2, Death R1 (Devotion) Yuna: Curaga R5, Carbuncle R1 (Light of the Fayth)    I have enough orbs to craft/hone: - Break - Kirin (and hone it to R3) - Hone Carbuncle to R2 - Comet (can only hone it to R2 right now)    I feel like the biggest problem is a Black Magic to put on Comet's place, and my best ones right now are Firaja R2, Thundaja/Waterja R1, Firaga/Thundaga R3 and Blizzaga R4 Which one do you think would help me the most? I can probably wait for the daily and try to hone Comet, but any of the spells i currently have can do the job? Also a last question: Would Boost be better than Power Break on Tidus?    Thanks for this awesome guide!"
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,sephiroth1982,2,Sun Jul 19 04:45:58 2015 UTC,"Break would help you kill the guards faster, but comet would help you do more damage to anima, and two charges of carbuncle will help overall survivability. Since you don't have double hit I suggest putting double cut on wakka instead of tidus since tidus will do more damage with his basic attack anyway, and you're going to want to double cut on cloud for the extra retaliate swing. Not sure how much boost will help, I didn't try to bring it"
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,MensUrea,2,Sun Jul 19 15:13:58 2015 UTC,"Also, Comet is strictly better than the -ga spells against enemies with no elemental weakness, but it's not as powerful as the -ja spells, I just have a R4 comet which has more casts than a R2 -ja spell, that's why I use it. And the reason you need to use kirin over curaga is because actions taken matters a lot for this fight, so regen is better than spending 8 turns healing every time and losing medals for actions"
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,MensUrea,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:53:32 2015 UTC,"Hey managed to get it a few hours ago with some tweaks on the team. Since i've got 2 good Rods i put Rinoa instead of Tidus so she could run Death and i would have more damage spells for Vivi to rush Anima down. Didn't bothered crafting Break since it's hard to instant kill both guados with it so Death was fine, but i'll craft Comet after getting some Black Orbs on the daily.  Cloud using Retaliate managed to do a good damage over time on second Guado and Anima/Seymour, but i think if i had Tidus with some other skills the results could've been better. Lost 2 medals on actions taken and 1 on damage taken and used Wakka's Status Reels as RW so i could rush Anima even quicker while keeping it with Magic and Mental Breakdown almost the whole fight!

FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,i_4got,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:03:25 2015 UTC,"Can I ask, why comet over any of the ja's?  Don't they do more damage even if they don't hit a weakness?"
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,i_4got,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:35:15 2015 UTC,Guessing because it's easier to hone.
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,rxsiu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:13:38 2015 UTC,yea probably. tried comet and did around 4-5k and got elite. tried again for masters with firaja and did 9999 with mental breakdown
FFRecordKeeper,3dstcb,rxsiu,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:14:31 2015 UTC,"Comet is easier to hone to R4-5, which gives you more damage since you have more charges. But if you have a -ja spell that's R4 or 5 by all means bring that again"

FFRecordKeeper,3dskeq,lm009,3,Sun Jul 19 01:25:45 2015 UTC,"multiplier for RS? Is it +10%?   i think it's x1.5, somebody please correct me if i'm wrong"
FFRecordKeeper,3dskeq,Sir__Will,3,Sun Jul 19 01:26:54 2015 UTC,you get 50% more exp for record synergy characters.
FFRecordKeeper,3duj9p,Omnislash88,2,Sun Jul 19 16:44:08 2015 UTC,"I found a single Curaga worthwhile in case Anima decides to focus Pain one person or gets off a lucky shot pre-break.  Though if I had one of the AE heal soul break armors to put on Yuna in place of her AWFUL default (it did 350 damage to Seymour, with her carrying a 7* Judgement staff.), I might've skipped Curaga for that."
FFRecordKeeper,3duj9p,CaptainPsyko,2,Sun Jul 19 16:52:37 2015 UTC,IIRC Her Default SB is based off her Attack...
FFRecordKeeper,3duj9p,AvianAzure,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:33:56 2015 UTC,It is. Which is why it is so hilariously awful.
FFRecordKeeper,3duj9p,CaptainPsyko,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:34:36 2015 UTC,Just saying that's why it being a 7*staff didn't really help with its damage :p
FFRecordKeeper,3duj9p,AvianAzure,-1,Sun Jul 19 21:28:55 2015 UTC,"lol. If that unfortunate(and annoying) thing happens where he does get a shot in (3k damage), its s/l time cuz that is a medal lost right there. I used protectga right before I got anima to appear and and immediately went for the breakdowns."
FFRecordKeeper,3duj9p,CaptainPsyko,6,Sun Jul 19 16:57:42 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd rather not have to savescum any further into the fight than the two rounds it takes to try to get a double Break to land. That's enough of a PITA that I'm not terribly interested in having to do it again because the ATB timers didn't quite line up perfectly, so I try to make sure I can survive and recover from one bad hit at a time. Hence, carrying a single Curaga goes a long, long way."
FFRecordKeeper,3duj9p,CaptainPsyko,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:36:39 2015 UTC,"Point being if someone can't survive the fight without a heal, your probably taking too much damage. That was my approach at least"
FFRecordKeeper,3duj9p,Anti-Klink,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:21:21 2015 UTC,"And I'm saying that a single heal was enough to stabilize that one character and finish with every medal. When a single 2.2k pain is all the damage you take (other than some 400 damage plinks once breakdown is up and running), then it's very easy to survive with, quite literally A Heal. But without one heal, that character would've died and I would've needed to restart."
FFRecordKeeper,3duj9p,Omegaforce1803,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:47:41 2015 UTC,"Pain is magic-based.  Why would you use protectga right before Anima?  Oblivion is physical, but if you see that, then you're not getting mastery."
FFRecordKeeper,3duj9p,Anti-Klink,-1,Sun Jul 19 17:12:07 2015 UTC,"Oh, I didn't realize that. I guess magic breakdown was the key for me there. Protectga definitely helped for the guards combined with power break down, while i was running Runic RW(no damage from Seymour and refilling Yuna's summon cast; blasting down the guard quickly to save medals)."
FFRecordKeeper,3duj9p,Kyosokun,-6,Sun Jul 19 17:18:53 2015 UTC,Pain it's non-elemnt damage you can't mitigate them
FFRecordKeeper,3duj9p,DempseyRoll108,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:34:09 2015 UTC,Non-elemental damage still has a type.  Pain is non-elemental Magic and can be mitigated with Magic Break/Down. - Just like how Sephiroth's Shadow Flare is non-elemental Attack and can be mitigated by enemies that have Protect.

FFRecordKeeper,3duiqn,N3verendin,4,Sun Jul 19 22:48:47 2015 UTC,Because she's cute.

FFRecordKeeper,3dvyqc,pintbox,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:04:18 2015 UTC,You can only combine an item twice (not 3x). Combining already combined items doesn't add anything additional to the final item unfortunately... you'll just end up losing one of those items for nothing.
FFRecordKeeper,3dvyqc,phonograhy,-1,Mon Jul 20 00:16:25 2015 UTC,"yeah, i ment combining 3 times over twice. Counted one too high :("
FFRecordKeeper,3dvyqc,dscotton,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:20:24 2015 UTC,"Basically, if you will actually be using both items it's better to keep them separate.  But if you have enough other good stuff so that you're not using both, you should combine them."
FFRecordKeeper,3dvyqc,Knofbath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:26:01 2015 UTC,"2-star + 2-star = 3-star(2*+)  3-star + 2-star = 4-star(2*++)  The base item needs to be max level each time you combine it.   Stats are fixed depending on the level of the item. So while you can use 4 items to make a ++ equipment, it is a waste since the resulting item will have the same stats as one which only used 3 items."

FFRecordKeeper,3dvdgl,Niklear,2,Mon Jul 20 10:41:00 2015 UTC,"I started Record Keeper during the Golden Festival and was glad to discover they actually gave out a 5* Relic for free. After Brave Frontier, Millenium War Aigis and Lord of Valkyrie failed to keep me for one reason or another, I thought I might have finally found a game that could keep me entertained for at least a few months.  It didn't take long for me to realize how weak the Default SBs were. 100 Mythrils, 200 Mythrils, even after 300 Myhtrils spent on 11-pulls, I failed to not only pull a SB relic, I couldn't even pull a single 5* relic. When the events expired and I realized how much I was missing not completing them, I found a way to cheat that allowed me to complete them even with my pathetic gear.  After a week, I found myself waking up at 3pm in the afternoon because I couldn't sleep at night since every time I felt like a long time has passed with me lying in bed, I would boot up my phone and use up the stamina I had in Record Keeper. Eventually, it became a chore, far faster than the other Collection Type games I played since I couldn't even see any of my favorite character's signature moves.  I've stopped playing Record Keeper for about 5 days now and am slowly getting my daily schedule back on track.   tl;dr - Shit luck with pulls, got around that by flatout cheating. Ruined my sleeping schedule, game became a chore very quickly even with the cheats I used to speed up battles. Went cold turkey for 5 days, couldn't get back into the game."
FFRecordKeeper,3dvdgl,NiwaStanley,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:10:22 2015 UTC,How does one cheat the game?
FFRecordKeeper,3dvdgl,horico,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:44:24 2015 UTC,"Well, I checked if anyone reported the method I'm using and it's been reported since April on the official FFRK forum so I guess there's no harm in telling you. I setup a proxy server with mitmproxy on my computer and have my phone connect to the proxy. Then, when the proxy gets battle data from the the ffrk server, the proxy edits my stats.  There's a guide going around on how to do that for atk, spd, mag and def. I played around with it a bit more and managed to do things like decrease cast times, give all attacks status ailments with 100% chance of procing and so on. If I wasn't experimenting with that, I probably would have quit far sooner."
FFRecordKeeper,3dvdgl,roseap,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:24:28 2015 UTC,"Probably vit0. But the issue is the notion that this is a""collect all""game"

FFRecordKeeper,3dweqf,pintbox,0,Mon Jul 20 03:06:59 2015 UTC,I didn't say it was because I think those abilities are cheap like vit0 or anything...I just don't personally really enjoy any tactic where I have to land a specific debuff and have to S/L until it sticks.

FFRecordKeeper,3dweqf,zz_,6,Mon Jul 20 04:59:15 2015 UTC,"I did it without them, not because I dislike the spells but rather because I'm too cheap to spend the 4* orbs on them."

FFRecordKeeper,3dweqf,albedo655,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:30:26 2015 UTC,"Yep. I tried using break, it involved too much S/L so I fled, replaced it with quake and just used Carbunkle, Quake, and Sending RW for phase 1, burst damage on phase 2 (with magic breakdown) and carbuncle on phase 3. If my mitigation was good enough, I didn't need healing, and since the whole thing is a damage race AoE on the first two guys breaks the damage cap."
