It's like a Rukus hooked up with a CTX700. I can see it being solid lightduty riding here in the states, but it's going to have to clock in really goddamn cheap. A new Rukus is what, $2.5k? And $4k can land you a brand new CB500F? It's going to have to eek right in there in that $3-4k zone to even have a kicking chance here.  Honestly, I'd strongly consider one for an around-town bike. Yeah, I'd repaint it in a hurry, but once that's done, this could come out with a real mean post-apocalypse look."

Not for balance, as it looks wide enough in the back, and the tracks are long enough front to back.  Looks like there would not be enough weight on the front to effectively turn it with both tracks going forward at once.  If tracks can be operated interdependently, then you could turn it that way... Must be a reason, but seems counter intuitive to the way normal motorcycles operate."

MotorcyclePorn,3a1m67,sebwiers,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:00:03 2015 UTC,"Interesting how?  It doesn't seem especially innovative or unique.  Ask any custom builder for a decent handling power cruiser, throw damn near $100K at em, I think you'd end up with something similar (but unique).  Offers better performance and less weight than a Vrod, but uses essentially the same thinking with more expensive parts.  In fact, some of the build seems downright backwards.  CNC machining the tank from block?  Why?  Seems like the lazy, throw money at it solution to a problem they didn't need to have.  The 'interesting' option would be to cnc a mold and do a carbon fiber tank, or to find a craftsman who can hand form one from aluminum sheet."

MotorcyclePorn,38jqma,blackarmoredfox,7,Thu Jun 4 18:03:14 2015 UTC,What are the advantages/disadvantages of a front swingarm rather than forks?
MotorcyclePorn,38jqma,_GLL,4,Thu Jun 4 19:02:17 2015 UTC,Better handling and more
MotorcyclePorn,38jqma,IAlternateMyCapitals,3,Thu Jun 4 21:10:19 2015 UTC,It's better theoretically in almost every way; however it never caught on because:  Very little feedback about what the front wheel is doing because of the steering linkage.  It’s expensive.  It’s a new technology whereas telescopic forks have had a very long time to be developed and fine-tuned.
MotorcyclePorn,38jqma,she_did_what,3,Thu Jun 4 22:27:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with all points but will broaden the last point - when he says 'new' it's more 'newer' there have been experiments since the 70's with varying success.  Even the Britten bikes experimented with it iirc http://imgur.com/4f0K19w  It didn't work too well for Britten in practice, though the theory had to have been sound for such a genius to use it."
MotorcyclePorn,38jqma,sebwiers,3,Fri Jun 5 01:46:41 2015 UTC,"The Britten V1000 used a Hossack front, which isn't what most people think of when you say ""front swingarm"".  IE, its not hub steered.  But yeah, it offers many of the same advantages."

MotorcyclePorn,38jqma,theRealCrazy,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:04:07 2015 UTC,I'd say weight distribution under hard braking. Wouldn't dive in as much I guess. I'd love to try one on a track..
MotorcyclePorn,38jqma,sebwiers,1 point,Thu Jun 4 19:56:45 2015 UTC,"Weight distribution is about the same, but you can tune in variable amounts of anti-dive, so that it either doesn't pitch forward, or pitches less.  Also, since there's not telescopic legs flexing and binding under brake loads, the suspension moves more freely when braking.  There's people trying to race bikes with various alternative front ends, but they all run up against the issue that motorcycle racing tires are designed for bikes with telescopic forks.  As such, they actually NEED the added stress of binding forks and dive, to heat up to ideal operational temps.  So all the guys with alternative front ends in races are stuck with tires that don't stick like they should.  The tire compounds needed to make proper tires for such front ends to be on an equal footing would cost a small fortune to develop."
MotorcyclePorn,38jqma,PatrickEwingsFlatTop,4,Fri Jun 5 17:22:19 2015 UTC,"My brain keeps thinking it's backwards. I think it's the front fender throwing me off.  Or rather not, must be the suspension being another swing arm like the rear. I didn't notice that first time."

Following Gerard's death in the North Tower on 9/11, The broken down motorcycle remained at the firehouse until a memorial tribute in Backroads magazine inspired Baptiste colleagues to restore the bike in his memory.

I've long disliked the modern style of angular headlights on sports bikes, an exception being the panigale style. This alternative configuration with projectors and LED strips looks fantastic in my opinion.  Yamaha are to be applauded for having really turned their aesthetic game up a notch.

MotorcyclePorn,31hcm6,KillerJazzWhale,1 point,Thu Apr 9 20:37:28 2015 UTC,The bike only has about 700kms on it and I haven't paid too much attention to that. I think I have filled the tank 3 times so I would be getting roughly 233 kilometres per tank.

MotorcyclePorn,30kotc,captainluca,2,Sat Mar 28 12:37:08 2015 UTC,Everything is really fucking uncomfortable. From the grips to the seat to the riding position. Suspension feels like hell. Turning is worse. Lots are automatic with shitty transmissions. Torque isn't bad though

MotorcyclePorn,2zmrgs,iowarelocation,1 point,Fri Mar 20 02:16:42 2015 UTC,Very interesting rear suspension. Looks like a kind of modified sprung hub. Or it could be described as a very very short swingarm.
MotorcyclePorn,2zmrgs,kowalski71,1 point,Fri Mar 20 03:49:35 2015 UTC,Or a set of rockers (as seen at the bottom of a springer fork) for the rear wheel.

MotorcyclePorn,2z8l31,ZombieOmNom,2,Mon Mar 16 15:08:35 2015 UTC,I'm not a fan of the spring seat on a bike with twinshock suspension on the swingarm. The the shocks should have sufficient travel and shock absorption to negate the use of a springer seat. Seems like oldschool for the sake of oldschool otherwise.

MotorcyclePorn,2yiu4j,fergusonwallace,3,Tue Mar 10 22:19:27 2015 UTC,I own a 2013 rc8r. awesome street bike. never seen another on the road.
MotorcyclePorn,2yiu4j,tombodadin,2,Wed Mar 11 01:10:30 2015 UTC,Cool man. Post a pic? Would you recommend it for someone who does 90% street riding?  I live in Georgia and the mountains are plenty of fun but I would like it to be comfy enough to use in city traffic. I'm in the market for a new bike and want something different.
MotorcyclePorn,2yiu4j,fergusonwallace,2,Thu Mar 12 15:58:01 2015 UTC,"I would certainly recco the bike for street riding. I can't think of a better streetbike but I have been riding superbikes for 20 years. Here's the thing. It's a v-twin with gobs of torque. Stop & go traffic is going to suck on it. It doesn't like to be out of 1st gear until about 35-40mph as the revs get too low for heavy traffic. 2nd gear takes you past 100mph so its pretty tall. Lots of clutch feathering. Be sure to keep your chain adjust in tolerance. I live in LA where we can lane split. That makes riding in heavy traffic somewhat manageable as you can creep in 1st gear. Your Right leg will roast a little but it is doable even on summer days here.  As superbikes go, it will trump anything in terms of comfort. The seat while flat and minimally padded, is fine if you are wearing leathers or you move around a lot (sport riding). I bought the bike in oregon and drove it down to LA. Long days were slightly uncomfortable but dooable with tylenol and I am 35yo. The bars adjust high low. The whole rear subframe can be adjusted, and the pegs can be adjusted. Bone stock. Pretty cool. I keep the rear end high. The bars high, and the pegs medium and I am 6 feet tall and weigh 220.  There were 3 bikes i was seriously considering last year: The Panigale, the rsv4, and the ktm. I ride 90% on the street. The KTM was the right choice. I don't need wheelie control, traction control, or ABS; my right hand wrist knows what that feels like.  http://i.imgur.com/o9znntp.jpg"

It would make a perfect first bike. It's a newer bike built to old plans and style. Aside from the sentimental value and the thought of damaging it, there should be nothing stopping you using it as a daily/weekend rider and a learning bike. They're a low horsepower, simple, solid, semi reliable motorbike.   Fix it, get competent riding and legally, then ride the hell out of it. I guarantee if you like riding bikes, it will only take about a year for you to say 'yeah, great bike, but it's a bit slow and docile, I'll ride it weekends and buy a newer, bigger, faster more powerful bike as a daily rider'.   I don't ride often, but I owned a DT175 2 stroke for a short period. After 2 rides I wanted something with more power. Bought a Honda XR400 and enjoyed it, but it was a treat to ride the little DT when I see it. That's how you'll view the Enfield."

MotorcyclePorn,2mt234,KittyCanScratch,4,Wed Nov 19 22:43:44 2014 UTC,"That sharp of a 90 is a straight no no. Even curved 90 degree bends aren't recommended because it's causing bad exhaust efficiency. If you notice the headers, they are a large arc for best efficiency.  check this CFD diagram.  When the exhaust valve opens, a high pressure pulse travels down the exhaust until it hits air. Then it bounces back as a low pressure pulse towards the engine. The low pressure pulse will then hits the exhaust valve as it opens, sucking the exhaust gas out."
MotorcyclePorn,2mt234,sebwiers,3,Thu Nov 20 03:25:54 2014 UTC,"When the exhaust valve opens, a high pressure pulse travels down the exhaust until it hits air.  Then it bounces back as a low pressure pulse towards the engine.   Actually, it will bounce back at any point where it encounters a sharp change in pressure.  That can be open air, but it can also be a pipe merge (larger diameter = lower pressure), baffle (back pressure), or ... a kink in the pipe.  Assuming the run up to that kink is long enough, its no different from having a baffle.  I think a RISE in pressure (such as baffle or kink) might bounce back a high pressure pulse, but that's OK if the distance is right, because you can still get resonant scavenging if the length is such that it bounces off the CLOSED exhaust valve, then creates a low pressure pulse half a wave-cycle later as the valve opens.    In any case, the kink would barely have any effect if there is something between it and the header that already causes the sort of wave front reflection you described."

MotorcyclePorn,2m3019,xSnakeDoctor,1 point,Mon Nov 17 17:45:16 2014 UTC,"Importing it as an off-road vehicle shouldn't be an issue.

MotorcyclePorn,2lv9jj,AussieDaz,1 point,Tue Nov 11 05:03:30 2014 UTC,"I don't have a supermoto (YET) but what makes them appealing to me is the riding style. When I'm on the track on my CBR600 the only thing I wan't to do is go balls to the wall but in a very finesse way, but looking at a supermoto and watching youtube videos, to me, they look like torque monsters (wheelies and other hooligan-Esq stuff) and rugged. It's not a bike that would make me wan't to get into trouble with. I really have no other explanation, and what I said probably doesn't make much sense, but it is what it is."
MotorcyclePorn,2lv9jj,Unpopular-Truth,1 point,Tue Nov 11 01:16:06 2014 UTC,"On the R1, I can go fast. But only on flat surfaces. On a supermoto, you can go anywhere. They can hop curbs, take big jumps, wheelie like nobody's business and be ridden off-road as long as you're smart. Also pretty good in the twisties. I've ridden a CR500AF sumo and I really had too much fun. That's why I don't have one. I'd end up riding on top of a line of parked police cruisers in a horse mask"

MotorcyclePorn,2jxy79,Retro_23,3,Wed Oct 22 00:06:15 2014 UTC,How did you get into said accident? I would like a very detailed step-by-step (if you don't mind telling me/us about it).
MotorcyclePorn,2jxy79,shitass70,5,Wed Oct 22 02:41:54 2014 UTC,"I was headed down a backroad about 10 miles from home. The road is about a mile long straightaway with only a few corners. So, I was approaching the first corner at about 50-60mph and I started to decelerate to make the turn. Well about halfway through the corner I hit a patch of gravel and lost complete traction with my rear tire. At that point, I was trying not to panic and I pulled clutch in while squeezing the front brake. Unfortunately the situation was out of my hands and subsequently I was thrown off my bike and straight into the asphalt. The bike and I slid for about 30 feet until we came to a stop in some grass. I was wearing shorts and a short sleeve t-shirt but I did have my chest/back armor on along with gloves and my helmet of course. All of this happened within a matter of 10 seconds or less. I was lucky enough to (barely) be able to ride home. I did all of the repairs myself, mainly cosmetic, and it was an overall satisfying process. I'm extremely lucky to be able to ride again. I hope that was detailed enough, but feel free to ask anymore questions you may have."

I'd say they were going after the title from BMW and have a new top speed bike on the market. Sure I'd like to take it for a rip in a straight line but that's all i'd want to do with it.

MotorcyclePorn,2hp5x6,steltsam,3,Sun Sep 28 14:26:04 2014 UTC,"What does ""cafe"" stand for? At first I thought it was ""coffee racers"" which would be even more strange."
MotorcyclePorn,2hp5x6,6TLaRm4g,3,Sun Sep 28 15:47:05 2014 UTC,"It dates back to the 50's in Britain where young bikers would race eachother from a favourite cafe down a designated route, and the first one back to the cafe is declared the winner.  The tradition has pretty much always existed. A local biker spot near me often has people doing it. They will ride up a certain road and then try to be the first one back, proving that they have the fastest bike and the best riding skills. You have to be pretty good at filtering traffic to win. Sometimes money is involved, sometimes just man points."
MotorcyclePorn,2hp5x6,ZombieOmNom,1 point,Sun Sep 28 17:29:59 2014 UTC,It comes from a derogatory term saying that these wannabe racers basically raced from cafe to cafe.  But now it is an embraced term.
MotorcyclePorn,2hp5x6,waxthedolphin,2,Sun Sep 28 16:08:54 2014 UTC,I thought that Cafe name was given to these bikes and riders by themselves?
MotorcyclePorn,2hp5x6,amateur_soldier,2,Mon Sep 29 09:42:06 2014 UTC,"There is a little ambiguity there but this is the reference I heard them mention on the Cafe Racer TV show.  From the Cafe Racer entry on wikipedia:   In 1973, US freelance writer Wallace Wyss, contributing to Popular Mechanics magazine, asserted the term café racer was originally used in Europe as a ""put-down"" toward riders who pretended to be road racers but instead only parked outside cafés."

MotorcyclePorn,2fy280,FourthOf5,2,Wed Sep 10 00:40:19 2014 UTC,Indeed. I didnt notice before but there is no front fork brace. It's really something to see someone wobbling down the road on a cafe bike that they have removed to much frame and support from. Still looks quite nice.
MotorcyclePorn,2fy280,Imeatbag,1 point,Wed Sep 10 00:48:41 2014 UTC,OP. Time to impress the man with advice. Anyone got a recommendation on a front fork brace? Sweet fenders?  Also OP. You two can go ultra lite camping to some cool spots on that sucker. Love the bike. I want a scrambler next.

MotorcyclePorn,2d2vd6,Phazym,4,Sat Aug 9 17:07:53 2014 UTC,By far one of the prettiest bikes I have ever seen. Props friend!
MotorcyclePorn,2d2vd6,Hepna,3,Sat Aug 9 17:06:21 2014 UTC,"Looks incredible.  How do you like the Arrow exhaust?  I usually prefer shorter pipes, like the exhaust Competition Werkes makes for the RSV4."
MotorcyclePorn,2d2vd6,JollyGingerGiant,3,Sat Aug 9 19:38:58 2014 UTC,"I like it. It's not so noisy as to annoy people, but adds depth to the sound.  I did want an Austin Racing pipe, but I have to be careful not to be too loud where I live.   That said, it's pretty noisy as standard.   I did have a short one on my old fireblade http://imgur.com/6hYMY07 but I found I could notice the fumes and they made my clothes smell!"
MotorcyclePorn,2d2vd6,JollyGingerGiant,2,Sat Aug 9 19:53:30 2014 UTC,"Right you are.  I had an '09 fireblade with a Werkes pipe, and my pants definitely had an aroma about them afterwards."
MotorcyclePorn,2d2vd6,good_looking_corpse,2,Sat Aug 9 19:58:51 2014 UTC,damn that's a nice looking exhaust
MotorcyclePorn,2d2vd6,good_looking_corpse,2,Sat Aug 9 20:44:57 2014 UTC,I've been looking at these bikes for sale and youtube videos galore. Great bike! What's your review of it? Lots of track time?
MotorcyclePorn,2d2vd6,RPLLL,3,Sat Aug 9 21:08:04 2014 UTC,"I haven't done any track days on this one, combination of lack of time and that exhaust wouldn't pass sound check!   I love it, I have had litre sports bikes for years and I cross tested this with an S1000RR, which I loved, but it felt pretty much like the gsxr1000 and the fireblade I had before it.   This is a much more involving ride, it sounds silly but it feels much more like the bike is with you on the ride, not just taking you on one.   Traction control is amazing, as is launch control (very addictive) ABS is good, cuts in a little more than I would like braking on bumpy roads though. It's also actually pretty comfy, not as small as it looks.  Bad points, it gets hot, very hot, if you get stuck in traffic, the switches for the road stuff are impossible to find, traction control + is where you expect the horn to be, indicators I can never find.   But they aren't things to ever worry about, once smashing through the gears with the quickshifter popping and banging little niggles like that are quickly forgotten!"
MotorcyclePorn,2d2vd6,vin97,1 point,Sat Aug 9 22:00:32 2014 UTC,"As far as how big/small the bike seems, how big are you? I have heard its very narrow and small. Wondering if you feel/look too big on the bike?  Thanks."
MotorcyclePorn,2d2vd6,spongebob_meth,2,Sat Aug 9 22:49:08 2014 UTC,"I am 5 10, I can't flat foot with both feet, but do have the balls of my feet down.  It's narrow, but quite tall. Suspension is stiff so there is little sag.   Height wise, it feels like the second gen RSV1000, but much much smaller overall.   I reckon someone much bigger than me would still look fine on it. I of course look awesome!"
MotorcyclePorn,2d2vd6,vin97,2,Sun Aug 10 00:59:35 2014 UTC,"God, that's fucking beautiful."
MotorcyclePorn,2d2vd6,Saythat_tomyTinnitus,1 point,Sat Aug 9 21:53:48 2014 UTC,"Although I am not a fan of the sound and the looks, the fact that it is a V4 would make me buy it.  EDIT: I wonder why no company is doing RC213V replicas based on the RSV4 with different bodywork, cylinder heads, camshafts, more power and better sound."
MotorcyclePorn,2d2vd6,Saythat_tomyTinnitus,1 point,Sun Aug 10 19:34:13 2014 UTC,More power than a 213v?  Its insanely hard to get 260+ HP out of a 1 liter naturally aspirated engine.  This is the reason Gp bikes cost millions

MotorcyclePorn,2bayy0,sebwiers,1 point,Mon Jul 21 16:00:09 2014 UTC,is that the stock tank? if not whats it from and did it require modification to fit like in the picture? looks like a cool project.
MotorcyclePorn,2bayy0,chrisbot,1 point,Mon Jul 21 22:57:10 2014 UTC,"The tank is from a Virago.  Mounts are the same style as found on the XJ and its common to put an XJ tank on a Virago, but to go the other way the front mount needed to be moved back a bit, and the rear mount located on a brace that raises it up about 4 inches.   Leaves a lot of empty room under the tank near the seat- enough to put my battery under it!  Obviously only really works if you also replace the a seat, although I could maybe have cut down the stock one just a bit in the front, recovered it, and left it otherwise as it was."

Also the suspension linkage has to be complicated as hell to work at that angle I'd be very interested in seeing it. I can't even imagine what the linkage would look like to make it compress in the right direction.

Take a look at the Britten V1000; this has got the rear shock bolted to the FRONT of the engine! And I see what you mean about the seat being thin, but fibreglass/carbon fibre is pretty rigid.

MotorcyclePorn,24cnp2,cornsnack,1 point,Wed Apr 30 11:40:47 2014 UTC,"I remember when I researched this bike way back and was blown away by its simplicity, minimalism, and classic bmw feel; it quickly became a dream bike. Then recently I go again to look it up and am really glad you posted you posted the supreme rr as it reminisces the 2011 version of the HP2 in a lot of ways (kind of). Both do their job and make the 2008 look super outdated, so much that it's completely separate now. I totally get you on the blue highlighting & found another with black BST wheels, pushing its minimalism even further into other realms of magnificence. It makes it a lot more subtle and kind of less of a statement since it doesn't look like something out of Tron anymore. They all look phenomenal and I'm torn between all of them. Figured I'd pick the original I stumbled upon =)"

MotorcyclePorn,239gfi,Legit_YG,2,Thu Apr 17 12:02:42 2014 UTC,"the thing for me, about most modern sport bikes, is that they ALL look the same. they look good, but strip them of their paint,  I don't think I'd do well in discerning what bike is what."
MotorcyclePorn,239gfi,CombatWombat55,2,Thu Apr 17 18:39:46 2014 UTC,"Yeah i think you're right. The R1 and R6 practically look the same even though the cc is quite a large jump, and tbh you could compare an R6 to a GSXR or a ninja or a CBR1000 or a panigale s or a s1000rr, and im sure you could take the paint off and the fairings and you would have no way of telling! im sure someone does, but the only thing that really differentiates them is the fairing design"

MotorcyclePorn,232o7b,thestigsc,2,Tue Apr 15 06:24:34 2014 UTC,Easily could have with better body positioning.
MotorcyclePorn,232o7b,Code206,3,Tue Apr 15 16:55:47 2014 UTC,"With better body positioning, wouldn't have had to lean as far to go around the curve at that speed, giving opportunity to lean more if needed."
MotorcyclePorn,232o7b,NorseZymurgist,2,Tue Apr 15 23:18:54 2014 UTC,"I had an argument about this very issue recently. I'm with you, I think that if you lean your body weight inboard, that will allow the bike to stay more upright and have less lean angle for a given turn. The guy I was talking to said you should lean out for safety or something.  If you look at those motogp guys, they're pretty much dangling off the inside side of the bike, and leaned waaay forwards as well. So I figure that leaning in is better, even though it goes against your instincts.  Am I on the right track here?"
MotorcyclePorn,232o7b,nickajeglin,1 point,Sat Apr 26 04:12:49 2014 UTC,"Yes, you're definitely on the right track!   The idea is to shift your weight to the inside so that the combined center of gravity is lower. Your upper body is where your weight is, so your upper body is what should be shifted off the bike. Just like the motogp guys ;-) You'll note they ALL have their upper bodies off the bikes, while about half shift their butts off the seat. Compare that to the Ninja rider above.  It is technically safer to go around a curve with your weighed shifted to the inside, but you really need that margin of safety then you're probably going way to fast for the street."
MotorcyclePorn,232o7b,NorseZymurgist,1 point,Wed Apr 30 18:15:56 2014 UTC,"I'm definitely not riding hard enough on the street to actually need it. It was more of a theoretical conversation, or what you should do if you get halfway into an unfamiliar corner and realize that you're going too fast. I said lean in, even though your instincts are screaming the opposite. Thanks for the confirmation :)"

MotorcyclePorn,21dxu4,TheStig30,2,Wed Apr 2 08:18:55 2014 UTC,"That's not entirely true and they're considered more of a ""driver's"" car, but that's entirely subjective.  There's also a race pedigree that comes with the Porsche name as well as the engineering.  They're still widely regarded as one of the only super cars you can commute in regularly without needing constant adjustments/maintenance. Clearly I have a bias, but they're both fantastically popular cars.    P.S. The Corvette might be cheaper, but its not faster and its poor weight distribution (this is something I've heard, but not experienced) make it prevalent to fishtailing.  Sources for horse power and accel stats: Porsche and Corvette"

We've had it 2 years and put about 200 miles on it, probably going to sell it along with the parts bike I have once I paint the extra tanks and covers. It should go to someone who will ride it. I had it out this weekend to burn the old gas out of the carbs."

I really want one for a piddle around bike. The salesman told me that green is one off from US army Olive Drab green because they patented the color.   They also have easier maintenance.  Like the back fender folds up to change the tire.
MotorcyclePorn,20pf4c,TheStig30,3,Tue Mar 18 22:02:29 2014 UTC,"Speed limit on highways in India is only 85 km (I think), so they're pretty capable of highway cruise here.

MotorcyclePorn,1xqo2o,PYSHINATOR,2,Wed Feb 12 22:48:21 2014 UTC,Is it your first bike? I ask because I'm seriously considering selling my GSXR 600 to get a ninja 300 and I'd really like some feedback from someone who has used both types of bike.
MotorcyclePorn,1xqo2o,thinkrage,1 point,Mon Feb 17 16:04:49 2014 UTC,"The 300 is my first bike, (technically my mom's since I'm only 17). I have no experience on larger bikes other than a Suzuki 650 v-strom that I'm still getting the hang of. The Ninja is a very small bike in general, so I've had no problems maneuvering it. The motor revs up to about 15-16k rpm. It's nowhere close in terms of power compared to larger bikes, but higher speeds of around 100mph are able to be reached. The only problem with the bike is the fact that it's a completely new model, so expect a few recalls, especially with the ABS model (just minor tweaks to the system). Otherwise, I've never encountered a single problem with the 300. It's not too expensive either, with a near $5,000 msrp. I have no experience on a GSXR600 or similar bike, so I couldn't give any advice regarding that aspect. Basically expect a bit of a slower bike, but very good fuel economy and maneuverability. I love it!"
MotorcyclePorn,1xqo2o,PYSHINATOR,2,Mon Feb 17 16:58:08 2014 UTC,I too am 17 with a 300! Love it more than most bikes with the exception being 1000s (my dad's) those bikes r just too much fun

MotorcyclePorn,1v895q,Jmk420,4,Tue Jan 14 23:05:30 2014 UTC,I don't understand why it's considered a cruiser. It doesn't look all that comfortable.
MotorcyclePorn,1v895q,scorpionMaster,2,Wed Jan 15 04:08:05 2014 UTC,"I've ridden one. The seat is actually super comfy, and my feet were basically straight down from my knees. Also, if it was built for handling, that rear tire would be significantly narrower. It felt a little hard to push into turns. Seriously, my dad's Goldwing feels nimbler."
MotorcyclePorn,1v895q,cypherADFX,2,Wed Jan 15 05:21:12 2014 UTC,"After owning one for over a year (and working at a multi-brand dealership) there isn't a bike I've ever ridden that is a better all-rounder. I've toured on my Diavel and done 600+ miles a day with minimal soreness thanks to the factory touring seat, and kept up with plenty of liter bike guys at track days on the thing, after a good amount of seat time of course.  It's oddly classified as a ""cruiser"" purely because of the riding position and the fact that there are no other bikes that directly compare (over 100+lbs lighter and significantly more powerful than it's cruiser ""competition."").  It does take noticeably more effort to toss into a corner at speed with the 240 rear tire, but once you get used to it it's almost scary how stable and confident it feels with the low center of gravity, even with the ABS and traction control shut off.  That being said, it's definitely a big change if you're used to a supersport.    After putting over 12k miles on mine in less than two full riding seasons in Minnesota, I haven't found a bike that does everything so well without suffering in some glaringly obvious way.  Also, it costs me less than $200/year for full-coverage insurance since it's technically an 1198cc ""cruiser.""  Can't argue with that!"

MotorcyclePorn,1r31gh,ArniePalmys,1 point,Thu Nov 21 03:28:48 2013 UTC,"In 'Charge', one of the riders says you miss the explosions and vibrations but at the same time, it's amazing going that fast without the sound as you feel like you're flying or something since you only hear the atmospheric drag and surroundings."
MotorcyclePorn,1r31gh,OGHamToast,0,Thu Nov 21 19:44:32 2013 UTC,"You realize traditional engines operate on combustion. There are literally hundreds of explosions happening beneath you every minute every time you ride. But they've been around long enough for people to consider them safe!  Interesting fact, when combustion engines came around and took market share away from the steam engine, the makers of steam engines called their competitors ""explosion engines"" to try and scare people into not buying them. In reality, the steam engines were far more dangerous.  Anyway, I agree, modern batteries have some thermal runaway issues still, as illustrated by the Chevy Volt, Toyota Prius, and Boeing 787. Now I'm just rambling! Sorry...."

MotorcyclePorn,1r31gh,wrdm,1 point,Wed Nov 20 23:15:22 2013 UTC,This is the guy that put the power plant into a plane after this right? I saw some kind of documentary about it. The fact that the electric engine doesn't suffer from reduced efficiency at altitude and the massive torque throughout the power band made it perfect for Pike's Peak.
MotorcyclePorn,1r31gh,myorangecrayon,1 point,Thu Nov 21 19:42:37 2013 UTC,I havent heard about any of that but it sounds very interesting. I'd love to know the name of the documentary if you can recall.

MotorcyclePorn,1r31gh,vvdr12,2,Wed Nov 20 23:19:32 2013 UTC,There is no torque curve... the electric motors create the same curve throughout their working range. Torque is instantaneous.

MotorcyclePorn,1popc7,mwilson444419,1 point,Fri Nov 1 22:43:26 2013 UTC,The inherent problem of the 90=degree V-twin is the long wheelbase: getting the shock or radiator (if water cooled) out of the way are options.  Brook Henry's Alchemy was one of the first attempts to engineer a powerful V-2 that also handled.  Hard to find now as Ducati got their shit together with the 916 series a few years after they came out... and then they were sold only as kits.

It'll be a challenge bringing it in.

MotorcyclePorn,1kxq3a,vasculopath,2,Fri Aug 23 16:37:45 2013 UTC,"I like it a lot! After the muffler change, excva and cat delete the a/f needed retuning though. It's quite loud but sounds good, it has a deep growls sound, not whiney like a lot of exhausts for 600's."
MotorcyclePorn,1jz8t1,MrHF4WD,6,Thu Aug 8 20:13:11 2013 UTC,"Oil-cooled straight-four?  Presumably ye olde GSXR1000/GSF1200 block.  All kinds of extra oil lines, though, so it's got at least a set of hot cams in it, and presumably lots of head work.  That's going to have a high peak horsepower, but a stupidly steep torque curve.  Good for drag-racing and not much else.  I wonder what they took the single-sided swing-arm off of?  Seems like a bad idea with that brutal motor.  Does the front have USD forks?  Why bother on a bike that was obviously meant for never being ridden farther than it takes to put it on a dyno?"

MotorcyclePorn,1j5ea8,WolfNman,0,Sat Jul 27 06:57:08 2013 UTC,"This is a lovely picture.  But the big problem with it that I have is that it's cold and soulless.  It's a picture of a beautiful motorcycle--but it's not a beautiful picture of that motorcycle.  It has as much soul as a draftman's drawing.  You know all about the bike, but the picture completely fails to stir any emotions.  Most of the pictures that get posted here are pretty plain, but at least it's obvious that the subject of the picture stirred up an emotion in the person who took the picture.  The very best of the pictures here are those where the bike stirred an emotion in the photographer, and he went to extra effort to try to stir up the same emotion in the people looking at the photograph.  This picture, though--it's a seriously-beautiful bike.  But the photographer merely documented the bike's existence.  He didn't try to capture anything about the bike that would capture anyone's imagination.  He just took a picture of a bike.  I'm going to let this one stand, but merely as a negative example.  This is a boring picture of a wonderful bike.  If only the photographer had put any effort at all into capturing what it is about the bike that makes it wonderful.  But instead, it's just a pedestrian picture.  I know you guys can do better, because I've seen it any number of times."

MotorcyclePorn,1huy6w,rmvvwls,3,Mon Jul 8 12:16:37 2013 UTC,"Given how many bikes they use that engine in, you've set us an impressively hard task.  It's like identifying a bike made with the engine from a Suzuki ST250/Grass Tracker/Volty/who knows what else.  The engine is just the base of the build.  The frame and wheels look custom, so all we have to go on is the engine.  It looks like the 800cc parallel twin that you'll find in the Scrambler, the Thruxton and the Bonneville.  That's the best I can do."
