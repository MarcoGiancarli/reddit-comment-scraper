mother4,3e5kgo,youremomhimom,3,Wed Jul 22 03:11:13 2015 UTC,"Listening to the PK Beam sound effect, I will agree with you there. It has too much of a whimsical feeling, and the PSI generally had a heavier, more punchy feeling in the Mother series. Otherwise, I didn't really find the other sound effects to be too bad or noteworthy enough to change. I think the loud music is probably just for the trailer's sake, as the second gameplay trailer has a better balance. And honestly, the sound effects will probably change due to the game's frequent changes in development. After all, that was a trailer from 2013."

mother4,3dwrvu,Hekset,5,Mon Jul 20 17:19:13 2015 UTC,"Well, honestly, Mother 4 got me into many, many things. I think one of my biggest inspirations of the game at the time was a leaked song by Dani called ""Night"". I'm not sure, but after listening to that song, I felt very inspired that someone from a little indie team was able to make such a quality song. I went into music composition and decided to post some of my stuff on youtube one day. I was contacted by a developer to go compose music for one of his Zelda fan projects. After that, I figured I'd have a go with some programming to put some more of my songs to use, so I learned a bunch of GML and messed around with gamemaker for a good year. I moved on to C# and now I have about 4 years worth of learning (but I still suck at it :P). Of course, with my own personal games, I'm actually really picky about what gameplay looks like or the visual style the game takes on, so I started to get into pixel art a little more in depth (I've had experience with pixel art, but it was kinda just some random scribbles I'd do on occasion). With my past history, I was later an alpha playtester for a while for the game ""Rivals of Aether"", I contacted the OoT2D team, so now I'm contributing songs to that game, I've had the chance to work with professional graphic artists for pixel art tips, and I worked with Tesserex to design a boss for his engine. And this was all just one chain reaction because I was inspired by Dani's/M4 team's work."

mother4,3dux9v,GalaxyIsBeautiful,12,Sun Jul 19 18:44:02 2015 UTC,"The idea started with Chase ""Chaisu"" and his brother messing around with RPG Maker. Later, he turned to starmen.net to look for other team members to go help him with the game, in which Chase wanted to make a game that felt very close to a Mother game. Around that time is when Zephys and core team member/programmer The Dave ended up joining the team. The game was immediately switched to gamemaker when Dave joined the team, but they found that there were limitations to what they could do with gamemaker, and thus a clean and brand new engine was created in C#. Around this time is where a lot more key members started to join, like Shane and Dani. As time grew on, Chase and many other team members couldn't find the time to work on the game anymore, so they kinda left the game and considered it cancelled.   Zephys picked up the project and decided to get even more devs to come help with the game. iirc, they included Pastel, Zane, and a handful of pixel artists.   And then, around late 2012, Zephys went inactive on the team and Pastel then picked up the project and decided to lead its development. Pretty much everything Chase and Zephys worked on were completely scrapped for Pastel's vision of the game (the story is about the only thing that's similar, but even that went through some major changes), hence the delays and the graphical differences you may see between screenshots. And that leads us to today!"

mother4,3ds8vu,Subsumed,7,Sat Jul 18 23:29:45 2015 UTC,"Referring back to my post about M4 not being completed for a while, Zane commented on the matter saying that they're not sure at the moment but when they feel confident about release, they'll bring up a release date. For now, there's no form of progress to keep us updated other than the bi-weekly updates.   Umm... not sure if I want to say... but there was a comment by a dev that something will happen to the website because the current one has some minor issues (like the team sprites being gone and whatnot). So that may explain the lack of an updated FAQS (but who knows, maybe they'll update it thanks to this post!)  But yeah, basically tl;dr Team will release a form of progress/release date when they feel confident in release, something will happen to the current website in the future. For now, relax and enjoy the bi-weekly updates! :D"
mother4,3ds8vu,CaptainCrisby,6,Sat Jul 18 23:37:24 2015 UTC,"As usual, Crisby delivers it. All of what he said!"
mother4,3ds8vu,XeniKobalt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:08:03 2015 UTC,"I see. Works in progress usually give progress estimations regardless of whether they're anywhere near the finish line (e.g. ever seen a sentence like ""this part is 10% complete"", anywhere?). So it's pretty odd to get stuff like detailed blog posts, but nothing whatsoever in terms of that."
mother4,3ds8vu,Seaofechoes,3,Sun Jul 19 01:44:56 2015 UTC,"The Mother 4 team has never been great on communications, something they've certainly been getting better at since they finally started interacting with the community on a more regular basis (AMA's, blog posts, trailers, replying on reddit). From what we can tell, I'd say it's certainly getting there; recently they asked people to apply to the team to help finish and polish up artwork, coding, and the writing for the game. They can't profit from the game so real life has to come first. I assume that's mainly why the game has taken so long to finish; the team can't put 100% focus into the game.  As far as Mother games go, they've actually always taken forever to release. Earthbound took over 5 years and Mother 3 took 11 years. I wouldn't be too worried."
mother4,3ds8vu,FelixVicis,3,Sun Jul 19 15:28:09 2015 UTC,The Dev cycle of a video game will usually look something like a series of circles. What is done in one cycle can be erased/modified by another. So an incremental counter like a percentage is excessively difficult to guess. The Bi-weekly update really is the best way we could be kept up to date right now without spoiling the whole game.   Example of dev cycle if your curious.. http://www.lc-stars.com/typo3temp/pics/f3334a1989.jpg

But, y'know, if it's not coming from their official account, it's not confirmed (which is what Zane was saying in that same thread)"
mother4,3ds8vu,zaneriley,3,Sun Jul 19 01:56:49 2015 UTC,"Its not confirmed, and probably won't happen. An objective percentage is difficult to get right, and the percentage may not always go up. Other indie games have implemented a percentage bar before, with less than satisfactory results."

He's given us many childhood memories of playing our favorite games, and is an inspiration to many. He cared about his fans and his coworkers (he was willing to cut his paycheck in half so that other workers wouldn't have to when Nintendo wasn't doing as well financially), and all he wanted was to give us games that we could have fun with. He and Nintendo are a big part of why I want to pursue a career in gaming!  I deeply respect that man for everything he's done, and my prayers go out to his family and friends. I hope he's happy wherever he may be now.  R.I.P. Satoru Iwata"

Of all of the industries kind words in light of this event, Itoi's words left me misty eyed, like he always does.   “No matter the farewell, I think the most appropriate thing to say is “we”ll meet again.” We are friends so we”ll see each other again. There is nothing strange about saying it. Yeah. We’ll meet again. Even if you didn’t have the chance to put into words how sudden it was going to be, how far you’d be traveling, or how you went much earlier than expected, I know you went wearing your best. You always put yourself second to others no matter what, helping anyone who needed it whenever they needed it. You were that kind of friend. Although you may have been a little selfish for the first time ever by taking this journey. The truth is though that I still don’t believe any of it. I feel like I am going to receive a message from you inviting me out to eat at any moment. I wouldn’t mind if you were to ask me like always if I had some free time. If you did, I’d ask you as well. Still, “we’ll meet again.” It would be great to hear from you whenever and wherever; I’ll being calling to you too. I’ll call if I have something to discuss or I want to tell you a great new idea I’ve had. We’ll meet again. Then again, you’re here with me now.”   The industry has lost an important man, Nintendo has lost a caring and revolutionary CEO. But most importantly, his friends and family have lost a wonderful man.   Let's all play our favorite Nintendo game, whether that be a Mother game or not, and remember what Iwata always believed, that video games are for fun."
mother4,3d3aop,CarolineJohnson,2,Mon Jul 13 16:51:14 2015 UTC,"Don't forget to mention that in an interview, he said the code he wrote for Earthbound was so complex that you could make an emulator with it. Not a particularly fast one, but it would emulate.  That man was a programming god.  One can only dream to be as good at programming as Mr. Iwata."

mother4,3cn0vd,MrMcKonz,10,Thu Jul 9 04:35:06 2015 UTC,"I think it's the fact that it adds so much to the atmosphere and identity of the Mother series. I mean, yeah, it's a bit abstract, but so was jumping on turtles and hitting ? blocks. When you think of the Mother series, 99% of the time you're also going to remember EarthBound's and Mother 3's insane battle backgrounds. Plus, EarthBound was one of the first RPGs to do something like that in its time. Back then, most RPGs had their battle background set to something generic, if at all."
mother4,3cn0vd,AwkwardPSI,9,Thu Jul 9 05:17:56 2015 UTC,"To me, they are the weakest aspect of the games and that will probably apply to Mother 4 as well. (Still, doesn't ruin the games for me)   Really? Out of all the gameplay, story, mechanics, leveling system, dialogue, character development and art, the weakest part of the games is the battle background? Seems like you just described a near-perfect game."
mother4,3cn0vd,I_AM_A_BICYCLE,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:47:07 2015 UTC,That's correct.
mother4,3cn0vd,Hekset,7,Fri Jul 10 03:28:18 2015 UTC,"They're freakin psychedelic.  Jokes aside I don't really know what to explain why the backgrounds in Mother are so appealing. For me it's just that they're different from other games, and leave you to imagine what your setting is yourself. Plus I like how the battle backgrounds are really different, new sights. I liked today's info thing on the Blog because we got to see how much work was put into something people would normally disregard. And also how it helped things aside from battle backgrounds, as it was used to animate the water seen in the Attract Mode video."
mother4,3cn0vd,metroids224,5,Thu Jul 9 11:25:23 2015 UTC,"They're awesome, and one of the most recognizable parts of the series, to me at least."
mother4,3cn0vd,MikeAlex01,5,Thu Jul 9 05:24:10 2015 UTC,"They're designed to control your mind to buy more MOTHER merchandise     ●x-files theme plays●  But seriously, to me, it kinda makes the battles better looking imo, because I didn't really like MOTHER having no battle backgrounds when you fight more enemies than in EarthBound. But that's different to everyone. It also makes the music go to my brain easier (I couldn't get the Atomic Robot's theme from EarthBound out of my head for a whole day)"
mother4,3cn0vd,samfivedot,3,Thu Jul 9 12:34:56 2015 UTC,"I've never really gotten it myself, honestly. I just chalk it up to difference in taste."
mother4,3cn0vd,Bluestorm83,2,Thu Jul 9 06:42:42 2015 UTC,"To me, the big draw was twofold.  First, when I was playing Earthbound, the trippy backgrounds paired well with the music and gave the feeling that whatever I was fighting was abnormal, not the usual stuff you see.  Like, sure, it's an ant... but it's NOT an ant.  And the second point is, until then, and still almost entirely today, Battle Backgrounds are still, static things.  Even action games would have unchanging backgrounds.  How many times does that guy on Guile's stage punch his fist into the air every hour, with no deviation?  Sure, EB's backgrounds cycled, but every pixel was moving in some regard, and it offered a feeling that we weren't just fiddling with menus, helped by the rolling meters."
mother4,3cn0vd,Closterdad,2,Thu Jul 9 14:43:18 2015 UTC,They give a personality and flair to the otherwise okay battle systems. It's just a part of the games now. They're so trippy and cool looking.
mother4,3cn0vd,BubblyOasis,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:18:46 2015 UTC,"For me, they really set the mood of the battle. People are heavily influenced by color and shape, and varying these can get a different effect out of people. I also enjoyed them because they added an exciting pace to the battles - a heartbeat if you will. This was really emphasized in Mother 3 where you could use that pace to your advantage.  The best use for me was during the final battles with Giygas, especially since you can't comprehend his true form. I mean who doesn't find that weird red shape completely unnerving?"
mother4,3cn0vd,KMA10k,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:04:59 2015 UTC,"Giygas pretty much IS the background, so idk."
mother4,3cn0vd,Dancing_Anatolia,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:28:58 2015 UTC,They're just super fucking pretty. They're so much more interesting than static screens or whatever ever could be.
mother4,3cn0vd,IceDragon404,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:47:34 2015 UTC,"Maybe people are just captivated with how something so colorful, trippy, and erratically moving doesn't want to make someone vomit constantly."

But seriously speaking, the game is intended to not have a large connection to previous Mother games, so only things like Mr. Saturn and some returning enemies will appear from the previous games. We might have some nods and tips of the baseball cap to previous games, but I doubt anything as large as Porky."
mother4,3cn420,AwkwardPSI,3,Thu Jul 9 05:22:45 2015 UTC,"I got 3 ideas: it either takes place in the 70s before Mother 1, it takes place in the 70s after Mother 3's ""Restoration"", or it takes place in the 70s in a completely different universe where PSI was already discovered and Giegue nor his race of aliens didn't exist."
mother4,3cn420,lightningtaco647,3,Thu Jul 9 05:32:45 2015 UTC,"They said no returning characters except the Mr. Saturns, I guess it'll.be before Porky, and they said series staples are returning"

mother4,3cmtmo,MotherFan,2,Thu Jul 9 03:26:08 2015 UTC,"My Theory: The game will have more than one ending. If I recall, I heard that there was a feature that revolves around the relationship of your party members. My guess is there are 4 endings where a main character makes a sacrifice to stop a supernatural object of some kind, that also controls the fate of the Earth, and then there's the secret ending where no one dies and you find another way to destroy the object and bring a positive change to the Earth."
mother4,3cmtmo,lightningtaco647,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:36:52 2015 UTC,"That is definitely dark stuff...but I feel like there would be a happier ending for Mother 4.

mother4,3cmgnm,rockinDS24,3,Thu Jul 9 02:01:17 2015 UTC,Now it has two perspective issues because there appears to be a room behind the back door that looks smaller for some reason.

You know that that's where they keep their keys and stuff like that, right? It's not a window or anything.  Also I super-recommend toning down on the references, even if they're just to past games.

He don't speak for them sure but it wasn't really denied so I'm kinda unsure of what to think right now. There is good progress on the game but the releases and what not are all over the place and now we don't know if it's even THIS year."
mother4,3clcsd,kylezo,5,Wed Jul 8 22:25:47 2015 UTC,"I mean, I think a good way to approach it is that it's not confirmed because they don't know. They've stated they'll tell us. That's all there is to it. They shut it down because the guy was blowing smoke and is not on the same page as the team. When someone starts parading that around as ""official"", then of course it's gonna get shut down - it's not official. Why would they let people misrepresent it and think it is? A pretty conscientious move I'd say. Not all teams care to stay on top of things like that."

mother4,3ciivv,KayShyGuy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:04:40 2015 UTC,"I think some subtle color variation/texture could really help it out. Maybe slightly less saturation, too. It's carpet, not a poster board."

Up until we got our emails today, you were passionate about it, so imo I think you should put that passion to practice and develop your skills to use for bigger projects one day."

I started out by doing edits of Pokemon sprites when I was younger and moved onto making my very own pixel creations after.  Don't let anybody get you down, if you keep studying sprites and making completely original sprites all your own there's no doubt you'll amaze everyone some day."
mother4,3c2dol,Lumisau,3,Sat Jul 4 06:22:01 2015 UTC,"The thing about... well, any skill, really, is that you need to keep on practicing it and learning it. Doing all the little sprite requests was a good step. You can already see the improvement from your Ultimate Chimera to this Eye Pod.  Just keep practicing and read all the tutorials and advice you can.http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/pixel-art-tutorials/ Here's a good start. These are for more complex things than the M4 style, but any practice is good practice.  I think doing some shading tutorials is where you should start, since a few of the colors in this latest sprite are a bit flat. Like, the rock tutorial in the link - look how interestingly it's done. Heck, compare the old and new cave tiles from the last update post. Also, remember to draw in real life. Do still lifes, portraits, muscle studies, random doodles in your notebooks... it all helps.  It just seems like you tried to jump into spriting without having a foundation beforehand, and that's normal. But if you want to be among the greats you need to actually start really small and build up.  Let's try some active, constructive criticism of your sprites, alright? Your human overworlds. They're very static - it's pretty clear you used a template. That's fine, but in order to add some dynamic-ness, you need to tweak it. Well, you did, but it's small - it's like they're just a bit of wideness or height by about one pixel. They all have the same, Travis-y face, too - I noticed this particularly on Itoi. That's not very good for such an expressive series as Mother. TVTropes has a page about it same-faciness. Let's take a look at this screenshot I found on the old site. Notice the man's large nose and wide smile. Notice the woman's more pinched smile. Notice the black guy's and the woman's chubby frames. See? It adds some variety. The long-face guy is a good start, though. The way you do hair is a little... off, but I understand how difficult spriting nice-looking hair is. Also, grabbing Claus' hair for that one guy isn't a good idea, because it's iconic... But see how the simple shading works nicely with it compared to some of the blockier ones you did, like the neighbourhood girl? Also, try to avoid black as a color for a sprite. It's tricky to use nicely. Leo's hair works, but take a look at his jacket - it's grey. A dark grey is a good replacement color.  The monkey's really cute. I think it's the best of the bunch. It feels Mother-y without looking like Bubble Monkey or Salsa.  The Eye Pod is better than your earlier enemies but it still needs more work. The pot doesn't look right. For a circle or oval shape, it should be more symmetrical. The straight line at the back of the pot's rim makes it look... well, straight, like it's more of a semi-circle sort of shape than a true circle/oval. The curve of the creature is a little straight, too, like it were a kinked pipecleaner or something. I don't know if you were going for that. The arms have a nicer curve but the thickness is inconsistent. The left arm (from out perspective) gets thinner towards its base while the right one gets thicker. Additionally, the right arm is longer than the left, which is a touch offputting. The coloring's a touch odd, too, making them look like they're sausages stuck onto the body. The blue on the eye itself is a bit pale. It works well at the edge of the eye, but around the pupil it's causing my eyes a little bit of strain. Don't be afraid to make that part a bit darker. A little bit of texture on the pot and dirt couldn't hurt.  Hopefully this should give you some insight of where you should go from here.  How old are you, by the way?"

Of course your first drawings are going to be pure shit my first drawing were shit. Prove them wrong and just sprite away! Also if you want less people to hate you don't simply resprite the base for the main characters; Be original. Spriting is one of the easiest forms of art out there and you'd be good at spriting seeing from your latest sprite! TL;DR don't be nervous, you can do it."

In fact, being in the teens is a really, really great time to learn a skill such as spriting. Go read those tutorials, go find more tutorials, do lots of things every day to get better. Try to stop editing sprites and try to make them from scratch - it'll always look better that way. You can use references, of course, but don't copy them 1:1  And who knows, maybe someday you'll show up those people who complained about your sprites."

Don't be put down what other people say about your art, because if you keep pushing on, you'll come to find yourself getting better and better!

mother4,3c2dol,Popeye116,2,Sat Jul 4 04:13:53 2015 UTC,"Your attitude about your art is irritating, to be honest. You expect instant recognition for your art, and when recognition doesn't happen, you resort to quitting your hobby. EVERYONE on this thread has been rejected, even people 30 times better than both of us. Do they quit their art in a tantrum? No, they don't. Those people keep working on their hobby so that they can improve. DON'T quit, man. Keep working on your content.   I make mediocre art. No one comes up to me and says,  ""OH Wow ur art is gr8 pls join my gamedev team.""  No one gives me recognition. I don't expect praise and approval. I don't draw because I want praise. I draw because I like it. You should draw for fun of it. Fame doesn't happen overnight, and neither does skill. Sometimes, fame doesn't even come to you! Skill, however, can come to you if you continue to work and improve.  TL;DR:  don't rely on recognition for motivation  fame is out your control  focus on building your skills first  DON'T GIVE UP"

mother4,3c2dol,flintconfirmed,-1,Sat Jul 4 20:30:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not blaming the team for the quality of my ""art"". The main reason I think it's bad is because of various comments by a few users calling my stuff ""Bad Edits"". I agree, I was being a tad overdramatic, and my art was mainly made for a few friends to begin with, and they told me it was good stuff, so I decided to apply. The reason I got pissed was because of a particular user called rockinDS24 or something like that who called my stuff ""bad edits"", and I wanted so badly to get into the team so I could tell him my ""bad edits"" are going to be in the game, so that he would shut up about criticizing my stuff..... you know, after writing this, I kinda feel like making a few more sprites later..."
mother4,3c2dol,MarchingBro,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:06:26 2015 UTC,The main reason you wanted to be on the team was so you could prove yourself to some random guy on the Internet you don't even know?

Honestly, I don't think an EarthBound-length RPG would be a good fit for an arcade booth even if the controls etc. are fine. Saving would do nothing useful, and you wouldn't be able to get to the final boss unless you've been playing for hours straight."

mother4,3c0noe,dudebro117,5,Fri Jul 3 19:25:46 2015 UTC,"I think it's a viable idea.  My concern is the save system. if multiple people have access to the system, or if it's public, there may be issues. It shouldn't be fair to let someone start off using someone else's save data. There were methods that involved a written code-based saving, such as the wonder mail system in Pokemon Mystery Dungeon and in some Need 4 Speed games, and those worked fairly well. Implementing that securely would be a challenge.  How do you propose an emulator could handle multiple save files from multiple users without overwriting someone's save?"
mother4,3c0noe,AwkwardPSI,3,Fri Jul 3 21:39:22 2015 UTC,"Well, the original idea wasn't for a public system; I'd be keeping it in my back room, just as something neat to have."

mother4,3by33e,duvangrgataonea,6,Fri Jul 3 15:33:49 2015 UTC,I played it first at a local game rental store in my home town.  I rented it because of the huge box it came in.  The third save had a game at the part where everyone was in robot suits and that freaked kid me out.

The last couple of years have been one of the most challenging times of my life. And like you, for some reason this was also the time where I finally beat Earthbound after first trying it many years ago. It struck something so deep within me, resonating far and wide in my every day life that it really has become part of the mirror we all have of ourselves. The music, the art, the personality, the love, the storyline, the themes -- everything.  And what's greater is that I found that the community is amazing to boot.  Did you ever try Mother 3?  edit P.S.: If it wasn't obvious already: I'm glad that the game helped in some way with all of that mess you went through. My condolences about your father. And keep on chugging along! Things will turn around."

It hasn't been released outside of Japan, but you can play it on a Gameboy Advance emulator and you can use the fan translation and patch the rom for Mother 3. I'm gonna play it, and you should too. It's regarded as being as good or even better than Earthbound I hope you give it a try before Mother 4 drops."

mother4,3bv0eg,ChocolateExpert,12,Thu Jul 2 11:12:36 2015 UTC,"Well, that's the thing.  With the amount of screenshots, music, trailers, etc. that has gone into it, it probably isn't a hoax.  If it IS a hoax, it's the best damn hoax I've ever seen.  And if it were a hoax, I'd even be amused that they managed to carry it on for the either 5 or 2 and a half years that people have been following this.  I say five or two and a half because the project in its current for isn't the original idea, as it was re-started from scratch then.  So there's a possibility that the original effort was real and the new effort is a hoax.  But again, these people put a LOT of work into the sprites and music and all that stuff  So I'd say it's most likely real.  Sometimes you get a serious fan who simply insists that a thing that should exist actually become real."

mother4,3bv0eg,Chewbraccaa,5,Wed Jul 8 21:28:09 2015 UTC,"Nah. There are people who have explicitly mailed Nintendo to report it and get it shut down, but Nintendo hasn't lifted a finger.  I mean, we still could get a Chrono Trigger: Crimson Echoes-tier disaster, but I highly doubt it! (Knock on wood, just in case). Nintendo just doesn't care about something that won't take any money away from them (like the Mario 64 things could have hypothetically taken away sales, but M4's its own new thing)."
mother4,3bv0eg,Lumisau,7,Thu Jul 2 12:18:47 2015 UTC,"Nintendo actually was forced to do away with the Mario 64 HD online demo thing, as it used graphical assets from Mario Galaxy, and legally if they didn't challenge it, then they'd be making official Mario graphics open to the public domain.  Which would allow others to use official Mario models in their games, which would breach Nintendo's copyrights...  As far as the Chrono Trigger: Crimson Echoes thing, I say shame on Square for doing away with that, but again, that used actual Chrono Trigger assets.  The only thing that Mother 4 has is Mister Saturn.  And Mister Saturn is, as far as I know, the sole property of Shigesato Itoi himself; he even sells belly-warmers with a Mr Saturn theme.  And he seems cool."
mother4,3bv0eg,Bluestorm83,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:32:19 2015 UTC,"Its understandable why Crimson Echos got attacked, but what about Chrono Resurrection?"
mother4,3bv0eg,Bluestorm83,3,Thu Jul 2 14:54:33 2015 UTC,"Well, since Square shut them down, they released... I think three different re-releases of Chrono Trigger.  The Playstation Store version, the DS version, and the Phone version, as far as I know.  If there was a free PC version out there, they'd no doubt believe it would be cutting into their profits.  Which makes no sense, as you can't take a PC on the go in your pocket (there go the DS and Phone versions,) nor can most people play it on their TV.  Also, no matter how faithful a fan-update is, it's not a true remake, and would no doubt have many blemishes that Square could have done better than if they ever did their OWN real Remake.  Also, all of the game's story, character designs, etc. are copyright to Squaresoft and Akira Toriyama.  So even if they loved it and didn't care about its possible effect on money, they had to defend those copyrights.  Sometimes the Law sucks.  Want to know something interesting?  They say that a pirated game is a lost sale, but that's a fallacy.  I missed Chrono Trigger's first release on the SNES, so for me to play the game I'd have to buy it used (and the creators get no money from that sale, only from the original owner's purchase,) or emulate it.  So I, being in Highschool, downloaded it and Emulated it.  After I beat it, I bought a copy off of a friend of mine named Brian.  After I then beat that cartridge, and I heard it was re-releasing on the PS1, I bought that version new.  Then I bought a new copy of the DS version.  My younger brother who ALSO beat my illegal copy bought it on his phone.  My cousin who downloaded his own after seeing me play the illegal copy has bought Chrono Trigger in FIVE DIFFERENT FORMATS, all legit new sales, he's so crazy for it.  Do you know anyone who beat Chrono Trigger so many times that they saw all 13 different endings, including the ""main"" ending of the New Game Plus 3 times AND the first playthrough ending at least 5 times?  No, but now you know ONE, and he knows that brother and that cousin and that cousin's two brothers, all of whom own at least one copy of Chrono Trigger.  Even though they all lived in the same house.  I hope that someone from Square Legal stumbles onto this thread here and realizes that the Chrono Trigger fans out here are RABID for a sequel, even to the point that I'd written up some ideas about what they should have done with Chrono Break just incase anyone wants to ever make it, like the Mother 4 guys are doing, since the real companies can't be arsed."

mother4,3bv0eg,Bluestorm83,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:08:22 2015 UTC,"Well, realizing that the Chrono Trigger and the Chrono Cross were objects/items/plot devices in the other games, I started by thinking of the title, Chrono Break, and thought ""what would that be about?""  Instead of something that the parts needs, relies on, or acquires at one point, I had the idea that perhaps it was something that was happening.  That time itself had started to break, after all the time travel and parallel universe stuff and changing events, even for the better.  So I thought, start the game in a dome in 2300 AD, only in a timeline where Lavos was defeated.  The main character, whose name I can't pick because I always take way too damn long naming characters but who has blonde hair, finds himself and two friends, one a bookish history student (boy) and the other a girl into sports and physical activities suddenly present at a terrorist attack on a research facility near wherever they happen to be.  Haven't found a convincing reason for them to be there yet, maybe that'll be written off as a coincidence at the moment but be revealed to be part of fate or predestination or whatever.  ANYHOW, Guy and Boy and Girl defend themselves from this future-terrorist force's attack drone robots (think more sinister, smaller versions of Robo,) as best they can while trying to escape.  This facility turns out to be involved in time research, and this terrorist unit begins to manipulate the past, changing the world around them.  In what seems to be an early plot crescendo, our three plucky youths decide that they have to stop this, or face everything outside the facility's, like, temporal shielding being erased or changed to the point that they won't recognize it anymore.  So we get some more of this first relatively easy dungeon, and then they face off against two simultaneous bosses, each at a different console.  What happens next depends on which enemy goes down first; defeating one causes him to fall on the controls he's near, the shields go down, and one of your party members (not the main dude) gets completely erased from history, along with half of civilization.  The other two get dumped into a different time period while the surviving enemy tries to get the shields back up and stop his own organization from being erased.  The rest would be vague plot points, which I'll rattle off below.  --The main character's time period, as well as almost all of the other times/worlds you travel to are tangent timelines that can't exist in a timeline where Chrono Trigger ended with the best ending.  --The game's main villain is trying to re-create the Earth's destruction, as he was originally from a timeline after the Day of Lavos, won't exist in any ""Lavos loses"" timelines, and is willing to doom most of humanity to maintain his own existence.  And he's PROBABLY being manipulated too, because, come on, human main antagonist?  Please.  This is a Square series here.  --As our main character travels between these alternate tangent timelines he will occasionally be erasing and restoring different events and histories, and party members will be restored, erased, restored, even changed.  What happens to him in the facility in the beginning allows him and his two friends to retain their memories of other timelines and not be affected by changing pasts.  Also, around 1/5 of the way through the game, their own mode of time travel will allow them to give this ability to other party members.  So the possibility of finding an ally who is dependant on a life support machine, then changing the past so he was never injured or ill or whatever, and he remembers both lives he lived, is a thing I want to explore.  --I would like to reveal, at some point in time, a FAR future setting that would be kind of like a combination of Zeal and a high technology sci-fi world, where both science and magic exist.  This would be a paradise that our characters would be working towards, one that can't interfere with its own past in any way, due to it being so far ahead because any small change could undo them all, but that hopes that they succeed.  Eventually we would find that our heroes' version of their present can't lead to that paradise.  Ever.  (The super-good ending of a New Game + would, however, allow their world to lead to a not-so-bad parallel timeline with the paradise's world that would become interconnected, sort of like the two worlds of Chrono Cross.  Because I do NOT believe in a no-win scenario.  Hell, even the good ending that would erase the starting version of the main world would show the main characters leading happy, terrorist attack free lives.)  Time periods would include: -- Two versions immediately after the Day of Lavos, one with Lavos dead and humanity celebrating their close call, one with Lavos looming on the horizon as civilization burns and there is war and starvation, and the few still operational domes become choked with refugees. -- One year 2600 where humanity is extinct, but a Robot civilization is planning to leave the planet via space ship to try and prevent further Lavos events. -- At least 3 timelines/worlds that I haven't quite thought of yet.  Bear in mind that all of these timelines are ones that won't actually exist in any actual Chrono Trigger scenario, and as such are all on the verge of erasure.  Our heroes efforts will be not only to save their own world, but all of these other impossible worlds if they can.  I'd like to use the loss of one timeline early on, maybe the first place they go after the incident at the facility, as a tragedy to spur them to this selfless mindset, and an anger at a uncaring multiverse that insists on only ""correct"" timelines.  The name ""Chrono Break"" would eventually be shown to have a double meaning, when we get a guest appearance by the Sages from Zeal, who examine our main characters and determine they have the ability to break the shackles of time.  In a New Game + ONLY, the original human antagonist, trying to save his own post-apocalyptic timeline, will be a recruitable character (like Magus, only even more secret and much, MUCH tougher to recruit,) if you can do some special stuff and orchestrate a timeline where he exists and his timeline doesn't suck (turns out, he was trying to save his younger siblings, as he knew that his tangential reality would fade away when Chrono and the gang saved the world and Serge and Gang 2 defeated the Time Devourer.  Everyone has their own motives, after all.)  And that's all I can remember that I'd wanted, at the moment."

mother4,3bpc2i,Rivers1000,19,Wed Jul 1 01:53:19 2015 UTC,"It's physically impossible for this game to be released on the WiiU or 3DS. An entirely new engine would have to be written that perfectly replicates what the current engine does, which could take another heavy bunch of months.   Mother 4 contains things that Nintendo finds disagreeable - Leo's smoking, for instance. This would result in a censored game. Despite Nintendo getting better on this front, they desperately want to keep its family-friendly image. To this day, Game Corners in Pokemon have been removed in all regions due to Europe's laws on gambling.  Nintendo 100% would not be interested in licensing a fangame. They're not even interested in a free translation for Mother 3, so what makes you think that they'd be interested in something they have no control over? It would not speed up the process in any way, shape, or form either. They won't just say ""Oh, here, you can have some of these random spriters we have lying around"" or ""Hey, that looks neato, have some cash"". That's not even what Nintendo does. As Mother is a 2nd-party series, they'd have more luck contacting the creators of Mother 3, 1-UP Studio (formerly Brownie Brown). Nintendo themselves did not make the Mother series. Also, the language barrier would be an extreme... well, barrier, to actually talking to anyone regarding this. You can't just call Reggie up and say ""Yo, can you speak to Iwata about this? We've got a cool game you might like and it's also a sequel to one of your 2nd party series despite the fact we weren't actually contracted to make one!""  The fanbase would not be pleased with an official Mother game without Itoi's input. The fact that Itoi is not involved is one of the main complaints people have about this game even calling itself Mother 4. Can you imagine what it would be like if it became a legit product? I don't know if you've been on places outside of this subreddit or the Youtube pages, but those have a heavy positive bias. There's a lot more animosity for this game than you'd expect and it being published by Nintendo would not help.  Also, I think it's far more special as a fangame made by fans for fans with its current level of quality. If Nintendo released it, it'd be a Nintendo game. If fans released it, it'd be a testament to the dedication and passion of fans. Yes, this would get erased if Nintendo licensed it.  tl;dr It's so, so much more complicated than you think. No, Nintendo can't and won't help."
mother4,3bpc2i,Lumisau,-3,Wed Jul 1 06:29:16 2015 UTC,"I always appreciate a candid response. I appreciate the points you make but I still feel that this could work if approached correctly. I really didn't appreciate the strawman about ""just calling up Reggie"" and ""that looks neato have some cash!"". I never meant to imply  that involving Nintendo would be an easy task, I argued that it might be worth the effort given the recent attention the Mother series has gotten. If done correctly they might actually consider it. 2 months ago i would probably have agreed with you that this would never work, but with the release of Earthbound Beginnings in North America i think things have changed enough to at least consider this option and try to approach Nintendo with it. I admitted in the Op that it would be a long shot but a shot worth taking. The series may be second party but Nintendo still owns it.. If push came to shove Nintendo can do what they want with the IP.  As for censorship, to me that's a moot point since Nintendo can already censor the entire game as copyright infringement. Would you rather a little censorship that allows the game to exist? Or would you have Nintendo just shut the project down forcing the team to change the name and game assets into something distinctly non-Mother? Going to Nintendo implies that Nintendo will have input on the game, and while I understand that might not be ideal to some, I think Nintendo's involvement would ultimately result in a better game overall even with a bit of censorship.  I've seen plenty of negative feedback about this project from those who treat the Mother series like some kind of sacred cow that no one but Itoi should touch. most of which I find rather silly. Particularly the complaints about Itoi not being involved since he has even said if another Mother game were made he would want someone else to make it so he could experience it the way others experienced his games, that is to say, as a player himself. and honestly i think MORE people will accept the idea of the fan game if Nintendo published it. Particularly if Itoi were to give it a green light.   If Nintendo giving this game a thumbs up would actually upset fans more, then those fans really are just being silly. To me Nintendo getting involved is a great way to ensure that this game doesn't tarnish the legacy of the series. I personally don't think it will anyway, but Nintendo would undoubtedly want to make sure it holds true to the series and in all likelihood would ask Itoi give his OK on content even if they can't get him actively working on the game.  Also Nintendo has published other companies games in the past. Look at the DS Dragon Quest remakes. Square Enix had no intention of bring those games to North America, but Nintendo saw an opportunity and stepped in to help with the localization and made it happen. Now I recognize that this is a COMPLETELY different situation, but it shows that Nintendo has done similar things in the past. They have stuck their neck out and put money into games that others wouldn't because they saw an opportunity in it. I think that with the positive attention the Mother series has gotten recently Nintendo MIGHT see an opportunity in this fan game and give it a shot. Also if the game really is close to being done anyway, Nintendo wouldn't have to put very much money into it, making it more likely that they would consider it.  As for your concerns about the game engine, I think that is irrelevant, switching to a different engine may take time, but honestly at the rate things have been going, I'd bet money that if they started today Nintendo would have this game done, new game engine and all, faster than we are likely to get it with how things are right now. I could be wrong though. Also I really don't mean any disrespect to the Mother4 team in saying that. It's just that we've had a ton of delays. And though I want to believe that they are close to done, at this point there is no way to know if it's ever getting released.  You mentioned the mother 3 translation, but that is a completely different situation. That translation represents someone else's interpretation of an established game. And even if they did use the fan translation they would still have to pay the localization team to go through every word of the fan translation  and compare it with the original Japanese to make sure it matches and fits Nintendo policies. Making adjustments as needed. Basically using the fan translation would be just as much work as doing a new translation on their own. And since they didn't think localization was worth the expense to begin with, it doesn't surprise me that they still felt that way despite being offered the fan translation for free. So to me, their refusal to use the fan translation is totally justified and bears little weight on the likelihood of them taking on this project.  Naturally Nintendo would want to make the localization interpretations and not take some random fans translation that may not be totally accurate to begin with. Mother 4 is a different animal completely. as I said before if Nintendo got involved of course they would make changes so they would have some control over it. Ideally they wouldn't  change too much.  Finally I take issue with your last statement. This will always stand as a testament to the dedication and passion of the fans. Nintendo getting involved would in no way erase that and you suggesting that it would is silly. All the Mother games are Nintendo games, getting Nintendo involved would actually  make this MORE of a Mother game in my eyes, not less. If I were on the team, having Nintendo officially recognize my work and say it's worthy of being called an official Mother game would be highly rewarding.   After typing all that I still must admit that you could be totally right, because all this is a long shot. But nothing ventured, nothing gained. It's worth trying, even if it's destined to fail."
mother4,3bpc2i,Lumisau,7,Wed Jul 1 10:29:46 2015 UTC,"The reason I was being strawmanny was because you made it sound like it was that simple to pitch a video game to Nintendo. This isn't like Steam Greenlight, where if enough people say they'd want to play it means it'll pop up for sale.  Now, let's break this down and consider what would actually go into making Mother 4 available on the WiiU. I've done some research on how to get a game onto the eShop. First of all, you need to become an authorized developer for Nintendo. Now, this isn't so hard - you just need a company (which is Azure Studios in this case), the ability to ensure confidentiality (we haven't had very many leaks at all!) and demonstration of abilities (might be a bit trickier - this means that they have made some games already, and while these guys do work as indie devs I'm not entirely sure how many completed games they've made amongst themselves and they've made a grand total of none as Azure).  Provided they pass this, they get a Nintendo dev kit. ""Pricing for a development kit starts at $2,500"" (http://www.warioworld.com/apply). Uh-oh. This'd have to come out of pocket, as they refuse to take donations. I mean, sure, in this case they could feasibly set up an IndieGoGo and fans might even easily make it for them, but I know in my cold, withered heart that faith in the team would drop dramatically. I mean, most devs who want their thing on the eShop pay for this themselves, even the guy who made Meme Run.  So let's say they scrounge up the money. Now they have to recreate the game so it works on the WiiU. Nintendo themselves would aid them in no way - it would all be up to Dave and the other coders to remake their engine (again), but this time to run on completely different hardware. I said a heavy bunch of months but that was me being generous - Probably more than a year would go into doing this. I guess they could finish tweaking the graphics and story in this time. This is doable, yes, such as Daisuke Amaya's Cave Story, but Cave Story was already completely done by the time the decision to remake it was made and it's a relatively simple sidescroller compared to a very unique RPG system. Because Cave Story was already done, this would allow a team like Nicalis to comfortably come in and work on it - and also keep in mind that Cave Story was ported 6 years after its completion. Compare this to everyone grousing about M4's lateness.  Now, we go onto copyright. This is a whole ball of hooey. Just because they work for Nintendo does not give them the right to use any of their property. Now, I won't claim to know anything about copyright, but I do know they would again have to fork out a lot of dosh to use the Mother or Earthbound trademark. These guys weren't commissioned to make the game, they made it themselves. I highly doubt that this, being the case, would even allow them to get the rights to make another game. Maybe to, I dunno, use Ness in advertising or something. But not to make a whole sequel.  So we're down several thouand dollars. The game comes out for like, $5. Hooray! Now others are going to be irritated it's not free anymore (I know plenty of people say ""I want to pay!"" but secretly there's no one who's truly upset it'll be free) and that people without a WiiU and/or 3DS can no longer play it. H-Hooray. Now, I'm not saying it wouldn't be absolutely cool to have a game on the WiiU and all, but Mother 4 doesn't feel like the right one.  Now, onto some other points. You keep bringing up Itoi's ""I want to be the player"" interview. I don't know how familiar you are with Japanese culture but the whole thing was Itoi saying ""I don't want to make another Mother game, so please do not bother me about it"". It's not socially acceptable in Japan to say that sort of thing point-blank. That's not to say he wouldn't play it, but I don't think the chances are very high at all. Mother 4, in Japan, would be considered a doujin game and it's not the sort of thing the creator would really pay much mind to.  Your censorship point... isn't a point. That's not censorship, that's copyright and the fact Nintendo has the right to defend their copy (yeah). We could have a dead game, a censored game... or the game as it is now.  Every argument you have against the fantranslation is an argument against Mother 4. ""That translation represents someone else's interpretation of an established game."" So does Mother 4, another person's interpretation of the series as a whole and how it should continue. ""..have to pay the localization team to go through every word of the fan translation and compare it with the original Japanese to make sure it matches and fits Nintendo policies"" They would have to pay a team to scour Mother 4 to make sure it matches Nintendo's policies - which, as I mentioned before, it doesn't, such as with Leo's smoking. ""So to me, their refusal to use the fan translation is totally justified and bears little weight on the likelihood of them taking on this project."" And vice-versa. The fact that Earthbound and Beginnings are gaining steam doesn't mean that Nintendo really wants to do more with the Mother series beyond perhaps releasing Mother 3 at some point. Also, Mato is a professional translator - he's been hired by real companies to do real translation work for real games and anime. The folks in Azure aren't professional, as far as I can tell (save for maybe the composers? But they're doing unpaid indie work here). If anything, Mato's translation has way more of a chance of being accepted compared to Mother 4 (and even then it'd still be a legal nightmare, but now's not the time to talk about Mother 3).  Your Dragon Quest example is a completely different case to Mother 4's. DQIX, IV, V, and VI were 100% finished, complete, already made on the DS, no more work. It was a hit in Japan, as expected, but historically DQ games in the past have done really mediocrely in the West for... whatever reasons. So Nintendo basically said ""Hey, wait, these are good games on a handheld system which are all fresh and sparkly! Maybe the Westerners will like these better!"", and so they translated them and marketed them. That's all they did - no extra coding, no extra funding, just a strangely large marketing campaign and a translation. Mother 4 requires the actual game to be completed, to be ported to the WiiU, to be translated into Japanese (eventually), to be polished, everything. There'd be a gazillion times more effort put into finishing Mother 4 (even if they provided their own workers) compared to what happened to the DQ games. Furthermore, Square Enix is a hugely popular and established company who know what they're doing (uh, most of the time) and any collaboration with them can only benefit both companies. Who the hell are Azure? Bunch of 20-somethings who haven't published a game before. Harsh, but true, even if I believe in them. Belief doesn't make a game company reputable.  I really don't think you quite understand all the legal ramifications of this all, too, even aside from copyright. Sometimes people make fan characters for shows and games and stuff, and they're put into the show or whatever, officially signed over to the show's creators. But what if the character's a hit? They get a bunch of toys and merch and stuff. Is it okay for the creator to ask for more compensation? The character belongs to them. But they signed it over to the show. But it belongs to them. Imagine this, but on a larger scale.  Also, Nintendo has no interest in killing Mother 4 either. They're not Square Enix! People have actually reported M4 and Nintendo's done nothing. So don't worry.  Now, at the end of all this, I'll say that I really do hope in the future that all the guys and girls behind M4 get something in the eShop someday... but not Mother 4."
mother4,3bpc2i,black_fractals,-5,Wed Jul 1 12:39:54 2015 UTC,"You know, typing ten paragraphs doesn't make your arguments any more valid.  Sure you can talk about it and theorize until you have come up with a bunch of reasons why this might work, but at the end of the day the answer is still this: Mother 4 has zero chance of ever being officially picked up or even recognized by nintendo, so much so that there hasnt even been a C & D in all the years M4 has been in development.  It isnt gonna happen.  Whether its a matter of pride or just ambivalence for the Mother series, Nintendo just doesnt roll like that."

mother4,3bpc2i,lightningtaco647,3,Thu Jul 2 00:33:15 2015 UTC,"Tbh, the only thing I want positive between Nintendo and the Mother 4 Team is to have Itoi give his thoughts and opinions on the game and maybe even become the ""Player"" like he said (Chances are its very unlikely considering he seems like a very busy person)."
mother4,3bpc2i,lightningtaco647,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:44:15 2015 UTC,"Not too sure I understand what you mean. Would you care to elaborate? You make it sound like you would actually oppose any involvement from Nintendo. In my eyes Nintendo helping to finish and publish the game would be great for everyone involved, including Mother fans as it could hasten an offical Mother 3 localization and open the door to future games in the series (most likely without Itoi's involvement which is sad but better than no new games at all in my opinion.)"
mother4,3bpc2i,Pk_King64,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:03:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'll go deeper. If Nintendo came in, helped the team out, made the game cannon, and released it on their consoles, that'd be freaking fantastic and all. Maybe it's just me at this point, but, what I fear is the amount of recognition the team itself is gonna get once the game will be released on Nintendo's system. I fear that most people who don't know how Mother 4 was actually created will be like ""Oh it's just another Earthbound game made by Nintendo"" when in fact it was made by a group of dedicated fans for a labor of love. All I'm saying is that if an official release were to happen and it was on Eshop, what I'd like to see is something like ""This game was made by a professional group of Earthbound/Mother fans"" or something like that. Just plain ol' recognition, that's all."
mother4,3bpc2i,Pk_King64,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:39:14 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I agree completely, the team deserves recognition for the hard work they've put into it. In my ""Ideal Fantasy of How This Would Work"" Nintendo fully recognizes and and markets the game as a creation of dedicated fans, and even compensates them for the work they have done (probably not 5 years worth of compensation but something at least)"
mother4,3bpc2i,Rockto_AP,2,Wed Jul 1 03:54:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not on the mother 4 team obviously, but I think as long as this game comes out we will be happy. I would also say in my humble opinion I think to have Nintendo put it on their system would be awesome. But I don't know if the mother 4 team would want to do that. Same with Nintendo. Like I said as long as the game comes out awesome like most are expecting than I would be happy. That's just me"
mother4,3bpc2i,Lucas5655,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:23:54 2015 UTC,"Oh for sure, I agree. I just want it to come out and play it most of all. I'd be more than happy with that. I'm simply suggesting this as a means of getting there and hopefully legitimizing this awesome project. There have been a lot of delays and I thought that maybe if Nintendo got involved or helped out the game would finally get done, with the bonus of making the game an offical entry in the Mother series.  I am curious though as to why you think the Mother 4 team wouldn't want to do it? If I were them I would be thrilled at the possibility of having my work accepted and published by Nintendo. Where is the down side for the team? I mean there is even the possibility that Nintendo might pay them for the work they've done on the game if they did publish it. That's not a sure thing, but it could happen."
mother4,3bpc2i,Burken29,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:39:21 2015 UTC,"Well I would assume Nintendo may want to change things here or there to fit what they want. I wouldn't want to make alterations to a game I work hard on. And I wasn't trying to say that Nintendo helping with Mother 4 would be a bad thing. Plus I would want the team to do anything to speed up the production of this game as long as it doesn't make the game any less awesome as the team wants it to be. I may just have a pessimistic view of things but I just see Nintendo doing what ever they want with the game. Which could be bad or good. Because lets face Nintendo know how to make awesome games. But Nintendo may want to change too much of the game for the dev team. If they do this I just want them to still have power in the creation of this game. I probably made no sense, but I hope you have  understood my point. Now if you will excuse me I must rest my fingers because typing on an iPad is really hard when typing for this long!"
mother4,3bpc2i,CyborgWombat,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:43:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. I think I understand a little better now. And you're right, there is a chance that Nintendo would make changes... Hopefully, if the Mother 4 team approached them correctly with a plan , Nintendo would give them the freedom to do what they want with the game. They would simply need to be smart in their negotiations when they approach Nintendo. Admitteldy, negotiating would be difficult for them though since they are technically illegally using Nintendo IP, but I think that if they approach them the right way Nintendo will work with them and compromise. If negotiations didn't work out they could always go back to working on the game without Nintendo's help."

But, if you want to check out some songs that are unused and whatnot, be sure to check out Zankoaaron's youtube page here: https://www.youtube.com/user/Zankoaaron And you can check out Shane's first piece for Mother 4 (which would become the reason the team let him join): https://youtu.be/shUcMk9X1w0"
mother4,3beuuk,CaptainCrisby,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:29:07 2015 UTC,"My assumption is that there won't be anymore songs on Soundcloud until they actually reveal more in their updates, but who knows?"
mother4,3beuuk,PieNinja314,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:30:26 2015 UTC,"The Soundcloud playlist's just a preview of the whole soundtrack, they'll release everything after the game comes out."
mother4,3bexd3,PieNinja314,4,Sun Jun 28 16:36:27 2015 UTC,I know that the team confirmed that series staples like the Mr. Saturn would be returning. Pollyanna is almost more of a staple to the series than Mr. Saturn (it appeared in some way in all three games).  So...probably yes!
mother4,3bexd3,dudebro117,3,Sun Jun 28 22:15:20 2015 UTC,"Shane made this awhile back, but it's probably going to go unused. The song has Pollyanna, Snowman, and Tessie! together."
mother4,3bexd3,Ness_SNES,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:01:41 2015 UTC,I hope so too. I remember reading something saying that songs like snowman would be in the game though.
mother4,3bexd3,dumball92master,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:44:51 2015 UTC,Snowman would be a great addition too. Very peaceful.

mother4,3bccy0,CaptainCrisby,6,Sat Jun 27 21:45:02 2015 UTC,"Out of respect for the team and Shane (and because of the time consuming matter editing these takes) we'll no longer be uploading Shane's streams. We recommend that you go check out Shane's streams every Monday-Saturday at 4:00 Pacific Time, they're a lot of fun to watch, and great if you want to hear things coming from the composer's perspective on Mother 4. Thank you!"
mother4,3bccy0,metalknuckles,-1,Sat Jun 27 21:45:07 2015 UTC,??
mother4,3bccy0,PunchyG,-1,Sat Jun 27 22:59:23 2015 UTC,It feels really kind of scummy that Shane just goes behind the team's back like this... I wonder what it's like to work with him. :/
mother4,3bccy0,PunchyG,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:26:41 2015 UTC,"It's not intentional, he doesn't necessarily do it on purpose. And he's very busy, so often times he isn't aware what's been announced and what hasn't been (he stated on stream yesterday that he actually doesn't look at the blog updates because he's so busy)"
mother4,3bccy0,PunchyG,0,Sun Jun 28 02:50:21 2015 UTC,"I dunno... I really have a hard time believing that. He does this stuff on twitter all the time. Like.. you'd KNOW what your team has put out. Sorry, I just... really don't buy that."
mother4,3bccy0,prismdancer,0,Sun Jun 28 03:11:15 2015 UTC,"He probably tweets that stuff because he's kinda the ""public guy"" of the team. The team constantly messages each other on Slack about updates, and while Shane gets these he never reads over them (which he also talked about on stream :P) but, y'know, a couple of days ago Shane got in trouble and now he's much stricter about revealing stuff on stream, most of the time he just ignores the questions, so I guess that's a step haha"
mother4,3bccy0,Pk_King64,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:26:33 2015 UTC,"So he's the ""public"" guy despite not keeping up to date on everything. Great. I thought Zane did community management stuff. Why even have a Mother 4 twitter if shane is just going to leak stuff? -_-'  ""I put up a clear notice that from there on in the preserve could be spoiler territory. If you read it, that was your decision, not mine.""  It was NOT my choice to read the starmen thread and out of nowhere people are talking about the villain. You put the leaks out, behind spoilers or not, and people are going to talk about that stuff.  The stuff that was leaked, and spoiled the game. The stuff that Pastel said WAS a big spoiler when he said ""I don't think the leaker knew how big of a spoiler it was."" That was your choice. YOU spread stuff the team would rather not have talked about and now, anybody who goes to the Starmen thread gets a major spoiler without ever intending to. So you know keep your passive aggressive smileys to yourself. -_-'"
mother4,3bccy0,PunchyG,2,Sun Jun 28 05:12:27 2015 UTC,Also keep in mind that Pastel's hand was twisted. He had to address it because someone else did.

mother4,3bf0xw,Hekset,4,Tue Jun 30 02:52:37 2015 UTC,Why don't you just combine this with the Groucho thread? And I don't think any of us have the answer for this but the Mother 4 Team. I kinda doubt they will bring it back since it's just an optional mini boss.

Theres just alot of work that has to be done with demos, most of which none of us understand.

mother4,3b8lrp,Ness6464,3,Sat Jun 27 01:06:58 2015 UTC,I agree. It doesn't have to be a huge demo (like Splatoon's) but heart just sort of a walk and talk with a few enemy's kind of thing.

mother4,3b8lrp,hecticforest,3,Sat Jun 27 05:46:40 2015 UTC,"If I'm right, it's not nearly as simple as just, make sure this part works and take a chunk out to play.  If they release a demo, they'd have to release a lot of the game to make sure it functions, but lock up a lot of the game. Which could be accessed probably easily by hackers and stuff. They might not wanna risk it. That's my take, at least."

mother4,3b9lwl,wetterdew,3,Sat Jun 27 02:57:12 2015 UTC,"As someone who has a friend working on a different pixel game: it's honestly just one pixel at a time. You use reference images, such as concept art, and then you redraw it on Paint super-zoomed in and only a few pixels at a time. Then you color it in. Then you tweak all the shadows and lighting and everything, a few pixels at a time. It sounds time-consuming but it can be pretty zen!"
mother4,3b9lwl,SOD03,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:02:41 2015 UTC,So couldn't the same thing be done with photoshop? I guess paint is just a free alternative.
mother4,3b9lwl,Popeye116,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:31:39 2015 UTC,"Well, the answer to that is ""why bother""? Paint's such an easy, lightweight program. The only thing Photoshop has for pixelwork that Paint doesn't are layers (which can be quite helpful but not necessary), and transparency. Also auto-save but an ingrained ctrl+s habit can replace that."
mother4,3b9lwl,Rockto_AP,2,Sat Jun 27 03:58:02 2015 UTC,"Layers are very helpful.  Photoshop has much more than Paint that could be useful even in simple pixel art.  Much more advanced selection tools, for example.  Even things like gradient maps that let you quickly try out other color schemes.  Also, the ability to record a deep history and switch back to any point in it with one button press.  It's definitely got significantly more power as a sprite editor.  But Paint works fine, too."
mother4,3b9lwl,CaptainCrisby,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:21:39 2015 UTC,Maybe Paint.NET could be a middle ground.

mother4,3b36xi,ImperioCrucioAvadaK,19,Thu Jun 25 16:26:31 2015 UTC,"No, it's fine. The caves aren't MAN-MADE objects so there's no way for them to conform to oblique projection, unless you want the caves to be as blocky as the buildings."
mother4,3b36xi,dillonEh,2,Thu Jun 25 18:39:27 2015 UTC,"That is actually a good point, honestly."
mother4,3b36xi,pik-mother4,15,Thu Jun 25 18:40:48 2015 UTC,"As always, thanks for noticing things like this. It keeps us on our toes!  Anyways, with the caveat that the game's perspective won't be perfect, I would actually make the case that this land formation was designed to be oblique. Since the cliff face isn't made of perfect boxes, the twists and bends of it have to be represented somehow - a task oblique projection isn't always the most efficient at. Hopefully the attached image makes things more clear. I drew in some perspective lines. http://i.imgur.com/YXmTFVL.png"
mother4,3b36xi,jamphat,4,Thu Jun 25 19:19:29 2015 UTC,this still seems odd
mother4,3b36xi,pik-mother4,6,Thu Jun 25 20:42:02 2015 UTC,"When a line is cast across two different elevations, parts of the line get displaced. I was representing the height difference between those two rocks. It's the same reason why the lines go vertical when they meet a rock wall, you know?"
mother4,3b36xi,jamphat,3,Thu Jun 25 20:56:22 2015 UTC,"the lines arent the issue, the weird sideways rock is what i was circling"
mother4,3b36xi,Bluestorm83,7,Thu Jun 25 21:07:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not involved with the game, but I DO have extensive experience with rocks (a pallet of cobblestone once stopped a car from driving over my leg a second time, and I can still walk!  Hooray!)  And sometimes rocks are weird and sideways."
mother4,3b36xi,jamphat,2,Thu Jun 25 22:00:34 2015 UTC,"if it actually looked sideways sure, but it just looks like the perspective in that area is different than the entire rest of the screen"
mother4,3b36xi,dillonEh,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:44:11 2015 UTC,"That cliff's slope just has a shallower angle than the others, which is completely normal and occurs everywhere in nature."
mother4,3b36xi,jamphat,0,Thu Jun 25 23:45:10 2015 UTC,"and if it happened anywhere else in the screenshot it wouldnt look odd, but every single other cliffside in the screenshot (and earthbound in its entirety?) is completely sheer (which in the context of a cave, incidentally, doesn't occur in nature)"
mother4,3b36xi,dillonEh,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:17:52 2015 UTC,"Is the problem the fact that it appears to be the only cliff that looks like that? Well, the cliff directly to the south of if it appears to be of that type, as is the one south of the railroad. And there's probably more visible ones elsewhere in the map that aren't in the screenshot."
mother4,3b36xi,Flowseidon9,2,Fri Jun 26 01:40:44 2015 UTC,If there's one thing structural geology taught me...it's that
mother4,3b36xi,flintconfirmed,2,Fri Jun 26 12:18:08 2015 UTC,Can confirm. I live with rocks and they act sideways and weird all the time.   Also that is absolutely amazing to hear cobblestone saved your legs. I feel your joy ethereally through your post.
mother4,3b36xi,eutrophic,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:39:59 2015 UTC,"Lmao, then how about just this? https://imgur.com/r9vfGLJ  Problem solved?"
mother4,3b36xi,eutrophic,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:56:29 2015 UTC,"From the way you have it, it doesn't look like the rock wall is farther down, it looks like it's pointing sideways TOWARDS the player.  Mother 4's perspective doesn't work that day. It has isometric perspective, not one point perspective. What you're trying to do would only work if objects foreshortened as they got farther away.  What's happening in the screenshot is you guys are basically breaking the game's perspective in an attempt to communicate distance, which doesn't make much sense, since the game's perspective doesn't work that way as it is.  http://img.tfd.com/cde/ISOMETRC.GIF  even if the rock is farther down, the diagonal angle in the screenshot is still slanted the exact same 45 degree-ish angle as rocks farther up, even though the rock is supposed to be deep below.  http://faa-engineers.com/~mjgundry/ductedfan/o-grid.png That's not common in nature. The angle is supposed to conform to a focal point as an object protrudes or recedes deeper in space.  If the rock was diagonally dragging to the right, it would make more sense, since the direction is changing and therefore the rock is revealing more of it's side. those in the image that's not the case, the diagonal orientation reveals that the rock is deeper downwards and is therefore foreshortening, though since everything in the game is isometric and therefore points towards a 45 degree angle, it just don't make sense.  It just looks odd. IMO"
mother4,3b36xi,FelixVicis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:11:40 2015 UTC,"A friend and I spent quite a few minutes discussing just what might be off. I personally think its okay, he argues that the perspective is off because there is nothing in the picture to focus on other than the tracks. Perhaps if there was a character or train it would seem less strange."
mother4,3b36xi,AwkwardPSI,6,Sat Jun 27 04:57:40 2015 UTC,"I think I see what you mean. From the screenshot's perspective, it looks like we're looking directly down to the world, but the train tracks look like they're running diagonally instead of straight to the left and right. It's probably more noticeable here with the camera pulled so far back; the camera will probably be way more zoomed in than this, and that'll make things like this a bit less prominent. It still looks a little strange, though."
mother4,3b36xi,AssCrackBanditHunter,2,Thu Jun 25 16:31:02 2015 UTC,"yeah, and unfortunately there's no real way to fix it because the camera is likely going to be panning. So if they tried to fix it by shifting the perspective of the planks... it would only look right at one specific camera position."
mother4,3b36xi,flintconfirmed,6,Thu Jun 25 16:56:40 2015 UTC,"technically since they're going ""more or less mother 3 style"" they could go with how m3 did train tracks as inspiration rather than the oblique view used in m1 and m2. it's not a really big deal though.  i like them."
mother4,3b36xi,Sexylisk,4,Thu Jun 25 17:29:33 2015 UTC,Looks fine to me.
mother4,3b36xi,tasteface,3,Thu Jun 25 17:27:29 2015 UTC,Oh my god they will never make the game if they have to respond to every nitpicky reddit post.  The true difference between a studio developed game and a fan developed game. The studio peeps know enough/have enough oversight that they know when things are shitty and need fixing. The amateurs end up wasting their lives on an endless loop always wondering if it's good enough and oh my god I need to defend decision X.  The best thing that could happen to Mother 4 right now is if it hired a few more people to fill slots and then shut itself off from the public until the game was basically done.  Do you guys remember how Mother 3 was basically a complete surprise to everyone? Itoi didn't talk about it until it was basically finished.

mother4,3b36xi,kylezo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:37:47 2015 UTC,"Most artists starting out have a portfolio made up of whatever work they have. None of it is necessarily from jobs, most of it is school projects, hobbies, etc. That doesn't make this a job or internship, and they certainly aren't hiring since this is all actionable under copyright laws anyways.

mother4,3b3bya,flabbergastedghastly,19,Thu Jun 25 17:03:29 2015 UTC,"EDIT: wall of text, TL;DR: Have Mother name and Mother fans, can't take money. Have money, can't call it Mother, lose a percentage of Mother series fans that would potentially play it.   The problem is self-cycling. If they take money, theres heaps of legal troubles and red ink letters for calling it Mother 4. They're making the game M4 because they love the Mother series. Fans of the Mother series would get behind and play Mother 4. They want Mother 4, now. They change the name to (just an example) Modernist, now they can take donations AND sell it, and they change the assets of the game to reflect that, but now the fanbase isn't right behind it, because the best they can do is put in the liner notes ""A game truly inspired by the Mother series."" and it is not a Mother game anymore. I've followed this project for years! I've seen thousands of posts that are frustrated with how the project is going. They wanted to make M O T H E R 4, and they didn't care to get paid, but to push the experience forwards, fairly selflessly, to the fans. It is a game explicitly by fans and explicitly for fans. I posit that (prices uninvolved,) more people will play Mother 4 when it is released than people will have bought Lisa or Citizens of Earth, both games that hang their hat on ""a game heavily inspired by the Mother series."" There has been a bailout plan in the panic bay of the Mother 4 development, that in the case of any cease-and-desists or copyright litigation, the team has a whole set of original assets that would change Mother 4 from a free fan game into a (maybe?) paid new IP that bears influence. That's just what it is, though: a backup plan, an emergency. The team wants to make Mother 4, and they're going to do it, for free, and all they really asked for is more time. They're making the game essentially JUST for us fans, but they have no obligation to do so!"

mother4,3b3bya,Hostar,3,Sun Jun 28 16:27:16 2015 UTC,"I understand that the team are completely doing this for free and I completely respect and honor that.    Well to be fair, they can't legally charge money for the game because they are illegally using an intellectual property they do not own. Mother 4 is the video game equivalent of a fan fiction, and as such, they may not make money off of an established franchise they had no hand whatsoever in creating."

You submit or are submitted by agent/agency, 80% of the time you never hear back, 20% you are asked to audition (you have no idea if/when you'll hear). Then you audition, you either hear nothing or you get called back. This happens about 3 or 4 times per project - go into room, throw heart on the floor, pick up heart, forget it ever happened cuz you have no idea if you'll hear back either way.

Agree to disagree, but I find it incredibly interesting and I also think that the entire point of the Mother series is to encourage people to make changes like this in their lives, even when, at times, it feels like it is too late, and that the circumstances are out of your control. Or it feels like a lost cause, or a problem too big to even know where to start... well, Shane just started. Hopefully, he can level up on responses yours and tt64's and find a few good party members on his journey that can help him when it gets really hard, but I just have so much trouble understanding how so many fans of such a heartfelt game can lack what I consider to be basic empathy.   Emotionally unstable? No Crying? He is trying to change who he is because he doesn't like what he see's in the mirror. And he is telling the world all of his failings. That is about as courageous and noble an endeavor as any human can take (if it is sincere). There will be a LOT of crying an emotional instability if he has any hope of success in his attempt to change. I hope he finds the strength to follow through and much more encouragement from his friends and fans than I have seen in some of the comments here. And I hope that if you ever find yourself in a position like Shane is in now, that a stranger shows you truly altruistic kindness, expecting nothing in return, and you can look back to your opinion now and feel a tinge of shame as you experience it from a different perspective."
mother4,3aynjl,shoddyradio,5,Tue Jun 30 09:56:49 2015 UTC,I just felt the fanbase should've read this.
mother4,3aynjl,tt64,-12,Thu Jun 25 01:41:23 2015 UTC,"The next time you ""feel"" something, try writing it in your diary, as opposed to inconveniencing strangers on the internet with irrelevant, emotional nonsense. Thanks!"
mother4,3aynjl,shoddyradio,4,Fri Jun 26 01:40:48 2015 UTC,"WOW!!!! How can a fan of Earthbound so tersely dismiss such a heartfelt cry for help!!! This is a human who has recognized that he doesn't like what he has become, deciding to publicly admit many of his mistakes and regrets, then vowing to reform and start anew, and your analysis is a sneering ""irrelevant, emotional nonsense""?   This is exactly what makes the Mother series so unique and amazing! It captures feelings like this. People struggling and deciding not to give up. I would expect a comment like this in almost every other corner of the internet, but I am surprised to see it in a small community like this, devoted to a very sincere game.  And as for ""inconveniencing"" strangers... You made the choice to read and respond to this. By your logic, anything ever posted on the internet by anyone, about a subject that you pay attention to, that you do NOT find interesting or relevant, is inconvenient to you (which of course is absurd).   I find this post to be incredibly relevant, and would have never seen it, or known about Shane's struggle if it weren't posted here, so I would say to you, don't assume your opinion is that of the masses or that it is any more relevant than anyone else's. I am not saying you are wrong for not caring about this (though I do find it surprising, as I am assuming you are a fan of the Mother series), but I am saying that telling OP not to post it because it inconvenienced this community is ridiculous. I was captivated by the post, and even wondered if it was some sort of meta reference related to the story in Mother 4 that I didn't understand yet, but would appreciate later once the game had been released. But once I really believed it was an earnest appeal, it made me want to reach out to Shane and encourage him to follow through.   In my opinion, you might want to re-read the entire post and consider if part of the reason that you had such a negative reaction to some of the things Shane is talking about, is because you are struggling with similar issues in your own life (not liking what you've become, corrupting your heart etc)."
mother4,3aynjl,Ghostmasks,2,Tue Jun 30 09:30:47 2015 UTC,"Fans like you in the Mother community make me very proud of it. And I think that you are spot-on about a lot of what makes the Mother/Earthbound series so great: heart. Heaps and heaps of humanly flawed, but compassionate and real, heart.  Regarding Shane's post: I do find this relevant to Mother 4. He is, afterall, one of the ones responsible for the shivers of excitement and familiarity we can get in advance through Mother 4 content releases. Not only did he relate the post to Mother 4, but he also is currently working on it. His reflection on his work, and even his sentiments between the lines, is pretty connected to the game."
mother4,3aynjl,Rockto_AP,3,Thu Jul 2 19:02:39 2015 UTC,"it's not nonsense, you should actually try to be more... for lack of a better word, compassionate... read /u/shoddtradio 's post, it explains it all basically"

mother4,3aynjl,vince94_1,4,Thu Jun 25 01:51:10 2015 UTC,"I also grew up with lots of bullying, and especially after finishing elementary school, indifference towards me in general. Like, people didn't used to talk to me at all, at lunch, in class, wherever. Well, these past few years at college, I've been gradually getting more confident, better at approaching people by myself (what I didn't even think of doing before), and keeping conversations going.   My situation's probably very different than what you've had to go through, but I just want to say that people can change for the better, and you shouldn't care about people who put you or us (the fans) down."

I've had to move constantly, so I didn't keep many friendships that long... At this moment, I don't care about M4, I only care about the internal struggle in all of us that makes us do crap like this! What I'm trying to say is: I don't care about the past anymore, I've been forced to live that way, I only care about the present and what you're gonna do now... be a good person https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWWlRKyYdgs it is over..."

I've been feeling so bad for him, I grew up being bullied as well and I was constantly called a nerd all throughout elementary school, but there was always something new that I could be happy about everyday, and I guess that's how I managed. And even now I have to say that I'm pretty socially awkward as well, and it's left me with a lot of failed friendships. So I guess to put it in short: I feel for Shane, and I hope we the fans can show appreciation for his work in the next few months when the game comes out!"

Looking at your post history, you're rude to a point where your insults calling people children and retards have truthfully no meaning anymore. You're passive aggressive as heck (which is becoming an aggravatingly common source of mood-kill by now). And you feel the need to make everyone feel like shit for every, little, thing. Not to mention resorting to offensive things abortion. I cannot even take half the stuff you say seriously by this point, you act like the Middle/High School bully nobody wants to talk to because it is always about how ""dumb"", ""annoying"", and ""cute"" they are, no matter what it is. No to mention you decided to look at Zane's post and instantly call him emo and everyone is jerking off to him. It was emotional, okay, and I felt people should read it, especially when he TALKS TO THE MOTHER 4 FANBASE IN THE FREAKING POST. And no, people don't downvote you for your opinion, they down-vote you for your antagonistic personality and attacks upon everyone."

mother4,3au0fg,tt64,18,Tue Jun 23 14:30:44 2015 UTC,"If I understand correctly, ""The Fundamental Problem with Mother 4"" is that since the team can't receive any money, they are not pressured enough to ""complete the game or show meaningful progress towards its completion"". You also use LISA as an example of how a developer could release a game in a timely manner since it was backed, and mention that the decision of making a Mother 4 instead of a game that has influence from the series (and thus being able to receive money from it) was regrettable.  This is an interesting point of view. However, we first must analyze if this is the real problem with the development of the game.  This is the update you mentioned which you say ""highlights a fundamental flaw of the game's development"" and then proceed to explain that the flaw is that the team can't recieve money from it and thus they are not as pressured as they would be otherwise... Nonetheless, that is a fallacy. Let me quote the post here:    Mother 4 is facing significant development challenges. We can’t work fast enough. Despite our best efforts, we can’t complete the game by June. We always prioritize quality over speed. We throw away NPCs. We scrap songs. We redesign the UI until it’s right. We add more content. Work and create, change and edit, toss and delete. Start again. That has been our process and will be until the game is ready.   While the post does indeed highlight a ""fundamental flaw"" in the development, it is not the fact that they are not pressured enough because they are not receiving any money. The reason the game has not been completed yet, ""The real Fundamental Problem with Mother 4"", is that the Mother 4 team are perfectionists. They are not slacking, and I am pretty sure they are feeling pressured about the development. They want to make the best game they can, and that's admirable. They make something, and then wonder ""Is this really the best we can do?"" and then they start over until it's just right, and that's the reason this game is taking this long to finish. Being perfectionist implies taking your time to make things as close as ""perfect"" as possible, even if that takes you one week, one month, or five years. And the reason they are being so perfectionist about the development is that they really want to please the people that have waited for the game for so long, the Mother series' fans, which also includes the team itself. Yes, the path the developers have choosen of making a ""sequel"" rather than a new series altogether wasn't the easiest one, but it is the one they wanted to take.   The team has gone through so many changes as years passed, and I'm really impressed with how the project has evolved as it is today. The game went from being made with RPG Maker, to Game Maker, then to a custom engine in C++ and now it is being made with C#. The art side of the project has also evolved, as well as the music part. This translates into even more work and time spent into the game.  I said earlier that being perfectionists was the ""Fundamental Problem with Mother 4"" because for some people it really is a problem, since it means waiting a lot more, however for me at least this means something else: That they really care about the game and their fans. They really want to make something that fulfills the expectatives people have for their game. All of the information, screenshots and videos they released so far were not released with the malicious mindset of ""We have this and you don't deserve to play it yet"" or with the intention of disappointing people but rather ""This is a little taste of what we have done so far, what do you think?"" and ""We are still alive, don't lose hope!"". Imagine if they had never released any media of the game in its current state: People would not even believe it still exists! (The project has existed for 5 years, but only for 2 years in it's current form.)  It's understandable for some people to be upset for missed deadlines, but in the good side more time means a more polished game, and who knows how shiny Mother 4 will be once it is released. I am really grateful for what the developers have done so far. The screenshots and videos look really appealing, and I would say they have done a really good job at making the game look like a true sequel to the Mother series so far, and they have done all that without receiving a single cent.   As spectators of the development and future players, all we have to do is wait for the game to be released so we can see how well those years of hard work have translated into it. I still have faith in this game, and hope the team uses its ""Fundamental Problem"" to make it the best game they can make and an unforgivable experience for all of us."
mother4,3au0fg,RisingCode,8,Tue Jun 23 20:23:02 2015 UTC,"I'd think it's a combination of them being perfectionists AND that there's no money involved.  See, if there were financial backing of some kind, then two things would be true. 1) They could work on the game full time, not just when reality doesn't have demands on them.  This would greatly cut down on development time. 2) Their patron could say ""No, this is good enough, work on something else and get it done.""  Even a Perfectionist has to live in reality.  I wrote a novel.  And re-wrote it again and again and again over seven years.  Then I lost half my hours at my day job (THANKS, OBAMA!!!) and reality made me say ""fuck it, it's good enough.  Publishing time.""  I want Mother 4 to be as good as possible, but I also want it to be DONE.  I can understand cutting an NPC or altering some dialogue, but the UI doesn't need to be scrapped or even reworked.  It's good enough.  And frankly, if we're not close enough to finished that 99% of things aren't ""Good enough,"" then we should never have been given ANY possible release dates.  As to the use od despicible or shameful, the OP was talking about the ACT of giving release dates and then coming nowhere near them.  Not the project, not the quality of the game, and not the moral rectitude of the creators themselves.  We've all been on the internet for long enough to know what Reddit is, this means that we've interacted with that one asshole who doesn't read for comprehension and then fumes and flames and erupts rage diarrhea all over a comments section.  Don't be that guy.  Edited just to say that the last part is a general exhortation, not directed to the person I was replying to."

mother4,3au0fg,jakeman77,-3,Sat Jun 27 22:44:49 2015 UTC,The problem is that reddit as a forum is inherently anti-discussion. Any dissenting opinion gets down voted until it is hidden. The circle jerk (especially on this particular subreddit) is very real.
mother4,3au0fg,MonkeyLawyer1,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:51:14 2015 UTC,"It may seem that way to you in particular, most likely due to the way you speak to people who disagree with you.   You are a pretentious, condescending dickbag. You may want to look at the way you phrase things and then re-evaluate your opinion."
mother4,3au0fg,AnjohnsPez,13,Fri Jul 3 00:23:35 2015 UTC,"Look, dude. Your misconception is that the M4 devs give a shit about money. This is a fan game. They know that they don't have the rights and that they aren't getting money for this job, yet they continue to make it. Why? Because they are passionate fans of the Mother games and want to share their ideas and story to the world. Money isn't the priority here. I appreciate you trying to spark discussion, but this is all shit we already know and have accepted. When you follow an unfunded fan game, it comes with the expectation of delay."
mother4,3au0fg,truetbh,3,Tue Jun 23 15:41:45 2015 UTC,That's not the point he's trying to make. All that he's pointing out is that without the incentive of money to complete this task then there may be a lack of a driving force for the dev team to meet the dates that they've been setting for themselves (which is a recurring theme with this project). Perhaps a more apt route would have been to give this project a new name and have the ties with the Mother series merely be in spirit.
mother4,3au0fg,AnjohnsPez,3,Tue Jun 23 15:47:13 2015 UTC,"If the game developers wanted to do that they could, but they wanted specifically to emulate the style of the mother series, you know? As in, like, they themselves have said numerous times that if they wanted to make the game their own unique thing they could, but they're intentionally sticking to the Mother franchise, which is what passions them or whatever  Because lemme tell you that if they tried to make a game very Mother-like but as their ""own thing"" (esp if they sold it) then I would get so tired of hearing ""they copied the Mother series!! this is so unoriginal!!!"" over and over and over"
mother4,3au0fg,truetbh,5,Tue Jun 23 18:43:18 2015 UTC,"Could happen yeah, I don't really see the type of people who are Mother fans being like that but I could see a lot of the general public having that sentiment. You can't have the best of both worlds. It's unfortunate but I think that it would have been better off as an inspired by Mother IP but that's just my opinion. I'm perfectly happy to wait for 4 cause I've just rediscovered this series and I'm playing Mother 3 again anyways."
mother4,3au0fg,MonkeyLawyer1,3,Tue Jun 23 19:10:02 2015 UTC,"well yeah, if mother 4 was its own thing the general public would be its audience"
mother4,3au0fg,ImperioCrucioAvadaK,0,Tue Jun 23 19:29:22 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't disagree. I think the fans would be fine if they called it something else and had a $5-$10 price tag. Maybe a patreon to help kick it along.
mother4,3au0fg,supersmashdude,-3,Tue Jun 23 15:52:28 2015 UTC,"Precisely. You put it better than I did. The point I was trying to make (and evidently failed to) is that an original title with heavy Mother influences would be a more logical route for both fans and the dev team themselves. And on top of that, the dev team would have an original game to to their name as opposed to a fan game (the way I see it, if you were an author, would you rather be known for a good, original novel or a good fanfic?)."
mother4,3au0fg,torterralover,2,Tue Jun 23 15:55:49 2015 UTC,"The problem here is the amount of influences, pretty much the whole thing is a Mother game, and no way to deny that. They could just get in trouble for copying instead of illegally making money. Besides, the goal from the start was to create a new Mother game."
mother4,3au0fg,Popeye116,2,Tue Jun 23 19:58:51 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong, but I think they're in too deep to change routes all of a sudden.   Yes, maybe doing an original IP that brings out what made Mother good is probably a better idea than a fan sequel. But that's something that should've been decided years ago-- That ship has sailed."
mother4,3au0fg,ArmoredChocobo,2,Fri Jun 26 01:34:01 2015 UTC,That's a good point but it might be a bit too late for that now
mother4,3au0fg,ArmoredChocobo,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:57:52 2015 UTC,"Well, that analogy doesn't make too much sense because this game wouldn't be very original. It's copying much of the aspects of the mother series (which is great, of course!)."
mother4,3au0fg,Popeye116,2,Tue Jun 23 21:24:36 2015 UTC,"I really don't see how their behavior has been shameful, much less despicable.  Do you feel let down? Disappointed? All they've done is shown off their game. Sorry if they got your hopes up; these are inevitable challenges of volunteer fan game development, and you should have known what you were getting into.  I don't disagree with your argument on releasing the game as a non-Mother game, though. I really want a Mother 4, but the money would help them out."
mother4,3au0fg,ArmoredChocobo,4,Wed Jun 24 03:07:41 2015 UTC,"So basically you're calling them lazy, despicable, and shameful for making a A+ quality game for free, but are taking too long for your tastes.  Okay.  You know there's other games out there, go play them for a while. The release will be here before you know it.  I'm having a ball re-playing New Vegas and Skyrim, and playing Hand of Fate while I wait to have my mind blown with Mother 4 goodness."
mother4,3au0fg,Popeye116,-6,Wed Jun 24 03:40:14 2015 UTC,"""A+ quality game""   Oh, so you've played it then? Because otherwise judging a game's overall quality as a game based on a couple screenshots and a trailer is... well, foolish."
mother4,3au0fg,ArmoredChocobo,2,Wed Jun 24 15:03:40 2015 UTC,"Hell of a lot better-looking and designed than 99% of the fan-games out there.  But of course we should shit on everything under the assumption that unless you've played it, it's automatically the worst thing ever."
mother4,3au0fg,Popeye116,0,Wed Jun 24 16:53:31 2015 UTC,"Hey, he isn't shitting on it. He never said it was a bad game. He just said not to assume a game is good because of a few screenshots and trailers. That's all he was saying. There's plenty of games that look amazing in trailers but in reality suck. Not saying Mother 4 is one of those; I think it's going to be an AMAZING game. But it's true that you can't judge things entirely based on trailers."
mother4,3au0fg,ImperioCrucioAvadaK,2,Wed Jun 24 18:21:07 2015 UTC,"But you are by saying you think the game is gonna be amazing, so you're already making an assumption off trailers."
mother4,3au0fg,ImperioCrucioAvadaK,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:50:42 2015 UTC,"Oh. Well, you got me there xP. That makes me sound pretty hypocritical, huh? What I was basically saying was, you can't tell for sure if a game will be good just because of trailers. You can think that it will be good, but you won't know for sure. That's what I was saying."
mother4,3au0fg,prismdancer,3,Wed Jun 24 22:29:11 2015 UTC,I think what we've seen so far is enough to at least have faith that it'll be a good game.  It'd hurt the team and the idea of Mother fangames in general if it fell short that badly.
mother4,3au0fg,flintconfirmed,0,Wed Jun 24 22:51:33 2015 UTC,Yup! I have faith that this game will be spectacular.

mother4,3au0fg,Kefkarjp,-3,Wed Jun 24 15:26:27 2015 UTC,"""So you also think the game is going to suck.""   I never said that I thought the game was going to suck (if I did, please show me where). I think the screenshots look great and very promising, but you haven't been playing games very long if you immediately assume that promising screenshots = A+ game. There are so many other aspects to a game's quality than its appearance in screenshots and trailers.   Please try to read more carefully in the future, I think you'll find it will enhance your overall reddit experience."

mother4,3au0fg,PieNinja314,3,Wed Jun 24 03:40:50 2015 UTC,i payed money for sealark and it's been in development longer than m4 and i still don't have it.
mother4,3au0fg,PieNinja314,0,Wed Jun 24 09:03:53 2015 UTC,Exactly.  Or ask all the guys that threw money at Overgrowth if they still have the game yet.
mother4,3au0fg,black_fractals,3,Wed Jun 24 22:53:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's kind of hard to motivate yourself to get something done on time when there aren't really any consequences to failing to meet that timeframe... Just speaking generally. I can't say I'm too upset about it though. I'm grateful that they're doing it for free and that they're willing to put all this time and effort into it. I mean, yeah, there are problems with doing it that way. Nothing's perfect. :P That Lisa game looks pretty cool, never heard of it."
mother4,3au0fg,Tration101,2,Wed Jun 24 16:15:53 2015 UTC,"You do...have a valid opinion. I think you should just stop with the sarcastic comments back at people...not trying to be rude, I just think it makes people see you as more of an antagonist to this game than you really are. I don't believe money influences or would influence the dev team at all, seeing as they put 5 years into this, for free. I guess by the time they'd even consider changing the franchise, they were already too deep into the ""Mother 4"" thing to not disappoint fans. I think a lot of people are happy to stay patient because hey, the devs are taking time out of their daily lives to attend to this game that they don't owe anyone. Most of then have really busy lives recently, and they are perfectionists so it's no wonder they're delaying it. Nevertheless, your opinion is an opinion and I can't get mad at you for your opinion. This is just my two cents, though."
mother4,3au0fg,Epic563,4,Sun Jun 28 19:29:56 2015 UTC,"Waaaah, Mother 4 is despicable because I can't play it yet! It's SO not fair!!!11 Hurry up devs, you are SO slow... OMG. Take a look at this game (Lisa) that looks like it was made in Flash... WHY CAN'T MOTHER 4 TEEM DO THIS????   I'm not really one to antagonize, but your points are very narrow-minded and self-serving. The Mother 4 team is a group of volunteers, who by trial and tribulation throughout the years, have not given up on the development of Mother 4. They are continuing to bolster their ranks to ensure that the game reaches completion, and have done nothing but provide content on their upcoming game to the public.  Also, no one is ""raising the hopes of the fans""; they are only promoting their game as any dev would do. The Mother 4 team will be done when they are done - simple as that. So what if they continue to say ""Hey we think we might have the game done by ____ date.""? AAA devs like Activision, Bethesda and Nintendo (and many others) post speculative release dates and end up pushing them back all of the time. Why is it OK for a dev who is developing a for-pay game to have delays, but not group of volunteers who are creating a completely free JRPG with hours of content and professional polish?"
mother4,3au0fg,ImperioCrucioAvadaK,-11,Tue Jun 23 14:54:28 2015 UTC,"That's a cute little straw man argument you have there, although I would advise that you participate in a more meaningful way if you want to be taken seriously.    ""The Mother 4 team is a group of volunteers""   Yes, but keep in mind they are forced into being volunteers because they are trying to make an entry into a series that is not their own, and that they have no legal right to make any money borrowing the name of a beloved franchise.   No one is ""raising the hopes of the fans""   So you don't think announcing release dates raises fans' hopes? I would disagree."
mother4,3au0fg,SageWaterDragon,8,Tue Jun 23 15:15:32 2015 UTC,forced into being volunteers   wat
mother4,3au0fg,ImperioCrucioAvadaK,-2,Tue Jun 23 15:29:36 2015 UTC,"Not forced as is ""they have to make this game"", but forced as in ""they have to be volunteers because they legally cannot accept money for their work on the project because they do not own the rights to the franchise they are trying to emulate""."
mother4,3au0fg,SageWaterDragon,4,Tue Jun 23 15:36:48 2015 UTC,"""they are forced into being volunteers""  Ok, seriously? You can't force someone to be a volunteer. The definition of a volunteer is 'a person who freely offers to take part in an enterprise or undertake a task.' Nobody in the Mother 4 team is forced to do anything, and they could stop at anytime if they wanted to.  ""they have no legal right to make any money borrowing the name of a beloved franchise.""  Actually, yes, they do. Nintendo allows other people to make fan games based on their properties as long as they don't make any money doing so. Even Itoi openly admitted that he would love to play a fan game based off of the Mother series if there is one."

Well, that’s pretty despicable/shameful no matter what way you cut it."" as being histrionic (and I agree), so I feel like that's why some people are having a negative reaction to your opinion  anyways, I honestly feel like there are reasons Mother 4 is a fangame and not its own thing, and also free and not for $:   Maybe the only thing motivating the developers is their desire to prolong the Mother franchise? Maybe if this was another game they wouldn't care? Maybe some people just feel less artistically inspired or more pressured and confined if they feel like they have to create a game that people are going to want to pay X amount of money for vs just play? Also like owning up to a fangame allows the developers to borrow as many elements from Mother as possible without being called ""plagiarizing"" or ""unoriginal"" or things like that, and the Mother series is their main inspiration and muse   P.S.

I'm sure there'll be nods to the previous games, but they'll be the kind of fourth-wall-breaking references we've come to expect. Not canon, if you know what I mean.  If you consider this is as a timeline of America though (where Mother took place in the 80s, Earthbound in the 90s) then I definitely think Mother 4 looks more modern. But Mother 3 is waaaay out there.  It would actually be really cool if the events of Mother and Earthbound were established history in Mother 4. References to some alien war would be neat."

mother4,3a8qbj,thomar,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:43:28 2015 UTC,"Mother 3 also was carefully paced so that as long as you explored new areas, you got more food than you needed and had to use it frequently. The game discouraged hoarding by making PSI better than food but harder to recover. This avoided the ""oh, this Super Elixir is way too good to use so I'll hoard it until the final boss"" problem.  Paper Mario did something very similar with food items, although this was at odds with its cooking system."
mother4,3a8qbj,PunchyG,4,Wed Jun 24 22:16:26 2015 UTC,Based on the AMA food makes you more or less likely to get a Groovy! or something like that. Bad foods make your meter go down but good foods make it go up?
mother4,3a8qbj,PunchyG,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:46:19 2015 UTC,"That sounds very cool. If that's the case, I'm hoping Groovy! is important enough to make food a necessity.  Also hoping that ""good food"" means using the right condiments. I'd hate to be punished for eating a burger, but I wouldn't mind being punished for putting cream on it.  EDIT: to clarify, I'm hoping that getting Groovy! will be necessary (or almost necessary) for succeeding in the game. I want food to be important!"
mother4,3a8qbj,tasos500,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:38:53 2015 UTC,Groovy! is an extra turn that you can get in battle. Meryl gets one in the gameplay trailer and gets to use PK Freeze again
mother4,3a8qbj,Lucas5655,2,Thu Jun 18 04:51:22 2015 UTC,I also heard something about characters being allergic to some food e.g Leo being lactose intolerant. But I'm not sure if that's true.
mother4,3a8qbj,AwkwardPSI,3,Thu Jun 18 14:16:17 2015 UTC,"That would be an awesome touch! A bit like how the Peculiar Cheese worked in Mother 3.. it would be great if every party member had their own preferences.  Also, it's just perfect that Leo is the one who's lactose intolerant. So macho."
mother4,3a8qbj,Ness6464,2,Thu Jun 18 16:07:15 2015 UTC,"I for one was thinking something along the lines of making PSI Lifeup cost a ton of PSI so that it really would be a last resort. Think like a third of your PP.  It'd also be cool if different food items gave different status buffs, or healed different status ailments, in addition to restoring health. Eating a burger, for example, might give you 1.25x Offense, while fries would boost your speed. Coffee would wake you up, and lemonade would cure sunstroke. The right condiments would amplify these effects."
mother4,3a8qbj,Ness6464,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:08:36 2015 UTC,I think food had some prominence within the Mother series besides the condiment thing which just kind of felt like a missed opportunity. Either way it would be cool to see them add more importance to food.
mother4,3a8qbj,noneed2bcruel,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:24:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, condiments were a pretty badly missed mechanic. Even when properly used, it wasn't worth it due to the not-so-huge increase in HP earned, the requirement for 2 slots to be taken up, and the fact that PSI Lifeup >>>>>>> food. I'd be fine with condiments coming back, if the bonus health you earn is really worth it and if using the condiments isn't as finicky."

mother4,3a68gx,Mother4Ever,2,Wed Jun 17 19:07:06 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking they're more like the Chimera platforms seen in Chapter 1 of Mother 3, i.e. technology left behind by the Modern Men during their early experiments."

Since its using sprites and not any advanced textures or anything like that, i dont think there will be much packed into the game that would cause it to be that big.  Think about it, this game will have sprites, sound/music files, some code stuff i think, and some other parameters that go into games, but noting that would exceed 1GB.  Mother 3 is a pretty large game as far as the map space, events, cut scenes and all that go and its only 15MB just to give you a ballpark range. Earthbound on the SNES is only 2.0 MB.  Since this ins't a rom and will be a standalone i'm gonna go for around maybe....500-700MB?(1000MB-1GB)"

Oh, and if Shane reveals something on twitch that he wasn't supposed to, you can put the blame on me not him, usually I'm the one who pushes him to say something (like Renee and others) Also, I assume that all that cut stuff is the reason you guys are looking for spriters/artists right?

mother4,39yy1d,Pk_King64,3,Tue Jun 16 00:43:14 2015 UTC,Wow. Quite a bit of stuff in here. Thanks Captain Crisby!
mother4,39yy1d,dudebro117,2,Tue Jun 16 00:12:03 2015 UTC,"No problem! It was my pleasure! I had a lot of fun looking into the development history of Mother 4. I really got to look inside the eyes of the devs, their struggles, their achievements, etc. But no matter what they always had an eye out to the fans, and had this confidence in the game. I still remember looking around the blog and stared in awe as I thought it was an official game! And because of that moment I went into game design!"
mother4,39yy1d,FruitPokemon,3,Tue Jun 16 00:48:24 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is very thorough indeed and gives us quite some insight into the project and everyone that helped.  Sadly many games don't document their development or at least they don't preserve the majority of the discarded or changed details, and some of these things are lost forever or will never be heard of, so I'm very glad you decided to make this Preserve Project!  I usually search for such after playing a certain game that I've come to love and appreciate, as discovering the parallels to the final product you know feels awesome. Or hearing about something that looked like a nice concept to have at/for a particular part of the game, and how it would have changed it.  In this case though, since it is a tribute to the Mother series, there's a discovery process when going through these files without having played it yet, and it just further builds the anticipation for Mother 4.  Makes me help appreciate the teams work and the recognize the scale it takes even more."
mother4,39yy1d,FruitPokemon,3,Tue Jun 16 03:32:45 2015 UTC,"This is impressive. Good job. I really mean that. This must've taken forever to do, but the dedication is amazing. With everyone doing things like this it really shows how supporting this community is."
mother4,39yy1d,adamnoodles,3,Tue Jun 16 04:23:13 2015 UTC,"Cool stuff! Now to fill in your feedback   About 2013. Nope, only the soundcloud album I downloaded into iTunes about a year ago. (Fun fact: one of the songs, I think it's one of the ones that begins with ""Battle Against,"" has weird album art attached as an ID3 tag to the sound file. It credits the Snobodys.) Solid red can be a little weird, but it's nothing bad. I don't think there can be any color palette better than what you have."

I didn't want the document to look all ""vanilla"" as I like to call it, so I took some creative liberties and made in the style of traditional Mother 4/Mother 3 style. Hopefully I didn't burn anyone's eyes out with that dark red and white combo though!"
mother4,39yy1d,DoNotKnow1953,2,Tue Jun 16 21:25:33 2015 UTC,"Oh, wow! That's actually a lot of information. I'll answer your questions, too!  I've only been following Mother 4 for a few months, I think. And I don't know if it's what you're looking for, but there's a video with the old level up jingles and all the possible combinations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj7yUKgo7cQ  I did find the document aesthetically pleasing! But I'm not very picky when it comes to that kind of thing, so I'm not sure my opinion counts."
mother4,39yy1d,Rockto_AP,3,Tue Jun 16 00:53:23 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, I saw that video! I think the closest we can get to is this Scratch project, which includes all the frames from the video: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/27899190/ I'll try and contact the user and see if he has it, and maybe we'll be lucky!  I assume you joined because of Omni's Smashified right? Or did you see the trailer? I always take intro account any suggestions or criticisms, even if someone doesn't care, thank you!"
mother4,39yy1d,Rockto_AP,2,Tue Jun 16 01:07:44 2015 UTC,"I think found it when I was using Google. I typed 'Mother' and 'Mother 4' appeared, so I went ahead and searched it."

They're not gonna hype it up, acknowledge it or make it cannon.

Not the kind of guy that fits in a Mother game. Leo's a rebel, but that's because street life is tough. He isn't robbing people with his psychic powers, but you wouldn't want to get into a fight with him, either.....unless it's a dance fight.   cue West Side Story dance music  Unless he's a villain, I dunno.  I'm not a big fan of the ""allergy"" idea either. I don't want to be limited, and I have no idea how wide-spread the problems it makes will be. Seems like if you're gonna have an allergy element, it better be obvious from the start so I don't accidentally feed someone with a peanut allergy a peanut product and end up poisoning them during a boss fight (Poison? Really?).   and let's not forget the elephant in the room of ""Why would they consciously eat something they know they're allergic to, anyway?"""

While there's a lot of people out there that would happy with this change, I'd be disappointed because I've always liked to pretend that Mother 4 is an official successor.

I don't think so. Itoi certainly does realize that it is a beloved franchise, but I feel that he'll probably stick by his word of ""there won't be a Mother 4 (officially)."""
mother4,39umt6,TorchicBlaziken,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:07:42 2015 UTC,They will do like Project M (and the MOTHER 3 translation) and not acknowledge it. For one because it would give away that they have plans for the series. Also because they know it would alienate the fanbase.
mother4,39umt6,SpaghettiLettuce,0,Sun Jun 21 22:10:05 2015 UTC,"By far the idea of Nintendo actually considering a fan-made game to be canon is outrageous and unlikely, but is still possible. Itoi said himself he doesn't want to make a Mother 4, BUT he did say he wanted to be the player of Mother 4. If there was a development team to make it he would gladly accept it, but he most likely was exaggerating. Admitting that he would enjoy being the player gives one thing at hand, Itoi will most likely play Mother 4 and acknowledge it. It would be near impossible for him to actually consider getting Mother 4 to be approved by Nintendo and sent to Wii U/3DS as it would be already on PC for free. At least thanking the Mother 4 team for making the game would be enough for me."
mother4,39t92d,luckjes112,13,Sun Jun 14 15:34:36 2015 UTC,"No, they haven't, and that's for the best. Any acknowledgement would be in the form of a C&D."

mother4,39h64q,macro-cosmos,2,Thu Jun 11 18:09:21 2015 UTC,this may have a spoiler but if anyone remembers earthbound if you are on the start menu for a certain amount of time it looks exactly like the attract mode ( this is possibly part of the title screen)
mother4,39h64q,mrpsidude,2,Fri Jun 12 14:00:28 2015 UTC,"Oh, agreed, Mother 4's attract mode has undeniably been influenced by EarthBound's. All it needs are rolling credits! And nah, that ain't a spoiler. I mean, it happens literally before the start menu :-D"

I've stopped asking about release dates because of this, because they even stated in the above article that they know they're bad with them.  So for now, and until the game's proper release date, I'm gonna chill."
mother4,39lx59,singleserved,0,Sat Jun 13 03:31:36 2015 UTC,Release Date; TBA (most likely not coming out at all)   Was supposed to be Winter 2014 and then summer 2015. Haha delays after delays. I've given up hope...

That's my final damn opinion on the matter. No reason to become so hostile by telling someone that they don't want you here. I know people don't want me. I never thought some earthbound fans would straight up tell me they don't want me here.   Now have a good day sir.
mother4,39lx59,Funnypenguin97,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:39:18 2015 UTC,"This project isn't dead. Are you actually blind, they updated us on what is happening, they are trying to make it as perfect as possible and don't want to lie to us again about a release date so they aren't setting one right now. Did you not see the new game play? This project isn't dead, far from it. You just don't care enough."
mother4,39ehgi,CaptainCrisby,21,Thu Jun 11 04:53:48 2015 UTC,Did... did Leo just light a cigarette with PSI? Brilliant.
mother4,39ehgi,Dancing_Anatolia,22,Thu Jun 11 06:38:58 2015 UTC,Holy cow! The game looks amazing! The way Leo lights his cigarrete with PK Fire... Nice touch.
mother4,39ehgi,RisingCode,4,Thu Jun 11 04:56:13 2015 UTC,"I'm so happy to see Leo smoking. I feel like smoking gets such a bad rap, but smokers aren't all bad dudes! You guys are beautiful.   It reminds me of the old Studio Ghibli (Laputa represent!) days where smoking was just a side happening and nobody made a big deal about it.   Edit: I'll take the down votes. Smoking is bad, and you shouldn't smoke. Tobacco kills."
mother4,39ehgi,flintconfirmed,33,Thu Jun 11 08:05:07 2015 UTC,"Smoking gets a bad wrap because it's awful for you in every possible way. Nothing against the people who do smoke, just the act is really bad for your health. Leo, however, is too cool to get cancer and heart disease, so he doesn't have to worry about it. Unfortunately, none of us are as cool as Leo."

mother4,39ehgi,Naoyatodo,8,Wed Jun 17 16:57:40 2015 UTC,So this is like when you leave the game running on the title screen for a while and then it switches to this right?
mother4,39ehgi,Animegame97,4,Thu Jun 11 05:15:17 2015 UTC,It looks very similar to what happens when this is done in EarthBound so I'd say yes. It was also one of those videos you see on TVs in Gamestop.
mother4,39ehgi,nat_noah,6,Thu Jun 11 05:18:22 2015 UTC,Travis talks while you control him! That's a first for the MOTHER series.
mother4,39ehgi,somekirbyguy,6,Thu Jun 11 04:58:01 2015 UTC,"He probably won't have any dialogue, just appear to be talking."
mother4,39ehgi,FerricNight,2,Thu Jun 11 11:09:44 2015 UTC,"This. Most RPG protagonists are silent, but the conversations that players have with NPCs are oftentimes structured as if the protagonist started the conversation."
mother4,39ehgi,dillonEh,-19,Thu Jun 11 12:52:23 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't really call this a MOTHER series game, honestly. It looks like the charms has all but shifted left.  e: I'm sorry that my opinion on a fangame not having the same charm as the official games isn't the same opinion you all share."
mother4,39ehgi,hotcereal,7,Thu Jun 11 06:50:54 2015 UTC,"You realize that Lucas talks in Mother 3... right? He may not do it while in your party, but he actually has many lines of text, unlike Ness and Ninten.  Any game series is about evolving and coming up with fresh ideas in the sequels, while retaining the charm that makes the series unique. The Mother 4 team, so far, has shown that this game has all of the charms of its predecessors, while also showing progress to keep the fanbase engaged.  Also, compare each of the Mother games against each other and you will see many differences in tone and theme among all three. Aside from graphic and music style, the battle system, and the humor, what do Earthbound and Mother 3 even have in common? Really not a lot. Mother 4 may be a step in a new direction, but seeing as we are not going to ever get an official sequel from Itoi, this seems to be the best shot we have at a game worthy of the 'Mother' title."
mother4,39ehgi,pr0jectpat,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:15:44 2015 UTC,"Travis talking was probably only part of the Attract Mode. It's unlikely he'll actually do that in game (when he's leading the party, at least)."
mother4,39ehgi,Naoyatodo,2,Wed Jun 17 16:59:14 2015 UTC,Care to elaborate?
mother4,39ehgi,dillonEh,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:01:30 2015 UTC,"It's not so much that, as your post implies this one little change means that its not a MOTHER game anymore."
mother4,39ehgi,Kipzz,-3,Thu Jun 11 12:05:40 2015 UTC,It was never a MOTHER game. It's a fangame that looks like MOTHER using the MOTHER name.
mother4,39ehgi,hotcereal,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:57:49 2015 UTC,"Mother 3 didn't actually have a lot of charm.  It was a dark and very linear game overall.  Mother 4 to me looks a lot like earthbound.  Very bright, looks to be free roaming and maxed out on a charming atmosphere.  Pretty damn excited."
mother4,39ehgi,Kogyochi,3,Thu Jun 11 14:07:32 2015 UTC,Charm isn't restrictive to being happy go lucky. It was the subtleties in the game designer that you see present throughout the entire series that captured the charm found in the game.
mother4,39ehgi,hotcereal,-3,Thu Jun 11 15:33:27 2015 UTC,I just wasn't feeling it in 3.  Was hard to get over the fact that you're chasing down your brother for murdering your mom.
mother4,39ehgi,Kogyochi,7,Thu Jun 11 15:36:52 2015 UTC,That's not how their mother dies...? I don't even think it's hinted at that Claus killed her but rather that he goes missing and the entire family is trying to find him.
mother4,39ehgi,hotcereal,0,Thu Jun 11 15:43:51 2015 UTC,Was it the brainwashed dinosaurs that killed her and then Clause was kidnapped?  I know after he went missing is when the world started going to shit until you kill him at the end.
mother4,39ehgi,Kogyochi,5,Thu Jun 11 17:22:38 2015 UTC,"It was a Mecha Drago, yeah. But the world only slowly started going to shit because Fassad introduced both TV and currency (in lieu of other things) and then it's implied that Claus kills himself after the final battle."
mother4,39ehgi,hotcereal,6,Thu Jun 11 17:43:56 2015 UTC,"so uh, how about taggin' those spoilers for people who haven't played those games?"
mother4,39ehgi,hecticforest,0,Thu Jun 11 17:52:46 2015 UTC,How would anyone be in this subreddit having not played MOTHER 3?
mother4,39ehgi,hotcereal,3,Thu Jun 11 18:07:59 2015 UTC,"Around the 0:52 mark, you can see that they brought back the unused bear enemy from MOTHER 3. Or it looks verrry similar at least."
mother4,39ehgi,somekirbyguy,11,Thu Jun 11 05:06:33 2015 UTC,You mean BEAR-y similar? :D (I'm so sorry)

Hopefully nothing bad happens with these crosses, even though I doubt anything will."
mother4,39ffoh,Ness6464,3,Fri Jun 12 07:56:13 2015 UTC,"Still funny, because they left them on the Earthbound box art and left them in at Burglin Park and inside Dungeon Man. Also, my favorite oversight, DRUGS."

mother4,39ea41,nat_noah,6,Thu Jun 11 04:01:29 2015 UTC,@Mother4Game:   2015-06-11 04:00:14 UTC  Thank you to the hundreds of people that emailed about joining the team. We’ll be going through each application over the next two weeks.     [Mistake?] [Suggestion] [FAQ] [Code] [Issues]
mother4,39d4ep,Captain025,5,Wed Jun 10 23:29:03 2015 UTC,:) That was actually rather sweet. Well said.
mother4,39d4ep,FelixVicis,3,Wed Jun 10 23:47:01 2015 UTC,Don't Be Nervous You Can Do It
mother4,39erdh,KayShyGuy,8,Thu Jun 11 06:15:01 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine everyone that applied will be getting positions. Realistically speaking, I can see half a dozen out of each position getting selected at best. But the nice thing is, that many applications means the team has a lot of potential to choose from!  EDIT: As a side note, now that we know when applications will be responded to, I think I can stop checking the reddit and my emails every break at work. Whew."
mother4,39erdh,XeniKobalt,3,Thu Jun 11 06:26:03 2015 UTC,"As I said before, I hope it's the people who are most qualified for the position they want. It may be a fan game but you need experience to make something like this where our expectations are high. Good luck to those who applied."
mother4,39erdh,MotherFan,2,Thu Jun 11 10:07:31 2015 UTC,"I really hope everyone is on the same level, with all these new team members coming in."
mother4,39erdh,PlugM515,2,Thu Jun 11 16:50:05 2015 UTC,"Wow that's alot!   don't lie, alot is only one entity.   proof."
mother4,39eedt,mrthatguy21,10,Thu Jun 11 04:31:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's very interesting but also kind of sad in a way. I'll wait for however long they need, because in the end, it's just a video game. If it gets delayed, okay. If it get's canceled, okay. It's too bad, but that's life.   I know some people feel like they were lied to, and that's understandable as well. I do wish they wouldn't complain so much though, it really puts me in a bad mood to visit this subreddit and see a bunch of complaints. This game looks cool, and when (or if) it eventually comes out I'm sure I'll enjoy it.  The only thing I really can't stand is people getting mad at others for... not complaining? For example, I'll stick with this game no matter how long it takes. What's wrong with that? Maybe I do get tired of seeing others complaining, but there's still nothing wrong with it. I'm not an 'extreme loyalist' or whatever. A common argument is that this game is free, and the people who complain have done nothing to deserve to play it. And that is true. It's also true that the MOTHER 4 team failed to meet their deadlines, which is disappointing. But look... this is a game. You're on Reddit, talking about a fangame. Is it really so important to you that you have to be a jerk about it? ...I'm not talking to you directly, mrthatguy21, sorry about all that :P  ...Wow, that was a long post. Sorry about that. I just got over the worst writer's block and all day I've been using three words when just one will do..."
mother4,39eedt,FruitPokemon,5,Thu Jun 11 04:44:43 2015 UTC,"Don't be sorry, that was a beautiful post"
mother4,39eedt,FruitPokemon,7,Thu Jun 11 04:50:48 2015 UTC,"Oh, really? Well, thanks. That's like, my third post on Reddit. I'm really shy."
mother4,39eedt,FruitPokemon,0,Thu Jun 11 04:52:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, yes. Like I said, it's perfectly understandable that people complain. After all, the team missed their deadlines, and that's very disappointing. I agree that they should take it easy and not give such specific dates until they're really ready. But the same complaints over and over get annoying, and then the people who are complaining get mad at the people who tell them to stop, and then everybody's angry and that's no fun. The idea of this game makes me happy, and seeing other people discuss and contribute here is even better, so it makes me sad when people argue."
mother4,39eedt,Rockto_AP,2,Thu Jun 11 18:17:49 2015 UTC,"to be honest, if it's not out by 2016, I'm gonna give up on it..."
mother4,39eedt,FruitPokemon,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:01:06 2015 UTC,"Mhm. I might not ""give up"" exactly, but after a while I'm sure I'll lose interest and stop following the game's progress... especially if it takes that long. I guess that does count as giving up? I dunno. I'd probably still get excited if I hear it comes out. But I have faith in them!"
mother4,39eedt,Rockto_AP,2,Mon Jun 15 01:56:49 2015 UTC,"that's what I meant by give up. Also, I might stop the M4 guide I'm making with the guide team"
mother4,39eedt,kylezo,4,Tue Jun 16 00:57:33 2015 UTC,"I remember all the hype and delays surrounding EBZ  port, then M3 fan translation...I have waited forever several times and ill do it again. Those other projects never really had transparency or deadlines so we are totally spoiled this time. Plus this is a WHOLE GAME! WOO.  For christ's sake, for someone like me, this goes all the way back to EB64 in the 90's. I remember reading about it in my Nintendo power issue and I went back to that spread so many times over the years, making sure I didn't misread it. It's a way of life for a EB fan."

mother4,39dudv,PunchyG,6,Thu Jun 11 04:58:21 2015 UTC,You should've waited until Thursday to say this...
mother4,39dudv,Dancing_Anatolia,9,Thu Jun 11 05:02:58 2015 UTC,Maybe it was delayed until Winter 2015. I hope everything is okay.
mother4,39dudv,Ness6464,3,Thu Jun 11 03:15:41 2015 UTC,Here's hoping they do it in the next 30 minutes.
mother4,39dudv,Lucas5655,5,Thu Jun 11 04:33:23 2015 UTC,They must've missed the deadline.
mother4,39dudv,Popeye116,2,Thu Jun 11 03:07:52 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, I'm not shocked. The mother 4 team isn't too good with deadlines...  But maybe we're wrong and they'll release it in the remaining 1.5 hours of the day."
mother4,39dudv,Destro_,3,Thu Jun 11 03:36:18 2015 UTC,"There was supposed to be an update today but it appears that they didn't follow through. Mother 4 team, we love you. We understand that things aren't going as quickly as you want them to. Take as much time as you need. But please realize that you have thousands of fans waiting for this game and the more dates you give and fail to deliver, the more disappointed we become. Please, please follow through with things you promise from now on. You don't owe us anything, but if you care enough about your fans, it would be nice if you could at least try and stick to the things that you've said."
mother4,39dudv,qwertoman,3,Thu Jun 11 04:19:12 2015 UTC,"Now this, this is unacceptable. Deadline after deadline has been missed, and when they finally promise more transparency with biweekly updates they fail to meet even the smallest 'deadline'. Don't get me wrong, I am extremely thankful for the team's efforts and I'm super excited to play the finished game, but things like this make me question their reliability. The way things have been handled seem very unprofessional and unfair to the VERY loyal fans awaiting this game.  The Mother 4 Team is incredibly lucky to have such good fans who, despite all these mistakes, continue to support and have confidence in them. They have made some mistakes, but we all forgive them. I realize this is made by fans who have normal busy lives and nobody truly deserves their hard work, but they can't keep promising things without following through. It's time they are held accountable and their priorities set straight.  Edit: I hope I didn't sound too angry, I just needed to say something. I have confidence that whatever happens, the M4 team will pull through!"
mother4,39dudv,kylezo,3,Thu Jun 11 03:49:16 2015 UTC,"""This is unacceptable""  -qwertoman"
mother4,39dudv,XeniKobalt,3,Thu Jun 11 06:52:30 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that the entire game is a labour of love and is being done at the free will (emphasis on free) of its staff. Yes, it will be unfortunate if we aren't shown the update that we were expecting today, but you also need to take into consideration that these people have lives of their own to maintain, and that priorities exist outside of hobbies.  Also, with regards to your edit, starting your sentence off with ""This is unacceptable"" is definitely on the right track to sounding too angry. :<"
mother4,39dudv,qwertoman,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:00:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, I just needed to get it off me so I was a bit frustrated. But, you are one of the extremely loyal fans I mentioned. No matter what happens, you will just shrug it off and continue to support the team. This is not necessarily a bad thing and it's what's great about the Mother community, but being lied to time and time again isn't good either."
mother4,39dudv,XeniKobalt,3,Thu Jun 11 04:10:17 2015 UTC,"I do agree with you that it can be disheartening to wait for something and have it not happen. Nobody's going to deny that it sucks when it does happen! But given the circumstances, you do need to take M4's development process with a grain of salt, because it really is a different story in comparison to a paid development team who's job is to commit to immediate promises."
mother4,39dudv,Kipst3r,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:17:02 2015 UTC,"I just think they shouldn't set deadlines, at least to the public. Or at least the team could be talking out to the public more. I am one of those super huge Mother fanboys but I do agree with you. The team needs to be better with their ""public appearances"", so to say."
mother4,39dudv,ImperioCrucioAvadaK,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:34:12 2015 UTC,"In the end. They released it on time, though just barely. Technically making this whole conversation invalid."

At the very least they could have updated us with a minor update saying the update was delayed or something, leaving people hanging is the worst thing about the Mother 4 teams failed deadlines, they leave you in silence."

mother4,39dudv,Deadmanjustice,0,Thu Jun 11 04:23:09 2015 UTC,"All good, while I greatly respect the team and the work they do I honestly feel the silence has been truly unacceptable. We had months of silence, even if little has been done it's still a nice gesture to be like. ""Hey it's been a month since the last update, we're still working on stuff and just want to let you know the game isn't vaporware"""
mother4,39dudv,darkychao,2,Thu Jun 11 04:27:22 2015 UTC,"It's like they didn't learn their lesson, whenever you set a deadline you'll never meet it, it's the curse of game devs."

Here's what I think Nintendo might have gone with if every game had successfully been translated and released.  EarthBound: The Legacy of George and Maria (EDIT: EarthBound: Beginnings is what they ended up using! Who'da thunk it?)

Side thought, this would make the game more easily accessible to fans who only know about EarthBound, also. You know they exist.   Made my original words more visible maybe that'll stop this foreboding down vote train."
mother4,398wmy,pr0jectpat,3,Wed Jun 10 09:30:12 2015 UTC,"I'm going to disagree with you here. The Mother series only had one official release in the U.S., and Nintendo of America decided to name it Earthbound because it was an unknown series in the West at that time. The Mother series is very well known at this point, and many long time fans have even began adopting the name Mother 2 for Earthbound, to help the series follow in chronological order.  Mother 4 is a great name, and in my opinion, has a lot of meaning if it ends up being the same quality as the rest of the series. Calling it Mother 4 is basically saying that it is actually a part of the continuity, and not just another fan game. That, to me, is the greatest honor Mother 4 could receive."
mother4,398wmy,Popeye116,2,Wed Jun 10 12:07:33 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think it should be mother 4 rather than, like, earthbound 3 or earthbound 4. It wouldn't make too much sense."
mother4,398wmy,flintconfirmed,2,Wed Jun 10 13:38:42 2015 UTC,"Of course I agree that it's definitely Mother 4. I just want the option. A game with options is a good game. The first thing I do when I play a game is go through every menu and control scheme. These things are important.

EarthBound  EarthBound: Giygas Strikes Back  EarthBound: The Fall of the Pig King ... alternatively Boob Wizards II  Because these sound like books. And Itoi is an author. Books don't have numbers typically. I've always seen the games more as great interactive novels.

He's the only community/PR manager we know. Their Twitter isn't as dead as the Facebook, but I feel like they'll be posting (or should be posting) bigger updates to the Facebook, and minimal things to Twitter. Like the gameplay trailer."
mother4,397ymi,Hekset,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:05:31 2015 UTC,"I never remembered Zane talking about Facebook - only the blog and twitter for ""the most up-to-date info"" or whatever he said. If it is dead, I'm pretty sure it's because of a fan."
mother4,397ymi,dudebro117,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:59:37 2015 UTC,They may simply just not have enough content to post unless they're just not sharing the content they post on Twitter to FB.

mother4,39cr8x,Capitan_Math,16,Wed Jun 10 22:00:35 2015 UTC,"I think that's definitely asking too much.  Although, feel free to start development on Mother 5, which could perhaps depart from its pixelated look and move on to complex 3D renders."

Starting 22 june (I have exams until then) I will improve my limited knowledge of coding, I will try to learn how to use a modeling software (i.e. Blender) and I will rally up people to help me on my quest."

mother4,39cr8x,Popeye116,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:40:00 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong, but I don't think you realize the time it takes to make 3D models along with animations. Even extremely simple ones can take hours for just the model and a few animations. That being said, I think this is as far as we can push the pixelated look, and I think it looks great. To each his own though."
mother4,39cr8x,lightningtaco647,2,Thu Jun 11 06:34:06 2015 UTC,"Uh, maybe you should wait for mother 4 to come out first? '_^"
mother4,39cr8x,nat_noah,4,Wed Jun 10 22:27:22 2015 UTC,I dunno.... I really like how this Mother 4 takes a step further in pixelating the graphics as if it was another sequel to the past Mother games. Plus it would take a LONG time to revitalize everything in 3D.
mother4,39cr8x,Ultimate_Chimera,-2,Wed Jun 10 22:28:37 2015 UTC,"I just think we are oversaturated with pixelated games, some good some bad, but all graphicly equal."
mother4,39cr8x,nat_noah,2,Wed Jun 10 22:41:23 2015 UTC,I wasn't saying the mother games were bad.
mother4,39cr8x,Ultimate_Chimera,2,Fri Jun 12 09:38:20 2015 UTC,So we're gonna have a rendered 3D look and pixelated music. Good call.

If anyone goes AWOL, any number of situations can emerge. And really hoping nothing bad happens, but if anyone decides to leave, they could take their pieces of the game with them."
mother4,394nqr,flintconfirmed,3,Tue Jun 9 06:44:23 2015 UTC,"To be frank, if someone apparently does have to leave, wouldn't that someone notify the team before leaving?"
mother4,394nqr,belthesar,6,Tue Jun 9 13:25:13 2015 UTC,"I think you mistake the accountability a paid project has on a person vs. a hobby project/labor of love.  If contributor X has a serious life event happen that pulls them away from the Mother 4 project suddenly and abruptly, say, a critical illness, would they be able to contact the dev team about their disappearance?  Would their family think to, or even know to contact the project team about their departure?   Or if there was a falling out between a member and the team, would they have the wherewithal to formally announce their desire to discontinue work on the project?   A person could be suffering from clinical depression, and they could be crippled by their disease so that communication would be nigh impossible for them to achieve.    There's loads of reasons that could come up where communicating that desire or need to separate themselves from the project is unrealistic.    55,000+ people are looking forward to this fan game, and the simple fact that they're now reaching out for help is both a sign of concern and a sign of good project management.  They're desperate to not fail, and to let all of us down, and I have a great deal of respect for that.   People do have a right to be disappointed, to be angry, to feel any feels that they have about this project.  And once they work that out of their system, my best suggestion to those folks would be to reach out to their fellow Mother fans that might have the skills and time to help with the project so that Mother 4 can still be a reality."
mother4,394nqr,flintconfirmed,2,Tue Jun 9 15:53:41 2015 UTC,"Well said. I'd change ""desperate to not fail"" to ""dedicated to a successful product"" though. Positivity and negativity can speak through critical discussion."
mother4,394nqr,kylezo,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:55:46 2015 UTC,"It has happened before with mother fan projects. Well, it's the best we got with the franchise dead officially so anything is better than nothing."
mother4,394nqr,Cloud_Nine987,5,Tue Jun 9 08:09:02 2015 UTC,"I just discovered this subreddit today (I had known about Mother 4 before coming here) and let me just say that I don't get why people are complaining. Nobody owes the community a new entry, is what people don't seem to get. The developers are doing this on their own time, when they have lives too. In fact, Mother 4 is currently free, so they're essentially working really hard to give you a new game in a beloved franchise for free. And people are complaining that it's being delayed. Instead of complaining, why can't you just appreciate the work that's being done and be understanding about the matter? Again, they don't owe you a game. They're not even formal game developers; they're just Mother fans that want to make the community happy."
mother4,394nqr,captainth,2,Tue Jun 9 18:15:49 2015 UTC,"Old to the subreddit: To be honest, I haven't seen a whole lot of complaining. Where are people doing this? Am I just coming after posts have been downvoted to oblivion/deleted/removed? I've seen more complaints about the complaints, which I guess is a good thing."
mother4,394nqr,Kipzz,3,Wed Jun 10 02:21:03 2015 UTC,"I mean, when someone gives you a release date, and then when the month comes and they immediately announce they wont make the release date and werent sure about it in the first place, why even announce it in the first place? You can't just cover up everything with a 'its free, its free'. When the only thing you have going for you is your word, and then you do something that makes your word invalid, thats bad."
mother4,394nqr,Kipzz,4,Tue Jun 9 16:34:38 2015 UTC,"The trailer said, ""We're aiming for June"", not coming out. The first time, ""Coming Winter 2014"", thay was a delay."

mother4,394nqr,Kipzz,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:45:20 2015 UTC,"They admitted that it was an EXTREMELY tentative release date, and almost immediately said that wouldnt work with the scale of the game they had in mind though. Completely different from multiple release dates half a year apart, both being delayed."
mother4,394nqr,hecticforest,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:10:18 2015 UTC,"They're not just ""hiding behind"" the fact that it's free, this is a group of non-professional fans who most of have never been part of the game-making process. All of whom have lives, most of which have bills to pay, some might even have families to support. It's not a big deal that they missed their marker, because how in the WORLD are they supposed to predict an accurate work flow?"
mother4,394nqr,Kipzz,2,Tue Jun 9 18:00:39 2015 UTC,"If they aren't confident enough in their release date, they shouldnt announce one."
mother4,394nqr,hecticforest,0,Tue Jun 9 19:23:36 2015 UTC,"Except they were pretty confident. With fans being as stressful as they're being, and have always been, it's either ""when is there going to be a release date"" or ""I knew they wouldn't meet their release date"". The dev team was confident they'd wrap it up by Winter and tried aiming for June, which isn't even a real release date by the way, and you're penalizing them for being honest on their intentions. Those aren't real criticisms, they're unwarranted complaints, in my opinion."
mother4,394nqr,Kipzz,0,Tue Jun 9 21:05:21 2015 UTC,"There is a very large difference between not having something, and having something but then having it taken from you. Better to have loved and lost etc etc."
mother4,394nqr,hecticforest,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:11:32 2015 UTC,"How excited you got for an unofficial release date is on you, not the dev. You never had anything, if anything you assumed and were wrong about June. The gift that you never asked this group of people to make you will come when it comes, and any sadness through missed deadlines is on you."
mother4,394nqr,DrScienceBread,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:25:28 2015 UTC,"Its not excitement, its the fact that a group who has nothing else but its word immediately tarnishes it. We haven't even seen 2% of the game. We have no actual idea whats happening, and the only thing we can do is trust their word. When they say that its probably going to happen, and then immediately take that back and beg for help from complete strangers to finish their game... Am I the only one even slightly upset by this?"
mother4,394nqr,ewd444,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:38:47 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, no, there's tons of others upset. Just not for your reason. But you're not understandig that them asking for more volunteers has been a consistent thing from day one. They have ALWAYS had a consistently changing team. You seem to have some odd honor system, the game can easily be shown to be very fleshed out by the trailers put out, but I guess them missing a deadline and a half makes them incredibly untrustworthy."
mother4,394ho8,braytendo,6,Tue Jun 9 05:01:22 2015 UTC,"No. What? No! They do get a free pass. Not one of us is actually giving them a fair reason to put forth effort into this. I'm more than grateful that they even sent out an update in June to say they can't meet the deadline because that's more than you can expect from most fan projects. I've seen so many projects die and usually you don't see any posts at all for years at a time. This is like royal treatment comparatively. Without compensation of some kind, anything they do is already more than we deserve.  EDIT: this was a reply to someone saying that these developers don't deserve a free pass just because they're doing it for free. I believe that comment was deleted but I still want to make this point."
mother4,394ho8,flintconfirmed,2,Tue Jun 9 05:54:38 2015 UTC,You know I don't do things but I say we should all try to do more fan art. I'm going to try to draw something. Just for the teams motivation.

It's a nonprofit game. I don't understand people worrying about hype or attention, it could have 55 thousand or 55 hundred people waiting for it, there is no profit to be made and the dev team knew that going in. What purpose would the dev team or moderators have to delete a SINGLE topic when there are 5 or 6 more on the reddit just like it? I think you're looking too heavily for a reason to criticize."

mother4,39657y,zaneriley,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:56:47 2015 UTC,One of the things that we've always pushed for is making sure this is a community-driven subreddit and not a developer-driven subreddit. We were actually approached by the devs a while back to delete content that was going against what they wanted to be released and we promptly turned it down.

mother4,38xu36,Random_Initials,10,Sun Jun 7 19:37:17 2015 UTC,"Game development is a long and complicated road. I remember Starbound had a progress tracker on their website for a while, but the problem is, making a game isn't as linear as people think. Plans skew and rearrange, and lots of backtracking in the code has to be made as new features are made to be able to even sustain them. The short version is, Chucklefish had to remove Starbound's progress tracker because people were taking it too closely to heart, and things weren't going as planned and it caused a lot of negative feelings in the community. I wouldn't want to see the Mother 4 Team go through that amount of unneeded criticism.  On the plus side, having these bi-weekly updates on their progress will shed a lot more light on their development progress than a simple progress tracker would. :D"
mother4,38xu36,XeniKobalt,3,Sun Jun 7 19:42:18 2015 UTC,"As much as it's not linear, I think they can split development in sections like he said and show their progress on it. It would keep faith that, pretty honestly, it's starting to fade with all the missed deadlines."
mother4,38xu36,V0ID115,7,Sun Jun 7 19:49:26 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, game development is way too complicated for those kinds of percentages. It'll be done when it's done."
mother4,38xu36,vince94_1,6,Sun Jun 7 21:30:06 2015 UTC,"A good idea, but that would be the same as them saying the game should be about 100% by june. If they got to 99% only to find a game breaking bug at the last minute, the bar would be pushed to like 50% making the progress bar meaningless. Sorry"
mother4,38xu36,KayShyGuy,0,Sun Jun 7 20:41:46 2015 UTC,"A game-breaking bug would probably just be a faulty line of code and isn't going to undo 50% of all the art music, and coding put into the game."
mother4,38xu36,dillonEh,2,Sun Jun 7 21:30:44 2015 UTC,"Yea saying 50% was just an example  Im saying if the bar was at 99% that doesnt mean the game will b released the next day, it could still be months after that  Luckily we'll be getting constant updates now so no need for a progress bar"
mother4,38xu36,KayShyGuy,2,Sun Jun 7 22:46:45 2015 UTC,That'd be a cool idea though I can imagine how awkward it would be if the devs came back to something that they'd like to change thus causing their progress to decrease at some point.
mother4,38xu36,lightningtaco647,2,Sun Jun 7 20:56:01 2015 UTC,"I'd like a Progress Bar that, instead of a numbered percentage, says things like ""Gettin' there!"" or ""More than none!"" or ""Still going!"" or even ""It's a video game!""  Maybe every few days the color of the progress bar would change.  Edit:  And when it's done, they can change the bar to ""It's already out, why are you wasting time here?"""

mother4,38xu36,DoshesToDoshes,1 point,Mon Jun 8 12:16:12 2015 UTC,"The problem with this is that game developers never know when they're actually finished. There's always something to add, something to improve, and something to polish, so it'd be really difficult to set a ""100% point"", especially on individual subsections of the game.  They're writing blog updates.. every other Wednesday I think? and I think that's enough. You can't expect a realistic estimate on when the game will be done (missed 2 deadlines already), so it might just be better to know that the project is still being worked on."

mother4,392t33,StreetlightTones,25,Mon Jun 8 21:07:34 2015 UTC,"I'm really disappointed in this post and some of these comments.. I understand if you and others have given up hope, but if that's the case then you should take it elsewhere. It's got to be seriously discouraging for the team and all of the work they've put into this. I can't imagine how I'd feel in their shoes.  And I disagree with you when you say that this is the ""realistic"" conclusion here. As /u/prismdancer said, ""Mother 4 as we know it started in 2012"". Approaching 4 years of development for a video game isn't that much, especially for a game built by part-time volunteers. On top of that, this isn't ""no teamwork"", ""no structure"".. there was a strict application process and the team was very clear on the positions they needed to fill, none of which were involved in the creative direction the game would be taking. They're trying to finish the game, with artists and programmers, not add to it.  And this us-versus-them mentality.. what the fuck? ""Now they're asking for volunteers? Us? To help finish their game?"" It's a fan-made game built for the community. They've put immense effort into the project, and you're disparaging them for reaching out to specialists in the community for help? It may be ""their game"", but they're making it for us.. and it's a massive project! How can you possibly be angry that they're looking for other qualified fans to help them?  I don't know.. I'm really disappointed in this subreddit at the moment. I really hope the team doesn't let this get to them. Whether the game gets finished or not, they've put a ton of effort in and I hate to see that go unappreciated."
mother4,392t33,hecticforest,3,Tue Jun 9 01:46:29 2015 UTC,"Took the words right out of my mouth. The us vs them mentality is ridiculous, the team is literally comprised of talented fans, almost none of them actually knew each other before the game. The team is just that - fans. And they've recruited before, dozens and dozens of times before, they should be allowed to recruit again."

No teamwork, just random individuals going ""I want this in Mother 4 because it would be SO COOL!"" There is no structure.   If you think this is actually what's going on, there's no beating around the bush. You're just a moron.   They asked for two spriters and a programmer. No one's taking the creative lead from anyone.  And forget 2009, dude. Mother 4 as we know it started in 2012."

Well if you do, and the game comes out at least you can still play it. I'm just saying stuff that come to mind. So I will shut up and let you decide what you want to do."
mother4,392t33,CVMOCJ,5,Mon Jun 8 21:45:50 2015 UTC,"Not to be rude or anything, but I'm not sure you are too familiar with the making of a fangame. Now, I'm not one to needlessly say something like ""Look at the poor souls who made this, do you even know how much work this is you asshole?!"", but in this case, I think the problem is something else. First of all, what you described as the start of the games development can barely count as ""this"" game anymore. Sure, it had the same title, but not only was the technical aspect totally different (from what we know), I'm sure the writing completely changed, too. This thing started out on RPG Maker XP and now we have a C# engine built from scratch. It went from one dude going ""Oh man, wish there was a Mother 4"", to a fan project that has a really professional scale. I know it doesn't sound like much, but this stuff takes a long time. It's not your main focus when you are not paid, and while it can be your ""hobby"", you always have some other priorities. At least that's how it should be, not sure how the m4devteam handles that. :P My point is, you don't loose anything from abandoning this project. The team has put updates regulary enough that we, as a fanbase, can assume they are still working on it. If we didn't have the screens, the videos, the music and the competent presentation (the website looks really nice), I would be in the same boat. This would just be a team of no names, boasting about their love for Mother and this next best thing. With a Kickstarter, even. But it's not, and as long as they keep their promise of regular (weekly) updates and not screw up the new team members (I'm sure this fanbase has really skilled devs/artists, not only people wanting to play the beta of the game), I'm very certain this is going to happen. /wall"
mother4,392t33,Smithrope,2,Mon Jun 8 21:18:33 2015 UTC,"Back in 2006-2009 when I was active in DBZ:LSW spriting, there were many many many attempts to create a fighting game using the sheets that we created. And every last one of them fell apart, all of them. It's very rare that i see fan games come to full circle. I believe this, or maybe eagleland, will come to full circle, but the most successful fan games i've seen, mostly megaman and mario esq games, came to completion when the creators did not attempt to set a release date until the game was complete."
mother4,392t33,NCannan,5,Tue Jun 9 05:11:08 2015 UTC,"Instead of abandoning hope, just don't worry about. Don't let it absorb your time. Unsubscribe from the subreddit and just wait for it to come without actively wanting it. When it comes in the future, you'll be happy. Also, calm down."
mother4,392t33,lokonou,3,Mon Jun 8 22:02:25 2015 UTC,"I created a Reddit account JUST to counter your blatant despair that you are trying to wreak onto the Mother community.  The most obvious fact here is that this in fan-made. No budget, no incentive other than the desire to see this game come to life. That is very hard to maintain especially for 6 years. It is so close to completion and they need all the enthusiasm they can get to make the final push!  This outreach is to other interested professionals, not just fans, as you may have read that a portfolio is required and there will certainly be an interview process. So no, this isn't a grab at anyone who wants to put whatever they want in the game. This is recruiting more (wo)manpower  It sounds to me that it's now just a matter of getting it done. The creative process is over and now they just gotta put in the time that they have unfortunately run out of. The game is probably glitchy, missing some key elements that would make this game polished which just needs more time.  I'd like to assume the game is practically done but only to the standards of say ahem Lionhead Studios ahem or some other AAA company that meets deadlines and doesn't meet quality standards.   Like Shiguru Miyamoto once said, ""A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad."""

I'm sure that the Mother 4 team will exercise just as much perfectionism and quality control in choosing candidates to join the project as they have with everything else.   Making games is a long and arduous process, and especially when you're making a game for free out of nothing but love, other things have to take precedence (school, jobs, life, etc.). The developers are humans too, so there's nothing unreasonable about them reaching out for more help to help spread the workload over a more flexible set of schedules.

Mario Galaxy?   Boohoo it's taking longer to make the game than you'd like... I for one have never had an issue with these delays or with waiting. I always understood the people making this are extremely limited in people, money and tools than large companies such as Nintendo. They're doing something amazing for such a small group, and they aren't even asking for money. That's incredible.  They are not just asking fans to help. They're asking fans who know how to do what they need to help. Because they're so limited in people for what they're making. They are making this on a custom built engine. You have any clue how difficult it must have been just making that? The first delay was because they started over to use said engine, which was a great thing because it allows them to do whatever they want to the game. Sorry that you can't handle waiting, but many others and I are barely phased by it. It's going to be worth it to me."

How do you think the team started?  3: You are reading way too far into Zane saying things are scrapped.   They're asking for a couple spriters and programmers. It would be one thing if they said ""We need people to finish the story,"" or started holding enemy or boss design contests.

Instead of just saying, this game started in 2009, I'd rather say this movement started in 2009. Real work, and production of the game started in 2013 IIRC, games take time to make, they aren't professionals, just loving fans.  Because of how good their work is, how long they've been working and all that, we've inflated the image of the team to that of some professional studio. To that if they don't make a deadline, they're failures, we should abandon them.. Which is really childish to me. You don't have to follow the game, if you give up, don't play it when it comes out.  It was already said as well but here's another tidbit, the game started out in rpgmaker, and then over time they decided they needed a better engine, so they created their own. I'm not a programming expert, won't claim to be, but I'll be damned if it'll take two days to do that."

mother4,38fqh3,Ramonspm713,15,Thu Jun 4 06:43:25 2015 UTC,"The fact that they're still staffing is very bad. It's going to slow the game development down so much. I mean, you hired someone new to revise the story? That's pretty fundamental stuff. It will take months for any new team member's contribution to be remotely meaningful.  I share the sentiment of TheGuy on the blog post. You can't just keep revising the game; you've got to get it out there or it's going to die in the crib, and this game looks far too good for it to suffer that fate. I mean, I know you guys work part time on this and aren't asking for money, but if you keep going back on deadlines like this, people are going to lose interest. Maybe I'm just bitter, but we've all been waiting on this for a long time."
mother4,38fqh3,Ryonne,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:32:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Either the team hasn't bolted major parts of the game down or it's not as close to completion as we'd think. Well, that's at least using the logic that it'd take lots of time to spin a new staffer up and get them fully integrated into the process and with the team. If they're still looking for staff, the adjustment period must not be long, otherwise they'd be wasting a lot of time to get little out of a new person.  I'm not that knowledgeable on these things since most of my projects I've done solo, but I was once a part of the M4 team. I think I lack the drive to get out and connect which is why things never quite worked out for me. When I was there it seemed like everyone was doing their own thing and no one really reached out to me to tell what needed to be done. All I got was 'make some NPC sprites or something'. It looks like they've come a LONG way since then, though, so I'm glad they got all the right people after all to pull this thing together. The final pull requires some rigidity, though, so here's hoping they can finalize a vision and finish that last lap!  To th' devs who had hired me way back when: apologies I kinda disappeared. I'm not one to seek out others when working, so I think we just clashed with principles. Nothin' but respect for you guys, so hopefully there's no bad blood betwixt us. :) (assuming you even see this, haha.)"

Especially in Mono and C#; wouldn't that be cool! I can completely understand it if this doesn't work out for me though.  That said, thank god they've stopped setting these deadlines.

mother4,38fqh3,Funnypenguin97,2,Thu Jun 4 03:26:51 2015 UTC,"It's ok. Especially since fallout 4 was announced, I can transition my hype to that for the time being"
mother4,38fqh3,Camrocs,2,Thu Jun 4 03:45:32 2015 UTC,Weekly updates ? awesome :D it helps atleast
mother4,38fqh3,dudebro117,2,Thu Jun 4 07:12:04 2015 UTC,"It's biweekly, but yeah! It really does help."
mother4,38fqh3,MotherFan,2,Fri Jun 5 17:00:47 2015 UTC,Could we get this post stickied?
mother4,38fqh3,toastmoney,3,Fri Jun 5 14:31:11 2015 UTC,i'm not surprised at all. oh well.
mother4,38fqh3,FireBlazeWolf,2,Wed Jun 3 23:48:35 2015 UTC,I guess its nice to hear about something. Back for me to forget about this for another few years. Hope it gets done at some point.

mother4,38fqh3,Bluestorm83,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:50:58 2015 UTC,"They don't take donations or anything, mostly because this is a labor of love, done by fans for fans.  But also because if they get any money for it, that puts it into infringement territory and takes it right out of fair use, parody, or tribute status.  Then the cancerous, vulture-like Law Team at Nintendo will descend and ruin everything for everyone.  While I'm positive that all of their creators and developers and Miyamoto and Itoi and anyone else who actually ever MADE a videogame would be fine with this, Corporate Lawyers are like ill-intent made manifest and wrapped in a suit.  We do NOT want the project to run afoul of them."

I have a question for you, and I hope you'll respond (maybe through PM):  If you're looking for spriters, do they need experience in animating sprites as well? I'd love to apply, but I don't think I have enough experience."

mother4,38fqh3,darkychao,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:54:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but beta testers are essential to game development in a lot of cases. Without a sort of third party testing your stuff you can kinda get into an echo chamber where you like something just because you worked on it, and then it's put into the final and a lot of players don't care for it. Beta testers circumvent this by you giving them partial/unfinished products and they give feedback and insight."
mother4,38fqh3,flintconfirmed,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:34:47 2015 UTC,I wonder if they have any actually. I'd expect them to.

mother4,38auvl,Popeye116,2,Wed Jun 3 01:34:04 2015 UTC,"ANd while Im excited and all, I'm not sure how the devs are going to keep non-subscribers from getting the game. I mean, it's obvious there's going to be a huge uproar on the reddit once it gets released to the ¨early access¨ subscribers, like me. Surely SOMEBODY is going to post the download link or give others the download file. How is the M4 team going to stop that from happening?"

mother4,38auvl,nburgin,2,Wed Jun 3 15:29:18 2015 UTC,I think if it wasn't going to come out sometime this month they'd have already officially announced another delay. So I'm hopeful.
mother4,38auvl,blacknekos,4,Wed Jun 3 21:34:52 2015 UTC,I've honestly stopped caring anymore. I will just play it when it is released to the public. The hype kinda died after the previous few times they said the release was due.

mother4,38ck8q,thehaga,6,Wed Jun 3 09:59:09 2015 UTC,"Several reasons. First of all, if you look at the project manager's website, he goes in depth about the creation of the game as well as the current progress. There is trailers of the game clearly working, and the game has a full soundtrack. The game is basically done at this point and is in the very final stages of testing/QA. I know you're trying really hard to rustle some jimmies, but your logic makes no sense.  Also, obligatory: gr8 b8 m8, 8/8."

mother4,38ck8q,Rpgwaiter,6,Wed Jun 3 11:51:55 2015 UTC,"But... You're OP...  ...God dammit.  Edit: For anyone who is genuinely skeptical, Zane Riley is a freelance software dev. The only way he will get work is by showing companies what he has done. That is what his personal website is for. He has Mother 4 alongside his other, fully released and established projects. Any company who approaches him for a work offer will ask to see Mother 4, the code, the documentation, the organization, how it all fits together, etc. At that point, he can say no, and risk not getting the job, or he can show what is done. It would make no sense to have a ""fake"" project so prominently displayed on your personal development page if you didn't want other companies to see it. There is no kickstarter, patreon, PayPal donations, etc at all for the project. Why would Zane screw himself over with no monetary gain?"

They've already stated that they are shooting for a released date in June, if not maybe sometime in the summer. Anyway, this post is just dumb."
mother4,38ck8q,AlmightyYes,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:19:08 2015 UTC,"You know, it's fine to have doubts or your own opinion of the situation, but you've phrased all of this in such a way that no one wants to acknowledge this post.  If you have such an issue with the development team and their 'apparently naive' fans, then why are you still on this sub?"
mother4,38ck8q,darkychao,-2,Wed Jun 3 17:19:01 2015 UTC,"Because I enjoyed the series.  It was 100% promised with everything on track for winter then out of the blue it was surprise.. postponed till summer and now the website states eh.. whenever.  I waited patiently for months, ignoring the skeptics, and checking the forum until couple of weeks before deadline when it became obvious that it was simply not coming.  Made a post and people said the same shit they're saying now with zero evidence.  2 weeks later.. everyone is going back on what they're said and making excuses and spinning this 100% on track bullshit like it never happened and giving the old ""rather have it done right than done quickly"" story.  Based on what, a 2 year old trailer and a few JPEGs of some rehashed models?  Half of the flamers here made my point for me.  Why would the dev make this shit up?  Because we all fell for it and now it's either time to admit he's got nothing or show a REAL gameplay video and provide alpha tests to the 5 people who are still left.    Everyone is acting like this is some kind of a next gen thing he's making.  He's done nothing in 5 years now... like.. literally nothing that couldn't have been done 20 years ago except lie.  I simply came back 6 months later to see if my original post had any merit and yes it did.    You're confusing being a fan of the series with being a blind supporter of a farce."

mother4,3830fx,mr-evaan,6,Mon Jun 1 14:30:53 2015 UTC,"I would love to see something this month but I won't be disappointed if I have to wait another year or more. Major game studios set hard release dates and don't often push them back because they want to create hype for their product, sell a lot of copies and make a lot of money. They'll put a unfinished product out (cough DESTINY cough) on the release date because thats the point they told their investors that they would be cashing in.   The guys on this project are the complete opposite. They don't want our money and they want to take the time to make sure the product is 100% ready before putting it out there. I just can't allow myself to get worked up about a release date. When they have something for the world, they'll put it out there."
mother4,3830fx,FunkyFireStarter,3,Mon Jun 1 19:53:36 2015 UTC,"You really won't be disappointed if you have to wait another year? I don't mind waiting, but setting a date and then changing the date is frustrating for fans."

If development pushes back release again at least you'll know about it.  Personally I'm betting for mostly silence until it gets closer to the end of the month.  You'll get your AMAs and media stuff after release for their self promotion, and i wouldn't be surprised if it's much more robust than it's been in the past due to it being released."
mother4,3830fx,MidgetRodeoClown,3,Mon Jun 1 15:17:16 2015 UTC,"Hoping for the best and being very understanding of the worst always helps me be calm through situations like Mother 4's possible release.  *edit: Yes, I do something will definitely happen this month.

mother4,381fai,Nervi403,7,Mon Jun 1 17:03:18 2015 UTC,I legitimately think there's a chance of this game coming out later this month; let alone later this year. You know considering the trailer that was released earlier has shown off the most amount of (updated) content since the conception of this project.
mother4,381fai,krocixs,8,Tue Jun 2 20:01:02 2015 UTC,"They're aiming for June, and I'm afraid that's all we know."
mother4,381fai,XeniKobalt,3,Mon Jun 1 06:17:59 2015 UTC,"Well, it will be released eventually! They said they're aiming for June, but that doesn't mean anything but a goal. What they said was their ABSOLUTE goal was Summer 2015. I don't think they'd be able to release any later than that, they seem really close, as they said in their last AMA. If they don't make any more major changes  to the game (One of the only reasons it's taking so long is because Shane pushed for a redesign of the battle AI or UI or whatever), I think we can expect a release soon."
mother4,381fai,Popeye116,2,Mon Jun 1 04:35:22 2015 UTC,I think it was Zane who pushed for the UI redesign.

mother4,37ziha,nohimn,1 point,Sun May 31 20:13:34 2015 UTC,"Well, this IS a piano version. So is boom town lounge. I'm not sure about adding a bass clef. That will make things a lot tougher, since I'm not used to reading music with two staffs. I may consider it in the future, but for now I will be using different ""voices"" rather than staffs. You'll have to assume that you do the lower notes with your left hand and the higher notes with your right hand. Sorry!"

mother4,37v6k8,chocolatecloud12,10,Sat May 30 17:48:02 2015 UTC,"DEFINITELY play at least EarthBound and Mother 3 first. You'll probably enjoy Mother 4 without them, but assuming the game lives up to its expectations it'll essentially be the greatest tribute to the series ever. From what we've been told it's going to be a standalone story, but there will be lots of visual and music references you'll miss out on if you haven't played the official games."
mother4,37v6k8,dillonEh,4,Sat May 30 18:03:23 2015 UTC,"Emulate it. It's actually super easy to do. Just make sure when you're download roms you're downloading a "".smc"" or something similar and not a "".exe""."
mother4,37v6k8,ewd444,3,Sat May 30 20:23:11 2015 UTC,"I would definitely suggest playing all of them there's a lot of people who'll just tell you to ignore Mother 1 (which, in my wildly unpopular opinion is superior to earthbound in many ways). you should probably play them in order.  Mother 1:  I would suggest playing M1 via Tomato's fan translation of Mother1+2 for the GameBoy Advance, both because some of the translations are better than EB0's and because it has the easy ring which makes the game a lot more fun. And it's a plus because it's one less emulator to download.   You can find what you need by downloading Visual Boy Advance-M (download starts immediately), searching for ""Mother 1+2 rom"", and going Here for the translation.  Earthbound:  If you have a WiiU you can get the game totally legally on the Virtual Console, I would suggest that you do it this way, but if you can't then continue.   You can find what you need by downloading a SNES emulator from over here (you can choose either ZSNES or SNES9X they're both pretty good, I prefer 9X, but do whatever you want to), and then searching ""Earthbound (U) rom"".  Mother 3:  This'll be pretty similar to mother 1's.   You can find what you need by downloading Visual Boy Advance-M (you can skip this part if you've already done it for Mother 1), searching ""Mother 3 rom"", and then going here.  Good luck, and remember ""no crying until the end"""

I'm Popeye116 on there too, and I'm a trusted member, even though that doesn't really have anything to do with it. Seriously, though, try it. They have earthbound, mother 3 english translation, and tons of other games. And in my opinion, it's 10x easier than downloading any other rom. You need to make an account to save your state in games, though. But that's free, too. Seriously, try it.  PS: If you DO decide to make an account, when it asks who referred you, put Popeye116 .

Im a paranoid person and the countdown downloads with the videos were sketchy as is. If you must download emulators and games for them, I would recommend Emuparadise. So long as you use Google Chrome with AdBlock, you should be okay, since most of the malicious content comes from the ads with false download buttons. All it requires really is finding the link, it'll take you to a captcha and you can begin downloading.  I'm not sure if the SNES or GBA roms (the ones you will be using for Earthbound and Mother 1/3, respectively) requires this, but PSX iso's require using ECM tools to take the ecm extension off the iso. You likely won't have to do that though."

mother4,37sy0d,blacknekos,3,Sat May 30 16:07:13 2015 UTC,"There is no alternate timeline. It is just a straight line of events:  Mother, Earthbound, Mother 3"

mother4,37sy0d,SpiggyG,1 point,Sat May 30 05:15:28 2015 UTC,"I don't understand this.  The timeline is Mother, Mother 2, Mother 3.  Haven't played Mother 1, but Mother 2 ends with Porky literally saying that he's going to time travel. He's corrupted, and he travels to the period that Mother 3 takes place in. If you count Mother 4, it'll either take place before Earthbound, or after Mother 3, depending on how you look at ""197X""."
mother4,37sy0d,shulk99,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:48:50 2015 UTC,"mother 4 is taking place in the 70's so the timeline goes like this mother 4 1970's,mother 1988,mother 2 1990's,mother 3 200 years after mother 2"
mother4,37sy0d,Dancing_Anatolia,1 point,Sat May 30 14:15:26 2015 UTC,That's debatable. Some people think that it's the 1970's after Mother 3.
mother4,37lnhw,Popeye116,8,Thu May 28 15:03:02 2015 UTC,Switch to bass or tenor clef instead of using too many ledger lines below the staves.
mother4,37lnhw,ferricyanide,6,Thu May 28 16:11:27 2015 UTC,"This is a nice score! Congrats!  Now for the tips:   Try using the key signature for A. That'll make you not use many sharps and flats. When you're entering the notes and you enter a flat using the arrow keys, go down and back up so you can get a sharp instead. It improves readability. As others have said already, it would be a good idea to drag a bass clef onto the parts with more than two ledger lines. Delete some of the extra measures after the ending by using backspace. I don't really have anything else, but...try your hand at making a left hand part.   Again, congrats!"
mother4,37lnhw,dudebro117,3,Thu May 28 21:45:06 2015 UTC,"I rewrote your sheet so the rhythms were written accurately and easier to read. Added a key signature. Changed octaves and clefs.

Better to think that a thing probably won't happen and be happy if it does, than to expect a thing and be angry if and when it doesn't happen, you know?"
mother4,37c1vk,Bluestorm83,0,Fri May 29 18:43:31 2015 UTC,"1) We've not heard a thing for them in months.  2) The trailer, as the topic states, said they were only AIMING for June.  3) We've never heard a ""we're almost done"" from them. 4) Even ""This summer"" is optimistic. Making an RPG takes a lot of work. 5) They've been just GREAT about deadlines in the past.  This is not negativity aimed at the team. They could take another five years to finish it if it meant making the game better. This is aimed at the ""fanbase"" who ask the same questions over and over and can't handle a single day over the schedule.  Remember when it was OCTOBER in 2013 and people were like ""um it's winter where's the game -_-''""? That's what I don't want to see."

mother4,37dn4m,MidgetRodeoClown,9,Tue May 26 23:23:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with this completely. It's a little strange for me to see so many people tether the release of the game to a bunch of Nintendo related things like the Directs, E3, Smash Bros. or whatever since they have absolutely no connection to Nintendo in any way.

mother4,36v4i8,shulk99,7,Fri May 22 11:04:39 2015 UTC,"KayShyGuy made an excellent theory that the ""Magicant"" spot took place in Travis' daydreams. The daydream place, ""TravisLand"" is filled with silly enemys. It could grow in size and enemy strength as you level up, and may eventually become real."
mother4,36v4i8,Ness6464,5,Fri May 22 11:43:32 2015 UTC,"Thx! :)  I am also thinking that since this is (supposedly) a direct sequel to Mother 3, that the actual ""Magicant"" from Mother 1 and 2 might not be making an appearance (since Mother 3 had no Magicant), lets hope im wrong :)"
mother4,36v4i8,KayShyGuy,1 point,Fri May 22 12:09:14 2015 UTC,"Where did you get that information? The team has not revealed anything about the game's place in the timeline. On top of that, they said that the tone would be more similar to the first mother game if anything."
mother4,36v4i8,Seaofechoes,2,Mon May 25 21:34:21 2015 UTC,"Just an educated guess, bro :)  Edit: they said the tone will be like mother 1, but also stated that the game is still called Mother 4 for a reason, so its a real coin flip"
mother4,36v4i8,KayShyGuy,3,Mon May 25 21:59:05 2015 UTC,"What if it turns out that Travis' magicant is actually the ""real"" world and Pleaides is the illusion? That'd be quite a twist in the style of Mother 3's ""The World"" reveal."

For it to be a success (as much as a free fan game can be a success) it will need to be a grassroots effort and the longer it take the less likely people will see it."
mother4,36o9lu,stefantababy,0,Thu May 21 01:27:54 2015 UTC,"move on to what? it's not like by choosing to play another game while they wait for this free game, they can no longer play it when it's done."

mother4,36ju2f,captainth,3,Tue May 19 22:41:42 2015 UTC,"I mean, even if it's not complete it's probably at like 95%  But I feel the chances of a nearly complete product currently undergoing debugging at the moment is a solid possibility"
mother4,36ju2f,Hexjackal,3,Tue May 19 22:59:15 2015 UTC,"Well, the last 5% always takes 99% of the time spent making the game."
mother4,36ju2f,CzarSquid,7,Sat May 23 01:44:41 2015 UTC,"Only the developers know and it's safe to assume that the game is done but with a big game requires a lot of testing and polishing. Also, I assume the dev's have lives and can't dedicate their entire days to making the game so the extra time was needed."

mother4,36ju2f,superwash1,5,Wed May 20 01:47:19 2015 UTC,BE STRONG CLARENCE
mother4,36ju2f,earthbounding,3,Wed May 20 05:17:10 2015 UTC,"Debugging is a bitch. Made a game for class once, never again."
mother4,36ju2f,FelixVicis,2,Wed May 20 04:27:48 2015 UTC,Why is it so difficult for games? I have no dev experience
mother4,36ju2f,packagegrope,4,Wed May 20 04:32:39 2015 UTC,"Dev, Comp Sci Major, and all around coder here. Games are a very complicated multi-faceted creation. You have modules for every entity, managers for those entities that exist on the screen, managers for all of the resources(pics,sound,ect), controllers for the GUI, and more. This ignores games, like this, where you have to make, or interface directly to, a game engine which has even more parts to it.  tl;dr: games are BIG. Bugs are hard to track down, You will never meet your expected time for anything."
mother4,36ju2f,FelixVicis,2,Wed May 20 05:13:07 2015 UTC,Would the fact that they're making their own engine add even more complexity to the equation?  Seems like it would.
mother4,36ju2f,superwash1,5,Wed May 20 06:16:52 2015 UTC,sometimes that's easier than trying to bend another game making program to do things it wasn't really intended to do.
mother4,36ju2f,PunchyG,3,Wed May 20 17:20:30 2015 UTC,"Without a doubt it would add more complexity, but as packagegrope said, sometimes it is easier to use another engine in a creative way than making your own. It all boils down to time and money."
mother4,36ju2f,zerosmh,1 point,Fri May 22 05:17:29 2015 UTC,My game was very basic. (I used gamemaker but had to learn the actual code to do what I wanted) granted I was very inexperienced  but having to play my 23 levels or so and using every mechanic over and over and over again to make sure there were no bugs (there were a lot haha) to make it worthy to turn in. Needless to say I blew the teacher off his feet for a isometric rpg game made in the program I hate since it I'd very limited but good for newcomers.
mother4,36ju2f,guyfromburgerking,6,Wed May 20 04:41:24 2015 UTC,"No! Assuming anything is really bad!   We haven't heard anything from them for months, so it's safer to assume that there's another delay coming. And you know what? I'm okay with that, and you should be too.  ...okay so it's natural to be disappointed and lose interest after a while, but personally I won't be one of those who lose interest. People are only recently getting out of school (finals were all over my dashboard x_x) and I'd bet money that they just stopped working on the game to graduate, or something.   Maybe they're done. Maybe they're not. Am I the only one on this subreddit that doesn't mind if they aren't? :\"
mother4,36ju2f,PunchyG,2,Wed May 20 19:09:16 2015 UTC,"I agree, I do not mind at all.   I started earthbound when I was 5, beat it when I was 14, waited until I was 21 for the translation of M3....and this is my first ray of legit hope since then.  Game looks phenomenal, more than willing to wait for something good."

mother4,36ju2f,KayShyGuy,5,Fri May 29 00:19:26 2015 UTC,"Debugging, final touches, maybe. But really don't know for sure, so I wouldn't believe a hunch until the staff explicitly say they're done."

mother4,36i3gg,MwalimuG,4,Tue May 19 21:35:14 2015 UTC,I sure hope he does. The last AMA was my favourite thing to happen on this sub.
mother4,36i3gg,ragingavaholic,3,Tue May 19 21:47:27 2015 UTC,"Same, I hope one of the devs gives us some info, although I know it would be hard with how much they're working on the game."

mother4,36i3gg,dillonEh,-1,Thu May 21 08:03:11 2015 UTC,No we don't.
mother4,36jy3k,NeedshelppleaseIbeg,3,Tue May 19 22:58:33 2015 UTC,"Citrus Hills sounds like ""Grapefruit Falls"", and in one of the AMAs they said that there's a town powered by hydroelectric power (i.e. a dam), so I'm gonna go out on a craaazy limb here and say that the dam will be like Master Belch's base and the heroes will have to go there to restore power to Citrus Hills.  As for other towns in the game, we know that Travis is from Belring and Floyd is from Pennyburg. I know that at one point in development there were also towns named Flutune and Eldritch, as well as a desert-y location called Echo Gulch."
mother4,36jy3k,dillonEh,2,Wed May 20 01:20:55 2015 UTC,"Merryl probably lives in a small, rural town, Travis lives in a suburban area, Leo lives in the big city, where gangs run rampant, and Lloyd lives in a rich city. Just my speculation though."
mother4,36jy3k,EarthboundZach12,1 point,Tue May 19 23:31:22 2015 UTC,"That's kinda what I was thinking, maybe Lloyd could even live in a snowy/cold area? Probably not as he looks like the second party member to join...One can dream right?"
mother4,36jy3k,PlugM515,1 point,Tue May 19 23:43:58 2015 UTC,"Based on old screenshots, Travis probably comes from a normal, average hometown. I'm gonna throw some guesses in the dark here and say that Meryl comes from a rural town near the ocean (like you said), Floyd lives in a high-class city, and Leo lives in a modern urban city."
mother4,36jy3k,Popeye116,1 point,Thu May 21 15:15:01 2015 UTC,"I reckon that the large urban city Leo lives in is called ""Boom Town"", since Boom Town Lounge has the same melody as the city Leo is riding around in in the gameplay trailer. I also believe that will be the city that Zane said a lot of major story events will be centered around."

mother4,368ihw,Undeckedcheese,17,Sun May 17 04:59:55 2015 UTC,"Well Mother 2 and 3 really had regular places that LOOKED unusual after consuming strange substances. Magicant was also fictional (debatable)  This is only my opinion but I think Mother 4 will be something like this:  The Mother 4 Gameplay trailer shows Travis fighing a Stickat in a dreamy-looking world. He seems to be doing low damage, he is possibly at a low level or at the beginning of the game, maybe one of the first battles of the game. Travis is also known to be a ""daydreamer"". My hypothesis is that Travis often daydreams and goes to his own ""TravisLand"" where Stickats roam the land, and get stronger everytime you level up (cuz RPGs). This TravisLand will be the strange area and will eventually become real...or something...  Hey, a guy can daydream :)"

mother4,368ihw,KayShyGuy,7,Sun May 17 19:50:01 2015 UTC,"Travis eats the ""way past expired nachos"" and doesn't feel to good. Suddenly, the shady concession stand vendor turns into the assertive pack rat, battle ensues. After losing the unwinnable fight Travis awakes alone at the base of Mt. Ohcan Where he sees all sorts of creatures like the ""diced jalapeños"" and the ""living concession stands"" as well as the ""average cheese grater."" After battling his way to the top he sees Dwight D. Eisenhower with headphones on bobbing his head to some music, when Travis approaches him and ""presses a"" Dwight turns around and says ""I was listening to some R & Brie, why did you interrupt me?"" Battle begins, it features Dwight calling in missile strikes, summoning overly patriotic Eagles, and making painfully cheesy one-liners. After he is defeated Mt. Ohcan opens up to reveal itself as a cheese-cano, just before Dwight falls in he yells "" You Muenster!!"" A flying man in disguise swoops in and rescues Travis and he wakes up realizing he was passed out in front of the concession stand. After Travis walks around a bit the game tells you that after he overcame his wicked abdominal pains and learned ""PK Cheese."""

mother4,368ihw,KayShyGuy,1 point,Wed May 20 19:21:18 2015 UTC,"I think that outer space or even other planets will play a bigger part in this game. The previous games kinda grazed over the fact that you're fighting aliens from space. Heck, the main antagonist and evil that influenced Porky is a space alien. Yet it's never elaborated on. Plus, the Modern Mind and that eerie green glowing figure in the sky might be allusions to a space theme."

mother4,3680a8,kylezo,6,Sun May 17 02:25:04 2015 UTC,"Nooooo. Text speed, in all games, should only come in fast, faster, and fastest. And the lowest speed should be faster than our regular fast."

mother4,3680a8,Bluestorm83,2,Sun May 17 01:49:45 2015 UTC,I wonder if text speed was a bigger deal for Japanese players of the Mother series given that the text is in hiragana and katakana.

mother4,36297l,PunchyG,1 point,Fri May 15 18:31:14 2015 UTC,"Are you supposing that the Modern Mind is a boss?  I think he isn't a one (and I think he is just like Ghost of Starman) for the following reasons: 1-When he was defeated in the trailer, he disappeared quickly like a normal enemy.  2-The victory theme heard from the trailer is so simple to be a boss victory theme.  Even if he is a boss, Mother 3 had the borders for both normal enemies and bosses. Also, I think bosses should have them because it feels better to see them disappear at the end of battle and enjoy looking at the battle backgrounds once you defeat a boss/normal enemy."
mother4,36297l,mr-evaan,1 point,Sat May 16 12:09:12 2015 UTC,to me the victory jingle sounds like one for a boss fight

mother4,364kqb,REOOOOO,4,Sat May 16 02:06:31 2015 UTC,It's not possible due to legal issues. If the game was licensed itd be possible but it would have to be developed through official channels and that ship has already sailed.
mother4,364kqb,kylezo,3,Sat May 16 02:26:51 2015 UTC,"Never.  Not in a million years.  From Nintendo's perspective that would set a precedent (legal or otherwise) for fangames and mods that they absolutely wouldn't want to deal with.  Even though Mother is a dead series.  If Nintendo isn't cool with Project M, they definitely wouldn't be cool with independent developers using their intellectual property for a totally original game."

mother4,35z80c,kylezo,2,Thu May 14 20:51:27 2015 UTC,"Why would they take a game to market without advertising it at all? The point is to make money, not to keep secrets."
mother4,35z80c,Lucas5655,3,Thu May 14 23:06:46 2015 UTC,E3 is pretty good advertising right there. Plus Mother 3 is more likely to release than this fangame.
mother4,35z80c,kylezo,1 point,Fri May 15 01:52:39 2015 UTC,"True, if it was unveiled at e3, that's certainly not out of the ordinary. But he did say released at E3 which would be nutty"
mother4,35z80c,hecticforest,1 point,Fri May 15 02:18:59 2015 UTC,"Released at/around E3. And I'm generally almost totally sure it's not going to happen realistically. There's just that thought of, BUT THEN AGAIN. And as for advertising, the M4 crew already did a decent job of that for not being Nintendo."
mother4,35z80c,kylezo,1 point,Fri May 15 12:18:48 2015 UTC,"Well, no, they didn't. They don't have a marketing budget...they don't have any budget. Nobody who would need to actually know about this for a real retail release in the industry knows about it. There's been absolutely zero ad campaigning. It's just a fan game, advertising would make no sense. It's maybe getting some attention, in that its a curiosity, and there's tons of fan hype, cuz it's an amazing franchise and a passionate fan base, but zero advertising or marketing of any kind."
mother4,35z80c,hecticforest,-2,Fri May 15 12:25:18 2015 UTC,"That's the point/joke, bucko. Trust me, I'm VERY aware that there was zero advertising done. Point is, without that, there are 55,000+ people waiting for it  With that in mind, I'm aware it's almost entirely certain that this is a fangame true and true, with minor paranoia that the game doesn't even exist and minor paranoia that Nintendo somehow is in cahoots. These aren't realistic expectations and to be clear I don't really want it to be official either way (I trust the fans more than Ninty without Shigesato).  Did I cover all my bases? I understand what advertisement is and how there is no paid ads, or any unpaid either other than gaming journalism spurring curiosity. Are we cool?"

mother4,35tbqd,arlonarvesu,9,Wed May 13 16:02:15 2015 UTC,"I could see them giving a nod to Mother 3 by having you play as another character for a while and meeting Travis. In both trailers you see the party being just Leo, and then just Meryl and Floyd during another part, so there is definitely the potential for a few moments of Travis actually saying something.  As a whole though, yeah, expect the silent protagonist treatment."
mother4,35tbqd,pr0jectpat,7,Wed May 13 15:02:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think Travis will be silent per se, but I think whoever is currently leading the group will be silent. Mother 3 did something like that. Duster and Flint talked, but when you directly controlled them, I believe they had very few lines, if any at all. Who knows? Maybe Travis will be a talkative guy."
mother4,35tbqd,Jopeja,12,Wed May 13 22:43:12 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing he'll be silent, asides from instances where you meet him while playing as another character (e.g., Zach or Leo). Mother 3 did this with Lucas."
mother4,35tbqd,spritefuser,8,Wed May 13 14:23:25 2015 UTC,"Even so, Lucas talked very little. He talked when it was necesarry, and that was about it. Kind of worked well with his character of the shy, timid child."

mother4,35p3zg,flamesOD,1 point,Tue May 12 21:20:54 2015 UTC,Like a circus? Sounds like one of the secret unused tracks Shane linked to recently.
mother4,35p3zg,vince94_1,1 point,Tue May 12 23:17:17 2015 UTC,I know exactly what you're talking about. Skeeter goes to town  But it DEFINITELY wasn't that one

mother4,35p3zg,CaptainCrisby,1 point,Sun May 17 13:11:53 2015 UTC,"My personal recommendation is getting Shane's/Dani's permission first, then uploading them if they let you. But I'm pretty sure that they wouldn't mind with the game releasing and many songs going unused."
mother4,35p3zg,PlugM515,0,Wed May 13 01:54:10 2015 UTC,"I'd love to hear them, but then again, I also don't want to disrespect the team."
mother4,35p3zg,dillonEh,0,Wed May 13 05:07:58 2015 UTC,Lucky. I remember listening to a few of Roger Levy's songs before he took them off his Soundcloud. I hope they're still in the game. Does anyone know if he's even still part of the team?
mother4,35mkm9,UberAndrew,27,Mon May 11 19:06:25 2015 UTC,Holy shit... The M4 Team must be going nuts over this amount of fan dedication!
mother4,35mkm9,XeniKobalt,19,Mon May 11 19:43:16 2015 UTC,"They deserve it, the project is too high quality to be looked over."
mother4,35mkm9,JammyBurger,3,Mon May 11 21:31:56 2015 UTC,"I kinda want to see if there's a way to remove the screen that says it was fan game, then give it to a friend, and see if they every figure out that it's a fan game. It's so high-quality, they probably never will, and their face when I tell them will probably be priceless."
mother4,35mkm9,10gamerguy,7,Tue May 12 12:54:43 2015 UTC,"I showed my dad (he has never played any of the games) the trailers for mother 2, 3 and 4 and he thought #3 was the fan game since it was the cheesy english translation patch trailer. He said #4 looks the most serious out of the bunch, which is interesting, but it makes sense since the advertising for the series was always wacky. ""This game stinks!"""

mother4,35mkm9,ArmoredChocobo,1 point,Tue May 19 09:10:34 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm just the guy who ended up posting this first, so I don't think I'm really qualified to answer, but from what I've heard it could be possible but a lot of more work would be needed on this.   They didn't have Smash mods in mind when they made this so of course there's going to be some problems, but again, from my understanding it could technically be possible."
mother4,35oc6e,hecticforest,7,Tue May 12 04:29:49 2015 UTC,"It's in part to pure ignorance on how much effort this team put in. They've been working on this for 4+ years.   Also because people are trolls and like to mess with people.  Also because most fan games, while full of love (usually), fall flat on key game design elements. They focus on a gimmick and not the gameplay itself. A lot of the times, it's just made to acknowledge how great the game it's based off is, and not be a great game itself. If the trailers are anything to go off of, this game should be great, but people may still be in that mindset that it's just another half-assed fan game."
mother4,35oc6e,Rpgwaiter,5,Tue May 12 13:13:30 2015 UTC,"Just because it's a fangame doesn't mean it's going to be a half-assed game. They put real hard work into this. They are just as valid as the people making Yooka-Laylee! I think a lot of people think that it won't be good just because it's unofficial, but if Nintendo were to release the exact same game under it's name then no one would underestimate it's potential."
mother4,35oc6e,MotherFan,3,Tue May 12 18:55:55 2015 UTC,I think there are a minority of people mad about the title of all things? Like... They think that the team is doing it for attention or because they think they're super great and better than itoi or canon or something. It's dumb!
mother4,35oc6e,PunchyG,3,Tue May 12 20:42:54 2015 UTC,"I can understand righteous anger on Itoi's behalf, but it's kind of pointless, especially given that he said (a) he has no intention of making a Mother 4, and (b) he would be interested in playing Mother 4 if someone else were to make it. The latter seems to me like tacit approval of this project."
mother4,35oc6e,PavielPetrovich,-2,Wed May 13 00:55:41 2015 UTC,"It's okay, sweetie, you can admit you're referring to me ;)  I don't give a flying fuck whether someone appreciates the team or not and I'm not one of those dumbasses that gets all offended at the name, it's just annoying as hell when every single post here is the same shit, a bunch of people driveling over a game that isn't even out yet. Does it look good? Yeah. The effort is apparent. Even if it did look like crap, they've been working for a while. But is there seriously nothing better to do than repost the same shit at any slight criticism, bashing/downvoting it to hell and getting a bunch of people bitching at the poster to appreciate it cause it's free? I made a post about the trailer saying it looked great, but that I wish it had a slightly more 70's vibe to it and that got downvotes. Like, seriously? I have to worship these people I don't even know just because they're making a fucking fangame or else I'm the bad guy? It's this overzealous bullcrap that makes me hate this community so much.   Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, gimme the ""then what are you doing here?"" posts, just get over with it already."
mother4,35oc6e,milkmantoast,4,Wed May 13 09:46:34 2015 UTC,"To be totally fair, you're not the only one, but you're definitely the nastiest person I've seen this post refer to. I've never seen your criticism post so I honestly can't say I've seen people downvote you hardcore but that sucks. So to me, before now, it just seemed like you really didn't care. But being THIS venomous because some people couldn't take your critique, which for the record is a totally valid criticism, is ridiculous. The game won't be perfect, I've already seen design errors or things that don't sit right, the easiest to point out is that the isometric Earthbound design doesn't mesh well with certain non-isometric rooms. You really are painting a fandom one way by a small group of cult worshippers, and by something very small that they did to you.  Tl;dr - I'm not saying criticism and appreciation are mutually exclusive. What happened to you sucked, but you're FAR too angry about it. Thanks for at least explaining though."

mother4,35oc6e,ExistentialistCowboy,-4,Mon Jun 1 04:09:01 2015 UTC,"Fucking thank you. I am a huuuuge Mother fan and I cannot wait for the game to be finished but coming to this sub to check for updates has me cringing and shaking my head every time.  The Mother4 fanboy club is filled with tryhard brownosers and whiteknights. Any criticism of the game or the development process is met with extreme rebuttal and it's the same couple empty points each time. Even when people on the team like that piece of shit Shane Mesa spend 2 weeks trolling and teasing people over twitter with fake release information and people get angry about it this community rages at those who show disapproval.   This sub has VERY occasional helpful and useful information. The rest of the time it's a 20-repost-per-day circlejerk among what I can only assume to be a very young and very bored group of people. Fanart, repetative speculation, repetitive discussion and maybe once a month, a relevant tweet or update from the dev team."
mother4,35oc6e,milkmantoast,1 point,Wed May 13 21:54:24 2015 UTC,"No, thank you. While Shane's tweets only mildly annoyed me, personally, I agree with everything else 100%. Your post has satisfied me, my shitposting reign of terror can finally rest in peace."
mother4,35ob72,10gamerguy,12,Tue May 12 04:20:19 2015 UTC,"The reason that so many people are extremely happy about this game is the fact that they've played one, two, or all three of the games that came before it. I think the only way you can truly appreciate Mother 4 is if you have experienced the original masterpieces that we've all come to love."
mother4,35ob72,Frockett,3,Tue May 12 10:16:29 2015 UTC,Play at least one of the others first...
mother4,35ob72,Rockto_AP,3,Tue May 12 23:23:03 2015 UTC,I personally played the series backwards.
mother4,35ob72,Lucas5655,1 point,Tue May 12 21:37:08 2015 UTC,"Same here (currently in Earthbound) - and I'm loving every minute of it: the more I play of these games the more hyped I am to finally play Mother 4 when it comes out = because it'll be more of my ""reward"" for beating all of the others!!!"
mother4,35ob72,BuddyHolliday,1 point,Fri May 22 21:38:07 2015 UTC,Yerp. Finished the series back in the fall.
mother4,35ob72,Lucas5655,2,Fri May 22 22:56:38 2015 UTC,It's okay to start with M4 but it might be difficult playing older games in the series after trying this one.
mother4,35ob72,hecticforest,2,Tue May 12 04:31:29 2015 UTC,Why is that?
mother4,35ob72,hecticforest,6,Tue May 12 04:33:16 2015 UTC,"Mother 4, if following M3, makes gameplay far easier (still challenging, but far less frustrating), than in M1/EB. It might be better, in my opinion but not fact, to start, with EB, and then play M1/M3, then M4. If you don't wanna play all though, EB seems o generalize the whole series pretty well, tho M3 is my fav.  Any answer you get will be a matter of opinion though."
mother4,35ob72,Lucas5655,2,Tue May 12 04:37:00 2015 UTC,"The Mother series is pretty playable as stand alone titles. For example many don't even bother with the original Mother. However, playing the rest will enhance the experience much more. Each one handles the others loose ends."
mother4,35ob72,MotherFan,2,Tue May 12 21:33:22 2015 UTC,It's not necessary
mother4,35ob72,renzo92,2,Wed May 13 13:26:24 2015 UTC,"Well I would highly recommend playing Earthbound on the Wii U virtual console , so you can see for yourself if you like this particular style of Rpg. I did it and I loved every minute of it (I'm currently playing mother 3 and mother 1 on my Iphone) So I'm super excited for Mother4"
mother4,35ob72,Dextrorfan,2,Wed May 13 17:42:02 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't start with Mother 1, it's frustratingly archaic. I'd start with Earthbound (Mother 2), as others have mentioned Mother 3 plays so smoothely that some of the rougher points in Earthbound might irritate you after the amazing rpg experience that is Mother 3. If you play through 2 and 3 it's good to play through 1 for closure/moar. They do all work as standalones tho."
mother4,35ob72,MrSHere,2,Fri May 15 21:06:54 2015 UTC,"If you have the time go for it. I beat all 3. Mother 1 is a ton of grinding unless you use the exp patch, it has some cool moments but Earthbound and Mother 3 are so much better. Mother 3 is only loosely connected to Earthbound which is loosely connected to Mother 1. I expect Mother 4 to be the same. Play Earthbound then Mother 3. It doesn't matter whether you play them before or after mother 4."
mother4,35ob72,EarthboundZach12,2,Sun May 17 22:43:18 2015 UTC,"I think Mother 4 takes place right after the events of Mother 3. I wont spoil anything, but it's very plausible once you see the ending for yourself."
mother4,35ob72,spritefuser,3,Wed May 20 02:16:24 2015 UTC,"I would give EarthBound a try before playing 4. 4 is based mostly upon Mother 2 (EarthBound) than either 1 or 3, however I do believe it'll be a tad more story based than EarthBound, so more like 3. But back on topic, I suggest playing something that's an actual part of the series first, rather than a fan game, for one overall reason; If 4 doesn't turn out as well as we all think and hope (I'm sure it'll be amazing), it would leave you with a distaste for the Mother series in whole, even though it isn't an actual canon part of the series. Basically, try EarthBound before 4 comes out, and then move across the series according to your own pace. Also, you shouldn't have to play them in any specific order. They all have different protagonists and such. Mother 3 FAINTLY (very, VERY faintly) follows up EarthBound, but it isn't necessary to play EarthBound before 3. Alas, I am finished. Play EarthBound first to get a feel of what Mother 4 was based off of.  EDIT: Grammer"
mother4,35ob72,Rpgwaiter,3,Tue May 12 05:13:03 2015 UTC,"Well put. Also, a big staple of the series are the nods to the previous games in the series. Mother 3, especially towards the end of the game, heavily references both previous games. While it's not required, you'll have those moments where you're hit with nostalgia or fond memories of games past. The devs of M4 have said that there will be references as well."
mother4,35ob72,Lucas5655,1 point,Tue May 12 13:08:51 2015 UTC,"It isn't faint ,but the games are playable in any order."
mother4,35ob72,Pie-jacker875,1 point,Tue May 12 21:42:28 2015 UTC,However if you play later ones first you might be disappointed at the lack of gameplay features in older ones.
mother4,35ob72,kupovi,1 point,Wed May 13 02:16:35 2015 UTC,"Mother 3 is the best entry point today.  Mother 3 is the most accessible and it is probably the most like your typical RPG (not saying the others arent.. but you know.)  It has arguably the best story of the 3 and will get you going!  And then afterwards, if you liked Mother 3 it isnt that big of a step to go and check out Mother 2 (Earthbound). - Which is probably the most abstract of the 3 but I think it is the best one.  And THEN if you love Earthbound; it may be worth checking out Mother 1.  But at least before playing Mother 4 I would recommend to check out Mother 3. Its a true treat."
mother4,35o07j,Nintendaz,9,Tue May 12 01:46:58 2015 UTC,"If this Mother fan game is anything like the other, official Mother games, you should be expecting a very environmental game. That's one of the best qualities of the Mother games, its ability to draw you in and make it seem like you're in a real world, while still holding the suspension of disbelief with all of its crazy enemies and locations. Speaking of crazy, be prepared for a lot of conversations and people that you wouldn't expect to see in any other RPG. Many of the conversations in the Mother games can contain very silly, but sometimes very real topics.  As for your second question, you should definitely play as much as you can of the other Mother games. I personally would start with Earthbound, but it's up to your personal decision whether you want to play Earthbound Zero (Mother 1), Earthbound, or Mother 3 first, as none of the stories ever follow off one another, meaning you can pick up from any game at all. It's really a fantastic series, one of the best ever to be made, but always overlooked by the public eye."
mother4,35o07j,pancakesandbutts,5,Tue May 12 01:55:45 2015 UTC,"They do pick up on each other ,but you can play whatever game without being lost."
mother4,35o07j,Lucas5655,5,Tue May 12 21:54:25 2015 UTC,"Play them in order. It's better to play Mother 3 after playing Earthbound. Mother 3 continues Earthbound's story in ways you wouldn't expect, but it works."
mother4,35o07j,SpiggyG,3,Wed May 13 03:29:10 2015 UTC,I second that.
mother4,35o07j,Lucas5655,4,Thu May 14 02:48:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think you need to, but it would definitely enrich the M4 experience for you as I'm sure it will be full of little references and nods to the previous games."
mother4,35o07j,arlonarvesu,5,Tue May 12 04:28:17 2015 UTC,"What should you expect? A cool story with a group of kids that get stronger while they battle enemies.  And do you need to play the previous games? No.  Should you play them? You bet your ass you should. Do you start watching Die Hard 4 first? It's not related to the first 3, but you still should watch the first few at least."
mother4,35o07j,Destro_,4,Tue May 12 05:38:17 2015 UTC,"Don't make this your first Mother game.  Earthbound and Mother 3 are two of the greatest RPGs of all-time, and no game is like either of them. Play them first. There's no reason, or an excuse to miss out on them."
mother4,35o07j,SpiggyG,3,Wed May 13 03:28:03 2015 UTC,This is your first Mother game?  What a great way to start in the series.
mother4,35o07j,mr-evaan,2,Tue May 12 02:01:27 2015 UTC,"I imagine there will be at least some references you won't understand. At the very least you should watch an LP or something.   I highly recommend playing Earthbound and Mother 3, though."
mother4,35o07j,mechaxis,2,Tue May 12 05:45:28 2015 UTC,"If you want to experience Mother 3 without playing it (which can be difficult if you want to stay out of emulation), I'd recommend watching the Super Beard Bros. playthrough, as both of them go in blind to the wonderful experience."
mother4,35o07j,SageWaterDragon,3,Tue May 12 07:25:19 2015 UTC,I second that notion.
mother4,35o07j,Lucas5655,1 point,Tue May 12 21:55:27 2015 UTC,"The Mother series does some crazy things, so I would watch and/or play a little of Earthbound or Mother 3 to get used to it."

mother4,35o07j,Rockto_AP,1 point,Tue May 12 23:24:59 2015 UTC,"PLEASE play EB and Mother 3 first at the very least. EB Zero if you wanna be very dedicated. But don't jump into this game first, it's going to be a love letter to those who are fans of the series and the experience won't be nearly as magical for you until you've beaten the other games."
mother4,35o16w,Rockto_AP,4,Tue May 12 01:55:22 2015 UTC,"Considering that this is a fangame, with no binding law upon it, I'd imagine that there's nothing stopping a translator from replacing every line of text with quotes from The Jerry Springer Show and fart sounds.  That said, I do think that when translating and localizing, only the portions of American culture that would 100% go over the heads of people in other countries should be changed.  When Chinese Food came to America, what we got isn't anything they actually eat in China.  With Mexican food, a few things were changed but for the most part, the spiced meat and beans and tortilla and all, that came through intact.  Italian food has been 95% preserved.  So when you translate this into French, strive for Italian food, settle for Mexican food if there's a lot that people wouldn't get enjoyment of.  But if you find you're making General Tso's chicken, you've probably strayed too far from what the game was trying to be."
mother4,35o16w,Bluestorm83,3,Tue May 12 13:01:25 2015 UTC,"I'd think so, considering the pencil eraser.  Then again...I don't think I'm someone who would be able to say."
mother4,35o16w,dudebro117,1 point,Tue May 12 02:06:18 2015 UTC,"I can assume so. I imagine a lot of things like jokes would be lost in translation without localizing it. Lie puns, for instance"

There's no guarantee Mother 4 is a month or so away, because they've missed deadlines before and saying they're aiming for June is so... soft....?  I'm not trying to talk them down.....!  But what I am trying to do is encourage people to keep a level head about the release date. :/ It might be June, it might be December, it might be next June. And either way they're making a game that's gonna be great and they're doing it for no other reason than us.  So when do I think the release date will be? ...Based on how little we STILL hear from them, I'm guessing early early 2016, but call me cautiously pessimistic! 8D;"

mother4,35ic6v,delusionalFA,4,Sun May 10 20:34:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it got officially translated by Nintendo, but the whole thing was canned for being too expensive at that point in time.

mother4,35fytd,captainth,6,Sun May 10 01:17:45 2015 UTC,I think I'll do the same. I tend to disappear from the internet when I'm involved in a good game.
mother4,35fytd,Ghostmasks,3,Sun May 10 01:20:06 2015 UTC,Wish I could say the same! But I know I'll be enjoying it all the way through no matter what.  *edit: punctuation
mother4,35fytd,Ness6464,11,Tue May 12 17:01:06 2015 UTC,Very well said! All us fans will respect the game. Right guys?
mother4,35fytd,Octothorpe812,6,Sun May 10 00:46:35 2015 UTC,"Seconded. So long as the game is sufficiently ""quirky"" to meet my expectation of what a Mother game is (a requirement long since met, in spades, by all that I've seen trailer-ways) then I'll be quite happy indeed with it."
mother4,35fytd,PunchyG,5,Sun May 10 00:54:45 2015 UTC,"My fear is because Mother 4 has popped up on bigger subreddits (r/gaming) that people might be overly hyped for a free game that everyone talks about. Then they actually play the game and realize that it's a slow JRPG experience or it wasn't what the hype made it to be.  For Mother fans the combat is nothing new. For those not familiar with the series could take it the wrong way. Others will not catch the spark. Heck, it might not be as good as we say it is because only the Mother 4 team can play it right now.  I'm just anticipating what could happen. I seriously do believe that the game is in good hands and for fans of the series will enjoy just as much as the last three games."

Don't turn your backs on them if they don't make it in June. Don't hype yourself up for anything specific! That's the easiest way to avoid being disappointed."

mother4,35fytd,BLTspirit,2,Sun May 10 01:39:53 2015 UTC,"I think the game is gonna be fantastic, although just because a lot of work and care has gone into it doesn't mean it is immune to criticism, even if it's free. Hate on developers is not necessary, I agree, but don't try protect it from critically based discussion. Not that it will need any, because from what I've seen its gonna be rad."

I was aiming at the whole ""I hate this game because of x"" and not giving constructive criticism. I know free doesn't automatically make it immune but it should soften the blow a bit because money is not involved in the game.  In any case, it's really just a worst case scenario.

We get it already, these guys are dandy for doing this and yada yada yada. I swear, even if most of the hate this project's gotten so far is troll-tier bs, you can't say a single thing about this without someone regurgitating this crap for the millionth time.

If it wasn't for how cringeworthy other fandoms can be and the fact that some pretty decent shit actually comes from the more creative mother fans, I'd hate them even more."
mother4,35fytd,hecticforest,3,Sun May 10 02:47:10 2015 UTC,"I'm never going to stop hating mother fans.   Well, I hate to break this to you but mother fans are making this game. I'm not sure why you decide to involve yourself in the mother community if you dislike them so much."
mother4,35fytd,milkmantoast,-10,Sun May 10 02:52:19 2015 UTC,"I hate to break this to you   Don't worry, you didn't.  It's the overzealousness that I despise. I don't really follow the team, but I haven't seen that in them, anyway. The typical mother fan, however, is very likely to exhibit such behavior. Hence the millions of people actually thinking Ninendo cares enough about this to pick this thing up, etc. I honestly don't know why people actually even entertain the possibility in their heads.    I'm not sure why you decide to involve yourself in the mother community if you dislike them so much.   I don't. Left starmen.net, the cesspool of idiotic posts that it is, and never looked back. Shitposting on a dead sub doesn't really count as community to me. I just pop in waiting for the next ama that's never gonna happen."

mother4,35g6tk,SpiggyG,3,Sun May 10 19:43:21 2015 UTC,"Impossible to have it take up an actual spot.  PM only uses characters that are found somewhere within the vanilla game itself so as not to make Nintendo get all pissy and be forced to shut us down.

mother4,35g6tk,roberttoot,1 point,Sat May 23 17:18:13 2015 UTC,"The clone engine the PMDT uses is much more stable in creating ""PM"" characters. Project EX makes brawl characters that then transfer into PM physics."
mother4,35g6tk,Incenetum,2,Sat May 23 17:20:04 2015 UTC,"Ridley has not been added to Project M, that was a side project by one of the devs for fun. I highly doubt Travis could be included officially. One piece of criteria for a new character is they must be officially licensed somewhere in Brawl (stickers, etc).  In case you didn't know, Project M is currently going through some legal pressure from Nintendo (perceived, no official comments have been made). I doubt they would pick that controversial of a character when the community is already worried about C&D."

mother4,352aan,delusionalFA,3,Wed May 6 20:28:02 2015 UTC,"I assumed the June release date was for the people who are getting the early release?  They're going to need some time after the early release to allow 55,000 people to send in bug reports and for them to fix the bugs before releasing a game that is complete enough from start to finish to be satisfying for us and the developers.   Well, this is all my assumption, as there's no other reason to have an early release for supporters since its a free game.   Also I suggest you all forget about mother 4 for the time being. Go to the lake. Lurk all your other subreddits. Get google calendar to send you an email in late june. Don't get your hopes up for a date they're 'aiming' at, enjoy it when it comes.

mother4,34w6xy,President_Muffin,2,Tue May 5 01:43:35 2015 UTC,"A. How would anyone know the answer to that? Just a wild guess would be between 4-10 GBs, but it really depends on how much game resources are used (graphics, music, code). It could literally be any number.   B. This game will probably be an install, not a portable ROM, so unless you just want to have the install file (or make it a portable app) in the folder with your ROMs, that would be kind of pointless."
mother4,34w6xy,pr0jectpat,1 point,Tue May 5 02:51:11 2015 UTC,"I know the game won't be a rom, but I would like it with my mother roms. And I asked because I didn't know? So maybe someone else would know?"
mother4,34w6xy,nburgin,2,Tue May 5 03:24:08 2015 UTC,"It can probably be run out of a folder that you could put in with your roms. Installation isn't always necessary on these sorts of things.  The FAQ says they're writing it in C#. To make a somewhat loose analogy, the way C# works is you could consider the C# executable almost like a ROM, which runs in any CLR runtime in the sameway M3 works on any GBA emulator. If my understanding is correct, it's sort of like Java, where you can bring the program as a JAR and it will run anywhere the Java runtime is installed. Of course it would need to be kept together with the folder where all the data is."

mother4,34w6xy,zaneriley,2,Tue May 5 14:15:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that seems to be a common misconception amongst people who come here and ask questions. It seems the devs are too busy actually making the game to hang out here :p  EDIT: I really think the mods could, and ought to, help cut down on that by stickying a ""Read First"" post to the top of the subreddit which says, among other things, that the dev team is not normally here to answer questions except when they're holding a specially scheduled AMA."
mother4,34w6xy,nburgin,2,Wed May 6 01:32:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. I thought the Devs made this subreddit, lol,"
mother4,34w6xy,nburgin,3,Wed May 6 02:04:52 2015 UTC,"Hey!  We read every post, but generally we prefer the community to run itself.  It's much better for discussion. Often if I comment early in a thread, it will derail a topic and discourage others from posting anything.   For us, Reddit is where we receive comments, concerns and criticism.  We use your feedback to know if we're doing something right or wrong—and to learn things we weren't thinking about. And where possible, we'll use Reddit to supplement news updates (like when we drop a new trailer).  If you ever want to bring something to our attention, Reddit is the best place to do so."
mother4,34w6xy,kylezo,4,Wed May 6 06:22:54 2015 UTC,I can't give you an exact size just yet. We're frequently cutting and adding content (music especially). My uneducated guess would probably be between 2 to 5 gb? Music being the main portion of the filesize.
mother4,34w6xy,nburgin,1 point,Wed May 6 06:24:12 2015 UTC,"Hey, an answer! Ok. Yeah, I sorta forgot how many different music tracks are usually in a Mother game (now that I think about it M3 had over 200), so if that takes the form of high bitrate Mp3/Ogg, that could easily get up into the gigabytes range.  Which raises the question, how are you going to distribute this? Offering direct HTTP download for something that big, and not having trouble with the many thousands of people wanting to download it in a short timespan around release, would require quite the expensive hosting plan... I know some minor Linux distributions solve the problem of distributing their large Installer-DVD images by making it a BitTorrent, is it going to be P2P or do you have hosting arrangements?"
mother4,34w6xy,pr0jectpat,1 point,Wed May 6 20:01:27 2015 UTC,Thanks so much! <3
mother4,34w6xy,TheSOB88,1 point,Thu May 7 16:12:57 2015 UTC,"Oh, OK. That's good to know. I did not know that."
mother4,34w6xy,pr0jectpat,1 point,Wed May 6 19:53:46 2015 UTC,"It could literally be any number, but its very unlikely to be a number like 233729937798GB. I'd say equally unlikely to be 10GB. A few hundred MB seems reasonable, maybe a GB. We don't know but we have conventions and precedent."
mother4,34w6xy,TheSOB88,-1,Tue May 5 22:11:52 2015 UTC,"Well, you're right to say we don't know yet, and you're right to chastise him for asking for the size of an unreleased game as though it's already a known quantity.  But 4-10 GBs!?!?! For a 2D game using low-res sprites?!?! Where on earth are you getting that number?  I'm guessing around 100 MBs at the highest, and that's if they put no effort whatsoever into being efficient with how they handle the game data, and assuming they use pre-rendered Mp3/Ogg/Flac/Whatever sound files instead of using a sequencer.   Anyone remember Cave Story? That game also was a fairly long game using a roughly SNES style, and the whole release uncompressed (including the main executable, the configuration utility, all the graphics and sound data, and even the hypertext-based manual) was under 4 MBs. Granted, that was a best case scenario with highly efficient native coding and sound based on a built-in sequencing engine.  But why on earth would you guess 4-10 GBs?!?!"
mother4,34w6xy,pr0jectpat,5,Tue May 5 06:19:28 2015 UTC,"No one was chastising anyone; I was explaining some of the questions he had asked. Sometimes it's hard to convey message via text, and my apologies if it came across as condescending.  To the point, though, different devs do things differently. Depending on if there is any 3D rendering, how many songs or (low res? All sprites are the same resolution) sprites are used, etc., it's not a stretch to say the game could be a gig or two (I admit, 10 would be quite high, but again, no one here is on the dev team).  Also, I'm not being rude at all, but you seem to know a lot of ""techy"" terms but you kind of just throw them around without using them in the right context. 100 MBs?!? This game isn't a flash-based side scroller with 5 songs in it. If the Mother 4 team is matching its predecessors in quality, it would have around at least 50 different soundtracks, lines and lines (and lines) of code for the battle system, story text, menu system, many, many different sprites, menu and battle backgrounds, etc., etc. Even if they compress everything in the game, I don't see the game being under 1 GB, really probably 2 GB. Remember, even though this looks like a SNES or GBA game, it isn't. This is being developed for PC, Linux, or Mac.  Anyway, I've taken long enough to reply to this, and in the end, it's all speculation until either the game comes out or a dev answers the question on an AMA.  Cheers."
mother4,34w6xy,TheSOB88,1 point,Tue May 5 07:06:26 2015 UTC,"It's highly unlikely that anything but music would take up a large amount of space. They're probably using sequencers for the music, as those flow better when the tracks repeat. If they've done that, the game should definitely be under 100 MB. Otherwise, who knows. Few hundred megs."
mother4,34w6xy,nburgin,1 point,Mon May 11 21:06:53 2015 UTC,"You should probably read other comments in this post, where Zane from the Mother 4 team says the game will be between 1 and 2 GBs."

mother4,34w6xy,hittes,1 point,Tue May 12 02:29:35 2015 UTC,"Whoops, went back and read the comment and it looks like he said 2 - 5 GBs. I'm not sure why you think a hand-coded game with tons and tons of assets would be under 100 MBs. I imagine they won't be compressing their audio too much to retain quality, so that is probably where most of the size comes from."
mother4,34w6xy,Ness6464,1 point,Tue May 12 13:22:30 2015 UTC,"Well, that's the thing. ""Assets"" - what are those? Sprites, tile graphics, music, (potentially, but not likely) video. The only part that should be any non-negligible size is the music. Personally I would have stuck with sequenced music to make it more accessible, but I guess I can look forward to some high-quality tunes! I guess they could release a lower-quality soundtrack version if the size is really an issue for people"

mother4,34pzgd,BLTspirit,1 point,Mon May 4 03:32:58 2015 UTC,I'm struck with a crippling sorrow that I don't have the materials to do a let's play of the game on YouTube. :(

mother4,34pzgd,ArmoredChocobo,1 point,Fri May 8 02:24:16 2015 UTC,"oh trust me ill take my time with the first few runs not to mention the hundred hours or so. btw speed running games like earthbound  and pokemon is the best, you still get to experience all of the strategy of the game because of the rng and it isnt about memorising button combos and frame perfect button pressing"
mother4,34s345,hskguardian,6,Mon May 4 02:07:18 2015 UTC,"Many questions like these can be answered by visiting the Mother 4 website. This game (at least as it stands now) is only compatible with Windows XP or higher, Mac OSX 10.6 or higher, and Linux. Maybe, (although doubtful) they will surprise us with a release on a Nintendo console! Well, we can dream!"
mother4,34s345,Ness6464,3,Mon May 4 02:19:07 2015 UTC,Please read the F.A.Q.s next time.
mother4,34s345,TrokStop,1 point,Mon May 4 04:25:54 2015 UTC,It'd be cool if they could somehow manage to put it on a homebrew'd wii console but I don't even know if that's possible or not. I doubt it could emulate the game itself but then again I don't know to much about that type of stuff.  But pretty much that will be the closest you'll get to a console release of mother 4.
mother4,34s345,ZackNavySox27,0,Mon May 4 04:15:16 2015 UTC,PC only.
mother4,34msh5,KayShyGuy,9,Sat May 2 16:09:34 2015 UTC,"I'd have to say that the thing I'm most excited about is being able to, in a way, play Earthbound again for the first time.  The things that I see and hear in this game feel Earthboundy, and that cranks the nostalgia up and makes me feel like a kid again.  Which is nice, as adulthood means work and taxes and more work and MORE taxes."
mother4,34msh5,Bluestorm83,6,Sat May 2 23:59:29 2015 UTC,I personally am very excited to see all the animations! Especially the ones for what I'm assuming to be Travis' special PSI attack.

And for dialogue, in games I try to talk to everyone just to have the experience feel less 'grab and go', if that makes sense.  I could also say just excited for everything, the M4 Team has done an amazing job with how much info/screenies the put out"
mother4,34msh5,Hekset,2,Sat May 2 19:36:34 2015 UTC,I'd like to see how this loops back to the rest of the series. It's Mother 4 so it better have it's references and continuation of the Mother series. The level up jingles have me hyped. The day and night cycles are a feature I'd like to know more about as well. I'm just hyped for another Mother.
mother4,34msh5,Lucas5655,2,Sat May 2 21:21:14 2015 UTC,One thing about Mother 4 that had me so excited that I can't wait 30 more days? The answer is; Mother 4.

mother4,34msh5,dillonEh,1 point,Sun May 3 21:08:51 2015 UTC,"I think it'll take more time. There were a lot of little tile inconsistencies (objects with missing/abrupt edges, etc.) in the maps we saw in the trailer, and those were just in areas they showed us. That gives me the impression that, if the areas they showed us weren't POLISHED, they still have/had other areas they haven't even made yet. Call me a pessimist if you will, I'm just keeping my expectations low."
mother4,34msh5,Seaofechoes,1 point,Mon May 4 03:10:43 2015 UTC,I'd really have to disagree with you there; the only place that looked off in the trailer was the hotel. Could you give some other examples?

mother4,34msh5,Seaofechoes,1 point,Tue May 5 00:51:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I hadn't seen that picture before. I'd imagine at this point the team is mostly just working on bugs and graphical errors. If they have to make a patch hopefully they won't delay it as much as they delayed game lol  I'd imagine the reason the game was delayed from being released last winter was due to them fixing errors and bugs anyways so hey, I'm not too upset."
mother4,34msh5,nburgin,1 point,Tue May 5 01:24:37 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, it may be that it's almost completely done and polishing away these little things is all that's left before they release."

mother4,34msh5,packagegrope,1 point,Mon May 4 07:47:58 2015 UTC,"expect delays, be pleasantly surprised if it arrives in june. if you go into release date situations like that, there is usually much less disappointment."
mother4,34msh5,nburgin,1 point,Mon May 4 16:45:47 2015 UTC,"Even though they've delayed it before, I'm not going to be surprised if they release it when they said they would. Sure, it's still possible they might run into unexpected difficulties again and have to delay it again, and if they don't finish up as fast as they hoped to I'll understand.   But mostly I'll expect it when they said to expect it, until they say to expect otherwise.   I'd think they'd have already announced the date to be pushed back by now if they weren't really, really, really close to being finished at this point, I'm taking their silence as confidence that they'll finish when they said they would earlier, especially as that time draws very close.  That said, it may not come out until late June, as opposed to early June -- possibly closer to 2 months from now."

mother4,34hi9r,Pretty_Obvious_7,8,Fri May 1 04:54:25 2015 UTC,"Chase was the original creator and they were just messing around in RPG XP. Chase was named after himself, Zack his brother, and Leo his friend. Then it slowly evolved into this."
mother4,34hi9r,mr-evaan,5,Fri May 1 11:34:04 2015 UTC,"Zephys was having a sleep over one day, and his friend Shane decided to make some music so they could have more fun while playing Earthbound on the NES (NOt the virtule console) then Dave and the Snobodies showed up and they were like HEY ZEPHYS AND SHANE LETS MAKE MOTHER 2.5! but Shane was like oh no they tried that with the lion king and it was awful. So they decided why not just mother 4? And they started making Mother 4 game, and they had Leo and meryl and chase and zack and the blonde kid; then Zane Riley showed up and was like I DONT LIKE THE NAME CHASE MAKE HIM TRAVIS. so they changed Chase's name to Travis and the game error code appeared and made Zack no longer a playable character, but since fans were growing upset at the release time, they just cut him from being playable instead of recoding Zack back in. That is the story."
mother4,34hi9r,metalknuckles,5,Fri May 1 07:24:46 2015 UTC,"Oh man, they played earthbound on the NES? I always knew that the Super Nintendo was a scam and that you could play it's games on the previous console."

mother4,34cjy2,FerricNight,3,Thu Apr 30 06:12:00 2015 UTC,"The perspective is a bit off on the racecar's spoiler, otherwise a decent drawing.  Another thing I find strange, not about your drawing specifically but this brings it up, is how a large portion of the fans seem to have memetically turned Floyd into a spoiled rich kid. His description on the main page of mother4game.com describes him as ""Street smart"" and ""Blue collar"", but mention of his ""bribe enemies to go away"" ability seems to have made everyone think he's rich. Even though, IIRC, he bribes them with the party's shared money pool, not his own money."
mother4,34cjy2,nburgin,2,Thu Apr 30 04:37:32 2015 UTC,"I noticed that too, I also view Floyd as more of a trickster than a rich person; I think its his hair that gives off that vibe.  Then again I'm sure he would be pleased to know that it had that impression.  Also he probably stole the car.  Ness6464, Nice pic.

mother4,33tacx,DarkLink1996,4,Mon May 11 03:56:59 2015 UTC,"Regardless of what they actually did, the answer to the first part of your question is that it is certainly possible to create a 3D virtual model and render it to look like photorealistic clay. It's not actually that much easier than making a real one though, it just depends on which one you know how to do. Clay modeling and digital modeling both take a lot of practice to be good at; it wouldn't really be that much of a shortcut, which is what you seemed to be implying. (Although animating the models is another story, animating virtual models [e. g., Toy Story, Shrek, etc.] is much faster than attempting to animate clay models [e.g., Chicken Run, Wallace & Gromit]). But these are just concept art models that don't need to move at all."

mother4,33qq1e,hecticforest,4,Fri Apr 24 19:01:22 2015 UTC,Leo seems like the kind of person to always have a coin with him to flip for important decisions. Reminds me of DCMC playing stone-sheet-clippers to decide fate.

mother4,33qq1e,XeniKobalt,2,Fri Apr 24 19:09:22 2015 UTC,It's a coin. The stereotypical thug in the period Mother 4 takes place in would always flip a coin.

But now that you mention it, it does look more like something small round and yellow. Perhaps a coin, since it doesn't look quite like the Franklin badge. Some sort of family heirloom, perhaps? Maybe it's a button. But I don't think it's the Franklin badge, although it is a possibility.  EDIT: Grammar"

I think a mr. saturn simulator would be interesting, but I don't want it to be some mandatory side-quest. I'm getting flashbacks from when I was stuck on a side quest in chrono trigger for 5 months."

mother4,33jzid,Hush009,0,Thu Apr 23 15:18:45 2015 UTC,The only way a function like this would fit in with Mother in any way would possibly be if the things you do in the real world would cause some sort of growth or change in a Magicant that you return to throughout the game.

There wouldn't need to be a 'file dump' if the standard installation of the game had everything in separate files anyway. The devs have no motive that I can think of to try to encrypt the assets (given that this is not a commercial project), and linking in the graphics from their own files instead of trying to hide/embed them inside the executable is probably easier anyway."

I would say not to expect it, but not necessarily improbable."

mother4,33eene,Leo7Mario,1 point,Tue Apr 21 23:16:54 2015 UTC,"I think they said they were keeping it closed-source.  Not related to whether or not it would run on FreeBSD, but considering the required specs for the game it might be possible to install Ubuntu or something like it in a virtual machine like VirtualBox. Then again, you would probably need a gigabyte and a half or so of RAM to spare...."
mother4,33eene,dudebro117,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:50:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would download the Linux version (whatever file extension it may be), go to the directory that the file is in with the terminal, type ""chmod u=x,g=x,o=x <filename>"" into the terminal, press enter, and then type the file's name. That should give everyone on the computer permission to execute the file, and boot the program."
mother4,33eene,Random_Initials,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:56:38 2015 UTC,"If memory serves me correctly, FreeBSD has some sort of built in Linux emulation. Not sure if it would work for something as complex as a game though, or if it's just for simple command line things.  Linux and BSD are similar enough though, that if it were open-sourced at any point, doing an unofficial port would be fairly trivial."

I'm sure certain elements that have remained static across the previous games will return, but it sounds like almost everything in Mother 4 is completely new material."
mother4,32zn9t,NachoGrande96,2,Sat Apr 18 04:20:19 2015 UTC,"Ah, I just want it to be canonically connected (even though it's a fan game) through something in the game related directly to another mother game plot wise."

mother4,32zn9t,nburgin,2,Sat Apr 18 05:20:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, something like that I could definitely see happening. I'm just saying it's unlikely that we'll see a direct appearance of any existing Mother characters, save for the occasional Mr. Saturn and some recurring enemies."
mother4,32zn9t,NachoGrande96,2,Sat Apr 18 05:33:19 2015 UTC,"Even without any characters directly reappearing, I wouldn't rule out a huge mind-shattering bombshell reveal at some point in the game, which brings the previously-intangible connection into clear focus. There is a precedent for this with Leder's speech in M3, for example."
mother4,32zn9t,nburgin,1 point,Sat Apr 18 12:55:05 2015 UTC,"This definitely seems possible, although I'm very curious to see how they manage to do this. After all, since this game takes place in the 70's, all of this happens before Mother 1 and 2."
mother4,32zn9t,NachoGrande96,2,Sat Apr 18 13:05:43 2015 UTC,"Its setting resembles the America in the 1970's, but the country standing in for America is now called Pleiades, not Eagleland, so it may or may not be the same country. And while its time period may be called 197X, this may be relative to a completely different epoch than the one that places Earthbound in 199X, that is to say, it may not be the same calendar... I wouldn't be too certain about the temporal relationship between them. It could well be a prequel set just roughly 20 years before EB, but it could also be like 1970 years after the the recreation of the world at the end of M3. Or it could be something else entirely. We don't know yet."

mother4,32zn9t,nburgin,1 point,Sat Apr 18 21:02:25 2015 UTC,"I think there'll be some connection to the other games (because, y'know, Giygas is in the first two games and Porky is in the second and third games) but that it won't be a continuation of another game's plot in a major way."
mother4,32zn9t,nburgin,1 point,Sat Apr 18 02:30:11 2015 UTC,"Oh yah I was basically asking if it was a continuation.

mother4,32zn9t,TrokStop,1 point,Sat Apr 18 03:10:13 2015 UTC,"If you want a plain answer to your question, that answer is ""?????""  We don't know yet, because the dev team is rightly trying to avoid leaking any plot spoilers."
mother4,32zn9t,nburgin,1 point,Sat Apr 18 22:03:09 2015 UTC,"They haven't really told us yet. It will probably be connected, but in what way is probably supposed to be a surprise, which is why they haven't told us yet.  Remember, Mother 3 didn't appear to have any connection to Earthbound/Mother 2 until near the end, when it turned out that Pokey was behind everything, and revealed the connection of the seemingly unrelated Nowhere Islands to the setting of Earthbound. While Smash Bros Brawl spoiled much of that for a lot of people, it was supposed to be a huge bombshell reveal that players may not have seen coming. I suspect they'll try something similar for M4."
mother4,32ud9o,Breloooooom,7,Thu Apr 16 20:00:32 2015 UTC,"Well, the project Eagleland has been ongoing for almost as long as Mother 4. It doesn't look as impressive, having a smaller team and borrowing more aspects from Earthbound, but it looks like a fun time as well."
mother4,32ud9o,bluebreeze52,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:06:20 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah, I hope they're able to find more people to help on the project. As for a Mother 5, I've seen a few around but they do look kind of low-quality but promising. Maybe if they get more people on them they will improve but for now I'm hoping a few of the team who worked on Mother 4 will be willing to give another game a shot. But I'm sure we will be creating some kind of big project within the next 10 years."
mother4,32ud9o,nburgin,2,Thu Apr 16 20:12:57 2015 UTC,"Wait a minute, did you say people are already trying to start projects called Mother 5?!? That is mind-boggling. How can someone brainstorm mother 5 when we don't even know what the plot to M4 is? It makes no sense."
mother4,32ud9o,dillonEh,5,Sat Apr 18 01:01:08 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt that the community lacks the talent and resources to make a Mother 5. After all, it's taken fewer than 10 years after Mother 3's release for fans to come together and create a (presumably) legitimate Mother 4 fan game.  My concern, however, is with the content itself.  The first two Mother games were similar in many ways (a red-capped boy, pink-dressed girl, and a nerd must travel across pseudo-America to collect eight melodies in order to fend off an alien overlord, etc.). If Itoi had made Mother 3 with all of Mother 1 & 2's similarities in mind, we'd be looking at a much duller series held back by too many precedents. Just look at the handheld Pokemon games, for example. Not to bash on Pokemon, but they've essentially maintained the same formula since Red and Blue, adding only slight variation with each new game.  Fortunately, Itoi injected a heavy dose of originality into the Mother series with the third installment. Mother 3 greatly expanded the definition of a Mother game, primarily with its darker tone and heavy focus on story. In a lot of ways, this paved the way for fans to imagine what Mother 4 could look like. By having the best of both worlds. Combining the open-ended gameplay, modern setting, and quirkiness of Mother 2, with Mother 3's heavy emphasis on music and storytelling. And it appears to be working.  But how many more legit fan-made Mother sequels could be made before things becoming dull and formulaic? How would Mother 5 set itself apart? If fans make another game that integrates the best elements of 2 and 3, it would feel too much like Mother 4. Likewise, if they were to make it a little more like 2, or a little more like 3, then it would feel too much like those games, respectively. Fans can only make so many legitimate Mother sequels with only 3 official games as reference.  While the Mother 4 team has certainly added their own styles and personal touches to their game, I don't think they're doing anything series-shattering like what Mother 3 did. And they can't, because jumping the shark wouldn't seem ""Mother-ly"". Nobody would have taken Mother 3 seriously had it been a fan game, because of how different it was from the first two installments. It seems that only Itoi can made the huge changes necessary to keep the series fresh. If anyone else attempts to do that it will be rejected by the fanbase.  TL;DR additional fan-made Mother sequels, regardless of the magnitude of quality and craftsmanship poured into them, will get stale. But changing the formula is too risky unless Itoi does it. Though I hope I'm wrong. Please prove me wrong, guys."
mother4,32ud9o,nburgin,2,Fri Apr 17 08:59:06 2015 UTC,Whether or not M4 will be capable of inspiring further sequels that wouldn't be stale remains yet to be seen. But now is too early to even be thinking about that.
mother4,32ud9o,Pie-jacker875,2,Fri Apr 17 13:52:14 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, my biggest fear is that this'll probably be the last big project being released which makes sense considering you can only make so many before it becomes repetitive and the only way something is going to feel different but also professional now is probably only something Itoi will make. We can only dream for now but I still like to tell myself, maybe in a few years from now we come together again to make something good but sadly, that seems like a 15% kind of chance at best of happening.   although keep in mind, even though the game might be wanted in maybe five years or so, fan games of, we're hoping for, Mother 4's caliber are gonna take at least 5 years work so we would have to maybe start a little bit earlier than that to keep the fandom's buzz going. Who knows, maybe one of these Mother 5's will catch on and in a few years we'll be hearing more news about it. But, I'd rather keep a hopeful heart that we have a chance of making another good one than thinking we're never gonna get it this good again."
mother4,32ud9o,TrokStop,9,Fri Apr 17 15:23:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think we need to think about it yet, or at all. Talent in the community after this would be better spent on something original."

mother4,32ud9o,MotherFan,3,Fri Apr 17 16:09:53 2015 UTC,"We have the engine. We have the resources. I can foresee the current team just using what they have now to make another one, depending on the success of this one and if they want to do more. I'm not their spokesman or anything, but they did love the trilogy enough to come this far. It wouldn't surprise me if the team gradually grew and produced a new game every couple of years.  My dream is to get some form of minor community modding like they have for steam workshop games. This is a long ways off though. But just imagine if they laid out an entire engine and all you had to do was swap sprites and sounds and write a new story to make an entirely new game. I know there's already the gamemaker and rpgmaker steam games but.... they just don't live up to the set style that mother games have. A good example is the mother 2 fan-made prequel, cognitive dissonance. It felt a bit off... I dunno, just theorizing."
mother4,32ud9o,ArmoredChocobo,2,Fri Apr 17 04:20:33 2015 UTC,I feel like a modding community would be an awesome idea!
mother4,32ud9o,ConnorIsK1NG,2,Fri Apr 17 15:25:26 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the team has stated that they will be going their separate ways after this game is done. That being said, if they did decide to do more down the road I'm sure no one would complain.  As for an engine for making more games, I'd be all for it. I've always enjoyed making Earthbound/Mother related artwork and I would love the opportunity to see it in a playable game. Of course releasing the engine is entirely up to the team, but we can always hope!"

It also kinda sounds like the theme from when you ride the Sky Runner, but sped up. Maybe this will be used twice in the game, there was a screenshot of a high tech place before the new ones, since it still had the style from the current progress, maybe one UFO will abduct you/betray the modern men and help you and take you to the base of the Modern Men. Or maybe I'm just over analysing things"

mother4,32ot9a,jgestenson,9,Wed Apr 15 14:41:06 2015 UTC,"Just the fact that it looks like it's going to be a worthy entry to the Mother series despite being unofficial. That these people seem to be really dedicated to making it similar to how Itoi would've made it if he were going to make another, sort of channeling his mindset. Nothing more specific than that is needed.  But as for something specific I want in the game, I'm really hoping it can strike a good balance between a strong plot like M3 and quirky charm like EB. That's what I'm really hoping for out of this game."
mother4,32ot9a,nburgin,5,Wed Apr 15 15:43:14 2015 UTC,"i agree, but if i had to choose, i'd much rather have it lean more towards eb than m3. m3 did not feel very 'earthboundy' to me at all like the first two did."

mother4,32mfys,Parkmayn,2,Wed Apr 15 15:29:15 2015 UTC,"It could be unrelated, and because everyone is focused on the growing economy, nobody seems to notice the Modern Men's arrival."

mother4,32ikra,RichSkywalker200,2,Thu Apr 16 21:13:30 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I can't appreciate this in the same way as you can because I'm a late arriver to the Mother fandom. I was introduced to the franchise through Smash Bros, and first played Earthbound via the Wii U Virtual Console re-release. I first played Mother 3 just weeks ago.  And yet, despite the lack of nostalgia and the feelings of ""hooray we revived a beloved long-dead series"", I'm still EXTREMELY hyped for this.  Unfortunately, the reading I did online to decide whether or not to play Mother 3 also spoiled most of the plot, and even without that reading, certain critical plot elements like Pokey being behind everything, New Pork City, the Ultimate Chimera, etc. had already been spoiled by Smash Bros Brawl. I could still appreciate it, but I think I would have enjoyed it 30x more if I had went into it totally blind. I also had a lot of Earthbound spoiled, albeit less so, before playing it because in the past I had read a parody webcomic that went through (a warped version of) Earthbound's plot as a storyarc, though its parodic nature kept the spoilers less accurate and Earthbound was by nature harder to spoil in a way that would massively harm enjoyment anyway, due to its less twisty plot. Nonetheless, seeing this project making a fan sequel that looks so good it may as well be official excites me because this is the first, and probably only, time I'll ever get to play a Mother game going in completely blind and un-spoiled."

mother4,32db80,Tranzlater,1 point,Sun Apr 12 23:50:28 2015 UTC,that's what i was going to say but you said it for me.
mother4,32db80,packagegrope,4,Mon Apr 13 15:39:08 2015 UTC,"Nah, Nintendo would be after profit. They're just dedicated, which I appreciate greatly. Be thankful, most dev teams would be after money at this point."
mother4,32db80,Swiftphantom,4,Sun Apr 12 21:33:24 2015 UTC,"You mean, Nintendo takes notice of them, acknowledges them, and instead of taking legal action against them decides to hire them and make the project official? Is that what you're saying? You used some very strange wording, but , assuming that's your question:  If it were up to Itoi, this would almost be feasible given some of the things he has said in the past. I've heard of some other companies doing that sort of thing (I think maybe Valve?) But I would be very surprised if Nintendo did something like that, since they have never done anything like that before. Sadly, they tend to be very conservative about letting outsiders touch their IP. Even if Nintendo wanted to, the developers already promised that it would be free, which may or may not be legally binding on them in some jurisdictions to not make it a commercial game (I'm not sure how truth in advertising law works). Altogether I would be very, very surprised (albeit in a pleasant way) if anything like that were to happen."

mother4,322eiw,piloswineflu,10,Fri Apr 10 00:55:40 2015 UTC,im pretty sure (looking at the game trailers) that it will more based off earthbound than mother 3.
mother4,322eiw,Redsss429,8,Fri Apr 10 02:55:08 2015 UTC,I liked the overall story of M3 more but the play of EB always felt better to me. I like my RPGs being more open and M3 was to linear for me to play more than 3 times.
mother4,322eiw,pemricht,8,Fri Apr 10 03:57:43 2015 UTC,"So little is confirmed right now, it's unclear. Aesthetically, in terms of appearance, it definitely leans more towards Earthbound. Plot-wise, though, It's still fairly up in the air. Personally, I'm hoping that in terms of your question, it will be the best of both worlds: the overall tone of Earthbound (or only slightly darker), but with the greater degree of character development and plot complexity more like Mother 3."
mother4,322eiw,nburgin,8,Fri Apr 10 08:10:09 2015 UTC,"So everyone seems to be in agreement, right? We all want a midpoint between them."
mother4,322eiw,superwash1,3,Fri Apr 10 12:13:59 2015 UTC,Hey op thanks for posting this. I gave been thinking the same exact thing all week! I have played the hell out.of earth bound when it came out and even recently. I never got the chance to play mother 3 and all of what everyone says about it seems so foreign.  Can anyone give me a basic major gameplay and lore differnce from earthbound and mother3?
mother4,322eiw,obamunistpig,2,Fri Apr 10 10:54:13 2015 UTC,Sure. the game includes much more plot and story than earthbound and it also switches perspective many times(like when you get jeff or poo).there is a rythm system that I can't seem to use effectively and some characters have some pretty cool abilities. I enjoy the story elements of mother 3 but it seems so different from earthbound that sometimes they don't seem like the same franchise.
mother4,322eiw,meinsla,2,Fri Apr 10 12:12:48 2015 UTC,Do yourself a favor and play M3 before M4 comes out.  You will not regret it.
mother4,322eiw,dudebro117,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:05:41 2015 UTC,"M3 was good but it didn't quite seem to capture the magic of Earthbound for me. Maybe it's for nostalgic reasons. EB is my favorite game of all time, and it really impacted me as a child and being older, I guess wasn't able to capture that from M3."
mother4,322eiw,MemmaTheEmoGhost,3,Tue Apr 14 19:09:34 2015 UTC,I believe they officially answered this in the first AMA.
mother4,322eiw,Smithrope,1 point,Sat Apr 11 01:36:31 2015 UTC,Thank you!
mother4,322eiw,MemmaTheEmoGhost,6,Mon Apr 13 12:50:44 2015 UTC,"I hope it is more like Mother 3. The story of that game was way better than Earthbound's IMO. However, so far it does look more like Earthbound with the urban environments featured in the trailer."
mother4,322eiw,alvinchimp,-14,Fri Apr 10 02:19:24 2015 UTC,Games shouldn't be about story though.
mother4,322eiw,Happsi,15,Fri Apr 10 18:32:45 2015 UTC,"RPGs should have a good story, that is a major staple of the genre."
mother4,322eiw,alvinchimp,7,Fri Apr 10 20:13:32 2015 UTC,JRPG's are almost all about the story. Besides Mother 3 also has better gameplay then earthbound as well
mother4,322eiw,Happsi,2,Fri Apr 10 21:05:49 2015 UTC,I honestly like Mother 2's gameplay.
mother4,322eiw,alvinchimp,2,Fri Apr 10 21:17:40 2015 UTC,Really I felt that Mother 3 had a much more refined battle system
mother4,322eiw,platypuspracticus,2,Fri Apr 10 21:28:21 2015 UTC,"It was mainly due to the way things were done.  You didn't go to hotels or hospitals to heal, hotsprings did that.  You didn't go to shops, at least no many, mole crickets and vending machines did that.  It was stuff like that, Mother 2 made everything much more natural."
mother4,322eiw,Smithrope,1 point,Fri Apr 10 21:30:03 2015 UTC,I was talking about the battle system.  Walking around wasn't really gameplay as it was buying items and getting from place to place

mother4,322eiw,Smithrope,-8,Fri Apr 10 22:02:57 2015 UTC,It's a game. It's not a movie.
mother4,322eiw,zsxdflip,2,Fri Apr 10 22:17:27 2015 UTC,"It's the same thing as saying that movies shouldn't be about story because we have books for that :v RPG is a self explanatory name for this kind of genre: Role-playing game, so, of course, it should have a good story. It is the entire selling point of this genre. Otherwise, it's just an adventure game."

mother4,322eiw,medogsta,1 point,Sat Apr 11 18:29:39 2015 UTC,RPG's are based around characters and stories. It's why the gameplay was so simplistic in the early ones and was more turn-based. The focus was on the dialog and interactions and story rather than the action of the gameplay. The whole reason why the turn-based RPG exists is because it saved resources that could be spent on having more NPC's and more lines of dialog.
mother4,322eiw,obamunistpig,5,Fri Apr 10 23:11:15 2015 UTC,"I heard, at least in terms of darkness, it'll be more like Mother 1."
mother4,322eiw,Lucas5655,2,Fri Apr 10 07:07:32 2015 UTC,"Kind of late to the party here, but what the hell.  It looks like a mixture of both to me. Graphical style of Mother 3, with the environment of Mother 2."
mother4,322eiw,Lucas5655,2,Sat Apr 25 01:11:31 2015 UTC,Here's hoping it leans towards Mother.  Hope you like grinding ;p
mother4,322eiw,Pie-jacker875,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:04:41 2015 UTC,I never had to do much grinding on purpose in that game because I was either over leveled or just right when I figured out what to do.

mother4,321cpl,Diggledog,2,Thu Apr 9 20:04:21 2015 UTC,"There's nothing from the ""official"" sources as the devs call it. The blog just has the thing that says the invite list is gone, and @Mother4Game only has stuff about a Mother 1 soundtrack and an April Fools joke.  So the answer is...that I'm pretty sure it wasn't. If anything, it was expanded to 55,000 people.  All that said, if you're nervous about whether you're on or not, go to the wayback machine link from a month or so ago and try to sign yourself up. If it says you're on, you're on."

If not I need to know you're willing too drive to my house, blindfold me, and hold various scents under my nose to ensure the authentic experience."
mother4,31xw9b,MidgetRodeoClown,3,Thu Apr 9 01:44:08 2015 UTC,We are not sure if its gonna be released printed. So no guarantees on the scratch cards and sniff cards....as a person cant sniff a computer screen to smell a certain scent... But good idea though. If its released printed then we will consider the sniff and scratch cards.
mother4,31xw9b,fallenangeljay,2,Thu Apr 9 02:20:49 2015 UTC,I think we might have to do the scratch n' sniff for the places hoping to sell. Maybe those could be a pre-order deal? I'm not sure...

It's very ""90s game guide"" to have something like a sheet of trading cards, a poster, character art stat sheet, enemy cutout, etc included in the guide.  Not sure if you're going for a modern look or are sticking with the iconic retro appearance of the original Earthbound guide."
mother4,31xw9b,Jsmart31,1 point,Fri Apr 10 13:43:57 2015 UTC,"we're not sure about presentation, but I was thinking it would include only art, and not pictures of the clay models. I thought the M3 guide couldn't make up it's mind about which to use!"
mother4,31xw9b,KayShyGuy,4,Fri Apr 10 22:17:40 2015 UTC,"As an owner of a classic video game store, I can for one say we have been very excited for the release of Mother 4, We regularly play through the Mother games in the store on our main display monitor and at this point are on Mother 3 (easily my personal favorite in the series). We have developed a large fan base from regular every-day people that knew little or nothing about the series that are now excited for M4's release. We are currently planning a launch event for a Mother themed day and will be auctioning off CIB copies of all games in the series, NTSC-U and NTSC-J respectively. My point to this rant is as an owner of a popular video game store, I would be willing to pay for a box or physical guide, in any form..and i know my customers would be too, even if only to pay off the cost of work itself or to donate to a good cause. In any fashion, you have our support guys...whatever ends up happening."

mother4,31vzke,Destro_,1 point,Thu Apr 9 13:31:52 2015 UTC,"Gonna be playing all three previous Mother games about a week before June and not allow myself to play 4 until I've finished 3... unless I'm working on the strategy guide, then I'll probably play them a few weeks before so I can have time. Shouldn't be all too hard, though, as I personally find the trilogy to be fairly easy games, just a bit long.   I'd cook steak. Maybe ribs. I'd say omelettes but those are a bit more of a breakfast food. Are your friends into Mother? Like /u/packagegrope said, it's a singleplayer jprg.

Plus, most of, if not all of the devs, have sprites that represent themselves, as shown on the old website. I think it's safe to assume that all of the devs have these, as Shane has one on his twitter account, yet his character isn't shown on the old website."

mother4,31tbvu,Rockto_AP,2,Wed Apr 8 00:20:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know about some of these. It was said that it's debatable whether it's a prequel or not.  Spoilers mostly for Mother 3, but involves entire trilogy. As I personally believe the game takes place in the area that Porky gathers the Pigmask Army from (which could be supported by the Modern Men wanting to modernize the entire world, tricking people into joining them to help 'modernize' the Nowhere Islands), some of these enemies wouldn't make sense. King Statue and Ultimate Chimera just don't make sense due to both the time the game takes place and location. Yes Man Junior is part of the Sharks from Onett, which is likely very far from Pleiades. I doubt they have any influence there. However, Mr. Batty, Mad Duck, Detached Leech, Dung Beetle, Fly, and Zombie are very possible. I also don't think we'll be seeing any Krakens, as they were Mother 2's 'legendary monster', like the Dragon from Mother 1 or Ultimate Chimera from Mother 3. The only Krakens that existed outside of Summers were far in the past and in the Sea of Eden. However, Mother 4 is confirmed to have its own unique 'legendary monster' similar to those three.  To answer your initial question (which may have been rhetorical), it's been confirmed that Unassuming Local Guy and Ego Orb would be returning. Whether this is still the case is unknown. Based on the trailers, it looks like Atomic Power Robot and Rats are returning. Leo is also shown to be fighting a Cop in the first trailer, meaning he might be the only returning enemy known from your list. Also, in the second trailer, a fight is shown against two Stickats and an unnamed snail enemy. I think that this might be a Magica Snail redesign from Mother 1, and that both the snails and Stickats are enemies found in Travis's Magicant.  TL;DR: A few of the enemies you've mentioned wouldn't make sense due to the time and place Mother 4 takes place. Those enemies are the Ultimate Chimera, Yes Man Junior, King Statue, and the Kraken. However, it is known that Cop, Atomic Power Robot, and Rat are returning. It's possible that Magica Snails from Mother 1 may return, and it's been stated in the past that Unassuming Local Guy and Ego Orb from Mother 2 will return, but their status is currently unknown.  Sorry for the analysis, might have been a bit over the top."

I'd be willing to help with some of the writing for it and such. I should be able to help out with that once June comes around. Mother 4 is the only thing I'm planning on doing in June, besides my last few days of school and working, so I should have plenty of time to contribute to making a guide for the game."

After time people start to recognize you by name and such, and it just feels good to be known, really. But anyway, yeah, looking forward to June to help out with the guide. I can get you my email and sign up for slack a bit later. Gonna be fun working with you and the rest!"

mother4,31nmte,goldenlakesfox,9,Mon Apr 6 18:39:04 2015 UTC,I dont have any more hype for the game.  After I saw the new trailer my hype exploded and I am dead now halp.
mother4,31nmte,Ness6464,3,Mon Apr 6 21:03:47 2015 UTC,Agreed. I've been listening to the OST non-stop! The hype is SO real!
mother4,31nmte,tasos500,3,Tue Apr 7 09:47:39 2015 UTC,I watched the gameplay trailer about four different times yesterday. The music is so dynamically used and just kinda.. I almost wanna say perfected. Props to shane and other collaborators  .-.
mother4,31nmte,chAotic22,6,Tue Apr 7 19:03:19 2015 UTC,I can't wait to jam out to that Melty Robot battle music.

mother4,31mbne,Mswordx23,3,Mon Apr 6 12:52:09 2015 UTC,Yeah no way was this very clearly inspired by Onett or anything. OP is just crazy.
mother4,31mbne,DMthePerson,3,Tue Apr 7 04:19:55 2015 UTC,"It does seem heavily inspired by Sunrise In Onett, yes. They've been trying to stick to the original EarthBound feel, so I can see why this would sound so similar to it."

mother4,31mbne,JazzyWazzy64,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:18:54 2015 UTC,I believe it's kind of an intentional remix type thing.  It's a great fucking song.
mother4,31jv7x,hinhd2020,6,Sun Apr 5 20:10:43 2015 UTC,I actually prefer the pixelated version. Just seems wrong to make them smooth.
mother4,31jv7x,bluebreeze52,3,Sun Apr 5 23:32:04 2015 UTC,"For me, Earthbound looks wrong smoothed, but Mother three looks wrong without SABR filter"
mother4,31jv7x,captainth,3,Mon Apr 6 00:28:19 2015 UTC,"I would agree with this, Eartbound's style just doesn't cater to filtering as much as the other two mother games do. I just recently played through Mother 1 (the GBA version) and started Earthbound and I used HQ2x when playing Mother 1 and all filters just looked weird for Earthbound, and then it starts looking okay again on Mother 3.  I would say this is true for most SNES games, something about the color pallet or something."
mother4,31jv7x,darkychao,4,Tue Apr 7 01:25:50 2015 UTC,"You must not have played Earthbound on the actual SNES; old-school CRTs displayed games with an unintended smoothing filter because of the way games displayed (not to mention they were plugged into the coaxial on the TV). If you were to play Earthbound on an emulator with no filter, that is not what original players saw when they played on a tube TV."
mother4,31jv7x,pr0jectpat,4,Mon Apr 6 13:51:23 2015 UTC,"I actually have an SNES and a physical EB cart, and did play it, but I have poor vision and must not have noticed it when I played through it. In any case, I still think SNES pixelation has a charm to it a lot of modern games lack."
mother4,31jv7x,bluebreeze52,2,Mon Apr 6 18:15:37 2015 UTC,"It would be interesting to have an option for a filter that emulates the natural antialiasing of a CRT monitor. But this filter in the screenshot reminds me more of when you're using a Vector Graphics program like Illustrator or Inkscape and you try to Autotrace a low res image. It's not a horrible look I suppose, but if the developers wanted the game to look smooth, they could actually use higher resolution assets, rather than implement a filter to go over their game. I don't guess it would hurt to have this as an option, as it would definitely be a much less time-consuming alternative for a ""smooth option"" than making 2 entirely different sets of assets, but something like this would still probably be very, very low on the devs' priority list."
mother4,31jv7x,nburgin,1 point,Sat Apr 11 18:46:43 2015 UTC,That's actually super interesting.

mother4,31jv7x,flintconfirmed,2,Tue Apr 7 01:40:15 2015 UTC,"I think it'd be awesome. Of course I love pixel graphics, but I love the filter as well."
mother4,31jv7x,Epic563,2,Tue Apr 7 19:14:36 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I've always had a crazy gripe against HQ2x, 4x, etc filter because it takes away from the intended, pixel look. I cringe when I see YouTubers doing that."
mother4,31jv7x,CreAtor135,0,Mon Apr 6 21:59:46 2015 UTC,"You cringe because it doesn't fit into the ""intended style?""  Don't be such an elitist, let people use whatever filter they want."
mother4,31jv7x,Epic563,3,Tue Apr 7 19:14:03 2015 UTC,"I never said they couldn't use the filter, I just said that personally I don't like it. My opinion is my opinion and you simply have to respect that."
mother4,31jv7x,CreAtor135,0,Tue Apr 7 19:59:26 2015 UTC,"You didn't just say that you didn't like it, you said that it was horrible and you cringed when you saw it. There's a difference between disliking something, and then being an elitist saying that it doesn't fit the intended style.  People can dislike something, that's fine, but you made it sound like it was horrible thing that people use the filter."
mother4,31jv7x,Epic563,3,Tue Apr 7 20:22:17 2015 UTC,"No, I did say I didn't like it. I specifically used the pronoun ""I"" to describe my disdain for the filter. I said that I've cringed in the past at people who use it, but I've never instructed them NOT to use it. The intent of my post was to share my dislike, but I'm not telling him not to use it. It's still MY opinion. After not respecting my avid opinion, you lashed out on me saying that I'm an elitist. I'm not saying people shouldn't be free to alter from the original style or that they should praise it, because it's MY opinion. If you think differently, you're free to do so, because I'VE never said that anyone is not allowed to have a different mindset. I don't control anyone's brain and I never will."

I don't know if it fills up more during certain situations, but for all I know, it fills up after every hit a small amount and when it's full, you get an instant extra turn, even if the enemy hasn't gone yet."

mother4,31hkz5,black_fractals,1 point,Sun Apr 5 04:04:21 2015 UTC,The single pixel isn't a smile. The outline of the face isn't part of the mouth. The single pixel is a side view of a line.
mother4,31fgyv,spritefuser,1 point,Sat Apr 4 16:10:14 2015 UTC,"I would honestly be surprised if there wasn't any songs like that in Mother 4... Shane released a song on SoundCloud not too long ago called ""Skeeter Goes to Town"", which has changing tempos throughout the tune. This song sadly is going unused, but I'm sure they will have kept the same idea while making Mother 4 in one way or another."
mother4,31fgyv,MarchingBro,1 point,Mon Apr 6 00:19:38 2015 UTC,"As someone who knows how to play musical instruments, it was REALLY annoying when Mother 3 copied and pasted existing songs and changed the tempo willy-nilly. They should have written brand-new songs, or just re-used the original ones!   One song that comes to mind is Hustle for Pride. The only reason it existed was to mess with people who were used to doing 16-hit combos to Unfounded Revenge. 16-hit combos in general were already really hard to pull off on emulators.   Of course, Mother 4 won't suffer from emulator input lag. If they do wacky tempo changes, I hope that they'll just do them in the original songs (like Skeeter Goes to Town, if that ends up in the final game, and Accelerondo, which was actually fun to combo to) and not make tampered versions of songs the player will have already heard."

mother4,30xzfi,PkmnTrainerJay,12,Tue Mar 31 16:51:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is apples and oranges if you ask me. Mario is Nintendo's #1 IP, and the largest video game character ever; they are much more protective over him than other series in their collection. Also, the Mother series is done (according to it's creator, Itoi), so Nintendo doesn't have much to gain by issuing a cease and desist to Mother 4. M4 has been in production for what... 5 years now? If Nintendo wanted to issue a C&D, they would have most likely done so by now. Alternatively, if they do decide to issue one after the game has already been released, then it will be available via torrent or other ""nefarious"" ways."
mother4,30xzfi,pr0jectpat,3,Tue Mar 31 17:45:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know it's VERY unlikely since the game is pretty much all original content and the fact Itoi said Mother is ""done"", I was really just wondering if this could potentially mean bad news for this project. Good to know that it probably won't :D  I'm REALLY hyped for Mother 4 and I'd hate to see the game get shut down... The only reason I made this is was cuz I was thinkin, If they shut down 64 HD cuz they could potentially make an official one in the future, what about Mother?  I know Itoi said Mother is done but still you never know what Nintendo has planned, there could very well be an official Mother 4 in the future if Itoi changes his mind or they decide to go on without him or something.  I really doubt the Mother series will be dead forever..  But yeah I would NEVER want this project to get shut down like Chrono Resurrection or 64 HD. It's great to know it probably won't happen with Mother 4 as it looks AMAZING, and the team looks very devoted to it, can't wait to play this! :)"
mother4,30xzfi,ArmoredChocobo,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:03:28 2015 UTC,"Square C&D'd a Chrono Trigger fan project (not a game, just making scenes in 3D) and never did anything with Chrono Trigger since Chrono Cross.  Sega went crazy pulling Let's Plays and gameplay videos of Shining Force from Youtube, though they haven't done anything with Shining Force in years.  Just because it's old or ""done"" won't stop a company from trying to get rid of fan-made things."
mother4,30xzfi,catzalot,28,Thu Apr 2 00:11:41 2015 UTC,That's a remake of a game that has potential for an official hd remake.  Mother 4 is a original fan game for a series that has been confirmed to have no sequel coming.  Nintendo probably won't shut down M4.  EDIT: My subconscious hope for a sequel must have made me mess up.
mother4,30xzfi,KayShyGuy,5,Tue Mar 31 17:11:20 2015 UTC,Confirmed to have NO sequel coming  FTFY
mother4,30xzfi,luckjes112,3,Tue Mar 31 19:00:12 2015 UTC,First time someone said FTFY while actually fixing something.
mother4,30xzfi,KayShyGuy,2,Tue Mar 31 19:03:07 2015 UTC,Lol
mother4,30xzfi,luckjes112,2,Tue Mar 31 19:12:45 2015 UTC,"Also, have a song: A great remix of two old classics"
mother4,30xzfi,UltrosFinalFantasyVI,-1,Tue Mar 31 19:15:48 2015 UTC,"no sequel coming FOR NOW. Time can change alot of things breh, including peoples opinion on certain things. NEVER SAY NEVER HOMIE"
mother4,30xzfi,luckjes112,2,Tue Mar 31 20:33:59 2015 UTC,Eh?
mother4,30xzfi,GlobalVV,8,Tue Mar 31 20:55:35 2015 UTC,Sequel coming? Confirmed? Pls explain....
mother4,30xzfi,catzalot,3,Tue Mar 31 18:45:10 2015 UTC,"Just a mistake, sorry. :("

mother4,30xzfi,Happypumkin,18,Tue Mar 31 19:59:02 2015 UTC,I'd see Nintendo shut down the Mother 3 translation before they shut down Mother 4 I think.
mother4,30xzfi,Random_Initials,9,Tue Mar 31 17:47:32 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, the first thing that Nintendo would strike down would probably be the Mother 3 handbook. Think of it, it's an unlicensed product that contains tons of imagery ripped directly from the game, gives a synopsis of the story, uses trade marks such as ""Mother 3,"" and is being sold for actual money for profit. If that is not lawsuit bait, I don't know what is."
mother4,30xzfi,BLTspirit,4,Tue Mar 31 19:32:12 2015 UTC,well that's very true aswell. I guess when It comes to Mother we've got no worries after all! Here's to hoping we can all enjoy Mother 4 without any copyright BS!!
mother4,30xzfi,TorchicBlaziken,12,Tue Mar 31 20:21:49 2015 UTC,I might Add that the majority of assets from this remake were directly ripped from Mario Galaxy.
mother4,30xzfi,pr0jectpat,7,Tue Mar 31 18:13:38 2015 UTC,"I didn't even think of that, but your right. I guess it wasn't really that fair of a comparison after all, Mario HD was much less original than Mother 4"
mother4,30xzfi,Pie-jacker875,6,Tue Mar 31 20:23:35 2015 UTC,"Nintendo patented several of the specific mechanics of Super Mario 64, which was another reason why Nintendo might have wanted to take it down.  Patents might be relevant here as well, this uses the rhythm combo mechanic from MOTHER 3 which Nintendo patented while it was being developed for GBA. Though I must admit that I'm not knowledgeable about patents."
mother4,30xzfi,Psychoho1ic,2,Tue Mar 31 23:02:02 2015 UTC,Awesome research. Have an upvote.
mother4,30xzfi,UltrosFinalFantasyVI,1 point,Wed Apr 1 13:43:43 2015 UTC,Software patents are such a cancer to society.
mother4,30xzfi,captainth,4,Sun Apr 5 22:46:02 2015 UTC,"Worse case scenario, you could just change the name, since it's all original content."
mother4,30xzfi,MotherFan,5,Wed Apr 1 00:39:04 2015 UTC,THIS. WE GOT NOTHING TO FEAR BROS
mother4,30xzfi,Random_Initials,3,Wed Apr 1 02:12:49 2015 UTC,"Mothra 4, here we come!"
mother4,30xzfi,supersmashdude,3,Fri Apr 3 03:22:26 2015 UTC,"No, Nintendo and Itoi are fine with it, it's a non-profit fan game that's almost completely original. If Nintendo changed their minds out of the blue then the M4 team would just have to rename some things and edit some parts of the game that were in previous Mother games."
mother4,30xzfi,swifterthansanic,3,Wed Apr 1 03:38:31 2015 UTC,"Building upon this, Itoi's attitude to starmen.net and other fan creation suggests that he may want to give the Mother 4 team a big hug and a congratulations on their efforts. We really could use more nice people like him in this world..."
mother4,30xzfi,ArmoredChocobo,3,Wed Apr 1 20:04:23 2015 UTC,"Short answer: This Mario 64 HD project would allow people to play a sold game for free. Even if it's just one level, Nintendo wouldn't be cool with that.  M4 does not let people play any EarthBound game for free. It's a new game in the style of mother."
mother4,30xzfi,ply447,2,Wed Apr 1 05:11:38 2015 UTC,"Gee, I was hoping the mario 64 HD remake would be finished. I didn't get to try it out but it looked AMAZING. I freakin hope this doesn't get taken down! this is completely original ... well not the adding it to the series,  but the story is original and Itoi said there will be no more mother games, so i believe this won't be taken down it is simply a fan game. Those of us who have our email setup on the list could still keep the files though."
mother4,30xzfi,vince94_1,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:22:55 2015 UTC,"Nintendo doesn't care enough about Mother to bother with it.  Not to mention Mother 4 is a 100% original work, save for the title ""Mother"", whereas Super Mario 64 HD was just a re-mastered version of Super Mario 64, everything else is the same."
mother4,30xzfi,Sirdannykins,1 point,Wed Apr 1 17:05:12 2015 UTC,"I think if the name mother was used for earthbound they might have shut this down, trademark law is really obtuse about protecting your trademark, but since its not, its likely fine."
mother4,30xzfi,captainth,1 point,Fri Apr 3 12:57:54 2015 UTC,"A free remake would be a threat to legit Mario 64 sales on Virtual Console, but a free fangame with an original plot wouldn't be a monetary threat to Nintendo at all.  If, on the other hand, someone tried making a port (copied script, music, etc.) of EarthBound with a 3D engine, Nintendo probably would take it down."
mother4,30ykyq,KayShyGuy,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:23:20 2015 UTC,"Probably because it's not finished yet. Also, here's your song"
mother4,30ykyq,luckjes112,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:40:10 2015 UTC,"Thats a possibility, but still seems to me like thats how its gonna stay. I guess we'll find out in June"
mother4,30ykyq,ArmoredChocobo,-3,Tue Mar 31 20:57:34 2015 UTC,"I think it has to do with programming limitations because C++ can only do so much, or the fact that the game isn't finished yet so they have just one placeholder ""combo palette"" for all music."
mother4,30ykyq,Miniced,5,Tue Mar 31 22:41:57 2015 UTC,I have never heard of any kind of limitations regarding c++ as a programmer myself.
mother4,30ykyq,marioman63,2,Tue Mar 31 23:35:31 2015 UTC,"its gotta just be unfinished. so many games are coded in C++, many of which are rhythm games. the codebase cant be the reason"
mother4,30ykyq,Commander034,1 point,Tue Mar 31 22:56:23 2015 UTC,"You guys are right, whatever the reason I really hope its just a placeholder, I liked the challenge of going with different music everytime"
mother4,30puv0,TopHatHipster,4,Sun Mar 29 17:49:36 2015 UTC,"It really seems similar to this part of the song: https://youtu.be/3GwjfUFyY6M?t=1m29s  Could anyone corfirm this? Like maybe one of the staff members?  I love that they put in this Easter Egg/sample of the song in it, hope they won't get copyright issues by it. D:"
mother4,30puv0,pr0jectpat,4,Sun Mar 29 17:52:54 2015 UTC,"They most likely ARE sampling multiple songs -- not just Celebration -- for songs in M4. The composer from M1/Earthbound and Itoi did this on purpose to fit the Western theme of the game. Many samples from songs such as Johnny B Good and Sgt. Pepper are used in Earthbound, and its a big reason Nintendo had troubles getting EB localized. I would imagine that to stay consistent with the series, they are probably doing this on purpose. I look forward to hearing more of these ""easter eggs""."
mother4,30puv0,Pie-jacker875,1 point,Sun Mar 29 19:14:17 2015 UTC,"That's true! I hope the team of MOTHER 4 will use more of these easter eggs aswell! But I think they won't as much as MOTHER 1 or EarthBound, due to legal issues. But they could always patch them out then, if needed."
mother4,30puv0,Pie-jacker875,1 point,Sun Mar 29 19:23:06 2015 UTC,some fans here might keep torrents of the original version with legally questionable songs though
mother4,30puv0,ArmoredChocobo,1 point,Sun Mar 29 22:36:59 2015 UTC,"Uhm, what do you mean by that? I don't understand what you're saying."
mother4,30puv0,ArmoredChocobo,2,Mon Mar 30 05:37:46 2015 UTC,"If it comes out with music that later causes it to run into trouble and the game is patched to remove that music, then some fans will continue to distribute the original without music patched out."
mother4,30puv0,ArmoredChocobo,0,Mon Mar 30 10:32:40 2015 UTC,"That's true, but then the fans will get problem, not the creators, since they fixed it."
mother4,30puv0,KayShyGuy,1 point,Mon Mar 30 14:36:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe the first few notes, but it deviates quickly."
mother4,30puv0,Destro_,2,Sun Mar 29 18:53:51 2015 UTC,"That's true. but it's about the first few notes! I hope a staff member will corfirm that this is a reference to the song. Maybe they'll also include a piece of the YMCA song as easter egg? xD Would fit the funkyness, though!"
mother4,30puv0,Destro_,1 point,Sun Mar 29 19:05:20 2015 UTC,Why do they need to confirm the first few notes as a reference to the song?  That's like asking Squaresoft to say that Robo's Theme was a reference to Rick Astley.
mother4,30q1p6,ArmoredChocobo,3,Sun Mar 29 18:46:20 2015 UTC,"I already uploaded this a week ago. Also, these sound a little out of sync."
mother4,30q1p6,darkychao,1 point,Sun Mar 29 22:51:23 2015 UTC,"Indeed, must have missed it.  I do like how you comboed them all together.  Don't see this sync you're talking about, though."
mother4,30q1p6,darkychao,2,Sun Mar 29 23:01:39 2015 UTC,"It could just be me, but Meryl's violin sounds a little off."
mother4,30q1p6,Destro_,1 point,Mon Mar 30 00:03:45 2015 UTC,"While I still like the new version better, I think darkychao is right. Meryl's string instrument sounds out of sync with the others. Like if she started too late."
mother4,30q1p6,Ghostmasks,1 point,Mon Mar 30 13:42:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think I see where the problem is.  I had to cut Meryl short because Zach's echo bleeded into Meryl's violin, which was messing up the whole thing. I probably could have fixed that by copying the first 3 strums from her 2nd loop, but this video was meant to be a quickie.   That, and Leo's sax is really loud compared to Meryl's violin and drowned out a few of her notes. I didn't level out the audio, they were recorded at the same volume they were on the old Mother 4 video.  Guess that's another reason why they needed changing."
mother4,30q1p6,Ghostmasks,3,Mon Mar 30 14:03:34 2015 UTC,"This seems to be a hot topic these past few weeks!  Thanks for uploading this video. It really reconfirms to me that they made a huge improvement with the current jingle.  In my opinion, the current level up arrangements sound complete even when singled-out and are also more cohesive when played together -- they create an uplifting song. Some of the old jingles sound unfinished when played alone. And when played together , the melodies fight each other a little bit for attention instead of working together, thus struggle to create a strong groove.  edit: Grammar and words"

Then Mother 4 has shown so much amazing potential.  I really can't wait to play it, it looks like its as high of quality as the main Mother games. :)  For now, I've got Shadows of Mordor to hold me over, but when M4 is released... :)"

mother4,30lhbg,Orion78762,8,Sat Mar 28 13:16:50 2015 UTC,"Well, you may actually be on the wrong sub for this question; Mother 4 is an upcoming fan game taking place in the Mother series, not a canon game. You may want to head to /r/earthbound if you are interested in getting started in the Mother series proper.  The mechanics of the Mother series battles consist of pretty standard turn based RPG fare. Fight option, some characters have ""magic"" called PSI. There are no multiplayer battles though, like Pokemon, and the Mother games in general are much more story driven than battle driven, like Pokemon.  Hopefully this information helps. Either way, the Mother series is one of the best game series in gaming, so you should definitely check it out!"
mother4,30lhbg,pr0jectpat,3,Sat Mar 28 13:57:56 2015 UTC,"Well...in Mother, you, a random teen minding his business, go on an adventure with friends to stop people that are changing society for the worse.  Many normal people/animals/things suddenly become hostile toward you, and you need to Bash/Shoot them, maybe using PSI.  A staple of Mother is that at least half the party knows PSI, or ""psionics."" You can make things spontaneously combust, freeze, you can even make a deadly storm of shooting stars around you!  The non-psychic member(s) of the party have a lot of tools to make up for it. Bottle rockets, HP suckers, smoke bombs - and much more!  And then you relax and talk to a random person that says, ""My wife left me. I'm such a lucky man!"" or ""A man came to the hospital asking to get a haircut. He must've thought a bad hair day could be cured here or something!""  That sums it up pretty well in my opinion. Is that what you were looking for?"

I am really looking forward to exploring towns and talking to NPCs and running all over the map.  I loved Mother 3 but was a bit disappointed that is was divided up into chapters....kinda messed with the feeling of progression and immediacy that I like in my RPGs.

mother4,30e5ms,DragonDePlatino,2,Thu Mar 26 21:10:14 2015 UTC,That's a real shame these aren't in an actual game. The creator of this should totally find a way to get these into a game (perhaps Mother 5? lol)

mother4,30e5ms,101239,-9,Sun Mar 29 15:48:14 2015 UTC,i think it would be cool to have a goatse-goatse statue instead of a mani-mani that you fight.

mother4,30ahwk,Destro_,7,Wed Mar 25 20:15:24 2015 UTC,I personally would like to see refresh from Mother 3 come back. It saved me from death so many times.

It was so useful throughout game in EB since Ness kept losing his PP rapidly after using PSI [Cool thing]. On the other hand, it was incredibly annoying when enemies used it... ;_;  Also, Teleport α/β might be a nice thing depending on the story/map of Mother 4."
mother4,30ahwk,tasteface,4,Wed Mar 25 23:57:27 2015 UTC,Ness never learns PSI Magnet!

mother4,30ahwk,XeniKobalt,3,Thu Mar 26 12:37:22 2015 UTC,"I honestly would love Teleport to come back. It's what I missed in Mother 3, but it wasn't necessary for it to be there. I hope that this game makes it almost necessary for it to be there because it was extremely fun to teleport from place to place, not to mention useful."
mother4,30ahwk,pr0jectpat,2,Thu Mar 26 00:13:07 2015 UTC,"Teleport possibly won't be in the game, due to 4th-D Slip being confirmed to be in it, instead!"
mother4,30ahwk,XeniKobalt,1 point,Thu Mar 26 07:27:39 2015 UTC,"To me, that comment doesn't reference there being no teleport. This basically just says that you will be able to access previously inaccessible areas; nothing about teleporting from town to town.  If I was a betting man, I would bet on teleport being in. This is, after all, a fan game that is proclaimed as a ""love letter"" to the series. Kind of hard to not add one of the most loved features of Earthbound."
mother4,30ahwk,KiraYoshikage,2,Thu Mar 26 13:50:57 2015 UTC,"There's a very good point! I did say it possibly might not be around, but you're definitely on point with the difference in abilities."
mother4,30ahwk,MinecraftManMike,3,Thu Mar 26 15:56:33 2015 UTC,Pretty sure the nameable PSI is guaranteed to return. Is 4th D Slip is gonna return? Or was that just a joke?
mother4,30ahwk,Rockto_AP,0,Wed Mar 25 22:57:33 2015 UTC,"Joke? I liked 4th D Slip, lol. EB0 had some nice PSI abilities."
mother4,30ahwk,ArmoredChocobo,-1,Fri Mar 27 04:27:21 2015 UTC,Did you notice that each character has a favorite thing? That means they'll probably all have PSI (Thing).
mother4,30ahwk,Dancing_Anatolia,4,Wed Mar 25 23:10:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. Floyd doesn't have any PSI abilities, and they seem to have stayed true to the Mother franchise so far. I don't think giving each character a PSI (favorite thing) would be favorable."
mother4,30ahwk,ArmoredChocobo,3,Wed Mar 25 23:13:45 2015 UTC,"Return: PK Ground, PK Magnet, PK Counter (both), PK Teleport  Keep out: EB0's PK Fire Omega, EB0's PK Freeze Gamma (or leave it as enemy skill only)  Those two PSI abilities made fighting enemies and bosses way too easy. Fire Omega insta-killed entire enemy packs, and Freeze Gamma drops ANYTHING but Giygas/R7038(& XX) to critical hp.  They were a god-send in EB0 though, with how strong the enemies are on Mt. Itoi."
mother4,30ahwk,Ryonne,1 point,Fri Mar 27 01:55:56 2015 UTC,Isn't Ground kind of overpowered too? It dealt 5% of an enemy's health (Making it very effective against bosses) and could make enemies fall over.
mother4,30ahwk,Lucas5655,1 point,Sat Mar 28 01:18:16 2015 UTC,"You still had to use Ground several times to beat a boss.  PK Fire Omega killed anything that wasn't a boss, and PK Freeze Gamma made every normal boss a 2-shot.   There's a definite line between ""strong"" and ""OP"" getting crossed here."
mother4,30ahwk,Ness6464,2,Sat Mar 28 02:36:28 2015 UTC,"I personally wouldn't want to see PK Ground make a comeback. It made pretty much every boss in Mother 3 a cakewalk (even Porky; I mean, if a single move makes the final boss too easy, you know there's something wrong). However, I'm definitely looking forward to how they'll update PK Starstorm."
mother4,30ahwk,onion_cat,3,Thu Mar 26 06:03:34 2015 UTC,"PK Starstorm is almost a given. Knowing how much dedication this team has, there is no way it won't be in the game, so yes. I would love to see how they update it. I love PSI animations."
mother4,30ahwk,ArmoredChocobo,2,Thu Mar 26 06:39:13 2015 UTC,I personally didn't find out about ground until messing around fighting stuff after I beat the game. It just seems too broken to come back. Otherwise I'm fine with anything as long as it's balanced.
mother4,30ahwk,MikeAlex01,1 point,Fri Mar 27 21:04:21 2015 UTC,"Quickup would be awesome if they added an extra ability to make it not useless, such as the player ALWAYS goes first against party members AND enemys. Whaddaya guys think?"
mother4,30ahwk,packagegrope,3,Wed Mar 25 21:05:02 2015 UTC,"I could see that being taken advantage of if it ensured that the party always went first. But it would be nice to always ensure that ""you healed this person"" first or gave them certain item first before they attacked."
mother4,309s75,jgestenson,3,Wed Mar 25 17:10:46 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but I'm curious as to what the in game tutorials are going to say about the buttons. Will it recognize if I use a PS3/PS4 controller and replace all those buttons with an X or O or will it only work with a 360? Or will it try and use SNES controls? I don't know. I hope the game devs could answer this."
mother4,309s75,Destro_,-1,Wed Mar 25 18:15:15 2015 UTC,"PS3/PS4 controllers aren't compatible with PC unless you emulate them to act as Xbox 360 controllers. And most modern games recognize those, so I would hope Mother 4 will, as well!"

mother4,2zvgjn,Ghostmasks,2,Sun Mar 22 04:02:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for uploading! I personally like the new jingle better. I also think it's more appropriate.  The new theme to me is much tighter in its production and melody. It's simply much more focused and self-aware; which makes it more of an earworm.  I definitely imagine the new theme being played as the team pick themselves up after a night boss battle -- each person's instrument kicking in just as they walk on-screen, patting rubble off of themselves.  Now that I think about it... I really wish Mother would have some sort of anime adaptation or something."
mother4,2zvgjn,Destro_,1 point,Fri Mar 27 00:44:50 2015 UTC,I really wish I knew why they changed this to the current one; this one was so good.

mother4,2zvgjn,Hush009,1 point,Mon Mar 23 04:20:46 2015 UTC,I actually personally like the bass better than the percussion. A song doesn't sound right without the root note.

Floyd could use batons or some preppy thing. Meryl could stick with frying pans because she doesn't seem like she'd use gloves or boots. Maybe she could use a rapier or something else. Anyway, I AM SO HYPED FOR THIS GAME."

mother4,2zuom3,captainth,2,Sun Mar 22 05:17:46 2015 UTC,I can't see Leo using swords really. I think guns or broadweapons suit him better.

mother4,2zuom3,Destro_,3,Sun Mar 22 21:35:52 2015 UTC,"How great would it be if instead of buying a weapon for him, the game made you keep his weapon slot empty, but in the text box it would say different objects. Something like stop signs, rocks, cinder blocks, pipe, trash can, or fence post."
mother4,2zuom3,Dancing_Anatolia,1 point,Mon Mar 23 03:23:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd assume Leo would use more impromptu weapons. Even if he doesn't, I can't imagine him using a real sword in (Basically) America in the 1970's."

I had  Travis; Pitching a ball weapon/Baseball  Meryl; Boots/Kicks (comparable to duster having shoes. although unlikely) the other thing I had was: Purses,Bag/Fail weapon.  Floyd; FakeGuns/Pistolwhips(idk maybe effects his negotiating tact)  Leo ""Luster""lol; Broadweapons/Swords and Knives  ( idk perhaps there's weapons he can purchase and ones he can't.)"
mother4,2zuom3,Dancing_Anatolia,1 point,Sun Mar 22 13:34:25 2015 UTC,"Well, I imagine Floyd to be the Poo/Boney of the game and only get one weapon. Maybe that weapon can be something like a tire iron since his favorite thing is race cars. As for Meryl, she may just be given the trademark frying pan weapons."
mother4,2zuom3,bluebreeze52,3,Sun Mar 22 00:45:02 2015 UTC,"Then again, I wouldn't imagine Floyd only having one weapon, considering that means he'd have to use his hands the rest of the time. I wouldn't imagine a super rich, likely spoiled, child would be good at hand-to-hand combat."
mother4,2zuom3,bluebreeze52,2,Sun Mar 22 01:49:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly. As we see in the trailer, his attacks are pretty weak. He seems like he'd be used more for his Talk ability."
mother4,2zuom3,bluebreeze52,2,Sun Mar 22 03:14:57 2015 UTC,"I can see Floyd w/ no weapon being a thing, and him just having no weapon and then all of a sudden acquires a golden Magnum, or  something like that. I still can't see Meryl having a Frying pan though, I was thinking perhaps kicks, like boots or shoes. It might be fun, although her favorite thing is ""Pond skating.""

The game in the actual console never had any of that ;p Since Mother 4 will released straight up for PC, I highly doubt they will implement a Save/Load state device. You'll have to save it the old way, it seems. and honestly, I never really had to use Save/Load in the middle of battles and dungeons.

mother4,2ztv0g,pr0jectpat,0,Sat Mar 21 21:42:12 2015 UTC,here's a tip to designing a video game: make it accessable to as many people as possible.
mother4,2ztv0g,Lucas5655,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:00:17 2015 UTC,Here's a tip regarding design as a whole: It's not a requirement. There will always be products with mass appeal and others that fill a niche. The Mother series fills a niche. The way roleplaying games work in general is through trial and error and grinding. Simply because you yourself require save states doesn't mean everyone else does.
mother4,2ztv0g,Lucas5655,0,Thu Mar 26 06:13:44 2015 UTC,"as i said before, you don't NEED save states, anyway, i am quitting the MOTHER 4 community... you guys are too rude so i'm gonna get to work on my Goku-free Smash Bros. fangame of which i planned to include Travis, but now, Lucas will take his place..."
mother4,2ztv0g,TrokStop,1 point,Thu Mar 26 06:55:30 2015 UTC,"Save states weren't there in the first place. They're just a consequence of running on an emulator. So as you said yourself, save states aren't needed in the game at all.  I'm sure the Mother 4 team is devastated you won't include him."
mother4,2ztv0g,TrokStop,1 point,Thu Mar 26 07:10:44 2015 UTC,"With how you keep saying that you don't have to use them, I have one thing to say about that: When the option is there I use it whether I want to or not, because of how simple it makes things for me, what starts as, ""I might as well make a state here because dying now would REALLY set me back."" becomes ""Oh, I've used up all of the save slots..."" I hate save states because of how easily accessible they are, with almost no risk that makes the game fun. So, no. M4 Team. please do not add the save states."

mother4,2zj93s,CaptainCrisby,6,Thu Mar 19 02:44:53 2015 UTC,You're on the list. I apologize for the confusion. You wouldn't receive a NEW email. The 'already on the list' is good enough. The one and only official email you will receive from us is the 'launch email.'   I hope that clears things up.

mother4,2z5fhc,ArmoredChocobo,-2,Sun Mar 15 21:55:29 2015 UTC,The Mother 3 guide is sold without Nintendo's ok.
mother4,2z5fhc,equalsign,1 point,Mon Mar 16 09:57:27 2015 UTC,Pretty sure it was.
mother4,2z5fhc,ArmoredChocobo,0,Mon Mar 16 14:23:35 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure what was? Nintendo gave no permission for the Mother 3 Handbook. It says so right on the product page:   MOTHER 3’s game and scenario © 2006 SHIGESATO ITOI and Nintendo Co, Ltd. Fangamer LLC is not affiliated with SHIGESATO ITOI, Nintendo Co, Ltd. or any other entity involved with the development or publishing of MOTHER 3. All trademarks, tradenames, and copyrights are property of their respective owners, none of whom endorse, sponsor or authorize this guide."
mother4,2z5fhc,equalsign,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:39:38 2015 UTC,"""Not affiliated"" means that the people that made it and are selling it are not working under Nintendo or Itoi, and the last part basically says ""Nintendo or Itoi didn't pay us to make this, nor had a hand in making it"".  Nintendo would have raised a very big stink if they weren't told ""Hey, we're making this. You cool?"".  It's the very same thing that went on with the translation of Mother 3. They said that if Nintendo had ANY problems, they'd stop. Obviously, Nintendo didn't have any problems.  And even if your point IS true, my point stands that we should not be charging people a strategy guide to a game that was released for free. That's just rude and greedy."
mother4,2z5fhc,ArmoredChocobo,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:41:34 2015 UTC,"It doesn't just say ""not affiliated."" It also states the the guide is neither authorized nor endorsed by Nintendo. Nintendo's silence is not an endorsement.   Nintendo probably would not have raised a big stink if they ""weren't told."" Throwing a global company a 'heads up' has basically no effect on whether they choose to enforce their rights and patents. I have no idea what signals you've seen to suggest that Nintendo wants or cares about a heads up.   The fact that Nintendo did not stop the development of Mother 3's translation is completely irrelevant to the topic we're talking about.   The Mother 3 community created a guide and sold it for money. That is no different than the Mother 4 community creating a guide and selling it for money.   It's an accessory to the game, and it's not rude or greedy to charge for it. It is not required for play. There will be other FAQs and ways to get help if you get stuck. The previous guides were not just for help getting through the game. They helped build the world and were filled with original artwork.   Even fewer of Nintendo's rights and patents would be infringed with a Mother 4 guide. The Mother 3 characters and in-game artwork were actually created by Nintendo.  A Mother 4 guide would be a huge effort. It would involve artists, sculptors, writers, and graphic designers. Those people would probably like to be paid, and there's nothing immoral about paying them if they've created a product you like. Would it be wrong to charge for a figurine of the in game characters? Or a t-shirt with a print related to the game? No, and it wouldn't be wrong to charge for a detailed and beautiful guide/handbook either."

Not only do I want to do this because I like EarthBound as a whole, but also for two other reasons, to practice my writing skills, and to do something more productive than George Bush ever did during his whole term.

mother4,2z2ick,CaptainCrisby,20,Sat Mar 14 23:29:24 2015 UTC,Shane Mesa kind of seems like he likes a lot of attention.
mother4,2z2ick,DeviantGrayson,5,Sun Mar 15 05:59:41 2015 UTC,"It's reasonable to believe that some of the pieces of music went unused because they were replaced by music that Shane thought was better.  This ""500 likes for content"" thing might be a cry for attention maybe. But it also could be a smart move. Many artists are cautious to release their ""lesser"" works because it could potentially stain their reputation for future potential fans (the same way video game footage leaks can damage future fans).   Asking for people to agree that they actually want the music is a good way of making this artistic gamble a little safer for the future of his own career.  Just some food for thought."

Like I said, I'm not too sure how hard this would be to do but it would make it a lot easier for people to be able to access other languages from the official team."

mother4,2yyds4,Shrinefox,6,Mon Apr 20 04:59:39 2015 UTC,"Stickied.  I was going to make a thread like this, and was even considering making an entirely different subreddit, but I got lazy.  EDIT: To anyone planning to assemble a translation team, I suggest using Slack. It's a communication platform used for online projects. It's almost like having your own personal twitter, and a file sharing service.   Fun Fact: The Mother 4 Team uses Slack, and have been using Slack for quite a while. They said ""For communication, we use (and love) Slack.""  EDIT #2: Finally! Somebody offered to translate it to Japanese!  Maybe if we give them Mother 4 they'll give us Mother 3. Hopefully? Maybe?  EDIT #3: I posted this to Starmen. It's kind of cool seeing people native to the Starmen Forums collaborating on Reddit."

Yes, I'd like to join the Russian translation team.  My English skills are at Pre-Intermediate level. My grammar may suck, but I'm very good at reading and chatting, so there won't be a single problem for me of understanding the game or speaking to the staff about unclear moments in the text.  As a native Russian's, my Russian skills are more than enough to do translation.  I hope I can help bringing Russian version of Mother 4 closer to the reality :)"

mother4,2yyds4,iannoah440,1 point,Sat Mar 21 15:34:09 2015 UTC,"We kunnen net als de makers het programma ""Slack"" gebruiken. Het is heel handig om te kunnen communiceren en om bestanden over te geven, dus ook de teksten! Het eerste wat we moeten vertalen is de tekst van de items en de Battle UI ( tekst tijdens een gevecht) en later pas beginnen aan het echte werk. En over de taken zien we wel als het spel af is oja, ik begin pas met vertalen als ik het spel heb uitgespeeld want ik ben bang dat ik dan teksten verkeerd ga begrijpen.  We kunnen ook Skype en dropbox gebruiken, dat lijkt mij makkelijker."
mother4,2yyds4,TopHatHipster,2,Sun Mar 22 13:19:21 2015 UTC,"Wel, ik snap het idee wel van Slack gebruiken, maar ik voel me daardoor niet zo veilig. Kunnen we niet gewoon de vertalingen naar elkaar sturen via Reddit? Door PM's?"

mother4,2yyds4,Gonzool,1 point,Fri Mar 20 15:40:14 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I played Mother 3 on a GBA emulator just now, and I noticed that pretty much ALL dialogues are in Hiragana and Katakana. There are no Kanji (except in the scrolling text thing at the end of each chapter). I think adding characters will be a standard part of the translation tool since it'll be the same for other languages like Russian or Swedish.  Total amount of required characters will probably be 160: 80 Hiragana incl. small chars (46 standard, 25 extra for g/z/d/b/p, 3 small ys, 5 small vowels, and 1 for っ), *2 for Katakana looking at this chart.  EDIT: 165. Forgot about ー (in words like マザー and コーヒー), fullstop (。) + comma (、), and quote marks (「」)"

I don't think the feeling of being chased down is a sensation I want in an Earthbound-type game.  Also, looks like a few of those screenshots look like those that were in some Mother 4 screenshots, especially the ones in the city. It almost looks like the streets that Leo was driving across in the trailer."
mother4,2yy4iq,ArmoredChocobo,2,Sat Mar 14 01:25:02 2015 UTC,I disagree.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUsMVpAEESI
mother4,2yy4iq,ArmoredChocobo,0,Sat Mar 14 02:05:48 2015 UTC,"I still see the similarities, even though that Eagleland is based off SNES graphics and Mother 4 is GBA.  I'm not saying they ripped the game off, it's just that they look similar. Especially that corner restaurant in the slums.  Also, that music in the slums. Holy crap, I felt depressed. I think they went a little too far off the track with that. Itoi likes to say ""Travel the world, the world is great! Life is great!"", this one seems to say ""How society is sucks and you should feel bad about that"". I mean heck, compare the music playing when Leo's driving around to Northpoint slums.   I do like the dichotomy of the happy, shiny uptown and the miserable slums, but it felt less like I was watching a Mother fangame and more like I was watching something harder and edgier like LISA.   The ducks look and walk alike, but the quacking doesn't quite match up, and as we all know, the Mother series was as much environmental as it was the humor."
mother4,2yy4iq,NachoGrande96,2,Sat Mar 14 02:33:53 2015 UTC,"I think the restaurant was more intended to be reminiscent of Seinfeld than Mother 4, now that I look at it"
mother4,2yy4iq,dillonEh,1 point,Mon Mar 16 17:27:51 2015 UTC,"The graphics are similar because they're both well-done examples of what an urban area would look like in a Mother game. Not to mention the stuff from Eagleland was released long before the Mother 4 trailer, so definitely no copying there.  And Eagleland doesn't have to feel just like a Mother game because it's not aspiring to be a spiritual successor to the series. Not all fangames are going to be just like Mother 4, nor should they be held to the same standards."
mother4,2yy4iq,ArmoredChocobo,1 point,Sat Mar 14 12:44:28 2015 UTC,"Which is why I'd try it, because every Mother game trying to be exactly like Mother would be boring.  But the whole Hunted-down thing feels to me a bit off when we're talking about a Mother fangame made by a mother fan."
mother4,2yy4iq,ImmutableObject,2,Sat Mar 14 16:11:04 2015 UTC,"I think the being chased, if explained by the story well and not so overpowering that you are unable to do any exploring would actually be really neat."
mother4,2yy4iq,ArmoredChocobo,1 point,Sat Mar 14 02:41:40 2015 UTC,"That'd be the deciding factor with me is how strict the game is with that internal timer.  I definitely wouldn't want to miss out on something because I was forced to move on or lose. It just doesn't fit the feel of the Mother series to have something in place that intentionally stops you from enjoying the environment and exploring. That's the reason Mother's so good to begin with.  That kind of pacing just doesn't work on an RPG, either, unless it's relevant like running from an exploding building. Even then, that's usually brief and not all-encompassing."
mother4,2yy4iq,roachslayer,1 point,Sat Mar 14 02:44:25 2015 UTC,"Roach here, allow me to clarify a few things. One, the 2024 comment was indeed a joke, since the game is still quite far from release. I don't set dates. This game is being made by 2 people, not a team like mother 4.  Armoredchocobo you seem to be quite confused. That video is clearly a map test not gameplay footage. Which would explain why the party is walking by cops and people etc. North point city is quite far into the game and you have to take measures to conceal yourself at that point, especially in the fancy Upton district. Also, did you really think all the presents are going to be randomized? I was just showing off a rare new type of gift box I'm including, which I have several types of. Obviously there will be way more normal gift boxes than these. Geez, I figured that was self explanatory.  That's funny you compare those two shots of our cities and say mine looks like it's out of mother 4 when I released my video a year ago and screenshots even earlier. I figured people to make these assumptions though. I thibk the graphical styles differ enough personally, but I don't expect everyone to make the distinction. As for the story, or this internal timer you referred to idk where you got that from. A sense of danger and being the target of the villain will in no way limit your exploration time or anything. This game is really ramping up the exploration and secrets just in a slightly more exciting way in my opinion.  If you want more of the same Earthbound stuff I'm sure mother 4 will oblige. I'm not making a direct sequel, and I plan on trying to break some new ground. It will be set j. The same eagleland universe which I plan on really fleshing out. I draw some cool connections to the series but not in a ham fisted way.  So yeah, keep checking in everyone. And once its released, and if you get bored, give Eagleland a chance. I think mother4 looks cool, and I'm not trying to take anything away from them , but I've been planning and creating gfx for this game just as long and I'm gonna keep doing my own thing. Support the underdog."
mother4,2yy4iq,ArmoredChocobo,1 point,Tue Mar 24 06:23:53 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about the boxes in your starmen.net post. The red boxes were said to contain random items.  With the timer, it was implied that the government or whatever is hunting you down, which led me to assume if you spend too much time somewhere they will catch up, thus an internal timer pushing you along.  I am curious how you'll instill a sense of urgency or tension without that pressure, though.  Though like you said, this is a game that's gonna be long in the making, but I'll keep an eye out."
mother4,2yy4iq,roachslayer,1 point,Tue Mar 24 15:17:00 2015 UTC,"Thats like assuming if you spend too long in an area in Earthbound, Giygas's allies will catch up to you.  Its part of THE STORY. The sense of urgency and tension come from the way events play out.  You progress at your own pace, of course, like in any RPG."
mother4,2yy4iq,ArmoredChocobo,0,Tue Mar 24 19:19:05 2015 UTC,"Never in Earthbound is it implied that Giygas is after you, he's too busy trying to take over the world to focus on 4 kids."

From now on, you'll be fighting enemies sent by Giygas, as well as humans who have evil thoughts. They'll definitely make trouble during your adventure! Animals are also becoming violent due to Giygas' influence over the evil in their minds! It is the truth, so listen!""  Quote from Buzz Buzz in the intro of the game. Giygas sends a Starman to assassinate Buzz Buzz, who is protecting and shielding Ness and Pokey (who later joins him)  You're trying to say that Giygas is too busy ""trying to take over the world"" to go after 4 kids, yeah I don't think so.  Not only does Giygas enlist Pokey, Ness's neighbor and friend to join his side...He (through the Mani Mani statue) possesses Carpainter to KIDNAP PAULA, one of those 4 Kids, for an alleged human sacrifice.  Let's see what else-  He has the Zombie Chick and Monsters in Threed jump you in a hotel, and throw you into a dungeon under the cemetary.  In Fourside one of Giygas's ALIEN HENCHMEN KIDNAPS PAULA AGAIN, in the department story, and directly calls out Ness in a challenge.  You could even argue that Giygas (through the Mani Mani) created the entirety of Moonside to trap and kill you, and prevent you from ever leaving fourside.   And before you say these things arent Giygas directly going after the party, I realize he doesnt have a physical form yet, which would be why he acts through the Mani Mani, Pokey, and other henchmen.  So REALLY? Giygas isn't after the chosen 4?  You don't have to like my idea of being hunted by a physical villain, but to assert that is just plain wrong."
mother4,2yy4iq,ArmoredChocobo,0,Tue Mar 24 22:20:44 2015 UTC,"They're not specifically after Ness and friends, if they were, they'd have sent starmen into their bedrooms and killed them.  Buzz buzz was warning them that Giygas's minions were already at work, and they'll definitely get in the way as they work towards him.  Remember what Pokey said, Giygas is a mindless entity of pure evil now. He was more likely attracted to Pokey's misery of being a harshly abused little boy with no friends and corrupt parents. He was an evil power magnet. This is confirmed by Itoi.  So Giygas didn't exactly want him because he lived next to Ness, that was merely a coincidence.  As for Carpainter, he wanted Paula to become his priestess, you learn this as you talk around town. he wanted to use and brainwash Paula due to her psychic powers. The ""sacrifice"" thing was only mentioned by Everdred because he had no idea.  The Zombie Chick and the undead are 2nd hand minions. Belch was put in place to take over Threed, and Belch in turn used the Zombies to menace it. Ness and Paula were locked up for meddling in Belch's affairs. If they were the actual targets, they'd have been killed. Instead they were just put ""out of the way"".  As for the Moonside ""trap"", I don't buy it. Why would Giygas trap a particular shelf in the cafe where Ness wouldn't bother without a clue from a neutral source (Everdred)? It's merely an alternate world created by the Mani-Mani statues, sorta like a psychic fallout zone.  The dept store spook knew about Ness and Paula because they let themselves be known. They already subverted one Mani-Mani by this point, pretty good attention-getter.  Finally, I don't think Giygas had an active hand in a lot of things. From the Your Sanctuary locations to the Mani Mani, it all seems like an attempt at territorial occupation and safeguarding more than it was a hunt for 4 kids. You were less avoiding Giygas's minions and more sucker-punching or meddling and foiling evil plans that didn't really involve you till you started swinging a bat at it.  Lets not forget that Giygas was a giant ball of powerful, but stupid, energy. An almighty idiot, as Porky put it. He didn't have the mental faculties to set traps and pull strings. Everything was just set into place and left to their own devices (such as Belch doing not much but manufacturing fly honey) until Ness and friends uprooted it. I man hell, they walked right into the Stonehenge Base and Starman Deluxe just sat there and waited till they got to the control room and monologued at them. Not exactly man-hunting behavior."
mother4,2yy4iq,luckjes112,1 point,Tue Mar 24 23:06:57 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda curious what it's about, though. I mean, besides the setting, what does it have to do with Earthbound? (also, I checked out your Youtube channel. You're pretty entertaining!)"
mother4,2yy4iq,ArmoredChocobo,1 point,Fri Mar 20 17:04:52 2015 UTC,"That's a very good question.  The Mother games were usually about ""Let's take over the world! Oh, those kids? They're no threat, they're just kids"" with them uttering the phrase ""How the heck did 4 kids beat us?"" about 10-20 hours later.  Now this game the bad guy is saying ""We need to kill this one particular kid and nothing else!"".   Why is the supposed President hunting down the main protagonist anyway? Goverment cover-up? I think there's a lot more better and quieter ways to do that than a man-hunt.  Why is this man-hunting operation so inept that this kid can go roaming through towns for hours or days, making friends and having adventures, and not get ambushed by Seal Team 6 or whatever Eagleland's equivalent is?   How come he walks past tons of people and police officers and no one's saying ""Hey, it's that kid! Let's grab him so we get that $E 1,000,000 reward!""?  I'd like more details on what exactly this story's gonna be about.  I get he wants to keep this air of secrecy, but even Earthbound's reviews directly state the antagonist's intentions. He can't even say something like ""He ran across something he shouldn't have"" and that's the reason why he's getting hunted?"
mother4,2yy4iq,luckjes112,1 point,Fri Mar 20 18:44:36 2015 UTC,"Well, Earthbound's story is a tad deeper than that. Giyig saw his demise to Ness in the Apple of Enlightenment. He tried doing everything in his power to stop that fate from unfolding. He lost his physical form and became an unfathomable aura of psychic power, losing his mind in the process, just to be able to avert that fate. The more you look at it, and the more you research and read into it: The more you'll learn that the series has a really intricate and complicated plot."
mother4,2yy4iq,ArmoredChocobo,1 point,Fri Mar 20 18:54:52 2015 UTC,"You know, that's one thing I always wanted Itoi to explain.  What the HELL is the Apple of Enlightenment? They only mention it at the very end of the game, and the mention is more like ""Yeah, it's a thing. Have you heard of it? No? Oh well, just take my word for it."" and Ness's party is like ""It's an apple? Well, I guess we should believe that, I never met a dishonest apple."""

I think the Apple of Enlightenment is just an artifact that works similiar to a witches' crystal orb."

I haven't noticed any other real world musical references yet (besides the ones from previous games like Humoresque of a Little Dog and Enjoy Your Stay), but there are a lot of references to music from Mother 1 and 2. Battle Against a Familiar Foe sounds recognizable because it is composed of a wide variety of samples from Mother 2, such as Moonside Swing, The Place, Inside the Dungeon, Battle Against a Weak Opponent and other battle themes. (fitting music for when fighting returning enemies)"

mother4,2yv2jl,Rockto_AP,3,Fri Mar 13 01:25:22 2015 UTC,"APE became Creatures, which assisted GameFreak with making Pokemon.  Also, X and Y are 3D games, not character sprites. Also, where have you played a Mother game where the characters could be customized (other than the dropped Earthbound 64, which only applied to no-name NPCs anyway).  I think they're going more for imitating Itoi instead of imitating any of the co-development companies (Ape, Pax-Softnica, Brownie Brown, Hal)."
mother4,2yv2jl,ArmoredChocobo,1 point,Fri Mar 13 02:25:22 2015 UTC,"Speaking of which: Earthbound 64 Fan Version should be made. Apparently it had, both gameplay-wise and story-wise, quite some differences."
mother4,2yv2jl,luckjes112,1 point,Fri Mar 20 18:23:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, really.  For one, the game was only half-completed before they bailed on it on a combination of Itoi and Hal's production teams not being skilled enough to make a good 3D game that'd hold the charm as much as it's reincarnation Mother 3 did and the fact that the N64 disk drive turned out to be a bad idea.  For two, I really don't want to see a 3D Mother game. The environment is just right set in a 16-bit 2 1/2D sprite formula. It just wouldn't feel right.   Not every game needs to be made with 3D, popping out of your screen, super-deluxe HD graphics."

In Mother 4, you'll probably need to go to a mailbox to mail a postcard.  While EarthBound WAS developed by APE, Pokémon X and Y aren't very pixelated, y'know? :-)  Aaaand that's it."

Ness eventually ""gets over"" getting homesick, or at least the chance becomes very slim, by gaining enough levels: about level 50 or so he stops getting homesick, even if you stop calling home.  It's like Ness grows up a little by that point and he knows he's doing this for the sake of his home town, thus he doesn't get homesick anymore because he has a purpose.

mother4,2ylkej,CzarSquid,8,Tue Mar 10 22:12:16 2015 UTC,"Characters are a stupid reason seeing as the series doesn't have many people return in general, especially the main characters. Itoi is the mastermind of the series so I can see why some would be wary of the game since he's not in it ,but you can't underestimate them. The insults are just cheap. The legality issue also applies to the whole Mother series outside of Earthbound so that's stupid. Lastly the fact that they delayed it probably means more mother goodness so that's a bad argument. Outside of the Itoi thing these are stupid arguments. Personally, I am in the position of having hyped skepticism for the game. I wonder if it holds up ,but so far it's looking good to me."

mother4,2ylkej,SageWaterDragon,1 point,Fri Mar 20 18:11:41 2015 UTC,"For EarthBound Zero, I always thought that ""EarthBound: Origins"" would be a cool subtitle, since you find out how Giygas was raised and how that made him bitter towards the human race. As for EarthBound, ""Giygas Strikes Back"" is an obvious choice. For Mother 3, if they ever bring it to Virtual Console, I think that ""EarthBound: The Invasion of Nowhere"" would be good since Porky's invasion is what sets off the whole tragedy. Or possibly ""EarthBound: Tragic Reconstruction,"" since Porky is trying to remake what he remembers life being like in Eagleland (as well as other warped, creepy things), but hurting loads of people in the process.  They probably wouldn't want to change any names, though, and Mother really is the most appropriate title for Mother 3 ;("

Anything else was probably either just trolling or some 12-year old that doesn't know what they're talking about.   Second, you're proving my point by still defending this shit and shitting on this strawman you're building up.

Today, I think Nintendo would be a bit more willing to have a more faithful translation and representation of Mother 3, from the Magypsies to swears, I mean, they're backed Bayonetta 2 for goodness sake.

I just hope Travis isn't the only healer, as others mentioned Meryl lacking support PSI. Or maybe Leo will heal this time around. I'd still take 3 PSI users over M3's 2 PSI user system, as Boney and Duster felt lacking in their abilities."
mother4,2yih29,bluebreeze52,2,Tue Mar 10 02:57:23 2015 UTC,"I think Travis should be the healer, Meryl the attack, and have Leo basically be half of both."
mother4,2yih29,PSICoffee,2,Tue Mar 10 04:51:46 2015 UTC,I always used Duster's Scary Mask on all the bosses. That thing was useful.
mother4,2yih29,roytheshort,3,Tue Mar 10 18:18:23 2015 UTC,"I believe they said the battles were in the debug room, which made the UI a bit screwy."
mother4,2yih29,Dancing_Anatolia,3,Tue Mar 10 03:59:44 2015 UTC,"Meryl is definitely the Kumayora of the group, mostly offensive status PSI, but im pretty sure the game will be advanced enough to be able to scroll down, lets hope"
mother4,2yih29,KayShyGuy,3,Tue Mar 10 05:07:33 2015 UTC,by offensive psi do you mean psi that uses racial slurs and stuff?

mother4,2yhu3f,KayShyGuy,3,Mon Mar 9 22:53:48 2015 UTC,"Battle animations in Mother 3 (and presumably Mother 4) aren't nearly as long as pokemon animations though. And the games aren't nearly as much of a grind fest either. That combined with rhythm combos, I think it'd be pointless and confusing to turn off the animations. I mean I guess it wouldn't hurt to have the option but I'd never use it."

mother4,2yhu3f,ArmoredChocobo,3,Tue Mar 10 01:20:56 2015 UTC,"First of all that gif wasn't all PK Beam omega, it was more like PK Beam Beta, Gamma, AND Omega in one loop."

mother4,2yhu3f,ArmoredChocobo,2,Tue Mar 10 00:57:37 2015 UTC,"Ive actually been wondering if there was another way to change the day to night besides paying $35 at a hotel, hmm interesting thought"
mother4,2yhu3f,power464646,2,Tue Mar 10 01:17:55 2015 UTC,"I suggest that if it doesn't already, use the Earthbound style of winning battles vs the Mother 3 one.  I liked using auto-wins to get in some quick levels."
mother4,2yhu3f,spritefuser,0,Tue Mar 10 02:48:25 2015 UTC,"They were effective, but auto wins were jumpy and kind of broke immersion for me."
mother4,2yhu3f,Pie-jacker875,2,Wed Mar 11 07:53:23 2015 UTC,"An option to swap the overworld's music with music from older games would be nice. For example, after using this option, hotel music sounds like that of EarthBound, if the music is set to EarthBound. Or boss themes would change accordingly to the chosen music option as well. I think you understand what I'm saying; the same principal as Rune Factory 4's option to revert the in-game music to music from 1, 2 or 3. This would, however, be a problem for battles, if we're considering the rhythm combos. However if it's changed to music from Mother 3, we wouldn't quite have that problem. At the least, it'd be interesting to be able to switch the sounds of the rhythm attacks to those of Mother 3's sounds."

mother4,2yhu3f,Rockto_AP,1 point,Sat Mar 14 03:26:42 2015 UTC,"It would be neat if they could implement an item encyclopedia like what they had in Chrono Trigger DS. That way completionists/Collectors can finally have a feeling of satisfaction for collecting ALL items in the game. Also, so u can know how far you are in finishing, they can use percentage system like: half of the items collected=50% completed. And for the rest of items they can have questions marks. ??????=item not gotten yet. So the player can also keep track of what they missed/forgotten. If they keep the items in order of appearance in-game, the player can zoom back to the area the item first appeared to get said item OR they can separate the items in terms of cities/areas that the items appear. The item encyclopedia rules out the need for not feeling satisfied about not completing a mother game 100% as the first 3 mother games had limited storage space to hold anything at all barring important items and needed items for survival.   They can implement this and the battle memory item like in mother 3, with the enemies having back sprites as well."

mother4,2ydqse,darkychao,1 point,Thu Mar 19 11:17:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah. It was taken down because it's ""out of date"". I tried looking for it as well because I wanted to compare the old jingles, but it's no longer on the channel. :/"
mother4,2ydqse,Destro_,3,Sun Mar 8 22:52:32 2015 UTC,I loved the old ones. Especially Leo's sax. It's a dang shame they aren't in the game anymore.

mother4,2ydqse,Destro_,3,Sun Mar 8 23:52:07 2015 UTC,Leo's old sax gave goosebumps...
mother4,2ydqse,nat_noah,1 point,Sun Mar 8 23:56:00 2015 UTC,"I think they changed it because they needed to make it sound good with Leo and Floyd playing at the same time, and without Zack's jingle."

mother4,2ydqse,medn,1 point,Mon Mar 9 04:05:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think anything happened to him. They just probably thought it didn't sound as good with certain people and they probably wanted it to sound good all around. So since Mother 4 isn't going to always have the same party members (like in Mother 3), they just needed to work around that. That's just a guess though."
mother4,2ydqse,Destro_,1 point,Mon Mar 9 06:04:06 2015 UTC,Zack's most likely been downgraded to Flint status: temporarily playable character.

In the current one the instruments almost sound almost like they're tripping over each other rather than harmonizing. When the time comes for the game to be out I'm probably going to find myself trying the mod the old version back in."
mother4,2ydqse,darkychao,1 point,Wed Mar 18 00:49:36 2015 UTC,The bass keeps getting drowned out once the violin and saxophone come in.
mother4,2ydqse,darkychao,1 point,Wed Mar 18 11:10:50 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why they changed Floyd's drum to a bass. The only thing I can think of is that Floyd's rhythm battle instrument is a bass, but judging by the peak of the rhythm battle stuff in the GP trailer the rhythm instruments are desided by the current battle music rather than the character doing the attack. Whatever the reason the level up song now has 2 basslines (Floyd and Meryl) that fight with each other and Meryl's ultimately wins out leaving Floyd's somewhere in the background, getting only a few audable notes in."

mother4,2ybbal,GreatestDaneHD,2,Sun Mar 8 13:52:17 2015 UTC,This is fantastic. I'd love to hear an orchestral remix of Mom and Cooking and Stuff. Hopefully that's something you can put on your list.

mother4,2y8sqj,PSICoffee,8,Sat Mar 7 15:07:30 2015 UTC,Well during the AMA it has been said that the battles has been taped in a debug enviroment so let's not take everything seriously and even the PSI lists are a little off. They might just used some code to make Travis invicible just to film the fight.
mother4,2y8sqj,KiddIsAlive,1 point,Sat Mar 7 15:29:20 2015 UTC,"I guess you have a point. I wonder if the debug room will be accessible somehow, so we can mess around in it like we could in Mother 3."
mother4,2y8sqj,Pretty_Obvious_7,1 point,Sat Mar 7 15:34:58 2015 UTC,"Not to mention over 200,000 experience points... That was definitely a debug environment for the sake of leveling up everyone."
mother4,2y8sqj,dillonEh,1 point,Sat Mar 7 21:58:03 2015 UTC,"Nah, if 200,000 exp is a ridiculous amount for that part of the game then the characters would've leveled up multiple times."
mother4,2y8sqj,Bluestorm83,4,Sat Mar 7 23:25:38 2015 UTC,"It could be that you need exactly 200,000 XP to get from level 60 to 61, so they put in a modern mind that gives 200k XP, set him against a normal party with an invincible Travis and set the whole thing to auto-defend until they got footage of him hitting the comet back for a combo baseball/level jingle footage.  OR they made it so that when a character levels, they stop getting XP at the levelling point, so even from level 1 to 2, if you need 12 XP, but you get a barnillion XPs, you'd stop at 2 and not go straight to level 500."
mother4,2y8sqj,milkmantoast,1 point,Sun Mar 8 15:03:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, probably to just show off the level-up jingles"
mother4,2y8sqj,KayShyGuy,1 point,Sun Mar 8 14:54:05 2015 UTC,"Good thought, but besides it being in ""Debug"" Mode, they are also still balancing the game. Hopefully they make this Modern Mind guy along with others WAY HARDER ;)"
mother4,2y8sqj,luckjes112,1 point,Sat Mar 7 15:34:44 2015 UTC,Or maybe it's like in Mother 3. Commong henchmen who you only fight in one chapter.
mother4,2y8sqj,ArmoredChocobo,1 point,Sat Mar 7 18:43:59 2015 UTC,"I'm banking that since Modern Mind isn't the final boss, he's probably the Natural Killer Cyborg or Porky of Mother 4.  Penultimate Boss."
mother4,2y8sqj,luckjes112,1 point,Sat Mar 7 19:24:44 2015 UTC,Doesn't have to be a final boss. Just an unwinnable boss that is won through cutscene.
mother4,2y8sqj,Dancing_Anatolia,2,Sat Mar 7 20:11:40 2015 UTC,"The ""hit it back"" thing wasn't a cutscene. It's a low percent chance that Travis can hit back projectiles if he's using a bat."
mother4,2y8sqj,luckjes112,1 point,Sat Mar 7 22:47:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah. But I mean an enemy that's unbeatable. The team will fight him for a while, then he'll do a superpowerfull attack and then story happens, like Master Eddy."
mother4,2y8sqj,Dancing_Anatolia,2,Sun Mar 8 07:57:34 2015 UTC,"Oh. Then yeah, that'll probably happen at somepoint, if they think it's a staple. It did happen all three games after all."
mother4,2y8sqj,dillonEh,1 point,Sun Mar 8 19:15:51 2015 UTC,"Harder? We can't entirely discern the difficulty of the battle from that clip, but I'd say that the party would've been screwed if Travis didn't hit that comet back."
mother4,2y8sqj,luckjes112,1 point,Sun Mar 8 22:13:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's one of those event fights, similiar tor the clumsy robot. Maybe only Travis is supposed to live during that part."

Just what exactly would it be?"
mother4,2y6ylu,V0ID115,1 point,Sat Mar 7 04:50:06 2015 UTC,"Well, he is obviously part of the Modern Men, due to common sense. At least I can say that."

No. The only directly returning characters are Mr. Saturn and a handful of enemies.   not sure about the others though

mother4,2y89e4,davidmscott,10,Sat Mar 7 09:58:29 2015 UTC,"Because this has nothing to do with business. This is a tribute, a fan made game. It has nothing to do with money, so it is not a bad business decision."
mother4,2y89e4,MoxZero,4,Sat Mar 7 14:39:07 2015 UTC,"The team said after Mother 4 they'd be parting ways, so no real reason to not call this Mother 4 when they won't be adding onto it."
mother4,2y89e4,bluebreeze52,2,Sat Mar 7 16:26:20 2015 UTC,The game is a huge tribute to Mother in every form so it would be a little dumb to not call it Mother 4. At least that's my opinion.
mother4,2y89e4,KiddIsAlive,2,Sat Mar 7 12:08:57 2015 UTC,"Because it isn't entirely seperate from Mother. We still have Mr. Saturns, the ""key"" enemies (Atomic Power Robot, Mr. Batty, Rambelin' Evil Mushroom, those kinda guys) (Which having them appear makes charging money illegal, for that matter), reused music from past Mother games, (remixed of course, but again, would still make it illegal to charge money) and it is blatantly Mother. Look at the art style and everything. It's blatantly a Mother fangame."
mother4,2y89e4,PSICoffee,2,Sat Mar 7 13:34:11 2015 UTC,"They're not doing it for money. There was no kickstarters, no patreon, nothing. This is 100% a loveletter from the fans and that's awesome. I really respect they're honest dedication to something without any concern for profits."

What would it be like? We have to make that happen."" and 4 plus years later, here we are  Also if they changed it to ""Mothra 4"" or whatever and it was an indie, it might be treated like one, not as special and not as distributed due to marketing and price etc."

mother4,2y1zud,IdrisSamatar,2,Thu Mar 5 20:38:02 2015 UTC,I was worried at first that the game was going to be a 'reference-previous-game-fest'. That there'd be no original features.

mother4,2y1zud,ArmoredChocobo,1 point,Fri Mar 6 03:47:38 2015 UTC,"I think this is from the Andonuts archive but I believe the more towns you save (or clear), the more money you are sent via mail from said towns, the easier it is to buy stronger items for the stronger battles ahead. Someone clarify plz?"

mother4,2y1zud,dillonEh,1 point,Fri Mar 6 05:53:37 2015 UTC,Please god let there be an Andy Warhol reference  also I think it's pretty obvious it's a prequel. I don't think they're gonna pull timeline shenanigans and having it set on the new earth thing post mother 3 is just too obvious
mother4,2y1zud,milkmantoast,1 point,Fri Mar 6 04:07:39 2015 UTC,"A prequel would be feasible. I'm guessing it'd be either about smaller remnants of aliens after Giygas' final strike, or perhaps what led to the world ending that led to the events of M3. EDIT: Oops, forgot: Eerthbound takes place in the 90's..."
mother4,2y34ee,betternotbeclaimed,6,Fri Mar 6 00:51:38 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of the fever thing. It's a maturity thing and it'd make some sense in a real life setting and I think losing run was at least bearable (,but then again 3 PSI USERS!!!)"
mother4,2y34ee,Lucas5655,2,Fri Mar 6 01:55:57 2015 UTC,"I don't want Fevers to come back. They wrecked the pacing of the game, and were REALLY annoying if you wanted to avoid enemies.  As for ""examine"", it's probably one of Floyd's abilities, much like spy and sniff.  But if Mr. Saturns aren't crafting fart boxes in 197X, I'd be disappoint."
mother4,2y34ee,ArmoredChocobo,3,Fri Mar 6 01:40:55 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure in-battle telepathy will be this game's ""examine"" equivalent."
mother4,2y34ee,dillonEh,1 point,Fri Mar 6 06:11:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't like the examin effect but if it was there, it wouldn't bug me. And I actually kinda liked fevers. Maybe the execution was a little off, not being able to run, but if they incorporated it a better way I would love it. I'm honestly not sure why I liked the fevers though, don't ask."
mother4,2y34ee,jonahhl,1 point,Fri Mar 6 01:07:01 2015 UTC,"The fevers annoyed me, in concept and also in practice.  I felt like they were little speed-bumps sprinkled around to slow me down.  Couldn't really continue to progress at my own pace.  So I'd be 100% glad to be rid of those.  By all means, keep ANYTHING funny and light-hearted.  Second thing I didn't dig about Mother 3 was how it was also a LOT more overtly bleak than the other Mother games.  Sure, Earthbound had a lot of that, but there was always a triumph to offset anything like that.  Just saying, don't end the game with a sort of ""Maybe everyone's okay, maybe everyone's dead, maybe the new universe is nothing but a dark black void?""  Mother 3 at many points exhausted me to the point where I was glad when it was over.  Earthbound never did that.  Mother 1 never did that.  Let me have the victory I will no doubt be earning.  Already returning: The perspective is much closer to Earthbound and Mother 1 than Mother 3.  Good.  It's always been a unique look, there was no real reason to scrap it for a more generic perspective in Mother 3.  Wow, I'm REALLY down on Mother 3, aren't I?  Still, I did enjoy the game.  Not a hater, just saying that Itoi's mental state at the time really shone through like a beam of malaise.  If I could, I'd go to the Parallel Universe where he made the game while manically happy and bring that much, much better version here to share with you all.  I'd call it Mother E, because a capital E looks kinda like a backwards 3.  I'd LOVE to keep examining enemies for weaknesses in some form, but I'd also like to be able to examine types of enemies for traits shared by all similar enemies and also to be able to keep examining the same kind of enemy in multiple battles to fill up some sort of enemy notebook with multiple facts about the same guy.  Wall Staples.  I just loved this concept so darn much.  More than anything else in any other game.  I picture someone at some office supply factory one day like, ""I've got it!  You can staple PAPERS together, and that's awesome.  And people draw and write and paint on paper.  But check this out, you can ALSO write and draw and paint on walls!  Wall Staples!  I'll be a millionaire!""  Aaaaand then his genius creation never gets farther than a prototype that is promptly gift wrapped and left with ghosts.  Ghosts are notoriously unreliable in the patenting process.  If there's even a passing reference to Wall Staples in this game, I will be very happy.  There's more, but I've rambled enough here."
mother4,2y0act,Mswordx23,6,Thu Mar 5 09:36:34 2015 UTC,"I'll have to disagree, sorry. The new ones weave together way better than the old ones did. Leo's melody doesn't need to be extravagant. Since Travis's melody is just a simple motif that repeats, Leo's should also be a simple motif that repeats, not a complicated melody like the old one.  I think, objectively, this works better as level-up music. Whether it sounds better is up to opinion, but I like the new ones better. But I don't think it's that important anyway, since they'll level up together only on rare occasions."
mother4,2y0act,DynoMyte08,1 point,Thu Mar 5 12:58:24 2015 UTC,objectively   You're using that word wrong. I don't think the new ones are bad at all but I still think the old ones kicked ass. I liked the insturmentality more than the techno feel the new ones have.
mother4,2y0act,Mswordx23,1 point,Thu Mar 5 21:09:49 2015 UTC,"I liked the instrumentality of the older ones, too."

mother4,2y0act,Dancing_Anatolia,1 point,Fri Mar 6 20:52:29 2015 UTC,"Well by virtue of us having this discussion, obviously it is. Pro-tip: art (and by extension music) is never objective. If you like the new ones better, more power to ya. But don't act like they are immutably better than the old ones."
mother4,2y0act,ArmoredChocobo,2,Fri Mar 6 21:14:43 2015 UTC,I missed Floyd's sweet snare beats but otherwise no.
mother4,2y0act,Dancing_Anatolia,2,Fri Mar 6 00:33:47 2015 UTC,"I dislike Floyd and Leo's new themes, the old ones were more in tune with their characters. The marching rich-boy and the lonely, wizened street rat.  I'm holding onto the hope that they're alternative level up themes, and that the characters have many to choose from, like one time a character levels up, it's ""Type A"" and all other themes that play during that will also be ""Type A"" so they mesh. Next time they level it's ""Type B"", and so on.  If anything else, I'll play Leo and Floyd's old level up themes for my Let's Play at least once to show the comparison."
mother4,2y0act,ArmoredChocobo,1 point,Fri Mar 6 01:32:23 2015 UTC,"Do you have it like, downloaded or something? I know they took the video down on youtube, at least."
mother4,2y0act,KayShyGuy,1 point,Sat Mar 7 06:12:44 2015 UTC,"Luckily, I have them saved for prosperity in an old video of mine. I created this when the country was still called ""Flutune"" and Mother 4's old logo was still a thing, it even has their old blog site and ""motto"" for the game.  That, and they never played Floyd and Leo's themes alongside each other, It was either the other 3 + Leo, or the other 3 + Floyd.   Which probably is why they changed Floyd and Leo's themes because they'll have to mesh together with themselves. I guess they were thinking Zack was gonna be a permanent member back then.  I could EASILY rip the audio from that old video if I needed to use it. I still watch my Earthbound and Mother 3 LPs when I'm bored."

mother4,2xz8jt,TrippEvans,3,Thu Mar 5 22:39:35 2015 UTC,What if they just took your name from your windows profile name and never even asked you to provide it? Thatd be so sneaky
mother4,2xz8jt,KayShyGuy,2,Sun Mar 8 17:37:45 2015 UTC,"I think so, theyve gone out of their way to make sure Mother 4 had everything the others had; a band, a mythical creature, 3 guys and 1 girl, etc and even the ability to rename yur main characters so its lookin like a possibility"
mother4,2xz8jt,Mswordx23,2,Thu Mar 5 05:15:06 2015 UTC,They probably made sure to include any and all elements that were in all three official games.
mother4,2xz8jt,ArmoredChocobo,1 point,Thu Mar 5 12:51:18 2015 UTC,"It'd be a major oversight to have scrolling hp, a band, the 3 guys/1 girl party and character naming but forget to add the ability for the player to add their own names."

The tough guy act is simply that, until someone threatens his friends and gets popped in the jaw by Leo for doing so.  Looks more like he'd become more of a mentor, guardian figure to one of the characters (possibly Travis gets lost in the city Leo lives in)."
mother4,2xzpl5,ArmoredChocobo,1 point,Fri Mar 6 01:48:05 2015 UTC,"Or perhaps some sort of miscommunication happens which pits Travis+Meryl+Floyd against Leo? Just a guess though, I don't actually think that they'll fight. It's been said that the characters are connected in that Meryl had a premonition of them all together, so they would know who Leo is when they see him."
mother4,2xzpl5,captainth,2,Wed Mar 11 03:32:44 2015 UTC,"I figured he'd be more akin to Kumatora where he first joins out of a need for allies against the Modern Men. According to what we know, Leo is one of their main targets, so he may join the kids due to their combat abilities."
mother4,2xzpl5,bluebreeze52,3,Thu Mar 5 05:22:58 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, what if the Modern Men are trying to specifically target people for their PSI abilities ?"
mother4,2xzpl5,bluebreeze52,5,Thu Mar 5 20:31:36 2015 UTC,This goes into a theory I posted here on the forums behind the Modern Men. They definitely might see PSI users as a threat to them and want them eliminated.
mother4,2xzpl5,bluebreeze52,3,Thu Mar 5 20:34:25 2015 UTC,"It could even be that they want these abilities for themselves, so they may be trying to find a way to extract them!"
mother4,2xzpl5,bluebreeze52,3,Thu Mar 5 21:02:34 2015 UTC,"Try looking for ""My Theory on the Modern Men"" thread. I had a pretty interesting discussion there on their possible goals. Maybe restraining society, maybe they're abstract artists trying to reinvent the world. Maybe a bit of both."

That being said, the Town Life feature was more of a description of common game aspects that would be generally expanded upon. Yes, there are sometimes multiple businesses from which to purchase items and equipment from, but there isn't really anything like ""living"" in a town.   Travis lives in Belring; he explores the countryside of Pleiades to save his home and loved ones. He's not looking to move out."

Will this be a feature in Mother 4? Thank you"
mother4,2xskl4,the-dave,29,Tue Mar 3 18:52:16 2015 UTC,"How does the ""hit it back"" mechanic work?   Is this a scripted event exclusive to the Modern Mind, or is Travis able to hit back projectiles from other enemies? Do you have to press a button at just the right time to trigger it? Do you have to have a certain weapon equipped, like a baseball bat? Is Travis the only one able to ""play ball""?"
mother4,2xskl4,luckjes112,15,Tue Mar 3 16:45:07 2015 UTC,"As long as Travis has a bat, he has a chance to hit back a projectile launched at him. Things like lasers, rocks, comets, rockets, and so on. It's an unscripted event that occurs with low probability."
mother4,2xskl4,siothio,2,Wed Mar 4 01:41:52 2015 UTC,...I wish I could deflect lasers with a baseball bat. And comets? I just had the most awesome picture in my head of Travis hitting back an earth shattering meteor.
mother4,2xskl4,pik-mother4,11,Sun Mar 8 08:00:04 2015 UTC,How will the day and night cycle work? Is it just a choice you can make or will it effect the gameplay?
mother4,2xskl4,MrMcKonz,8,Tue Mar 3 21:35:14 2015 UTC,"As seen in the gameplay trailer, staying at a hotel gives the player the choice to go out at day or night. Time changes can also happen as a result of certain events."
mother4,2xskl4,cirkiller,5,Wed Mar 4 03:08:42 2015 UTC,That'd be cool if we got a tally of how many days have passed at the end of the game.
mother4,2xskl4,betternotbeclaimed,7,Wed Mar 4 04:52:29 2015 UTC,will the game feature songs that are inspired by classics like in other mother games?  will there be more exclusive PSI to each character?  will weapons have more unique properties or will it just be accuracy and power like in other mother games?  will there be any realtime events like the phone call in earthbound?
mother4,2xskl4,TastySnax,1 point,Tue Mar 3 17:48:47 2015 UTC,"Not a creator of Mother 4, but the first is a ""yes"". I know this because the trailer had a song that I recognized from my childhood."
mother4,2xskl4,luckjes112,6,Thu Mar 5 23:17:27 2015 UTC,"How many towns/main locations will be included in Mother 4? Terms like ""a lot"" or ""a few"" are acceptable. And what music will be returning/remixed?"
mother4,2xskl4,XeniKobalt,1 point,Tue Mar 3 18:44:45 2015 UTC,"Good question, Mother 3 only had 3 towns and a few (un)civilized locations."
mother4,2xskl4,pik-mother4,19,Sun Mar 8 08:01:51 2015 UTC,"It's very considerate of you to appease us rabid fans with an AMA! I have less of a question and more of a concern, and I hope this doesn't come across negatively, because I can't express how hype I am for this game. So please, don't let this come across as ""sour"".  What I was wondering is, are there any plans or intentions to re-do the hotel's isometric flooring, since it doesn't match the rest of the room's perspective? If not, that's a petty issue that shouldn't cause anyone grief, though it's the only actual flaw in the trailer that I've seen anybody here point out."
mother4,2xskl4,XeniKobalt,18,Tue Mar 3 17:29:18 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks! Most of the art guys (and others) noticed and contested the isometric flooring, but due to filming time constraints we decided to just run with it for the moment being. We're definitely fixing it."
mother4,2xskl4,Seaofechoes,3,Wed Mar 4 02:24:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for answering my question! Also, I had no idea you helped with Project M. That's double awesome!"
mother4,2xskl4,pik-mother4,2,Wed Mar 4 02:52:44 2015 UTC,Are you actually pik? /u/Pik-projectm is Pik's Reddit account.
mother4,2xskl4,the-dave,7,Wed Mar 4 02:28:08 2015 UTC,"I figured I'd have one specifically for MOTHER 4 related questions. Since the last AMA was more impromptu, I used the account I already had."
mother4,2xskl4,Seaofechoes,8,Wed Mar 4 02:36:55 2015 UTC,I can vouch for Pik.
mother4,2xskl4,Seaofechoes,1 point,Wed Mar 4 02:39:47 2015 UTC,"Ah alright, thanks for the clarification : )"
mother4,2xskl4,Pastellian,18,Wed Mar 4 02:39:36 2015 UTC,"Hello! I have one question and a small inquiry.  How does Floyd's ""chatting up"" the enemy technique work? Does each enemy give unique responses?  As for my inquiry, is Rogg still an enemy ; )?"
mother4,2xskl4,Seaofechoes,21,Tue Mar 3 16:50:39 2015 UTC,"Floyd's ability is to ""Talk"" to enemies. Rather than a PSI button, there is a ""Talk"" button. Being that Floyd has something of a stubborn streak, he'll just say whatever he feels like. Sometimes he'll chat up an enemy and waste his turn and the enemy's turn, serving as a valuable distraction.   Sometimes he will try to bribe the enemy with the party's hard earned money, making the enemy leave the battle and look the other way.  Others he'll say something to perk up a party member.   It's really a mixed bag with him. Rogg is being redrawn, but yes."
mother4,2xskl4,captainth,3,Wed Mar 4 02:12:58 2015 UTC,That's really neat!  It's amazing to see how far you guys have come in the last 5 years.
mother4,2xskl4,MrMcKonz,1 point,Wed Mar 4 02:51:56 2015 UTC,"(A little lat here, sorry!) This sounds really cool! So far, Floyd is shaping up to be my favorite of the protagonists.  I personally think it would be better if it weren't random though. Like if you could choose ""Chat"", ""Bribe"", or ""Perk"" similarly to how you choose a PSI move or one of Duster's thief tools. It would allow for a bit more strategy in regular battle. I can see now with the current system players wanting Floyd to do a specific one of his talents, say, chatting up a specific enemy, but he keeps on randomly deciding to perk up party members or something. It takes away from strategy and adds to frustration."
mother4,2xskl4,Pastellian,14,Tue Mar 10 14:25:30 2015 UTC,"From the trailer, is this girl on the street corner inspired by Meryls old design?"
mother4,2xskl4,Guiltteaman,9,Tue Mar 3 20:43:24 2015 UTC,Definitely.
mother4,2xskl4,Arachnibot,8,Wed Mar 4 01:53:50 2015 UTC,"Is the Franklin Badge returning? Also, why did you remove the old level-up jingles and the the 3 Mother 4 soundtrack videos on your Youtube channel?"
mother4,2xskl4,Pastellian,7,Tue Mar 3 21:52:53 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, since Pastel said that the town life system has been downplayed, what elements of it are still there? (I personally loved the concept, but if it had to go, so be it.)"
mother4,2xskl4,KayShyGuy,14,Wed Mar 4 00:26:56 2015 UTC,"In general, while some things might return it's best to treat the old blog as talking about a different game. For example, there are multiple places to buy food and equipment in town, and staying in a bad hotel room might result in you getting bit by a mosquito and waking up without full HP. That said, there isn't anything interface related or particular that make these things part of a system."
mother4,2xskl4,pik-mother4,6,Wed Mar 4 02:56:31 2015 UTC,"Question regarding the ""Dash"" system:  I was wondering if you can dash around if someone has fainted on your team. I mean, sure it would be funny to drag them around lol but what if you're in a tough area and are about to lose? You want to run away from the enemies and stay safe right? But if you can't run then it will be more difficult to escape the area. Sorry im not 100% sure but im pretty sure you can dash with fainted teammates in Mother 3 (and EB = No dashing) so yea thx again M4team the trailer is wonderful!"
mother4,2xskl4,GravityUnown2,9,Tue Mar 3 18:40:16 2015 UTC,"Small correction! In MOTHER 3, dashing is disabled when party members are unconscious. In MOTHER 4, this hasn't changed. So you'll have to find other ways to escape trouble when you're in a pinch."
mother4,2xskl4,DetectivePento,6,Wed Mar 4 02:43:58 2015 UTC,"So we've seen some very solid footage of rhythm battles. Are there going to be trickier songs to nail like Serious, Strong One, and Even Drier Guys from Mother 3?"
mother4,2xskl4,zedwithoutperil,6,Tue Mar 3 22:23:51 2015 UTC,"Love how much dialog you guys create, it's really cool to see! No question this time, just wanted to share a little fan art! Thanks and keep up the good work! Really excited!  http://i.imgur.com/aSIh3G8.png"
mother4,2xskl4,Pastellian,17,Wed Mar 4 03:18:02 2015 UTC,Is Leo's favorite thing REALLY dishwashers?
mother4,2xskl4,Destro_,21,Tue Mar 3 15:55:28 2015 UTC,Absolutely. A gang has to have plates to eat on.
mother4,2xskl4,IdrisSamatar,4,Wed Mar 4 03:05:43 2015 UTC,"If it is, I would love to know a reason why (unless that spoils part of the story)."
mother4,2xskl4,Pastellian,12,Tue Mar 3 16:20:04 2015 UTC,Will there be any sort of interactions between the party members? Will we see them sort of bounce off of each other with certain party members liking/disliking the other to a certain extent?
mother4,2xskl4,Crystalwarrior,7,Tue Mar 3 16:19:48 2015 UTC,"Of course. You don't go on a journey with people and not talk to them. During various events, every party member will have their own lines as you might expect. Well, naturally they might do things that surprise you, too."
mother4,2xskl4,skinny_foetus_boy,2,Wed Mar 4 02:06:12 2015 UTC,"So, basically, Chrono Trigger-style character interactions? That's one thing I loved about that game that I wish Earthbound had as well, hah. How are you going to handle the fainted characters or different leading party members, though? Are you going to revive them and give them 1 HP for the cutscene like Mother 3, or are you going to write unique dialogue based on lead characters/fainted ones? Or maybe a bit of both?"
mother4,2xskl4,the-dave,16,Thu Mar 5 13:21:58 2015 UTC,"Will any of the game's assets (engine, tools or whatnot) be open-sourced to the community? Also, will we have to wait until the release of the game to start translating it or will there be any way to work on it prior to the release? Thank you, and please keep up the good work!"
mother4,2xskl4,the-dave,5,Tue Mar 3 15:53:06 2015 UTC,"Right now, we don't have any announcements to make about open sourcing the game. The translation tools will be available after the game launches. That should give potential translators time to become acquainted with the game, as we don't want to release any versions of the game prior to the public release."
mother4,2xskl4,Destro_,3,Wed Mar 4 02:29:04 2015 UTC,"It's something we've considered, but if any of us continue to make games, we'd likely move to another engine, maybe something like Unity. Though some parts of the current engine would come along for the ride."
mother4,2xskl4,Pastellian,14,Tue Mar 3 23:08:11 2015 UTC,How exactly does GROOVY work? Does it build up from damage done or does it go up by a certain amount for each character?
mother4,2xskl4,Destro_,15,Wed Mar 4 02:29:26 2015 UTC,Hey! Great question. It builds up when a player deals damage - no matter how much damage you deal - or eats food. It reduces when the player takes damage or suffers a status effect. SMAAASH!! attacks make the meter increase and decrease more.   It also decreases if you eat nasty food.
mother4,2xskl4,Pastellian,2,Tue Mar 3 16:18:42 2015 UTC,Thanks! Does it also build up when you do more than one hit in a turn like on a music combo? Or if your attack attacks multiple enemies? Or does it go up by a set amount?
mother4,2xskl4,thomar,3,Wed Mar 4 02:18:15 2015 UTC,It goes up by a set amount for all of those situations.
mother4,2xskl4,Pretty_Obvious_7,3,Wed Mar 4 02:44:29 2015 UTC,Or does it build up with good rhythm hits?
mother4,2xskl4,KayShyGuy,2,Wed Mar 4 02:46:51 2015 UTC,"Just an inference but based on the trailer it appeared that a single hit would raise the meter, and consecutive rhythm hits would count. Idk if amount of damage is a factor."
mother4,2xskl4,KayShyGuy,3,Tue Mar 3 18:00:06 2015 UTC,"Also watch the modern mind fight, when travis hits the comet back he gets alot in his GROOVY meter, something good to note :)"
mother4,2xskl4,Maleficus187,1 point,Tue Mar 3 18:42:03 2015 UTC,I believe zane confirmed itll be from just any type of attack but hopefully we get a specific answer
mother4,2xskl4,nat_noah,5,Tue Mar 3 19:23:08 2015 UTC,"I assume that Mr. saturn will have a typical peculiar font for their speaking text. As far as the translation tool goes, will it be able to use different fonts, such as the Mr. Saturn font, throughout the game?"
mother4,2xskl4,nat_noah,5,Tue Mar 3 18:44:09 2015 UTC,Will there be 1/128 items? Thanks for another great AMA! :)
mother4,2xskl4,thewaffles,5,Tue Mar 3 17:17:59 2015 UTC,"There will be rare items and events in the game, but I can't say what the probability is nor what they are."
mother4,2xskl4,Hellshrekers,1 point,Wed Mar 4 00:00:18 2015 UTC,Cool! And thanks! :)
mother4,2xskl4,Vappyvap,4,Wed Mar 4 01:44:27 2015 UTC,"From the trailers we've seen so far, the tone of the game seems to be a mix of all three existing Mother games. Will this one have serious moments like Mother 3? Thank you for the AMA and all that you've done, I'm so excited to see the game in full!"
mother4,2xskl4,XeniKobalt,5,Thu Mar 5 04:14:15 2015 UTC,"When the game comes out, will you guys be making a torrent download?"
mother4,2xskl4,Hellshrekers,8,Wed Mar 4 00:23:03 2015 UTC,We'll actually have a lengthy blog post up about how we plan to release. Torrent is one consideration.
mother4,2xskl4,XeniKobalt,6,Wed Mar 4 01:20:27 2015 UTC,I would also try out MEGA.
mother4,2xskl4,SageWaterDragon,2,Wed Mar 4 01:32:44 2015 UTC,"Vappy from Vinesauce? Small world, isn't it! Also yes, MEGA ftw."

mother4,2xskl4,CzarSquid,13,Thu Mar 26 03:53:46 2015 UTC,When did you start working on Mother 4? What was some of the challenges in making a new Mother game? Would you like to make another Mother game or some other game project in the future? What is your favorite feature that was added to the game? What is something you wish to added to the game but was cut out? What would the game be called if Nintendo did do a C&D? What is your favorite Mother game? What is your favorite non-mother game?   I'm super excited for this game and can't wait to see it finished!
mother4,2xskl4,CzarSquid,9,Thu Mar 5 01:34:23 2015 UTC,"When did you start working on Mother 4?   Some of us started 5 years ago! But serious development began only 2 years ago.   What was some of the challenges in making a new Mother game?   Creating your own engine. Working remotely with people you've never met. Attempting to appease a global community of fans. Keeping the writing consistent. You name it.   Would you like to make another Mother game or some other game project in the future?   The future is a complete unknown. We truly have no idea what will happen after release.   What is your favorite feature that was added to the game?   Feature? Hitting back projectiles, but there are some tiny gems in the game I can't talk about that really make me smile.   What is something you wish to added to the game but was cut out?   I think we have the flexibility to edit and re-edit as we see fit. There are a lot of easter eggs we want to put in game that I'm not sure we'll get to, though.   What would the game be called if Nintendo did do a C&D?   Mothra 4.    What is your favorite Mother game?   I can only answer for myself, but Earthbound.    What is your favorite non-mother game?   I am particularly fond of Kentucky Route Zero.   I'm super excited for this game and can't wait to see it finished!   Us, too! Thanks!"
mother4,2xskl4,Sexylisk,23,Tue Mar 3 18:27:06 2015 UTC,Mothra 4   Perfect.
mother4,2xskl4,Pretty_Obvious_7,7,Wed Mar 4 02:06:40 2015 UTC,But what will happen when Toho files a C&D?
mother4,2xskl4,TotallyNotRainbowDas,3,Wed Mar 4 02:16:08 2015 UTC,Best answer for an alternate title.
mother4,2xskl4,-Pollyanna,2,Wed Mar 4 19:47:24 2015 UTC,Thank you for the reply! It's nice to be actually able to talk to the devs on the game and get a response. I've had high hopes for you all when I first saw the announcement for the game around 2-3 years ago. I'm glad to see you haven't given up!
mother4,2xskl4,KayShyGuy,7,Wed Mar 4 02:45:36 2015 UTC,"Can you release the music from the trailer where you are fighting the catstick things?  Also how long do you think it would take to beat the game?  How many ""main areas"" are there?"
mother4,2xskl4,-Pollyanna,3,Wed Mar 4 02:53:25 2015 UTC,They've stated often that the game length will be closest too earthbound length so about 20-25 hours. The # of areas they'll have to answer themselves.
mother4,2xskl4,packagegrope,3,Tue Mar 3 15:59:20 2015 UTC,The Catstick music.  I need it sooo badly.
mother4,2xskl4,siothio,3,Tue Mar 3 18:37:37 2015 UTC,"Does Zack have any kind of special move instead of PSI similar to how Flint had Brute Force? And (hopefully this isn't a huge spoiler or something) will he be appearing a lot throughout the game?  Also, will the new music heard in the trailer be released on Soundcloud anytime soon ?! It's fantastic!!  Thanks to all of the Mother 4 Team for all the work you've put into this! Eagerly awaiting my chance to play this in June!!"
mother4,2xskl4,spritefuser,1 point,Tue Mar 10 10:57:09 2015 UTC,"According to the M4Andonuts archive, Zack and Floyd have no PSI capabilities but hey maybe that could change midgame, who knows"

mother4,2xskl4,Pastellian,2,Wed Mar 4 04:42:53 2015 UTC,What's Floyd's special ability. He's not a PSI user and on the trailer he chatted with the enemy. So how does it work?
mother4,2xskl4,DaneeBound,7,Wed Mar 4 17:32:29 2015 UTC,"What exactly are the Modern Men? Are they human, or alien? Not gonna ask for spoilers as to what their goal is and such, but knowing what they are exactly can give me a bit more ground in speculation."
mother4,2xskl4,the-dave,9,Tue Mar 3 21:09:16 2015 UTC,That is an enduring question throughout the game.
mother4,2xskl4,DogTheGayFish,8,Tue Mar 3 20:50:49 2015 UTC,"I noticed that Boom Town Lounge was playing a lot in the overworld. Is it going to be playing in most areas/towns, or was it just placeholder?"
mother4,2xskl4,TokoWH,12,Wed Mar 4 01:58:55 2015 UTC,"The song you're hearing is actually ""Boom Town Special,"" the daytime version of that song. Every city has a daytime and a nighttime song. You heard it a lot because the city in question happens to have a variety of places to show off."

mother4,2xskl4,metalknuckles,6,Tue Mar 3 15:49:10 2015 UTC,"I will preface this by saying I have a lot of faith and I'm very excited for this game. In your point of view are you confident in the writing of the game, as one of the things that made the series so great was its funny, charming writing. Was recreating or trying to match this a difficult challenge for you guys?"
mother4,2xskl4,KayShyGuy,7,Wed Mar 4 02:16:34 2015 UTC,"About Floyd being able to 'hit it off' with the enemies, exactly what does it do? Does it cause the enemy to skip their turn, or does it power Floyd up somehow? Does the monster join in on the battle against the other enemies?  Also, I'm sticking to my theory that at some point part of the current world in the game is going to break off into it's own world, as going off the main title image of the game. I know you won't say anything solid because spoilers, but can you at least hint if I'm on the right track or not with that?"
mother4,2xskl4,KayShyGuy,3,Tue Mar 3 15:46:41 2015 UTC,What PSI skills are and aren't returning?

I'm a HUGE fan of everything you guys have done, and just first wanted to thank you for all your guys' hard work and dedication.  Anyway the questions:   Any changes regarding core gameplay (ex. running in Mother3) being added here you haven't discussed? How are these protagonists linked? Telepathy like Earthbound? Coincidence/Fate like Mother3? How's the save system? I heard before on some archived site er whatever it's sending mail or of the sorts. Can you elaborate please? Cash system? ATMs? and lastly... Is Leo too bada$$ for me to handle?   Thank you for taking the time to reply to this if you can."
mother4,2xskl4,KayShyGuy,7,Tue Mar 3 19:18:33 2015 UTC,"That means so much! Thank you, the team is really touched to hear from people who have been sticking with us for so long.   As far as overworld changes are concerned, the use of 4th D Slip to enter areas that otherwise can't be entered or visit dungeons that have been deactivated is probably the largest change. Meryl saw a future event in which they were all involved. You mail postcards! Find a mailbox, mail a postcard. Sometimes things come in the mail.  Money comes in the mail.  Leo is bad to the bone.   Thank you for your question!"

Does each character only have 3 PSI abilities per page? And do both Meryl and Leo lack recovery moves? Is Floyd paralyzed or KO or what? XD Why does Boom Town Lounge play so often? Is it the default ""town"" song? How does Travis hit it back? Is it like a timed hit defense from Mario RPG?  What's the green thing flying by Travis at night? Why does PK Beam seem so... Bad? It barely does any damage and the new effect is boring (especially the start where the screen is yellow).   and now the big one...   When does this game take place?! I've seen people say the seventies, I've seen prequel, I've seen after the dragon reset the world, I've seen so many things O_O! But which one is right?    Thank you xD"
mother4,2xskl4,milkmantoast,7,Wed Mar 4 02:45:15 2015 UTC,"The Modern Mind is not the final boss.  The battle scenes were taken in a debug environment, so the PSI lists might be a little funny. Good noticing though, we missed that. Floyd is out of HP, yes. Party members are dragged on the floor when KO'd. There is no ""default"" town song - all the scenes with Boom Town playing are from one city. Our towns have unique main themes, each with daytime and nighttime variants.  To quote Dave elsewhere in this AMA: ""As long as Travis has a bat, he has a chance to hit back a projectile launched at him. Things like lasers, rocks, comets, rockets, and so on. It's an unscripted event that occurs with low probability."" I don't know! PK Beam is just tricky to answer. The animation timings are a bit off from their protyped, more impressive forms, so Pastel is gonna wind up revising it. As far as damage is concerned, balance is a constant thing. The intent is more powerful but less reliable than PK Freeze."
mother4,2xskl4,EveMK89,2,Tue Mar 3 18:50:19 2015 UTC,"Unlikely. Why would they show the last boss in the trailer? He's obviously a step above the Modern Men, so very likely a boss.  Early stage of the game, haven't yet unlocked other PSI abilities.  The green stuff is likely the same goo as seen in the last teaser, and featured in the logo."
mother4,2xskl4,EveMK89,4,Wed Mar 4 03:02:41 2015 UTC,"Real quick, theyre only using PK beam alpha, even in EB/M3 the alpha was moderately weak, and it probably seems boring cuz we've all watched the trailer a bunch of times lol same here but itll be worth it to finally see PK BEAM OMEGA, and use it on that darned Modern Mind :)"
mother4,2xskl4,Pastellian,1 point,Wed Mar 4 01:05:20 2015 UTC,PK Beam was not in Earthbound or Mother 3.
mother4,2xskl4,EveMK89,2,Tue Mar 3 19:21:13 2015 UTC,I think /u/KayShyGuy meant PK Flash. It pretty much replaced PK Beam.

mother4,2xskl4,Hekset,2,Tue Mar 3 20:43:41 2015 UTC,"How big a role does this reoccurring goo-stuff play in the plot? Will Shane be uploading the ""Stickat"" Battle Theme yet? What about the Modern Mind Battle Theme? Will he be uploading anything from Mother 4 in the near future?"
mother4,2xskl4,Vappyvap,2,Wed Mar 4 04:32:07 2015 UTC,"We haven't seen any references to previous entries just yet, and the returning enemies are redesigned. Is there a particular reason for this, from a legal standpoint? Or did you just want to better distinguish this from it's predecessors?"
mother4,2xskl4,Vappyvap,9,Wed Mar 4 01:02:19 2015 UTC,"The redesigned enemies tend to have precedent - for instance, the Atomic Power Robot went from a little walking gas can fella to a tripod with tentacles to a wheel-y robot with only one tentacle. Enemies like Mr. Batty, the inevitable snakes, etc have been redesigned, where enemies we bring back whose designs haven't changed (such as the Ramblin' Evil Mushroom) won't change either."
mother4,2xskl4,bakem0n0,1 point,Wed Mar 4 01:07:49 2015 UTC,I read that one enemy in particular has plot-relevence. Would that happen to be the Atomic Power Robot? Is Pleiades run on atomic power? O:

mother4,2xskl4,TheFireBurning,2,Wed Mar 4 02:43:33 2015 UTC,"With the ""Play Ball"" scene, is it right to assume Travis uses Bats? Who's your favorite character, from the people we know so far? Is there a limit to your inventory space? (Collectors Unite!) Does Leo's motorcycle have a name?"
mother4,2xskl4,Mswordx23,2,Wed Mar 4 02:46:51 2015 UTC,Will the instant-win mechanic from Earthbound make a return? Like if your characters are just a way higher level than the enemies you can skip the battle and automatically receive the EXP? Or will the run and ramming through enemies mechanic return from Mother 3?  Will PK Starstorm also return and will we see some other interesting  and unique PSI abilities like PK Ground?
mother4,2xskl4,KayShyGuy,2,Tue Mar 3 23:13:50 2015 UTC,"Also, just letting you know the hit sounds (claps) are really weak sounding so I hope those are just placeholders."
mother4,2xskl4,Brandon0612,2,Wed Mar 4 02:04:10 2015 UTC,Any plans on a Japanese translation? It would only be fair.
mother4,2xskl4,Pastellian,1 point,Wed Mar 4 04:08:15 2015 UTC,"I think that's not up to the team! If japanese Mother fans really get interested on the game (I think they already are for what I've read somewhere?) they'll make their translation. A lot of people from different countries already want to start working on a translation to their own languages and the team will provide tools for that as already mention :) (Sorry if you wanted someone from the team to answer but I just wanted to share what I knew + my opinion, hope it's ok!)"
mother4,2xskl4,brighteyedsmile,2,Wed Mar 4 02:37:02 2015 UTC,"When making towns and such for my own games, I tend to inspire them based off of my own childhood memories of my old hometown and cities I would go to. Has that sort of influence rubbed off on MOTHER 4 in any way? And also, when Chaisu left, was there some major changes to what you guys had originally planned like the story for instance? (Yeah... I'm kinda late... sorry D:)"
mother4,2xskl4,thomar,5,Wed Mar 4 19:08:46 2015 UTC,Will the format follow the Mother 1 and 2 style of going town to town or will there be chapters?

mother4,2xskl4,Starmen_91,5,Tue Mar 3 16:04:24 2015 UTC,"Questions regarding the ""Enemy Advantage/Disadvantage"" system:  Im pretty sure you can but will you be able to sneak up on enemies, or touch their backs and get an extra turn? If so then vice versa will be the case. Also if you're way leveled up and you dash into an enemy, will you just clear through them like Mother 3? Will you get 0 experience? Or 1 exp like EB? I guess that question doesnt matter much lol but thanks Zane anyway!"
mother4,2xskl4,the-dave,2,Tue Mar 3 16:09:31 2015 UTC,Can i press F to pay to pay respects?  But seriously will there be modern pop culture references and Easter eggs? And are there optional side 'quests' and activities  Sorry if these questions have been asked already. I am really looking forward to the release of this awesome game. thank you!
mother4,2xskl4,Starmen_91,10,Tue Mar 3 19:01:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the kind words! We're looking forward to everybody being able to play.  There are definitely NPCs waiting for you to run errands, and there are certainly secret things to see.   And yes you're naturally going to see some pop culture references but they will tend to show more through the world than the actual writing. The general decades to look for will be the 60s and 70s, we're not going to be talking about recent singers or things from the internet or popular cartoons. No memes. Nothing about dresses."
mother4,2xskl4,joeker9787,8,Tue Mar 3 22:29:13 2015 UTC,"No memes, I approve :D"
mother4,2xskl4,KayShyGuy,1 point,Wed Mar 4 02:23:28 2015 UTC,Very good question. Could the devs nail down a range of years for the pop culture references?
mother4,2xskl4,Antidote_Orange,1 point,Wed Mar 4 02:53:25 2015 UTC,"Oh, I noticed you took down the old screenshots... How come? This is kind of a two part question because I noticed the purple mushroom enemy's background looks identical to a sanctuary boss fight background - Was that on purpose? Is he a boss?"
mother4,2xskl4,EveMK89,6,Wed Mar 4 00:43:49 2015 UTC,"We removed the old content because it so far off from the current version of the game. We receive a lot of questions asking if years-old content is still in the game and it gets difficult to sort through it all.   That's an interesting theory, but I can neither confirm nor deny it. :)"
mother4,2xskl4,sgeb91,3,Tue Mar 3 23:06:03 2015 UTC,"How will we be able to translate the game? I mean, there are translation tools, but how and to what extent will we be able to change the language (if there are puns/alliterations/words with hidden meanings we should translate)?"
mother4,2xskl4,Pastellian,5,Wed Mar 4 01:40:26 2015 UTC,"Translators will be able to change any of the game's text data, and graphics if need be. If there's wordplay that needs to be changed to make sense in another language, or other localizing that needs to be done, translators will be able to make those changes with the translation tools."

mother4,2xskl4,tragicmanner,4,Wed Mar 4 02:03:10 2015 UTC,"Will there be any additional difficulties, or some kind of hard mode like in mother 3? (That may have just been in the fan translation, not sure). I would love to challenge myself in additional play throughs."
mother4,2xskl4,KayShyGuy,1 point,Wed Mar 4 06:14:42 2015 UTC,"They hav confirmed lot of extra content, we just arent sure what that content will show itself as so maybe zane will give hints. Maybe a hard mode, an extra ""FourSide-esque"" world where everything is challenging, an Arena Mode, Boss Rush mode, hopefully we get them ALL!"
mother4,2xskl4,go_bwaaah,2,Tue Mar 3 16:34:33 2015 UTC,Do you have a rough estimate of just how many songs are in the game?  The Mother series is very well known for its soundtrack and Shane does an excellent job!
mother4,2xskl4,Darkzzii,4,Tue Mar 3 20:48:57 2015 UTC,"There's a countless amount of music and effects we're consistently adding, removing and editing. That's an answer we'll have close to launch.   Thanks for the kind words. I let Shane know!"
mother4,2xskl4,DynoMyte08,1 point,Tue Mar 3 20:20:48 2015 UTC,"This might not be the time or place, but it'd be great if Shane could talk a little about how he goes about making those effects."

mother4,2xskl4,Rockto_AP,2,Tue Mar 3 22:02:03 2015 UTC,"Question regarding Floyd's abilities:  So far we've seen ""Bribe"" and ""Chat"". What does Bribe do? Does it make enemies flee? Or attack other enemies for you? Does it only work on humans? And what does Chat do? Does it only distract Floyd and the chatting enemy? That doesnt seem very useful unless a VERY STRONG enemy needs a friend to talk to :) Lastly will Floyd have multiple abilities to make up for his lack of PSI abilities? Thanks Zane and M4 Team"
mother4,2xskl4,MotherFan101,2,Wed Mar 4 01:37:39 2015 UTC,"As far as references to previous Mother games, is it just vague stuff related to the overall story, or are specific characters mentioned?"

mother4,2xskl4,Pastellian,1 point,Wed Mar 4 05:15:53 2015 UTC,"Quick question,  In all the Mother games there seemed to be a collection of things that needed to be visited or collected for the story to progress. In Mother 1 it was the songs, often but not always guarded by a boss, in EB it was the Sanctuary locations/bosses, and in Mother 3 it was the Needles/bosses. Is there something similar in M4 and would that be the giant metal spires with the goo on them?"

mother4,2xskl4,KayShyGuy,7,Mon May 18 08:43:32 2015 UTC,"That is the flag of the country of Pleiades. It's meant to look like the American flag as the country is meant to look American.   There is certainly a history behind it, but the number of stars (arranged in the shape of the Pleiades star cluster seen from Earth) probably has something to do with it.  Pleiades, incidentally, is pronounced ""PLAY-uh-deez."""

mother4,2xskl4,DetectivePento,1 point,Tue Mar 3 17:33:16 2015 UTC,"Hypothetical question here... Now, I know this is a naive prospect. But if, say, Nintendo did go about acknowledging MOTHER 4 at some capacity (via Twitter, or something) would there be any legal complications in doing so? I read that Shigesato Itoi has already given his blessings for future fan-developed entries, and it is a non-profit game. Again, just to clarify - I'm not asking if Nintendo would do it. I'm asking if there'd be any legal ramifications if they happened to be that awesome."

Does it last a whole battle or is it a 1-time use? I assume its a 1-time because a boss battle would be made considerably easier with 2 or more Ultimate Vitamins. Lastly are they purchasable or hard to find like Rare Candys? Plz be the latter lol and THANK U M4 TEAM!"
mother4,2xskl4,Goodbye18000,0,Tue Mar 3 20:47:15 2015 UTC,I'd imagine it works about the same way as a Sudden Guts pill in Earthbound.

mother4,2xskl4,Goodbye18000,3,Tue Mar 3 22:29:39 2015 UTC,Only Travis can use Telepathy. The way you spend your turns in battle is pretty important.
mother4,2xskl4,KayShyGuy,1 point,Tue Mar 3 19:07:21 2015 UTC,How can you say about the translation tools? I'm interested to translate the game to Spanish
mother4,2xskl4,KayShyGuy,1 point,Wed Mar 4 03:09:38 2015 UTC,"Something that always concerned me with these kinds of projects is the aesthetic feel.  Naturally a PC made game usually just feels different than something on a older console or handheld, loading times, the way in which menus open and close, battles initiate. I'm just curious if these are concerns your team has and are you trying to make sure this feels less fan game and more genuine?"
mother4,2xskl4,CzarSquid,5,Tue Mar 3 22:24:45 2015 UTC,"Staying true to the genuine feel is something we're always conscious of. You won't be running into load screens or choppy menu entering/exiting like in some games. The idea is to present the smoothest, quickest transitions we can between any mode of interaction with the game. Even if it's not exclusively a retro console thing, it's definitely something that has been present in every Mother title that we're trying to reproduce. However, we won't be implementing any superficial ""features"" to make the game seem retro."

mother4,2xqjd0,Bluestorm83,1 point,Tue Mar 3 03:31:39 2015 UTC,I think its a gimmicky fight like the first starman fight in earthbound. I think that since the comet did so much damage and their health is so low that its the only realistic way to win the fight. Maybe Travis just got the bat and they're using it like a plot item just like the franklin badge in mother 3.
mother4,2xqjd0,DynoMyte08,1 point,Tue Mar 3 21:49:11 2015 UTC,"Their health is low there due to the fight; if you see, after the Modern Mind dies, they level up to level 61.  It's apparently rather far along in the game that the particular fight occurred.  Or at least they whipped up a party of high level guys to wait for that to happen, so they could capture it for the video."
mother4,2xqjd0,ArmoredChocobo,3,Wed Mar 4 22:56:52 2015 UTC,"It was explained in the AMA.   To quote Dave elsewhere in this AMA: ""As long as Travis has a bat, he has a chance to hit back a projectile launched at him. Things like lasers, rocks, comets, rockets, and so on. It's an unscripted event that occurs with low probability."""

mother4,2xisxd,monkeynator,10,Sun Mar 1 02:16:28 2015 UTC,"As a game developer myself (not for Mother 4, obviously), I think a big concern is that people could potentially steal the engine and claim it as their own, or hackers really messing with the game. So really, making it open source is making sure there is a bond or trust between the devs and the audience to ensure that they won't mess around with something they've been making for several years now. But yeah, I agree, if it were open source I think a lot of new doors could open up for rom hackers who want to make the game more portable."
mother4,2xisxd,CaptainCrisby,7,Sun Mar 1 03:15:37 2015 UTC,"One protection for that is to wait a while to release it, usually after it has lost relavence."
mother4,2xisxd,thomar,3,Sun Mar 1 04:03:27 2015 UTC,"I think a big concern is that people could potentially steal the engine and claim it as their own   I don't agree with this mentality. If you ever looked at the open source licenses themselves, you'll notice the popular licenses, even the more lenient ones, include attribution clauses, allowing for the possibility of issuing legal take-downs against anyone who doesn't credit the original developer or even claims the work as their own. You're not giving up your copyright by making code open-source, you're mearly giving your code to the public under certain conditions.   or hackers really messing with the game   I don't understand this concern. The MOTHER community has quite a history of hacking the games. PK Hack exists for a reason, and I've never seen anyone being offended by it.   making it open source is making sure there is a bond or trust between the devs and the audience to ensure that they won't mess around with something they've been making for several years now   Unless you plan on giving everyone access to the system contain which the original and the only copy to the code, I do not see how you would worry about people messing around with it. When someone forks your code, you're in no way obligated to accept their changes, you don't have to accept their changes, you don't even have to acknowledge the fork exists. The original game it's original code is still going to be there, and it's still going to exist for people to enjoy. But you can benefit to allowing the public to mess with your code, such as recieving helpful bug fixes or other various improvements, such as having it ported to other platforms (as you stated before)."
mother4,2xisxd,GhostSonic,3,Sun Mar 8 09:30:44 2015 UTC,"While I have 0 experience with open source games, I do believe that the GPL would be able to defend LEGALLY against stealing and not giving back attitude certain people seems to have."
mother4,2xisxd,GhostSonic,1 point,Sun Mar 1 13:38:46 2015 UTC,"I feel like the GPL would be too strict of a license for a game engine like this. IANAL, but based on my research from into the GPL, the viral nature of it could essentially force anyone who decided to use the engine for their own game to also license all of their work under the GPL as well, including all the assets (the GPL can be applied to things that aren't code after all). It would be very discouraging for anyone to use it outside of basic modifications to the game."

There's another version of the theme in the trailer which makes me believe there's just different versions in different locations."
mother4,2xg77q,GrandMasterBox,1 point,Sat Feb 28 11:29:42 2015 UTC,"Music composer/ beginning programmer here.   I noticed it sounded different too. however the reason is most likely that they have decided on using a somewhat bit crushed MIDI based track version of the song, that uses ""bit crushed"" samples of the original versions instruments and such. Most likely they might be still in development with their sound, Or they plan to make the game use the MIDI based program which reads the individual MIDI commands and outputs the samples (I.E. the song Boom town lounge) to make it feel like a real pixel video game, one that doesn't use prerecorded music. but I don't know for sure, I'm not on the team. this is my best guess though"
mother4,2xf0h8,TehBoo1Two,3,Sat Feb 28 01:10:45 2015 UTC,"Nice analysis, 2 main things  -Use Your Head: the term implies that when you take ""mortal damage"" ( your HP is going down possibly to zero) then it decreases at a steady pace allowing you to think fast, maybe heal yourself, run away or go for the finishing blow! Same as EB/M3  -GROOVY!: This extra turn has been confirmed by Zane (M4 developer) to be acquired simply by attacking, then your GROOVY gauge (border around yur HP box) will go up  (SIDE NOTE )I personally believe the Ultimate Vitamin would only make your attacks SMASH and not make the sound system easier, that would make battles (maybe boss battles) too easy  Just my input :)"

mother4,2xf0h8,thomar,2,Sat Feb 28 05:10:41 2015 UTC,It was a strong ability that could be reflected by the Franklin Badge. It seems to have become PK Flash.

And by the way the blinding aspect of PK DarkNess added also to the new PK Flash.  I love PK Beam it is the strongest offensive PSI if translated to new games.

I haven't played Mother 2/3 in a while, but I think an HP of 500 was common in the very last parts of the game. Do you think that the Modern Mind is one of the last bosses, or one of the walk around enemies towards the near end of the game?"
mother4,2xf0h8,abruce123412,3,Sat Feb 28 19:51:24 2015 UTC,"I'd say it was a walk-around enemy, like you said. The devs wouldn't show us a boss this early, right? Also, yeah. Look at their stats, the fight was probably mid-late game."
mother4,2xf0h8,Miniced,2,Sat Feb 28 19:58:54 2015 UTC,"Here's some stuff I think might happen in Mother 4, it derives some inspiration form your theories:   A destroyed New Pork City will make an appearance, and similar to the ghost castle in Mother 3, you'll need to recover an artifact from it The ""distraction mechanic"" (were a character can't attack because of a certain reason) will appear, this time taking on daydreaming Similar to Mother 3, if you level up too much, you can just run into enemies Escape rats will return, but be more useful enabling escape from any area, not just caves An old version of one of the protagonists or their teammates will teach you PSI (similar to the magipsies from Mother 3) most likely being Poo or Lucas A time traveling thing will enable you to visit Eagleland (though this is probably the most unlikely thing to happen) The Sprinting Psycho was overlooked by many fans. I think he might be like Claus from Mother 3 (were he was kidnaped and forced to join the modern men by using one of those megaman helmets). The GROOVY mechanic will deal slightly more damage Instead of a dog like all the other characters, Travis will have a cat or no animals, and that dog he talked to will act as a party member during the beginning I noticed segments were Meryl was alone with Floyd, and were Travis was alone with Floyd. This means either when a party member is sent to the hospital they stay there for a while (sort of like the fevers that Lucas and Kutamora got but they are healing during this time instead of learning PSI), or Travis meats Floyd, then he sends him to go get Meryl because she's in trouble (similar to Earthbound or Mother 2's segment were Paula was kidnapped by Pokey in the Monotipoli building, or corse this means that she is in the party for a little while) Another overlooked portion of the trailer shows a train. In a screenshot, Travis is on said train. This means he moved to the new area were the game takes place, or this will replace the bus system In the trailer, Leo is seen near what looks like one of those news box thingies, this means you can get hints both from hint men and from the news! The needle thing summons the modern men"
mother4,2xf0h8,ncmggr,2,Sat Mar 14 16:30:01 2015 UTC,i hope the melty robot theme gets a remix/upload

mother4,2xf0h8,MrMcKonz,2,Sat Feb 28 01:25:55 2015 UTC,"I've put this in the megathread but during the sections were he's fighting the melted robots to highlight the ""Groovy!"" mechanic, as you switch to Meryl and you look at the battle options, its says ""TALk"" under Floyd where it would say ""PSI"" for Travis and Meryl which means his greatest asset is his way with words. Also, since Floyd is described on the main website as ""Quick witted and street smart, this blue collar school boy doesn't seem to need psychic powers to be an asset. Floyd's charm and confidence make him dependable even if he's a bit slow to adapt."" It can be assumed that all his special techniques are means of manipulating his enemies through speech that probably do not cause any direct damage to them. They most likely weaken/strengthen stats, cause status effects that reflect the state of mind of the enemies (because when some says the wrong things sometimes it can really play with your mind), or affect the turn of enemies like you said."
mother4,2xf0h8,CzarSquid,2,Sat Feb 28 07:15:53 2015 UTC,"There's two things that I think of now: 1) the spiky icon animated things mean that Floyd is being influential, and 2) that he can use the Talk command to bribe certain enemies. Like, say, psychos that sprint. (Look at the slightly older Mother 4 website if you don't get what that means.)"
mother4,2xf0h8,sharpspike39,2,Sun Mar 1 03:29:09 2015 UTC,Very thorough. Well done!
mother4,2xf0h8,Nameguy,2,Sat Feb 28 01:26:30 2015 UTC,"-The clerk asks you if you'd like to check out at day or night. This probably means that there is a day/night system in the game. I was thinking this day/night system would be similar to the one used in Pokemon.    I'm thinking it would be more like Zelda Skyward Sword. You got to decide when it was day and night in that game. I'm not positive but I find this system would be easier to program and be super user friendly.   -The dog asks Travis if they can be ""pals"". I was thinking maybe you can recruit temporary party members?   I feel like your are digging too deep. It seems to be a bit of earthbound humor going on. Be neat to have but I doubt it will be a feature.  Other than that it was a good read. Thanks for the insights of the trailer. It's incredible how much you can pick up when you have so little to work with."
mother4,2xfbjv,CzarSquid,2,Sat Feb 28 02:55:24 2015 UTC,"Interesting design. Personally, I'm glad the Mother games never jumped to 3D like they had intended for Mother 3. There's just a certain charm to the quirky pixel art."
mother4,2xfbjv,bluebreeze52,1 point,Sat Feb 28 03:06:54 2015 UTC,"I love how the 2d art is both simple and crisp. Honestly, I don't care too much about the graphics as long as it is consistent and works with the gameplay.  I don't know why but I always liked the older graphics of the N64. There was something mysterious about them that I really liked. I know it isn't much in but this was my 3-4th attempt at modeling in 3d."
mother4,2xfbjv,bluebreeze52,1 point,Sat Feb 28 03:20:05 2015 UTC,"Modeling is hard, but it easily sits as something from N64. The simple shapes make it easy on the eyes, unlikely the fugliness of N64 Facade. XD   Top left: http://mother3.fobby.net/notes/npscan2.jpg"
mother4,2xfbjv,Pavlovee,2,Sat Feb 28 03:28:00 2015 UTC,"Haha, yeah. There is a lot of bad looking characters because polygons were worth their weight in gold on the n64 (literally). The art that I like the most was the landscapes, places you could explore. It would of been really neat to see New Pork City and some of the other locations they had completed. Since Mother 3 was practically a direct port of the N64 game they had most of the locations done (or half completed). I've scoured as much as I can of Mother 3 beta shots. The one I wish they had done in the gba game was the destruction of Onett. All there is a few pictures on it but it's really eerie.  I think the big reason why I like n64 graphics it is because I grew up with that system. It was really smooth and vibrant compared to the PS. Low resolution does some weird stuff to the minds too. It can feel more real because your mind fills in the lack of resolution. Some of the scariest games made are made this way."
mother4,2xfbjv,Destro_,2,Sat Feb 28 03:42:12 2015 UTC,"You make it look so adorable! I can't believe you just started with 3d modeling, it look so nice!. I've been trying it but I can hardly make weird circles with bumps on them, haha! I'll keep practicing :)"

I kind of like to imagine that he's just as strong psychic wise as Meryl, but refuses to use it too often because he wants to prove that he's a rough tough guy. So personally, I think he's just gonna have super strong PSI moves that only do offensive attacks. Or in a sence, basically Poo. It's interesting to think about, but I still think that Poo's abilities fit Leo more than Paula's."
mother4,2xcny6,Destro_,1 point,Fri Feb 27 15:21:06 2015 UTC,Didn't Poo use other PSI unlike Paula? Anyways I think that he just has to be more like Poo because if he isn't he could be OP. Like having a Poo with Paulas psychic abilities...
mother4,2xcny6,Destro_,1 point,Fri Feb 27 20:55:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Poo had certain moves that Paula and Ness didn't have, like PSI Starstorm and PK Brainshock. He also was the only one that could use PSI Thunder Ω and PK Healing Ω, but he couldn't use PSI Freeze Ω or any PSI Fire at all. But yeah, he shared some PSI/PK moves with both Paula and Ness along with having his own PSI/PK moves."
mother4,2xcny6,V0ID115,2,Fri Feb 27 21:09:05 2015 UTC,"I think Leo will fill Poo's role, Not physically weak, but wielding dangerous PSI to support his good physical attributes."

Anything 'round' or 'solid', he can hit back, if he has the right bat equipped. So rather than chance, you just need to own a certain weapon for Travis. That's just my thought however, and you could be right as well. Other than that point, I agree with everything else said here. Seems quite plausible."

mother4,2x8qlr,captainth,1 point,Thu Feb 26 16:20:49 2015 UTC,"Probably a combination of a rare weapon and a timed skill.  Like a 1/128 rarity bat near the end of the game that reflects projectiles back if you time the button press at the moment the projectile ""hits"" you."
mother4,2x8qlr,ArmoredChocobo,1 point,Fri Feb 27 04:04:11 2015 UTC,I think its more likely that Travis could equip slingshots or bats or stuff like that and he can hit round projectiles back with his bat. Would make sense wouldn't it? But maybe the bats have a downside like hitting only 1/4 of the time? So he doesn't need a special bat but a bat in general.  Or maybe this is like a new PSI called PSI ReflexUp (Or maybe even the good old QuickUp?) that increases evade rate and can lead to Travis hitting super fast projectiles?
mother4,2x9o1t,Nervi403,1 point,Thu Feb 26 20:00:14 2015 UTC,Well... after thinking about 2 minutes it seems like neither Meryl nor Leo could use PSI Magnet since that always was a recovery move... Wouldn't a PSI cool to change daytime from day to night? since we now have a difference? :) And what do you think? Will the heartbeat of sleeping enemies tell us about their rhythm?  Lets hope they bring the old PK Flash back... But from what we've seen so far I even would presume they bring us PK DarkNess instead :)
mother4,2x9o1t,Seaofechoes,1 point,Thu Feb 26 20:08:09 2015 UTC,After revisiting every material I noticed... They never showed us Travis PSI at all... Interesting.  Except that possible PSI Telepathy use...

It seems like a neat way to connect it to the mother universe while keeping it its own thing, as the excuse would be that when going through time Porky stole the green slime technology from this time period, but the Mother 4 story will revolve around modern men and the green slime independent of Porky's intrusion or the rest of the mother series."

mother4,2x6qzw,bluebreeze52,7,Thu Feb 26 02:22:53 2015 UTC,"I thought about that too, but then the OTHER enemies came into consideration; the monsters. They've all had reason in each game so far. In EarthBound they were mostly people/animals/inanimate objects crazed by Giygas' evil presence in the earth. In Mother 3, the monsters were mostly Pigmasks or 'chimeras', CREATED by the Pigmasks. My idea on it was something like this; The Modern Men are, as you were saying, like the bounds placed by society, but with a twist; they're into 'modern art'. The enemies are all poppy colors or something that resembles art. There's those yellow,blue and pink jar/pot-like monsters that were chasing Travis and friends, in some other screenshots, there was something resembling the Abstract Art that's been in most of the franchise installments, and the Modern Men even have a sense of art about them; look at the Modern Mind. It looks like a guy in a flashy suit, but his head is exploded, and it looks like paint bursted out. Not to mention the large spike-like structure seen in the first trailer, with the green blob on it. So far it seems like they deal in different forms of art; sculptures, pottery, paintings, etc.. I suppose we'll just need to wait and see."
mother4,2x6qzw,spritefuser,5,Thu Feb 26 02:45:31 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the graffiti we see Leo drive by in the trailer. That is an interesting idea. A group who want to remake the world and the stars themselves into their own twisted idea of art, and targeting anyone who they think may get in their way."
mother4,2x6qzw,spritefuser,2,Thu Feb 26 02:49:29 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly, I can't wait to see if that's really the case. When you said 'remake the world and stars themselves', I was reminded of the comet that the Modern Man threw at Travis in the battle at the end of the trailer. We could be getting somewhere with this."
mother4,2x6qzw,spritefuser,1 point,Thu Feb 26 02:55:27 2015 UTC,"Not to mention when we see Travis stargazing there's something in the sky we can see that's moving, and there's the screenshot of Travis running from a UFO. There'll definitely be some sci-fi elements to this game that may go beyond those of previous Mother games."
mother4,2x6qzw,spritefuser,2,Thu Feb 26 02:58:45 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Also, the lesser Modern Men seem to be wearing some sort of head device, like a helmet; kind of like something you'd see from Star Wars. Sci-Fi elements in Mother 4 would be great."

Like a wacky Borg.  Probably also a cult mentality, a ""If you're not with us, you're against us"" kind of thing.

I was thinking the strange tower might be something similiar to Evil Mani Mani, in that it controls minds, perhaps a big, radio-towerlike Happy Box. And that the Modern Men are brainwashed people. I'm guessing they're affiliated with Giygas in some way, or perhaps they are some natural protectors, who came after Porky ruined the Nowhere Islands. Maybe they're affiliated with the Dark Dragon."

mother4,2x4ye8,XeniKobalt,2,Wed Feb 25 21:42:20 2015 UTC,"I did. While I will miss the old level up tracks, these new ones blend together really nicely. I'm still curious as to how Zack's new level up will sound(and why he was absent from the trailer all together)."
mother4,2x4ye8,bluebreeze52,3,Wed Feb 25 22:12:07 2015 UTC,"My guess is that he'll be a temporary character, like Flint was in Mother 3."
mother4,2x4ye8,XeniKobalt,2,Thu Feb 26 00:51:02 2015 UTC,"I actually kinda hated how they did that, cause Flint was awesome."
mother4,2x4ye8,bluebreeze52,3,Thu Feb 26 01:03:48 2015 UTC,"So was Ned Stark, another badass father, but at least Flint's got a good head on his shoulders!"
mother4,2x4ye8,XeniKobalt,4,Thu Feb 26 02:30:26 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt the change-in-composition was a result of the Groovy occurring. imo, it sounds like the natural progression of the song."
mother4,2x4ye8,dillonEh,2,Wed Feb 25 22:02:31 2015 UTC,"I noticed this as well, and thought the same thing. I'm not sure they'd do that though, because of how much time it'd take to make 2 versions of every battle theme; with and without the Groovy effect. But if they did, two thumbs up. I wouldn't be surprised if that IS how they did it, everything else seems just as amazing so far."
mother4,2x4ye8,spritefuser,2,Wed Feb 25 22:43:31 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure this was intentional.   There was a video a while back that showed how the end music stacked to create a different song dependent on who leveled up. They put a huge focus on dynamic music in this game and it's fantastic. There's a soundcloud with some preview tracks as well. Sorry for not providing links, I'm on mobile at work."
mother4,2x4ye8,PSIStarstormOmega,2,Thu Feb 26 00:24:44 2015 UTC,Don't forget about the magypsies that were named after some tone arrangements from old catholic church songs... Or something like that. Just google Mixolydian mode and you will understand what I mean. That was a strange musics lessen though...
mother4,2x59dn,freshandsticky,8,Wed Feb 25 19:44:14 2015 UTC,"If you've played Smash Brothers, you'll recognize Ness and Lucas. Ness was the main character in Earthbound(Mother 2 in Japan) and Lucas was the main character of Mother 3. I recommend playing Earthbound first, as Mother 1 was very grind heavy and tedious, so Earthbound is a much better entry point for the series. Plus it was the only Mother game we Americans got, so it's good to give appreciation to what we have."
mother4,2x59dn,bluebreeze52,1 point,Wed Feb 25 19:48:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks, earthbound is the one on the wiiu?"
mother4,2x59dn,bluebreeze52,4,Wed Feb 25 19:50:05 2015 UTC,"It is. It's on the Eshop for real cheap. After that, I do highly recommend trying Mother 3, the only issue is you'll need to patch it with the fan translation and play on a GBA emulator."
mother4,2x59dn,spritefuser,1 point,Wed Feb 25 19:51:17 2015 UTC,"I started with EarthBound (Mother 2), then Mother 3. I've yet to play Mother 1 (EarthBound Zero), but I do recommend playing it last, since I hear it wasn't as easy as the other two, and the graphics made it hard to get interested in as well. I will be playing it soon enough. As for Mother 3, you'll need to download a fan translation patch for the GBA ROM and play it on an emulator after patching the ROM. OR, if you want to spend a bit of cash, you go on certain sites (such as Etsy) and find the actual Mother 3 GBA cart, already pre-patched with the English 1.2 version. I ordered one from Etsy and I'm finding it quite enjoyable to play on my GBA SP or DS Lite. It will, however, cost you a bit of extra cash. I paid $28.79 for mine."
mother4,2x59dn,Pavlovee,1 point,Thu Feb 26 03:06:02 2015 UTC,"Well, I would recommend you to play them on order Mother,Earthbound and then Mother 3, but Mother is really tedious to play and if you play it first it may be difficult for you to get into the series (I played them in order,tho!). You should play them like this: Earthbound, Mother 3 and then Mother. Also there's a patch for Mother to make it easier so it isn't as frustrating sometimes, there's also a patch from the anniversary that retouched the graphics :) Also try to don't read spoilers of the games, I feel that way make you enjoy them more than already knowing what's going to happen!"

I don't think they'd have bothered giving us such a particular estimate, considering their last estimate was just ""Winter"".  Either way, I wouldn't hold it against them. They ought to make the best game they can by whatever means necessary! Who's to say how many/how few members of staff they've got bug-testing it?"
mother4,2x12uu,captainth,-4,Wed Feb 25 17:18:00 2015 UTC,It's not a real Nintendo game until it's been delayed for more than 6 months

mother4,2x12uu,themagpieswarble,-1,Tue Feb 24 22:20:32 2015 UTC,"I honestly thought it looked a little jerky. Good. Sophisticated. But you could still tell that it was a fangame. There was just the slightest bit of latency when characters would move, the way screens scrolled, it just ... It wasn't ""there"" for me, yet. I hope it's a little more polished."

mother4,2x12uu,Ghostmasks,4,Wed Feb 25 00:05:36 2015 UTC,"Hypothetical question here...  Now, I know this is a naive prospect. But if, say, Nintendo did go about acknowledging MOTHER 4 at some capacity (via Twitter, or something) would there be any legal complications in doing so? I read that Shigesato Itoi has already given his blessings for future fan-developed entries, and it is a non-profit game.   Again, just to clarify - I'm not asking if Nintendo would do it. I'm asking if there'd be any legal ramifications if they happened to be that awesome."
mother4,2x12uu,Jugg1es,5,Wed Feb 25 17:33:37 2015 UTC,"This is looking great! I think the battle UI overhaul makes everything look a lot more open. I also noticed Boom Town Lounge played a fairly prominent role in the trailer. We heard it and variations on it a lot. Is this the game's ""theme""? I'd be surprised if it were, to be honest.  Also, a small oversight I noticed: around here, it says ""Maximum PP Went up by 8!"" but I'm pretty sure ""went"" shouldn't be capitalized. It's looking good though! I'm excited."
mother4,2x12uu,Kipst3r,4,Tue Feb 24 23:29:34 2015 UTC,"Nice catch. I agree it is probably a mistake.  Regarding Boom Town Lounge: I love the song, and I loved hearing so many variations of it. But I doubt it will be the the theme of the game. My guess is that most of world-view segments in the trailer were from early parts of the game to avoid spoilers, which would explain the many Boom Town Lounge moments."

mother4,2x12uu,incantation_spewer,1 point,Wed Feb 25 03:32:32 2015 UTC,In the beginning it says in the hotel that you can stay until morning or night. Perhaps the Boom Town Lounge that we heard first is a version that plays at night?

mother4,2x12uu,Pavlovee,2,Tue Feb 24 22:42:27 2015 UTC,"!!!! I love how it look and so many things on this trailer! I think it look kinda slow? Like when running and the text, it didn't have the flow Mother 3 had (Sorry If I can't explain myself too well :/!). But I love everything else, really excited for it 😄"
mother4,2x12uu,Jackie_Chiles_Esq,1 point,Tue Feb 24 23:02:05 2015 UTC,"To be fair, in the trailer the characters were only walking, and the text speed looks sorta on par with the slower text speeds. Fingers crossed you'll be able to run and/or speed the text up!"
mother4,2x12uu,mikecard,1 point,Wed Feb 25 16:39:08 2015 UTC,"During the ""Tour Pleiades"" segment at 2:08, we see Travis jogging/running. So it seems like we will be able to do that at least!"

mother4,2x12uu,RickyRobbie,2,Wed Feb 25 17:14:22 2015 UTC,It looks like Mother and sounds like Mother. Let's just hope it also plays like Mother. Great work guys.
mother4,2x12uu,Ennu,2,Wed Feb 25 00:26:13 2015 UTC,Never been more excited for a game.

mother4,2x12uu,equalsign,2,Wed Feb 25 02:05:31 2015 UTC,"There is a border that fills up around the character's name - when it is completely filled, you get an extra turn. It's filled up via fighting."

mother4,2x14cr,idoflips31,20,Tue Feb 24 20:58:07 2015 UTC,"not to knock on the incredible stuff they've done on everything else so far, but oddly the level up song gives me the most warm fuzzies so far  edit: I suck at English"
mother4,2x14cr,Ghostmasks,10,Tue Feb 24 21:12:39 2015 UTC,"That was my first reaction to it. It's amazing. The arrangement for the level-up song is inspiring and I'm excited to hear them separately as well.  So far, the game is doing what I've been wanting games to do for a while. Use music in a contextually dynamic way to create a game that is self-aware; adding layers to the song when appropriate (Mother 3 and Dota 2 do as well)."
mother4,2x14cr,XeniKobalt,5,Wed Feb 25 00:38:48 2015 UTC,"Did you notice how after you finish going through the level up prompts, the song immediately hits an ending note? That's going to be so fun to hear every time you exit a big boss fight victorious and a level higher!"
mother4,2x14cr,delectabit,33,Tue Feb 24 23:16:40 2015 UTC,The Modern Mind has such a cool design! I'm super into everything in the video!
mother4,2x14cr,kovo11,7,Tue Feb 24 21:21:55 2015 UTC,Looks more like the creature on the poster for The Thing.

mother4,2x14cr,CzarSquid,2,Tue Feb 24 22:47:11 2015 UTC,What I love about the Modern Mind at the end is not only it's design but a glimpse of the main antagonist is going to be for the game. It's merely a tease which means there is going to be even more awesome characters in the game to discover.  I'm very excited for this game.
mother4,2x14cr,CzarSquid,22,Thu Feb 26 00:07:25 2015 UTC,They can take as long as they like to polish and buff this game so we will get the best game possible. It looks fantastic!
mother4,2x14cr,flintconfirmed,7,Tue Feb 24 21:14:56 2015 UTC,Yes. Half the reason why Mother 3 translation was so good is because Tomato took his time to make sure it was perfect. That translation took a very long time but the polish on it was so good that you didn't need the update patches.
mother4,2x14cr,TastySnax,5,Thu Feb 26 00:09:32 2015 UTC,"Mother 3: officially made, fan translated.  Mother 4: fan made, officially translated.  Prediction for the future based on current events."
mother4,2x14cr,Sapharodon,24,Tue Mar 3 06:16:40 2015 UTC,"Maybe ""being a drag"" replaces the ghosts following you?"
mother4,2x14cr,Pretty_Obvious_7,12,Tue Feb 24 21:41:02 2015 UTC,That'd actually be really clever!  But it'd be kind of weird potentially dragging three bodies behind you at once though.
mother4,2x14cr,Sapharodon,20,Tue Feb 24 21:43:36 2015 UTC,Three ghosts behind you was kinda weird too ;)
mother4,2x14cr,TastySnax,4,Tue Feb 24 22:16:14 2015 UTC,This is true lol
mother4,2x14cr,Kefkarjp,9,Tue Feb 24 22:55:40 2015 UTC,"Other than that, the only other thing it could be used for is paralyzation."
mother4,2x14cr,MonopolyRubix,3,Tue Feb 24 23:08:29 2015 UTC,"Well, in Mother 3, they weren't ghosts, they were just kinda slumped and you couldn't run. I figured this would be the same thing except the reason you couldn't run is cuz you were dragging them behind you?"
mother4,2x14cr,DigitalAge98,19,Thu Feb 26 20:05:44 2015 UTC,Awesome! I really like how they're adding new things to the battle system. It's like if the series naturally progressed. I also love how Floyd hit it off with the Hermit Can! That was funny.
mother4,2x14cr,Guiltteaman,5,Tue Feb 24 21:22:45 2015 UTC,Did you see the weird things that apeared around them after they hit it off? I think its one of his moves that have a chance to work and now the hermit can wont attack him or something.
mother4,2x14cr,Nervi403,15,Thu Feb 26 14:15:09 2015 UTC,"Guys, have you realized in the trailer, PK Beam is BACK from the first Mother game!"
mother4,2x14cr,vince94_1,3,Wed Feb 25 01:38:54 2015 UTC,But now it has a strange design...  I liked the teaser one more...
mother4,2x14cr,Nervi403,1 point,Fri Feb 27 13:26:42 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fNbJIl_Mkg   I actually didn't like the teaser's PK Beam design. It wasn't as ""EarthBound-y"" as the current one, more ""generic RPG spell."""
mother4,2x14cr,dudebro117,1 point,Sat Feb 28 15:47:57 2015 UTC,Well you are right about the most part but if it would still be the beam coming from above the enemy I would like it more. Kinda don't know why. But the new design isn't bad at all. It just seems so... simple. I don't know why. Maybe its because of the beams coming from you
mother4,2x14cr,Alamantus,1 point,Sat Feb 28 21:39:03 2015 UTC,"Uh, PK Beam was in the teaser from a year and a half ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fNbJIl_Mkg"
mother4,2x14cr,dillonEh,15,Fri Feb 27 00:22:23 2015 UTC,"Oh man. I am so excited!! I want to play this so bad.  Looking at the part where you ride the motorcycle through the city, it looks hard to see where you can actually go because of the camera angle. Is there previous knowledge involved (like a cutscene or something that shows you the alleyway) or do you have to just kind of push up against the walls until you find alleyways?"
mother4,2x14cr,Jebobek,7,Tue Feb 24 21:05:27 2015 UTC,"It's probably supposed to be somewhat of a secret, not unlike the treehouse in Onett."
mother4,2x14cr,MoxZero,4,Thu Feb 26 06:42:53 2015 UTC,"This design was carried over from previous Mother titles. I'd suggest a little view window around the character unless the design is on purpose for secrets/exploration, which is fine."
mother4,2x14cr,Kefkarjp,15,Tue Feb 24 23:27:40 2015 UTC,"This feels like a direct sequel to Earthbound. Mother 3 just had a different feel to it, with the setting, and chapters. This one seems to play like Earthbound. I will stay up all night playing this game. I haven't done that in forever. Skyrim came close, but that will be nothing compared to this game!"
mother4,2x14cr,Monochrome90,8,Tue Feb 24 23:48:26 2015 UTC,"I find it looks like a cross between the two. Definitely setting-wise it looks like Earthbound but the music seems to be somewhere in between the two styles, and some of the snippets of dialogue crossed with some of the soundtrack (plus names of some of the tracks) makes me feel like this game is going to have some emotional moments in it along the lines of Mother 3's much more emotionally-driven plot.  Granted, Earthbound had a lot more emotion in it than I realized playing it as a kid, which I think a lot of people probably don't appreciate until they grow up and move out on their own. For example, calling your mom just to hear her voice so you feel better."
mother4,2x14cr,Seaofechoes,3,Thu Feb 26 20:09:06 2015 UTC,"I'm playing Mother 3 at the moment, and so far I only have two complaints:  The first is (because I played Earthbound first) the fantasy theme seems a bit off to me. The ATMs and Drug Stores of Earthbound were much more to my liking than the castles and save frogs of Mother 3  The second is that I feel like I walk faster when going diagonally in Mother 3. I'm sure I'm just imagining it, or it's the emulator on my phone, but it just irks me a little bit.   But apart from that, I'm really enjoying the game."
mother4,2x14cr,Monochrome90,2,Thu Feb 26 11:23:39 2015 UTC,Nope. You are in fact correct. You do move faster while walking/running diagonally.
mother4,2x14cr,sadrius,1 point,Fri Feb 27 04:28:01 2015 UTC,Why? It just seems silly to me.
mother4,2x14cr,captainth,6,Sat Feb 28 05:09:20 2015 UTC,"Imagine that the character is positioned on the top-left corner of a 1x1 square. To move from that corner to the top-right corner (horizontally) or bottom-left corner (vertically), the character travels 1 unit. To travel to the bottom-right corner (diagonally), the character must travel a distance equal to the square root of 2 units, or ~1.41429 units.  In 2d games like Earthbound and Mother 3, these units are pixels. Because √2 is not an integer, getting a character to move the same speed horizontally, vertically, and diagonally would require drawing the character sprites at non-integer pixel coordinates. Doing so would result in the sprites looking distorted or blurry, depending on the graphics hardware."
mother4,2x14cr,Monochrome90,2,Fri Mar 13 22:42:56 2015 UTC,That was a very good explanation.
mother4,2x14cr,sadrius,1 point,Sat Mar 14 00:26:15 2015 UTC,"But I never noticed it when I played Earthbound on my Wii U? It was only Mother 3 on my phone.   That was an amazing explanation, by the way."
mother4,2x14cr,Monochrome90,5,Sun Mar 15 20:56:23 2015 UTC,"EDIT: I forgot how to math.  In Mother 3, characters move 1 pixel when moving horizontally or vertically, and √2 pixels when moving diagonally (1 horizontal + 1 vertical), as I explained above.  However, in Earthbound, characters move 3 pixels when moving horizontally or vertically, and √8 pixels when moving diagonally (2 horizontal + 2 vertical). Why √8? Time for some correct maths!  a^2 + b^2 = c^2     2^2 + 2^2 = c^2   // 2 pixels horizontal + 2 pixels vertical 4 + 4 = c^2     8 = c^2     √8 = √(c^2) ~2.83 = c   ~2.83 (although close to 3) is less than 3, which means that in Earthbound, Ness actually moves slower when moving diagonally. Your perception is correct!"
mother4,2x14cr,sadrius,2,Mon Mar 16 03:31:34 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks! I think I understand it now!"
mother4,2x14cr,bluecanaryflood,2,Mon Mar 16 04:23:30 2015 UTC,"Actually, I got my math wrong (I blame it on lack of coffee). In Earthbound, you actually move slower when going diagonally!"

What I liked: Several NPCs with custom animations to flesh out the world, ""They really hit it off!"", the gorgeous sky and colorful town, the modern mind, everything about the adapting level-up tune, the nearly-hidden groovy meter, the great backgrounds, the spaced-out echoy effects on a lot of the tracks, the ""run away from these"" overworld enemy-sprites, and the different tones of different battles (the poppy colorful battle with the Stickat to the spacey Modern Mind fight)  Concerned/Curious about:  -The counter mechanic. Is this an action you input, such as defend? If not, sounds somewhat overpowered. I won't hate on the ultimate vitamin because I love the gameplay concept as long as it is either an item that promotes very long boss battles (because mother bosses are always amazing), or is very infrequent.   -Also, the be-a-drag animation looks a bit off. I realize it looks like it fits within SNES limitations and thus reflects the mother 2 look, but maybe adding a few clawing animations to floyd would spice it up a bit. Although I don't know how or why this exists so maybe it makes more sense in context.  -I also absolutely love the combo sounds, but it sounds a tad bit out of place with Meryl's during the soda/flamingo fight. Not really sure how to remedy this, unless the sound effect adapted to the track. Not really a huge issue with that example, but I'd keep it in mind.  -Some of the spots looked a tiiiny bit static. You mostly avoided this with a waving flag, or the above-mentioned custom npc animtions, but it's harder to do when it's just a grassy hill with the only animation coming form a nearby river. I'd like you to consider flowing grass/trees/particle effects, but at the same time, your static sprites are so crisp and clean that I don't want that fine look to be sacrificed in any way.  Anyway, I'm completely floored. I'm already dying waiting for the next gameplay video. It was so little but so polished, that I can't even. This is definitely my most hyped release of the recent years."
mother4,2x14cr,gameonion,10,Wed Feb 25 09:32:33 2015 UTC,"I am so fucking excited to play this game, I can't stand it. The music sounds amazing, dudes."
mother4,2x14cr,IdrisSamatar,8,Tue Feb 24 21:31:36 2015 UTC,What was that Modern Mind?A  Member of the Modern Men?
mother4,2x14cr,Lead_Dragon,10,Tue Feb 24 20:55:18 2015 UTC,Seems so. Although I think it'll serve a similar purpose to the Starmen in Earthbound. Sorta like a mid-boss kinda enemy that's moderately difficult
mother4,2x14cr,francy3100,2,Tue Feb 24 21:12:04 2015 UTC,"Well, they levelled up to around level 60, so I'd wager it's an important boss."
mother4,2x14cr,thomar,6,Sat Feb 28 19:17:29 2015 UTC,I think that would be a substitute for Starmen.
mother4,2x14cr,Adan_Jr,3,Tue Feb 24 21:12:37 2015 UTC,A few people have noticed that it looks a lot like the poster for The Thing.

mother4,2x14cr,betternotbeclaimed,6,Thu Feb 26 12:19:40 2015 UTC,I'm starting to regret watching the trailer. Now my hype levels are off the charts and it'll make waiting for the game to come out that much harder.

mother4,2x14cr,power464646,4,Tue Feb 24 20:57:12 2015 UTC,"that music playing with the Stickat sounds a lot like Anamanaguchi, even with Floyd's hitting noise thing like in Mother 3. I'm now secretly hoping Anamanaguchi did something in this game, that would be soooo rad."

mother4,2x14cr,PSIStarstormOmega,8,Wed Feb 25 07:48:09 2015 UTC,"MOTHER 4 - COMING WINTER 2014  MOTHER 4 - COMING THIS SUMMER   If this game didn't look so freaking awesome I'd be really upset. But, I'm not. I'm still just as excited.  Also, you guys should really look into how much it would cost to buy the rights to Earthbound. Nintendo is just sitting on it, and if they had even the slightest piece of integrity in them, they'd let the fans take over it. I'd pay at least $50 for a copy of mother 4, as long as it is the same length or longer than Earthbound."
mother4,2x14cr,vince94_1,8,Tue Feb 24 21:11:52 2015 UTC,You really think they would sell the right to include Ness in future smash/nintendo compilation games?

mother4,2x14cr,EveMK89,1 point,Wed Feb 25 19:37:08 2015 UTC,"Itoi most likely knows about this game already, it's common knowledge that he monitors at least a few fan sites after all."

mother4,2x14cr,HalexNOR,2,Wed Mar 4 07:03:34 2015 UTC,"So I've been piecing together what we know about Mother 4 thematically... You've got the reoccurring visual clue of that odd goo-like ectoplasm stuff. You've also got references to Pleiades (cluster of stars) and The Modern Mind (whose head literally looks like a galaxy) which point toward a space motif. Not unlike most Mother games, you might say. Now, back to the goo... In the ""Stargaze"" segment of the trailer, you might have noticed a disparate blob of what'd presumingly be that same goo we've already seen time-and-time again, floating about; up into space. There's that, and that rhombus rod in the first teaser, which appeared to be coated in the stuff. Finally, the logo... The planet is literally dripping. With all that said, let's assume that the planet (Earth?) is being tapped for resources, or something. ...Look, it's being tapped. That's what matters here.   Anyway, I've noticed something. I'll need you to think back to EarthBound. Back to the Stongehenge Base. Remember those people held captive in the tubes? I can't remember why exactly they were there, but what I do remember is that in Mother 3, they were used to condition its subjects into adoring ""Master"" Porky. Suspiciously, ""the goo"" happens to be almost the exact same shade of green as the liquid seen previously in those tubes, in Mother 3.  Now, I doubt Mother 4 is a direct sequel to Mother 3, or takes place after the events of it (that'd detract from the open-endedness of Mother 3's ending). I also doubt that they'll bring back Porky as the big bad, seeing as everything's already been done with the character. Consider this - what if the Modern Men are the spiritual descendants of Starmen? What if that ""goo"" happens to be the same fluid that was once used to hold those citizens captive? The same fluid that had mind-washing properties?  What if they're trying to continue Giygas' legacy? What if they're trying to study/alter the fluid to better control the citizens of the planet? I do realize this is completely ridiculous and absolutely far fetched. But hey, I'm having fun! (And for the record, I'm personally hoping that they'll introduce an all-new cast of goodies, and baddies.)"
mother4,2x14cr,thomar,2,Sun Mar 1 00:16:33 2015 UTC,That was awesome! Can't wait!
mother4,2x14cr,HalexNOR,2,Tue Feb 24 21:01:26 2015 UTC,"Oh gosh, this looks and sounds absolutely astounding."
mother4,2x14cr,thomar,1 point,Tue Feb 24 21:08:12 2015 UTC,Was one of the battle themes from Kool & the Gang?
mother4,2x14cr,HalexNOR,1 point,Tue Feb 24 21:10:53 2015 UTC,"Not sure, haven't really considered it. Which one in particular did you mean?   It does seem like a lot of the music I've heard so far draws inspiration from jazzfunk and similar styles of music. The battle theme at 0:43 reminds me of something out of K&TG but with heavy nuances of nu disco.   The theme at 1:46 does remind me a bit of ""She's Fresh"", but in my opinion it sounds much more like spanish flamenco.   2:15 is too short to really say anything about, but I'm guessing it's going to be a nu-disco/electronica piece based on what we've seen so far. I could be and probably am totally wrong though. :p  The one at 2:44 sounds like some chillout lounge stuff, but I'm not very into that type of genre so I wouldn't know very well."
mother4,2x14cr,ieatllamas,2,Tue Feb 24 21:31:45 2015 UTC,2:15 is definitely a few bars of Celebration by Kool & the Gang.

mother4,2x14cr,thomar,4,Tue Feb 24 21:59:16 2015 UTC,All of them.

mother4,2x14cr,ncmggr,2,Wed Feb 25 02:12:03 2015 UTC,"Alright, so we know there's gonna be day and night features. Roaming Boom Town at night would be amazing. And Floyd can 'chat' with enemies, so I'm assuming this, in turn, would disable him from attacking. I really like the new features and such that were shown. Can't wait 'til we get this, gonna have an all-nighter the day it's finished."
mother4,2x14cr,Nervi403,2,Tue Feb 24 21:58:51 2015 UTC,"And Floyd can 'chat' with enemies, so I'm assuming this, in turn, would disable him from attacking.   Might be a way to read their weaknesses too."
mother4,2x14cr,eXXot0ster13,2,Wed Feb 25 05:01:07 2015 UTC,"I thought so as well, since from the screenshots show a scorpion-like enemy telling you it's weaknesses, but then I noticed Floyd had fainted already. So I dunno, but it's a possibility. Maybe Travis was meant to have the Chat feature, but they changed it to Floyd since then. Only time will tell."
mother4,2x14cr,BardicKTL,2,Wed Feb 25 18:41:14 2015 UTC,"Also, during the sections were he's fighting the melted robots, as you switch to Meryl and you look at the battle options, its says ""TALk"" under Floyd where it would say ""PSI"" for Travis and Meryl"

Speaking of which, what happened to the old videos? I get they aren't the same as what it is now, but did they have to delete them?"
mother4,2x14cr,eXXot0ster13,2,Tue Feb 24 22:17:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said; they sound rather thin compared to the richness they had before.  I'm just really glad I converted the video of the old ones to an MP3 last year, but I'll now have to treat the file like a diamond."

mother4,2x14cr,milkmantoast,2,Wed Mar 4 17:10:21 2015 UTC,"So I noticed in the ""Be a drag"" section of the trailer that the background music had a part that sounds like morse code. Though I may have done it wrong I translated this code to BEB. I don't know if this is significant, or possibly a part of a bigger message. Maybe even just a coincidence. If I translated it wrong, and it does actually mean something please let me know."
mother4,2x14cr,TrokStop,1 point,Wed Feb 25 19:43:44 2015 UTC,What does the Morse Code in the Dusty Dunes Desert song translate to? I've always wondered. (That's probably what they're imitating here.)
mother4,2x14cr,mrdotcom1,1 point,Sat Feb 28 15:50:05 2015 UTC,"God, finally it's here. Looks so fucking good. Gonna be real, the enemy design was just a tad lacking on a few of the enemies (Modern Mind and those things from the cave were great, though), from what I've seen, but I'm sure that's just cause they didn't show many later enemies, which probably have more interesting designs. I hope the game actually ties in well with the time period, the 70's aesthetic has always been a favorite of mine. A little disappointed no one was wearing bell bottoms. :("

But seeing that trailer, hearing that music, this game is just fantastic from what I can see. The developers put their heart, souls, and desire into it and it doesn't look like they allowed themselves to pollute the game with other ideas. I hope to see other communities embracing and supporting the game. Hell, I want to see Project M work with the devs to make a fighter for brawl/PM now.

Will it be done automatically with some kind of item (like the Franklin Badge) or does it have to be timed? By the graphic, I'm guessing it can only be used by certain attacks, like bombs. Presumably, this is unique to Travis, but will other characters/enemies be able to use it, like how Ness's Nightmare and Giygas know PK Rockin, and Claus knows PK Love?"

mother4,2x24r3,dalp3000,10,Wed Feb 25 01:12:04 2015 UTC,It certainly is an odd looking contrast. I wonder what the team would say about it. Do_you_realize_what_you've_done?_The_game_will_be_delayed_for_years!
mother4,2x24r3,Ennu,5,Wed Feb 25 01:28:39 2015 UTC,"Yea, I'd be interested to see what they have to say about it, maybe they've noticed, but then again hardly anyone has I realized after posting it could have grave consequences, we could've lived in ignorance and the game released on time, now I'm afraid for what I've done"
mother4,2x24r3,Ennu,3,Wed Feb 25 01:32:29 2015 UTC,"Well, good eye on that one! I would have never picked it up by myself. On the bright side of your note, it would be a problem (if it is one) that only effects certain areas of contrast.

mother4,2x24r3,Epic563,5,Wed Feb 25 01:46:50 2015 UTC,Eugh. That looks awful when you point it out. I probably would've noticed it when I played the game but damn you're right.
mother4,2x24r3,Mswordx23,4,Wed Feb 25 01:24:49 2015 UTC,"I noticed that, but didn't think much of it. Looks fine to me  EDIT: Even Mother 2 had some wonky perspectives: http://i.imgur.com/ItmcSZB.png  But again, it looks passable and it ceased my playing (so that I could stare at it) maybe once. I'm kinda worried that this game will be held up to greater scrutiny because it's not a real Mother game, and we can basically go to town on the criticisms. Though the perspective issue isn't as bad in Mother 2, we have to remember that the official games, though near and dear to our hearts, aren't perfect. And before yelling at the M4 developers, check if the official games are guilty as well. That's my one cent. Might not even be two cents!"
mother4,2x24r3,thomar,1 point,Wed Feb 25 13:27:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, none of the Earthbound games have been slaves to the laws of perspective."
mother4,2x24r3,komnene,4,Thu Feb 26 01:36:35 2015 UTC,The perspective was wrong in the official games too ...

mother4,2x24r3,dillonEh,2,Wed Feb 25 01:48:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not really bothered by the tiles so much, possibly because they're so distorted that it preserves the illusion of a rectangular room. If they were a perfect grid-shape, they wouldn't line up on the edges with the 22.5° walls, and that would make it look like the room is actually trapezoid-shaped.  As for the cliffs in the ""Pleaides capitol"", they're not manmade objects so they don't have to follow the rules of oblique projection. But I really hate those short, Tazmily-style cliffs anyway, and in that particular shot they serve no purpose as a barrier because there are larger (and more perspective-friendly) cliffs right behind them."
mother4,2x24r3,lavamario,2,Wed Feb 25 10:51:49 2015 UTC,"I noticed it in that room as well. Are there any other examples? If not, I think they've done a fine job of applying the assets. However, it IS something that must be kept in mind and I'm happy you brought it up."

mother4,2x24r3,chickenboneneck,0,Wed Feb 25 04:05:05 2015 UTC,"I'm in the minority, but I think it looks like a decent fangame and not an official sequel. When the characters walk, it just looks ... Jerky. Unpolished. In other words, if you held the four games up, you would easily be able to pick out the fan-made game.  Without that polish, I think it's almost insulting to call this game a Mother game."

mother4,2x2vur,TrokStop,2,Fri Feb 27 01:11:33 2015 UTC,That's the idea of a team. We'll check each other's work to see how well it will adapt to the game concept.
mother4,2x2vur,PetrusHyde,3,Fri Feb 27 01:58:47 2015 UTC,"Alright, well I guess I could help out then."
mother4,2x2vur,Arxabin,2,Fri Feb 27 02:19:32 2015 UTC,"Hello. My name is Pedro, and I am from the Canary Islands. I am currently studying Modern Languages at university. I am a huge lover of the Mother saga, especially the two last iterations. I also love translating, and I have been working at an anime fansub since 2011, so I have some experience translating from English to Spanish.  I am planning on working in the Spanish (from Spain) translation for this game. Emphasis on the ""from Spain"" part, because I don't believe in ""Neutral Spanish"". I agree, as Arxabin, on making two teams; a LatAm one and a Spanish one.  I really, really want to work on this translation. I hope that, if you are going to make a translation team, you count on me for this. It would be nice to work via Slack, as /u/MrMcKonz said at the Translation Teams thread.  Edit: Introducing myself."
mother4,2x2vur,Arxabin,1 point,Sat Mar 14 11:06:54 2015 UTC,"Do you really think neutral Spanish is a good fit? Since it's a free game with translation tools avaliable, to me the best option would be to make 2 groups, one working in a Latin translation and the other tackling the European one. Maybe this is more of a personal view, but why use an artificial Spanish in this game? I´m sure we can find enough people to make both translations happen. The internet is a pretty big place."
mother4,2x2vur,Arxabin,1 point,Sat Feb 28 21:49:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about it. Look, most of the Spanish-speaking people are in the American continent. Doing a translate only for one country (Spain) looks like too much effort for a very limited audience. But, if we try to keep our Spanish maybe not neutral but understandable by everyone, we would reach a wider audience.  But that's something we should talk when more people gather. To form an opinion."
mother4,2x2vur,Arxabin,1 point,Sun Mar 1 04:07:42 2015 UTC,"Well, this was rather rude for my part, to come bashing without even introducing myself. Hi, I'm a native Spanish from the north of Spain and a Mother fan since I was a small fry sucking at Earthbound on my Snes. I've been translating a lot in the last 3 years, both for university projects (I'm studying foreign languages/translation) and on my own. I also did a couple of things professionally, but nothing major.   I've been looking for a big, group project to translate and this is absolutely perfect for me. I was just baffled that there are not enough Mother fans to make both translations happen. I guess they do exist, they are just not redditing.   I do think your idea is good the way things are, and you can absolutely count me in. Just letting you know, that if somehow an European Spanish group arises i will probably consider  joining them."

mother4,2x2vur,Arxabin,1 point,Sun Mar 8 22:54:09 2015 UTC,"Is there a way to keep in touch other than reddit? You know, to be in direct contact with the team from the start, know each other a bit, start discussing matters..."

mother4,2wdpmi,Ennu,7,Fri Feb 20 19:55:13 2015 UTC,"Kind of like how they haven't touched PM (which is in even more of a legal grey area for being a well-recognized and played mod of Brawl), they won't touch Mother 4. They won't mention it positively or negatively either; the best case is they ignore it in totality."

mother4,2wdpmi,captainth,1 point,Fri Mar 20 19:08:52 2015 UTC,Why would Nintendo ignoring it be a significantly better option than Nintendo endorsing it?
mother4,2wdpmi,Dancing_Anatolia,4,Thu Feb 19 03:20:45 2015 UTC,Because that is an unreasonable expectation.

mother4,2wdpmi,Ultimate_Cabooser,2,Sun Feb 22 22:35:12 2015 UTC,"I remember reading that the creators confirmed they're not going to make another Mother game.  Unless Nintendo hires an entire new team, I don't see it happening."
mother4,2wdpmi,carpark72,2,Sun Feb 22 02:00:00 2015 UTC,Nintendo most likely doesn't care.
mother4,2wdpmi,StageProps,2,Thu Feb 19 06:32:54 2015 UTC,"Nintendo absolutely does not care. Think about it: Itoi has said on a number of occasions that he is not at all interested in making any more MOTHER games, and Nintendo is unlikely to make any more without the man who wrote them all, so MOTHER 4 is not directly competing with any product Nintendo might want to put out someday down the line. I doubt Nintendo ""didn't know what to do"" about the MOTHER 3 fan translation; I feel like their choices were clear: shut it down or pay it no mind. A fan translation of MOTHER 3 actually cut into potential profits for Nintendo of America, since it enabled a whole community to play the game in English without paying them for it, and they didn't shut it down. We don't have anything to worry about with MOTHER 4."
mother4,2wdpmi,milkmantoast,2,Thu Feb 19 05:09:55 2015 UTC,"Why does no one care about people asking the stupid questions to no end, but the questions everyone actually wants the answers to are taboo and 'rude?'"

mother4,2w9fgn,Guiltteaman,8,Wed Feb 18 01:28:45 2015 UTC,"Well, it's absent in Mother 3 because there was never really a use for it. You never really need to revisit areas, and when you do, it automatically happens as you progress through the story.   Mother 4 seems to be stemming from Earthbound, so, it's entirely possible that it will return! We'll have to see!"

mother4,2w9fgn,ArmoredChocobo,2,Wed Feb 18 16:19:19 2015 UTC,"It was absent in mother 3 because the way the game was made didn't require it. It was a much more linear game than Earthbound, and was segmented into chapters, streamlining the game. It was also segmented into several smaller areas, as opposed to Earthbound's vast world, so it required some kind of skip travel. Being able to go wherever the hell you want on M3 would have gone against the game's design."

I would frequently rent games from a local store and upon seeing the huge box was fascinated at what could be in store! They rented out the huge player guide too, so I had the full experience. The game definitely influenced how I've looked at games since. There's a heart and inherent charm in Earthbound that is commonly absent in games. I've had the tune from Winters stuck in my head since I first heard it in the 90s.   I followed the fan translation for Mother 3 for at least a year. I downloaded the patch the day it was released and skipped a ton of college classes to finish it in what was practically one sitting. Worth it. This is when I caught wind of the Mother 4 fan game - from Starmen.net - and have been watching after it ever since. I've commonly checked into it at least once per month since then. Really excited to see it being near completion.   I've just recently played Earthbound Zero and enjoyed it as well. It's brutal, but offers a lot of unique experiences and is very rewarding along the way.   TL;DR: SNES in 90s as a kiddo, Tonda Gossa!"

He introduced me to all the Mother games and he was a big fan! He had a Mr. Saturn plush, and that Mother 3 GB Micro with the game! I think I first knew about it when I was around 9 and I couldn't get enough since. It's too bad I stopped talking to him after about middle school.   I actually played and beat Mother 3 first, then found Earthbound at a local flea market and played a majority of it (But I neglected to play it for a bit and it ended of resetting itself .-. ). I never actually finished Earthbound until about the summer of 2013 on the Virtual Console. I've beaten Mother 3 at least 3 times and I am aiming now to beat Earthbound another time, except on my SNES! Mother 1 was a game I didn't really discover until I researched the Mother games a bit more and it is quite an interesting game, but I'm waiting to play the Earthbound graphical remake of it, since it just feels quite hard for me to play a game that looks like that and I encounter so many enemies in.   I've found that all three have something great (compared to each other, but they're still great in every other way, too compared to most other games xD ) about them game wise: Mother 1 has the best music, Mother 2 has the best characters and interactions, and Mother 3 has the best story. I am very excited to see if Mother 4 can bring all three of these elements together to make one fantastic game!!"

Then in one of his streams someone mentioned Mother 4 about 6 months ago and that's how I got here.. :P (I also watched Stephenplays' LP of Earthbound too around that time)

I ended up later at the summer of 2013 hearing about Mother 3 from my cousin, who had watched some of it on a let's play. He told me to prepare to cry. I eventually figured out how to patch the translation for him and played it. I stayed up way longer than the other boys I hung out with because I could not stand to see this situation unsolved because I knew I'd be leaving soon enough. I tried to make myself finish the first chapter since I figured the situation would resolve itself then. However, I fell asleep after getting out of jail. I felt so invested ,but I had to restart it at home. I eventually figured out the connection between Mother 3 and the rest of the Mother series so I played the series backwards.

I  instantly fell in love with EB and M3 (even though i didn't even finish both games until early this year!)

Earthbound was first, followed by Mother 3 right after (started on ""end of the world"" day 2012), and Earthbound Zero a year after I started Earthbound.

I actually first searched YouTube for good videos about Mario Sunshine, and chugga's looked the best.  Fast-forward a couple months later, chugga's Sonic Colors LP is done and he begins Animal Crossing on 3DS. Egbert from his personal town moves in. He sings the anthem for ""Leafside."" He alluded to it being in some other game he did earlier. So I, against my better judgement, decided to watch the videos on a weird game called ""EarthBound""...when I heard the Giant Step portion of the music. Bingo. I decided to watch the rest of EarthBound, too. After that, I watched all his LPs until I'd watched all 3 Mother games.  As for how I found out about Mother 4...I honestly don't know. Maybe EarthBound Central.  Edit: I actually did have Smash Bros. Brawl, but I didn't play it much for some reason. Lucas didn't leave much of an impression on me, and I never unlocked Ness."

He's unsubscribing because he's tired of this happening.  He would complain about it, but someone would no-doubt tell him that it's a free project and he should be happy to be getting anything.  He pre-empts this with saying he would have paid for the game, saying that it doesn't matter if it's free, it's a dick thing to keep making hype posts when the game is still far off.

You guys we're shooting for winter of 2014, too. I think these tweets aren't trying to hype Mother 4, but I think they're supposed to show that they got something done, hense the #GameDev and not #Mother4.

mother4,2vi4by,EarthJab,1 point,Wed Feb 11 05:20:01 2015 UTC,"I'd say as long as your controller looks similar to a SNES one (Dpad, 4 buttons, 2 shoulder buttons), it should work just fine."
mother4,2vi4by,ArmoredChocobo,1 point,Wed Feb 11 21:56:05 2015 UTC,Yes there is.
mother4,2v8om3,Paraboxia,12,Sun Feb 8 23:26:42 2015 UTC,"To be honest I think it would be best to leave an English to Japanese translation to the Japanese fans. A person translating something into his native language has a distinct advantage over basically anyone else. Who better to not only translate it, but also localize it, than someone who has been speaking the language his whole life? The Japanese MOTHER fan community is aware of the game and I'm sure there are some who are eager to play it. At any rate, simply translating this game into Japanese does not by any means guarantee Itoi will play it. To be honest I highly doubt he ever will. He is an incredibly busy guy. It would be best not to get our hopes up."
mother4,2v8om3,StageProps,5,Mon Feb 9 19:01:04 2015 UTC,"Hey man, he said he wanted to: ""If there was a MOTHER 4, I'd like to play it."" - Itoi  Could have just been kidding though. But that series seems to be one with which he feels a very powerful bond, I wouldn't be too surprised if he gave it a shot."
mother4,2v8om3,PKtheworldisaplace,3,Tue Feb 10 16:02:30 2015 UTC,"I'm sure he would like to play a MOTHER 4, but that doesn't mean he'll have the time to. I would love to be wrong, though! It would be great if he played it. But I think talking about this game as if it's the heir apparent of the MOTHER series is dangerous. At the end of the day it's a fan game created by some guys in their spare time in some corner of the Internet.  I'm not trying to belittle the amount of love, blood, sweat, and tears that has gone into the production of this game. I'm sure it will be fantastic, but it's not and will never be an official MOTHER 4. It would be great if he played it or commented on it, but we have no reason suspect he will. I'd say it's better to keep our expectations low and maybe be pleasantly surprised down the line than to expect monumental things from it and end up disappointed."
mother4,2v8om3,StageProps,8,Tue Feb 10 22:50:11 2015 UTC,I think it would be great for him to see his grandchild (in a sense) since his creations have spawned this game. Having him play this may even bring upon him the feelings we all had when we played our first Mother game!
mother4,2v8om3,-Pollyanna,3,Sun Feb 8 23:50:46 2015 UTC,"Knowing how loyal the English-Japanese Mother fanbase has been in the past, I can nearly guarantee there will be a full Japanese translation of the game in no time flat."
mother4,2v8om3,XeniKobalt,3,Mon Feb 9 17:41:00 2015 UTC,"On the chance that he does play, I think Itoi would really dig the 70's vibe and aesthetic."
mother4,2v8om3,Daj87,6,Mon Feb 9 00:38:30 2015 UTC,Maybe he'll trade us for an English translation of Mother 3 on WiiU.
mother4,2v8om3,PKtheworldisaplace,3,Mon Feb 9 03:47:39 2015 UTC,A Western release would be great but I'd hate for it to be over localized...
mother4,2v8om3,PKtheworldisaplace,2,Mon Feb 9 03:52:50 2015 UTC,What do you mean?
mother4,2v8om3,rowedahelicon,3,Mon Feb 9 05:44:24 2015 UTC,"I imagine not too Americanized, the unofficial translation uses a few things that would normally be removed. (Cursing, references, etc)"
mother4,2v8om3,PKtheworldisaplace,3,Mon Feb 9 06:09:34 2015 UTC,"Well, it would be better than nothing...!"
mother4,2v9ru0,Rand0mGuy1117,6,Mon Feb 9 05:16:32 2015 UTC,Why all the downvotes? Who doesn't want a wii u release...
mother4,2v9ru0,Earthbound22,3,Tue Feb 10 22:19:41 2015 UTC,"People asks questions like these a lot, we really need to have a link to a FAQ with all the confirmed info/questions asked a lot"
mother4,2v9ru0,Hekset,1 point,Tue Feb 10 05:35:37 2015 UTC,"Dropping by to give my two cents:  In short, the way I see it is, ""Yes, they probably can port it to something like the Android OS, but it isn't a major priority to do so.""  Like /u/Destro_, what I have to say is also just my own speculation as a gamer and a very early aspiring video game designer. As we know, Mother 4 is being developed for Windows, Mac and Linux. Android is indeed based off of Linux, but that doesn't necessarily mean that any app built for Linux will run on Android. However, I think we can see that the Mother 4 team, through already developing the game for the big three operating systems, is the kind of team to do their best in getting the game out to the fans in as many ways that they're capable of -- so long as the integrity of the game remains.   With that said, we also don't know what the Mother 4 team's final goal is, beside offering the world a very quality product. So only time will tell!"
mother4,2v9ru0,Ghostmasks,1 point,Mon Feb 9 09:08:18 2015 UTC,I'd imagine that after it comes out we might be able to tweak it to run on an ARM based platform. Supposedly wine is coming to android so that may help.
mother4,2v9ru0,PotatoSenpai,1 point,Mon Feb 9 15:45:11 2015 UTC,I really want a PSP port
mother4,2v9ru0,iannoah440,1 point,Thu Feb 26 16:22:21 2015 UTC,"It's an ""educated"" guess, but seeing how it's going to be for Mac, Windows, and Linux, I would imagine yes because of how similar androids are to Windows (and Linux?). I would also take a guess and say that you could port the Mac version over on the iPhone as well? Pretty sure someone else could provide you with a better answer, but I thought I'd do my best anyway.  Also, don't quote me on any of this."
mother4,2v9ru0,Destro_,7,Mon Feb 9 06:43:14 2015 UTC,"They're really not. Android has the same kernel (core) as GNU/Linux but from there they're really different. Implementation of display, controls, all that. iOS is essentially mobile OS X but differs similarly."
mother4,2v9ru0,Paraboxia,2,Mon Feb 9 10:02:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clearing that up a bit. I'm not a huge expert, especially on the topic of phone OS. I really should know more about computers for wanting to be a computer engineer."
mother4,2v9ru0,Destro_,1 point,Mon Feb 9 10:07:07 2015 UTC,Praying for a Wii U release...
mother4,2v9ru0,Earthbound22,29,Mon Feb 9 17:10:49 2015 UTC,Earthbound22's call was absorbed by the darkness.

Makes me wonder why I put off dealing with reddit so long.  Guess the rumors of it being terrible are all about other people."
mother4,2v6z72,superhaduper,4,Sun Feb 8 14:35:12 2015 UTC,"I have nothing but respect for those who abstain from spoilers. It's very hard to do so on the internet these days, information spreads very quickly here. But it's so rewarding when you engage with completely new content yourself.  For anyone planning to do this, I suggest signing up at http://www.mother4game.com/ You won't be notified of anything other than the game's release."
mother4,2v6z72,Shrinefox,3,Sun Feb 8 21:09:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, after the trailer drops I'm unsubscribing from here. I don't want much spoiled."

mother4,2v6z72,sgeb91,2,Sun Feb 8 22:40:02 2015 UTC,"How cool. I wonder if there is any interesting EB64 info that we have forgotten about archived in here somewhere. Thanks for this!  Anyway, I agree though. I don't know if things have been ""spoiled"" for me, but I do already know a bit more about the game than I wish I did. It is just too tempting not to read replies to the AMA questions, for example!"
mother4,2v6z72,MrMcKonz,1 point,Sun Feb 8 23:35:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I want to be surprised and feel genuine emotion during my playthrough. I would avoid all of the information released (conventionally or not), but unfortunately I have to wade through it all to keep this subreddit in tip-top shape.  I DO THIS FOR YOU GUYS! YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!"
mother4,2v6z72,ArmoredChocobo,1 point,Sun Feb 8 22:30:37 2015 UTC,"I already had one of my theories debunked. I thought Mother 4 would cover the events between Earthbound and Mother 3, with the world ending, because of them saying that Mother 4 will be the darkest-themed game in the series.  Now I found out it's in 197X, making it a prequel to Earthbound Zero/Mother."
mother4,2v3k1m,ReaperWeavile,7,Sat Feb 7 15:59:47 2015 UTC,Maybe Mother 4 comes before Mother 3 but after Mother 2. And Mother 4 shows how the world turned to hell everywhere but on the island in mother 3.
mother4,2v3k1m,blacknekos,6,Sat Feb 7 16:19:54 2015 UTC,"Well, at the end of Mother 3, like everyone in the game said, the world was purged of all the evil and only the good things remained. So all of Porky's Chimeras were changed back, his cities removed, etc. But what happens after Mother 3, as said by Itoi, is the world we're living in now. Maybe Mother 4 will be created as a prequel to one of the Mother games so they won't completely rule out what Itoi has said!"
mother4,2v3k1m,-Pollyanna,2,Sat Feb 7 17:07:48 2015 UTC,"But what happens after Mother 3, as said by Itoi, is the world we're living in now.   From the looks of the trailer, Mother 4 looks incredibly similar to modern America. (or at least 70's to 90's America) so it would kind of make sense."
mother4,2v3k1m,Ultimate_Cabooser,3,Thu Feb 19 05:13:14 2015 UTC,"Did you move around after the ""THE END?"" screen? Because there's a bit more to it. It's ambiguous what the end is, but what I personally feel is the most likely interpretation is that the world was basically rebooted."
mother4,2v3k1m,hinchy,4,Sun Feb 8 00:50:01 2015 UTC,"Pastel confirmed the game takes place in 197X, so whether than means it's a prequel to the whole series, or even that it's a 197X AFTER Mother 3's world revitalization, who knows. Could be either or. Guess we'll just have to wait and see!"
mother4,2v3k1m,skyrunner14,3,Sat Feb 7 16:47:01 2015 UTC,Where did he say that? I haven't heard of this information until now.
mother4,2v3k1m,MrMcKonz,2,Sat Feb 7 17:04:52 2015 UTC,"Go check out my topic! He came on /v/ after somebody was threatening to leak some of their test materials.   I definitely think it's the new 1970s, after Mother 3."
mother4,2v3k1m,PunchyG,2,Sat Feb 7 17:40:32 2015 UTC,"Not sure how I feel about this. I hope they don't explicitly mention ""197X"" in the game, it's too much of a concrete tie to Earthbound when neither of the other games used that format. ""The 1970s"" or ""The late 20th Century"" sounds more appropriate, imo."
mother4,2v3k1m,dillonEh,1 point,Sun Feb 8 02:48:22 2015 UTC,"Earthbound seemed like its own little wacky world with some similar aspects of our world. Mother 4 looks a lot more ""modern"" so it would make sense if it took place in the 70's"
mother4,2v3k1m,Ultimate_Cabooser,1 point,Thu Feb 19 05:15:23 2015 UTC,"Each Mother game almost exists in its own universe. EarthBound takes place in ""199X"" in ""Eagleland"", Mother 1 takes place in 1980's ""Rural America"", and Mother 3's setting is an unknown number of years into the future. None of the games specifically reference each other's settings, and therefore a lot is left up to the imagination. I have no problem with the game taking place in the 1970's, but 197X makes it sound like it's taking place in EarthBound's 1970s."
mother4,2v3k1m,dillonEh,1 point,Fri Feb 20 07:42:08 2015 UTC,Where was this said?
mother4,2v3k1m,-Pollyanna,-1,Sat Feb 7 17:08:24 2015 UTC,"M3 is the first game, chronologically  The world restarts making the world we live in as well as the world m1 and 2 take place in"
mother4,2v3k1m,LC_Music,3,Sun Feb 8 06:16:55 2015 UTC,"this literally makes no sense. it definitely is M1->M2->M3. Porky takes everything from the past and puts it in the future, not the other way around"
mother4,2v3k1m,metalknuckles,3,Sun Feb 8 21:09:59 2015 UTC,"Porky states that he is jumping around and around all over time. In M3 terms, the events of M1 and 2 haven't happened yet. Porky shows up from a future that hasn't happened yet.  M3 takes place before money and before evil. There is no evil, greed, or anything like that until Porky brings it from the future. It's like a self-fulfilling prophecy.   The final battle happens, everything starts over, creating our (and M1 and 2's) world"
mother4,2v3k1m,LC_Music,1 point,Sun Feb 8 21:34:07 2015 UTC,No nothing happens after Mother 3. Everyone sits in Darkness. The super tall guy named Leader will tell you how everyone went to the island and basically the back story behind mother 3.
mother4,2v3k1m,metalknuckles,1 point,Mon Feb 9 07:33:40 2015 UTC,"I know all about Leder and the whole island story  However, it's obvious to me at least that it the world hits a reset. The world doesn't just stay dark forever. You saw the rebooted logo at the end right? Suggesting a new beginning of the world?"
mother4,2v3k1m,LC_Music,1 point,Mon Feb 9 07:43:11 2015 UTC,"Ehh sorry i had a bad day at work, came off a little too hostile :-0  But yeah that makes sense, logo was all wood instead of mixed with metal"
mother4,2v3k1m,metalknuckles,1 point,Mon Feb 9 07:45:00 2015 UTC,Exactly! I interpreted that as the world being reborn as fully natural like it was millions of years ago.
mother4,2v3k1m,LC_Music,1 point,Mon Feb 9 07:46:42 2015 UTC,It could be either the first or last game. Both are valid interpretations. No evidence suggests either side.
mother4,2v3k1m,sirhatsley,1 point,Sat Feb 14 06:36:37 2015 UTC,"I personally think the earth was restored by the dragon, and the people who lived there rebuilt civilization, thus creating the setting for Mother 4."
mother4,2v169k,Guiltteaman,7,Fri Feb 6 22:24:59 2015 UTC,I cant imagine Mother without it. It's like... I don't know... Dry water? It's impossible to imagine x_x
mother4,2v169k,V0ID115,5,Sat Feb 7 05:15:58 2015 UTC,maybe it'll be a secret Easter egg :D
mother4,2v169k,metalknuckles,1 point,Fri Feb 6 23:49:26 2015 UTC,I feel like they'll try to include it somehow because it WAS in every other game!
mother4,2v24lg,Grandpa-Mafia,5,Sat Feb 7 03:42:09 2015 UTC,"They haven't said exactly, but they did once say that there would be a Desperation thing, where a character who does a thing while their HP was scrolling down to die would actually do that thing better.  Like, attacks or heals would be more powerful.  So I'd imagine that it would be at least as slow as Earthbound, if not a bit slower."
mother4,2v24lg,Bluestorm83,1 point,Sat Feb 7 05:17:27 2015 UTC,This is actually a good question. It all depends on the gameplay feel they're trying to achieve.
mother4,2v24lg,MrMcKonz,1 point,Sat Feb 7 15:52:36 2015 UTC,"Watch the 2014 trailer, when Leo tries PK Beam alpha, his PP bar goes about double the speed as EarthBound's bar so itll most likely b that speed (unless they change it)  This means no spamming PK Love when you take mortal damage :("

Just a little girl wandering in her head, struggling with her father's image which is the only other character in the game (he's everywhere). Very Creepy."

mother4,2ussjk,Murdock25,2,Thu Feb 5 00:41:14 2015 UTC,"Cognitive Dissonance is very cool. It seems (for me) like the missing piece between Mother 1 and 2. But it's very confusing because sometimes you wander around the area without any clue of what you have to do... and sometimes you got to travel into Space with a limited quantity of fuel, and you don't know which planet to go nor which way (wow this message was pretty confusing in terms of grammar I guess, shame on me x)"
mother4,2ussjk,nowshowjj,3,Thu Feb 5 07:28:22 2015 UTC,Anyone played LISA ? It's pretty good and strange and pervy? very Earthbound-ish. I recommend it.
mother4,2ussjk,mobclutch,6,Thu Feb 5 02:16:55 2015 UTC,"Well hold on there. Yes, Lisa is very Earthboundy but I think we also add the disclaimer that it is also incredibly dark.   Edit: Just sat down to get some play time in and JESUS CHRIST WTF DID I JUST DO?"
mother4,2ussjk,iDontHavePantsOn,5,Thu Feb 5 02:52:30 2015 UTC,"I saw that Lisa is PC only, I'm not really a PC gamer, and could bear it when all the indie games I've been interested in seem to come out for 3DS / Wii U / PS3 additionally, is this a game that needs high specs to thrive? I have a couple year old laptop that can run PSX - N64 level emulation (huge slowdown on dolphin, unfo), do you think I could run it?

mother4,2ussjk,KayShyGuy,2,Thu Feb 5 20:12:59 2015 UTC,"Lisa is inspired by earthbound but I wouldn't exactly call it Earthbound-y, for one it doesn't have the air of innocence that Earthbound had behind it's jokes. Earthbound had the benefit that if something dark or unsettling happens, there's that playful kind of feeling about it.  Lisa is a game where you lose arms to save party members, can whore yourself out, and play russian roulette. Humor's not exactly on the same vein.  I'd like to play it but I really don't condone a lot of the scenes. Gross-out and unfiltered dark humor isn't my cup of tea."

mother4,2uo7c8,Scheidecker1,23,Tue Feb 3 20:22:16 2015 UTC,"It's harder in some situations. For instance, you can't simply spam Offense Up and have a clear run through the bosses, but you won't be required to grind like in Mother. So we'd say Earthbound?  EDIT: Only the leftmost live party member can run as it cancels the other members' decision turns. Basically, you can run on your turn, or you can have each character attack."

For instance, you can't simply spam Offense Up and have a clear run through the bosses, but you won't be required to grind like in Mother. So we'd say Earthbound?   add a ""black beanling"" enemy that's rare and gives tons of EXP and I will love you forever."
mother4,2uo7c8,JohnnyRussell,18,Wed Feb 4 05:11:16 2015 UTC,"Never mind I saw you already answered a question like mine. I have a better question. What will the tone of this game be like? Will it be silly like Earthbound? Or will it be strange, funy, and heartrending like Mother 3? Again thank you so much for making this game it makes my dreams come true."
mother4,2uo7c8,JohnnyRussell,24,Tue Feb 3 20:43:18 2015 UTC,"The tone is probably most similar to the feeling of Mother 1, though it isn't trying to emulate any one game in particular. I, personally, am always pushing for it to be 'sillier'."
mother4,2uo7c8,luckjes112,12,Tue Feb 3 21:11:06 2015 UTC,"Will there be any serious or sad moments? You gotta love those, Mother 3' story is my favourite haha."
mother4,2uo7c8,Lucas5655,2,Tue Feb 3 21:13:28 2015 UTC,"I know I'm late, but: I actually like Mother 1 a lot. The darker theme really sticks with me, (though it technically doesn't make sense: shouldn't the first game be whimsical, and then the game featuring a revenge be really dark?). While Mother 3 is my favorite (game of all time) due to it's sad scenes, plot twists and great look and feel, I still think that Earthbound Zero is a bit overlooked and deserves more praise. And I know the AMA is over, but I am really curious how the story will continue from Mother 3. I'm guessing it's either a prequel, or the events of M3 have become an obscure legend."
mother4,2uo7c8,Bankman220,2,Sat Mar 7 20:17:41 2015 UTC,"Mother is cool though. I really liked it. When I knew what I was supposed to do ,but then again I got rid of some hint guy and went at it blind."
mother4,2uo7c8,GravityUnown2,12,Sun Apr 12 14:35:24 2015 UTC,"Ah! The first time I've actually made an AMA on time, totally by coincidence!  Alright.  How much do you think the game offers in terms of content? Weapons, map size, story, etc.  And also- just wondering, have you played LISA? It's another RPG in the vein of Earthbound. Figured the Mother 4 team would enjoy it. If so, what are your thoughts?  Thanks for the hard work, I'm really looking forward to the game."
mother4,2uo7c8,GravityUnown2,17,Tue Feb 3 20:19:20 2015 UTC,"Great timing!  Each character has 8 straight ""upgrade"" weapons that add attack power on a sloping curve, but aside from that there are weapons that add certain effects to attacks, as well as weapons like slingshots that everybody can equip. As far as towns, Pleiades has around 5 or 6 depending on how you count certain places, though there is a major city that serves as the center for many events. In terms of length, it should be around that of Earthbound.  I haven't got to play it yet. I'll send this to the rest of the team!"
mother4,2uo7c8,hero_of_time101,12,Tue Feb 3 20:30:35 2015 UTC,Does Mother 4 have rhythm based combos like in Mother 3?
mother4,2uo7c8,GravityUnown2,24,Tue Feb 3 20:44:43 2015 UTC,"Definitely. You won't need them to beat the game, though."
mother4,2uo7c8,ParaNoxx,5,Tue Feb 3 21:01:48 2015 UTC,"That's awesome, I always loved pulling off bash combos in Mother 3. I'm willing to bet it took some time to sync that up to the music."
mother4,2uo7c8,Wukeywukey,7,Tue Feb 3 21:06:16 2015 UTC,i was never able to get those down when i played mother 3. i just gave up after a while :/
mother4,2uo7c8,Fizypop,14,Tue Feb 3 21:16:59 2015 UTC,Were you playing on an emulator?
mother4,2uo7c8,MrMcKonz,4,Tue Feb 3 21:19:12 2015 UTC,It's understandable if you were playing it as a rom on an emulator. Those tend to throw the timing out of sync.
mother4,2uo7c8,FelixVicis,2,Tue Feb 3 21:29:24 2015 UTC,Yep. You have to press the attack key a bit before the actual beat. It's tough at first but you're able to get used to it.
mother4,2uo7c8,GreatestDaneHD,5,Mon Feb 9 08:03:32 2015 UTC,"Based off code commit times, I'd say that one was one of the toughest features to implement. Dave might disagree, though."
mother4,2uo7c8,Six-Wing,12,Tue Feb 3 21:19:38 2015 UTC,"Will the game be more linear, like Mother 3, or more open, like Earthbound?"
mother4,2uo7c8,davidcelis,17,Tue Feb 3 21:01:03 2015 UTC,"Open, like earthbound. You can rush through, though, if you'd like."
mother4,2uo7c8,Six-Wing,13,Tue Feb 3 21:13:52 2015 UTC,Once enough time passes will beta elements and developer's notes be released? Also are we getting a beta of the prologue? To find glitches and stuff.  Also please let there be a rival character! Its what made Earthbound great because Porky was there to goad you till the end!  Thanks for answering if you do and can't wait to play the game!
mother4,2uo7c8,supercalu,13,Tue Feb 3 21:02:07 2015 UTC,"We hope to write a huge post-mortem for the indie dev community.   There won't be any sort of beta or demo, so you'll have to wait until release time to play!"
mother4,2uo7c8,Fred_Aki,2,Tue Feb 3 21:15:30 2015 UTC,"That would be fantastic. I love seeing what could have been, especially now that this is a completely fan driven game."
mother4,2uo7c8,Fred_Aki,10,Tue Feb 3 21:58:03 2015 UTC,"Thank you for taking time out to calm the reddit. I'm a software engineer myself and understand how a large scale project can become complicated really quickly.  How does the game feel so far, still in dev?"
mother4,2uo7c8,hero_of_time101,19,Tue Feb 3 20:40:54 2015 UTC,Dave and Boris certainly appreciate the sentiment.   I really like battle. Dave made it so the animation responds to the amount of damage done during battle. I believe its something like springiness = springmax * (damageDone / playerCharacter.maxHP).
mother4,2uo7c8,Justin3613,7,Tue Feb 3 20:59:03 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's actually really smart and it will definitely feel satisfying landing powerful hits as the player. Bravo Dave!"
mother4,2uo7c8,PunchyG,12,Wed Feb 4 03:01:03 2015 UTC,"I'm completely oblivious about any of the drama, but I am really curious if y'all have nailed down a release date. Also, is reddit the best place to check check for the latest updates?"
mother4,2uo7c8,powerje,12,Tue Feb 3 20:28:52 2015 UTC,"The absolute best place for confirmed updates is from official Mother 4 channels. Specifically, the website and our twitter.  We're really hoping to hit a June-ish date. We aren't positive, though. There's a few things we'd like to change."
mother4,2uo7c8,MrMcKonz,10,Tue Feb 3 20:32:50 2015 UTC,"While the June date you gave above makes me happy, I do feel like I need to be honest and say that the Twitter account and blog are disheartening... They both see very sporadic and rare activity... Do y'all plan to be more active on social media in the future? Even just periodic screenshots let fans know that the game is getting closer.  Thanks again for all the hard work making the game!"
mother4,2uo7c8,PunchyG,2,Tue Feb 3 20:57:45 2015 UTC,OMG I AM SO AMPED. Keep it up! Y'all are doing a fantastic job!!!
mother4,2uo7c8,PunchyG,11,Tue Feb 3 20:42:57 2015 UTC,Will there be any endgame content/exploration to Mother 4? Or will it simply finish once the credits roll?
mother4,2uo7c8,PunchyG,19,Tue Feb 3 21:04:09 2015 UTC,That would be a huge spoiler. You'll have to wait!
mother4,2uo7c8,Kyranosaurus,11,Tue Feb 3 21:20:12 2015 UTC,Are we cry until the end? :')
mother4,2uo7c8,altsuraki,19,Tue Feb 3 21:22:52 2015 UTC,Please don't cry till the end.
mother4,2uo7c8,TommyCX,10,Tue Feb 3 21:27:26 2015 UTC,Please don't cry till the end   Thanks a lot for do this.
mother4,2uo7c8,MrMcKonz,44,Tue Feb 3 21:33:06 2015 UTC,"Right now we're aiming for a June release.  This is a tentative date for us, and we haven't publicly announced it. We're still looking to see if we can hit that. There's a few things we want to work on."
mother4,2uo7c8,Hekset,22,Tue Feb 3 20:07:35 2015 UTC,"please take as long as you need to make of a fantastic game. were mother fans, so were pretty patient ;)"
mother4,2uo7c8,shadow85,6,Tue Feb 3 20:20:43 2015 UTC,Take all the time you need! :)
mother4,2uo7c8,altsuraki,3,Tue Feb 3 20:45:39 2015 UTC,I KNEW IT!
mother4,2uo7c8,Pik-projectm,3,Wed Feb 4 02:56:00 2015 UTC,<3
mother4,2uo7c8,MidgetRodeoClown,17,Tue Feb 3 20:22:09 2015 UTC,"Just want to say how amazing the project looks and what a terrific job you guys are doing over there. Good luck, I'm waiting eagerly to play your game in June, and I just want to remind you guys not to listen to all the negativity in the community right now.  GLHF"
mother4,2uo7c8,MidgetRodeoClown,19,Wed Feb 4 00:15:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the kind words, /u/tryingtoplaymonaco. That means a lot to us. I think when negativity exists its either warranted or simply because of lack of information. This time it's both. So if there are significant issues, I'm here to relay that back to the team so we can fix them."
mother4,2uo7c8,Overlevender,10,Tue Feb 3 20:28:41 2015 UTC,It mostly exists on YouTube. And that one guy on the forums....
mother4,2uo7c8,EstebanXx,9,Tue Feb 3 20:35:11 2015 UTC,So who's in charge of this project? Who's writing it and directing the team? Who do we blame for the delay?  Can I ask more than one question?
mother4,2uo7c8,Triforce_Saturn,18,Tue Feb 3 21:47:38 2015 UTC,"Great question.  Pastel is our creative director. He writes nearly all of it. We all help QA it.   You can blame us all for the delay, but particularly me for pushing for a redesign of the battle UI.  Yes."
mother4,2uo7c8,Shrinefox,7,Tue Feb 3 20:18:11 2015 UTC,:o Cool... What's Groovy all about?
mother4,2uo7c8,Triforce_Saturn,33,Tue Feb 3 20:24:00 2015 UTC,"Characters get a Groovy! bonus when the special meters around their name cards fills to the top - no matter when it fills up. The bonus allows a character to act immediately, even if it's in the middle of an enemy's turn, without checking their speed stat. It's a great way to rack up damage or keep your party going through hard battles, but it can be hard to pull off."
mother4,2uo7c8,Shrinefox,5,Tue Feb 3 20:30:20 2015 UTC,That's freaking awesome!!
mother4,2uo7c8,obamunistpig,7,Tue Feb 3 20:36:46 2015 UTC,It's a bit risky sounding but do you guys perhaps plan on showing Nintendo this game if it's received well? With some precautions of course but I'm pretty sure they're aware of this already aren't they? How do you think they'd react having you tell them it's completely fan dedicated and non-profit?
mother4,2uo7c8,Faulst,15,Tue Feb 3 20:54:50 2015 UTC,"We have no intention of this game ever being official. While it's likely that Nintendo knows about us, we've never heard from them in any sense."
mother4,2uo7c8,jasonp0860,5,Tue Feb 3 20:52:22 2015 UTC,Imagine if Mother 4 comes to Wii U and 3DS for free O.O well... or  cheap hahaha
mother4,2uo7c8,jasonp0860,6,Tue Feb 3 21:05:58 2015 UTC,Have you guys ever thought about creating your own original rpg?
mother4,2uo7c8,MrMcKonz,15,Tue Feb 3 21:22:31 2015 UTC,"Some of the team members have been throwing around new ideas, but the team currently will disband after the game is finished."
mother4,2uo7c8,IdrisSamatar,9,Tue Feb 3 20:40:40 2015 UTC,"That's sad. I would have loved to see a new original RPG hit the market. But hey, at least you guys have Mother 4 for your resume's right?"
mother4,2uo7c8,IdrisSamatar,4,Tue Feb 3 20:49:29 2015 UTC,It sucks to hear you guys will disband after... I atleast hope your game will inspire more people!
mother4,2uo7c8,Daj87,4,Tue Feb 3 21:53:54 2015 UTC,Part of me was hoping you guys would become a legit studio and keep producing mother type games.
mother4,2uo7c8,hero_of_time101,6,Wed Feb 4 00:10:58 2015 UTC,"Could you guys give us a ''Pic of the Day''... everyday?  hahahaha Thank you guys for all the hard work, can't wait to play it :D"
mother4,2uo7c8,TheKamenWriter,10,Wed Feb 4 01:17:21 2015 UTC,"We've discussed biweekly screenshots before, but we suck at updates"
mother4,2uo7c8,AutobotsEnsemble,13,Tue Feb 3 21:05:24 2015 UTC,He left the team early when the game began which was before the active development of the game (around 2 years ago.) He's since become great friends with Shane Mesa in LA.  He occasionally helps out with sprite work.
mother4,2uo7c8,Pik-projectm,10,Tue Feb 3 21:33:00 2015 UTC,"Transparency (without spoiling the surprises in game) is always a good thing.  Good on you guys for stepping up.  Might I ask what's causing the delay? Feature creep? Polishing? Fear of shipping? ""PK Shanetweet"" ability causing too much hype and deleted code?  In three to five words describe your favorite thing in the game."
mother4,2uo7c8,BanchoBowser-BaBo,29,Tue Feb 3 20:07:54 2015 UTC,"For a long time our biggest issue was communication. We started in an AIM chats, using Dropbox and having to search for files. From there we moved to Skype. It was really hard to coordinate back then, files were lost and we just didn't have everything and everybody together. Now, though, we've moved on to a service called Slack and moved away from Dropbox.  The other reasons are scattered. I'm relocating to San Francisco. Dave got a new job. A couple of us have gotten married. Several have started university.  We also encourage everyone to prioritize paid work... to pay for food.  Favorite thing? Making battle backgrounds."
mother4,2uo7c8,Koopakirby,10,Tue Feb 3 20:10:21 2015 UTC,"Sounds like pretty standard stuff for delays (and awesome stuff like the marriage). Glad to hear  it isn't  anything crazy.  The backgrounds I've seen are pretty awesome so far so good work on that.  If I could make a request would you mind showing us a cool background the public hasn't seen yet?  My tablet needs a new wallpaper, and your AMA has me in a Mother mood. Plus I'm sure everyone is dying for new teaser stuff."
mother4,2uo7c8,MilesTheWolfmanSDA,3,Tue Feb 3 20:36:50 2015 UTC,"I'm curious, what's the team using now for file management?"
mother4,2uo7c8,delectabit,4,Tue Feb 3 20:45:46 2015 UTC,hello :D What size will have the world?
mother4,2uo7c8,Pik-projectm,5,Tue Feb 3 21:02:34 2015 UTC,How's Ryan doing? (he's a good friend of mine)
mother4,2uo7c8,Shrinefox,12,Tue Feb 3 22:50:59 2015 UTC,You tell him that I'm tired of him posting obscure Facebook statuses.
mother4,2uo7c8,DigitalBlawks,8,Tue Feb 3 20:56:54 2015 UTC,HAHA WOW
mother4,2uo7c8,Faulst,6,Tue Feb 3 21:09:12 2015 UTC,"probably some kamen rider stuff. I take full blame, I got him into that mess"
mother4,2uo7c8,zimmertr,8,Tue Feb 3 21:16:37 2015 UTC,YES YOU DID and I love it thank you
mother4,2uo7c8,Twililord,7,Tue Feb 3 21:21:13 2015 UTC,"What efforts did you have to take to make sure the game is balanced difficulty-wise?  I imagine it must be difficult with a game that has so many variables (such as equipment, leveling up, PSI, etc..) to make sure players don't find some kind of broken combination (ex: PSI is less beneficial than just pounding the guy, etc...)  Are you sticking to relatively simple turn-based combat formulas, or are you doing anything adventurous (beyond the rhythm-based feature you've discussed)?  How do you determine how much ""grinding"" is the right amount?"
mother4,2uo7c8,Pik-projectm,3,Tue Feb 3 21:17:41 2015 UTC,"Traditionally, Mother games have a large soundtracks.  While the soundtrack given currently, is extremely well done, I was wondering if there were any other pieces of music that haven't been divulged to the public as of yet?"
mother4,2uo7c8,Minepow2,13,Tue Feb 3 21:31:18 2015 UTC,There is a lot of unreleased stuff. Shane's been working like crazy.
mother4,2uo7c8,Mordoksieznik,5,Tue Feb 3 21:39:04 2015 UTC,Will the trailer that you guys promised be upload soon? And what caused the team to delay the game? I'm eagerly waiting the games release. So please take your time.
mother4,2uo7c8,JohnnyRussell,13,Tue Feb 3 20:49:51 2015 UTC,"We've on our last three scenes, I believe. I pushed very hard to redesign the battle UI and that took quite some time. I think the new UI is significantly better in terms of functionality!"
mother4,2uo7c8,DJIzana,3,Tue Feb 3 21:06:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply, I can't wait for the game. But take your time. I would rather wait more and have an amazing game than have it rushed."
mother4,2uo7c8,rockinDS24,3,Tue Feb 3 20:51:18 2015 UTC,"So what I'm getting from this AMA, is that the delay for the trailer was because you needed new footage that featured the new UI? I could be completely wrong."
mother4,2uo7c8,shadow85,5,Tue Feb 3 21:12:17 2015 UTC,"Is the OST completed or is it still a work in progress? I've heard samples of it so far and I'm really liking the variety, especially the callbacks to Mother 1 and Earthbound."
mother4,2uo7c8,Swiftphantom,7,Tue Feb 3 21:27:37 2015 UTC,"It's not quite finished. There's a lot of tracks we've scrapped and rewritten, and Shane seems to be making more all the time."
mother4,2uo7c8,MotherMotherMother,2,Tue Feb 3 21:56:29 2015 UTC,"Well, it's good to know that improvements are always being made. I look forward to hearing the finished soundtrack!"
mother4,2uo7c8,Eiyeron,10,Tue Feb 3 21:02:00 2015 UTC,"Awesome topic :) I don't have a question per se (waiting to be pleasantly surprised in all aspects) but I would like to apologize.   Sorry for a post or two of mine from here which unnecessarily riled the base and upset a few members. Not cool on my part, at all. Was a bad coupla days, which I know isn't much of an excuse. I know you guys are working your butts off, and that some prejudiced, ill-conceived criticism from posts here are the last thing rockin' dudes need. Fans read a bit too much into things sometimes, dig? lol  Best of luck, god speed, and take all of the time you guys need. Even if we have to wait until 2016!"
mother4,2uo7c8,Lishy1,11,Tue Feb 3 21:14:39 2015 UTC,"Criticism is usually warranted. Just letting you know I read it, and eventually spurred this thread. You did a good thing."
mother4,2uo7c8,NoSuperGen,4,Tue Feb 3 21:17:08 2015 UTC,can we expect to find many easter eggs in the game?
mother4,2uo7c8,darkebolain,3,Tue Feb 3 21:03:27 2015 UTC,"Hello! Keep up the good work!  Now, two questions:  Will you be releasing the full OST? I'm loving the soundtrack.  And  When are you going to make the fanmade sequel to Shigesato Itoi's Bass fishing?"
mother4,2uo7c8,ChrisInLight,5,Tue Feb 3 21:24:21 2015 UTC,"As long time mother fans, and musical hobbyists, my band-mate and I  would love to know how Shane got so handsome."
mother4,2uo7c8,ChrisInLight,3,Tue Feb 3 21:44:02 2015 UTC,Are all these accounts just shills for Shane?
mother4,2uo7c8,Kyranosaurus,3,Tue Feb 3 21:59:13 2015 UTC,he's always been that way I guess  it's the california sun + sick tunes he creates
mother4,2uo7c8,bluebreeze52,3,Tue Feb 3 21:28:03 2015 UTC,Can this game be played with controllers via USB ports (i would love to use my GC controller adapter for this)  Also is there any way i can contact the pixel artist of this game to do a commision to make me one of those cool sprites for Mother4 ? (this is for a potential trailer/ profile pic for my youtube channel because i have been wanting to play this game and send the footage to youtube)
mother4,2uo7c8,Mitchborn,8,Tue Feb 3 21:32:32 2015 UTC,"You should be able to use any standard controller with it.  You may be able to contact some, but in general because the style is related to Mother 4 and we have a strict no financial transaction policy... that one is probably a no go. :("
mother4,2uo7c8,wolfanotaku,3,Tue Feb 3 21:31:14 2015 UTC,"MOTHER has a lot of famous enemy types that reoccur. Like hippies, Starmen, Octobots, Exploding Trees, and the like. Will any enemies that are ""sequels"" to enemies in earlier MOTHER games appear?"
mother4,2uo7c8,moparsith,8,Tue Feb 3 20:44:30 2015 UTC,"Well, Mr. Batty and those rambling mushrooms are back, for instance. There's also a few enemies you may recognize as distant relatives. That's all I can say. :)"
mother4,2uo7c8,ferricyanide,3,Tue Feb 3 21:08:38 2015 UTC,"Ok, so in reading a little of the answers, Zane, you mentioned that part of the delay was on you for changing up the Battle UI. As someone studying game development, can I ask why?   You're releasing this for free on a digital platform. I'm not quite sure if you have plans to iterate further after release, but it seems like something like that could have been saved for an update or a patch if you choose to go that route.  Please don't take this negatively, I adore the way the game looks, and I'm glad there's finally going to be some solid updates instead of the cryptic shit that's been getting around. I've been really looking forward to this, and I sincerely hope you meet your June deadline so all of us can play it and you can have this world off your shoulders."
mother4,2uo7c8,Garth_Haven,7,Tue Feb 3 20:43:46 2015 UTC,"Hey /u/MilestheWolfmanSDA  Very cool! My background is in UX. The old UI was pretty intrusive. We received a lot of feedback from fans. It took up a lot of screen real estate, didn't provide text labels, the active state could have had more visual affordance.  Overall, we tried to get it out of the way so the battle was the most prominent and added text labels so you never lose your place."
mother4,2uo7c8,udryx,3,Tue Feb 3 21:00:16 2015 UTC,Do the team members have a favorite Mother game??
mother4,2uo7c8,Pik-projectm,14,Tue Feb 3 20:46:15 2015 UTC,"MOTHER 1 is put together extremely well! With all of its grinding and general clunkiness, it may seem like hard game to get into - but when I get into the groove of playing it, I find it to be an extremely rewarding experience for many reasons.   MOTHER 3 is not my personal favorite, but I do find it to be the most objectively polished out of the three."
mother4,2uo7c8,Erotaku12493,11,Tue Feb 3 20:58:44 2015 UTC,You're going to start an internal fight. I personally like M3. Many love earthbound. Pik's is Mother 1.
mother4,2uo7c8,Pik-projectm,4,Tue Feb 3 20:52:22 2015 UTC,"Mother 3 drew me into the franchise but I've since grown to love 1 and 2. I can't pick one over the other without getting specific  1 has my favorite music, 2 has my favorite atmosphere and 3 I just really liked the characters and the visuals"
mother4,2uo7c8,Destro_,3,Tue Feb 3 21:17:33 2015 UTC,Question: You said there would gameplay back in December. Why has this changed? Can you give us some info on this?
mother4,2uo7c8,Mitchborn,6,Tue Feb 3 21:13:34 2015 UTC,"I pushed for a redesign of the battle UI. With that and a couple of other hiccups, we weren't ready in time. There's (I believe) three scenes left to record."
mother4,2uo7c8,IdrisSamatar,3,Wed Feb 4 16:01:26 2015 UTC,"I have seen many questions on here if there will be aspects from the other Mother games coming into Mother 4, and I have a question about this myself.  Will there be a band like DCMC or the Runaway Five included in Mother 4?"
mother4,2uo7c8,bottomquark_,7,Tue Feb 3 21:07:49 2015 UTC,"Hello Zane, I just wanted to thank you and the rest of the team from the bottom of my heart for making this project happen.  For my entire life I have been an Earthbound fan and I find myself almost in tears to see another iteration in this series.  I remember playing Earthbound on the SNES when I was a toddler. I would load up my sister's save file and walk around in the Cave of the Past getting my ass handed to me by the powerful monsters.   Then, after I got older, I had my sister's best friend's boyfriend bring me a Mother 3 GBA cartridge back when he toured in Okinawa for the military. I was so apprehensive to play it but there wasn't a translation patch available at the time. I ended up printing off a translation script I found on GameFaqs and translating on my own as I went through the game.  Sorry for the long winded story. I just really wanted to let you know how big of a part of my life this franchise has always been.  Thank you again for doing this. It means so much to me. I absolutely cannot wait for the release."
mother4,2uo7c8,MrMcKonz,3,Tue Feb 3 21:17:44 2015 UTC,"Thank you for that story, /u/zimmertr. The Mother community is really special, and your story is an example of that. Thanks."
mother4,2uo7c8,EightMelodies,2,Tue Feb 3 21:46:44 2015 UTC,How did you get into the Mother series?
mother4,2uo7c8,Mitchborn,7,Tue Feb 3 21:24:16 2015 UTC,"Oddly enough, an old fangame called Ness' Christmas Journey got my attention in the series."
mother4,2uo7c8,Sebastian1314,1 point,Tue Feb 3 21:36:31 2015 UTC,I remember that fangame!  Good times...
mother4,2uo7c8,Jopeja,2,Tue Feb 3 21:11:40 2015 UTC,Are there going to be any easter eggs related to official Mother games?
mother4,2uo7c8,Jopeja,2,Tue Feb 3 21:20:16 2015 UTC,How long will the game be? Like hours wise? I appreciate you answering everyone's questions :)
mother4,2uo7c8,Pik-projectm,5,Wed Feb 4 03:10:42 2015 UTC,Tough one. We think the length of Earthbound?
mother4,2uo7c8,Jopeja,2,Tue Feb 3 22:18:23 2015 UTC,How big is the world of Mother 4?
mother4,2uo7c8,Dextrorfan,6,Tue Feb 3 20:33:16 2015 UTC,"The exact size is hard to nail down. Our graphics style and screen resolution the towns wind up being pretty big, and then there are maps between towns. You'll have plenty of space to wander."
mother4,2uo7c8,Dextrorfan,2,Tue Feb 3 20:47:20 2015 UTC,Does anyone die this time around?

mother4,2uo7c8,psi_sig,2,Tue Feb 3 21:16:05 2015 UTC,Kudos on the incredible work! Some next level stuff your team is doing here!!  The character sprites and animations are really nice — will these be released under a license that allows their use in other projects?
mother4,2uo7c8,Pik-projectm,2,Wed Feb 4 01:29:44 2015 UTC,"Hi. I'm pretty impressed by the lifeload mass of work you could have done to make such a good job. As everyone there I'm waiting restlessly until it comes out.  Mother games always have been the silly example of a whole world which is RPG. I took a liking to them since a friend got me a copy of Mother 3+ En translation. It was the one of the two games that made me cry (the other was totally for an off topic reason).   My hobby is programming on graphical calculators. I'm a bit known in this ground as a moderator of the main French site 'bout Casio calcs and a moderator of a Ti brand new forum. I'm used to make ports of games (or at least engines) I like or love. That's how I made Bust-a-Move for Casio CG-10/20 and Super Hexagon for FX-9860. For months I'm relentelssy trying to figure how the hell I could do a Earthbound-Mother 3 like battle engine. This a too big project for me and I tried multiples times before miserably failing as much times. The furthest prototype had enough things to work without items nor PSI butnyiu could bash, SMAASH, and have a pretty decent menu UI (hello delicious text box) but the code was amazingly too messy to make up something with it. I'm still designing (or trying to) the structure of how it should be programmed, a task where I'm crazy bad at it, and couldn't have any progress nor help for anyone for months where a different point of view could have helped me a lot.  Your devotion and your work give me hope to continue this project as I have an game idea to use it. I'd like to achieve something at least bigger than everything I could have done before but this will take a big part of my time and I have so much ideas (and so few motivation to finish something I finished its engine or doing what I wanted to do in it), without counting the community's projects (hello, Unix-like kernel. Have a seat on a Casio FX-9860). Guys like you are a kind of spiritual mentors for me. I always took better people than as examples and trying to match them is a long and hard work.  As a game dev (or wannabe), I'd like to thank you to give me the hope I need to finish a project. As a player I'd like to thank you for giving us such a game. Thanks.  Oh, and here's my question : will you open the game content and give to the community the tools they could need to build a game from your game engine? That would be rad to see many people starting working on their vision of what is Mother game."

mother4,2uo7c8,Pik-projectm,2,Tue Feb 3 21:12:33 2015 UTC,"Alright if you're still answering questions, who made the music for Boom Town Lounge? I love it. Will you also have a hard CD copy of the soundtrack or any other merchandise relating to this game? OhI alsowould lovea 10 hour versionof the song ifyou can make one <3"
mother4,2uo7c8,bobguy243,2,Tue Feb 3 23:09:14 2015 UTC,"I've been really excited and following the project for a long time now. How difficult do you find it having to stick to somewhat of an ""Earthbound Formula"" with general design of the game in a day and age where most people don't have the patience to read dialogue or take part in turn based combat?"
mother4,2uo7c8,Vanstuke,3,Wed Feb 4 00:23:43 2015 UTC,"I think for the existing Mother community, its a no-brainer to make it feel as much like the Mother series as possible. Though, we have had similar discussions come up about new players. The dialogue is easy to understand and turns go by quickly. We hope new players will find it enjoyable as well."
mother4,2uo7c8,Yabba_Victor,1 point,Wed Feb 11 22:06:44 2015 UTC,"Hey! I've been eagerly awaiting this game and it looks amazing. Like, seriously amazing. The talent at display here is staggering. I have a question about the website. How'd you do the models for the characters? You know, the clay ones. Are they actual clay? They look amazing! Totally paid off. :D"
mother4,2uo7c8,Sebastian1314,5,Tue Feb 3 20:54:07 2015 UTC,Thank you!  They are actually clay. Macoatl made them for us and they're great!
mother4,2uo7c8,GabeZune,3,Tue Feb 3 21:23:34 2015 UTC,"I remembered thinking to myself when I first heard about the game ""Man, I hope they have some clay models for the characters"". And boom! Thanks for the response, have a great day eh?"
mother4,2uo7c8,Pik-projectm,1 point,Tue Feb 3 20:43:57 2015 UTC,Unlikely scenario but just curious: How would you feel if Nintendo approached you about this game and wanted to sell it on the Nintendo eShop plus make you guys official developers?
mother4,2uo7c8,kiyoo23,1 point,Tue Feb 3 21:03:11 2015 UTC,"I have been following this project closely for five years now, ever since hearing about it from ClanOfTheGrayWolf back in January 2010. Earthbound and Mother 3 hold a special place in my heart as some of my favorite games of all time, and I can't thank this team enough for carrying on Itoi's underrated legacy. The Mother games have a history of combing elements of oddball fantasy with sci-fi, which we can see in Mother 4's teaser. But exactly how odd can we expect this finished product to be compared to the others?"
mother4,2uo7c8,TokoWH,1 point,Tue Feb 3 21:06:43 2015 UTC,When will come out a new trailer or gameplay?
mother4,2uo7c8,Pik-projectm,1 point,Tue Feb 3 21:04:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering questions.  I'm really excited about the project, but since I heard about it I've been curious.  Have you figured out the legal angle of this yet? Any idea what will happen once you go to market? Is there a chance you'll get shut down?"
mother4,2uo7c8,rei-mu,2,Tue Feb 3 21:05:20 2015 UTC,"We honestly have no idea. We'll release the game and hope everyone enjoys it. There's always a chance things get cancelled, and that goes for anything."
mother4,2uo7c8,YMCKrey,1 point,Tue Feb 3 21:06:34 2015 UTC,What is the mood and overall feeling of the game?

mother4,2uo7c8,SpadesMagnes,1 point,Tue Feb 3 21:25:57 2015 UTC,"Hey, dude. Thanks for taking the time! I'm sure everyone would really appreciate even just a quick comment on the Mother 4 site bimonthly - even if you can't do an AMA every month. Simple like, ""Hey guys, the video is delayed due to a change in the battle UI.""  Speaking of the new UI, could you please show the old UI and maybe a comparative shot of the new UI? Why have you decided this needed an upscale?   I'm also curious about music in Mother 4. Music has been one of the most prevailing memories in the Mother series for me. On the gilded tails of the Runaway Five and DCMC, will there be a new band appearing in Mother 4?   Tonda Gossa!"
mother4,2uo7c8,Gorlokk,1 point,Tue Feb 3 21:14:35 2015 UTC,"Besides spreading the word, is there anything you all need/want help by fans? I imagine I'm not the only one willing to donate time and energy to the game, even if it helps in only small ways."
mother4,2uo7c8,Starmen_91,2,Tue Feb 3 21:14:58 2015 UTC,"No donations are necessary. Thank you for putting up with us, and we hope you enjoy the game when its released."
mother4,2uo7c8,Fred_Aki,1 point,Tue Feb 3 21:16:54 2015 UTC,"Since the series is full of pop culture references, were there any bands or movies or TV shows that you feel influenced any part of your creation? (Maybe subconsciously?)"
mother4,2uo7c8,Ness6464,2,Tue Feb 3 21:19:43 2015 UTC,"Whatever influence pop culture has on us, it isn't in the forefront of our design process. We do have certain periods in mind when we design things - which may naturally reflect certain cultures - but in most cases, that reflection is merely a side-effect of whatever goals we have in mind at the time."
mother4,2uo7c8,incantation_spewer,1 point,Tue Feb 3 21:30:52 2015 UTC,"Is there any possibility the game will be made for any platform outside of PC? For example, my ideal situaton is being able to throw the game on a gba or DS flashcart, or run it through my phone. Not having a functional computer is a huge setback for me"
mother4,2uo7c8,PunchyG,2,Tue Feb 3 21:19:44 2015 UTC,"The game would have to be reformatted to fit within the limitations of whatever system we would port it to, and we don't have time to invest that much energy into an effort like that.  We're just focused on getting the game finished for PC users. (and by association, Mac and Linux users)  However, if you do happen to get your hands on a PC (no matter how basic) I'm pretty sure a toaster could run it."
mother4,2uo7c8,XJohnson12,2,Tue Feb 3 21:38:59 2015 UTC,"This is our most frequently asked question. Someone might one day do something so its available on another system, but due to time and resources we can only work on PC for now.   I understand the lack of functional computer. I have been missing one for a few months and only now got a replacement.  Hope it works itself out for you!"
mother4,2uo7c8,killer4u77,1 point,Tue Feb 3 21:20:24 2015 UTC,"What's the issue with the new trailer? First we heard that you guys were having uploading problems, and then later heard that there wasn't enough footage to finish making the trailer. Are you guys going to put out a trailer any time soon, if at all? And if yes, is it going to be another trailer like the first one was or is it going to be more of a gameplay trailer?"
mother4,2uo7c8,Vabawoo,4,Tue Feb 3 21:30:07 2015 UTC,"We did have series formatting problems, but later I had actively pushed for a redesign of the battle UI that took a huge chunk of time from us.  I'm not sure when we're releasing, but we actively work on it each day.  The trailer shows different game play elements, but its not one long continuous cut like showing the prologue, for instance."

mother4,2uo7c8,hittes,1 point,Tue Feb 3 21:21:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering my earlier question. Is the plot/storyboard/writing finished off? As in, do you guys totally and completely know how the story is gonna go at this point, or are you still working on it?"
mother4,2uo7c8,ArmoredChocobo,1 point,Tue Feb 3 21:28:58 2015 UTC,"Will there be an iconic tune for the story, like Mother/Earthbound's 8 Melodies or Mother 3's Theme of Love?"
mother4,2uo7c8,Vibracio,5,Tue Feb 3 21:27:02 2015 UTC,Absolutely. It wouldn't be a Mother game without it.
mother4,2uo7c8,Swiftphantom,5,Tue Feb 3 21:27:12 2015 UTC,Will we know it when we hear it?   Like...we're just strolling along and it starts playing during a cutscene and we're like THAT'S IT.
mother4,2uo7c8,MonopolyRubix,1 point,Tue Feb 3 21:30:02 2015 UTC,I just want to say you are all amazing and I have been following this project since the beginning. Thank you for your work! <3  Can I ask if the ending of Mother 4 will make me cry like the other games? :3
mother4,2uo7c8,Fapdragoon,1 point,Tue Feb 3 21:31:45 2015 UTC,"Hey! I've been tracking with the team for a long time, and I was wondering if the lack of blog posts was a reflection of progress made, or simply a decision. I.e, were the times where you were making blog posts more productive and indicative of an active team? Or simply a side thought in general?  Thanks! Keep up the good work, dude."

mother4,2uq70k,Boxyboy,6,Wed Feb 4 05:42:03 2015 UTC,"This is excellent, but /r/Mother4 prefers to stay focused on the fangame. I would recommend posting this to /r/Earthbound instead."
mother4,2upkrg,XJohnson12,7,Wed Feb 4 02:23:59 2015 UTC,"I think it's a little too in your face. I'd have to use it to really get a feel for it, but I personally prefer a cleaner look. I think they should take the icons they made and formatted it more like Mother 3. It had cleanest and most functional design IMO."
mother4,2upkrg,Animegame97,4,Wed Feb 4 02:46:35 2015 UTC,Well he just released those pictures so they must be close to the final design. And didn't OP say he was looking for criticism anyway?
mother4,2upkrg,Animegame97,4,Wed Feb 4 10:22:49 2015 UTC,I think it looks really good. What do you think those strange marks are above Floyd's HP card kajigger? Status infliction?
mother4,2upkrg,Ness6464,6,Wed Feb 4 14:34:25 2015 UTC,But if you look closely those marks are around the mouse too and Meryl's bar thing is full.  Zane said that when the bar fills up a character instantly attacks regardless of whether it's in the middle of and enemy's attack or not. Maybe Meryl is interrupting Floyd and the mouse's altercation with an attack.

mother4,2upkrg,famguy123,2,Wed Feb 4 03:02:13 2015 UTC,I do like it. It's just a bit different is all. So was the transition from the Mother 2 to Mother 3 Battle UI. But we all loved it. :D
mother4,2upkrg,skyrunner14,2,Wed Feb 4 07:07:20 2015 UTC,"I personally like the UI. It's clean, simple, and unobtrusive, which is what they were apparently going for anyway. So top notch! It's pretty groovy."

mother4,2utues,TrokStop,3,Thu Feb 5 03:42:56 2015 UTC,Good. I don't want Mother 4 to rely on connections with 1-3. I'm glad they're blazing their own trail.

mother4,2upab5,dudebro117,5,Wed Feb 4 02:15:17 2015 UTC,"How canon is Mother 4 to me?  1000x as canon as Mass Effect 3 was to that series.  HOOOONK!  But seriously, it's more about the quality than anything else, to me.  At the moment, I consider this game to be an expertly made fangame and love-letter to the Mother Franchise.  Maybe as a Chrysalis that could mature into Mother 4.  If I play through it and it's incredible, to me it will BECOME the true Mother 4.  And if they ever make a ""real"" Mother 4, I will forever think of this game as, like, Stepmother 4.  Edited only to add that chrysalis line.  Edited again because I'm stupid and misspelled Canon.  Not bad for my first ever Reddit post."
mother4,2upab5,Bluestorm83,3,Wed Feb 4 13:55:17 2015 UTC,"Stepmother 4   Haha I love it, that may be one of the best ways to describe its canon-ness"
mother4,2upab5,carpark72,1 point,Wed Feb 4 15:03:45 2015 UTC,Now I kind of wish Stepmother was the title :O

mother4,2upab5,Sebastian1314,1 point,Wed Feb 4 23:38:50 2015 UTC,Just the fact that the project still exists is hype-inducing enough for me. But I get what you mean.
mother4,2upab5,Animegame97,5,Thu Feb 5 03:43:58 2015 UTC,"Well it obviously can't be canon, but its the next best thing! I'm extremely hyped for this game and will be dropping everything to play it once it comes out!"
mother4,2upab5,StairFacts,5,Wed Feb 4 02:38:26 2015 UTC,"It's canon until Nintendo makes a new Mother game... Which will never happen anyways, so yeah, it's canon pretty much forever."
mother4,2upab5,ArmoredChocobo,2,Thu Feb 5 08:00:25 2015 UTC,"If the plot is similar to what I think, it's my head-canon of the events between Earthbound and Mother 3."
mother4,2upab5,-Pollyanna,2,Wed Feb 4 05:07:10 2015 UTC,"I am absolutely taking it as another Mother game! I can't wait for it! This game seems like it's not just going to be a great addition to the series, but also a great game by itself. Right now, it's looking like this game might surpass all the other Mother games if everything is done right! Everything in it, from the characters, to the enemies, to the locations really seem like they celebrate all the whole Mother series and I hope Itoi finds this game and gives it the praise it deserves!"
mother4,2upab5,ninjapenguin120,2,Fri Feb 6 05:15:01 2015 UTC,"I get that it's fan made, but I still to an extent call it a continuation. We're just picking up where Nintendo refused to do so. Like two different companies working on different games in the same series."
mother4,2upab5,Ghostmasks,1 point,Fri Feb 6 19:32:00 2015 UTC,This is how I view it as well! It's not uncommon for stories to be continued by different people. And to be continued by people who have everlasting love for the character and spirit of the source material? Even better.  Thinking of the attention Mother 4 will get (and what it will cause) is exciting.
mother4,2upab5,MonitoMR,2,Sun Feb 8 22:39:15 2015 UTC,"Considering the fact that Itoi himself stated that he was making no more sequels, I'm a little in limbo here. If it's Mothery-ness feels true, then yes, it's canon (to me, at least). Also, if Itoi states that this feels like a Mother sequel, I'm sold."
mother4,2upab5,PKtheworldisaplace,5,Fri Mar 27 01:02:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd have to play it first to make a real judgement. But for right now I'm definitely not seeing it be canon. I was really excited for this when I first saw the beautiful trailer and music but as time goes on I'm beginning to worry. I'm assuming the team is having some serious problems by the lack of any updates. Still hoping for the best though."
mother4,2upab5,Bluestorm83,2,Wed Feb 4 01:16:02 2015 UTC,Serious problems AND trying to get it as good as possible. They're not rushing it which I think is a good sign.

mother4,2ujpha,Gaius_Scaevola,2,Tue Feb 3 05:16:49 2015 UTC,Mother 4 has been in development for 7+ years.  Your point?
mother4,2ujpha,derekrrose,1 point,Tue Feb 3 22:46:52 2015 UTC,Eagleland looks great. I'm not bashing it. I was just pointing out that OP was wrong for comparing the two like that. And Mother 4 has basically been in development for 5 years since the first two years of work were totally scrapped. All is well. It's okay. No problems here.
mother4,2ujpha,TacoMcD,7,Wed Feb 4 01:18:49 2015 UTC,"The mods of starmen.net =/= the mother 4 dev team, or the mods of this subreddit, and it's highly unlikely any of the starmen mods check this sub. Not trying to argue for/against the validity of your complaints, but you should know that if you want the thread reopened you're looking in the wrong place. There's also an official twitter, facebook, and email linked to on the mother 4 site that could be used to reach the devs. It's not like the starmen thread was the only physically possible means of contacting them."

This wasn't a kneejerk reaction from me, the topic was teetering on the edge of being closed for a while. I was just the first to get fully fed up with it.

They don't have to be professional, they legally cannot even make a cent off of this game, so it shouldn't matter if they're missing deadlines or not updating anything. They're doing this because they want to, not because they're obligated to. Mind you they've redone a lot of their work several times because they've wanted to up the quality of the whole game.

It's hard to make all of the anticipated changed, locate all bugs and patch all bugs within a month.  I'm not trying to flame you. I'm not trying to undermine your intelligence. It's just that there are more circumstances to consider than you think.  Also, keep in mind that the team is entirely made up of volunteers. Every team member has a real, full-time job.

It isn't just 2D games, it is also 3D games that have that time frame for some too. Rome wasn't built in a day.  I am 100% sure that the developers aren't dicks and would just tease us and not give anything.   All we can really do is be patient..."
mother4,2ucv9w,blacknekos,-11,Sun Feb 1 00:40:50 2015 UTC,"You're trusting devs with nothing backing them. Being patient for a product that may never come is, quite frankly, a terrible answer. The devs aren't transparent at all: we have no idea what they're doing, if anything. I also dont understand how you manage to compare triple A games to an indie title, on top of comparing making a 2D game and a 3D game. Not only do most triple A games rarely reach the three year mark, they're also working with the third dimension. It's like comparing a piece of paper to a ball.  Is there a reason to trust them so blindly?"
mother4,2ucv9w,nowshowjj,6,Sun Feb 1 00:48:07 2015 UTC,What does it matter to you? It's not like anyone is paying or has paid for the game. It'll come out when it comes out. Why the hostility?
mother4,2ucv9w,Gavinza,-7,Sun Feb 1 00:59:53 2015 UTC,"So because I'm not trusting devs who have given us nothing but their word, when their word has no merit or history because it, I'm being ""hostile""?"
mother4,2ucv9w,Smithrope,2,Sun Feb 1 01:06:30 2015 UTC,There is already a trailer out for the game and it has been for a while. We are just waiting for the second one.
mother4,2ucv9w,iogj,-5,Sun Feb 1 01:56:27 2015 UTC,"August of 2013 was the last trailer, from what I understand. Has there really been so little content made for the game that we dont have a second trailer a year later? Let alone the game itself?"
mother4,2ucv9w,Smithrope,1 point,Sun Feb 1 02:24:46 2015 UTC,"Maybe they're concerned with making the game and not making stuff to hype the game up. When it comes out, play it or don't, but until then, just wait for the game like everyone else, ungrateful cunt."
mother4,2ucv9w,iogj,0,Sun Feb 1 03:06:45 2015 UTC,ungrateful cunt.   Wow what a fucking asshole you are. Someone asking for some information on a fangame doesn't deserve this kind of vitriol you pompous faggot.
mother4,2ucv9w,Smithrope,-1,Sun Feb 1 04:22:08 2015 UTC,"By expecting so much to given to him immediately from a fangame, he is ungrateful"
mother4,2ucv9w,nowshowjj,1 point,Sun Feb 1 04:25:32 2015 UTC,"Its not ""immediately"". Its actually way fucking past due. They promised info and a trailer TWO months ago. I know this game is free but all the bullshit the devs have been spinning is downright disrespectful."
mother4,2ucv9w,shiny_magikarp,-2,Sun Feb 1 04:51:28 2015 UTC,"You automatically go to insults when someone disagrees with you? You follow the devs of this game without ever asking any questions, such as 'how do i know theyre still making this' or 'why havent they said anything' or, most importantly, 'who are these people'? It's got nothing to do with hype, it's got everything to do with they havent said ANYTHING. Would you trust someone with something, so long as they say 'oh its free' or 'oh we really like this kinda stuff'? Even years later, you would still trust them? Ten minutes is all I want from the devs in a week. Out of 10080 minutes, I ask for 10. 10 minutes to simply inform people that ""Hello, yes, we are still working on the game."" But we get nothing. We get no information, no transparancy, nothing. Do you know these people personally? I mean, certainly, it's nowhere near as much of a bad thing as lending someone money and then they run off. The Mother 4 devteam has no leverage over me, or anyone else personally. It's entirely free, no one is wrong about that. But why do you believe that I am an 'ungrateful cunt' because I don't want information? Would you eat free food if you had no idea where it came from, who made it, if it was clean, and tons of other information? The same applies here."
mother4,2ucv9w,shiny_magikarp,1 point,Sun Feb 1 03:27:51 2015 UTC,No. I went to an insult when you appeared to be an ungrateful cunt. I will not read past the first sentence.
mother4,2ucv9w,blacknekos,-2,Sun Feb 1 03:29:27 2015 UTC,"So you do not even know if you disagree with my points or not? I simply question what you believe in, and I am immediately an awful person? I hate to inform you, but that's an extremely awful mindset. Have you had the same opinions about things since you were born, since you do not want to even think about listening to anothers words that dont follow the same beliefs as yours?  Edit: Oh, excuse me, I mean if you dont know if they follow the same beliefs as yours or not."
mother4,2ucv9w,blacknekos,1 point,Sun Feb 1 03:35:39 2015 UTC,I don't think anyone is asking you to trust anyone. I want this game to be good but there's a possibility that it could be terrible. I don't blindly trust the devs but I'm just trying to be optimistic and hope for the best. That all any if us can do.
mother4,2ucv9w,Wark_Kweh,-3,Sun Feb 1 02:09:02 2015 UTC,"But thats not all any of us should do. It takes literal minutes to type up a few sentences, maybe even take a screenshot or two, slam that onto your site and twitter. Theres literally no reason for them not to. Starbound has had nightly updates, and a post accompanying a good chunk of them since the game intially released on Steam, and those are sometimes a 'hey were still alive' or 'hey check out this new wiring system (SCREENSHOT HERE OF WIRES EVERYWHERE)'. Can you really say 'oh well theyre getting paid and the mother 4 team isnt, so they dont HAVE to update'?"
mother4,2ucv9w,XJohnson12,2,Sun Feb 1 02:27:46 2015 UTC,Is there a reason not to trust them? Theyre giving fans at LEAST FOUR YEARS of their life for free.  Worst case scenario: No game. Sorry. Maybe then someone else could pick it up and continue with it.
mother4,2ucv9w,Wark_Kweh,-1,Sun Feb 1 03:26:17 2015 UTC,"You are entirely right: no one has anything to lose from this except the people on the devteam. I lose nothing, you lose nothing, many people lose nothing. The worst that will happen is disappointment. However, personally, I love the Mother series. I'd love to see more content in the same vein as it, thats why I'm considering Citizens of Earth, even if its artstyle is godawful. And to me, it wouldn't be a horrible thing to be disappointed by a game I paid for, let alone one that was free! However, a lot of people feel otherwise. A lot of people are looking forward to this game extremely, and I finally decided to reach out and ask 'why'? That's basically what the topic comes down to, I believe."
mother4,2ucv9w,XJohnson12,1 point,Sun Feb 1 03:32:59 2015 UTC,"Alright. I understand that much. I know I'm pretty excited about it, and I haven't even played much of the Mother Series, save Earthbound. So I just think that I trust these guys because from what they've shown us already, they /love/ the Mother Series. A lot. And that means that if theyve come this far into it, they won't just quit now."
mother4,2ucv9w,Wark_Kweh,2,Sun Feb 1 03:39:01 2015 UTC,"It seems like you don't trust them at all, so why do you even bother to follow the game. I mean, you are acting like the followers of Fez. Let's not forget that they are making the game for free. A lot of the devs also have work. If you feel that you can't trust them, then I ask you to make a game of this calibre and see what happens."
mother4,2ucv9w,PunchyG,-3,Sun Feb 1 17:50:12 2015 UTC,"I bother following the game because I enjoy the Mother series. All I want is slight transparency here, and if not I want to know the reason as to why not. Saying 'oh you dont like it? make your own game' is also terrible logic because following that logic, reviewers and critics shouldn't exist. People should just 'make their own game' if they dislike it, right? It's faulty logic. And I understand fully that again, this is free, and again this is not their main priority in life. It's something they do on the side on top of their lives where they have jobs that actually give them money. Does that give them a reason to not put aside ten minutes of their time in a week, when a week has over ten thousand minutes? Can they not show us anything? This is a fan driven project, and if they want other fans to play their game, they actually have to connect with the community. So far, this community has worse interaction with the devs then with most major video game companies such as Riot Games or Valve."
mother4,2ucv9w,XJohnson12,1 point,Sun Feb 1 18:09:09 2015 UTC,"No, I am saying make a game to understand how long it takes to make games from scratch. So, you expect the Mother 4 team to say that they are actually working on the game, while companies like Valve and Half Life 3 or the Last Guardian by whoever. Or Fez... again..."
mother4,2ucv9w,PunchyG,-4,Sun Feb 1 19:18:08 2015 UTC,"Again, you are completely ignoring what I am saying. What I am saying is the devs have no reason not to be transparent. The Last Guardian in fact can be compared to Mother 4 in multiple ways! Such as the fact that we dont know if its in dev hell, the we get content for it on a yearly basis, and all we have is the devs word is that 'its still in the works'. We're completely in the dark for both of those games, and The Last Guardian actually has a reason. It could be under NDA, it could be vastly reworked as it is not a fanmade project made to emulate another game but its own game, etc etc.  Also, Fez is made by a completely terrible person. I've stopped listening to whatever that guy says, as he's clearly a child in a mans body who also knows how to code (somehow)."
mother4,2ucv9w,XJohnson12,4,Sun Feb 1 20:07:50 2015 UTC,"The answers are numerous and simple.    The people making this game don't owe anybody anything.   We aren't paying for this game. We have no investment in this game other than an emotional one. The developers have no obligation to a pre-existing or future customer base because the game will be free.    It takes a long time to build a game.    I'm guessing you aren't familiar with the production process that goes into creating a game since you seem to have issue with the 4-year development time. Ignoring the extra time it takes to build an engine to run your game in you need to create assets (graphics, animations, sound effects, music, code, dialogue, etc.) to put in the engine. You need to craft a story and edit it and rework it and re-edit it. You need to conceptualize, draft, implement, and test game mechanics. In an RPG you need to analyze in-game statistics and cross check them with your existing mechanics to make sure game progression operates smoothly. You need to dump all of this into the engine and then locate and squash as many bugs as you can find. Often you need to go back and rework stuff again. In summation, this stuff takes serious man-hours. Factor in the needs that these people need to meet for themselves and their families and they may only be able to commit a few hours a week to the game (in contrast to the 40+ that a single career developer can devote). For a handful of developers doing this in their free time, 4 years as pretty reasonable.    They may feel the need to keep a low profile.    Despite the game being developed and distributed for free, they are working with a copyrighted franchise. In an effort to avoid a mess (as simple as changing the title even) it's probably easier to just lay low.    They have been releasing bits and pieces of the game.    We have music. We have screen shots. We have a pretty good idea of gameplay by sheer virtue of it being another Mother game. We know it is stylistically similar to Mother3. We know the names and personalities of the heroes. And all of this despite the devs having no obligation whatsoever to release any of it.     Does that love for this series mean that the game will even be close to as good as we believe it is? Will the game even come out?   Maybe not on both counts. What little we have seen and heard so far is quite promising, so if it's relased and if it stays fairly true to what we have been shown so far then it is more than likely going to be a good homage to the series. No way to know unless it is released, even if they bombarded us with daily teases.   In any case, ""it'll be done when it's done"" is a perfectly good answer to any clamorings for more information. And a constant flow of information does not a good game make. Look at Star Citizen or Starbound. Star Citizen has made inumerable promises and claims and has little to show for it other than 70 million dollars, a passable flight simulation module, and a number of ship models that buyers can walk around and look at. Starbound, while being a pretty fun game, has seen little in the development department until recently despite having a pretty visible roadmap. A large portion of animosity towards Chucklefish comes from the fact that they had a level of transparency they weren't prepared to deliver on.   Mother 4 may or may not ever be released and it may or may not be a good game. But you aren't entitled to any of it in any case so sit back, chillax, and do something productive with your time."
mother4,2ucv9w,MoxZero,-1,Mon Feb 2 17:35:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think you freaking get it.  The team is downright ******* disrespectful to us. They have constantly failed to keep their promises, ignore us and have blatantly lied to us. Nobody is saying ""Give me the game NOW!!!"" We want to know what the hell is going on."
mother4,2ucv9w,Maleficus187,4,Mon Feb 2 23:00:23 2015 UTC,"Woah there, comrade.  What ""promises"" have been broken?  What ""lies"" have been told?  And even if we assume they are disrespectful, what makes you think they are obligated to respect anybody?  This is a hobby work. They dont owe you or me squat.   What has you all up in a tizzy anyway? You have a personal stake in the completion of this game?"
mother4,2ucv9w,Maleficus187,0,Tue Feb 3 01:18:13 2015 UTC,"They claimed to release a stable release date months ago. That has come and gone with no explanation.  We were supposed to have a trailer since new years. When we didn't get it Pastel said ""Processing issues"" but later we found out that there was no ""Worthwhile footage"" for the trailer in the first place. You cannot experience processing issues with a trailer that doesn't exist. That's a blatant lie.  It's disrespectful to straight up lie to people and constantly break promises then refuse to explain why and constantly ignore the issue. What do you mean ""what makes you think they are obligated to respect anybody""? They're doing this as a labor of love and they want people to play it right? If you're targeting a certain audience you need to respect them. They have stated that they're using Mother 4 as something for other development teams they may join in the future to look at and unless they want a cataclysmic shitstorm on their record their goal would be to respect the people who's opinions will effect their future careers.  I'm in a tizzy? Everyone is pissed. People are tired of being ignored and lied to by the devs and treated like shit by Starmen.net mods who patronize them for asking simple questions. This isn't looking good for anyone at all"
mother4,2ucv9w,SuperGiraloz,4,Tue Feb 3 02:17:38 2015 UTC,"I think you are missing the point. They aren't obligated to do anything at all.   They don't need to make a trailer. You don't need a trailer. They don't owe anybody anything. You are entitled to nothing. They could drop the project today and never pick it up again and that would be their perogative.   You have zero control over any aspect of this project. If it gets finished and released, great. If not, well that's too bad but it's not any bigger an issue that you deciding not to mail me a doughnut."

Maybe that's why there's a delay in the video! But no. It was only the video. That's what he said and that's the message most people got.   He was saying that the game isn't coming out yet, because people were suggesting that. By video material, he's saying ""the delay is only for a video."" It's weirdly worded and dumb, but he's not saying ""we don't have footage.""  He wasn't saying the video was uploading and processing, or not having videos.

mother4,2ttwrs,Demoneyez,27,Tue Jan 27 11:14:42 2015 UTC,"The thread was nice, but in all honesty it was probably about time for a new one anyways. There's really nothing left to discuss until new information is revealed, as what material we do have to ponder has been analyzed to death or simply doesn't have enough depth to warrant much critical discussion.   I do agree that the mods are no better than the ""offending"" users...chastising them for asking simple (oftentimes hard pressed and necessary) questions. Even if sometimes, said was done quite belligerently.   Like why the development team is so mum, or how they have failed (time and time) again to live up to self set deadlines or promises to the fan base. If there is an issue, just tell us. Don't hide in the shadows for weeks at a time and then come out with some bull about processing issues.  Just because they are an ""indie"" development team doing this out of the ""goodness"" of their hearts doesn't excuse them from dangling carrots in front of fans and then eating it themselves. Sounds to me like they are being lazy and self serving, really, and extraordinarily unprofessional. Which, sadly, doesn't bode well for the proposed quality of the title. Neither does the fact that this project has switched heads...what, four, five times already? It all comes across as very disjointed and certainly not at all promising.  Their ""technical processing issues"" for the video are a crock of malarkey. I mean, why even tell us about a supposed upcoming video when it can't be made clear when or if it will be released? First it was ""by or around New Years"". That came and went. Then they were having ""technical issues"" with uploading. (Which, for anyone who has ever uploaded a video to Youtube will know, usually doesn't persist for longer than say, a day or two. Uploading a video, especially a short, at max ten min trailer, takes what...no more than thirty minutes on even the worst of computers?)   Shanemesa and such then continuously tease and berate fans via twitter concerning said video and its ""issues"", refusing to acknowledge their shortcomings or explain to disappointed fans why or what exactly is stalling their progress. Clues, oh, the stupid little hints and clues. Which have led to....wait for it!...nothing at all.   ...THEN it turns out...that, hey! According to Pastel, project manager/head honcho, they haven't even compiled enough ""worthwhile footage"" FOR the video in question. Which means it was never finished in the first place, or perhaps even started. Certainly never uploaded. Can't upload a video that doesn't exist/isn't finished! Which means there never were ""processing issues"" to begin with...   (Edit - and really, how the heck does the friggin' DEV TEAM not ""have enough footage"" of their own game? Aren't they the ones who, I dunno, have all access passes to every location, line of script, and musical track present in the game?)   People stayed up late for that video. They lost sleep over it. Fans questioned such on here and the SM.NET topic only to be met with ridicule and abuse, when they are questions that NEED to be asked. If it was never in a state of completion or enough footage hadn't been compiled to even make the video, they never should have told us about it in the first place.  It's pretty terrible that they can't live up to their promises or deadlines, and only acknowledge such weeks after the shit storm passes. ""oh but wait"" says the aforementioned SM.NET moderators, ""they dun own you nuffin they are spending good free tim of theirs on this"". Don't owe us anything? After promising and delaying, denying and hiding? Sure, they don't owe us their time, or good will. But they do owe us proper explanations when said expectations reach a fever pitch and then are subsequently dashed, ignored, or forgotten. This isn't the game of the century, guys. Man up and tell fans what the hell is going on.   The straight up lying to fans? Inexcusable.   All I can say is...it better be a HELLUVA good teaser for rejected fans to even fathom pardoning this sort of behavior."
mother4,2ttwrs,Daj87,9,Tue Jan 27 16:24:51 2015 UTC,"You honestly summed this up pretty well. Nobody deserves to be belittled for asking questions that have to do with the release date of the video or game or why it's taking so long. Like you said, people lost sleep over waiting for the video a few weeks ago. I lost sleep. These fans, us, are excited for this game. We know that the the developers have other priorities in their lives. We don't exactly know how hard they're working, but lately it feels like they're slacking because of all the pushbacks and the unkept promises. We're still waiting for the trailer. Things might go smoother with the fans if you just tell us the truth. Nobody likes to feel like they're being lied to. Especially fans. Please don't disappoint us, guys. I could care less if the game came out 4 years from now. I would rather you say that then keep us waiting for a date that's already come and passed."
mother4,2ttwrs,Destro_,6,Tue Jan 27 18:57:37 2015 UTC,"I think you're taking things a bit far... yea it's disappointing but I don't see where they lied?   Like... ""(Edit - and really, how the heck does the friggin' DEV TEAM not ""have enough footage"" of their own game? Aren't they the ones who, I dunno, have all access passes to every location, line of script, and musical track present in the game?)""  Where was that said? Or ""they haven't even compiled enough ""worthwhile footage"" FOR the video in question?""  And as Far as Shane is concerned, he keeps deleting tweets so I'm almost positive the team doesn't agree with what he tweets. You're projecting pretty hard too... I completely expect them to know what's going on, and there's no way fans are being ignored or forgotten. That probably puts a lot of pressure on them, and of course they know they're not meeting their deadlines.  Getting personally offended because you stayed up late when you were told not to seems ridiculous to me. Not that I'm not annoyed it isn't out by now. I guess I wish we knew why. :c"
mother4,2ttwrs,PunchyG,5,Wed Jan 28 03:45:39 2015 UTC,"No doubt this is going on in every fan's head, regardless of if they're saying so or not.   And let's not forget that at the promised release time (which was even a push-back of the original), all we got was a blog post that promised us a solidified release date in the next few weeks.   I must be not on their clock, because a goddamn month and a half is not a few weeks. Maybe I'm acting entitled, but I'm pretty sure you at least owe somebody an explanation of you can't keep good on your promises.    All I can say is...it better be a HELLUVA good game for rejected fans to even fathom pardoning this sort of behavior.   FTFY"
mother4,2ttwrs,lrios12,2,Tue Jan 27 18:16:59 2015 UTC,"I feel like shit for agreeing with this, but I do.  Regarding Shane, though, he was chastised for his actions, AND the New Years post was almost certainly taken out of context. I think he was referencing the tradition of staying up to see the start of a new year, not staying up for Mother 4. The bit after that was him messing around with the fans, but I don't think it had any sort of malicious intent.    The whole bit regarding what exactly is going on in the development process is super applicable. I mean, the Pastel has posted maybe six times in the Starmen thread in the past three years.  The lead (forgot the current one's name), just posted there for the first time in years a couple of days ago, and that was just to restate things that have already been addressed.  He didn't provide any solid information. It's just not cool to hype it up and keep the fans in the dark.  We haven't even seen any official screenshots in how long? A year?   I can't stop thinking of that one thread on here a while back that got downvoted to oblivion - ""What if it turns out that Mother 4 was just one big joke?"" - or some shit like that.  I honestly hope that this game is good after the years of hype.  I honestly don't have much hope, and I suggest others to follow suit."

In fact, the biggest reason I agree is because the way the team's been so quiet about development and possible issues, the shifting members of the team, the pushing of unrealistic deadlines, the increasing hostility towards the fanbase when questions are asked, and not putting out a trailer after so long with garbage excuses reminds me of another Nintendo-based fan project that I and tons of others were eagerly anticipating for years: URA Zelda.   Granted, certain details are different (URA was a ROM hack vs. Mother 4 being an original game, etc), but considering the similarities so far, I'm worried this could end the same way URA Zelda did. (The bit about a trailer for both projects both not being put out for silly reasons is the spookiest to me.)"

They all have gadgets (in Duster's case, thief's toolbox) that allow them to serve a useful part of the group. In every game, they always have the way of moving through when the party is stuck. Wall Staples, Blowing through a path, and the trek from Winters all move the PSI-wielders through to the trail, using their own ingenuity and respective gadgets. Don't feel bad for the batmen, they all were just as brave and meaningful as they stood next to their super-powered pals. They're just more analog. Loid and Jeff both end up doing most of their damage with their gadget items in the end-game. Anybody who played Mother 2 knows how helpful the Heavy Bazooka becomes when facing multiple enemies at once, as it hits regardless of row, and Mother 3 Hardmode practically require that Duster debuff alongside Kumatora so she can preserve PP for hard-hitting attacks. Bonus points for Boney, who wields a shield-snatcher, if only having to dig through several cups of lifenoodles to get to it. I celebrate the Batmen, who leave their life of near-exile to bring something a certain something to the battles of their partners.

I love the art style, which is what most people have an issue with as they believe it looks like a flash game. My only gripe with the game is the recruitment- a lot of the characters you find cannot be recruited until quite a long time after you meet them- when you do manage to get them in the end they are under levelled as you have been with other team members for much longer- I'm still using the 2 starting characters and then rotating my third member. It has some nice throw backs to Earthbound as well such as a warning in the police station about a young boy beating crows with a cracked bat and the recruitment mission for the cop being 3 waves of Police officer fights (one of whom is called Officer strong)"
mother4,2tknd4,ghost20,3,Tue Jan 27 18:29:33 2015 UTC,"Played for about 10 hours.  The game is great.  Loads of Earthbound references, amazingly creative enemies like TeleFawns and HayHoga, the characters are extremely diverse in play style and great personality, SO much quality voice acting, fun minigames, i could go on.  If Itoi released it, we would be disappointed but this is the best fan game in the Earthbound style I've ever played."

The art style doesn't bother me too much, but for some reason, moving upwards in certain areas makes the game lag (ONLY up; yeah, weird). I just thank God that I can turn voices off.  I only got about five minutes into the game, though, and it fucking crashed. I talked to a non-enemy Protester outside the donut shop, tried opening my menu, and that's what crashed it.

I understand it's a free fan project, but honestly this was started on like 5 years ago and the only thing they've ever had to show for it was 30 seconds of teaser footage. To be honest, when I first saw this project announced I was excited, but decided to completely ignore it and put it off my mind.  I can tell you from first hand experience that if they have nothing to show, then they have nothing at all.  5 years later, I know I made the right choice."

I really liked Mother 3. (Mother 1 aged like milk and you all know it). I hate Mother fans. Every Mother fansite is full the brim of 14-year olds foaming at the mouth over a game by some old Japanese guy that they wouldn't even know about it wasn't for a crossover fighting game. Sure, Mother 4 looks pretty professional and honestly looks like one of the only good things to ever actually come out of this fandom besides sappy fanart, but you guys have to stop acting like robots. I'm not the only one that's pissed at the developers. Call me ungrateful all you want, make sarcastic comments in caps lock with exclamations and ones about how these guys are doing it all for free and yada yada, but I'm sick to death of waiting. It's been months. A delay is perfectly reasonable. I was just as disappointed as all of you when I heard about it, but that wasn't even what ticked me off. Is it so freaking hard to give us one tiny thing to tide us over? And, no, cryptic, teasing tweets don't count. That just makes this worse. By this point, I don't give a shit when this game comes out, as I'm probably gonna enjoy it whenever, but is it seriously so hard to give us something? I dunno, a screenshot, some old pixel art, something! Hell, even a blogpost telling us what we already know! To be blunt- what the hell is taking so long?   Go ahead and downvote this into oblivion.

Mother just happens to be a very strange case... All of the fan base that is still around today are the devoted fans (for the most part) because a lot of the casuals have most likely long forgot about stuff like this. So the casuals dropped out, leaving only the most devoted (again, for the most part).  I agree on how Mother 1 aged. It's a product of its time."

I don't think it's fair to group everyone into that category some of us are just really excited for a Mother 4 I mean it they were good games!

mother4,2soyco,belthesar,1 point,Mon Jan 19 22:45:11 2015 UTC,Have you tried using a download manager like Download Ninja? They increase download speed and you can resume downloads if they cut out.
mother4,2soyco,2years7liters,0,Sat Jan 17 02:24:01 2015 UTC,Or have a friend download it and give it to you. Or go to a local wi-fi spot. There are infinite ways to download and enjoy the wonder of Mother 4 when its released :)
mother4,2sn3r3,PKtheworldisaplace,4,Fri Jan 16 16:36:30 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. It is pretty simple to make a video, but to make a good video as well as do it while juggling, and more importantly, working on the game itself, it'll take a longer time."
mother4,2sn3r3,SuperSamicom,1 point,Fri Jan 16 17:15:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it just seemed like they had the video ready, and then said they didn't post it because of uploading difficulties: ""All of us are having flash backs to the first teaser and its video formatting challenges. Upload times across long distances and various connection qualities are also present… and then after that, there’s youtube processing. It’s a procedure!"" - Pastel  But maybe I'm misunderstanding what he's saying."

mother4,2sn3r3,lunarfalls,2,Tue Jan 20 04:09:24 2015 UTC,"Literally all they have to do is upload the video file to YouTube, I doubt that would even take two weeks on a dial-up connection. It's like you said - they're waiting until they have a definite release date pinned down before releasing the trailer."
mother4,2sn3r3,Epic563,2,Fri Jan 16 19:50:34 2015 UTC,Yeah. It's not just a teaser trailer like the first one. This is the official trailer that will give the release date. The team needs to approximate when they'll be done.
mother4,2sn3r3,ArmoredChocobo,2,Fri Jan 16 21:01:06 2015 UTC,"From what I understand is that the trailer is delayed because they're choosing the choice clips to use from the game in order to make a trailer.  Being a video-maker myself, that's not something you'd bang out over a weekend, especially when you're busy coding a game.   Granted, my editing doesn't take QUITE as long, because my videos are only 15 or so minutes at a time and the only audio I need to add is my own voice, not an entire game condensed down to a 2-3 minute or less-long video that also isn't spoiling anything but still showing it off effectively, and set to music that must be synced and timed well to what the clips are doing.   That's a LOT of work."
mother4,2sn3r3,KayShyGuy,1 point,Wed Jan 21 04:45:19 2015 UTC,"Well at least we know that they updated the official Mother 4 Blog saying that they'll post the official trailer/relesse date soon. Yea its been 2 months since then, but it can't be long now! And think of how much theyre adding and fixing! It might end up being 40+ hours! Hope?"
mother4,2sgctx,PKtheworldisaplace,4,Wed Jan 14 23:05:55 2015 UTC,"I think this game looks interesting and I might want to give it a shot. However, I certainly think this cannot triumph the amazingness of Mother."
mother4,2sgctx,Ness6464,3,Thu Jan 15 02:30:11 2015 UTC,"I just played through it, it's absolutely incredible.  Definitely heavy Mother-vibes from it, and I believe there's even a reference or two. I remember early on there being a guy named ""Lukas"" who was blonde.  The music is amazing, the art is amazing, it's full of hilarious bits, and the story is incredible.  Although I will say that this game isn't for everyone. It deals with a lot of gore, rape, abuse, drugs, etc. It has it's very heavy and disturbing moments. The game can be absolutely brutal at times, and hilarious at others.  The world is huge and stuffed with so much extra content to explore, lots of teammates to recruit, and events that you'll probably miss on your first play-through.  This has quickly become one of my favorite RPGs of all-time, the story is absolutely gut-wrenching, don't spoil the ending for yourself!"
mother4,2sgctx,Ryswick,0,Thu Jan 22 10:10:36 2015 UTC,Absolutely not.
mother4,2sgctx,dogbulb,4,Thu Jan 15 03:24:45 2015 UTC,"I've run through it twice and I loved it, so my opinion is biased but the developer has said in at least one interview (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0TbSw8xSJw) that he drew a lot of inspiration from Earthbound and lots of the music is EB music edited slightly.  And yes, it's very disturbing. To say what is really disturbing about it would be spoiling it, but the game takes you on a ride and makes sure you can't get off. It's well made, engrossing and it definitely will remind you of EB at certain points although it's seen through a very dark mirror."
mother4,2sgctx,Goodbye18000,5,Thu Jan 15 00:58:59 2015 UTC,"The Earthbound-iness turned me on to it, but after watching a bit of it on a Let's Play, it was almost... too creepy. In a bunch of ways. Like there's the actual physical scariness of some enemies that are weird, mutated... things. And then there's the story and atmosphere which are WAAAAAY unsettling. I like that Mother games are (generally) nice and pleasant and only quirky weird, not outright disturbing except for maybe one scene (Giygas, Tanetane)"

mother4,2sgctx,PotatoSenpai,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:54:55 2015 UTC,"Oh. It's been a little while. I don't quite remember where the claus clone is but when you get to the first crossroads, continue (right) past the different caves until you find the broken bridge with Fardy's truck. The first time you reach there, you see a dude with yellow pointy hair (the similarity) say something about ""sorry brother"" and then he just dies. The message on the bottom screen when he dies reads: Lukas died. If I remember correctly there's a character named Clothe (Claus) in the game, but I don't remember. You could ask Dingaling, he's been pretty open with his e-mails."

mother4,2sgctx,ArmoredChocobo,0,Wed Jan 14 23:42:19 2015 UTC,"I don't like it. The humor is too off and too raunchy and gritty to make it Mother-like.  Mother games had dark undertones, but most of it was bright and fun, even when the dark stuff happened.   In Lisa you got people committing suicide on a whim, and that's the punchline.  People only call it Earthbound like because the humor is ""wacky"". Earthbound didn't become our favorite game due to JUST being ""wacky"". ""Wacky"" was definitely in the equation, but there's very tender moments, and that was topped with brilliant music and environments. You can't just make any old rpg, throw humor at it, and then call it ""like Earthbound"", that's just rude.  I'm not putting down Lisa for doing it's own thing, it's just the fact of labeling it like you did that I disagree with."
mother4,2sgctx,catzalot,-4,Wed Jan 21 04:37:54 2015 UTC,"Not really in the vein of Mother/EB at all. The battle system looks sorta similar, that's it."
mother4,2sgctx,mouseywithpower,4,Wed Jan 14 23:17:40 2015 UTC,"are you just overlooking all the similarities? look at the animations in the overworld, look at the sprite style, listen to the music. this is a huge love letter to mother, with a dark bent to it."
mother4,2sgctx,catzalot,-6,Thu Jan 15 17:58:09 2015 UTC,I'm just not seeing it dude.  I think confirmation bias is taking hold here.
mother4,2sgctx,mouseywithpower,4,Thu Jan 15 20:28:53 2015 UTC,"i think willful ignorance is taking hold. the darkness aside, the text boxes are the same, the font is the same, the animation is very similar, the music is literally EB slightly shifted according to the dev, and the humour is just as weird and tongue-in-cheek as EB. you don't want this to be compared to something you like because you think it's inferior, so you're writing it off. i have no connection to the game and learned about it when i saw this thread. i have no reason to need a conformation bias, but i definitely see the mother influence (that the dev has confirmed) in this game."
mother4,2sgctx,catzalot,-6,Thu Jan 15 20:54:35 2015 UTC,"Wow, you got so mad you forgot how to use capitalization!  Look, not saying it is a bad game, just that it looks like it plays nothing like EB. It's a 2d overworld.  EDIT: also, the text itself is not EB/M3s text. Maybe M1, but not really. The text boxes look the same, yes, so what?"
mother4,2sgctx,XJohnson12,-4,Thu Jan 15 22:53:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. This isn't anything like mother. It seems really vulgar and nasty (Nasty as in gorish and creepy) I mean seriously an enemy blows his brains out, the dialogue isn't clever or charming, and the word ""bar"" is written in blood.  The game is also very indecisive with it's themes. It ranges from grimly realistic gore and critical situations to strange and in my opinion, off putting concepts. Earthbound handled creepiness and executed it's mixed themes very well and was successfully able to implement dark creepy events from reality and layer them with quirky smile inducing humor and a solid plot that made you want to play over and over again.  The story's plot is in a post-apocalyptic universe where all women are gone and a man named brad who has a baby girl shown in the opening trailer, perhaps the last girl on earth and he wants to protect her from the world. At the beginning of the game the child, now an adolescent or pre-adolescent, is kidnapped, providing the impetus for the adventures to follow. As the story continues we begin to see very off putting concepts and weird enemies and fighting situations. Like constant blood splatters, shooting, and scary opponent sprites. Mother 3 had dark, mature themes and cursing but it was handled in a non vulgar way, while this game consists of splattered organs and blood, using it as a tool to define the gravity of what is taking place rather than using dialogue and other skillful plot elements to do so.  The humor is another thing that makes me cringe. While The Earthbound/Mother series had clever humor and witty dialogue this game relies on toilet humor and sick jokes to keep the audiences' attention. While this mix-up of styles is deliberate, it makes it harder to understand how to react to the game. Is it deliberately offensive simply for the sake of its own offensiveness? Is it trying to make you feel terrible for laughing at a game that freely mixes up juvenile fart jokes and 80's professional wrestling characters with plot points that include children being gang-raped and burned alive?  Overall It’s not fun, it’s emotionally draining thanks to its story alone, and also because of design elements that may or may not be intentional. Like the 8-bit RPGs its character moves at a snail’s pace, and it’s full of cut scenes and flashbacks that can’t be skipped. Its characters are annoying, its navigation is tedious and its fight scenes difficult yet dull which makes playing Lisa a miserable experience.  I've done some research on his game and found this screenshot  https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/001/312/926/87a442b0952e916a67277637cf4a3fb2_large.png?1384210739  I do realize that it's not good to write things off but from what I'm seeing this game is really bizarre and disturbing. Definitely nowhere near the level of Earthbound/Mother official and even fan games.  A love letter to Mother? This crap doesn't deserve to be in the same sentence in Mother as it causes me to look away in disgust every time I see it."
mother4,2sgctx,XJohnson12,6,Fri Jan 16 01:47:13 2015 UTC,hey bud... it's ok...
mother4,2sgctx,NeedshelppleaseIbeg,-12,Fri Jan 16 02:55:36 2015 UTC,What is this crap? How could you even compare this garbage to the Earthbound/Mother series?

mother4,2sghbg,swifterthansanic,14,Wed Jan 14 23:42:26 2015 UTC,"Don't worry. You haven't missed anything. The Development Team is working on a Trailer as we speak.

mother4,2sfbgx,XeniKobalt,5,Wed Jan 14 23:24:53 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I'm feeling the same way. Why does the first game in several years with any similarity to the Mother series end up having such a dividing art direction? To their development team - kudos for reviving the mechanics of a beautiful series and shame on you for the dirty artwork. If this doesn't sell well, it will only further the disconnect at Nintendo for pushing the Mother series."
mother4,2sfbgx,ferricyanide,2,Mon Jan 19 06:30:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  I totally, completely respect the devs for pumping this out, but the art style just isn't what I'm looking for."

I doubt it, sounds like it trends far too wacky and stays there. Earthbound isn't about being wacky, it's about being humorous and heartfelt at the same time.   I hate how people associate the Mother series with wackiness and nothing but. Mother's a hell of a lot more than that."
mother4,2sfbgx,ArmoredChocobo,2,Sat Jan 24 02:07:33 2015 UTC,"As someone who has played Earthbound since the day it was released, I can personally admit that I've referred to the game as wacky. You fight hippies and trashcans and cult members and dinosaurs. If the game is anything, it's wacky."
mother4,2sfbgx,iprizefighter,3,Thu Jan 15 07:48:15 2015 UTC,"It's not exactly wacky, it's humorous. It's one big parody. It parodies american life, it parodies your generic japanese RPG.  Now fighting an alien on the wing of a 747 with a boiling hot burrito, that's wacky."

mother4,2sfbgx,Camrocs,1 point,Wed Jan 14 20:26:49 2015 UTC,"This is an indie game. I've seen it before. Pretty sure the developer posted about it on Starmen.net not along ago.  edit: it WAS an indie game, but then Atlus picked it up after a failed kickstarter campaign."
mother4,2sfbgx,dillonEh,1 point,Wed Jan 21 19:40:18 2015 UTC,"I'm about 6 hours into this game, and it is hard to put down.

mother4,2sfbgx,iprizefighter,1 point,Thu Jan 15 08:52:53 2015 UTC,It's amazing and addicting and something I feel deserves a chance by all. Play it and don't let its art stop you.

It's reassurance that the ship is sailing in steady seas. It just would have been nice if he shot down the comments about working with Nintendo and a close release date once he realized his comments were stirring a lot of people in those directions. Instead, a lot of his comments seemed to contain a secret (maybe they did in a subtle way we haven't yet realized, just about little parts in the game that we won't get until it's released). Guaranteed I'm not putting him down - I'll continue watching his feed. I just feel baited now and then and it's painful since I've been watching this project since the Mother 3 translation was ongoing. PK Love yinz Mother 4 team!"

mother4,2rzkcy,ferricyanide,5,Sun Jan 11 16:21:52 2015 UTC,"Looks like he's wielding a mini light saber and is shrouded. Besides that, there is no other evidence pointing to this enemy being drawn from Star Wars. I suppose it's up to you to decide whether to how deeply this is actually pulling from the series. Most newly formed creations use small pieces of information from existing themes or ideas - so to some extent I'm sure Star Wars is slightly involved in developing the enemy. Besides that, I don't think we will be seeing Yoda.   Either that, or it's a clue. Star Wars is out in 2015, just like Mother 4. This film features Daisy Ridley as an actress. Ridley is also the name of the director of the original alien. Alf was also an alien. Alf was brown. Brown is the color of mud. It's very muddy after snow melts in spring.  SPRING 2015 CONFIRMED!"
mother4,2rzkcy,nat_noah,2,Sat Jan 10 19:41:22 2015 UTC,I thought it looked almost Starman-ish.

mother4,2rwyrl,MotherFan,1 point,Sat Jan 10 18:09:52 2015 UTC,"My response to an earlier post:   This is a fun theory, but before anyone gets too happy with it, I suggest that you take a look at Nintendo's track record (or, the track record of any major video game giant). Such an action by Nintendo would be unprecedented.  Now, in regards to the OP's first point, the C&D thing was most likely meant for the LP'ing community, and ended up broadly, loosely letting in the possibility of fan games.  ""Is it possible Nintendo bought this apparently unused Mother 4 domain during the fan game's development to be able to take a part in it somehow? I guess we'll all find out soon.""  Think of this actually happening. It sounds like silly movie nonsense (no offense, OP! I love you!). There are much better ways to do that sort of thing, and buying the domain would do more to actually hinder the spread of the game than to help it, for the majority of its development.  Now, with the second point: ""The release date of Mother 4 getting pushed back.""  Shane and Co. have hinted that this is due to uploading problems on their end, and the general confusion of putting everything together for the first release.

In Mother 3 it says porky was shut out from all space and time and ended up in the Nowhere islands using the phase distorter. My question was rhetorical.

mother4,2rdx6s,Demoneyez,10,Mon Jan 5 09:26:40 2015 UTC,Oddly enough it adds up. Itoi mentioned he'd love to play a new Mother game. Maybe he caught wind of it and got Nintendo involved. They have been very secretive about the project since the redesign.
mother4,2rdx6s,Checker88,9,Mon Jan 5 10:19:58 2015 UTC,"This is a fun theory, but before anyone gets too happy with it, I suggest that you take a look at Nintendo's track record (or, the track record of any major video game giant).  Such an action by Nintendo would be unprecedented.  Now, in regards to the OP's first point, the C&D thing was most likely meant for the LP'ing community, and ended up broadly, loosely letting in the possibility of fan games.  ""Is it possible Nintendo bought this apparently unused Mother 4 domain during the fan game's development to be able to take a part in it somehow? I guess we'll all find out soon.""  Think of this actually happening.  It sounds like silly movie nonsense (no offense, OP!  I love you!).  There are much better ways to do that sort of thing, and buying the domain would do more to actually hinder the spread of the game than to help it, for the majority of its development.   Now, with the second point: ""The release date of Mother 4 getting pushed back.""  Shane and Co. have hinted that this is due to uploading problems on their end, and the general confusion of putting everything together for the first release.   As for #3, I don't know anything about this.  What happened?   Edit: Also, the fact that this is a PC game....  Ninty doesn't do PC."
mother4,2rdx6s,Checker88,1 point,Mon Jan 5 15:38:04 2015 UTC,"Lets just say this truly is the case. It's true that buying the domain would hinder the spread of the game, if the domain were bought by Nintendo before Mother 4's development.  However, despite the domain being there before the fan-game's development, I believe Nintendo would have bought it AFTER somebody else had already made it. This is where the #3 comes in.  For a long while the Mother4 domain was inactive besides for it just being a red screen. But a while after Nintendo talked about C&Ds, the domain suddenly updated, having just the small, animated Mr. Saturn sprite in the middle of the page added. Only after this did Shane Mesa even bring up the domain on Twitter."
mother4,2rdx6s,gameonion,5,Mon Jan 5 15:51:54 2015 UTC,"This is incredibly interesting.  I don't think it points in any way, definitely. As someone who is somewhat ""in the industry"". the thought of Nintendo being behind this in any positive way sounds absurd.   Edit:  I just want to say, if this miracle is true, I will be so incredibly ecstatic.  Not only would it help the devs out (them Nintendollars, that prestige), but it would also bring more attention to the Mother series, AND set a stunning precedent for other companies to follow.  But, as I said before, it isn't likely.   Edit 2: A timeline would help.    Edit 3:  Reggie Fils'Aime mentioned Mother 3 at the last E3.  In the video, he used a fire plant from the Mario series to burn a fan who heckled Reggie for a US Mother 3 release.  Such acknowledgement might point to your conclusion.  You might want to add that to the OP.  Edit 4: Concerning The Regginator's actions at the last E3, he did the same joke about Star Fox before, and then Star Fox was released. There is hope, but be warned about over hyping it.  Edit 5: I just read an interview that suggested that Itoi and Iwata are good friends. Slight glimmer of hope..."

I'll add that to the OP in a bit :)  I know this theory is very far-fetched, but today things have been coming up that are making it seem more likely.  Whether it be Nintendo simply helping with advertisement, or actually allowing a release on console, I don't know. But I do think they may be involved in some way."

mother4,2rdx6s,Checker88,4,Mon Jan 5 09:45:39 2015 UTC,"I think they would still provide that. Whether it were released for 3DS or just advertised in general by Nintendo, it will still be available on PC."

mother4,2rd5va,PKtheworldisaplace,2,Mon Jan 5 03:37:54 2015 UTC,"Well Earthbound came out in June of 1995, but I think it has more to do with the fact the game was thought to release in June 2013, then was moved to Winter 2014 when the trailer came out in August that same year, and now was moved to early 2015.  This I get from the fact that the ""June"" easter egg has been in the site's code for a long time, even before the recent delay. I don't think they were simultaneously planning to release in Winter 2014 AND June 2015."
mother4,2rd5va,ArmoredChocobo,3,Wed Jan 7 02:25:27 2015 UTC,I don't think so. This easter egg was already there before their announcement of delaying the game to early 2015 so it might be more related to the game than the release date. I surely hope so...
mother4,2rd5va,Aeroga,1 point,Mon Jan 5 04:04:53 2015 UTC,"Well, the Easter egg was out a long time ago. The reason it's June is probably because, before the game was slated for Winter 2014, it was originally supposed to be June, and the web designers expected us to find the Easter egg sooner, in an attempt to surprise us with a release month."

They won't C&D it, but they certainly wouldn't be helping develop it, they're too busy with other things for that, and there would be no profit.

mother4,2r32st,PunchyG,2,Sat Jan 3 01:27:30 2015 UTC,"Or they're just vamping for time, considering how they posted a blogpost in November after radio silence saying they'd post a trailer in the next month and.. it's already been over a month, and now they're making excuses for not posting things?  People have a reason to be kinda frustrated and all this ""joke tweet"" stuff is kind of in bad taste. It's an emotionally manipulative way to garner hype, which is sort of disappointing."

mother4,2pi05c,Destro_,14,Tue Dec 16 19:53:08 2014 UTC,It's not ours. We would've used it from the get-go if we could have.  The Mr. Saturn is new. It used to just be a red background. Curious!
mother4,2pi05c,the-dave,2,Tue Dec 16 23:10:15 2014 UTC,Hmmm. Wonder if it is Nintendo then?
mother4,2pi05c,pizzaslut69420,2,Wed Dec 24 05:51:07 2014 UTC,Doubt it. The HTML is not professional. It uses a center tag and br tags for positioning. The center tag isn't closed. And use of the bgcolor attribute on body tags is deprecated.  I guess Nintendo could do that on purpose. But that doesn't add up.
mother4,2pi05c,the-dave,2,Wed Dec 24 19:28:19 2014 UTC,Oh. Then it's just downright strange I guess.
mother4,2pi05c,pizzaslut69420,2,Wed Dec 24 21:48:05 2014 UTC,"If we assume the theory I posted not long ago is true, this would be the case because Nintendo bought the domain after somebody else already started it."

mother4,2oq38g,JusticeIncarnate,18,Tue Dec 9 04:50:40 2014 UTC,"Mother 4 is a 100% fan made game. It is not backed by nintendo, however, nintendo has not taken any action against the game or it's developers. It is currently in the final stages of development and is being released early 2015. WAS supposed to be this month, but they wanted to tweak and add more stuff.  Earthbound Forever....no one knows. As it stands now, it appears to be nothing more than rumor and speculation. It's really to early to tell one way or the other.  What things would you like to know that can't be found on google? Try Starmen.net and earthboundcentral.com  Also, PLAY THE GAMES. They're great."
mother4,2oq38g,LC_Music,3,Tue Dec 9 04:54:51 2014 UTC,"The great thing about these games is that they don't have much to do with each other at all. Mother 3 never came to america, but it was so good that it got a fan made translation for game boy advance emulators. For all that is holy, I strongly recommend getting a gba emulator, an english version of mother 3 and playing it. One of the greatest games that never came to america. Earthbound is also amazing.

To those without an nvidia shield, they can use Limelight (an open source gamestream client on android) they can use.  Of course this will only work given the host computer has an NVidia card with a GTX 650 or greater.  And.. you know once this game is out, I will go trying to port it to my Raspberry Pi.

mother4,2mwx5q,sansaka,1 point,Mon Nov 24 00:11:21 2014 UTC,Is v-sync necessary for a game like this? Actually asking
mother4,2mwx5q,the-dave,6,Fri Nov 21 04:47:10 2014 UTC,V-sync prevents gnarly tearing. You'll want it enabled.  (Tearing is when the game draws only part of the screen before the monitor refreshes. So you get half-ish of the new frame and half-ish of the old frame and it looks bad and ugly and gross. V-sync makes the game draw in sync with the monitor's refreshes.)
mother4,2mwx5q,sansaka,1 point,Fri Nov 21 09:19:37 2014 UTC,"Thanks Dave, I thought since some games don't have the option to toggle it (either permanently on or off), v-sync setting is only needed for games with higher system requirements."

Based off our data, we developed for the most common platform: the computer. There's only a dozen of us volunteering. With requests every day for every platform you can think of—Andriod, iOS, Ouya, SNES, Wii and more—we will never satisfy everyone. Instead, we want the most amount of people to have the best experience.   That being said, if someone wants to hack or mod it to work on something else then go for it!"

mother4,2miwu0,Checker88,6,Mon Jan 5 22:05:23 2015 UTC,"The trade off in performance would kill the experience. It's already not great running actual ROMs on a hacked PSP, I can only imagine it would be nearly unplayable with all the modern sound files and graphics funneled through a SNES emulator."
mother4,2miwu0,fritztopher,4,Mon Nov 17 04:11:27 2014 UTC,"It would be nigh impossible to port a game written in C++ to work on SNES, it would basically have to be reprogrammed from scratch. Loads of work for no point."
mother4,2miwu0,Tranzlater,1 point,Mon Nov 17 13:35:25 2014 UTC,"Sides the fact the Mother 4 animations and graphics are Mother 3 and up, and thus out of SNES's capability anyway."
mother4,2miwu0,ArmoredChocobo,3,Wed Nov 19 02:09:46 2014 UTC,"It's not a rom, it's an .exe.  It's even made in C++.  Roms are only digital copies off a console cartridge."
mother4,2miwu0,ArmoredChocobo,2,Mon Nov 17 22:54:08 2014 UTC,"now that 3DS homebrew is almost out, it would be cool to see it on there."
mother4,2miwu0,holopleasures,1 point,Mon Nov 17 06:38:18 2014 UTC,This. How hard would it be to port?
mother4,2miwu0,shadow85,6,Mon Nov 17 09:54:41 2014 UTC,"You'd have to remake the game from scratch. 3DS coding is not C++. This game will never exist on a nintendo handheld. Someone could make a program to run it on PS Vita, but it would be a ton of work. Think waiting another 1.5 - 2 years just for that."
mother4,2miwu0,pemricht,4,Mon Nov 17 16:23:38 2014 UTC,"But, the 3DS runs on the same ARM11 architecture as the Vita? So if someone ported it to Android/Vita with low performance devices (such as 3DS) in mind, I think it'd be fine. Especially with the New 3DS' increase in power."
mother4,2miwu0,BanjoChaos,1 point,Tue Nov 18 16:30:03 2014 UTC,"Well, hopefully someone ports it as a PSP ISO like someone did with Cave Story then. I've played all the Mothers on my PSP, and I feel they're better for me on a handheld. I honestly hate any kind of gaming on a PC/Mac, so I suppose I'll just have to wait and hope."
mother4,2miwu0,Arklese1zure,1 point,Mon Nov 17 19:13:43 2014 UTC,"Maybe not as a ROM, but I'd like seeing a port. It's just that the feeling of playing it on a handheld makes it a lot better for me. Maybe because I played through Mother 3 on my phone."
mother4,2m7rs2,Icedude545,9,Thu Nov 13 20:53:48 2014 UTC,How is BuzzBuzz Ninten? And why would he come from the future if Ninten is from the past?
mother4,2m7rs2,PKtheworldisaplace,3,Fri Nov 14 05:19:21 2014 UTC,"Yeah I don't believe that for a second.  Ninten is, if anything, Ness's father."

mother4,2m7rs2,Ehhdan,1 point,Thu Dec 4 03:01:55 2014 UTC,I've heard worse. I've heard people say Earthbound is just a remake of Earthbound Zero (AKA Mother)
mother4,2m7rs2,luckjes112,2,Thu Dec 18 19:52:53 2014 UTC,which means they haven't played either of the games ever.
mother4,2m7rs2,ArmoredChocobo,0,Thu Dec 18 21:16:02 2014 UTC,That's like saying Adventure of Link is a remake of Legend of Zelda.
mother4,2m7rs2,luckjes112,6,Sat Dec 20 10:33:44 2014 UTC,It looks like a very generic UFO. Could be a coincidence. But I like your line of thinking.
mother4,2m7rs2,Parkmayn,2,Sat Nov 15 00:33:56 2014 UTC,"I think that the Earthbound cover is supposed to take place in Ness's time, not the future where Giygas takes over.  Ness also lives in Eagleland, which is not technically America. Mother 4 will take place in America."
mother4,2m7rs2,catzalot,2,Thu Nov 13 23:06:35 2014 UTC,didnt they just say it was america-esqe? just like earthbound?
mother4,2m7rs2,DigitalAge98,2,Sat Nov 15 23:32:40 2014 UTC,"Those UFOs are definitely reminiscent of the ones seen in Mother 2, but they're most likely just a throwback enemy with no plot relevance."
mother4,2m7rs2,dillonEh,1 point,Mon Nov 17 09:56:01 2014 UTC,"A UFO is a UFO. It could be anything, from a nod to Giygas' UFOs to just a plain ol' flying saucer."
mother4,2m7rs2,luckjes112,2,Thu Dec 18 19:53:57 2014 UTC,"Here's my theory:  It's a pre-sequel. It comes after Mother 2 (Earthbound), but before Mother 3.  Giygas's people have noticed the disappearance of both Giegue and his psychic energy (Giygas), and have figured something bad has happened so they send something like a scout team. They soon find out that Earthlings were responsible for his destruction and begin the whole alien ""destroy the humans"" thing.  The Modern Men are humans that have been captured by these invaders and turned into servants. Kinda like the Borg plus the Pigmask army.  The slime spires are either:   Telecommunication devices to coordinate their efforts. Psychic amplifiers to mass control animals and extend their range to the Modern Men. Power generators for their psychic abilities.   or a combination of those things.  Ultimately they do enough damage to society that even though they're beaten by the heroes, the world is too destroyed to live on and the survivors take off in the ""White Ship"" to find a new world.  Thus a dark segue into Mother 3."
mother4,2m7rs2,ArmoredChocobo,1 point,Mon Nov 17 23:03:01 2014 UTC,"this does make sense especially because there is a pic of a train that got de-railed on the side of a hill, and also weird aliens (maybe chimeras). the only thing that is strange is you would think the world gets more destroyed as the game progresses, but the train pic just has floyd and travis, which makes me think its not that far in the game. one thing that is unconvincing is there is a pic with all 4 of them and the town seems perfectly fine."
mother4,2m7rs2,dragnmastr00,1 point,Fri Nov 21 01:10:05 2014 UTC,"The train pic could just be that, a screenshot of a derailed train.  It doesn't exactly mean that the world is destroyed, nor that it's early in the game. Heck, You start chapter 7 of Mother 3 with just Lucas and Boney, and no one here would say that's near the beginning."
mother4,2m7rs2,ArmoredChocobo,1 point,Fri Nov 21 05:34:04 2014 UTC,"I was thinking similiar, but different. I too thought of a prequel. Mostly because I can't think of any way to continue Mother 3s plot. I thought the modern men were some cult or terrorist army. And the game would end with a select few being led aboard the white ship. Remember that? Maybe the final area of the game would be the Nowhere Islands? Speaking of which, a theory of mine states that the Kingdom of Oseho never existed and that Tazmilly isn't really old. Maybe that might be proven (or not). I'm at least very excited! I hope Chuggaaconroy will LP it!"

mother4,2m1aat,ArmoredChocobo,1 point,Wed Nov 12 09:54:18 2014 UTC,"This is possible, the site was made in August 2013, so June 2014 would have been a feasible release date (about a year after the site and teaser), but then they decided ""lets go for winter 2014 into 2015"" but never edited that out."

mother4,2m1aat,zaneriley,1 point,Wed Nov 12 22:49:46 2014 UTC,"I'm thinking that's the js for the website itself, it looks like they have the cheet.js related stuff isolated in that single line of code (466) directly in  index.html. I would guess production.js is from one of the components they list, which might have keybindings built in, but aren't being used for this project."
mother4,2m1aat,killer4u77,3,Thu Nov 13 05:27:58 2014 UTC,"Production.js does hold all the components (minifying HTTP requests), but should also hold all our inline JS at the bottom as well. However, I couldn't get it all working in time. I'm sure its a novice JS mistake (open to tips!).  Good job on the humans.txt sleuthing.

mother4,2lw93s,joshman196,12,Tue Nov 11 03:31:07 2014 UTC,"Eh. The thing about Duke Nukem is that it was a game that was in development, then mothballed, then picked back up, then mothballed again, then scrapped, then built again. The development of the game a few years ago never had any significant delays as far as I can remember.   What Miyamoto is saying is in reference to active development that necessitates delays to ensure a quality product. Not vaporware that got picked up, developed quickly, and pushed to release with serious issues still in tact."
mother4,2lw93s,Wark_Kweh,21,Tue Nov 11 15:13:49 2014 UTC,I don't even mind the delay. Really this is good news cause now we get a release date. All aboard the hype train!

mother4,2kwaoe,thomar,3,Fri Oct 31 17:46:39 2014 UTC,"Right. But didn't the lead coder of Mother 4 create an entire ""Mother 4"" engine from scratch to help him make the game? I feel like the release of that engine would make it a whole lot easier for others to create their own Mother fangames in the future, which would be awesome. It would be easier than Unity because it would already have the basic tenants of Mother programmed in, right? Though they did announce that it wasn't going to be ""open-source"", at least, not at first."

mother4,2ku1ov,mygamefox,0,Fri Oct 31 00:04:51 2014 UTC,"A post on twitter isn't an update..  There's literally been nothing for over a year.  Look, I'm just as big of a fan of the series as the rest of us but I don't think it's an overreaction to say that no updates for over a year/no updates 2 months before the year is over is a dead project."

Yes this was awhile ago, but we all have to have faith in them. I assume, or hope rather, that they are working their ass off and don't have time to post on Twitter.

At least, I know I was as that trailer wrapped up and the laughs got more maddening in the back track. It looks amazing, the soundtrack stuff I've heard from Mesa is delightful, and music combos return with PK Beam. I decided recently that my backlog was so full that I had to finish some games before I take on anymore, so that's what will keep me busy until I get my email tellin' me that Mother 4 is pipin' hot. Here's hoping they drop us a line letting us know it's still on track! I'll be trying to finish EB0 and Xenoblade Chronicles in the meantime (;"
mother4,2j401g,mobclutch,7,Mon Oct 13 19:07:09 2014 UTC,"yeah im excited too, but watch them delay it till 2015. Theyve hardly updated or given us any news so ive got this feeling im my gut that they might pull a duke nukem forever and delay it."

I remember when Mother 4 was going to be an RPG Maker game; it's exciting to see how the project has evolved into its own.   I truly hope that Shigesato Itoi gives it a try when it comes out... and is translated to Japanese. He did say he wanted to be the player of the next Mother game, so it'll be interesting to see his reaction when he is given the chance to do just that."
mother4,2j401g,theapplekid,3,Wed Oct 15 14:37:31 2014 UTC,"He really said he was interested in playing Mother 4? That's awesome. The more I read about that guy, the more down to earth he sounds."

mother4,2j401g,catzalot,1 point,Fri Oct 24 00:21:42 2014 UTC,"He says he wants to be the player for the nest Mother game. It's a little ways down in the interview.  http://earthboundcentral.com/2011/04/shigesato-itoi-discusses-mother-4/  ITOI: The feeling of, “I want a MOTHER 4 to be released!” is inside me, too. Even if it’s not something I need to do, I still feel that way. Still, there isn’t someone for me to watch over from afar anymore. If there were a fourth game, I’d want to be the player."
mother4,2j401g,AlistairePoole,9,Mon Nov 3 18:00:11 2014 UTC,"I'm worried that the team might pull a Starbound on us.  I keep reminding myself that it is a story driven game, and they don't want to spread spoilers."
mother4,2j401g,catzalot,2,Mon Oct 13 16:02:47 2014 UTC,"What happened with Starbound, if you don't mind the question :P"
mother4,2j401g,Parkmayn,4,Wed Oct 22 23:59:53 2014 UTC,"Depending on who you ask, they took the money and ran.   The team (chucklefish), still works on the game, but it is nowhere close to what they promised.  The game is so slowly updated, that the game is on the same official release for 7 months."
mother4,2j401g,Gorvi,4,Thu Oct 23 01:23:39 2014 UTC,"Judging by the fact that Mother 4 will be free, I don't think this will happen."
mother4,2j401g,catzalot,-7,Sun Nov 2 19:49:24 2014 UTC,This is an absolute lie.  Avoid early access games if that is the attitude you bring.
mother4,2j401g,Gorvi,1 point,Thu Oct 23 04:26:29 2014 UTC,"What about it is a lie?  When was the last stable release?  When did they promise the full release of the game?  Did I say they abandoned the game?  Did I say the game didn't have buggy unoffical ""nightly"" updates?"
mother4,2j401g,catzalot,-7,Thu Oct 23 13:44:43 2014 UTC,"You have no understanding of game development, and Starbound devs have stated multiple times why we get nightlies over ""stable"" releases.  The only thing you have to get mad at is your own ignorance."
mother4,2j401g,Gorvi,2,Thu Oct 23 19:28:37 2014 UTC,"I've taken part in other early access games. Both Minecraft and Terraria. Neither of those have been disappointing.  I do blame myself for being foolish and buying it, but thanks to Starbound, I will never by another Early Access game.  I know how game development works, I have taken classes on it, and developed basic games with my friends.  I also used to be a Super Mario World Rom Hacker, and I can tell you I understand why they are not fulfilling their promises.  However, it is THEIR fault for breaking their promises so many times, not mine.  Oh, and I still don't see where I was lying. Seems like someone owes me an apology."
mother4,2j401g,catzalot,-4,Thu Oct 23 19:33:14 2014 UTC,"As I have stated many times before.  Its crap like this which alienates devs from the rest of the general community.  I was shocked to see Starbound slander spread into other game threads.  How about you try genuinely show passion for something rather than jump hype to hate trains at each passing.  Devs have kept to their promise as far as I can see.  Another thing that completely baffles me is how a Mother fan, who are some of the most unheard and patient fans in gaming history, to act this way.  There was a 12 year development gap between Mother 2 and 3.  The only thing I will apologize for is the way you feel about buying the game."
mother4,2j401g,Gorvi,-1,Thu Oct 23 19:52:46 2014 UTC,"They took a public job.   I'm still peeved Mother 3 never made it to America.  Chucklefish hasn't released the full game yet, they said they'd have it done by now.   You called me a liar, I demand an apology. Don't you dare come in and slander me, and then switch tactics and instead slander me on other fronts instead of apologizing."
mother4,2j401g,AlistairePoole,-3,Thu Oct 23 19:55:40 2014 UTC,"It is coming along just fine.  Ignore those who have no understanding how much time and effort goes into developing a game, and the engine it runs on, from scratch.  I would suggest following The Starbound Website for all the amazing and quick progress they have been making."
mother4,2j401g,SageWaterDragon,2,Thu Oct 23 04:30:08 2014 UTC,Is it really about a month away? Have they confirmed anything more specific than 'Winter 2014'?
mother4,2j401g,TinManOz,1 point,Wed Oct 15 22:49:36 2014 UTC,"Well, in America, Winter starts around the week of Xmas, so my guess is December. Other than that, no concrete date besides the general release time."
mother4,2j401g,geon12,3,Wed Oct 22 23:58:41 2014 UTC,"Wait, serious question: Winter doesn't start at the same time around the northern hemisphere? I thought that was kind of the entire point of seasons."

mother4,2j401g,Zomby_Goast,9,Tue Oct 14 02:26:23 2014 UTC,So what those guys are doing is taking hard work of M3 translation team- which was meant to be a non-profit project- to earn money for themselves.. That's not cool....
mother4,2j401g,Zomby_Goast,-1,Fri Oct 17 05:38:40 2014 UTC,They're official carts made by the translation team. That's just a reseller.
mother4,2j401g,CarbonHydro,5,Mon Oct 27 16:36:12 2014 UTC,Is this basically just a flash cart with a patched ROM on it?
mother4,2j401g,geon12,1 point,Thu Oct 16 07:29:12 2014 UTC,"I meant the Mother 3 cart in the link, not Mother 4."

mother4,2h1rpi,shadow85,4,Sun Sep 21 21:08:36 2014 UTC,I hope the engine source is released. I would love to see a port on a homebrew console/handheld.

However, it sounded like it would have been more work than it was worth as alot of the system they are using/making would have to be tweaked for the game to be on android.  I do remember reading a post from one of the devs way back that they had not planned on releasing engine source with the game. Azure had future plans for it at the time.   Then again that was about two years ago so who knows now."

mother4,2gvlb6,PalPlays,9,Fri Sep 19 17:18:33 2014 UTC,"Let's Player here too. Asking for ""advance notice"" is kinda what makes companies hate us. We shouldn't get any special treatment just cause we talk over the game for the internet."
mother4,2gvlb6,Goodbye18000,-2,Fri Sep 19 18:32:12 2014 UTC,"They aren't a company, they're a private group of people making a fangame that needs to be advertised more. It's no different than when indie developers contact me in the hopes of me doing a game review. Sometimes (like a case last week) they gave me the game a week before it came out so I can prepare for my review.  This group of motivated fans/developers are not Nintendo, and thus they shouldn't act like it. That is why I'm asking: maybe the devs want to make use of resources like us that Nintendo turns their nose up at."
mother4,2gvlb6,Sausagepwns,1 point,Mon Oct 6 21:04:01 2014 UTC,"Hmm..... seems a bit suspicious...  I agree with goodbye, I'm also a let's player. But what it seems like is that you're taking advantage of these guys just because they're not some big indie company. I know that they're not a massive gaming company just fans wanting to make a sequel to a beloved game, but you're using the fact that you're a let's player to get what you want which kind of disappoints me to be honest."

mother4,2gdu3h,zaneriley,5,Sun Sep 14 18:21:07 2014 UTC,The cult is appeased.. For now
mother4,2gdu3h,Hekset,4,Mon Sep 15 04:52:15 2014 UTC,"As of now, yes, but its a tough deadline for us to hit. If we aren't meeting certain milestones by the fall we'll discuss what to do from there."
mother4,2gdu3h,zaneriley,-1,Sun Sep 14 19:30:53 2014 UTC,"Is there going to be some form of official announcement before the game gets released, or are you just going to drop that bomb out of nowhere?"
mother4,2gdu3h,zaneriley,2,Sun Sep 14 19:38:56 2014 UTC,Early supporters (those that signed up on the site) will get the first heads up.
mother4,2gdu3h,madmofo145,1 point,Sun Sep 14 22:58:44 2014 UTC,"Is there any reason the new songs haven't been added to the website? While I'm personally super excited to see actual signs of progress, I can understand others frustrations about lack of updates and the website being a ghost town. I'm sure in the end once released those of us that have been paying attention (and signed up on the site long ago) will get the word out, but it's just a bit odd how the website has been allowed to languish."
mother4,2gdu3h,zaneriley,2,Mon Sep 15 13:35:21 2014 UTC,"Essentially, marketing the game takes about the same amount of effort as production. Frequently, we need production to stop what they're working on and turn their attention to something we'd like to show the public. Though, much of the game we don't want to show the public until they play it. Anyway, we've been prioritizing production over marketing or updates.   Combine that with everyone being volunteer, working in their free time and... you get the idea.  More than anything, we just want to hit our deadline. That's the main goal right now. I'm not saying their won't be some big updates in the future, but for now its full steam ahead on production."
mother4,2gdu3h,madmofo145,1 point,Wed Sep 24 20:31:44 2014 UTC,"I'll certainly accept that, and I will say that this is likely my most anticipated game for the foreseeable future. In truth I can also appreciate the urge to keep as much of the game as secret as possible, and I'll certainly be dropping any other game I'm playing the day you guys release this so that I can play it in it's least spoiled state."
mother4,2gdu3h,thewaffles,4,Thu Sep 25 01:55:43 2014 UTC,"My guess is that they're avoiding a Cease and Desist, and that they would tell us if they stopped working. The Mother 3 fan translation didn't update often either, and when it was released it was incredible."
mother4,2gdu3h,mtagmann,1 point,Thu Sep 25 18:05:00 2014 UTC,That would make sense honestly.
mother4,2fll24,NinjaGoodra,8,Sat Sep 6 00:33:53 2014 UTC,"They're keeping a lot of things secret. The thing with a fanbase like us is that you don't really need to advertise the game. It's a cult audience that's already built in, and people outside that cult following probably won't be interested.  They don't let out a lot of secrets for the sake of surprise, but also because they don't need to. They know we'll get the game, regardless."
mother4,2fll24,LC_Music,5,Sat Sep 6 18:23:19 2014 UTC,"I agree, but they could at least give their fans something like a tweet or anything at all really"
mother4,2fll24,SkyrimCory,1 point,Tue Sep 9 00:57:33 2014 UTC,Just something to let us know that the dream is still alive
mother4,2fll24,GL1TCHYandstuff,5,Tue Sep 16 17:22:01 2014 UTC,"They're probably working hard on it since winter is coming quick, it's understandable that they wouldn't also want to spoil stuff. We already know its playable from the trailer though, and battle mechanics are present etc."

mother4,2ffo8y,mellcrisp,7,Fri Sep 5 06:11:33 2014 UTC,"Agreed. I'm hoping that M4 is as referential to the series as M3 was to Earthbound...as in, not very.  What made M3 great is that it didn't reference it's predecessors all that much, and the few times it did, it was quick and small reference, like Ness' yo yo in Porky's room"
mother4,2ffo8y,LC_Music,2,Fri Sep 5 06:11:53 2014 UTC,I agree that Ness is a a bad idea for a super boss but I think that an optional super boss would be a nice addition

I don't foresee a C&D action coming down from Big N simply because of the non-commercial nature of the release, as well as the spirit of the project upholding the dignity of Itoi's and Nintendo's product as per the link provided in PunchyG's comment.  Whether or not Itoi knows about the Mother 4 project, and it sounds as though he does already, the developers wouldn't have to sell him on the idea to be quite honest. He'll find his way to playing it sooner or later, and then he'll get to evaluate the handiwork of the fans whose lives he's impacted with his games."
mother4,29mxb1,Octothorpe812,-7,Sun Oct 5 02:30:00 2014 UTC,"Nooooooot a good idea.  Regardless of how laid-back Itoi is, Nintendo isn't exactly the same.  Getting anyone official in on the existence a project like this is a surefire way to cause trouble, for the Mother 4 dev team, and possibly for the person at Nintendo who discovers this.  Utmost care should be taken in order to prevent the project (in the form that it's in now, not in the backup form as a spiritual successor) from getting stopped in its tracks.

I don't know if you are familiar with the Super Smash Bros. competitive community but they have been slowly getting Nintendo out of their shell and into their respective communities. Last year a big fighting game tournament called EVO 2013 Nintendo wanted to shut down the Super Smash Bros. Melee tournament event. With the perseverance of the community and the fact that they raised over $200,000 of breast cancer charity money, Nintendo was ultimately won over and they allowed the event. Now this time around in 2014 Smash will be presented at EVO 2014 and Nintendo actually did what most people thought they would never see in their lives. Nintendo is now sponsoring EVO 2014 and are trying to get involved in the community.   Long story short, don't count Nintendo out."

These guys made a game from scratch in honor of one of the most cherished series ever made, and you don't even want them to give it to the guy who loves the series more than anybody. That's low and ignorant."
mother4,29mxb1,LunarWolfX,-4,Fri Jul 4 01:10:43 2014 UTC,Whatever floats your rickety raft.   I'm not being disrespectful. I'm just putting it out there that getting something like this in the line of sight of official folks is like walking into a sniper's view.  Previous examples have shown that legality trumps the desire to see fan-projects thrive. Need I bring up the Chrono Trigger sequel incident? Many of the other doomed fan-translation and fan game projects out there? Better safe than sorry is a good rule of thumb.
mother4,29mxb1,PunchyG,4,Fri Jul 4 04:09:15 2014 UTC,"There's no really reputible fan things that have been cancelled. Chrono Triggers' 3d revival was being sold for money. the chrono trigger sequel was a ROM hack, running on the Chrono Trigger engine, and again was a romhack which are all illegal.   If Nintendo didn't shut down the Mother 3 fan translation they won't shut this down. let alone the fact that shigesato itoi isn't even a Nintendo employee, he's a private citizen and FAR from official.   the OP isn't even talking about sending him something in progress but is saying something about showing him the game when it's done... I don't understand why you have an issue with this when everything youre saying is just knee-jerk reaction. did you even read the link I posted?  that was coming from Iwata, the PRESIDENT of Nintendo.   you aren't a lawyer, you aren't a patent clerk, all you're doing is getting defensive over something you have no experience in, even ignoring official public policy on the subject.   I hope the team does get in contact with Itoi once the game is out, and I'm sure they will and that nothing bad will happen."
mother4,29mxb1,LunarWolfX,-1,Fri Jul 4 06:36:03 2014 UTC,"Good point. My bad. And no, I didn't read the article at first because I hadn't actually noticed the link, LOL. RES Night mode sometimes does that to me.  The previous occasions on which a question like this had been posed regarding fan-projects, they were more about presenting fangames in development for recognition, permission or approval from official sources. (A really, really, dumb idea. One guy who asked something like this wanted to show the progress on his relatively good JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Heritage for the Future remake to Capcom, which would have led to either no response or termination and possible litigation then and there.) I have a knee-jerk reaction to these sorts of questions because one dumb mistake (from ANYONE with knowledge of a project) can ruin tons of hard work. And this scenario presents itself way more times than it ever should. Usually it's met with the same response I've provided because nobody likes to see people's toil go completely to shit because of a bonehead move.  I still wouldn't trust 100% of what Iwata says about anything regarding letting people use their intellectual properties or make fan games, though. People's words and actions are two vastly different, and sometimes completely divergent things. Plus, I feel like the deal with the Mother 3 patch was that Nintendo pretty much knew that Mother 3 was never going to stand a snowball's chance in Hell of getting localized in America officially, and threw us Mother fans a bone.   Show it to Itoi once it's finished, I guess. Some people from starmen.net have actually met him in person and gotten stuff signed personally. Finding those people would be your best bet, probably, unless his mailing address is public knowledge. He'd probably be cool enough to keep the project on the down-low, just in case.  TL;DR Similar situations, not entirely the same, I've seen similar shit so many times that the response is almost second nature, but I today I screwed up, LOL."

Although one selling point for me is the psychedelic aspect, which I think between the visualization backdrops and trippy music, Earthbound really nailed it.  However, I think you are being harsh on the gameplay. It's a bit simple, especially compared to modern titles like Bravely Default, but still I found it enjoyable in its own way (such as the rolling HP meter mechanic). Do you have specifics as to why you dislike the gameplay?"
mother4,28y1bj,struktured,2,Fri Jun 27 03:13:57 2014 UTC,"I do not mind the gameplay I suppose. I did like the use of trippy backgrounds and music. I just wish they pushed for something a little more innovative. What Itoi did was create a great storyline, he just didn't make one of the most important parts, the gameplay. I do enjoy playing the experience of the game, its just that I believe the game could have been more immersive then before if it had some wonderful gameplay elements. Such as bioshock, bioshock has great gameplay, it is so fun and immersive, but it also has a wonderfully crafted storyline. I'm not complaining about the gameplay in Earthbound, I take the game as it is. It is a masterpiece, there were a few things that made the battle system unique in the game, i love the game, it is a work of art, and i guess i wouldn't change anything about it. I might just my nit-picking the game a little. Earthbound is my favorite game of all time, and i wouldn't change it for anything"

I was only pointing out a very subtle, minor detail that Shigesato Itoi-- the creator of the actual Mother series-- included in Earthbound(aka Mother 2). He mentioned it in an interview, which I quoted up there. Honestly the detail is so subtle it probably went over some people's heads. I don't see what's so harmful about that. Besides, I wasn't saying 'oh we NEED gay people in Mother 4!!1!1'. I was just saying I found that little character detail in Earthbound/Mother 2 interesting and I was wondering what other little things people would be looking forward to seeing in Mother 4. I wasn't even saying these details must be about somebody being homosexual, more just the idea of details that some people notice, some people don't, easter egg-esque, etc etc.   I'll just finish my remark with a portion of Itoi's quote from above:   In a normal, real-life society, there are gay children, and I have many gay friends as well. So I thought it would be nice to add one in the game, too."

Yes the project is real, and the reason why we're not getting to much info is because this is a crucial point in development. They have something now that they haven had at any other point in development. A deadline. They are working against the clock to get out a product that will hold up to the Mother name. We also need to remember that they are not getting paid for this, and they are doing it in their free time. I have faith in the Developers and so should everybody."

mother4,28sgvr,mikecard,2,Sun Jun 22 22:18:23 2014 UTC,"I'm sure that as soon as the developers will share info as soon as they are confident with what they have to share. Right now the team must not want to say anything definitive regarding a deadline they may not meet, or show footage of something that may ultimately be scrapped or very different in the released product. They probably need some more time to finalize. I'm sure we'll see this project soon :)"

mother4,2867p3,AlistairePoole,2,Sun Jul 6 05:03:33 2014 UTC,"Well, I think Pastel meant most of the old, OLD writing (please correct me if I'm wrong, staff). True though, we could use more clarity. But I mean, since Zephys isn't a ghost or diamondized on the website, it's safe to assume he's still around, just not talking as much as he used to :P"

mother4,273rff,Smearmytables,9,Sun Sep 14 22:03:38 2014 UTC,Actually they don't have to do anything as far as PSI. The term PSI refers to psychic abilities and are rumored to exist. Nintendo is not the owner of psychic abilities nor the terminology therefore they can keep anything PSI related

How precisely it's been ported to standalone PC/OSX/Linux I couldn't say, perhaps the engine was mated with an emulator backend with any ROM-swapping or savestating functionality removed."
mother4,273rff,MuonManLaserJab,9,Sun Oct 5 02:14:27 2014 UTC,"From their FAQ:   ""The game is being written (essentially) from scratch in C++ using SDL, OpenGL and FMOD.""

mother4,266a53,GlitchyPSI,4,Thu May 22 02:07:12 2014 UTC,They're already spending tons of time and effort on this game. You really want them to go back in and translate the whole game in different languages? This would probably push the release date back and put more strain and pressure on the devs. Maybe when it's released some fans will translate it or the devs will go back in and make a translation update or something.

mother4,23t4sn,Funnypenguin97,4,Thu Apr 24 01:39:36 2014 UTC,"If you're playing the character, they shouldn't talk. Not in a Mother game.  Why? The whole game series started with Ninten, who was originally named ""Boku"", which meant ""Me"", which meant ""the player"".  You're the star of the story, any character development of your protagonist was from a 3rd party or 3rd person perspective while you controlled another character."

mother4,22w3dr,rockinDS24,3,Sun Apr 13 00:37:22 2014 UTC,I believe they're making Travis like past main characters. It wouldn't be much of a mother game without his signature move + other basic psi/PK moves

Ninten had nothing but Defense and Healing PSI. Ness had PK Rockin + Assists and Heals Lucas had PK Love and the same  Best guess is Travis will also be a offense-heavy Healer with PK Daydreams and support PSI

mother4,1ydj2f,the-dave,2,Tue Feb 25 03:37:17 2014 UTC,"Also full ubuntu desktop runs on android devices perfectly,  I could provide specs for that too, it's not much different than the chromebook except screen size, it is just as fast and all that jazz"
mother4,1ydj2f,the-dave,3,Tue Feb 25 06:57:16 2014 UTC,"That's alright, I read ""ARM laptop"" and couldn't think of any, but totally forgot about Chromebooks, heh.  There are some additional considerations I have to make when developing for mobile devices. (I'm including Chromebooks as ""mobile devices"".) At this time, my priorities lie elsewhere, so support for Chromebooks and smartphones is not something to expect for launch. After launch, I will look into supporting these types of devices, but that's about all I can say about it right now."

Everyone is based in the midwest except for Nate. Communication - Perpetual Skype chat, Google Hangout, SMS/Phone. We usually have a few members at a time MIA due to lack of internet connection. (That's me right now) Storage - Dropbox, Google Drive, Amazon Web Service.  Programming - Dave programs alone. Kane and I use git and dropbox for web development.   I hope that helps!"
mother4,1xjvh6,zaneriley,2,Wed Feb 12 03:58:49 2014 UTC,My guess is that they are sending things back/forth and have shared file storage considering the varied ages/professions of those involved.

mother4,1xdpyi,zaneriley,3,Mon Feb 10 05:38:44 2014 UTC,"I'll kind of second this idea. While never a huge fan of the limited inventory in the Mother series, I understood it to an extent. The obvious problem was that while having a limited inventory makes some physical sense, the idea of a baseball bat taking up the same amount of space a packet of salt doesn't. Adding a weight system, backpack compartments or something similar could be very nice as it would make a basically useless system usable, and would make more physical ""sense"" then the system used in previous games. Happy to see some activity on the reddit either way though."
mother4,1xdpyi,madmofo145,2,Wed Feb 12 08:50:24 2014 UTC,"I'll 3rd this. Although I've not had that problem 70% of the time, it sounds like something to give a try. That's what pokemon does to make a backpack/inventory seem more organized as well as more space for certain items like like key-items, consumables, equips, etc."" Overall it seems like a good idea."

EarthBound/Mother 2 is the quirkiest out of the 3, perhaps. The most stereotypically ""EarthBound-ish"" game. References, humor and insanity galore. Also, this one has the most PSI users and, at least to me, the most interesting bosses.  Mother 3 is more heartfelt than Mother 2. I would also go as far as to argue that it's darker. It's also easier (IMO) and introduces more unique mechanics, like the rhythms and such.  Also, there are jokes and subtle references present in 2 and 3 that make reference to all previous games. Understanding these things enriches the gaming experience, I find."
mother4,1s4rzo,LunarWolfX,2,Thu Dec 5 21:09:49 2013 UTC,"Exactly what I was thinking I should do it for! Hm,but if you say M3 is easier... I might have a hard time with the early games then. Oh well.  I really do need to understand some references cause I get lost lol. I also forget most of them.  Maybe the Mother series might actually be better than I thought if I am missing references.  Thanks for the feedback btw! And everyone else too!"

I know that Mother 4 ""doesn't take place in a particular time,"" but c'mon, at least EarthBound gave us 199X. And we knew that Mother 3 took place after an apocalypse in the future. And we can even assume that Mother took place in the 80s. But I digress.  I would have liked a Happy-Days-esque setting if Mother 4 takes place in the 70s. If it takes place in the ""present,"" then I think that it would actually be cool to have pop music references and/or parodies (Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Katy Perry, Bruno Mars, etc.) but I know there's next to zero chance of that happening. Other than that, I expect Earthbound-esque pop references to stuff from the 70s to 80s.  What I'm REALLY hoping for though is John Lennon references. He sang the song ""Mother"" (the song the series is named after). Maybe have a performer named ""Lenny Johnson"" or something."

mother4,1ku6xe,DavidForesterWalrus,6,Thu Aug 22 05:19:01 2013 UTC,"Perhaps these drop-in-and-drop-out mechanics are still in place? The teaser trailer was very chary with revealing anything plot-relevant (except the antenna-like structure at the end, of course) or details of the gameplay as a whole; it didn't, e. g., show any footage of formerly revealed side-characters Ace Finley and Ed and his dog, Betsy, but that does not have to mean those characters aren't a (playable) part of the game anymore! While I believe that Zack will join the bad guys at one point in the game (but even if that'll be permanently or temporarily, who am I to tell?), he could still be an integral part of the party for one or more chapters - just like Flint was in Mother 3."
mother4,1ku6xe,feeldawrath,3,Thu Aug 22 22:21:36 2013 UTC,"Just because he isn't on the website doesn't mean he's not a main character. It just means he's not part of the final party, and honestly, I didn't think he would be anyway.  From what I remember, there was never going to 5 party members at once (you can't even fit five boxes on the battle screen, based on all the screenshots we've seen), and the hotel drop-off mechanic only pertained to whichever characters the story required to be in the party at any given time.  If anything, I'm disappointed that they have bios on the final four main party members. I prefer how Nintendo advertised Mother 3: They only had bios on the members of Lucas' family (who could be considered the main characters at the beginning of the game), and nothing was known about Kumatora and Duster. Basically, the whole story kept tight and we didn't know what would happen to Hinawa or who would compose the final party."

On top of that, nintendo was fully aware of the Mother 3 translation and Earthbound Zero and made no attempts at stopping it. They definitely knew about it (the teams of those games told nintendo they were doing it, and would stop if nintendo desired). Nintendo's attitude towards earthbound seems to be that they just don't care. It took how many years to get an official EB-related release? Nintendo just doesn't care about it, and probably doesn't care about whether or not fans get a hold of the IP  Mr. Itoi has also said, Mother series is done for him.

mother4,1krwyu,coolmatty,1 point,Wed Aug 21 02:21:43 2013 UTC,"Nintendo is actually incredibly strict with copyrights. They shut down almost all fangames. Any you see in existence are usually remnants of projects that were shut down and passed around after. Hell, they're so strict that they tried to take down game footage on YouTube.   They don't normally go after fan translations because that's actually extremely hard to make a case against (since they don't distribute the rom, only a patch for the rom). It's not unheard of but usually lawyers don't bother since it's a difficult case to win. But that ONLY applies to fan translations.  Also, the fact that this game exists in the same Mother universe is enough to file a C&D. The art style, use of names, references to previous games, and such only add to the case."

The basic premise of an art style is the only thing that cannot be copyrighted, but that's not what I meant when I said that. The point was that the game looks extremely similar to previous games (to the point that it could be argued that certain sprites and such were direct copies). That is what I mean by art style.  I know what you /said/, but it's simply not true. Most ""fangames"" are either too small for Nintendo to even take notice or actually were touched and you didn't hear about it. There's a lot of games floating out there being illegally distributed after they were shut down."

Unless it is a direct copy, and are claiming it as a nintendo property or product, there's no problem here.  They're not using any nintendo art, characters, or any IP's at all, nor are they claiming to be nintendo official."
mother4,1krwyu,Papilusion,3,Fri Oct 11 20:34:17 2013 UTC,"The difference between Mother 4 and Chrono Resurrection was that Chrono Resurrection (from what I understand) was supposed to be a 3D remake of Chrono Trigger. Therefore they actually used Square's characters, story, designs, and so on. Mother 4 is supposed to be a new story. There are many free fangames out there, so unless someone actually tries to sell this, then it should be fine."
mother4,1kqwt8,Vanstuke,11,Tue Aug 20 17:57:34 2013 UTC,"Just a thought, but previous Mother games have had a lot of motifs involving humans altering the earth to their- I don't want to say ""liking"" but definitely altering/destroying just to be a little more comfortable. The chimera aspect and the building of new pork city in 3 especially.  The drip to me reminds me of oil. The draining and depletion of Earth's natural resources, be it oil, coal, or precious metals, mining. I could see environmentalism being an over arching theme in a mother game."
mother4,1kqwt8,Isdaaso,4,Tue Aug 20 22:00:58 2013 UTC,"I think the blob-spike has to do something with the logo.   In the teaser, the MOTHER 4 logo earth was green. The blob on the spike is also green. The blob-spike Zack finds is near a lake, since Travis' profile says he lives in a hilly, lake community. I believe it's a device of the Modern Men, sucking the life essence of the earth. All life is dependent on water, so you find these blob-spikes near large bodies of water everywhere. Water powers the device, in which the blob spreads spores (there are white spots around the blob-spike, and the scene where Travis and Meryl walks, there are also white spots, and a waterfall). Spores infect living things, affecting their behavior. The spike emits psychic waves to possess non-living things.   So the drop symbolizes the life essence of earth, being drained away, leaking.  Or maybe in a symbolic way, the earth is crying - portraying the feelings of the main conflict."
mother4,1kqwt8,Grug16,3,Wed Aug 21 16:10:12 2013 UTC,"(This would have been a text post but I wanted to post a picture)  So, what do you guys think the new ""dripping"" logo means? We know that before the website was up, the logo's O had a pair of wings on it in some art. So that must mean since then, either the story has gone through some overhauls, or both logo's correlate with the story. I guess when the game comes out, we'll find out which fits more with the story."
mother4,1kqwt8,gingeratheist,2,Tue Aug 20 18:00:07 2013 UTC,It seems like some kind of vital fluid is dripping out.  Maybe the green stuff on the pylon from the trailer?
