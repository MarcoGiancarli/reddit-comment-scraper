cincinnati,3e3b65,moist_tacos,5,Tue Jul 21 18:57:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's knee jerk or immature. You vote with your dollars. If Mt.

Every time you put your paycheck in the bank, gas in your car, buy groceries, etc. you’re likely sending your money into the hands of Republicans. It’s not that big of a deal."

If that was the case I'd have to fire more than half my staff.   I'm not going to go through the donation lists of every candidate who runs for office and determine which employees or owners of businesses supported who. However, if you put a big sign in your window or on your property I'm not going to support you.

Seriously, saying ""I'm not going there, they have a Kasich sign"" makes you sound like an angsty 17 year old who's been on Tumblr too much.  Kasich is about as moderate as Republicans get, and you're going to boycott places that support him?"
cincinnati,3e3b65,moist_tacos,3,Tue Jul 21 22:32:49 2015 UTC,"Regardless of who the canidate is, by endorsing him they have alienated people who don't support him. Childish or not this reaction should be expected, making this a questionable business desicion. By afilliating their brand with a particular politician they have strapped themselves to the mast of public opinion on a ship they cannot control. Clearly this was an emotional/political descision rather than an economic one, in that they are trading their  economic interest for political capital for the Governor. If that is the desicison they wanted to make they can stand by it, but they can't complain if people react to it, either by boycotting, or perhaps in some cases buying more of their product."

cincinnati,3e1676,OleBenKnobi,2,Tue Jul 21 16:47:54 2015 UTC,I think it's definitely got a (very obvious) bias but the critical information is still easily parsed (RO has ten days to hit their signature quota). The bit about using unpaid volunteers and why is definitely biased/speculative. I'm actually a little blown away by the support this is garnering... (I just checked their facebook page). I'm all for legalizing cannabis but do these people not understand (or not care?) about the potential repercussions a constitutionally protected oligopoly could have?
cincinnati,3e1676,nikolaiFTW,2,Tue Jul 21 22:14:34 2015 UTC,How does the law passed that prevents monopolies from being enshrined in the Ohio constitution affect the bill? Doesn't it have to rewritten at this point anyway?
cincinnati,3e1676,OleBenKnobi,2,Tue Jul 21 15:03:41 2015 UTC,I don't think that law has actually been passed (though I may be wrong). IIRC it's passed to the point of a ballot measure - so in November (when you theoretically could vote on the RO ballot item) you can also vote against the constitutional cartel. I think it was a direct counter-move to the larger (and troubling) precedent that RO would set if passed (the enshrining of cartels within the state constitution).
cincinnati,3e1676,OleBenKnobi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:20:17 2015 UTC,"Why not?  EDIT: The first paragraph of this article seems to say exactly what I thought:   The Ohio House on Wednesday approved legislation intended to block groups from writing monopolies and commercial business interests into the Ohio Constitution, including a marijuana legalization amendment planned to appear on the November ballot."
cincinnati,3e1676,OleBenKnobi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:42:38 2015 UTC,"Lawmakers' proposed amendment would prohibit a monopoly, special interest privilege, benefit, right or license of a ""commercial economic nature"" from being written into the Constitution.

It might be nice to relax on the lawn. Or if you like to dance the lawn is spacious. Or if you just like your space it's nice on the lawn (which is actually artificial turf these days)  But if it rains you have no cover. The pavilion is covered. and yes it's seated. 90% of the lawn has NO DIRECT VIEW of the stage but there are a few jumbotrons which are tough to see until it starts getting dark. Sound is fine on the lawn, but a little better in the pavilion.  The price difference is also a factor... sometimes there are good deals for lawn seats - like $10-20.  Where pavilion is $50-70+  But if lawn is $35 and pavilion is $50 then it's an easier to pick pavilion."
cincinnati,3dzqkn,mizary1,5,Mon Jul 20 21:22:07 2015 UTC,"Depends on the show and the crowd it attracts. If it's country/Top 40/311 or anything that teens might go to, AVOID the lawn. For shows like that, the lawn (unless you sit in a pretty far back or secluded area) is filled with drunk high schoolers trying to smoke and surreptitiously drink, who then stumble through the crowd, not caring that they're stepping on your blanket and shit. I was once in the company of them, and I've vowed that I'll never go to a show like that unless I have pavilion seats.  That said, if it's likely to be an older crowd I can see the lawn being a nice option. It's a shame when people ruin what could be an awesome atmosphere."
cincinnati,3dzqkn,hermion3,7,Tue Jul 21 01:44:40 2015 UTC,Riverbend is one of the shittiest venues in the country.  Get the pavilion seats.
cincinnati,3dzqkn,janedoe2893,5,Tue Jul 21 01:38:23 2015 UTC,"I didn't want to take it that far, because I haven't been to most of the venues in the country. But holy shit, does Riverbend suck."

cincinnati,3dzqkn,ProfBatman,3,Tue Jul 21 13:43:43 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, Manson's live show isn't as elaborate as it used to be, but is still s very visual performance. I would say pavilion is probably worth it, even though I usually prefer lawn seating."
cincinnati,3dzqkn,mizary1,2,Tue Jul 21 14:04:46 2015 UTC,I'd been thinking this was at US Bank...  It's not sold out...  but pavilion almost is.  $60 vs about $35 for lawn. But you are going to be like 6ft from the lawn if you buy pavilion. If you get lawn and get there early you could be almost as close.  I am on the fence...  I'm only a casual MM fan but I've always wanted to see them. I've seen SP a few times and I used to be really into them...  but lately I haven't cared much about them.  I am hoping to score some cheap lawn seats on stubhub last minute or I might even go down and hang around with my finger in the air looking for a cheap/free ticket. If I fail I can always head over to belterra park and bet/watch some simulcast races.  Also if you are a SP fan... you can download/listen to over 1000 of their live shows from archive.org. https://archive.org/details/SmashingPumpkins
cincinnati,3dzqkn,BlackLeatherRain,2,Tue Jul 21 14:23:57 2015 UTC,"I personally will never buy lawn seating again.  Did that at Aerosmith last year, suffered from heat exhaustion due to lack of cover - we'd tried to bring in an umbrella for shade, but those are not permitted."

cincinnati,3dw0v5,NumNumLobster,12,Mon Jul 20 05:18:08 2015 UTC,"Nope.  The U.S. Navy declined on letting the city have the entire submarine (not that it mattered, the boat is pretty massive compared to similar attractions like the WW2 one in Pittsburgh).  The Navy did however donate the ""sail"" and part of the top portion for the sub to be used in a memorial. One was planned, donations have been raised, but i don't believe a final design is set.  It took years for the Navy to turn over pieces. They finally came last summer I believe. It's up to Hamilton County currently, not the city, to finalize a site within Smale Riverfront Park.

cincinnati,3dw35y,sfinney2,3,Mon Jul 20 03:30:37 2015 UTC,"I do remember from my orientation at UC that UCPD has jurisdiction throughout the city of Cincinnati, although they only patrol near campus. Cincinnati PD can also arrest on campus, but leave patrolling to Campus PD (generally)."
cincinnati,3dw35y,ringbinder,2,Mon Jul 20 20:52:30 2015 UTC,"When I did my on-boarding at UC, we were told that there's a very general ""three blocks"" radius within the UC police operate and will respond, but it's not uncommon for them to respond further out. They also have programs in which they have what appear to be paid citizen patrols in outlying areas (like around Bogart's)."
cincinnati,3dw35y,embur,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:43:51 2015 UTC,"Because so many of the students live off of campus they UCPD generally patrol a couple of blocks off the perimeter.

cincinnati,3du1j0,bhone17,21,Sun Jul 19 13:43:06 2015 UTC,"Central Parkway itself is a disaster right now because of all the construction, not the bike lane."
cincinnati,3du1j0,U_arctos,16,Sun Jul 19 15:33:54 2015 UTC,"That does look like a pretty terrible design. At the very least they should have changed the outside lane where people are parking to be more obvious. Maybe painted a solid single yellow line in between the two lanes for the entire strip where people are allowed to park. Or perhaps have put the bike lane in between the curb where cars are to be parked and the lane where cars are supposed to drive.  The design needs to be scrapped, yes, but I don't see that as a reason to remove the bike path entirely. I'd feel pretty dumb if I ran into a parked car, but then again it isn't often that you see them parked inside of what appears to be a regular lane for driving."
cincinnati,3du1j0,bloody_nips83,18,Sun Jul 19 15:02:13 2015 UTC,I feel like the main problem is that people want to view that as a drag strip and go 50mph down it. The bike lane is doing exactly as intended- slowing traffic to a reasonable amount like it should've been before we built these huge arteries right in the middle of our city.
cincinnati,3du1j0,throwaway7568421,8,Sun Jul 19 15:13:15 2015 UTC,"You have to take into consideration that it seems very out of place though - not the bike lane itself, but the cars parked in what looks like a regular car lane. I don't claim to know a solution that would please everyone, and I'm going to go out on a limb here and say I am not nearly as passionate or invested in the issue as you, but I do think the design is inadequate (or at least not implemented very well). Bicycling to and from downtown isn't terribly common in this city. This isn't San Francisco or Copenhagen - we're a mid sized metro in the rust belt. Using bicycles for practical purposes, not just leisure, is a pretty new concept to the area for everyone except biking enthusiasts.  Just because one design is terrible and probably should be revised doesn't mean the city is giving up on the entire concept. We're just trying things out in the process of making the city more bike friendly. Some things will work, others won't."
cincinnati,3du1j0,bloody_nips83,4,Sun Jul 19 15:20:24 2015 UTC,"No, I totally agree. If there is a better way, we should go for it but like you said, scrapping the whole thing isn't the answer. That and places like Copenhagen and San Fran had to start somewhere.  I read this article as saying that the bike lane should just go away entirely, which is right in line with what Cranley really wants."
cincinnati,3du1j0,throwaway7568421,3,Sun Jul 19 15:33:58 2015 UTC,"The road wasn't the problem. It's the design of the bike path. Reducing the bike land width to 5ft and installing additional curb-side parking would keep the bike path and remove the parked cars from the roadway.   But seriously, there is a van parked in the bike lane 100m south of the FOP building on google street view."

cincinnati,3du1j0,moist_tacos,0,Sun Jul 19 19:51:27 2015 UTC,"That's directly on the curb though. This looks much different due to the bike lane separating the driving lanes from the curb. To me at least, as a suburban driver not used to dealing with cars parked on the street, I would be surprised to see cars parked where they are in that video. It's just an unfamiliar design. Ideally people would be paying close attention to road signs and changes on the roads but as we can see that isn't the case for a fair amount of people."

How oblivious do you have to be to do that? And Cranley's solution is to get rid of the bike lane? So people on bikes can share the road with idiot drivers who crash into parked cars? No Thanks.   Not to mention there are hundreds of places in Cincinnati where traffic lanes are parking lanes during certain hours. Half of the streets downtown are set up this way.

I don't want to hit an inattentive pedestrian on the sidewalk doing that kind of speed.  Bike lanes make sense, and they work when drivers pay attention.  But I know that's asking a lot of people to stay off their phones and read street signs when they're piloting a 2 ton steel cage at 50 mph."

cincinnati,3du1j0,kabochia,3,Mon Jul 20 22:09:13 2015 UTC,"I think they just need to make the parking dedicated. The problem is that sometimes it's parking and sometimes it isn't. It's like driving into hyde park from oakley on Ridge. If you live in the area you know what's up, if you are from out of town, yur gonna have a bad time.   Someone else pointed out that this part of the road is treated like a drag strip and in my experience that's the case. If adding the bike lanes slows people down and makes them pay attention I say that's just another bonus of the bike lane.  For all the people asking who uses this lane: Have you tried it? It's freaking awesome. Go rent a red bike or bring your bike downtown and ride from the river front to northside. It's fantastic."

I plan on using it (if its still around!) when I bring friends of mine from Chicago who are used to these kinds of facilities when we visit for MidPoint Music Festival.  You know Cincinnati is at a cross roads between being a pretty awesome city or continuing down the path of bum-fuck obscurity, picking Cranley gave you the path of Bum-Fuck obscurity."
cincinnati,3du1j0,neilworms,-8,Mon Jul 20 14:39:40 2015 UTC,"Why do we want to reduce the flow of traffic on major routes into the city? Especially for seasonal traffic. Aside from the one guy who has bikes from mason to downtown 365 days a year, who else is going to ride their bike more than a couple miles in two inches of snow?"
cincinnati,3du1j0,nkygirl,5,Sun Jul 19 16:43:18 2015 UTC,"75 is right next to C.Parkway and is a ""major route into the city"". C.Parkway is a city street that functions poorly as a city street. That's what's being corrected.  I'm sure there are a lot more people coming from Northside to Downtown on C.Parkway than ""the one guy who has bikes from mason to downtown""."
cincinnati,3du1j0,jorgeZZ,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:28:39 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call it a city street, at least not at that section. It's a parkway and a state highway, it was designed to be an inter-city highway/main traffic artery through the city center. You can't expect the flow of traffic to be at in-city speeds on a road that is designed to be a local express route."
cincinnati,3du1j0,omeara4pheonix,3,Mon Jul 20 13:27:43 2015 UTC,"Its highway function was superseded by the Mill Creek Expressway (aka Interstate 75).   You can't expect the flow of traffic to be at in-city speeds on a road that is designed to be a local express route.   I agree, that's precisely why it needs to be redesigned."
cincinnati,3du1j0,jorgeZZ,2,Mon Jul 20 21:48:55 2015 UTC,"The interstate was designed to be an interstate expressway (hence the name) not a local expressway. If you want a city street go to central ave. Central Pkwy is not and should not be a city street, it should get people from local yet distant places into the city center quickly and efficiently."
cincinnati,3du1j0,omeara4pheonix,0,Mon Jul 20 21:59:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure a bike lane on i75 would go over so well.  But I'd also like to mention that driving down that way, there are a number of times during rush hour when 75 is slower than taking central parkway."
cincinnati,3du1j0,OrdinaryJose,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:41:53 2015 UTC,"It would probably be fine if it was on the other side of the emergency lane, as long as they don't make the right lane become parking for a few hours a day."
cincinnati,3du1j0,omeara4pheonix,0,Mon Jul 20 13:29:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, though there are some expressways on the west coast where they have bike lanes in the emergency shoulder, I've always wondered about the safety of those...  I'm pretty sure in that case its related to the fact that the Pacific Coast Highway is considered a preferred hardcore bicyclist touring route."

If a family is coming from out of town for Reds game and they are staying downtown, there are attractions that are close enough for walking like the Aquarium and Smale Park but the Children's Museum and Art Museum require packing up the kids and driving out of downtown.  The Freedom Center is great, but I don't think it appeals as a ""fun place to visit,"" I think it's more appropriate for teens/adults and has a more serious subject matter.   I'd like to see a Museum Center annex in the Banks with COSI-style combo Children's Museum and Science/Industry Museum.  I'm thinking of something similar to what Toledo or Louisville have that are good for a few hours and if you want the full day experience you go out to the Museum Center."

That company is really closely held and does stuff differently though so maybe not.  Think they started paying all employees a minimum of 11.50 an hour in the 90s.  It has always been 100 percent owned by at most 2 people of immediate relations.

A place to touch down and relax between activities like smale park, the ballpark, museums, etc. So they would be happy with a race track drawn on the floor or a padded area with a few toys or activities. If they want discovery zone that is more of a destination. But yeah, discovery zone could work too :). This comment is 100% me avoiding real world work thinking.

cincinnati,3dj1i3,ninjaciego,21,Thu Jul 16 17:47:30 2015 UTC,"If you like a nice relaxed kind of place I'd check out Highland Coffeehouse. It's my regular spot. It's very laid back and kinda bohemian (for lack of a better word) so you can talk to people or study or get work done even when it's fairly busy, although busy is a relative term. They're generally pretty sleepy, especially in the summer. It's a coffeehouse but there's a full bar. Some students, but most students are grad students."
cincinnati,3dj1i3,photoast,5,Thu Jul 16 18:11:38 2015 UTC,"I've never even heard of this place before. The only coffee place i've been to is Coffee Emporium IIRC.   I will definitely check this one out, I hope there's older people as well because it's been a few years since I finished college hehe  I'm not a coffee person myself but if there's a bar, i'm there.   Thanks!"

cincinnati,3dj1i3,Cincinnativiabelfast,8,Fri Jul 17 15:51:00 2015 UTC,"Nice review!  I'd like to hear about some things you miss about Monterrey. Other than a larger group of friends obviously. I just did a little reading (just wikipedia) and it sounds like Monterrey is a pretty exciting city as well.  Those mountains look incredible. All we have are little hills, but we got lots of them.   It sounds like you like the food and entertainment here...  but in your eyes were are we missing out?  What does Monterrey do better that Cincinnati could be doing?  Also I grew up in Mainville...  back then nobody had ever heard of it!  Now it's the new Mason it seems!  As for suggestions...  if you like crowds and excitement I'd say check out the WEBN fireworks and oktoberfest (the largest outside of germany!) If you like nature there are so many great parks it's tough to pick just one. But Mt Airy Forest is one of my favorites. They have a world class disc golf course there which is super fun - but really challenging compared to others in the area - which there are MANY. If you like live music MOTR pub downtown is a great spot never a cover charge and national acts. See them before they are famous! And be sure to check out the pinball machines downstairs!"
cincinnati,3dj1i3,communityslugs,6,Thu Jul 16 18:33:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as you stated, friends and family are #1 on that list. I miss always having plans for the weekend and just hanging out with my friends.  Monterrey almost has 6 million people living there, so moving to Cincinnati was a drastic change for me. Way less people and way less traffic. I'm glad about the traffic part.  Besides the previously mentioned, the food is another thing I miss A LOT. The most authentic mexican place i've found so far was Taqueria Mercado downtown Cincinnati. There are a lot of ""mexican"" restaurants around, but the food is more tex-mex than true mexican food.  I miss going to the soccer stadium and cheering for my favorite sports team, Tigres. I was a season ticket holder for almost 20 years, so I miss that a lot.  The mountains.. yes.. I do miss them a lot. Cincinnati is really plain and the hills around here are the smallest hills i've ever seen haha :(  I've never been to the WEBN fireworks, are those the ones for labor day? Regarding Oktoberfest, yes, I LOVE IT. I've been to both of them since I moved here and planning on attending this year as well.  Mt Airy Forest, will add that to my list, i've never even heard of it before until now.  I love live music and concerts, i've been to concerts in about 7 different countries so far and have probably attended over 250 in my lifetime. Even with this info, i've never been to the MOTR pub haha. I'll try to check that place as well. Sometimes I hear about cool places but usually end up not going because I sometimes hate going to these places by myself.  I think one of the things that Cincinnati is missing that Monterrey does differently is maybe people interacting with other people outside of their ""social circles"".   I get it, one will usually hang out with people you grew up with or people you work with or people you met in college but one thing I've noticed is that people are REALLY friendly, but only when you talk to them, but I feel like people are not actually looking to make new friends haha.  Maybe I'm not going to the right places or maybe i'm ugly and scary looking as fuck haha or maybe i'm not trying? but one of the things I miss from Monterrey is that social circles are always open.   If you are hanging out with your buddies at a bar or a park and see other people hanging out as well, those social circles will usually join at some point just to get to know each other, hang out and drink together.  But again, these are different cultures we are speaking of and i've only been living here for 2 years so maybe that's how things work up here.  Thanks for the suggestions!"
cincinnati,3dj1i3,communityslugs,5,Thu Jul 16 19:00:39 2015 UTC,"Nah, I'm with you on the people not being social. People are curious about the accent and they chat you up a bit but that's about it. If you're not from here, you have ""work friends"" and you can make a friend for the night at the pub, but never develop any kind of kinsmanship. Everybody's got there own clan and you have to marry into it I think."
cincinnati,3dj1i3,Cincinnativiabelfast,3,Thu Jul 16 19:18:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm from the east coast and have experienced the exact same thing.  But the thing is, the Midwest (outside of Chicago) doesn't get many visitors.  So they're not used to new people.  And when every city around you within a three-hour radius requires a mind-numbingly boring drive over small hills and fields, fields, fields (nowhere near as bad as Iowa or Nebraska, though!!!!) to get to and isn't all that different from the next one, there isn't much motivation to travel.  Moving here almost completely killed my desire to travel due to that.  There are some friendly places here, however.  The regulars at a bar called Arlin's (down on Ludlow Ave in the Gaslight District of Clifton) are friendly and it's a place where you can make friends for life.  Granted, that's my personal experience, but I never felt truly at home in any of the neighborhoods here until I started going there regularly and I don't even drink alcohol (I do have soda, of course)!  There's a variety of sports on, people of many different nationalities (mostly graduate students and professors at UC), and despite coming from different walks of life and professions, we all get along very well.  For me, it's kinda like Cheers.   If you go, though, DON'T go on a Wednesday night!!! It'll be packed-out with entitled college kids who can't handle their beer.  Every other night there is great, ESPECIALLY Tuesday nights, which is karaoke night.  And those tend to be a lot of fun, even for those who don't choose to sing.  There are other places, too, but if you go to a lot of concerts, the local ""underground music"" scene here tends to be quite welcoming.  Check out Cincinnati DIY - I helped run the online presence for four years.  It now has over 3,000 members and is very active!!!!  Most of the people I've met here have been through the music scene, which has been becoming more friendly the past few years.  I'd like to take some of the credit for that... hahaha yeah, right... ;)  https://facebook.com/groups/cincydiy"
cincinnati,3dj1i3,UKFAN3108,2,Thu Jul 16 22:33:57 2015 UTC,"I honestly never been to any place at Clifton at all. Or at least I don't recall, will have to google and see where that is.   But on the idea, I guess I could try that, become a regular somewhere and make some friends.   Never thought of the ""midwest doesn't get that many visitors"" that is true."
cincinnati,3dj1i3,UKFAN3108,2,Thu Jul 16 22:58:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, somebody pointed that out to me years ago.  A lot of things made sense after that.  People generally refer to anywhere near UC as ""Clifton"", but the Ludlow Ave area is Clifton as far as boundaries on a map go.  If you've ever driven between UC and Northside, you've probably passed through here.  We're like a mini-Greenwich Village."
cincinnati,3dj1i3,humbertogzz,2,Thu Jul 16 23:03:18 2015 UTC,"Ok. I looked at the map and yeah. I've been to the Zoo and drove near UC a couple of times. Was driving by myself so didn't know that was ""clifton"" haha  Thanks for the suggestion man! I appreciate it!"

cincinnati,3dj1i3,bluegrassgazer,2,Thu Jul 16 20:37:27 2015 UTC,"UC soccer may not be a bad alternative if you want to watch live in person, but I doubt they have the atmosphere that you are looking for. I'm sure someone else can weigh in about that since I didn't attend UC.   I love Cyclones games too, as long as it isn't one of their family promotion nights. Nothing against families, but If I'm going to a hockey game I don't need parents telling me to watch my language..... its hockey."

cincinnati,3dj1i3,communityslugs,3,Fri Jul 17 04:19:20 2015 UTC,"It's a little far away from downtown (20-30 minutes) but two of my favorite coffee shops are on main street Milford. One is the Main Cup, a small little shop run by an owner. Roasts his own beans in-house. The other is across the street called The Parlor. It's an ice-cream/coffee shop that specializes in mixing the two together. really cool spot. Cool interior, retro looking and really good coffee (Lookout Joe).   Next to The Parlor, is Padrino Pizza. Great pizza! The Foxy Shazam (RIP) pizza is awesome! Created by Foxy Shazam, a local Cincy band that is no more. Has an egg on it!  Another place to check out would be Taco Cracy in Northside. A little closer to home for you. Best tacos hands down I've had in the city, including the banks restaurants like Jefferson Social. It's in the building labeled Northisde International Airport but they always have a sign out front and their door says TACO on it.  Keep exploring! I find new things all the time and I grew up in Cincy!  edit: added links to the sites/yelp pages"
cincinnati,3dj1i3,OleBenKnobi,5,Thu Jul 16 19:38:57 2015 UTC,"Great suggestions! Thank you!  Question though as i'm on mobile so I haven't checked the links yet, is Taco Cracy that food truck which makes Korean Tacos? Name sounds familiar for some reason....  But yeah, I haven't tried any local pizzas yet to be honest, I mean, besides from the big name pizza places like papa johns and la rosa's etc. I heard goodfellas, or something like that was good as well. I think they are near Neon's."

cincinnati,3dj1i3,OleBenKnobi,3,Thu Jul 16 20:46:56 2015 UTC,"Goodfellas is actually pretty cheap. They're pizzas are much bigger than most places. They have a 22"" pizza that's like $16 for a cheese"

cincinnati,3dj1i3,OleBenKnobi,2,Thu Jul 16 22:01:57 2015 UTC,Yeah. They also do slices. I think it's $3.75 for a slice of pepperoni. (From a 22 inch pie). It's my favorite locally and one of the most authentic New York style pizzas in town.

The people who own it and work there are really kind and friendly.  If they weren't, I wouldn't have been going there regularly for the past three or four years or so.  I mean, I'm a greasy-haired thirtysomething metalhead, one of the furthest things you can be from hipster...   Anyhow the tacos are great and as said before, inexpensive.  You get a lot for not much money.  Especially with the potato ones, which are the cheapest.  I find them the most filling.  If you want authentic Mexican food, though, go to La Mexicana in Newport, Kentucky on Monmouth Ave.  That place is AWESOME!!!!!!!!  Btw Tacocracy frequently has all-ages concerts at night, which vary from punk to indie rock to metal."

cincinnati,3dnqe3,3Dubs,3,Fri Jul 17 19:35:02 2015 UTC,"Troubling? I think it's refreshing and spectacular language to hear from a prosecutor. I get that the Enquirer has some new leadership who isn't familial with Cincinnati yet, but Deters' comments summed up the violence that has been occurring in Cincinnati quite well.   Also, this is a pretty left wing, politically correct point of view - something you rarely see out of the Enquirer. Usually they're like the printed version of WLW. More and more it seems like they are leaning right or left on the exact opposite issues as me."
cincinnati,3dnqe3,moist_tacos,-1,Fri Jul 17 20:24:22 2015 UTC,"Fuck Deters. The guy is going on and on, after admitting to not being any sort of expert, about ""those people"", whom he doesn't know.  But the main point here is that what are they actually doing to clean up this city? He's the prosecutor, the police have their mandate - how many major heroin dealers has he put away? People are dying all around me and it's getting cheaper and easier to get. The police have amazing resources (RENO initiative to fight regional narcotics..) and they just can't stop the flow of drugs into Greater Cincinnati.   But let's focus on this one case where his personal opinion doesn't matter. Great idea.   Mike Allen, same. Neither can convict a cop when clearly guilty (the Roger Owensby case was a joke, they suppressed their own evidence). They have zero record on busting major crimes - and I've reported a few fraud cases myself. Nothing.   So how do we get away from this revolving door because overall he's no good.  Edit to call out this from the article:   This is a disturbing set of worn stereotypes for an enforcer of law and order to utter. Deters’ job is to prosecute people based on what they’ve done, not on who they are. He certainly decried the violence in the manner we’d expect from a tough, conservative prosecutor. But he went too far when he began to slap value judgments on a broad set of people, criminals or not. He should take care not to use his bully pulpit to feed racial discord in our community.   This is exactly correct, this is not what he was hired for. His opinion doesn't matter in the courtroom. In fact, combining his statements with the similar story about his son - should he recuse himself from the case? Can we trust he won't cook evidence?"

The world doesn't revolve around anyone. If you want to live there and can't go somewhere else. Why should you be a protected class? I'm a white male and I'm sick of all these groups whining like a bunch of sissies because they can't have something.  The city of Cincinnati has better things to worry about than where people get denied to live or work. You know what? The world doesn't shit puppy dogs and rainbows. And while we are at it I want to make 100k a year but not work for it.  The joke at work is we are to smart and chase the dollar to where almost every protected class gets hand outs. If I was a minority or protected class I could have a house, car, food and free health care and still get a job based on my skin color or sexual orientation.  Life's a bitch. Get over it and get over yourself being gay. I don't care but why should you get special privileges because of it?"

cincinnati,3dhcfe,TPH2,6,Thu Jul 16 13:30:55 2015 UTC,"Seriously, its about on par with San Francisco, which was about the same size as Cincy in 1900 - big difference is San Fran did a better job of preserving its pre-war architecture - Cincy lost 2/3rds of its neighborhoods that were like OTR through urban renewal (though SF did loose a lot of victorians due to the earthquake around 1900).  Its miraculous that Cincy has so much old housing stock that it could preserve anything at all due to the pains of the late 20th century."

cincinnati,3dhcfe,theyre_all_dead_Dave,9,Sat Jul 18 20:19:30 2015 UTC,"Prohibitionist, Carrie Nation, came to the city in 1902 with the intention of busting up saloons with her famous hatchet. She took one look at Vine Street, with 23 saloons between 12th and 13th street alone, and kept moving. “I would have dropped from exhaustion before I went one block,” she said.   Another interesting tidbit about prohibition here is that the Women's Christian Temperance Union also tried to do their famous routine of blocking saloon entrances and shaming men away from them. The fire department showed up and hosed them away. While the whole prohibition movement started in Hillsboro, they made virtually no headway in Cincinnati."
cincinnati,3dhcfe,moist_tacos,5,Thu Jul 16 13:33:04 2015 UTC,"From my understanding as an extremely shitty amateur historian (I watch pbs sometimes) I don't think any of the locals gave two shits about this.    Between being a heavy German area, being right on a trade route from CA to the East Coast, and being an area where many many distilleries, breweries, and just good ol boys who knew how to make some hooch existed the local cops were quickly bought off and most of the citizens didn't care.    We had guys like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Remus this operating pretty openly.  It seemed more or less the feds were the only ones who caused trouble here.    Reminds me almost like the pot scene in states where its legal but technically not at a federal level."
cincinnati,3dhcfe,NumNumLobster,4,Thu Jul 16 14:08:49 2015 UTC,"Ken Burns prohibition was originally on PBS and I think it's still on Netflix. It's definitely worth a watch if you haven't seen it, as a lot of it is devoted to Cincinnati, and Remus in particular.   My favorite Remus story is how he killed his wife in broad daylight in Eden Park in front of dozens of witnesses (including her daughter!). She had taken most of his money and left him for a federal agent that was undercover in jail with Remus. He defended himself in court and the jury liked him so much they found him not guilty by reason of temporary insanity."

cincinnati,3dhcfe,powpowkitty11,6,Thu Jul 16 11:17:24 2015 UTC,"Surprises? I think a lot of people who haven't visited Cincinnati would have a hard time believing this, but Over-The-Rhine is on par with Williamsburg in Brooklyn or the Mission District in San Francisco as far as being a ""hip"" urban neighborhood. I was expecting a watered-down version of suburbia. All the right pieces are there; interesting people, great restaurants and bars, cool shops, a walkable neighborhood, a fantastic park. The only thing missing is public transportation, but that's coming soon. I thought OTR had a lot of similarities with Williamsburg, in particular. The main difference is that Williamsburg feels like it's driven more organically by artists and independents, where OTR feels like it's propelled more by big money and the city. Still, it's all a step in the right direction."
cincinnati,3dhcfe,neilworms,2,Thu Jul 16 16:24:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed 100% - Like you I also lived in Cincy 10 years ago and live in a more progressive city now.  The progress is wonderful, though being in Chicago makes it easy for me to see the dramatic changes as they are happening as I can just hop on the megabus and be in Cincy in about 5 hours for next to nothing :)  I follow this reddit and other news going on down there because its really impressive.   The city just needs to fix its regional transit (get a new mayor too) and it would be well on its way to being the kind of place that its always gorgeous architecture deserves  (growing up near a really ugly city - Dayton Ohio drives home just how pretty it is).    Its people who are familiar with the area but live in more culturally prestigious cities responsibility to let the larger world know how beautiful and up and coming Cincinnati is - greater tourism would do wonders for the city's morale, public image and ability to accomplish great things."

cincinnati,3dhcfe,nismoz33,5,Thu Jul 16 17:37:11 2015 UTC,"Wow, where to start? Get a burrito in the Mission District. All the taquerias are good on a given day. Some of the city's best bars, restaurants, boutiques are centered around Valencia Street in the Mission - the equivalent of Vine Street; multiplied by 100. Mission Street is much grimier and probably the equivalent of Main Street in OTR. Nearby Dolores Park = Washington Square. Dolores Park on a sunny day looks like Woodstock. It's unreal - essentially the city's front lawn. North Beach is the old Italian neighborhood where the beat poets like Kerouac, Ginsburg, etc. used to hang out. Grab a slice at Golden Boy Pizza, an Espresso at Cafe Trieste where Coppola wrote the Godfather, and a beer at Cafe Vesuvio. The Saloon in North Beach still looks and smells like it did in 1965. The best craft beer bar in the city is Toronado in the Lower Haight - my home base. Great views of the city and the Painted Ladies at Alamo Square. The beer garden at Zeitgeist in the Mission is perfect for a sunny day. Drop some LSD and wander around the Haight-Ashbury while you relive the Summer of Love. The Grateful Dead house is at 710 Ashbury. You could spend an entire day in Golden Gate Park and only see half of it. The museums, conservatory, and Japanese Tea Garden are fantastic. Take a hike to the top of Corona Heights, Bernal Heights, or Twin Peaks for the best views of the city. If you're in town on a Friday, go to Off The Grid (food truck festival) at Fort Mason or the Sunday afternoon picnic on the lawn of the Presidio. Book your tickets for Alcatraz now because they sell out far in advance. For spectacular Pacific Ocean/Golden Gate Bridge views, hike Lands End or just walk across the Golden Gate Bridge. The Saturday day morning farmers market at the Ferry Building is a good place to grab coffee and breakfast with views of the bay. If you really must go to Fisherman's Wharf (the SF version of Gatlinburg), take the cable car from Union Square. It's a great way to get there."

In fact I used to 've the director of esports for a game called heroes of newerth and have met up with a lot of people in the area when we organized a college tournament circuit.   Although I never got much into playing sc2 I did cast HoN at the NASL and am close with a few blizzard esports employees.

We eventually invited some locals, which then turned into renting out ""Fox and Hound"" in Mason for big tournaments. We average about 15 people or so for 7 events before everyone lost interest."
